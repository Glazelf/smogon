  "Milotic": {
    "overview": "<p>Milotic has very unique assets that distinguish it as one of the most solid defensive pieces for certain defense-oriented teams. Its Water typing gives it key resistances to Fire, Ice, and Water while only being weak to Grass- and Electric-type attacks. In addition, its 95 / 79 / 125 defenses are impressive. While its Defense is lacking comparatively, it can more than compensate for this with full investment thanks to its amazing Special Defense. These traits allow it to perform nicely against a variety of foes, namely Heatran, Jirachi, Gengar, Swampert, Metagross, Bronzong, Gliscor, Flygon, and Dragonite.</p> <p>Milotic also has a few other neat traits that make it even stronger. While status is a huge issue for Milotic on paper, it can compensate for this to an extent thanks to Marvel Scale. In addition, Milotic is one of few Pokemon with access to Haze, a high-PP move that keeps a large number of potent setup sweepers in check, like Calm Mind Clefable, CroCune, Swords Dance Scizor, and even Dragon Dance Gyarados.</p> <p>Milotic's main flaws are its weakness to entry hazards, passiveness due to its lack of power, and low Speed. This means that aggressive play and a decent number of offensive threats can pressure it, and it also has difficulty against opposing defensive teams. Its weakness to status, even with Marvel Scale, is still an issue, and it detests sand because it limits Milotic's walling capabilities, especially against the likes of Swampert and Jirachi. In addition, Clefable can easily force Milotic out, as it takes any of Milotic's attacks and threatens it with Knock Off. Milotic needs to actively stay healthy in order to maintain its defensive utility, so with enough chip damage and offensive pressure, it can crumble.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Milotic can run an offensive set with moves like Hydro Pump and Hidden Power Electric, which is similar to an offensive Calm Mind Suicune set but with an instant healing move in Recover instead of Calm Mind. However, the omnipresence of Clefable and lack of sufficient spinning support for Milotic means this set is quite difficult to make work. Refresh and Protect are all-around great moves on defensive Pokemon, and they could certainly work well on Milotic, but there's almost never room for them due to Haze's incredible utility and Ice Beam's coverage. A RestTalk set can be considered due to Milotic's Marvel Scale, but Recover is more than sufficient for Milotic to do its job. Confuse Ray is gimmicky, but it could be generally disruptive. Dragon Breath can make Milotic a paralysis spreader, which may have some potential on paralysis spam teams, but it's still difficult to ever justify it over Ice Beam. Hypnosis is a potent move, but its lack of accuracy and the aforementioned difficulty in replacing any of Milotic's standard moves holds it back. Lastly, Mirror Coat can catch foes like Latias, Gengar, and Zapdos by surprise, but it has the same issues as many other alternative moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls like Clefable, Blissey, Latias, and even Jirachi don't mind taking Milotic's attacks too much and have the potential to cripple it with a variety of moves like Toxic, Thunder Wave, Trick, and even Knock Off. That said, Clefable, Latias, and Jirachi may need to watch out for the chance of an Ice Beam freeze.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types like Celebi, Roserade, Shaymin, Abomasnow, and Breloom can threaten Milotic with their powerful STAB Grass-type attacks. Celebi, Roserade, and Shaymin won't be 2HKOed by Ice Beam, and Breloom should be able to survive one, meaning they can always threaten Milotic in some capacity.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types like Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Magnezone don't mind Milotic's attacks too much, and they threaten it with a naturally powerful STAB Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types like Starmie, Suicune, Kingdra, and Tentacruel take very little damage from Milotic's attacks and can often force it out. Although Haze can be effective against certain variants of Suicune and Kingdra, Suicune's Pressure and Kingdra's Dragon-type attacks can still threaten Milotic or force it out.</p> <p><strong>Status Inducers: Milotic detests status, so any Pokemon with Toxic can significantly neuter it if they can inflict it with the move. Will-O-Wisp users like Gengar and even Heatran can also put Milotic on a timer by burning it.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage: Grass Knot from users like Jirachi, Infernape, and Empoleon has the potential to do significant damage to Milotic thanks to its relatively high weight. Foes like Latias, Jirachi, and even Metagross may use Electric-type attacks, of which Milotic must be wary.</p> ",

        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Surf is Milotic’s most consistent STAB move, and its higher PP compared to Hydro Pump makes it better for longer games. Ice Beam hits Breloom, Dragonite, Flygon, Latias, and Celebi for super effective damage and can also threaten to freeze Pokemon like Skarmory and Clefable. Haze is essential to check CroCune, Calm Mind Clefable, Swords Dance Scizor, and many other setup sweepers. Its gargantuan 48 PP gives Milotic increased staying power, which can help force a setup sweeper out. Recover rounds out the set and sets Milotic apart from other bulky Water-types like Suicune and Swampert.</p> <p>Toxic and Hidden Power Electric can be used as alternatives to either Ice Beam or Haze. Toxic can be more effective against offensive Suicune, opposing Milotic, and Latias. Hidden Power Electric is mainly used if it is deemed necessary for Milotic to be a very secure Gyarados check. However, these moves are generally not recommended, as losing the coverage to hit Breloom and Dragon-types or the ability to remove stat changes can backfire tremendously.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximizing HP and Defense investment is essential for taking on physical attackers like Swampert, Gyarados, Flygon, Metagross, Jirachi, and Dragonite as well as possible. The 8 Special Defense EVs are surprisingly important, crucially reducing damage from mixed Dragonite's Draco Meteor, Starmie's Thunderbolt, Gengar's Shadow Ball, and even Empoleon's Grass Knot. Since Milotic is vulnerable to chip damage from sand and entry hazards, Leftovers grants it crucial passive recovery. Even though Marvel Scale could make one consider an item like Flame Orb to boost its Defense, this is never worthwhile. A Calm nature with some Special Defense investment can be used to better take on Gengar, Grass Knot Infernape, Latias, and mixed Dragon-types, but Milotic will be worse off against foes like Swampert and Metagross.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Teams with Milotic often depend on it to check some strong physical attackers, so it can be especially important to keep it healthy with Recover. Try to avoid taking damage-inflicting status if possible even with Marvel Scale, as the Defense bonus generally doesn't compensate for chip damage from the likes of burn and poison largely due to making Milotic more prone to losing to flinches from physical Jirachi variants. If you're playing against a Toxic Spikes team and have no means to remove them, try to switch Milotic into only one layer rather than two. In addition, Milotic will often find itself staying in for longer periods of time against such teams, so taking two layers of Toxic Spikes can render it unable to fulfill its role. Ice Beam can be used against foes like Clefable and bulky Jirachi to fish for a freeze, as they can shrug off Surf. Be mindful of Haze's PP when using the move versus foes like CroCune and Swords Dance Scizor.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Despite Milotic's incredible defensive utility, it does not fit on a wide range of teams. Due to its lack of synergy with popular spinners like Starmie, Forretress, and Tentacruel, it must be built with entry hazards in mind. Magnezone is a solid partner to provide hazard control against Skarmory, preventing it from setting up enough Spikes to give Milotic trouble. Defensive behemoths immune to Spikes like Gliscor, Clefable, your own Skarmory, defensive Latias, and even Rotom-A can create strong cores with Milotic. In particular, while Milotic is excellent at warding off physical onslaughts, specially defensive Clefable can invalidate a large number of special attackers, which makes these two Pokemon incredible together. In addition, Clefable's Knock Off can help compensate for Milotic's lack of offensive presence, assisting it in keeping Suicune in check by allowing the damage from Milotic's Surf to stick. Skarmory's ability to set entry hazards is especially helpful, as Milotic can utilize its impressive staying power to do quite a bit of residual damage to offensive teams.</p> "

  "Rotom-Heat": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-A is a critical member of the DPP OU metagame due to its unique Ghost / Electric typing, offensive utility, and defensive profile. Rotom-A is the most reliable spinblocker in the tier: its wide assortment of resistances, Levitate ability, and well-rounded stats make it the best choice to keep entry hazards up in the long term. These well-rounded stats allow Rotom-A to fulfill a wide variety of roles: an excellent revenge killer with Choice Scarf, a great defensive piece with RestTalk, and an effective offensive Pokemon with either Substitute or its assortment of coverage and utility moves. Rotom-A's solid speed tier, resilience to priority, and offensive presence makes it one of the best revenge killers in the metagame, as it can stop many set up sweepers such as Gyarados, Lucario, and Dragonite while potentially crippling a wall with Trick. Rotom-A is one of the best Will-O-Wisp users in the tier, as its bulk and resistances allow it to burn prominent attackers such as Tyranitar, Jirachi, Scizor, and Metagross. Rotom-A’s utility sets are notorious for being difficult to answer, as with its Speed, Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and great coverage, it is difficult to stop from fulfilling its role.</p> <p>The unique part of Rotom-A is its five different formes, which are all Ghost / Electric type in DPP. Rotom-H is an excellent choice for a Rotom-A forme. Overheat is especially helpful with Choice Scarf, as it takes advantage of Rotom-H’s Steel-type resistance and easily OHKOs Scizor and Lucario while 2HKOing Metagross and offensive Jirachi. It also is effective for defensive sets, as the ability to threaten Overheat, even if Rotom-H doesn’t have it, makes Breloom trying to sleep and break through RestTalk Rotom-h more cautious. Being able to threaten Steel-types offensively instead of burning them with Will-O-Wisp makes Rotom-h a fantastic choice for a Rotom-A forme.</p> <p>Rotom-A’s primary flaws are its weakness to Pursuit, unreliable recovery, and lack of power. Tyranitar is the biggest menace, as although it doesn’t enjoy being burned, Rotom-A struggles to damage Tyranitar much at all due to the Special Defense boost in sand while it gets potentially OHKOed by Crunch or trapped via Pursuit. This vulnerability dampens its revenge killing prowess, as it can be easily removed by one of the most popular Pokemon in the metagame. Dark- and Ghost-type coverage in general is dangerous to Rotom-A, as Gengar OHKOes it and even threats it walls like Machamp and Lucario can hit it hard with Payback and Crunch, respectively. Rotom-A also lacks reliable recovery—RestTalk forces Rotom-A to either be walled easily or lack Will-O-Wisp and forces it to sleep for two turns, while Pain Split is easy to manipulate and struggles to keep Rotom-A healthy. Due to its lack of a generally strong attack, Rotom-A is easily checked by most special walls that can shrug off a burn, such as specially defensive Heatran, Clefable, Blissey, and even Breloom once Toxic Orb activates. Heatran is especially dangerous, as it gains a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes Rotom-A. While Rotom-A has good coverage due to its formes, it doesn’t get STAB on these special moves and often is short on moveslots.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rotom-A’s most prominent other set is Choice Specs, as it hits very hard especially with entry hazard support. It has become less common since it can’t 2HKO Clefable and struggles when locked into a bad move, however. As a frail attacker, it also struggles to differentiate itself from Gengar, who is faster, hits harder, and has many utility options to beat walls. Rotom-A can become a more dedicated sweeper with Charge Beam; especially behind a Substitute, it can get the attack boost on foes such as Clefable who struggle to break the Substitute and then use its coverage such as Hidden Power Fighting and Shadow Ball to sweep. Such sets often struggle to fit everything they want onto one set, however. Defensive Rotom-A has many other options in its last few slots, such as Reflect to better wall physical attacks without relying on Will-O-Wisp, Overheat to more immediately handle Scizor and Lucario, and Discharge to better spread paralysis and still handle Starmie and Skarmory. Rotom-A can also use Reflect and Light Screen to use a dedicated Dual Screens support set. Utility Rotom-A has some other interesting options such as Sucker Punch, Air Slash, Hidden Power Ground, Hidden Power Grass alongside Overheat, and Thunder Wave, but these often aren’t worth the moveslot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Tyranitar is the biggest threat to Rotom-A as, besides Will-O-Wisp, Hydro Pump, and Leaf Storm, its attacks do little even to bulkless Tyranitar. Tyranitar can then Pursuit trap Rotom-A or set up on it with Dragon Dance and KO it. other Dark-types such as Weavile and Spiritomb cannot switch in as easily but threaten it the same.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon: Rotom-A cannot hope to power through specially defensive Heatran, Blissey, and Clefable without multiple critical hits. Heatran is especially devastating, as it absorbs Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes back. Clefable’s Knock Off disables Trick and it can freely heal on almost any Rotom-A. All of these must be careful of Trick, while Heatran will eventually fall to Thunderbolt. Clefable and Blissey struggle to damage Substitute + Pain Split Rotom-A. While Latias is hit super effectively by Shadow Ball, it is bulky enough to withstand it and it easily survives Thunderbolt and other coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Camerupt, Flygon, Gliscor, Gastrodon, and Swampert disable the main way Rotom-A does damage: Thunderbolt. Especially if they have cleric support, Ground-types can mostly switch in repeatedly to Rotom-A and either attack, phase, or Taunt it. Camerupt is notably immune to both Will-O-Wisp and Thunderbolt and is bulky enough to survive Shadow Ball. However, all should be careful of Hydro Pump, Blizzard, or Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: While they cannot switch in, Gengar and opposing Rotom-A can hit Rotom-A hard with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: While Rotom-A is bulky, it is let down by its poor HP stat. As such, it is quite vulnerable to extremely powerful attackers OHKOing or heavily damaging it, such as Choice Specs Latias’s Draco Meteor, +1 Gyarados Waterfall, Dragonite’s boosted Outrage, and Heatran’s Fire-type attacks. Choice Specs Starmie is especially devastating if it OHKOes Rotom-A trying to block Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: While Rotom-A is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, it is still sand vulnerable and often strives to switch in using its resistances and immunities. If it takes a weak attack such as Starmie’s Surf or Forretress’s Payback, it can be forced to use Rest or unable to switch-in again. Choice Scarf and utility sets are even more vulnerable, as it cannot heal easily.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rotom-A’s Speed tier and good coverage make it an excellent revenge killer with a Choice Scarf. Thunderbolt is Rotom-A strongest attack, revenge killing Water-types such as Gyarados, Suicune, and Empoleon. Rotom-A has many different coverage options it can use. Overheat is a prominent one, as despite doing almost nothing to Pursuit Tyranitar, it is fantastic at revenge killing Steel-types who can shrug off a Thunderbolt such as Lucario without a Special Defense drop, Metagross, and especially Scizor. It also nails Grass-types such as Breloom, Roserade, and Shaymin. Another choice is Hydro Pump, which crucially 2HKOs bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and prevents it from being Pursuit trapped it Rotom-A hits it on the switch. It also hits Heatran trying to absorb Will-O-Wisp and Ground-types immune to Thunderbolt such as Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Camerupt. Leaf Storm OHKOes Swampert and Gastrodon while also dissuading Tyranitar from switching in.</p> <p>Shadow Ball completes Rotom-A’s coverage, as it prominently hits Latias, Gengar, and other Rotom-A while providing good neutral coverage should Rotom-A not use one of its forme moves. Hidden Power Ice is another excellent option, as it KOs Dragonite after Stealth Rock, OHKOes Flygon, and threatens Gliscor. Hidden Power Ice is both more reliable than Rotom-F’s Blizzard and does enough damage to its targets. Rounding out the set is Trick, as it is a fantastic way of crippling a special wall such as Clefable, Latias, and Blissey. Trick can also stop a boosted sweeper by locking them into one attack, although doing this often leads to sacrificing Rotom-A. Another option is Will-O-Wisp, which burns Tyranitar on the switch-in to survive a potential Pursuit trap attempt. As the only move Choice Scarf Rotom-A needs is Thunderbolt, it is free to mix and match as needed for its team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rotom-A generally should be running maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs, as it has 447 Speed after the Choice Scarf boost and sits at a crowded speed tier. Maximum Special Attack EVs notably give it the best chance to KO itself and 2HKO Latias with Shadow Ball, KO Wacan Berry Gyarados without Stealth Rock with Thunderbolt, 2HKO bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock with Hydro Pump, and KO Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock. However, Rotom-A can spare some HP EVs to better survive Tyranitar’s Pursuit, Scizor and Lucario’s boosted Bullet Punch, and Gyarados's +1 Waterfall. The fastest threat it needs to revenge kill besides itself is Modest Agility Empoleon, which requires 236 Speed EVs. Another choice is to drop down to 188 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Lucario and Heatran without the Choice Scarf. Rotom-A can also use less Special Attack EVs: it achieves the bulkless Dragonite KO after Stealth Rock with Hidden Power Ice with 160 Special Attack EVs. A common choice for bulkier Rotom-A spreads is to minimize sand damage with the desired Speed and put the rest in Special Attack: some example EV spreads would be 56 HP / 216 SpA / 236 Spe, which minimizes sand damage while maximizing the other stats, and 108 HP / 164 SpA / 236 Spe, which KOs Gyarados after Stealth Rock through Wacan Berry, survives +1 Waterfall after Stealth Rock, and still outspeeds +2 Modest Empoleon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A should switch in sparingly or on its immunities, as it is not very bulky, its choice locked moves are easy to set up on, and it is vulnerable to Pursuit. It enjoys switching in either when a foe such as Gyarados, Lucario, or Scizor sets up or after a KO to appropriately deal with the threat. This can be dangerous, however, as all of them can hit Rotom-A hard on the switch. Keeping Rotom-A hidden also can allow it to sweep late game against weakened threats should its checks be removed. This is especially prevalent against frail hyper offensive teams or those without a Ground-type. Rotom-A’s Trick is an excellent weapon to cripple walls and set up sweepers alike, but make sure Rotom-A’s Speed is no longer needed. Beware of opponents switching in another Choice Scarf Pokemon to nullify it or, worse, a Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Pursuit trapping Rotom-A. Another complication is with Knock Off: in DPP, if either the user or foe is hit with Knock Off, Trick will fail. Be careful with using Trick around Clefable and defensive Empoleon for this reason.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is a premier revenge killer in DPP OU and features on many team styles. Most midpaced offensive teams carry a Choice Scarf revenge killer to backstop them against set-up sweepers—Rotom-A is one of the best at it with its Speed, coverage, and Trick. As Rotom-A is easily covered by the special walls in the tier, it appreciates teammates that can break though them. Breloom and Heatran are fantastic choices, as Breloom takes advantage of Tyranitar, Blissey, Clefable, and Swampert while Heatran can trap them with Magma Storm and then burn Tyranitar, use Explosion on Blissey and Clefable, or OHKO Swampert with Hidden Power Grass. Breloom can also use Mach Punch or a bulky EV spread to revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another Tyranitar check, such as Machamp, bulky Metagross, and Jirachi are appreciated. Rotom-A also enjoys other strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Latias, Zapdos, and offensive Calm Mind Jirachi to weaken Tyranitar to the point it cannot switch into Rotom-A. Rotom-A appreciates threats that can set up on a choiced locked Pursuit: Lucario is an excellent choice, as is Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another excellent option is Torment Heatran, as it appreciates Rotom-A's Trick to set up on choiced locked Pokemon. As powerful choiced attackers such as Choice Band Gyarados, Choice Specs Heatran, Choice Band Tyranitar, and Choice Specs Zapdos can get set up on if they’re locked into the wrong move, Rotom-A can be a good stopgap.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is also fantastic on more frail hyper offenses as speed control and potentially a spinblocker for Spikes. Some prominent offensive partners include Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance or mixed Tyranitar, Dragon Dance or mixed Dragonite, Swords Dance or Agility Lucario, offensive Empoleon, offensive Calm Mind Suicune, and Swords Dance Scizor. These Pokemon can set up on a choiced locked Pursuit as well. Azelf is also an excellent choice to weaken Tyranitar with either paralysis or Explosion. Offensive Spikes Skarmory or Froslass are also good choices, as Choice Scarf Rotom-A can provide spinblocking and appreciates entry hazards wearing down its grounded answers.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rotom-A’s typing, ability, and bulk make it the best defensive spinblocker in the metagame. Rest and Sleep Talk are Rotom-A’s only form of recovery outside of Pain Split and prevent it from succumbing to status and residual damage. It also makes Rotom-A a reliable sleep absorber; however, without Shadow Ball, Rotom-A struggles to damage Breloom while getting 3HKOed by Seed Bomb. Rest also gives Rotom-A a massive stock of PP, making it useful for PP staling.</p> <p>Rotom-A’s most prominent attacking move is Thunderbolt, which OHKOing Gyarados. Thunderbolt also hits Steel-types such as Heatran, Metagross, Empoleon, and Scizor and at least 2HKOs Starmie and Skarmory. However, as Thunderbolt is useless against Ground-types and can’t hit Breloom well, another option is to use Shadow Ball. Shadow Ball prevents RestTalk Rotom-A from being completely unable to damage Taunt Gliscor while also hitting Ghost-weak targets such as Gengar, opposing Rotom-A, and Starmie hard. For the last slot, Rotom-A can either spread burns effectively with Will-O-Wisp or maintain better coverage with both Shadow Ball and Thunderbolt. Will-O-Wisp is preferred, as being able to burn opponents is one of Rotom-A’s core niches. It notably is the best response to Tyranitar, as it will not enjoy a burn unless it has a Lum Berry. Will-O-Wisp also limits switch ins to foes immune to burn damage such as Clefable, Heatran, Camerupt, and Breloom after Toxic Orb activates. Additionally, Natural Cure Pokemon such as Celebi and Blissey can pivot in on Will-O-Wisp. Another option for an Electric-type attack is Discharge, but it suffers from being noticably weaker than Thunderbolt and potentially giving unwanted paralysis.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rotom-A generally needs all of the physical bulk it can get to stave off Tyranitar, Metagross, Machamp, and Lucario. Take care that absolute maximum HP investment Rotom-A makes its HP stat divisible by 16, increasing the damage it takes from sand and heals from Leftovers. Rotom-A also is at a crowded speed tier—many Pokemon such as Empoleon, Tyranitar, Swampert, Machamp, and Breloom aim to outspeed minimum Speed Rotom-A. As such, it can invest 56 EVs to outspeed max Speed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert. Additionally, Rotom-A can add some Special Defense EVs to better handle special coverage from Swampert, survive Gengar’s Shadow Ball, and help prevent Starmie’s Rapid Spin; however, going with a fully specially defensive RestTalk Rotom-A is not advised due to its huge Pursuit weakness. A few Special Attack EVs, such as 20 EVs, also help Thunderbolt break maximum HP Breloom’s Substitute guaranteed and give better chances to OHKO Starmie and Skarmory.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-A should generally be used early to spread burns and block Rapid Spin, preferably before Breloom has activated its Toxic Orb. Rotom-A can lead, as it has good match ups against all common physical leads with the exception of Tyranitar and is immune to Explosion. Mastering the timing of when to use Rest with Rotom-A is critical, as it only has a 24.8% to burn physical attackers such as Tyranitar while asleep. Rotom-A should generally be careful about trying to block Rapid Spin too much, as offensive Starmie sets can OHKO Rotom-A with Hydro Pump while defensive Starmie and Forretress can 3HKO it in sand with Surf and Payback, respectively. Other than these, there are nuances with its usage depending on match up.</p> <p>Against offensive teams, Rotom-A is difficult to handle, as foes typically absorb burns with either Heatran, Refresh Swampert, Lum Berry Tyranitar, or Breloom. These teams also typically lack reliable Rapid Spin users, meaning Rotom-A can lean fully into its defensive roll and more recklessly wall opposing physical attackers and spread burns. As Heatran cannot absorb Rotom-A’s Thunderbolts forever, aggressively predicting it as it comes in can wear it down easily. Be careful against Metagross and Bronzong, as they can Trick Rotom-A an Iron Ball and ruin its ability to handle physical attackers with Earthquake. Despite being able to handle Gyarados, Rotom-A should not be the primary answer, as boosted Gyarados 2HKOs with Waterfall and can flinch Rotom-A—in addition, Gyarados survives Thunderbolt with a Wacan Berry even after Stealth Rock, meaning it can break through Rotom-A coming in on Dragon Dance. Rotom-A should be kept away from foes that can set up or otherwise take advantage of it, including sweepers with Lum Berry such as Dragon Dance Dragonite and Tyranitar; mixed attackers such as Dragonite, Flygon, and Swampert; Taunt users such as Gliscor; and faster Substitute users such as Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi and Breloom.</p> <p>Against more defensive teams, Rotom-A’s main value are its ability to block Rapid Spin, huge pool of PP, and handling problem Pokemon such as Skarmory, Breloom, physical Jirachi, and Starmie. Since Clefable is commonly the first switch into Rotom-A due to being immune to burn damage, absorbing its Knock Off with Rotom-A is one of the better ways to PP Stall it, as Clefable cannot threaten it outside of Calm Mind and Rotom-A will always be able to use Rest if sand is active. Once Rotom-A goes to sleep, not using Sleep Talk greatly increases how much PP Rotom-A has, to 108 if Rotom-A has Thunderbolt and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>RestTalk Rotom-A provides valuable defensive niches and spinblocking. On more defensive teams, it keeps entry hazards up and spreads burns. Spikes setters such as Skarmory and Forretress appreciate this, as neither can prevent Starmie, Donphan, or opposing Forretress from using Rapid Spin. Rotom-A prevents Machamp from spamming DynamicPunch, meaning prominent Fighting-weak walls such as Tyranitar, Clefable, and Blissey appreciate its presence. Clefable also spreads Knock Off for adding onto residual damage. Tyranitar provides sand and traps prominent Pokemon that threaten Rotom-A such as Gengar and offensive Starmie. Both Clefable and Blissey can provide cleric support for Rotom-A. All three provide a switch into Heatran, which greatly threaten Rotom-A with Flash Fire. Rotom-A is a possible choice on big 5 defensive archetypes over the typical Ground-type alongside Skarmory, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Clefable, defensive Latias, and Jirachi. Both offensive and defensive Jirachi sets work: offensive sets appreciate the Spikes and residual damage Rotom-A helps to wrack up, while defensive Jirachi helps shore the team against Dragon Dance sweepers such as Dragonite and Tyranitar that Rotom-A struggles with. Defensive Jirachi also enjoys foes worn down due to Will-O-Wisp and appreciates Rotom-A hitting Skarmory hard. Other bulky Steel-types such as Bronzong are great choices, especially for fully Spikes immune teams. Additionally, Hippowdon, Celebi, and defensive Gyarados can also make solid partners, as they further answer powerful sweepers and are effective with Spikes.</p> <p>Rotom-A’s defensive prowess make it a strong partner for more offensive Spikes based partners as well, as it has more resilience than more frail spinblockers such as Gengar and Choice Scarf Rotom-A. Alongside Swampert and Skarmory, Rotom-A does not have to worry about Tyranitar as much, as entry hazards wear Tyranitar down, while Swampert at least 2HKOes it. Both offensive and defensive Latias sets are fantastic partners for Rotom-A: Choice Specs Latias hammers Tyranitar and weakens it heavily so it can’t handle Rotom-A effectively, while defensive Latias’s resistances and bulk ease some of Rotom-A defensive responsibilities against attackers such as Gyarados and Breloom. Choice Scarf Lucario takes on revenge killing duty against attackers that can set up and OHKO Rotom-A, such as Lum Berry Dragon Dance Dragonite and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Mixed Flygon is an excellent partner, as it’s offensive prowess is greatly enhanced by Spikes and it enjoys Rotom-A switching into Steel-types such as Bronzong and offensive Jirachi and burning them. Empoleon is another excellent partner, as it spreads Knock Off and Rotom-A is immune or resists all of its weaknesses. It also helps against specially offensive Water-types such as Kingdra that Rotom-A cannot deal with. Tyranitar can take on a more offensive role, such as Choice Band to remove special walls or Starmie guaranteed or Dragon Dance to take advantage of Spikes wearing down its answers.</p> "

It also gives Rotom-A a free chance to burn Tyranitar and other Pursuit users such as Scizor.</p> <p>As Substitute limits Rotom-A’s offensive options, it can instead use a coverage move such as Shadow Ball, Hydro Pump, and Blizzard. Shadow Ball notably allows Rotom-A to damage opposing Rotom-A and Gengar, while Hydro Pump and Blizzard provide additional coverage. Hydro Pump hammers Heatran and Ground-types such as Hippowdon trying to phase out Substitute Rotom-A while Blizzard OHKOes Taunt Gliscor, Flygon, Breloom, and Dragonite trying to take advantage of it. Will-O-Wisp is perfect alongside Substitute or the coverage moves, as it burns Steel-types that otherwise wall Rotom-A and gives it an option to threaten Tyranitar. Thunderbolt allows it to KO Water-types and is it’s main offensive option with Substitute.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This specific EV spread aims to outspeed as much as possible so it can get a Substitute up, burn Gliscor before it can use Taunt, and then maximize its bulk. Rotom-A can minimize its HP and instead invest in Special Attack EVs to get as much health back as possible from Pain Split and power up it’s coverage moves, but since Rotom-A’s HP stat is low, it should otherwise aim to maximize HP to be as bulky as possible. Rotom-A generally tries to have a specific Speed stat and then invest the rest into bulk or Special Attack. Some common examples include 64 Speed EVs to outspeed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert; 164 Speed EVs to outspeed positive nature Tyranitar; 220 Speed EVs to outspeed Gyarados, Dragonite, and Breloom; and 188 Speed EVs with a Timid nature to outspeed Heatran, Adamant Lucario, and defensive Latias. As these are crowded speed tiers, it can be beneficial to invest a few more Speed EVs to outspeed the benchmark. When using not as much Speed EVs, it is recommended to use a Modest nature to maximize Rotom-A’s coverage options.</p> <p>Especially if it does not have Substitute, Rotom-A can use a few different items. Leftovers is the most prominent, as it allows Rotom-A to neutralize sand damage and make more Substitute. A more offensive option is to use Life Orb, as Rotom-A can heal with Pain Split and do a lot of damage, but watch out for foes trying to take advantage of Substitute. Without Substitute, some other options such as Colbur Berry to survive Pursuit Tyranitar and other Dark-type attacks, Custap Berry to get one last attack or Pain Split off, and Expert Belt to take advantage of its type coverage are all options.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-A should be cautious when it comes in and either lead or come in on resistance or immunities, as while it can mitigate residual damage with Pain Split, it isn’t bulky enough to stave off heavy damage. With Substitute, it should try to set up as soon as possible on something it forces out such as Skarmory or Gyarados. Take the opportunity to either heal up or spread Will-O-Wisp. Despite its prowess against special walls, it still can perform defensive roles such as block Rapid Spin from defensive Starmie and burn Steel-types. In the lead position, Rotom-A can use Will-O-Wisp and its coverage to take advantage of physical leads, but watch out for Tyranitar. More offensive versions of utility Rotom-A, especially without recovery or Leftovers, get worn down quickly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rotom-A fits on a wide variety of teams due to its unique typing and ability to block Rapid Spin. Utility Rotom-A is commonly featured alongside entry hazards and Pokemon that give it a free switch in on its immunities. A prominent example is Heatran, as Heatran’s Fighting- and Ground-type weaknesses give Rotom-A plenty of opportunities to switch in. Common Spikers alongside utility Rotom-A include Roserade and Skarmory. With Roserade and Heatran, Swampert forms a Fire-Water-Grass core while offensively checking Tyranitar. Another common Water-type with Heatran and Roserade is offensive Suicune, which appreciates Rotom-A taking advantage of special walls and spreading burns. Other checks to Tyranitar, such as Trick + Iron Ball Metagross or defensive Jirachi are appreciated. As these Fire-Water-Grass cores can struggle with multiple Dragon Dance sweepers, Choice Scarf Flygon or Hippowdon can be excellent partners. Alongside Skarmory, Pain Split gives Rotom-A more offensive coverage and Speed than with the defensive set. It spreads burns, staves off Clefable with Pain Split, and gives a switch into Fighting-types. Prominent partners include offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Choice Specs Latias, and Heatran. Choice Scarf Lucario can absorb Rotom-A’s revenge killing responsibilities.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-A is a critical member of the DPP OU metagame due to its unique Ghost / Electric typing, offensive utility, and defensive profile. Rotom-A is the most reliable spinblocker in the tier: its wide assortment of resistances, Levitate ability, and well-rounded stats make it the best choice to keep entry hazards up in the long term. These well-rounded stats allow Rotom-A to fulfill a wide variety of roles: an excellent revenge killer with Choice Scarf, a great defensive piece with RestTalk, and an effective offensive Pokemon with either Substitute or its assortment of coverage and utility moves. Rotom-A's solid speed tier, resilience to priority, and offensive presence makes it one of the best revenge killers in the metagame, as it can stop many set up sweepers such as Gyarados, Lucario, and Dragonite while potentially crippling a wall with Trick. Rotom-A is one of the best Will-O-Wisp users in the tier, as its bulk and resistances allow it to burn prominent attackers such as Tyranitar, Jirachi, Scizor, and Metagross. Rotom-A’s utility sets are notorious for being difficult to answer, as with its Speed, Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and great coverage, it is difficult to stop from fulfilling its role.</p> <p>The unique part of Rotom-A is its five different formes, which are all Ghost / Electric type in DPP. Rotom-W is one of the premier Rotom-A formes. Hydro Pump hits prominent checks such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Hippowdon more reliably than the other formes. It is additionally effective support for rain teams due to its resistances and ability to cripple Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Skarmory while appreciating the boost to Hydro Pump. Even if Rotom-W doesn’t have Hydro Pump, the ability to threaten it against its biggest offensive checks makes Rotom-W one of the best forme choices.</p> <p>Rotom-A’s primary flaws are its weakness to Pursuit, unreliable recovery, and lack of power. Tyranitar is the biggest menace, as although it doesn’t enjoy being burned, Rotom-A struggles to damage Tyranitar much at all due to the Special Defense boost in sand while it gets potentially OHKOed by Crunch or trapped via Pursuit. This vulnerability dampens its revenge killing prowess, as it can be easily removed by one of the most popular Pokemon in the metagame. Dark- and Ghost-type coverage in general is dangerous to Rotom-A, as Gengar OHKOes it and even threats it walls like Machamp and Lucario can hit it hard with Payback and Crunch, respectively. Rotom-A also lacks reliable recovery—RestTalk forces Rotom-A to either be walled easily or lack Will-O-Wisp and forces it to sleep for two turns, while Pain Split is easy to manipulate and struggles to keep Rotom-A healthy. Due to its lack of a generally strong attack, Rotom-A is easily checked by most special walls that can shrug off a burn, such as specially defensive Heatran, Clefable, Blissey, and even Breloom once Toxic Orb activates. Heatran is especially dangerous, as it gains a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes Rotom-A. While Rotom-A has good coverage due to its formes, it doesn’t get STAB on these special moves and often is short on moveslots.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rotom-A’s most prominent other set is Choice Specs, as it hits very hard especially with entry hazard support. It has become less common since it can’t 2HKO Clefable and struggles when locked into a bad move, however. As a frail attacker, it also struggles to differentiate itself from Gengar, who is faster, hits harder, and has many utility options to beat walls. Rotom-A can become a more dedicated sweeper with Charge Beam; especially behind a Substitute, it can get the attack boost on foes such as Clefable who struggle to break the Substitute and then use its coverage such as Hidden Power Fighting and Shadow Ball to sweep. Such sets often struggle to fit everything they want onto one set, however. Defensive Rotom-A has many other options in its last few slots, such as Reflect to better wall physical attacks without relying on Will-O-Wisp, Overheat to more immediately handle Scizor and Lucario, and Discharge to better spread paralysis and still handle Starmie and Skarmory. Rotom-A can also use Reflect and Light Screen to use a dedicated Dual Screens support set. Utility Rotom-A has some other interesting options such as Sucker Punch, Air Slash, Hidden Power Ground, Hidden Power Grass alongside Overheat, and Thunder Wave, but these often aren’t worth the moveslot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Tyranitar is the biggest threat to Rotom-A as, besides Will-O-Wisp, Hydro Pump, and Leaf Storm, its attacks do little even to bulkless Tyranitar. Tyranitar can then Pursuit trap Rotom-A or set up on it with Dragon Dance and KO it. other Dark-types such as Weavile and Spiritomb cannot switch in as easily but threaten it the same.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon: Rotom-A cannot hope to power through specially defensive Heatran, Blissey, and Clefable without multiple critical hits. Heatran is especially devastating, as it absorbs Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes back. Clefable’s Knock Off disables Trick and it can freely heal on almost any Rotom-A. All of these must be careful of Trick, while Heatran will eventually fall to Thunderbolt. Clefable and Blissey struggle to damage Substitute + Pain Split Rotom-A. While Latias is hit super effectively by Shadow Ball, it is bulky enough to withstand it and it easily survives Thunderbolt and other coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Camerupt, Flygon, Gliscor, Gastrodon, and Swampert disable the main way Rotom-A does damage: Thunderbolt. Especially if they have cleric support, Ground-types can mostly switch in repeatedly to Rotom-A and either attack, phase, or Taunt it. Camerupt is notably immune to both Will-O-Wisp and Thunderbolt and is bulky enough to survive Shadow Ball. However, all should be careful of Hydro Pump, Blizzard, or Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: While they cannot switch in, Gengar and opposing Rotom-A can hit Rotom-A hard with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: While Rotom-A is bulky, it is let down by its poor HP stat. As such, it is quite vulnerable to extremely powerful attackers OHKOing or heavily damaging it, such as Choice Specs Latias’s Draco Meteor, +1 Gyarados Waterfall, Dragonite’s boosted Outrage, and Heatran’s Fire-type attacks. Choice Specs Starmie is especially devastating if it OHKOes Rotom-A trying to block Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: While Rotom-A is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, it is still sand vulnerable and often strives to switch in using its resistances and immunities. If it takes a weak attack such as Starmie’s Surf or Forretress’s Payback, it can be forced to use Rest or unable to switch-in again. Choice Scarf and utility sets are even more vulnerable, as it cannot heal easily.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rotom-A’s Speed tier and good coverage make it an excellent revenge killer with a Choice Scarf. Thunderbolt is Rotom-A strongest attack, revenge killing Water-types such as Gyarados, Suicune, and Empoleon. Rotom-A has many different coverage options it can use. Overheat is a prominent one, as despite doing almost nothing to Pursuit Tyranitar, it is fantastic at revenge killing Steel-types who can shrug off a Thunderbolt such as Lucario without a Special Defense drop, Metagross, and especially Scizor. It also nails Grass-types such as Breloom, Roserade, and Shaymin. Another choice is Hydro Pump, which crucially 2HKOs bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and prevents it from being Pursuit trapped it Rotom-A hits it on the switch. It also hits Heatran trying to absorb Will-O-Wisp and Ground-types immune to Thunderbolt such as Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Camerupt. Leaf Storm OHKOes Swampert and Gastrodon while also dissuading Tyranitar from switching in.</p> <p>Shadow Ball completes Rotom-A’s coverage, as it prominently hits Latias, Gengar, and other Rotom-A while providing good neutral coverage should Rotom-A not use one of its forme moves. Hidden Power Ice is another excellent option, as it KOs Dragonite after Stealth Rock, OHKOes Flygon, and threatens Gliscor. Hidden Power Ice is both more reliable than Rotom-F’s Blizzard and does enough damage to its targets. Rounding out the set is Trick, as it is a fantastic way of crippling a special wall such as Clefable, Latias, and Blissey. Trick can also stop a boosted sweeper by locking them into one attack, although doing this often leads to sacrificing Rotom-A. Another option is Will-O-Wisp, which burns Tyranitar on the switch-in to survive a potential Pursuit trap attempt. As the only move Choice Scarf Rotom-A needs is Thunderbolt, it is free to mix and match as needed for its team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rotom-A generally should be running maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs, as it has 447 Speed after the Choice Scarf boost and sits at a crowded speed tier. Maximum Special Attack EVs notably give it the best chance to KO itself and 2HKO Latias with Shadow Ball, KO Wacan Berry Gyarados without Stealth Rock with Thunderbolt, 2HKO bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock with Hydro Pump, and KO Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock. However, Rotom-A can spare some HP EVs to better survive Tyranitar’s Pursuit, Scizor and Lucario’s boosted Bullet Punch, and Gyarados's +1 Waterfall. The fastest threat it needs to revenge kill besides itself is Modest Agility Empoleon, which requires 236 Speed EVs. Another choice is to drop down to 188 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Lucario and Heatran without the Choice Scarf. Rotom-A can also use less Special Attack EVs: it achieves the bulkless Dragonite KO after Stealth Rock with Hidden Power Ice with 160 Special Attack EVs. A common choice for bulkier Rotom-A spreads is to minimize sand damage with the desired Speed and put the rest in Special Attack: some example EV spreads would be 56 HP / 216 SpA / 236 Spe, which minimizes sand damage while maximizing the other stats, and 108 HP / 164 SpA / 236 Spe, which KOs Gyarados after Stealth Rock through Wacan Berry, survives +1 Waterfall after Stealth Rock, and still outspeeds +2 Modest Empoleon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A should switch in sparingly or on its immunities, as it is not very bulky, its choice locked moves are easy to set up on, and it is vulnerable to Pursuit. It enjoys switching in either when a foe such as Gyarados, Lucario, or Scizor sets up or after a KO to appropriately deal with the threat. This can be dangerous, however, as all of them can hit Rotom-A hard on the switch. Keeping Rotom-A hidden also can allow it to sweep late game against weakened threats should its checks be removed. This is especially prevalent against frail hyper offensive teams or those without a Ground-type. Rotom-A’s Trick is an excellent weapon to cripple walls and set up sweepers alike, but make sure Rotom-A’s Speed is no longer needed. Beware of opponents switching in another Choice Scarf Pokemon to nullify it or, worse, a Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Pursuit trapping Rotom-A. Another complication is with Knock Off: in DPP, if either the user or foe is hit with Knock Off, Trick will fail. Be careful with using Trick around Clefable and defensive Empoleon for this reason.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is a premier revenge killer in DPP OU and features on many team styles. Most midpaced offensive teams carry a Choice Scarf revenge killer to backstop them against set-up sweepers—Rotom-A is one of the best at it with its Speed, coverage, and Trick. As Rotom-A is easily covered by the special walls in the tier, it appreciates teammates that can break though them. Breloom and Heatran are fantastic choices, as Breloom takes advantage of Tyranitar, Blissey, Clefable, and Swampert while Heatran can trap them with Magma Storm and then burn Tyranitar, use Explosion on Blissey and Clefable, or OHKO Swampert with Hidden Power Grass. Breloom can also use Mach Punch or a bulky EV spread to revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another Tyranitar check, such as Machamp, bulky Metagross, and Jirachi are appreciated. Rotom-A also enjoys other strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Latias, Zapdos, and offensive Calm Mind Jirachi to weaken Tyranitar to the point it cannot switch into Rotom-A. Rotom-A appreciates threats that can set up on a choiced locked Pursuit: Lucario is an excellent choice, as is Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another excellent option is Torment Heatran, as it appreciates Rotom-A's Trick to set up on choiced locked Pokemon. As powerful choiced attackers such as Choice Band Gyarados, Choice Specs Heatran, Choice Band Tyranitar, and Choice Specs Zapdos can get set up on if they’re locked into the wrong move, Rotom-A can be a good stopgap.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is also fantastic on more frail hyper offenses as speed control and potentially a spinblocker for Spikes. Some prominent offensive partners include Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance or mixed Tyranitar, Dragon Dance or mixed Dragonite, Swords Dance or Agility Lucario, offensive Empoleon, offensive Calm Mind Suicune, and Swords Dance Scizor. These Pokemon can set up on a choiced locked Pursuit as well. Azelf is also an excellent choice to weaken Tyranitar with either paralysis or Explosion. Offensive Spikes Skarmory or Froslass are also good choices, as Choice Scarf Rotom-A can provide spinblocking and appreciates entry hazards wearing down its grounded answers.</p> "

        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rotom-A’s typing, ability, and bulk make it the best defensive spinblocker in the metagame. Rest and Sleep Talk are Rotom-A’s only form of recovery outside of Pain Split and prevent it from succumbing to status and residual damage. It also makes Rotom-A a reliable sleep absorber; however, without Shadow Ball, Rotom-A struggles to damage Breloom while getting 3HKOed by Seed Bomb. Rest also gives Rotom-A a massive stock of PP, making it useful for PP staling.</p> <p>Rotom-A’s most prominent attacking move is Thunderbolt, which OHKOing Gyarados. Thunderbolt also hits Steel-types such as Heatran, Metagross, Empoleon, and Scizor and at least 2HKOs Starmie and Skarmory. However, as Thunderbolt is useless against Ground-types and can’t hit Breloom well, another option is to use Shadow Ball. Shadow Ball prevents RestTalk Rotom-A from being completely unable to damage Taunt Gliscor while also hitting Ghost-weak targets such as Gengar, opposing Rotom-A, and Starmie hard. For the last slot, Rotom-A can either spread burns effectively with Will-O-Wisp or maintain better coverage with both Shadow Ball and Thunderbolt. Will-O-Wisp is preferred, as being able to burn opponents is one of Rotom-A’s core niches. It notably is the best response to Tyranitar, as it will not enjoy a burn unless it has a Lum Berry. Will-O-Wisp also limits switch ins to foes immune to burn damage such as Clefable, Heatran, Camerupt, and Breloom after Toxic Orb activates. Additionally, Natural Cure Pokemon such as Celebi and Blissey can pivot in on Will-O-Wisp. Another option for an Electric-type attack is Discharge, but it suffers from being noticably weaker than Thunderbolt and potentially giving unwanted paralysis.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rotom-A generally needs all of the physical bulk it can get to stave off Tyranitar, Metagross, Machamp, and Lucario. Take care that absolute maximum HP investment Rotom-A makes its HP stat divisible by 16, increasing the damage it takes from sand and heals from Leftovers. Rotom-A also is at a crowded speed tier—many Pokemon such as Empoleon, Tyranitar, Swampert, Machamp, and Breloom aim to outspeed minimum Speed Rotom-A. As such, it can invest 56 EVs to outspeed max Speed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert. Additionally, Rotom-A can add some Special Defense EVs to better handle special coverage from Swampert, survive Gengar’s Shadow Ball, and help prevent Starmie’s Rapid Spin; however, going with a fully specially defensive RestTalk Rotom-A is not advised due to its huge Pursuit weakness. A few Special Attack EVs, such as 20 EVs, also help Thunderbolt break maximum HP Breloom’s Substitute guaranteed and give better chances to OHKO Starmie and Skarmory.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-A should generally be used early to spread burns and block Rapid Spin, preferably before Breloom has activated its Toxic Orb. Rotom-A can lead, as it has good match ups against all common physical leads with the exception of Tyranitar and is immune to Explosion. Mastering the timing of when to use Rest with Rotom-A is critical, as it only has a 24.8% to burn physical attackers such as Tyranitar while asleep. Rotom-A should generally be careful about trying to block Rapid Spin too much, as offensive Starmie sets can OHKO Rotom-A with Hydro Pump while defensive Starmie and Forretress can 3HKO it in sand with Surf and Payback, respectively. Other than these, there are nuances with its usage depending on match up.</p> <p>Against offensive teams, Rotom-A is difficult to handle, as foes typically absorb burns with either Heatran, Refresh Swampert, Lum Berry Tyranitar, or Breloom. These teams also typically lack reliable Rapid Spin users, meaning Rotom-A can lean fully into its defensive roll and more recklessly wall opposing physical attackers and spread burns. As Heatran cannot absorb Rotom-A’s Thunderbolts forever, aggressively predicting it as it comes in can wear it down easily. Be careful against Metagross and Bronzong, as they can Trick Rotom-A an Iron Ball and ruin its ability to handle physical attackers with Earthquake. Despite being able to handle Gyarados, Rotom-A should not be the primary answer, as boosted Gyarados 2HKOs with Waterfall and can flinch Rotom-A—in addition, Gyarados survives Thunderbolt with a Wacan Berry even after Stealth Rock, meaning it can break through Rotom-A coming in on Dragon Dance. Rotom-A should be kept away from foes that can set up or otherwise take advantage of it, including sweepers with Lum Berry such as Dragon Dance Dragonite and Tyranitar; mixed attackers such as Dragonite, Flygon, and Swampert; Taunt users such as Gliscor; and faster Substitute users such as Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi and Breloom.</p> <p>Against more defensive teams, Rotom-A’s main value are its ability to block Rapid Spin, huge pool of PP, and handling problem Pokemon such as Skarmory, Breloom, physical Jirachi, and Starmie. Since Clefable is commonly the first switch into Rotom-A due to being immune to burn damage, absorbing its Knock Off with Rotom-A is one of the better ways to PP Stall it, as Clefable cannot threaten it outside of Calm Mind and Rotom-A will always be able to use Rest if sand is active. Once Rotom-A goes to sleep, not using Sleep Talk greatly increases how much PP Rotom-A has, to 108 if Rotom-A has Thunderbolt and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>RestTalk Rotom-A provides valuable defensive niches and spinblocking. On more defensive teams, it keeps entry hazards up and spreads burns. Spikes setters such as Skarmory and Forretress appreciate this, as neither can prevent Starmie, Donphan, or opposing Forretress from using Rapid Spin. Rotom-A prevents Machamp from spamming DynamicPunch, meaning prominent Fighting-weak walls such as Tyranitar, Clefable, and Blissey appreciate its presence. Clefable also spreads Knock Off for adding onto residual damage. Tyranitar provides sand and traps prominent Pokemon that threaten Rotom-A such as Gengar and offensive Starmie. Both Clefable and Blissey can provide cleric support for Rotom-A. All three provide a switch into Heatran, which greatly threaten Rotom-A with Flash Fire. Rotom-A is a possible choice on big 5 defensive archetypes over the typical Ground-type alongside Skarmory, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Clefable, defensive Latias, and Jirachi. Both offensive and defensive Jirachi sets work: offensive sets appreciate the Spikes and residual damage Rotom-A helps to wrack up, while defensive Jirachi helps shore the team against Dragon Dance sweepers such as Dragonite and Tyranitar that Rotom-A struggles with. Defensive Jirachi also enjoys foes worn down due to Will-O-Wisp and appreciates Rotom-A hitting Skarmory hard. Other bulky Steel-types such as Bronzong are great choices, especially for fully Spikes immune teams. Additionally, Hippowdon, Celebi, and defensive Gyarados can also make solid partners, as they further answer powerful sweepers and are effective with Spikes.</p> <p>Rotom-A’s defensive prowess make it a strong partner for more offensive Spikes based partners as well, as it has more resilience than more frail spinblockers such as Gengar and Choice Scarf Rotom-A. Alongside Swampert and Skarmory, Rotom-A does not have to worry about Tyranitar as much, as entry hazards wear Tyranitar down, while Swampert at least 2HKOes it. Both offensive and defensive Latias sets are fantastic partners for Rotom-A: Choice Specs Latias hammers Tyranitar and weakens it heavily so it can’t handle Rotom-A effectively, while defensive Latias’s resistances and bulk ease some of Rotom-A defensive responsibilities against attackers such as Gyarados and Breloom. Choice Scarf Lucario takes on revenge killing duty against attackers that can set up and OHKO Rotom-A, such as Lum Berry Dragon Dance Dragonite and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Mixed Flygon is an excellent partner, as it’s offensive prowess is greatly enhanced by Spikes and it enjoys Rotom-A switching into Steel-types such as Bronzong and offensive Jirachi and burning them. Empoleon is another excellent partner, as it spreads Knock Off and Rotom-A is immune or resists all of its weaknesses. It also helps against specially offensive Water-types such as Kingdra that Rotom-A cannot deal with. Tyranitar can take on a more offensive role, such as Choice Band to remove special walls or Starmie guaranteed or Dragon Dance to take advantage of Spikes wearing down its answers.</p> "

Despite its prowess against special walls, it still can perform defensive roles such as block Rapid Spin from defensive Starmie and burn Steel-types. In the lead position, Rotom-A can use Will-O-Wisp and its coverage to take advantage of physical leads, but watch out for Tyranitar. More offensive versions of utility Rotom-A, especially without recovery or Leftovers, get worn down quickly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rotom-A fits on a wide variety of teams due to its unique typing and ability to block Rapid Spin. Utility Rotom-A is commonly featured alongside entry hazards and Pokemon that give it a free switch in on its immunities. A prominent example is Heatran, as Heatran’s Fighting- and Ground-type weaknesses give Rotom-A plenty of opportunities to switch in. Common Spikers alongside utility Rotom-A include Roserade and Skarmory. With Roserade and Heatran, Swampert forms a Fire-Water-Grass core while offensively checking Tyranitar. Another common Water-type with Heatran and Roserade is offensive Suicune, which appreciates Rotom-A taking advantage of special walls and spreading burns. Other checks to Tyranitar, such as Trick + Iron Ball Metagross or defensive Jirachi are appreciated. As these Fire-Water-Grass cores can struggle with multiple Dragon Dance sweepers, Choice Scarf Flygon or Hippowdon can be excellent partners. Alongside Skarmory, Pain Split gives Rotom-A more offensive coverage and Speed than with the defensive set. It spreads burns, staves off Clefable with Pain Split, and gives a switch into Fighting-types. Prominent partners include offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Choice Specs Latias, and Heatran. Choice Scarf Lucario can absorb Rotom-A’s revenge killing responsibilities.</p> "

        "name": "Rain Dance (Rotom-W)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rotom-W makes a fantastic weather clearer with Rain Dance, as it lures in Tyranitar and OHKOs bulkless versions after Stealth Rock with a rain boosted Hydro Pump. Rain Dance also helps with Rotom-W's longevity, as it takes sand damage and has no options to heal. With rain, Hydro Pump is quite strong, as it OHKOs bulkless Heatran and physically defensive Hippowdon while also being Rotom-W's strongest attack. Thunderbolt has good coverage with Hydro Pump, as it hits Water-types trying to take advantage of rain hard. Will-O-Wisp completes the set, as Rotom-w is effective at spreading burns to foes that can shrug off a rain boosted Hydro Pump, such as Jirachi and Quagsire. However, since Thunderbolt and Hydro Pump miss out on Grass- and Dragon-types while also struggling to hit Gengar and opposing Rotom-A, Shadow Ball is another great option, as it 2HKOs Latias and completes Rotom-W's coverage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>These specific EVs outspeed Tyranitar, while having almost maximum HP investment to survive Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Crunch. Rotom-W should run at least 20 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature or 120 Special Attack EVs with a neutral nature, as this is necessary to OHKO bulkless Tyranitar in the rain after Stealth Rock. Rotom-W can run more investment as well: it needs 168 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature to OHKO Tyranitar outright. There are numerous Speed investments it can run, ranging from almost no Speed EVs at all, to fully maximum investment to set up Rain Dance more easily. Beware that Rotom-W struggles to switch into its resistances effectively without HP EVs.</p> <p>Rotom-W can either use a Colbur Berry to better survive Tyranitar's attacks, or Damp Rock to increase the amount of turns rain is active. With Colbur Berry, Rotom-W survives even Choice Band Tyranitar's Crunch after Stealth Rock and sand with the spread given. This allows it to use Rain Dance as Tyranitar switches in and dispatch it easily with Hydro Pump. Damp Rock makes Rotom-W a more general rain supporter and has more general utility by keeping rain up longer.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As a rain support Pokemon, Rotom-W should be switching in on its resistances or immunities to set up the other rain sweepers for its team. Rotom-W has a very handy resistance to Electric, allowing it to switch in on Zapdos and Magnezone and prevent them from using Thunderbolt unimpeded. Rotom-W also helps against Skarmory and defensive Jirachi, two huge threats to rain teams. It should be fairly reckless with its health, as if it can set up rain and provide one of its niches such as blocking Rapid Spin or KOing Tyranitar, that makes it much easier for the rain sweepers to do their job. However, if Rotom-W is featured without a full rain team, it should be more cautious with its health. This is because if it can't clear the weather, nothing else can and the sand vulnerable Pokemon will be forced to deal with sand.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>One of the best places for weather clear is alongside sand-vulnerable sweepers such as Suicune and Machamp. Both can use Substitute more aggressively if Rotom-W clears sand and can handle Tyranitar if Rotom-W cannot remove it with Hydro Pump. Substitute + Dragon Dance Gyarados is another good partner, as it appreciates Steel-types being burnt and enjoys sand cleared to make more Substitutes.</p> <p>Rotom-W is also great support for rain teams due to its resistances and being able to handle Skarmory and defensive Jirachi. Two common rain sweepers are Choice Specs Kingdra and Qwilfish. Kingdra’s extreme power allows it to devastate offensive Pokemon trying to switch into a rain boosted Hydro Pump, while Qwilfish can set up Spikes and hits hard. Other rain sweepers such as Ludicolo, Calm Mind Cresselia, defensive Dragon Dance Dragonite, Agility Metagross, and Swords Dance Empoleon are potentially good partners. Calm Mind Cresselia especially appreciates Rotom-W potentially KOing Tyranitar. Rain supporters such as Azelf, Uxie, Bronzong, and Jirachi can work as well to help ease the burden of clearing the weather.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-A is a critical member of the DPP OU metagame due to its unique Ghost / Electric typing, offensive utility, and defensive profile. Rotom-A is the most reliable spinblocker in the tier: its wide assortment of resistances, Levitate ability, and well-rounded stats make it the best choice to keep entry hazards up in the long term. These well-rounded stats allow Rotom-A to fulfill a wide variety of roles: an excellent revenge killer with Choice Scarf, a great defensive piece with RestTalk, and an effective offensive Pokemon with either Substitute or its assortment of coverage and utility moves. Rotom-A's solid speed tier, resilience to priority, and offensive presence makes it one of the best revenge killers in the metagame, as it can stop many set up sweepers such as Gyarados, Lucario, and Dragonite while potentially crippling a wall with Trick. Rotom-A is one of the best Will-O-Wisp users in the tier, as its bulk and resistances allow it to burn prominent attackers such as Tyranitar, Jirachi, Scizor, and Metagross. Rotom-A’s utility sets are notorious for being difficult to answer, as with its Speed, Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and great coverage, it is difficult to stop from fulfilling its role.</p> <p>The unique part of Rotom-A is its five different formes, which are all Ghost / Electric type in DPP. Blizzard gives Rotom-F fantastic coverage alongside Thunderbolt, making it a good choice for a Rotom-A forme. Being able to threaten a strong Ice-type attack makes prominent Pokemon such as Flygon, Dragonite, and Gliscor much more cautious of dealing with Rotom-F, even if it doesn’t have Blizzard. While Blizzard has subpar accuracy, Rotom-F’s defensive sets are bulky enough to use it repeatedly. Rotom-F is the premier forme choice alongside Abomasnow, as permanent hail makes Blizzard perfectly accurate. Rotom-F additionally helps with Steel-types that heavily threaten Abomasnow. Altogether, access to Blizzard makes Rotom-F a nice choice for a Rotom-A forme.</p> <p>Rotom-A’s primary flaws are its weakness to Pursuit, unreliable recovery, and lack of power. Tyranitar is the biggest menace, as although it doesn’t enjoy being burned, Rotom-A struggles to damage Tyranitar much at all due to the Special Defense boost in sand while it gets potentially OHKOed by Crunch or trapped via Pursuit. This vulnerability dampens its revenge killing prowess, as it can be easily removed by one of the most popular Pokemon in the metagame. Dark- and Ghost-type coverage in general is dangerous to Rotom-A, as Gengar OHKOes it and even threats it walls like Machamp and Lucario can hit it hard with Payback and Crunch, respectively. Rotom-A also lacks reliable recovery—RestTalk forces Rotom-A to either be walled easily or lack Will-O-Wisp and forces it to sleep for two turns, while Pain Split is easy to manipulate and struggles to keep Rotom-A healthy. Due to its lack of a generally strong attack, Rotom-A is easily checked by most special walls that can shrug off a burn, such as specially defensive Heatran, Clefable, Blissey, and even Breloom once Toxic Orb activates. Heatran is especially dangerous, as it gains a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes Rotom-A. While Rotom-A has good coverage due to its formes, it doesn’t get STAB on these special moves and often is short on moveslots.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rotom-A’s most prominent other set is Choice Specs, as it hits very hard especially with entry hazard support. It has become less common since it can’t 2HKO Clefable and struggles when locked into a bad move, however. As a frail attacker, it also struggles to differentiate itself from Gengar, who is faster, hits harder, and has many utility options to beat walls. Rotom-A can become a more dedicated sweeper with Charge Beam; especially behind a Substitute, it can get the attack boost on foes such as Clefable who struggle to break the Substitute and then use its coverage such as Hidden Power Fighting and Shadow Ball to sweep. Such sets often struggle to fit everything they want onto one set, however. Defensive Rotom-A has many other options in its last few slots, such as Reflect to better wall physical attacks without relying on Will-O-Wisp, Overheat to more immediately handle Scizor and Lucario, and Discharge to better spread paralysis and still handle Starmie and Skarmory. Rotom-A can also use Reflect and Light Screen to use a dedicated Dual Screens support set. Utility Rotom-A has some other interesting options such as Sucker Punch, Air Slash, Hidden Power Ground, Hidden Power Grass alongside Overheat, and Thunder Wave, but these often aren’t worth the moveslot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Tyranitar is the biggest threat to Rotom-A as, besides Will-O-Wisp, Hydro Pump, and Leaf Storm, its attacks do little even to bulkless Tyranitar. Tyranitar can then Pursuit trap Rotom-A or set up on it with Dragon Dance and KO it. other Dark-types such as Weavile and Spiritomb cannot switch in as easily but threaten it the same.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon: Rotom-A cannot hope to power through specially defensive Heatran, Blissey, and Clefable without multiple critical hits. Heatran is especially devastating, as it absorbs Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes back. Clefable’s Knock Off disables Trick and it can freely heal on almost any Rotom-A. All of these must be careful of Trick, while Heatran will eventually fall to Thunderbolt. Clefable and Blissey struggle to damage Substitute + Pain Split Rotom-A. While Latias is hit super effectively by Shadow Ball, it is bulky enough to withstand it and it easily survives Thunderbolt and other coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Camerupt, Flygon, Gliscor, Gastrodon, and Swampert disable the main way Rotom-A does damage: Thunderbolt. Especially if they have cleric support, Ground-types can mostly switch in repeatedly to Rotom-A and either attack, phase, or Taunt it. Camerupt is notably immune to both Will-O-Wisp and Thunderbolt and is bulky enough to survive Shadow Ball. However, all should be careful of Hydro Pump, Blizzard, or Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: While they cannot switch in, Gengar and opposing Rotom-A can hit Rotom-A hard with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: While Rotom-A is bulky, it is let down by its poor HP stat. As such, it is quite vulnerable to extremely powerful attackers OHKOing or heavily damaging it, such as Choice Specs Latias’s Draco Meteor, +1 Gyarados Waterfall, Dragonite’s boosted Outrage, and Heatran’s Fire-type attacks. Choice Specs Starmie is especially devastating if it OHKOes Rotom-A trying to block Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: While Rotom-A is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, it is still sand vulnerable and often strives to switch in using its resistances and immunities. If it takes a weak attack such as Starmie’s Surf or Forretress’s Payback, it can be forced to use Rest or unable to switch-in again. Choice Scarf and utility sets are even more vulnerable, as it cannot heal easily.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rotom-A’s Speed tier and good coverage make it an excellent revenge killer with a Choice Scarf. Thunderbolt is Rotom-A strongest attack, revenge killing Water-types such as Gyarados, Suicune, and Empoleon. Rotom-A has many different coverage options it can use. Overheat is a prominent one, as despite doing almost nothing to Pursuit Tyranitar, it is fantastic at revenge killing Steel-types who can shrug off a Thunderbolt such as Lucario without a Special Defense drop, Metagross, and especially Scizor. It also nails Grass-types such as Breloom, Roserade, and Shaymin. Another choice is Hydro Pump, which crucially 2HKOs bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and prevents it from being Pursuit trapped it Rotom-A hits it on the switch. It also hits Heatran trying to absorb Will-O-Wisp and Ground-types immune to Thunderbolt such as Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Camerupt. Leaf Storm OHKOes Swampert and Gastrodon while also dissuading Tyranitar from switching in.</p> <p>Shadow Ball completes Rotom-A’s coverage, as it prominently hits Latias, Gengar, and other Rotom-A while providing good neutral coverage should Rotom-A not use one of its forme moves. Hidden Power Ice is another excellent option, as it KOs Dragonite after Stealth Rock, OHKOes Flygon, and threatens Gliscor. Hidden Power Ice is both more reliable than Rotom-F’s Blizzard and does enough damage to its targets. Rounding out the set is Trick, as it is a fantastic way of crippling a special wall such as Clefable, Latias, and Blissey. Trick can also stop a boosted sweeper by locking them into one attack, although doing this often leads to sacrificing Rotom-A. Another option is Will-O-Wisp, which burns Tyranitar on the switch-in to survive a potential Pursuit trap attempt. As the only move Choice Scarf Rotom-A needs is Thunderbolt, it is free to mix and match as needed for its team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rotom-A generally should be running maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs, as it has 447 Speed after the Choice Scarf boost and sits at a crowded speed tier. Maximum Special Attack EVs notably give it the best chance to KO itself and 2HKO Latias with Shadow Ball, KO Wacan Berry Gyarados without Stealth Rock with Thunderbolt, 2HKO bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock with Hydro Pump, and KO Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock. However, Rotom-A can spare some HP EVs to better survive Tyranitar’s Pursuit, Scizor and Lucario’s boosted Bullet Punch, and Gyarados's +1 Waterfall. The fastest threat it needs to revenge kill besides itself is Modest Agility Empoleon, which requires 236 Speed EVs. Another choice is to drop down to 188 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Lucario and Heatran without the Choice Scarf. Rotom-A can also use less Special Attack EVs: it achieves the bulkless Dragonite KO after Stealth Rock with Hidden Power Ice with 160 Special Attack EVs. A common choice for bulkier Rotom-A spreads is to minimize sand damage with the desired Speed and put the rest in Special Attack: some example EV spreads would be 56 HP / 216 SpA / 236 Spe, which minimizes sand damage while maximizing the other stats, and 108 HP / 164 SpA / 236 Spe, which KOs Gyarados after Stealth Rock through Wacan Berry, survives +1 Waterfall after Stealth Rock, and still outspeeds +2 Modest Empoleon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A should switch in sparingly or on its immunities, as it is not very bulky, its choice locked moves are easy to set up on, and it is vulnerable to Pursuit. It enjoys switching in either when a foe such as Gyarados, Lucario, or Scizor sets up or after a KO to appropriately deal with the threat. This can be dangerous, however, as all of them can hit Rotom-A hard on the switch. Keeping Rotom-A hidden also can allow it to sweep late game against weakened threats should its checks be removed. This is especially prevalent against frail hyper offensive teams or those without a Ground-type. Rotom-A’s Trick is an excellent weapon to cripple walls and set up sweepers alike, but make sure Rotom-A’s Speed is no longer needed. Beware of opponents switching in another Choice Scarf Pokemon to nullify it or, worse, a Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Pursuit trapping Rotom-A. Another complication is with Knock Off: in DPP, if either the user or foe is hit with Knock Off, Trick will fail. Be careful with using Trick around Clefable and defensive Empoleon for this reason.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is a premier revenge killer in DPP OU and features on many team styles. Most midpaced offensive teams carry a Choice Scarf revenge killer to backstop them against set-up sweepers—Rotom-A is one of the best at it with its Speed, coverage, and Trick. As Rotom-A is easily covered by the special walls in the tier, it appreciates teammates that can break though them. Breloom and Heatran are fantastic choices, as Breloom takes advantage of Tyranitar, Blissey, Clefable, and Swampert while Heatran can trap them with Magma Storm and then burn Tyranitar, use Explosion on Blissey and Clefable, or OHKO Swampert with Hidden Power Grass. Breloom can also use Mach Punch or a bulky EV spread to revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another Tyranitar check, such as Machamp, bulky Metagross, and Jirachi are appreciated. Rotom-A also enjoys other strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Latias, Zapdos, and offensive Calm Mind Jirachi to weaken Tyranitar to the point it cannot switch into Rotom-A. Rotom-A appreciates threats that can set up on a choiced locked Pursuit: Lucario is an excellent choice, as is Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another excellent option is Torment Heatran, as it appreciates Rotom-A's Trick to set up on choiced locked Pokemon. As powerful choiced attackers such as Choice Band Gyarados, Choice Specs Heatran, Choice Band Tyranitar, and Choice Specs Zapdos can get set up on if they’re locked into the wrong move, Rotom-A can be a good stopgap.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is also fantastic on more frail hyper offenses as speed control and potentially a spinblocker for Spikes. Some prominent offensive partners include Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance or mixed Tyranitar, Dragon Dance or mixed Dragonite, Swords Dance or Agility Lucario, offensive Empoleon, offensive Calm Mind Suicune, and Swords Dance Scizor. These Pokemon can set up on a choiced locked Pursuit as well. Azelf is also an excellent choice to weaken Tyranitar with either paralysis or Explosion. Offensive Spikes Skarmory or Froslass are also good choices, as Choice Scarf Rotom-A can provide spinblocking and appreciates entry hazards wearing down its grounded answers.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rotom-A’s typing, ability, and bulk make it the best defensive spinblocker in the metagame. Rest and Sleep Talk are Rotom-A’s only form of recovery outside of Pain Split and prevent it from succumbing to status and residual damage. It also makes Rotom-A a reliable sleep absorber; however, without Shadow Ball, Rotom-A struggles to damage Breloom while getting 3HKOed by Seed Bomb. Rest also gives Rotom-A a massive stock of PP, making it useful for PP staling.</p> <p>Rotom-A’s most prominent attacking move is Thunderbolt, which OHKOing Gyarados. Thunderbolt also hits Steel-types such as Heatran, Metagross, Empoleon, and Scizor and at least 2HKOs Starmie and Skarmory. However, as Thunderbolt is useless against Ground-types and can’t hit Breloom well, another option is to use Shadow Ball. Shadow Ball prevents RestTalk Rotom-A from being completely unable to damage Taunt Gliscor while also hitting Ghost-weak targets such as Gengar, opposing Rotom-A, and Starmie hard. For the last slot, Rotom-A can either spread burns effectively with Will-O-Wisp or maintain better coverage with both Shadow Ball and Thunderbolt. Will-O-Wisp is preferred, as being able to burn opponents is one of Rotom-A’s core niches. It notably is the best response to Tyranitar, as it will not enjoy a burn unless it has a Lum Berry. Will-O-Wisp also limits switch ins to foes immune to burn damage such as Clefable, Heatran, Camerupt, and Breloom after Toxic Orb activates. Additionally, Natural Cure Pokemon such as Celebi and Blissey can pivot in on Will-O-Wisp. Another option for an Electric-type attack is Discharge, but it suffers from being noticably weaker than Thunderbolt and potentially giving unwanted paralysis.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rotom-A generally needs all of the physical bulk it can get to stave off Tyranitar, Metagross, Machamp, and Lucario. Take care that absolute maximum HP investment Rotom-A makes its HP stat divisible by 16, increasing the damage it takes from sand and heals from Leftovers. Rotom-A also is at a crowded speed tier—many Pokemon such as Empoleon, Tyranitar, Swampert, Machamp, and Breloom aim to outspeed minimum Speed Rotom-A. As such, it can invest 56 EVs to outspeed max Speed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert. Additionally, Rotom-A can add some Special Defense EVs to better handle special coverage from Swampert, survive Gengar’s Shadow Ball, and help prevent Starmie’s Rapid Spin; however, going with a fully specially defensive RestTalk Rotom-A is not advised due to its huge Pursuit weakness. A few Special Attack EVs, such as 20 EVs, also help Thunderbolt break maximum HP Breloom’s Substitute guaranteed and give better chances to OHKO Starmie and Skarmory.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-A should generally be used early to spread burns and block Rapid Spin, preferably before Breloom has activated its Toxic Orb. Rotom-A can lead, as it has good match ups against all common physical leads with the exception of Tyranitar and is immune to Explosion. Mastering the timing of when to use Rest with Rotom-A is critical, as it only has a 24.8% to burn physical attackers such as Tyranitar while asleep. Rotom-A should generally be careful about trying to block Rapid Spin too much, as offensive Starmie sets can OHKO Rotom-A with Hydro Pump while defensive Starmie and Forretress can 3HKO it in sand with Surf and Payback, respectively. Other than these, there are nuances with its usage depending on match up.</p> <p>Against offensive teams, Rotom-A is difficult to handle, as foes typically absorb burns with either Heatran, Refresh Swampert, Lum Berry Tyranitar, or Breloom. These teams also typically lack reliable Rapid Spin users, meaning Rotom-A can lean fully into its defensive roll and more recklessly wall opposing physical attackers and spread burns. As Heatran cannot absorb Rotom-A’s Thunderbolts forever, aggressively predicting it as it comes in can wear it down easily. Be careful against Metagross and Bronzong, as they can Trick Rotom-A an Iron Ball and ruin its ability to handle physical attackers with Earthquake. Despite being able to handle Gyarados, Rotom-A should not be the primary answer, as boosted Gyarados 2HKOs with Waterfall and can flinch Rotom-A—in addition, Gyarados survives Thunderbolt with a Wacan Berry even after Stealth Rock, meaning it can break through Rotom-A coming in on Dragon Dance. Rotom-A should be kept away from foes that can set up or otherwise take advantage of it, including sweepers with Lum Berry such as Dragon Dance Dragonite and Tyranitar; mixed attackers such as Dragonite, Flygon, and Swampert; Taunt users such as Gliscor; and faster Substitute users such as Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi and Breloom.</p> <p>Against more defensive teams, Rotom-A’s main value are its ability to block Rapid Spin, huge pool of PP, and handling problem Pokemon such as Skarmory, Breloom, physical Jirachi, and Starmie. Since Clefable is commonly the first switch into Rotom-A due to being immune to burn damage, absorbing its Knock Off with Rotom-A is one of the better ways to PP Stall it, as Clefable cannot threaten it outside of Calm Mind and Rotom-A will always be able to use Rest if sand is active. Once Rotom-A goes to sleep, not using Sleep Talk greatly increases how much PP Rotom-A has, to 108 if Rotom-A has Thunderbolt and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>RestTalk Rotom-A provides valuable defensive niches and spinblocking. On more defensive teams, it keeps entry hazards up and spreads burns. Spikes setters such as Skarmory and Forretress appreciate this, as neither can prevent Starmie, Donphan, or opposing Forretress from using Rapid Spin. Rotom-A prevents Machamp from spamming DynamicPunch, meaning prominent Fighting-weak walls such as Tyranitar, Clefable, and Blissey appreciate its presence. Clefable also spreads Knock Off for adding onto residual damage. Tyranitar provides sand and traps prominent Pokemon that threaten Rotom-A such as Gengar and offensive Starmie. Both Clefable and Blissey can provide cleric support for Rotom-A. All three provide a switch into Heatran, which greatly threaten Rotom-A with Flash Fire. Rotom-A is a possible choice on big 5 defensive archetypes over the typical Ground-type alongside Skarmory, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Clefable, defensive Latias, and Jirachi. Both offensive and defensive Jirachi sets work: offensive sets appreciate the Spikes and residual damage Rotom-A helps to wrack up, while defensive Jirachi helps shore the team against Dragon Dance sweepers such as Dragonite and Tyranitar that Rotom-A struggles with. Defensive Jirachi also enjoys foes worn down due to Will-O-Wisp and appreciates Rotom-A hitting Skarmory hard. Other bulky Steel-types such as Bronzong are great choices, especially for fully Spikes immune teams. Additionally, Hippowdon, Celebi, and defensive Gyarados can also make solid partners, as they further answer powerful sweepers and are effective with Spikes.</p> <p>Rotom-A’s defensive prowess make it a strong partner for more offensive Spikes based partners as well, as it has more resilience than more frail spinblockers such as Gengar and Choice Scarf Rotom-A. Alongside Swampert and Skarmory, Rotom-A does not have to worry about Tyranitar as much, as entry hazards wear Tyranitar down, while Swampert at least 2HKOes it. Both offensive and defensive Latias sets are fantastic partners for Rotom-A: Choice Specs Latias hammers Tyranitar and weakens it heavily so it can’t handle Rotom-A effectively, while defensive Latias’s resistances and bulk ease some of Rotom-A defensive responsibilities against attackers such as Gyarados and Breloom. Choice Scarf Lucario takes on revenge killing duty against attackers that can set up and OHKO Rotom-A, such as Lum Berry Dragon Dance Dragonite and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Mixed Flygon is an excellent partner, as it’s offensive prowess is greatly enhanced by Spikes and it enjoys Rotom-A switching into Steel-types such as Bronzong and offensive Jirachi and burning them. Empoleon is another excellent partner, as it spreads Knock Off and Rotom-A is immune or resists all of its weaknesses. It also helps against specially offensive Water-types such as Kingdra that Rotom-A cannot deal with. Tyranitar can take on a more offensive role, such as Choice Band to remove special walls or Starmie guaranteed or Dragon Dance to take advantage of Spikes wearing down its answers.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rotom-A can maximize its utility options by using Pain Split as its primary recovery option. Despite being unreliable, Rotom-A can easily heal on special walls like Clefable and Blissey due to its immunity to Seismic Toss. Substitute maximizes Pain Split and gives it more reliability. Substitute blocks status, making Clefable without Encore and Blissey complete set up bait. It also gives Rotom-A a free chance to burn Tyranitar and other Pursuit users such as Scizor.</p> <p>As Substitute limits Rotom-A’s offensive options, it can instead use a coverage move such as Shadow Ball, Hydro Pump, and Blizzard. Shadow Ball notably allows Rotom-A to damage opposing Rotom-A and Gengar, while Hydro Pump and Blizzard provide additional coverage.

Will-O-Wisp is perfect alongside Substitute or the coverage moves, as it burns Steel-types that otherwise wall Rotom-A and gives it an option to threaten Tyranitar.

Rotom-A can minimize its HP and instead invest in Special Attack EVs to get as much health back as possible from Pain Split and power up it’s coverage moves, but since Rotom-A’s HP stat is low, it should otherwise aim to maximize HP to be as bulky as possible. Rotom-A generally tries to have a specific Speed stat and then invest the rest into bulk or Special Attack. Some common examples include 64 Speed EVs to outspeed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert; 164 Speed EVs to outspeed positive nature Tyranitar; 220 Speed EVs to outspeed Gyarados, Dragonite, and Breloom; and 188 Speed EVs with a Timid nature to outspeed Heatran, Adamant Lucario, and defensive Latias. As these are crowded speed tiers, it can be beneficial to invest a few more Speed EVs to outspeed the benchmark. When using not as much Speed EVs, it is recommended to use a Modest nature to maximize Rotom-A’s coverage options.</p> <p>Especially if it does not have Substitute, Rotom-A can use a few different items. Leftovers is the most prominent, as it allows Rotom-A to neutralize sand damage and make more Substitute. A more offensive option is to use Life Orb, as Rotom-A can heal with Pain Split and do a lot of damage, but watch out for foes trying to take advantage of Substitute. Without Substitute, some other options such as Colbur Berry to survive Pursuit Tyranitar and other Dark-type attacks, Custap Berry to get one last attack or Pain Split off, and Expert Belt to take advantage of its type coverage are all options.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-A should be cautious when it comes in and either lead or come in on resistance or immunities, as while it can mitigate residual damage with Pain Split, it isn’t bulky enough to stave off heavy damage. With Substitute, it should try to set up as soon as possible on something it forces out such as Skarmory or Gyarados. Take the opportunity to either heal up or spread Will-O-Wisp. Despite its prowess against special walls, it still can perform defensive roles such as block Rapid Spin from defensive Starmie and burn Steel-types. In the lead position, Rotom-A can use Will-O-Wisp and its coverage to take advantage of physical leads, but watch out for Tyranitar. More offensive versions of utility Rotom-A, especially without recovery or Leftovers, get worn down quickly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rotom-A fits on a wide variety of teams due to its unique typing and ability to block Rapid Spin. Utility Rotom-A is commonly featured alongside entry hazards and Pokemon that give it a free switch in on its immunities. A prominent example is Heatran, as Heatran’s Fighting- and Ground-type weaknesses give Rotom-A plenty of opportunities to switch in. Common Spikers alongside utility Rotom-A include Roserade and Skarmory. With Roserade and Heatran, Swampert forms a Fire-Water-Grass core while offensively checking Tyranitar. Another common Water-type with Heatran and Roserade is offensive Suicune, which appreciates Rotom-A taking advantage of special walls and spreading burns. Other checks to Tyranitar, such as Trick + Iron Ball Metagross or defensive Jirachi are appreciated. As these Fire-Water-Grass cores can struggle with multiple Dragon Dance sweepers, Choice Scarf Flygon or Hippowdon can be excellent partners. Alongside Skarmory, Pain Split gives Rotom-A more offensive coverage and Speed than with the defensive set. It spreads burns, staves off Clefable with Pain Split, and gives a switch into Fighting-types. Prominent partners include offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Choice Specs Latias, and Heatran. Choice Scarf Lucario can absorb Rotom-A’s revenge killing responsibilities.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-A is a critical member of the DPP OU metagame due to its unique Ghost / Electric typing, offensive utility, and defensive profile. Rotom-A is the most reliable spinblocker in the tier: its wide assortment of resistances, Levitate ability, and well-rounded stats make it the best choice to keep entry hazards up in the long term. These well-rounded stats allow Rotom-A to fulfill a wide variety of roles: an excellent revenge killer with Choice Scarf, a great defensive piece with RestTalk, and an effective offensive Pokemon with either Substitute or its assortment of coverage and utility moves. Rotom-A's solid speed tier, resilience to priority, and offensive presence makes it one of the best revenge killers in the metagame, as it can stop many set up sweepers such as Gyarados, Lucario, and Dragonite while potentially crippling a wall with Trick. Rotom-A is one of the best Will-O-Wisp users in the tier, as its bulk and resistances allow it to burn prominent attackers such as Tyranitar, Jirachi, Scizor, and Metagross. Rotom-A’s utility sets are notorious for being difficult to answer, as with its Speed, Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and great coverage, it is difficult to stop from fulfilling its role.</p> <p>The unique part of Rotom-A is its five different formes, which are all Ghost / Electric type in DPP. Unfortunately, Rotom-S has the short end of the stick, as Air Slash simply is not enough of an advantage to use it. Rotom-S’s only perk of using Air Slash is hitting Breloom hard and the flinch chance. While Rotom-S functions perfectly fine as a defensive Rotom-A, it does not bluff the good coverage the other formes have. As such, Rotom-S should not be used outside of novelty, as it is outclassed by its other formes.</p> <p>Rotom-A’s primary flaws are its weakness to Pursuit, unreliable recovery, and lack of power. Tyranitar is the biggest menace, as although it doesn’t enjoy being burned, Rotom-A struggles to damage Tyranitar much at all due to the Special Defense boost in sand while it gets potentially OHKOed by Crunch or trapped via Pursuit. This vulnerability dampens its revenge killing prowess, as it can be easily removed by one of the most popular Pokemon in the metagame. Dark- and Ghost-type coverage in general is dangerous to Rotom-A, as Gengar OHKOes it and even threats it walls like Machamp and Lucario can hit it hard with Payback and Crunch, respectively. Rotom-A also lacks reliable recovery—RestTalk forces Rotom-A to either be walled easily or lack Will-O-Wisp and forces it to sleep for two turns, while Pain Split is easy to manipulate and struggles to keep Rotom-A healthy. Due to its lack of a generally strong attack, Rotom-A is easily checked by most special walls that can shrug off a burn, such as specially defensive Heatran, Clefable, Blissey, and even Breloom once Toxic Orb activates. Heatran is especially dangerous, as it gains a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes Rotom-A. While Rotom-A has good coverage due to its formes, it doesn’t get STAB on these special moves and often is short on moveslots.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rotom-A’s most prominent other set is Choice Specs, as it hits very hard especially with entry hazard support. It has become less common since it can’t 2HKO Clefable and struggles when locked into a bad move, however. As a frail attacker, it also struggles to differentiate itself from Gengar, who is faster, hits harder, and has many utility options to beat walls. Rotom-A can become a more dedicated sweeper with Charge Beam; especially behind a Substitute, it can get the attack boost on foes such as Clefable who struggle to break the Substitute and then use its coverage such as Hidden Power Fighting and Shadow Ball to sweep. Such sets often struggle to fit everything they want onto one set, however. Defensive Rotom-A has many other options in its last few slots, such as Reflect to better wall physical attacks without relying on Will-O-Wisp, Overheat to more immediately handle Scizor and Lucario, and Discharge to better spread paralysis and still handle Starmie and Skarmory. Rotom-A can also use Reflect and Light Screen to use a dedicated Dual Screens support set. Utility Rotom-A has some other interesting options such as Sucker Punch, Air Slash, Hidden Power Ground, Hidden Power Grass alongside Overheat, and Thunder Wave, but these often aren’t worth the moveslot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Tyranitar is the biggest threat to Rotom-A as, besides Will-O-Wisp, Hydro Pump, and Leaf Storm, its attacks do little even to bulkless Tyranitar. Tyranitar can then Pursuit trap Rotom-A or set up on it with Dragon Dance and KO it. other Dark-types such as Weavile and Spiritomb cannot switch in as easily but threaten it the same.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon: Rotom-A cannot hope to power through specially defensive Heatran, Blissey, and Clefable without multiple critical hits. Heatran is especially devastating, as it absorbs Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes back. Clefable’s Knock Off disables Trick and it can freely heal on almost any Rotom-A. All of these must be careful of Trick, while Heatran will eventually fall to Thunderbolt. Clefable and Blissey struggle to damage Substitute + Pain Split Rotom-A. While Latias is hit super effectively by Shadow Ball, it is bulky enough to withstand it and it easily survives Thunderbolt and other coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Camerupt, Flygon, Gliscor, Gastrodon, and Swampert disable the main way Rotom-A does damage: Thunderbolt. Especially if they have cleric support, Ground-types can mostly switch in repeatedly to Rotom-A and either attack, phase, or Taunt it. Camerupt is notably immune to both Will-O-Wisp and Thunderbolt and is bulky enough to survive Shadow Ball. However, all should be careful of Hydro Pump, Blizzard, or Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: While they cannot switch in, Gengar and opposing Rotom-A can hit Rotom-A hard with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: While Rotom-A is bulky, it is let down by its poor HP stat. As such, it is quite vulnerable to extremely powerful attackers OHKOing or heavily damaging it, such as Choice Specs Latias’s Draco Meteor, +1 Gyarados Waterfall, Dragonite’s boosted Outrage, and Heatran’s Fire-type attacks. Choice Specs Starmie is especially devastating if it OHKOes Rotom-A trying to block Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: While Rotom-A is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, it is still sand vulnerable and often strives to switch in using its resistances and immunities. If it takes a weak attack such as Starmie’s Surf or Forretress’s Payback, it can be forced to use Rest or unable to switch-in again. Choice Scarf and utility sets are even more vulnerable, as it cannot heal easily.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rotom-A’s Speed tier and good coverage make it an excellent revenge killer with a Choice Scarf. Thunderbolt is Rotom-A strongest attack, revenge killing Water-types such as Gyarados, Suicune, and Empoleon. Rotom-A has many different coverage options it can use. Overheat is a prominent one, as despite doing almost nothing to Pursuit Tyranitar, it is fantastic at revenge killing Steel-types who can shrug off a Thunderbolt such as Lucario without a Special Defense drop, Metagross, and especially Scizor. It also nails Grass-types such as Breloom, Roserade, and Shaymin. Another choice is Hydro Pump, which crucially 2HKOs bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and prevents it from being Pursuit trapped it Rotom-A hits it on the switch. It also hits Heatran trying to absorb Will-O-Wisp and Ground-types immune to Thunderbolt such as Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Camerupt. Leaf Storm OHKOes Swampert and Gastrodon while also dissuading Tyranitar from switching in.</p> <p>Shadow Ball completes Rotom-A’s coverage, as it prominently hits Latias, Gengar, and other Rotom-A while providing good neutral coverage should Rotom-A not use one of its forme moves. Hidden Power Ice is another excellent option, as it KOs Dragonite after Stealth Rock, OHKOes Flygon, and threatens Gliscor. Hidden Power Ice is both more reliable than Rotom-F’s Blizzard and does enough damage to its targets. Rounding out the set is Trick, as it is a fantastic way of crippling a special wall such as Clefable, Latias, and Blissey. Trick can also stop a boosted sweeper by locking them into one attack, although doing this often leads to sacrificing Rotom-A. Another option is Will-O-Wisp, which burns Tyranitar on the switch-in to survive a potential Pursuit trap attempt. As the only move Choice Scarf Rotom-A needs is Thunderbolt, it is free to mix and match as needed for its team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rotom-A generally should be running maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs, as it has 447 Speed after the Choice Scarf boost and sits at a crowded speed tier. Maximum Special Attack EVs notably give it the best chance to KO itself and 2HKO Latias with Shadow Ball, KO Wacan Berry Gyarados without Stealth Rock with Thunderbolt, 2HKO bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock with Hydro Pump, and KO Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock. However, Rotom-A can spare some HP EVs to better survive Tyranitar’s Pursuit, Scizor and Lucario’s boosted Bullet Punch, and Gyarados's +1 Waterfall. The fastest threat it needs to revenge kill besides itself is Modest Agility Empoleon, which requires 236 Speed EVs. Another choice is to drop down to 188 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Lucario and Heatran without the Choice Scarf. Rotom-A can also use less Special Attack EVs: it achieves the bulkless Dragonite KO after Stealth Rock with Hidden Power Ice with 160 Special Attack EVs. A common choice for bulkier Rotom-A spreads is to minimize sand damage with the desired Speed and put the rest in Special Attack: some example EV spreads would be 56 HP / 216 SpA / 236 Spe, which minimizes sand damage while maximizing the other stats, and 108 HP / 164 SpA / 236 Spe, which KOs Gyarados after Stealth Rock through Wacan Berry, survives +1 Waterfall after Stealth Rock, and still outspeeds +2 Modest Empoleon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A should switch in sparingly or on its immunities, as it is not very bulky, its choice locked moves are easy to set up on, and it is vulnerable to Pursuit. It enjoys switching in either when a foe such as Gyarados, Lucario, or Scizor sets up or after a KO to appropriately deal with the threat. This can be dangerous, however, as all of them can hit Rotom-A hard on the switch. Keeping Rotom-A hidden also can allow it to sweep late game against weakened threats should its checks be removed. This is especially prevalent against frail hyper offensive teams or those without a Ground-type. Rotom-A’s Trick is an excellent weapon to cripple walls and set up sweepers alike, but make sure Rotom-A’s Speed is no longer needed. Beware of opponents switching in another Choice Scarf Pokemon to nullify it or, worse, a Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Pursuit trapping Rotom-A. Another complication is with Knock Off: in DPP, if either the user or foe is hit with Knock Off, Trick will fail. Be careful with using Trick around Clefable and defensive Empoleon for this reason.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is a premier revenge killer in DPP OU and features on many team styles. Most midpaced offensive teams carry a Choice Scarf revenge killer to backstop them against set-up sweepers—Rotom-A is one of the best at it with its Speed, coverage, and Trick. As Rotom-A is easily covered by the special walls in the tier, it appreciates teammates that can break though them. Breloom and Heatran are fantastic choices, as Breloom takes advantage of Tyranitar, Blissey, Clefable, and Swampert while Heatran can trap them with Magma Storm and then burn Tyranitar, use Explosion on Blissey and Clefable, or OHKO Swampert with Hidden Power Grass. Breloom can also use Mach Punch or a bulky EV spread to revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another Tyranitar check, such as Machamp, bulky Metagross, and Jirachi are appreciated. Rotom-A also enjoys other strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Latias, Zapdos, and offensive Calm Mind Jirachi to weaken Tyranitar to the point it cannot switch into Rotom-A. Rotom-A appreciates threats that can set up on a choiced locked Pursuit: Lucario is an excellent choice, as is Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another excellent option is Torment Heatran, as it appreciates Rotom-A's Trick to set up on choiced locked Pokemon. As powerful choiced attackers such as Choice Band Gyarados, Choice Specs Heatran, Choice Band Tyranitar, and Choice Specs Zapdos can get set up on if they’re locked into the wrong move, Rotom-A can be a good stopgap.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is also fantastic on more frail hyper offenses as speed control and potentially a spinblocker for Spikes. Some prominent offensive partners include Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance or mixed Tyranitar, Dragon Dance or mixed Dragonite, Swords Dance or Agility Lucario, offensive Empoleon, offensive Calm Mind Suicune, and Swords Dance Scizor. These Pokemon can set up on a choiced locked Pursuit as well. Azelf is also an excellent choice to weaken Tyranitar with either paralysis or Explosion. Offensive Spikes Skarmory or Froslass are also good choices, as Choice Scarf Rotom-A can provide spinblocking and appreciates entry hazards wearing down its grounded answers.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rotom-A’s typing, ability, and bulk make it the best defensive spinblocker in the metagame. Rest and Sleep Talk are Rotom-A’s only form of recovery outside of Pain Split and prevent it from succumbing to status and residual damage. It also makes Rotom-A a reliable sleep absorber; however, without Shadow Ball, Rotom-A struggles to damage Breloom while getting 3HKOed by Seed Bomb. Rest also gives Rotom-A a massive stock of PP, making it useful for PP staling.</p> <p>Rotom-A’s most prominent attacking move is Thunderbolt, which OHKOing Gyarados. Thunderbolt also hits Steel-types such as Heatran, Metagross, Empoleon, and Scizor and at least 2HKOs Starmie and Skarmory. However, as Thunderbolt is useless against Ground-types and can’t hit Breloom well, another option is to use Shadow Ball. Shadow Ball prevents RestTalk Rotom-A from being completely unable to damage Taunt Gliscor while also hitting Ghost-weak targets such as Gengar, opposing Rotom-A, and Starmie hard. For the last slot, Rotom-A can either spread burns effectively with Will-O-Wisp or maintain better coverage with both Shadow Ball and Thunderbolt. Will-O-Wisp is preferred, as being able to burn opponents is one of Rotom-A’s core niches. It notably is the best response to Tyranitar, as it will not enjoy a burn unless it has a Lum Berry. Will-O-Wisp also limits switch ins to foes immune to burn damage such as Clefable, Heatran, Camerupt, and Breloom after Toxic Orb activates. Additionally, Natural Cure Pokemon such as Celebi and Blissey can pivot in on Will-O-Wisp. Another option for an Electric-type attack is Discharge, but it suffers from being noticably weaker than Thunderbolt and potentially giving unwanted paralysis.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rotom-A generally needs all of the physical bulk it can get to stave off Tyranitar, Metagross, Machamp, and Lucario. Take care that absolute maximum HP investment Rotom-A makes its HP stat divisible by 16, increasing the damage it takes from sand and heals from Leftovers. Rotom-A also is at a crowded speed tier—many Pokemon such as Empoleon, Tyranitar, Swampert, Machamp, and Breloom aim to outspeed minimum Speed Rotom-A. As such, it can invest 56 EVs to outspeed max Speed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert. Additionally, Rotom-A can add some Special Defense EVs to better handle special coverage from Swampert, survive Gengar’s Shadow Ball, and help prevent Starmie’s Rapid Spin; however, going with a fully specially defensive RestTalk Rotom-A is not advised due to its huge Pursuit weakness. A few Special Attack EVs, such as 20 EVs, also help Thunderbolt break maximum HP Breloom’s Substitute guaranteed and give better chances to OHKO Starmie and Skarmory.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-A should generally be used early to spread burns and block Rapid Spin, preferably before Breloom has activated its Toxic Orb. Rotom-A can lead, as it has good match ups against all common physical leads with the exception of Tyranitar and is immune to Explosion. Mastering the timing of when to use Rest with Rotom-A is critical, as it only has a 24.8% to burn physical attackers such as Tyranitar while asleep. Rotom-A should generally be careful about trying to block Rapid Spin too much, as offensive Starmie sets can OHKO Rotom-A with Hydro Pump while defensive Starmie and Forretress can 3HKO it in sand with Surf and Payback, respectively. Other than these, there are nuances with its usage depending on match up.</p> <p>Against offensive teams, Rotom-A is difficult to handle, as foes typically absorb burns with either Heatran, Refresh Swampert, Lum Berry Tyranitar, or Breloom. These teams also typically lack reliable Rapid Spin users, meaning Rotom-A can lean fully into its defensive roll and more recklessly wall opposing physical attackers and spread burns. As Heatran cannot absorb Rotom-A’s Thunderbolts forever, aggressively predicting it as it comes in can wear it down easily. Be careful against Metagross and Bronzong, as they can Trick Rotom-A an Iron Ball and ruin its ability to handle physical attackers with Earthquake. Despite being able to handle Gyarados, Rotom-A should not be the primary answer, as boosted Gyarados 2HKOs with Waterfall and can flinch Rotom-A—in addition, Gyarados survives Thunderbolt with a Wacan Berry even after Stealth Rock, meaning it can break through Rotom-A coming in on Dragon Dance. Rotom-A should be kept away from foes that can set up or otherwise take advantage of it, including sweepers with Lum Berry such as Dragon Dance Dragonite and Tyranitar; mixed attackers such as Dragonite, Flygon, and Swampert; Taunt users such as Gliscor; and faster Substitute users such as Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi and Breloom.</p> <p>Against more defensive teams, Rotom-A’s main value are its ability to block Rapid Spin, huge pool of PP, and handling problem Pokemon such as Skarmory, Breloom, physical Jirachi, and Starmie. Since Clefable is commonly the first switch into Rotom-A due to being immune to burn damage, absorbing its Knock Off with Rotom-A is one of the better ways to PP Stall it, as Clefable cannot threaten it outside of Calm Mind and Rotom-A will always be able to use Rest if sand is active. Once Rotom-A goes to sleep, not using Sleep Talk greatly increases how much PP Rotom-A has, to 108 if Rotom-A has Thunderbolt and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>RestTalk Rotom-A provides valuable defensive niches and spinblocking. On more defensive teams, it keeps entry hazards up and spreads burns. Spikes setters such as Skarmory and Forretress appreciate this, as neither can prevent Starmie, Donphan, or opposing Forretress from using Rapid Spin. Rotom-A prevents Machamp from spamming DynamicPunch, meaning prominent Fighting-weak walls such as Tyranitar, Clefable, and Blissey appreciate its presence. Clefable also spreads Knock Off for adding onto residual damage. Tyranitar provides sand and traps prominent Pokemon that threaten Rotom-A such as Gengar and offensive Starmie. Both Clefable and Blissey can provide cleric support for Rotom-A. All three provide a switch into Heatran, which greatly threaten Rotom-A with Flash Fire. Rotom-A is a possible choice on big 5 defensive archetypes over the typical Ground-type alongside Skarmory, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Clefable, defensive Latias, and Jirachi. Both offensive and defensive Jirachi sets work: offensive sets appreciate the Spikes and residual damage Rotom-A helps to wrack up, while defensive Jirachi helps shore the team against Dragon Dance sweepers such as Dragonite and Tyranitar that Rotom-A struggles with. Defensive Jirachi also enjoys foes worn down due to Will-O-Wisp and appreciates Rotom-A hitting Skarmory hard. Other bulky Steel-types such as Bronzong are great choices, especially for fully Spikes immune teams. Additionally, Hippowdon, Celebi, and defensive Gyarados can also make solid partners, as they further answer powerful sweepers and are effective with Spikes.</p> <p>Rotom-A’s defensive prowess make it a strong partner for more offensive Spikes based partners as well, as it has more resilience than more frail spinblockers such as Gengar and Choice Scarf Rotom-A. Alongside Swampert and Skarmory, Rotom-A does not have to worry about Tyranitar as much, as entry hazards wear Tyranitar down, while Swampert at least 2HKOes it. Both offensive and defensive Latias sets are fantastic partners for Rotom-A: Choice Specs Latias hammers Tyranitar and weakens it heavily so it can’t handle Rotom-A effectively, while defensive Latias’s resistances and bulk ease some of Rotom-A defensive responsibilities against attackers such as Gyarados and Breloom. Choice Scarf Lucario takes on revenge killing duty against attackers that can set up and OHKO Rotom-A, such as Lum Berry Dragon Dance Dragonite and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Mixed Flygon is an excellent partner, as it’s offensive prowess is greatly enhanced by Spikes and it enjoys Rotom-A switching into Steel-types such as Bronzong and offensive Jirachi and burning them. Empoleon is another excellent partner, as it spreads Knock Off and Rotom-A is immune or resists all of its weaknesses. It also helps against specially offensive Water-types such as Kingdra that Rotom-A cannot deal with. Tyranitar can take on a more offensive role, such as Choice Band to remove special walls or Starmie guaranteed or Dragon Dance to take advantage of Spikes wearing down its answers.</p> "

        "name": "Utility",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rotom-A can maximize its utility options by using Pain Split as its primary recovery option. Despite being unreliable, Rotom-A can easily heal on special walls like Clefable and Blissey due to its immunity to Seismic Toss. Substitute maximizes Pain Split and gives it more reliability. Substitute blocks status, making Clefable without Encore and Blissey complete set up bait. It also gives Rotom-A a free chance to burn Tyranitar and other Pursuit users such as Scizor.</p> <p>As Substitute limits Rotom-A’s offensive options, it can instead use a coverage move such as Shadow Ball, Hydro Pump, and Blizzard. Shadow Ball notably allows Rotom-A to damage opposing Rotom-A and Gengar, while Hydro Pump and Blizzard provide additional coverage. Hydro Pump hammers Heatran and Ground-types such as Hippowdon trying to phase out Substitute Rotom-A while Blizzard OHKOes Taunt Gliscor, Flygon, Breloom, and Dragonite trying to take advantage of it. Will-O-Wisp is perfect alongside Substitute or the coverage moves, as it burns Steel-types that otherwise wall Rotom-A and gives it an option to threaten Tyranitar. Thunderbolt allows it to KO Water-types and is it’s main offensive option with Substitute.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This specific EV spread aims to outspeed as much as possible so it can get a Substitute up, burn Gliscor before it can use Taunt, and then maximize its bulk. Rotom-A can minimize its HP and instead invest in Special Attack EVs to get as much health back as possible from Pain Split and power up it’s coverage moves, but since Rotom-A’s HP stat is low, it should otherwise aim to maximize HP to be as bulky as possible. Rotom-A generally tries to have a specific Speed stat and then invest the rest into bulk or Special Attack. Some common examples include 64 Speed EVs to outspeed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert; 164 Speed EVs to outspeed positive nature Tyranitar; 220 Speed EVs to outspeed Gyarados, Dragonite, and Breloom; and 188 Speed EVs with a Timid nature to outspeed Heatran, Adamant Lucario, and defensive Latias. As these are crowded speed tiers, it can be beneficial to invest a few more Speed EVs to outspeed the benchmark. When using not as much Speed EVs, it is recommended to use a Modest nature to maximize Rotom-A’s coverage options.</p> <p>Especially if it does not have Substitute, Rotom-A can use a few different items. Leftovers is the most prominent, as it allows Rotom-A to neutralize sand damage and make more Substitute. A more offensive option is to use Life Orb, as Rotom-A can heal with Pain Split and do a lot of damage, but watch out for foes trying to take advantage of Substitute. Without Substitute, some other options such as Colbur Berry to survive Pursuit Tyranitar and other Dark-type attacks, Custap Berry to get one last attack or Pain Split off, and Expert Belt to take advantage of its type coverage are all options.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-A should be cautious when it comes in and either lead or come in on resistance or immunities, as while it can mitigate residual damage with Pain Split, it isn’t bulky enough to stave off heavy damage. With Substitute, it should try to set up as soon as possible on something it forces out such as Skarmory or Gyarados. Take the opportunity to either heal up or spread Will-O-Wisp. Despite its prowess against special walls, it still can perform defensive roles such as block Rapid Spin from defensive Starmie and burn Steel-types. In the lead position, Rotom-A can use Will-O-Wisp and its coverage to take advantage of physical leads, but watch out for Tyranitar. More offensive versions of utility Rotom-A, especially without recovery or Leftovers, get worn down quickly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rotom-A fits on a wide variety of teams due to its unique typing and ability to block Rapid Spin. Utility Rotom-A is commonly featured alongside entry hazards and Pokemon that give it a free switch in on its immunities. A prominent example is Heatran, as Heatran’s Fighting- and Ground-type weaknesses give Rotom-A plenty of opportunities to switch in. Common Spikers alongside utility Rotom-A include Roserade and Skarmory. With Roserade and Heatran, Swampert forms a Fire-Water-Grass core while offensively checking Tyranitar. Another common Water-type with Heatran and Roserade is offensive Suicune, which appreciates Rotom-A taking advantage of special walls and spreading burns. Other checks to Tyranitar, such as Trick + Iron Ball Metagross or defensive Jirachi are appreciated. As these Fire-Water-Grass cores can struggle with multiple Dragon Dance sweepers, Choice Scarf Flygon or Hippowdon can be excellent partners. Alongside Skarmory, Pain Split gives Rotom-A more offensive coverage and Speed than with the defensive set. It spreads burns, staves off Clefable with Pain Split, and gives a switch into Fighting-types. Prominent partners include offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Choice Specs Latias, and Heatran. Choice Scarf Lucario can absorb Rotom-A’s revenge killing responsibilities.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-A is a critical member of the DPP OU metagame due to its unique Ghost / Electric typing, offensive utility, and defensive profile. Rotom-A is the most reliable spinblocker in the tier: its wide assortment of resistances, Levitate ability, and well-rounded stats make it the best choice to keep entry hazards up in the long term. These well-rounded stats allow Rotom-A to fulfill a wide variety of roles: an excellent revenge killer with Choice Scarf, a great defensive piece with RestTalk, and an effective offensive Pokemon with either Substitute or its assortment of coverage and utility moves. Rotom-A's solid speed tier, resilience to priority, and offensive presence makes it one of the best revenge killers in the metagame, as it can stop many set up sweepers such as Gyarados, Lucario, and Dragonite while potentially crippling a wall with Trick. Rotom-A is one of the best Will-O-Wisp users in the tier, as its bulk and resistances allow it to burn prominent attackers such as Tyranitar, Jirachi, Scizor, and Metagross. Rotom-A’s utility sets are notorious for being difficult to answer, as with its Speed, Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and great coverage, it is difficult to stop from fulfilling its role.</p> <p>The unique part of Rotom-A is its five different formes, which are all Ghost / Electric type in DPP. Rotom-M is a fine choice for a Rotom-A forme due to the unique utility of Leaf Storm. Leaf Storm provides an immediate OHKO on Swampert, something no other forme can do, while it also hits Tyranitar and Hippowdon very hard. Rotom-M is also relatively uncommon, meaning opponents are more likely to believe Rotom-M has Leaf Storm and, for example, preemptively switch the their Swampert out of offensive Rotom-A even if it does not have Leaf Storm. Being able to threaten both Tyranitar and Ground-types makes Rotom-M a good choice for a Rotom-A forme.</p> <p>Rotom-A’s primary flaws are its weakness to Pursuit, unreliable recovery, and lack of power. Tyranitar is the biggest menace, as although it doesn’t enjoy being burned, Rotom-A struggles to damage Tyranitar much at all due to the Special Defense boost in sand while it gets potentially OHKOed by Crunch or trapped via Pursuit. This vulnerability dampens its revenge killing prowess, as it can be easily removed by one of the most popular Pokemon in the metagame. Dark- and Ghost-type coverage in general is dangerous to Rotom-A, as Gengar OHKOes it and even threats it walls like Machamp and Lucario can hit it hard with Payback and Crunch, respectively. Rotom-A also lacks reliable recovery—RestTalk forces Rotom-A to either be walled easily or lack Will-O-Wisp and forces it to sleep for two turns, while Pain Split is easy to manipulate and struggles to keep Rotom-A healthy. Due to its lack of a generally strong attack, Rotom-A is easily checked by most special walls that can shrug off a burn, such as specially defensive Heatran, Clefable, Blissey, and even Breloom once Toxic Orb activates. Heatran is especially dangerous, as it gains a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes Rotom-A. While Rotom-A has good coverage due to its formes, it doesn’t get STAB on these special moves and often is short on moveslots.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rotom-A’s most prominent other set is Choice Specs, as it hits very hard especially with entry hazard support. It has become less common since it can’t 2HKO Clefable and struggles when locked into a bad move, however. As a frail attacker, it also struggles to differentiate itself from Gengar, who is faster, hits harder, and has many utility options to beat walls. Rotom-A can become a more dedicated sweeper with Charge Beam; especially behind a Substitute, it can get the attack boost on foes such as Clefable who struggle to break the Substitute and then use its coverage such as Hidden Power Fighting and Shadow Ball to sweep. Such sets often struggle to fit everything they want onto one set, however. Defensive Rotom-A has many other options in its last few slots, such as Reflect to better wall physical attacks without relying on Will-O-Wisp, Overheat to more immediately handle Scizor and Lucario, and Discharge to better spread paralysis and still handle Starmie and Skarmory. Rotom-A can also use Reflect and Light Screen to use a dedicated Dual Screens support set. Utility Rotom-A has some other interesting options such as Sucker Punch, Air Slash, Hidden Power Ground, Hidden Power Grass alongside Overheat, and Thunder Wave, but these often aren’t worth the moveslot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Tyranitar is the biggest threat to Rotom-A as, besides Will-O-Wisp, Hydro Pump, and Leaf Storm, its attacks do little even to bulkless Tyranitar. Tyranitar can then Pursuit trap Rotom-A or set up on it with Dragon Dance and KO it. other Dark-types such as Weavile and Spiritomb cannot switch in as easily but threaten it the same.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon: Rotom-A cannot hope to power through specially defensive Heatran, Blissey, and Clefable without multiple critical hits. Heatran is especially devastating, as it absorbs Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes back. Clefable’s Knock Off disables Trick and it can freely heal on almost any Rotom-A. All of these must be careful of Trick, while Heatran will eventually fall to Thunderbolt. Clefable and Blissey struggle to damage Substitute + Pain Split Rotom-A. While Latias is hit super effectively by Shadow Ball, it is bulky enough to withstand it and it easily survives Thunderbolt and other coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Camerupt, Flygon, Gliscor, Gastrodon, and Swampert disable the main way Rotom-A does damage: Thunderbolt. Especially if they have cleric support, Ground-types can mostly switch in repeatedly to Rotom-A and either attack, phase, or Taunt it. Camerupt is notably immune to both Will-O-Wisp and Thunderbolt and is bulky enough to survive Shadow Ball. However, all should be careful of Hydro Pump, Blizzard, or Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: While they cannot switch in, Gengar and opposing Rotom-A can hit Rotom-A hard with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: While Rotom-A is bulky, it is let down by its poor HP stat. As such, it is quite vulnerable to extremely powerful attackers OHKOing or heavily damaging it, such as Choice Specs Latias’s Draco Meteor, +1 Gyarados Waterfall, Dragonite’s boosted Outrage, and Heatran’s Fire-type attacks. Choice Specs Starmie is especially devastating if it OHKOes Rotom-A trying to block Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: While Rotom-A is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, it is still sand vulnerable and often strives to switch in using its resistances and immunities. If it takes a weak attack such as Starmie’s Surf or Forretress’s Payback, it can be forced to use Rest or unable to switch-in again. Choice Scarf and utility sets are even more vulnerable, as it cannot heal easily.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rotom-A’s Speed tier and good coverage make it an excellent revenge killer with a Choice Scarf. Thunderbolt is Rotom-A strongest attack, revenge killing Water-types such as Gyarados, Suicune, and Empoleon. Rotom-A has many different coverage options it can use. Overheat is a prominent one, as despite doing almost nothing to Pursuit Tyranitar, it is fantastic at revenge killing Steel-types who can shrug off a Thunderbolt such as Lucario without a Special Defense drop, Metagross, and especially Scizor. It also nails Grass-types such as Breloom, Roserade, and Shaymin. Another choice is Hydro Pump, which crucially 2HKOs bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and prevents it from being Pursuit trapped it Rotom-A hits it on the switch. It also hits Heatran trying to absorb Will-O-Wisp and Ground-types immune to Thunderbolt such as Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Camerupt. Leaf Storm OHKOes Swampert and Gastrodon while also dissuading Tyranitar from switching in.</p> <p>Shadow Ball completes Rotom-A’s coverage, as it prominently hits Latias, Gengar, and other Rotom-A while providing good neutral coverage should Rotom-A not use one of its forme moves. Hidden Power Ice is another excellent option, as it KOs Dragonite after Stealth Rock, OHKOes Flygon, and threatens Gliscor. Hidden Power Ice is both more reliable than Rotom-F’s Blizzard and does enough damage to its targets. Rounding out the set is Trick, as it is a fantastic way of crippling a special wall such as Clefable, Latias, and Blissey. Trick can also stop a boosted sweeper by locking them into one attack, although doing this often leads to sacrificing Rotom-A. Another option is Will-O-Wisp, which burns Tyranitar on the switch-in to survive a potential Pursuit trap attempt. As the only move Choice Scarf Rotom-A needs is Thunderbolt, it is free to mix and match as needed for its team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rotom-A generally should be running maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs, as it has 447 Speed after the Choice Scarf boost and sits at a crowded speed tier. Maximum Special Attack EVs notably give it the best chance to KO itself and 2HKO Latias with Shadow Ball, KO Wacan Berry Gyarados without Stealth Rock with Thunderbolt, 2HKO bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock with Hydro Pump, and KO Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock. However, Rotom-A can spare some HP EVs to better survive Tyranitar’s Pursuit, Scizor and Lucario’s boosted Bullet Punch, and Gyarados's +1 Waterfall. The fastest threat it needs to revenge kill besides itself is Modest Agility Empoleon, which requires 236 Speed EVs. Another choice is to drop down to 188 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Lucario and Heatran without the Choice Scarf. Rotom-A can also use less Special Attack EVs: it achieves the bulkless Dragonite KO after Stealth Rock with Hidden Power Ice with 160 Special Attack EVs. A common choice for bulkier Rotom-A spreads is to minimize sand damage with the desired Speed and put the rest in Special Attack: some example EV spreads would be 56 HP / 216 SpA / 236 Spe, which minimizes sand damage while maximizing the other stats, and 108 HP / 164 SpA / 236 Spe, which KOs Gyarados after Stealth Rock through Wacan Berry, survives +1 Waterfall after Stealth Rock, and still outspeeds +2 Modest Empoleon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A should switch in sparingly or on its immunities, as it is not very bulky, its choice locked moves are easy to set up on, and it is vulnerable to Pursuit. It enjoys switching in either when a foe such as Gyarados, Lucario, or Scizor sets up or after a KO to appropriately deal with the threat. This can be dangerous, however, as all of them can hit Rotom-A hard on the switch. Keeping Rotom-A hidden also can allow it to sweep late game against weakened threats should its checks be removed. This is especially prevalent against frail hyper offensive teams or those without a Ground-type. Rotom-A’s Trick is an excellent weapon to cripple walls and set up sweepers alike, but make sure Rotom-A’s Speed is no longer needed. Beware of opponents switching in another Choice Scarf Pokemon to nullify it or, worse, a Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Pursuit trapping Rotom-A. Another complication is with Knock Off: in DPP, if either the user or foe is hit with Knock Off, Trick will fail. Be careful with using Trick around Clefable and defensive Empoleon for this reason.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is a premier revenge killer in DPP OU and features on many team styles. Most midpaced offensive teams carry a Choice Scarf revenge killer to backstop them against set-up sweepers—Rotom-A is one of the best at it with its Speed, coverage, and Trick. As Rotom-A is easily covered by the special walls in the tier, it appreciates teammates that can break though them. Breloom and Heatran are fantastic choices, as Breloom takes advantage of Tyranitar, Blissey, Clefable, and Swampert while Heatran can trap them with Magma Storm and then burn Tyranitar, use Explosion on Blissey and Clefable, or OHKO Swampert with Hidden Power Grass. Breloom can also use Mach Punch or a bulky EV spread to revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another Tyranitar check, such as Machamp, bulky Metagross, and Jirachi are appreciated. Rotom-A also enjoys other strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Latias, Zapdos, and offensive Calm Mind Jirachi to weaken Tyranitar to the point it cannot switch into Rotom-A. Rotom-A appreciates threats that can set up on a choiced locked Pursuit: Lucario is an excellent choice, as is Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another excellent option is Torment Heatran, as it appreciates Rotom-A's Trick to set up on choiced locked Pokemon. As powerful choiced attackers such as Choice Band Gyarados, Choice Specs Heatran, Choice Band Tyranitar, and Choice Specs Zapdos can get set up on if they’re locked into the wrong move, Rotom-A can be a good stopgap.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is also fantastic on more frail hyper offenses as speed control and potentially a spinblocker for Spikes. Some prominent offensive partners include Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance or mixed Tyranitar, Dragon Dance or mixed Dragonite, Swords Dance or Agility Lucario, offensive Empoleon, offensive Calm Mind Suicune, and Swords Dance Scizor. These Pokemon can set up on a choiced locked Pursuit as well. Azelf is also an excellent choice to weaken Tyranitar with either paralysis or Explosion. Offensive Spikes Skarmory or Froslass are also good choices, as Choice Scarf Rotom-A can provide spinblocking and appreciates entry hazards wearing down its grounded answers.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rotom-A’s typing, ability, and bulk make it the best defensive spinblocker in the metagame. Rest and Sleep Talk are Rotom-A’s only form of recovery outside of Pain Split and prevent it from succumbing to status and residual damage. It also makes Rotom-A a reliable sleep absorber; however, without Shadow Ball, Rotom-A struggles to damage Breloom while getting 3HKOed by Seed Bomb. Rest also gives Rotom-A a massive stock of PP, making it useful for PP staling.</p> <p>Rotom-A’s most prominent attacking move is Thunderbolt, which OHKOing Gyarados. Thunderbolt also hits Steel-types such as Heatran, Metagross, Empoleon, and Scizor and at least 2HKOs Starmie and Skarmory. However, as Thunderbolt is useless against Ground-types and can’t hit Breloom well, another option is to use Shadow Ball. Shadow Ball prevents RestTalk Rotom-A from being completely unable to damage Taunt Gliscor while also hitting Ghost-weak targets such as Gengar, opposing Rotom-A, and Starmie hard. For the last slot, Rotom-A can either spread burns effectively with Will-O-Wisp or maintain better coverage with both Shadow Ball and Thunderbolt. Will-O-Wisp is preferred, as being able to burn opponents is one of Rotom-A’s core niches. It notably is the best response to Tyranitar, as it will not enjoy a burn unless it has a Lum Berry. Will-O-Wisp also limits switch ins to foes immune to burn damage such as Clefable, Heatran, Camerupt, and Breloom after Toxic Orb activates. Additionally, Natural Cure Pokemon such as Celebi and Blissey can pivot in on Will-O-Wisp. Another option for an Electric-type attack is Discharge, but it suffers from being noticably weaker than Thunderbolt and potentially giving unwanted paralysis.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rotom-A generally needs all of the physical bulk it can get to stave off Tyranitar, Metagross, Machamp, and Lucario. Take care that absolute maximum HP investment Rotom-A makes its HP stat divisible by 16, increasing the damage it takes from sand and heals from Leftovers. Rotom-A also is at a crowded speed tier—many Pokemon such as Empoleon, Tyranitar, Swampert, Machamp, and Breloom aim to outspeed minimum Speed Rotom-A. As such, it can invest 56 EVs to outspeed max Speed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert. Additionally, Rotom-A can add some Special Defense EVs to better handle special coverage from Swampert, survive Gengar’s Shadow Ball, and help prevent Starmie’s Rapid Spin; however, going with a fully specially defensive RestTalk Rotom-A is not advised due to its huge Pursuit weakness. A few Special Attack EVs, such as 20 EVs, also help Thunderbolt break maximum HP Breloom’s Substitute guaranteed and give better chances to OHKO Starmie and Skarmory.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-A should generally be used early to spread burns and block Rapid Spin, preferably before Breloom has activated its Toxic Orb. Rotom-A can lead, as it has good match ups against all common physical leads with the exception of Tyranitar and is immune to Explosion. Mastering the timing of when to use Rest with Rotom-A is critical, as it only has a 24.8% to burn physical attackers such as Tyranitar while asleep. Rotom-A should generally be careful about trying to block Rapid Spin too much, as offensive Starmie sets can OHKO Rotom-A with Hydro Pump while defensive Starmie and Forretress can 3HKO it in sand with Surf and Payback, respectively. Other than these, there are nuances with its usage depending on match up.</p> <p>Against offensive teams, Rotom-A is difficult to handle, as foes typically absorb burns with either Heatran, Refresh Swampert, Lum Berry Tyranitar, or Breloom. These teams also typically lack reliable Rapid Spin users, meaning Rotom-A can lean fully into its defensive roll and more recklessly wall opposing physical attackers and spread burns. As Heatran cannot absorb Rotom-A’s Thunderbolts forever, aggressively predicting it as it comes in can wear it down easily. Be careful against Metagross and Bronzong, as they can Trick Rotom-A an Iron Ball and ruin its ability to handle physical attackers with Earthquake. Despite being able to handle Gyarados, Rotom-A should not be the primary answer, as boosted Gyarados 2HKOs with Waterfall and can flinch Rotom-A—in addition, Gyarados survives Thunderbolt with a Wacan Berry even after Stealth Rock, meaning it can break through Rotom-A coming in on Dragon Dance. Rotom-A should be kept away from foes that can set up or otherwise take advantage of it, including sweepers with Lum Berry such as Dragon Dance Dragonite and Tyranitar; mixed attackers such as Dragonite, Flygon, and Swampert; Taunt users such as Gliscor; and faster Substitute users such as Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi and Breloom.</p> <p>Against more defensive teams, Rotom-A’s main value are its ability to block Rapid Spin, huge pool of PP, and handling problem Pokemon such as Skarmory, Breloom, physical Jirachi, and Starmie. Since Clefable is commonly the first switch into Rotom-A due to being immune to burn damage, absorbing its Knock Off with Rotom-A is one of the better ways to PP Stall it, as Clefable cannot threaten it outside of Calm Mind and Rotom-A will always be able to use Rest if sand is active. Once Rotom-A goes to sleep, not using Sleep Talk greatly increases how much PP Rotom-A has, to 108 if Rotom-A has Thunderbolt and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>RestTalk Rotom-A provides valuable defensive niches and spinblocking. On more defensive teams, it keeps entry hazards up and spreads burns. Spikes setters such as Skarmory and Forretress appreciate this, as neither can prevent Starmie, Donphan, or opposing Forretress from using Rapid Spin. Rotom-A prevents Machamp from spamming DynamicPunch, meaning prominent Fighting-weak walls such as Tyranitar, Clefable, and Blissey appreciate its presence. Clefable also spreads Knock Off for adding onto residual damage. Tyranitar provides sand and traps prominent Pokemon that threaten Rotom-A such as Gengar and offensive Starmie. Both Clefable and Blissey can provide cleric support for Rotom-A. All three provide a switch into Heatran, which greatly threaten Rotom-A with Flash Fire. Rotom-A is a possible choice on big 5 defensive archetypes over the typical Ground-type alongside Skarmory, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Clefable, defensive Latias, and Jirachi. Both offensive and defensive Jirachi sets work: offensive sets appreciate the Spikes and residual damage Rotom-A helps to wrack up, while defensive Jirachi helps shore the team against Dragon Dance sweepers such as Dragonite and Tyranitar that Rotom-A struggles with. Defensive Jirachi also enjoys foes worn down due to Will-O-Wisp and appreciates Rotom-A hitting Skarmory hard. Other bulky Steel-types such as Bronzong are great choices, especially for fully Spikes immune teams. Additionally, Hippowdon, Celebi, and defensive Gyarados can also make solid partners, as they further answer powerful sweepers and are effective with Spikes.</p> <p>Rotom-A’s defensive prowess make it a strong partner for more offensive Spikes based partners as well, as it has more resilience than more frail spinblockers such as Gengar and Choice Scarf Rotom-A. Alongside Swampert and Skarmory, Rotom-A does not have to worry about Tyranitar as much, as entry hazards wear Tyranitar down, while Swampert at least 2HKOes it. Both offensive and defensive Latias sets are fantastic partners for Rotom-A: Choice Specs Latias hammers Tyranitar and weakens it heavily so it can’t handle Rotom-A effectively, while defensive Latias’s resistances and bulk ease some of Rotom-A defensive responsibilities against attackers such as Gyarados and Breloom. Choice Scarf Lucario takes on revenge killing duty against attackers that can set up and OHKO Rotom-A, such as Lum Berry Dragon Dance Dragonite and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Mixed Flygon is an excellent partner, as it’s offensive prowess is greatly enhanced by Spikes and it enjoys Rotom-A switching into Steel-types such as Bronzong and offensive Jirachi and burning them. Empoleon is another excellent partner, as it spreads Knock Off and Rotom-A is immune or resists all of its weaknesses. It also helps against specially offensive Water-types such as Kingdra that Rotom-A cannot deal with. Tyranitar can take on a more offensive role, such as Choice Band to remove special walls or Starmie guaranteed or Dragon Dance to take advantage of Spikes wearing down its answers.</p> "

        "name": "Utility",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rotom-A can maximize its utility options by using Pain Split as its primary recovery option. Despite being unreliable, Rotom-A can easily heal on special walls like Clefable and Blissey due to its immunity to Seismic Toss. Substitute maximizes Pain Split and gives it more reliability. Substitute blocks status, making Clefable without Encore and Blissey complete set up bait. It also gives Rotom-A a free chance to burn Tyranitar and other Pursuit users such as Scizor.</p> <p>As Substitute limits Rotom-A’s offensive options, it can instead use a coverage move such as Shadow Ball, Hydro Pump, and Blizzard. Shadow Ball notably allows Rotom-A to damage opposing Rotom-A and Gengar, while Hydro Pump and Blizzard provide additional coverage. Hydro Pump hammers Heatran and Ground-types such as Hippowdon trying to phase out Substitute Rotom-A while Blizzard OHKOes Taunt Gliscor, Flygon, Breloom, and Dragonite trying to take advantage of it. Will-O-Wisp is perfect alongside Substitute or the coverage moves, as it burns Steel-types that otherwise wall Rotom-A and gives it an option to threaten Tyranitar. Thunderbolt allows it to KO Water-types and is it’s main offensive option with Substitute.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This specific EV spread aims to outspeed as much as possible so it can get a Substitute up, burn Gliscor before it can use Taunt, and then maximize its bulk. Rotom-A can minimize its HP and instead invest in Special Attack EVs to get as much health back as possible from Pain Split and power up it’s coverage moves, but since Rotom-A’s HP stat is low, it should otherwise aim to maximize HP to be as bulky as possible. Rotom-A generally tries to have a specific Speed stat and then invest the rest into bulk or Special Attack. Some common examples include 64 Speed EVs to outspeed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert; 164 Speed EVs to outspeed positive nature Tyranitar; 220 Speed EVs to outspeed Gyarados, Dragonite, and Breloom; and 188 Speed EVs with a Timid nature to outspeed Heatran, Adamant Lucario, and defensive Latias. As these are crowded speed tiers, it can be beneficial to invest a few more Speed EVs to outspeed the benchmark. When using not as much Speed EVs, it is recommended to use a Modest nature to maximize Rotom-A’s coverage options.</p> <p>Especially if it does not have Substitute, Rotom-A can use a few different items. Leftovers is the most prominent, as it allows Rotom-A to neutralize sand damage and make more Substitute. A more offensive option is to use Life Orb, as Rotom-A can heal with Pain Split and do a lot of damage, but watch out for foes trying to take advantage of Substitute. Without Substitute, some other options such as Colbur Berry to survive Pursuit Tyranitar and other Dark-type attacks, Custap Berry to get one last attack or Pain Split off, and Expert Belt to take advantage of its type coverage are all options.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-A should be cautious when it comes in and either lead or come in on resistance or immunities, as while it can mitigate residual damage with Pain Split, it isn’t bulky enough to stave off heavy damage. With Substitute, it should try to set up as soon as possible on something it forces out such as Skarmory or Gyarados. Take the opportunity to either heal up or spread Will-O-Wisp. Despite its prowess against special walls, it still can perform defensive roles such as block Rapid Spin from defensive Starmie and burn Steel-types. In the lead position, Rotom-A can use Will-O-Wisp and its coverage to take advantage of physical leads, but watch out for Tyranitar. More offensive versions of utility Rotom-A, especially without recovery or Leftovers, get worn down quickly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rotom-A fits on a wide variety of teams due to its unique typing and ability to block Rapid Spin. Utility Rotom-A is commonly featured alongside entry hazards and Pokemon that give it a free switch in on its immunities. A prominent example is Heatran, as Heatran’s Fighting- and Ground-type weaknesses give Rotom-A plenty of opportunities to switch in. Common Spikers alongside utility Rotom-A include Roserade and Skarmory. With Roserade and Heatran, Swampert forms a Fire-Water-Grass core while offensively checking Tyranitar. Another common Water-type with Heatran and Roserade is offensive Suicune, which appreciates Rotom-A taking advantage of special walls and spreading burns. Other checks to Tyranitar, such as Trick + Iron Ball Metagross or defensive Jirachi are appreciated. As these Fire-Water-Grass cores can struggle with multiple Dragon Dance sweepers, Choice Scarf Flygon or Hippowdon can be excellent partners. Alongside Skarmory, Pain Split gives Rotom-A more offensive coverage and Speed than with the defensive set. It spreads burns, staves off Clefable with Pain Split, and gives a switch into Fighting-types. Prominent partners include offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Choice Specs Latias, and Heatran. Choice Scarf Lucario can absorb Rotom-A’s revenge killing responsibilities.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>At first glance, it may seem unwise to use Venusaur over Roserade, who has higher speed, better Special Attack, and the ability to set up Toxic Spikes. However, Venusaur has a few unique tricks up its sleeves which allow it to function well in OU. Venusaur is much bulkier than Roserade, allowing it to take hits which Roserade isn't able to. Venusaur also has access to Swords Dance and Power Whip, turning it into a frightening sweeper. Other Grass-types such as Shaymin and Celebi don't outclass Venusaur either, because Venusaur's Poison typing allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes, allowing teammates to switch in without being crippled by poison. Venusaur has its own niche, which allows it to function well in OU, but don't go slapping it on every team and expecting it to be wonderful.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Venusaur does not have many viable options in OU. Growth can be used to boost Venusaur's Special Attack, and with a set of Grass Knot, Sludge Bomb, and Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ground, Venusaur should not be taken lightly. Hidden Power Ice is another option, hitting Zapdos, Dragonite, and Grass-types hard. Light Screen can be used to lower the damage output of special attacks that are directed at your team. Roar isn't a bad option either, allowing Venusaur to phaze threats that try to set up on it. Finally, Toxic can be used to cripple a bulky wall, preventing them from doing their job.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Though Venusaur has quite a few counters that can dispose of it, all checks and counters must beware of a potential Sleep Powder, which could severely cripple them. For that reason, it would be wise to switch in a status absorber to take the Sleep Powder before switching to your counter. Once sleep clause has been activated, Venusaur becomes much easier to counter, as there are a number of Pokemon who resists Venusaur typical attacking options. Skarmory is without a doubt the best counter to physical sets. Even boosted Power Whips don't bother it thanks to its typing, which 4x resists Grass-type attacks. It is also immune to Earthquake, meaning that there is nothing Venusaur can do to hurt Skarmory. In return, Skarmory can easily set up Spikes on Venusaur, smash it with Brave Bird, or phaze it with Whirlwind. Zapdos can switch into Venusaur and either set up a Substitute or fire off a powerful Heat Wave. Dragonite is also not weak to any of Venusaur's attacks, and can blast Venusaur away with Outrage. Note that Venusaur may carry Hidden Power Ice on some special sets, but it's never strong enough to OHKO Dragonite. Choice Scarf Heatran can switch in on anything but a Ground-type attack and threaten Fire Blast, much the same way as Infernape. Celebi is a solid response to all Venusaur as well, since it's immune to Leech Seed, resists Grass- and Ground-type attacks, and can hurt Venusaur with STAB super effective Psychic.</p> ",

        "name": "Leech Seed",
        "description": "<p>Venusaur can perform excellently as a Leech Seed abuser, thanks to its great bulk coupled with the ability to incapacitate a counter or check with Sleep Powder. Leech Seed provides Venusaur with some form of recovery, while weakening the opposing Pokemon at the same time. Leaf Storm offers a powerful STAB move that hits many Pokemon hard, but lowers its Special Attack after every use. Grass Knot is a great alternative, still hitting quite hard thanks to many top Pokemon that reside in the tier being very heavy. Hidden Power Fire allows Venusaur to hit Steel-types that would otherwise wall this set, such as Scizor. Since Scizor is one of the most common switch-ins to Venusaur, and can also not get harmed by Leech Seed thanks to U-turn, it can easily switch in and hit Venusaur hard or allow the opposing team to gain momentum. Sludge Bomb can be used instead of Hidden Power Fire for a secondary STAB move, but Venusaur loses out on the ability to hit Steel-types.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ground is an option in the last slot to hit Heatran. If it is used, Timid along with 252 Speed EVs should be used to outspeed Heatran, and be able to nail it with Hidden Power Ground. Note that a lot of bulk will be sacrificed if Venusaur is to run maximum Speed. Synthesis can be used over Leech Seed, as it offers more recovery. Unfortunately, sandstorm is a common effect in the metagame, and very often, Venusaur will only be healing a meager 25% health. The EVs are tailored to give Venusaur a lot of special bulk, while still being able to outspeed 0 Speed Rotom-A. The 24 Special Attack EVs allow Venusaur to break Gengar's Substitute with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>Unless Hidden Power Ground is used, Heatran is a great counter to Venusaur that can switch in on anything but Sleep Powder and force it out with a STAB Fire-type attack. Infernape functions similarly, and is able to outspeed all Venusaur and take it out with Fire Blast. Bulky Gyarados is a solid teammate to counter the aforementioned threats since he can take Fire Blast easily and take the typical coverage moves well. Gyarados can force both of them out, and use Dragon Dance on the switch.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Venusaur can effectively run a Swords Dance set that is not outclassed by other Grass-types due to solid attacking options and access to Sleep Powder. Sleep Powder allows Venusaur to incapacitate a check or counter that switches in, while having an awesome STAB attack like Power Whip and good coverage in Earthquake practically makes this set worth running. Once set up against the omnipresent Swampert, Suicune, Vaporeon, or sleeping check, Venusaur can fire off powerful attacks backed by 526 Attack and Life Orb.</p> <p>The below calculations show how powerful Venusaur is after a single Swords Dance.</p> <ul> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 252/252+ Blissey: 94.7% - 111.5% <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 252/252+ Hippowdon: 114.3% - 134.8%</li> <li>+1 Life Orb Power Whip vs 248/252+ Gyarados: 59.5% - 70.2%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 252/252+ Rotom-A: 84.2% - 99.7%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 252/4 Gliscor: 86.4% - 102%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 12/0 Breloom: 85.2% - 100%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 0/0 Gengar: 107.3% - 126.4%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 240/0 Machamp: 118.1% - 138.8%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 4/0 Celebi / Shaymin: 54.4% - 64%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 248/228+ Zapdos: 39.9% - 47%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 248/0 Zapdos: 55.6% - 65.8%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Earthquake vs 248/0 Scizor: 60.6% - 71.1%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Earthquake vs 252/224+ Jirachi: 75.7% - 89.1%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Earthquake vs 0/0 Jirachi: 122% - 143.7%</li> </ul> <p>Occa Berry is an option over Life Orb so that Venusaur can take a Fire-type move from the likes of Choice Scarf Heatran and OHKO back. Venusaur outspeeds non-Choice Scarf Heatran and Adamant Lucario, allowing Venusaur to nail them both with Earthquake before either of them can attack. Sludge Bomb can be used over Sleep Powder to 2HKO Shaymin and Celebi and OHKO Breloom even with a Jolly nature. Return can be used to hit Dragonite, Zapdos, and other Grass-types for more damage. The EV spread is a standard offensive spread, maximizing Attack and Speed so Venusaur can hit harder and outspeed as many foes as possible. The remaining 4 EVs are put into HP because you might as well to boost Venusaur's bulk slightly.</p> <p>Most Pokemon will take a lot of damage from a boosted Power Whip, even if resisted. Celebi is probably the best check to this Venusaur, since it resists both Power Whip and Earthquake and can remove sleep if necessary thanks to Natural Cure. Celebi can also pack STAB Psychic and Recover to deal with Venusaur and keep itself healthy. Since Celebi and Skarmory are both problematic Pokemon for this set, Choice Scarf Scizor and Magnezone are nice choices to bring along. With a Choice Scarf, Scizor can easily switch into Psychic without fear of Hidden Power Fire on the next turn and U-turn to destroy Celebi or keep up momentum. A Magnezone of your own can also be used to take out opposing Skarmory so that Venusaur can more easily attempt its sweep.</p> "

  "Nidoqueen": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoqueen has found a home in OU as a surprisingly versatile Pokemon. It's a great fit on stall builds with access to both Stealth Rock and, notably, Toxic Spikes. With key resistances to Rock- and Fighting-type attacks through its Poison / Ground typing, Nidoqueen is a great defensive check to Pokemon like Breloom, Lucario, Tyranitar, and sometimes even Infernape. Over time, Nidoqueen has proven to fit very well on balanced builds and even offense, clearing Toxic Spikes on entry and setting up its own entry hazards to support its offensive teammates. Defensive Pokemon can sometimes find themselves irritated by Nidoqueen, as its typing grants it an immunity to both Thunder Wave and Toxic. On top of that, its movepool is quite vast, so it can be molded to suit a team's needs very often.</p> <p>However, Nidoqueen's biggest weakness is its lack of reliable healing, meaning it gets chipped down really easily by a myriad of offensive threats and even defensive ones as well. Its base stats are underwhelming for OU, with decent defenses at best and subpar Attack, Special Attack, and Speed. While it is a great fit on stall builds, it can also be a detriment by being setup fodder for Spikes users like Skarmory and Roserade as well as setup sweepers like Calm Mind Suicune, Calm Mind Clefable, and Dragon Dance Gyarados if it doesn't have the right moveset.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Nidoqueen's movepool is shockingly diverse, so it can employ some interesting strategies. Pursuit can be used to trap Choice Scarf Rotom-A that's locked into Thunderbolt for a decent amount of damage. Crunch can be used as a surprise move versus a Rotom-A that is locked into Shadow Ball and even to devastate Gengar, but this move is not recommended over other options, and Nidoqueen still has to beware of Will-O-Wisp. Taunt can be used if Nidoqueen is faster than Skarmory to prevent it from setting up entry hazards. Super Fang is an option for consistent damage output versus bulkier Pokemon. Because Nidoqueen has decent HP and good physical bulk, it could potentially use Counter to surprise Pokemon like Choice Band Tyranitar and Gliscor, but this is a very gimmicky strategy. Icy Wind could be used in place of Ice Beam to slow down threats like mixed Dragonite, but the loss of power and chance to freeze is discouraging. Nidoqueen also has access to Rain Dance and Sunny Day and could potentially be a good hazard stacking weather supporter, but those types of teams generally do not need Toxic Spikes, and other Pokemon do it better. Whirlpool is an option to trap something that greedily stays in, like Clefable or Blissey that want to heal, which could allow Nidoqueen to stack entry hazards, but this is likely a waste of a moveslot. Nidoqueen can use Passho Berry on the Thunderbolt set, which makes it more effective versus Gyarados, a common target of the set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types are Nidoqueen's worst enemy. Kingdra, Starmie, Swampert, and Suicune work best, as these Pokemon shrug off Nidoqueen's attacks with ease. Kingdra has decent defenses, so it won't mind an Earthquake too much and can set up Dragon Dance or Rain Dance as well as threaten Nidoqueen with its STAB Water-type attacks. If Kingdra uses Rest or even has Lum Berry, it can enter on Toxic Spikes. Starmie can spin away Nidoqueen's entry hazards and likely OHKO the physically defensive variant. Suicune can set up Substitute or Calm Mind on Nidoqueen and takes little damage from Earthquake. Swampert can threaten Nidoqueen with its STAB moves and set up Stealth Rock. Empoleon and Gyarados also do quite well versus Nidoqueen, but Empoleon needs to beware of Earthquake, and Gyarados will usually do amazingly versus Nidoqueen but needs to watch out for the very rare Thunderbolt variant.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-type Pokemon like Hippowdon and Mamoswine will typically do well versus Nidoqueen and threaten it with STAB Earthquake. Flygon and Gliscor do excellently versus Nidoqueen without Ice Beam, especially with their Ground immunity, which allows them to be immune to Toxic Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types like Celebi and Shaymin resist Earthquake, do not take much from Ice Beam, are able to cure poison via Natural Cure, and threaten Nidoqueen with strong special attacks like Seed Flare, Earth Power, Psychic, and even Hidden Power Ice. Roserade and Venusaur can threaten Nidoqueen with Sleep Powder and strong special attacks, and both can remove Toxic Spikes on entry. Venusaur has more natural bulk than Roserade, so it likely won't mind an Earthquake, but Roserade has to be careful, as it is not likely to survive more than two Earthquakes unless it has significant defensive investment. Still, Nidoqueen has to be careful when matched up versus Roserade, which can sometimes use it to set up its Spikes and even Toxic Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Since physically defensive Nidoqueen is the most common variant, special attackers like Gengar, Rotom-A, Heatran, Jirachi, and Dragonite can deal a tremendous amount of damage to Nidoqueen, although the latter three must watch out for super effective attacks like Earthquake and Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon: Pokemon that are immune to Nidoqueen's STAB Earthquake will typically do very well versus it, provided that Nidoqueen's fourth move does not hit them super effectively. Even though Zapdos can be walled by Nidoqueen, Hidden Power Ice will still chip it reasonably well, likely 2HKOing it if the Zapdos is offensive, but the specially defensive Nidoqueen can still use the less powerful variants of Zapdos to set up entry hazards. Without Ice Beam, Dragonite, Flygon, and Gliscor do exceptionally well versus Nidoqueen. Without Flamethrower or Thunderbolt, Skarmory does amazingly versus Nidoqueen and can set up its entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Pokemon like Scizor and Gyarados can use Nidoqueen to set up Swords Dance or Dragon Dance, but they must beware of Flamethrower and the rarer Thunderbolt variants.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp Users: Will-O-Wisp users like Gengar, Rotom-A, and Heatran can cripple Nidoqueen with a burn, which prevents it from recovering with Black Sludge and reduces the power of its Earthquake by half.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users like Aerodactyl, Azelf, Gengar, and Skarmory can stop Nidoqueen from setting up its entry hazards and support other teammates in taking advantage of Nidoqueen's lack of power. In particular, Azelf takes negligible damage from anything Nidoqueen uses, can set up Stealth Rock or even Nasty Plot, and can take Nidoqueen out with Explosion if it doesn't have a Psychic-type attack with which to OHKO Nidoqueen.</p> ",
    "sets": [

        "name": "Physically Defensive Toxic Spikes",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Toxic Spikes is Nidoqueen's niche, as it is one of the most consistent and bulky users of the move in OU, so it's a mandatory moveslot. Although it can use Stealth Rock instead of Protect, Nidoqueen prefers the latter to take advantage of potential sand, receive additional Black Sludge recovery to make up for its lack of a recovery move of its own outside of Rest, and scout Choice item users like Flygon and Jirachi. Protect can also be used in conjunction with Toxic Spikes to wear down opposing Pokemon with residual poison damage. However, often teams that use Nidoqueen will want it to use both entry hazards, so using Stealth Rock over Protect will be mandatory if nothing else on the team can better use Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Earthquake is Nidoqueen's strongest STAB move, hitting Pokemon like Tyranitar, Heatran, and even Jirachi quite hard. Earth Power is an option over Earthquake to hit Metagross harder that also allows Nidoqueen to use a Bold nature instead, but if using Earth Power, Nidoqueen should use Flamethrower or Thunderbolt to take advantage of being faster than most Skarmory. Nidoqueen can also use Roar over a Ground-type move on a set that has Toxic Spikes, Ice Beam, and Protect, but this is only recommended on full stall builds.</p> <p>The fourth move is quite flexible, but Ice Beam is the most recommended to give Nidoqueen leverage against Pokemon like Gliscor, Dragonite, Flygon, and Breloom all at once. Flamethrower is a solid option for Skarmory, Forretress, and Scizor, particularly the Swords Dance variant of the latter. Fire Blast could be used for its increased power, but this will likely be more unreliable versus Skarmory and Scizor because of its low PP and chance to miss; the extra damage output is typically not worth it because Fire Blast can likely still be stalled out with Roost from specially defensive Skarmory. Furthermore, since Flamethrower has more PP, Nidoqueen overall will have a higher chance to inflict a burn or get a critical hit. Thunderbolt can be used if a team has trouble with Gyarados and does not want to give it any initiative, but this move will not OHKO it unless it takes damage from Stealth Rock and two turns of sand or one turn of Life Orb damage; Thunderbolt hits Skarmory as well. The issue with Thunderbolt, however, is that ultimately it is inferior to Ice Beam or Flamethrower because it makes Nidoqueen unable to check Breloom.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>HP and Defense are maximized so Nidoqueen can take physical attacks from the likes of Dragonite, Tyranitar, Infernape, and Lucario as well as possible. Black Sludge is used to give Nidoqueen passive recovery and can be nice for punishing Trick users like Jirachi, Latias, and Rotom-A. A Relaxed nature is recommended because Nidoqueen is typically a mixed attacker.</p> <p>Nidoqueen can opt for a Bold nature if using Earth Power, which allows it to outspeed most Skarmory. However, this is only recommended if opting for Flamethrower or Thunderbolt to damage Skarmory. While Nidoqueen is not a good Skarmory check even with these moves, as they likely will do less than 50% to it, they do prevent it from being able to freely set up on Nidoqueen with little to no consequence, which is the case if opting for Ice Beam.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>You need to be somewhat careful when using Nidoqueen because one of its biggest weaknesses is that it can be chipped down easily, so try to use its Poison / Ground typing to your advantage by pivoting it into attacks or status moves it's immune to. Also, identifying Pokemon with Choice items will make it easier to get Nidoqueen on the battlefield, as its many resistances can help it take advantage of bad locks. When considering which entry hazard to use first, usually Stealth Rock is the most important one, as no matter what comes in, something will take damage. Identify the type of team you are facing before laying down two layers of Toxic Spikes, as more offensive teams will actually be crippled more by only one layer. This is because they need to stay in for a few turns to take more damage from two layers of Toxic Spikes than just one. If you know that your opponent is using Starmie, you can try to bait it out and double switch to a counter; this is especially effective if you use a Pursuit trapper like Tyranitar or Weavile. Try to take advantage of Nidoqueen's Poison Point by sending it in on Pokemon that spam U-turn and other physical attacks, provided that it will take minimal damage in the process. For example, because Nidoqueen can threaten Breloom with Ice Beam, you can force Breloom to use Spore, which ideally Breloom wants to delay for as long as possible. Even while Nidoqueen is asleep, you can still pivot it into U-turn users to threaten Pokemon with Poison Point, switch it into Trick and give away a Black Sludge, and also clear Toxic Spikes from your side of the field. If you opt for a rarer move like Flamethrower or Thunderbolt, try your best to keep it concealed until necessary to reveal it so you may surprise your opponent. If you are using a Pokemon with Wish support alongside Nidoqueen or you opt for Protect over Stealth Rock, you can afford to be a bit more lenient with conserving its health, which can be incredibly rewarding because it can result in more pressure with entry hazards and certain offenses having a harder time breaking it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Nidoqueen appreciates teammates that can handle Water-types, Skarmory, and strong special attackers well. Ghost-type Pokemon like Gengar and Rotom-A are naturally a great fit with Nidoqueen, as they function as secondary Fighting-type checks and spinblockers for all of Nidoqueen's entry hazards. Rotom-A is better versus Starmie than Gengar, but the Choice Scarf variants of each can outspeed Starmie and OHKO it with their STAB moves. Choice Scarf Rotom-A is a great countermeasure to Dragon Dance Gyarados, which also benefits Nidoqueen. Tyranitar can do well versus Water-types and strong special attackers with its incredible special bulk and Passho Berry, and it can consistently trap Starmie, which assists with Nidoqueen's entry hazards. Tyranitar's Sand Stream also assists Nidoqueen with wearing down its foes and restoring its passive recovery in case it faces a hail-inducing Pokemon like Abomasnow. Weavile is also a wonderful partner for Nidoqueen on more offensive builds, as the two have good type synergy. Nidoqueen also removes opposing Toxic Spikes from the field on entry, and Weavile can trap Starmie with Pursuit, forcing it into a mind game by also packing Night Slash. Magnezone can trap Skarmory and other troubling Steel-types like Bronzong and Choice Scarf Jirachi while doing decently versus Water-types, but this compounds a a Ground-type weakness, and a backup plan should be in store for Shed Shell Skarmory.</p> <p>Since Nidoqueen does amazingly versus Breloom, which can often be the bane of a stall build's existence, Skarmory and Latias fit well to stop Breloom after Nidoqueen forces it to use Spore. Skarmory itself has great type synergy with Nidoqueen and can assist in setting up entry hazards as well as soft check threats like Dragon Dance Gyarados and Flygon. Bulkier variants of Latias can soft check Gyarados. Nidoqueen and Latias form a strong core of Fighting-resistant Pokemon. Latias can also switch into Ground-, Water-, and Psychic-type attacks aimed at Nidoqueen. A Calm Mind + Roar set can be used in conjunction with Toxic Spikes to spread poison.</p> <p>Blissey and Clefable are great special walls that have good type synergy with Nidoqueen and can also handle all the special attacking Water-types. Milotic can also handle most Water-types, has great special bulk, and does particularly well versus Gyarados, which Nidoqueen detests. On top of that, Nidoqueen clears Toxic Spikes for Milotic, which can be a nuisance. Many other bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, some Kingdra, and Swampert pair well with Nidoqueen because they appreciate the removal of Toxic Spikes. In fact, the CroCune variant of Suicune both appreciates Nidoqueen removing Toxic Spikes and setting up its own against the opposing team. Blissey, Clefable, Latias, and Jirachi with Wish can also support Nidoqueen well. Specially defensive Empoleon makes for a good teammate that can use Stealth Rock and allow Nidoqueen to use Protect, but you should beware of the compounded Ground-type weakness.</p> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Toxic Spikes support are also great teammates for Nidoqueen. Protect users like Torment Heatran, Calm Mind Raikou, and Leech Seed Shaymin can take advantage of Toxic Spikes. Heatran can do well versus Steel-types that give Nidoqueen some trouble, and Shaymin can do well versus Water-types. Celebi is another Grass-type that defensively synergizes well with Nidoqueen and can do decently versus Choice Band Gyarados and other Water-types; however, while Celebi brushes off Water- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Nidoqueen, and Nidoqueen takes Bug-type attacks like U-turn aimed at Celebi, they are both weak to Ice, so this should be considered when pairing the two together. Zapdos can add to a stall build and use a set like Substitute + Roost or even a Protect set to take advantage of Nidoqueen's Toxic Spikes.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Specially Defensive Toxic Spikes",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This set uses Special Defense investment to do better against certain threats like mixed Dragonite, Heatran, Infernape, Gengar, Rotom-A, and Zapdos. Toxic Spikes is a staple to Nidoqueen's niche in OU. While Protect is preferred, Stealth Rock will be mandatory for many teams that use Nidoqueen if nothing else can better fit the move.</p> <p>Earthquake is Nidoqueen's preferred STAB attack for doing solid damage against Tyranitar and Heatran. Nidoqueen can also use Earth Power for more damage against Metagross and for a bit more Speed, but this is less recommended because Flamethrower and Thunderbolt aren't nearly as effective without Defense investment, and you'd also sacrifice Nidoqueen's damage output versus Infernape. This means that Nidoqueen has no move to pressure Skarmory, so the increased Speed isn't worth replacing Earthquake.</p> <p>Ice Beam is the best option for the last moveslot because it takes advantage of Nidoqueen's heightened Special Defense by threatening mixed Dragonite and pressuring Zapdos into using Roost, allowing Nidoqueen to hit it harder with Earthquake. It also allows Nidoqueen to still do decently versus Breloom, hitting it super effectively.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>HP and Special Defense are maximized to make Nidoqueen as specially bulky as possible, which allows it to stand a chance versus mixed Dragonite and Gengar. On top of that, it allows Nidoqueen to reliably set up entry hazards on bulkier variants of Zapdos and Rotom-A that don't carry Will-O-Wisp as well. Interestingly, specially defensive Nidoqueen can more reliably cripple Trick Rotom-A with Black Sludge because it has an easier time entering in on Shadow Ball or even Hidden Power Ice from Choice Scarf variants, but it must beware of Choice Specs sets. Also, the passive recovery from Black Sludge can be taken advantage of even further by opting for Protect.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Even though this Nidoqueen does decently versus mixed Dragonite, Gengar, Heatran, Rotom-A, and Zapdos, it must be careful when trying to match up versus all of those Pokemon. Nidoqueen only deals with mixed Dragonite reliably when it is at full health, and it needs to be at a reasonably high amount of health to come in on Gengar and at least guarantee that SubSplit variants don't maintain their Substitute. In terms of its health, the same can apply with the other aforementioned special attackers. Coming in on moves it's immune to will be very beneficial to this Nidoqueen. Be sure to evaluate whether one or two layers of Toxic Spikes should be used, and try to prioritize Stealth Rock. If needed, this Nidoqueen can sometimes stay in once versus Leftovers Starmie to hit it with an Earthquake and pressure it a bit more, but this usually isn't recommended. Even though Nidoqueen lacks investment in Defense, it can still take advantage of Poison Point, as it still takes Infernape's Close Combat decently and resists U-turn.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Beyond the fact that Nidoqueen appreciates teammates that do well versus Water-types and Skarmory, Pokemon with more Defense investment will pair slightly better with specially defensive Nidoqueen, as it loses a large portion of its physically defensive value. Physically defensive Skarmory has great synergy with specially defensive Nidoqueen, and this core can be difficult to break. Because specially defensive Nidoqueen tends to check its foes much more effectively at higher health, Wish support is extremely helpful. Blissey, Clefable, Jirachi, and Vaporeon can effectively pass Wish to Nidoqueen, and the physically bulky Wish + Calm Mind variant of Jirachi has particularly nice synergy with specially defensive Nidoqueen.</p> <p>Suicune and other bulky Water-types like Milotic, Kingdra, and Swampert appreciate Nidoqueen's support. Physically defensive Zapdos can sometimes dislike mixed Dragonite, so this combined with the natural synergy this Nidoqueen has with physically defensive Zapdos makes these two a fantastic pair. Bulkier Starmie, especially with Reflect, can pair well with this Nidoqueen, spinning away Spikes and setting up Reflect for Nidoqueen while Zapdos is handled naturally by Nidoqueen. Celebi appreciates the Toxic Spikes removal that Nidoqueen provides, and physically defensive variants have even better synergy with this Nidoqueen, taking Water- and Ground-type attacks aimed at it while it takes Bug-type attacks like U-turn; however, an Ice-type weakness will be compounded when pairing these two together.</p> <p>Tyranitar combined with this Nidoqueen can give many special attackers a hard time, but there should be reassurance versus Water-types, whether it be through a Passho Berry Tyranitar variant or with a Grass-type like Leech Seed Shaymin or Celebi. This Nidoqueen is still countered by Starmie, most variants of which Tyranitar will consistently trap. Tyranitar's Sand Stream also helps wear down opposing Pokemon. Weavile can also work effectively with specially defensive Nidoqueen, which effectively combats Heatran; in return, Weavile's Pursuit will be greatly beneficial to Nidoqueen, and the removal of Toxic Spikes will increase its longevity. Magnezone can pair well to trap Skarmory, but it must beware of Shed Shell and a compounded Ground-type weakness. Ghost-type Pokemon like Gengar and Rotom-A function as secondary Fighting-type answers and spinblockers for all of Nidoqueen's entry hazards; physically defensive Rotom-A synergizes especially well with specially defensive Nidoqueen. Anything that appreciates Toxic Spikes support, such as Protect users like Leech Seed Shaymin, Calm Mind Raikou, and Heatran, will pair well with Nidoqueen.</p> "

  "Clefable": {
    "overview": "<p>Clefable’s powerful ability, Magic Guard, makes it an incredibly attractive option, rendering it immune to entry hazards, any residual damage, and even paralysis. Although Blissey, a similar Pokemon, has greater bulk, Clefable still has very good Special Defense, which is high enough to check almost all special attackers in the tier like Empoleon, Heatran, Choice Scarf Rotom-A, Starmie, Suicune, and Zapdos. In addition, compared to Blissey, Clefable has some additional support moves like Knock Off and Encore.</p> <p>That said, Clefable still has a few weaknesses that can be exploited; namely, it is a passive Pokemon. Offensive momentum can overwhelm Clefable, and while its physical bulk is not awful by any means, many physical attackers are more than capable of getting rid of Clefable in one to two hits. Clefable is also vulnerable to setup sweepers with Lum Berry as well as Taunt users. Regardless of these flaws, Clefable fits onto a wide variety of teams, boasting a larger versatility than meets the eye.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Like many other Normal-type Pokemon, Clefable has an astronomical movepool. Because of this versatility, it can perform many different unique roles. A Trick + Flame Orb set can be used to punish a physical attacker that comes in. Sing can be used to put opposing setup sweepers or entry hazard stackers to sleep. Clefable also makes for an effective cleric with Heal Bell. Another solid option on the support set is Reflect, which can combat Choice Band Tyranitar and other physical attackers simultaneously. Finally, Clefable can opt for Mail over Leftovers on certain sets like the Calm Mind set if there is a significant desire to be immune to Trick, but this is not generally recommended over the vast utility that Leftovers provides.</p> <p>On the more gimmicky side, Cosmic Power can be used on a set with Toxic, Seismic Toss, and Soft-Boiled to whittle down opposing Pokemon while becoming an absolute tank, but this needs the support of a Pursuit user that can reliably trap Gengar. Also, Cosmic Power can be used alongside Charge Beam, Ice Beam, and Soft-Boiled as an alternative to the Calm Mind set. Facade can be used with Toxic Orb, since Magic Guard will nullify the residual damage Toxic Orb usually causes. Clefable also can use Double-Edge with zero recoil, which is a decently powerful STAB move, and its immunity to Life Orb recoil allows it to potentially use a wallbreaking set with Trick Room support from teammates like Bronzong. A Focus Sash set could potentially be used with Endeavor, as Magic Guard will prevent it from taking hazard or residual damage that would otherwise mess with a mid-game Endeavor user. Healing Wish could be a decent option to support a wide variety of Pokemon. Finally, Belly Drum in theory could be used with Double Edge, Soft-Boiled, and Thunder Wave to threaten slower or stall-oriented builds, but this set would be extremely unreliable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: All Fighting-types like Breloom, Gallade, Heracross, Infernape, Machamp, and Lucario can OHKO Clefable with their powerful Close Combat while finding opportunities to pivot in due to Clefable's passive movesets. While these Pokemon must watch out in particular for Thunder Wave, they often will be paired with Thunder Wave-immune choices like Flygon and other Ground-types.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Any strong physical attacker will be a major threat to Clefable. Choice Band users like Dragonite, Gyarados, Flygon, Scizor, Swampert, and Tyranitar can OHKO or come very close to OHKOing all variants of Clefable. Beyond Choice Band users, Life Orb users and naturally strong physical attackers like Metagross, any variant of Tyranitar, Dragon Dance sweepers like Dragonite and Gyarados, and even physical Kingdra can all force Clefable out and do a ton of damage. Choice Band Scizor and Choice Band Tyranitar have the potential to hit Clefable with Pursuit as it switches out, which does a respectable amount of damage.</p> <p><strong>Iron Head Jirachi: Jirachi can induce two or three Iron Head flinches on Clefable and get it down to very low health. Even the Calm Mind set with heavy defensive investment must be very careful when dealing with Jirachi. While it is tempting to try to get a Thunder Wave off, Clefable is unfavored in this matchup.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Trick Users</strong>: Aerodactyl, Azelf, Gengar, Gliscor, and Heatran are some of the more prominent Taunt users that can shut down Clefable's support moves, restricting it only to Seismic Toss usually and preventing Calm Mind Clefable from setting up. By using Taunt and preventing Clefable from healing, it can be chipped down and pressured very easily. Additionally, Clefable is quite susceptible to Trick from Choice item users like Jirachi, Latias, and Rotom-A. If you determine in battle that one of these Pokemon is holding a Choice item, be very cautious. Trick users themselves also have to be aware of losing their item to Knock Off, though.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Ghost-types are immune to Seismic Toss and, if given the initiative, can use Substitute to prevent status. Gengar and Rotom-A are the most capable of these feats. Substitute + Pain Split Gengar can threaten Clefable with a very powerful Focus Blast and put it in a bad position. Rotom-A with Substitute or Rest can effectively stall out Clefable and force it to switch out, but the Substitute version must beware of Encore variants, as they will force Rotom-A out even from behind its Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Choice Specs Users</strong>: The strongest of special attackers like Heatran, Kingdra, Vaporeon, and even Swampert can convincingly 2HKO Clefable if they use Choice Specs. While none of these Pokemon are capable of OHKOing the bulkiest of Clefable, Modest Heatran for example does 73.8 - 87% with a Choice Specs-boosted Overheat to fully specially defensive Clefable. Choice Specs Heatran is most typically seen in the lead position, so tread lightly with Clefable when facing a lead Heatran until you have confirmed it is not using Choice Specs.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users: Any Substitute user that is a Ghost-type or can make 101 HP Substitutes or greater can put a hard stop to Clefable and set up on it. Calm Mind users like Jirachi and Suicune can boost up to +6 if they are gaining health from Leftovers. Other variants of Substitute Jirachi like ones with Iron Head will similarly force Clefable out and can take it down through flinches if it decides to stay in. Special attackers, aside from Gengar, will be stopped by Encore, though.</p> ",

        "name": "Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This support set takes advantage of Clefable's unique traits and is extremely flexible when considering utility move choices in the first two slots. For the first slot, Thunder Wave is recommended because it can both support your own Pokemon as well as cripple your opponent's offensive threats. Alternatively, Clefable makes for a reliable Stealth Rock user because it can pressure Starmie and does a good job at maintaining Stealth Rock. Protect is a great way to scout out powerful Choice item Pokemon, making it easier to pivot reliably; namely, Clefable can make it extremely difficult for Choice Band Tyranitar—one of its best counters—to reliably trap it, eliminating the mind games between Pursuit and Superpower.</p> <p>In the second slot, Knock Off is highly recommended to compensate for Clefable's passiveness by pressuring the opposing team and making it much more difficult to switch into, as no Pokemon appreciates their item being removed. It's worth noting that besides Gliscor, Clefable is the main Knock Off user in the metagame. It can get rid of Choice Band or Life Orb users' items as they switch into Clefable, which will increase its effectiveness in game. Removing items also will assist in team prediction because you can often figure out the roles Pokemon take through their items.</p> <p>Another alternative option is Encore, which is an extremely versatile move that will thwart any attempts to set up with Dragon Dance sweepers and Calm Mind users. Encore pairs especially nicely with Thunder Wave, as Clefable is usually slower than the opposing Pokemon, so it can paralyze them and then move first the second turn, which makes Encore more reliable.</p> <p>Seismic Toss and Soft-Boiled are used to maximize Clefable's consistency. Seismic Toss will effectively damage a myriad of specially attacking threats that Clefable seeks to check, like Empoleon, Heatran, Starmie, Suicune, and Zapdos. Soft-Boiled is a great instant recovery option to ensure that Clefable stays healthy.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximizing HP and Special Defense with a Special Defense-boosting nature is essential for Clefable to make sure it can take special hits as well as possible. However, an alternative spread with a minimum of 32 Defense EVs can be used to ensure that Clefable always survives a neutral-natured Tyranitar's Superpower. Leftovers lets Clefable gain passive recovery even in sand and hail due to its unique ability and notably usually prevents it from being 2HKOed by the more powerful special attackers. If you'd like to crank up Clefable's physical bulk even further, 72 Defense EVs will allow it to never be 2HKOed by Adamant Flygon's Earthquake, making it more effective at dealing with the very common Choice Scarf Flygon. If using Knock Off, consider a Careful nature to have more damage output versus Gengar and Rotom-A, which is useful if either of these Pokemon opts for Substitute.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Early-game, Clefable will often make a nice switch-in to Pokemon like lead Empoleon, Starmie, and Zapdos. If you see a lead Zapdos, be careful when sending in Clefable, however, because Modest Choice Specs Zapdos has a 47.7% chance to 2HKO non-Protect Clefable after Leftovers recovery. Also, it is likely Zapdos pivots out with U-turn early when it can potentially force a switch. If a Starmie comes in to spin Clefable's Stealth Rock away, try to remove its item if you have Knock Off; if not, paralyze it, and pressure it with Seismic Toss. You can introduce variation in your Stealth Rock timing to make it more difficult for your opponent to keep entry hazards off the field if Clefable does not have Thunder Wave to pressure Starmie. On teams without Tyranitar, Clefable will want to use Seismic Toss to burn Starmie's recovery. If you opt for Protect on Clefable, be careful not to use it excessively. Clefable is already quite a passive Pokemon, and your opponent can take advantage of it. If you see a Pokemon that is very likely to have a Choice item, be sure to use Protect to scout it out. If you use Encore, try your best to conserve its limited PP; be especially careful when using Encore on Pokemon with Pressure like Suicune and Zapdos, the former of which is one of the main targets of Encore. Hiding the fact that you have the move will often work effectively to surprise your opponent down the line. Try to observe the opponent's team and notice if they don't have anything that can effectively deal with Clefable. Oftentimes, Clefable can effectively wall out a large portion of teams. If you notice that their team looks a bit susceptible to Clefable, try your best to keep it healthy.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>When you're using Thunder Wave, slower offensive Pokemon like Breloom, Gyarados, Machamp, Metagross, Swampert, and Tyranitar pair very nicely with Clefable. In particular, Tyranitar, especially Choice Scarf or Chople Berry variants, can use Pursuit to trap pesky Ghost-types like Rotom-A and Gengar that could take advantage of Clefable if it opts for Protect or Stealth Rock. Furthermore, Tyranitar's Sand Stream is very useful for Clefable to help whittle the opposing team down. Pokemon that use Substitute can take advantage of paralysis, like Jirachi, Gengar, and Breloom. Magnezone could be a great fit to take advantage of Skarmory, which may try to set up entry hazards on Clefable; Knock Off can even be used to remove a Shed Shell. Be careful, however, because by using Pokemon like Tyranitar and Magnezone, you compound a Fighting-type weakness. Latias is a great offensive teammate because it has amazing type synergy with Clefable, resisting both Breloom and Infernape's STAB attacks. A Choice Scarf or Choice Specs Latias can use Sleep Talk to absorb a Spore. The same is true of Dragonite's Sleep Talk Choice Band set; however, Infernape packs Hidden Power Ice on occasion, which will OHKO Dragonite without Yache Berry.</p> <p>Defensively, Pokemon like Celebi, Gliscor, Skarmory, and Zapdos all synergize well with Clefable. Celebi is a nice Fighting-type answer and physical wall that can also contribute to spreading paralysis. Gliscor will do well versus many physical attacks aimed at Clefable and provides a key Fighting-type switch-in, while Clefable can pivot into many special attacks aimed at Gliscor. Zapdos can pair with Clefable to also take Fighting-type attacks very well, and Pressure can assist in slowly wearing down the opposing team. The Substitute + Toxic Zapdos set gets a special mention because Toxic helps Clefable wear opposing Pokemon down via Soft-Boiled. Skarmory can set up entry hazards for Clefable and allow Seismic Toss to more effectively pressure the opposing team. If you opt for Encore, Clefable can act as a pseudo-phazer, forcing switches and increasing the effectiveness of Skarmory's Spikes. Nidoqueen gets a special mention, as physically defensive variants can do quite well versus physical Infernape, and specially defensive variants can deal better with the mixed attacking sets. Poison Point makes it harder for Infernape to use Close Combat and U-turn repeatedly. Nidoqueen can also lay Toxic Spikes to support Clefable. Beyond that, Nidoqueen is a great answer to Fighting-type Pokemon in general. The core of Tyranitar, Nidoqueen, and Clefable gets a special mention; Tyranitar sets up sand and can trap threats like Starmie and Ghost-types, Nidoqueen resists Fighting-type attacks and can set up entry hazards, and Clefable is a special tank. You can also pair Rotom-A, which is immune to Fighting, with this core to prevent Rapid Spin. While Latias makes a solid offensive teammate, it also pairs wonderfully with Clefable as a defensive teammate. A bulky variant with Thunder Wave and/or Reflect will make it even better at walling Fighting-types, and paralysis support will help Clefable, as it is slower than most Pokemon. A bulkier Calm Mind + Roar set will provide solid backup against other Calm Mind sweepers like Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi, Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune, and CroCune, which tend to break through Clefable.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind, combined with Clefable's Magic Guard, turns it into a potent stallbreaker. Because Clefable is immune to residual damage from entry hazards and status—notably Toxic—stall-oriented teams usually have very little to combat it. With Soft-Boiled, Clefable can effectively alternate between increasing its Special Attack and Special Defense and instantly recovering its health. On top of that, Clefable has access to a plethora of special attacks that you can choose from based on the rest of the team. However, in particular, Thunderbolt combined with Ice Beam gives Clefable almost perfect coverage and a healthy number of PP to dismantle an entire opposing team.</p> <p>Beyond BoltBeam coverage being naturally effective in DPP, Ice Beam fits like a glove on Calm Mind Clefable, allowing it to threaten Pokemon like Gliscor, Flygon, and Dragonite. Also, Ice Beam can be used to chip Breloom with super effective damage. Thunderbolt fits amazingly on Calm Mind Clefable as well to threaten most Water-types; with multiple boosts, even the bulkiest of Water-types like non-Haze Milotic can be threatened with an OHKO. With Calm Mind Clefable's defensive investment, it can use Thunderbolt to soft check Gyarados, which cannot OHKO Clefable without a critical hit when unboosted.</p> <p>Flamethrower can be used over Thunderbolt to more effectively deal with Steel-types, especially Swords Dance Scizor, which can threaten Calm Mind Clefable by taking Thunderbolt well and reaching +2 Attack. However, this will make Clefable weaker to Water-types like Gyarados, Suicune, and Starmie.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximizing HP and Defense works effectively because Clefable already has naturally good Special Defense, which it can boost even further with just one Calm Mind. In addition, this Clefable wants to take physical hits as well as possible. With maximum investment in Defense and its Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, Clefable can even serve as a soft check to Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragon Dance Dragonite. Similarly, of course, with Flamethrower it would serve as a check to Swords Dance Scizor that lack Superpower. Alternatively, you can opt for an EV spread of 252 HP / 96 Def / 160 SpD with a Calm nature so an unboosted Clefable always takes less than 50% from a maximum Special Attack, neutral-natured Heatran's Fire Blast. This secondary EV spread also stays more true to Clefable's role as a special wall, if you wish to go that route. The set is rounded out with Leftovers to increase Clefable's longevity and help it better serve its purpose.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Calm Mind Clefable is unique in that unlike other Calm Mind sweepers, it isn't usually stashed as a last Pokemon. In fact, it usually enters the game quite early and uses one or two Calm Minds to put early pressure on the opponent. The set's longevity allows it to utilize the pressure-inducing asset of Calm Mind, combined with the fact that the move also has a generous number of PP. Ice Beam can add to the pressure by threatening to freeze certain checks like Haze Milotic and Pokemon with Roar or Whirlwind. Try to initially bait in a Pokemon like Skarmory before revealing Thunderbolt or Ice Beam if you've scouted it out prior, as oftentimes Skarmory will use Clefable to get entry hazards up. Although it's been mentioned that you can use Calm Mind early to put pressure on your opponent, keeping the set unrevealed can also be effective in surprising Gyarados or Dragonite with Thunderbolt or Ice Beam. If Clefable is at full, it can pivot reliably into Gyarados before it uses Dragon Dance. Sometimes, the Gyarados will even attempt to use Taunt to set up more Dragon Dances, and you can shut it down with Thunderbolt. Calm Mind Clefable has enough physical and special bulk to pivot into many different Pokemon; some examples are Celebi, Starmie, Suicune, and weaker physical attackers.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Calm Mind Clefable dislikes facing most Steel-type Pokemon like Bronzong, Metagross, Jirachi, Scizor, and some variants of Skarmory, so a Fire-type Pokemon like Heatran could be a good pairing. Hippowdon generates sand through its Sand Stream, which Clefable appreciates to help wear opposing Pokemon down, and also matches up well versus Metagross and Jirachi. Tyranitar is another option, but beware of compounding a Fighting-type weakness. Skarmory can be used to handle most Steel-types and gets a special mention because Clefable matches up well versus Heatran, one of the only Steel-type Pokemon Skarmory always detests. Calm Mind Clefable is good at forcing switches, so the Spikes support also will be particularly effective. Similarly, Toxic Spikes also works wonderfully with Calm Mind Clefable, as its instant recovery move in Soft-Boiled and overall bulk will allow Clefable to stall out a large number of poisoned Pokemon. Nidoqueen and Roserade both fit the bill, and both Pokemon resist Fighting, which can be helpful for Clefable; however, Roserade needs significant Defense investment to properly take physical Fighting-type attacks. While Clefable can handle most Heatran effectively, some variants with Magma Storm and Taunt can be troubling, so having backup for Heatran is important. Magnezone can trap most of the Steel-types that give Calm Mind Clefable trouble. Defensively, Celebi, Gliscor, Latias, and Zapdos will pair well with Calm Mind Clefable. Latias doesn't need to use Roar as much on other Calm Mind sweepers, since Calm Mind Clefable will handle most of them well, but it is still useful for Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi and will pair well with the entry hazards that Clefable appreciates. A more offensive Choice Scarf or Choice Specs Latias with Sleep Talk is very good at handling Breloom, which Calm Mind Clefable dislikes if it cannot punish its entry with an Ice Beam.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Wish",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Magic Guard sets Clefable apart as a Wish user. Clefable can enter into entry hazards without taking damage, and barring direct attacks it can switch in an indefinite number of times while getting a turn of Leftovers recovery each time, which can be especially effective for Wish passing versus stall-oriented builds. The consistent damage from Seismic Toss means that Clefable has more than enough room to run both Wish and Protect as well as a more flexible option for the last slot.</p> <p>Protect is a mandatory move with Wish Clefable because it cannot sustain itself without an instant recovery move. On top of that, Protect's general utility for stalling out opponents and properly scouting Choice item users is very powerful when using a more passive Pokemon.</p> <p>Knock Off is highly recommended to make it more difficult to switch into Clefable, allowing it to more freely use Wish. In addition, it helps tremendously to compensate for Clefable's passivity. Encore can be used as an alternative to force opposing Pokemon out, create more opportunities to use Wish, and prevent Clefable from being overly passive by stopping setup sweepers in their tracks. Reliably answering Pokemon like CroCune, Calm Mind Jirachi, and opposing Calm Mind Clefable is a really unique trait.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximize HP and Special Defense investment lets Clefable function as a sturdy special wall. An alternative would be to use 32 EVs in Defense to always survive Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Superpower. With Protect, is it less important to hit a benchmark like Adamant Flygon's Earthquake, since Clefable can gain more Leftovers recovery and consistently stall out the Earthquakes. Leftovers is used in conjunction with Protect to maximize Clefable's potential as a Wish user.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Assuming that you are using this Clefable on a more defensive build, you have the freedom to play more aggressively with your other Pokemon. As always with Encore, try to save the PP for as long as possible and only use it in case of an emergency unless you are feeling comfortable in your position and want to gain momentum. Since Wish Clefable has maximum HP and Special Defense, it can come into almost all special attackers with ease. Early-game, if Clefable is healthy, try to use Seismic Toss initially and reveal Wish for when you need it. If your opponent catches on to the fact that you're using Wish, they can turn up the aggression and try to take advantage of Clefable likely not carrying Thunder Wave. Revealing Protect is completely fine and does not necessarily indicate that Clefable has Wish.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since Wish Clefable usually finds itself on more defensive builds, it is recommended to pair it with defensive Pokemon that appreciate Wish support; Pokemon that are vulnerable to entry hazards such as Nidoqueen, Milotic, Swampert, and Tentacruel will benefit tremendously from the consistent Wishes that Clefable passes. Additionally, these Pokemon all synergize well defensively with Clefable. Milotic, Swampert, and Tentacruel can all deal with Infernape, while the former two can also check Metagross. Nidoqueen and Tentacruel both provide a Fighting resistance, which brings type synergy into play as well. Skarmory and Toxic Spikes users are of course fantastic fits with Wish Clefable, as stalling out the opposing team with Toxic Spikes support is something that Wish Clefable specializes in. Beyond Pokemon that specifically appreciate the Wish support, the usual defensive synergies apply to Wish Clefable as well. Pokemon like Celebi, Gliscor, Latias, and Zapdos pair excellently with Clefable. Celebi and Zapdos will also appreciate the Wish support, since Celebi is considered vulnerable to hazards, and Zapdos is weak to Stealth Rock, increasing the ease of pivoting these Pokemon in. An offensive variant of Latias that can't heal itself will be able to take advantage of Clefable's Wish support as well with its wonderful typing and near-perfect synergy with Clefable. Sleep Talk Latias can help to counter Breloom, which would be painful for Wish Clefable to face unless it is Substitute + Focus Punch and has already put something to sleep.</p> <p>In general, Pokemon that have good Defense but weaker Special Defense can create opportunities for Clefable to pivot in and provide Wish support. Metagross is a good example that also appreciates Wish support. If you use Iron Ball Metagross, you can bait Rotom-A in and cripple it by grounding it.</p> <p>Wish Clefable, like all other variants, appreciates Sand Stream support. Tyranitar and Hippowdon provide exactly that for Clefable, but make sure when using Clefable and Tyranitar together to account for the Fighting-type weakness. Wish Clefable is also weak to Pokemon that can exploit its passivity. Ghost-types like Gengar and Rotom-A are not threatened much by the Encore version; Gengar can use Taunt and completely shut this Clefable down. Choice Scarf Tyranitar is a great choice for trapping these pesky Ghost-types with Pursuit. Wish Clefable can in turn provide Tyranitar with healing.</p> "

  "Alakazam": {
    "overview": "<p>Four generations have passed since Alakazam's glory days in RBY, and each one has brought something new to spite it, while giving it almost nothing back in return. GSC's special split not only ruined Alakazam's special bulk, but also made Snorlax a more potent foe, and also added Blissey and Tyranitar to the fray. ADV added abilities, which improved just about every Pokemon in the game except Alakazam, and also introduced Choice Band, which increased the strength of the physical attackers that Alakazam hates. It was DPP, however, that gave Alakazam the final push into obscurity, with the introduction of Choice Scarf to undermine Alakazam's godlike Speed, the physical / special split to make both Pursuit and the elemental punches physical, and of course the rise of the ubiquitous Technician Scizor, in which Alakazam has at last met its match. Additionally, for the first time since its introduction, Alakazam became close-to-outclassed by a non-Uber Pokemon, Azelf, who has slightly lower Speed and Special Attack, but an arguably better movepool that most notably includes Nasty Plot. While its old rivals Gengar and Starmie still get by on their slightly larger movepools and better typings, Alakazam lacks the necessary traits to be a special sweeper in this metagame. Primarily, it lacks notable resistances, priority moves, and usable setup moves. Furthermore, it is as frail as a glass thimble and its STAB is resisted by half the OU metagame, all of which combine to make it less than half the threat it used to be.</p> <p>However, do not be so hasty as to condemn it to disuse. While the metagame seems to have passed it by, Alakazam still has all the traits that made it so good back in the day: its titanic base 135 Special Attack stat, the highest of any non-Uber Pokemon, as well as its equally impressive base 120 Speed stat, which allows it to outrun nearly the entirety of the unboosted OU metagame. Aside from raw power, however, Alakazam is also known for its plethora of annoying tricks in Encore, Trick, and Taunt. All in all, when played correctly, Alakazam can become as threatening as any other offensive Pokemon. It might have fallen from grace, but popularity is by no means a definition of power.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Alakazam is nothing if not versatile, and it has a massive number of appealing tricks up its sleeve. Taunt and Encore have already been mentioned, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Alakazam is the fastest user of dual screens in OU, and can easily set up with the help of Taunt. Trick is an excellent move and is useful on Choice sets, but this is no longer Alakazam's trademark as Rotom-A does this more effectively; furthermore, it leaves Alakazam as Pursuit bait for Tyranitar and Scizor. Thunder Wave is another useful move to support the team with, but because of Alakazam's blistering Speed, it can rarely take advantage of paralyzed opponents. Knock Off is much the same; as fun as it might be to deprive Scizor and Tyranitar of their Choice items, it is generally not worth the moveslot. Of all the field effects Alakazam gets, Gravity is perhaps the most notable, as it improves the accuracy of Focus Blast and also supports the team.</p> <p>On the offensive side, Calm Mind is an interesting setup move that can be used on Alakazam's sweeper set in place of--or even in addition to--Substitute, but a setup sweeper Alakazam is stopped too easily by phazers and Blissey to be effective. Lum Berry lets Alakazam absorb otherwise crippling status, but the loss in power from Life Orb is considerable. Lastly, Recover can offset lost health from Substitute, Life Orb, sandstorm, and other residual damage, but this compromises Alakazam's type coverage and it has many better options to run in that moveslot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Alakazam's fall hinged on the metagame packing everything Alakazam hates--strong special walls and a multitude of physical attackers. Of all potential counters to Alakazam, Blissey is by far the most solid, as it can take a Choice Specs-boosted Focus Blast with ease and recover health with Soft-Boiled or Wish. However, Alakazam can employ Trick, Taunt, Recover, and Encore to beat Blissey, so be on your guard. Snorlax can also take most special attacks and has access to Pursuit and Return, but can be 2HKOed by Life Orb Focus Blast with a little residual damage.</p> <p>Scizor walks all over Alakazam if the latter lacks Substitute. If Scizor switches in and Alakazam does not have a Substitute up, Scizor essentially traps it entirely--if Alakazam stays in, it risks getting KOed by Bullet Punch, but if it switches out, it can be KOed by Pursuit. Furthermore, Scizor can also use U-turn to annihilate Alakazam and escape from its counter all in one stroke. Similarly, Choice Scarf Steel-types, such as Jirachi and Heatran, can switch in to revenge kill, but they risk a super effective attack on the switch. In fact, all of the Steel-types that typically switch into Alakazam--especially Scizor--should be mindful of Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>If Alakazam lacks Shadow Ball or Signal Beam, Starmie beats it soundly between Recover and its attacking options. Weavile is another nasty threat despite its rarity, as it is immune to Psychic and is one of the few Pokemon naturally faster than Alakazam; it can then OHKO Alakazam with Pursuit regardless of whether it stays in or switches out. Tyranitar also deserves a mention in this regard as it can act as a last-minute check if Focus Blast misses. Alakazam will generally faint to any attack, so just about any faster Pokemon can revenge kill it; however, outside of Choice Scarf users, Pokemon that naturally outspeed Alakazam are few and far between.</p> ",

        "name": "Substitute + 3 Attacks",
        "description": "<p>While Alakazam has fallen out of favor as an offensive Pokemon, it is still one of the strongest special attackers in the game. Unlike its fellow Psychic-types Starmie and Azelf, Alakazam can outrun Jolly Choice Scarf Tyranitar, which enables it to not only bypass an otherwise rock-solid check to Psychic-types, but also act as an excellent lure by removing these problematic Pokemon with a combination of Substitute and one of its coverage moves.</p> <p>Substitute enables Alakazam to scout its opponent, hit the switch-in with the appropriate attack, block status moves from the likes of Blissey, and escape from Pursuit traps set by opponents such as Weavile and Scizor. Alakazam's tendency to force switches makes it relatively easy to get a Substitute up; however, remember that Alakazam will be losing a great deal of health to passive damage, so Substitute should generally be used sparingly. Psychic is good reliable STAB that has the power to 2HKO just about everything that does not resist it outside of Blissey and Snorlax. Focus Blast gets rid of the Dark-types that are immune to Alakazam's STAB attacks, as well as the Steel-types that can cause problems. It easily OHKOes Tyranitar and Heatran, and does a fair amount to Blissey and Snorlax. However, many of OU's common Steel-types, such as Scizor, Metagross, and Skarmory, take only neutral damage from Focus Blast, and given how dangerous these Pokemon are to Alakazam, it is necessary to have a way to take them out quickly. Hidden Power Fire OHKOes Scizor and, with Life Orb, cleanly 2HKOes Jirachi, Celebi, and Metagross. On the other hand, Signal Beam enables Alakazam to hit Psychic-types, such as Starmie, Azelf, and Celebi, and also grants it a more reliable hit on Dark-types. Unfortunately, the loss of Hidden Power Fire is a crippling blow to Alakazam's effectiveness against Steel-types.</p> <p>Alakazam should look to maximizing its Speed and Special Attack, as these are the only two stats it will be using. A Timid nature is recommended as Alakazam simply cannot afford to take a hit from anything. However, note that the IV drop from Hidden Power Fire prevents Alakazam from Speed tying with other base 120s. Therefore, you might wish to lower your sights to hit the next-lowest Speed benchmark, and dump the rest in HP. A Timid nature and 228 Speed EVs is advised as a minimum to beat out Jolly Choice Scarf Tyranitar, who is the biggest threat Alakazam will face in this area. Life Orb is the recommended item despite Alakazam's vulnerability to passive damage, as it gives Alakazam the power necessary to OHKO dangerous threats such as Tyranitar and Heatran. On the other hand, Leftovers is useful to offset Substitute and residual damage, but the loss in power is quite crippling.</p> <p>If you dislike Substitute's residual damage, there are a number of other options that are worth mentioning in that slot. Encore and Taunt are both useful stallbreaking moves, while Protect can let Alakazam scout Choice-locked Scizor's move. Alakazam can run Shadow Ball in the third slot, not only for coverage on Psychic-types, but also to smack Ghost-types super effectively. Specifically, it enables Alakazam to OHKO Choice Scarf Rotom-A with Stealth Rock support. Remember that without Substitute or Protect, Alakazam is much more susceptible to being revenge killed. If you do not mind losing out on a bit of type coverage, Alakazam can even forgo an attack to run both Substitute and Encore to more easily take advantage of Encore, as the protection of Substitute lets Alakazam Encore attacking moves with less risk.</p> <p>Substitute Alakazam makes an excellent lure for many problematic Pokemon, such as Scizor, Tyranitar, and Heatran, as well as non-Choice Scarf Jirachi and Celebi, because it can OHKO all of them with one of its coverage attacks. With this in mind, it pairs well with setup sweepers that will benefit from the weakening or removal of these Pokemon. One such example is Swords Dance Breloom, who can also support Alakazam through Spore and the ability to frighten away Blissey. Other good teammates are Pokemon with good offensive synergy with Alakazam. Steel-types are generally the biggest obstacles to Alakazam; Magnezone can easily trap and destroy Scizor and Jirachi Choice-locked into their STAB moves. However, be wary of Steel-types that have super effective STAB moves, namely Lucario and Heatran. Swampert is a good partner as it can take on both Tyranitar and Metagross, and also check Scizor to an extent. Heatran works in much the same way, but forfeits the ability to beat Tyranitar in exchange for the ability to maul just about every Steel-type that exists.</p> <p>You will also want a physical attacker or two on your team to overcome Blissey, as well as a way to beat down Pursuit users; good picks for this role include Fighting-types such as Machamp. Dragon Dance Gyarados is another good option as a late-game sweeper as it can set up on Choice-locked Steel-type moves, such as Scizor's Bullet Punch and Jirachi's Iron Head. Similarly, Tyranitar and Lucario can set up very easily on Choice-locked Pursuit. Lastly, Tyranitar and Scizor can be helpful allies to Encore variants of Alakazam; should it manage to Encore a non-offensive move, such as Blissey's Soft-Boiled, the aforementioned Pokemon can take the opportunity to trap it with Pursuit. Tyranitar and Scizor are also helpful in beating Psychic-types such as Starmie, who might cause Alakazam trouble.</p> "

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<p>Zapdos has an excellent typing, both offensively and defensively, which boasts resistances and immunities to the most common attacks of top-tier OU threats such as Jirachi, Metagross, Lucario, and Flygon. Electric-type is phenomenal offensively, as it hits the majority of the metagame with neutral damage. Although Zapdos's Stealth Rock weakness limits its walling capabilities, Roost and Rapid Spin support help combat that problem. Zapdos is capable of taking on many of the OU tier's top physical and special threats thanks to its all-around great stats and typing. Its high Special Attack and good Speed allow it to perform wonderfully in an offensive role, and it has great coverage options in Heat Wave, Hidden Power Ice, and Hidden Power Grass. It can also use U-turn to function as a fantastic pivot, taking advantage of its defensive capabilities to open up safe switches for its teammates. Unfortunately, Zapdos struggles with the ever-popular Tyranitar, Nidoqueen, Latias, and Clefable, four of the strongest defensive options in the tier, although this can be remedied with proper team support. Zapdos is one of the most difficult Pokemon to counter in OU overall, as its generous movepool and great assets are near unparalleled on paper.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Zapdos can utilize a Choice Scarf set to serve as a decent revenge killer; however, its Stealth Rock weakness significantly hinders it, and it faces competiton with bulkier sets, which still provide decent insurance versus Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite, as well as Swords Dance Lucario. Zapdos is also a sturdy user of Rain Dance, and can take advantage of it with a 100% accurate STAB Thunder off one of the highest Special Attack stats in OU. Thunder Wave is a good choice to support a slower team, especially one with a slow sweeper like Machamp. Protect is a great move that combines with Pressure to whittle down its foe's PP and also wear them down with residual damage from sand and poison. Charge Beam can be used to boost Zapdos's Special Attack, but it has a hard time replacing moves like Roost, Agility, and U-turn. Zapdos is also capable of utilizing a Metal Sound set, but it requires entry hazards to maximize its effectiveness.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon: Tyranitar, Clefable, and Blissey check Zapdos very well. Tyranitar must watch out for Toxic, and less bulky variants must watch out for Choice Specs or Life Orb Zapdos. However, Tyranitar usually forces Zapdos out with the threat of a powerful Stone Edge or Crunch. Clefable and Blissey don't care as much about Toxic because of their Magic Guard and Natural Cure. Latias is also a fantastic offensive and defensive check to Zapdos, as its monstrous natural Special Defense enables it to shrug off most of Zapdos' attacks with ease. Specially defensive Heatran can take Zapdos's Electric-type attacks quite well and fire back with moves like Lava Plume and Toxic, but doesn't want to be paralyzed by Discharge. Although very niche, Snorlax has monstrous HP and Special Defense, and it can threaten to paralyze Zapdos with Body Slam or remove it with Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Swampert and Hippowdon don't mind most of Zapdos's attacks, but both must watch out for Toxic; Swampert also has to be cautious of Hidden Power Grass. Otherwise, these Pokemon can take advantage of Zapdos and set up Stealth Rock, use Roar to phaze other foes, or fire an Ice-type attack to wear Zapdos down. Nidoqueen is immune to Thunder Wave and Toxic, but without investment in Special Defense, Hidden Power Ice can wear it down. Still, it can take advantage of Zapdos and set up Toxic Spikes or use Ice Beam to wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Raikou resists Thunderbolt and doesn't mind any of Zapdos's other attacking moves; however, it must watch out for Toxic or the rarer Thunder Wave. It outspeeds Zapdos, it can set up Calm Mind, and it can use its strong Thunderbolt to deal significant damage. Jolteon's Volt Absorb enables it to switch into Zapdos quite easily and threaten it with Choice Specs-boosted attacks. RestTalk Rotom-A completely walls Zapdos and can threaten it with Thunderbolt and Will-O-Wisp.</p> ",

        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With only two weaknesses, good stats overall, Roost for recovery, and Pressure to waste opponents' PP, this Zapdos makes a great tank. Its Electric-type STAB move is its go-to attacking option, which will hurt even with no EV investment thanks to Zapdos's base 125 Special Attack. Use Thunderbolt for a bit more power, or use Discharge to have a higher chance of inflicting paralysis on foes like Latias, Tyranitar, and Jirachi.</p> <p>Zapdos can run Hidden Power Grass over Hidden Power Ice, losing super effective coverage on Gliscor, Flygon, and Dragonite, but gaining the ability to beat one of its biggest counters, Swampert. If you decide to use U-turn or Toxic, use Hidden Power Ice for better type coverage.</p> <p>Heat Wave OHKOes Scizor, who might otherwise Roost off the damage dealt by a neutral Thunderbolt, as well as other Steel-types like Jirachi, Metagross, Bronzong, and Magnezone. The 32 Speed EVs let Zapdos outrun max Speed non-Scarf Tyranitar. U-turn is a fantastic option for pivoting against foes like Tyranitar, Latias, and Clefable. Toxic hits Swampert without having to use Hidden Power Grass, and also works effectively against Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Rotom-A.</p> <p>Zapdos has some other interesting options like Roar and Protect. Roar is useful when combined with entry hazards and also as a backup for phazing setup sweepers. Protect can be used in tandem with Toxic Spikes and Pressure to make Zapdos even more effective at wearing down its foes.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP EVs are used to enable Zapdos to enter into Stealth Rock one extra time, in case it cannot heal its health and sand is up. 32 Speed EVs are used to outpace maximum Speed Tyranitar. The rest of the EVs are poured into Defense to make Zapdos as physically bulky as possible. Leftovers is important for preserving Zapdos's health as well as possible given its fragility due to Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Zapdos is an effective early-game scouter because it has so few counters, so it can force many switches. Take advantage of Stealth Rock not being up and send Zapdos in when you can. Given its amazing defensive typing and stats, Zapdos can come in with relative safety against various OU tanks, walls, and sweepers. From there, it can stall out its opponents with Roost, or deal some damage with its variety of attacking options. Be careful when using Roost, as Zapdos becomes vulnerable to Ground-type attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Even though this Zapdos makes a great defensive addition to any team, it's fairly easy to wall. As with most special attackers, it is effectively countered by Clefable, Blissey, and specially defensive Tyranitar. A Pursuit user can help to deal chip damage to Clefable and Blissey; Tyranitar is a perfect candidate for this thanks to its sky-high Attack and access to Superpower. Zapdos also has issues with Stealth Rock, making a Rapid Spinner, such as Starmie, very beneficial.</p> <p>Other counters to Zapdos vary depending on which moves you choose. Swampert can easily stop any Zapdos that lacks Hidden Power Grass, while Celebi does not fear Zapdos that lack Heat Wave. A Celebi of your own can take almost all of Swampert's attacks with ease and force it out with the threat of a Grass-type move. Nidoqueen, especially specially defensive variants, can be extremely difficult for Zapdos to overcome, especially if it lacks Hidden Power Ice.</p> "

        "name": "SubRoost",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Zapdos's best way of annoying the opponent is stalling their Pokemon out with Substitute and Roost while wearing them down with Thunderbolt, and it does quite a good job at it. This set can be used effectively in conjunction with Toxic Spikes, accumulating poison damage on some of Zapdos's usual switch-ins while taking advantage of Pressure to waste your opponent's PP. Common victims of this strategy include Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Rotom-A. Substitute and Roost, when used wisely, will block status and keep Zapdos at high health.</p> <p>Almost all Flying-type Pokemon immune to Toxic Spikes will fall to Zapdos's STAB-boosted Thunderbolt, or in Gliscor, Dragonite, and Flygon's case, Hidden Power Ice. Using Hidden Power Ice forms BoltBeam coverage that Zapdos can abuse heavily, especially from behind a Substitute. Toxic is also a viable option in the last slot if you decide to not run this set alongside Toxic Spikes, though it is recommended that you do. Toxic has additional usefulness in poisoning Pokemon immune to Toxic Spikes, namely Pokemon with Levitate, such as Rotom-A and Zapdos. However, losing out on Hidden Power Ice makes Zapdos completely unable to touch Nidoqueen, and Taunt Gliscor may be a bit more difficult to deal with. Thankfully, other than Heatran, Magnezone, and bulky variants of Jirachi, very few Steel-type Pokemon can reliably switch in against this Zapdos.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The above EVs maximize Zapdos's Speed while enabling it to survive a +2 Life Orb-boosted Extreme Speed from Lucario after Stealth Rock. Optionally, Zapdos can reduce its speed to as low as 300 in favor of more HP and additional physical bulk. 192 HP enables Zapdos to use Substitute one extra time from full health.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Zapdos can be used either in the lead slot or midgame. As a lead, it can use Substitute against Pokemon like Metagross, Hippowdon, Roserade, and even Azelf. If it has Toxic, use it on the first turn to catch Hippowdon off guard as it sets up Stealth Rock. Use Substitute to block status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave; Jirachi's Body Slam has an extremely low chance to break Zapdos's Substitute, so it can also prevent paralysis in that regard. Zapdos can also get a free Substitute if it comes in on a Choice-locked Ground-type move, such as Choice Scarf Flygon's Earthquake.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since the aim of this set is to stall, this Zapdos works best when paired with Toxic Spikes. Nidoqueen can set up Toxic Spikes and matches up well against Tyranitar, but it also compounds an Ice-type weakness. Tentacruel resists Ice-type attacks aimed at Zapdos, can set up Toxic Spikes, and can use Rapid Spin to assist Zapdos further. Zapdos also appreciates Spikes support from Skarmory, as Zapdos can force many switches and the extra chip damage from Spikes can make a huge difference in its ability to KO a foe. Starmie is the most consistent spinner in OU, and has strong synergy with Zapdos. Bronzong can assist Zapdos in spreading Toxic to foes like Hippowdon and Tyranitar.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Choice Specs Zapdos is a huge threat that boasts the most powerful Thunderbolt in OU. Hidden Power Flying is Zapdos's best Flying-type STAB attack, which maims Fighting- and Grass-types like Machamp, Heracross, Celebi, Shaymin, and Breloom. Hidden Power Ice is a solid alternative for increased damage on Ground-types like Hippowdon, Nidoqueen, and Gliscor as well as Dragon-types like Dragonite, Latias, and Flygon. However, Hidden Power Flying still deals solid damage to all of these Pokemon. Heat Wave covers Steel-types like Magnezone, Jirachi, Metagross, and Bronzong. Sleep Talk is an alternative to Heat Wave that enables Zapdos to function as a sleep absorber, which is effective because all the moves Sleep Talk can call will be threatening; furthermore, it can switch into Roserade and Breloom with relative ease when healthy, and it can stay in more confidently versus lead Roserade. Although U-turn is a physical attack, it's a great move to round out the set. Zapdos will often force switches, and it can use U-turn to pivot out and send teammates in safely. This can work well against foes like Tyranitar and specially defensive Jirachi.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Modest nature is recommended because it maximizes Zapdos's Special Attack while still letting Zapdos outspeed foes like Rotom-A, Suicune, and even Gallade. A Timid nature is a decent alternative to get the jump on Gliscor, Jirachi, Roserade, and non-Choice Scarf Flygon, but the reduced power usually isn't worth it. If you're using Hidden Power Ice, move the 4 HP EVs into Defense, as Hidden Power Ice's lack of an HP IV drop means they are no longer needed to minimize Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Zapdos can make for an extremely effective lead, OHKOing foes like most Colbur Berry Azelf, Lum Berry Machamp, Skarmory, Gyarados, and Lum Berry Metagross. In addition, it deals significant damage to many common leads like Heatran, Jirachi, and even Swampert. Be mindful that Zapdos will also force out leads like Gliscor, Dragonite, and Gyarados, and lead Flygon will most certainly use U-turn. Take advantage of this and consider using U-turn to scout out the opponent's switch-ins to Zapdos while also gaining momentum. If their switch is not a Ground-type, you can likely determine that Thunderbolt will be an effective move to use once Zapdos is sent in again. Zapdos, especially without Leftovers and defensive investment, is incredibly fragile, so it's especially important to pick your spots. Try sending it in on bad Choice-locked moves like Choice Scarf Flygon's Earthquake and Choice Scarf Heatran's Earth Power.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Zapdos is incredibly good at ripping holes in the opposing team fairly early, so offensive threats that appreciate Zapdos's ability to do that are recommended. Agility Metagross pairs very well with Zapdos, as Zapdos can make quick work of bulky Water-types like Milotic, Starmie, and Suicune and chip away at Swampert with Hidden Power Flying, which Metagross desperately wants gone or worn down significantly before it can clean. An offensive variant of Starmie can use Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock and threaten irritating Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert. Breloom is a potent offensive partner that can severely punish Hippowdon, Swampert, Blissey, and Clefable. Choice Band Scizor and Choice Scarf Flygon can be used together or separately in tandem with Zapdos to form a U-turn chain, which can put constant pressure on the opposing team. Scizor's Bullet Punch is incredibly useful to hit faster threats like Choice Scarf Flygon, Gengar, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar. It can also use Pursuit to hit Clefable on the switch, which can put it in range for Zapdos's Thunderbolt. Tyranitar, much like Scizor, can use Pursuit to chip Blissey and Clefable, set up Stealth Rock, and check Starmie. In turn, Zapdos can switch into Breloom, resist both its STAB attacks, and even absorb Spore if it uses Sleep Talk. If you're using Starmie and Breloom, Heatran can complete a Fire / Water / Grass core and provide utility through its Steel typing and Flash Fire. Magma Storm Heatran can trap and remove Hippowdon, Clefable, Blissey, and Swampert with Explosion—or, in Swampert's case, Hidden Power Grass—paving the way for Zapdos to clean.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Zapdos can run a specially defensive set thanks to its fantastic defensive typing, allowing it to take special attacks that would usually force it out. Therefore, Zapdos is able to put pressure on the opposing team with its special bulk that allows it to survive the most powerful special attacks of the tier including Draco Meteor from Dragonite, Kingdra, Latias, and Flygon, Overheat from Choice Specs Heatran, and other strong special attacks from Starmie, Gengar, Empoleon, and Infernape. Then, Zapdos is able to retaliate quite hard, since most special attackers are frail or can heal off the damage depending on the situation. On the other hand, if Zapdos is healthy enough, its natural physical bulk with HP investment is sufficient to let it act as a decent switch-in to Fighting- and Steel-type Pokemon, giving it the ability to reasonably check a great portion of the metagame including foes like Jirachi, Scizor, Metagross, Lucario, and Breloom.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is the standard option for a primary attack, especially if Zapdos is coupled with status inducers, mainly those with access to Toxic Spikes, and the move's higher power compared to Discharge can be valuable if you are scared to fail to finish off a weakened Kingdra or Machamp. However, Discharge remains a very nice option thanks to its 30% paralysis rate, which can potentially cripple threats that can check bulky Zapdos such as Tyranitar, Latias, and Heatran. Hidden Power Ice and an Electric-type coverage move create a pseudo-BoltBeam combo that hits almost every Pokemon in the metagame for neutral damage. Hidden Power Ice also allows Zapdos to better handle Gliscor and Dragon-types, which would otherwise benefit from its lack of coverage. Also, specially defensive Zapdos does extremely well versus mixed Dragon-types, which is why it makes such great use of the move. Heat Wave is useful to hit Steel- and Grass-type foes such as Metagross, Jirachi, Lucario, Celebi, and Breloom for a more consequential portion of damage than Hidden Power Ice or neutral Thunderbolt would. Roost allows Zapdos to restore 50% of its health in one turn, which helps on such a defensive Pokemon. Alternatively, Roar deals with Calm Mind users, such as Suicune and Jirachi, which can easily handle Zapdos's uninvested Thunderbolts.</p> <p>Status-inducing moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave are also great options to consider. Toxic is viable if you decide not to run this set alongside Toxic Spikes, as it can cripple Tyranitar and common Ground-types switch-ins like Swampert or Hippowdon, while Thunder Wave works decently well on paralysis centric archetypes.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EVs maximize Zapdos's HP and Special Defense, helping Zapdos switch into weak special moves like non-STAB Ice Beam, uninvested Thunderbolt, or and Surf after Stealth Rock damage with much more ease. On top of that, it allows Zapdos to decently check threats like Gengar, Starmie, and mixed Infernape. Also, Zapdos can survive the most powerful special attacks of the tier such as Choice Specs Heatran's Overheat, Latias's Draco Meteor, and Torrent, rain, or Calm Mind-boosted Hydro Pump or Ice Beam from Empoleon, Kingdra, and Suicune. It is important to remember that using 248 HP EVs is more beneficial than fully maximizing HP, since that allows Zapdos to switch into Stealth Rock five times instead of four. 32 Speed EVs let Zapdos outrun maximum Speed non-Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Leftovers is the item of choice for a defensive Pokemon like Zapdos, making it match up significantly better versus Iron Head Jirachi, which may otherwise have an easier time chipping down Zapdos and causing it to flinch.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bring Zapdos onto the field against a foe it can threaten, heal off the damage with Roost until it's at full HP, and repeat. Because of Discharge's nice paralysis chance, it's often a good idea to spam the move; Pokemon that can otherwise absorb Zapdos's uninvested special attacks like Latias, Heatran, and Tyranitar have a harder time when paralyzed. Remember to take advantage of Pressure when possible. Zapdos's ability to just use Roost over and over in the face of attacks makes it much easier to PP stall foes that use moves like Focus Blast, Hydro Pump, Fire Blast, and Draco Meteor.</p> <p>Specially defensive Zapdos can be played as a lead thanks to its dual typing, which provides it with a good matchup against special attacking leads such as Empoleon, Heatran, Dragonite, and even opposing Zapdos while doing a great job against leads that have type disadvantages like Metagross and Jirachi, even if the EV spread is not meant to beat them. If Zapdos is played as a lead, consider running U-turn, as it can potentially keep momentum against leads that Zapdos naturally scares out such as Gyarados, Gliscor, and Starmie and frail Choice Scarf users like Infernape and Flygon. Also, you should probably run Heat Wave instead of Hidden Power Ice, as it is able to land a clean 2HKO on lead non-Occa Berry Metagross, which is important in preventing it from getting off a free Explosion after it sets up Stealth Rock. Also, Discharge has a small chance of not damaging Empoleon enough to where it would be boosted by Torrent. Keep in mind that specially defensive Zapdos can have trouble switching into popular, primarily physical types like Fighting, Bug, and Steel, whereas it hardly has any resistances to the common special types such as Dragon, Water, Fire, and Electric.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Specially defensive Zapdos fits well on both balanced and stall teams alike, coveted for its fairly useful set of targets that it can shut down. In terms of teammates, Starmie can provide useful Rapid Spin support. It can also act as a secondary switch-in to Fighting-types and absorb status aimed at Zapdos thanks to Natural Cure. Clefable and Tyranitar wall this set; therefore, Machamp, Scizor, Tyranitar, and Jirachi are very good partners to help cover Zapdos's weakness to those Pokemon. Breloom is helpful to break through stall reliant archetypes, which give this set trouble. Toxic Spikes support is a great complement to this set, since Zapdos's counters are usually grounded. Roserade and Nidoqueen are great partners for this reason. Roserade can also handle status ailments aimed at Zapdos, while Nidoqueen can decently check Tyranitar. It is also important to note that this set will have difficulty checking powerful physical threats due to Zapdos's lower Defense stat, so make sure to back it up appropriately with additional Fighting-resistant and physically bulky Pokemon as teammates. Gliscor and Latias are both great Fighting-resistant Pokemon that can help Zapdos in the long term. Latias does well at supporting teams that have trouble against Breloom while Gliscor can stallbreak archetypes that contain Skarmory and Clefable and check Tyranitar. Physically defensive Swampert can set up Stealth Rock and do very well versus Tyranitar, while Zapdos can switch into most Grass-type attacks aimed at Swampert. Physically defensive Skarmory also has great defensive synergy with specially defensive Zapdos and Spikes to compensate for Zapdos's minimal investment in Special Attack.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Agility",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Agility gives Zapdos a 2x Speed boost, which makes it devastating against offensive builds and can allow it to be a good late-game cleaner once its checks have been sufficiently weakened or eliminated. Hidden Power Ice gives Zapdos pseudo-BoltBeam coverage, enabling it to hit most Ground-, Dragon-, and Grass-types super effectively. This nearly perfect coverage helps Zapdos sweep easily late-game. Hidden Power Flying, on the other hand, can be utilized as a secondary form of STAB that hits Grass- and Fighting-types like Shaymin, Celebi, Breloom, Roserade, Machamp, and Infernape harder while also giving Zapdos a safe move to use against cores that include Electric-type switch-ins and lack Flying-type ones. However, its coverage is slightly worse overall. Roost allows Zapdos to better check Pokemon like Breloom, Scizor, and Gliscor. Heat Wave can be used over Roost to hit Steel-types like Jirachi, Metagross, and Bronzong as well as Mamoswine harder. However, dropping Roost makes Zapdos lose overall longevity.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>144 Speed EVs allow Zapdos to outrun neutral-natured Kingdra in rain as well as base 115 Speed Choice Scarf users after an Agility boost. Maximum Special Attack investment in tandem with a Modest nature allows Zapdos to hit as hard as possible. The rest of the EVs are put into HP for general bulk while minimizing residual damage. However, max Speed can be run to outspeed Timid Suicune, Heracross, Timid Kingdra, and Timid Rotom, although this cuts into Zapdos's bulk quite a bit. Pressure is Zapdos's only ability and is pretty situational on this set due to its generally less defensive approach, but it can potentially allow Zapdos to PP stall moves like Seed Flare from Shaymin and Leaf Storm from a multitude of Grass-types much faster. Leftovers make it so the omnipresent sandstorm doesn't wear it down and helps in bluffing a more defensive variant which leads to potential surprise value. It even allows Zapdos to recover health should sand not be up. Life Orb can be used over Leftovers if hitting harder when trying to sweep is more appealing, but this lowers the set's ability to bluff a defensive one and leaves Zapdos worn down very easily, especially if sand is up.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to keep Stealth Rock off the field so Zapdos is easier to bring in and less forced to use Roost and give up momentum. Attempt to wear down and remove Zapdos's countermeasures with entry hazards, other teammates, and even Zapdos itself so it can set up and sweep more easily mid- or late-game. Only set up Agility on forced switches, on Pokemon Zapdos naturally checks, and on Choice item users locked into an ineffective move. Also, don't reveal Agility until Zapdos is ready to pull off a sweep or if it needs to get off as much damage as possible on faster Pokemon for a partner. Should Zapdos have it, use Roost frequently to keep Zapdos's HP high throughout the game so it can check the threats it should be able to. Even after setup, using Roost is helpful to keep Zapdos healthy and uninhibited by most priority moves. While this set has a great matchup against offensive teams, it has a tougher time against more defensive teams that are less liable to being swept due to having more countermeasures for this set in general. In these situations, rely more on Zapdos's natural defensive utility and attack more frequently as opposed to setting up. Avoid letting Zapdos take heavy hits, and check for coverage on Pokemon Zapdos normally checks. as being worn down leaves it prone to being revenge killed despite its access to Roost and good bulk. If Zapdos is running Life Orb and sand is up, try to keep it on the field only for as long as necessary to avoid residual damage accumulating.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rapid Spin users are very helpful partners to remove Stealth Rock for Zapdos, which makes coming in, checking what it needs to, and setting up much easier, and its lessened reliance on Roost helps not give the opposing team free turns. Starmie in particular is an amazing partner due to its great offensive and defensive synergy with Zapdos; notably the two make for a good double Fighting-resistant core. Jirachi can handle Ice- and Rock-types for Zapdos while also setting up Stealth Rock to aid in sweeping. It can even get Zapdos in safely with a potential U-turn, while Zapdos can pivot into and handle Ground-types like Gliscor should it have the appropriate coverage move to hit them. Entry hazard setters can help this Zapdos a lot in wearing down its switch-ins, which is a big part in setting up a sweep. Stallbreakers like Taunt Gliscor, Taunt Gengar, Breloom, and mixed Dragonite all help break down bulkier teams this Zapdos has a tougher time dealing with and can even help give Zapdos an opening to clean up late-game. Grass-types like Breloom, Roserade, and Shaymin all handle Ground-types this set can't do much to without the proper coverage, like Swampert and Mamoswine and they also provide other support options in Spore in the case of Breloom and Spikes and Toxic Spikes from Roserade. Meanwhile, Zapdos handles Flying-types like Skarmory for them. Swampert, especially a mixed variant, has good offensive synergy with Zapdos and can pressure other Electric-types, Jirachi, and defensive Heatran for Zapdos while Zapdos can beat or set up on most of Swamperts checks, namely Grass-types. Water-types like Starmie, Kingdra, and Suicune all take advantage of the Ground- and Rock-types that can handle Zapdos as well as Heatran while Zapdos handles Grass-types for them. Most of these Water-types also resist Ice for Zapdos while Zapdos resists Grass for them. Physical attackers like Metagross, Infernape, Lucario, and Flygon love the fact that Zapdos can break bulkier Water-types for them while they can pressure special walls like Clefable and Blissey for it. U-turn pivots like Flygon, Jirachi, and Scizor can get Zapdos in safely. Zapdos works well on balance and bulky offense teams thanks to its blend of offensive and defensive utility. Good partners on balance include Breloom, Roserade, Jirachi, and Swampert, and viable partners for bulky offense include Latias and Heatran. Explosion users like Heatran, Azelf, and Metagross can all weaken Zapdos's checks and get it in safely. Zapdos fits well on dual screen hyper offense teams thanks to its typing and bulk making it hard to defeat, so screens setters like Uxie and Azelf make for good partners. Other Electric-types like Rotom-A and Raikou can form a good Electric spam core with Zapdos to wear down checks like Latias and Tyranitar. Tyranitar itself is also a good partner for Zapdos lacking Hidden Power Ice to trap Latias, which would otherwise be a nuisance, and it can also set Stealth Rock.</p> "

  "Moltres": {
    "overview": "<p>Moltres is a niche Pokemon in the OU environment. On one hand, it is possibly the best Scizor counter outside Ubers. On the other, it loses half its health whenever it switches into Stealth Rock, a common battle condition. Rapid Spin support is a must when using Moltres, as the damage is just too devastating to its survivability without it. Moltres fills a stalling role few others can but is all too often held back by Stealth Rock, so tread with caution.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Moltres can use Air Slash alongside Hidden Power Grass in an offensive set decently, but is outclassed by Heatran, who takes neutral damage from Stealth Rock and possesses a slightly higher Special Attack score.</p> <p>A lead Moltres with a Choice Scarf is viable, as many of the common OU leads are weak to Fire-type attacks, but they will likely switch out anyway, leaving you in against your counter. Aerodactyl, Tyranitar, and Swampert are fairly common leads who will probably beat such a Moltres as well.</p> <p>248 HP is preferred to simply maxing HP as it means Moltres can switch into Stealth Rock three times rather than two, which can be crucial in certain situations. Investing in Special Defense is viable as it helps you stall against weaker Surfs and Thunderbolts. 60 Speed EVs allow Moltres to outspeed 88 Speed Rotom-A, most Breloom, Adamant Scizor, and Adamant Tyranitar. 112 Speed EVs are enough to beat Jolly Tyranitar, while 160 Speed EVs with a boosting nature are enough to beat Adamant Lucario.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Water-types, as well as Blissey, do a decent job at countering Moltres, but will often get crippled in the process. Tentacruel is immune to Toxic, and thus can Surf Moltres without much fear of retaliation. The best counters to Moltres use Rest to eliminate poison damage and repeated Flamethrowers. Heatran makes a wonderful counter to Moltres <em>if he has Taunt. A Taunted Moltres will always be forced to switch against Heatran or just end up activating Flash Fire. RestTalk Suicune and Gyarados can recover off Toxic damage, and also use Calm Mind and Dragon Dance, respectively, to sweep. Snorlax with Thick Fat takes next to no damage from Moltres and can use Curse to set up on it. When poison has taken its toll, he can then use Rest to recover his health. Tyranitar makes a decent switch-in to Moltres as he does not fear Flamethrower and can use Stone Edge to easily OHKO Moltres. Be wary of Pressure stalling, however. Curse Tyranitar is a wonderful counter to Moltres. The sandstorm that Tyranitar brings also greatly limits Moltres's ability to continuously stall Pokemon. Dragonite can come in on a Flamethrower, but usually fears Toxic.</p> ",

        "name": "SubRoost",
        "description": "<p>Unique typing coupled with good defenses allows Moltres to stall out many defensive Pokemon with Toxic, even in the OU metagame. Flamethrower is a reliable STAB move which hits nearly every Pokemon immune to Toxic super effectively. Roost recovers your HP in a pinch, and removes Moltres's Electric-type weakness and grants Moltres a resistance to Ice-type attacks. Substitute helps Moltres stall out attacks such as Stone Edge and also guards against status. If your team uses Toxic Spikes, Roar can replace Toxic so that you can rid yourself of annoying RestTalkers such as Gyarados and Suicune. However, you may still want to keep the status move so Moltres can better harm Pokemon not affected by Toxic Spikes, such as Gliscor.</p> <p>A combination of Toxic, Roost, and Substitute allows Moltres to defeat walls such as Vaporeon, Blissey, and Gliscor with a little prediction. Since it resists Fighting-, Steel-, Bug-, and Fire-type attacks, Moltres is able to counter Scizor, Jirachi, Infernape (if he lacks Stone Edge), and numerous other physical attackers without many drawbacks. Scizor cannot break Moltres's Substitute with Bullet Punch, meaning Moltres can switch in (even on Stealth Rock), set up a Substitute on the likely switch, and Roost off the damage. An Adamant Lucario's Swords Danced Life Orb Close Combat will only 2HKO, so if the foe doesn't have Stone Edge, Moltres makes a good counter to Lucario as well.</p> <p>Moltres's biggest problem (other than Stealth Rock) is the competition it faces for a team slot. Heatran and Zapdos are two other common Toxic stall Pokemon, both possessing a Fire-type attack as well. Heatran, however, lacks reliable recovery, which Moltres has in the form of Roost. Zapdos lacks Fire-type STAB, which enables Moltres to beat the standard RestTalk Rotom-A. Zapdos can only hurt it with an unSTABed Fire-type attack or a resisted Electric-type attack. Fire-type STAB also allows Moltres to defeat Celebi and OHKO Lucario. Gliscor is immune to Thunderbolt and can Roost off Zapdos' Heat Wave without a problem, but will have some trouble stalling out Moltres, even with Taunt blocking Toxic. This is due to STAB Flamethrower having a chance to 2HKO Gliscor.</p> <p>A Heatran locked into a move by a Choice item is walled by Moltres, not the other way around. A Specs Fire Blast does less than 50%, and Pressure burns up Fire Blast's PP faster than napalm on top of a flame. Even if Heatran comes in on a Flamethrower, Moltres can still Roost or Substitute while he attacks and Pressure the Fire Blasts away. Moltres's time will be largely focused on putting up another Substitute or Roosting, and in the lulls between these turns, it can Toxic Heatran to waste time. Moltres also beats RestTalk versions of Heatran, as they need to be damaged to Rest in the first place. Without being able to Rest, Heatran is forced to attack--almost as if he were Taunted--as Pressure slowly chokes his attacks. Since Choice Specs Heatran can't even beat Moltres, this strain of Heatran is going to do even less.</p> <p>If Moltres is ever facing a Blissey, Moltres usually stalls Blissey out of her Seismic Toss PP with Pressure, Substitute, and Roost. Ice Beams usually don't break a Substitute, and Flamethrowers can't even in two hits. Even if Blissey has Thunderbolt, Moltres can still win, as Roost removes its Electric-type weakness while healing itself. Blissey's only chance to win is to either predict a Roost and status Moltres with Toxic, or use Calm Mind and Thunderbolt. Landing a Thunder Wave will also help, but paralysis doesn't quite stop Moltres (although getting fully paralyzed at a vital point quickly gets annoying). Vaporeon is also a great partner to Moltres as he counters Suicune and Gyarados well. Vaporeon can also pass Wish to Moltres, healing off Stealth Rock damage the very turn you switch in.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>For years, Feraligatr has been unable to distinguish itself in a metagame where Gyarados dominated. In the 4th generation, Feraligatr still struggles to make it onto a competitive team due to its lack of any outstanding stats. Feraligatr does manage to differentiate itself from Gyarados, however, with its neutrality to Stealth Rock and access to Swords Dance. While it lacks the raw power that Gyarados wields, it makes up for it with the capacity to boost its Attack twice as fast.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Feraligatr has a few additional moves that haven't been mentioned yet. Earthquake can be useful for hitting Metagross and Jirachi super effectively but otherwise has inferior coverage compared to Waterfall and Return. Feraligatr learns Dragon Dance, but that is better left to Gyarados, which, despite having a weakness to Stealth Rock, is faster, hits harder, and has Intimidate.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Most of the Pokemon that counter Dragon Dance Gyarados check Feraligatr as well. If Rotom-A is faster than Feraligatr, it can survive an Aqua Jet and KO with Thunderbolt. Slower Rotom-A variants need to be wary, however, as a +2 Aqua Tail may OHKO after Stealth Rock. Choice Scarf Rotom-A is a great revenge killer to take down Feraligatr after it has set up. Zapdos is in a similar boat as Rotom-A; if it outspeeds Feraligatr then it will surely win, but if not, it risks being OHKOed. Vaporeon can counter Feraligatr if it has Toxic or Roar, but takes a lot of damage from Return. RestTalk Gyarados is a great counter thanks to Intimidate and Roar to phaze Feraligatr. Shaymin and Celebi also counter Feraligatr well, but shouldn't risk using Leech Seed or Thunder Wave as Feraligatr can 2HKO with Return.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Feraligatr has always been in Gyarados's shadow in the OU environment. Feraligatr has Swords Dance to boost its Attack twice as fast as Gyarados, though, and priority Aqua Jet to hit faster foes. Feraligatr easily OHKOes defensive Rotom-A, who has next to no chance of OHKOing back with Thunderbolt, even after Stealth Rock damage. Even if Rotom-A tries to burn Feraligatr with Will-O-Wisp, Lum Berry is there to remedy the status. Return complements Feraligatr's Water-type STAB, hitting every Pokemon in the OU metagame for neutral damage, with the exception of Empoleon. Furthermore, Vaporeon and Suicune cannot do enough damage to Feraligatr before being forced to recover; Vaporeon is likely to be 2HKOed by Return, while defensive Suicune is 3HKOed. An unboosted Hidden Power Electric from either of them is only a 3HKO, allowing Feraligatr to get another Swords Dance under its belt. Aqua Jet is Feraligatr's weapon against faster Pokemon such as Heatran, Gengar, Jolteon, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar; however, you will need residual damage to guarantee the OHKOs on said Pokemon.</p> <p>Because of Feraligatr's pure Water typing, Electric-type attacks do not completely mutilate it like they do Gyarados. For instance, common revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Jirachi and even Life Orb Starmie cannot reliably OHKO Feraligatr. Another big selling point for Feraligatr is its ability, Torrent. Because of its natural bulk, many attacks can't do enough damage to Feraligatr to OHKO it, usually leaving Feraligatr with just enough HP to activate Torrent.</p> <p>Aqua Tail is a viable alternative to Waterfall; with it, Feraligatr can OHKO Rotom-A after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO Skarmory. However, if you use Aqua Tail for its added power, you will have to forgo Waterfall's perfect accuracy and the possibility of a flinch. Lum Berry is a good item, but it won't always help your sweep. Mystic Water is a useful alternative if you'd like a slightly smaller power boost to Feraligatr's STAB moves without the recoil of Life Orb. Life Orb gives you a lot of extra power, but sacrifices Feraligatr's natural bulk. A Jolly nature allows Feraligatr to outpace Naive Heatran, Adamant Lucario, and Adamant Gyarados. An Adamant nature is perfectly viable, however, as Feraligatr could use the slight boost in power against bulky Water-types. There is no need to max Speed with an Adamant nature, as Feraligatr is usually naturally faster or slower than the Pokemon in its speed tier. Pokemon such as Skarmory, Metagross, and Breloom rarely maximize their Speed, so Feraligatr only needs enough to beat defensive Rotom-A.</p> <p>Entry hazards are extremely helpful for Feraligatr, as they guarantee some vital KOs, especially those with Aqua Jet. With a layer or two of Spikes, Aqua Jet will have no problem OHKOing Heatran and Mamoswine after a Swords Dance. Skarmory and Forretress are recommended as partners for Feraligatr as they are reliable at setting up Spikes, but beware Skarmory's shared weakness to Electric-type attacks. Forretress can also set up Toxic Spikes to deter Celebi and Vaporeon, who can cause problems for Feraligatr. A Pursuit user will be extremely helpful, as Starmie is a big threat to Feraligatr; it is faster, can survive a +2 Aqua Jet, and can KO with Thunderbolt after some residual damage. Tyranitar brings in an unwanted Sandstorm, but if you don't mind that, it is a great choice since it can also counter the troublesome Zapdos and Rotom-A. Scizor is a decent check to Gengar and Starmie and can weaken enemy walls with U-turn. Gliscor can set up Stealth Rock, counter Lucario, and even lure in Pokemon whom Feraligatr can set up on, such as Gyarados, Suicune, and Vaporeon. If Gliscor uses U-turn as they switch in, you can get Feraligatr in completely unharmed and proceed to set up.</p> <p>Feraligatr can work well as a lure for defensive Pokemon so other sweepers will have an easier time sweeping. Gyarados often has trouble with Rotom-A, Suicune, and Vaporeon, but if you can weaken them with Feraligatr, Gyarados can then finish off the enemy team. A Pursuit user such as Tyranitar will be all to prevent both sweepers from succumbing to revenge killers. Choice Scarf Flygon would be most helpful as a revenge killer, absorbing Thunderbolts and checking Dragon Dance Dragonite. Heatran can be used as an additional lure, further weakening Water-type switch-ins with Hidden Power Grass while handily checking most Jirachi.</p> "

However, with Technician, he can deal large amounts of damage before the opponent can even move thanks to his priority moves. Hitmontop is also a great check to any form of Tyranitar, capable of either Intimidating to reduce the impact of physical blows, or outright KOing with Mach Punch. Unfortunately, he cannot do both effectively, as he fails to deal heavy damage with a defensive spread, and doesn't have as much bulk with an offensive spread. Hitmontop also fails to do anything significant outside of Rapid Spinning, whereas fellow Rapid Spinners Starmie and Forretress can. Nevertheless, Hitmontop does a great job at doing what he has to do: supporting your team both defensively and offensively.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There's not much that Hitmontop can do besides what has already been listed. Sucker Punch is an interesting choice, but Gengar will just set up a Substitute, defensive Rotom-A will just use Will-O-Wisp, and Choice-locked Rotom-A will just switch out. Toxic can be useful because of its ability to cripple Swampert and Hippowdon, but Hitmontop often has difficulty finding a spare moveslot for it.</p> <p>A Bulk Up set with Low Kick, Stone Edge, and a coverage move can be used, but with little immediate power, a lack of a recovery move, and his low Speed, Hitmontop won't be sweeping many teams.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Spikes-stacking teams don't really have anything to \"counter\" Hitmontop with since he is so reliable at spinning away entry hazards. However, they can switch in a faster and powerful Pokemon to force Hitmontop to take heavy damage if he wants to Rapid Spin. Alternatively, Rotom-A or Gengar can Trick a Choice item onto Hitmontop, preventing him from using Foresight and effectively crippling him for the rest of the battle.</p> <p>Physical walls can also check Hitmontop because of his inability to bypass them effectively. Metagross can Meteor Mash, while Skarmory can Brave Bird or Whirlwind him away. Hippowdon also does a good job at walling Hitmontop due to his access to Slack Off to heal off any Close Combats he might take.</p> ",

With this move in his arsenal, he can hit Ghost-type Pokemon with Rapid Spin and also damage them with Close Combat. Rapid Spin helps the team by removing annoying entry hazards, while Close Combat helps Hitmontop deal respectable amounts of damage; the drops in defenses don't matter much because Hitmontop will probably be moving second due to his low Speed. Stone Edge is there to deal with Flying-type Pokemon like Gyarados and Dragonite, while also hitting Gengar so he can't set up a Substitute. Rest is also another viable option for use on more stall-based teams, due to Hitmontop's great physical bulk allowing him to come in many times to absorb attacks. It can also be used to remove any status inflictions such as poison or burn, but must be partnered with a cleric.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Hitmontop to obtain maximum physical bulk. This, coupled with Intimidate, makes him a great Tyranitar counter. However, a spread of 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 SpD with a Careful nature may also be used if you want Hitmontop to come in on Rotom-A's attacks more easily. It allows him to avoid a 3HKO from Choice Scarf Rotom-A's attacks and also gives more buffer room against defensive Rotom-A.</p> <p>Low Kick can be used over Close Combat if you don't appreciate the drops in defenses from Close Combat. However, it does leave Hitmontop more vulnerable against lighter physical walls like Swampert and Vaporeon, along with other light Pokemon, like Shaymin and Jirachi. Sucker Punch can be used in the fourth moveslot in order to revenge kill weakened Pokemon, but is generally too unreliable to take care of Ghost-types. Mach Punch may be used to KO weakened Empoleon, Lucario, and Tyranitar; however, it only 2HKOes max HP Lucario and Tyranitar, and is fairly weak otherwise.</p> <p>Many Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon, like Dragonite, Gyarados, and Zapdos, appreciate Hitmontop as a partner due to his ability to remove Stealth Rock. Mixed Dragonite can switch in more easily and launch more attacks, while both defensive and offensive Gyarados can more effectively Intimidate opponents. Hitmontop and Gyarados together can run a double Intimidate strategy, meaning that physically-based Pokemon will have a hard time dealing damage. Zapdos can also wall more Pokemon as it no longer loses a large chunk of health every time it switches in. Hitmontop also has good defensive synergy with all of the above Pokemon because he resists Rock-type moves aimed at them. Scizor's constant U-turning means that he tends to take a lot of entry hazard damage, so he also appreciates having Hitmontop as a partner. If Hitmontop has Rest, then Pokemon that use Heal Bell and Aromatherapy are helpful partners. Some examples include Celebi, Blissey, and Togekiss. Hitmontop resists Celebi's Dark-type weakness, Togekiss's Rock-type weakness, and also has Intimidate to weaken physical attacks that target Blissey.</p> "

The idea of this set is to use weak priority moves that get boosted by Technician to deal damage before the opposing Pokemon can attack. Technician boosts both Fake Out and Mach Punch, and together the two of them deal effectively a 150 Base Power attack boosted by Life Orb. Mach Punch also helps out in checking Empoleon, Tyranitar, Lucario, and other weakened Pokemon. Close Combat is there to hit bulkier Pokemon such as Machamp and Bronzong, while Low Kick is an alternative if you dislike the drops in defenses from Close Combat. It does, however, miss out on a few notable 2HKOes on Pokemon such as Forretress, Jirachi, Shaymin, and Vaporeon. The last moveslot is used to cover Pokemon who shrug off Hitmontop's first three attacks.

Pursuit can be used to trap and KO Gengar along with Choice Scarf Rotom-A.</p> <p>Ironically, this moveset has difficulties against Spikers because Hitmontop can't Rapid Spin away any entry hazards. Therefore, Rapid Spin can be used in the last slot in case Forretress and Skarmory decide to get greedy with their Spikes.

If Hitmontop is using Stone Edge, then a Pokemon that can trap and KO Ghost-type Pokemon is a useful partner. Choice Scarf Tyranitar is a great choice as it can lock in and KO Gengar and Rotom-A. If Pursuit is chosen instead, then Pokemon that can check Gyarados and Dragonite are good teammates. Suicune and Vaporeon can check the two Flying-types, while Choice Scarf Jirachi and Flygon can revenge kill both of them.</p> "

  "Swampert": {
    "overview": "<p>Swampert is one of DPP OU's most emblematic Pokemon. Its unique Water / Ground typing gives it many desirable traits. It resists popular Rock-, Fire-, and Steel-type moves, it's immune to sand and Electric-type moves, and it's resistant to Stealth Rock. In addition, it can hit a wide variety of foes thanks to its access to Ground- and Water-type STAB moves with Ice-type coverage. However, Swampert is 4x weak to Grass-type moves, which several Pokemon carry specifically to target it. Despite this, it makes for an awesome offensive pivot that is able to check many prominent threats like Jirachi, Heatran, Metagross, Tyranitar, and Zapdos.</p> <p>However, Swampert does not have access to a reliable form of recovery, so it tends to struggle long term against strong attackers like Machamp and Infernape. Some Pokemon that Swampert checks decently, like Zapdos, Heatran, Jirachi, and Rotom-A, can also run status moves like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, which considerably hamper its durability. Swampert's low Speed and harsh Grass weakness can also be exploited by Breloom if it does not have adequate support or enough Speed investment, the latter of which comes at the cost of its bulk.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swampert's movepool isn't particularly vast, so it doesn't have many other decent options to work with. Interestingly, Swampert learns both Counter and Mirror Coat. While these could potentially be used to nab a surprise KO on unsuspecting attackers, they will be a waste of a moveslot if you fail to predict correctly, and they lose their effectiveness after Swampert uses them once. Thus, you're often better off sticking to more reliable moves. Swampert can utilize a combination of Substitute + Focus Punch, as it creates 101 HP Substitutes, making it a fantastic Clefable counter; however, Substitute must replace valuable coverage. It's also possible to run Focus Punch instead of Stealth Rock on offensive sets, making Swampert better at wallbreaking at the expense of losing utility. Swampert can use Blizzard when paired with Abomasnow, but Tyranitar is so popular that it's unreliable. Refresh is a decent option because there are some teams that highly depend on status to deal with Swampert. For that same reason, Rest is another option, but this is generally undesirable because Swampert becomes setup fodder while asleep. Toxic is a great option on both offensive and defensive Swampert sets. It can be used over Stealth Rock on offensive sets to make it even more potent as a stallbreaker, hitting a huge target in Milotic; on defensive sets, it can hit Hippowdon and Zapdos. Finally, Swampert can provide good support on a Rain Dance team, as many Rain Dance teams struggle with Tyranitar, which Swampert checks well. However, Swampert almost always has more worthwhile options to use.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Swampert's best counters are Grass-type Pokemon. Celebi and Shaymin both can switch into most of Swampert's attacks and OHKO it back with Grass Knot, Seed Flare, and Leaf Storm. Breloom also beats Swampert, as it can either use Seed Bomb against Swampert for the OHKO or opt to use Spore and then set up a Substitute. Roserade can force Swampert out and set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes. All of these Pokemon must be wary of Swampert's Ice-type coverage, however. Abomasnow is not weak to Ice-type attacks and can maim Swampert with a STAB-boosted Wood Hammer.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types cause problems for Swampert, as they resist Waterfall and generally don't take that much damage from Earthquake. Suicune is able to set up Calm Mind on Swampert and deal heavy damage with Hydro Pump or Surf. Defensive Starmie is able to spin Swampert's Stealth Rock away and can wear it down with Surf while restoring its health. However, some defensive investment is needed to do this reliably, as Swampert's Earthquake is strong, and a critical hit can quickly swing the exchange in Swampert's favor. Taunt + Dragon Dance Gyarados sets up on Swampert, prevents it from using Roar, and shrugs off Swampert's Ice-type attacks. Milotic can use Recover and tank Swampert's attacks relatively well while retaliating nicely with Surf. Vaporeon with Toxic is a major thorn in Swampert's side, as it is able to outstall Swampert with Wish and use Protect once it statuses it. Vaporeon's Water Absorb can enable it to answer Choice item sets well, and offensive Vaporeon sets can massacre the opposing team with powerful Water-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type moves: Unexpected Grass-type moves destroy Swampert, as its 4x Grass weakness means that any Grass-type move is going to hurt. Zapdos and Heatran can deal major damage to Swampert with Hidden Power Grass. Infernape, Latias, Starmie, and Jirachi make good use of Grass Knot, but they must also watch out for Earthquake and, in Latias's case, Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Status: Because Swampert has no form of reliable recovery, it detests status. As such, Rotom-A is a good check to Swampert because it is immune to Earthquake and is able to burn Swampert with Will-O-Wisp. Gengar can also burn Swampert; however, Gengar cannot take a Waterfall. Toxic users such as Jirachi, Heatran, and Zapdos can put Swampert on a timer and even use Protect to rack up poison damage. Toxic Spikes horribly cripples Swampert's longevity overall.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory: Unless running Hydro Pump, Swampert is vulnerable to Skarmory. Skarmory sets up Spikes on Swampert, as it is not able to hit Skarmory hard enough to deny the Spikes. Choice Band Swampert can induce flinches with Waterfall if it gets a little of luck, but most of the time, the armored bird can take advantage of Swampert and set up Spikes. Skarmory with Taunt is an even better counter, as it prevents Swampert from setting up its own Stealth Rock or phazing it before it can set up Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Strong attackers can overwhelm Swampert really quickly, since it doesn't have access to any form of reliable recovery. Pokemon like Machamp, Choice Band Infernape, mixed attacking Flygon, Lucario, and offensive Dragonite can hit Swampert considerably hard.</p> ",

        "name": "Physically Offensive Stealth Rock",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thanks to its good typing, decent attacking stats, high natural bulk, and access to Stealth Rock, Swampert makes for a great lead and an exceptional mid-game threat. It's capable of taking on many popular threats with ease, such as Tyranitar and Zapdos, and it can serve as a great offensive pivot.</p> <p>Due to these traits, Swampert can find plenty of opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Earthquake is used in the second moveslot, as it is Swampert's best STAB move, hitting any foe that doesn't resist it for a decent chunk of damage. Waterfall combines excellently with Earthquake, allowing Swampert to hit Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake, such as Skarmory and Rotom-A. Ice Punch enables Swampert to hit Pokemon such as Flygon, Dragonite, Latias, and Breloom super effectively; however, Swampert must switch out on the next turn versus Breloom if it does not have enough Speed investment.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The HP EVs grant Swampert decent overall bulk, enabling it to take most resisted and neutral attacks reasonably well. An Adamant nature with maximum Attack investment allows Swampert to hit as hard as possible. 16 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed foes like Clefable and uninvested Tyranitar, but feel free to invest more Speed to outspeed Pokemon like Tyranitar, Scizor, Skarmory, Nidoqueen, and even Breloom. However, although Swampert's Waterfall can potentially cause Skarmory to flinch with greater Speed investment, it loses the opportunity to land Earthquake as Skarmory uses Roost. Leftovers grants Swampert passive recovery, which allows it to check Jirachi more effectively, since Leftovers largely offsets Iron Head's damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switch into resisted moves like Iron Head, Stone Edge, and Thunderbolt to more safely set up Stealth Rock. Keep in mind that Pokemon like Tyranitar, Flygon, and Mamoswine can deal a significant amount of damage with their powerful STAB attacks, so don't overestimate Swampert's general bulk. This Swampert also works as a great early-game wallbreaker because it forces a lot of switches, and its coverage makes it pretty difficult for foes to switch in safely. However, Swampert requires prediction to wallbreak effectively because it's slow, and sweepers that carry Grass-type moves or strong STAB attacks such as Hydro Pump, Draco Meteor, and Close Combat can force it out, making you lose momentum. Waterfall is generally the preferred option to use if you expect your opponent to switch to something that covers Earthquake, such as Gengar or Rotom-A. However, depending on the matchup, Ice Punch is definitely worth considering, as it hits Grass- and Dragon-type switch-ins.</p> <p>On top of that, offensive Swampert is a good asset to break through a Skarmory / Clefable core because it hits other Pokemon paired with them super effectively, such as Tyranitar, Heatran, Jirachi, and Gliscor. If Swampert is paired with paralysis support, you should try to keep it healthy, as it can potentially break through defensive cores late-game on crippled targets that cannot safely heal. If Swampert is in Torrent range, it becomes an immense threat; Skarmory struggles even more against it, especially when Swampert is paired with paralysis support and can employ a paraflinch strategy.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Swampert is more effective on offensive teams that need a reliable pivot that conserves momentum. It has many viable teammates. Pokemon such as Latias and Heatran can be used to compensate for Swampert's 4x weakness to Grass-type moves and take on Celebi and Breloom, two of the biggest threats to it, though they must watch out for Thunder Wave and Spore. Also, Heatran needs to watch out for Fighting-type attacks from Breloom and even the rare Earth Power from Celebi. This is the reason why sleep absorbers such as Choice Specs Latias and Roserade make exceptional teammates. Moreover, Roserade can switch into most bulky Water-types with ease and set up Toxic Spikes on them, which further supports Swampert. An effective way to take advantage of Swampert's typing is to utilize a Fire / Water / Grass defensive core. Since Skarmory can check Swampert and find opportunities to set up Spikes, Magnezone also makes for a good partner, particularly if Swampert runs a lot of Speed, as it can easily switch into Skarmory, attempt to trap it with Magnet Pull, and proceed to KO it with a powerful Thunderbolt. Skarmory and Bronzong have perfect type synergy with Swampert. Skarmory can set up Spikes and switch into Grass-type attacks aimed at Swampert, while Swampert can switch into Electric- and Fire-type attacks aimed at Skarmory. Bronzong can set up Trick Room for Swampert, which allows it to get the jump on faster foes. Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Swampert pair nicely because Swampert usually does well versus Dragon Dance Tyranitar, which is the one setup sweeper Rotom-A cannot reliably cover; in return, Rotom-A can prevent Starmie from spinning, which Skarmory also appreciates. Swampert benefits a lot from paralysis support from teammates like Jirachi, Latias, and Zapdos, as it synergizes with Waterfall's 20% chance to flinch, and it helps to compensate for its lower Speed tier. Celebi also has access to Thunder Wave and can contribute to a Fire / Water / Grass core.</p> "

        "name": "Specially Offensive Stealth Rock",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Specially offensive Swampert is capable of taking on many popular threats, such as Tyranitar, Zapdos, Heatran, Jirachi, and Bronzong, with its access to STAB-boosted Hydro Pump and Earth Power. Many opponents expect Swampert to be a physical attacker, which makes it extremely good at luring and dealing massive damage to physical walls like Skarmory and Rotom-A.</p> <p>This set aims to act as a solid utility counter and offensive pivot. It is excellent at forcing switches, which gives it many opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Hydro Pump is the primary attacking move, as it punishes standard Skarmory extremely hard for a solid 2HKO, which stops Skarmory from setting up on Swampert while simultaneously allowing Swampert to threaten with Earth Power on a predicted Roost. It also deals solid damage to defensive Rotom-A, Bronzong, Bold Zapdos, and Bold Starmie. Surf is not worth considering due to its lower Base Power, missing crucial damage benchmarks against Gengar and Skarmory. Earth Power is a strong STAB move that threatens Metagross and Jirachi and provides great neutral coverage against Kingdra. Ice Beam provides excellent coverage and, in conjunction with Earth Power and Hydro Pump, enables Swampert to hit everything in DPP OU for neutral damage. Ice Beam can catch Celebi on the switch and force it to use Recover, which gives a teammate a free turn to switch in without fear of Thunder Wave. Also, Dragonite and Flygon are OHKOed by it, and offensive Latias is hit for a decent amount of damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature are needed because Swampert's Special Attack is a bit lacking compared to other specially attacking Pokemon in DPP OU. 16 Speed EVs enable Swampert to outspeed uninvested Clefable and Tyranitar. The remaining EVs are placed into Swampert's HP to maximize its general bulk. Leftovers grants Swampert passive recovery, which allows it to check Jirachi more effectively, since Leftovers largely offsets Iron Head's damage. Feel free to Speed creep at the expense of HP, because it could be extremely useful to outspeed Skarmory, Scizor, Nidoqueen, and Breloom.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Pivot into resisted Rock-, Fire-, and Electric-type attacks to find a good opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. Try to switch Swampert in as soon as possible. General bulk alone is not enough to eat powerful STAB moves like Choice Band Tyranitar's Crunch and +1 Dragonite's Outrage. This is why you should try to bring Swampert in on resisted attacks such as Stone Edge and Iron Head, or you will end up sacrificing it quickly. Swampert is incredibly effective at breaking through stall and balance teams thanks to its ability to lure most physical walls that expect a standard physical set. However, once you've revealed that Swampert is purely specially oriented, Clefable can wall it unless it is in Torrent's range. Typical Swampert checks like Rotom-A and Skarmory should be the main target to lure in with this set.</p> <p>Specially offensive Swampert is excellent at forcing a lot of switches, which gives it many opportunities to fire off Hydro Pump. Do not try to overpredict with this Swampert. Hydro Pump is generally the safest option because many teams tend to lack solid Water-resistant Pokemon. The only reason you should consider to use Ice Beam on a predicted switch is if you are running a slower Swampert and you suspect that your opponent has a Breloom, Celebi, or Latias. Otherwise, it's better to scout with Hydro Pump early-game most of the time.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As a bulky Water-type, Swampert works excellently alongside Grass- and Fire-types as part of a Fire / Water / Grass core. Roserade, in particular, works marvelously for its ability to absorb Toxic Spikes and status, which severely cripple Swampert, and set up its own entry hazards / Toxic Spikes, which Swampert supports by forcing switches. Similarly, other entry hazard supporters like Skarmory and Forretress also work well with Swampert; both Spikes users are 4x resistant to Grass and support Swampert's offensive pressure, while in return Swampert resists Fire- and Electric-type attacks. Physical sweepers, such as Swords Dance Lucario, Choice Band Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and offensive Trick Room Bronzong, benefit from Swampert's ability to heavily damage physical walls. Bronzong gets a special mention, as it can set up Trick Room for Swampert and has perfect typing synergy with it. Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Swampert are a great pair because Swampert checks Dragon Dance Tyranitar reasonably well, which is the one setup sweeper Choice Scarf Rotom-A cannot reliably revenge kill. If you are running less Speed, Sleep Talk + Choice Specs Latias is a decent answer to most Grass-type Pokemon, and it can absorb Breloom's Spore. Gyarados also gets a special mention, as it benefits from physical walls being worn down, while Swampert covers Gyarados's Electric- and Rock-type weaknesses.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Choice Band Swampert epitomizes the idea of bulky offense, retaining natural bulk while cranking its Attack up to astronomical levels. Waterfall and Earthquake are used on this set to form a solid STAB-boosted duo that allows Swampert to hit many common DPP OU Pokemon for large amounts of damage. However, although Aqua Tail comes with more power than Waterfall and the ability to 2HKO specially defensive Skarmory, this option is not worth considering due to its lack of a flinch rate. Stone Edge is used in the third moveslot so that Swampert has a way to heavily damage Gyarados, which will otherwise shrug off Swampert's attacks thanks to its typing and Intimidate; Stone Edge also hits Zapdos harder than Ice Punch, which is used in the final slot, enabling Swampert to OHKO Dragonite and Flygon. Ice Punch can also hit Celebi and Breloom on the switch, though Swampert must immediately switch out the next turn unless you determine that it will outspeed Breloom. Superpower can be used over Stone Edge, which gives Swampert good neutral coverage in tandem with its other moves. However, the Attack and Defense drops that come after using it will often force Swampert to switch out the next turn, which is an unattractive aspect. Also, Gyarados would become a perfect counter.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Speed EVs let Swampert outspeed Clefable, Tyranitar, Scizor, bulky Empoleon, and uninvested Skarmory, but you may want to invest a bit more to account for faster Skarmory. If you are willing to run a very fast Swampert, 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe is a great alternative spread to outspeed most Breloom and Rotom-A, hitting the latter with Waterfall before it uses Will-O-Wisp on Swampert. Attack is maximized with an Adamant nature and a Choice Band to give Swampert the maximum power it could possibly attain. The remaining EVs significantly boost Swampert's general bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Despite this set's massive power, you must have good prediction skills in order to use it effectively, as being locked into an undesirable move can shift the momentum in your opponent's favor. HP EVs alone are not enough for Swampert to take powerful STAB attacks repeatedly. Furthermore, there is no Leftovers to boost Swampert's durability, so it is even more fragile. Also, without Leftovers, Swampert will be especially more susceptible to Iron Head Jirachi. This Swampert set is an excellent early-game hard-hitter, since very few Pokemon can defend against its onslaught of powerful physical attacks. The fact that only a few Pokemon can take a STAB attack from Swampert makes it an excellent lure for bulky Pokemon. Do not hesitate to spam Waterfall to break bulky stall teams, since Pokemon like Skarmory and Rotom-A or any paralyzed Pokemon will struggle to restore their health against repeated Waterfall usage. Against more offensive teams, it can be useful to predict Ice-type weak Pokemon that tend to switch in Swampert, such as Breloom and Latias, and weaken them with a powerful Ice Punch. On the other hand, hitting predicted Gyarados, Abomasnow, or Dragonite switch-ins with Stone Edge is devastating if you manage to land it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As this Swampert will force a lot of switches, it is useful to provide it with entry hazard support. Swampert will also definitely need some defensive backbone, since its Choice lock means it will likely KO something and then be forced to switch. The two most common attacking types that are used on Swampert are Water and Grass. This makes any sort of Grass-type Pokemon an excellent teammate. Roserade makes for a decent option, as it can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes while defending well against most Grass- and Water-type moves. Also, Roserade's Natural Cure supports Swampert by allowing it to absorb status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Sleep Powder. It can even absorb Toxic Spikes thanks to its Poison typing. Heatran is also a great choice, as it is able to consistently set up Stealth Rock and packs a 4x resistance to Grass-type moves that will otherwise OHKO Swampert. Skarmory can also provide Spikes support, while offensive Bronzong can set up Trick Room, and both have perfect type synergy with Swampert. Magnezone can also help Swampert break through defensive archetypes by trapping and removing Skarmory. Paralysis support helps Swampert sweep late-game, since otherwise, something faster can force it out more easily. Pokemon like Zapdos and Jirachi work quite well with Swampert because they both have access to Thunder Wave and resist Grass. Celebi spreads paralysis while tanking most Water- and Grass-type moves, resisting Breloom's dual STAB move combination, and forming a solid Fire / Water / Grass core with Heatran and Swampert. As far as offensive partners for this set go, Choice Scarf Flygon and Rotom-A make great teammates, as they are capable of revenge killing many dangerous Pokemon that will attempt to set up on Swampert, such as Dragon Dance Dragonite and Gyarados.</p> "

        "name": "Tank",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This set aims to act as a solid utility counter and defensive pivot, taking advantage of Swampert's excellent typing and bulk. It is capable of taking on powerful Choice Band users like Tyranitar, Infernape, and Dragonite. In addition, it does very well versus Jirachi, Bronzong, and Metagross. Sadly, its lack of a reliable recovery move significantly hampers its tanking abilities.</p> <p>Swampert can set up Stealth Rock well due to its bulk and powerful Earthquake to keep spinners like Starmie in check. With high Defense and resistance to popular attacking types like Rock and Fire, it can set up entry hazards under many circumstances. Earthquake is Swampert's best STAB move, hitting anything that doesn't resist it for a great portion of damage. Ice Beam is used in the third move slot to enable Swampert to OHKO Flygon, Gliscor, and Dragonite after Stealth Rock damage. It also allows it to hit Grass-type switch-ins, such as Breloom, for super effective damage, though Swampert must switch out on the next turn. Roar is the primary option in the final moveslot, as it can be used to scout the opposing team and rack up residual damage from Stealth Rock. Protect can be used as a scouting move and can also aid Swampert in blocking Explosion from Metagross and Azelf leads and giving Swampert an extra turn to restore its health with Leftovers.</p> <p>As far as other options go, Swampert has a few choices. Stone Edge can be used in place of Ice Beam to dish out respectable damage to Gyarados and Dragonite. Hydro Pump and Surf can be used if you'd like a secondary STAB option for Swampert to use, which can be useful for wearing down foes like Skarmory and Bronzong, though you'd have worse coverage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>240 HP EVs maximize Swampert's Leftovers recovery and minimize damage from entry hazards and status. Also, the HP investment with Leftovers allows Swampert to always survive Seismic Toss from Clefable and Blissey five times at full health and gives it more all-around bulk. 216 Defense EVs grant Swampert exceptional physical bulk, letting it take most resisted and neutral physical attacks with ease. The remaining Special Defense EVs are used to allow Swampert to take neutral and resisted special attacks, such as Dragonite's Draco Meteor and Heatran's Fire Blast, more easily. An alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA can be used to maximize Swampert's physical bulk, but the extra Defense EVs don't accomplish anything specific, and the Special Defense investment is generally more useful.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Swampert should be used as a defensive wall and entry hazard shuffler early-game. Swampert acts as a decent lead, as it can put Stealth Rock up reasonably well against popular leads such as Zapdos, Metagross, Heatran, and Hippowdon and frail Choice Scarf leads such as Infernape and Flygon, and it can usually dominate most offensive Pokemon when it has the type advantage. Since Swampert does not have a reliable recovery move, it's important to bring it into Rock-, Fire-, Electric-, and Steel-type attacks that it resists. Swampert finds plenty of opportunities to come in thanks to its Stealth Rock resistance and sand immunity, which is great for balance teams. Also, Swampert's Attack is high enough naturally to use Earthquake as a way to pressure opposing Starmie, which helps maintain Stealth Rock and forces it to use Recover, which can give Tyranitar or Rotom-A an opportunity to switch in without having to sustain damage from a Water-type attack.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Swampert should be used on semi-stall and balance cores, as these are where its defensive abilities shine the most. Since Swampert can be successfully used on multiple types of teams, it has many viable teammates.</p> <p>On balance cores, Pokemon such as Scizor and Heatran can be used to compensate for its 4x weakness to Grass-type moves. Both can take on Celebi and Shaymin, two of the biggest threats to Swampert, though they must watch out for Hidden Power Fire and Earth Power. Mixed Dragonite and Infernape can take advantage of the Stealth Rock that Swampert sets up by forcing the opponent to switch through offensive pressure, which hurts the opposing team and gives your team offensive momentum. Another solid way to play Swampert is to utilize a Fire / Water / Grass core with Pokemon such as Heatran and Roserade. This will force the opponent to switch multiple times due to defensive synergy, racking up more damage from entry hazards. On the other hand, Sleep Talk users such as Choice item Latias and Choice Band Dragonite also pair well with Swampert, as they are able to switch into Grass-type moves with ease and absorb Breloom's Spore and Roserade's Sleep Powder.</p> <p>On more defensive teams, specially defensive Jirachi and Clefable make wonderful teammates for Swampert, because they can sponge special attacks that could otherwise spell doom for the mudfish Pokemon. They can also pass Wish to Swampert to keep it healthy, which can be a tremendous blessing because Swampert has no instant recovery move. Tyranitar is an excellent choice to consider thanks to its ability to shut down popular threats that appreciate taking advantage of this Swampert such as defensive Rotom-A, Starmie, Choice Specs Latias, and Celebi and punish them with its powerful STAB-boosted Dark-type attacks. In addition, it can summon sand with its Sand Stream, which helps rack up residual damage. On the other hand, since Swampert appreciates entry hazard stacking, a core with Skarmory and Rotom-A with Tyranitar in the back to trap Starmie makes for a solid defensive balance.</p> <p>Physically defensive Swampert tends to struggle against stall teams because it does not hit hard enough to actually threaten Pokemon like Skarmory, Rotom-A, and Clefable. The aforementioned Pokemon can take advantage of its passivity to set up Spikes, status it, or remove its Leftovers with Knock Off. Therefore, playing Swampert alongside stallbreakers can help mitigate this weakness. Breloom makes for a great partner, as it can form a solid Fire / Water / Grass core, if also paired with Heatran, and it can take advantage of slow bulky Pokemon like Clefable and defensive Rotom-A. As mentioned, Heatran also makes a decent partner, due to its appropriate typing synergy, but also for the fact that it can break through defensive Pokemon with Choice Specs and Magma Storm sets. Substitute + Pain Split Gengar also works well with Swampert. In addition to its ability to switch into Breloom's Grass and Fighting combination and into Close Combat from Infernape and Lucario, it can take advantage of Clefable by setting up a Substitute on a move like Knock Off, which can put the opposing team in a very bad position.</p> <p>Swampert also appreciates Rapid Spin support from Starmie, Tentacruel, and Forretress. Starmie is probably the best option because it is the most reliable spinner in DPP OU; it can check foes like Breloom, Taunt Gyarados, and Suicune, and wear down physical walls like Skarmory and Rotom-A. Swampert appreciates the support of other bulky Water- and Ground-types as well because they can act as emergency checks to Pokemon such as Flygon, Tyranitar, and Metagross, should Swampert go down to a powerful Choice Band-boosted Crunch from Tyranitar or a sneaky Grass-type attack.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Many people underestimate Swampert's Special Attack. Because of this, many would expect Swampert to be a bulky or Choice Band variant so it can catch foes like Skarmory, Clefable, Rotom-A, Latias, Metagross, and Breloom off guard with unexpected and powerful special attacks.</p> <p>Hydro Pump, Swampert's primary attacking option, is a powerful STAB move that, when boosted by Choice Specs, becomes enormously dangerous. Surf is not worth considering as an alternative to Hydro Pump because it makes Swampert considerably weaker and potentially causes it to lose many crucial KOs like on physically defensive Skarmory. Earth Power is a solid secondary STAB attack, hitting Water- and Steel-types for a great chunk of damage. Ice Beam and Hidden Power Electric provide additional type coverage, dispatching most Grass- and Water-types that resist both STAB moves, such as Breloom and Gyarados. Hidden Power Grass can be used if you wish to catch opposing Swampert for an OHKO. Alternatively, Swampert can be a decent sleep absorber with Sleep Talk. However, be careful about that option, because most sleep inducers are Grass-types, so it's extremely risky for Swampert to switch into them.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature raise Swampert's Special Attack to the highest possible level. The 84 Speed EVs allow Swampert to outspeed minimum Speed Skarmory, but feel free to invest as much Speed as you want, since most Skarmory tend to run a bit more Speed. The rest of the EVs are placed into Swampert's HP, thus retaining some bulk to take a few hits from foes like Jirachi and Metagross.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set's main selling points are its surprise value and ability to OHKO physically defensive Skarmory. Swampert makes for a decent wallbreaker, even as a lead. The fact that only a few Pokemon can take a STAB attack from Swampert makes it an excellent lure for bulky Pokemon that would use Swampert to set up entry hazards. Furthermore, Hydro Pump has a good chance to 2HKO Clefable, while Earth Power deals great damage to Water-type foes like Starmie and Kingdra.</p> <p>This Swampert is an excellent early-game hard-hitter, since very few Pokemon can come into its combination of special STAB attacks, but you must have good prediction skills in order to use it successfully. A single incorrect prediction could be catastrophic when using this Swampert, so tread carefully. Identify the type of team you are facing before choosing which move you want to use. Against defensive teams, do not hesitate to spam Hydro Pump early-game, as this is the move that will usually hit the most common Swampert switch-ins like Skarmory and Rotom-A the hardest. Once you have revealed that Swampert is running Choice Specs, you should try to predict which resistance —Water, Ground, or Ice— your opponent will bring in and use the best move accordingly. For example, using Ice Beam against an incoming Latias or Celebi can quickly swing a match in your favor. Against more offensive teams, you do not need to predict as much, because Hydro Pump should deal a ton of damage most of the time. Still, be careful about which move Swampert locks itself into.</p> <p>Swampert's bulk is not sufficient enough to take powerful STAB attacks repeatedly. Furthermore, Swampert is not running Leftovers to help it survive longer, so try to manage its health nicely.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since this Swampert's main purpose is to break through bulky threats, Pokemon that appreciate their removal make decent partners. Agility Metagross, Swords Dance Lucario, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Gyarados are excellent options to consider because of Swampert's ability to lure and remove Skarmory, Rotom-A, and bulky Water-types. A Celebi of your own has strong typing synergy with Heatran and Swampert. Toxic Spikes also deserves a mention for working excellently with the balance nature of the core. Roserade is a particularly good user of Toxic Spikes, especially as a partner to Swampert due to its resistance to Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks. Paralysis support works well to compensate for Swampert's lower Speed. Jirachi, Zapdos, and Latias make great options, as they resist Grass-type moves and can use Thunder Wave to spread paralysis. Offensive Trick Room Bronzong has great type synergy with Swampert, and the mudfish can use Trick Room to fire off powerful assaults while Bronzong weakens checks like Rotom-A and Gyarados.</p> <p>Physical attackers that resist Hydro Pump or Earth Power, such as Dragonite and Gyarados, can set up on this Swampert with ease. Choice Scarf Rotom-A can come in while Dragonite and Gyarados attempt to set up and scare them away with Hidden Power Ice and Thunderbolt. The same goes for Flygon, which benefits from Swampert's ability to wear down bulkier foes. Flygon is able to revenge kill most of the sweepers that will try to set up on Choice-locked Swampert.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Suicune, and Milotic can give this set trouble. Celebi can switch into bulky Water-types, force them to switch out, and use Thunder Wave or U-turn against the switch. Breloom is a great stallbreaker that can counter bulky Water-types by threatening to put them to sleep or hitting them with a powerful Grass-type move. Zapdos can also scare away bulky Water-types. However, both Breloom and Zapdos need to be careful when switching in, as bulky Water-types almost always carry Ice-type coverage.</p> "

        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>It seems surprising to think that Swampert could pull off a mixed wallbreaker set when there are offensive behemoths available like Dragonite and Infernape. However, with its Ground typing negating the damage from sand and giving it an Electric-type immunity and a resistance to Stealth Rock, as well as its combined Water-, Ground-, and Ice-type coverage, Swampert can pose a major threat to typical defensive and balances cores. Earthquake is Swampert's best Ground-type STAB attack, as it benefits more from its high base Attack stat and it hits foes like Starmie, Tyranitar, and Clefable for high damage. Focus Punch guarantees OHKOs against Clefable, Blissey after Earthquake damage, and specially defensive Skarmory as it sets up Spikes or attempts to phaze Swampert with Whirlwind. Hydro Pump does a huge chunk of damage against Ground-immune Pokemon like Skarmory, Bronzong, and Rotom-A, while Ice Beam hits Ground-, Dragon-, and Grass-types super effectively.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Brave nature increases Swampert's Attack and preserves its good natural bulk. 216 Attack EVs make Swampert's Earthquake extremely powerful and also allow it to OHKO Clefable with Focus Punch. 100 Special Attack EVs give Swampert enough power to 2HKO defensive Rotom-A and Skarmory with Hydro Pump. 80 Speed EVs are used to outspeed uninvested Clefable. The remaining EVs are invested into HP to maximize Swampert's general bulk. Leftovers allows Swampert to check Jirachi significantly more effectively, since it largely offsets Iron Head's damage. An alternative spread with a lot more Speed EVs and a Naughty nature can be used to try to outpace foes such as Skarmory and Breloom, although the lack of bulk considerably hampers Swampert's survivability.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mixed attacking Swampert is meant to break through defensive cores, namely the common Nidoqueen / Skarmory / Clefable and Hippowdon / Skarmory / Clefable archetypes. They often pack Rotom-A or Tyranitar for entry hazard control and additional Fighting-type switch-ins such as Gliscor, Zapdos, and Starmie, which all have a really hard time defending against this Swampert. You need to pressure defensive teams as much as possible early-game before Spikes and Toxic Spikes are on the field, or your opponent will have an easier time dealing with Swampert. Swampert finds plenty of opportunities to pivot, so maintaining Stealth Rock will especially benefit it. Try to force as many switches as possible and punish them with good prediction. If Swampert is facing Clefable or Blissey, weaken them with Earthquake, and then use Focus Punch on the predicted Soft-Boiled.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As a bulky Water-type, Swampert works nicely alongside Fire- and Grass-types as part of a Fire / Water / Grass core. Roserade, in particular, works marvelously for its ability to remove Toxic Spikes on entry, which severely cripples Swampert, and set up its own Spikes, which works well thanks to Swampert's ability to force switches. Other entry hazard supporters, such as Skarmory and Forretress, also work well with Swampert. Since Swampert is quite slow, paralysis support helps to find more opportunities to come in and land a free hit on crippled targets. Therefore, running teammates like Jirachi and Zapdos is effective, as they can both induce paralysis; in return, Swampert resists Fire- and Rock-type moves. Latias, especially a Choice Specs variant with Sleep Talk, is a great choice because it can switch into Breloom and absorb Spore while resisting Grass- and Fighting-type moves. Tyranitar and Swampert pair amazingly together, as Tyranitar benefits tremendously from Swampert's ability to lure in and wear down physical walls; in return, Tyranitar can KO Latias, Starmie, Celebi, and Rotom-A, which all otherwise give Swampert trouble. In addition, Tyranitar sets up sand, which helps wear down bulky Water-types.</p> <p>Calm Mind Suicune, Kingdra, Gyarados, Empoleon, and Starmie can all pair nicely to form a Water-based offensive core, which works well because stall teams often do not pack a Water-resistant Pokemon. In particular, Swampert taking out defensive Rotom-A and weakening Skarmory can heavily benefit a Gyarados in the back. Water-types also synergize well together because they can weaken each other's counters; Swampert can even mitigate an Electric-type weakness and provides a crucial Rock-resistant Pokemon itself. However, beware of a potential compounded Grass-type weakness. Since this Swampert tends to break walls, sweepers such as Agility Metagross, Swords Dance Lucario, and Dragon Dance Dragonite are great teammates, as they have an easier time sweeping with bulky foes worn down. Bronzong also makes a decent partner to run alongside Swampert, since they both benefit from having Trick Room up; both Pokemon also have perfect type synergy.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With access to Curse and a good physical movepool, Swampert can be a dangerous setup sweeper when used correctly. With only one type weakness, solid defensive stats, and a handful of resistances, Swampert can always find opportunities to set up.</p> <p>Curse allows Swampert to boost both its Attack and Defense in one turn, and the Speed drop is usually inconsequential, as Swampert isn't exactly fast to begin with. Rest is used in the second moveslot to restore HP and cure status, significantly increasing Swampert's longevity. Earthquake is the primary option in the third moveslot, as it is a consistent STAB move that deals heavy damage to any foe that doesn't resist it. Waterfall is an alternative to hit Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake, such as Skarmory and Rotom-A. When running Earthquake, Ice Punch is a great choice in the last moveslot, enabling Swampert to dish out tremendous damage to threats such as Dragonite and Latias after just one Curse. A mono-attacking Curse set can be used with a move set of Curse, Waterfall, Rest, and Sleep Talk, which allows Swampert to retain its usefulness while asleep, but this gives it significantly worse coverage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>240 HP EVs enable Swampert to survive Seismic Toss five times with the help of Leftovers. 252 Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature allow Swampert to take neutral and resisted special attacks very well. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense, which helps Swampert to take a lot of powerful physical attacks after a few Curse boosts.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is generally better not to reveal Curse too early in the game. First, scout Swampert's counters, which generally are Grass-type Pokemon, Skarmory, foes with Grass-type attacks, Trick users, and Haze Milotic. Then, weaken them to the point where they can no longer switch into Swampert. Swampert should be able to find plenty of opportunities to set up on foes such as Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Zapdos. Bulky Water-types tend to struggle way more against this Swampert; even Dragon Dance Gyarados can lose to it if it does not have Taunt, and the same goes for Dragon Dance Kingdra, Starmie, and Suicune.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Good teammates for this set include Pokemon that can switch into powerful special attacks such as Roserade's Leaf Storm, which would otherwise KO Swampert. Steel-type Pokemon, such as Heatran and Scizor, are great teammates for this Swampert, as they pack resistances to the special attacks Swampert doesn't want to take, such as Shaymin's Seed Flare and Dragonite's Draco Meteor. A Sleep Talk user such as Choice Band Dragonite or Choice Specs Latias can make for a decent partner, as they can absorb Breloom's Spore and retaliate with a powerful Choice item-boosted attack, but they must be careful of Substitute on the switch. In particular, Choice Specs Latias does not want to take Breloom's Focus Punch.</p> <p>Jirachi gets a special mention thanks to its type synergy with Swampert and ability to spread paralysis, which supports Swampert's late-game sweep. Since Trick users will try to shut Swampert down, having something that can absorb it will support Swampert's sweep. Choice Scarf Tyranitar is a decent choice, since it is able to switch into Trick Rotom-A or Latias and trap them with Pursuit.</p> <p>A Rapid Spin user, namely Starmie or Forretress, can get rid of Spikes that hamper Swampert's ability to set up. Starmie can wear down Breloom, Celebi, and Latias with Ice Beam, while Thunderbolt lets it beat Gyarados and wear down Suicune. Roserade makes a good partner for this set, as it can switch into bulky Water-types and Grass-type attacks, which may otherwise cause this set problems. In addition, it can set up Toxic Spikes, which allows Swampert to outstall potential counters while setting up. Other Water-types such as Gyarados and Suicune work well with this Swampert, since they double down on weakening their mutual checks.</p> "

  "Regirock": {
    "overview": "<p>While Regirock appears to be an inferior Pokemon in OU due to its poor typing, which gives it weaknesses to common Grass-, Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks, it actually has a niche as an extremely bulky Curse user. Regirock has the greatest physical bulk in OU and very respectable Special Defense, especially with the boost from sandstorm. Regirock's massive bulk can help negate its bad typing and enables it to set up several Curses, Rest off any damage, and bulldoze through the opponent's team. Regirock also has decent Attack and near-perfect coverage with just Earthquake and STAB Rock Slide. To top it off, Regirock has a very handy ability in Clear Body, which stops Intimidate from reducing its Attack.</p> <p>Despite these useful assets, Regirock requires serious team support to function. A Sand Stream Pokemon is necessary and a way to deal with your opponent's Water- and Grass-types is absolutely critical. Regirock also has pretty stiff competition with Tyranitar for a team slot, as it has better Attack and Special Defense and even provides its own sandstorm. Despite these somewhat disappointing setbacks, Regirock is still very destructive if properly supported and played.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>In OU, Regirock doesn't have too many useful other options. Regirock could run a somewhat effective tank set due to its impressive physical bulk; however, its poor defensive typing and lack of reliable recovery really hurt its usefulness in that regard. It could also attempt to run a Rock Polish set similar to Agility Metagross, but it lacks the raw power and Speed that enable Metagross to wreak havoc and hit important Speed benchmarks, respectively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Grass- and Water-types, such as Suicune, Celebi, and Breloom, are a real pain for Regirock. Suicune and Celebi can set up on Regirock, while Breloom not only resists Earthquake and Rock Slide, but can freely set up a Substitute, put Regirock to sleep, and beat it down with its STAB attacks. Skarmory and Hippowdon can phaze Regirock without too much trouble, but can do nothing else; in a one-on-one situation, Regirock will almost always emerge victorious. Gliscor with Taunt and Toxic can counter Regirock as long as it doesn't have too many Curses under its belt when Gliscor comes in.</p> ",

After a Curse or two, Regirock will be able to take even super effective physical attacks with over half of its HP remaining. Should your opponent's special attackers be gone, Regirock will become hard to stop. When Regirock is running low on health, it can just Rest off the damage, wake up instantly thanks to Chesto Berry, and attempt a sweep.</p> <p>When using Regirock, it's inevitable that it will be compared to Tyranitar. Regirock has its advantages, however; it has superior Defense, lacks the 4x weakness to Fighting-type attacks, and doesn't have a weakness to Bug-type attacks. This enables it to come out on top against Gyarados, Dragonite, Lucario, and Scizor, all of whom Tyranitar loses to.</p> <p>Stone Edge is an option over Rock Slide, as the extra power is sometimes helpful at the cost of less PP. In the last slot, Sleep Talk is an option, as it allows Regirock to use Rest more than once without becoming set up bait, and lets it use Leftovers instead of Chesto Berry. Running Stone Edge becomes more viable due to Sleep Talk consuming PP for Stone Edge; however, running Sleep Talk over Earthquake gives Regirock a much harder time against Steel-types. The EVs can also be tweaked by investing in either more Defense or Attack should you want more physical bulk or attacking power, respectively.</p> "

With its Steel-type, it can resist many of the Dragon-type attacks flung around in OU, while simultaneously acting a general support Pokemon to the rest of the team. Registeel also provides a solid switch-in to many set up sweepers such as Jirachi and Celebi.</p> ",

Iron Head also provides Registeel a somewhat serviceable STAB attack that can be used to deal higher damage to Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Blissey.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Registeel is plagued by a pitifully low Attack stat which makes gaining KOes a hard task. Despite being able to check a fairly large portion of the metagame, Registeel is somewhat useless against Swords Dance Scizor, Spikes Skarmory and Forretress, and many bulky Water-types. Registeel is also weak to Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks, three of the most common attacking types in the metagame. Because Registeel can be such an important check to so many different kind of Pokemon, whittling it down with these super effective attacks will bring it down.</p> ",

This set serves to effectively check various threats without sacrificing general utility.</p> <p>This works either as lead or as a switch-in to check a threat. If utilized as a lead, be careful with common lead Taunters and lead Heatran, which tend to run Shuca Berry. Registeel will have no problem switching into Zapdos, after which it can Ice Punch / Earthquake (on a predicted Roost) to knock it out. Should Flygon or Zapdos carry high Defense or a Fire move, Registeel can easily deal with the threat by using Explosion. This can also surprise the common Choice Scarf Heatran by never getting OHKOed by Fire Blast and OHKOing back with Earthquake (with Expert Belt) very close to 100% of the time on a 4 HP / 0 Defense Heatran. Aside from checking these threats, it also supports its teammates by setting up Stealth Rock and Exploding on dangerous threats.</p> <p>The last moveslot is a matter of dealing with Heatran, Metagross, Jirachi, and Tyranitar switch-ins (all of which are common) with Earthquake, or the general usefulness of Toxic. Note that Toxic will help you deal with Zapdos, Togekiss, and non-Taunt Gyarados more effectively. As for the item, that is an issue of personal preference. If specific spreads don't suit your style, use Leftovers, and then shift the Attack EVs into the defenses. Since Registeel's Steel-typing is optimal for switching into Choice Specs powered Draco Meteors and the powerful attacks of Gengar and Magnezone, putting a significant amount into Special Defense is also a plausible option.</p> <p>Fighting-types appreciate the presence of Registeel, because of its ability to take care of Zapdos and Gengar, which is a major setback for sweepers such as Heracross. Registeel can even lure and KO Heatran, which is a great benefit for Pokemon such as Scizor and basically any Pokemon with a Fire-type attack.</p> <p>Registeel needs help with opposing Fire and Fighting-types, namely Infernape.

  "Torterra": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, one may perceive Torterra to be unsuited for OU play due to its exploitable weaknesses, such as those to common offensive types like Fire and Ice. In fact, one may question Torterra's merits over Metagross, who boasts much higher Attack and Speed stats, resists common priority attacks, and has a sizable movepool to work with, including a powerful Explosion as a last resort option. However, Torterra's Grass / Ground typing grants it a resistance to common moves such as Earthquake and Stone Edge, along with Stealth Rock, allowing it to switch in and out safely on most OU teams. Torterra's typing also grants it an immunity to Thunderbolt, and more importantly, Thunder Wave, something that many Pokemon would kill to have. Offensively, Grass and Ground complement each other very well. Torterra's STAB Earthquake can plow though some of the most common Pokemon in OU, such as Jirachi and Heatran, while its STAB Wood Hammer removes bulkier Pokemon from play, at the cost of some recoil.</p> <p>Despite its perks, Torterra still has trouble muscling though Skarmory, Forretress, Celebi, and Breloom, all of which are common in the OU metagame. If one plans to use Torterra, be prepared to pack a method of weakening the aforementioned Pokemon, or removing them from play entirely.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Rock Polish",
        "description": "<p>With Rock Polish, Torterra becomes a potent late-game threat due to its dual STAB moves and good Attack stat. After a boost, Torterra's abysmal Speed doubles from 232 to 464, allowing it to outpace and OHKO Choice Scarf Heatran and Rotom-A with the appropriate STAB attack. While Grass and Ground may seem like an odd combination of offensive types, they work very well together. Its Grass STAB move KOes bulkier Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Vaporeon, while its Ground STAB move takes down most of OU's more offensively oriented Pokemon, such as Infernape and Lucario, before they get the chance to OHKO Torterra or nail it for massive damage. That being said, you may find running Leftovers to be a viable choice as well, as it gives Torterra a bit of longevity and heals off the recoil from Wood Hammer, albeit slowly. However, it should be noted that without Life Orb, Torterra loses out on quite a few notable KOs, such as the OHKO on Vaporeon and Choice Scarf Rotom-A after Stealth Rock, as well as the 2HKO on Gliscor.</p> <p>Max Speed with a Jolly nature places Torterra at 232 Speed, outpacing everything up to and including Adamant Scizor before a Rock Polish, and Pokemon with base 90 Speed holding a Choice Scarf after. Those numbers are important, as many Pokemon in OU try to take advantage of Torterra's low Speed; however, if Speed is of little concern, then an Adamant nature can work as well. With an Adamant nature, Torterra gains the ability to reliably OHKO and 2HKO more Pokemon, such as Suicune, Kingdra, and Blissey, while still maintaining enough Speed to outpace all forms of Heatran. Unfortunately, the boost in power doesn't make much of a difference since Torterra typically cleans up late-game, when the aforementioned Pokemon are normally weakened enough to be KOed regardless of Torterra's nature. With that in mind, Seed Bomb is an alternative option over Wood Hammer if the recoil is unappealing, as it can clean up late-game very nicely once the opposing team is weakened. However, keep in mind that because Grass is mediocre offensively, it's very unlikely that Torterra will need to use Wood Hammer very often. Moreover, Wood Hammer is Torterra's only method of OHKOing Flygon after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>The final slot's purpose is to hit either Grass- or Flying-types for more damage. Return is highly recommended as most Flying-types in OU are neutered by Stealth Rock, while opposing Grass-types usually have a reliable method of healing themselves (i.e, Leech Seed, Rest, and Recover). Stone Edge, on the other hand, prevents the likes of Togekiss, Zapdos, and Gyarados from forcing Torterra out. Without it, Zapdos and Togekiss would otherwise stall Torterra out with Roost, or OHKO it with Heat Wave and Air Slash, respectively, while Gyarados can use Torterra as setup fodder thanks to its handy bulk and Intimidate.</p> <p>Torterra has quite a few other options for the final slot. Crunch is Torterra's best move for hitting Celebi, 3HKOing defensive variants and 2HKOing more offensive variants. Double-Edge may add to the amount of recoil damage that Torterra will take, but it should definitely be considered for the chance of KOing 4 HP / 0 Def Zapdos after two switch-ins to Stealth Rock, as well as OHKOing the standard Breloom after it has taken damage from two layers of Spikes. You also have the option of taking 80 EVs from Speed and delegating them to Torterra's HP for a bit of added bulk while still outpacing Choice Scarf Heatran, though despite the investment, there won't be any significant change to the amount of damage that Torterra takes.</p> <p>This set greatly benefits from residual damage so Torterra can KO Pokemon such as Suicune and Kingdra more reliably. Infernape and Metagross can provide Stealth Rock support from the start while almost always preventing the use of Toxic Spikes from Roserade. Heatran can provide Stealth Rock support outside of the lead position very well, especially when running Shuca Berry, effectively bluffing Choice Scarf. If you plan to use Torterra to clean up for a more defensively oriented team, then Forretress is a great partner. Forretress can spin away entry hazards that constantly plague Torterra, and can potentially open up holes in the opposing team with Explosion. Torterra also appreciates having Skarmory, Forretress, Bronzong, Gyarados, and Celebi out of play or weakened, making checks and lures for the aforementioned Pokemon fantastic partners. Choice Specs Kingdra is an excellent choice due to its STAB Hydro Pump OHKOing Skarmory and Forretress as they switch in attempting to sponge its STAB Waterfall and Outrage. Kingdra's STAB Draco Meteor also dents Grass-types to the point where Torterra can finish them off. Tyranitar is another useful partner for Torterra, as it's tremendously powerful and can feign multiple sets. BaitTar and Choice Band Tyranitar, with Fire Blast and Stone Edge, respectively, are very effective for luring Skarmory, Breloom, and Forretress while providing a bit of extra damage with permanent sandstorm.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is the key to this set's success; without it, Torterra will miss out on quite a few KOs, and won't be able to combat Flying-types very well. Heatran is very capable of setting up Stealth Rock, and it resists all of Torterra's weaknesses. Heatran is also able to handle Skarmory, Forretress, Scizor, Celebi, and defensive Rotom-A very well, while Torterra can take on the bulky Waters Heatran commonly lures in. Azelf can set up Stealth Rock as well and has the added benefit of preventing Toxic Spikes from being set up with Taunt, a powerful Explosion to punch holes in your opponent's team, and possibly dual screens to buffer Torterra's already usable bulk. If one's team has a more offensive pace, then one may want to look into Froslass or Smeargle for setting up Spikes. Both Pokemon can set up Spikes reliably and support Torterra with Destiny Bond and Spore, respectively; Froslass can even block Rapid Spin if it comes down to it.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Torterra has a wide array of offensive options to choose from, but only a handful actually work. Body Slam allows Torterra to potentially paralyze Choice Scarf Flygon at the cost of a moveslot. Swords Dance can double Torterra's already decent Attack, allowing it to fire off incredibly powerful Earthquakes and Wood Hammers, but Torterra's Speed is incredibly low, so it will be revenge killed very quickly. Superpower is an option to hit Blissey harder and is Torterra's strongest physical attack against Bronzong, but the stat drops make it a much less appealing option.</p> <p>On the more defensive side, Torterra has access to quite a few support and defensive moves that could potentially work. Leech Seed lets Torterra to heal off damage and abuse entry hazards, but other than boasting an immunity to sandstorm and access to Roar, it's outclassed by other Grass-types in this regard. However, Leech Seed does allow Torterra to heal off residual damage while maintaining its great damage output, so it deserves a mention. Synthesis can work, but the prevalence of sandstorm reduces its usefulness. Since Torterra can force switches somewhat well, Stealth Rock is a viable option if one lacks a reliable user of it. Stockpile is an interesting option, since after a boost, Torterra is capable of surviving even Life Orb Suicune's Ice Beam (assuming 252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Def with a Careful nature) and can strike back with Wood Hammer. However, it needs a lot of support, such as a Pokemon who can get rid of Toxic Spikes, Wish support, and a cleric. Tickle is another move that Torterra can use in order to force switches, since none of Torterra's common switch-ins enjoy having their Attack and Defense stats dropped a stage. Torterra also has access to both Reflect and Light Screen, giving it quite a bit of added bulk while supporting its team very well.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Skarmory can take any attack from Torterra and either hit it hard with STAB Brave Bird or proceed to set up Spikes and phaze Torterra out with Whirlwind. Bronzong walls Torterra outright, and can hit it very hard with Gyro Ball or Explosion. Grass-types in general cause Torterra problems as they resist both of its main STAB attacks. Breloom in particular can set up a Substitute on Torterra if Return isn't present and fire off its incredibly powerful STAB Focus Punch, or put another Pokemon to sleep with Spore. Forretress can take a few hits from Torterra and either spin away its entry hazards, set up its own, hit Torterra hard with its STAB Gyro Ball, or Explode.</p> <p>After a boost, Torterra can still be revenge killed by Jolly Choice Scarf Flygon and Jirachi, though the former can't hit Torterra hard without locking itself into Outrage or running Fire Blast. Flying-types such as Zapdos, Dragonite, and Togekiss must be wary of Stone Edge, but they otherwise check Torterra well with their respective super effective attacks. Gyarados can safely switch into Earthquake or Rock Polish and threaten Torterra with Ice Fang or Bounce, or set up on Torterra thanks to Intimidate. While defensive Rotom-H can't switch into Wood Hammer or Stone Edge without risking the chance of being 2HKOed, it can switch into Rock Polish or Earthquake safely and either burn Torterra or deliver a fatal blow with Overheat. Scizor can't switch into Earthquake or Stone Edge, but it can deal massive damage with a Choice Band-boosted Bullet Punch or U-turn.</p> "

With the ability to use both Swords Dance and Nasty Plot, Infernape is aided by its unpredictability and is very difficult to counter without knowing its whole set.</p> <p>Infernape's main drawback is its frailty. Just about any neutral attack will deal over 70% damage to it, and it will almost never survive a super effective hit. Not being able to handle Starmie and Gengar, two Pokemon who outspeed Infernape, doesn't help much either. Overall, Infernape is still a powerful threat, so underestimate it at your own risk.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Vacuum Wave is a decent option on special sets; however, most of what is faster than Infernape, bar Weavile, is not weak to Fighting and the loss of coverage by opting for Vacuum Wave is very significant. Either of the Fighting-type priority attacks will deal about 70% damage to Lucario, and hit before it can use Extreme Speed, so if your team has major Lucario problems then one of those may be a good idea.</p> <p>Focus Blast is available on the special sets and can OHKO Blissey with a Nasty Plot and Life Orb, but the 70% accuracy is a major turn-off, especially with the 100% accurate Close Combat as an option. Flare Blitz and Blaze Kick are interchangeable on the sets that use either; Flare Blitz has more power and full accuracy, while Blaze Kick does not cause recoil damage to Infernape's already low HP.</p> <p>Infernape learns Encore, and can sometimes use it to get free stat-ups. However, Infernape's fantastic coverage forces so many switches anyway that using Encore just to get a free turn is really a waste of a moveslot, and if you Encore on one of those frequent switches you will have wasted a turn as well.</p> <p>An all special, four attack Life Orb set without a Fighting-type attack can have some surprise value, as no one in their right mind will switch Tyranitar and Blissey into Infernape anyway, but overall the loss of Close Combat is too heavy. Despite hitting many Pokemon for super effective damage, the set misses quite a few OHKOs, and with Infernape's poor defenses and only 104 base Special Attack, it is better suited to strategic wallbreaking than trying to muscle through teams. Choice Specs is a viable option on Infernape; however, it is considered inferior to most of its other movesets.</p> <p>Infernape is a Pokemon in its own speed tier, and thus does not need to run max Speed to outspeed all threats. That having been said, given Infernape's fragility, there is no real reason to not max Speed on an all physical or special set, since Infernape is not likely to survive more hits with a few extra Hit Points, and that Speed may come in useful in the event of a mirror match or against random Choice Scarf Pokemon. The exceptions to this rule are the mixed sweeping sets, which drop down to 192 Speed EVs to score some key KOes and deal more damage in general. The only Pokemon whom Infernape will then fail to outspeed are Mismagius and other Infernape.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Water-types are the most common counters to Infernape. Here, the lighter the Pokemon, the better, as that means Grass Knot does less damage. Suicune's high all-around stats make it a great counter; however, like Milotic, it needs a reasonable Special Defense investment to take on Nasty Plot Life Orb Grass Knots. Gyarados can take on any Infernape which does not carry Stone Edge or Thunder Punch, but it needs a high HP investment to not be taken down by Grass Knot if your opponent has Stealth Rock in play. Vaporeon is a great Pokemon to switch into Infernape; not only does it have naturally high HP and decent Special Defense, but it is very light, causing only 60 Base Power from Grass Knot. Tentacruel is the best counter to one of the most common sets, the Nasty Plot sweeper, with a resistance to Flamethrower and Close Combat and high Special Defense to take neutral Grass Knots. Starmie is also a useful switch-in, as it is faster than and OHKOes Infernape, and can Recover off any damage taken in the process.</p> <p>Dragonite resists nearly every move the typical Infernape has. However, Infernape is faster and sometimes carries Hidden Power Ice for the sole purpose of taking down the popular Dragon.</p> <p>If you are sure that Infernape is physical or holding a Choice item, then Hippowdon and Swampert can take on Infernape. However, Infernape usually opts to use Grass Knot, so neither is a good initial switch-in.</p> <p>Azelf can come in on anything but Fire Blast or Flare Blitz and OHKO Infernape with Psychic. Aerodactyl isn't weak to any of Infernape's common attacks, and it has enough defenses to survive one good hit as it comes in, outspeeds thanks to 130 base Speed, and OHKOes Infernape with Earthquake.</p> <p>Moltres, by virtue of its typing, resists both of Infernape's STAB attacks and Grass Knot, and will take little from Hidden Power Ice as well. It can come in on most Infernape and scare it off with the threat of Air Slash. The only thing that Moltres fears is Stone Edge from physical Infernape, but if it is losing half of its health to Stealth Rock on the switch in, Infernape can usually overpower it with resisted attacks.</p> <p>With max HP, Cresselia cannot be OHKOed by Infernape even if it uses Nasty Plot or Swords Dance as Cresselia comes in; however, Cresselia will have little effect on Infernape without Psychic or Thunder Wave. Togekiss has the defenses to take a Nasty Plotted Fire Blast or a Close Combat and can OHKO back with Air Slash. It needs 252 HP, 120 Special Defense, and a Calm nature to survive Nasty Plot Life Orb Fire Blast from Naive Infernape 100% of the time.</p> <p>Infernape is extremely frail, so it has difficulties switching in except after one of its team members faints. As long as you are throwing out attacks that Infernape doesn't resist, it won't find time to come in. Additionally, if Infernape gets paralyzed, it will be of little use, so anything with Thunder Wave or Stun Spore can severely reduce Infernape's effectiveness.</p> ",

        "name": "Physically-Based Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>While this set may not have the super effective type coverage of the specially-based mix set, it does have several things going for it. Due to its high Base Power, Close Combat becomes quite a bit more damaging than on the special set, and this set's Overheat is very nearly as strong as the special-based set's Fire Blast (less than a 2% difference in damage). Stone Edge makes this set much more deadly against Gyarados, and when also considering the fact that Infernape's Close Combat will easily 2HKO Vaporeon and Milotic after Stealth Rock damage, it is clear that losing Grass Knot is not a huge blow. Mach Punch is a decent option over Stone Edge, ensuring that your team will not be swept by Lucario, and providing some insurance against Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Weavile, and Agility Empoleon as well.</p> <p>U-turn is really the key to this set, as it ensures that the few Pokemon who can safely switch into this set are dealt with by other members of your team. Additionally, max Attack U-turn allows Infernape to become a versatile early-game attacker, forcing switches to rack up Stealth Rock damage and scout the opponent's team. Keep in mind also that many of the primary switch-ins to Infernape are Flying-types; they will take 25% damage from Stealth Rock as you switch to a counter and force them to come in with under 50% health the next time. Even Starmie, who frequently switches into Infernape, will lose over half its health to U-turn, and you will be able to switch in an appropriate counter.</p> <p>If you are willing to sacrifice some physical power, you can move 80 EVs from Attack to Special Attack (for a total of 144), and give Infernape Grass Knot instead of U-turn. This will allow Infernape to 2HKO Suicune and Hippowdon, and OHKO Swampert most of the time. In effect, you exchange the scouting ability of U-turn for better coverage, albeit with less physical power.</p> <p>As alluded to earlier, very few Pokemon can come in on this set safely, but due to the physical nature of this Infernape, it is more vulnerable to Intimidate than the other sets. As a result, bulky Gyarados will often attempt to turn you into setup fodder, so it can't be emphasized enough just how important Stealth Rock is when using this set, as it will allow you to 2HKO Gyarados, even after Intimidate. The primarily physical nature of this set also allows this Infernape to lure out physical walls, such as Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Weezing, who wouldn't dream of switching in on the previous sets. Because of this, an ideal offensive partner would be one that could benefit from the weakening or removal of such physical walls. Lucario, Heracross, and Tyranitar are all fine choices.</p> "

        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<p>Infernape's versatility and wide movepool allow it to be a constant threat. This set utilizes Infernape's access to the move Nasty Plot, which doubles its Special Attack stat, and allows it to make the most of its two 120 Base Power STAB attacks. The basis of this set is to use Infernape's ability to force a switch and set up on the free turn. After a Nasty Plot, Infernape has two extremely powerful STAB attacks at its disposal in Fire Blast and Focus Blast. They both have a massive 120 Base Power, but have shaky accuracy at 85% and 70%, respectively. With a Nasty Plot under its belt, Infernape has a chance of OHKOing Gyarados with Fire Blast after it has taken Stealth Rock damage. The last move is up to personal preference, as they both have their own advantages and disadvantages. Vacuum Wave is a STAB attack that can give you priority against Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Heatran and Tyranitar and enemy priority users such as Lucario. On the other hand, Grass Knot gives you a reliable way to deal with bulky Water-type Pokemon, such as Swampert, Suicune, and Vaporeon, as opposed to relying the inaccurate Focus Blast or an unboosted Close Combat.</p> <p>If the poor accuracy of Fire Blast and Focus Blast are unfavorable to you, there is always the option of using Flamethrower and Close Combat. Flamethrower is an 100% accurate Fire-type move that comes at the cost of only having 95 Base Power. The lack of damage that this move deals can be made up for with it having the guaranteed hit, but you will miss out on some OHKOs such as against Gyarados. Close Combat is also an option over Focus Blast that can deal with special walls such as Blissey and Snorlax. If you opt for Close Combat, be sure to change the nature to Naive. With it, you will do a minimum of 104% on the standard 24 HP / 252 Def Calm Blissey; beware though, as you will lose the ability to hit bulky Water-type Pokemon unless you opt for Grass Knot as the third choice. However, if you opt for Grass Knot, you lose the ability to OHKO Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Choice Scarf Heatran, and Lucario, all of whom will jump at the opportunity to ruin a sweep.</p> <p>Starmie can use its typing and relative bulk to stop this set in its tracks. It has the Speed to outpace Infernape, and has access to Water-type attacks that can OHKO Infernape with ease. To make things worse, Starmie has access to reliable recovery in the form of Recover. For the above reasons, Starmie makes a solid check to Nasty Plot Infernape. It is recommended that you couple Infernape with a sturdy Pokemon capable of using Pursuit, such as Tyranitar, Scizor, Snorlax, or Metagross. Rapid Spin support is also never a bad thing to have as Life Orb recoil, entry hazards, and the ever-present sandstorm can really take their toll on Infernape's health.</p> "

        "name": "Specially-Based Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This set is similar to the Nasty Plot set, except that instead of attempting to set up, you drop Nasty Plot in order to gain better coverage with both Grass Knot and Hidden Power Ice. While the previous set is most useful as a wallbreaker against stall teams, this set is more useful against balanced and offensive teams, which often cannot avoid a 2HKO when switching out of this set.</p> <p>Choosing which moves you keep hidden is a useful trick for this Infernape. If you show your opponent Grass Knot and Fire Blast, they may switch in Dragonite or Flygon, expecting to wall your set, but receiving a swift OHKO via Hidden Power Ice instead. With the Fire-, Fighting-, Grass-, and Ice-type move combination, Infernape attains perfect type coverage; it will deal at least neutral damage to every Pokemon in the game.</p> <p>You need to be aware of the problem Pokemon listed for the previous set, but without the +2 boost provided by Nasty Plot, Vaporeon also becomes a very annoying adversary. Its low weight and high HP allow it to shrug off Grass Knot with ease and OHKO Infernape in return. Celebi with Psychic is a particularly useful partner for this variant of Infernape, as it can easily come in on Vaporeon, Starmie, and Tentacruel and threaten them with super effective STAB attacks. However, it should be noted that Celebi will need to invest heavily in Special Attack or forgo Grass Knot for Energy Ball or Leaf Storm if you want to do any worthwhile damage to Vaporeon. Celebi is also more than happy to take any Water- or Ground-type attacks aimed at Infernape. This Infernape works very well as a late-game sweeper, but if you choose to use it mid-game it's important to have an appropriate late-game sweeper to take advantage of any holes that Infernape leaves in the opponent's defenses. Dragon Dance Gyarados is a good example of such a sweeper, as it can capitalize on any damage that Infernape may have dealt to enemy bulky Water-types, such as Vaporeon and Suicune.</p> "

        "name": "Lead",
        "description": "<p>This Infernape is the most effective offensive attacking lead packing Fake Out. It is guaranteed to get Stealth Rock up against every common lead, bar Aerodactyl, and all the other leads, besides Hippowdon, will be defeated in the process. The idea is to use Fake Out on the first turn to render the opponent's Focus Sash useless, and then either attack or lay down Stealth Rock as the opponent does the same, while carrying the advantage of still holding Focus Sash. Naive Azelf will always be KOed by Fire Blast, and some other leads, such as Tyranitar and Jirachi, are obviously not great at taking Infernape's attacks.</p> <p>Fire Blast and Close Combat finish off the set with two powerful, 120 Base Power STAB moves. Focus Sash allows you to easily activate Infernape's Blaze ability, increasing Fire Blast's already massive damage by 50%. Close Combat is not only very powerful, but also has good type coverage together with Fire Blast.</p> <p>Encore is an option over Close Combat, but it is really only effective against slow leads. Given the excellent coverage and power of Close Combat, the only reason to use Encore would be if your team is exceptionally weak to stall teams. Infernape can also skip running Stealth Rock and bring Grass Knot for better type coverage. A combination of Fake Out and Grass Knot maims offensive Starmie in the lead position and leaves an enormous dent in leading Hippowdon. This can be especially useful for offensive teams that can bring Stealth Rock elsewhere on the team, but prefer to get the jump on these otherwise troublesome leads. The EV spread allows for 330 Speed, which outruns all base 100 Speed Pokemon and any base 115 Speed Pokemon with a neutral Speed nature.</p> <p>The only conventional leads you're going to lose to are Aerodactyl and Hippowdon, but Infernape will also struggle against those it can't do significant damage to, so don't be scared to switch out. Also be wary of the rare Inner Focus leads, such as Alakazam, Lucario, and Crobat, as they will absorb Fake Out and deal heavy damage in return.</p> <p>This Infernape should be used on offensive teams to gain momentum, so Pokemon that can take advantage of Stealth Rock in their sweep and have good synergy with Infernape are always advisable. For example, an offensive Gyarados makes a great accomplice because it takes full advantage of Stealth Rock and puts a lot of pressure on the opponent.</p> "

        "name": "Endeavor Lead",
        "description": "<p>Endeavor and Vacuum Wave, when paired together with Focus Sash, provide an unusual twist to Infernape's mixed sweeper stats. After it sets up Stealth Rock, the fragile Infernape will likely take a hit that would be lethal, but Focus Sash will leave it at 1 HP. Endeavor will bring the opponent's Pokemon to 1 HP, and it can then be quickly dispatched with Vacuum Wave. Even if Infernape is KOed in the process, you can easily send out a faster Pokemon or one with a priority move to finish off the severely damaged foe. Note that if the opponent's Pokemon is faster than Infernape, then you must use Endeavor on the same turn that Infernape is attacked. You must also watch out for Hippowdon, Tyranitar, and Abomasnow, which will set up damaging weather, which will KO Infernape on the turn it takes damage.</p> <p>Mach Punch may not seem like a bad idea, but the split in EVs that is needed to boost the power of both Mach Punch and Overheat / Fire Blast will cause Infernape to lose crucial OHKOs, most notably against opposing leads such as Bronzong, which is why Vacuum Wave is recommended. It should be mentioned that Vacuum Wave lacks the power to 2HKO max HP / 0 SpD Tyranitar; however, Tyranitar will likely not stay in on Infernape anyway. Additionally, Overheat is recommended over Fire Blast; despite the power drop it causes, it allows Vacuum Wave to KO most Bronzong after a single Fire-type attack.</p> <p>With Focus Sash providing Infernape with a safety net against most attacks, the practical thing to do is maximize Speed and Special Attack in order to add as much force to Infernape's attacks as possible. Infernape's IVs in its Defense, Special Defense, and HP should all be set to 0. Enemy attacks will hit much harder, and it will ensure that Infernape's HP is as low as possible when using Endeavor without a Focus Sash activation. This set only runs 504 EVs, since adding the extra EVs anywhere else will increase Infernape's defenses.</p> <p>This set is a dedicated suicide lead in that it's definitely not supposed to live through the battle. For this reason, you can't really \"support\" this Infernape in the traditional sense of the word. Instead, you can take advantage of the Stealth Rock that Infernape sets up with fast, offensive Pokemon. Some examples include Gyarados and Lucario.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>With a physical 120 Base Power STAB move (and maybe even two with Flare Blitz), Swords Dance Infernape is a major threat in terms of both sweeping and wallbreaking. After a Swords Dance, Close Combat will OHKO both Vaporeon and 252 HP / 0 Def Tentacruel, assuming Stealth Rock is in play, and Stone Edge will take out Dragonite, Gyarados, and Zapdos. Since all of these are common Infernape switch-ins, you usually will not have to worry about them switching out of your lethal attacks.</p> <p>Flare Blitz can be a useful choice if you want to use Infernape for wallbreaking, but overall, Fire Punch is better since it scores the same OHKOs after a Swords Dance without causing recoil. Fire Punch easily OHKOes anything that it deals super effective damage to after a Swords Dance, and Close Combat and Stone Edge will clean up everything else. While Stone Edge is preferred for coverage, Mach Punch should really not be overlooked as an option. Mach Punch ensures that your team will not be swept by Swords Dance Lucario; it also has a chance to OHKO Heatran, and it is generally useful for taking down random fast Pokemon as well as Choice Scarf users at low HP.</p> <p>If you do not want to rack up recoil damage from Life Orb, Black Belt is a decent alternative. The increase in power granted to Close Combat, Infernape's main form of attack, is only slightly less than that from Life Orb, and it can boost Mach Punch as well. A third option is to use Wide Lens and give Infernape Blaze Kick over Fire Punch, which will result in only a small drop in Fire-type attacking damage, due the increase in Base Power. Blaze Kick and Stone Edge will have their accuracies increased to 99% and 88%, respectively, and Infernape will still be guaranteed to OHKO Zapdos, Gyarados, and Dragonite with Stone Edge after a Swords Dance (factoring in both Stealth Rock damage and Intimidate), though it will lose its OHKOes on Vaporeon and Milotic, and its chance at an OHKO on Swampert.</p> <p>The destructive power this set wields is frightening, but without any special attacks, you can still run into trouble with dedicated physical walls. Hippowdon and Donphan, for example, can easily survive a +2 Life Orb Close Combat and dispatch Infernape with Earthquake. Suicune and Slowbro can use their high Defense and STAB attacks to a similar effect. Once again, Celebi is of great assistance here, as it can switch into the four aforementioned Pokemon with impunity and begin to fire off Grass Knots. If Celebi isn't convenient to your team then you can use a dedicated lure, such as mixed Metagross. Metagross will lure in physical walls, such as the aforementioned Hippowdon and Donphan, and defeat them with Grass Knot (or other special attacks). Toxic Spikes are also an effective method of wearing down the aforementioned counters. Roserade can set them up effectively and also absorb special Water-type attacks aimed at Infernape.</p> "

Almost no Pokemon in OU can avoid a 2HKO from either Close Combat or Flare Blitz without resisting it, and everything that resists both of those is taken out by Stone Edge. U-turn allows Infernape to scout the opponent's team, deal some Stealth Rock damage as the opponent switches, and hit common switch-ins such as Starmie and Cresselia for super effective damage.</p> <p>Thunder Punch is an option over Stone Edge or U-turn if you really do not like Gyarados, but the loss of scouting ability from U-turn or the loss of coverage from Stone Edge is significant. Additionally, a 75 Base Power Electric-type attack is a dangerous thing to be locked into, since even Pokemon that do not carry resistance or immunity take little damage, and they can use the opportunity to set up. As with previous sets, Mach Punch can also be used if you're in need of insurance against Lucario.</p> <p>Be cautious about throwing around your STAB attacks too early as they provide a perfect opportunity for Gyarados or Dragonite to come in and begin to set up. A timely Stone Edge will bring them down, as will mounting Stealth Rock damage, but nevertheless, make sure your team can deal with those two, as you can never rely too much on prediction. A Choice Scarf Gengar makes a good revenge killer to both and its immunity to Earthquake can be handy.

Close Combat will 2HKO Blissey and Heatran, and easily OHKO any Tyranitar. U-turn is a great move, allowing you to scout what your opponent switches to, as well as hit Starmie for super effective damage. If you want to deal a bit more damage to the bulky Waters-types who commonly switch into Infernape, then Grass Knot is also a valid option.</p> <p>With a Speed-boosting nature and 192 EVs, Infernape hits 495 Speed, which outpaces Jolly Choice Scarf Flygon and Jirachi. Special Attack is maximized and the remaining EVs are put in Attack to power up Close Combat and U-turn.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Infernape's main advantages over other speedy Choice Scarfers, such as Gengar, are Close Combat, which grants it an efficient way to deal with Blissey, and the ability to revenge kill Agility Metagross thanks to its Fire-type STAB. If you don't need those traits then you'll usually be better off with a different Choice Scarf Pokemon, as Infernape lacks the raw power without Life Orb and doesn't have the necessary switch in opportunities to take full advantage of a Choice Scarf.</p> <p>Having counters to Tentacruel and Vaporeon is crucial to this set's success. Rotom-A and Magnezone do a good job here; they are both immune to Tentacruel's Toxic Spikes and can threaten the two bulky Water-types with their STAB Electric attacks. Defeating opposing Heatran will also allow Infernape to use its STAB Fire-type attacks more freely. Suicune and Swampert do a great job at defeating Heatran; they take minimal damage from Heatran's attacks (barring the rare Hidden Power Grass vs. Swampert), and can OHKO it with Surf or Earthquake, respectively.</p> "

  "Empoleon": {
    "overview": "<p>Empoleon's excellent Water / Steel typing, well-rounded stats, and decent movepool make it a great Pokemon in the DPP landscape. Its unique typing provides it with key resistances such as Dragon and Water, which makes Empoleon the only Pokemon in the metagame that resists both of Kingdra's STAB moves in addition to Choice Specs Latias's Draco Meteor + Surf combination. Its Dark and Rock resistances also enable it to take on both of Tyranitar's STAB moves while also providing it with a Stealth Rock resistance. Empoleon also has the distinction of being a fantastic answer to Jirachi, as it resists both Iron Head and Body Slam and is not weak to Fire Punch. Empoleon has access to the most powerful Hydro Pump of all OU Pokemon; when it's boosted by its ability Torrent, Empoleon can deliver unrivaled power on the field, making it even more threatening in a metagame where usual teams are suffering from a lack of a real Water-type resistance. Empoleon is usually seen as an offensive powerhouse thanks to its access to Agility, which, paired with its high Special Attack and good coverage, turns it into a fearsome sweeper. However, outside of its ability Torrent, Empoleon has no means to boost its Special Attack, which can prevent it from hitting some Pokemon hard enough. Finally, Empoleon also has access to utility moves like Stealth Rock, Roar, and even Knock Off, which is a big tool against defensive teams. Its low Speed stat is one of its main cons; Empoleon has to run a Timid nature to outspeed Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Adamant Choice Scarf Flygon, which is not always ideal because it usually wants all the power it can have. While it can take special hits effectively thanks to its good bulk, Empoleon is vulnerable to common coverage types in the metagame, such as Ground, Fighting, and Electric.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Chople Berry is an alternative on the Agility set; however, it remains very team dependent, inferior, and not as useful as other Berries like Shuca and Wacan, because even with Chople Berry, Empoleon is not taking Fighting-type moves from the likes of Infernape, Breloom, and Lucario that well. Alternatively, a mid-game Chople Berry set with Stealth Rock can stand against the likes of Infernape, Breloom, and Lucario and still keeps up against Jirachi and Latias. Yawn can be used as a filler move over Stealth Rock on a mid-game set, forcing switches and enabling Empoleon to try catching some KOs. RestTalk and Aqua Ring are options on the specially defensive set to improve Empoleon's longevity in providing it some sort of extra recovery; however, you will need to drop moves like Protect and Stealth Rock to make room for them. Icy Wind and Feather Dance find their use against setup sweepers like Gyarados that would like to set up on Empoleon for free. Feather Dance is also great in conjunction with entry hazards on the specially defensive set to force out physical attackers. The Choice Specs set can make room for Sleep Talk; however, it really wants all the four moves it has already.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users: Choice Scarf users like Rotom-A and Flygon can revenge kill Empoleon even after one Agility with their STAB moves. Choice Scarf Latias can use Thunderbolt, Thunder Wave, or even Trick to lock Empoleon into Ice Beam, which completely invalidates it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Clefable and Blissey are both extremely annoying for Empoleon; the former can stall out Hydro Pump's PP with a combination of Soft-Boiled and potentially Protect, while the latter can cripple Empoleon with Thunder Wave and will never faint to Hydro Pump. Specially defensive Jirachi is at best 3HKOed by Empoleon's Hydro Pump, and it can chain Wishes and Protects and stall out Hydro Pump while crippling Empoleon with Body Slam.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Waters: Among all the Pokemon resisting Water-type moves, Abomasnow is one of the most irritating. In addition to its good bulk and lack of a weakness to Ice Beam, its hail means Empoleon is consistently chipped down. Abomasnow can also use Leech Seed and Protect to easily stay healthy and make Empoleon completely worthless. Funnily enough, specially defensive Empoleon is a good check to its own Agility set, as it takes very little damage from Grass Knot and can eventually phaze it with Roar. Calm Mind Latias potentially walls Empoleon if it boosts up too much, meaning Empoleon has to rely on an Ice Beam freeze if Latias gets out of control. It is worth mentioning that Milotic, Suicune, and Starmie all wall SubPetaya Empoleon because it lacks Grass Knot. Lastly, despite the fact that Vaporeon is rarely seen, it remains obnoxious for Empoleon to deal with, as it takes almost nothing from Grass Knot due to its low weight.</p> <p><strong>Trappers: Magnezone is a situational check to Empoleon. Against the Agility set, it can come in at full health, tank a Hydro Pump, and revenge kill it with Thunderbolt, while it outspeeds the specially defensive set and does not take enough damage from Surf.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-, Electric-, and Ground-type Coverage: Empoleon's Ground-, Electric-, and Fighting-type weaknesses allow the most popular and strongest powerhouses of the tier to take advantage of it. Zapdos threatens all Empoleon sets with Thunderbolt and can check it pretty nicely if it's heavily invested in Special Defense. Thunder Jirachi 2HKOes most Empoleon sets without bulk investment and can significantly reduce its effectiveness with paralysis. Fighting-types like Infernape, Lucario, and Breloom can force Empoleon out with their STAB attacks, especially if they are running Mach Punch and Empoleon is at low health. Gengar nails Empoleon with Focus Blast, while offensive Starmie does enough damage with Thunderbolt to scare Empoleon out. Tyranitar is usually bulky enough to take one hit from Empoleon and damage it back with either Superpower or Earthquake. Finally, Pokemon like Gyarados, Dragonite, and even offensive Bronzong can deal tremendous damage to Empoleon with Earthquake.</p> ",

        "name": "Lead",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Empoleon is one of the best leads in the DPP OU metagame. Its ability to quickly put pressure against both offensive and defensive teams while being able to set up Stealth Rock makes it a tremendous lead.</p> <p>Hydro Pump is Empoleon's primary STAB move, which deals significant damage to almost everything in the metagame, even some Pokemon that resist it like Breloom and Starmie. Thanks to its high Special Attack, Empoleon is able to 2HKO common leads like Metagross, Machamp, Jirachi, and Azelf or weaken a Pokemon that switches in. Grass Knot is a near-mandatory coverage move for Empoleon, as it enables it to hit Water-type Pokemon such as Starmie super effectively, which means Empoleon will consistently maintain Stealth Rock against the best spinner of OU. Swampert, Suicune, Milotic, Gyarados, and Kingdra are other targets Empoleon much appreciates being able to hit. Empoleon is a fantastic Stealth Rock setter; its favorable matchup against a lot of leads helps it get Stealth Rock up easily most of the time, and its coverage moves paired with its powerful Hydro Pump can be difficult to switch into for both offensive teams and defensive teams. None of the leads like Jirachi, Hippowdon, and Tyranitar want to take a Hydro Pump, so they're usually forced to switch out, leaving themselves subject to the opposing offensive pressure and giving up the chance to set up their own Stealth Rock early. On top of that, thanks to its Focus Sash, Empoleon will always avoid any KO while also getting in Torrent range, even against Clefable's Seismic Toss, which is a 4HKO. Aqua Jet serves as an all-purpose priority STAB move that is used to finish off Focus Sash leads like Azelf and Metagross or just getting overall chip damage that might come in handy later on, such as against Heatran and Gengar. Ice Beam is an additional coverage move mainly used to hit Dragonite, Latias, and Grass-types such as Breloom, Shaymin, and Celebi super effectively, which resist Empoleon's Water / Grass coverage. Lastly, Knock Off is another option that helps cripple potential early-game switch-ins like defensive Jirachi, Clefable, Blissey, Latias, and Grass-types like Celebi and Abomasnow.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature enable Empoleon to hit as hard as possible, while the remaining 252 EVs go in Speed so Empoleon can outspeed major threats such as Machamp and Speed tie with fast Swampert. While Modest looks like the best nature, Rash is another option that doesn't compromise Aqua Jet's power, which can help get nice chip damage on Pokemon like Heatran and Gengar. Keep in mind that generally it's not worth minimizing Empoleon's Special Defense, though, since it is likely to take one or two hits from the likes of Latias and Suicune. Timid is not an option because Empoleon wants to deal as much damage as possible to Pokemon like Jirachi and Clefable, which wouldn't be nearly as pressured without a Special Attack-boosting nature. Focus Sash fits Empoleon perfectly, as it allows it to tank any hit from the likes of Zapdos, Rotom-A and Flygon and strike back with a Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If you're facing a lead that is very threatening to your whole team like Machamp or Zapdos that can be pain to deal with for offense, you might want to throw a Hydro Pump immediately to weaken or even KO them. However, know that this implies that you won't be able to set up Stealth Rock. In easier matchups, usually set up Stealth Rock turn 1 and throw out the appropriate attack to weaken the opposing lead. Keep in mind the synergy between Focus Sash and Torrent; once Empoleon activates its Focus Sash, it gets in Torrent range, which means it is able to fire off a powerful Hydro Pump that almost nothing can stand. Against offensive teams, if you manage to keep your Empoleon alive against the opposing lead, try to preserve it as fodder, which may turn out pretty useful to regain momentum. Empoleon's resistances also allow it to come into the field multiple times, and it may find opportunities to throw out attacks or set Stealth Rock back up if needed. Against more defensive teams, Empoleon tends to be chipped down much more slowly, so try to manage its health as much as you can in order to use Torrent to your advantage and put pressure on foes like Clefable and specially defensive Jirachi that should typically check Empoleon. If Empoleon is in Torrent range, try to bring it on the field on a predicted switch or once the enemy is forced to use a recovery move.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Thanks to Empoleon's versatility, it pairs well with many different Pokemon. Teammates that benefit from the early offensive pressure and momentum set up by Empoleon are much appreciated. Dragon Dance sweepers such as Gyarados and Dragonite help in keeping up the offensive pressure, especially if Empoleon has weakened the opponent's Latias or Water-types. Jirachi is very useful to those typical offensive teams, since it can run various sets and support its team at its convenience. It's one of the few Pokemon on offense that keeps in check all of Lucario, Scizor, Starmie, and Tyranitar and also takes on Dragon-types and opposing Jirachi well. Tyranitar is very desirable because it traps both Latias and Rotom-A and supplies defensive utility in keeping up against Pokemon like Zapdos and Starmie, which otherwise would be too much to deal with. Latias provides wonderful support on offense, keeping up against Pokemon like Breloom and Infernape defensively without compromising offensive pressure with its Choice sets. Bronzong not only provides a great defensive backbone thanks to its typing and defensive stats but also can act as late-game cleaner with Trick Room, which goes well with Choice Band Tyranitar. Gengar brings immunities to Fighting and Ground to the table and is able to disrupt both offensive and defensive teams with Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, or even Explosion. Kingdra, Swampert, and Suicune are other great teammates more focused on stacking Water-types and overloading the opposing Water-type checks. Finally, because sometimes Empoleon may not be able to set up its Stealth Rock against very specific leads like Machamp and Zapdos, you may want a second Stealth Rock setter in your team like Jirachi or Tyranitar.</p> "

        "name": "Agility",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This set allows Empoleon to compensate for its low Speed and become a terrifying sweeper.</p> <p>Hydro Pump is the best STAB option due to its high Base Power; Surf is a possibility if you prefer a 100% accurate move, but it might miss out on damage on key targets like Jirachi, Tyranitar, Rotom, Metagross, and Bronzong. Ice Beam covers Dragon- and Grass-types like Latias, Dragonite, Breloom, Celebi, and Shaymin, while Grass Knot deals with Water-types such as Swampert, Starmie, Suicune, and Milotic. Paired with Empoleon's Water-type STAB attack, this move combination provides unresisted coverage in the metagame. Finally, Substitute can be used over Grass Knot, but it should always be used with Petaya Berry. With this move, the idea is to set up Agility and keep using Substitute until both Petaya Berry and Torrent activate, which makes Empoleon more threatening than ever. However, keep in mind that this option is less reliable and will be less consistent overall, since it gives up Grass-type coverage, and if Empoleon is in Petaya Berry range, this means it's also in range of priority attacks. Hidden Power Electric is another option that should be used only if you're really weak to Gyarados and can't afford to let it set up; it's overall worse than Grass Knot, because Empoleon now can't hit Swampert as hard anymore and becomes weaker against Pokemon like Starmie, Suicune, and Milotic.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 EVs in Special Attack maximize Empoleon's damage output, and 252 EVs in Speed make it as fast as possible after one Agility. A Modest nature is the way to go most of the time because of the higher power it gives to Empoleon, ensuring it can 3HKO Pokemon like Clefable and Bronzong and do significant more damage to bulky Jirachi. That said, Timid is also a pretty decent choice because it allows Empoleon to outrun Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Adamant Choice Scarf Flygon after one Agility, which can end up sealing a game. Overall, a Modest nature looks better if you have Tyranitar's Pursuit support, while Timid doesn't necessarily require it. Shuca Berry is incredibly useful because it enables Empoleon to take an Earthquake from the likes of Choice Scarf Flygon, Dragonite, Gyarados, Swampert, Tyranitar, and Metagross. On the other hand, Wacan Berry ensures that Empoleon survives a Thunderbolt from Rotom-A, Zapdos, and Magnezone.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Generally, because it rarely sweeps teams on its own, you want to scout and weaken the opposing team a bit if you're aiming for an Empoleon late-game sweep. Weakening Steel-types such as Jirachi, Magnezone, Bronzong, and Metagross and Pokemon like Clefable, Tyranitar, and Latias helps in that regard. Try to keep your Empoleon hidden and healthy for the most part of the game, and wait for the ideal moment to bring it out. The best way to take advantage of Empoleon is to bring it on a Choice-locked Pokemon like Outrage-locked Flygon, Crunch- or Pursuit-locked Tyranitar, or Choice-locked Latias. Since Empoleon has good bulk and good resistances, it can also afford to take a hit from anything, which is even more doable if it has a Berry that halves damage from a super effective move. Due to its low Speed, using Agility once will not make Empoleon faster than Choice Scarf users like Flygon, Rotom-A, Latias, and Jirachi, so sometimes it will have to find opportunities to set up a second Agility to outrun those.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that help in making Empoleon's sweep easier are more than valued. Tyranitar is a big one, as it is able to Pursuit trap both Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Choice Scarf Latias, which are thorns in Empoleon's side. Heatran and Gengar are both amazing at pressuring Pokemon like Jirachi, Clefable, and Blissey; the former can use Magma Storm and Taunt or Explosion to get rid of Clefable and Blissey, while the latter can use Will-O-Wisp to cripple specially defensive Jirachi or effectively lure Clefable and Blissey and take them out with Explosion. Gengar also can force Pokemon like Flygon to use Outrage, which opens the gates for Empoleon. Breloom, in the same vein, is excellent at taking advantage of special walls like Clefable and Blissey, especially if paired with Tyranitar, which has great synergy with it. Because Empoleon is usually susceptible to priority moves like Mach Punch from the likes of Breloom and Infernape, Chople Berry + Dragon Dance Tyranitar does a good job luring in and removing those for Empoleon. Pokemon like Kingdra and Suicune help as well in forcing Jirachi and Clefable to take serious damage. Lastly, Choice Specs Latias can drop powerful Draco Meteors on opposing special walls while also threatening to shut down a defensive Pokemon with Trick. In case Empoleon gets weakened early or gets afflicted with status, Healing Wish Latias can be used and bring Empoleon back to full health.</p> "

        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Despite being a powerful offensive Pokemon, Empoleon is also a fantastic special wall thanks to its great typing, very good Special Defense, and ability to check Pokemon such as Choice Specs Latias, Jirachi, Heatran, Suicune, and most notably Kingdra.</p> <p>Surf is Empoleon's best move for offensive pressure on this set. Protect enables Empoleon to gain additional Leftovers recovery, which is valuable as its only form of recovery, as well as scouting Choiced Pokemon like Tyranitar, Latias, Flygon, and Rotom. Roar is very useful to phaze Pokemon like Calm Mind Jirachi, Calm Mind Suicune, and Dragon Dance Kingdra and overall allow Empoleon to be less passive. Knock Off is an alternative and like Roar gives Empoleon a less passive presence on the field. Knock Off is excellent in long and slow-paced games; Empoleon can cripple Jirachi, Suicune, Starmie, Clefable, and pretty much anything with Leftovers, preventing passive recovery and allowing its team to start making progress. Empoleon's ability to be a great Stealth Rock setter is improved here thanks to Leftovers recovery and bulk investment. Toxic can be used to chip Pokemon like Starmie, Milotic, Kingdra, and Suicune more effectively.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Investing 252 EVs in HP and Special Defense as well as providing Empoleon with a Calm nature ensures that it can perform its defensive role perfectly, as it wants to combat Starmie, Heatran, Latias, and Kingdra as well as possible. You could put in some Defense EVs to take on Pokemon like Tyranitar and Bronzong better or even some Special Attack EVs to do more damage to the likes of Jirachi, Skarmory, and Tyranitar. Leftovers is the mandatory item here, being the best and only form of recovery for Empoleon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>You can lead with this Empoleon, since it performs well for the most part against the common leads; just make sure that you have backup options for Metagross, Machamp, and Zapdos leads. Set up Stealth Rock turn 1 most of the time, since almost nothing really prevents Empoleon from doing that, and Pokemon like Azelf may be reluctant to use Taunt in fear of a Hydro Pump. Switch Empoleon into powerful special attackers like Choice Specs Latias, Kingdra, and Suicune, and use the opportunity to use Roar or Knock Off to cripple the opposing team. Protect should be used relatively often, as it's important to keep Empoleon as healthy as possible. However, try to not use it too much and become too predictable in this aspect, as Pokemon like Tyranitar, Metagross, and Dragonite may come in on a telegraphed Protect and scare Empoleon out. You can use Empoleon to pivot against Gengar's Shadow Ball and throw out a Surf if it's in its KO range; it's also worth knowing that this Empoleon is one of the best defensive answers to Jirachi.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Specially defensive Empoleon does require some support, since it's too passive against setup sweepers and defensive teams. Empoleon's teammates should try to lessen the impact of its numerous weaknesses and the potential setup it would allow while also providing solid countermeasures against defensive cores to compensate for its mediocre matchup against Clefable and the free momentum it can give. That said, for a great defensive synergy, teammates should mainly try covering Fighting-, Ground-, and Electric-type moves, as Empoleon's slowness makes it prone to being exploited by the strongest powerhouses of the tiers, such as Dragonite and Gyarados. Skarmory, which is one of the greatest physical walls, is an excellent option, and setting up Spikes is big for compensating for Empoleon's passiveness. Nidoqueen brings an Electric immunity as well as a Fighting resistance and sets up Toxic Spikes, while bulky Latias provides a ton of resistances and can synergize well with Spikes support and Roar. Choice Scarf Rotom-A gets the jump on dangerous foes like Infernape and Dragon Dance sweepers like Gyarados and Dragonite that Empoleon fears. It also blocks Rapid Spin, while RestTalk variants can absorb Breloom's Spore and Superpower to compensate for Empoleon's slowness. On the other hand, Gengar brings similar defensive utility and threatens defensive teams especially with Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, and Spikes support. Wish users such as Latias, Jirachi, and Clefable are valuable, as they give Empoleon way more longevity. You also need some sort of pressure outside of entry hazards, or Clefable will just sit on your team all day. Gliscor is an amazing stallbreaker that also provides great defensive utility against Pokemon like Lucario, Dragonite, and Tyranitar. Gengar, as mentioned previously, gives defensive teams a hard time while providing a countermeasure to Infernape and Breloom. Breloom takes advantage of Clefable wonderfully, while Calm Mind Latias and Calm Mind Clefable are both great wincons against defensive teams. Furthermore, Clefable and Breloom can also absorb Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-A, which Empoleon should try to avoid. Lastly, Tyranitar is big because its sand synergizes really well with Empoleon's typing and helps making good progress in the game, while it also helps in the hazard game by trapping opposing Starmie.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Empoleon's taking another approach with this set, maximizing its raw power with Choice Specs.</p> <p>Hydro Pump is simply devastating; with Choice Specs, Empoleon has a chance of OHKOing maximum HP Metagross, always takes out Azelf leads, and turns the tables against bulky Jirachi and bulky Bronzong by turning a low chance of a 2HKO into a very guaranteed one. One of the main assets that Choice Specs Empoleon brings compared to regular sets shows against Clefable and specially defensive Jirachi; the former faces a guaranteed 2HKO, while the latter gets heavily damaged, which is huge because it can't come in freely on Hydro Pump anymore. Anything that does not resist Water will get swallowed up by a Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump, and even Pokemon that do resist it like Breloom, Starmie, uninvested Suicune, and Latias are still taking a ton of damage. Surf is the second best STAB option, which is less destructive but still very good in terms of power thanks to Choice Specs. It's also safer to spam than Hydro Pump thanks to its perfect accuracy and higher PP. Ice Beam covers Latias and Grass-types like Celebi and Shaymin, which resist Empoleon's Water-type STAB attacks, while Grass Knot destroys the Water-types that resist Ice- and Water-type coverage such as Milotic and Suicune. The extra power on Ice Beam and Grass Knot is key in securing the 2HKO on Pokemon like Kingdra and Gyarados.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximize Empoleon's power with 252 EVs in Special Attack and a Modest nature in order to hit as hard as possible; it's absolutely crucial to maintain its benchmarks against Jirachi and Clefable and deal as much damage as possible against them. The remaining EVs go into its Speed in order to outrun as many Pokemon as possible. Note that a few EVs in HP may be useful to improve the odds of taking a Thunderbolt from Rotom-A or just to help against the likes of Jirachi and Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Every time you have Empoleon on the field, fire off powerful attacks depending on what you are facing. Since this set should be used as a lead, you can use it to throw powered-up Water-type STAB attacks early-game and chip Empoleon's typical checks. If you're facing an offensive team, the first safe switch-in to a Choice Specs Hydro Pump is usually Latias. If you're facing a defensive team, odds are the first switch-in will be Clefable, which gets destroyed by Hydro Pump thanks to the surprise factor that Choice Specs Empoleon provides; the remaining possible best switch-ins are going to be Milotic, bulky Latias, and bulky Suicune. Depending on what foes have been revealed and the state of the game, you might want to click other moves and predict a bit, such as to take out Latias with Ice Beam or Suicune with Grass Knot. Use Empoleon's great typing to switch around resisted moves and find opportunities to throw as many attacks as you can in the middle of the game. Try to manage its health as much as possible to possibly enter Torrent range, which will make it devastating, especially against slow teams that might have a hard time forcing it out immediately.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar has very good synergy with Choice Specs Empoleon because it can trap both Latias and Blissey, two of the few Pokemon that are able to switch into a Choice Specs Hydro Pump, and its sand is huge for negating Leftovers from the likes of Milotic and Suicune. Jirachi can spread paralysis with Body Slam very nicely to support Empoleon and compensate for its low Speed, which prevents it from being fully threatening against fast teams. Since this Empoleon should lead, make sure that you have a good backup against Electric-types like Rotom-A and Zapdos; Pokemon like Blissey, Clefable, Swampert, and bulky Tyranitar are all great for that purpose. Empoleon appreciates having a teammate that can pivot at least once against Ground-, Electric-, and Fighting-type moves like Latias, Rotom-A, and Gengar, since this Empoleon has to lock itself into a move and will be easily forced out. Pokemon like Choice Specs Kingdra and Suicune help keep up Empoleon's offensive pressure with more strong Water-type attacks. Finally, Healing Wish Latias can give Empoleon a second life if it gets weakened badly.</p> "

  "Staraptor": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting good Attack and Speed coupled with great type coverage, Staraptor is a viable physical attacker in OU play. Intimidate is a great ability on Staraptor, as it helps it switch in on physical hits much easier to compensate for its rather miserable defenses. Staraptor really shines out of all the Normal- / Flying-type hybrids because of Intimidate and a Fighting-type move in Close Combat to beat opposing Steel- and Rock-types. Dodrio and Swellow lack a strong Fighting-type move to budge these Steel- and Rock-types and this is probably the main reason why Staraptor is on a different level. You might find the results to be a bit mediocre due to its Stealth Rock weakness; however, Staraptor can still be a potent threat when used correctly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Life Orb can be used in conjunction with Agility but it has no room on the other sets. If Life Orb is used with the SubRoost set, Staraptor's HP would run down far too quickly. Feather Dance is an interesting option but Staraptor shouldn't go near that move because it is far better at sweeping than running a defensive set.</p> <p>In theory, Foresight can help Staraptor use its Normal-type STAB moves against Ghost-type Pokemon. An Adamant Staraptor with Life Orb under its belt can deal 60.20% - 71.05% on a max HP / max Defense Rotom with Double-Edge. Rotom-A is a trouble to deal with, and this is one way to actually penetrate through them with a STAB move. Though not recommended, you don't have to maximize your Speed, but a minimum of 296 Speed is required to outspeed Jolly Heracross, or 319 Speed for Jolly Electivire. Any remaining EVs should go into HP.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Skarmory, Jirachi, Metagross and Bronzong resist both STAB moves, have high Defense, and are neutral to Close Combat, making all four of them excellent choices against Staraptor. Rhyperior's massive HP and Defense, coupled with his Solid Rock ability, which reduces his Fighting weakness, also makes him a good counter.</p> <p>Although they get hit hard by Brave Bird, Ghosts are often good switch-ins thanks to their immunity to both Close Combat and Return/Double-Edge. They can cripple Staraptor with Will-O-Wisp or simply attack him with super effective attacks like Thunderbolt (Gengar, Rotom-A, Mismagius), Thunder Punch, or Ice Punch (Dusknoir). Rotom-A makes an excellent counter, resisting Brave Bird and taking nothing from Return and Close Combat, whilst also being able to shrug off Staraptor's U-turn. Rotom can then hit back with Thunderbolt. Zapdos resists both Brave Bird and Close Combat, and easily kills Staraptor with Thunderbolt, but it must watch out from a Choice Band Double-Edge which can OHKO Zapdos with Stealth Rock in play.</p> <p>Otherwise, just try to outpredict him as he'll usually be restricted by Choice Band/Scarf.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Staraptor's good Speed and Attack stats make it a good candidate for a Choice Band set. Intimidate makes him a good choice as a lead and helps when sending him out later, just don't get too over zealous when switching into physical attacks; his defenses are still poor. Brave Bird and Return / Double-Edge provides raw power, while Close Combat rounds off the coverage. U-turn allows Staraptor to scout.</p> <p>Brave Bird and Return / Double-Edge are his main weapons and both hit incredibly hard, while Close Combat hits for at least neutral damage on every Rock- and Steel-type. The STAB Normal attacks are mostly for Electric-types, especially Zapdos, who also resists Fighting. Double-Edge guarantees an OHKO on Zapdos, but Return is usually preferable as two recoil moves is rather excessive, let alone when paired with a Stealth Rock weakness.</p> <p>The fourth slot is the sort of \"utility\" move. U-turn allows you to scout your counter and get in a hit, while Pursuit is always a great move on Choice Banders and Staraptor makes good use of it. It's especially good against the likes of Celebi and Blissey, who will run, fearing a Brave Bird. Quick Attack is for protection against Reversal/Flail users and to take down other weakened but faster foes. It does upwards of 45% to the likes of Azelf, Raikou, and Weavile (just be careful of Weavile using Ice Shard).</p> <p>Like most Choice Banders, Staraptor will benefit from Wish support, but it's even more essential with Staraptor due to the recoil of Brave Bird and Double-Edge. To varying degrees, Jirachi, Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Umbreon can work. Rapid Spin support--Starmie and Forretress are excellent choices for this--to remove Stealth Rock will also aid his survivability.</p> <p>Not many physical walls can switch in because if Staraptor wields a Choice Band, its Attack skyrockets to 558 or 508, depending on the nature you select. In addition to this, Staraptor has fantastic coverage which means that not many physical walls can switch in to its dangerous STAB moves. Rotom-A is your safest switch in to this set; resisting both of Staraptor's STAB moves while shrugging off Pursuit or U-turn. Acknowledge the sets and begin to counter Rotom-A. If they are the special attacking versions, Snorlax and Blissey is your best bet to stop these guys because they have fantastic bulk to weather the attacks from Rotom-A. Choiced Rotom will usually have Trick under their sleeves to screw up Blissey and Snorlax; therefore, Heatran can be great to absorb Trick and Will-O-Wisp, while Jolteon can partner well to take Thunderbolt and cushion Shadow Ball due its decent Special Defense.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Unlike the previous set, Choice Scarf trades the extra power of a Choice Band for extra Speed to make Staraptor faster than many would-be revenge-killers. Sporting an impressive 427 Speed and 372 Attack, this Staraptor forces you to think twice before switching in due to its solid Attack and great type coverage. On top of all this, Intimidate really puts the icing on the cake because it allows Staraptor to switch in on physical attacks much easier. Don't get too cocky switching in on physical attackers though, especially those of the highest caliber, because Staraptor still has a poor Defense stat even with Intimidate factored in. Like the previous set, this one provides optimal coverage, which is only resisted by Rotom-A. Pursuit allows Staraptor to deal with weakened Rotom-A.</p> <p>Staraptor is a great offensive threat because of its high powered dual STAB attacks. Brave Bird, Return, and Double-Edge all wield more than 100 Base Power and can harm anything in Staraptor's way. The choices for your Normal-type STAB move is totally your choice. Return provides good damage without attaining any recoil damage, while Double-Edge gives the additional damage in exchange for some HP. Rock- and Steel-types can be quite upsetting because they resist Staraptor's precious STAB attacks, but thankfully, Staraptor has Close Combat under its belt which covers both types, and gives Staraptor some good overall type coverage. Your selection for your final move depends on what you decide to do with Staraptor. U-turn allows Staraptor to scout out for incoming counters while you exit and bring in an appropriate Pokemon to plow through your opponent's counter to Staraptor. Pursuit, on the other hand, plays a different role than U-turn. Pursuit traps those pesky Ghost-types and catches fleeing special walls like Blissey.</p> <p>Staraptor can often find good opportunities to switch in, but Stealth Rock hinders this bird from repeatedly switching in and out. Staraptor will greatly appreciate Rapid Spin users to remove the offending Rocks, thus providing extra survivability for Staraptor. Speaking of living longer, like many Choice users, Staraptor needs Wish support to help it stay alive. Double-Edge and Brave Bird's recoil, as well as Stealth Rock damage, can chip off Staraptor's HP more quickly than is comfortable, and therefore Wish users like Hypno, Chansey, and Blissey can help Staraptor. Staraptor doesn't mind Stealth Rock on the field to help it sweep late game.</p> <p>With the swap for Speed in exchange for power, Staraptor is going to lack the raw power to muscle through some bulky Pokemon. Skarmory, Jirachi, Metagross, and Bronzong are great counters for Staraptor because these individuals resist both of its beloved STAB moves and they are neutral to Close Combat. With all these Steel-types being listed, packing Magnezone can really be a good service alongside Staraptor. Magnezone can trap Skarmory without Shed Shell and strike back with Thunderbolt or use Magnet Rise to dodge Ground-type moves.</p> <p>Rotom-A is arguably the greatest counter to Staraptor. It can take all of Staraptor's attacks and strike back with Will-O-Wisp or Thunderbolt. Heatran is probably the best partner for Staraptor to handle these annoying ghouls. Heatran can take Will-O-Wisp, survive a Thunderbolt, and dispose them with a STAB Fire-type attack, but Scarf variants should watch out for a rare but possible Thunder Wave.</p> "

        "name": "Life Orb",
        "description": "<p>With Life Orb, Staraptor trades survivability and raw power for the freedom to switch between attacks. With this freedom, Staraptor can abuse its high Base Power attacks and attempt a sweep with its excellent type coverage. When Staraptor is at low health, simply use Roost to alleviate damage and continue your rampage.</p> <p>Like on any of its other sets, Brave Bird and Close Combat are mandatory due to their great coverage in just two moves and immense power. Return is the main option for the third slot as it provides consistent, reliable damage and is boosted by STAB, making it a strong option for picking off frail and weakened enemies. Roost is also given a slot to compensate for residual damage Staraptor may suffer, such as Stealth Rock damage and recoil from Life Orb and Brave Bird.</p> <p>Essentially, the choice between an Adamant and Jolly nature is up to the user's preference. Whereas a Jolly Nature enables Staraptor to tie with and possibly come out on top against positive-natured base 100's such as Zapdos and Jirachi, an Adamant nature can be used for the added power. A Jolly nature is almost always the better option for being able to attack faster Pokemon before Staraptor's weak defenses suffer a hit. To illustrate the effectiveness of Life Orb Staraptor, some calculations assuming a Jolly nature are listed below:</p> <ul> <li>Jolly Life Orb Brave Bird vs. 252 HP / 220 Def Bold Celebi: 88.1% - 104% <li>Jolly Life Orb Brave Bird vs. 240 HP / 216 Def Relaxed Swampert: 48.1% - 56.9%</li> <li>Jolly Life Orb Brave Bird vs. 4 HP / 0 Def Neutral Suicune: 62.6% - 74%</li> <li>Jolly Life Orb Brave Bird vs. 188 HP / 252 Def Bold Vaporeon: 52.9% - 62.5%</li> <li>Jolly Life Orb Brave Bird vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Neutral Gliscor: 56.2% - 66.4%</li> <li>Jolly Life Orb Close Combat vs. 252 HP / 252 Def Bold Blissey: 81.5% - 96.1%</li> <li>Jolly Life Orb Close Combat vs. 4 HP / 0 Def Neutral Heatran: 94.7% - 111.5%</li> <li>Jolly Life Orb Close Combat vs. 4 HP / 0 Def Neutral Jirachi: 46.8% - 55.3%</li> </ul> <p>As with the Choice Band set, not a lot of Pokemon can safely switch into Staraptor due to the pure power of Staraptor's moves. Even bulky Water-type Pokemon, such as Swampert and Vaporeon, are not safe from Brave Bird's chance to 2HKO. Only Rotom-A resists or is immune to all of Staraptor's moves and can cripple Staraptor with Thunderbolt, Discharge, or Will-O-Wisp. Jirachi, Bronzong, and Metagross can survive Close Combat and can use their choice of move to remove Staraptor. This Staraptor set also has issues with being revenge killed by Pokemon that carry a Choice Scarf, such as Jirachi and Tyranitar.</p> <p>Life Orb Starmie is the number one teammate for Life Orb Staraptor. In addition to having a great offensive and defensive partnership with it, Starmie can remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin and eliminate most of Staraptor's counters with a powerful Hydro Pump. Forretress is another Rapid Spinner who, while it doesn't counter anything significant, can set up entry hazards in the face of physically defensive Pokemon who might cause Staraptor some trouble. Speaking of entry hazards, the above calculations may lead to OHKOs and 2HKOs with Stealth Rock or a single layer of Spikes, so having a team member who can lay down these hazards further enables Staraptor's sweep.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This set is on a different field as the other sets because it aims to stick around longer than the other sets. You are limited to two attacking moves in exchange for two support moves. The core idea of this set is to remain in the match as long as possible, with Roost to heal off Stealth Rock damage and Brave Bird recoil. Staraptor can utilize Substitute to dodge status that would otherwise render it useless.</p> <p>With Staraptor's massive Attack, opponents are usually forced to switch out, and for this reason Substitute is a great move to scout for switch-ins. Behind a Substitute, you can heal off damage or hurt the opponent with Brave Bird or Close Combat. This set may have lost some gleam on the offensive side but Flying + Fighting is good coverage that is only resisted by Rotom-A and Zapdos, which is surprisingly only a small group of Pokemon who wall this set.</p> <p>The choice for Staraptor's item is a tough selection, but Sharp Beak is usually the best option. Sharp Beak boosts Brave Bird's power and can trick opponents into thinking you hold a choice item. Leftovers is another option but you will lose some power which this set really needs to perform effectively.</p> <p>As mentioned before, Rotom-A and Zapdos can easily come on this set and strike back with Thunderbolt. Rotom-A is the toughest to counter since it can provide a shock with Trick in their arsenal, which can ruin your counter for Rotom. Heatran can take Thunderbolt and Trick and can carve a chunk of HP with a STAB Fire-type move. Jolteon has Volt Absorb to take Thunderbolt from Rotom and a Choice Specs Shadow Ball should 2HKO them. Blissey stops Zapdos cold and can spam Seismic Toss or cripple the bird with Toxic.</p> "

  "Roserade": {
    "overview": "<p>Roserade is, hands down, one of the best Toxic Spikes users in OU. It can easily dispense Toxic Spikes in the lead position thanks to Sleep Powder, which allows it to neuter opposing leads, and it decent Speed stat. While Roserade is usually seen as a Toxic Spikes user, it can also be employed as an exceptional offensive Pokemon. It has access to two powerful STAB moves in Leaf Storm and Sludge Bomb, can allow it to successfully run either a Life Orb or a Choice Scarf set. On top of this, it is also an excellent Spikes user and can use a SubSeeding strategy to stall out the opposing team.</p> <p>However, Roserade is very physically frail, so most powerful physical attacks will KO it. Priority moves, such as Extreme Speed and Bullet Punch, will often spell doom for Roserade as well. Additionally, its Grass / Poison STAB combination is resisted by many common Pokemon, such as Heatran, Scizor, and Jirachi, and so it must rely on a Hidden Power type to cover all of these threats.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Roserade has a few other decent moves, but it will usually struggle to find a moveslot for them. Extrasensory can be used in order to hit Fighting-types, but the only Pokemon that it will hit harder than Roserade's other moves are Machamp, Gengar, and Breloom, usually making it a waste of moveslot. Roserade can also succeed on sandstorm teams, as it resists Water- and Grass-type moves and has access to a powerful Rock-type attack in Weather Ball. Grass Whistle can be used as a sleep-inducing move on sets where Sleep Powder is illegal, but its poor accuracy often makes it an undesirable choice. Roserade makes for a decent cleric with Aromatherapy, but traditional clerics like Blissey and Celebi are usually better choices for such a role. Shadow Ball can be used on offensive sets, but it will usually only hit Gengar harder than Roserade's other moves, as Leaf Storm already hits Rotom-A for tremendous damage. Growth is an option to boost Roserade's Special Attack further, but it is often too slow and physically frail to successfully sweep.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While Roserade may be an extremely powerful special attacker, it is easily walled by many common Pokemon. Any Roserade set lacking Hidden Power Fire will be completely shut down by opposing Steel-types, as they aren't heavily damaged by any other move Roserade commonly carries. This means that Pokemon like Skarmory and Forretress can easily set up entry hazards against Roserade, while Pokemon like Scizor can switch in and deal serious damage to it. Dragonite will set up on most Roserade sets lacking Hidden Power Ice, but it must be wary of Sludge Bomb from Life Orb variants. Blissey and Snorlax can wall most Roserade sets effortlessly, but a SubSeed set will cripple them due to their large HP stats. Heatran can easily switch in on Roserade and proceed to either set up or simply spam its powerful STAB Fire Blast, but it must watch out for rare Hidden Power Ground variants. Overall, almost any Pokemon faster than Roserade with a decently powerful physical STAB move will beat it, as Roserade's Defense leaves a lot to be desired and its Speed is average at best.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Thanks to Roserade's decent Speed and access to Sleep Powder, it serves as an excellent lead, boasting the ability to shut down many common leads and proceed to set up entry hazards against them. It works best against slow, bulky leads that are unable to defend themselves from Sleep Powder.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, Sleep Powder allows Roserade to incapacitate and set up on common leads, such as Swampert and Metagross. Toxic Spikes is a great support move, and Roserade can set up multiple layers reliably. The third moveslot is for Roserade's STAB move of choice. Leaf Storm is preferred for its sheer power, but Grass Knot can be used instead if the Special Attack drop Leaf Storm causes is unattractive. If the inconsistency of both moves is unappealing to you, then Energy Ball is a fairly decent replacement, albeit much less powerful than Leaf Storm. In the final moveslot, Hidden Power Fire is the primary option, as it allows Roserade to hit Skarmory and Forretress leads that would otherwise easily lay entry hazards against it. Hidden Power Ice is a good option as well for its ability to OHKO Gliscor and Dragonite, the latter of which will often switch in on Roserade in order to attempt to set up with Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Roserade can also use Hidden Power Ground to beat Heatran and Occa Berry Metagross leads, which Roserade otherwise has difficulty damaging. However, its use outside of this function is extremely limited, and so you are usually better off sticking to one of the aforementioned Hidden Power options.</p> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Roserade to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible; this is important because Roserade is not very bulky, so it needs to be able to put opposing leads to sleep before they attack it. 252 Special Attack EVs are used so that Roserade can deal as much damage as possible with both its STAB attack and Hidden Power choice. The remaining EVs are placed in HP to give Roserade a one point boost. Focus Sash is the only item that should ever be used on this Roserade set, as it is otherwise OHKOed by many opposing leads and thus never gets the chance to set up Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>Heatran is one of the best partners to this set, as it is capable of switching in on many leads that otherwise threaten Roserade, such as Jirachi, and battering the opposition with its powerful Fire-type STAB attacks. It is also a capable user of Stealth Rock, which makes for a good complement to Roserade's entry hazards. In return, Roserade can switch in on Water-types that threaten Heatran. Magnezone also makes for a good partner, particularly if Roserade is running Hidden Power Ice; it can easily switch in on the numerous Steel-types that will attempt to KO or set up on Roserade, trap them with Magnet Pull, and proceed to KO them with its powerful Thunderbolt. Machamp leads are very troublesome for Roserade to take on, as they can absorb Sleep Powder with Lum Berry and use a combination of Ice Punch + Bullet Punch to swiftly KO Roserade. For this reason, defensive Rotom-A is a good partner to have, as it is immune to Dynamic Punch, takes little damage from Ice Punch, and can cripple Machamp with Will-O-Wisp (though Machamp's Lum Berry must be used first) or attack it with its STAB Thunderbolt. Rotom-A is also a great spinblocker and can prevent Roserade's precious Toxic Spikes from being spun away. It is also important to pair Roserade with Pokemon that enjoy Toxic Spikes support. SubRoost Zapdos and Torment Heatran and great examples of this; they are very stall-oriented Pokemon, and with Toxic Spikes support, their stalling is much swifter and easier to carry out.</p> "

        "name": "Spikes",
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Roserade's good base 105 Special Defense and ability to damage many common Rapid Spin users, it is an exceptional and often overlooked user of Spikes. Its sky-high Special Attack sets it apart from other Spikes users like Skarmory, as does its decent special bulk.</p> <p>Spikes is a great support move, wearing down opposing teams to the point where Roserade's teammates can sweep. Grass Knot is the primary choice for Roserade's STAB option, but Energy Ball works just as well if the inconsistency of Grass Knot is unappealing to you. Hidden Power Fire is used in the third slot to hit Steel-types that will commonly switch in on Roserade, such as Scizor and Skarmory, but Hidden Power Ice is a viable alternative if you wish to be able to hit Dragon-types such as Dragonite that otherwise set up on Roserade. It should be noted, however, that if you run Hidden Power Ice, Roserade loses the ability to hit Forretress, which will delight in switching in on Roserade, spinning away its Spikes, and then setting up Spikes of its own. In the last moveslot, you have several decent options to choose from. Stun Spore is the primary choice, as it allows Roserade to cut the Speed of its switch-ins; it also comes with the neat ability to paralyze Ground-types like Flygon, which are immune to most paralysis-inducing moves. Alternatively, Rest allows Roserade to fully recover its health, switch out, and return to the battlefield awake thanks to Natural Cure. Leech Seed can also be used if you want Roserade to further stall out opposing Pokemon while setting up Spikes; it also allows Roserade to stall Blissey, which would otherwise wall it completely.</p> <p>Synthesis can be used in the fourth moveslot in order to give Roserade an alternative instant recovery move. However, sand reduces Synthesis's recovery from 50% to 25% of Roserade's maximum HP. Tyranitar is common enough that Roserade will often be unable to tank the special attacks that it could otherwise; thus, Rest is the more reliable option for instant recovery.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Roserade to maintain acceptable physical bulk and excellent special bulk. With the given HP and Defense EVs, Roserade will always survive Adamant Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch, even after Stealth Rock damage. 136 Special Defense EVs and a Calm nature allow Roserade to easily switch in on resisted hits like Starmie's Surf and Rotom-A's Thunderbolt and proceed to set up Spikes. If surviving Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch isn't important to you, then an alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 136 SpD / 120 Spe can be used; it allows Roserade to outspeed 36 Speed Celebi, Zapdos, and Jirachi, as well as 252 Speed Jolly Tyranitar. Leftovers is the item of choice for its ability to recover Roserade's health slowly but surely.</p> <p>Good teammates for Roserade are Pokemon that will force a lot of switches; this allows the team to take advantage of its Spikes and wear down the opposition through indirect damage. The specific Pokemon to use alongside Roserade depend on the kind of team that you are using. If you are using a more stall-oriented team, then more defensive partners will be the better choices. A simple Skarmory + Blissey combination will form the famous \"SkarmBliss\" duo, capable of walling a significant portion of the metagame and forcing numerous switches. On an offensive team, Pokemon that force switches with their offensive presence are good partners for Roserade. Infernape, for instance, can switch in on a predicted Fire-type attack and use U-turn as the opponent switches to a counter, forcing the opposing team to accumulate more residual damage. Dragonite will also force a lot of switches with its versatility. Another effective way to take advantage of Roserade's Spikes is to utilize a Fire + Water + Grass defensive core. Using Roserade in tandem with a combination of Pokemon such as Heatran and Vaporeon will work well. This will force the opponent to switch multiple times due to the core's defensive synergy, racking up more Spikes damage and keeping your core at high health.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Roserade's amazing Special Attack and decent Speed, it is able to utilize a Choice Scarf set to great effect. The main selling point over other Choice Scarf users is Roserade's access to a blazing fast Sleep Powder, allowing it to outpace and cripple any unboosted Pokemon in the game.</p> <p>Leaf Storm is the main option in the first moveslot because of its immense power. Energy Ball is a less powerful, but more reliable, option for a more conservative player. Sludge Bomb gives Roserade an effective way of hitting the Pokemon that take little damage from Leaf Storm, such as Celebi and Dragonite. However, be wary when you're using Sludge Bomb, as it is a risky move on a Choice item user; opposing Steel-types will be able to switch in and set up on Roserade with their immunity to Poison-type attacks. Hidden Power Ice allows Roserade to outspeed and OHKO Dragonite and Gliscor; Dragonite in particular is a threat to this set because it can freely come in on Leaf Storm, so it helps to have a method of revenge killing it before a Dragon Dance boost. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ground is viable solely for hitting Heatran, which would otherwise be able to freely switch in on Roserade throughout the entire match and wreak havoc. Sleep Powder allows Roserade to outspeed and cripple almost any threat, which helps the team immensely in the long run.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire allows Roserade to hit most Steel-types that would otherwise be able to switch in on it, preventing them from walling this set. However, if you are using this set, you should already have a way to deal with Steel-types, so the need for Hidden Power Fire is alleviated. Roserade can also use Grass Knot, but its inconsistent Base Power is unattractive on a Choice item set, where Roserade cannot switch attacks.</p> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature are absolutely necessary because Roserade needs to be able to outspeed all of the threats it possibly can. 252 Special Attack EVs are used to boost Roserade's already immense Special Attack stat. The remaining EVs are placed in HP to give Roserade a tiny boost in defensive capability. A Modest nature is an alternative option if you wish to hit harder, but Roserade needs all the Speed it can get.</p> <p>When using Choice Scarf Roserade, you absolutely must have a Pokemon that can take out Steel-types, as they will otherwise be able to switch into it throughout the entire match with no consequences and be free to set up. Substitute Heatran in particular works splendidly with this set for this reason, as it can switch in on any Steel-type that can give Roserade problems, like Skarmory, set up a Substitute on the switch, and proceed to heavily damage the opposition with STAB Fire Blast. Heatran is an even better partner if it carries Explosion, as this allows it to lure in and OHKO Blissey, which otherwise walls both Heatran and Roserade completely. While Heatran is a great partner to this Roserade set, it is also a great counter should Roserade lack Hidden Power Ground. For this reason, bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Vaporeon work well alongside Roserade, as they can easily switch in on and scare off opposing Heatran. Both Fighting- and Fire-types are good offensive partners to this set; in particular, Infernape possesses both of these types, making it an ideal offensive partner for Roserade. It can easily break the Skarmory + Blissey combination that Roserade is completely helpless against.</p> "

        "name": "Life Orb",
        "description": "<p>This set aims to take advantage of Roserade's high Special Attack and above-average Speed by turning it into a pure special sweeper. While this set may appear to be outclassed by Life Orb Sceptile, Roserade has higher Special Attack and the advantage of being able to run a great support move in tandem with its attacking options, whether it be Sleep Powder, Spikes, or Toxic Spikes. Any one of these support moves works excellently on this set depending on your team's needs, making Roserade stand out from other all-out-attacking Life Orb users.</p> <p>Leaf Storm is the best option in the first moveslot for the immense power that it packs, but Energy Ball can be used instead if you want a more consistent move. Sludge Bomb is used in the second slot as a secondary STAB move that allows Roserade to severely damage Shaymin and other Roserade, as well as 2HKO offensive Dragonite. The third slot is for Roserade's choice of Hidden Power; Hidden Power Fire is the best option for hitting Steel-types such as Skarmory and Forretress, which otherwise completely wall Roserade, while Hidden Power Ground can be used instead as a means of hitting Heatran, which is immune to Sludge Bomb and has a 4x resistance to Leaf Storm. The final moveslot depends solely on your team's needs, and as such, there is no \"best\" option. Sleep Powder allows Roserade to cripple any switch-in bar status absorbers, such as RestTalk uers. However, Spikes or Toxic Spikes can be used if your team can take advantage of the entry hazard support. Using Spikes and Leaf Storm on the same set is illegal, so keep that in mind when deciding what moves to use.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ice can be used in place of the aforementioned Hidden Power types to OHKO Dragonite, Flygon, and Gliscor on the switch. However, Dragonite already takes a ton of damage from Sludge Bomb, while Flygon and Gliscor are both OHKOed by Leaf Storm; as such, Hidden Power Ice becomes mostly redundant. Expert Belt can be used to help Roserade bluff a Choice item and surprise a counter with Sleep Powder, but Life Orb grants it significantly more power and enables many key OHKOs, such as with Leaf Storm against Flygon.</p> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Roserade to outspeed as many threats as possible; considering Roserade isn't particularly bulky, it is important that it be fast. 252 Special Attack EVs are used so that Roserade hits as hard as it possibly can, and with its base 125 Special Attack stat, very few Pokemon can switch into it safely. The remaining EVs are placed in HP as filler. While some players might see it as a good idea to run a Modest nature on this set to deal more damage to incoming Pokemon, it is almost always more valuable to be able to outspeed and damage the opponent's Pokemon than to simply hit them harder as they switch in.</p> <p>Blissey completely walls this set; it does not care about Sleep Powder due to Natural Cure and can sponge all of Roserade's attacks with its astronomical Special Defense. Snorlax walls Roserade in a similar fashion, but Sleep Powder will shut it down temporarily. In order to deal with these Pokemon, offensive support is needed. Lucario makes for a good choice due to its ability to switch in on Blissey or a sleeping Snorlax, set up a Swords Dance, and sweep. Mixed Dragonite can break down stall teams that would otherwise usually have a solid response to this set. Mixed Infernape accomplishes the same thing and has the additional bonus of easily breaking the ubiquitous \"SkarmBliss\" combination. Unless this set runs Hidden Power Ground, Heatran will completely wall Roserade; as such, Dragon Dance Gyarados is a wonderful offensive partner to switch into Heatran and set up with Dragon Dance, though it must be wary of rare Hidden Power Electric variants. With entry hazard support, very few Pokemon will be able to switch into Roserade safely. Stealth Rock support is a must, as with it, Roserade is able to OHKO Shaymin with Sludge Bomb. Heatran itself makes for a great Stealth Rock setter because of its defensive synergy with Roserade. Spikes support is also a good idea when using this set, as it helps Roserade secure several key OHKOs. Physically defensive Skarmory is a good Spikes user alongside Roserade; although they share a weakness to Fire-type moves, Skarmory can switch into the physical moves that would otherwise easily take down Roserade.</p> "

        "name": "SubSeed",
        "description": "<p>This is a more stall-oriented Roserade set that combines its ability to use Spikes successfully with its ability to take resisted special attacks easily. Roserade's main advantage over other SubSeeders is its access to Spikes, its STAB-boosted Sludge Bomb, and its base 105 Special Defense.</p> <p>Substitute allows Roserade to set up a safety net against critical hits and status moves. It also forces opposing Pokemon to break Roserade's Substitute, giving it more time to stall them out. Leech Seed is used to allow Roserade to both stall out the foe and gain back some of its own HP at the same time. When used in tandem with Leftovers, Roserade will often have restored all of the health that it used to create a Substitute in just two turns. Sludge Bomb allows Roserade to nail Grass-type switch-ins, such as Celebi, for serious damage; this is important because they are immune to Leech Seed. Energy Ball is a passable option as well, allowing Roserade to hit bulky Water-type Pokemon as well as Pokemon that resist Sludge Bomb. Spikes is used in the final slot as a means of allowing Roserade to support the team while it stalls out the opposition with its SubSeed combination. With its base 105 Special Defense, Roserade can easily set up Spikes on powerful resisted special attacks and will often set up one to two layers, making it harder for the opponent to switch Pokemon.</p> <p>Roserade can use Hidden Power Fire in the third moveslot in order to hit Steel-types that will otherwise wall it completely. However, this leaves Roserade open to being set up on by many threats, such as Dragonite, and so it is often an inferior option, especially when you consider the fact that Roserade only has one attacking option on this set.</p> <p>This set's EVs maximize Roserade's defensive potential. 236 HP EVs allow for much more overall bulk and let Roserade take attacks that it otherwise would be unable to. 160 Special Defense EVs and a Calm nature allow Roserade to set up a Substitute on any resisted special attack with equal or lesser power than Modest Magnezone's STAB Thunderbolt. 112 Speed EVs allow Roserade to outspeed Jolly Tyranitar. If Speed is more important than overall defensive ability, then an alternate EV spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature becomes a viable option. While this spread does allow Roserade to outspeed and cripple more threats, it leaves it unable to easily set up a Substitute against many of the powerful special attackers that it could otherwise.</p> <p>Though this set is capable of handling many threats on its own, it can really shine with proper team support. Toxic Spikes support can be a huge blessing when used in tandem with a set like this; Roserade will often find itself stalling out foes, and with two layers of Toxic Spikes on the opponent's side of the field, it can do so much more easily and quickly. Tentacruel makes for a good choice to provide Toxic Spikes support, as it can also Rapid Spin away any entry hazards that the opposing team has set up, making it much easier for Roserade to switch in and begin stalling. If you aren't interested in Toxic Spikes, however, then paralysis support can be employed to allow Roserade to outspeed more threats and set up on them. Rotom-A is a good choice for this, as it is also capable of preventing the foe from spinning away Roserade's Spikes. Stealth Rock support also helps this set, as Roserade will be forcing a lot of switches with Leech Seed. Metagross, Swampert, and Heatran are solid Stealth Rock users, and all three synergize well with Roserade defensively. Taunt Gyarados will easily set up on this set, so Hidden Power Electric Vaporeon makes for a good defensive partner. Vaporeon can also pass Wishes to Roserade, keeping its health high.</p> "

The second moveslot is for Roserade's STAB move of choice. Leaf Storm is preferred for its sheer power, but Grass Knot is a viable alternative if Leaf Storm's Special Attack drop is unattractive. Weather Ball greatly benefits Roserade in weather, as it is essentially either a boosted Fire- or Water-type move in sun or rain, respectively. Roserade can use either Rain Dance and Damp Rock or Sunny Day and Heat Rock; the choice between the two depends on the kind of support that your team requires.</p> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Roserade to outspeed as many threats as possible; considering that Roserade isn't particularly bulky, it is important for it to be fast. The 252 Special Attack EVs ensure that Roserade hits as hard as possible with its massive base 125 Special Attack. Energy Ball is an option to consider if Leaf Storm and Grass Knot are unappealing to you.</p> <p>As it is Roserade's role to set up either Rain Dance or Sunny Day, Pokemon with Swift Swim or Chlorophyll are required for your team to take advantage of the weather it sets up. Heatran makes for a great partner, as it can come in on Fire-type attacks aimed at Roserade, get a Flash Fire boost, and start to wreak havoc if Sunny Day is up. Faster Taunt users can prevent Roserade from setting up weather or using Sleep Powder, but most of them are fragile and are OHKOed by Leaf Storm. Rapid Spin support is always welcome, as Roserade is quite frail, and thus the removal of entry hazards effectively increases Roserade's lifespan. Because Roserade is very physically frail, it will often get only one chance to set up weather, so a secondary weather setter makes for a viable teammate as well.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Togekiss fills a unique role in the OU metagame with its ability to serve as a sweeper, a specially defensive tank, or as a general annoyance. It's also one of the few users of Serene Grace, and it's certainly able to put it to good use with its great movepool. Togekiss's respectable typing provides it with enough ways to switch into combat and its above average defenses make it surprisingly difficult for opponents to shoot down this paper plane without STAB, super effective attacks.</p> <p>Togekiss has a few weaknesses that it needs to watch out for when being used, however. As it is weak to Rock-type attacks, it loses 25% of its HP upon switching into Stealth Rock. Additionally, Togekiss is not fast enough to outpace a large portion of the metagame, having only a base 80 Speed stat. This means that if you plan on having Togekiss successfully sweep, you will need to either spread paralysis around or eliminate your opponent's faster Pokemon. Despite these downfalls, Togekiss is a useful addition to any team with the right support.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Being a Normal-type, Togekiss's movepool is quite vast, and therefore it has many options to utilize. Togekiss can set up dual screens in order to better support its team. While a set like this is largely outclassed by other Pokemon, such as Bronzong and Uxie, Togekiss's Normal / Flying typing can give it a unique niche as a dual screener; its Stealth Rock weakness is disappointing, however. Grass Knot is also a solid choice to wear down Ground- and Water-types, such as Hippowdon and Swampert. Unfortunately, it is often hard to find a place for it on a set. Yawn can be used to force switches, and considering that Togekiss is usually used with entry hazard support, you can find yourself racking up big damage against an opponent. Counter can be used to take out physical attackers, although if you predict incorrectly, the results could be unfavorable. Tri Attack can be used as a secondary source of special STAB, but it gets poor neutral coverage with Air Slash.</p> <p>For most Togekiss sets, capitalizing on its impressive bulk is a must. That's why it is usually a good idea to maximize Togekiss's HP. However, if you are using a more offensive set, like the Choice Scarf variant, then a simple 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe spread works just fine as well. 104 Speed EVs can be used to outrun Adamant Tyranitar, but you can just as easily use more Speed in order to beat Jolly non-Choice Scarf variants. Taking advantage of Togekiss's awesome Special Attack is always a good idea, so if you find yourself with spare EVs, dumping them in Special Attack won't hurt.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Status seriously cripples basically all variants of Togekiss. Blissey and Cresselia come to mind as the best choices to abuse this weakness, taking pittance from Togekiss's attacks and being able to heal off any damage taken while threatening paralysis or poison. Lanturn can also come in on Togekiss with its resistance to Air Slash and threaten it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p>A few other defensive and offensive Pokemon alike stand out for being able to switch into Togekiss with relative impunity. Zapdos resists both Air Slash and Aura Sphere, and with its greater Speed stat can set up a Substitute before being hit by Thunder Wave. Jolteon or Electivire can come in on a predicted Air Slash or Thunder Wave and immediately threaten Togekiss. Rotom-A can also switch in safely as it is immune to Aura Sphere and resists Air Slash. All of these Pokemon have high-power, super effective attacks and status moves that threaten Togekiss. Bronzong also takes little damage from Air Slash and paralysis causes its Gyro Ball to hit harder.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This Togekiss takes a more conventional route toward sweeping, taking advantage of its massive Special Attack, good defenses, and access to Roost in order to successfully obtain a Nasty Plot boost. With a Modest nature, a boosted Air Slash does catastrophic damage, OHKOing Scizor after Stealth Rock, while scoring 2-3HKOs even on Pokemon who resist it. When you combine Air Slash's flinch rate and Togekiss's bulk, you'll find that it has no problem sweeping teams that are sufficiently weakened. Unlike most Nasty Plot sweepers, Togekiss has both instant recovery in Roost and the bulk needed to take down opponents without worrying about taking excessive damage; even weaker super effective hits won't significantly damage it.</p> <p>Aura Sphere is for Tyranitar, who threatens an OHKO with Stone Edge. Aura Sphere OHKOes right back after a Nasty Plot, while also providing useful extra damage against Blissey, Metagross, Heatran, and other Pokemon who resist Flying. While Air Slash is often the primary attack against these foes, Aura Sphere allows you to finish off these Pokemon at higher percentages. Heal Bell is extremely useful against stall teams, allowing Togekiss to switch in and absorb status attacks, while providing the means to win against even Toxic Blissey 1-on-1 in tandem with Roost.</p> <p>Substitute is an option if you use Aura Sphere. Using it on the switch allows you to scout out threats such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Pokemon with status moves. You won't beat Seismic Toss + Toxic Blissey with it, but it may be useful in providing some rudimentary status prevention. Safeguard can do effectively the same job as Heal Bell, but instead of healing the rest of the team, it provides a safety net if Togekiss is forced to switch out, with the additional benefit of having more PP. The drawback is that it does not allow Togekiss to switch into status attacks. Lum Berry is an option that lets you beat Blissey 60% of the time. If you Plot on the switch, and then Plot again as she statuses you, a 2HKO is possible by using Air Slash, hoping for a flinch, followed by Aura Sphere.</p> <p>The EV spread takes advantage of Togekiss's impressive bulk by maximizing its already-awesome HP stat. If you want to be able to OHKO Scizor with a +2 Air Slash after Stealth Rock, however, then you can take some EVs out of HP and place them into Special Attack; 192 Special Attack EVs are enough to ensure the OHKO. 220 Speed EVs are used to outrun Modest Heatran, and if you don't care about Heatran, you can lower that number to boost Togekiss's Special Attack further. If you invest at least 192 EVs in HP, Vaporeon will never 2HKO with Ice Beam after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Togekiss's main concerns are Rotom-A and Zapdos. While this set does a little better against them than other sets, they are both still big threats to Togekiss's sweep and need to be dealt with beforehand. Pursuit users are great teammates to pair with Togekiss, as they get rid of Rotom; this allows Togekiss's team to use a Rapid Spinner to clear away Stealth Rock. Heracross is probably the best choice since it isn't bothered by Will-O-Wisp, but Metagross, Tyranitar, and Snorlax all work as well. With Rotom out of the way, Rapid Spin support from Starmie, Forretress, or Tentacruel helps tremendously as without Stealth Rock, Togekiss can switch in and out repeatedly at will, giving it a good chance against Zapdos. Stealth Rock support will hurt Zapdos enough to make it unable to repeatedly switch into play. If you pack Tyranitar for Rotom, it also makes a great Zapdos check, boasting high Special Defense and super effective STAB Rock-type attacks.</p> <p>Paralysis support helps tremendously as Togekiss isn't the fastest sweeper in the game. Pokemon such as Jirachi, Gyarados, and Celebi can all provide useful paralysis support. Jirachi in particular is nice as it lures out Starmie, whom you can Pursuit.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<p>This set takes a more offensive approach to Nasty Plot Togekiss. While many Togekiss sets aim to exploit its impressive bulk, this set takes advantage of its massive Special Attack and decent Speed. Very few Pokemon will be able to switch in on this Togekiss safely once it secures a Nasty Plot boost; indeed, every Pokemon in the OU tier is at the very least 2HKOed by a +2 Togekiss.</p> <p>Nasty Plot allows Togekiss to boost its already high Special Attack to astronomical levels in just one turn of set up. Air Slash is Togekiss's STAB move, and comes with a neat 60% flinch rate, thanks to Serene Grace. Fire Blast is used to hit Pokemon such as Jirachi and Bronzong, who resist Togekiss's Air Slash. It also sees additional use in its ability to OHKO 252 HP Zapdos and Rotom-A who resist all of Togekiss's other moves and can otherwise set up on it. Roost is the best choice in the final slot for its ability to heal Togekiss's health, prolonging its sweep. However, Aura Sphere can be used instead to give Togekiss a means of hitting Tyranitar and Heatran, who will otherwise wall Togekiss.</p> <p>Another interesting option for a move is Shadow Ball. With it, Togekiss is able to hit Rotom-A for high damage right off the bat. However, it has very little use beyond this, and so is often better off untouched.</p> <p>The EV spread is customized to fit Togekiss's needs. After a Nasty Plot boost, Togekiss's Life Orb Fire Blast will do a minimum of 87% damage to 252 HP Rotom-A, while 252 HP Zapdos is hit for at least 80% damage. With Stealth Rock support, Togekiss is able to easily OHKO both of the aforementioned Pokemon. 236 Speed EVs and a Timid nature are used as they allow Togekiss to outspeed Adamant Lucario and proceed to scorch it with Fire Blast for an OHKO. The remaining EVs are placed into HP, giving Togekiss an impressive HP stat of 359; when you combine this number and Togekiss's already impressive defenses, you'll find that you have both a sturdy and powerful sweeper on your hands.</p> <p>One of the most important things to have when using this Togekiss set is Stealth Rock support. It allows Togekiss to achieve several notable OHKOes that it otherwise would not be able to, so it is a necessity. Swampert is a good choice for the role of a Stealth Rock user as he and Togekiss cover each other's weaknesses very well. Metagross is another capable teammate for the same reason. Rapid Spin support can also be a big factor when using this Togekiss. It will lose 25% of its health every time it switches in, which means that it will be put at a disadvantage from the very first time it comes into play, and will not be able to sweep quite as easily. For this reason, Rapid Spin support is extremely beneficial alongside this Togekiss; Life Orb Rapid Spin Starmie is a good choice for this. It can switch in easily on many attacks that would otherwise threaten Togekiss, such as Ice Beam, and proceed to either spin or beat down the opposing team with its powerful STAB attacks. It is also a great offensive partner alongside Togekiss. While not at all necessary, Thunder Wave support is an interesting option to use alongside this set, as it allows Togekiss to outspeed and severely damage Pokemon who would otherwise be faster than it. Celebi is capable of using Thunder Wave well, and works decently on a defensive level alongside Togekiss.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Serene Grace is definitely not wasted on a Pokemon like Togekiss. A 60% flinch rate combined with paralysis support leaves the opposing Pokemon with only a 30% chance of doing anything at all. Combine this with Togekiss's general bulk and recovery in the form of Roost, and it can pose a serious threat to an opponent's team.</p> <p>Air Slash is mandatory for STAB and flinching on Togekiss. Thunder Wave is the most reliable option in the second slot to paralyze whoever your opponent might switch into Togekiss. Body Slam is another option to use in order to have the ability to paralyze Pokemon immune to Thunder Wave. The third slot has numerous options to choose from. Aura Sphere is the primary choice to round out Togekiss's coverage, hitting Rock- and Steel-types particularly hard. Nasty Plot is available to help Togekiss sweep, although it should be noted that it's illegal with Body Slam. Substitute can also be used to make Togekiss even harder and more annoying to take down and keep it safe from status. The last move is given to Roost to provide Togekiss with reliable recovery.</p> <p>The EVs and nature are chosen to give Togekiss enough physical bulk so that Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch will never 2HKO you even after Stealth Rock is taken into account. The rest of the EVs are placed into Special Defense to add as much special bulk as possible. No Speed investment is used here as the set should attempt to paralyze as much as possible before trying to sweep.</p> <p>Pokemon who further help spread paralysis around an opponent's team are great candidates for teammates to this Togekiss. Jirachi, carrying Iron Head and its own paralysis-inducing attack, immediately comes to mind. Jirachi can also switch into the Rock- and Ice-type attacks aimed at Togekiss with ease. Celebi and Blissey can spread paralysis around quite effectively, although it should be noted that they share much of their counter lists with Togekiss. Magnezone resists all of the attacks Togekiss is weak to, while Togekiss will gladly switch into Ground-type attacks aimed at Magnezone. Magnezone will also happily remove the Steel-type Pokemon who resist Togekiss's Air Slash. Entry hazard support should definitely be considered with this Togekiss as well, since once the opponent is paralyzed and can't hit Togekiss, they will not want to stay in and sacrifice their Pokemon. Speaking of entry hazards, Rapid Spin support is worth considering to give Togekiss an easier time switching in. Forretress can perform this role admirably by being able to sponge up the attacks aimed at Togekiss and set up Spikes or Rapid Spin as they switch out.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>A quick and easy fix to Togekiss's middling Speed is to slap a Choice Scarf on it. Many of the Pokemon who switch into Togekiss expecting to outspeed it are quickly worn down by repeated attacks and possibly flinched to death. Combine this with an arsenal of respectable attacks, good coverage, and Serene Grace and Togekiss can be a dangerous threat to your opponent. Choice Scarf Togekiss can even make for a decent lead, shutting down many common leads right off the bat by flinching them to death with Air Slash. It also has access to Trick, which enables it to cripple common Stealth Rock users such as Swampert and Metagross right off the bat.</p> <p>Air Slash is chosen for its flinch rate and STAB, while Aura Sphere is chosen for the excellent secondary coverage it provides. Fire Blast is recommended in the third slot to guarantee the 2HKO on standard Bronzong and the OHKO on standard Skarmory. Flamethrower is a viable alternative to Fire Blast for the added accuracy, but the lost OHKOs are a letdown. Trick is recommended in the final slot to cripple popular switch-ins to this Togekiss, namely Blissey, who will otherwise easily wall Togekiss. However, many other moves could be used as well, such as Tri Attack, Shadow Ball, and Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p>Timid is used to let you outspeed Choice Scarf Heatran and base 130 Speed Pokemon, most notably Jolteon. Modest can be used if you don't plan on using Trick, but failing to outspeed the aforementioned Pokemon can be very detrimental to Togekiss's usefulness. The EV spread is chosen to give Togekiss five switches into Stealth Rock while maximizing its Speed and Special Attack.</p> <p>As this Togekiss isn't nearly as slow as other sets, it can find its way into offensive teams. The biggest advantages Togekiss carries over other Choice Scarf users is its very respectable special bulk and ability to flinch its opponents, making it able to take down even threats that aren't 2HKOed by its attacks. Rapid Spin support is incredibly important to this Togekiss, as it will be switching in and out a lot. Forretress stands out from the crowd as an excellent Rapid Spinner to complement Togekiss, absorbing many of the physical attacks thrown at it and also providing invaluable entry hazard support.</p> "

  "Dusknoir": {
    "overview": "<p>With its pure Ghost typing blocking Rapid Spin, high base 135 defenses, and decent Attack stat, Dusknoir has potential to be a great defensive Pokemon. However, it is completely outclassed by Rotom-A as a defensive Pokemon and spinblocker. Although it has superior defensive stats, Dusknoir suffers from a lack of useful resistances. Above all, Dusknoir has a crippling vulnerability to all entry hazards, which is worsened by its lack of reliable recovery. Rotom-A and more offensive spinblocker Gengar lack reliable recovery too, but they critically are immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. This hazards vulnerability means Dusknoir will be quickly worn down and unable to do its job consistently. Dusknoir is also plagued by an awful Speed stat, forcing it to take a hit first before retaliating. These attributes leave it much more vulnerable to offensive pressure than both Rotom-A and Gengar, particularly when facing Tyranitar and Jirachi, premier Pokemon in DPP OU. Dusknoir could try to scrounge up a niche with its good physical coverage and priority, which allow it to damage Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Forretress super effectively without relying on the inaccurate Focus Blast or status with Will-O-Wisp. Such traits, however, generally are not enough to make it worth using in DPP OU.</p> ",

  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gengar is a potent threat in DPP OU due to its unique mix of utility and offensive firepower. Gengar’s typing, speed, and ability make it an offensive spinblocker and allows it to check several threats through its immunities to Normal-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks, such as Breloom, Lucario, and Gliscor. Unlike the other prominent Ghost-type, Rotom-A, Gengar has Focus Blast to OHKO bulkless Tyranitar and 2HKO Clefable. Focus Blast also provides Gengar perfect coverage in two moves alongside Shadow Ball, giving it many opportunities to take advantage of its large movepool to diversify its options. With Will-O-Wisp and Taunt, Gengar shuts down defensive counterplay from Hippowdon, Blissey, and Clefable while spreading burns to Bronzong, Jirachi, and Skarmory. Substitute sets can take advantage of the switches it forces to either heal itself with Pain Split or power through checks such as Scizor and Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Gengar’s access to Explosion and coverage options such as Thunderbolt make it a powerful force, as it hits Pokemon such as Latias, Blissey, and Gyarados very hard.</p> <p>Gengar’s primary flaws lie in its weakness to Dark-types, frailty, and prominent low accuracy moves. Tyranitar is the bane of Gengar’s existence, as despite being able to OHKO it with Focus Blast and burn it with Will-O-Wisp, Choice Scarf Tyranitar outspeeds Gengar and traps it with Pursuit, removing it from the game with certainty after two rounds of Stealth Rock damage. Scizor fares similarly; although it fears the rare Hidden Power Fire and doesn’t appreciate being burned, it checkmates Gengar with Bullet Punch and Pursuit. While Gengar is very strong, it doesn’t OHKO everything, is frail, and despises status—faster Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Flygon, Magnezone, Rotom-A, and Latias can outspeed and OHKO it, while bulkier threats such as Swampert, Dragonite, Zapdos, Heatran, and Suicune can survive a hit and KO it back. Gengar also can be very frustrating to use, as both Focus Blast and Will-O-Wisp have subpar accuracy and the inevitable miss can be catastrophic.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>On its utility set, Gengar has many other options it can use alongside or instead of Will-O-Wisp and Taunt, such as Destiny Bond, Knock Off, Sleep Talk, Protect, Snatch, Mean Look, and Perish Song. Finding the best option often depends on the rest of the team and what Gengar needs to do. Destiny Bond is one of the more prominent options, as Gengar's frailty often means it can faint the opponent, such as slower Tyranitar using Crunch, along with it. On more defensive teams, espcially without Choice Scarf Tyranitar, one of the primary first checks to Gengar is Clefable. Knock Off removes items and make Clefable much more vulnerable to both itself and attackers such as mixed Flygon. Sleep Talk makes Gengar a premier sleep absorber, as both Breloom and Roserade are hit hard by any move Gengar pulls while asleep. Protect alongside Hidden Power Fire is an antiquated option to avoid being Pursuit trapped by Choiced locked attackers such as Tyranitar and Scizor. Snatch is a priority move that stops Choice Scarf Lucario using Copycat while stealing certain non-attacking moves such as Clefable's Soft-Boiled and Latias's Calm Mind. Mean Look and Perish Song are excellent ways to force Clefable and other walls to faint, as they typically cannot damage Gengar enough to avoid fainting to Perish Song. With Substitute, Gengar can also use Hypnosis. Being behind a Substitute gives Gengar more chances to use Hypnosis, as the payoff if it hits is excellent. On more offensive sets, Gengar can also use Hidden Power Ice, Sludge Bomb, and Energy Ball to hit specific targets, but often is not worth the moveslot.</p> <p>Gengar has a great deal of item diversity as well. The most prominent of these is a Choice Scarf set, as Gengar is fast and can revenge kill various sweepers such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Agility Empoleon with its coverage and Explosion. Such a set is quite vulnerable to Tyranitar and Scizor using Pursuit. Offensive sets enjoy a wide variety of items, such as Custap Berry to KO Starmie after switching into Hydro Pump to block Rapid Spin, Colbur Berry to avoid being KOed by Pursuit, Wide Lens to better facilitate its low accuracy attacks, and Expert Belt to power up its attacks without recoil. Gengar does miss the passive healing of Black Sludge or the power of Life Orb, however.</p> <p>Gengar almost always uses max Speed to tie with Latias and itself while also outspeeding Infernape, Jirachi, Flygon, and Zapdos. However, Gengar is free to invest heavily in its bulk instead of Special Attack. Gengar needs 72 Defense EVs to survive Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch, and can run more bulk to survive Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Pursuit at lower health. Beware that Choice Scarf Tyranitar will OHKO even Bold max HP / max Defense Gengar after Stealth Rock and sand with Crunch and attempts to survive that without a Colbur Berry are futile. Gengar also loses OHKOs on Heatran and Tyranitar from Focus Blast without max Special Attack EVs.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: While Gengar can hit most Dark-types hard with Focus Blast and they don't appreciate getting burned, Dark-types especially with Pursuit can ruin Gengar. The most common one is Tyranitar, as Choice Scarf sets outspeed Gengar and can remove it whether it switches or not, while bulkier sets can survive Focus Blast and remove it with Pursuit. Weavile and Spiritomb are much rarer than Tyranitar, but have their own advantages: Weavile naturally outspeeds Gengar and its Pursuit boosted by Life Orb, Expert Belt, or Choice Band OHKOs Gengar from full. Spiritomb is immune to Focus Blast while being neutral to Shadow Ball and can checkmate Gengar with Sucker Punch and Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types, especially if they are neutral to  Focus Blast, are effective checks to Gengar. Scizor, Jirachi, Bronzong, Skarmory, Forretress, and Metagross can take two Focus Blast or Shadow Ball and at least 2HKO Gengar in return. Scizor is the best of these, as its Bullet Punch hits Gengar hard before it can attack and Pursuit removes Gengar should it switch. None of these like being burned, howerver. Even Steel-types that don't resist Focus Blast can answer Gengar if they are bulky enough, such as Heatran and Empoleon. Choice Scarf Magnezone outspeeds Gengar and OHKOs it with Thunderbolt after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Clefable: Both of the prominent defensive Normal-types can check Gengar. Blissey is especially prevalent, as if Gengar lacks Taunt or Substitute, it easily survives even Life Orb Focus Blast and paralyzes Gengar with Thunder Wave. Blissey can also use special moves such as Ice Beam and Thunder to damage Gengar. Clefable does not have the raw bulk Blissey has and is 2HKOed by Focus Blast, but does have Knock Off to remove Black Sludge and Life Orb while potentially using Encore on Substitute. Both do not appreciate Explosion, however.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Gengar is severely crippled by paralysis and burn, as paralysis slows it down and exposes its weak bulk while burn exacerbates residual damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: While Gengar is fast and strong, it is also incredibly fragile and most neutral attacks will at least score a 2HKO. Swampert, Dragonite, Suicune, and Zapdos can survive at least one attack and KO Gengar back. Chople Berry also helps Pokemon weak to Focus Blast, such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Magnezone, survive the attack and KO back.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Choice Scarf users such as Tyranitar, Flygon, Latias, and Rotom-A can all revenge kill Gengar. Naturally faster Pokemon such as Starmie can pressure Gengar once it switches in.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Especially if Gengar has a Life Orb, it is worn down quickly from sand and Stealth Rock. This can make it difficult to continually pressure defensive teams. Bulky phasers such as Hippowdon and Skarmory can survive even its Life Orb boosted attacks and phase it out. Having to come in again can put it range of weaker or resisted attacks, such as defensive Empoleon Surf, Skarmory's Brave Bird, and Breloom's Seed Bomb.</p> ",

        "name": "Utility",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball in tandem with Focus Blast provides Gengar with perfect coverage, enabling it to offensively threaten a large portion of the metagame. This coverage gives Gengar flexibility to function as a solid utility Pokemon and stallbreaker. It compensates for its awful base defensive stats with a solid defensive typing and access to Will-O-Wisp. This variant takes advantage of the fact that many common switch-ins to Gengar, such as Tyranitar, Scizor, and Jirachi, are severely crippled by the burn. Alongside Will-O-Wisp, Gengar has two prominent options in Taunt and Explosion. Taunt enables Gengar to prevent defensive threats like Clefable, Blissey, Skarmory, Jirachi, Zapdos, and Suicune from healing themselves up or statusing it and stops offensive threats like Dragon Dance Dragonite and Gyarados and Calm Mind Suicune and Jirachi from setting up. Explosion is a more offensive option than Taunt, as it immediately removes a prominent wall such as Clefable or a sweeper such as Dragonite and Gyarados. Will-O-Wisp and Focus Blast helps to dissuade Steel-types and other resists from switching in to absorb Explosion</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature help Gengar Speed tie with non-Choice Scarf variants of Gengar and Latias while letting it outspeed non-Choice Scarf Jirachi and Infernape. 80 HP EVs guarantee Gengar survives non-Life Orb Starmie's Hydro Pump from full after Stealth Rock damage, which lets Gengar spinblock against it. They also allow it to survive Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Pursuit from full after Stealth Rock damage and give a comfortable damage roll against Breloom's Seed Bomb as well as burned Swampert's Waterfall and Jirachi's Iron Head. The remaining EVs are invested in Special Attack to pump up Gengar's damage output. Gengar can run a Naive nature to help power up Explosion, as a Hasty nature would allow Tyranitar to Pursuit it more easily.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As Gengar is not exactly bulky to begin with, the best way to bring it on the field is by switching it into the very popular Fighting-, Normal-, and Ground-type attacks from Pokemon like Infernape and Jirachi as well as Choice-locked Pokemon like Flygon and Heracross. Then, Gengar's coverage and natural offensive presence make it excellent at forcing switches, which gives it more opportunities to spread burns. Once foes like Jirachi, Scizor, and Tyranitar are crippled, Gengar has a much easier time dealing with them, since they mostly rely on physical hits. On top of that, Gengar's Ghost typing is useful to prevent Starmie from spinning, and it can be sacrificed to Starmie's Hydro Pump to allow a teammate like Pursuit Choice Scarf Tyranitar to revenge kill it, which helps keep entry hazards up. Also, keep in mind the drop in damage against certain important targets due to the lack of Special Attack investment; specifically, Focus Blast no longer guarantees an OHKO against bulkless Heatran and Tyranitar, which obviously makes things even dicier against bulkier sets.</p> <p>When facing more defensive archetypes, this Gengar can be a pain to beat because status absorbers like Clefable and RestTalk Rotom-A lose to it one-on-one. It basically forces a foe like Jirachi, Skarmory, Hippowdon, or Bronzong to be burned, which considerably hampers its durability. Taunt is an absolute nightmare for foes that generally sponge Gengar's attacks, as it prevents them from healing. However, using Taunt against Bold Zapdos when you expect it to use Roost is risky, since even uninvested Thunderbolt will significantly damage Gengar. These defensive foes also often don’t expect Explosion, meaning Gengar can take out a wall trying to stomach its attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gengar works well alongside entry hazards, as it forces a lot of switches and can remove some threats with the combination of Will-O-Wisp and either Taunt or Explosion. On top of that, Gengar's Ghost typing is useful to keep them up because it prevents Starmie from spinning. Skarmory is the premier choice, as it can set up multiple layers of Spikes, which supports Gengar in the long run to help deal with threats like Jirachi and Heatran. Skarmory can also take advantage of having Jirachi and Metagross burned, as it will take a pittance of damage from Fire Punch and Explosion. Roserade also appreciates Gengar’s ability to help with more defensive teams and isn’t vulnerable to being trapped by Magnezone. Other prominent Spikes partners work great: Swampert can set up Stealth Rock and can switch into Steel-type moves, while Gengar's typing helps it deal with Grass-types, especially Breloom, as it is also immune to Fighting-type moves. Choice Specs Latias can help wear down Choice Scarf Tyranitar so that Gengar can more easily ravage defensive teams relying on Tyranitar to remove Gengar, while Gengar can burn Steel-types trying to absorb Latias’s Draco Meteor. Lucario particularly appreciates having Jirachi burned and the residual damage from entry hazards wearing down foes and has great typing synergy with Gengar. Life Orb Flygon helps wear down opposing Steel-types and walls for Gengar, while Gengar can potentially Knock Off Clefable’s Leftovers and helps block Rapid Spin. Tyranitar is a very interesting option, especially Choice Scarf Tyranitar, as it almost ensures with Gengar that Starmie will not remove hazards. Gengar also helps switch into attacks Tyranitar is weak to.</p> <p>Steel-types in general are awesome to pair with Gengar, as they provide key resistances, and Gengar helps with switching into Ground- and Fighting-type attacks. Heatran can take advantage of the burns Gengar spreads with moves like Magma Storm and Protect and appreciates Toxic Spikes that Roserade could set. Magnezone can take advantage of having Jirachi burned to have an easier time trapping it, while it helps Gengar at dealing with Steel-types. Empoleon really appreciates having foes like Clefable, Blissey, and specially defensive Jirachi being worn down by the combination of Taunt and Will-O-Wisp, or even removed with Explosion. Gliscor is also a great option, as it forms a nice Fighting-resistant core and uses Taunt or even Swords Dance, compounding with Gengar to pressure defensive teams. Gengar additionally is excellent on more hyper offensive Spikes teams as an aggressive spinblocker. Teammates such as Trick + Iron Ball Metagross, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and offensive Calm Mind Jirachi appreciate how Gengar can burn Steel-types and its ability to keep walls low with Taunt or remove them with Explosion.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Gengar’s frailty and ability to force switches with its offensive pressure make it a perfect candidate for Substitute. Substitute blocks prominent ways of neutralizing Gengar, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar and offensive Scizor, status, bulkier foes surviving a hit and KOing back, and Clefable’s Knock Off, which doesn’t break the Substitute. Substitute also facilitates Pain Split, as with Life Orb recoil, it lowers Gengar’s health further to increase healing on high HP walls such as Blissey, Hippowdon, and Clefable. However, since this Gengar is highly susceptible to phasing because it lacks Taunt and can be worn down quickly, another option is Trick alongside Black Sludge. In conjunction with Black Sludge, Gengar can easily wear down walls reliant on Leftovers recovery. It is especially useful against defensive Jirachi, as with Substitute to take its attacks and Black Sludge wearing it down, it struggles to continually heal with Wish and Protect. Shadow Ball and Focus Blast become even more powerful behind a Substitute, as few Pokemon avoid a 2HKO from Gengar’s potentially Life Orb boosted attacks. The Substitute also helps if Gengar misses Focus Blast, as it will have another chance to use it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A simple maximum Speed and Special Attack EV spread with a Timid nature help Gengar be as strong and fast as possible. Life Orb is the item of choice with Pain Split, as Pain Split helps to offset the damage and makes Gengar’s attacks hit hard. However, Gengar is worn down extremely quickly with Life Orb recoil and HP needed to make a Substitute. Black Sludge helps to minimize this residual damage and allows it to continually make Substitute. Black Sludge is critical with Trick to wear down walls besides Clefable and Poison-types.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Especially with Life Orb, Gengar should only come in on moves it is immune to or through free switches, as even with Pain Split, it can be worn down quite quickly and despises being statused.  Once it has set up a Substitute, Gengar is free to attack and heal itself as it needs to. Pain Split is not reliable recovery, however, and it prone to being taking advantage of. Multiple low health foes, Gengar not being behind a Substitute, and phasing it before it can heal could keep it at low health. Try to vary the timing of Pain Split to avoid being too predictable.</p> <p>While Gengar can be very effective against more defensive teams that struggle to pressure it behind a Substitute, Gengar should be careful to not trade with a threat if it gets too low on health. With Black Sludge, Gengar should scout what it wants to use Trick on, as hitting Clefable trying to stall out Focus Blast is unproductive.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gengar appreciates free switches into its immunities above all else, so partners that can do this are excellent. U-turn users such as Choice Scarf Flygon and Scizor are effective, as they can U-turn Gengar into walls that cannot really hurt it. Another option is Steel-types with Substitute such as Heatran and Empoleon, as if they invite in Ground- and Fighting-types attacks that Gengar can switch in. Walls such as Blissey and Clefable almost certainly will not try to status or Knock Off on a Substitute. Gengar also appreciates entry hazards to further facilitate it wearing down the opponent. While Substitute sets are not as effective at keeping up entry hazards due to its frailty, they do allow it to power through bulkier foes with Life Orb. Skarmory and Roserade are effective at setting up Spikes and appreciate the extra power Gengar has against more defensive opponents. Other Spikes offense partners are effective such as Latias, Swampert, Lucario, mixed Flygon, and offensive Jirachi are effective. Latias especially appreciates Gengar, as with Substitute, Gengar can potentially turn the table on Tyranitar and remove it. Latias provides crucial defensive utility that bulkless Gengar struggles to provide, such as against Breloom and other Fighting-types. Latias and Choice Scarf Flygon appreciate Gengar using Trick on Steel-types such as Jirachi, Bronzong, and Metagross, while Tyranitar and offensive Trick Room Bronzong appreciate defensive Jirachi being worn down with Black Sludge.</p> <p>Substitute Gengar espcially appreciates Magnezone, as it can trap opposing Skarmory trying to survive Focus Blast and phase out Gengar. It also can trap Scizor, Jirachi, Bronzong, and Metagross, who can survive two Shadow Ball and remove Gengar, while Scizor's Bullet Punch and Pursuit combo devastate frailer Gengar. Other prominent Magnezone offensive partners such as Swords Dance Gliscor, Breloom, Metagross, and Gyarados appreciate the Magnezone and Gengar pairing.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>An offensive Gengar with full access to its coverage moves and support movepool can be scary to deal with. Shadow Ball and Focus Blast give Gengar complete type coverage and hit some of the metagame's top threats for super effective damage. Focus Blast always OHKOes max HP Tyranitar in sandstorm, easily 2HKOs Clefable even after Knock Off, and always OHKOs min HP Heatran. Explosion is the most prominent other attacking option, as it OHKOs most offensive Pokemon that do not resist it such as Gyarados and Dragonite while also OHKOing Blissey and offensive Suicune after Stealth Rock and sand. Thunderbolt is another option, as it offers a quick OHKO against Gyarados, even OHKOing it through Wacan Berry after Stealth Rock, and 2HKOes max HP Suicune. The most prominent last option is Taunt. Taunt shuts down defensive foes such as Hippowdon, Jirachi, Blissey, Skarmory, and Latias from surviving the hit and healing or crippling Gengar in return. Especially since some of the Pokemon cannot damage Gengar, it forces a switch for Gengar to take advantage of another Pokemon. Hidden Power Fire can be used for its additional power against most Steel-types, most notably Scizor and Forretress, but running Hidden Power Fire forces Gengar to have an imperfect Speed IV. This IV means that Gengar will almost always lose the speed tie against Latias and other Gengar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A simple maximum Speed and Special Attack EV spread with either a Naive nature should Gengar use Explosion or a Timid nature helps Gengar be as strong and fast as possible. Life Orb is the most common item to make Gengar’s attacks hit hard, since it is not aiming to take many hits anyway. Gengar can use a few more Attack EVs to guarantee KOing Blissey with Explosion after Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Gengar is quite frail and generally should only come in on its immunities or on free switches. From here, it should take advantage of its additional moveslots, as having both Taunt and Explosion or increased coverage such as Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Fire is often unexpected from Gengar. Gengar should be very careful against potential Pursuit users such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Scizor, as this set has no protection against it and Gengar will frequently be in range of Pursuit even if it stays in.</p> <p>Gengar should generally stay away from it cannot heavily damage effectively, as without Will-O-Wisp, Steel-types that are neutral to Focus Blast, such as Jirachi, Metagross, and Scizor can survive the hit and status or KO Gengar. Faster Steel-types such as Choice Scarf Heatran and Choice Scarf Lucario can switch into Shadow Ball and revenge kill Gengar. Even with Hidden Power Fire, Gengar often can't OHKO bulkier Steel-types. As such, Gengar is typically a hit and run attacker until it sacrifices itself for a teammate.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Offensive Gengar typically features on more fast paced Spikes teams that appreciate the additional power and chances to block Starmie's Rapid Spin. Offensive Skarmory with Stealth Rock and Spikes is an excellent partner, as opposing Rapid Spin is often catastrophic and Gengar enjoys entry hazards wearing down the foe. Skarmory fainting while setting up entry hazards also gives Gengar a free switch. Other offensive partners such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Trick + Iron Ball Metagross, offensive Calm Mind Latias, and Lucario are excellent teammates. Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragon Dance Tyranitar appreciate Gengar wearing down defensive answers such as Jirachi and Skarmory, while they also appreciate Spikes and Stealth Rock wearing down grounded walls. Gengar also can KO or keep specially defensive Skarmory low on health with Taunt and Thunderbolt. Trick + Iron Ball Metagross can also help against Skarmory and can switch in on resisted attacks aimed at Gengar. Offensive Calm Mind Latias appreciates Gengar potentially KOing special walls and luring in Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Lucario can set up on a choice locked Pursuit and threaten to sweep with Swords Dance or Agility.</p> <p>Magnezone is also a helpful partner, as most of Gengar's answers are Steel-types. Not only can it trap and take down Scizor, it can also utilize a set with Magnet Rise to deal with both Metagross and Jirachi. Gengar is also immune to the Fighting- and Ground-type attacks that are commonly directed at Magnezone. Other more offensive Magnezone partners such as Mamoswine, Swampert, and Dragonite are strong partners.</p> "

  "Qwilfish": {
    "overview": "<p>Qwilfish in OU is no joke. Its Attack stat may not be stellar, nor its Speed, but Rain Dance lets it overcome its mediocre Speed stat to become faster than anything commonly used in OU, and the rain helps make Waterfall a truly fearsome attack. Kabutops may have the higher Attack stat, but Qwilfish has many invaluable qualities such as the ability to absorb Toxic Spikes and explode. You may laugh at first sight, but you won't be laughing when it proceeds to rip apart your team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Qwilfish can set up Rain Dance itself, but this is better left to faster or bulkier Pokemon; Qwilfish should stick to Swords Dance. It can also utilize both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, but Forretress does this better in OU. Qwilfish can use Destiny Bond to make an opponent faint if they take out Qwilfish, but you're better off Exploding in OU. Qwilfish has access to Taunt to stop opponents from using status or setting up, but Qwilfish will find very few opportunities to use it. There's Endure/Sub and Flail, but the strong presence of Tyranitar and Hippowdon in OU, as well as priority makes this not worth it. Counter is rather gimmicky, and should only be used with a Focus Sash, but it could surprise some Pokemon. Anything else of note requires Qwilfish to take a hit or be slow (Revenge, Payback, Gyro Ball), which is definitely not acceptable. Aqua Jet could be used as it gives Qwilfish come priority, but that makes it generally outclassed by Kabutops who has a higher Attack stat. Also, Aqua Jet and Swords Dance is an illegal combination, and so this limits Qwilfish's ability to use it effectively in OU.</p> <p>Just max Attack and Speed. You could drop its Speed down to 264 to just outrun Choice Scarf Gengar in the rain, but you're better off just Speed tying with Kingdra, as the HP EVs would be insignificant.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Water-types are its number one counters. Without a boost, Swampert easily disposes of it with Earthquake, and can even survive if Qwilfish is at +2, although the odds are against it if Stealth Rock is up. Suicune and Vaporeon can take it on if they have Hidden Power Electric or if Qwilfish is weakened, as a +2 Poison Jab only musters a 2HKO. Gyarados is a great counter as it has Intimidate to weaken the attacks of Qwilfish, while being able to take it out with Earthquake, and all Qwilfish can really do is explode.</p> <p>While they are UU and so aren't too common in OU, Quagsire and Toxicroak still make great counters as they are immune to Water-type moves because of Water Absorb and Dry Skin respectively, and both resist Poison-type moves. Milotic can do well if it has Hidden Power Electric since it has the bulk to take a +2 Poison Jab. Walrein can do very well against it thanks to its high HP and good Defense, but will need Earthquake to hit back or hail needs to be active; Walrein can then slowly weaken down Qwilfish through Substitute and Protect.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Qwilfish makes a great Swords Dance sweeper in the rain; a +2 STAB Waterfall boosted by the rain leaves a massive dent even in Skarmory, doing 76.3% - 90.1% to maximum HP and Defense variants, meaning it can sometimes OHKO with Stealth Rock support. Poison Jab pairs well with Waterfall, hitting most Pokemon who resist Waterfall. It always OHKOes even the most defensive of Celebi at +2, who can otherwise be a pain for Rain Dance teams. Explosion finishes off the set by allowing Qwilfish to go out with a bang and do some major damage.</p> <p>While many would opt to use Kabutops for the higher Attack stat and a STAB Stone Edge, Qwilfish does have some advantages over the prehistoric arthropod. Possibly its biggest advantage over Kabutops is that it can absorb the Toxic Spikes which cripple most Rain Dance teams. It also has a much easier time against Celebi since Kabutops has to use X-Scissor if it wants to OHKO Celebi at +2, meaning it will lose Aqua Jet and have a harder time against Scizor; on the other hand, Poison Jab is a staple move for Qwilfish. Lastly, Qwilfish has access to Explosion, which OHKOs every non Ghost-type in OU after a Swords Dance.</p> <p>Adamant is the recommended nature as it gives Qwilfish as much power as possible while still being insanely fast in the rain. Running 252 Speed EVs ensures that Qwilfish speed ties with Kingdra, who can easily sweep unprepared Rain Dance teams. There's no point dropping Speed as 264 Speed would be the minimum to outspeed Choice Scarf Gengar in the rain and those extra HP EVs aren't worth missing the Speed tie with Kingdra. Jolly can be used, although it is discouraged. It doesn't let you outrun any notable threats, but could prove useful outside of the rain, allowing Qwilfish to outspeed Adamant Lucario, Jolly Gyarados, and Jolly Mamoswine. Swift Swim is the obvious ability since it doubles Qwilfish's Speed in the rain. Life Orb is used as Qwilfish needs all the power it can get, while still retaining the freedom of switching between attacks.</p> <p>When using Qwilfish, your teammates should be one of two things: Rain Dance sweepers or Rain Dance supporters. The best Rain Dance sweeper to support Qwilfish is Ludicolo because Qwilfish has a lot of trouble getting past bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Vaporeon, whereas Ludicolo's STAB Grass-type moves can deal with them. Kingdra is a staple on any OU Rain Dance team, and partners up effectively with Qwilfish. The mixed sweeper can clear the way for a Qwilfish sweep by dealing with Gyarados, while the special sweeper will appreciate Blissey taken care of and bulky Water-types exploded on.</p> <p>The best Rain Dance supporters to Qwilfish are those who can take its weaknesses to Electric-, Ground-, and Psychic-type moves, but also those who can deal with Abomasnow, Hippowdon, and Tyranitar, whose abilities clear the rain. Swampert can switch in on Electric-type moves with impunity, and also deals with Tyranitar and Hippowdon. Scizor is another good partner as its Bullet Punch can take out both Tyranitar and Abomasnow. Electric-types, such as Jolteon, Magnezone, Rotom-W, and Zapdos are other great partners to take on the bulky Water-types which trouble Qwilfish, with a 100% accurate STAB Thunder in the rain. Jolteon, Magnezone, and Rotom-W can also take the Electric-type attacks commonly aimed at Qwilfish, while Rotom-W and Zapdos are immune to the Ground-type attacks Qwilfish hates.</p> "

  "Raikou": {
    "overview": "<p>Raikou is one of two viable mono-Electric-type Pokemon in OU, alongside Jolteon, which gives it a unique niche. Its Speed tier is incredibly desirable, getting the jump on Pokemon like Infernape, Latias, and Gengar with a Speed-boosting nature and Speed tying with Starmie; even with a neutral nature, it just barely outspeeds all base 100 Speed Pokemon like Jirachi, Flygon, Zapdos, and Shaymin. Its very good special bulk makes it a fantastic offensive answer to Pokemon like Zapdos, Gengar, and even Starmie. In particular, Raikou shrugs off all of Zapdos's attacking moves thanks to its good typing and Special Defense. Raikou also has access to Aura Sphere, which can go as far as OHKOing many variants of Tyranitar; this is something that very few special attackers can do.</p> <p>Despite its positive traits, Raikou has quite a few shortcomings that prevent it from dominating the OU landscape. If it runs Aura Sphere, it must run a Rash nature, which not only prevents it from outspeeding Infernape, Latias, and Gengar but also reduces its Special Defense considerably. Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert can completely shut down Raikou, and if it uses Hidden Power Grass to catch Swampert, it will be much worse versus other Ground-types like Flygon and Gliscor. Raikou doesn't have a reliable healing move and has subpar Defense, so it's vulnerable to physical attacks, detests status, and often sees its use limited by sand.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Raikou has a decent Substitute + Calm Mind set, which can take tremendous advantage of foes like bulky Rotom-A, Zapdos, and Jirachi. However, this set requires a tremendous amount of support to work effectively. In addition, unlike other Substitute + Calm Mind users like Jirachi and Suicune, Raikou cannot make 101 HP Substitutes, meaning that it should lose to Blissey and Clefable. A RestTalk set can be used with Thunderbolt and Roar for fast phazing while asleep and more longevity, but this set is quite passive even with the phazing, and the defensive utility is hampered by a Ground weakness and lack of natural resistances. Raikou can use a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs set, but neither of these sets is particularly great. Choice Scarf Raikou is generally outclassed by other revenge killers like Rotom-A, and it's most often preferable to take advantage of Raikou's unique coverage with a Shuca Berry or Life Orb rather than a Choice Specs set. Roar can also be used on a Calm Mind + 2 Attacks set as an aggressive phazer, but it can be difficult to justify this over moves like Protect, Aura Sphere, and even Shadow Ball. Weather Ball is an interesting choice that can be used with Hidden Power Grass to compensate for the loss in Ice-type coverage. In hail, Weather Ball gives Raikou the best of both worlds with Grass- and Ice-type coverage together, while in sand, Rock-type coverage is quite decent to still hit Dragonite and Zapdos super effectively while keeping Hidden Power Grass for Swampert. Rest is an option to try to turn the tables on Seismic Toss Blissey and Clefable and can even be used more offensively with Chesto Berry, but Raikou often cannot afford to be sleeping for two turns. Signal Beam mauls Celebi while still hitting Latias, but Shadow Ball hits Rotom-A as well and is more powerful. Charge Beam enables Raikou to boost its Special Attack, which compresses Thunderbolt and Calm Mind; however, Calm Mind is way more consistent. Magnet Rise can give Raikou an edge versus Metagross and Bronzong by granting it a temporary Earthquake immunity in addition to its resistance to Meteor Mash and Gyro Ball, which may force these Pokemon to use Explosion to take out Raikou.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Swampert and Hippowdon shrug off Raikou's attacks with ease and can fire back a devastating Earthquake to OHKO it. Swampert must be careful of a surprise Hidden Power Grass, but Hippowdon is generally quite a safe bet, especially if it is specially defensive. Choice Scarf Flygon outspeeds Raikou and maims it with Earthquake. Mamoswine is not weak to Hidden Power Ice, so it is a decent check to Calm Mind + 2 Attacks sets; however, it must be careful of Aura Sphere.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon That Resist Electric: Pokemon like Celebi, Shaymin, Abomasnow, and Rotom-A can take Raikou on decently, but sometimes prior scouting must be done to ensure the safety of Abomasnow and Rotom-A. From full, however, Celebi and Shaymin can switch in, and Hidden Power Ice is very unlikely to 2HKO them.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Blissey, Clefable, bulky Latias, and even specially defensive Heatran can all check Raikou quite well and cripple it via Thunder Wave, Knock Off, Toxic, or even a burn from Lava Plume or Will-O-Wisp. Without Aura Sphere, Tyranitar is a fantastic Raikou check with its immense special bulk and natural physical power.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers: Raikou's Defense is not stellar, so strong priority from the likes of Lucario, Dragonite, Breloom, and Infernape can be effective versus Raikou. In addition, faster physical attackers like Choice Scarf Flygon and Choice Scarf Tyranitar can often force Raikou out.</p> ",

        "name": "Calm Mind + Protect",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind boosts Raikou's already impressive Special Attack and Special Defense even higher, turning it into a potent setup sweeper. Protect is a great option to scout annoying Choice item Pokemon like Flygon, Trick Rotom-A, and Jirachi, as well as wear down foes with sand damage. In combination with status like burn and poison, Protect can be incredibly potent as a utility move to get enough chip damage for Raikou to KO a foe with Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is Raikou's go-to attacking option; Hidden Power Ice alongside it forms immaculate BoltBeam coverage that only Magnezone resists and hits Gliscor, Flygon, and Dragonite for massive damage, as well as Pokemon like Latias, Nidoqueen, Breloom, Celebi, and Shaymin for super effective damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Raikou needs to be as fast as possible to outpace Infernape, Latias, and Gengar as well as Speed tie at minimum with Starmie, and it also needs to deal as much damage as possible, so Special Attack and Speed are maximized. Leftovers is necessary to compensate for sand damage and take additional advantage of Protect, improving Raikou's subpar longevity. You have the option to reduce Raikou's Speed investment to 216 EVs in exchange for arbitrary bulk, but losing out on Speed tying with Starmie and even Azelf is usually not worth it.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If possible, try to avoid sending Raikou into Toxic Spikes, as status will severely cripple it. Keep Raikou hidden for as long as possible. Because its longevity is poor, your opponent may have a much easier time playing around Raikou if it's revealed haphazardly. Take advantage of its great typing and special bulk and use Calm Mind when Raikou is healthy. Try not to overpredict, as Thunderbolt will usually do a significant amount of damage even to Pokemon that resist it like Magnezone, Rotom-A, and Abomasnow. When there is no sand or hail, use Protect as much as possible to passively heal with Leftovers, which can enable Raikou to use Calm Mind against foes like Zapdos and Rotom-A even at lower health. Protect can also be used to scout Toxic from Zapdos, Heatran, and even Jirachi.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Despite its strengths, Raikou requires a lot of support. Weather clearers, while not mandatory, will heavily improve Raikou's longevity. Latias is Ground immune, can use Thunder Wave to cripple Jirachi and Metagross, and can set up rain with Rain Dance to support Raikou. Latias can also use moves like Surf and Grass Knot to KO Hippowdon and Swampert, which both check Raikou quite well. Uxie is another Ground-immune Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock and use Rain Dance. Wish support from the likes of Jirachi, Latias, and Clefable can serve to keep Raikou healthy over a longer game, enabling it to come in with less worry. Breloom can use its Grass- and Fighting-type moves against Swampert, Hippowdon, Blissey, Clefable, and Magnezone, as well as cripple a foe with Spore to assist Raikou in setting up Calm Mind more freely. Roserade can set up Toxic Spikes and also absorb them for Raikou, and it can also threaten Swampert, Hippowdon, and Magnezone with moves like Sleep Powder, Leaf Storm, and Hidden Power Ground. Since Raikou has issues with special walls like Blissey and Clefable, Magma Storm Heatran can lure them in, trap them, and remove them.</p> "

        "name": "Shuca Berry",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shuca Berry Raikou is able to function as a surprise soft check to Dragon Dance sweepers that use Earthquake and also has an easier time dealing with Ground-types in a one-on-one matchup. In addition, an all-out attacking set can be beneficial over a Calm Mind set because Raikou sometimes does not have a good opportunity to use Calm Mind. Thunderbolt is Raikou's most consistent Electric-type attack. Aura Sphere enables Raikou to effectively dispatch foes like Tyranitar, Magnezone, and even Heatran to some extent. Shadow Ball is recommended to hit Rotom-A and Latias super effectively. However, Calm Mind is still a solid alternative if you're not as worried about Rotom-A. Hidden Power Ice is preferred in the final slot, as it lets Raikou lure in and remove Pokemon like Flygon and Gliscor with the help of Shuca Berry. Hidden Power Grass is a decent alternative if Swampert is problematic for your team; however, losing out on OHKOing Dragonite, Flygon, and Gliscor is hard to justify.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Rash nature is mandatory with Aura Sphere, unfortunately, so Raikou will have slightly lower Special Defense than desired. That said, its special bulk is still decent enough to check Zapdos and even Gengar relatively well. Shuca Berry enables Raikou to act as a soft check to some Dragon Dance sweepers, such as Gyarados and Dragonite. It is especially important to maximize Speed, as with 329 Speed, Raikou can outspeed all base 100 Speed Pokemon like Jirachi and Flygon. In addition, not all Starmie will reach 361 Speed, like Bold Starmie in particular, so Raikou can use Speed investment to get the jump on those bulkier Starmie variants.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Unless you determine that Raikou is extremely effective at breaking your opponent's team, try to conceal it and keep it healthy for as long as possible so it can soft check setup sweepers as effectively as possible. It may be difficult to switch Raikou in safely, so it's usually best to sacrifice something in order to send Raikou in and maintain momentum or lure a foe in. That said, Raikou can switch into the likes of Zapdos, Choice Scarf Rotom-A locked into Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Ice, and Skarmory. While Shuca Berry can ensure that Raikou survives a powerful Ground-type attack, it will still take significantly more damage than other Shuca Berry holders like Jirachi and Tyranitar. This means that Raikou is not as secure of a check for Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite comparatively. Don't depend on Raikou too much in the teambuilder to check these Pokemon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Shuca Berry Raikou functions rather independently for the most part, but it can especially benefit from Spikes and Rapid Spin support. A lead Skarmory or Froslass can set up entry hazards early and help Raikou maintain momentum with its coverage and speed to maximize its effectiveness. Starmie can help to combat foes like Infernape and Gengar and provide essential Rapid Spin support to support Raikou in staying healthy to increase its capabilities as a Shuca Berry holder. Other means of preventing entry hazards from going up also pair well with Raikou, like Taunt Azelf and Aerodactyl. A mixed Jirachi with Iron Head can combine well with Raikou to both wallbreak and potentially prevent hazards from going up with its Iron Head and additional type coverage.</p> "

        "name": "Attacking Lead",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Raikou can function as a unique attacking lead due to its natural bulk that enables it to often survive one attack as well as high power, great coverage, priority, and, most importantly, STAB-boosted Thunderbolt. Aura Sphere is a desirable move for an Electric-type special attacker, as Tyranitar is not a secure check like it is versus other Electric-types like Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Jolteon. Hidden Power Ice combines with Thunderbolt and Aura Sphere to give Raikou perfect coverage. It also hits Dragonite, Flygon, and Gliscor for devastating damage, as well as Grass-types and Latias super effectively. Extreme Speed rounds out the set with priority to finish off opposing leads like Azelf, Empoleon, and even Aerodactyl. Hidden Power Grass can be used as an alternative to deal massive damage to Swampert; however, Hidden Power Ice is quite crucial for its better coverage overall, especially versus Latias and Gliscor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Raikou is required to use a Rash nature due to Aura Sphere, but on this set it's not as consequential. The reduced Special Defense is rarely impactful, as Raikou usually only takes one hit in the lead position and doesn't have as much longevity to take advantage of extra Special Defense. In addition, the bonus in Special Attack is essential to deal as much damage as possible to foes like Jirachi, Tyranitar, Heatran, and Clefable, as well as more securely guaranteeing a 2HKO on Focus Sash Machamp with Thunderbolt. Lum Berry is the recommended item to more reliably take on Machamp and Roserade; however, Life Orb is an alternative option to have better odds versus lead Azelf and go all in on dealing as much damage as possible and wreaking havoc early on. A Life Orb strategy is a bit more risky, as the lead matchup versus Machamp and Roserade becomes worse, and Lum Berry is often very convenient in its own right for attacks like Jirachi's Body Slam and Clefable's Thunder Wave. Shuca Berry is a strong alternative item as well to surprise lead Choice Scarf Flygon and for its overall utility.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Lead Raikou is simple to use, as Thunderbolt is very powerful and hits most non-Ground-types for significant damage. Playing aggressively with predictions can be very rewarding, like using Thunderbolt on a Ground-type pivot that's weak to Hidden Power Ice as it switches out, dealing significant damage to the switch-in with Thunderbolt. This is further supported by Raikou's ability to pressure common Stealth Rock leads like Jirachi, Empoleon, and Metagross, often forcing them to choose between attacking Raikou and setting up Stealth Rock. Due to Raikou's diverse toolkit, many leads that it may match up badly against, like Swampert and even Flygon, may try to scout for Hidden Power Grass and Shuca Berry. In these cases, if you wish to switch out, it's important to find a solid midground against these Pokemon. Even if Raikou takes an attack and is at low health, it is often worth preserving it for death fodder later. Furthermore, if you're lucky, Raikou can come in again and fire off one or two powerful attacks before going down, hopefully doing enough damage to make it a worthwhile attacking lead.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Lead Raikou functions quite independently in a more hyper offensive manner. That said, some Pokemon combine well with it to compensate for its bad matchups. Skarmory is a fantastic partner because it can switch into all of the leads that Raikou loses against, like Metagross, Swampert, and Hippowdon. Starmie appreciates Raikou's strength against bulky Water-types like Milotic and Suicune and can wear down Ground-types and Metagross for it. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Gyarados and Swords Dance Lucario appreciate Raikou's ability to chip Pokemon like Jirachi and Rotom-A. Gyarados can take advantage of Choice Scarf Flygon's Earthquake, which is often used to take out Raikou. Lucario's powerful Extreme Speed is great for finishing off weakened foes from Raikou's attacks. If you're using a Raikou + Skarmory hyper offensive Spikes-stacking team, Gengar, Rotom-A, and Tyranitar pair nicely for entry hazard control.</p> "

  "Suicune": {
    "overview": "<p>Suicune has established itself as a DPP staple due to its prowess as a bulky sweeper. Its Water typing, awesome defensive stats, decent Speed tier, and access to Calm Mind allow it to be an enormous offensive threat while checking Heatran, Infernape, Swampert, Gyarados, Kingdra, Bronzong, and Metagross—threats that Suicune teams typically struggle to handle. It can also take advantage of defensive teams’ lack of strong counterplay to Water-types; +1 offensive Suicune almost 2HKOes Clefable and Jirachi with Hydro Pump and 2HKOes everything else commonly used on these teams, opening up the way for other Water-types. In addition, it also is one of the more difficult threats for hyper and bulky offenses to beat. Suicune also has the bulk to act as an emergency answer to setup sweepers such as Gyarados and Dragonite.</p> <p>Suicune is also a good sweeper on defensive teams, with its Pressure ability and high defenses allowing it to use Calm Mind multiple times and eventually sweep through defensive teams that can’t punish it while asleep or behind a 101 HP Substitute. Suicune is one of the better Substitute users in the game; it loves blocking status, Knock Off, Trick, and Explosion and can also drain PP effectively with Pressure, especially against Seismic Toss. In a last Pokemon situation, Suicune has strong comeback potential, as it can no longer be phazed. Additionally, while Suicune has quite a limited movepool, it can effectively use options such as Protect to further drain PP with Pressure, Toxic to punish walls such as Milotic, and even Roar to win Calm Mind wars against Latias, Jirachi, and other Suicune.</p> <p>However, Suicune is vulnerable to all entry hazards—sets without Rest struggle mightily against Toxic Spikes, and even with Rest, Suicune can get chipped easily if it is forced in by phazing repeatedly with Stealth Rock and Spikes set. Suicune also has little protection against Trick, struggles against status, and is threatened by powerful Electric- and Grass-type attacks from the likes of Zapdos, Rotom-A, Celebi, and Roserade. Suicune’s offensive Calm Mind sets often get chipped quite easily, whereas the defensive sets can struggle with coverage issues against Pokemon like Breloom, Latias, Dragonite, and Milotic. Suicune’s Substitute sets also are crippled by sand, as they can no longer repeatedly use Substitute against the likes of Clefable, Blissey, and defensive Jirachi without Leftovers recovery. Finally, Suicune can be easily crippled by special walls such as Clefable using Knock Off or Encore and Blissey using Thunder Wave.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Suicune has a somewhat shallow movepool but is effective enough to make niche options viable. Roar on the offensive Calm Mind set lets it set up alongside Latias, Jirachi, and other Suicune and phaze them. This is particularly notable because Calm Mind + Roar Latias is typically slower than an invested Suicune. Suicune can also use Roar to make up for the lack of Hidden Power Electric against boosted Gyarados, which is unlikely to use Taunt out of fear of Hidden Power Electric. Toxic on the offensive Calm Mind set  cripples Milotic and Swampert. Suicune has usable non-Calm Mind sets, such as running Roar over Calm Mind on the RestTalk set. However, these are extremely passive and struggle against anything that resists Water. Suicune can use other Hidden Power types, with Grass nailing Swampert and Quagsire while still hitting Water-types other than Gyarados, and Fire surprising Abomasnow. However, these are quite niche. Substitute Suicune can change the weather itself with Rain Dance over Protect or Ice Beam. However, this strategy still struggles against Encore Clefable while not giving additional help against Latias and Breloom. Suicune can use Tailwind, Reflect, or even Mirror Coat to beat specific matchups but all are niche at best.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>There are very few Pokemon that can check all of Suicune’s sets. Grass-types that are fantastic answers to CroCune mostly lose to +1 offensive Suicune’s Ice Beam. Strong special walls can easily lose to Substitute + Protect Suicune and CroCune. As such, Suicune is often checked with multiple Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Abomasnow, Roserade, Celebi, Breloom, and Shaymin are great initial switch-ins into Suicune. Abomasnow is perhaps the best counter in the game, as it sets up hail and easily eliminates all Suicune sets with its Wood Hammer or annoys them with Leech Seed. However, all of the others need to be careful: bulkless Roserade is OHKOed by Ice Beam after Stealth Rock and its Leaf Storm can’t always OHKO back without a boosting item or Modest nature, Celebi needs a lot of Speed and a boosted Leaf Storm to KO back, Breloom cannot take boosted Ice Beam at all, and Shaymin needs to be careful of running out of Seed Flare PP.</p> <p><strong>Sand Stream: While Tyranitar and Hippowdon handily lose to Suicune, their summoned sand negating Leftovers recovery makes it much harder to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Clefable and Blissey are great initial switch-ins to Suicune. Clefable has Encore and Knock Off to cripple Suicune, and Blissey completely walls offensive Suicune. However, Clefable is almost 2HKOed by +1 Suicune and Blissey completely loses to CroCune and Substitute Suicune unless sand is up—both will eventually run out of Seismic Toss PP against CroCune and Substitute Suicune as long as Suicune still has its Leftovers recovery.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Electric-types: Zapdos, Rotom-A, Raikou, and even Jolteon can offensively check Suicune. Modest Choice Specs Zapdos notably OHKOes +1 offensive Suicune with Thunderbolt after Stealth Rock in sand. However, they all struggle to take boosted hits from offensive Suicune and can eventually run out of PP against the Substitute + Protect set.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types:  Even though Latias, Dragonite, and Kingdra generally lose against Suicune's boosted Ice Beam, they completely stop sets that rely solely on Surf. Latias also can paralyze offensive sets, remove less bulky sets with super effective coverage, or phaze, while Dragonite and Kingdra hit Suicune hard with their Dragon-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Water-types:  Water-types such as Empoleon, Starmie, and Gyarados can check Suicune if it lacks Hidden Power Electric. Vaporeon and Quagsire are completely immune to Suicune's Water-type moves and can cripple it with Toxic, Encore, or Roar. Milotic has access to Haze, although Suicune can PP stall it due to Pressure.</p> <p><strong>Status: Suicune despises Toxic Spikes. In addition, poison and burn seriously cut into its longevity and force CroCune to use Rest earlier. Latias is a great way to force paralysis onto Suicune, as it typically outspeeds and has great defenses. If Suicune is paralyzed, Pokemon like Breloom, defensive Roserade, and Celebi become better checks, as they can use STAB moves without fearing boosted Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Phazing with Entry Hazards</strong>: As Suicune mostly doesn’t run Roar, forcing it to lose boosts via Roar, Whirlwind, or even Encore is a great way to wear it down. Making Suicune come in on Spikes and Stealth Rock while asleep and then forcing it out again is a common way for defensive teams to defeat it. Skarmory, Latias, Clefable with Encore, and defensive Zapdos phaze it well.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: A common way to neuter Suicune is to chip it and revenge kill it with a Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Tyranitar, whose Stone Edge does 43.4 - 51.3%, Latias, whose Draco Meteor does 35.1 - 41.6% to +1 Suicune, or Flygon, whose Jolly Outrage does 42.5 - 50.4%. Entry hazards often weaken Suicune to the point where it can be revenge killed.</p> <p><strong>Trick: Giving Suicune a Choice item via Rotom-A, Latias, or Jirachi especially cripples CroCune and Substitute sets. However, one must be careful of a boosted offensive Suicune sweeping a weakened team with +1 Hydro Pump regardless.</p> ",

        "name": "Supercune (Offensive Calm Mind)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Offensive Calm Mind Suicune is one of the most dangerous Calm Mind users in the metagame, taking advantage of its bulk to set up on Pokemon such as Heatran and Gliscor.</p> <p>Hydro Pump is threatening even with no boosts, OHKOing bulkless Heatran after Stealth Rock. It additionally OHKOes Lucario with a Special Defense drop, 2HKOes most Metagross, and 2HKOes most Tyranitar without a Passho Berry. Ice Beam gives Suicune coverage against many Grass- and Dragon-types that threaten it, including Breloom, Latias, Roserade, and Dragonite, while also giving a super effective option against Zapdos. Finally, Hidden Power Electric threatens other Water-types, notably OHKOing bulkless Gyarados 75% of the time after Stealth Rock, combating opposing Suicune and eventually beating Haze Milotic through PP stalling. After using Calm Mind, Suicune becomes even more threatening and able to seriously damage most of its answers. Frail offensive checks such as bulkless Rotom-A and most Breloom can no longer take Hydro Pump and Ice Beam. Common answers to Water-types such as Kingdra and Empoleon can be 2HKOed by Ice Beam and Hidden Power Electric. Additionally, do not underestimate Suicune’s ability to tank hits at +1—only Modest Choice Specs Zapdos can guarantee an OHKO on +1 Suicune after Stealth Rock. This allows Suicune to, in an emergency, take a strong hit, such as Roserade’s Leaf Storm, Celebi’s Leaf Storm, or Choice Specs Latias’s Draco Meteor, and come out on top. Another option over Hidden Power Electric is Protect, as a common answer to Suicune is an Explosion from Passho Berry Heatran, Bronzong, or Metagross. In addition, Protect drains foes' PP, gives additional Leftovers recovery, and scouts moves such as Trick and Encore.  However, missing coverage on Water-types like Gyarados, Milotic, Empoleon, and Starmie is a big loss.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Suicune should be running a Timid nature most of the time. Suicune sits at a very valuable Speed tier, and typically needs to invest fully or nearly fully in Speed to outspeed Heatran, Adamant Lucario, and Mamoswine. Additionally, Timid Suicune’s Speed outpaces defensive variants of Jirachi, Celebi, Roserade, Zapdos and Latias. However, as a lesser option, Modest allows Suicune some notable power benchmarks, such as a chance to 2HKO Clefable and specially defensive Jirachi after Stealth Rock at +1. Suicune can also sacrifice Speed and Special Attack to run more bulk, as, without Stealth Rock, it is normally very close to getting OHKOed by +1 Dragonite's Outrage and 2HKOed by +1 Gyarados. An example spread is 48 HP / 52 Def / 180 SpA / 228 Spe with a Modest nature, which maximizes Leftovers recovery, survives +1 non Life Orb Dragonite after Stealth Rock and one round of Leftovers, and outspeeds Jolly Breloom, Adamant Gyarados, and Adamant Dragonite.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>While offensive Calm Mind Suicune can sweep, it typically plays as an offensive team’s primary switch-in to Heatran, answers Gyarados and Dragonite in emergencies, trades with threats such as Metagross, Swampert, and Infernape, and sets up early-game before sand is up to weaken answers to Water-types such as Latias and Roserade. Suicune should be ready to use Calm Mind immediately if the opposing Pokemon can’t threaten it effectively, as even its checks can struggle against it if boosted. Suicune really appreciates teammates weakening or eliminating Water switch-ins, offensive Electric-types, and special walls such as Roserade, Shaymin, Zapdos, and Clefable. Suicune also enjoys a field clear of sand to use its natural bulk and power at +1 to push past its checks. Try to avoid getting Suicune statused, as it becomes much worse against Breloom and defensive Roserade if paralyzed, for example. Trick from Rotom-A or Latias can cripple Suicune; however, if Hydro Pump answers are gone, Suicune can sweep at +1 despite being Choice locked. If Suicune has Protect, aggressively predicting Explosion, such as right after switches it in on non-Leftovers Heatran, can often pay dividends against opponents desperate to remove it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Suicune really shines on bulky offensive Fire / Water / Grass cores, where it complements Pokemon like Heatran and Roserade. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock and generally threatens the Grass-types that scare out Suicune, such as Roserade and Celebi. Bulkier Heatran sets also assist against defensive Jirachi, which can tank boosted Suicune hits and paralyze it with Body Slam. Roserade especially assists Suicune by removing Toxic Spikes, a giant thorn in its side. Roserade can also set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which helps wear down Celebi, Milotic, Blissey, and even Vaporeon. Suicune also appreciate a strong offensive Water-type alongside it, such as Empoleon, Kingdra, Choice Specs Starmie, or Swampert, so both can synergistically weaken Water-type checks. Teammates like Gengar and the aforementioned Heatran can cripple or remove defensive checks such as Clefable, Blissey, and Latias with Explosion, while Heatran can further lure Water-types such as Starmie and Milotic with a Passho Berry + Explosion set. Trick users like Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Choice item Latias are another way to hinder special walls. Breloom is a great Suicune partner, as it absorbs status and Knock Off once its Toxic Orb has activated and counters special walls. Suicune appreciates a Ground-type or Tyranitar—but remember that sand weakens it—to absorb strong Electric-type attacks from the likes of Zapdos and Rotom-A. Effective Ground-types include Swampert, Nidoqueen to set up and absorb Toxic Spikes, Gliscor, and Choice Scarf Flygon. Suicune also appreciates Magnezone support, as bulky Steel-types such as Jirachi, Metagross, Bronzong, and Skarmory can cripple Suicune with status, tank a hit and use Explosion on it or phaze it.</p> <p>Offensive Suicune can fit on a variety of other archetypes too. Hyper offense teams, such as those built around dual screens provided by Uxie, Azelf, or Cresselia, enjoy its strong power at +1 as well as its ability to plug many defensive holes these teams typically have. Other Pokemon that can fit on these aggressive teams are Dragon Dance Tyranitar to help break through shared checks like Milotic, Dragon Dance Gyarados to form a strong Water-type offensive core, Life Orb Swords Dance Scizor to eliminate Skarmory, and Dragon Dance Dragonite. Suicune can also fit on rain teams alongside other Water-types such as Empoleon, and generally it works well on offensive teams that want some added security against Dragon Dance users and Heatran.</p> "

        "name": "CroCune (Defensive Calm Mind + RestTalk)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>CroCune is a strong late-game sweeper for defensive teams that also serves as a great switch-in to common threats to those teams such as Heatran, physical Jirachi, Metagross, and Swampert.</p> <p>A defensive Calm Mind set allows Suicune to set up many boosts in the face of Pokemon that can’t really threaten it, such as Swampert, Heatran, physical Jirachi, Metagross, and most Tyranitar. Calm Mind also makes Suicune amazing in a last Pokemon situation, as it can set up without being phazed. Surf is the only viable attack, as this Suicune really needs the additional PP to handle Clefable, defensive Jirachi, Blissey, and Milotic. Despite lacking investment, Suicune’s Surf can still dent what it needs to, OHKOing Infernape after Stealth Rock, 2HKOing Heatran, and 3HKOing most Tyranitar. At +6, the only common threats Suicune can’t break through are defensive Celebi, Latias, and Milotic, though Breloom and Dragonite are especially difficult to handle if Suicune hasn't gotten enough boosts to KO them. RestTalk is Suicune's only form of recovery and status removal, but its status removal means Suicune isn't immediately crippled by Toxic Spikes, can set up on status inducing defensive answers such as Body Slam Jirachi, and isn't as affected by sand as other sets are.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Suicune should always be running at least 401 HP for Seismic Toss from Clefable or Blissey in case sand is up or Suicune takes Knock Off from Clefable important if sand is up. A Bold nature helps it survive its sleeping turns and be a blanket check to physical threats such as Metagross, Swampert, Infernape, and Trick Room Bronzong. However, Suicune can run more Speed, such as 16 EVs to outspeed Machamp and minimum Speed Rotom-A and 64 EVs to outspeed Swampert and neutral nature Tyranitar. Additionally, it is possible to put all or some of the physical bulk into Special Attack and run a Modest nature.  A spread of 252 HP / 240 SpA / 16 Spe lets Suicune significantly threaten defensive teams with a much stronger Surf against Scizor, Bronzong, Metagross, Clefable, and Jirachi.  However, without a Bold nature, Suicune is more vulnerable to Explosion and takes more damage from physical Pokemon it is meant to help wall, especially if sand or entry hazards are set. This also makes it harder to get past bad Sleep Talk turns.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Suicune commonly plays as a more offensive version of Milotic, using its resistances and Pressure to shore defensive teams against strong threats, like Choice Band Gyarados, Swampert, Heatran, and Dynamic Punch Machamp. However, Suicune is very vulnerable while using Rest, so one should not be careless with its health—it should not be the only switch-in to these Pokemon. Suicune shouldn’t attempt a sweep while threats such as Breloom, Milotic, and Roar Latias are still active, as they will instantly stall any momentum it has. As Suicune is vulnerable to sand and really wants its Leftovers, it should avoid Clefable's and Gliscor’s Knock Off. If many entry hazards are set, Suicune will have trouble getting out of spamming Rest, so opposing Spikes stacking teams mandate picking the correct time to wall a threat or set up is. Take advantage of this Suicune’s ability to shrug off status against Pokemon like defensive Jirachi to get multiple boosts.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Defensive Calm Mind Suicune is commonly used as a late-game sweeper on defensive teams and really appreciates teammates that can mitigate its flaws: reliance on one attack, relative passivity, and vulnerability to Trick and Explosion. Suicune needs solid answers to Breloom as well as Haze Milotic and defensive Celebi. Examples of these teammates include Gliscor, Zapdos, and Latias. RestTalk Suicune can even absorb Breloom’s Spore, allowing Gliscor and Zapdos to beat it more comfortably. Latias can also use Healing Wish on Suicune in dire situations. Good Pokemon to punish Milotic and Celebi, such as Skarmory, are also appreciated. Strong special walls like Clefable and Blissey can help with Suicune’s vulnerability to Rotom-A, Roserade, and Zapdos, while Choice Scarf Tyranitar can Pursuit trap any Rotom-A or Latias trying to use Trick. Since this Suicune is so passive before boosting, Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Choice Scarf Flygon can revenge kill Gyarados and Dragonite trying to set up on it. Rotom-A can also run more defensive sets such as RestTalk to absorb Explosion and handle some of Suicune's defensive responsibility. Suicune struggles with entry hazards and appreciates Rapid Spin support. Forretress is a common choice on defensive teams, especially as Starmie and Tentacruel don’t fit well alongside this Suicune, and it provides Spikes support to wear down Suicune answers. In the event spinning is difficult, Suicune also enjoys a grounded Poison-type teammate to absorb Toxic Spikes. Roserade and Nidoqueen are solid choices that can set their own Toxic Spikes. They help with threats such as Milotic and Water Absorb Pokemon such as Quagsire and Vaporeon. While this Suicune is not as weak to sand as other Suicune sets, removing sand with choices like Rain Dance Bronzong, Cresselia, Uxie, and Latias, or Sunny Day Breloom and even Flygon, is effective.</p> <p>Calm Mind RestTalk Suicune also fits well with lures or trappers to remove its answers. For Skarmory, the gold standard is Magnezone, but other options like Trick Iron Ball Metagross and unexpected Fire- or Electric-type coverage on a Pokemon such as Tyranitar work well too. For Breloom, Dragon Dance Chople Berry Tyranitar fits well with its boosted Ice Punch. Additionally, options that absorb Breloom's Spore such as Choice Specs Sleep Talk Latias and Lum Berry Jirachi, as well as Lum Berry Metagross with Psychic-type coverage, are also effective. Other Tyranitar and Jirachi, such as those with Thunder Wave and Body Slam, respectively, also work well for helping check defensive Latias with Roar. Passho Berry Magma Storm Heatran can lure in Milotic and Clefable and offensively check Roserade, Celebi, and Rotom-A.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "SubCune",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute Suicune is strong setup sweeper that uses Pressure, Protect, and 101 HP Substitutes to quickly drain PP from moves like Seismic Toss and Thunderbolt. Notably, teams often use low PP moves to counter Suicune, such as Clefable’s Encore, Roserade’s Leaf Storm, and Latias’s Draco Meteor. Substitute also protects Suicune from common ways to neutralize it such as status, Trick, Knock Off, critical hits, and Explosion while scouting opposing moves.</p> <p>In addition to making Suicune such a threat, Calm Mind makes its Substitute very difficult to break by special moves, such as Timid Heatran's Earth Power. RestTalk Rotom-A’s Thunderbolt cannot break +3 Suicune's Substitute, and non-Life Orb Gengar's Shadow Ball cannot break +1 Suicune. Surf is the standard due to its much greater PP, as Substitute and Protect allow Suicune to accrue many boosts. However, Hydro Pump can be used on more offensive variants, particularly those that forgo Protect for Ice Beam or invest more in Special Attack instead of Speed. Protect makes further use of Suicune’s Pressure, but Ice Beam is very nice to prevent Roar Latias and Breloom from defeating Suicune and more quickly damage Ice-weak threats in general like Zapdos, Dragonite, and Roserade.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Suicune needs maximum HP for its 101 HP Substitute. Beyond this, there are many to EV this Suicune. The standard spread gives its Surf some power in case it can't set up very much. The remaining Speed lets Suicune outspeed all non Choice Scarf Tyranitar and also set up on defensive Body Slam Jirachi without getting paralyzed. Some additional Speed EVs can be used to outrun Jirachi built for a similar benchmark. 196 Speed and a Timid nature outpaces Adamant Lucario and can potentially prevent Thunder Wave from defensive Latias or Explosion from Heatran. Other Speed investments include 16 EVs to outspeed RestTalk Rotom and Machamp, 64 EVs to outspeed neutral Tyranitar, and 228 EVs to outspeed Jolly Breloom and Adamant Gyarados. The remainder can be put into Special Attack.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Since this Suicune is much more of a dedicated sweeper than the other sets, it needs to be played carefully so that it doesn’t lose too much HP. How it plays depends on whether or not it has Protect. With Protect, try not to reveal Suicune until the opposing team is scouted for anything that could beat it. Suicune’s Protect + Substitute antics allow it to PP stall answers to it, but it absolutely must avoid status. With Ice Beam, preserving its health isn't quite as important, as typically it won't try to get higher than +1. For both variants, try to avoid setting up in sand or hail and eliminate Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Abomasnow to make the most of Leftovers recovery. If Clefable directly switches into Suicune, try to use Protect to PP stall Encore.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Suicune set needs quite a bit of support. Above all else, this Suicune loves a grounded Poison-type that can absorb and set up Toxic Spikes. Nidoqueen and Roserade are conventional options that cover defensive holes, while Qwilfish can take advantage of its offensive presence to set up entry hazards or use Explosion on walls. Another valuable piece of support is changing the weather, as Suicune is much more effective with Leftovers actively healing it. This can be done on a dedicated rain team with Pokemon like Rain Dance Azelf, Uxie, Bronzong, Scizor, Latias, and Rotom-W, or with Sunny Day Flygon or Breloom. Suicune enjoys lures and trappers to remove solid answers such as Roar Latias, Whirlwind Skarmory, and Encore Clefable. Pokemon working well here include Trick Iron Ball Metagross for Skarmory, Rotom-A, and Zapdos, Magma Storm + Explosion Heatran for special walls, Gengar, Choice Specs Latias for Breloom, and Magnezone. Strong wallbreakers such as Choice Band Swampert, Life Orb Mixed Flygon, and Breloom work well too.</p> <p>This Suicune generally needs to be close to full HP and have the opposing team scouted for answers before it can sweep. As such, it greatly appreciates Wish and Healing Wish support from the likes of Latias, Jirachi, and Clefable after getting forced out. Additionally, since this Suicune cannot play a defensive role, good switch-ins to Fire- and Water-type coverage such as Latias, Roserade, and Heatran are appreciated. A strong revenge killer such as Choice Scarf Flygon or Choice Scarf Rotom-A can handle Water-resistant sweepers like Gyarados and Dragonite. As mentioned above, Suicune is best alongside general rain sweepers such as Qwilfish and Kingdra, as these Pokemon force in Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Abomasnow and hit them very hard. In addition, Qwilfish provides Toxic Spikes removal and Kingdra hammers shared soft answers to Water-types such as scoring a 2HKO on offensive Gyarados with Hydro Pump. Suicune also fits as a strong cleaner alongside Roserade and Heatran in a Fire / Water / Grass core to bait in and remove counters as well as take advantage of Roserade's entry hazards.</p> "

  "Flygon": {
    "overview": "<p>Flygon is an excellent Pokemon, being one of a meager handful of the dreaded Dragon-types left in OU. Its resistance to Stealth Rock is a major boon in comparison to Dragonite, which takes 25% damage upon switching in. On top of that, Flygon has a plethora of resistances and immunities of which it can take advantage. U-turn is an awesome attack to have on Choice item sets since it makes predicting switches a lot easier. A mixed-attacking set can also be quite devastating with its powerful STAB Dragon- and Ground-type attacks, and it has some other tricks up its sleeve. Overall, Flygon's unique typing, ability, all around solid stats, and its useful movepool make it a great teammate on many different types of builds.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Flygon's typing and ability make it an excellent Substitute + Roost attacker with Earthquake and Dragon Claw while holding Leftovers or Soft Sand alongside Magnezone. In the same vein, a bulkier set with Toxic + Roost set has potential, but it's difficult to make room for both of these moves. Screech can be used alongside entry hazards to force many switches and pressure its foes. Fire Blast can be used on the Choice Scarf set to more immediately pressure Skarmory, but it's often unreliable and it's actually possible for Skarmory to outstall the move. Quick Attack is an interesting choice on the Choice Band set to give Flygon a somewhat decent priority move, granting it revenge killing capabilities. A Sunny Day or Power Herb + Solar Beam set could bait in and remove Swampert, but it's extremely gimmicky, and other Pokemon are better at baiting Swampert.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon: Ground-immune Pokemon can take advantage of Choice-locked Earthquake from Flygon and put their opponent in a bad position. Bulkier ones like Zapdos, Gliscor, and even Gyarados with its Intimidate can switch in a bit more safely. While most Steel-types fear Earthquake, Skarmory and Bronzong can counter Choice Scarf Flygon quite well, as they resist Dragon-type attacks and are immune to Earthquake; however, they must be careful of a potential mixed set with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon: Suicune and Milotic can check all Flygon sets aside from Choice Band provided that they are healthy. Hippowdon and Swampert are bulky enough to take most hits from Flygon as well. Clefable ignores Spikes and can stave off the mixed set with investment. Although it's niche, Porygon2 can trace Flygon's levitate, and has enough natural bulk to function as a check; it also regularly packs Ice Beam to OHKO Flygon. All of these Pokemon besides Clefable need to beware of Toxic, though.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types can function as a check to Flygon on a predicted Outrage. Jirachi can use Body Slam or Ice Punch, Heatran can use Hidden Power Ice, and Lucario can use Close Combat to answer Flygon. Scizor isn't weak to Earthquake and can come in on Outrage without taking too much damage, but needs to watch out for a Fire-type attack. All of these need to beware of the mixed set, however.</p> <p><strong>Priority users: Bullet Punch Scizor and Extreme Speed Lucario can deal large amounts of damage with their powerful priority moves. +1 Life Orb Dragon Dance Dragonite can KO Flygon with a bit of residual damage. Abomasnow, Mamoswine, and Weavile can deal massive damage with their 4x super effective Ice Shard.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Flygon's resistances and immunities give it plenty of opportunities to switch in and revenge kill a large portion of the metagame. Earthquake and Outrage are Flygon's primary STAB options, resisted only by Levitate Bronzong and Skarmory in OU. Thunder Punch is Flygon's most consistent tool for revenge killing Gyarados, but Dragon Claw is a solid move that enable Flygon to take advantage of its Dragon-type STAB and not commit to Outrage, which can catch many opponents off guard. Toxic is an interesting alternative that can cripple Zapdos, Gliscor, or Dragon Dance sweepers by surprise, which can prove to be very useful. Although not listed, Stone Edge can be used to potentially revenge kill Gyarados and it can also pick off a weakened Zapdos. U-turn is to scout for common counters and works well with entry hazards in play as Flygon can force a lot of switches and gain momentum.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Jolly nature should be used to outspeed Tyranitar at +2 Speed or, at minimum, Speed tie with Choice Scarf Jirachi. If you feel that Jirachi and Tyranitar are controlled without the assistance of Flygon, use Adamant for more power. 88 EVs can be taken out of Attack and invested into Defense to always survive a +2 Adamant Lucario's Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock damage, but the sacrifice in power is usually not worth it.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The idea of using Choice Scarf Flygon is simple. While its goal is being a revenge killer, Flygon makes an excellent secondary scout. With U-turn, Flygon can help ease the prediction when switching and, to add, could reveal another Pokemon on the opponent's side. It is best to use U-turn often when Flygon is sent out. Outrage is used as your trump card, so make sure that Flygon is not spamming this move often. If it's locked into Outrage, beware of Steel-type revenge killers like Jirachi, Metagross, Bronzong, and even Heatran that could possibly switch in after Flygon KOes a Pokemon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since this set's goal is to revenge kill Pokemon, Flygon wants support in the form of chip damage. Besides that, Flygon appreciates bulkier Pokemon first being eliminated from the field, as this set lacks the power to muscle through them. Tyranitar pairs well with Flygon, as it boasts the ability of taking down Clefable, Skarmory, Rotom, Cresselia, and other bulky Pokemon with its large range of attacks. If you're seeking a Pokemon who can keep Dragon-type attacks as well as Ice-type attacks at bay, the best solution is to use a Steel-type of your own. Magnezone support is also welcome as Steel-types counter Flygon locked into Outrage. Heatran helps Flygon take on Pokemon such as Skarmory, Scizor, and Bronzong. Heatran's nifty resistances to Bullet Punch and Extreme Speed also help Flygon revenge kill more easily as well. Furthermore, STAB Fire Blast will dent Dragonite and Gyarados switch-ins, especially if Stealth Rock is on the field.</p> <p>Scizor can pair well with Flygon due to U-turn being common on both their movesets, greatly easing prediction and gaining momentum. Scizor also makes a great Pokemon to revenge kill Dragonite, especially one locked into Outrage. If you elect to use Scizor and Flygon, wallbreakers such as Infernape, Breloom, or Lucario are recommended. U-turns from Flygon or Scizor makes it easier to switch the wallbreakers in. Despite its use as a revenge killer, Flygon appreciates support such as Stealth Rock. Any form of indirect damage (Spikes, sandstorm, or Toxic Spikes) also makes Flygon's job easier. Skarmory doesn't mind being paired with Flygon as its weaknesses can be easily absorbed by Flygon.</p> "

        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This Flygon set defeats foes with brute force and also works as a lure. It is easy to fool many opponents into thinking that this Flygon is the popular Choice Scarf set, which means that the opponent will be inclined to switch in Pokemon such as Gliscor, Skarmory, and Dragonite on an expected Earthquake, and they will all be heavily damaged by Draco Meteor or Fire Blast. Fire Blast is used for Skarmory, Scizor, and Bronzong, while Earthquake deals with other Steel-types and can effectively pressure Clefable. The fourth moveslot depends on your needs. Roost is invaluable to stave off residual damage and effectively answer Heatran. However, sometimes Flygon can be walled by very bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Clefable, and Milotic. Outrage provides the extra push need to break through, as little can withstand both physical and special Dragon-type moves as well as Fire Blast and Earthquake. Flygon is often easily revenge killed after Outrage, however.</p> <p>Flygon has many other options over Roost in the last slot; however, Flygon sorely misses recovery, especially against stall teams. These options should generally be run with an Expert Belt rather than Life Orb. U-turn is useful to scout switch-ins and deal more damage on offensive teams, but has little utility against stall. Toxic is a great option that can cripple Flygon's counters, like Hippowdon, Gliscor, Zapdos, and Suicune. Hidden Power Ice can eliminate opposing Flygon and especially specially defensive Gliscor, a common check for Flygon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Flygon wants as much Speed as possible to Speed tie with maximum Speed Jirachi, Zapdos, and other Flygon at minimum. It also needs as much Special Attack investment as possible, as its base 80 Special Attack is not very high. It can also spare a few attack EVs to improve damage on Clefable, especially with Outrage. Generally, Flygon should be using Defense hindering nature rather than a Special Defense lowering one; Flygon avoids a 2HKO from maximum Special Attack Heatran's Fire Blast with its Special Defense in tact and can heal off the damage. Therefore, a Hasty nature is recommended. A Mild nature is an alternative that allows Flygon to pressure Milotic, Zapdos, and Gliscor more effectively. Exceptions to using a Defense hindering nature are teams that handle Heatran well elsewhere or need Flygon to act as a makeshift check to Dragon Dance Tyranitar, such as fully Spikes immune teams. Alternatively, Flygon can hold an Expert Belt to increase its potential to bluff holding a Choice Scarf and also not take residual damage, but Life Orb's power bonus is extremely useful.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Perhaps the best way to play this Flygon is to behave as if it has a Choice Scarf at first. For example, come in on a Pokemon such as Starmie (who outspeeds Flygon) and threaten it with U-turn or Thunder Punch. The Starmie user will likely switch out, at which point Flygon can use Draco Meteor against the opponent's switch-in. Against stall, you do not have to risk your Flygon as such, as it can 2HKO or OHKO every common foe on a stall team bar Hippowdon, Clefable, and Suicune, along with using Roost to heal off the residual damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Flygon is a staple of the Spikes offense style due to its potency against defensive teams and more midpaced offenses that struggle to switch into it. Skarmory is perhaps mixed Flygon's best partner, as many bulky walls besides Clefable are grounded and struggle to switch-in with Spikes up. Flygon can itself switch into Skarmory's resistances to wreak havoc. Ways to prevent Rapid Spin are especially helpful too. Rotom-A and Gengar are excellent choices to block Rapid Spin. Gengar is especially potent against defensive teams, as it heavily threatens Clefable alongside Flygon, commonly outspeeds defensive Latias that try to outspeed Flygon, and can burn walls such as Hippowdon. Tyranitar is also great due to Pursuit trapping Starmie and Flygon already heavily threatens Forretress. Tyranitar can additionally sweep with Dragon Dance, as it appreciates mixed Flygon's wallbreaking ability. Lucario can take advantage of Gliscor, Gyarados, and Zapdos being lured in and defeated. Choice Scarf Lucario is also one of the most reliable revenge killers to use alongside Flygon, as it can check all of Dragon Dance Gyarados, Tyranitar, and Dragonite that can set up on Flygon after it uses Draco Meteor as well as take advantage of Spikes with Copycat copying opposing phazing moves. Swampert is an excellent partner to set up Stealth Rock and help Flygon against Clefable.</p> <p>Flygon also enjoys ways to remove Clefable's Leftovers, as it can 2HKO it with Earthquake + Draco Meteor without Leftovers. Specially defensive Empoleon and one's own Clefable can be quite effective and provide back up into strong special attackers that threaten Flygon. Latias also can help against Water-types and Breloom and appreciates a weakened Clefable. Modest Choice Specs sets threaten to break through Clefable, while defensive sets provide a remarkable amount of defensive utility. Other strong Clefable punishers such as Heatran and Breloom can fit alongside mixed Flygon, while Bronzong can help shore up Flygon defensively without being weak to Spikes. Offensive Calm Mind Jirachi appreciates Flygon breaking through slower defensive Latias with Roar, while more defensive Jirachi appreciates Spikes and wallbreaking.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>While Flygon is often forgotten in favor of Dragonite, the Choice Band set can pose a huge threat to a lot of teams. Thanks to its excellent Dragon / Ground typing and its ability, Levitate, Flygon has many opportunities to switch in with its unique resistances to Rock and Fire, and immunities to Electric- and Ground-type attacks. Many opponents underestimate the power of Flygon's STAB attacks because of its 100 base Attack; however, Flygon can 2HKO Pokemon like Swampert, Zapdos, and even Bold Suicune if it takes prior Stealth Rock damage. U-turn is a fantastic option on Choice Band Flygon, as it can give you the benefit of scouting your opponent's Flygon counter. Fire Punch allows Flygon to hit Skarmory and 2HKO specially defensive variants after Stealth Rock, and it reliably 2HKOes Bronzong and OHKOes Scizor. If one has Magnezone support to eliminate these Steel-types, though, Stone Edge or Dragon Claw become the superior options, letting Flygon hit Flying-types and Levitators without locking itself into Outrage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An Adamant nature maximizes Flygon's power, which is crucial for foes slower than Flygon like Suicune, physically defensive Zapdos, Milotic, Hippowdon, and Swampert. Jolly nature, however, can be important for getting the jump on Roserade, faster Jirachi variants, Jolly Lucario, and Gliscor. 88 EVs can be taken out of Attack and invested into Defense to always survive a +2 Adamant Lucario's Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock damage, but the sacrifice in power is usually not worth it.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>All Choice Band users require prediction to use effectively, but this applies to Flygon more than most other Pokemon due to its risky STAB moves. A Choice-locked Earthquake is a great opportunity for the likes of Dragonite and Gyarados to switch in; allowing these dangerous free switches can be problematic. Outrage, while hitting almost everyone for good damage, forces Flygon to remain in play for two to three turns, leaving it very vulnerable to revenge kills from Mamoswine or other fast Ice attackers. Try to use U-turn whenever you can, as Choice Band U-turn actually deals a ton of damage to foes like Tyranitar, Latias, and Uxie.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Heatran pairs well with Choice Band Flygon due to the fact that many of Heatran's checks and counters are beaten by Flygon, and vice versa. Heatran easily resists Bullet Punch and Extreme Speed, which hit Flygon for neutral damage and impend Flygon from being effective. Scizor still pairs well with Flygon due to U-turn spamming. Scizor works better with Choice Band Flygon, however, because the Pokemon who usually outspeed Flygon can be picked off by Scizor. As Scizor is a problem for Flygon, Magnezone support is always welcome. Choice Scarf Magnezone obtains the bonus of defeating Lucario much easier and, with Knock Off or Trick support, takes down Skarmory as well.</p> <p>Pairing Flygon with wallbreakers is always welcome due to the abundant Pokemon who are strong on the defensive side and Flygon's access to U-turn. Gliscor, Hippowdon, and the aforementioned Skarmory give issues to this Flygon. Infernape wrecks all three of these Pokemon easily with a combination of Hidden Power Ice, Grass Knot, and Fire Blast. Seeking versatile Pokemon such as Infernape or Gengar is always welcome. Spikes and Toxic Spikes support is also always welcome. Forretress can look into either entry hazard while Skarmory has Spikes, a recovery move, and a phazing move to help with Flygon's team.</p> "

  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnezone's ability Magnet Pull, which allows it to trap Steel-types and effectively cripple or remove most of them, is unmatched by any other Pokemon. The consistency that comes with trapping as opposed to luring a target can enable a variety of setup sweepers and physical attackers. In particular, trapping Skarmory, Jirachi, Empoleon, and even Bronzong can be extremely desirable. Magnezone can fit on just about any team thanks to its unparalleled utility. Not to mention, its extremely powerful base 130 Special Attack and desirable Electric-type STAB distinguishes its offensive potential outside of its ability. In addition, Magnezone is the only Electric / Steel type in the metagame—other than its pre-evolutions—that resists the popular BoltBeam coverage, and it has a 4x resistance to Steel-type attacks. In the latter case, Jirachi's Iron Head does barely any damage to Magnezone.</p> <p>Magnezone's typing is both a blessing and a curse, giving it very useful and unique resistances but also giving it crippling weaknesses to Fire-, Fighting-, and especially Ground-type attacks. Coupled with Magnezone's relatively low Speed, its weaknesses are quite pronounced, meaning many Pokemon can switch in and force Magnezone out. In particular, it has trouble with Ground-, Fire-, Fighting-, and Grass-types. In addition, metagame staples like Latias, Tyranitar, Swampert, and Clefable all match up quite well against Magnezone, threatening it with a variety of status and attacking moves. It can be quite dangerous to solely depend on Magnezone to shut down Skarmory, as it can potentially hold Shed Shell, enabling it to switch out.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute can be used to punish Choice-locked Jirachi and Bronzong while levitating with Magnet Rise. This move combines especially well with Charge Beam, as Magnezone can safely boost its Special Attack while behind a Substitute. Discharge is an alternative STAB move that can be used over Thunderbolt for its increased paralysis chance; however, Magnezone usually wants Thunderbolt's additional power to increase its odds in one-on-one matchups against a variety of Steel-types. Refresh is a nifty choice that can enable Magnezone to combat Will-O-Wisp Rotom-A, especially in conjunction with Metal Sound. The latter makes Magnezone quite threatening versus defensive teams thanks to its gargantuan 64 PP. In addition, Metal Sound can be used to check Calm Mind Clefable and even CroCune if you can switch Magnezone in quickly. Psych Up is another interesting choice to mess with the aforementioned Calm Mind sweepers and should be used with Substitute. Mirror Coat can catch opposing Latias, Zapdos, and Kingdra by surprise, but it may not be an overall reliable choice. Magnezone can use Rain Dance to clear the sand for something like Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune, but it should only do this if it can't make too much use of its other utility moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Swampert, Hippowdon, Flygon, Gliscor, and even Mamoswine can give Magnezone a very difficult time. While these Pokemon need to watch out for utility options like Toxic or a super effective Hidden Power, they can typically find many opportunities to come in and force Magnezone out with the threat of a devastating 4x super effective Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Infernape, Breloom, and Lucario can devastate Magnezone with their powerful Fighting-type moves. While Infernape and Lucario need to watch out for Choice Scarf Magnezone, they can almost always force Magnezone out provided that they switch in safely. Breloom resists Magnezone's Electric-type attacks, and thanks to Poison Heal, it can block status moves like Thunder Wave and Toxic. While it needs to watch out for Hidden Power Fire, Magnezone is often disadvantaged in the one-on-one matchup.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Heatran, Infernape, and other Fire-types can threaten Magnezone with their STAB super effective Fire-type attacks. Heatran in particular has a lot of natural bulk, so it can often switch in safely while healthy into Magnezone's Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Electric-immune and -resistant Pokemon: Ground-, Grass-, and Dragon-types like the aforementioned Ground-types, Breloom, Shaymin, Celebi, Rotom-A, and Latias are immune to or resist Electric-type attacks and can all give Magnezone a hard time. Shaymin and Celebi in particular don't mind status too much thanks to Natural Cure and don't take that much damage from Hidden Power Fire. Latias, especially a Refresh variant, can shrug off status and effectively wall most Magnezone.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Blissey, Clefable, Tyranitar, and other special walls that aren't extremely crippled by status can give Magnezone a very difficult time and often force it out by threatening it with status or chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks: While Magnezone's typing is a blessing, it also comes with some nasty weaknesses. Many Pokemon carry super effective, threatening moves that can make Magnezone difficult to use. Examples include but are not limited to: Jirachi's Fire Punch and Hidden Power Ground; Hidden Power Fire from the likes of Roserade, opposing Magnezone, and Latias; and Ground- and Fire-type moves from Tyranitar and Flygon.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Magnet Rise",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Magnezone can maximize its trapping potential by utilizing Magnet Rise, which enables it to effectively remove additional Steel-types like Bronzong and even slower Metagross variants because of the temporary Ground immunity it provides. Furthermore, Magnet Rise provides counterplay to Pokemon like Hippowdon and Flygon. In Bronzong's case, no other trapper can even come close to threatening it, let alone remove it consistently, so this truly distinguishes Magnet Rise Magnezone. Thunderbolt is recommended over a move like Discharge because Magnezone needs all the power it can get against foes like Jirachi and Skarmory. Hidden Power Fire is preferred to devastate Scizor and Forretress, but Hidden Power Grass or even Hidden Power Ice can be used as alternatives. Hidden Power Grass lets Magnezone lure in and remove Swampert while still hitting other Ground-types like Hippowdon super effectively, while Hidden Power Ice allows Magnezone to lure in and KO Gliscor and Flygon while doing nice damage versus Latias and Dragonite.</p> <p>From there, Magnezone has many different options for its final move. Thunder Wave gives it great consistency versus a myriad of Jirachi variants while crippling Pokemon like Latias and Tyranitar. Toxic can also cripple them, but it has the additional benefit of synergizing with Magnet Rise to beat Hippowdon in a one-on-one matchup. Protect is a great option to scout Choice item users like Flygon, Infernape, and Rotom-A while giving Magnezone greater longevity. It has the added bonus of wearing down foes like Infernape and Latias when under sand. Explosion is a solid alternative that enables Magnezone to deal significant damage to or KO foes like Blissey, Clefable, Latias, and Swampert. However, Explosion is more of a luxury than Thunder Wave or Toxic, as it is on the weaker side, especially with a Modest nature, so you may have to sacrifice Magnezone's Defense or Special Defense to accommodate the move.</p> <p>If Magnet Rise's utility is not important for your team, you can opt to replace it with a different utility move, such as Thunder Wave or Protect.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Modest nature and maximum Special Attack investment are recommended to maximize Magnezone's trapping potential against Steel-types. 220 Speed EVs are used to outspeed foes like defensive Suicune and Machamp. While the HP and Defense EVs are arbitrary, more Speed and a Timid nature can be used to increase the likelihood of outspeeding Metagross, which would allow Magnezone to trap it and use Magnet Rise to avoid an Earthquake, as well as maximum Speed Empoleon, which can commonly be seen as a lead. Additional Speed is recommended when using Hidden Power Grass as well to outspeed maximum Speed Swampert. Leftovers is extremely important to ensure that Magnezone can effectively beat Wish + Protect Jirachi in a one-on-one matchup. Without passive recovery, Jirachi can flinch Magnezone down with Iron Head. Chople Berry can be an alternative item for teams that really need a backup check for Gengar and even Lucario and Infernape, but this should only be done if it's absolutely necessary.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>To better confirm your trapping target, keep Magnezone concealed for as long as possible. If your goal is to remove Wish + Protect Jirachi with Magnezone, try to avoid taking status like burn and having Leftovers be removed by Knock Off. Try to scout the movesets of trapping targets as much as you can before sending Magnezone in so you're not caught off guard by something like Hidden Power Ground or U-turn on Jirachi. Be careful when sending Magnezone in against Bronzong, as it may use Earthquake to catch Magnezone on the switch. If using Toxic, concealing it can be beneficial for confirming targets like Hippowdon and Latias. If you opt for Protect, however, using it frequently to wear down foes, scout their moves, and gain passive recovery with Leftovers is strongly recommended.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Magnezone is much more of a team supporter rather than a Pokemon that requires support to function; however, certain Pokemon can help to make Magnezone's job easier. Knock Off users like Clefable, Gliscor, and even Tentacruel can remove Skarmory's Shed Shell so Magnezone can trap it. Knock Off also helps tremendously to increase Magnezone's odds one-on-one versus Jirachi. U-turn users like Flygon, Jirachi, and Scizor can help Magnezone switch in more safely. Choice item Pokemon with Trick, such as Latias and Jirachi, can create opportunities for Magnezone to switch in and trap a foe by locking it into a move. Spinners like Starmie can synergize nicely with Magnezone, as trapping Skarmory and other potential entry hazard setters like Bronzong and Jirachi and then spinning the entry hazards away can be a huge asset against defensive teams.</p> <p>There are a large number of Pokemon that can benefit from Magnezone's ability to trap and remove Steel-types. Examples of Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Skarmory and Bronzong are Choice Scarf Flygon, Gliscor, Dragon Dance users, Latias, Metagross, offensive Trick Room Bronzong, Suicune, Nidoqueen, Milotic, and Swampert. Other Pokemon like Tyranitar and Jirachi may have sets that don't match up well against Skarmory and Bronzong, so they can also benefit from Magnet Rise Magnezone.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Magnezone sets itself apart from other Magnezone sets by trapping Lucario and faster variants of Empoleon, guaranteeing paralysis versus Jirachi provided that it switches in safely, and outspeeding Pokemon like Infernape, Latias, and Gengar. Thunderbolt is Magnezone's most consistent STAB move. Hidden Power Fire helps with hazard control by removing Forretress, and it also removes Scizor. In addition, it hits Breloom and other Steel-types for super effective damage. Magnezone makes excellent use of Thunder Wave by paralyzing Jirachi and Latias. Explosion rounds out the set with a hit-all type of approach. While Magnezone's Explosion is not that powerful, it will still do a significant amount of damage to any non-resistant foe. Flash Cannon is an acceptable alternative to Explosion, which can hit Tyranitar, Latias, and Gliscor for decent damage. Toxic can be used to catch Swampert, Gliscor, and Latias off guard, but it's difficult to fit and can be quite risky in the face of setup sweepers.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Even with Explosion, a Timid nature is recommended here, as sacrificing either one of Magnezone's defensive stats is counterintuitive for its trapping consistency. A Naive nature, for example, will make it significantly more difficult for Magnezone to pivot into Latias's Draco Meteor. A Special Attack-increasing nature is not a good choice here either, as Magnezone will be unable to outspeed Infernape, Latias, and Gengar, and it may have to Speed tie or be outsped by maximum Speed Jirachi.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If you're trying to trap and cripple Jirachi, try not to switch into a Body Slam, Thunder, or Fire Punch, as a Magnezone with no additional bulk can be easily worn down. It is extra important to keep Magnezone around for as long as possible if you solely depend on it to shut down Lucario, so this practice can be ill-advised. You can often make use of Magnezone's great Speed with this set to finish off weakened Steel-types, like Bronzong, Metagross, and even Heatran, so keep that in mind when executing a gameplan. When making use of Thunder Wave, try to make sure a setup sweeper or an already crippled Pokemon cannot properly take advantage of Magnezone being Choice-locked into a non-attacking move. Also, try not to hastily use Explosion, as it is relatively weak, especially with a Timid nature.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Magnezone is much more of a team supporter as opposed to a Pokemon that requires support to function. U-turn users like Jirachi, Celebi, and Scizor can enable Magnezone to come in safely against opposing Jirachi. Pokemon that don't mind Magnezone's lack of Magnet Rise to consistently remove Bronzong but appreciate Magnezone's removal of Skarmory and Lucario are great partners. Scizor comes to mind, as Bronzong can have a lot of difficulty breaking it, while Scizor can consistently wear Bronzong down for Magnezone to finish off later. Swampert and Suicune appreciate Magnezone's removal of Skarmory and can also have a decent matchup versus Bronzong. Knock Off users like Clefable and Gliscor pair quite nicely with Magnezone, which can assist in removing all Steel-types.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Endure",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Endure Magnezone takes a much more offensive approach as opposed to a balanced one and functions as a soft check to Dragon Dance Gyarados and Kingdra through an Endure + Custap Berry strategy. Additionally, this Magnezone has the unique ability to trap and remove Heatran with Hidden Power Ground provided that it enters Custap Berry range. Hidden Power Fire is generally recommended, however, for the removal of Scizor and Forretress as well as the super effective damage against Breloom. Explosion rounds out the set to hopefully take another Pokemon with it when its health is low. Sometimes, Magnet Rise will be desired here to trap and remove Bronzong and maybe even Metagross.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Rash nature is recommended to maximize Special Attack while not reducing Explosion's power. While it may seem like a bad idea to reduce either of Magnezone's defensive stats, this set uses Explosion much more often than most other sets, so it usually wants the power. In addition, the Endure + Custap Berry strategy means that it's not usually as concerned about being weakened. 56 HP EVs enable Magnezone to survive Choice Scarf Scizor's Superpower after Stealth Rock damage. This is quite helpful because Magnezone will not need to use Endure against a suspected Choice Scarf Scizor. 220 Speed EVs allow Magnezone to outspeed Machamp and minimum Speed Suicune. The remaining EVs are poured into Special Attack to maximize its power given the constraints.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Don't haphazardly use Endure, as revealing it while not sustaining damage will cause the strategy to go wrong. Try to save it as an emergency option to push back an offensive assault from your opponent and shift momentum in your direction. Even with Hidden Power Ground, do not over-rely on Magnezone to trap and remove Heatran, as moves like Magma Storm can throw a wrench in the strategy, and Lava Plume can inflict a burn. Be careful versus Jirachi, as without Leftovers providing passive recovery or Choice Scarf letting Magnezone outspeed it, Magnezone becomes a lot less consistent against it. Magnezone still has the potential to deal significant damage to Jirachi or even KO it, but to do this you should preserve Magnezone's HP as much as possible.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Scizor and Jirachi may appreciate the Hidden Power Ground variant of this set, especially the former, as trapping Heatran and providing an emergency check to Gyarados is extremely beneficial to Scizor. A hyper offense team consisting of several physical attackers appreciates Magnezone's ability to trap Skarmory and function as an emergency check to opposing setup sweepers, which can be a great tool to reverse momentum. A team with other Explosion users, like Gengar, Bronzong, and Metagross, can synergize well with Magnezone. Overall, if your team wants Magnezone but needs a backup answer to Dragon Dance sweepers, this set will often be a solid choice.</p> "

  "Gallade": {
    "overview": "<p>Due to stiff competition from Lucario and even Heracross, Gallade may not be the primary Fighting-type of choice for your team; however, Gallade has many interesting qualities that make him viable to fill a certain niche in your team. To differentiate himself from his Fighting-type counterparts, Gallade has access to powerful STAB Psychic moves and can run both Ice Punch and Stone Edge simultaneously, something Heracross cannot do, while Lucario rarely finds room for both. Unlike Heracross and Lucario, Gallade also has access to Trick, which allows him to cripple troublesome walls he may not be able to normally overcome.</p> <p>However, Gallade does have some major drawbacks. Gallade's Speed is decidedly average by OU standards, meaning he is outrun and revenge killed by many Pokemon, and, unlike Lucario, does not have access to good priority moves. Gallade's Defense is also lackluster, meaning he's easy prey for powerful physical threats and priority users, such as Gyarados and Scizor, respectively. Despite these faults, Gallade is still a very powerful Pokemon in the right hands, and he is not one to be taken lightly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sometimes it can be hard to find an opportunity to set up Swords Dance with Gallade, but he still hits hard, thanks to his base 125 Attack and Life Orb. Therefore, it is possible to forgo Swords Dance and simply use a coverage move in its place. Gallade has a pretty wide movepool, mostly consisting of gimmick moves and moves used better by other Pokemon, but they can be amusing when used correctly. Gallade's low Speed can aid him when using Trick Room, and he can be a monster under it, but there are better Pokemon to set it up. Destiny Bond can be used against slower opponents if Gallade is at low health to take the opponent down with him, but he is generally too slow to make full use of it. Bulk Up can make for an effective set with investment in HP and Special Defense, bolstering Gallade's weak Defense and already amazing Attack. Earthquake and Leaf Blade are options, but Earthquake is generally outclassed by Close Combat and a 2x super effective Leaf Blade hits just as hard as a neutral Close Combat, but has merit for demolishing Swampert.</p> <p>Gallade gets Wish, so it is an interesting option, but it is illegal along with any Egg Moves and is outclassed by other users of Wish, such as Jirachi and Vaporeon. Hypnosis was already mentioned earlier, but it has a rather disappointing accuracy. Along with Hypnosis, Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave can be used to make an interesting status set. Finally, Encore is an option to attempt to get a free turn of set-up against a support Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gallade has no \"counters\" in the strictest sense of the word, as he can 2HKO every switch-in with the appropriate move. Ghost-types are the best switch-ins, as they can switch in for free against Gallade's Close Combat and hit back with super effective Shadow Ball. In particular, Rotom-A can survive Gallade's moves and cripple him with Will-O-Wisp, but it must be careful not to switch into Night Slash or Psycho Cut. Celebi laughs at anything but Ice Punch, Night Slash, or X-Scissor, and can cripple Gallade with Thunder Wave or do some damage with Leaf Storm. Gallade also hates Scizor, due to his deadly Bullet Punch.</p> <p>Any fast physical attacker is a good choice to prey on Gallade's weak physical Defense. Gliscor also gets particular mention for being able to take anything but Ice Punch with ease, but it needs significant Attack investment and an Attack-boosting nature to OHKO Gallade with Aerial Ace. Alternatively, Gliscor's Earthquake OHKOes Gallade after a defense drop from Close Combat.</p> ",

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Gallade may not be a common sweeper in the OU tier due to his middling Speed, but he has the potential to rip huge holes in opposing teams. With Swords Dance boosting Jolly Gallade's Attack stat from 349 to 698, he can do incredible damage with his near-perfect type coverage and a 120 Base Power STAB attack in Close Combat. For example, after a Swords Dance, Skarmory is always OHKOed by a Life Orb Close Combat with Stealth Rock on the field, even when Gallade is running a Jolly nature.</p> <p>By virtue of his secondary Psychic typing, Gallade can effectively use STAB Psycho Cut to handle Ghost-types and Pokemon who resist Fighting-type moves. Furthermore, Psycho Cut can be used without fear of running into Dark-type Pokemon, because they risk being maimed by a powerful Close Combat. Gallade also has access to Ice Punch, a move Heracross fails to learn, which he can use to hit Pokemon such as Celebi, Gliscor, and Zapdos for significant damage. Also, Gallade's typing gives it an advantage over Lucario when dealing with the aforementioned Pokemon, as he is not completely destroyed by their respective super effective coverage moves. Even though Ice Punch deals with all of those Pokemon, Stone Edge is still a good choice for dealing with Gyarados, who is outsped and OHKOed even after Intimidate (unless Gyarados is running a speed-boosting nature). Stone Edge also retains super effective coverage against Zapdos, but with its poor accuracy and Zapdos's Pressure and superior Speed, Zapdos can easily PP stall it with Roost.</p> <p>If you dislike Life Orb's recoil, Leftovers and Lum Berry are possible alternatives, to give Gallade more longevity. Another possible moveset Gallade can use is Swords Dance, Hypnosis, Close Combat, and Night Slash. This can potentially allow Gallade to incapacitate the opponent, set up Swords Dance, and attempt to sweep the opposing team with Night Slash and Close Combat, two moves that provide near-perfect coverage (resisted only by Toxicroak and Heracross). However, Gallade really likes having three attacking moves to deal with certain Pokemon, so it isn't highly recommended.</p> <p>Night Slash can be used over Psycho Cut to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types harder, but it doesn't gain too many notable 2HKOs or OHKOs, so Psycho Cut is generally a better option. Shadow Sneak can be used for priority as well, but the only Pokemon it can OHKO after a Swords Dance are Gengar and Starmie after Stealth Rock damage. Shadow Sneak can still be useful for picking off weakened Pokemon, but Lucario outclasses him in that regard, due to his access to Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Jolly is the preferred nature, as it allows you to outspeed all neutral-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon and below, such as Adamant Dragonite and Lucario. It also allows you to outspeed positive-natured Heatran, allowing you to overcome it with Close Combat. Adamant is an option for pure power, but Gallade is then outsped by some crucial Pokemon, like the aforementioned Heatran.</p> <p>Gallade appreciates Pokemon who can spread paralysis around the opponent's team, so teammates such as Celebi and Jirachi are good partners to Gallade. Since Lucario and Gallade are so similar, you can run Swords Dance Lucario alongside this Gallade so they can weaken each other's counters and make it easier for one another to sweep. Rotom-A and Gengar can be problematic to Gallade due to their higher Speed, immunity to Close Combat, and STAB super effective Shadow Balls, so Choice Scarf Tyranitar, arguably the best Pursuit user in OU, can be used to trap and kill them; however, it's inadvisable, because Gallade will then lose 16% of his health in a turn, factoring in Life Orb recoil and sandstorm damage. Other Pursuit users to look into include Snorlax, Metagross, and Scizor.</p> "

        "name": "Attacking Lead",
        "description": "<p>With lead Machamp running around and causing mayhem and centralization in the lead metagame, you may ask yourself \"why would I use Gallade when Machamp is available?\" The answer is that Gallade has several advantages over Machamp that allow it to function quite well in the lead position. Gallade's first advantage is his base 80 Speed, which allows him to outspeed many threatening Pokemon that Machamp cannot, most notably Timid Heatran. Second, Gallade has a better-typed priority move, which means that fast, frail attackers, such as Gengar and Starmie, are hit much harder before Gallade is killed. Perhaps the most important asset that Gallade has, however, is his Psychic-type STAB that gives him respectable coverage and enables him to OHKO opposing Machamp.</p> <p>Close Combat is the preferred STAB option over any other Fighting-type move due to its high Base Power and reliability. Zen Headbutt's main use is to OHKO lead Machamp 100% of the time with Life Orb, but it gives Gallade very good type coverage anyway, hitting Poison-type Pokemon that resist Close Combat super effectively. Shadow Sneak 2HKOes lead Azelf, picks off Aerodactyl, deals a fair amount of damage to Starmie and Gengar, and revenge kills boosted Pokemon. The last slot is a decision between Ice Punch and Stone Edge; Ice Punch allows Gallade to OHKO Dragonite and most Gliscor, as well as 2HKO all Celebi with Stealth Rock. Stone Edge hits Dragonite, takes a good chunk out of Gyarados, and slams even defensive Zapdos for a guaranteed 2HKO after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>The EVs on this set are simple: 252 Attack lets Gallade hit as hard as possible. 252 Speed along with a Jolly nature allows Gallade to outspeed every Pokemon below 284 Speed, most notably Timid Heatran. Gallade has an enormous movepool, so he has many options at his disposal. Leaf Blade can be used to OHKO Swampert, but it has little utility outside of that. Will-O-Wisp is a good move to surprise Metagross and Swampert with, and it allows Gallade to cripple physical sweepers later in the game. Hypnosis is useful to incapacitate Pokemon that would otherwise try and set up on him, such as Skarmory and Forretress, but it is generally unreliable. Finally, X-Scissor along with Shadow Sneak allows Gallade to beat Azelf without Life Orb, OHKO Starmie and Celebi, and 2HKO Uxie.</p> <p>Gallade is a difficult Pokemon to build a team around, but there are a few Pokemon that support it quite nicely. Skarmory and Forretress comfortably set up on Swampert, Jirachi without Trick, and Metagross, three leads that Gallade has trouble beating. Swampert also makes a good teammate since he can set up on Jirachi and Metagross that aren't packing Explosion. Offensively, Gyarados appreciates Gallade's ability to lure in and weaken Rotom-A, and Breloom loves having Rotom-A and Gliscor dead or weakened enough to be KOed by Seed Bomb. Lastly, Heatran can KO lead Metagross with Fire Blast if Metagross isn't carrying an Occa Berry or is weakened by Gallade's Close Combat.</p> "

        "name": "Choice",
        "description": "<p>With a Choice item, Gallade can be an offensive battering ram, dealing massive damage with Close Combat, or serving as a revenge killer who can outrun Adamant Dragonite after one Dragon Dance. In general, it is better to use Choice Band rather than Choice Scarf, because the offensive power Gallade boasts is amazing. Gallade also has an advantage over Heracross in the form of Ice Punch and Psycho Cut, which allow him to take out Gliscor with good prediction, and deal decent damage to Rotom-A without resorting to Night Slash. Finally, Choiced Gallade has the advantage of being able to Trick away his Choice item when it is not wanted anymore, potentially crippling a troublesome wall.</p> <p>Close Combat is the move Gallade should use most often, as when it's backed up by a monstrous Choice Band-boosted 523 Attack and an effective 180 Base Power factoring in STAB, even targets who resist it take heavy damage. Psycho Cut hits Ghost-types such as Rotom-A and other Pokemon who take little damage from Close Combat. Be careful against the Rotom formes, however, as Gallade hates Will-O-Wisp. The third slot, once again, is dependent on whom you would like to beat. Offensive Gyarados is always OHKOed by -1 Choice Band Stone Edge, and while it falls short against bulky Gyarados, Stone Edge also hits Zapdos harder than Ice Punch. Ice Punch, on the other hand, allows you to deal with Celebi, Dragonite, and Gliscor, and still hits Zapdos super effectively. Trick as the final move is an interesting option, as it differentiates Gallade from his fellow Fighting-type Choice Band users, and is one of the main reasons to use Gallade over Lucario.</p> <p>Choice Scarf is still a viable item to make Gallade a decent revenge killer, but it is outclassed by Choice Band Gallade and other Choice Scarf revenge killers in general, such as Jirachi and Flygon. Choice Scarf should run the same moveset as Choice Band, but has the ability to revenge kill Adamant +1 Dragonite with a Jolly nature.</p> <p>X-Scissor is an option to hit Celebi and other bulky Psychic-types harder than the options listed, but its uses are really limited to just that. Shadow Sneak is another option that can be used to pick off weakened foes on the Choice Band set, but has almost no use on the Choice Scarf set. If you decide to use Shadow Sneak, be wary of locking yourself into it, because it can potentially turn Gallade into setup fodder. Another option is Night Slash, which can be used to deal super effective damage to bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types.</p> <p>Jolly is the preferred nature on both sets, but once again, Adamant is still an option if you prefer raw power over speed. On the Choice Scarf set, if you decide to run an Adamant nature, a spread of 64 HP / 252 Atk / 192 Spe is plausible, to add to Gallade's natural bulk and outspeed Choice Scarf Tyranitar and all positive base 115 Speed Pokemon, but max Speed is still useful to Speed tie with a neutral-natured +1 Dragonite. Also, if using Choice Scarf, Zen Headbutt is an option for the flinch rate, but the 10% accuracy loss generally outweighs the 20% power boost on most sets, and Gallade's mediocre Speed prevents it from abusing the flinch rate.</p> <p>Once again, Gallade loves paralysis support (especially Choice Band variants), so any Pokemon who can provide it is his friend. Choice Band Heracross can also work nicely alongside Gallade, as they both have similar counters whom they can wear down for each other with powerful Close Combats. You should also have a good switch-in to Scizor, as he may be troublesome with his Bullet Punch and U-turn. Heatran makes a great partner in this regard, being able to switch in on anything Scizor has besides Superpower, which Gallade resists. Magnezone can also work to eliminate Scizor, and resists all of Gallade's weaknesses.</p> "

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatran is the anti-metagame Pokemon, capable of keeping top threats, such as Scizor, Lucario, Infernape, and Dragonite, in check with its popular Choice Scarf set. With the ability to counter some of the biggest threats in the game and a neutrality to Stealth Rock, Heatran is far beyond the level of any other Fire-type in Pokemon. The secondary Steel typing gives it a lot of good resistances, and Flash Fire allows it to take on its fellow Fire-types quite easily. While the weaknesses to extremely common moves such as Earthquake, Surf, and Close Combat hinder its walling potential, its ability as a defensive Pokemon should not be overlooked. With decent defensive typing and one of the highest Special Attack stats in the Overused tier, Heatran should not be underestimated.</p> <p>Heatran will be seen on a lot of teams, so be prepared for it. Heatran is a sturdy tank, a great team player, and a frightening sweeper. Its frequent presence near the top of the usage list is for a good reason, and if your team is not prepared to deal with it then you cannot expect to have a healthy winning record.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Electric can be used to nab a surprise kill on Gyarados, especially if they suspect Heatran is Choiced. Hidden Power Rock gets 2HKOs on both Gyarados and Dragonite while also hitting opposing Heatran for neutral, easing prediction on Choiced sets. However, running either will leave Heatran completely walled by Swampert. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast on most sets if you prefer accuracy at the cost of some important KOs. Dragon Pulse is an option on sets other than Choice Scarf to hit Kingdra, Dragonite, and Flygon for super effective while also maintaining neutrality on Gyarados and other Water-types. As far as items go, a Salac Berry can be used on Substitute sets to gain a Speed boost and possibly sweep.</p> <p>Never underestimate Heatran's bulk and support move options. By using a Modest Nature and Leftovers with the spread 252 HP / 16 SpA / 240 SpD, Heatran can always survive a Life Orb Shadow Ball followed by a Focus Blast from Gengar and OHKO back with Overheat. Utilizing Will-O-Wisp on such a specially bulky set allows Heatran to also cripple physical sweepers as well, making it a very tough Pokemon to take out. Finally, when going the utility route, it could be useful for Heatran to set up Stealth Rock while enduring hits, and even use Roar to shuffle opponents and pile on the entry hazard damage.</p> <p>Do not be tempted to use moves like Dark Pulse, Flash Cannon, and Ancient Power. Their type coverage is poor, and Heatran's Fire Blast will hit for the same or greater damage on nearly everything in OU.</p> <p>Always maximize Heatran's Special Attack unless you are running a defensive set. Then decide what you would like to outrun. 128 EVs and a Modest nature beats Adamant Tyranitar. Modest and 216 EVs beats Jolly Tyranitar and Adamant Metagross. On the Scarf set, just maximize Speed. You don't want to lose a Speed tie with another Scarftran if it comes down to it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Vaporeon, Swampert, Milotic, Slowking, and Tentacruel can counter Heatran quite effectively, but Specs boosted Hidden Power Grass and Earth Power can take them down. Suicune is the best of these, as its high defenses allow it to take an Explosion as well as most special attacks. Suicune is also faster than defensive Heatran sets, and its Pressure forces Heatran to watch its remaining Fire Blast PP. Gyarados can handle Heatran on occasion, but Stealth Rock, potential burns, and the occasional Hidden Power Electric are a nuisance. Porygon2 is an interesting counter. It traces Flash Fire and isn't weak to any other moves. Porygon2 can then paralyze Heatran and wear it down with Thunderbolt, using Recover as necessary. Kingdra can come in on Heatran and set up unless it switches into a Dragon Pulse.</p> <p>Blissey is a fairly good counter to Heatran, provided she has some means of hitting it. With the increase in Fire-type attacks thanks to Scizor, getting a Flash Fire boost is easier, which means Blissey might have to take boosted Fire-type attacks. Explosion also gets rid of Blissey, but at the cost of Heatran's own life. Heatran counters itself as long as it doesn't come into Earth Power. Magnezone can trap and KO Heatran if it is locked into a Hidden Power or Dragon Pulse.</p> <p>Snorlax can come into Heatran with relative impunity thanks to Thick Fat and can threaten it back with Earthquake. Hariyama does the same, but uses Fighting-type attacks instead. Like Blissey, both will fall to Explosion. A Careful Tyranitar can shrug off any hits not boosted by Choice Specs, even Earth Power, which barely 4HKOes.</p> ",

Heatran reaches a maximum Speed stat of 417 when wielding Choice Scarf, outspeeding all Pokemon in OU bar Ninjask. Heatran's typing and ability allows it to switch into a lot of attacks relatively unscathed, making it that much more useful as a revenge killer. Heatran also resists almost all of the priority attacks in the game, which makes it incredibly hard to KO unless your opponent is packing a faster Choice Scarf user, or a Pokemon that can resist the attack Heatran is locked into and KO back.</p> <p>Fire Blast serves as Heatran's main STAB move, allowing it to deal a ridiculous amount of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Pokemon such as Rash Dragonite risk being 2HKOed by Fire Blast with Stealth Rock due to Heatran's impressive Special Attack stat of 359. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast if you prefer accuracy over power, but it should be noted that the power difference is evident if you opt for Flamethrower. Earth Power is necessary on this set because it provides Heatran with a way of disposing of other Fire-types, specifically opposing Heatran. Explosion fills the third slot, giving Heatran an effective way of eliminating Blissey and bulky Water-type Pokemon that dare to switch in. For the last slot, Dragon Pulse, Hidden Power Grass, and Hidden Power Electric are all decent options. Dragon Pulse allows Heatran to revenge kill Dragonite and Kingdra without having to resort to Explosion, while Hidden Power Grass is useful in wearing down Water-types that can otherwise wall Heatran. Finally, Hidden Power Electric lets Heatran revenge kill +1 Adamant Gyarados that rarely suspect it and tend to stay in.</p> <p>A Modest or Rash nature can be considered if you feel the extra power is more beneficial to your team, but Heatran will miss out on outpacing Adamant Gyarados, Adamant Heracross, and at least tying with opposing Choice Scarfed Heatran.</p> <p>This set has trouble against Water-types and Blissey, so Pokemon that can take down both are effective options for this set. Celebi covers Heatran's weaknesses perfectly and can take down most Water-types with a STAB Grass Knot or Leaf Storm. Specifically, Celebi works best at countering Gyarados, which can set up on Heatran locked into Choice Scarf. Additionally, Heatran also covers Celebi's weaknesses. Scizor is another excellent teammate to Heatran, providing teams with extra insurance against Dragon Dance Dragonite which might have set up on Heatran; not only that, but Scizor is great at luring Fire-type attacks which activate Heatran's Flash Fire ability. Finally, Scizor can dispose of Blissey with Superpower if you are unable to KO her with Heatran.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Heatran makes for a fine lead and overall user of Stealth Rock, having the ability to easily take on the ever so common Metagross and Azelf leads. The only commonly seen leads that stand a chance against Heatran are Aerodactyl, Infernape, Machamp, and Swampert, but only the former two can actually prevent Heatran from laying down Stealth Rock. Although this set packs Explosion, Heatran is one of the few offensive leads that are not considered suicide leads, because it can often leave the scene in relatively good health due to its natural bulk, and provide the team with utility later in the game.</p> <p>Fire Blast provides Heatran with a powerful STAB option to apply offensive pressure while Earth Power is a reliable move for dealing with opposing Heatran (which cannot OHKO your Heatran thanks to Shuca Berry) and finishing off Occa Berry Metagross leads. With a Base Speed of 77, Heatran barely outpaces Smeargle, making Taunt a solid option over Explosion. Taunt will also allow Heatran to prevent any slower Pokemon from using Stealth Rock, which can be very useful if it has teammates that are weak to Rock-type attacks. Taunt can also stop certain Pokemon from setting up against Heatran, such as non-Jolly Gyarados, Kingdra, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Hidden Power Grass should also be considered over Explosion, as it allows Heatran to do a considerable amount of damage to Swampert, making the list of leads that can beat Heatran even shorter. Shuca Berry is the item of choice for this set, as it allows Heatran to stay in on Pokemon that might use Earthquake, such as Metagross and Swampert.</p> <p>If you decide to not use this set as a lead, players may assume that Heatran is holding a Choice Scarf. Due to this, Heatran can often net surprise kills on Dragonite and Gyarados with Explosion, especially with Shuca Berry ensuring that Heatran survives any Earthquakes coming from the two. Even Blissey can be caught off guard with a well-timed Explosion, which can easily allow other special sweepers on the team to plow through the opponent's team.</p> <p>Speed and Special Attack are maximized to allow Heatran to function as a special sweeper later in the game, especially with its ability to switch in fairly easily thanks to its handy typing. Running a Timid nature is an option if you want Heatran to be guaranteed to survive Azelf's Psychic + Explosion, but even with Naive, Azelf will need to roll nearly maximum damage from Explosion and above average damage from Psychic in order to score a KO, and the 10% boost to Heatran's own Explosion is often worth the risk.</p> <p>Despite its low accuracy, Magma Storm may be used over Fire Blast to bypass the ever-common Focus Sash on leads like Azelf. When combined with Taunt, Magma Storm also allows Heatran to trap opposing Pokemon and forcibly open a set up for one of its teammates. If opposing Heatran is of no concern, then Will-O-Wisp can be considered over Earth Power for catching all of the physical attackers that love to try and set up versus Heatran, such as Gyarados, Kingdra, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Dragonite.</p> <p>This set benefits most from partners that can switch into the leads which Heatran has trouble against, namely Aerodactyl, Infernape, Machamp, and Swampert. Gyarados is a great choice to consider pairing with this set because not only can Heatran set up on Infernape, Machamp, and Swampert with relative ease (especially if it switches in as the opponent uses Stealth Rock), but it also provides Heatran with a good Water- and Ground-type resistance and immunity, respectively. Against Aerodactyl, anything not weak to Rock or Ground will be of decent consideration to pair with this set. Suicune and its bulky defenses allow it to take on all three of the aforementioned leads relatively well and it can also dispose of other Water-types which switch into Heatran with Hidden Power Electric. However, Suicune does not provide Heatran with the same type resistances that Gyarados does.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<p>Heatran is one of the best Pokemon at forcing switches in the game. Because of this, Substitute is a great move choice, as it eliminates the guesswork often needed to nail its switch-ins. Fire Blast and Earth Power provide respectable coverage, and Toxic really hurts the many bulky Water-type Pokemon that tend to switch into Heatran. Explosion is also a great option for a more offensively-paced team, as they usually don't pack any Pokemon that can put Toxic's stacking damage to use.</p> <p>Heatran should be sent out against something that will likely switch out, such as Celebi or a Steel-type. It is often useful to send Heatran out for the first time after your opponent KOes one of your Pokemon; most players assume it has a Choice Scarf and will switch out. This, along with Heatran's powerful offense and great resistances, allows Heatran to easily get up a Substitute. Then Heatran can stall with Toxic, using Fire Blast and Earth Power for the Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon that are immune to Toxic. Most of Heatran's switch-ins, like Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Water-types, hate being poisoned.</p> <p>However, Toxic is less effective if your team is not bulky. You can use Explosion, instead, as it takes out most problem Pokemon in one hit. Few players will predict an Explosion coming from a Heatran behind a Substitute, so they are unlikely to bring in something to take it, like a Ghost-type. Alternatively, Heatran can use Hidden Power to take out Pokemon like Dragonite, Gyarados, or Swampert, if you want a more offensive alternative to Toxic. Heatran can also use Roar to help defensive teams that have Stealth Rock and Spikes. Another option is Will-O-Wisp, but it kills even slower than Toxic and has worse accuracy in exchange for weakening physical moves. If you want to use a move other than Toxic, it is helpful to pair Heatran with Toxic Spikes, but keep in mind that they won't hit Gyarados or Dragonite.</p> <p>It may seem strange to use a +Speed nature without a Choice Scarf, but due to Heatran's popularity, max Speed can be a huge aid. Heatran can attack before +Speed Breloom and Metagross, neutral nature Gyarados, Dragonite, Heracross, and defensive base 100 Pokemon. These can all OHKO Heatran, so being faster is crucial.</p> <p>This set partners best with Pokemon that can take advantage of a poisoned Water-type. For this reason, a Water-type of your own makes a decent partner to this set. Curse + RestTalk Swampert is one of the best partners to this set because it can take hits repeatedly, due to Rest, while Toxic wears down the opponent's Pokemon. Swords Dance Scizor, albeit not a Water-type, also pairs well with this set because other Water-types, primarily Gyarados, have no trouble walling the set otherwise. This Heatran also benefits from Wish. This is because you'll be wanting to switch into attacks often, and Heatran is losing HP due to using Substitute. Vaporeon is probably the best option for this due to Water Absorb.</p> "

This set allows Heatran to act as a fluent sweeper without the restrictions of a Choice item, while maintaining the power needed to achieve certain KOs that Heatran would otherwise miss without the boost Life Orb gives. Although Heatran's Speed stat is somewhat low compared to conventional sweepers, this set still outpaces most bulky teams and can effectively blast huge holes in them. Against offensive teams, Heatran provides a unique combination of resistances and immunities which provides it many opportunities to switch in and lay down the hurt.</p> <p>Fire Blast is Heatran's STAB move for this set, causing decent amounts of damage to common switch-ins such as Gyarados and Dragonite, while also ruining Scizor, Jirachi, and Celebi. Earth Power is essential in providing Heatran with a way of eliminating opposing Fire-types. The third moveslot is used to hit Water-types that might try to wall Heatran and hit back for super effective damage. Hidden Power Grass should be used if Swampert is more of a concern while Hidden Power Electric works best against Gyarados. For the last moveslot, Taunt, Explosion, and Substitute are all great options that benefit this set. Taunt negates any of your opponent's attempts to heal or set up. Explosion is an option that complements this set by providing a surefire way of taking out Blissey, OHKOing even max Defense versions after Stealth Rock, and other Pokemon that resist your Fire-type attack of choice. Finally, Substitute eases prediction at the cost of 25% of Heatran's HP each time it is used.</p> <p>Expert Belt can be used over Life Orb to bluff a Choice Scarf. Many players will attempt to set up on what they believe to be a Choiced Heatran only to be promptly KOed by a super effective attack (or Explosion). In any case, a Naive nature is recommended when running Explosion in order to deal as much damage as possible; otherwise, a Timid nature should be used. Special Attack and Speed are maxed to provide Heatran with the best sweeping potential, being able to 2HKO non-bulky Dragonite with Fire Blast after Stealth Rock and outpacing all neutral base 85's and below. It is possible to run a Modest nature along with Overheat over Fire Blast and Stealth Rock in the last slot if you are interested in using Heatran as an effective anti-lead.</p> <p>This set benefits greatly from Stealth Rock support, ensuring that Heatran gets the 2HKO on 4/0 Gyarados and Dragonite with Fire Blast. Azelf and Swampert can both efficiently lay down Stealth Rock. Azelf is particularly useful because it can Taunt opposing leads that might try to set up Stealth Rock and can use Explosion to create a free switch-in for Heatran, giving it more chances to attack if it comes in unscathed. Swampert is a reliable lead that has much more durability than Azelf, and it is also great for luring out Will-O-Wisps that provide Heatran with a free Flash Fire boost. Heatran also covers Swampert's weakness to Grass.</p> <p>Paralysis support is also a decent option to consider, giving Heatran a much easier time in taking down opposing Pokemon that otherwise outspeed it. Celebi is a great candidate to take this role, as it can not only use Thunder Wave effectively, but it also provides Heatran with valuable resistances to Fighting, Water, and Ground. Finally, Choice Band Scizor also pairs well with this set as Bullet Punch can take out foes Heatran has weakened. Specifically, Scizor works great at taking out weakened Gyarados and Dragonite that might attempt to set up on Heatran.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Heatran's plethora of resistances, natural bulk, ridiculously high Special Attack, and mediocre at best Speed all scream for Heatran to use Choice Specs. With this set, Heatran can come in on many occasions and just blast away, hitting even those that resist its attacks for a lot of damage. Because its Speed stat is not built for sweeping, this set is probably the best way for Heatran to deal immediate and significant damage on offensive teams. The move options provide Heatran with amazing coverage, allowing it to KO any and all of its switch-ins with perfect prediction.</p> <p>The boost from Choice Specs coupled with STAB in the form of Fire Blast or Overheat provides Heatran with a nearly unmatched level of power. Even Blissey risks being 2HKOed by a Flash Fire-boosted Fire Blast after Stealth Rock damage, and anything that doesn't resist Fire will be permanently destroyed. Between Fire Blast and Overheat, Fire Blast deals more damage over two turns with no Special Attack drop, while Overheats deals much more damage on the first turn and has slightly better accuracy. Earth Power will OHKO opposing Heatran that might try to nab a free Flash Fire boost, and Hidden Power Grass will 2HKO the majority of Water-types. For the last slot, Dragon Pulse and Flamethrower are both decent options to consider. Dragon Pulse can be used to eliminate Dragonite or Kingdra, both common switch-ins to Heatran, while Flamethrower deals consistent damage and also helps you sweep later in the game if you are using Overheat.</p> <p>While not as much of a team supporter as the other Heatran sets, Choice Specs Heatran is worth considering as a high powered special sweeper, and will greatly benefit most teams. The Speed EVs allows Heatran to outrun Jolly Tyranitar and Adamant Metagross. Max Special Attack is a must to deal as much damage as possible. Running a +Speed nature can be considered at the risk of some crucial 2HKOs, such as those on bulkier Water-types.</p> <p>This set, much like the Life Orb set, benefits from entry hazards to further weaken the opponent. Smeargle is a good choice to lay down both Spikes and Stealth Rock early in the game, also having access to Spore to cause further trouble for the opponent. At the very least, Stealth Rock should be used to guarantee a 2HKO on 4/0 Gyarados and Dragonite; Spikes, in turn, will make it easier to land KOs on Blissey and Water-types like Suicune.</p> <p>Individual Pokemon that pair well with this set are Rotom-A and Scizor. Rotom-A works well at taking out Water-types with its STAB Thunderbolt and respectable 105 base Special Attack stat, while Trick can be utilized to further incapacitate Blissey. Finally, Scizor is a great Pokemon to lure out Fire-type attacks which can nab Heatran a Flash Fire boost. Additionally, Scizor makes a great check to Dragonite and Gyarados (provided Scizor packs Quick Attack), both being threats this set must watch out for.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Torment",
        "description": "<p>Torment, combined with Heatran's impressive set of resistances and considerable bulk, turns Heatran into one of the toughest Pokemon to KO in the game. The idea behind this set is that not many Pokemon carry more than one attack powerful enough to break Heatran's Substitutes. With that in mind, Torment allows Heatran to stay safe by using Protect to prevent its opponent from breaking its Substitute with their STAB or super effective attack. That means that every other turn, Heatran can attack with Lava Plume for free without having to worry about being damaged. This set slowly chips away at Heatran's opponent while maintaining Heatran's Substitute at the end of the duel when they faint.</p> <p>Lava Plume is the move of choice on this set, due to its high PP and 30% burn rate. Many Heatran switch-ins (such as Gyarados, Tyranitar, and Swampert) do not like getting burned. The chance to burn also helps slowly drain the opponent's HP, meaning Heatran does not even have to attack. Instead, it can alternate between Substitute and Protect to rack up residual damage. Taunt is an interesting option over Lava Plume for dealing indirect damage. It prevents Pokemon from healing and forces them to attack Heatran's Substitutes in vain. When combined with Torment, Pokemon such as mono-attacking Blissey and Suicune will struggle every other turn, allowing Heatran to beat certain Pokemon that would otherwise completely counter it; however, Taunt also makes Heatran lose to other Pokemon which Heatran would normally be able to beat. In fact, any Pokemon with more than one attack, or a faster Pokemon with Taunt will be able to beat this set unless they are afflicted with a status condition.</p> <p>Although this set is effective on its own, with the proper team support it can single-handedly run through a team. If Heatran's teammates manage to set up two layers of Toxic Spikes before it comes in, Heatran (especially those with Taunt) will beat Blissey, Swampert, Vaporeon, Milotic, Porygon2, and other common switch-ins lacking Rest. This brings up the bane of this set: Rest + Sleep Talk stat uppers. Pokemon such as Suicune, Snorlax, Swampert, and Tyranitar running the aforementioned strategy can walk all over this Heatran. This is why it is suggested that this Heatran is partnered with a Choiced Trick supporter or two to prevent these set up Pokemon from beating it. On top of that, remember that any Choiced Pokemon will Struggle against Torment Tran, which makes Tricking a Choice item an all around superb support option for this set.</p> <p>The HP EVs allow Heatran to hit its highest Leftovers number, which is very important, considering Heatran will be seeing a lot of Leftovers recovery with this set. The Speed EVs bring Heatran to 244 Speed, beating Jolly Tyranitar at 243. Adding some Speed EVs may not be a bad idea, though, as that will let Heatran set up a Substitute up before being hit by Celebi's or Zapdos's Thunder Wave—something very important for this set. The Special Defense EVs allow Heatran to take 24% max from a neutral-natured, 0 Special Attack Rotom-A's Discharge, meaning they will never break its Substitute. This is important because Heatran really doesn't want to get randomly paralyzed from Discharge. The Special Attack EVs ensure that Heatran does a minimum of 33% to max HP Machamp, meaning that the Rest + Sleep Talk sets will be 3HKOed. Heatran also doesn't have to worry about Dynamic Punch thanks to Torment. Heatran always 3HKOes bulky Rotom-A, so not even the Rest + Sleep Talk versions can stop it.</p> <p>The three biggest non-Resting threats to this set are Gyarados, Swampert, and non-Choiced Heatran. The first two usually carry two moves that can break Heatran's Substitutes, while resisting Lava Plume. It is therefore recommended that Heatran be paired up with Celebi, which can handle Gyarados and Swampert. Also, the CeleTran combo is always great in terms of synergy. Tyranitar also makes a great support Pokemon for this set by providing it a reliable Heatran switch-in, while also setting up Sand Stream, which will chip away at opposing Pokemon without damaging Heatran.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Trapper",
        "description": "<p>The purpose of this Heatran is to trap your opponent's switch-in with Magma Storm and deal with it accordingly. This set is designed to eliminate most of Heatran's common counters, including Swampert, Blissey, and Dragonite. Magma Storm does not only force opposing Pokemon to stay in, but it deals 6.25% of extra damage at the end of every turn, allowing Heatran to do just enough damage to score KOs that it otherwise would not be able to. Much like other baiting sets, the purpose of HeaTrap is to help clear the way for other Pokemon to sweep later on by eliminating common counters. What separates this set from the pack is that once Heatran lands a Magma Storm, Heatran's opponent cannot switch out to scout if it is indeed a bait set or not; the KO is essentially guaranteed.</p> <p>With the given spread and nature, Swampert and Blissey cannot survive Hidden Power Grass or Explosion, respectively, after Magma Storm and Stealth Rock damage. With Shuca Berry, Heatran can also survive an Earthquake from the standard Swampert, Gliscor, and Hippowdon.</p> <p>The Speed EVs allow Heatran to outpace neutral-natured Scizor. Alternatively, a spread of 128 HP / 164 Def / 216 SpA may be used to guarantee that a max Attack Dragonite with Life Orb can never KO Heatran with Earthquake even after Stealth Rock damage. This spread makes for a slower Heatran but still guarantees the same KOs previously listed.</p> <p>If you are not concerned about Dragonite, which takes a hefty amount of damage switching into Magma Storm anyway, then you may want to consider Wide Lens over Shuca Berry. The biggest drawback to this set is obviously Magma Storm's poor accuracy, which can be somewhat alleviated with Wide Lens, giving it an effective accuracy of 77%. Passho Berry is also an effective item choice, as it allows Heatran to withstand blows from Starmie, Suicune, and other Water-type Pokemon, and KO back with Hidden Power Grass or Explosion.</p> <p>If you pack a powerful Pursuit user on your team, then you may also want to consider Taunt over Explosion. With Taunt and Magma Storm, Heatran can prevent Blissey from healing, switching, or using a status move. You can then switch in your Pursuit user to seal Blissey's fate without sacrificing Heatran. If eliminating Blissey is your main objective, then running Taunt with Explosion will guarantee a KO on Blissey, which can no longer Protect on your Explosion. Taunt also allows Heatran to beat some of its other counters, such as Vaporeon, which won't be able to heal anymore and takes a hefty hit from Hidden Power Grass. The biggest selling point of Taunt combined with Magma Storm, however, is that it allows you to switch in another sweeper and score a free boost as your Taunted opponent switches out, assuming they can't hurt your sweeper directly. Finally, if you do not pack a solid Heatran counter on your team, Earth Power is a great option for ensuring that enemy Heatran cannot come in for free. However, if you choose to use Earth Power, it is highly recommended that Shuca Berry be your item of choice, as you do not want to lose to an opposing Heatran's Earth Power.</p> <p>This Heatran set should be used primarily as a support Pokemon; it works very well on teams that have Pokemon that share the same counters as Heatran. Teammates that benefit from this Heatran set include Tyranitar and Dragonite, which enjoy the absence of Swampert. Offensive Suicune, offensive Zapdos, and Sub Petaya Empoleon are also excellent team options because they have a much easier time sweeping once Blissey is gone. You should also consider teammates that can take advantage of Tyranitar, Gyarados and Vaporeon, which are the three most common Heatran counters that this set cannot reliably deal with. Gliscor serves as a great Tyranitar check that also has an easy time switching into Fighting- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Heatran, and Celebi and Vaporeon do an excellent job at covering Gyarados and Vaporeon. It is also recommended that you set Stealth Rock up before getting this Heatran out, as it nets a lot of kills with the extra damage that Stealth Rock provides. If you are looking for a purely offensive Heatran, then other sets might prove more effective. However, when it comes to taking out the threats mentioned, no Pokemon does a better job than HeaTrap.</p> "

        "name": "RestTalk",
        "description": "<p>While Heatran lacks any form of recovery outside of Rest, its large number of resistances and above average defenses makes it an excellent status absorber and special wall. Typically, it would be better to choose a special sponge that has access to instant recovery, but Heatran is sturdy enough that it doesn't matter. On top of that, its huge Special Attack stat makes it a difficult wall to switch into. With Heatran's decent typing and good defenses it can easily take on special attackers such as Celebi, Rotom-A, Jirachi, Zapdos, and many others. With the help from Lava Plume's Burn and Earth Power's Special Defense drop, this set can even beat Blissey one-on-one, which most other Heatran cannot claim.</p> <p>Lava Plume makes physical attackers think twice before switching in, as a 30% burn rate is nothing to scoff at. Fire Blast, on the other hand, carries significantly more raw power, and Sleep Talk makes Fire Blast's low PP a non-issue. However, since this is a defensive set, Lava Plume is still the primary option because it provides better team support. Earth Power has excellent coverage with Lava Plume, hitting Fire- and Rock-types that resist it. Additionally, if this Heatran is on a team with Spikes support, Roar makes a great option over Earth Power. Because of its large number of resistances, Roar makes it extremely difficult to take Heatran out, as opponents are forced to rely on luck of the draw to bring out something to deal with Heatran. While asleep, Heatran also loses the negative priority of Roar if it happens to select it with Sleep Talk, allowing it to \"speed shuffle.\"</p> <p>A more offensive spin on the Rest + Sleep Talk set is achieved by changing to Timid nature, using an EV spread of 248 HP/ 36 SpA / 224 Spe, and giving Heatran a Life Orb. This outruns Adamant Heracross. This variation functions as a sweeper by giving Heatran back its monstrous Special Attack and decent Speed, and at the same time retaining the ability to shrug off status and heal itself. Note that Fire Blast should be used in this case, as the extra power is significant.</p> <p>This set has trouble against Pokemon that resist the combination of Fire and Ground, which includes, but is not limited to, Flygon, Dragonite, and Gyarados. As such, Suicune makes a decent partner to this set for her ability to take on all three of the noted Pokemon, to some extent. Particularly, a Suicune with Ice Beam and Hidden Power Electric works best here, as it survives attacks from even Dragonite and Gyarados with +1 Attack while packing enough power to OHKO both.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes support also works decently with this set to further make use of Heatran's durability. Mainly, Toxic Spikes should be considered to eliminate Water-types which wall this set entirely, while even allowing Heatran to outstall Blissey and cause havoc to Pokemon immune to Toxic Spikes with Lava Plume's 30% burn rate. Roserade is a good candidate for laying down Toxic Spikes which also packs a handy resist to Heatran's weakness to Water-type attacks.</p> "

        "name": "Metal Sound",
        "description": "<p>Combine base 130 Special Attack, 120 Base Power Fire Blast, and the Special Defense-reducing Metal Sound, and Heatran becomes an extremely potent threat in the OU metagame. With Metal Sound, Heatran can combat Pokemon that it otherwise cannot, such as Blissey, Tyranitar, and bulky Water-types. Because of this, Heatran can more effectively threaten its common switch-ins, making it harder to check.</p> <p>After taking a Metal Sound, even Pokemon that resist Fire Blast will take huge amounts of damage. Earth Power and Hidden Power Grass are used for type coverage. The former hits Tyranitar and opposing Heatran, while the latter hits Water-types that constantly shut down Heatran. It should be noted that the majority of Tyranitar hold Choice Scarf, so take caution if you decide to stay in and go for the kill. In OU, only Dragonite resists this combination of moves; however, if Heatran is able to hit it with Fire Blast after a Metal Sound, it is in for a deadly surprise.</p> <p>Below are several damage calculations demonstrating the power Timid Heatran's Life Orb-boosted attacks have against threatening opponents hit by Metal Sound.</p> <ul> <li>Fire Blast vs 0 HP / 0 SpD Rash Dragonite: 87.3% - 103.1% <li>Fire Blast vs 0 HP / 0 SpD Jolly Dragonite: 79% - 93%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs 24 HP / 232 SpD Calm Blissey: 46% - 54%</li> <li>Earth Power vs 160 HP / 0 SpD Adamant Tyranitar: 89% - 100%</li> <li>Hidden Power Grass vs 188 HP / 0 SpD Bold Vaporeon: 92% - 100%</li> <li>Hidden Power Grass vs 252 HP / 0 SpD Bold Suicune: 87% - 100%</li> </ul> <p>The strategy to using this set effectively is to switch Heatran in on a Pokemon that it can threaten instantly, such as Rotom-A or Jirachi, and use Metal Sound while your opponent switches out. Once that has been accomplished, proceed to hit the switch-in with the most appropriate attack.</p> <p>Although Heatran can hit hard after using Metal Sound, it usually will not obtain the KO, as some of its common counters, such as Starmie and offensive Suicune, will outspeed and threaten it. In order to remedy this situation, Heatran can use a Passho Berry so it can withstand a Water-type attack before securing the KO. Dropping some of its Speed EVs for HP EVs gives it enough bulk to withstand these Water-type attacks; an ideal spread to use would be Modest and 88 HP / 252 SpA / 168 Spe. This spread allows Heatran to survive a Timid Life Orb Hydro Pump from Starmie and easily KO back with Hidden Power Grass off of its --2 Special Defense from Metal Sound. Heatran also withstands a Hydro Pump from offensive Suicune and OHKOes it with Hidden Power Grass after Stealth Rock damage and sandstorm in play. Heatran can also outspeed CroCune and 2HKO it. Furthermore, this spread is fast enough to outrun max Speed Adamant Scizor and most Magnezone. Although the suggested spread provides a decent amount of bulk for mid-game survivability, there are other options that can be used. You could opt to use 224 Speed EVs to outspeed defensive Zapdos, defensive Celebi, non-Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and neutral-nature 36 Speed Jirachi; however, you could opt for more bulk and simply settle for outrunning CroCune, which would require a mere investment of 80 Speed EVs.</p> <p>Since Heatran appreciates the use of lures to bring in Pokemon that it can set up on, that should be taken into account when using this. Jirachi is a great lure for Rotom-A, allowing Heatran to come in without much worry and gain a potential Flash Fire Boost from Will-O-Wisp or, in Rotom-H's case, Overheat. Another great teammate to use is Gengar, which can lure in Choice Scarf Jirachi and Choice Band Scizor. Entry hazard support is also strongly recommended as it helps Heatran score the needed KOs that it otherwise could not achieve, such as against Dragonite. Metal Sound also tends to force switches, racking up entry hazard damage on the opponent. Swampert makes a great Stealth Rock supporter with its overall bulk, and it also lures in Grass-types, such as Celebi, which Heatran can take advantage of. Skarmory is one of the most reliable Spikes users in the OU metagame, making it a prime candidate for setting them up. It also attracts Fire-type attacks and Rotom-A, which Heatran can switch into without much fear.</p> "

        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<p>This set focuses more on Heatran's decent bulk and unique typing instead of its offensive power. As such, this Heatran is best used on teams with a stall-based approach. Although Heatran lacks an instant recovery move, which is usually preferred on a special sponge, it is sturdy enough to take a couple of special hits. Besides, Heatran's base 130 Special Attack stat makes it a very difficult Pokemon to switch into, even without EV investment.</p> <p>Lava Plume is Heatran's preferred attack move, as it has high PP and a 30% chance to burn the opponent, which is always beneficial for specially defensive Pokemon. Flamethrower is also an option due to its higher Base Power. Earth Power is a great move to use alongside Heatran's STAB move as it provides decent coverage, especially against opposing Heatran trying to obtain a Flash Fire boost. Protect has two functions: it allows Heatran to scout Choice users, reducing the need for prediction, and it gives it an additional turn for Leftovers recovery, while in the meantime letting your opponent take extra residual damage. Roar is another useful move on this set, especially with entry hazard support. Heatran forces a lot of switches, so phazing your opponent's team will cause even more residual damage. Roar also allows you to scout your opponent's team.</p> <p>Below are some damage calculations which effectively portray Heatran's amazing special bulk:</p> <ul> <li>Choice Scarf Heatran Earth Power - 70.5% - 83.9%</li> <li>Choice Scarf Shaymin Earth Power - 59.1% - 70.5%</li> <li>Life Orb Shaymin Earth Power - 76.7% - 91.2%</li> <li>Life Orb Gengar Focus Blast - 61.1% - 72%</li> <li>Life Orb Jolteon HP Fighting - 31.6% - 37.3%</li> <li>Choice Specs Jolteon Thunderbolt - 37.3% - 43.8%</li> </ul> <p>An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 156 SpD / 100 Spe is usable, and a Calm nature will still give Heatran decent defensive capabilities, while the extra Speed allows it to outrun Rotom-A that run no Speed EVs. With this spread, Heatran can take out weakened versions before they can hit it.</p> <p>Heatran has a huge number of support moves it can utilize. Either Toxic or Will-O-Wisp can easily fit over Protect or Roar. Take note that if you decide to use Will-O-Wisp, Flamethrower should be your main offensive move. Stealth Rock is an option on Heatran as well if you desperately need someone to lay it down. Taunt is also useful, and can find its way into this Heatran's moveset. Taunt almost completely shuts down opposing stall teams and prevents status moves from being used on Heatran and its teammates. Rest provides Heatran with a somewhat reliable recovery move, but two turns of sleep is a letdown, and makes Heatran setup fodder for a variety of Pokemon.</p> <p>Offensively, Heatran also has access to a variety of useful moves. Fire Blast or Overheat can be used if you want a more powerful STAB move, but on a defensive Pokemon like this Heatran variant, a reliable move with decent PP is preferred over sheer power. Using Dragon Pulse instead of Earth Power can help against Dragonite and Flygon that are locked into Outrage. Hidden Power Electric and Hidden Power Grass can also help against Gyarados and Swampert, respectively.</p> <p>Since this is a defensive variant of Heatran, Toxic Spikes are greatly appreciated. A Rapid Spin user is also nice, as Heatran needs as much HP as possible to maintain its defensive capabilities. Forretress does both of these things while also luring Fire-type moves so that Heatran can get a safe switch-in, making Forretress a great teammate. Since Heatran lacks a reliable recovery move, Wish support is a good idea. Vaporeon and Blissey can do this, but, in Blissey's case, watch out for the shared weakness to Fighting-type moves. RestTalk Roar Gyarados also makes a great teammate as it covers Heatran's weaknesses quite well, while its Intimidate also helps in covering Heatran's weaker Defense.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Cresselia has outstanding overall defenses that allow her to wall many attacks, and with access to Calm Mind, she has the potential to be a potent end-game cleaner. However, she has many exploitable weaknesses. Firstly, the prevalence of sandstorm severely limits her healing capabilities. Secondly, three of her counters--Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Heatran--are the most popular Pokemon in the metagame. Therefore, she requires significantly more team support than most Pokemon to work properly. Cresselia can also be a dedicated support slot for her teammates by employing a dual screens strategy.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute can be used in conjunction with Calm Mind, Psychic, and Moonlight as an alternative bulky setup sweeper set. Clefable will have much more difficult when facing this set, as it cannot remove Cresselia's item through a Substitute, and Seismic Toss fails to break it as well. This set requires a tremendous amount of support from Dugtrio, Magnezone, and a weather clearer to work effectively, which is often asking for a bit too much support.</p> <p>Cresselia can use an offensive set with Calm Mind and 3 attacks, either Psychic, Grass Knot, and Hidden Power Fire or Psychic, Hidden Power Electric, and Ice Beam. Grass Knot is fantastic against bulky Water-types and is especially effective versus Swampert. Hidden Power Electric and Ice Beam are good versus Pokemon like Dragonite, Gyarados, and Latias. These sets generally have a difficult time sweeping compared to a bulkier Calm Mind variant, however.</p> <p>A RestTalk set with Charge Beam and Ice Beam can be used as an alternative to boosting its Special Attack without Calm Mind while also having BoltBeam coverage, but this set isn't very reliable and is not as effective at cleaning late-game as a Calm Mind set is.</p> <p>A Choice Scarf set with Trick, Psychic, Ice Beam, and Lunar Dance has some potential, but other Choice Scarf users are more reliable revenge killers, since Cresselia's Special Attack is quite lacking.</p> <p>Psycho Shift + Flame Orb can debilitate Cresselia's counters; in particular, a set of Rest, Sleep Talk, Psycho Shift, and Solar Beam can cripple Jirachi and Tyranitar with sleep or a burn. This set can also sponge Trick and pass a Flame Orb to the opponent in the process. However, this set is extremely passive. Solar Beam is used because Sleep Talk cannot summon it, giving Cresselia a 50% chance to pass sleep.</p> <p>Toxic is an option to slowly whittle foes down; Skill Swap can be used in conjunction with Toxic to target Clefable, but it has no means of preventing Clefable from switching out, so it's gimmicky overall.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Tyranitar: Tyranitar is the main way to beat Cresselia due to its strong Dark-type Pursuit and Crunch, summoning Sandstorm to reduce Moonlight's effectiveness, and having the ability to switch in safely even if it's chipped quite a bit.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Jirachi can induce flinches on Cresselia with Iron Head or use Trick to give it a Choice Scarf. Metagross and Bronzong can use powerful Steel-type attacks or even Explosion to make quick work of Cresselia. Heatran can use Magma Storm to trap Cresselia and either remove it with Explosion or use Taunt to prevent it from setting up and healing.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Clefable: Blissey can switch into Cresselia and use Seismic Toss to slowly wear it down if it doesn't carry Rest, or fish for a freeze with Ice Beam. Clefable can remove Cresselia's item with Knock Off, use Encore to disrupt its setup, and use Seismic Toss to wear it down as well; Calm Mind sets also have high odds to beat Cresselia in a Calm Mind war. Both of these Pokemon have very high Special bulk, so they can easily switch into any of Cresselia's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types:</strong> Gengar has STAB Shadow Ball, which does a ton of damage to Cresselia, and it can even set up Substitute on sets that lack Psychic. Rotom-A can Trick a Choice Scarf or use its own STAB Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types: Scizor can maim Cresselia with its powerful U-turn and Bug Bite, or even use Pursuit if it tries to flee. Although rarer, Heracross can hit Cresselia with STAB Megahorn for large amounts of damage.</p> <p><strong>Hippowdon: Hippowdon can summon Sandstorm to disrupt Cresselia, phaze it with Roar, or fish for a freeze with Ice Fang.</p> <p><strong>Taunt users:</strong> Gliscor, Heatran, Gyarados, and Gengar can use Taunt to prevent Cresselia from setting up, greatly reducing its effectiveness.</p> ",

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With Cresselia's astronomical bulk but mediocre Special Attack, a Calm Mind set suits Cresselia to a T. Psychic is Cresselia's best STAB move and is used versus most non-Steel-types. In addition to Psychic, Hidden Power Fire is Cresselia's recommended coverage move to turn the tide versus Scizor and 2HKO even the bulkiest variants almost all the time; it's also useful to hit other Steel-types like Jirachi, Metagross, and Bronzong as hard as possible. As an alternative, Hidden Power Fighting is Cresselia's best option versus Tyranitar, Heatran, and Empoleon, and it also hits all Steel-types for neutral damage at minimum. Ice Beam is very useful for taking on Dragon-types like Dragonite, Latias, and Flygon; it's also useful for Gliscor, which can use Taunt to prevent Cresselia from boosting with Calm Mind and remove its item with Knock Off.</p> <p>Sleep Talk is a non-attacking option that combines with Rest to make Cresselia less passive, but it replaces Cresselia's coverage move, so it will require significantly more support. Rest is Cresselia's most consistent form of recovery because its bulk allows it to burn off its sleep turns consistently. Moonlight is an alternative to Rest that doesn't force Cresselia to sleep, but it has reduced effectiveness in all forms of weather except sun, and Rest's higher PP increases Cresselia's capabilities in a PP war. Overall, Moonlight can leave Cresselia more effective offensively, but it mandates more support, and its low PP limits it tremendously.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment gives Cresselia as much general bulk as possible, while 40 Special Attack EVs allow it to always OHKO standard Choice Band Scizor with Hidden Power Fire after one Calm Mind boost and Stealth Rock damage, as well as 2HKO bulky Swords Dance Scizor over 90% of the time without any boost at all. As an added bonus, Cresselia can 2HKO offensive Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragon Dance Dragonite with a +1 Psychic after Stealth Rock damage. 80 EVs in Special Defense ease entry into Latias, specifically maximizing Cresselia's chance to take two Draco Meteors from Modest Choice Specs variants from full. 16 Speed EVs enable Cresselia to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Machamp and potentially get the jump on bulky Suicune and RestTalk Rotom-A. If it's using Hidden Power Fighting, an EV spread of 252 HP / 108 Def / 80 SpD / 68 Spe enables Cresselia to outpace all Tyranitar with a neutral nature. With Ice Beam, an EV spread of 252 HP / 140 Def / 20 SpA / 80 SpD / 16 Spe fits best; with the Special Attack investment, Cresselia can OHKO Flygon after two rounds of Stealth Rock damage. Leftovers keeps Cresselia as healthy as possible through passive recovery at the end of each turn, which plays a vital role in allowing Cresselia to clean late-game.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Cresselia is most effective when revealed late-game after all its checks have been weakened or removed; if it's revealed haphazardly, your opponent can much more easily prevent it from cleaning later on. Use your other Pokemon to try to damage Steel-types and Tyranitar as much as possible. Scout the opposing team and determine what's stopping Cresselia to come up with a solid gameplan. If Cresselia is revealed early—whether a phazing move forces it in or it's needed for its defensive value—use its massive bulk to your advantage by pivoting in and double switching to another Pokemon to potentially gain a positional advantage. Furthermore, try to stay as healthy as possible, and avoid using Rest unless absolutely necessary because a myriad of setup Pokemon like Dragonite, Gyarados, and Metagross can easily take advantage of a sleeping Cresselia with no boosts. Try to avoid staying in versus Pokemon with Knock Off like Clefable and Gliscor, as without Leftovers, Cresselia has a much harder time setting up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cresselia has a difficult time versus some of the more prominent Pokemon like Tyranitar, Jirachi, Heatran, and Metagross, so it requires quite a bit of support compared to most Pokemon. Unless you opt for Hidden Power Fighting, Dugtrio is almost completely mandatory to trap and remove Tyranitar; it can also remove most variants of Jirachi, Heatran, Metagross, and, with Pursuit, even Gengar, which can threaten Cresselia with its powerful Shadow Ball. Weather setters like Rain Dance Kingdra and Rain Dance Latias work well with Cresselia to clear sand, which is useful for both Moonlight and Rest, making Cresselia much more difficult to take down; without sand, Moonlight will heal a greater amount of HP, and it will be easier for Cresselia to take hits while asleep with passive recovery at the end of each turn. Will-O-Wisp Rotom-A can bait in Tyranitar and also take advantage of Dugtrio's support; it walls Metagross, and by spreading burns, it enables Cresselia to set up more easily on physical attackers. Bulky Pokemon with Toxic like Heatran, Bronzong, and Magnezone support Cresselia well by spreading poison to foes like Zapdos, Rotom-A, Tyranitar, Swampert, and Latias. Heatran with Special Defense investment can ward off Rotom-A and Jirachi, and it can even gain a Flash Fire boost from a potential Will-O-Wisp. Bronzong does quite well versus Metagross and Jirachi and can hold its ground often versus Tyranitar. Magnezone can trap Steel-types like Jirachi and Bronzong that Cresselia dislikes facing, especially if it uses Sleep Talk over a coverage move. Toxic Spikes are effective at supporting Cresselia, so Nidoqueen and Roserade are also good pairings; Nidoqueen checks Tyranitar quite well, and Roserade can threaten Swampert, which can often be a nuisance if it packs Roar. If you're using Dugtrio alongside Cresselia, Pokemon with U-turn like Choice Scarf Jirachi and Choice Scarf Flygon are good teammates to bring Dugtrio in safely, and they also fulfill the role of a revenge killer. Blissey has great defensive synergy with Cresselia, and it can play the role of a cleric, which can assist Rest Cresselia quite well.</p> "

        "name": "Dual Screens",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Due to Cresselia's enormous bulk, she can easily set up Reflect and Light Screen multiple times to assist your team. She also has one more trick that other dual screen supporters don't: Lunar Dance. As Cresselia's secret weapon, this move lets her sacrifice herself to allow another Pokemon to come in fully healed and cured of any status ailments it might have. All these combine to let Cresselia assist one of your remaining Pokemon in setting up and sweeping the opponent's team. Few teams can handle assaults from the same threatening sweeper twice over, which can secure the game for your team.</p> <p>Thunder Wave gives Cresselia more time to set up screens, while Ice Beam handles Dragon-types such as Dragonite, as well as Gliscor, who is a common mid-game Taunt user. As an alternative, Psychic provides STAB and a way to take out Infernape.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The listed EV spread helps Cresselia better sponge attacks. Specifically, the defensive investment lets her survive the 2HKO from Choice Band Tyranitar's Crunch after Reflect, Stealth Rock, and one turn of sandstorm damage. The 68 Speed EVs ensure that Cresselia outspeeds Choice Band Tyranitar and Swords Dance Scizor, which allows her to set up Reflect before being hit by Crunch or Bug Bite, respectively. The remaining EVs go into Special Defense to better take special attacks. Light Clay extends the duration of Reflect and Light Screen to make Cresselia a better team supporter.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Since Cresselia has the potential to set up Light Screen and Reflect multiple times, take advantage of this by first doing it in the early game, hopefully after Stealth Rock is up. Use Thunder Wave against common switch-ins like Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Heatran. Try to conceal Ice Beam, as the opponent may reveal a Gliscor, which will likely use Taunt to try preventing Light Screen and Reflect from going up. Pivot Cresselia into suspected Choice item holders like Flygon and Heatran, and try to punish a bad lock like a Ground-type attack.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Plenty of Pokemon appreciate dual screens; however, there are a few that pair especially well with Cresselia. Lucario and Tyranitar can capitalize on the Dark-type moves that your opponent will likely launch at Cresselia to bring her down. Other Dragon Dance sweepers like Dragonite and Gyarados appreciate dual screens because they can compensate for their weakness to Stealth Rock. Substitute + Calm Mind Pokemon like Suicune and Jirachi can take huge advantage of dual screens because their Substitutes will be much more difficult to break. Agility Metagross becomes very difficult to take down under screens and is a potent late-game cleaner.</p> "

  "Kakuna": {
    "overview": "<p>Kakuna is still one of the most interesting Bugs out there. I expect it to be UnderUsed for a while as people drool over sweepers like Scizor and Azelf, and then returned to as people go back for the old reliable standards. Overall, Kakuna hasn't changed much, but it didn't really need to. That said, it got a few new toys in terms of moves and items. Expect to see Kakuna work the same way it did in ADV.</p> <p>With Kakuna's new move Bug Bite, it's justifiable that it has moved up to the NFE (Notoriously Freaking Epic) tier. (Seriously, who thinks of the names for these tiers, anyway?) With this new, extremely useful move under its shell, Kakuna has the ability to effectively shape its tier to its personal needs.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Kakuna's movepool is rather shallow; however, it still has a couple different choices. A Lum Berry can be used should Kakuna accidentally switch into Hypnosis. Type-resist Berries can also be useful. The big three that will help Kakuna are Charti, Coba, and Occa. Charti will reduce damage inflicted from Rock-type attacks, Coba the same with Flying, while Occa will do the trick for Fire. Occa is most helpful when considering the widespread usage of Heatran and Infernape. Rock- and Flying-type attacks are much less common.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Parasect can kill it, but it has to be careful switching in because of Bug Bite and Poison Sting. Farfetch'd resists its moves, but can be walled by Iron Defense. Thief Banette with Frisk also causes some problems by selectively stealing items while snatching away Kakuna's Iron Defenses.</p> <p>Steelix and Steel-type Arceus, although somewhat manageable thanks to Bug Bite, still cause problems for our cocooned friend. Other Steel-types, such as Dialga, give Kakuna issues. Luckily, the Steel / Psychic-typed Pokemon are neutral to Bug-type attacks, meaning that Kakuna can ravage them with a powerful STAB Bug Bite.</p> ",

Black Sludge is an option to not only heal Kakuna, but to help ward off use of Trick or Covet. It is important to note, however, that if you opt for Black Sludge, your opponent can cripple one of your other teammates by Tricking it on to them.</p> <p>The given EVs provide a good balance between offense and defense, as well as allowing Kakuna to take physical hits quite well.</p> "},

  "Machamp": {
    "overview": "<p>Machamp is perhaps the most frustrating Pokemon to face in all of DPP OU. His unique ability, No Guard, a gigantic base 130 Attack stat, and a 100% accurate Dynamic Punch ensure Machamp's position among the best of the tier. A perfectly accurate Stone Edge alongside Payback and the elemental punches rounds out Machamp's type coverage and make him a force to be reckoned with. Little can stand up to Machamp's onslaught for long and oftentimes the only way to bring him down is to sacrifice one of your own Pokemon.</p> <p>For all of the strength Machamp possesses, he is a slow creature with only modest defenses. Machamp doesn't provide defensive value for its team unless it's a bulky RestTalk variant, so it can be difficult to fit it onto teams sometimes. Despite the fact that almost nothing can OHKO Machamp, virtually every offensive Pokemon can 2HKO him with a neutral STAB attack. Machamp always poses the greatest threat to a team when he is just out of KO range for what he comes in on. Once sufficiently weakened, though, Machamp tends to serve as little more than a speed bump for most Pokemon with his low Speed stat.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Outside of the listed options for each set, Machamp actually has a fairly shallow movepool with just enough tricks to surprise people. Bulk Up can be used to boost its Attack and Defense, but Machamp often doesn't have the bulk nor the opportunities in battle to effectively use it. Fire Blast is an option because it hits Skarmory and Forretress quite hard, though it will not 2HKO Skarmory or OHKO Forretress without some EV investment. It's worth noting that No Guard makes Fire Blast never miss, which is a perk.</p> <p>Machamp has some novel supporting options that can be used to decent effect as well. Encore in the lead position can be frustrating for your opponent, and can be used against Stealth Rock users like Swampert and Hippowdon. Toxic can also be used to reasonable effect on Machamp thanks to No Guard allowing it never to miss. Beyond those few moves, though, there's almost nothing else worth noting. Guts can be used on any set over No Guard, with options such as Low Kick and Close Combat available for Machamp to use. No Guard is basically superior for every set that has it listed, though, as the value of Dynamic Punch's confusion generally far exceeds the benefits of having Guts.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Machamp has no true counters that see much use in DPP OU. Between Dynamic Punch's confusion and Machamp's near-perfect type coverage with two moves, practically nothing enjoys switching into him. The best responses to Machamp are bulky Ghost- and Flying-type Pokemon that can take a hit and retaliate in some manner. Rotom-A immediately springs to mind as the #1 Ghost-type to take on Machamp. Machamp can 2HKO defensive Rotom-A, but will take serious damage in doing so, and with proper prediction may even lose. Gyarados can switch into Machamp with Intimidate and can even setup on him, but confusion can get in the way of this plan. Zapdos functions in a similar fashion to Gyarados, but with greater bulk and no Intimidate. Pressure will rapidly deplete Dynamic Punch's 8 PP, though, and can be very problematic for a reckless Machamp. Roost makes Zapdos a more reliable check to Machamp over the course of the battle than Gyarados, and since both are weak to Stealth Rock, Pokemon such as Forretress, who can take a hit and get rid of Stealth Rock, work well against Machamp. Forretress can also Explode on Machamp once he has done his job.</p> <p>A few UU Pokemon function as near-perfect Machamp responses, despite their low usage. Slowbro can take on Machamp very effectively thanks to Own Tempo, a resistance to Fighting-type attacks, and immense physical bulk. Similarly, Spiritomb is reasonably bulky, immune to Fighting-type attacks, and neutral to Payback; as with Zapdos, Spiritomb's Pressure will quickly deplete Dynamic Punch's PP. Slowbro threatens Machamp with STAB Psychic, while Spiritomb can either attack or burn Machamp.</p> ",

        "name": "Attacking Lead",
        "description": "<p>With this set, Machamp functions as the premier attacking lead of the OU metagame. Machamp's unique mix of confusion, respectable bulk, access to priority, and excellent type coverage come together to force innumerable switches. Machamp nearly always either KOes or immensely weakens an opponent before he is forced out or KOed in return.</p> <p>100% accurate Dynamic Punch is the backbone of this set and is why Machamp is so annoying and potent as a lead. Leads weak to Fighting, such as Heatran and Tyranitar, are beaten outright, while even defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Swampert will be rendered useless 50% of the time by confusion. Payback gives Machamp nearly perfect coverage with Dynamic Punch and lets him 2HKO Colbur Berry Azelf. It also serves an important role when a Ghost-type Pokemon inevitably switches in to take Dynamic Punch, beating offensive Rotom-A and Gengar with ease. Bullet Punch is a useful priority move to finish off foes with Focus Sash like Empoleon and Roserade. Ice Punch is the last move of choice so that lead Dragonite and Gliscor don't have free reign over Machamp, and it's also Machamp's best option against Roserade. Stone Edge can be used instead of Bullet Punch or Ice Punch to beat Gyarados switch-ins as well as to have a stronger attack to use against Zapdos.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is used to boost Machamp's already stellar Attack stat. Focus Sash is the item of choice for this set, enabling Machamp to survive strong attacks from the likes of Heatran, Metagross, Starmie, Azelf, and Latias. Attack and Speed are maximized to make Machamp as strong and as fast as possible; the Speed EVs allow it to get the jump on slower variants of Machamp, Metagross, Swampert, Milotic, and Skarmory. Lum Berry is an alternative item that prevents status from Will-O-Wisp Rotom, Sleep Powder Roserade, and even Spore Smeargle.</p> <p>Leads like Metagross, Skarmory, Colbur Berry Azelf, and Jirachi can give Machamp some trouble. For this and other reasons, Shuca Berry Heatran makes one of the best partners to this set. Heatran sets up Stealth Rock reliably, covers both of Machamp's weaknesses, and can immediately threaten Metagross leads with Fire Blast. It can be valuable to take advantage of alternative Azelf sets by having Tyranitar as a partner to switch into Azelf. It is generally important to place Machamp on teams that need to secure offensive momentum early in the game by forcing the opponent to choose between sacrificing a Pokemon's HP or setting up early entry hazards. For this reason, Pokemon that take advantage of either the absence of entry hazards or weakened defensive Pokemon are excellent partners. Dragon Dance Dragonite and Tyranitar greatly benefit from the pressure Machamp can put on Swampert, for example. Similarly, if Machamp can eliminate or severely weaken Rotom-A, Pokemon that take advantage of its absence, such as Swords Dance Lucario and Dragon Dance Gyarados, will fare much better.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + 3 Attacks",
        "description": "<p>Machamp forces innumerable switches when he comes into play, and these switches can be taken advantage of with Substitute. The threat of Machamp's powerful Dynamic Punch lures in Ghost-types, such as Rotom-A, which will be put in a very awkward position by Substitute. It can no longer burn Machamp and runs a very serious risk of being KOed if it tries to break the Substitute. This is a very common outcome when a player is put against a Substitute Machamp; they must sacrifice a Pokemon in order to actually force him out.</p> <p>Substitute defines this set, with perfect-accuracy Dynamic Punch and Payback providing mandatory near-perfect coverage. Stone Edge is recommended in the last slot to provide the best super effective coverage for Machamp. Ice Punch is only useful if you're particularly worried about Gliscor, as otherwise Stone Edge achieves all of the necessary KOs, such as against Gyarados, Dragonite, and Zapdos.</p> <p>Adamant, as usual, is used to provide Machamp a significant boost to his Attack stat, while the EVs are chosen to maximize Attack, bulk up the Substitute's HP, and to outpace 0 Speed Skarmory. Leftovers restores some of Machamp's HP that is spent setting up Substitutes and is favored over Lum Berry because Substitute blocks status.</p> <p>Good partners for this Machamp are those that can weaken Machamp's typical switch-ins so that he can finish them off. Heatran is a very good partner to this Machamp, as he can destroy Skarmory and is immune to two of the status effects that Machamp doesn't like once his Substitute is broken. Choice Band Tyranitar also makes an excellent wallbreaker to pair with this Machamp, as not even the mighty Skarmory can avoid a 2HKO from his STAB Stone Edge. This Machamp also appreciates paralysis support so that he can outspeed opponents and even attempt a sweep. Paralysis also doubles with Dynamic Punch's confusion to make it even more difficult for the opponent to move. Substitute + Thunder Wave Jirachi makes an excellent partner with its ability to lure and paralyze Pokemon such as Heatran, whom Machamp would love to be able to hit with his attacks.</p> "

        "name": "RestTalk",
        "description": "<p>Machamp makes an excellent status absorber and general tank with his respectable bulk, immense type coverage, and ability to force a number of switches with his raw power alone. Dynamic Punch is one of the most prominent reasons why this set is as viable as it is, because the 50% chance for opponents to hit themselves can give Machamp free turns to use Rest and heal off any damage he's taken.</p> <p>Rest and Sleep Talk are standard fare on a RestTalk set. Sleep Talk is especially useful when used in conjunction with the low-PP Dynamic Punch, as it will use its own PP instead of the actual attacking move's. Payback is arguably the best second attack, as it hits Rotom-A and other Ghost-types super effectively and also rounds out Machamp's type coverage. Ice Punch and Stone Edge can be used as well, however, so that Machamp does not become setup fodder for Gliscor and Gyarados / Zapdos.</p> <p>The EV spread is very simple, maximizing Machamp's HP and Attack stats with 4 EVs invested into Speed to beat 0 Speed Blissey. An alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 16 Atk / 240 Def can be used in order to take on the less common Choice Band Tyranitar with ease, but at the cost of a lot of offensive power. This Machamp uses Leftovers to add to his durability over time and an Adamant nature to make his attacks sting as much as possible. Guts is a viable alternative to No Guard on this set because Machamp is putting himself to sleep, guaranteeing the Guts boost. If Guts is chosen, Low Kick becomes the attack of choice for hitting most of the tier relatively hard and having a lot of PP. No Guard is generally superior to Guts, however, because without Dynamic Punch's confusion, Machamp becomes setup bait for numerous common OU threats.</p> <p>The secondary move choice determines teammates for this Machamp. Without Payback, Rotom-A will be a thorn in Machamp's side, so strong Pursuit users, such as Tyranitar and Scizor, will help. Without Stone Edge, Zapdos and Gyarados will have their way with this Machamp. Tyranitar, again, as well as Starmie, will help keep these Pokemon at bay. Lastly, Ice Punch allows you to function against Zapdos and Gliscor, but leaves you vulnerable to Gyarados. Vaporeon, Starmie, or offensive Suicune can be useful here to deal with Gyarados while retaining momentum.</p> "

  "Tentacruel": {
    "overview": "<p>Tentacruel's great Special Defense, Speed, and Water typing give it a niche as a solid check to special Water- and Fire-types. Tentacruel critically has access to Rapid Spin, and it's a grounded Poison type, letting it absorb Toxic Spikes upon switch-in, which separates it from the other prominent Water-type spinner of the tier, Starmie. In addition, Tentacruel's unique mix of utility moves, such as its own Toxic Spikes and Knock Off, make it a very appealing choice for stall teams and further differentiates it from Starmie. Knock Off is especially valuable, as it reduces Tentacruel's passivity by crippling bulkier Pokemon and Choice item users; it also complements Toxic Spikes, as bulkier Pokemon tend to run Leftovers, which would otherwise mitigate the poison damage. Tentacruel's Poison typing gives it an important resistance to Fighting, letting it check Fighting-types with Grass-type coverage such as Breloom and Infernape, as they typically lack the options to hit it super effectively.</p> <p>However, Tentacruel is still a rare sight in OU with fairly fringe viability. Despite having Knock Off, Tentacruel is fairly passive due to its mediocre Special Attack stat and struggles to damage the main spinblocker of the tier: Rotom-A. It's also weak to the omnipresent Earthquake, meaning it can't check powerful physical attackers such as Flygon, Swampert, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Dragon Dance Dragonite, unlike most other defensive Water-types. In addition, many common defensive Pokemon Tentacruel would want to spin or set up Toxic Spikes on can potentially 2HKO it, such as Gliscor, Hippowdon, Quagsire, and Rotom-A. Above all, Tentacruel's low physical bulk, lack of recovery, and crucial vulnerability to Spikes and sand mean it struggles to safely get in and actually utilize its support movepool. Even resisted attacks such as Breloom's Focus Punch and Gyarados's boosted Waterfall can 2HKO it after entry hazard damage. Tentacruel has high base Speed, but it needs all the bulk investment it can get, so it is commonly outsped and then KOed by strong attackers. While the other viable Rapid Spin users, Starmie, Forretress, and Donphan, don't clear Toxic Spikes upon switching in, their longevity is significantly better; the former has reliable recovery and Natural Cure to stave off status, while Forretress and Donphan are immune to sand and much more physically bulky. Additionally, the ability to absorb and set up Toxic Spikes isn't hugely valuable, as stall teams commonly respond to that threat by running multiple Pokemon immune to them, such as Clefable, Jirachi, and Skarmory.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ice Beam is a decent option to OHKO Flygon, Gliscor, and Dragonite while chipping Latias and Breloom. However, it is hard to fit due to the value of Tentacruel's other moves. Hidden Power Electric may seem appealing to let Tentacruel 2HKO Gyarados, but due to its weakness to Earthquake and many Gyarados using Wacan Berry, it can struggle to pull that off. Hydro Pump can help Tentacruel push past spinblockers like Rotom and Gengar more easily, 2HKOing the latter and offensive versions of the former. With 68 Special Attack EVs, it can even 2HKO defensive versions of Rotom-A in sand after Stealth Rock. However, the extra PP of Surf is generally more beneficial. Mirror Coat could be used to take advantage of Tentacruel's massive Special Defense stat, taking powerful special attacks and then seriously denting the opposing Pokemon back, if not outright KOing them.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Tentacruel's low physical bulk and Poison typing make it a Water-type that can't switch into physical Ground-types. Many Earthquake-using Ground-types such as Flygon, Swampert, Gliscor, Quagsire, Nidoqueen, and Hippowdon can severely damage if not outright KO Tentacruel with Earthquake. However, with Surf and potentially Ice Beam, Tentacruel can deal heavy damage to Ground-types.</p> <p><strong>Clefable: Clefable is the hardest counter to Tentacruel available, as it is immune to passive damage with Magic Guard, shrugs off Surf with ease thanks to its high HP and Special Defense, and can use Knock Off itself to remove Tentacruel's Black Sludge. Calm Mind sets can also set up on Tentacruel with impunity, but Tentacruel can only threaten a Knock Off itself.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Tentacruel is vulnerable to all of Spikes, Stealth Rock, and sand while lacking reliable recovery, and it must switch in through said entry hazards to spin, and thus it gets worn down very easily.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Rotom-A and Zapdos easily 2HKO Tentacruel and are immune to Toxic Spikes while shrugging off Surf. Rotom-A is especially difficult to deal with, as it is immune to Rapid Spin. Both do not enjoy taking Knock Off, however.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attacks: Tentacruel's low physical bulk means it struggles with most physical attackers of the tier, especially if it can't hit them super effectively. All of Tyranitar, Swampert, Flygon, Metagross, Dragonite, Gyarados, Lucario, and Gliscor won't have many issues overwhelming Tentacruel.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Tentacruel's passivity means that sweepers can often switch in on it and set up, such as Calm Mind Jirachi, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Calm Mind Clefable. Dragonite can also set up on it should Dragonite have a Yache Berry or Tentacruel lacks Ice Beam, and it can KO Tentacruel with Earthquake and Outrage.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Surf provides Tentacruel with a reliable attack to check threats weak to Water, such as Gliscor, Heatran, Infernape, Nidoqueen, and Hippowdon. Despite Tentacruel's mediocre Special Attack, Surf 2HKOes Infernape and offensive Heatran, and it can even OHKO Naive Infernape. It 3HKOes most variants of Hippowdon, 2HKOes the physically defensive versions, and 2HKOes most variants of Nidoqueen. Toxic Spikes is the most common third move, as Tentacruel is one of the few Pokemon with access to it. It helps to cripple grounded offensive and defensive Pokemon alike such as Tyranitar, Swampert, Quagsire, and Hippowdon. Sludge Bomb helps overcome Tentacruel's passivity against Breloom, OHKOing it, and can spread status to Toxic Spikes-immune Pokemon like Latias, Gyarados, and Dragonite. Knock Off is another fantastic choice to make up for Tentacruel's general passivity; it can be critical to wearing down defensive Pokemon by removing Leftovers, as well as crippling Choice item attackers trying to exploit Tentacruel such as Flygon, Gyarados, Swampert, and Tyranitar. Knock Off also has excellent synergy with Toxic Spikes, preventing Leftovers from reducing poison damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Black Sludge gives Tentacruel passive recovery and offsets sand chip damage. Unlike Leftovers, it also dissuades Trick users such as Rotom-A, Metagross, and Latias. The given EV spread and nature let Tentacruel avoid the 2HKO from offensive Timid Heatran's Earth Power after Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense to make up for Tentacruel's low Defense stat, letting it better take physical Fighting-type attacks. Alternatively, a Bold nature with a spread of 252 HP / 224 Def / 32 Spe could be used to improve Tentacruel's ability to switch in on physical attacks, as its Special Defense is already quite good. Here, 32 Speed EVs allow Tentacruel to outrun maximum Speed Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tentacruel's unique palette of resistances allows it to switch into common Water-, Fire-, Ice-, and Fighting-type attacks effectively, especially from Choice item attackers such as Choice Specs Latias locked into Surf, Choice Scarf Tyranitar using Pursuit or Superpower, and Choice Specs Zapdos using Heat Wave or Hidden Power Ice. Tentacruel preys on bulky Water-types bar Swampert, Fire-types such as Heatran and Infernape, and bulky walls that can't status it, such as Skarmory, some Blissey, and some defensive Jirachi. It uses these Pokemon to remove entry hazards, set up Toxic Spikes, and hit more foes with Knock Off. However, Tentacruel is vulnerable to all entry hazards and sand; therefore, it can't be switching around too cavalierly to remove entry hazards, lest it be too weakened and overwhelmed. This weakness is exacerbated by its lack of recovery. Tentacruel typically enjoys switching in early to establish Toxic Spikes and spread Knock Off, as well as checking threats while it is healthy, and then coming in conservatively afterwards to maintain health for an emergency Rapid Spin. This emergency Rapid Spin is especially effective against defensive teams that lack Rotom-A, as many of their members are passive and don't damage Tentacruel outside of entry hazards. It can even use Toxic Spikes or Rapid Spin against Clefable in a pinch. However, keeping it in against Clefable means Tentacruel risks getting hit by Knock Off or Thunder Wave, the former of which is particularly debilitating. Generally, with its physical frailty and tendency to get worn down, using other Pokemon to get Tentacruel in is advised.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tentacruel fits best on specific teams that benefit from the specific set of roles that it compresses. Though it is an equally rare sight in the tier, Abomasnow absolutely loves having Tentacruel as a partner. It appreciates Tentacruel resisting Fighting and Fire alongside clearing Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock. In turn, Abomasnow can switch in on Ground-type attacks, and it easily scares out Ground-types like Gliscor and Flygon that threaten Tentacruel. The duo of Tentacruel and Abomasnow is great against most Water-types, with the exception of Gyarados. Hippowdon is another great partner, as it loves having Toxic Spikes cleared, and it appreciates Toxic Spikes being laid down to give it an easier time stalling out the opposition. Magnezone can remove Skarmory and Forretress early on to limit the number of times Tentacruel needs to remove Spikes. Latias and Zapdos can switch in on Ground-type attacks and force out the likes of Gliscor and Flygon, and their best checks being vulnerable to poison, combined with their own instant recovery, lets them take great advantage of Toxic Spikes. Substitute + Roost Zapdos particularly has synergy with Toxic Spikes, potentially stalling out Pokemon like Tyranitar, Swampert, and Hippowdon that would otherwise check Zapdos. Both Pokemon's reliable recovery also makes them reliable answers to Fighting-type and, in Latias's case, Fire-type attacks, making sure Tentacruel isn't overburdened and letting it focus on managing entry hazards. Specially defensive Jirachi ensures Tentacruel won't be overwhelmed by special attackers while being effective with Toxic Spikes due to Iron Head flinching and Wish stalling. Clefable greatly appreciates Toxic Spikes wearing down would-be checks and making it easier to stall out said Pokemon. Tentacruel can also lure in opposing Clefable and cripple it with Knock Off, meaning that Clefable can potentially drop Knock Off itself and use another support move, such as Encore, Thunder Wave, Stealth Rock, or even Heal Bell. The reverse also can be done, with Clefable running Knock Off so Tentacruel can run Sludge Bomb or Ice Beam instead. Calm Mind Clefable, as well as other special attackers, especially likes Toxic Spikes, as it cripples special tanks and walls like Tyranitar, Blissey, and Swampert.</p> <p>Tentacruel also can be useful for many grounded walls that enjoy Toxic Spikes support. Blissey appreciates Tentacruel's Rapid Spin, as one of Blissey's primary faults as a wall is its vulnerability to all entry hazards, especially Spikes. Blissey can in turn use Wish to heal up Tentacruel, thus mitigating Tentacruel's proclivity to getting worn down. Similarly, Celebi appreciates entry hazard removal alongside Tentacruel switching into special Fire- and Ice-type attacks; Celebi and Tentacruel work well together against almost all Water-types as well. As a fellow Grass-type, Breloom also appreciates Tentacruel's resistance palette and enjoys Rapid Spin support, and in turn, Breloom can break through Pokemon like Blissey, Clefable, Hippowdon, Tyranitar, and Swampert that can wear down or flat out KO Tentacruel. Swords Dance Breloom is especially good at wallbreaking for Tentacruel, as passive Pokemon and Ground-types give it easy setup chances. Though an uncommon sight, Lunar Dance Cresselia also makes for a good partner to Tentacruel, as it can heal Tentacruel of status and bring it back to full health in a pinch; it can also switch in on Ground-type attacks and paralyze Pokemon like Jirachi, Latias, Heatran, Lucario, and Infernape to make it easier for Tentacruel to stay in on said Pokemon.</p> "

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>While Slowbro seems like an odd choice for the OU tier, it can be handy for checking some of the metagame's top threats. When using Slowbro in OU, make sure that it isn't being used in a role where it can be outclassed by Suicune and Vaporeon. Slowbro is a blessing on teams that struggle with Dragon Dance sweepers (excluding Tyranitar), and will see the most use on those teams. With its rock-solid Defense and decent Special Defense, however, it can be used as either a physical wall or a mixed wall. Slowbro does greatly struggle with Scizor, however; Scizor can easily switch in on Slowbro's relatively weak Surf and spam a STAB U-turn. Tyranitar can also be a huge problem for Slowbro, as it can deal hefty damage to it via Crunch. While Slowbro is quite bulky, it will fall to powerful special attacks. Gengar's Shadow Ball and Rotom-A's STAB attacks will deal a hefty hit to Slowbro. Don't let these negative factors discourage you, however, as Slowbro can be a huge asset to a team when used correctly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>All of Slowbro's more effective options for use in the OU environment have already been discussed. Psychic can be used to hit Machamp harder, but even with a STAB boost and factoring in the super effective hit, Slowbro can still only 2HKO standard 252 HP / 0 SpD Machamp. Slowbro does have access to Light Screen, which can be useful in certain situations if you are aiming for Slowbro to perform more of a support role on your team. It is generally outclassed by Bronzong and Cresselia, however, as far as setting up Light Screen goes. Slowbro can also use Grass Knot as a more powerful means of hitting fellow Water-type Pokemon than Hidden Power Electric, but Slowbro generally has more productive things to do with its precious moveslots. Slowbro also has access to Flamethrower and Fire Blast. While these moves can be useful for hitting Scizor switch-ins for an OHKO, they warrant little use outside of that. Scizor can outspeed and deal ridiculous damage to Slowbro with a STAB-boosted Choice Band U-turn as it is, so Flamethrower and Fire Blast are really only useful if you are positive your opponent is switching in Scizor. Should it not be the metal bug, your opponent will have gotten a new Pokemon in practically for free, while Slowbro will have wasted one of its moveslots.</p> <p>Calm Mind Slowbro can also be used effectively in OU after Scizor and Tyranitar are taken out by teammates. Calm Mind Slowbro is somewhat outclassed by Suicune, but the fact that Slowbro is much more physically bulky and has two powerful STAB attacks to work with does somewhat help its case. Slowbro is also a great user of Trick Room, as it is one of the slowest Pokemon in the entire game. A simple 252 HP / 252 SpA spread can work wonders on a Trick Room team, as Slowbro's dual STAB combination and decent Special Attack stat can tear through weakened teams. Slowbro is a great support Pokemon in general, and while other Pokemon may have a wider movepool, Slowbro's bulk and access to Slack Off allow it to fulfill a valuable niche on almost any kind of team; moves like Trick, Yawn, and Counter set Slowbro apart from fellow bulky Water-type Pokemon like Vaporeon and Suicune. This is important, as when you are playing with Slowbro in OU, you should try and make sure you're using it in a role where it cannot be \"outclassed\".</p> <p>A simple 252 HP / 252 Def EV spread will generally be best, as it maximizes Slowbro's physical bulk; OU is a tier crammed with powerful physical sweepers, and Slowbro needs all of the bulk that it can muster to stand up to these giants. Maximum defense allows Slowbro to survive a +1 Dragon Dance Dragonite's Life Orb Outrage after Stealth Rock damage (to give you an idea of how bulky it truly is). On the Choice Specs set, an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA will generally be the best, as it allows Slowbro to balance bulk and power. It will not be able to take as many hits as it would with 252 EVs in Defense, however; while it is by no means frail when lacking defense EVs, it isn't as bulky as it was, and can no longer survive a Swords Dance Lucario's +2 Life Orb Crunch (among other attacks).</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As mentioned a few times in the analysis, Tyranitar and Scizor are very problematic for Slowbro to handle. Slowbro, while very bulky, simply cannot stand up to repeated Crunches and U-turns from these Pokemon. Basically, any Pursuit user will give Slowbro a rough time, as they can scare Slowbro away with their STAB attacks and proceed to take out the fleeing Slowbro with Pursuit. Weavile is a major pain for the Choice Specs set, as it can switch in on an expected Psychic and simply Pursuit away as Slowbro has no choice but to switch. Weavile can switch in on Slowbro, but it will lose a large chunk of health in the process due to its frailness and Stealth Rock weakness. Blissey can put a full stop to Slowbro's plans with ease thanks to her absurd Special Defense and HP stats, but she will not enjoy being hit with Trick from the Choice Specs set. Slowbro, as bulky as it is, will not be able to take multiple neutral hits. Slowbro's typing somewhat limits its defensive capabilities, as it leaves it weak to Grass-, Dark-, Bug-, Electric-, and Ghost-type attacks. These attacking types are relatively common in the OU tier, and the fact that most Grass-, Ghost-, and Electric-type attacks are special attacks doesn't help at all. Gengar and Jolteon are big pains for Slowbro, as while they cannot switch in on it, they can certainly come in after a teammate faints; from there, they simply have to spam their STAB move for a clean OHKO on Slowbro.</p> ",

        "name": "Utility Counter",
        "description": "<p>Slowbro is usually seen in the UU metagame, but it can also be used very well in the OU environment. It is a perfect counter to Machamp, and can take on other top threats like Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite very well. It also has reliable recovery in the form of Slack Off, which sets it apart from its fellow bulky Water-type Suicune.</p> <p>Surf gives Slowbro a reliable STAB to work with. In the third slot, the move that you use is entirely up to what Pokemon your team needs Slowbro to check. Ice Beam can OHKO Dragonite after Stealth Rock, while Hidden Power Electric is a guaranteed 2HKO on Gyarados, who struggles to 2HKO in return, even with a +1 Adamant Life Orb Bounce. In the final slot, two moves can be used. Thunder Wave is a nice choice for providing paralysis support for slower sweepers like Bulk Up Machamp. Toxic, on the other hand, is more useful for stall teams, as Toxic Slowbro can stall out many of the OU tier's top physical forces with Slack Off.</p> <p>Slowbro counters Dragon Dance Dragonite and Gyarados, but also fares well against other common sweepers such as physical Infernape, Metagross, and Flygon. It is also notable as a perfect counter to Machamp, thanks to Own Tempo (which prevents confusion), a resistance to Dynamic Punch, and its low base Speed, which ensures it never takes double the damage from Payback. Slowbro is particularly good at taking neutral unboosted physical attacks, as most do not even 2HKO, and Slowbro can slowly bring the opposing Pokemon to the ground with a combination of Surf, Toxic, and Slack Off. Slowbro faces competition for a team slot from Suicune and Vaporeon, but has distinct advantages over both. Suicune must use the unreliable Rest and Sleep Talk combination for recovery, while Slowbro has access to Slack Off. Slowbro's ability to use Thunder Wave to stop sweepers that it can't hit effectively sets it apart from Vaporeon. Its Psychic sub-typing also lets it counter Fighting-types more effectively than either Suicune or Vaporeon.</p> <p>Slowbro generally fits better on defensive or stall teams, as its natural physical bulk and access to instant recovery tend to draw out matches and make for a slower game; however, that isn't to say that Slowbro can't be used on offensive teams. Slowbro makes a great partner for Pokemon who enjoy having the opponent's setup sweepers taken out of the game. This includes Choice item wielding Pokemon such as Choice Band Metagross, as predicting incorrectly can lead to some sticky situations (such as if Dragon Dance Gyarados or Dragonite switches in on Metagross's Choice-locked Earthquake).</p> <p>Scizor and Tyranitar, two of the OU tier's most common Pokemon, are huge threats to Slowbro. These Pokemon can switch in rather easily on any of Slowbro's attacks (but Dragon Dance variants of Tyranitar won't enjoy paralysis from Thunder Wave). They can then proceed to severely dent Slowbro with their STAB U-turns and Crunches, respectively. Machamp is a nearly surefire Tyranitar counter, and benefits greatly from Slowbro's paralysis support. Protect Gengar with Hidden Power Fire and Focus Blast can lure and kill both Scizor and non-Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Lucario makes a good partner due to Slowbro's Pursuit weakness, as it can easily come in on a Choice-locked Pursuit from the likes of Scizor, Weavile, and Tyranitar, and proceed to set up a Swords Dance.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Slowbro can be a dangerous force in OU, as its STAB combination of Surf + Psychic gives great type coverage. An advantage of using Choice Specs Slowbro is that your opponent will never see it coming; Slowbro is uncommon to begin with, and Choice Specs Slowbro is even more so. Slowbro can hit extremely hard with Choice Specs equipped, and as such, should not be underestimated. The great thing about Specs Slowbro is that it defeats its own counters. Scizor and Tyranitar are unable to switch in on a Choice Specs boosted Surf, and Celebi will take huge damage from Fire Blast. More frail Pokemon will have a hard time trying to deal with this Slowbro variant thanks to its amalgam of bulk and power, while defensive Pokemon are crippled with Trick.</p> <p>Surf is easily Slowbro's best form of STAB, providing nice neutral coverage; Water is a fantastic offensive typing in the OU tier, as the only Pokemon commonly found there that resist it are other bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Gyarados and Vaporeon, Dragon-type Pokemon such as Dragonite, and Grass-type Pokemon such as Celebi and Roserade. Psychic gives Slowbro a nice way of hitting opposing Water-type Pokemon harder than with Surf. Trick is great on Slowbro, as it allows it to cripple any defensive Pokemon, like Blissey, that may be switching in on it attempting to wall its attacks. In the final slot, there are two viable options. Fire Blast is the better choice as it allows Slowbro to handle Steel-type Pokemon who attempt to switch in on it, as well as Celebi. Ice Beam can also be used to get past Celebi. Slack Off is a viable alternative if your team already has a powerful user of Fire-type moves, however, such as Life Orb Heatran.</p> <p>Good teammates for this set are Pokemon who can take advantage of the massive holes that Slowbro opens up in the opposing team. Dragon Dance Dragonite is a good choice for this role, as it resists Grass-type attacks and takes neutral damage from Electric-type attacks. Dragon Dance Dragonite can easily sweep an opposing team once its physical walls have been weakened. Swords Dance Lucario and Dragon Dance Gyaradaos are in a similar boat, although Gyarados shares Slowbro's Electric-type weakness. Slowbro needs Stealth Rock to be most effective, as it secures some OHKOes and 2HKOes that would otherwise be impossible. Swampert is a good choice for this role, as it is immune to Electric-type attacks. It does, unfortunately, share Slowbro's Grass-type weakness, but Grass-type moves are rarely seen in the OU environment, barring Grass Knot.</p> <p>Here are some damage calculations to demonstrate how powerful this set is:</p> <ul> <li>Surf vs. 248/0 Scizor: 75 - 88% <li>Surf vs. 4/0 Tyranitar: 83 - 98%</li> <li>Surf vs. 160/0 Tyranitar: 75 - 88%</li> <li>Surf vs. 252/0 Tyranitar: 70 - 83%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs. 252/0 Metagross: 100%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs. 252/0 Celebi: 89 - 100%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs. 252/92 Bronzong: 78% - 92%</li> <li>Psychic vs. 0/0 Gyarados: 61% - 72%</li> <li>Psychic vs. 188/0 Vaporeon: 47% - 56%</li> </ul> "

Magneton still has the rare ability to trap and remove Steel-types from the game with Magnet Pull. When using Magneton, always remember to abuse its higher Speed, or you are better off using Magnezone.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Magneton has the same movepool as Magnezone, its lack of bulk makes a lot of other options harder to perform, so they are generally better left to Magnezone. Such options include the traditional Substitute SteelKiller set, Choice Specs, and Dual Screens. Magneton also has other moves at its disposal, such as Discharge and Thunder Wave, but again, these moves are better used by Magnezone, which boasts more impressive bulk.</p> <p>On the Choice Scarf set, one can sacrifice some Special Attack EVs to power up Explosion a little more. However, if one were to add some Attack EVs onto Magneton, make sure that its Special Attack stat does not fall any lower than 327 (which is no less than 204 Special Attack EVs). This is because Magneton will lose the guaranteed 2HKO on Jolly Tyranitar after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Magneton's counters are essentially the same as Magnezone's. Blissey and Snorlax's massive Special Defense lets them take any attack that Magneton can throw at them with ease (barring Explosion). Celebi can also absorb most attacks that Magneton uses, but must watch out for the occasional Signal Beam, which will OHKO it. Lastly, Rotom-A can also switch into Magneton without much trouble, but must rely on Overheat or Hydro Pump to do significant damage to it.</p> <p>Depending on which Hidden Power Magneton runs, Flygon, Gliscor, and Swampert can counter Magneton. Zapdos can OHKO any Magneton with Heat Wave, but will detest taking Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Ice.

Magneton can then proceed to revenge kill all of them with the appropriate move. Thunderbolt OHKOes Gyarados and Starmie, Hidden Power Ice destroys Dragonite, and Flash Cannon can pick off weakened Tyranitar and OHKOes Weavile. Explosion is always a good move to allow Magneton to go out with a bang, potentially taking down an opposing Pokemon in the process. Hidden Power Fire can be used if you want to quickly kill Scizor and Forretress. Note that Magneton will Speed-tie with max Speed Adamant Gyarados if you choose to use Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>Signal Beam can replace Explosion in the last spot if you find sacrificing Magneton unappealing, as it can be used to OHKO Celebi and hit Grass-types harder than Hidden Power Ice. Hidden Power Ground can be used to KO opposing Magneton, Magnezone, and non-Choice Scarf or Shuca Berry Heatran. Discharge is also an option if you want to spread paralysis, but Thunderbolt is usually always better due to the extra power needed to revenge kill opposing Pokemon. Maximum Speed EVs and a Naive or Hasty nature are used so Magneton is as fast as possible while leaving Explosion's power intact. 252 Special Attack EVs let Magneton hit as hard as possible.

Dragonite, which resists all of Magneton's weaknesses, loves Skarmory and Scizor being removed from the battlefield. Flygon and Kingdra also appreciate the removal of Steel-types that otherwise stop them cleaning up late-game. Aside from Dragonite, bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon, Suicune, and Swampert make good partners to Magneton because they can easily switch into Fire-type Pokemon (Heatran in particular). Celebi, Breloom, and Shaymin can switch into Ground-type attacks that plague Magneton. Gyarados gets a special mention, because just like Dragonite, it also resists all of Magneton's weaknesses. Magneton will find itself walled by Blissey if it can avoid Explosion. Lucario and Infernape can force out Blissey and set up for a sweep as long as they avoid Thunder Wave. Gliscor can switch into any attack from Blissey apart from Toxic or the rare Ice Beam and Taunt it.

Finally, Lanturn resists Hydro Pump, Thunderbolt, and Surf, and also doesn't take much from the rare Grass Knot due to its low weight.</p> <p>There are quite a few Pokemon that can't switch directly into one or many of Starmie's attacks, but can check it once they get in unscathed. Although most Shaymin and Celebi are 2HKOed by Ice Beam, they comfortably survive Ice Beam from full health and KO Starmie with STAB Grass-type attacks. It's worth noting that it's possible to EV both of these to survive two Life Orb Ice Beams with specially defensive spreads. Zapdos takes lots of damage from Hydro Pump or Ice Beam, but like the previously mentioned Grass-type Pokemon, can survive a single Ice Beam and OHKO Starmie in return. Even though Vaporeon and Suicune fear Thunderbolt, they can fight back with Hidden Power Electric or stall with Wish and Protect in Vaporeon's case. Common Choice Scarf users in Flygon, Rotom-A, and Jirachi all have super effective attacks to use against Starmie if they manage to switch in on a resisted or immune move. Finally, to block Starmie's Rapid Spin, the best candidate is usually Rotom-A, particularly Choice Scarf variants or defensive sets with Special Defense investment.</p> <p>It would be remiss to complete a discussion of Starmie's counters without a mention of Pursuit users. Tyranitar, Scizor, and Weavile all scare Starmie with their powerful Pursuits, even though they have issues taking Starmie's powerful Hydro Pump. Equipping a Choice Scarf to Tyranitar or Scizor will let them outpace Starmie, so if they switch into Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Rapid Spin, or Recover, they don't have to worry about surviving the incoming Hydro Pump as well. The higher Speed means they can \"checkmate\" Starmie; it must guess between staying in and potentially eating a Crunch or U-turn, or switching out and potentially getting trapped by Pursuit. Weavile doesn't need to worry about the Speed issue, since it is naturally faster than Starmie.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Starmie's blazing Speed and great type coverage make it a fearsome special sweeper that is especially potent as a late-game cleaner against offensive teams. Hydro Pump is a powerful STAB attack that OHKOes most Tyranitar after one Stealth Rock switch-in and Scizor after two. It is so intense that it 2HKOes Swampert, Jirachi, and Metagross, and even some Pokemon that resist Water, such as Breloom and opposing Starmie. Ice Beam and Thunderbolt are used to hit bulkier Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks, such as Celebi, Dragonite, Suicune, and Vaporeon. With Recover, Starmie can switch into Heatran and Infernape with greater ease while being able to heal off damage taken from Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil.</p> <p>Starmie is also an excellent offensive spinner if it runs Rapid Spin over Recover. Rotom-A, the primary OU spinblocker, will be extremely reluctant to switch into Starmie, as Starmie's Life Orb-boosted Hydro Pump OHKOes offensive variants and 2HKOes defensive versions. Forgoing Recover decreases Starmie's longevity, but it may not get many chances to use Recover against offensive teams in the first place, while a successful spin can be the deciding factor in a battle.</p> <p>As Hydro Pump has less-than-stellar accuracy, Starmie can instead use Surf as a reliable attack to take down Pokemon like Infernape. The extra firepower that Hydro Pump provides, however, is needed to secure several OHKOs and 2HKOs, specifically against Swampert, Scizor, Tyranitar, and 252 HP Jirachi. If Starmie carries Rapid Spin in the last slot instead of Recover, it makes an effective anti-lead. It resists many of the attacks that common leads use (such as Infernape's Fire Blast and Close Combat, Azelf's Psychic and Fire Blast, and Metagross's Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch) and can use Rapid Spin to simultaneously dispatch of Focus Sash users and their set up entry hazards. This makes Starmie particularly effective in dealing with suicide leads like Infernape, Aerodactyl, and Azelf. Grass Knot is recommended over Thunderbolt or Ice Beam on a leading Starmie in order to OHKO Swampert. If Starmie is using Recover in the last slot, shifting a few EVs into its defenses will let Starmie switch with greater ease into Pokemon like Infernape and Heatran.</p> <p>Starmie can use both Rapid Spin and Recover on this set, dropping either Ice Beam or Thunderbolt. This allows it to heal with impunity against many Pokemon common to stall teams, such as Blissey, Gyarados, Hippowdon, and Heatran, which increases its chance of spinning away entry hazards. The drawback is that Starmie performs slightly worse against offensive teams; if you drop Ice Beam, Celebi, Shaymin, and Dragonite will have a field day, while losing Thunderbolt means Gyarados and Suicune can set up. If your team can clear out those Pokemon, though, this alternative is a great middle ground between Starmie's two most popular sets.</p> <p>In spite of Starmie's formidable offensive prowess, it has problems getting past a few specific Pokemon. Blissey and Snorlax are the best counters for offensive Starmie; Blissey can use Seismic Toss and Toxic to wear down Starmie, while Snorlax can hit back with Body Slam, Crunch, and Pursuit. Speaking of Pursuit, Starmie is not as afraid of Pursuit as most other Psychic-types because it can maim or OHKO many common Pursuit users, such as Tyranitar and Scizor, with its STAB Hydro Pump. However, if Choice Scarf Tyranitar manages to switch into Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Rapid Spin, or Recover, it can threaten Starmie with its higher Speed and both Pursuit and Crunch. Scizor survives Hydro Pump as long as it switches into Stealth Rock only once, but it must essentially sacrifice itself to take Starmie out. Finally, Choice Scarf users, such as Jirachi and Rotom-A, do well against Starmie if they switch into a resisted move.</p> <p>This set is easy to use, especially if Starmie is forgoing the use of Rapid Spin. Stealth Rock is highly recommended since it has wide distribution and will weaken the opposing team, which makes Starmie's late-game sweep easier. While Spikes are harder to set up, they can turn Starmie's Hydro Pump from a 2HKO into an OHKO against bulkier opponents. Finally, Toxic Spikes are valuable primarily because they allow Starmie with Recover to break through Blissey, but also to wear down Pokemon like Swampert, Suicune, and Snorlax.</p> "

        "name": "Rapid Spin",
        "description": "<p>Starmie is a fine choice for spinning away entry hazards. While Forretress, the other common OU spinner, is slower than Rotom-A and is neutered by Will-O-Wisp, Starmie is faster and can use STAB Surf to combat Rotom-A. Surf also provides a reliable weapon to use against Infernape and Heatran, as their hits are buffered by this set's defensive investment. With Thunderbolt, Starmie is an excellent counter to Gyarados. Recover keeps Starmie at high health, which lets it perform its countering and spinning duties reliably throughout the match.</p> <p>The EVs are tailored for survivability while still taking advantage of Starmie's high Speed. 252 Speed EVs are used to Speed tie with opposing Starmie and Azelf, which gives you a chance to finish them off in a clutch scenario. If you are particularly concerned about Adamant Life Orb Dragon Dance Gyarados, using a spread of 136 HP / 156 Def / 216 Spe will ensure that Starmie is never KOed by +1 Earthquake or Stone Edge after Stealth Rock; this spread maintains Starmie's ability to outpace Gengar and Infernape. Max HP is more effective in most other instances, though, especially for switching into Heatran. If you wish to drop Starmie's Speed further, aim for 300 (Adamant Flygon and Timid Rotom-A), 288 (Jolly Gyarados), or 280 (neutral Lucario and Timid Heatran). In any case, remaining EVs should go in HP.</p> <p>Grass-type Pokemon can also be particularly annoying since this set gives them a more-or-less free switch-in. Heatran, Skarmory, Forretress, Zapdos, and Flygon can all help deal with Shaymin and Celebi to an extent, but the versatility those Grass-types exhibit means it is impossible to find a perfect switch-in for all situations. Starmie can carry Ice Beam instead of Thunderbolt to ward off these Grass-type Pokemon, but it will no longer be able to counter Gyarados. Oftentimes, just the threat of Thunderbolt will cause Gyarados to switch out. Regardless of whether it runs Ice Beam or Thunderbolt, this set's low damage output gives Dragon Dance Kingdra free reign to set up. Using a few bulky Steel-type Pokemon like Scizor, Metagross, or Skarmory can help patch up this weakness.</p> <p>Pursuit users are not too bothersome for the Life Orb set due to its heavy investment in Special Attack, but they can prey on bulky Starmie since its Surf is relatively weak. If Tyranitar or Scizor aren't substantially weakened, it's impossible to \"escape\" from Pursuit. There are a number of Pokemon you can use as teammates to compensate for Starmie's Pursuit troubles, though. The classic example is Lucario, which can take advantage of a Choice-locked Pursuit to set up a potentially game-winning Swords Dance. However, if Starmie gets Pursuited in the early game, Lucario may have a tough time sweeping if it tries to set up immediately. Other Pokemon, such as Substitute Machamp, Skarmory, and Dragon Dance Gyarados, can also set up on Pursuit. If Scizor traps Starmie, Magnezone can turn the tables and trap it in return. Substitute + Will-O-Wisp Rotom-A is a good way to lure and cripple Tyranitar, but Scizor are usually not very eager to switch in until it has scouted Rotom-A's set.</p> "

        "name": "Bulky Rapid Spin (Bold Starmie)",
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Tyranitar and Scizor have historically been able to tank Starmie's hits and retaliate with Pursuit. This Starmie set aims to alleviate this Pursuit weakness that has hampered Starmie and provide considerably more bulk than the standard spin set, allowing Starmie to act as sturdier pivot. The most common Pursuit Tyranitar set is currently Choice Scarf Tyranitar, which always fails to OHKO Bold Starmie after Stealth Rock with Crunch, allowing Starmie to spin in a pinch. The given EVs allow Starmie to outspeed Adamant max Speed Lucario, and, by extension, other neutral nature base 90s and Timid Heatran. An additional 20 EVs in Speed allow Starmie to outpace Jolly Mamoswine and although Starmie should not be used as a primary Mamoswine check, the additional bulk allows Starmie to switch into Mamoswine a couple of times.</p> <p>The choice between Thunderbolt and Reflect depends on what is a better fit for the team Starmie is being used on. Thunderbolt is more common because it allows Starmie to function as a reliable Gyarados check that can also deal some damage to bulky Water-types such as opposing Starmie or Suicune. Reflect softens the blows from harder hitting Pursuit users such as Choice Band Scizor and Choice Band Tyranitar and can also provide direct team support. The choice between Hydro Pump and Surf lies mainly in personal preference. Hydro Pump is less accurate, but its extra power allows Starmie to quickly wear down Rotom-A, while Surf deals damage more consistently. One major upside of using Hydro Pump is that it allows Starmie to 2HKO Heatran, even if it is holding a Passho Berry, something that Surf cannot do. Although Starmie was once considered the ultimate Infernape counter, Bold Starmie must be careful switching into Infernape because a coverage move followed by Grass Knot will 2HKO Starmie, and Starmie no longer outspeeds Infernape.</p> <p>As mentioned previously, the added bulk of Bold Starmie helps to alleviate the Pursuit weakness that Starmie has. This has made Bold Starmie an excellent choice to act as both a spinner and a bulky Water-type for stall teams. However, at only 280 Speed, Starmie no longer outspeeds Gengar and does not outspeed most Rotom-A, barring defensive RestTalk sets. In order for Starmie to spin more easily, a Pursuit user makes an excellent teammate. In particular, Choice Scarf Tyranitar can switch into Gengar's Shadow Balls as well as any of Rotom-A's assaults thanks to a buffed Special Defense stat and can remove them from play. If your team does not worry about Gengar, a mixed Tyranitar set is also an excellent choice, because it can still remove Rotom-A from play with Pursuit and, by feigning a Choice Scarf set, can surprise otherwise troublesome Pokemon such as Breloom and Forretress.</p> <p>Ice Beam can be used on Starmie to deal more damage to Pokemon such as Breloom and Dragonite, but even with the added bulk a Bold nature provides, Starmie has little business switching into either one. If Starmie is being used as the spinner on a hail team, Blizzard is an excellent option, 2HKOing Shaymin and Zapdos as well as OHKOing Breloom. When using an Ice-type attack on Starmie, 287 Speed is more appropriate than 280. As for other teammates, Starmie appreciates having a teammate that can easily switch into Grass-type Pokemon. Specially defensive Skarmory does an excellent job switching into Grass-types and setting up Spikes. Heatran is another Pokemon that can come into Grass-types and can run a variety of different sets, including but not limited to a specially defensive set to handle Electric-types that scare Starmie off and a Choice Scarf set to beat Pokemon like Dragonite and Swords Dance Scizor.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>With excellent Speed and respectable Special Attack as well as a diverse movepool, Choice Specs suits Starmie perfectly. STAB Hydro Pump deals massive damage to almost every Pokemon, including those with a resistance to Water-type moves. Tyranitar, Scizor, Lucario, Gengar, and Rotom-A are all OHKOed, while Swampert, Breloom, and Machamp are soundly 2HKOed. Even offensive Dragonite and Gyarados are 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage. Thunderbolt and Ice Beam are fairly obvious choices to hit the Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks. Thunderbolt nets coverage on Vaporeon, Suicune, and Gyarados, while Ice Beam covers Dragonite, Celebi, and Shaymin. Finally, Trick lets Starmie cripple overzealous Blissey.</p> <p>This set's goal and playstyle are similar to those of the Life Orb set, so naturally the sets share teammates and counters. One difference is that while Life Orb Starmie cannot do anything to Blissey, Choice Specs Starmie can cripple her by Tricking its Choice Specs away. Even though that heavily decreases Blissey's effectiveness, it also puts a damper on Starmie's ability to sweep, so Blissey should still be seen as a threat to this set. Although Hydro Pump cleanly OHKOes Tyranitar and Scizor, two common Pursuit users, Starmie is still vulnerable if it is caught while using Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, or Trick. To minimize this risk, Starmie should only use a move other than Hydro Pump or Surf when absolutely necessary. Also, Pokemon that can take advantage of a Choice-locked Pursuit, like Lucario, Infernape, Gyarados, and Machamp, are good teammates.</p> <p>Since Choice Specs Hydro Pump is considerably more damaging than Life Orb Hydro Pump, Pokemon that appreciate Starmie's ability to wear down common Pokemon that resist the Water-type are good teammates. Infernape, Heatran, and Gyarados benefit if Suicune is weakened, while Kingdra, Suicune, Gyarados, and Swampert appreciate the absence of Celebi and Shaymin. Rotom-A, Kingdra, and Dragonite are good ways to maintain momentum after Starmie has used Trick against Blissey and Vaporeon. Finally, it is still important to pack a few counters or checks to these Pokemon even though Starmie will be nailing them with a Hydro Pump that is more powerful than expected, since the weaken-and-sweep strategy means that your offensive core is especially vulnerable to them.</p> <p>Starmie will be spamming Hydro Pump or Surf the majority of the time, so Pokemon that set up on those attacks are a distinct threat. Calm Mind Suicune, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Dragon Dance Kingdra can easily set up if they switch in after Starmie has scored a KO. Celebi and Shaymin are both good answers to most Suicune and non-Bounce Gyarados sets. Breloom is a great counter to Crocune, while Blissey easily takes on offensive Calm Mind sets. All three Grass-types also force Kingdra to use Outrage, which lets you beat it with a Steel-type like Metagross or Scizor. Calm Mind Jirachi is a good answer to offensive Suicune and most Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Scarf Rotom-A can check all three. A Gyarados of your own can buffer hits from opposing Gyarados and Kingdra with Intimidate, which lets another one of Starmie's teammates handle them with greater ease.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Putting a Choice Scarf onto Starmie allows it to effectively revenge kill many of the metagame's largest threats, including Gyarados, Gengar, and Heatran, even after their own Speed boosts. This speed, combined with Starmie's good Special Attack and movepool, makes it a great check to all of these threats by stopping them from sweeping your team. Surf is a reliable STAB attack and lets Starmie revenge kill Gengar and Heatran, while Ice Beam and Thunderbolt let it do the same to Dragonite and Gyarados, respectively. Trick is used in the last slot to cripple such counters as Blissey, Vaporeon, Suicune, and Celebi, and also lets Starmie serve as a last-ditch check to Pokemon threatening to sweep your team.</p> <p>Since Starmie doesn't have access to a boosting item with this set, a Modest nature is recommended in order to compensate for the lost power. However, a Timid nature is an option if you are concerned about outpacing Choice Scarf Gengar and Infernape or Life Orb variants of the two after Starmie has Tricked away its Scarf. Thunderbolt and Ice Beam will still OHKO Gyarados and Dragonite, but Surf and Hydro Pump will be noticeably weaker against neutral targets.</p> <p>This set can be used effectively in the lead slot. If you decide to do that, using Rapid Spin over either Ice Beam or Thunderbolt will allow Starmie to spin away Stealth Rock after it has Tricked its Choice Scarf onto the opposing Stealth Rock lead; Metagross, Swampert, and even Azelf are good targets for this strategy. Additionally, if Starmie is matched up against Forretress or Hippowdon, using Trick on the first turn will usually let you catch a stall team's Blissey or Vaporeon, crippling it for the rest of the match. If you decide not to immediately use Trick, Starmie will retain its role as an effective revenge killer in the later stages of a match. Unfortunately, leading Choice Scarf Starmie lose to U-turn Azelf, Machamp, and Roserade, so you should also carry Pokemon that can beat those leads.</p> <p>As with the Choice Specs set, Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks will easily set up on Hydro Pump or Surf. This is made far worse here, however, because of the lack of power behind this set. Breloom and Suicune can now take advantage of Starmie. On the other hand, Dragonite and Gyarados cannot exploit this set as readily. With a Choice Scarf, Starmie will be faster than Dragonite and Gyarados even when they have a Dragon Dance, which means it can switch out then immediately switch back in to revenge kill. However, it is still helpful to have Pokemon that can immediately take on these threats. Swampert beats Dragon Dance Dragonite if it's at full health, and plenty of other Pokemon can force an Outrage so you can take out Dragonite with a Steel-type Pokemon. Choice Scarf Jirachi cleanly outpaces Dragonite and can revenge kill it with Ice Punch, Scizor's Bullet Punch strips off over half of Dragonite's health, and Lucario's Extreme Speed does quite a bit as well. Bulky Calm Mind Jirachi defeats Gyarados, as does Rotom-A. Calm Mind Jirachi beats Suicune, as do Celebi and Shaymin. Various bulky Steel-types, such as Metagross and Scizor, beat Kingdra.</p> "

  "Gyarados": {
    "overview": "<p>Gyarados is a centralizing threat in DPP OU due to its potent mix of power and defensive prowess. Gyarados is perhaps the best sweeper in the tier with its access to Dragon Dance, making it a staple of the hyper offensive playstyle. Gyarados’s Water / Flying typing, bulk, and Intimidate give it chances to set up, while its superior coverage and strength allow it to potentially muscle through walls. Gyarados also provides critical resistances to offensive teams, as Gyarados is an excellent check to prominent Pokemon such as Lucario, Swampert, Heatran, Scizor, and both Tyranitar and opposing Gyarados lacking Stone Edge. This bulk and Intimidate also make Gyarados a fantastic wall, as with full defensive investment and Roar, it can continually phase out offensive threats. Especially without Stealth Rock up, defensive Gyarados is one of the best answers to opposing offense, as the same prowess that makes it easy to set up Dragon Dance also makes it difficult to overwhelm. Additionally, Gyarados is a great Choice Band user, as it hits hard immediately and is an excellent lure. With Payback, Gyarados can potentially OHKO many of its prominent Dark-weak checks on the switch after Stealth Rock, such as defensive Latias, Rotom-A, and Celebi. Gyarados’s Waterfall has a prominent flinch chance, meaning walls that do not resist Water such as Skarmory and defensive Zapdos are often one flinch away from Gyarados breaking them.</p> <p>Gyarados has two crippling flaws: losing 25% of its HP to Stealth Rock and its huge Electric weakness. Offensive Gyarados’s power is such that running dedicated anti Stealth Rock leads such as Azelf and Aerodactyl or leading Gyarados itself are often worth it, just to not have to deal with Stealth Rock. For defensive variants, dedicated Rapid Spin support is mandatory, as defensive Gyarados lacks reliable recovery and struggles to wall foes with Stealth Rock up. Offensive Gyarados struggles to deal with bulky defensive Pokemon that resist Water and can phase, status, or KO it, such as Latias, Suicune, opposing defensive Gyarados, Quagsire, and Milotic. Gyarados also must pick and choose its coverage moves: it needs dedicated options such as Taunt or Stone Edge to deal with walls such as Skarmory and Zapdos reliably, while it despises Breloom and Latias should it lack Ice Fang, Outrage, or Bounce. Gyarados’s huge weakness to Electric is another big issue, as most Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom-A, Latias, and Flygon can revenge kill it should it lack a Wacan Berry due to its average Speed. However, this item choice leaves it open to status, as without a Lum Berry or Substitute, Gyarados can be crippled by defensive Jirachi, Celebi, and Breloom. Similarly, without Leftovers, Gyarados is worn down quickly as it is sand vulnerable and already struggles with residual damage. Choice Band Gyarados is less effective once its surprise is revealed, as all its attacks have reliable switch ins and relies heavily on prediction.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Gyarados’s primary other options revolve around bulkier Dragon Dance sets. Dragon Dance sets can primarily invest in HP EVs instead of Attack EVs to increase its survivability, especially with Leftovers and a utility move such as Taunt, Thunder Wave, or Substitute. An example EV spread would be 248 HP / 40 Atk / 36 Def / 184 Spe, as this emphasizes Gyarados’s bulk against Fighting-types, Metagross, and Scizor while still being offensively threatening. Note that Gyarados should run at least 184 Spe EVs even on bulkier spreads to outspeed Starmie and Choice Scarf Tyranitar at +1. With Substitute, Gyarados can dodge status and Explosion while also taking advantage of Pokemon it forces out. With a Substitute up, it can either spread paralysis more easily with Thunder Wave or use an additional coverage move such as Double-Edge, Return, or Ice Fang. Substitute + Thunder Wave sets are particularly devastating alongside offensive Pokemon that enjoy paralysis, such as Machamp and Mamoswine. Gyarados can also use Chesto Berry + Rest to set up, heal off the residual damage, and then sweep; however, it struggles against faster Choice Scarf Electric-types that force it out even it if has a boost.</p> <p>Any offensive Gyarados set can use Aqua Tail over Waterfall for the additional power but beware of its poor accuracy. On a similar note, Gyarados can also use Life Orb for more power, but it already struggles with residual damage. Other items include Power Herb to immediately use Bounce and OHKO Grass-types and Liechi Berry to give it one last attack boost at low health. Gyarados can also run other options in its Rest + Sleep Talk set, the most prominent of which is Dragon Dance. A mono-attacking Gyarados makes for a bulky tank that can set up and sweep; however, it is commonly forced out due to not posing enough of a threat until multiple boosts are accumulated and does not provide much utility outside of a late game sweeper. Gyarados has much more niche sets such as Substitute + Flail on rain teams and sets revolving around special attacks like Thunder and Hydro Pump, but these generally require more support than they are worth.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Stealth Rock is a thorn in Gyarados’s side, as keeping the entry hazard up is often enough to neutralize Gyarados after it is forced out. Sand also chips at Gyarados without Leftovers and eats away at its survivability. Defensive Gyarados in particular struggles to be effective if its forced to Rest more often.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Gyarados is plagued by its 4x weakness to Electric-type attacks, and Rotom-A, Zapdos, Raikou, and Magnezone all can easily OHKO Gyarados, even through Wacan Berry after Stealth Rock. While uncommon, both Jolteon and Choice Scarf Magneton outspeed Adamant +1 Gyarados and easily OHKO it. All these Pokemon need to be careful, as Gyarados can hit them hard on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Faster revenge killers: Faster Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom-A, Latias, Flygon, Lucario, and Metagross can all outspeed Adamant +1 Gyarados and revenge kill it, but must watch out for Wacan Berry. Aerodactyl and Crobat are uncommon choices, but also outspeed boosted Adamant Gyarados and 2HKO bulkless versions. Slower Choice Scarf users such as Magneton and Metagross should beware of Jolly Gyarados. Dragonite and Scizor can also pick off weakened Gyarados with priority.</p> <p><strong>Latias: Physically defensive Latias resists Water-type attacks and is bulky enough to survive its most common coverage moves in Ice Fang. Latias can either phase it with Roar or KO it with Thunderbolt. It needs to be careful of a boosted Outrage and a Choice Band Payback, but it can deal with the majority of Gyarados sets.</p> <p><strong>Very physically bulky Pokemon</strong>: Even if they do not resist Water, very bulky Pokemon such as physically defensive Skarmory, Jirachi, Cresselia, and Porygon2 can survive repeated attacks to either status, KO, or phase Gyarados. Porygon2, while uncommon, is perhaps the best answer in the game by bouncing Intimidate back and OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Tyranitar with a Passho Berry can survive any one boosted attack and OHKO it Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Offensive Suicune, Quagsire, Starmie, and opposing Gyarados can effective deal with Gyarados. Offensive Suicune is a fantastic check, as it survives any two hits and 2HKOs back with Hidden Power Electric. Starmie is similar, as it will survive any one hit and retaliate with Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave. Opposing Gyarados can use its Intimidate to weaken Gyarados and either attack it with Stone Edge or Ice Fang or phase it out with Roar. Quagsire is an excellent check, as it is immune to Waterfall and can use Encore or Toxic to wear it down or Counter to answer it directly. Other less common Water-types such as Milotic and Vaporeon can survive Gyarados's attacks easily as well.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Bulky Grass types such as Shaymin, Breloom, and Celebi are strong Gyarados answers. While they are hit fairly hard by Ice Fang and do not appreciate Bounce, all at least 2HKO Gyarados after Stealth Rock with either Seed Flare, Seed Bomb, or Grass Knot. Physically defensive Celebi especially is effective against Gyarados, as +1 Ice Fang does not 2HKO it, while Shaymin and Breloom can use Protect to dodge Bounce.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Both Dragon Dance Gyarados and defensive Gyarados despise Taunt. Taunt + Will-O-Wisp Gengar, Taunt + Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Taunt Skarmory all can be effective in keeping Gyarados from setting up or healing itself.</p> <p><strong>Status: While some Gyarados carry Lum Berry or Substitute and defensive Gyarados can heal status, paralysis, burn, and poison are catastrophic for Gyarados. Gyarados will often either faint very quickly or have its average speed be exposed by paralysis. Defensive Gyarados is forced to heal much more often if inflicted with status.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Gyarados is bulky enough to set up one Dragon Dance and start attacking. Waterfall is Gyarados's main means of doing damage, being able to break through the many walls that don't resist Water. From here, Gyarados can take advantage of its coverage options. The most common option is Ice Fang, as Gyarados struggles to damage Latias and Breloom with just Waterfall. However, since Ice Fang is fairly weak even when super-effective, Outrage is another, much more powerful option to OHKO Latias, Dragonite, Flygon, and Kingdra at +1. Beware that locking into Outrage can easily lead to Gyarados getting revenge killed and the confusion is debilitating without a Lum Berry. Gyarados can also use its most powerful option in Bounce to get excellent coverage with Waterfall, but since it’s a two-turn charge move, it can be taken advantage of.</p> <p>Gyarados has many options in its last slot. Gyarados often completes its coverage with Earthquake, as it hits Steel-types such as Jirachi, Empoleon, Metagross, and Magnezone super-effectively. However, since Ice Fang doesn’t hit opposing Gyarados and defensive Zapdos very hard, Stone Edge can be used to OHKO them after Stealth Rock. For more utility options, a common last choice is Thunder Wave, as Gyarados lures in Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom-A and Latias and cripples them with a paralysis so they can no longer check Gyarados. Another option is Taunt, as Gyarados can completely shut down walls such as Skarmory and Blissey trying to phase or status Gyarados. Typically, Earthquake and utility moves are used with Ice Fang or Bounce, while Stone Edge is used with Outrage for best coverage; however, this is not a hard and fast rule.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Gyarados gets the most out of maximum Attack and Speed EVs to outspeed Dragonite and hit as hard as possible. Gyarados can run some arbitrary bulk to better survive attacks, as it only needs 184 Speed EVs to outspeed Tyranitar before a Dragon Dance and Starmie at +1. An Adamant nature helps Gyarados hit as hard as possible—a Jolly nature is possible to outspeed slower Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Metagross, Magneton, and Heatran at +1 and Choice Scarf Latias at +2, but Gyarados loses a lot of power doing so and typically cannot get to +2 anyway.</p> <p>Gyarados has many possible items it can run to circumvent normal checks. The most prominent one is a Wacan Berry, as Gyarados can survive weaker Electric-type attacks and KO or heavily damage the foe, such as Choice Scarf Latias, Choice Scarf Flygon, Choice Scarf Jirachi, Choice Scarf Lucario, offensive Suicune, and Jirachi. 8 HP EVs and 16 Special Defense EVs let Gyarados survive Choice Scarf Rotom-A’s Thunderbolt without Stealth Rock. However, another option is Lum Berry, as a common way to beat Gyarados is paralyzing it with defensive Jirachi, poisoning it with Toxic, or burning it with Heatran as it tries to set up. Leftovers helps mitigate Gyarados’s weakness to residual damage; Leftovers is more common on sets with Bounce or utility moves such as Thunder Wave and Taunt to survive longer.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Unless Gyarados has Rapid Spin support, it should aim to hit the field relatively early before Stealth Rock is up, or even lead, and set up Dragon Dance. With the additional speed and power, Gyarados can break through defensive counterplay depending on its coverage. Once Gyarados is at +1, it generally should just attack unless there’s a specific reason to do so, as taking additional heavy damage getting to +2 often is not worth it. While Gyarados can sweep, it typically opens opposing teams for another offensive Pokemon to break through. Gyarados is fantastic at forcing predictable responses, like Latias or Skarmory being forced to switch in on Dragon Dance and either try to phase it or use Counter in Skarmory’s case. Taking advantage of these responses, either through Gyarados’s moveset choices or teammates, is critical to getting the most out of it.</p> <p>Gyarados can also be used a bit later in the game as a punishment for setting up Stealth Rock, as dealing with a full health Gyarados can be daunting. In this scenario, Gyarados typically comes in on a Pokemon that cannot really damage it like offensive Swampert. From here, Gyarados can break through the Choice Scarf Pokemon or even opposing offensive Gyarados tasked with checking it. This can open up the opposing team to other offensive threats.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Offensive Gyarados is a staple of the hyper offensive playstyle and has many viable partners. Gyarados is commonly paired alongside the other prominent Dragon Dance users in the tier of Dragonite and Tyranitar. Dragonite similarly appreciates anti-Stealth Rock measures, and both Dragon Dance and mixed sets are devastatingly powerful. Dragon Dance Tyranitar provides important defensive synergy for Gyarados’s weaknesses, as it sets up on Choice Scarf Latias and Choice Scarf Rotom-A. All three synergistically weaken walls such as Skarmory and defensive Jirachi so that one of them can sweep. Anti-Stealth Rock measures are fantastic alongside Gyarados. Taunt leads such as Azelf, Aerodactyl, Froslass, Skarmory, and Gallade as well as sleep leads such as Choice Scarf Breloom, Smeargle, and Choice Scarf Roserade are excellent partners to prevent Stealth Rock from going up immediately and wearing down Gyarados. Other synergetic offensive Pokemon such as offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Swords Dance Scizor, Heatran, Swords Dance Lucario, and Agility Metagross appreciate Gyarados wearing down walls for them to break through. All these Steel-types appreciate Gyarados potentially setting up on their weaknesses as well. Swords Dance Scizor with Pursuit is an especially synergetic partner, as it can potentially remove Latias and Choice Scarf Rotom-A. While offensive Dragon Dance Gyarados can fit with almost any offensive teammate due to its unique defensive prowess, it needs a good switch into Choice Scarf Rotom-A, as Gyarados cannot outspeed it and it will almost always OHKO it with Thunderbolt. While Tyranitar does help, other options such as the Ground-type Camerupt and Flygon are appreciated.</p> <p>Gyarados can also fit alongside more dedicated Rapid Spin support, such as from Forretress and offensive Starmie. Gyarados here typically aims to enter much later in the game to take advantage of weakened teams. Other common partners include defensive Empoleon, Swampert, Choice Scarf Latias, and Jirachi. Magnezone also helps deal with Steel-types that aren’t OHKOed by Earthquake and can retaliate with Explosion or status. Other prominent Magnezone offense teammates such as Choice Specs Latias and Gengar can work well this core.</p> "

        "name": "Defensive RestTalk",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Good defenses combined with Intimidate and an excellent array of resistances means that Gyarados can take on a defensive role. However, Gyarados lacks reliable recovery and can only heal itself through the combination of Rest and Sleep Talk. Rest helps Gyarados answer foes trying to deal with it through status, such as defensive Jirachi, various Toxic users such as Quagsire, and Heatran. Waterfall has no immunities and is Gyarados's most reliable attack. Even without investment, it 2HKOs frail or Water-weak foes such as Gengar, bulkless Tyranitar, Heatran, and Infernape.</p> <p>Roar is perhaps the most important move defensive Gyarados has, as it prevents offensive Pokemon from trying to set up on Gyarados and spreads entry hazard damage. Roar has great synergy with Sleep Talk, as if Gyarados is faster than the target and Sleep Talk uses Roar, Gyarados will phase the opposing Pokemon before it can do anything and get Gyarados closer to waking up.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP EVs caps Gyarados's HP off at 393, allowing it to switch into Stealth Rock five times. Defense is maximized and the remaining EVs are placed in Special Defense. Gyarados can spare some Special Defense EVs to better handle attackers like Heatran, such as 56 EVs to survive two non-Life Orb Shadow Ball from Gengar after Stealth Rock. Gyarados sits at a crowded speed tier and can invest some Speed EVs to use Roar before other Gyarados and outspeed Machamp and Swampert. However, avoid taking too many EVs away from its Defense, as it relies on Intimidate to augment its physical bulk and will struggle to wall what it needs to without heavy investment.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Especially if Stealth Rock is not up, Gyarados should switch in liberally to check Fighting-types, Swampert, Heatran, and Scizor. With Intimidate and its huge bulk, Gyarados is one of the best ways to stop opposing physical sweepers, especially if they cannot hit it super-effectively. Take advantage of this to use Roar to spread entry hazard damage and scout more of the opposing team. Keep Gyarados far away from Taunt users such as opposing Gyarados and Skarmory, as they will set up on it with impunity. Intimidate is an incredible tool: do not be afraid to find creative ways to weaken opposing attackers to set up entry hazards or help a teammate heal up.</p> <p>Should Stealth Rock be up, Gyarados should be much more careful about when it switches in. Gyarados struggles to check powerful attackers such as Swords Dance Lucario and Infernape repeatedly especially if they switch out before Gyarados can heal. This will force Gyarados to use Rest often and be vulnerable to offensive pressure and unreliable Sleep Talk rolls. Smart sequencing from Gyarados's teammates can limit the number of times that Gyarados must switch in and check something with Stealth Rock up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rapid Spin support is mandatory when using defensive Gyarados; it simply is not consistent enough to use without it and other defensive Pokemon such as Latias and Skarmory are better walls if Stealth Rock is up. By far the best partner for Gyarados is specially defensive Forretress, as it has the best synergy with Gyarados as a spinner and sets up entry hazards. Gyarados resists Forretress’s Fire-type weakness and answers sweepers trying to set up on Forretress. Other spinners such as Starmie and Donphan are more commonly used alongside Zapdos, which occupies a similar niche as a defensive Flying-type. Gyarados appreciates walls that can switch into its weaknesses, mainly Electric-types and sweepers with Rock-type coverage. Clefable, Latias, and Blissey are fantastic answers against offensive Pokemon with Electric-type coverage, such as Rotom-A, Zapdos, and Suicune. Clefable can spread Knock Off effectively, exacerbating entry hazard damage, while Blissey can absorb powerful attackers such as Choice Specs Latias and Empoleon that heavily threaten Gyarados while also appreciating Rapid Spin. Latias is an excellent teammate, as Gyarados takes on many of its defensive duties, allowing it to use more offensive sets such as a two attacks Calm Mind with Hidden Power Fire. Gyarados enjoys another physically defensive Pokemon, such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Jirachi, that can ease its burden, especially if Stealth Rock is up. All these Pokemon check Tyranitar with Stone Edge well for Gyarados, while Gyarados phases out itself and absorbs Breloom’s Spore. Other defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-A and Celebi can be effective partners with Gyarados, as Rotom-A helps spread burn with Will-O-Wisp and blocks Rapid Spin while Celebi helps Gyarados take on offensive Water-types.</p> <p>Gyarados’s ability to check many physical sweepers affords defensive teams flexibility among its teammates. Some example partners include Cresselia to better answer strong attackers such as Dragonite and Flygon, Hitmontop to form a double Intimidate core, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar for speed control, Pursuit trapping Starmie to keep entry hazards up, and handling Electric-types such as Rotom-A and Zapdos. Other defensive Pokemon that appreciate Rapid Spin support such as Heatran and Breloom can potentially fit alongside Gyarados.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Gyarados is perfectly capable of using a Choice Band to surprise some of its potential counters. Waterfall is incredibly powerful with a Choice Band boost, 2HKOing many defensive that do not resist Water such as Rotom-A and special defensive Skarmory after Stealth Rock. Payback is what Gyarados uses to beat many of its counters, 2HKOing Celebi after Stealth Rock and OHKOing Rotom-A, Latias, and Starmie as they switch in. Stone Edge hits Flying-types that resist Water, such as other Gyarados and Dragonite. Earthquake prevents Empoleon, Magnezone, and Metagross from walling Gyarados, OHKOing Empoleon and Magnezone and 2HKOing Metagross.</p> <p>Ice Fang is an alternate option, hurting Breloom who would otherwise wall Gyarados, as well as being more accurate than Stone Edge as a move for hurting Flying types. Gyarados can also use Sleep Talk, typically alongside Ice Fang and over Payback to hit Breloom, so it can still function when absorbing Breloom’s Spore, but doing so loses out on critical coverage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Gyarados should run as much Attack EVs and Speed EVs as possible with an Adamant nature, as it is primarily an early game attacker and lure and struggles to switch in repeatedly. The additional Speed EVs help outspeed its crowded Speed tier, as many Pokemon such as defensive Zapdos, defensive Jirachi, Heatran, and Dragonite aim for a 244 Speed stat to outspeed Tyranitar. If this is unimportant, Gyarados can use some arbitrary HP EVs to better take attacks, as it only needs 184 Speed EVs to hit this 244 Speed stat.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Band Gyarados is most commonly in the lead spot or comes in early in the game to attack before Stealth Rock is up. In the lead position, Gyarados should attack whatever is in front of it; leverage the common Dragon Dance lead set to pick up surprise KOs. If Gyarados is forced out without revealing Choice Band, predicting a common answer such as Latias or Rotom-A and hitting them with Payback can be devastating. Once these bulky checks are removed, Gyarados can repeatedly use its powerful Waterfall to break through opponents. Once its set is revealed, Gyarados should be used aggressively, as it has no recovery and cannot boost its average speed. Creatively using Intimidate to set another Pokemon up and sacrificing it to give a free switch or damage a wall are all worthwhile options.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Band Gyarados is primarily a wallbreaker; its goal is to open holes early for other attackers to take advantage. Pokemon who take advantage of weakened or KOed Rotom-A, Latias, Zapdos, and Celebi are excellent partners. One of the best partners is Swords Dance or other offensive Empoleon, as it struggles to deal with Latias and other Water-resists and its typing attracts Ground- and Fighting-type attacks for Gyarados to switch in on. Another common option is to use multiple strong Water-types, such as Swampert and offensive Starmie, to break through the opposing Water-resists. Offensive Starmie can also use Rapid Spin for Gyarados to switch in more easily, as Choice Band Gyarados struggles to fit alongside more dedicated spinners. Other offensive Fighting-types such as Breloom and Lucario as well as other sweepers such as Swords Dance Gliscor are also helpful. Breloom is especially useful against the defensive Water-types such as Suicune, Quagsire, and Milotic that can absorb multiple hits from Gyarados. One way to mitigate Gyarados’s weakness to residual damage is Wish or Healing Wish, and defensive Jirachi is one of the best providers of it. Jirachi can even run Thunder to further help Gyarados break through physically defensive Skarmory. Latias is an excellent partner, as even more offensive sets such as Choice Scarf can provide Healing Wish support for Gyarados to continue wallbreaking. Along this idea, Gyarados appreciates Choice Scarf revenge killers such as Rotom-A and Flygon should it be locked into a bad move. Utility Tyranitar sets with Pursuit can finish off Rotom-A and Latias should Gyarados be unable to beat them with Payback. It can wear down Skarmory and Breloom with Fire Blast for Gyarados while also providing defensive backbone against Electric-types that force Gyarados out.</p> "

  "Vaporeon": {
    "overview": "<p>Vaporeon is among the few Pokemon who can claim to be a true bulky Water-type Pokemon of DPP OU. In a metagame rife with residual damage from sandstorm, entry hazards, and more, having a bulky Water-type Pokemon with the ability to pass Wish is invaluable to any team. Within a tier of heavyweights, Vaporeon shines as one of the few Water-types that take minuscule damage from Grass Knot, making it a terrific Infernape counter. Vaporeon is also the best Water-type to switch into other Water-type Pokemon due to its ability, Water Absorb.</p> <p>Despite its unique attributes as a Water-type, Vaporeon has serious issues with various moves and threats. Vaporeon is deathly afraid of Toxic, as unlike Suicune, it will typically be unable to Rest away the status. Additionally, Vaporeon has issues with its inability to instantly heal itself like Milotic, which can be exploited by opponents. Vaporeon is often the opponent's first target, given Vaporeon's essential support role on teams that use it; teams tend to collapse after Vaporeon has been felled. If you choose Vaporeon for your team, it's important to do so with its specialties in mind, but in any case it will perform the chosen job admirably.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Vaporeon has some interesting options that it can use in its sets, but generally what you see is what you get in the above sets. Muddy Water can be used over Surf just about anywhere for its secondary effect, but the reduced accuracy is an enormous turnoff. Haze can be useful as a means of removing stat boosts from last-Pokemon Suicune, but generally Roar is the better choice for racking up entry hazard damage in the earlier game. Heal Bell is usable for supporting the team and keeping Vaporeon safe from status, Toxic in particular, but most sets simply do not have room for it and other Pokemon function better as dedicated clerics. Fake Tears can be useful for forcing additional switches, but Vaporeon almost always has more useful things to be doing with its moveslots. A set based around Curse could work in some instances, but Umbreon does it better, and that says something because Umbreon barely does it well at all in the first place.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Various Pokemon can be a menace to Vaporeon. Grass-types, such as Shaymin, Celebi, Breloom, and Roserade, can switch in with very little care if Vaporeon lacks Ice Beam. Similarly, Electric-types like Rotom-A, Jolteon, and Zapdos can get in on neutral Surf with their respectable bulk and use their STAB moves to hit Vaporeon for super effective damage, and in some cases, score the OHKO. Opposing Vaporeon make great switch-ins, since Vaporeon lacks ways to significantly damage itself without the help of Toxic. Without Hidden Power Electric, Taunt Gyarados has free reign to set up Dragon Dances, and the likes of Empoleon and Tentacruel will have no problems switching in and setting up as well. Roar helps a lot against Kingdra, who can otherwise use Dragon Dance on Vaporeon without anything to worry about; Roar is also a good option to deal with bulky Water-types such as Calm Mind Suicune and the aforementioned Empoleon. Blissey, of course, is a nightmare for Vaporeon since she can sponge all of its attacks thanks to her massive HP and Special Defense stats; however, Toxic can seriously threaten Blissey and eventually force her to switch out.</p> ",

        "name": "Wish Support",
        "description": "<p>With a great base 130 HP stat, decent defenses, and access to a useful move in Wish, Vaporeon becomes an incredible support member in the OU metagame. Vaporeon can heal those who lack a recovery move and generally keeps the team at a good level of health. Pokemon like Dragonite and Gyarados, who are constant victims of Stealth Rock, appreciate Wish in any case.</p> <p>Protect is the second most important move of the set, because it allows Vaporeon to reliably heal itself and keep passing Wishes. Also, Protect is a handy move for scouting purposes and restores HP thanks to Leftovers. Surf is the obligatory STAB move, and keeps Gliscor, physically defensive Skarmory, Infernape, and Heatran at bay. The last moveslot has several notable options. With Hidden Power Electric, Vaporeon becomes one of the best counters to Gyarados, even those who carry Taunt, and can deal with other opposing Water-types. On the other hand, Ice Beam keeps Dragonite, and Grass-type Pokemon in general, in check. You can also use Toxic, which when coupled with Wish and Protect makes Vaporeon able to stall numerous Pokemon that it can't harm greatly, such as specially bulky Pokemon and Pokemon who resist Surf.</p> <p>Vaporeon has two other great moves it can use to help aid its team: Roar and Heal Bell. Vaporeon makes a great user of Roar, stopping several Pokemon from setting up and sweeping. As for Heal Bell, it makes Vaporeon a very effective cleric, curing its team and itself of status ailments.</p> <p>The reason why the EV spread makes special emphasis on Vaporeon's HP and Defense stats is to enhance its overall bulk and turn it into a more reliable Wish Passer. 248 HP EVs combined with 224 Defense EVs and Bold nature are used in order to improve Vaporeon's physical defense and provide it with the necessary bulk to take hits from the likes of Gyarados and Infernape better, as well as give it ultimate overall bulk. The Special Defense EVs also allow this. While the given HP EVs do not make a Leftovers number, you can use 188 HP EVs to achieve this and place the remaining EVs in Defense.</p> <p>Since Vaporeon is very durable, it is a good idea to couple it with offensive Pokemon who appreciate Wish, such as Dragonite and Gyarados. That way, they will have an easier time switching in and more opportunities to set up Dragon Dances. Others who concentrate on defense, such as Celebi and Gliscor, are great partners for Vaporeon too, because they can cover each other's weaknesses very well.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Vaporeon is usually seen as a bulky Wish passer, but many people forget its fantastic 110 base Special Attack. With Choice Specs, Vaporeon becomes an admirable offensive Pokemon that fits very well on offensive teams that could use Wish support.</p> <p>Surf, Vaporeon's primary attacking option, is a reliable STAB move that, when boosted by Choice Specs, becomes enormously powerful. Hydro Pump is an alternative to Surf that allows Vaporeon to hit considerably harder. For instance, with Stealth Rock in play, 0 HP Jirachi, 252 HP / 0 Special Defense Rotom-A, and even specially defensive Skarmory are OHKOed by Hydro Pump. Ice Beam and Hidden Power Electric provide additional type coverage, dispatching most Grass- and Water-types who resist Surf, such as Celebi and Gyarados, respectively. Wish is the recommended option for the last slot, as it gives Vaporeon the opportunity to set up Wish against a threatened opponent and heal one of its teammates that better handles the opponent's switch-in. Wish can also be used to heal Vaporeon itself, though use it at your own risk as Vaporeon may be set up on by the opponent. Signal Beam is another move to consider, mainly in order to annihilate Celebi, although Ice Beam already does a lot of damage to it.</p> <p>The EVs and nature are pretty straightforward. Maximizing Vaporeon's Special Attack is the first detail to consider for the set, so 252 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature put this stat to the highest possible level, reaching 525 Special Attack. The 44 Speed EVs allow Vaporeon to outspeed minimum Speed Skarmory. The rest of the EVs are placed into Vaporeon's Defense, thus retaining some bulk to take a few hits.</p> <p>Most of the time, offensive teams appreciate Wish support, and Choice Specs Vaporeon is a great candidate for this type of teams, because it doesn't slow down any offensive momentum. Pokemon such as Dragonite and Gliscor are great partners for Vaporeon, since they cover each other's weaknesses very well while maintaining a strong line of offensive power. Offensive partners who defeat Blissey are also good Pokemon to couple Vaporeon with, since she walls Vaporeon with no problems at all. Breloom and Machamp make two fine partners for Vaporeon, because they can easily get rid of Blissey with their respective STAB moves. Entry hazard support is also welcome, as it helps Vaporeon to score more OHKOs while helping its whole team in general. Skarmory and Forretress can both set up Spikes and cover Vaporeon's Grass weakness. Forretress also has access to Rapid Spin, which is useful as it prevents Vaporeon, as well as your team in general, from getting into contact with entry hazards. On top of this, Forretress has Explosion available to it, allowing it to potentially bring down a dangerous foe.</p> "

However, if you play to his strengths, he can be a very effective sweeper, even in today's metagame.</p> <p>Jolteon can pull off a variety of different sets, ranging from an all-out sweeper to a slightly less offensive team support set, or anything in between. With access to one of the fastest Baton Passes, as well as one of the strongest Electric-type attacks in OU, Jolteon can be very effective if he is used correctly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Wish, Agility, and Charge Beam are all options Jolteon can Baton Pass, but Jolteon is severely outclassed when attempting to pass each of these. Jolteon also has Roar, but its negative priority coupled with Jolteon's frailty makes it an unattractive option. Yawn can be used to support the team and help with passing Substitutes, but it is hard to find room for it. Jolteon can even run its own Substitute + 3 Attacks set, although this has lackluster power and is easy to work around without Charge Beam. Thunder can be used in tandem with a Rain Dance team, since Jolteon learns Rain Dance and has an Electric-type immunity. In terms of EVs, Jolteon can afford to slip down to 392 Speed, since that puts it above +1 Adamant Gyarados, although the leftover EVs aren't better placed anywhere else. Jolteon can run 232 Speed EVs to hit a stat of 374, outspeeding everyone who isn't Choice Scarfed bar Weavile and Aerodactyl, but again, there isn't much use for the extra EVs.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The Baton Pass set is difficult to counter directly since it will just Baton Pass at the first sign of danger; however, the sweeper sets are easier to stop. It depends on which Hidden Power Jolteon is carrying - Hidden Power Ice means Swampert and Mamoswine can stop him with ease, while Hidden Power Grass means Flygon and Gliscor will have no problems. Any Jolteon without Signal Beam or Shadow Ball is stopped by Celebi. Electivire can switch into Jolteon easily, and if he grabs a Motor Drive boost, can outspeed and threaten him with Earthquake. Porygon2 can Trace Volt Absorb and stall Jolteon out, as can Gardevoir, although she must be wary of Shadow Ball.</p> <p>Jolteon himself--or any other Electric-type, for that matter--can easily wall Jolteon, as can any dedicated special wall.

The recoil isn't much of a problem either, since in OU, Jolteon is outsped only by Ninjask and random Choice Scarf users, while he ties with other Jolteon and Aerodactyl. Hidden Power Grass is the main option since the likes of Mamoswine and Swampert will provide the most trouble. After a Charge Beam boost, Shadow Ball will 2HKO Gliscor and Flygon, although you must watch out for Earthquake on Choice Scarf Flygon, since he outspeeds you.</p> <p>Again, Blissey and Snorlax are problems, and trying to accumulate more Charge Beam boosts to break through isn't recommended without Substitute. Electivire also troubles this set, since if he absorbs Charge Beam, you don't earn a Special Attack boost and he gains a Motor Drive boost instead. Weakened Tyranitar can be dealt with after by a boosted Thunderbolt, but full health Tyranitar is still threatening. Starmie is a great partner since it can OHKO Swampert using Grass Knot and with Hydro Pump, can OHKO and 2HKO Gliscor and Tyranitar respectively. Naturally, avoid Ground-types switching in on Charge Beam.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ice is once again an option over Hidden Power Grass to hit Flygon and Dragonite on the switch and to try and OHKO Gliscor. If you want to try and beat Pokemon like Blissey, Substitute can be used over Thunderbolt. Substitute also provides a buffer against status and allows Jolteon to scout for Flygon or Electivire before trying to score a boost; however, it leaves the inaccurate and weaker Charge Beam as your only STAB attack.</p> "
      },

        "name": "Baton Pass",
        "description": "<p>Jolteon is the second fastest user of the Substitute + Baton Pass strategy, and he can provide great support to many sweepers, since the buffer of a Substitute gives them a better chance to set up. Thunderbolt is the mandatory STAB attack of choice. Hidden Power Ice is chosen for exceptional coverage with Thunderbolt and because with a Substitute, you will have a better chance of removing Flygon and Gliscor before Baton Passing. In addition to this, the standard targets of Hidden Power Grass, Swampert and Mamoswine, aren't OHKOed without a boost.</p> <p>This set is a lot harder to counter since Hidden Power Ice can OHKO the likes of Flygon and Dragonite, and if Mamoswine or Swampert comes in, Jolteon can easily Baton Pass away. However, if you manage to Roar Jolteon before he can Baton Pass, then the strategy is disrupted. If Jolteon doesn't use Substitute on the switch, most Choice Scarf Pokemon can make quick work of it. The set can opt for 252 HP / 24 SpD / 232 Spe, as this allows the Substitute to survive Celebi's Grass Knot or Blissey's Ice Beam, but the drop in power is generally not worth it.</p> <p>Generally, the best receivers for Jolteon's Substitutes are Pokemon who either resist or are immune to Earthquake, since that is the most common attack aimed at Jolteon. Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite are especially great partners since they benefit from the lack of Flygon and Gliscor. Breloom and Lucario also make good recipients, being able to scare away Blissey and Snorlax.</p> <p>Despite being outclassed by Hidden Power Ice, Hidden Power Grass can be used since the removal of Swampert will benefit the above sweepers when they set up. Charge Beam and Wish can be used for more support, but generally will have trouble finding a spot over Thunderbolt or Hidden Power.</p> "

  "Kabutops": {
    "overview": "<p>Kabutops is one of the best Rain Dance sweepers in OU. With an Attack stat higher than Lucario's, it is no surprise that it is so powerful. This extra power combined with the usefulness of Stone Edge are Kabutops' main benefits over Qwilfish. The impressive combination of Water / Rock is not resisted by many, allowing Kabutops to rip through many teams with little effort. If you can keep the rain up, Kabutops will almost certainly do you proud, and if your opponent underestimates this beast, it will likely lead to their demise.</p> <p>There are Pokemon who can cause it a few problems, but usually once Kabutops gets a Swords Dance off, your opponent better get ready for a painful experience.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Return and Aerial Ace are other attacking options for Kabutops, but have limited use in OU; a +2 Waterfall in the rain OHKOes most Breloom anyway. Kabutops can use a Focus Sash and set up Stealth Rock in the lead position, but there are better options for doing this in OU and for a Rain Dance team; it is better to stick to Azelf, Crobat, Electrode, or Jirachi for leading. Kabutops can set up Rain Dance itself, but the loss of a moveslot hurts it and there are better Pokemon to do this. Kabutops can use Endure / Substitute + Flail, but priority and the abundance of Choice Scarf users makes this hard to set up. Rapid Spin could be useful to get rid of entry hazards, but this is better left to Forretress, Starmie, and Tentacruel in OU. Knock Off is an option since getting rid of an opponent's Leftovers could prove useful, but this has limited use in OU. Surf and Hidden Power are possibilities for use on a mixed set, but Kabutops can usually get through most physical walls by using Swords Dance anyway, and its low base 65 Special Attack makes this even more unappealing.</p> <p>Kabutops could run a Choice Band, sacrificing versatility for straight out power, but this is usually a bad idea since rain turns are precious and a misprediction when using a Choice Band could therefore prove costly. A Lum Berry could be used to stop status ending your sweep.</p> <p>Running maximum Speed is fine should you wish to Speed tie with Adamant Mamoswine and outspeed the rare Modest Heatran. When using a Jolly nature, running maximum Speed is best as this Speed ties with Jolly Mamoswine. Jolly and 236 Speed EVs will outspeed Adamant Lucario, while running 192 Speed EVs will outspeed neutral natured Kingdra and other neutral base 85 Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Not much can take repeated hits from Kabutops so it often depends on the move choice. Celebi is among the best counters if Kabutops lacks X-Scissor as even with Stealth Rock, it almost always survives a +2 Stone Edge and can then OHKO Kabutops with Grass Knot. Very bulky Breloom can deal with most Kabutops since a +2 Waterfall in the rain only does 66.6% - 78.4% to 236 HP / 248 Def +Defense nature Breloom, allowing it to easily take a hit then Seed Bomb Kabutops for the OHKO. Defensive Empoleon also does well since Waterfall can only manage 75.8% maximum at +2 in the rain, allowing Empoleon to take a hit and OHKO Kabutops with Grass Knot. More offensive Empoleon can do decently, but they have a chance of being OHKOed by a +2 Waterfall in the rain.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types, such as Suicune, Swampert, and Vaporeon, can do decently as long as Kabutops has not got a Swords Dance up, although non-offensive Suicune and Vaporeon will need Kabutops to be slightly weakened to OHKO it. Choice Scarf Gengar can outspeed and OHKO most Kabutops, but it generally can't switch in directly. Scizor can use Bullet Punch to finish off a weakened Kabutops, but it must be in high health to take an Aqua Jet in the rain from a +2 Kabutops. Shaymin can do well against Kabutops if Bold and with maximum or close to maximum HP and Defense EVs, as it will almost always survive a +2 Stone Edge, even with Stealth Rock support, and has around a 50% chance to survive a +2 X-Scissor with Stealth Rock up. It can then easily OHKO Kabutops with Seed Flare. Non-bulky versions of Shaymin won't like Kabutops at +2, but they otherwise can take a hit and OHKO Kabutops with Seed Flare.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Kabutops is a truly fearsome Swords Dance sweeper in OU when Rain Dance is in effect, and this set aims to take full advantage of that. Waterfall and Stone Edge are the primary moves on this set, providing an awesome attacking combination as the only two Pokemon commonly used in OU who resist both types are Breloom and Empoleon. Aqua Jet finishes off the set by allowing Kabutops to OHKO Infernape before it hits you with Mach Punch or Vacuum Wave. Not to mention it does 74% minimum to Choice Scarf Gengar without a Swords Dance boost, who outspeeds you even in the rain. Most important of all, it can hit Scizor before it Bullet Punches you, although it will need to be weakened a bit for you to OHKO it at +2 in the rain, as it does 74.3% - 87.8%. Priority is also just a useful thing to have in general since the rain won't always be up. When it is raining, Waterfall will have a massive 180 Base Power with Aqua Jet at 90 thanks to the boost to Water-type moves provided by the weather.</p> <p>Unlike Qwilfish, Kabutops has a higher Attack stat and access to Stone Edge which gives it an easier time against bulky Water- and Dragon-types, such as Gyarados and Dragonite. While Qwilfish may have a powerful Explosion and the ability to absorb Toxic Spikes on entry, it usually won't do as much damage to your opponent's team as Kabutops can. Although Aqua Jet is generally the preferred option in the last slot, there are some other possibilities. X-Scissor can be used since it has a high chance of OHKOing Celebi with Stealth Rock support, even before a Swords Dance. It also provides a more accurate attack to hit Starmie with, rather than relying on Stone Edge's shaky accuracy. Low Kick, Superpower, and Brick Break are some Fighting-type alternatives that hit Empoleon for super effective damage and hit most Fighting-weak Pokemon harder than Waterfall. Aqua Tail can replace Waterfall if you want even more power, at the cost of 10% accuracy, but Waterfall is usually strong enough and the accuracy loss from Aqua Tail can hurt at times. Also, the 20% flinch rate can be useful at times. Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge since it has slightly more reliable accuracy and a nice flinch rate, but the loss of power makes it unappealing.</p> <p>The EVs are aimed at making Kabutops hit hard, while outspeeding as many important foes as possible. Max Attack is obvious, while 204 Speed EVs allows Kabutops to hit 247 Speed, outrunning anyone up to and including +1 +nature base 100s, assuming Rain Dance is in effect. When rain isn't up, it will outspeed Choice Scarf-less Tyranitar, and many others trying to just outspeed Tyranitar. 32 HP EVs give a Life Orb number, while the rest is put into Defense to take physical hits slightly better. An Adamant nature is preferred for the extra power, but a Jolly nature can be used should you wish to outrun Timid Choice Scarf Gengar while rain is up, and also outrun neutral natured Gyarados, Kingdra, and Lucario regardless of whether the rain is up or not. Swift Swim is the obvious ability since it doubles Kabutops' Speed to impressive levels, while Life Orb is used for the extra power that is necessary against important threats, such as Skarmory.</p> <p>Kabutops' teammates should all be centered around either sweeping in Rain Dance or setting it up. All versions of Kingdra are great partners to Kabutops for a few reasons. Mixed versions can easily OHKO Breloom with Draco Meteor and often OHKO standard 252 HP Celebi with Signal Beam, assuming Stealth Rock is up. Both Dragon Dance and special versions can outspeed and OHKO Timid Choice Scarf Gengar in the rain, who causes Kabutops problems. The special versions can also lure in both Celebi and Empoleon, always OHKOing the former with Signal Beam (with Stealth Rock support) and 2HKOing offensive versions of the latter with Hidden Power Electric, allowing Kabutops an easier time sweeping. Ludicolo is a great partner since it can deal with bulky Water-types who can trouble Kabutops if it can't get a Swords Dance up. It can also Ice Beam Breloom to its grave. Qwilfish works effectively as a partner since it OHKOes Celebi 100% of the time at +2 with a STAB Poison Jab. Also, they have similar Pokemon who trouble them, and Qwilfish Exploding on one of them could give Kabutops a chance to sweep.</p> <p>The Rain Dance supporters who partner up best with Kabutops are those who resist its weaknesses to Electric-, Fighting-, Grass-, and Ground-type moves. Levitate Bronzong is immune to Ground-type attacks and resists Grass-type attacks, so it makes a great partner. It is also one of, if not the best, mid-game Rain Dance replenishers due to its lack of multiple weaknesses and great defenses. Jolteon, Magnezone, Rotom-W, and Zapdos are all effective partners as they all resist many of the moves which trouble Kabutops and can fire off powerful Thunders at some of the troublesome bulky Water-types, such as Suicune. Scizor can take the Grass-type attacks aimed at Kabutops and also use Bullet Punch to deal with Abomasnow and Tyranitar whose abilities clear the rain, as well as having super effective Bug-type attacks to hit Celebi and Starmie with.</p> "

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>Aerodactyl is one of the premier leads in DPP OU in controlling the early entry hazard game, as it has access to Taunt and is the fastest Stealth Rock user in the tier outside of Choice Scarf Pokemon. These qualities make Aerodactyl a great candidate for hyper offensive teams, as it notably prevents fast leads such as Azelf and Choice Scarf Tyranitar from setting up Stealth Rock. This is critical for maximizing teammates weak to entry hazards including Gyarados and Dragonite, and also potentially enabling Focus Sash users outside of the lead slot, such as Heatran and Tyranitar. Alternatively, Aerodactyl can venture from the lead position by making use of its great Speed not only offensively but defensively as well. Offensive Aerodactyl outruns the majority of the metagame, including prominent set up sweepers such as Gyarados and Dragonite after a Dragon Dance. It can also use its fast Taunt, sand immunity, and recovery to take advantage of stall teams. Defensively, Aerodactyl can use the SubRoost strategy effectively to be a complete annoyance against any team, provided it has the correct support.</p> <p>Aerodactyl is otherwise niche in DPP OU and must have a specific reason to be used. While it easily fulfills its niche of preventing set up and getting up Stealth Rock, it faces tough competition from Azelf. Other than Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Azelf is faster than almost all other leads, has access to Explosion, and is much more versatile. Aerodactyl's many common weaknesses and inability to boost its Attack make it struggle outside of the lead slot. Many of the common Steel-types of DPP OU, such as Jirachi, Metagross, Bronzong, and especially Scizor can stomach its attacks and remove Aerodactyl easily. Aerodactyl also struggles to break through bulky Pokemon resistant to Rock, such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Breloom.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aerodactyl can also use Rock Tomb on the lead set, especially if it does not have maximum Speed to prevent opposing Aerodactyl from setting up Stealth Rock. Power Herb + Sky Attack can be used to surprise Fighting-types trying to take advantage of Aerodactyl's weak coverage. Pursuit can be used to trap and remove foes like Gengar and even Rotom-A.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-resistant Pokemon: Steel-, Fighting-, and Ground-types all resist Aerodactyl's best attacking moves, Stone Edge and Rock Slide. Bronzong completely stops offensive Aerodactyl and can potentially set up Stealth Rock, while faster Steel-types like Choice Scarf Jirachi and Choice Scarf Lucario can find opportunities to pivot in and force Aerodactyl out. Other variants of Lucario commonly pack Bullet Punch, which can OHKO Aerodactyl after Stealth Rock damage. Even though many Steel-types are weak to Earthquake, Aerodactyl's attacks are quite weak: Steel-types such as Jirachi, Metagross, and Empoleon can shrug off a weak Earthquake and OHKO or 2HKO Aerodactyl in return. Breloom resists both Rock- and Ground-type attacks and devastates it with Seed Bomb, Superpower, or Focus Punch. Machamp takes negligible damage from Earthquake and can destroy it with DynamicPunch, Stone Edge, or Ice Punch. Hippowdon can use Ice Fang to force Aerodactyl out, and Swampert can use Water- or Ice-type moves to do the same.</p> <p><strong>Anti-Leads: Lead Metagross, Jirachi, Empoleon, and Swampert can make it difficult for Aerodactyl to both prevent Stealth Rock from going up and set it up for its team.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Celebi, Latias, Rotom-A, Suicune, Milotic, Quagsire, and even Tyranitar have enough physical bulk to switch in while healthy and force Aerodactyl out with the threat of super effective attacks or status moves.</p> <p><strong>Priority Move Users: Scizor, Lucario, Metagross, Abomasnow, Weavile, and Mamoswine all carry super effective priority moves that can do major damage to Aerodactyl. Scizor is especially painful, as Bullet Punch always OHKOes and it can easily survive Aerodactyl's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users: Choice Scarf Rotom-A, Lucario, Flygon, Latias, and Jirachi can outpace Aerodactyl and revenge kill it with strong attacks.</p> ",

        "name": "Lead",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Against the perpetually changing OU metagame, Aerodactyl has consistently filled its niche as one of the best suicide leads. This niche is made up of Stealth Rock, Taunt, and its Speed. Aerodactyl is faster than almost every other common lead, and so can Taunt to prevent setting up in any way. From here, it can get Stealth Rock up and then faint. Aerodactyl's remaining options help it faint as soon as possible. Double-Edge allows Aerodactyl to finish itself off after doing its job, especially if it is down to 1 HP due to its Focus Sash. Fainting due to recoil has some advantages: it prevents the opponent from using Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock, it allows a teammate to take advantage of a foe under the influence of Taunt, and most importantly it gives a free switch. Substitute allows Aerodactyl to avoid status effects that could allow the opponent to use Stealth Rock. This is most notable against Jirachi trying to neutralize Aerodactyl with Body Slam and Iron Head. It also lowers Aerodactyl's health to further facilitate fainting. However, Aerodactyl's Speed and coverage can be difficult to answer for more frail offenses, as it can often outspeed the entire team. With this, it can use Rock Slide and Earthquake to threaten foes such as Gyarados, Dragonite, and Tyranitar effectively. It can also take advantage of the coverage to threaten Rock- and Ground-weak Pokemon in the lead slot such as Zapdos and Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Aerodactyl's EV spread can go in two different directions: the first is to go no bulk and use Focus Sash. Aerodactyl can rarely take more than a hit or two, meaning Focus Sash lets it survive to do its job. It not only gives Aerodactyl a second chance if Taunt is mispredicted, but also allows it to survive hits from faster Pokemon. Speed and Attack are maximized to make it as fast as possible so it can guarantee to use Stealth Rock before its foe, and as powerful as possible to either faint faster with Double-Edge or attack with Rock Slide and Earthquake.</p> <p>Another direction to go in is invest in Aerodactyl's bulk to stave off defensive Jirachi. Jirachi is a difficult opponent for Aerodactyl to face, as it can easily set up Stealth Rock or use Body Slam to paralyze Aerodactyl and then remove it Iron Head before it sets up Stealth Rock. Aerodactyl can use a 128 HP / 236 Def / 144 Spe EV spread with a Jolly nature and Lum Berry to survive Jirachi's Body Slam and Iron Head. Aerodactyl can then use Taunt and set up Stealth Rock. This EV spread still outspeeds Azelf and Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Lum Berry also helps against status leads such as Choice Scarf Roserade, Machamp, and Choice Scarf Breloom if not running maximum Speed. Beware of strong leads such as Metagross, Empoleon, and Choice Specs Latias just OHKOing Aerodactyl, though.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Aerodactyl should be very aggressive in using Taunt on potential Stealth Rock leads, such as Hippowdon, Swampert, Jirachi, and Skarmory. Some common counters to watch out for are Choice Scarf Jirachi, Metagross, and Empoleon, which can 2HKO Aerodactyl with Iron Head, Meteor Mash + Bullet Punch, and Hydro Pump + Aqua Jet respectively. Aerodactyl should then try to lay Stealth Rock and then either faint as soon as possible or switch to be death fodder. It is strongly encouraged to carry pivots for bulkier leads as Aerodactyl can't deal significant damage to them. Aerodactyl must also watch out for other lead Aerodactyl, as whichever wins the Speed tie gains an immediate advantage. If one is fighting an opposing Aerodactyl, it would be wise to attempt to Taunt first to stop it from setting up Stealth Rock unless Aerodactyl doesn't have maximum Speed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Aerodactly's teammates should be aggressive to take advantage of a field clear of entry hazards. Offensive Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock such as Dragon Dance Dragonite, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Zapdos enjoy coming in at full health and with a free switch. Dragonite can also run a mixed set to heavily threaten opposing defensive teams that Aerodactyl can't damage effectively. Aerodactyl can facilitate Focus Sash users outside of the lead position, as it is the best option to prevent entry hazards in the tier while getting Stealth Rock up itself. This allows hyper offensive teams to survive revenge killing from otherwise difficult opponents, such as Choice Scarf Lucario and offensive Suicune. Common choices include offensive Heatran, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and Swords Dance Gliscor. Heatran is an especially synergetic partner, as it can immediately threaten Choice Scarf Jirachi trying to prevent Aerodactyl from doing anything. It also beats other leads that threaten Aerodactyl such as Metagross and Roserade; it can then use Taunt and Explosion to give another teammate a free switch.</p> <p>The team must have a fast enough pace that can sufficiently punish the opposing Stealth Rock user should it come in later to set it up. Other strong offensive Pokemon such as Infernape, Swords Dance Scizor, Rock Polish Metagross, Swords Dance Lucario, and offensive Empoleon appreciate Stealth Rock up and can maintain this pace. While Aerodactyl does appreciate strong Ghost-types to block Rapid Spin, such as Gengar and Rotom-A, it is difficult to afford with the pace of the team.</p> "

        "name": "Life Orb",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With great coverage in only two attacking moves, blistering Speed, and access to Roost and Taunt to beat stall teams, Aerodactyl fills a niche on offensive teams outside the lead spot.</p> <p>Stone Edge is Aerodactyl's primary Rock-type move and deals a lot of damage to Pokemon that do not resist it, while Earthquake completes the EdgeQuake combo, providing fantastic type coverage. Roost alleviates the weaknesses given by Aerodactyl's Flying typing, and lets it heal against weak special attacks such as Latias's Ice Beam.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With maximum Speed, Aerodactyl outspeeds every relevant non-boosted Pokemon in the metagame. In addition, Aerodactyl outpaces both neutral-natured +1 Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite. Some Speed EVs can be relocated towards HP to sustain Aerodactyl's ability to take special attacks in sandstorm while maintaining the capability to outrun certain threats. Specifically, a spread of 112 HP / 252 Atk / 144 Spe lets Aerodactyl outspeed the common Choice Scarf Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switch Aerodactyl into foes that have a hard time threatening it, like Skarmory, Choice Scarf Flygon locked into Earthquake, and Gliscor. Be mindful when using Stone Edge because the move only has 8 PP. Use Roost against weaker special attackers to keep Aerodactyl healthy. Try to get sand up through Tyranitar or Hippowdon before sending Aerodactyl in, as the increased Special Defense is crucial for staying in as long as possible and threatening the opposing team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazards and hard-hitting Pokemon both help Aerodactyl clean up. As Aerodactyl doesn't hit very hard, powerful teammates such as mixed Dragonite help Aerodactyl break down bulky walls, such as Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Swampert. Tyranitar and Magnezone are two great partners for Aerodactyl. The former provides sandstorm, which increases Aerodactyl's Special Defense and makes it one of the best Heatran switch-ins in the game; Tyranitar can also lure and remove some of Aerodactyl's counters, including Gliscor, Bronzong, and Breloom, with a mixed set. Magnezone traps pesky Steel-types such as Choice Scarf Jirachi and Scizor, which get in Aerodactyl's way. Starmie can provide Rapid Spin support, which assists Aerodactyl in dealing with its Stealth Rock weakness. Since Breloom can cause issues for Aerodactyl, Sleep Talk Latias is a good teammate that resists its Grass- and Fighting-type attacks as well as can take Spore.</p> "

        "name": "SubRoost",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Aerodactyl's Speed, resistances, and Pressure ability give it all the right tools to run a successful SubRoost set. The idea behind this set is to set up sand and bring in Aerodactyl on an attack it resists or is immune to, such as Fire Blast or Earthquake. From there, Aerodactyl can usually set up Substitute with its base 130 Speed stat and attempt to stall out the foe's PP with Pressure. To ensure that Aerodactyl can continue using Substitute, Roost is a necessity on the set.</p> <p>The other two attacks on the set are almost as important as Substitute and Roost. Taunt prevents foes from using any phazing or healing moves, which can be a major asset in conjunction with entry hazards. Rock Slide helps damage Flying-type or Levitating Pokemon that are immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>While most Aerodactyl should only focus on Attack and Speed, the SubRoost set is the only exception; it must capitalize on its defensive abilities along with keeping a steady amount of Speed. The Attack investment allows Aerodactyl to KO non-bulky Dragonite and Gyarados with Rock Slide after Stealth Rock and two turns of sandstorm, while the Speed investment lets it outrun Dragon Dance Gyarados; the rest is put in HP to better take hits.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is hugely important for sand to be up before taking advantage of this set. Not only does it increase Aerodactyl's Special Defense significantly but it also assists to wear down foes much quicker. With sandstorm boosting Aerodactyl's Special Defense to a respectable level, Aerodactyl can usually feel free to use Roost even when not protected by a Substitute. In a safer position, Aerodactyl can use Rock Slide to potentially make its opponents flinch to get extra Leftovers recovery.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Aerodactyl set clearly benefits from entry hazards and Knock Off support as well as strong defensive teammates, as Pressure and Taunt will cause havoc and force plenty of switches. Hippowdon and Tyranitar are necessary for the extra boost from sandstorm, as Aerodactyl is not very specially bulky without it. Specially defensive walls with Knock Off, such as Clefable and Empoleon, can facilitate wearing down the opponent and appreciate Aerodactyl switching into Heatran. Entry hazard support is hugely important to help wear down the foe. Skarmory, Forretress, and Roserade can provide Spikes, while Forretress, Roserade, and Nidoqueen can provide Toxic Spikes. Since Aerodactyl is trying to passively PP stall, it is particularly vulnerable to Rapid Spin. Defensive Rotom-A is an excellent Spinblocker and also can answer Breloom and Scizor, two huge threats to this set. As Aerodactyl can be forced out by common Pokemon such as Metagross, Machamp, Jirachi, and Tyranitar, it appreciates Rapid Spin support to alleviate its Stealth Rock weakness. The most common choice for this support is Forretress to further help with entry hazards, but Starmie is also quite effective.</p> "

With a STAB that is resisted by over one-third of the metagame, it's tough to see why you'd want to use Snorlax at all.</p> <p>Despite the nearly crippling faults mentioned above, Snorlax has a niche unlike any other Pokemon. He is the most durable offensively-inclined special tank in the metagame. This unique niche allows Snorlax to come into many of the special attackers in the metagame with near-impunity and have his way with them. While Snorlax isn't going to be winning any Best Pokemon awards with his faults, because of his assets, it's hard to deny him his rightful place in OU amongst the big boys.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Like most Normal-type Pokemon, Snorlax has an exceptionally diverse movepool with a lot of options. All of the special attacking options available to Snorlax, including Surf, Ice Beam, Shadow Ball, and Fire Blast, are pretty much worthless coming off of a pathetic base 65 Special Attack stat. It's always better to use Snorlax's physical options. Speaking of physical attacks, Snorlax has Ice Punch and Thunder Punch available to him. Against the Pokemon 4x weak to these moves, they are powerful, but against everything else, they're inferior to the listed options on each set. Snorlax also has Zen Headbutt, but there's really no reason to run it given that Snorlax can't outrun any of the Pokemon it might want to hit with the move.</p> <p>Despite the fact that Immunity is a good ability, Snorlax is typically using Self-Destruct to exit a battle or already taking advantage of Rest, which removes status. There is little reason to run Immunity on a Pokemon that plays like Snorlax, especially when Thick Fat allows Snorlax to check Heatran so effectively. However, if your team is particularly vulnerable to Toxic stalling and Snorlax isn't using Rest, you may elect to forgo Thick Fat for Immunity on Snorlax.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>All of the best responses to Snorlax are Pokemon with powerful Fighting-type attacks. Most, if not all, of these Pokemon hate being paralyzed though, so be mindful of switching into Body Slam recklessly. If they can get in safely, Infernape, Lucario, Machamp, and Heracross can all put Snorlax down in a jiffy. Strong and boosted physical attackers will also punch through Snorlax's defenses. With a Life Orb equipped, Pokemon like Metagross and Mamoswine can 2HKO Snorlax easily with their STAB attacks. Ghost-type Pokemon can switch into Snorlax's STAB attacks with ease and also generally pack Will-O-Wisp with which to burn Snorlax. A burned Snorlax is pretty much worthless offensively, so at that point you can proceed to switch in one of the Fighting-type Pokemon he hates facing. Lastly, there are a few Pokemon that can effortlessly wall Snorlax even if he attempts to set up. Skarmory can switch into even sets with Fire Punch, set up Spikes, and Roost off damage taken. Fire Punch boosted by either Curse or Choice Band is about the only thing Snorlax can do that actually stings Skarmory. Bronzong can come into Snorlax much like Skarmory, set up Stealth Rock, and then Explode if Snorlax tries to set up Curse. Forretress functions in a similar manner, but only if Snorlax lacks Fire Punch.</p> ",

        "name": "Curse",
        "description": "<p>What do you get when you combine rock-bottom Speed with high Attack and immense special bulk? You get the ideal Pokemon for a Curse set. Snorlax practically defined the use of Curse for sweeping in previous generations, and still carries the mantle admirably through DPP. The problem with Curse Snorlax these days is that everything else is so immensely powerful that even Snorlax's bulk isn't enough to save him from being ravaged. That aside, Curse Snorlax is still an immense threat and can set up against a surprisingly large chunk of the metagame.</p> <p>Curse is the only thing about this Snorlax that's set in stone. Body Slam versus Return is the classic status over power argument. Return hits much harder than Body Slam, but paralysis helps Snorlax more, so Body Slam is recommended. For a coverage move, it really is about picking your poison. Earthquake will deal with Tyranitar and grounded Steel-types, namely Heatran. Crunch will deal with the pesky Ghost-type Pokemon that are immune to Normal-type moves, while Fire Punch is for Skarmory, Bronzong, and any other Steel-type vulnerable to it. In the last slot, you get to decide how you want your Snorlax to go out. Either Snorlax can use STAB Self-Destruct and go out with an explosive bang the likes of which made the dinosaurs extinct, or he can use Rest to heal up and try to continue the sweep later. Rest without Sleep Talk makes it easy for opposing sweepers to set up on Snorlax, so it's wise to either carry a cleric on your team or avoid using it until you've dealt with the opponent's sweepers.</p> <p>The EV spread may seem entirely arbitrary, but each bit of investment plays an important part in optimizing Snorlax's stats. 216 Special Defense EVs gives Snorlax a bonus point, and when combined with 188 HP EVs and a Careful nature prevents Snorlax from ever being 3HKOed by Choice Specs Jolteon's Thunderbolt. The rest of the EVs are placed in Defense to buffer that stat after a few Curse boosts. More Defense EVs can be used at the player's discretion, but having sufficient Special Defense to set up on special threats is important. Thick Fat is chosen as it gives Snorlax some pseudo-resistances to switch in on, and most importantly lets Snorlax set up on Heatran locked into Fire Blast. Leftovers goes without saying on Snorlax, adding to his durability and restoring a metric boatload of HP per turn.</p> <p>Snorlax hates Fighting-type Pokemon above all others. Pokemon that can switch into Fighting-type attacks without consequence are excellent partners for Snorlax. Gyarados and Dragonite can both set up Dragon Dance against Infernape and Heracross locked into one of their STAB attacks. Zapdos and Rotom-A function more defensively, and will usually attack or cripple the Fighting-type right away. Most physical attackers will be very annoying to Snorlax during the early stages of his setup. For this reason, physically bulky partners like Skarmory or Forretress are good partners to consider. Both of them can lay down Spikes, which makes the switches Snorlax forces from special attackers that much more deadly. Lastly, without multiple Curse boosts, Snorlax is not going to be able to do much to Skarmory, Bronzong, Rotom-A, or Dusknoir. Heatran is a great response to both of those annoying Steel-types, and can even switch into the Will-O-Wisps from the Ghost-types for a Flash Fire boost. Strong Pursuit users, such as Tyranitar and Scizor, can eliminate the Ghost-types if they manage to avoid a burn.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Snorlax is a powerful Pokemon that forces a ton of switches. With a Choice Band, Snorlax can capitalize on his ability to wall special attackers and smash the switch-in for substantial damage. This is made even better by the fact that Snorlax can pack Pursuit and destroy the special sweepers that fail to break him when they run away. Starmie, Jolteon, Gengar, and Choice-locked Rotom-A all fall to Snorlax with appropriate prediction.</p> <p>Body Slam is preferred here to support Snorlax with paralysis so that it might actually outspeed something. Return, with a Choice Band boost, deserves a mention for being immensely more powerful than Body Slam. In the next slot, you are forced to choose between two of the best moves Snorlax has for this set. Due to Egg move / move tutor illegalities, Pursuit cannot be used with Self-Destruct. Pursuit allows Snorlax to checkmate Starmie and offensive Rotom-A and maim Jolteon if he tries to switch out. Self-Destruct, however, pretty much obliterates anything that isn't immune to it. Even most physically defensive Skarmory are OHKOed by it after Stealth Rock damage. Crunch is a definite must for 2HKOing the Ghost-types that will try to switch into Snorlax's Normal-type attacks. In the last slot, Earthquake and Fire Punch are both good options. Earthquake destroys Heatran and hits Metagross and Jirachi the hardest of all options. Fire Punch, however, does respectable damage to both Bronzong and Skarmory.</p> <p>Choice Band Snorlax likes hitting hard and being able to take hits. 252 EVs are placed in Attack to maximize his damage output, and 252 EVs are put in Special Defense to facilitate beating the special threats he's going to constantly switch into. An Adamant nature is used to boost his damage output even further. Thick Fat is always a good ability to add to Snorlax's resistance palette.</p> <p>When using Pursuit, pair this set with anything that enjoys having Starmie and friends removed. Infernape makes a particularly deadly force alongside Snorlax when Starmie is taken out of the picture. Snorlax still has issues with being easily revenge killed by Pokemon with powerful Fighting-type attacks. For this reason, Pokemon like Gyarados and Dragonite that can switch into them with some regularity are good partners. Even with coverage moves that hit Rotom-A and Skarmory, you're going to want to have another Pokemon to handle them. Heatran does this admirably and even absorbs Will-O-Wisp from defensive Rotom-A for a Flash Fire boost. Lastly, Spikes and Stealth Rock support will wear down common switch-ins rapidly, especially since Snorlax utterly walls most special attackers. Gliscor makes a very good choice for setting up Stealth Rock because he checks Lucario and other Fighting-type Pokemon fairly well.</p> "

        "name": "RestTalk",
        "description": "<p>Snorlax has just the right moves available to him to take advantage of his enormous bulk with a RestTalk set. Rest and Sleep Talk combine to give Snorlax some serious and much needed longevity. This Snorlax is effective at coming in on Pokemon that it effortlessly walls, forcing them out, and then shuffling the team further with Whirlwind. Whirlwind also doubles as a means to prevent a sleeping Snorlax from being setup fodder for Pokemon like Gyarados or Dragonite. Body Slam further deters opposing setup by threatening to paralyze anything it hits.</p> <p>With maximum HP and Defense EV investment and an Impish nature, Snorlax has almost perfectly balanced defensive stats. This allows him to come in on an assortment of Pokemon and threaten them with paralysis and phazing. Snorlax doesn't have to run Whirlwind if that doesn't suit your team. Generally speaking, phazing is the way to go with this set considering how pitiful Snorlax's damage output is, but Crunch is viable as well for hurting Ghost-types. Thick Fat returns as the ability of choice for letting Snorlax check Heatran extremely well. If there were ever a set to run Immunity on, it's not this one. RestTalk Snorlax already handles status really well, so it's best to stick with the bonus resistances. A more specially bulky EV spread of 188 HP / 104 Def / 216 SpD with a Careful nature can be used to execute Snorlax's strategy more effectively against special attackers, but leaves him dangerously open to even weak physical attacks.</p> <p>This is the Snorlax that you want to run with Stealth Rock and Spikes. Skarmory and Forretress both make excellent Spiking partners to this set. Forretress and Skarmory both tend to lure Heatran, which Snorlax can switch into as long as Heatran doesn't decide to Explode. Skarmory also lures Rotom-A and other Electric-type Pokemon like Zapdos that Snorlax can take advantage of. Choice Specs Jolteon will never 2HKO the listed spread, but can certainly 3HKO it. It's a wise idea to have secondary Pokemon with which to check those super-powered special attackers in case Snorlax falters or has taken previous damage. Gliscor is an excellent choice for such a Pokemon because he can set up Stealth Rock, is immune to Electric-type attacks, and resists the Fighting-type attacks that Snorlax will lure left and right.</p> "

        "name": "Tank",
        "description": "<p>Sometimes the best way to use Snorlax is to take advantage of both his offensive strength and bulkiness at the same time. While the Choice Band set focuses on checkmating frail special sweepers, this set is more about taking multiple hits over the course of a match and continually attacking as your opponent switches in their best checks.</p> <p>Body Slam and Return both have their merits on this set. Body Slam's paralysis can be immensely helpful in both supporting the team and letting Snorlax actually outspeed something. Return, however, sacrifices the chance of paralysis in exchange for hitting that much harder. Crunch is used in the second slot for the Ghost-type Pokemon that will inevitably switch into Snorlax's Normal-type STAB moves. Earthquake is a valuable move to have on this set for OHKOing Heatran and Magnezone while doing respectable damage to both Metagross and Jirachi. In the last slot, what could possibly be picked other than Self-Destruct? Self-Destruct is Snorlax's pitch at taking out one last Pokemon before going down. Fire Punch can be used in the last slot over Self-Destruct for the ability to OHKO Scizor and 2HKO Forretress, but let's face it, you're going to want to blow Snorlax up.</p> <p>Since Snorlax is singularly attacking with this set, 252 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature make those attacks sting as much as possible. You'll also want to invest 252 EVs in Snorlax's Special Defense stat so that he can switch in and force out those special attackers that he's famous for checking. Leftovers boosts Snorlax's longevity substantially given his enormous HP stat. Thick Fat certainly isn't going to waste on this set, either, as Snorlax is a respectable check to Heatran with it.</p> <p>Despite all of the investment and the Adamant nature, Snorlax is not winning any awards offensively with this set. Skarmory is a huge problem when he comes in and sets up on this Snorlax all day long. Physically defensive Zapdos makes a particularly effective check to Skarmory because it resists the Fighting-type attacks aimed at Snorlax and fries Skarmory with Thunderbolt. Zapdos also soundly beats Scizor and Forretress with Heat Wave, two other Pokemon that will happily take advantage of Snorlax if he's lacking Fire Punch. It's definitely important to pair this Snorlax with a good user of Stealth Rock to help him capitalize on the switches he forces. Gliscor is a great user of the move to consider because of his resistance palette that complements Snorlax so well.</p> "

  "Dragonite": {
    "overview": "<p>Dragonite is perhaps the most powerful Pokemon in DPP OU. Dragonite’s boosted Outrage warps the tier, as it at least 2HKOes everything in the tier that does not resist it, while even less bulky Steel-types like offensive Heatran, Scizor, and non physically bulky Jirachi can be 2HKOed with Life Orb at +1. Dragonite also has the strongest no drawbacks priority in the tier with Extreme Speed, allowing it to bypass weakened Choice Scarf users such as Flygon and Latias at +1. Dragonite's item choice affects it counters: foes hoping to status Dragonite or let it confuse itself are stymied by Lum Berry. It can also lean into its survivability with a resistance berry—Dragonite can live most attempts to revenge kill it with either a Yache Berry or a Haban Berry. These, including its wide resistance palette, makes Dragonite one of the best sweepers in the tier and a staple of hyper offense.</p> <p>Dragonite has more utility beyond an offensive Dragon Dance set. Dragonite’s mixed set has very few guaranteed switch-ins and often decimates defensive teams with its coverage and power. Because it is difficult to tell if Dragonite is mixed or physical, switching in the wrong Pokemon can be devastating if a physical wall is OHKOed by Draco Meteor or Fire Blast. Choice Band is destructively powerful without set up and is excellent against opposing offensive teams with its stong Extreme Speed and ability to absorb opposing sleep moves such as Breloom's Spore. Dragonite also can run bulky Dragon Dance sets as a win condition, aimed at defeating defensive teams who handle Dragon Dance Dragonite with status or residual damage.</p> <p>Dragonite’s main flaw lies in its severe weakness to residual damage and relatively low Speed. Dragonite is weak to Stealth Rock, takes sand damage, and often wants the extra power of Life Orb. Combined with Outrage forcing Dragonite to stay in at least another turn after using it and its confusion, Dragonite can sometimes feel underwhelming—hitting something hard and then getting immediately revenge killed or fainting to residual damage. Mixed sets struggle even more with this, as because it can’t boost its below average base 80 Speed, slower threats like defensive Latias can easily revenge kill after Stealth Rock. Many Choice Scarf Pokemon are faster than +1 Dragonite and outfitted to handle it: Flygon and Latias OHKO it, Jirachi and Lucario have Ice Punch, and Rotom-A and Heatran sometimes carries Hidden Power Ice. Defensive Dragon Dance sets often need heavy support such as Magnezone and weather change yet still can struggle against offensive teams due to lacking coverage, speed, and power.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragonite has numerous niche sets in DPP OU due to its huge movepool and high stats. Dragonite can run more midground Dragon Dance sets, with Leftovers, maximum HP, Roost, and Earthquake. These sets mitigate residual damage while not needing as much support to remove Steel-types as the bulky Dragon Dance set. Doing this often leaves it vulnerable to status and power while still being weak to revenge killers. Dragonite also can run Substitute on its offensive Dragon Dance set to block status alongside a Lum Berry. This can be used alongside another coverage move such as Fire Punch or Earthquake, or even Thunder Wave to paralyze revenge killers and walls like Jirachi. Dragonite also can run mixed sets with Dragon Dance, with options such as Draco Meteor, Superpower, Fire Blast, Earthquake, and others to mitigate its low speed while opening up walls. These sets often end up trying to do too much with too low of investment, however. The most prominent other sweeping move is Agility with many different options such as Life Orb mixed with Draco Meteor, Fire Blast and Outrage, or Expert Belt with Ice Punch, Thunderpunch, and Earthquake or any combination thereof. Agility doesn’t allow Dragonite to outspeed Choice Scarf Latias without a Speed boosting nature, while it generally isn’t strong enough to break through teams without Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Dragonite can run physically defensive sets due to its access to Heal Bell and Roost, as it is a fantastic Breloom counter and handles most threats if they can’t hit it super effectively. It often needs full team support to do so and Rapid Spin, however. Dragonite has many niche moves such as Waterfall, Stone Edge, and Thunderpunch on physical sets or Ice Beam, Thunder, and Surf on mixed sets, but these are often outclassed by other Pokemon and Dragonite is strapped for moveslots anyway. Dragonite’s support movepool includes Haze, Light Screen, Roar, Toxic, and Rain Dance, but its weakness to Stealth Rock and typing make it difficult to pull these off without being outclassed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Dragonite is difficult to answer without it heavily damaging something. Dragonite can at least 2HKO everything in the tier with the correct attack and switching in the wrong answer can be catastrophic. However, Dragonite is quite easy to revenge kill, as its attacks have heavy drawbacks, it suffers badly from residual damage, and it has common weaknesses.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types: Skarmory, Jirachi, Metagross, Heatran, and Bronzong are excellent initial switch ins to Dragonite, as its Dragon-type moves either have heavy drawbacks or are easy to wall. Should Dragonite lock itself into Outrage, Skarmory can phaze it out, Jirachi and Bronzong can survive boosted attacks and status it, while Metagross, Heatran, and Bronzong can also use Explosion. However, this can backfire, as only Bronzong and physically defensive Jirachi avoid an OHKO with the correct attack, while Dragon Dance Dragonite sets up and can hit all of these Pokemon hard.</p> <p><strong>Fast Revenge Killers: Choice Scarf Latias, Flygon, Lucario, Metagross, Jirachi, Rotom-A, and Heatran all can outspeed Dragonite after a Dragon Dance and eliminate it after Stealth Rock. Dragonite can get past all of these with the right resistance berry, or in the case of Latias and Flygon, with Extreme Speed and some residual damage.</p> <p><strong>Very Bulky Pokemon: Ice Beam Cresselia is perhaps the tier’s best answer, as it is bulky enough to survive any one attack and can set up Reflect, paralyze Dragonite, or eliminate it with Ice Beam after Stealth Rock. All others should be careful. Hippowdon, Gliscor, Bold Clefable, Suicune, and Milotic can all stave off unboosted Dragonite and retaliate with an Ice-type attack. However, Life Orb boosted +1 Dragonite OHKOes many of these checks with Outrage, while some of the weaker Ice-type attacks need Stealth Rock before they can OHKO. These Pokemon are also set up bait for very specially bulky Dragonite with Heal Bell should they lack phazing moves.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Dragonite is weak to Stealth Rock, take sand damage, and generally wants Life Orb. Additionally, its attacks have drawbacks, such as Outrage forcing it to stay in and Draco Meteor’s as well as Superpower’s stat drops. Because of this, Dragonite will often be a low health should it come in again, meaning anything that can hit it super effectively, status it, or outspeed can eliminate it.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong> Mamoswine, Weavile, and Abomasnow are excellent checks with Ice Shard, as if Dragonite lacks Yache Berry, it will OHKO. Even with Yache Berry, Dragonite takes heavy damage from especially Mamoswine’s and Weavile’s Ice Shard, as with a Choice Band, sand, and Stealth Rock it can KO. However, Dragonite with Extreme Speed at +1 will outspeed Ice Shard and KO Weavile after Stealth Rock while heavily damaging Mamoswine and Abomasnow.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: While they can’t switch in, Latias, Flygon, and Kingdra all outspeed Dragonite and can easily OHKO with their Dragon-type attacks should it lock into Outrage without a speed boost.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Coverage: Tyranitar can hit Dragonite hard with both Ice- and Rock-type moves, while Choice Scarf sets outspeed all non boosted Dragonite. Dragonite also doesn’t take Pursuit well should it switch out. While rare, Aerodactyl outspeeds most Dragon Dance Dragonite at +1 and can OHKO with Stone Edge. Gyarados, Machamp, and Swampert can generally survive a non boosted hit and retaliate with a super effective Stone Edge or Ice Punch.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Offensive Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragonite’s bulk and offensive prowess can typically get it a Dragon Dance, solving its speed problems and making it extremely strong. With Outrage, it can overwhelm very defensive Pokemon such as specially defensive Hippowdon and physically defensive Zapdos after Stealth Rock. The main downfall to Outrage is being locked into it and the confusion afterwards. However, the power difference from the safer Dragon Claw makes it a necessary evil, as Dragon Claw fails to OHKO offensive Suicune and generally doesn’t hit hard enough even when boosted.</p> <p>Fire Punch is a great option to hit Steel-types resistant to Outrage. Fire Punch at +1 easily 2HKOes Skarmory, Bronzong, Metagross, and Jirachi. However, another option is Earthquake, OHKOing grounded Steel-types such as Metagross, Jirachi, and Heatran. Due to its much higher base power than Fire Punch, Earthquake helps against other foes, such as OHKOing Tyranitar at +1 without locking into Outrage. Finally, Extreme Speed has incredible utility, as it generally hits unresisted targets such as Starmie, Latias, Flygon, and Gyarados for &gt;50% of their health unboosted. At +1, it also can bypass weakened revenge killers, such as Choice Scarf Flygon, Weavile using Ice Shard, and Choice Scarf Latias.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Dragonite’s generally runs a maximum Attack / maximum Speed Adamant nature EV spread, as it needs all the speed and power it can get. Don’t put the extra 4 EVs into HP, as Dragonite will take extra Stealth Rock damage. A Jolly nature is possible to outspeed slower Choice Scarf users such as Heatran and Adamant Lucario at +1 while also outspeeding Choice Scarf Latias at +2, but the power loss is enormous and Dragonite often can’t get to +2 anyway.</p> <p>Lum Berry is the preferred item, as it prevents status from ruining Dragonite’s sweep. A common way for defensive teams to stave it off is to send in physically defensive Jirachi on Outrage and then paralyze with Body Slam. Not only does Lum Berry prevent this, but even if Jirachi paralyzes it again, Dragonite’s Inner Focus ability prevents Iron Head flinching. Lum Berry also crucially alleviates one of the main downside in Outrage by curing confusion, meaning it can lock into Outrage again unimpeded. Another option is to use Yache Berry to help survive Dragonite 4x weakness to Ice-type moves. As many Water-types, Zapdos, and Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-A, Lucario, some Tyranitar, and Jirachi try to revenge kill Dragonite with Ice-type moves, Yache Berry lets Dragonite survive and either set up again or unleash attacks. Should Dragonite lead, Focus Sash in another item to use, allowing Dragonite to live any hit and continue attacking.</p> <p>Life Orb is another great choice of item for Dragonite, as the extra power is very valuable, allowing it to bypass checks such as Bold Clefable and offensive Calm Mind Suicune with Outrage. Life Orb also makes using Extreme Speed over a coverage move more viable, as the extra damage is very important to KOing Choice Scarf Flygon and Choice Scarf Latias while generally raising its utility. If Dragonite is used on more hyper offensive teams, Life Orb should be the item of choice for its destructive power. However, beware of the already huge weakness to residual damage.</p> <p>Dragonite can also use Haban Berry to survive various Outrage and Draco Meteor from Latias, Flygon, Kingdra, and opposing Dragonite. Dragonite can run a 196 Atk / 80 SpD / 232 Spe EV spread, which allows it to survive Choice Scarf Latias’s Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock and one round of sand damage while still outspeeding Modest Heatran unboosted. Should Dragonite want to live Modest Choice Specs Latias’s Draco Meteor, it should run 108 Atk / 212 SpD / 192 Spe. However, beware of taking too much investment out of Dragonite’s Attack, as it won’t KO what it needs to.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>How Dragonite is used depends on the opposing team. Against more defensive teams, Dragonite needs the additional power from Dragon Dance to break through soft checks like specially defensive Hippowdon, Milotic, and Bold Clefable with a boosted +1 Outrage. Many of these teams answer Dragonite by either baiting it into Outrage and then switching to a physically bulky Steel-type such as Jirachi or by using Skarmory to either phaze or use Counter against a boosted Dragonite. Offensive Dragon Dance Dragonite rarely sweeps defensive teams on its own, but breaking open holes by weakening Skarmory or checks such as Hippowdon can open up for another teammate.</p> <p>Against more offensive teams, Dragonite sometimes struggles to find time to set up. However, Dragonite can open holes by sometimes just attacking; +0 Outrage is so strong that even somewhat bulky foes such as maximum HP Swampert struggle to take it. Dragonite despises residual damage from Stealth Rock and sand, so hitting the field early can be beneficial. However, Dragonite’s bulk and Extreme Speed can let it trade or revenge kill opponents late in the game. Dragonite’s answers are often forced to either lock into exploitable moves, such as Flygon’s Outrage, Latias’s Draco Meteor, and Rotom-A’s Hidden Power Ice, or be heavily weakened by Dragonite’s attacks. Take advantage of this by setting up another sweeper on these attacks. Should Dragonite lead, even good set up opportunities such as Heatran can potentially have Focus Sash and OHKO Dragonite with Explosion, meaning just attacking is often better.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dragonite is a staple of the hyper offense style, as little breaks open teams like Dragonite can. Dragonite loves to hit the field without Stealth Rock being up, so Taunt leads such as Azelf, Aerodactyl, and Skarmory are beneficial. Dragonite also appreciates other sweepers such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Swords Dance Scizor, Agility Metagross, and Swords Dance Lucario. All of these synergistically sweep with Dragonite: Gyarados and Tyranitar appreciate Dragonite weakening or KOing bulky Steel-types such as Jirachi, Metagross, Skarmory, and Bronzong that can tank a hit and paralyze, phaze, or use Explosion on them. Metagross, Scizor, and Lucario all resist Dragonite’s weaknesses, meaning they can get free set up on the Choiced attacks used to revenge kill Dragonite. Dragonite enjoys Magnezone support to remove the Steel-types, especially Skarmory, that survive its Outrage. Other main stays of Magnezone offense such as Gengar, Choice Specs Latias, and offensive Stealth Rock Bronzong are helpful. Dragonite also takes advantage of other ways to weaken levitating Steel-types, such as surprise Fire- and Electric-type moves from Tyranitar and Jirachi, Trick + Iron Ball or Choice Band from Bronzong and Metagross, and special moves from Pokemon like Swampert. Dragonite appreciates Pursuit support from Tyranitar and Swords Dance Scizor, as Latias and Rotom-A are prominent Choice Scarf users who revenge kill Dragonite.</p> <p>Dragonite does appreciate Rapid Spin support to remove Stealth Rock, but it is difficult to fit the pace of the team. Dragonite fits alongside other Dragon-types such as Latias, Kingdra, and Flygon in a DragMag style built on weakening Steel-types for powerful Dragon-type moves. Other mainstays of this style include Mamoswine, Lucario, and Gengar. Dragonite also fits well alongside dual screens, as it can set up multiple Dragon Dances and is impossible to wall. Other mainstays of this style such as Uxie, offensive Calm Mind Suicune, Machamp, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and Calm Mind Jirachi are excellent teammates.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragonite can take advantage of its physical prowess to lure physical walls in and hit them with devastating special moves. Dragonite’s Draco Meteor is extremely strong, heavily damaging common switch-ins such as Hippowdon, Suicune, and Bold Clefable. Both Fire Blast and Flamethrower destroy the many Steel-types trying to absorb Dragonite's Dragon-type attacks and the choice is a matter of accuracy and PP versus power. Flamethrower OHKOes physically defensive Skarmory and Scizor while at least 2HKOing every Steel-type in the tier except the bulkiest of Jirachi, Heatran, specially defensive Empoleon, and Heatproof Bronzong. Fire Blast additionally OHKOes bulkless Jirachi, Metagross after Stealth Rock, and has a 75% chance to OHKO specially defensive Skarmory after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Superpower completes Dragonite’s coverage and is a major advantage over other mixed Dragon-types such as Flygon and Kingdra. Dragonite is almost guaranteed to OHKO non Bold Clefable with Superpower, while also OHKOing Tyranitar, most Empoleon, and Heatran after Stealth Rock. It also gives Dragonite the ability to hit something hard even after Draco Meteor’s stat drops. Extreme Speed maximizes Dragonite’s utility against offensive teams, as an uninvested Life Orb Extreme Speed does significant damage to frail sweepers who don’t resist it. Roost mitigates the residual damage of Life Orb, Stealth Rock, and sand to keep Dragonite healthy against defensive teams. The last choice is to focus on more destructive power with Outrage, limiting checks that can switch in to just Cresselia. Outrage means even common mixed Dragonite answers such as specially defensive Hippowdon and Gliscor can never switch into Draco Meteor, because Outrage will KO them. Beware of the consequences of being locked into a slow Outrage, however.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Dragonite should almost always run a Special Attack boosting nature and 252 Special Attack EVs. Maximum Speed allows Dragonite to outspeed as much as it can and speed tie with itself. 192 EVs with a neutral nature allows Dragonite to outspeed neutral nature Tyranitar. However, Dragonite can also run a Speed boosting nature, as it crucially allows it to outrun slower defensive Latias as well as Heatran, Gyarados, slower offensive Suicune, and Adamant Lucario. Dragonite can also run other Speed benchmarks, such as no Speed at all or 104 EVs to outspeed neutral nature Tyranitar. Dragonite can spare some Attack EVs to improve Superpower’s damage to Clefable, Empoleon, and Heatran. 72 Attack EVs is needed to guarantee maximum HP Clefable. Other benchmarks include 140 Attack EVs to OHKO Blissey with Stealth Rock and one round of sand as well as 2HKO specially defensive Hipppwdon with Outrage after Stealth Rock, or just maximum Attack to do as much damage as possible. Life Orb is generally the item of choice, as Dragonite needs all the power it can get. It also doesn’t have a lot of survivability and is easily revenge killed, so maximizing the damage it can do is preferred. Dragonite can also run a Focus Sash in the lead position to guarantee a Draco Meteor and a follow up.</p> <p>Dragonite shouldn’t be lowering Attack, Special Attack, or Speed, so it either has to lower its Defense or Special Defense. Special Defense lowering natures are generally better, as Dragonite can’t survive most special Ice- and Dragon-type moves after Stealth Rock anyway. With its Defense intact, it can be serviceable against Breloom—notably, it avoids a 2HKO from Focus Punch. Dragonite can survive weaker Ice Beam from Swampert and Milotic without Stealth Rock with a Defense hindering nature; however, since Dragonite is almost never at full health, this often is irrelevant.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Dragonite generally operates with the element of surprise and hammers unsuspecting physical walls with special moves. As such, Fire Blast or Flamethrower is generally the safest move to use. Surprising physically defensive Skarmory or Jirachi can sometimes win the game immediately and Draco Meteor targets such as Latias generally won't switch into Dragonite. It also keep Dragonite's Special Attack intact. Dragonite generally should come in early before Stealth Rock is up. Dragonite often only gets a few moves to make an impact due to residual damage, so getting the most out of requires exact play. Against more defensive teams, only a few Pokemon can avoid a 2HKO from it or outspeed it and OHKO. Should Dragonite have Roost, it can come in repeatedly on Pokemon such as defensive Breloom, Clefable, Starmie lacking Ice Beam, and Forretress and break up the opposing defensive core.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dragonite generally belongs on more offensive teams looking to break defensive builds open and can prevent early Stealth Rock. For this reason, it doesn't really compete with other mixed attackers like Flygon. Dragonite appreciates anti Stealth Rock leads that can give it a free switch and potentially status the opponent. Aerodactyl, Thunder Wave Azelf, Thunder Wave Froslass, Choice Scarf or Focus Sash Breloom, and Gallade with Will-O-Wisp and Taunt can let Dragonite in for free and disable the opponent. As some of these leads cannot set up Stealth Rock, Dragonite appreciates alternate setters such as Metagross, Heatran, and Camerupt. Metagross is especially synergetic, as Skarmory commonly switches into Metagross, which is a free switch in for Dragonite to rip open the opposing team. Beyond the lead game, mixed Dragonite appreciates partners that take advantage of the holes it breaks. Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Swords Dance Scizor, Swords Dance Lucario, and offensive Empoleon are excellent partners. Lucario is an especially good teammate, as Dragonite can lure in most Lucario walls and hammer them with Draco Meteor and Fire Blast. Another great partner for Dragonite is Tyranitar, as all sets benefit from Dragonite removing Hippowdon. Choice Scarf sets open up other sweepers and help against potential revenge killers such as Latias; Dragon Dance sets take advantage of the opening of defensive Ground-types; and utility sets get up Stealth Rock and absorb Dragonite’s weaknesses. Swords Dance Scizor with Pursuit can also take advantage of defensive Latias trying to revenge kill Dragonite. Other Pokemon that can take advantage of breaking open walls are Trick Room Bronzong, Agility Metagross, and Machamp. On more balanced teams, Dragonite is commonly paired with ways to mitigate residual damage. As such it can be found alongside Wish Jirachi and Rapid Spin Starmie. Dragonite is also commonly forced out after using Draco Meteor or Superpower, so Choice Scarf revenge killers such as Latias and Rotom-A are effective to help against set up. Steel-types in general help Dragonite, as they resist its weaknesses and give Dragonite an opportunity to come in.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With a Choice Band, Dragonite hits hard immediately, as Outrage at least 2HKOes everything in the tier that doesn’t resist it. Extreme Speed makes up Dragonite other primary niche, as it 2HKOes most sweepers such as Gyarados, Kingdra, and even Lucario after a Defense drop with Stealth Rock, while Dragonite is bulky enough to survive most other priority such as Lucario's own +2 Extreme Speed and opposing Dragonite’s boosted Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Dragonite’s other moveslots help it handle Pokemon trying to absorb Outrage. Superpower is the best of these, as it has strong neutral coverage while slamming most Steel-types hard. It also OHKOes Clefable and Tyranitar without having to lock into Outrage. It provides another neutral option to hit Breloom should Dragonite absorb Spore. Beware that prominent Dragonite switch-ins such as Jirachi, Bronzong, and Skarmory may not be 2HKOed by Superpower, however. Fire Punch is Dragonite’s best option against Skarmory and Bronzong, as it 2HKOes them while also hitting physically defensive Jirachi and Breloom hard. Earthquake is another option, as it will at least 2HKO every Steel-type in the game besides Bronzong and Skarmory. Dragonite’s ability to switch into Breloom successfully with Sleep Talk makes it a solid check, as with Outrage, Extreme Speed, and Superpower or Fire Punch, all moves will do a lot of damage. Dragon Claw is an option alongside Outrage, as it still is very strong, 2HKOing Milotic and most Swampert after Stealth Rock. Waterfall is a nice midground for Tyranitar switch ins and less bulky Steel-types such as Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Dragonite should not deviate from a fast and strong spread of maximum Attack / maximum Speed with an Adamant nature. A Jolly nature is possible to outspeed defensive Latias, Adamant Lucario, and Heatran, but the power loss is enormous and especially hurts when using Extreme Speed or fighting offensive Suicune and physically defensive Hippowdon. As Dragonite only needs 192 EVs to outspeed Jolly Tyranitar, it is possible to invest in arbitrary bulk numbers such as 64 HP / 252 Atk / 192 Spe. However, this often is not worth it, as Dragonite is easily revenge killed anyway and prefers to at least tie with itself and potentially outspeed slower Dragon Dance Gyarados and Breloom.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>How to use Dragonite depends on the opposing team. Against offensive foes, most of the opponent’s team should be able to revenge kill Dragonite after it locks into Outrage. As such, hitting the field before Stealth Rock is up and using Dragon Claw or Superpower can scout out the opposing team so Outrage’s power is only used when needed. Dragonite’s Extreme Speed is also an extremely valuable tool for revenging opposing sweepers, so keeping it alive until late can be helpful. However, do not hesitate to switch Dragonite into Breloom’s Spore early in the game should it have Sleep Talk, as even if Breloom avoids the attack with Substitute or Protect, Dragonite has accomplished its job of absorbing sleep. Dragonite can even fire off strong attacks in the lead position.</p> <p>Against defensive teams, scouting for opposing Skarmory and Jirachi that can absorb Outrage is crucial, as once these threats are weakened, Dragonite can freely fire off Outrage. The only common Pokemon that are faster than Dragonite and can KO on defensive teams are Latias (which cannot guarantee an OHKO on Dragonite after Stealth Rock without Ice Beam), Choice Scarf Tyranitar, faster Gliscor with Ice Fang, and Choice Scarf Rotom-A. As Dragonite is so weak to residual damage, Dragonite can also just use Outrage when it comes in to get the most out of it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Band Dragonite generally features on more balanced teams that appreciate its wall breaking ability, help against opposing hyper offense teams, and absorb sleep from Breloom. In return, they can mitigate the exploitable nature of its attacks, weakness to Stealth Rock, and lack of defensive profile. One of the best partners to this Dragonite set is Magnezone, as it traps Dragon-type resistances, allowing Dragonite to use Outrage with impunity. This Dragonite is more likely to appear with other Dragon-types such as Latias, Flygon, and Kingdra, as with Magnezone and Dragonite, Steel-types and other bulky Pokemon that can survive their attacks like Water-types and Hippowdon will not survive. Other Pokemon that fit well alongside Magnezone offense work well too; however, because of this pair’s defensive liability, they should be bulkier to handle many different Pokemon. Examples include Uxie, Jirachi, Swampert, and utility Tyranitar, while other more frail staples such as Gengar and offensive Metagross are harder to fit.</p> <p>Dragonite also appreciates Rapid Spin support, as it has no way to heal itself with this set and is weak to Stealth Rock. Starmie, Forretress, and Donphan work well for this purpose. Starmie especially works well, as Dragonite fits well in more offensive paralysis styles as a wallbreaker and sleep absorber. Example teammates with this pairing include Machamp, Jirachi, and Blissey. Blissey and Jirachi can even Wish pass to Dragonite. Other Blissey offense teammates such as Heatran, Skarmory, and Breloom fit well for this purpose, as they cover a lot of the metagame effectively in few team slots. Heatran also enjoys if Dragonite can remove offensive Water-types and Hippowdon with Outrage.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Bulky Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>While Dragonite’s Dragon Dance sets are often crippled by status, this set mitigates this flaw while taking advantage of teams trying to defeat it with residual damage with Roost. As a bulky win condition, one advantage Dragonite has is the ability to boost its Speed. To prevent status moves, Dragonite can use either Heal Bell or Substitute. Heal Bell broadly helps the team more and cures Dragonite of its status ailments. However, Substitute blocks them in the first place. Substitute also has a lot more PP than Heal Bell should the opponent repeatedly use status moves, such as Jirachi and RestTalk Rotom-A. Substitute also shields Dragonite from revenge killing, as a boosted Dragonite can OHKO all common Choice Scarf Pokemon besides Heatran and Lucario. Another option to block status is Safeguard, although Dragonite is easily forced out by revenge killers without enough speed boosts and it constantly needs to reapply Safeguard after five turns.</p> <p>With Roost and any of the status abating moves, Dragonite can use many defensive Pokemon trying to stall it out as set up fodder, such as defensive Jirachi, RestTalk Rotom-A, Breloom, Clefable lacking Encore or Ice Beam, Starmie lacking Ice Beam, Blissey, and defensive Heatran. Roost also offsets residual damage such as Stealth Rock, sand, and Substitute. Dragon Claw is the attack of choice, as it has no immunities and can at least 2HKO everything at +6 besides physically bulky Steel-types like Jirachi and Skarmory. While Heal Bell can cure Outrage’s confusion and it hits much harder, being locking into Outrage and the confusion is counterproductive to the set as well as opening it up to revenge killers.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Dragonite’s EVs are a balance between what it wants to set up on and Speed. The EV spread listed focuses on special bulk while outspeeding up to maximum Speed Jirachi and Flygon after one Dragon Dance, slower Choice Scarf users such as Adamant Flygon and Rotom-A at +2, and everything after three Dragon Dance. The special bulk gives Dragonite the best chance to set up against defensive teams, as it avoids a 2HKO from every common special attack used on defensive teams and can Roost it off, including Clefable +0 Ice Beam, defensive Swampert’s Ice Beam, and Latias’s Ice Beam. The spread also avoids an OHKO from Choice Scarf Latias’s Draco Meteor and every Ice Beam up to offensive Empoleon’s, meaning Dragonite can Roost off the damage can stall out the attack. Dragonite can also run even more special bulk with a spread of 248 HP / 216 SpD / 44 Spe as this spread means RestTalk Rotom-A Thunderbolt will never break a Substitute and can even survive Choice Specs Latias’s Dragon Pulse in sand. However, the speed trade off means it only outpaces positive nature base 90 Speed foes such as Roserade and Lucario at +1, can’t outspeed Choice Scarf Heatran at +2, and needs +4 to outspeed everything.</p> <p>Dragonite can also focus on Speed more with a Jolly nature, as a maximum HP Dragonite Substitute is still bulky enough to not break to Jirachi Body Slam and Iron Head only has a 75% chance to do so. With a boosting nature and 176 EVs, Dragonite can outspeed the unboosted tier at +1 and everything at +2. This significantly cuts into its bulk and can’t set up on as much, as Rotom-A’s Thunderbolt will break the Substitute guaranteed. Only use this spread with Substitute, as Heal Bell and Safeguard need more bulk to function properly.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Dragonite, even with bulk, Roost, and possibly Heal Bell, is very easy to wall before its counters have been removed because of its slow Speed even when boosted and reliance on one attack. As such, it generally only comes in at the end of the game to set up or if the team desperately needs Heal Bell. Other than this, how to play Dragonite depends on the opposing team.</p> <p>Against offensive teams, once Dragonite uses Dragon Dance, it generally won’t be able to set up again. Should Dragonite be forced out, it loses a ton of momentum due to both its weakness to Stealth Rock and how many boosts it needs to outspeed common Choice Scarf users and break checks with Dragon Claw. As offensive teams generally don’t require Heal Bell, try to keep Dragonite hidden as long as possible until it's favorable to sweep, as once its counters are removed, offensive teams struggle to do enough damage to stop a bulky, healing Dragonite from accumulating boosts.</p> <p>Against more defensive teams, it is more forgiving should Dragonite be forced out. These teams generally do not apply so much pressure that Dragonite can’t heal up as well as generally only have one Pokemon that outspeeds +1 Dragonite. As such, Dragonite can heal status more easily and set up on bulky walls. Be careful to remove bulky phazers such as Skarmory, as Dragonite will not sweep without being at +6 unless it is the last Pokemon. With Heal Bell, Dragonite can be stalled out of PP against bulky Steel-type status users such as Jirachi, so be make sure to KO these.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dragonite needs a vast support structure and the entire team built around it to sweep. First, Magnezone support is mandatory, because Steel-types will wall Dragonite unless it gets many boosts. Multiple Magnezone sets can work, as Choice Scarf Magnezone can remove Skarmory, paralyze defensive Jirachi and remove offensive sets, Empoleon, Scizor, and also check Lucario and Gengar. Magnet Rise Magnezone can also eliminate Metagross and Bronzong that can remove Dragonite with Explosion. Choice Scarf Magneton can also remove Skarmory and help against neutral nature Dragon Dance sweepers like opposing Dragonite and Gyarados. As Dragonite struggles in general against offensive teams, strong walls that work alongside Magnezone such as Clefable, Zapdos, Uxie, Latias, Skarmory, and even Quagsire are effective. These also have redundant Pokemon they wall with Dragonite, meaning it can come in only when it is ready to sweep. In addition, Dragonite appreciates Rapid Spin support due to its weakness to Stealth Rock and the general passivity of the team surrounding it. Starmie, Forretress, Donphan, and Tentacruel are good choices here. Entry hazards in general are also effective, meaning Skarmory, Roserade, Tentacruel, and Forretress can help weaken the opposing walls.</p> <p>Dragonite, especially Substitute variants, appreciates weather clearing for general longevity. Rain Dance Bronzong, Cresselia, Uxie, Azelf, and Latias are effective. Another way to give Dragonite the support it needs is to use it in rain teams. These teams provide the infrastructure needed to sweep, such as Uxie, Azelf, Mesprit, and Bronzong providing weather clearing. Weather sweepers such as Qwilfish, Ludicolo, and Kingdra can hammer Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Abomasnow that answer Dragonite. Choice Specs Kingdra especially is helpful, as it is fantastic in rain against offensive teams and weakens Steel-types with powerful Water-type attacks. Qwilfish can use Explosion, set Toxic Spikes, and hit physical walls hard, while Ludicolo resets rain effectively and hurts offensive teams. Magnezone support, while uncommon on rain teams, is still necessary, and other rain support such as Rotom-A, Latias, Suicune, Heatran, and even Tyranitar are quite effective alongside Dragonite.</p> "

  "Crobat": {
    "overview": "<p>Crobat’s great Speed, access to Taunt, and good defensive typing make it a solid lead and threat to passive, bulkier Pokemon. With Taunt and Crobat's base 130 Speed, it can outspeed most common leads to prevent Stealth Rock, most notably Azelf and tying with Aerodactyl. Against more threatening leads such as Metagross, Empoleon, and Machamp, Crobat can U-turn out to break Focus Sash and switch into a more favorable Pokemon. Crobat’s defensive profile is also nothing to scoff at, as with Roost and its resistances, it can be a threat to slower teams. From here, it can slowly wear down foes such as Hippowdon, Clefable, and Skarmory while healing off their attacks.</p> <p>However, Crobat is mainly held back by its mediocre stats besides Speed, its weakness to Stealth Rock, and its inability to deal with common Pokemon, such as Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Jirachi. Due to these mediocre stats, Crobat struggles to deal damage to anything that can shrug off Brave Bird and can hit it hard back. Additionally, Crobat is not very bulky even with investment and relies on its Speed and recovery to handle defensive Pokemon; it crumbles to strong neutral attacks such as Heatran's Fire Blast, Tyranitar's Crunch, and Gyarados's Waterfall. This vulnerability is made worse by its weakness to Stealth Rock—while it can be an excellent scout with U-turn and its Speed, it struggles to do so repeatedly with Stealth Rock up. While Crobat's typing makes it an excellent check to Breloom, it also gives it major issues dealing with common Pokemon on defensive teams such as Rotom-A and Zapdos. Both easily at least 2HKO Crobat with Thunderbolt and Crobat can't damage them effectively. While Crobat is immune to flinching from Jirachi's Iron Head, it cannot stop Jirachi from ruining it with paralysis from Body Slam. These vulnerabilities mean it is largely outclassed by Gliscor, who is slower but has much greater bulk, more versatility, and a better defensive typing.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Crobat has a few options not particularly effective in DPP OU. Crobat can use a Choice Band set to take advantage of Brave Bird, fast Speed, and stronger U-turn, but still is not very strong and struggles greatly with Stealth Rock. Crobat also can run Sleep Talk to further its ability to counter Breloom. However, the move doesn’t have much utility outside of that. Crobat can also use a fully special set built around Nasty Plot and its coverage options like Heat Wave, but its awful base 70 Special Attack and the terrible coverage of Sludge Bomb make this difficult. Crobat also can put something to sleep with Hypnosis, but the accuracy makes this more difficult.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rotom-A: Rotom-A is the biggest annoyance to a Crobat, no matter what set it uses. It resists both Brave Bird and U-turn, is immune to Super Fang, and can potentially OHKO Crobat after Stealth Rock with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric types in general are a huge issue for Crobat. Zapdos, Magnezone, and even Jolteon easily stomach Brave Bird and OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Jolteon even commonly outspeeds it.</p> <p><strong>Status: Crobat is deathly afraid of status. While it is immune to poison, a burn greatly reduces its longevity and hampers Brave Bird, while paralysis ruins its main asset: its Speed.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel types resist all of Crobat’s attacking moves whilst generally being able to 2HKO back or threaten it with status. Heatran, Jirachi, Metagross, Scizor, and Empoleon all heavily threaten Scizor while it can do little back besides Super Fang.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Crobat generally folds to very strong attacks, such as Choice Specs Latias's Draco Meteor, Dragonite's Outrage, Heatran's Fire-type attacks, and Kingdra's rain boosted Hydro Pump. Generally, if a move hits super effectively, such as Machamp's Stone Edge or Jirachi's Psychic, Crobat won't last very long.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Crobat is weak to Stealth Rock and is vulnerable to sand. This cuts into its already mediocre bulk and makes it hard to repeatedly come in and pivot or use Taunt.</p> ",

        "name": "Stallbreaker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Crobat's niche is primarily as a stallbreaker, as with Taunt, recovery in Roost, and its Toxic immunity, it can survive a long time against weaker attacks. Taunt prevents defensive Pokemon such as Blissey, Clefable, and Skarmory from statusing Crobat or healing. Should Crobat lead, it also stops Azelf and Hippowdon from setting up Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Brave Bird is Crobat’s primary tool for dealing damage. Its high base power somewhat makes up for Crobat's lack of Attack, and it chips bulkier Pokemon that do not resist it such as Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Flygon well. U-turn lets Crobat act as a pivot, letting teammates come in on its checks and chipping threats such as Tyranitar and Jirachi. Super Fang can also be used as an alternative to U-turn, as it allows Crobat to deal more reliable damage on bulky foes that resist Brave Bird, such as Zapdos, Metagross, and Heatran. However, this comes at the expense of Crobat’s pivoting capabilities.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Running 144 Speed EVs puts Crobat at 365 speed, enough to outspeed +1 Tyranitar and maximum Speed Azelf and Starmie. The remaining EVs are placed in maximum HP and additional physical bulk. Crobat does not gain much out of extra Speed, as it will only Speed tie with Aerodactyl and Jolteon while outspeeding +1 Gyarados and Dragonite at maximum Speed—Pokemon Crobat cannot deal with effectively. 116 Defense EVs allow it to better deal with Fighting-types such as Infernape, Breloom, and Lucario. It specifically survives Lucario's +2 Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Crobat should generally lead or come in the game early before Stealth Rock is up to threaten Taunt or pivot around with U-turn. Be wary of stronger offensive threats such as Heatran or Zapdos coming in, however, as Crobat cannot deal with them and is forced out immediately. While Crobat is relatively difficult to OHKO, it should be healing relatively often, as it can be overwhelmed rather easily. However, using Roost can open it up to Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Flygon easily 2HKOing it with Earthquake. Also, be weary of Pursuit users when using U-turn: the damage can add up overtime, especially if Stealth Rock is up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Crobat generally enjoys teammates who can take advantage of its hard answers either through Pursuit or strong attacks. It additionally loves Rapid Spin support to remove Stealth Rock. Choice Band Tyranitar makes a great partner, as it can guarantee a kill on Choice Scarf Rotom-A with Pursuit and do significant damage to many of Crobat’s other checks, such as Zapdos and Heatran. In return, Crobat can easily handle Fighting-types that threaten Tyranitar, such as Breloom and Lucario. Rapid Spinning greatly helps Crobat, as taking 25% of health adds up in the long term. Starmie and Forretress are excellent choices. Forretress as well as Skarmory can set up Spikes, as Crobat can force a lot of switches with Taunt and U-turn. Crobat also enjoys Knock Off support, especially on Steel-types such as Jirachi, Heatran, and Skarmory so it can damage them with Brave Bird and Super Fang. Clefable is an excellent choice and can take on Zapdos and Rotom-A. Other strong defensive teammates such as Jirachi, Latias, and Hippowdon appreciate Crobat's ability against more defensive teams and can take on Pokemon it does not enjoy dealing with.</p> "

  "Quagsire": {
    "overview": "<p>While Quagsire may be adorable, it is also rather forgettable due to its low base stat total and inferiority to other bulky Water-types, most notably Swampert. Although admittedly flawed, Quagsire does sport access to Recover, Water Absorb, and Encore to differentiate itself from the oversized mudpuppy. These traits allow it to be one of the few hard counters to all variants of Starmie (which is no easy feat) while still faring decently well against Pokemon such as Metagross and Tyranitar. All in all, Quagsire's extremely niche options can allow it to function in standard; just make sure that what it's doing can't be done better by other Water-types.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Quagsire has no other set that wouldn't have it outclassed by Swampert or some other bulky Water-type, but in the last slot of its only set, there are some possibilities. Yawn, Haze, and Stone Edge are decent alternatives; the former two help against set-up sweepers (and general phazing too with respect to the first), while Stone Edge gets great coverage with Earthquake, nabbing super effective hits on many important Flying-types. STAB Waterfall can also be used as a secondary STAB move with decent coverage. Finally, Body Slam has a nifty 30% paralysis rate that can also be useful for Quagsire.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Taking advantage of Quagsire's lack of power is often a great way to deal with it. Since it loses much of its presence once its support moves are taken out of the equation, Taunt users such as Azelf and Aerodactyl make good checks. Substitute users such as Gengar and Rotom-A will also cause trouble if they're immune or resistant to Earthquake, for mostly the same reasons. Quagsire will also find it extremely difficult to do anything substantial to most defensive Spikes users, so a Pokemon like Skarmory or Forretress can usually unload themselves on Quagsire with impunity. Obviously, Grass-types such as Shaymin, Celebi, Breloom, and Roserade counter Quagsire with their massive type advantage. Burning or poisoning Quagsire will cut its longevity greatly, as it simply cannot take a negative Leftovers recovery on top of its mediocre defenses. The additional effects of burn and poison will also help when Quagsire has to use its attacks or is trying to Toxic stall itself, respectively. Do be wary of the stray Yawn when switching in your counter though, and make sure not to try to set up on Quagsire unless you're sure it's not going to Encore.</p> ",

Quagsire also fares quite well against physical threats such as Metagross, Tyranitar, and Gyarados, as well as several Water- and Electric-type attackers that lack a Grass-type move to deal with it.</p> <p>Earthquake is a great STAB move which helps make up for Quagsire's rather disappointing Attack stat, garnering super effective hits on various important threats, including the aforementioned Metagross and Tyranitar.

Toxic is used in the final slot for when Earthquake just doesn't cut it, allowing Quagsire to Toxic stall with Recover like Gliscor does with Roost. On the other hand, Ice Punch gets almost perfect coverage with Earthquake and allows Quagsire to check Flygon and Dragonite with greater ease.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Quagsire's effective bulk, and is largely geared towards Special Defense since many of the Pokemon Quagsire can check are specially based, such as Starmie. Enough is invested into Special Defense that Life Orb Starmie's Ice Beam never 3HKOes Quagsire, while the hint in Defense helps cushion against physical attackers such as Metagross and Flygon. A physically geared EV spread is viable, but it leaves Quagsire largely outclassed by Swampert.</p> <p>As a bulky Water-type, Quagsire works excellently alongside Grass- and Fire-types as part of a team core. Roserade, in particular, works marvelously for its ability to absorb any stray Toxic Spikes, which absolutely cripple Quagsire, and set up Spikes, which will undoubtedly get their money's worth thanks to Quagsire's ability to force switches with Encore. Similarly, other entry hazard supporters, such as Skarmory and Forretress, also work well with Quagsire, both being x4 resistant to its Grass-type weakness, while it in return is at least resistant to all of their weaknesses. Forretress is also able to Rapid Spin away entry hazards, which is great since Quagsire can find itself Spikes fodder quite easily. Mixed Infernape can be used as the Fire-type in the core that serves as a pivot to break through the bulkier Pokemon that give Quagsire problems. Quagsire's Encore also makes it considerably easier for Infernape to switch in and wreak havoc. Pokemon with a similar lack of resistances or bulk will also appreciate Quagsire's Encore.</p> "

  "Umbreon": {
    "overview": "<p>Umbreon boasts some of the best defensive stats of all Pokemon in the OU tier. Access to various types of support moves allows it to fit a niche role in a team—Mean Look to guarantee a free entry against an opposing Pokemon of your choice, Wish to heal its teammates, Heal Bell to remove status, Taunt to shut down opposing support Pokemon, and stat-dropping moves such as Fake Tears, Screech, and Charm to force switches. Its ability, Synchronize, also allows it to inflict a status ailment like burn, paralysis, poison, or badly poisoned that occurs due to a primary or secondary effect of a move. It is one of the few Pokemon that can use Wish + Protect + Pursuit in one set in order to be able to take out Psychic- and Ghost-types a lot more reliably, with Choice Scarf Tyranitar being the other Pokemon that is commonly used to to take out Psychic- and Ghost-types.</p> <p>However, despite all of the support Umbreon can offer, it hardly ever sees any usage in OU. The reasons for this include Umbreon's passivity, since it has only base 65 Attack and an even lower base 60 Special Attack. Umbreon is also vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards; as well as prevalent sand, which not only inflicts chip damage but most importantly also halves the amount that Umbreon can heal through its only instant-healing move, Moonlight. Tyranitar, which also is one of the more common Pokemon to set sand, also gives Umbreon a lot of competition as one of the better Dark-types in the tier. Umbreon also used to see some usage when Baton Pass was around in DPP, but the move's ban explains Umbreon's lesser usage as well. All of this suggests to players that there may be better defensive options for them to run over Umbreon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Umbreon can also run Heal Bell + Pursuit alongside Wish + Protect, helping it deal with various variants of Gengar. Will-O-Wisp Gengar gets punished because of Umbreon's ability, Synchronize, if it uses the move, and the combination of Heal Bell and Pursuit allows Umbreon to remove that status and trap Gengar. Umbreon can also use Pursuit to trap Starmie and Choice Specs or Choice Scarf Latias. It has to be careful when those Pokemon use their powerful STAB moves because it could put Umbreon in a range where it may need to use Wish to heal, thereby forcing a mind game between using Wish on the Starmie or Latias potentially staying in or Pursuit on those two switching out. Instead of using Wish + Protect on the Curse set, one could opt for the combination of Rest + Sleep Talk to negate the need for a Heal Bell user, as Rest already allows it to eliminate status ailments such as burn, paralysis, and poison; however, a Heal Bell user could still be helpful with allowing Umbreon to wake up immediately or curing it of freeze.</p> <h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Almost every Steel-type, like Skarmory, Jirachi, Lucario, Scizor, or Heatran, can come in and punish Umbreon. Skarmory can assuredly set an entry hazard and inflict Taunt on Umbreon before it can use Taunt back because of its higher Speed. Jirachi can inflict Toxic on Umbreon or possibly set up on if running a bulky Calm Mind set. Scizor and Lucario usually get a free Swords Dance, which can make them threatening. Heatran has access to burn-inducing moves like Will-O-Wisp and Lava Plume, can cripple Umbreon with Toxic, shut it down with Taunt, take it down with Explosion, or even use Metal Sound to cause Special Defense drops so that it can beat Umbreon with a Fire-type move such as Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Pokemon like Machamp, Heracross, and Infernape threaten Umbreon with their powerful physical Fighting-type moves. They may need to be careful of Umbreon carrying Toxic, though. One of the best Fighting-type switch-ins to Umbreon would be a Poison Heal Breloom. Breloom can come in freely on Umbreon, and it behind a Substitute is one of the most threatening Pokemon in the metagame.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users: Taunt users like Gliscor can stop Umbreon if sand is up, as it negates Umbreon's Leftovers recovery and Umbreon's low damage output, by blocking its recovery with Taunt and using Earthquake to defeat it. A Gliscor with Knock Off will help it even further in beating Umbreon, as it will remove Umbreon's Leftovers.</p> <p><strong>Phazers: Pokemon like Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Milotic can negate Umbreon's Curse boosts. Hippowdon and Skarmory can remove it from the field with Whirlwind, whereas Milotic can use Haze to clear any state changes. Umbreon's low base Attack will not be enough to threaten these Pokemon when they try to negate its stat boosts.</p> <p><strong>Trick and Status Users: Pokemon like Latias and Rotom, which are among the few that Umbreon can switch into and set up on, can possibly defeat all variants of Umbreon by using Trick on it or defeat Curse Umbreon with status moves like Toxic or Will-O-Wisp.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This set is capable of enhancing Umbreon's strengths and weaknesses while also giving it more longevity. Curse boosts the power of Payback, which allows Umbreon to hit the foe with a move that has an effective Base Power of 150, since Umbreon generally tends to move last because of its low Speed, which Curse lowers even further. Curse also helps Umbreon boost its physical bulk, which is what most Pokemon will try to target, since physical moves such as Superpower and Close Combat are what usually can OHKO Umbreon. Wish + Protect helps Umbreon heal while also being able to heal up its teammates or scout for a set on an opposing Pokemon. A lot of bulky offense teams will also rely on Explosion to stop a Curse Umbreon, and Protect can be helpful in such a situation.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers helps keep Umbreon healthy and negate sand damage. A Careful nature with maximum HP and Special Defense investment allows Umbreon to not worry about special attackers; very few Pokemon are capable of threatening Umbreon with a special move, and one of that would be, Focus Blast Gengar, can be OHKOed with Payback. Pokemon such as Infernape and Lucario can also carry Focus Blast, but they more commonly run the physical counterpart, Close Combat.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is possible for Umbreon to set up versus special attackers like Starmie and non Will-O-Wisp-Rotom or against a Tyranitar that is Choice-locked into a move like Crunch or Pursuit. If the opponent uses a move that causes limited damage to Umbreon, like Crunch or Pursuit, the best option would be to set up with Curse at that point. However, if it is a move that is capable of inflicting 30% or higher damage, it would be better to use Wish. The goal is to keep setting up while using Wish to heal Umbreon from any damage it takes and then potentially sweep an opposing team. Umbreon can also use Latias as a Pokemon to set up on, but it needs to be wary of Toxic or Trick. It is important that if the opponent runs a Skarmory or another Steel-type, you need to take it out before you reveal that your Umbreon is running the Curse set, as that would cue to your opponent to try to preserve their Steel-types longer than they should.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Steel-types are what heavily punish Umbreon, as they will always be able to safely switch into it as Umbreon is passive and cannot affect them due to Umbreon being passive and unable to affect them with a status move like Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp. Magnezone aids Umbreon in this regard by trapping Skarmory and Scizor, as well as Lucario if Lucario is running a physical set and Magnezone is using Choice Scarf. Umbreon could pair itself with a Heal Bell or Aromatherapy user in order to remove a status like burn or poison, which will prevent it from potentially sweeping by reducing its damage output or gradually causing it to faint. Other Pokemon that can safely switch into Umbreon would be Breloom and Leftovers Heatran. The former can threaten it with Spore or a combination of Substitute + Focus punch, so having a Pokemon to absorb the Spore and the hit would be nice. Zapdos, Latias, and Celebi are among a few that can take on Breloom, but make sure that they don't take the Spore. By looking at what all Pokemon your opponent has revealed and by predicting what the unrevealed Pokemon, if any, of your opponent would be, you can determine what Pokemon in your team would have the least impact against the opposing team and let that Pokemon absorb the Spore. Heatran can be handled by Milotic and Clefable. Clefable especially is a good option to handle the Leftovers variant with Knock Off, limiting the number of times Heatran can come onto the field. Since physical Fighting-types are quite common in the tier, Umbreon with teammates to take on such users is helpful. Bold Rotom and Jolly Gliscor can take on Lucario, but they still would need to worry about Lucario running Crunch or Shuca Berry with Ice Punch, respectively. Latias can handle Infernape. Nidoqueen is especially a nice option, as it helps absorb Toxic Spikes on the field.</p> "

  "Forretress": {
    "overview": "<p>Forretress's access to Rapid Spin and all three entry hazards allow it to provide unmatched team support. Reliable Rapid Spinners are rare in DPP OU, and Forretress is one of the best at it. It takes advantage of defensive teams commonly using choiced Tyranitar to prevent Rapid Spin via Pursuit trapping. Forretress also can fight back against Ghost-type spinblockers such as Gengar and Rotom-A with Payback, as it will 2HKO Gengar and 3HKO defensive Rotom-A after Stealth Rock in sand. With its stellar typing and bulk, Forretress is generally able to set up at least a layer of either Spikes or Toxic Spikes. Forretress with Rest or Wish support is notably a good answer to defensive teams without a spinblocker. Defensive Pokemon often deal with Forretress with status, Knock Off, and entry hazard damage, allowing Forretress to set up entry hazards of its own and Rapid Spin easily. Forretress can run both specially defensive and physically defensive sets; specially defensive sets can set up entry hazards on more Pokemon and notably can survive Magnezone's Hidden Power Fire. Physically defensive sets take less damage from foes trying to wear down Forretress with physical moves, such as Skarmory using Brave Bird and Metagross using Earthquake.</p> <p>Forretress has noticeable flaws that mostly limit it to use on defensive teams. Forretress struggles to fit Explosion and cannot phaze, meaning it is set up fodder for the majority of the tier. Forretress's Fire weakness is easily exploitable by offensive Pokemon such as Heatran, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragonite, mixed Flygon, and Jirachi. Since Forretress needs to set up entry hazards and Rapid Spin away entry hazards, it can struggle with trying to do too much, especially if it needs to come in multiple times and use Rapid Spin. Especially if it lacks Rest, it is deathly afraid of Knock Off and status, because it is slow and will get worn down quickly. Forretress also is trapped by Magnezone and typically cannot fit Earthquake to fight back.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Forretress has many other options to include into its other two moveslots besides Spikes and Rapid Spin. Forretress can fit Stealth Rock onto either of these sets, but typically doesn't have the room for it. Another form of recovery Forretress has is Pain Split, but it isnt reliable enough to use consistently. Forretress has Zap Cannon and Counter to help dissuade set up too. Zap Cannon 2HKO Gyarados and physically defensive Skarmory while ruining Gengar with paralysis. Watch out for its low accuracy, however. Counter can KO opponents trying to break through with physical attacks, but physical sweepers such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Dragonite commonly use Fire Punch that OHKOs Forretress at +1 anyway. Revenge is another attack that takes advantage of Forretress's low Speed, providing coverage against Lucario, Tyranitar, and, to an extent, Magnet Rise Magnezone. Forretress can also use Light Screen to better protect itself against special attacks. Other options such as Power Trip to give itself a strong Payback or Explosion, Refresh to heal itself of status, and Sleep Talk alongside Rest are possible, but generally are not worth the moveslot. Forretress has some variablility in items. Forretress can use a Macho Brace to power up Gyro Ball. It notably OHKOs Gengar and Dragon Dance Tyranitar at +1 after Stealth Rock. Occa Berry allows Forretress to live weaker Fire-type hits more comfotably, such as Rotom-A's Overheat, mixed Flygon's Fire Blast, and Latias and Magnezone's Hidden Power Fire. It generally is not worth losing Leftovers, however.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Heatran and Infernape easily OHKO Forretress and only have to worry about the uncommon Earthquake or Explosion in Infernape's case.</p> <p><strong>Magnet Pull: Magnezone traps Forretress and removes it with either Hidden Power Fire or Thunderbolt while most Forretress can only set up entry hazards or Rapid Spin in return. Choice Scarf Magneton almost never carries Hidden Power Fire but threatens Forretress the same. Both need to watch out for Earthquake, as it will OHKO them after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Surprise Fire-type attacks: Forretress is generally at least 2HKOed by any Fire-type attack. As such, Forretress is typically threatened out by anything that could potentially have one, such as Jirachi, Flygon, Dragonite, Tyranitar, Roserade, and Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Residual damage: Forretress has no reliable recovery and is grounded, meaning it can easily get worn down over the course of the match as entry hazard damage adds up. Various other ways to wear down Forretress, such as with status, Knock Off removing Leftovers, and weak attacks can leave Forretress too low on HP to do its job, especially without Wish support or Rest.</p> <p><strong>Set-up threats</strong>: Even with various coverage and Explosion, Forretress is not able to mitigate set-up against the majority of the tier. Dragon Dance Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Gyarados can set up with impunity on most Forretress; Substitute attackers such as Breloom, Heatran, Empoleon, Machamp, and Jirachi freely generate momentum; Swords Dance Lucario, Scizor, and Gliscor threaten to sweep the whole team; and Calm Mind attackers such as Suicune, Clefable, Latias, and Jirachi boost easily. Some of these can be threatened by Explosion and coverage, however.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Gengar and Rotom-A block Rapid Spin and can be annoying to deal with. Gengar 2HKOs with Focus Blast Forretress should it have a Life Orb and can OHKO with the rare Hidden Power Fire, while Rotom-A roasts Forretress with Overheat. Both can burn Forretress with Will-O-Wisp to make its Payback very weak. However, both do not enjoy switching into Payback.</p> <p><strong>Powerful attackers</strong>: Forretress, especially on the special side, is not very bulky. Strong attacks, such as Starmie's Hydro Pump, Breloom's Focus Punch, Machamp's DynamicPunch, and Kingdra's Rain boosted Hydro Pump, can easily at least 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Forretress often does not carry many attacking moves and is forced to do nothing under the effects of Taunt. Azelf and Aerodactly are especially effective early in the game to prevent entry hazards, while Gengar can Taunt a burned Forretress or one that does not have Payback. Taunt + Dragon Dance Gyarados, while rare, decimates Forretress without Explosion. Azelf and Aerodactyl often cannot stop Forretress from spinning away Stealth Rock, however.</p> ",

        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Forretress can leverage its naturally high physical defense to fully invest in special defense. This notably gives it several advantages: Forretress can survive strong special attacks such as Latias and Dragonite's Draco Meteor as well as Gengar's Focus Blast while still retaining enough physical bulk to switch into and set up on physical threats whose STAB types it resists, such as Metagross, Scizor, and Jirachi without Fire Punch. It also survives Timid Magnezone's Hidden Power Fire with certainty while Thunderbolt is an unlikely 2HKO. This mixed bulk affords it to set up entry hazards or use Rapid Spin. Forretress often needs to pick between setting up Spikes or Toxic Spikes—Spikes are often more valuable due to hitting more Pokemon, but Toxic Spikes are uniquely useful for wearing down Tyranitar, Blissey, Hippowdon, and other common defensive Pokemon. Rapid Spin is of critical importance to Forretress, as it is one of few viable users of the move. Forretress's typing, bulk, and ability to set up entry hazards often provides opportunities to use Rapid Spin.</p> <p>Payback is Forretress's primary offensive option and facilitates it using Rapid Spin. One huge advantage to special bulk is it allows Forretress to use Rapid Spin against defensive Rotom-A, as it only scores a 4HKO with Thunderbolt in sand. Payback allows Forretress to pressure Rotom-A and Gengar, making it more difficult to block Rapid Spin. Forretress must beware of Hidden Power Fire and Overheat while additionally does not enjoy being burnt by Will-O-Wisp without cleric support, however. With Pursuit support, Forretress can also drop Payback for the more generally threatening Toxic. Toxic allows Forretress to fight back against set up threats that can't mitigate status well, such as Dragon Dance Gyarados. It can still pressure offensive Rotom-A with Toxic. The last option affords Forretress some survivability. Protect allows Forretress to recover through Iron Head Jirachi with Leftovers while also scouting attacks and stopping Choice Scarf Copycat Lucario. It also helps Forretress to more easily passively recover health if it is phazed in unexpectedly. However, with cleric support, Rest is another option to both fully heal Forretress and remove status. Forretress can drop Protect or Rest for a variety of other moves, such as Explosion, Stealth Rock, running both Toxic Spikes and Spikes, Gyro Ball, and Earthquake. However, Forretress often sorely misses recovery due to being grounded and tasked with removing entry hazards.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>To get the benefits of a specially defensive spread, Forretress should run max special bulk with a Careful nature. Forretress can run an Impish nature with max special bulk to try to better take on physical threats, but this often leaves Forretress struggling to take on weaker special attackers such as Rotom-A and not bulky enough to repeatedly set up on Skarmory with Brave Bird and Swampert. Forretress can run Shed Shell, but it typically can survive one Magnezone attack anyway and sorely misses Leftovers recovery.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Forretress must be played carefully, as it is a grounded Rapid Spinner without reliable recovery and set up fodder for a lot of the offensive threats of the tier. Forretress should generally prioritize getting at least one layer of entry hazards down to facilitate wearing the foe down unless the team desperately needs it to Rapid Spin. Forretress struggles to switched in repeatedly to remove entry hazards and should be used cautiously, as that alone can result in Forretress losing up to 50% of its health over the course of a few turns, which is not easily recovered back with Leftovers alone. Leverage the threat of Rapid Spin to set up entry hazards; Forretress is at its best when the threat of it Rapid Spinning away entry hazards is too great not to reflexively switch to a spinblocker. Keep Forretress away from Knock Off especially if it does not have Rest, as it will get worn down very easily from entry hazards and weak attacks. Forretress should use Rest sparingly against more offensive teams, as it becomes even more of a sitting duck when it is asleep. Protect can similarly be taken advantage of.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Forretress should be used in the context of a stall team, as it provides entry hazards effectively and needs strong partners to take on the threats it lets in. Some of Forretress's best partners are strong defensive Flying-types such as RestTalk Gyarados and physically defensive Zapdos. Both are fantastic walls, but are held back by their Stealth Rock weakness. Gyarados is especially helpful in taking on hyper offensive teams, as once Forretress gets rid of Stealth Rock, it can just phaze out threats such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragon Dance Tyranitar lacking Stone Edge with its bulk and Intimidate. Forretress also appreciates sand to help wear down Ghost-types. Both Hippowdon and Choice Scarf Tyranitar are effective, sometimes even both on the same team. Hippowdon appreciates Rapid Spin, sets up Stealth Rock, and is very bulky. Choice Scarf Tyranitar traps Ghost-types and Starmie, provides speed control, and can also set up Stealth Rock. Forretress also appreciates strong special walls: Clefable is the standard, as it has Encore to help stop special set up sweepers, can spread Knock Off to wear foes down, and answers many threats well. It also can provide Heal Bell support to facilitate Rest. Blissey similarly can help wall special threats, but isn't immune to entry hazards like Clefable is. Latias has fantastic type synergy with Forretress as they resists each others weakness and can use Roar to prevent set up from Substitute special attackers such as Suicune and Jirachi. Latias can even go on the offensive with a Calm Mind + Hidden Power Fire set. Calm Mind + RestTalk Suicune also appreciates Rapid Spin support, provides a strong answer answer to Water- and Fire-types, and is a strong win condition. Celebi also performs similarly as a strong wall that likes Rapid Spin support.</p> <p>Forretress also appreaciates defensive redundancy, as it doesn't enjoy being the only switch in to Dragon-types on the team. Defensive Jirachi is an excellent choice, as it also provides Wish support and sponges both physical and special Dragon-type attacks. Cresselia absorbs mixed Flygon especially well and can even use Lunar Dance to heal Forretress back up. Swampert also can withstand Dragon-type attacks and set up Stealth Rock. Forretress also appreciates Heatran's type synergy and facilitates its defensive and Torment sets with entry hazards. Rotom-A can block Rapid Spin from Starmie and opposing Forretress while also helping Forretress out against physical Substitute users such as Breloom, Machamp, and Jirachi.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Physically defensive Forretress takes advantage of the more common specially defensive set to surprise the opponent. This Forretress is much more difficult to wear down by repeatedly bashing it with physical moves. Once Forretress switches in something it can set up on such as Hippowdon, physical Swampert, Metagross, Bronzong, or Skarmory, they might just attack Forretress to wear it down. These weak attacks do much less damage and Forretress can come back in later in the game to more easily set up entry hazards and Rapid Spin. Spikes and Rapid Spin make up the crux of this set, although Forretress can also use Toxic Spikes if they are more needed. Beware that DPP OU is much more resilient to Toxic Spikes than Spikes, however.</p> <p>Forretress can more easily afford to use offensive moves with this set, as it abandons trying to survive strong special hits and uses Forretress's good movepool to take advantage of the opponent. Payback again features to hit Ghost-types on the switch as Forretress is no longer bulky enough to take their attacks effectively, but another option is Gyro Ball. Forretress is very slow, and pressures fast threats such as Gengar with a 2HKO. However, another advantage is to unsuspectingly hit Dragon Dance sweepers hard, as Tyranitar and Dragonite do not enjoy it and Forretress is bulky enough to beat Gyarados trying to set up on it after Stealth Rock. Earthquake hits Magnezone and Heatran very hard, OHKOing bulkless sets after Stealth Rock. It also helps to pressure Infernape, Metagross, Lucario, and Calm Mind Jirachi trying to set up Forretress. However, another option is Explosion. Explosion makes Forretress much more threatening and denies set up opportunities altogether to foes who do not resist it. It also surprises defensive Pokemon who normally set up on Forretress easily, such as Calm Mind Suicune, Clefable, and Latias. Forretress can also drop an attacking move to run both entry hazards or even Stealth Rock to get entry hazards up quickly.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Forretress needs max HP and an Impish nature to take on physical attacks well. Forretress should use a Relaxed nature and 0 Spe IVs if it uses Gyro Ball. Should it use Earthquake, it needs 112 EVs to OHKO bulkless Heatran and Magnezone after Stealth Rock. The rest can be put into defense. Forretress can run a fully physically defensive spread if these benchmarks aren't needed. Forretress can use spare some EVs into its special defense, as the stat is quite low, but needs full investment before it can take special hits reliably. Forretress generally should be using Leftovers to help mitigate residual damage, as it typically will not have Protect or Rest with this set. However, since it has no Magnezone protection outside of hitting it on the switch with Earthquake, Shed Shell is an option to escape.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>While it has more options to defend itself, Forretress should still be played carefully, as most strong special attacks will at least 2HKO it. Keep Forretress away from Ghost-types once they come in even with Payback. Forretress should generally come in early into the game to set up entry hazards and then only sparingly to Rapid Spin afterwards due to easily getting worn down and its relative passivity. Hitting threats on the switch is especially important with this Forretress, as Earthquake is often unexpected and can surprise Magnezone and Heatran. Leverage Forretress's increased physical bulk to come into threats that can't hurt it effectively, like Metagross, choiced Tyranitar, and Skarmory to set up entry hazards and Rapid Spin away the opponent's entry hazards. Espcially against offensive teams that can't get rid of Forretress's entry hazards, Forretress is more free to sacrifice itself to stop an opposing sweep with Explosion or pull off a crucial Rapid Spin.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>While Forretress appreciates defensive teammates, physically defensive Forretress can find itself on more offensive teams due to providing strong Rapid Spin support and still posing a threat with its coverage and Explosion. Physically defensive Forretress can be used over the specially defensive set on teams with very strong defensive cores that only need Forretress to Rapid Spin and set up entry hazards. Physically defensive Hippowdon, physical defensive Zapdos, and defensive Jirachi are excellent teammates that appreciate Rapid Spin and are difficult to break for offensive teams. Jirachi can even provide Wish support. Calm Mind + RestTalk Suicune is also a great choice as a wall that can sweep with Rapid Spin support and provides an excellent Heatran and Fire Punch Jirachi check. Clefable also provides Knock Off and Encore to help prevent special set up threats as well as provides a switch into mixed Flygon. On these types of teams, the only defensive responsibilies Forretress has it to absorb Trick from Metagross, Rotom-A, and Latias.</p> <p>On offensive teams, Forretress helps to mitigate Skarmory's impact, provide a check to dangerous attackers with Explosion, and set up Spikes. Forretress enjoys a crippled Skarmory so it can no longer repeatedly phaze it away after Skarmory sets up entry hazards. Trick Metagross is an excellent partner, as Skarmory very commonly switches in on it. Choice Scarf and Iron Ball permanently cripple Skarmory and allow Forretress to blunt its impact more easily. Forretress also appreciates Pursuit support to remove Rotom-A and Gengar, as both easily 2HKO it. Gyarados, especially Taunt sets, appreciate Forretress spreading entry hazards and removing Rapid Spin. Spinblockers such as Gengar and Choice Scarf Rotom-A are effective in preventing the opponent from Rapid Spinning. Rotom-A also helps to revenge kill threats Forretress does not like taking on, such as Dragon Dance Dragonite, Swords Dance Lucario, and Agility Empoleon.</p> "

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>With an incredible 130 base Attack, a Technician Bullet Punch, and a potent STAB-boosted U-turn, Scizor is definitely a force to be reckoned with in the OU metagame. Its Bug / Steel-typing gives it a whopping ten resistances with only one weakness, which enables it to answer Pokemon like Gengar, Latias, Metagross, Bronzong, Tyranitar, Starmie, and Dragonite. It is capable of revenge killing, scouting, and even sweeping teams with the help of Swords Dance.</p> <p>That said, Scizor has its fair share of flaws. Entry hazards are especially devastating, as Scizor needs to be decently healthy to reliably switch into what it's supposed to check. Magnezone can consistently trap and remove Scizor with Hidden Power Fire, as it can often catch it on a Choice-locked Bullet Punch or while it sets up with Swords Dance. Its 4x weakness to Fire-type attacks means that it can often be KOed by a surprise Hidden Power Fire and Pokemon like Jirachi, Zapdos, and Infernape can force it out easily.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While it may seem like Scizor has a shallow movepool, it can actually use a decent number of alternative moves. The Choice Band set can utilize Night Slash, Return, and Double Hit. Night Slash can surprise Rotom-A with massive damage, while Return and Double Hit can provide neutral coverage on foes such as Zapdos and Gyarados. Scizor can use Baton Pass in conjunction with moves such as Swords Dance, Agility, and Iron Defense, but other Pokemon like Gliscor are often better at using this strategy. Knock Off and Toxic can be used on a very defensive set, but once again other Pokemon can use these moves more effectively. Scizor's secondary ability, Swarm, can be used in conjunction with Liechi or Salac Berry in order to pull off a low HP sweep. However, when using Swarm, be sure to use X-Scissor over Bug Bite, as without Technician, X-Scissor is the superior move. Reversal can also be used effectively in tandem with sets sweeping at low HP.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Rotom-A is easily the best counter to Scizor, packing resistances to Bug and Steel as well as an immunity to Fighting. However, Choice variants will have to be wary of Pursuit when locked into a resisted attack, and the odd Night Slash can catch Rotom-A off guard. Gyarados also does extremely well, being able to switch into almost any move Scizor could possibly carry with no repercussions due to Intimidate. Zapdos is in the same boat as Gyarados, and while it may not have Intimidate on its side, it can Roost off any damage incurred or retaliate with Heat Wave, something Gyarados can't do.</p> <p>Heatran's 4x resistances to Bug- and Steel-type attacks makes it a good choice for countering Scizor. However, switching into Superpower can mean a quick death for Heatran, so be wary. Magnezone works extremely similarly, and if it can get in on a Pursuit or Bullet Punch, it guarantees Scizor's elimination due to Magnet Pull. Scarf Magnezone with Hidden Power Fire is especially notable for doing this, as it cannot be outsped by non-Choiced Scizor.</p> <p>The majority of physical walls can perform relatively well against the Choice Band set, such as Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Skarmory. Skarmory specifically packs a 4x resistance to U-turn and a 2x resistance to Bullet Punch, so it can take advantage of Scizor to lay down Spikes. Forretress can do the same, but lack of instant recovery makes it a slightly more unreliable choice, as it can be worn down more easily by Superpower or random hits. However, note that these Pokemon do not do nearly as well against Swords Dance Scizor, which can pack Roost to turn these Pokemon into setup fodder. They are also reliably 2HKOed by Scizor's moves, be it Bullet Punch or Bug Bite for Gliscor and Hippowdon or Brick Break / Superpower for Forretress and Skarmory.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Choice Band Scizor's massive 591 Attack, combined with STAB U-turn and priority in the form of Technician Bullet Punch, makes it a solid revenge killer and scouter. Bullet Punch is the crux of its set. After STAB and the Technician boost, it sports 90 Base Power, which allows it to pick off a weakened opposing sweeper, like Dragonite, Gyarados, and even Lucario after a Defense drop from Close Combat. It can also OHKO frailer Pokemon like Gengar and Roserade. U-turn hits incredibly hard and allows Scizor to scout for its counters and bring in a counter of your own. Superpower allows Scizor to OHKO Blissey and Clefable, while also OHKOing two of its most common checks, Magnezone and Heatran, as they switch in. For the final slot, Pursuit can allow Scizor to pick off opposing Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Latias locked into resisted moves, as well as Gengar and Starmie. On the other hand, Quick Attack provides Scizor with the ability to revenge weakened Zapdos, Gyarados, or Kingdra more effectively.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maxmizing HP and Attack is best suited for Choice Scizor to function as a strong, bulky pivot. While you have the option to invest a bit of Speed into Scizor to speed creep against opposing Scizor and Nidoqueen, this is generally not worth it, as the benefits of being able to use Superpower versus opposing Scizor first don't usually outweigh Scizor's ability to take a hit and then use U-turn last. Furthermore, at minimum, Scizor should have 248 HP EVs and 4 SpD EVs, as with this investment it's able to always survive Life Orb Starmie's Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The best way to use Choice Band Scizor is to send it in early-game versus something it forces out, so that you can gain momentum by using Scizor's very powerful U-turn, which even does significant damage to a few foes that resist it. Scizor really wants to retain as much of its HP as possible, so try to utilize it when Stealth Rock is not up, if possible. Be careful when locking onto moves like Bullet Punch and Superpower because the opponent may have a Magnezone in the back to trap Scizor, or something like Substitute Gengar to take advantage of Scizor being locked into Superpower. Overall, it's very important to try to use U-turn as much as possible for scouting purposes, gaining momentum, and taking advantage of Scizor having the strongest U-turn in OU.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is Scizor's best friend, as it allows Scizor to revenge kill Pokemon such as Dragonite and Gengar much more easily. It also allows Scizor's team to take maximum advantage of the switches that U-turn commonly induces. Once Stealth Rock is up, the best teammates for Scizor are Pokemon who can switch into its common counters and either eliminate them or force them out. Tyranitar can eliminate opposing Rotom-A, as well as covering opposing Heatran and Zapdos. Heatran can absorb Will-O-Wisp from Rotom or Heat Wave from Zapdos, and possibly lure and Explode on bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Vaporeon, and Swampert. For a more offensive option, effective teammates include frail sweepers such as Gengar and Infernape that can take advantage of free switches scouted by U-turn.</p> <p>Packing a Rapid Spinner can also be advantageous when using Choice Band Scizor, as Stealth Rock and Spikes can prove to be a nightmare for Scizor, which can find itself switching in often. Starmie is the best spinner to pair with Scizor, as it resists Fire and has access to instant recovery. Meanwhile, if Scizor can eliminate Blissey with Pursuit, Starmie is capable of sweeping late-game. Forretress can also function well, as it reinforces Scizor's resistances and can also provide Spikes support to take advantage of the switches caused by Scizor's power. However, be cautious of doubling up on Fire weaknesses, since Forretress and Scizor have the same typing.</p> "

        "name": "Bulky Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With its excellent Bug / Steel typing and decent bulk, Scizor is able to act as a bulky Swords Dance setup sweeper. It's able to check foes like Bronzong, Metagross, and Latias thanks to its typing and can be hard to take down thanks to the longevity granted by its access to Roost to heal itself with, as well as Leftovers.</p> <p>Swords Dance is the best way to increase Scizor's Attack, and when paired with Technician and the powerful priority move Bullet Punch, it can make Scizor into one of the most terrifying sweepers. Swords Dance also allows Scizor to scare off Latias, Bronzong, and Metagross, or in Bronzong's and Metagross's cases, force them to use Explosion. U-turn is recommended, as Scizor can use it to gain momentum or even escape from a Magnezone that switches in. It will also do a lot of damage to Pokemon that don't resist it, such as Flygon, Jirachi, Suicune, and Swampert. Combined with this set's high Special Defense investment, it's a good answer to Starmie as well. Superpower is an alternative that can KO Heatran, Metagross, Magnezone, and Lucario, not to mention that it'll make Skarmory feel less serene. However, in some situations, the Defense drop caused by Superpower may leave Scizor a bit vulnerable. Furthermore, be aware that with Steel / Fighting coverage, Starmie now resists both of Scizor's moves. Because Bug Bite doesn't force Scizor out like U-turn and doesn't drop its Defense like Superpower, it's a decent option as well, especially against Metagross and Bronzong, although it makes Scizor extremely vulnerable to Magnezone and Heatran. Brick Break is a fourth option that aims to hit the same targets as Superpower but is significantly weaker. It may be the preferred option for its higher PP, lack of drops in Attack and Defense, and ability to break through opposing Reflect and Light Screen.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given spread is pretty straightforward. 248 HP EVs allow Scizor to best utilize its bulk, and 56 EVs in Attack with an Adamant nature allow Scizor to always 2HKO Tyranitar after Stealth Rock damage and always OHKO Tyranitar after a Swords Dance and Stealth Rock damage. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense in order to maximize Scizor's special bulk, which improves its odds against foes like Starmie, Latias, and Jolteon. Note that an alternative spread of 16 EVs in Attack with an Adamant nature and 244 EVs in Special Defense is an option if you would prefer more special bulk. Shed Shell is a possible option for escaping Magnezone's Magnet Pull smoothly; however, Leftovers remains crucial in order to help Scizor stay at a comfortable amount of health.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switch Scizor into Pokemon that typically cannot 2HKO it, such as Metagross, Bronzong, Outrage-locked Dragon-types, and Choice-locked Latias. After that, use a combination of Swords Dance and Roost to effectively set up. While it's quite effective to set up Swords Dance late-game when Scizor's checks and counters have been KOed or weakened, it can also be effective to set up Swords Dance early- or mid-game to put pressure on the opponent, which Scizor can do effectively thanks to its good typing and bulk. Try to use U-turn early-game to scout the opposing team and see if it has a Magnezone. If Magnezone is healthy and Scizor lacks U-turn, you might want to double switch in order to escape the obvious Magnezone switch-in. You can also throw out a Superpower if you're expecting a weakened Magnezone to switch in, preventing it from trapping and removing Scizor. However, when using Superpower, be careful about the Defense drop, as it can make Pokemon like Metagross, Bronzong, and Flygon much more threatening. If your team has paralysis support, try to cripple opposing Heatran and Magnezone in order to make them easier targets for Scizor's Superpower.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Scizor has a large number of counters such as Heatran, Fire Punch Jirachi, Zapdos, Rotom-A, Skarmory, Infernape, and Haze Milotic. Pokemon that can threaten those counters are often good teammates. Zapdos is a reliable one, as it can threaten Haze Milotic, Gyarados, Jirachi, and Skarmory. Discharge Zapdos is good with Superpower Scizor in particular, as it can paralyze opposing Heatran and Magnezone. Tyranitar is a great teammate, not only because it can Pursuit trap Zapdos and most Rotom-A, but also because it is able to wear down and scare off Heatran. Jirachi's Body Slam paralysis support can be essential as mentioned above, given the help it provides for Superpower Scizor. Jirachi is also able to lure Heatran decently well with Hidden Power Ground, which somewhat compensates for the nasty Fire-type weakness that it and Scizor share. In the same vein, Latias is a pretty nice teammate, as it has perfect type synergy with Scizor and can drop a Draco Meteor or even a Hidden Power Fire to weaken Steel-types. In addition to that, Latias can offer paralysis support with Thunder Wave to shut down opposing Heatran and Magnezone. Heatran has very good synergy with Scizor, as it can switch into Fire-type attacks and power up thanks to Flash Fire, as well as being able to check foes such as Fire Punch Jirachi, Skarmory, and Zapdos. Magma Storm Heatran can trap and remove Swampert, while Toxic variants can assist in wearing down Milotic, Zapdos, and Gyarados. Breloom can take care of Swampert and Milotic or force a counter to sleep with Spore. Moreover, it forms a powerful offensive combination with Swords Dance Scizor. If you add Zapdos to this core, you have the potential to break through the bulkiest of teams, but be wary of the Fire weakness stacking. Starmie is a good teammate as well for spinning away the Spikes that Scizor hates, and it has great synergy with Scizor, as it can switch into Fire moves from threats such as Heatran and Infernape and force them out with Hydro Pump. Swampert and Gyarados are both good teammates as well thanks to their Fire-type resistance and ability to overwhelm and wear down Skarmory and Zapdos for Scizor. Magnezone can trap Skarmory for Scizor. Lastly, Porygon2 and Swords Dance Scizor are incredibly synergistic, especially if Scizor has Superpower. Porygon2 is able to shut down Gyarados and Heatran and can take special hits from the likes of Zapdos, Rotom-A, and mixed Flygon. It can also spread paralysis decently well against foes such as Jirachi, Heatran, and Magnezone, the latter of which it can trap by copying Magnet Pull with trace. Scizor can cover Gengar, Metagross, and Bronzong for it, as well as being able to switch into some variants of Tyranitar. Nevertheless, despite being an unusual choice, the synergy that Porygon2 shares with Scizor is stunning.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With Technician boosting the power of both Bullet Punch and Bug Bite, Scizor can run a terrifying offensive Swords Dance set. Bullet Punch is a fantastic priority option that Scizor can take tremendous advantage of thanks to the STAB boost and Technician. Bug Bite is Scizor's most powerful Bug-type attack, able to go as far as OHKOing Suicune, Metagross, Bronzong, and even the most physically bulky variant of Milotic after Stealth Rock damage and a Swords Dance boost. Superpower rounds out the set with coverage against Steel-types as well as Blissey and Clefable. Although the latter two would still sustain significant damage from Bug Bite due to their Normal typing, Scizor typically wants to be able to OHKO them due to fear of moves like Thunder Wave, Knock Off, and even Flamethrower. Quick Attack is a solid alternative to Bug Bite, as it's a great move for targeting offensive Water-types like Gyarados, Suicune, and Starmie, as well as Zapdos and Infernape.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Investing 224 Speed EVs into Scizor allows it to outspeed threats such as most Magnezone, Empoleon, fast Swampert, Choice Band Tyranitar, most Breloom, Milotic, and very bulky variants of Heatran. Maximizing Attack powers Scizor up as much as possible and secures crucial OHKOs after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs go into overall bulk, a small investment of which can still go a long way against foes like Suicune and Starmie and also allows Scizor to minimize Life Orb recoil. Life Orb is Scizor's best option for an item here, as this set's longevity isn't much better without it and the boost to its power is tremendously useful. Metal Coat may be an interesting alternative to try to salvage some longevity while bluffing a Choice item and still powering up Bullet Punch, but the extra power given to Bug Bite is extremely hard to give up. Jolly is an alternative nature choice that enables Scizor to outspeed most Bold Zapdos and Bold Celebi. By outspeeding Zapdos, Scizor can force some extra chip damage onto it upon getting KOed. Outpacing Bold Celebi can make the difference between Scizor getting revenge killed by Hidden Power Fire versus getting to KO Celebi with Bug Bite.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The best way to take advantage of this Scizor set is to send it in on a Pokemon Choice-locked into a resisted move like Flygon's Outrage, Latias's Draco Meteor, Rotom-A's Shadow Ball or Hidden Power Ice, or Tyranitar's Pursuit. Once Scizor is in safely, it shouldn't be too difficult to set up a Swords Dance. Once it has the boost, firing off attacks with Scizor's deceptively solid coverage can make even the sturdiest of defensive cores weep. Try to look out for your opponent's attempt to stall Scizor out by switching around and hoping for Life Orb damage to do enough to put it in range for a revenge killer to take out. Catching onto this quickly can make the difference between Scizor sweeping a team and losing out because it sustained too much Life Orb damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Although this Scizor is more of a standalone hyper offense sweeper, some teammates can support it by luring in its common checks. Metagross and Bronzong can lure in foes like Zapdos and Rotom-A and either wear them down with powerful STAB-boosted Steel-type attacks or remove other foes with Explosion. Lead Azelf can use Taunt early-game, set up Stealth Rock, and use Explosion to chip down a Steel-type like Jirachi or force Rotom-A in to take it. Tyranitar can take advantage of Rotom-A by either setting up on it with Dragon Dance or trapping and removing it with Pursuit. Offensive Calm Mind Suicune can wear down Gyarados, Swampert, and even physically defensive Zapdos. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock, fare decently against Zapdos and Rotom-A, and absorb Fire-type attacks like Fire Blast and Will-O-Wisp. Choice Scarf Rotom-A appreciates Scizor's ability to revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar, the setup sweeper that Rotom-A struggles the most against. Expert Belt Latias has fantastic offensive synergy with Scizor due to its ability to lure in Steel-types like Magnezone and Jirachi and hit them hard with a super effective Hidden Power Fire. In addition, it matches up well against Zapdos, Hippowdon, Heatran, and Gliscor. Scizor's effectiveness at luring in and weakening Skarmory with its powerful Superpower can open the gates for sweepers like Dragon Dance Kingdra and Dragon Dance Gyarados. In addition, a boosted Superpower can do enough to Skarmory to the point where fast Adamant Swampert can come in and finish it off with Waterfall. Swampert in particular has great type synergy with Scizor due to its resistance to Fire and immunity to Electric and is a great mid-game Stealth Rock setter.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Despite having Bullet Punch to overcome its low Speed, Scizor can often find itself requiring more Speed than the Choice Band set provides. This is most notable against Pokemon such as Starmie, Gengar, and Choice Scarf Rotom-A, all of whom have a chance to OHKO you before you can U-turn or Pursuit them. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Scizor is able to outspeed all of the aforementioned Pokemon and OHKO them with the appropriate move. Having such a fast and powerful U-turn also makes Choice Scarf Scizor an effective scout, able to avoid taking damage should the opponent refuse to switch.</p> <p>This set may lack the power of Choice Band, but it does not attempt to overpower the opponent like the Choice Band set does. Rather, Scizor is scouting the early-game with a fast U-turn before coming back in on a revenge kill to put someone into a checkmate position with Pursuit or Bullet Punch. This set's boosted Speed stat additionally allows it to check threats such as Swords Dance Lucario and non-Choice Scarf Heatran.</p> <p>The given EVs allow it to outspeed positive-nature base 120 Speed Pokemon, which is all Scizor needs. Only 216 Speed EVs are necessary to beat Starmie, if you'd like to give Scizor a little extra bulk. Bullet Punch is the main option as this allows you to nab some damage on the likes of Mach Punch Breloom and Infernape, Ice Shard Mamoswine, or Extreme Speed Dragonite and Lucario. Iron Head can be used instead for more power if such priority is not a concern. Night Slash is an option for hitting defensive Rotom-A as is Aerial Ace for hitting Breloom, Infernape, and Machamp. Even if you are running Iron Head over Bullet Punch, Technician is still the ability to use, since the power of Scizor's Pursuit rivals that of Choice Scarf Tyranitar's, which is especially important if your opponent does not switch.</p> <p>Since this set can take out Starmie and Gengar with ease, having partners who can sweep with these Pokemon removed is recommended. Heatran, Gyarados, and Dragonite make good partners, since they can switch in on the Fire-type moves aimed at Scizor. Gyarados, in particular, enjoys having Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Starmie removed from the picture. Alternatively, Swampert and Suicune make good choices since they can switch in on Fire-type moves and force the opponent out. Tyranitar earns a special mention since Scizor and Tyranitar have good synergy, and Scizor can U-turn to Tyranitar whose Pursuit can finish off the Rotom-A and Gengar weakened by Scizor. Since the loss of power from Choice Band means that Scizor won't be hitting as hard, bulky walls such as Skarmory, Swampert, and Suicune can often wall it. In the case of Suicune and Skarmory, they can often recover off the damage from Scizor's U-turn or Superpower, although with U-turn you can always switch to a counter without Scizor taking damage. It is good to have high-powered Electric-type attacks to help deal with these threats. Good Pokemon for the job include Magnezone, Zapdos, and your own Rotom-A.</p> "

  "Heracross": {
    "overview": "<p>Heracross can be seen as the herald of a dying age, as his basic game style has not changed drastically from when he was first introduced. He has always been offensively-oriented with his base 125 Attack stat, excellent ability in Guts that takes advantage of the burns that terrify most physical sweepers, and high-powered STAB moves. Although his main role has not changed much, he has been blessed with new tools for the job with every generation, such as Close Combat in DPP, and can now fill more roles than ever before.</p> <p>Despite this, Heracross usage has been constantly spiraling downward as fewer and fewer people use him. Heracross's base 85 Speed is simply not high enough in such a fast-paced metagame, and he is not able to stand up to super effective attacks from omnipresent, faster foes. More and more battlers are choosing faster or more versatile sweepers such as Infernape and Lucario, who both have access to strong priority and higher Speed stats. However, regardless of these shortcomings, Heracross remains one of the very best physical sweepers in the game and should under no circumstances be underestimated. He wasn't banned in Japan during the ADV generation for no reason!</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Heracross lacks anything else impressive in his movepool besides what is listed in his sets. Earthquake is great move, but has mostly redundant coverage with STAB Fighting-type attacks. Shadow Claw is pretty much the same as Night Slash, but Night Slash is always better because a type is immune to Shadow Claw. Other than these two attacks, just use what the sets suggest for moves.</p> <p>Swarm can be used over Guts on any of the listed sets, especially those that use Substitute. Swarm is almost always inferior to Guts, though, simply because one of Heracross's greatest assets is his benefiting from burn status. Leftovers can also be given to basically any set to increase Heracross's durability, but the loss of power allows many more Pokemon than usual to check Heracross, reducing his usability to almost unbearable levels.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Heracross is cursed with one of the largest checks and counters list in all of DPP OU, and this is reflected in his ever-dropping usage. Zapdos, Gliscor, Gyarados, Dragonite, Rotom-A, Tentacruel, and Gengar all resist both of Heracross's STAB moves. Beyond that, there exist many Pokemon that can switch into a predicted Close Combat or Megahorn with impunity and immediately threaten Heracross before he can change attacks. Choice Scarf Heatran and even Infernape can come in on Megahorn and end him harshly with Fire Blast. Skarmory can come in on Megahorn and either threaten to OHKO Heracross with Brave Bird or set up on him if he doesn't have Attack boosts. Faster Psychic-type Pokemon like Azelf can come in on Close Combat and threaten a Fire Blast or an Explosion. One of the most important things to know when facing a Heracross is that despite his low usage and his easily walled STABs, it is a fool's mistake to discredit him offensively. He is one of the strongest Pokemon around, and under no circumstances should you forget that.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Heracross's mediocre Speed is a letdown as a sweeper, especially because so much of the metagame can revenge kill him. With a Choice Scarf, Heracross can switch in with his numerous resistances and immediately threaten the opposing Pokemon. However, Heracross's power is relatively limited without either Swords Dance or Choice Band, so predicting appropriately and switching into Toxic or Will-O-Wisp is advisable. With a Guts boost, Choice Scarf Heracross can rip through much of DPP OU like a chainsaw through a loaf of bread.</p> <p>Close Combat and Megahorn are the high-power STAB attacks for which Heracross is famous. Stone Edge is essential on Heracross, as Heracross's STAB attacks mainly draw in Flying-types such as Zapdos, Dragonite, and Gyarados, all of whom are weak to Rock. Heracross has a lot of interesting options available to him for his final attack. Because Heracross is not as powerful when holding a Choice Scarf, bulky Pokemon have no trouble switching into him and forcing him out; Toxic is a nasty surprise for these Pokemon, especially on a Choice set. Night Slash is an option because Rotom-A is one of Heracross's most common switch-ins due to its immunity to Close Combat and resistance to Megahorn. Though Sleep Talk may seem unreliable because it only works if your opponent has a sleep-inducing Pokemon, Heracross can be a dangerous threat with his Guts-boosted attacks when asleep. However, like with Toxic, being locked into Sleep Talk opens up opportunities for the opponent to set up, so use it with caution. Note that Sleep Talk only works once per switch-in with a Choice item.</p> <p>A simple EV spread of 252 Attack and 252 Speed is standard for a set like this. Jolly is the recommended nature to outspeed Timid Choice Scarf Heatran, Jolly Gyarados after a Dragon Dance, and Modest Empoleon after an Agility, among others. If these threats can be dealt with elsewhere, then Adamant is perfectly acceptable for the Attack boost.</p> <p>It's important to capitalize on Heracross's unique traits, the most important of those being his Guts ability. For this reason, Pokemon that attract burn or poison status make excellent teammates to consider. Metagross and Swampert are good candidates to fit this role, as the former commonly lures Will-O-Wisp and the latter Toxic. Both of them can also set up Stealth Rock, which helps against the many Flying-types switching into Heracross. Rotom-A and Flying-type Pokemon are issues Heracross will come across frequently, so packing a Pokemon that can easily defeat them is highly recommended. Tyranitar can punch through Zapdos and opposing Rotom-A with relative ease. As an added benefit, most people won't risk Will-O-Wisp with Heracross around, so Tyranitar can generally get in safely. A Rotom-A of your own will help tremendously with Gyarados and Skarmory, while Starmie will help with Flygon and Dragonite.</p> "

Unlike Choice Scarf Heracross, however, Choice Band Heracross functions as a wallbreaker that can hopefully open up holes with his massively powerful attacks so that other Pokemon can sweep. Unlike other Choice Band attackers, such as Tyranitar, Heracross actually enjoys being burned by Pokemon like Rotom-A. After a Guts boost, Heracross's Attack stat hits a massive 861 with Adamant or 784 with Jolly.</p> <p>Close Combat and Megahorn return to form the core of Heracross's attacking options. Stone Edge is mandatory for the Flying-type Pokemon that will inevitably switch into Heracross. Unlike the Choice Scarf set, Pursuit sits comfortably in the last slot, maiming Psychic-types as they flee from Megahorn or Rotom-A after it accidentally burns you. Sleep Talk returns with this set so that Heracross can make a decent switch-in to sleep-inducing moves and subsequently take advantage of the status with Guts-boosted attacks.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is recommended to outspeed Timid Heatran, Jolly Gyarados, and Adamant Lucario, but Adamant can be used for the substantial boost to Attack it provides. This set should always run 252 Speed EVs to at worst tie with Suicune and Kingdra. 252 Attack EVs are mandatory to hit as hard as possible, while carrying a Choice Band should hopefully go without saying.</p> <p>Luring status for Heracross to switch into is encouraged, as almost nothing can switch into a Guts-boosted attack safely. Rotom-A is the primary user of Will-O-Wisp, and so by using Pokemon that lure it in, such as Metagross or Jirachi, Heracross can absorb the Will-O-Wisp and proceed to Pursuit Rotom-A to death. Stealth Rock support is basically necessary as it helps Heracross wear down the typical Flying-type Pokemon that will inevitably switch into him. Tyranitar is also a very good teammate for Heracross, as he can beat both the Ghost- and Flying-type Pokemon that like to switch into Heracross's STAB attacks. Revenge killing tactics are popular for breaking Heracross, as he's not the fastest Pokemon around. For this reason, it's important to have checks to Pokemon like Choice Scarf Heatran and Infernape. Good examples of such Pokemon are Vaporeon and Starmie.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Using this set on your team is akin to making a pact with the devil. With a one turn setup that involves tripling Heracross's Attack stat from 349 to 1047 and two 120 Base Power attacks, even things that used to switch into Heracross with impunity can be brutally massacred. Not simply hoping that Guts will activate, and instead activating it yourself, means that this Heracross has considerably more raw power, thus exchanging survivability for the potential to crush his standard counters.</p> <p>Swords Dance, Close Combat, and Megahorn are all standard fare for Heracross. As this set is guaranteed a status affliction, though, Heracross can use a deadly new weapon: Facade. After a Swords Dance, it OHKOes Weezing, Gliscor, and even bulky Gyarados after Intimidate with Stealth Rock damage. Night Slash is an option for the last slot because it is necessary to beat Rotom-A; Facade is the superior option against basically everything else, though.</p> <p>Flame Orb activates Guts, which is necessary for this set. Toxic Orb can be used for a more hit-and-run approach to using this set, whereas Flame Orb is less damaging over many turns. As a sweeper, Heracross is just begging for 252 Attack and Speed EVs. A Jolly nature is best here for outspeeding Timid Heatran. If, for some reason, you don't feel like abusing a Herculean 1047 Attack stat, you can give Heracross a Life Orb. If by God's good graces Heracross gets burned with a Life Orb equipped, even Pokemon like defensive Rotom-A are OHKOed by a resisted Megahorn at the cost of 22.5% of Heracross's HP per turn.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is utterly necessary for guaranteeing OHKOs against max Defense Skarmory, Forretress, Hippowdon, Bronzong, and all bulky Water-type Pokemon. Dual screen support can ease Heracross's setup as well. Pokemon like Uxie, Azelf, and Jirachi are good candidates for the job as they can accomplish any of these things. Since Heracross is a slow beetle, having switch-ins for the omnipresent faster threats is important. Pokemon like Choice Scarf Heatran, Flygon, and Jirachi are all issues, as well as priority abusers like Scizor. A Heatran of your own makes a good partner for his ability to switch into Fire-type attacks with impunity, his 4x resistance to Scizor's Bullet Punch and Jirachi's Iron Head, and his resistance to Flygon's Outrage. Tyranitar makes another good partner for his ability to beat Rotom-A if you pass on Night Slash. Tyranitar can also take on Fire-type attacks with relative ease, although he should be wary of Steel-type attacks from Scizor and Jirachi.</p> "

  "Skarmory": {
    "overview": "<p>Skarmory returns as one of the best defensive Pokemon and Spikes user in the metagame. Skarmory’s fantastic Steel / Flying typing, base 140 Defense stat, and varied defensive movepool make it one of the best walls in the tier. Skarmory is an excellent answer to hyper offense teams lacking Magnezone, as it can heal off multiple boosted attacks and phaze out the opponent while setting up entry hazards. Skarmory can run physically and specially defensive sets, depending on team composition. Physically defensive sets are great answers to Fighting-types such as Machamp and Breloom and emphasize Skarmory’s ability to answer boosted sweepers, while specially defensive sets stave Skarmory off against mixed sweepers while also absorbing boosted Latias’s attacks well. Skarmory can run an offensive Spikes set focused on setting up hyper offensive teams with Stealth Rock and Spikes while preventing set up with Taunt.</p> <p>Skarmory’s main issues lie in its weakness to Magnezone and the way the metagame has adapted to it. Magnezone is the bane of Skarmory’s existence, as it traps and OHKOs it while Skarmory has no options to damage it. Skarmory can run Shed Shell to escape from Magnezone; however, running Shed Shell means Skarmory loses out on Leftovers recovery and cannot afford to take Knock Off from Clefable or Gliscor that are paired with Magnezone. Without Leftovers, Skarmory cannot recover easily from absorbing powerful physical attacks such as Metagross's Explosion while also struggling with Breloom, Machamp, and Jirachi. Physically defensive Skarmory also is weak to surprise special attacks from Pokemon it is supposed to wall, such as mixed Flygon's Fire Blast, Jirachi’s Electric-type coverage, and Swampert’s Hydro Pump, while specially defensive variants can be overwhelmed by strong physical moves such as +1 Tyranitar’s Stone Edge, +1 Dragonite’s Fire Punch, and Breloom’s Focus Punch. Offensive Spikes variants often have little to no bulk and suffer against Rapid Spinning later in the game. Most specially offensive leads can OHKO offensive Skarmory, while without recovery, Skarmory can be worn down easily.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Skarmory can run Protect alongside Roost to scout out opposing moves, gain additional Leftovers recovery, and stop a Copycat Lucario in its tracks. On the offensive Spikes set, Skarmory can also use an Endure + Salac Berry or Custap Berry to guarantee set up of an entry hazard or use Brave Bird before having hazards spun away by a faster threat such as Starmie. Skarmory can also use Toxic to additionally pressure Tyranitar, Gyarados, and Dragonite as an alternative to Counter.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Magnet Pull: Magnezone is oppressive to Skarmory, as it traps and OHKOs it with ease while it fears nothing Skarmory can do. Fully specially defensive Skarmory can survive Magnezone's Thunderbolt should it lack a boosting item to set up more hazards or phase it away. Skarmory can also use Shed Shell to escape Magnet Pull. Other more niche Magnet Pull Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Magneton can also trap Skarmory, but aren't as effective at preventing hazards as Magnezone is.</p> <p><strong>Rapid Spinners: Starmie and Forretress counter the primary way Skarmory does damage with Rapid Spin. Both easily survive Brave Bird and punish Skarmory: Starmie either hits it hard with its coverage or paralyzes, while Forretress sets up more entry hazards. Other niche Rapid Spinners such as Donphan and Trick + Choice Scarf Claydol can punish Skarmory in the same way.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Heatran and Infernape can easily OHKO Skarmory with STAB Fire-type moves. Infernape should be careful of switching in on Brave Bird, while both are grounded and can be worn down throughout the game with Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Rotom-A, Zapdos, and Raikou hit Skarmory hard with a super effective Thunderbolt. However, none of them can guarantee a OHKO without a boosting item on specially defensive Skarmory unless they use Thunder. Rotom-A is a prominent Skarmory counter on defensive teams as it is immune to entry hazards and has a good chance to OHKO physically defensive Skarmory after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Surprise special coverage: Even when invested, Skarmory's special defense isn't very good and is vulnerable to strong special moves from foes having SpA EVs investment or boosts, such as Jirachi's special Electric-type coverage, utility Tyranitar's Fire Blast, Swampert Hydro Pump, mixed Dragonite and Flygon's Fire Blast, and Calm Mind Clefable's Thunderbolt. These attacks will often leave physically defensive Skarmory very low on health, but specially defensive Skarmory can Roost off a lot of these attacks.</p> <p><strong>Trick: Like many walls, Skarmory is vulnerable to Trick. However, Skarmory is especially vulnerable to being hit by Trick + Iron Ball, which slows it down, removes its passive recovery, and makes it vulnerable to Ground-type attacks and Spikes. Beware of Metagross, Bronzong, and Uxie possibly grounding Skarmory with an Iron Ball. Skarmory notably becomes a much worse answer to Flygon, Metagross, Gliscor, Swampert, and other Earthquake users with an Iron Ball.</p> <p><strong>Very strong attackers: Skarmory can be overwhelmed by very powerful attackers, such as Choice Band Tyranitar, Choice Band Gyarados, Choice Specs Latias, Gengar, Breloom, Machamp, Lucario, and Suicune. Gyarados and Swampert are especially bad if they flinch with Waterfall, while Tyranitar can notably 2HKO physically defensive Skarmory with Stone Edge. Breloom and Machamp hit Skarmory super effectively when it uses Roost, while Lucario can OHKO after Stealth Rock with a +2 Close Combat. However, all of these should beware of Counter, which often OHKOs them after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Gliscor, Gengar, Azelf, and Gyarados can prevent Skarmory from performing its role with Taunt. Skarmory is forced to Struggle should it lack Drill Peck, Brave Bird, or Counter. Gyarados is especially dangerous, as with Intimidate, it can prevent Skarmory from phazing it out, take weak damage from Brave Bird or Drill Peck, and set up Dragon Dance until it OHKOs through Counter.</p> ",

        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Physically defensive Skarmory is focused on setting entry hazards, walling most physical threats, and phasing the opponent. Skarmory is one of the few viable Spikes setters in the metagame. With invesment, Skarmory's defensive prowess allows it to set up Spikes easily on most Pokemon without special moves. Roost keep Skarmory healthy and negates its Flying-typing for a turn. Beware of opponents taking advantage of Roost to hit Skarmory with a super-effective attack such as Swampert’s Earthquake, Breloom's Focus Punch, Machamp’s DynamicPunch, and Scizor’s Superpower, however.</p> <p>One of Skarmory main advantages over other Spikes setting walls such as Forretress is its ability to phase after setting entry hazards up. Whirlwind has two main uses: phaze out boosted sweepers such as Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Gyarados as well as spread entry hazard damage. Skarmory’s Whirlwind is one of the best ways for defensive teams to hurt the opponent, especially since most Skarmory answers such as Magnezone and Heatran are grounded. Whirlwind also assists against Substitute users, especially Breloom and Machamp if Skarmory lacks a Flying-type attack. Counter gives Skarmory a more offensive answer to boosted sweepers: as foes do not want to get phazed, physical attackers will often attack into Skarmory to weaken it for later in the game. Counter can OHKO Gyarados, Dragonite, and Tyranitar with Stealth Rock after Skarmory takes a boosted attack. For more active damaging options, Brave Bird is the move of choice to make it a better answer to Gyarados, Gliscor, Lucario, Infernape, Breloom, and Machamp. Provided it is facing a defensive team, Brave Bird also gives Skarmory an option to pressure Clefable, forcing her to heal more often as well as finishing weakened walls dragged in by Whirlwind. Should recoil be a concern, Drill Peck is a safe alternative that doesn't wear Skarmory down, useful against foes such as Taunt Gliscos. As some defensive teams don’t have many Stealth Rock users, Skarmory can set up both entry hazards due to the free turns it generates. This does make Skarmory susceptible to Taunt, however.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>These EVs allow Skarmory to OHKO Gyarados using +1 Waterfall after Stealth Rock, with the rest of the EVs helping it take stray special hits. Without Counter, physically defensive Skarmory generally should use close to max HP and max Defense EVs, as it needs all the physical defense it can get to check Dragon Dance sweepers such as Dragonite, Gyarados, and Tyranitar while also answering Breloom, Metagross, and Machamp. It is less vulnerable to Jirachi continuously flinching it with Iron Head as well. Skarmory can also use a few Special Defense EVs, as the base stat is quite low and can help against various mixed attackers; however, Skarmory generally needs significant investment before it can reliable take special attacks. Skarmory can run some extra speed, such as up to around 60 EVs to outspeed minimum speed Heatran. This allows it to Whirlwind out other Skarmory first and outspeed slower Breloom before it uses Spore.</p> <p>The choice between Leftovers and Shed Shell is team dependent. Leftovers is preferred, as Skarmory is forced to Roost much earlier without Leftovers and generally struggles to wall threats. For example, Metagross can KO Skarmory with Explosion much easier if Dragonite hits it hard with a +1 Fire Punch if it doesn’t heal with Leftovers. Skarmory should stick to Drill Peck instead of Brave Bird with Shed Shell to further minimize residual damage. Skarmory has to be much more careful against Clefable and Gliscor, as it still is vulnerable to Magnezone if it takes a Knock Off. Shed Shell is also useless if the opponent doesn’t have Magnezone. However, Shed Shell can invalidate Magnezone teams that rely on it to remove Skarmory. Magnezone teams often are very weak Skarmory otherwise, allowing it to excel in its role of setting up hazards and walling.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Skarmory should come in liberally throughout the game to lay hazards and wall threats. Skarmory has a huge list of Pokemon it can use as set up fodder. If Skarmory lacks Shed Shell, it has to worry about potential Magnezone switches. This vulnerability can be answered by double switching to one’s own Magnezone or using Whirlwind immediately. Often, the second layer of Spikes isn’t as valuable as the first and third, so prioritize setting up Stealth Rock then one layer of Spike should Skarmory have both. Some Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Swampert can have strong special coverage, so be careful about using these Pokemon as set up fodder. Being aggressive with Whirlwind is fantastic at wearing down the opposing team even with not many entry hazards set.</p> <p>Despite Skarmory's incredible bulk, it can be overwhelmed by the threats it answers. However, Counter can force difficult mindgames for foes trying to break through Skarmory. Mastering the timing of Roost is critical; Skarmory should be keeping its health high with Roost to avoid being overwhelmed by Explosion and set up sweepers. However, opponents can take advantage Roost, as now Skarmory with be vulnerable to super-effective Ground- and Fighting-type moves. Skarmory can also be overwhelmed by strong offensive Water-types such as Choice Band Swampert and boosted Gyarados, especially if Waterfall flinches, so don’t rely on it solely for this purpose. Skarmory also can be crippled by Trick, so against threats it easily walls like Metagross and Bronzong, beware of Trick + Iron Ball or Choice Band. Keeping Skarmory unstatused is often critical to beating Skarmory dittos, so avoid taking Jirachi’s Body Slam, Starmie’s Thunder Wave, and Gengar’s Will-o-Wisp for example in this case.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Physically defensive Skarmory has many possible teammates as a staple of DPP OU. Both offensive and defensive teams greatly appreciate the extra chip damage Spikes provides and Skarmory’s defensive prowess. Tyranitar is one of the best partners, as its Choice Scarf set can Pursuit trap Starmie trying to Rapid Spin away Stealth Rock and Spikes, utility Tyranitar can set up Stealth Rock and handle Electric- and Fire-type coverage better while also covering Starmie, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar’s counters are mostly grounded, allowing it to break through opposing teams. Sand is also helpful for making residual damage stick. Skarmory also appreciates a Ghost-type such as Gengar and Rotom-A to block Rapid Spin. Gengar is excellent on more offensive teams, as it forces many switches with its power and Will-o-Wisp, while Spikes helps put defensive Tyranitar in range of Focus Blast. All Rotom-A sets assist Skarmory: Choice Scarf sets are great revenge killers, Substitute sets are oppressive with Spikes down, and defensive RestTalk sets spread burns and are best at blocking Rapid Spin throughout the game. Skarmory is a staple of the Magnezone bait style, which involves allowing Magnezone to trap Skarmory early in the game so that one’s own Choice Scarf Magnezone counter traps Magnezone with Hidden Power Ground. This can open up teams to another Steel-type such as defensive Jirachi or Empoleon. Skarmory can even evade being trapped with Shed Shell.</p> <p>Beyond these, Skarmory generally appreciates teammates that can switch into its special weaknesses. On offense teams, Pokemon like Choice Specs Latias, mixed Flygon, and Swampert provide Fire and Electric resistances while taking advantage of the entry hazards laid down. Flygon especially enjoys Spikes, as it heavily limits reliable switch ins except Clefable. Swampert provides Stealth Rock, and gives back up to physical sweepers trying to break through Skarmory such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Pokemon that take advantage of switches such as Heatran and Breloom as well as mixed threats such as Jirachi, Infernape, and Swampert love having entry hazards wear down the opponent.</p> <p>For defensive teams, Skarmory is typically the primary physically defensive wall while also providing Spikes. As such, it appreciates bulkier teammates to switch into its weaknesses as well as offensive Water-types that can break it. Common choices include defensive Latias, Clefable, Milotic, Zapdos, and Tyranitar. Defensive Jirachi becomes more oppressive to face with hazards set while Gliscor, Nidoqueen, and Hippowdon cover Electric-types and provide their own utility. Gliscor, Zapdos, Latias, Celebi, and Nidoqueen check Breloom should Skarmory take Spore. Blissey and Clefable are strong special walls that appreciate Skarmory shoring them up against physical threats. Calm Mind Clefable especially loves Spikes to force damage on the bulky Steel-types such as Heatran and Jirachi as well as Tyranitar that wall it. Heatran and Skarmory are Steel-types that don’t share weaknesses, shoring the team against Dragon-types. As the best defensive Spikes user in the metagame, Skarmory can fit with almost all defensive teammates.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Specially defensive Skarmory is an amazing mixed wall; it notably is one of the only specially bulky Steel-types with access to recovery alongside Jirachi and Scizor. This allows it to take strong special attacks such as Latias's Draco Meteor, Gengar's Focus Blast, and even Life Orb Flygon's and Dragonite's attacks more easily. As this Skarmory isn't nearly as vulnerable to surprise special moves such as Tyranitar's Fire Blast, Jirachi's Electric-type moves, and Swampert's Hydro Pump, it can set up Spikes and possibly Stealth Rock with impunity against much of the metagame.</p> <p>Specially defensive Skarmory's Whirlwind typically only phases out boosted physical sweepers in an emergency, as it doesn't have the physical bulk to stave them off repeatedly. Additionally, Skarmory struggles to repeatedly phase out strong physical Substitute users such as Machamp and Breloom, but is effective against weaker ones such as Jirachi. However, due to its mixed bulk, Whirlwind becomes a better offensive tool, as Skarmory can use it against more of the metagame due to the grounded nature of its answers. For its last moveslot, Skarmory can more offensively check physical sweepers with Counter, but can also set both entry hazards quickly with Stealth Rock or use the general utility of Brave Bird. Skarmory doesn't have the raw bulk to use the weaker Drill Peck. Brave Bird especially allows Skarmory to fend off Gengar without Will-o-Wisp much better with its special bulk. Skarmory can also control more defensive teams from healing and setting up entry hazards with Taunt. With its recovery and immunity to sand, Skarmory often prevents slower walls such as Clefable, other Skarmory, and Hippowdon from doing anything at all.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Specially defensive Skarmory generally needs close to max special bulk invested to stave off special moves effectively, as Latias and Gengar easily 3HKO Skarmory even with full investment. This investment allows Skarmory to do much better against Water-types such as special Swampert, Suicune, Kingdra, Empoleon, and Milotic. Skarmory can run some extra speed, such as up to around 60 EVs to outspeed minimum speed Heatran. This investment especially helps out Taunt sets. Skarmory also can run an Impish nature with a fully specially defensive spread such as 252 HP / 16 Def / 240 SpD to balance its two spreads.</p> <p>Specially defensive Skarmory generally shouldn't be running Shed Shell. There are a few reasons for this: the first reason is that Careful Skarmory with maximum Special Defense EVs survives Timid Magnezone's Thunderbolt with certainty, while Modest has a 50% chance to OHKO. The second is due to Skarmory's lack of physical defense, it can be overwhelmed more easily by physical attacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Specially defensive Skarmory should come in early in the game or lead to set up entry hazards, as with mixed bulk, little can stop it from getting up at least a layer. As Skarmory lacks huge physical bulk, beware of trying to counter set up sweepers and strong physical threats, as they will break through. For this reason, Skarmory should be keeping its health high with Roost to avoid being overwhelmed more so than physically bulky sets. This also keeps it healthy against special coverage, as Tyranitar's Fire Blast and Jirachi's Electric-type coverage will generally still 2HKO Skarmory. Skarmory is more vulnerable to physical ways to break through it, such as boosted Gyarados and Swampert flinching and 2HKOing with Waterfall, Explosion + residual damage, and Trick + Iron Ball users such as Metagross now 2HKOing it with Earthquake, so Skarmory should be used in conjunction with other answers to these Pokemon. However, with Counter, Skarmory can often surprise them, as boosted attacks will almost always OHKO back. Skarmory should generally avoid status, especially burn, as it notably can't handle Gengar and Jirachi with a burn.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Specially defensive Skarmory has more nuance with its partners than the physically defensive set. This Skarmory isn't used as much on defensive teams, as it can't shoulder the burden of repeated physical hits as well as a primary physical wall and struggles to check Breloom and Machamp effectively. On the other hand, this Skarmory is effective at shoring up a team against many threats as a mixed wall on offensive teams—whereas physically defensive Skarmory needs another bulky Steel-type or Tyranitar to take powerful Draco Meteor from Latias, Kingdra, Dragonite, and Flygon, this Skarmory can shore up the team against special Dragon-type moves and Gengar in one slot while still functioning against physical attackers while at full health. As such, its viable partners go into three categories: general support for Spikes, offensive Pokemon wanting Spikes and possibly Stealth Rock to wear down their counters, and teams with little backbone and need a versatile wall in one slot.</p> <p>As with the physically defensive set, Skarmory especially loves Tyranitar and Ghost-types, as these not only help prevent Rapid Spin, but also uniquely take advantage of Skarmory's defensive traits. Tyranitar generally takes Fire- and Electric-type coverage well, meaning most of its sets are effective: Choice Scarf sets again can trap Starmie and other Psychic types such as Latias, Starmie, and the Ghost-types such as Gengar and Rotom-A, utility sets set up Stealth Rock and appreciate Spikes, and Dragon Dance sets get a free Dragon Dance on many Skarmory checks and sweeps with Spikes set. Specially defensive Skarmory is especially good for this, as it can survive strong Draco Meteors and generally forces offensive Starmie to Thunderbolt. Ghost-types are especially useful, as Gengar can help answer Breloom for Skarmory while be very threatening with Spikes set. Rotom-A can shore up the team physically defensively or provide a back up check to Dragon Dance users with its Choice Scarf set.</p> <p>Good offensive teammates for Skarmory include Pokemon that can switch into its weaknesses, such as Choice Specs and other offensive Latias, mixed Flygon, Heatran, Choice Scarf Lucario, Swampert, and even Quagsire. Spikes help Latias, Heatran, and Flygon break down their grounded checks, while Swampert and Heatran can set up Stealth Rock. Heatran also helps with strong Electric-type coverage, can switch into Will-o-Wisp, and provides a strong Jirachi counter. Choice Scarf Lucario is an especially effective revenge killer; it can outspeed and OHKO Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragonite, and Tyranitar while also using Copycat to reverse phaze defensive teams should it get phazed out. Swampert and Quagsire assist specially defensive Skarmory against physical threats it doesn't wall as well, such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Trick + Iron Ball Metagross. Quagsire is especially a good partner, as is also immune to the strong offensive Water-types Skarmory struggles with and beats every common Dragon Dance user with Encore and Counter.</p> <p>Teams with less of a defensive backbone, such as more offensive Magnezone bait teams and some defensive teams appreciate specially defensive Skarmory. These styles typically need many pieces to be effective: for example, on Magnezone bait teams, they need Magnezone, another Steel-type, a way to block Rapid Spin such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar and/or a Ghost-type, and a bulky sweeper such as Curse + Rest Swampert, Swords Dance + Roost Gliscor, or Calm Mind + Roar Latias. Some defensive teams, such as those built around offensive Jirachi, appreciate its ability to sponge Latias's Choice Specs Draco Meteor while also spreading entry hazards needed for Jirachi to thrive. These teams typically are built around Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Clefable, and Latias alongside a Ground-type such as physically defensive Hippowdon, specially defensive Gliscor, Quagsire, or Donphan to back up Skarmory defensively. Other strong Pokemon on these styles include defensive RestTalk Rotom and defensive Empoleon.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Offensive Spiker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Skarmory can fully lean into supporting offensive teams by controlling the hazard game: set up entry hazards while preventing the opponent's with Taunt. Skarmory's defensive typing and bulk afford it to get at least one entry hazard set up if not more. Taunt differentiates this from the standard wall, as Skarmory can prevent Stealth Rock and other entry hazards from slower leads such as Metagross, Bronzong, Empoleon, opposing Skarmory, and Swampert. Taunt can be especially helpful if Skarmory's team is weak to entry hazards, such as hyper offenses featuring Gyarados and Dragonite.</p> <p>The final move helps to make Skarmory less vulnerable to Taunt as well as opponents trying to KO it. Brave Bird is the standard, as it hits as hard as possible. Brave Bird also outspeeds and damages Machamp, while always OHKOing Breloom and at least speed tying it. Brave Bird also hits non resists hard in general. Drill Peck is another option, especially should one not want to break Focus Sash early or avoid recoil. Drill Peck still 2HKOs Machamp and OHKOs Breloom. Both Flying-type moves break opposing Focus Sash and make Skarmory less passive.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Skarmory generally needs to run a lot of speed to get the most out of Taunt. A 252 HP / 252 Spe EV spread with a Jolly nature emphasizes this, allowing Skarmory to Taunt to prevent Stealth Rock while also getting up its own hazards. It also allows it to outspeed up to Adamant Dragon Dance Gyarados, meaning it can Taunt Gyarados to prevent set up. Beware of Choice Band Gyarados just 2HKOing you, however. It also makes it faster than all non Choice Scarf Magnezone and Tyranitar, while also outspeeding slow base 100s like Jirachi. Max HP affords Skarmory some survivability against common leads, such as Empoleon's Hydro Pump and Machamp's DynamicPunch. Skarmory can also use 252 attack EVs to power up Brave Bird and Drill Peck, but doesn't gain any prominent OHKOs by doing so. Skarmory can also run slightly more bulk with a spread of 248 HP / 76 SpD / 184 Spe, designed to live Empoleon's Hydro Pump + Aqua Jet while still outspeeding Tyranitar.</p> <p>The choice between Lum Berry and Focus Sash is determined by what leads Skarmory wants to set up hazards against. Lum Berry saves Skarmory from Roserade, defensive Jirachi, Thunder Wave Uxie, Machamp, and other status leads while getting up its own hazards. However, it affords no protection from the powerful attacks in the lead position such as Heatran's Overheat, Zapdos's Thunderbolt, and Choice Specs Starmie's Hydro Pump. Lum Berry is generally preferred, as Focus Sash is often negated upon switch out from opposing entry hazards and saving Skarmory from status for a turn can mean getting up the extra Spike or Stealth Rock the team needs. Skarmory can also use a resistance berry such as Wacan Berry to set up two hazards on Magnezone or Occa Berry to set up hazards on Life Orb Flygon. These items are especially helpful if Skarmory isn't leading.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Skarmory generally uses Taunt on slower entry hazard leads such as Nidoqueen and Hippowdon while setting up as many hazards as it can. As the standard wall can also lead to get entry hazards early, the two sets are indistinguishable until Skarmory reveals Taunt or outspeeds the opponent. This set also doesn't have to lead, which makes it more difficult to tell what it is. Whether or not to Taunt depends on how weak Skarmory's team is to Stealth Rock, how threatening the opposing lead is, and the likelihood to get hazards up later. If Skarmory's team has multiple Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, such as Gyarados, Zapdos, and Dragonite, it should be aggressive to Taunt potential Stealth Rock setters such as Metagross, Bronzong, Empoleon, and Swampert—even if they switch out due to being walled, Skarmory has prevented Stealth Rock from going up. If the team isn't as weak to Stealth Rock, Skarmory should forgo Taunt and just set up entry hazards without regard to its own health, as without any recovery or phazing moves, Skarmory isn't going to be walling much for long. Skarmory will only rarely use Brave Bird or Drill Peck: generally only if the opponent is weak to it, it gets hit by a Taunt, or wants to attack before fainting. Skarmory has little midgame utility as it can't phaze, so once it has set up entry hazards, freely sacrificing it or letting it faint so a sweeper can switch in freely is advised.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Skarmory generally is only featured on hyper offense teams that wants Spikes and Skarmory's defensive prowess over the speed and Explosion something like Azelf provides. Skarmory hyper offenses also aren't as all out as Azelf hyper offenses, due to how much momentum is lost should the hazards get spun away. Common Skarmory partners such as Tyranitar and Rotom-A are good partners, however, they generally run more offensive sets such as Dragon Dance and Choice Scarf, respectively, to match the pace of the team. Tyranitar can also run a Substitute + Focus Punch set to take advantage of forced switches and open up the more defensive teams this set struggles with. Due to Taunt, Skarmory can support offensive Gyarados and Dragonite sets effectively by preventing Stealth Rock while matching the pace of the team. Both enjoy entry hazards to break down walls more easily. Another good partner is mixed Flygon, as it switches in on Skarmory's weaknesses and enjoys entry hazards to break down walls for teammates. Other main stays of hyper offense such as Swords Dance Lucario, Swords Dance Empoleon, Agility Metagross, and Swords Dance Scizor are good teammates. These Pokemon are also all Steel-types, and since Skarmory will often bait in Magnezone, the opponent might let Magnezone faint to deal with a sweeper such as Tyranitar. This prevents Magnezone from revenging these Pokemon. Of these, Lucario is especially threatening, as because this Skarmory generally forces a Ghost-type to keep up hazards, should Tyranitar Pursuit Rotom-A, Lucario gets free set up to ravage the opposing team. Other offensive Pokemon such as Gengar, Choice Specs Latias, Choice Scarf Lucario, and Swampert can fit well alongside this Skarmory, but generally prefer a bulkier Skarmory with recovery.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Kingdra had often been bashed in past generations due to its poor movepool; however, DPP has given it an array of blessings, including incredible new options such as Outrage. While Kingdra's movepool still isn't anything to write home about, it can do a lot with what it has. All in all, Kingdra has changed from quite the mundane sweeper to a Pokemon that many teams will have significant problems with.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Although only a minor option, Yawn can replace Substitute on the first set, as Yawning your opponent's first switch-in can result in forcing them to go to a Pokemon less equipped to deal with Kingdra, lest they allow their best Kingdra counter to be put to sleep. If they decide to save their Pokemon from sleep, Yawn has the added benefit of racking up residual damage on both opposing Pokemon. In addition, since their second switch-in to Kingdra will more than likely be unable to handle Kingdra to the same extent as their first, you might be able to pull off an extra Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Kingdra's movepool is fairly shallow and it doesn't have much in the way of other options. Flail is decent if you can manage it, but good luck pulling it off with Tyranitar, users of priority moves, and Stealth Rock everywhere. Kingdra can run a Choice Band set, but the lack of a decent physical movepool hinders its viability.</p> <p>Specific EVs are given for each set. Adamant, 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe is best for the Substitute + Dragon Dance set. The Mixed Rain Dance set could use Naughty, 252 Atk / 240 SpA / 16 Spe to outspeed Choice Scarf Heatran in the rain, but Naughty, 192 Atk / 240 SpA / 76 Spe is a good alternative to outspeed +1 neutral-natured base 100s at the slight cost of Attack. Adamant, 252 Atk / 24 SpA / 232 Spe is the best option for the mixed Dragon Dance set. The Special Rain Dance set should use either Modest 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe or Modest, 92 HP / 252 SpA / 164 Spe for a bit more bulk. Timid, 32 HP / 252 SpA / 224 Spe can even be used for surprise factor outside of rain, as well as to outspeed almost all opposing Kingdra and +2 Jolly Gyarados in the rain. The Double Dance set is best with Adamant, 180 HP / 252 Atk / 76 Spe, but can use Adamant, 92 HP / 252 Atk / 164 Spe to outspeed +1 positive-natured base 100s in the rain.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Empoleon easily walls most mixed and special Kingdra sets, fearing only the occasional Hidden Power Electric, but when it comes to the Dragon Dance set, Empoleon has to focus its EVs into Defense or it will be 2HKOed by boosted Outrages. Celebi and Tangrowth also do decently at stopping Dragon Dance sets, but still have to be wary of Life Orb variants as Outrage can 2HKO both of them. Although hits from Draco Meteor will still take their toll, Milotic, Ludicolo, Suicune, and Vaporeon are also effective at stopping the mixed and special sets as well, due to their Water-type resistance and good Special Defense. Blissey and Snorlax will beat the specially based Rain Dance set. Tyranitar and Abomasnow also can annoy Rain Dance sets by taking away their rain and hitting back hard.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Excellent dual STABs in Waterfall and Outrage coupled with Dragon Dance make Kingdra a top threat capable of sweeping unprepared teams. Kingdra's excellent defensive typing, along with its deceptively bulky stats, allow it to take strong special hits and Dragon Dance with a comfortable amount of HP remaining. Suicune and Starmie, two excellent checks to other Dragon-types, usually hope to bait Outrage, only to find themselves unable to stop Kingdra from setting up two or three Dragon Dances, then Rest and restore itself to full health thanks to Chesto Berry. Chesto Berry will not cure anything but sleep, so Pokemon relying on Will-O-Wisp or Toxic might think that they have beaten or crippled Kingdra, only to find they have given it an opportunity to gain more boosts before healing off status with Rest. With its boosted Waterfall, Kingdra is able to beat many Pokemon without locking itself into Outrage, and becomes very difficult to stop if the opponent no longer has a defensive wall such as Skarmory or Forretress.</p> <p>The HP and Special Defense EVs are chosen so that Kingdra will survive at least two attacks from Life Orb Starmie and +1 Suicune. This special bulk allows Kingdra to Dragon Dance without fear of a 2HKO. A minimum of 164 Speed EVs should be used to outpace Choice Scarf Flygon after two Dragon Dance boosts. While the idea of this set is to Dragon Dance in spite of status moves and bulky Water-types thanks to Chesto Berry, Lum Berry is an acceptable substitute. With Lum Berry, Kingdra can cure itself of confusion if it is forced to Outrage before it is able to Rest. Lum Berry makes the set vulnerable to status users that Kingdra would otherwise have little difficulty setting up against, though.</p> <p>Because the point of this set is to set up on opposing bulky Water-types, strong Fire-type attackers such as Heatran and Infernape make excellent partners to this set. In addition, sweepers such as Tyranitar are good teammates to clean up the remnants of the opposing team after Kingdra has eliminated the opposing bulky Water-types. Because Kingdra's only weakness is to Dragon-type attacks, Steel-types are able to switch in and set up on the opponent's attempts to revenge kill Kingdra; Heatran, Jirachi, Scizor, and Metagross are ideal for this role. Rather than Kingdra's typical counters, this Kingdra is hindered by very defensive Pokemon. Kingdra almost always finds itself unable to beat Pokemon such as Skarmory, Swampert, and Metagross. Again, Heatran makes an ideal partner for beating down these defensive threats; Heatran can even run Hidden Power Grass to lure and eliminate Swampert.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>With two physical STAB options to go with Dragon Dance, Kingdra is a fearsome foe with nearly perfect type coverage provided by Waterfall and Outrage; the combination is resisted only by Empoleon and Shedinja. Kingdra can use its unique typing to set up on opposing Pokemon that are unable to do significant damage to it, such as Starmie, Heatran, and Vaporeon. Substitute protects Kingdra from status moves that could otherwise ruin its sweep, and can help it set up on Pokemon such as Toxic Vaporeon. When using a Lum Berry, it is best to Dragon Dance the first time the foe uses a status move on Kingdra, and then use Substitute the next time to get another Dragon Dance as they hopelessly try to status Kingdra once more.</p> <p>This Kingdra has trouble with bulky physical walls with a phazing move, such as Skarmory, Suicune, and Swampert. Magnezone can trap Skarmory who lack Shed Shell, and its powerful STAB Thunderbolt will scare off Suicune. If you pack Hidden Power Grass, it can even beat Swampert. Rotom-A also works well at warding off said Pokemon, although it cannot trap Skarmory. Celebi easily defeats Suicune with Leaf Storm or Perish Song, and it will also appreciate Kingdra's resistance to Fire-type attacks.</p> <p>Maximum Speed EV investment is used to guarantee that Kingdra outspeeds neutral xnatured base 80 Speed Pokemon and Gyarados. 252 Attack EVs are used to maximize Kingdra's power. More bulk can be used to make Kingdra's Substitutes bulkier, but this is generally not worth the loss in power or Speed. While both abilities are viable, Swift Swim is arguably the better option as it enables Kingdra to take advantage of opposing Rain Dance teams. Most Pokemon on Rain Dance teams are slower than Kingdra, so Outrage can rip through these teams once Steel-types are removed.</p> <p>Celebi can do a decent job against Kingdra because of its bulk, but Substitute will block Thunder Wave, so it must be careful it doesn't give Kingdra too many free Dragon Dances. Some good options for dealing with Celebi are Scizor and Tyranitar. Specially defensive versions are the best ways to defeat Celebi, as this almost always ensures Scizor will survive Hidden Power Fire, and lets Tyranitar more easily sponge Grass Knot. They both have super effective moves at their disposal to take out Celebi, and even switching out is not an option for Celebi, as it might take lethal damage from Pursuit.</p> <p>Faster Choice Scarf users such as Flygon and Naive Heatran can cause Kingdra problems, as they are able to revenge kill it if it only has one Dragon Dance and isn't behind a Substitute. Scizor and Tyranitar can trap Starmie, using Pursuit to take it out. Having a Steel-type on your team can help in taking an Outrage from Flygon or a Dragon Pulse from Heatran. Heatran is probably your best bet for countering opposing Heatran because it only fears Earth Power, while your Heatran can revenge kill it with an Earth Power of its own. Heatran can also revenge kill Flygon locked into Outrage with Dragon Pulse. You must also be wary of Steel-types switching into Outrage to revenge kill Kingdra; it is therefore useful to have Magnezone on your team. Choice Scarf Magnezone is ideal, as it can trap and kill most Steel-types thanks to Magnet Pull. Toxic Spikes support from Roserade can be useful as well, as the poison grants Kingdra an easier time against bulkier Pokemon such as Celebi, Suicune, Swampert, and Vaporeon. Roserade can also absorb your opponent's Toxic Spikes, because Kingdra's sweeping time will be cut short if it is statused.</p> "

        "name": "Mixed Rain Dance",
        "description": "<p>This set is arguably Kingdra's most destructive set, capable of smashing through even the game's most defensive Pokemon. It can work very well outside of Rain Dance teams, but is generally best used with rain support from its teammates. Hydro Pump is the real selling point of the set, as it significantly out-damages Waterfall and demolishes the physically based OU metagame. Surf can be used, but it doesn't pack the power that Hydro Pump does. Draco Meteor rounds out the set by allowing Kingdra to deliver a powerful hit to Grass-types and opposing Water-type Pokemon that resist its Water-type STAB. On Rain Dance teams, though, you will have other Pokemon to set up Rain Dance, so you might not need it on Kingdra.</p> <p>The EVs generate enough Speed to outrun Jolly Choice Scarf Jirachi and Flygon in the rain. The natures listed do not drop Kingdra's Attack or Special Attack, but which defense stat to drop is up to you. Life Orb is the obvious item, because Kingdra greatly appreciates the power boost. As alternatives to Rain Dance, Signal Beam is a great alternative to hit Celebi hard, KOing after it switches into Hydro Pump or Waterfall, while Hidden Power Electric enables Kingdra to 2HKO offensive Empoleon, as well as OHKO Gyarados every time with Stealth Rock support.</p> <p>Stealth Rock support is incredibly useful to this set as it provides Kingdra with a much better chance of attaining notable OHKOs. Azelf, Bronzong, Jirachi, and Swampert are the best options for Rain Dance teams as they can all provide both Rain Dance and Stealth Rock. The same Pokemon can also do well outside of Rain Dance teams, but Swampert is not recommended in this case due to similar typing. Toxic Spikes wreck this set, so having a Rapid Spin user such as Starmie can be useful to get rid of them. Qwilfish and Roserade can absorb Toxic Spikes, and Roserade can set up its own to help against the bulky Water-types and Celebi; both can also set up Rain Dance. Qwilfish can make a deadly partner as its Swords Dance-boosted Waterfalls rip through much of OU, and a well-timed Explosion on one of Kingdra's counters could prove useful.</p> <p>Celebi, Empoleon, Gyarados, Tentacruel, and most bulky Water-types can make good counters, although Hydro Pump + Draco Meteor can 2HKO many of them. Celebi must watch out for Signal Beam as well; after a Hydro Pump or Waterfall, it will KO. Fast Choice Scarf users such as Flygon are good revenge killers. Scizor and Skarmory can make good partners, as they are are the best options to deal with Flygon. Other Steel-types can also take out Flygon locked into Outrage, and ones with Rain Dance will be especially helpful. Tyranitar and Abomasnow also do well against Kingdra by taking away its precious rain, and although Tyranitar is weak to Water-type moves, it won't be OHKOed and can OHKO in return with a Choice Band Stone Edge. Abomasnow resists Water-type moves and can survive Draco Meteor thanks to its solid Special Defense. Blizzard will also badly hurt Kingdra; alternatively, Abomasnow can SubSeed stall it. Scizor therefore makes a great partner again to deal with them thanks to its STAB- and Technician-boosted Bullet Punch.</p> "

        "name": "Mixed Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>This set takes a more offensive approach than the former set. Kingdra retains its two physical STAB options, Waterfall and Outrage, but also carries a special attack to hit physical walls harder. The big difference is that with Life Orb, Kingdra can utilize Hydro Pump to 2HKO Skarmory or Ice Beam to take out opposing Dragon-type Pokemon without needlessly locking itself into Outrage.</p> <p>The given Speed EVs give Kingdra a stat of 264, enough to outrun base 130 Speed Pokemon after a Dragon Dance. After this, Attack is maximized and the remaining EVs put into Special Attack. Swift Swim is arguably the preferred ability since you can take advantage of opposing Rain Dance teams. This Kingdra can actually be a very good sweeper in a Rain Dance team; with doubled Speed and boosted Water-type attacks, it will be an absolute terror. Hydro Pump would be the best option in that case.</p> <p>Electric-types such as Jolteon, Rotom-A, and Magnezone work well alongside Kingdra, as they are able to force out enemy bulky Water-types. Jolteon and Rotom-A make fairly good counters to Celebi, due to Grass Knot having a pathetic Base Power against the pair. If Jolteon can switch in safely, Shadow Ball will badly hurt Celebi. Magnezone can trap Steel-types so Kingdra doesn't have to worry as much about locking itself into Outrage. These Electric-types also come in handy when using Ice Beam over Hydro Pump, as Skarmory once again becomes an issue.</p> <p>Similar to the Substitute + Dragon Dance set, fast Choice Scarf users are an annoyance unless you pack Rain Dance support. Scizor and Tyranitar can trap and kill Choice Scarf Gengar and Starmie with Pursuit, and Steel-types can switch into Choice Scarf Flygon's Outrage and take it out with an appropriate move. Toxic Spikes can drastically hinder Kingdra; therefore, a Rapid Spin user or Poison-type to remove them is a good option. Roserade is a great choice as it can also incapacitate a Pokemon with Sleep Powder, as well as set up its own Toxic Spikes to give Kingdra an easier time against bulky Water-types and Celebi. Starmie too can Rapid Spin; Life Orb Starmie also lures in Celebi, Suicune, and Rotom-A, and can severely weaken each of them with an appropriate move.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This is a purely special rain sweeper. It can't hurt Blissey much, but this set has some advantages over the mixed version. Kingdra doesn't need Attack EVs, so it can maximize Speed, making revenge killing it a much harder task. Hydro Pump can be used for some extra power, specifically to OHKO Swampert and Metagross, but Surf's reliability makes it the better choice overall. Signal Beam may seem a bit specific, but scores some nice KOs, namely against Celebi and Abomasnow after Stealth Rock. Hidden Power Electric is an alternative option if you don't particularly fear the aforementioned Grass-type Pokemon; it 2HKOes offensive Empoleon, and does slightly more damage to other Water-types in comparison to STAB Dragon Pulse.</p> <p>Maximum Speed is used because winning the Speed tie with opposing Kingdra can be game-changing. Kingdra also outspeeds all common Choice Scarf users with support from the rain. Maximum Special Attack is obvious for hitting as hard as possible. If you prefer, an alternative bulkier EV spread of 92 HP / 252 SpA / 164 Spe can be used instead to outspeed Jolly Tyranitar outside of rain, and positive natured Choice Scarf base 100s in rain. Life Orb is used for the power boost, which makes Surf a very deadly attack. One could use Damp Rock, but this Kingdra should generally be sweeping, not supporting.</p> <p>As with the mixed Rain Dance set, Stealth Rock support is recommended. Azelf, Bronzong, Jirachi, and Swampert are the best options for this Kingdra on Rain Dance teams. Toxic Spikes are problematic for this set, so a Rapid Spin user such as Starmie helps. Qwilfish and Roserade can absorb Toxic Spikes, and Roserade can set up its own to help take down bulky Water-types and Celebi. Qwilfish also makes a deadly Rain Dance sweeper, so it makes a nice partner.</p> <p>This set is a lot harder to revenge kill, but there are still many Pokemon that cause it problems. Bulky Water-types not named Swampert counter this set well, as even Hidden Power Electric won't 2HKO most of them. Thanks to its powerful STAB Grass-type attacks, Ludicolo makes an amazing partner to this Kingdra on Rain Dance teams. Jolteon, Rotom-W, and Zapdos can also do well against the aforementioned Pokemon. This set also has trouble against special walls such as Blissey and Snorlax; Scizor therefore makes a nice partner, as Superpower takes care of both. It can also do well against Tyranitar and Abomasnow, whose abilities remove the rain.</p> "

        "name": "Double Dance",
        "description": "<p>The strategy on this set is to use Rain Dance first. As Waterfall is Kingdra's main attack, this is the equivalent of the boost from Dragon Dance, but it immediately doubles Kingdra's Speed to outpace many Choice Scarf revenge killers. Rain Dance also clears other weather effects, thereby restoring Kingdra's Leftovers recovery, and offers the rest of your team temporary protection from Fire-type attacks. Kingdra can then attack or continue to set up with Dragon Dance. After a Dragon Dance in the rain, Kingdra essentially gains three times as much Speed and a 2.25x boosted Waterfall, able to crush offensive teams. Even Choice Scarf Flygon will fail to outspeed with rain falling from the sky if Kingdra has obtained a Dragon Dance. Unlike the Dragon Dance set, Kingdra can also afford to invest in his HP, thus improving Kingdra's survivability and increasing the chance of it getting the opportunity to set up Dragon Dance.</p> <p>224 Speed beats bulky Gyarados and Adamant Tyranitar outright. It also allows Kingdra to outrun base 100s after Dragon Dance, as well as neutral Choice Scarf base 100s after Rain Dance. The remaining EVs allow Kingdra to hit 336 HP, a Leftovers number. Four Attack EVs can be moved to HP to allow Kingdra an extra turn of survival when the only damage is residual. When using Damp Rock, this Leftovers threshold isn't important so you can opt for more Speed to outrun more threats in the rain.</p> <p>This set has the same counters as the first set, but is slightly harder to revenge kill thanks to Rain Dance doubling its Speed. Empoleon, Skarmory and Suicune are all good counters, and can phaze it out before Kingdra gets a chance to Dragon Dance. If using this Kingdra on a Rain Dance team, Ludicolo can be a great partner to deal with most of these threats, thanks to STAB Grass-type attacks and a powerful Surf with which to hit Skarmory. Ludicolo will also outspeed and 2HKO offensive +2 Speed Empoleon with either Energy Ball or Grass Knot. Outside of Rain Dance, powerful Electric-types such as Jolteon and Rotom-A can scare the aforementioned Pokemon off. Jolteon needs Hidden Power Grass for Swampert, though, and is very frail, so it can't switch in directly. Rotom-A, however, can do very well. Rotom-C stands out as an exceptional choice, as Swampert is OHKOed by Leaf Storm. Celebi can make a nice partner for dealing with bulky Water-types thanks to STAB Grass-type attacks and solid defenses.</p> <p>Scizor can do well on Rain Dance teams, as it can deal with many problematic Pokemon, including Abomasnow and Tyranitar. Roserade and Starmie can make nice partners for getting rid of Toxic Spikes. Bulky Steel-type Pokemon such as Bronzong, Jirachi, and Magnezone all make good partners. They can set up Rain Dance should you use Kingdra on a Rain Dance team, take the Dragon-type moves aimed at Kingdra, and also set up Stealth Rock in Bronzong and Jirachi's case.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Kingdra's Dragon-and Water-type STAB core form a nearly perfect combination, so there are no reasons to use any other attacks for this set. The idea is to come in on predicted non-damaging support moves, or Fire- and Water-type attacks, and unleash pain on your opponent. Draco Meteor and Hydro Pump are good early-game moves for tearing holes in the opposing team, while Surf and Dragon Pulse are better used for sweeping late=game since they have decent power and perfect accuracy.</p> <p>With four STAB moves, it is important to know when it is appropriate to use each attack. The choice for which move to use depends mainly on what Kingdra switches into. For example, if Kingdra switches in on a Heatran's Fire Blast early in the game, Draco Meteor is the best option to use as it will beat Naive Choice Scarf Heatran whether they switch or not, and will maim an incoming Water-type resist. Later in the game, Surf and Hydro Pump are generally safer options because most Water-type resists are Water-type Pokemon and do not threaten Kingdra directly.</p> <p>The EVs on the set allow Kingdra to outspeed Adamant Lucario, Jolly Mamoswine, and Jolly Gyarados before a Dragon Dance, which gives Kingdra a chance to defeat them before they wreak havoc. It is important to note that the preferred ability on this set is Swift Swim, because a Timid Kingdra with 286 Speed outspeeds everything commonly seen on a Rain Dance team, and other Kingdra almost never run Speed-boosting natures. A Modest nature can be used instead to achieve more power.</p> <p>Like any offensive Pokemon, Kingdra will appreciate residual damage to secure more KOs. However, Choice Specs Kingdra is more of a supporter for the team, as it offers a very sturdy resist to Fire- and Water-type attacks and the power to retaliate against many Pokemon that carry those moves. Therefore, pairing Kingdra with Pokemon that have weaknesses to these types will allow more opportunities for Kingdra to switch in and fire off attacks. One thing to note is that Kingdra is susceptible to Toxic Spikes and neutral to Stealth Rock, so a grounded Poison-type or a Rapid Spin user will increase the number of times Kingdra will enter the field to do damage.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While Kingdra lacks any form of recovery outside of Rest, his excellent typing and respectable 75 / 95 / 95 defenses make it a great status absorber and offensive tank. Unlike other Kingdra sets, this one can actually switch in multiple times throughout the match without worrying too much about taking damage and status effects. People are often even thrown off-guard by Rest, since some just aim at weakening Kingdra to the point of revenge killing with a priority attacker--a strategy that will lead straight to their demise against this set.</p> <p>Typically, this Kingdra will be able to Dragon Dance a few times then Rest off the damage before using Outrage. Sleep Talk remedies the issue of being locked into Outrage if it is selected while sleeping, and thus makes Outrage the superior choice over Waterfall as Kingdra's STAB attack. Outrage also has the advantage of not being walled completely by the likes of Vaporeon and other Pokemon immune to Water-type attacks, and allows Kingdra to hit Dragon-types for super effective damage.</p> <p>This Kingdra's main purpose on a team is to act as a pseudo-counter to many common Pokemon while still maintaining offensive momentum. It makes a great addition to any balanced team, particularly those that carry Pokemon to beat common phazers and stall, which are this set's downfall. This set is usually better suited as an early- to mid-game sweeper as it tends to outlive most of its counters in the long run and will have multiple opportunities to switch in. Unfortunately, being countered by common OU Pokemon, such as Scizor and Metagross, tends to hinder Kingdra's effectiveness.</p> <p>An EV spread of 252 HP / 96 Atk / 160 SpD will allow Kingdra to shrug off special attacks directed at it and easily set up on defensive Pokemon such as Celebi, Swampert, physical Jirachi, Vaporeon, Suicune, Hippowdon, Blissey, and Dusknoir. Life Orb Starmie can only 4HKO this set, turning a powerful sweeper into setup fodder. Despite these advantages, it may be worthwhile to use a more offensive spread; if you decide to go this route, using an EV spread of 244 HP / 112 Atk / 152 Spe with an Adamant nature is recommended. This grants Kingdra the ability to outrun Choice Scarf Tyranitar after one Dragon Dance, and gives it a Leftovers number.</p> <p>This set benefits from partners who can switch in on the Steel-type Pokemon whom Kingdra has trouble against, particularly Metagross, Scizor, and Skarmory. Rotom-A makes a decent partner to this set for its ability to take on all three of the noted Pokemon. Unless they switch in on Superpower or Earthquake respectively, Heatran and Infernape can threaten all three Pokemon listed; Kingdra in turn can switch in on many Ground- and Water-type attacks that threaten these Pokemon. Thanks to Magnet Pull and a resistance to Dragon-type attacks, Magnezone is one of the best partners for Kingdra. However, care must be taken to make sure Magnezone doesn't switch in on a Scizor U-turn or Metagross Earthquake.</p> <p>Having a Steel-type Pokemon of your own to switch in on Dragon-type attacks from Dragonite or Choice Scarf Flygon is also a good idea. Scizor can switch in on all of the aforementioned Dragons, take a Dragon-type attack, and hit them with Bullet Punch. Choice Band Scizor works best as it has Pursuit to take out fleeing Starmie and Celebi, and also tends to attract Fire- and Water-type Pokemon, whom Kingdra can set up on.</p> "

  "Donphan": {
    "overview": "<p>With the ability to switch in on many common physical attackers and remove entry hazards while taking only light damage in the process, Donphan makes a fine Rapid Spin user in the OU environment. Its lack of a reliable recovery move and its low Special Defense stat are both disheartening traits, but Donphan has great HP, Attack, and Defense stats that it can put to good use. Ghost-types that attempt to spinblock are not a huge problem for Donphan as it can hit them with Assurance.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Donphan has a surprisingly good movepool with numerous options. Charm is a great option to soften physical hits even further, but it is unreliable against opponents such as Metagross and Gliscor, who have Clear Body and Hyper Cutter, respectively. Both sets can utilize Body Slam; the paralysis chance could be helpful due to Donphan's awful Speed stat. Counter could be a devastating surprise for an opponent aiming to take out Donphan with boosted attacks, but Donphan rarely has a free moveslot for such a move. A set based around Rock Polish is usable, but Donphan is outclassed by Rhyperior at this as it doesn't get STAB on Stone Edge. Fire Fang is an option if Scizor troubles your team, but STAB Earthquake does more than enough damage to take care of it. RestTalk is Donphan's only way to recover health, and is therefore usable if you are desperate, but the unreliability of Sleep Talk alongside Earthquake could prove disastrous. Finally, Odor Sleuth is a great option to temporarily remove a Ghost-type's immunity to Rapid Spin, which allows Donphan to remove entry hazards with success.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As the goal of most Donphan is to support their teams with Rapid Spin, Ghost-types such as Dusknoir and Rotom-A cause problems for them. Both these spinblockers have access to Will-O-Wisp which can burn Donphan, making its physical moves worthless. Dusknoir and Rotom-A can also block any attempt to use Rapid Spin, while Rotom-A is immune to Earthquake with its Levitate ability.</p> <p>Steel-types immune to Earthquake can wall Donphan by forcing it to switch out or use a weaker coverage move. In addition, Bronzong can put Donphan to sleep with Hypnosis, while Skarmory can use Whirlwind to remove it from the field. Bulky Water-types, such as Vaporeon and Suicune, make excellent counters to Donphan as they take little damage from Earthquake, can recover health with Wish and Rest respectively, and can hit Donphan super effectively with STAB Surf; the latter can even set up with Calm Mind. In general, you can prey on Donphan's low Special Defense stat and destroy it with specially based Ice-, Grass-, or Water-type moves. Any faster threat with one of the aforementioned moves can KO it with little worry.</p> ",

Donphan's resistance to Stealth Rock, a handy trait for a spinner, lets it take a pitiful 6.25% damage upon switching in. Donphan's great HP and Defense stats allow it to take physical hits reasonably well, while its huge Attack stat enables it to dish out powerful hits simultaneously. Opponents such as Tyranitar, Metagross, and Scizor are unable to do large amounts of damage to Donphan, which makes it a fine choice to remove entry hazards from the field.</p> <p>Earthquake, Donphan's most powerful STAB move, hits Lucario and Metagross super effectively. Assurance allows Donphan to hit Ghost-types, particularly Rotom-A, for super effective damage. Stealth Rock breaks the opponent's Focus Sash, and also weakens foes as they switch in. Ice Shard hits weakened Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Flygon, who are both 4x weak to the move. Finally, Roar is helpful to shuffle your opponent's team.</p> <p>The EVs give Donphan maximum defensive capability while keeping its offensive power. 252 HP EVs both maximize bulk and grant Donphan a perfect Leftovers recovery number, while 188 Attack EVs allow it to OHKO standard Choice Scarf Rotom-A with Assurance after taking Stealth Rock damage, while being able to 2HKO most standard defensive versions. The remaining EVs are placed into Defense to give Donphan greater tanking ability. Optionally, 44 Speed EVs let Donphan outrun hindering-natured Swampert and neutral-natured Blissey so it can take them out before they can use Ice Beam and Wish, respectively.</p> <p>Donphan has a hard time dealing with specially based bulky Water- and Grass-types, such as Suicune and Celebi, respectively. For these reasons, Blissey makes an excellent partner for this set; she can switch in on almost every special-based move in the game with little trouble. She has the added bonus of learning Thunder Wave, which can help compensate for Donphan's pitiful Speed. Heatran is a useful partner to check the common Rotom-A, who can switch in with impunity on Rapid Spin or Earthquake while threatening it with Will-O-Wisp or Tricking it a Choice item. Heatran takes advantage of both of these conditions; it can net a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp and has no fear of Choice items as it usually carries its own. Rotom-A, being unable to significantly damage Heatran, are forced to switch out or face a boosted Fire Blast.</p> "

Even without much defensive investment, Donphan is still difficult to take down. Furthermore, offensive Donphan can damage some of OU's most dangerous threats, namely Tyranitar, Swampert, and Metagross. This set provides the best possible type coverage, as only Breloom resists the combination of Earthquake, Stone Edge, and Assurance.</p> <p>Earthquake is Donphan's most powerful move. With 100 Base Power and a STAB boost, it will put a huge dent into any opponent that doesn't resist it. The second move, Stone Edge, hits Flying-types that are immune to Earthquake, and will specifically always 2HKO the standard bulky Gyarados even without Stealth Rock. Ice Shard allows Donphan to hit Dragonite and Flygon for 4x super effective damage. Assurance enables Donphan to hit Ghost-types that expect Rapid Spin. Lastly, Rapid Spin is a helpful move that rids the field of entry hazards, while Seed Bomb lets Donphan OHKO even the most defensive of Swampert.</p> <p>Maximum Attack EVs are a must for any offensive Pokemon, while 84 Speed EVs allow Donphan to outrun all uninvested base 60 Pokemon, most notably Swampert and Blissey. The remaining EVs are placed into HP to supplement Donphan's natural bulk. An alternate EV spread of 68 HP / 252 Atk / 188 Spe allows Donphan to outspeed 96 Speed Tyranitar and OHKO with Earthquake.</p> <p>Due to its offensive nature, this set will encounter problems with defensive Pokemon that resist or are immune to Earthquake, such as Bronzong and Skarmory. Both of these threats can be handled by Heatran and its STAB Fire-type moves; Heatran has the added ability to switch into Ice- and Grass-type moves aimed at Donphan. Rotom-A is another problematic Pokemon for this set. Although Assurance hits it for super effective damage, the threat of Will-O-Wisp makes Donphan think twice about staying in. Heatran deserves another mention here as it can switch into Will-O-Wisp and even Trick with little to no fear, and doesn't take significant damage from any of Rotom-A's attacks.</p> <p>Note that this Donphan can take good advantage of Gravity, as Earthquake hits Flying-types and Levitate users, such as Gengar and Rotom-A, while the only common Pokemon that resist it are Heracross, Celebi, and Breloom. Jirachi and Bronzong are great choices to set up Gravity as they can switch into Ice- and Grass-type moves fired at Donphan.</p> "

  "Porygon2": {
    "overview": "<p>Even though Porygon2 is an NFE Pokemon, it can still shine in the OU tier due to its ability to check common threats. Its Trace ability allows it to copy the ability of any Pokemon it switches into; this is extremely useful, as it gives the defensive duck a unique niche in the OU metagame. Porygon2 can also be employed as an excellent support Pokemon on a dedicated Trick Room team, as it is able to both set up Trick Room and take advantage of its effects. Even though Porygon2's defensive stats are good, they are by no means great, so Porygon2 will often struggle with powerful STAB attacks from threats such as Shaymin. Additionally, while Porygon2's Normal typing affords only one weakness to Fighting-type attacks, any Pokemon who utilizes Fighting-type attacks will often be able to deal significant damage to it. Despite these drawbacks, Porygon2's unique abilities make it a solid choice on any OU team in need of its specific services.</p> ",

        "name": "Utility Counter",
        "description": "<p>Don't let Porygon2's NFE status fool you; with its decent defensive stats and rare ability, Trace, Porygon2 can be an effective check to a multitude of common OU threats. Examples of such threats include, but are not limited to, Heatran, Gyarados, and Jolteon. However, the aforementioned Pokemon aren't the only Pokemon whom Porygon2 can check, as the defensive duck's Normal typing only comes with one weakness: Fighting-type attacks.</p> <p>Recover allows Porygon2 to regenerate 50% of its HP in one turn and, as such, is its most reliable means of recovery. Thunderbolt is the primary option in the second moveslot as it is more powerful than its counterpart, Discharge. However, Discharge has a neat 30% paralysis rate and only slightly less Base Power than Thunderbolt, so it is still a viable option. Ice Beam allows Porygon2 to deal solid damage to Dragon- and Ground-types, such as Dragonite or Hippowdon. It also gives Porygon2 a means of harming Jolteon, who is immune to Thunderbolt (and Discharge). In the final moveslot, Porygon2 has your preferred status move. Thunder Wave is great for paralyzing fast switch-ins like Lucario and Jirachi, while Toxic is useful as it enables Porygon2 to bring down more defensive Pokemon like Blissey and Swampert.</p> <p>This set's EV spread is fairly simple: 252 HP EVs let Porygon2 take both physical and special hits well, while 216 Defense EVs and a Bold nature give it plenty of physical bulk. 40 Special Attack EVs are used as they secure the OHKO on Gyarados with Discharge (after Stealth Rock damage). Leftovers is by far the best item choice as it grants Porygon2 constant HP recovery, which will often mean the difference between a 2HKO and a 3HKO.</p> <p>Even though Porygon2 is a defensive Pokemon, it is best used as a defensive pivot on offensive teams that have a weakness to Pokemon like Gyarados and Heatran. Teams that carry Choice Band Scizor will greatly appreciate Porygon2's ability to check two of Choice Band Scizor's most common switch-ins; teams with Breloom are in a similar position. Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Lucario, have a relatively easy time with Porygon2, as they are able to OHKO it with their STAB attacks. With their Fighting typing and immunity to status due to Guts, Machamp and Heracross are able to easily obliterate Porygon2. As such, teammates who can absorb the STAB Fighting-type attacks of the aforementioned Pokemon make excellent partners for this set. Gyarados is probably Porygon2's best teammate, as he can easily switch in on Fighting-type attacks and set up with Dragon Dance. Gengar is also an excellent choice, being immune to Fighting-type attacks and able to wear down the opposition with his powerful special attacks. In general, this Porygon2 variant doesn't require a lot of team support, as it mainly supports its team instead. However, make sure that you aren't just randomly throwing Porygon2 onto your team; it must be used on a team with weaknesses to Pokemon like Heatran, Gyarados, and Jolteon if you are to use Porygon2 to its full potential.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes are a gigantic thorn in Porygon2's side, so having a teammate who can get rid of them is extremely helpful. Rapid Spinners, such as Starmie and Forretress, can easily dispose of the hazard; grounded Poison-types like Roserade and Tentacruel can also absorb Toxic Spikes upon entry. Additionally, Roserade and Tentacruel can set up Toxic Spikes of their own, allowing Porygon2 to break past bulkier Pokemon such as Swampert, Suicune, and Blissey. Porygon2 also has good defensive synergy with the aforementioned Poison-types, as they pack a resistance to Fighting-type attacks, Porygon2's only weakness.</p> "

        "name": "Trick Room",
        "description": "<p>Due to its excellent defensive capabilities and access to Recover, Porygon2 is a wonderful support Pokemon on a dedicated Trick Room team. Trace allows Porygon2 to switch in on a multitude of threats, such as Heatran and Jolteon, with total impunity. It can then proceed to set up Trick Room and take advantage of its effects. While common Pokemon like Lucario and Infernape can immediately threaten this Porygon2 variant, Porygon2 only needs one turn to set up Trick Room; after it has done this, you can simply switch to a teammate who can take advantage of Trick Room. Aside from its defensive capabilities, the main reason that one would use Porygon2 over another Trick Room supporter is that Porygon2 lacks Ghost- and Dark-type weaknesses, something that several common Trick Room users are plagued by.</p> <p>There are a few unique options that Porygon2 can take advantage of if you would like to use it in a more offensive light. Download can be used instead of Trace as Porygon2's ability, as this will allow Porygon2 to obtain potential Special Attack boosts. Additionally, Life Orb can be utilized to give Porygon2's attacks more of a kick. While an offensive Porygon2 isn't as powerful as other notable Trick Room sweepers like the deadly Machamp, Porygon2's bulk and ability to be both a Trick Room supporter and sweeper grants an offensive set its own niche on a Trick Room team.</p> <p>The EV spread may look complicated, but it is really quite simple. 252 HP EVs allow for good overall bulk, while 120 Defense EVs let Porygon2 take powerful physical hits while it sets up Trick Room. 136 Special Attack EVs are used to give Porygon2 a bigger offensive boost, and a Quiet nature is used to raise Porygon2's Special Attack while simultaneously lowering its Speed, granting it a higher chance of moving first in Trick Room. 0 Speed IVs are used to ensure that Porygon2 will outspeed almost every Pokemon once Trick Room is up. While the aforementioned EV spread is the most versatile, an alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 216 Def / 40 SpA with a Relaxed nature is quite useable if your team happens to need a more reliable check to Gyarados.</p> <p>Two of the most common Trick Room Porygon2 switch-ins are Blissey and Tyranitar. Both Pokemon threaten Porygon2 in their own way; Blissey sponges all of Porygon2's moves with ease, while Tyranitar takes a pittance from all of Porygon2's attacks and can set up with Dragon Dance or spam STAB Stone Edge. In order to deal with the aforementioned Pokemon, specific teammates should be utilized. Rhyperior is an excellent choice, capable of threatening both Tyranitar and Blissey with his STAB attacks. Additionally, Rhyperior is extraordinarily slow and, as such, can easily take advantage of Trick Room. For similar reasons, Machamp is also an excellent choice. Seeing as Porygon2's chief role is to set up Trick Room, it only makes sense to pack teammates who can take advantage of it. Examples of such teammates include, but are not limited to: Rhyperior, Machamp, Rampardos, and Snorlax. However, any moderately slow Pokemon can take advantage of Trick Room just as the previously mentioned powerhouses do, so potential teammates for this Porygon2 variant are as endless as the horizon.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>For an NFE Pokemon, Porygon2 has an incredible movepool; therefore, there are a multitude of other options that it can utilize. Recycle is an interesting move that can allow Porygon2 to reuse any Berry, whether it is the HP-restoring Sitrus Berry, the PP-replenishing Leppa Berry, or the always-useful Lum Berry. A Choice Specs + Trick set can be used to take advantage of Porygon2's good Special Attack stat while being able to cripple Blissey. In a similar manner, Pain Split can be utilized to let Porygon2 get past Blissey much more easily. Tri Attack is a reliable STAB move that may see some use, but Porygon2 is often better off using specialized moves like Thunderbolt and Ice Beam. Hidden Power Ground and Fire can hurt Steel-types, who will otherwise have no difficulty switching in. Psychic and Shadow Ball are alternative attacking options that provide coverage on Fighting- and Ghost-types, respectively, but Porygon2 is usually better off with its other moves. Porygon2 also has a few uncommon support moves that it can use, most notably Psych Up and Magic Coat. Psych Up allows Porygon2 to copy opposing sweepers' stat boosts, and Magic Coat lets it bounce harmful status moves back at the users. While Porygon2 isn't much of a sweeper, Charge Beam, Agility, and Sharpen can be used as boosting moves if you want to try to utilize it in a more offensive role. Finally, a specially defensive EV spread may see use on sets that focus more on countering Heatran and Jolteon than physical attackers. Keep in mind that if you do use a specially defensive spread, Porygon2 will not be able to check physical sweepers like Gyarados as easily, so you must be much more careful when switching in on them.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Porygon2 is somewhat difficult to switch into, as it has a habit of spreading crippling status conditions. Despite this, there are a few Pokemon who, once in, can really hurt it. Heracross, Machamp, and Lucario can smack Porygon2 around with their STAB Fighting-type attacks. Tyranitar isn't hurt badly by any of Porygon2's attacking options thanks to his sandstorm-boosted Special Defense stat, and can smash Porygon2 with Superpower (or STAB Stone Edge). Keep in mind that all of the aforementioned Pokemon risk being crippled by a potential Thunder Wave on the switch-in (with the exception of Heracross and Machamp, who can abuse status with their Guts ability), so tread carefully. Blissey can sponge all of Porygon2's attacks with total impunity thanks to her massive Special Defense and HP stats. Jirachi can cause major problems, as the most that Porygon2 can attempt to do is paralyze it (which won't even affect Substitute variants). Finally, while Porygon2 is a sturdy check to Pokemon such as Heatran, Jolteon, and Vaporeon, keep in mind that it is vulnerable to their assaults if it does not Trace their abilities first.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Smeargle is somewhat of an anomaly in the world of competitive Pokemon. It has the lowest BST of all OU--and even UU--Pokemon, and yet it maintains its presence among the best of the best by having a movepool that quite literally expands ad infinitum. Knowing every single move in the game gives Smeargle an edge over the competition that it takes advantage of to great effect in a variety of ways.</p> <p>Those abysmally low stats truly do haunt Smeargle, however. It can't safely switch into any attack, and thus playing with it on a team often leaves you feeling as though you're playing with a Pokemon down at all times. Despite that, access to all of the entry hazards, and more importantly Spore, keeps Smeargle afloat in the OU tier and makes it a Pokemon that your opponents would be wise to not underestimate.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The question you should be asking yourself is: \"What option <em>doesn't</em> Smeargle have?\" Smeargle has access to every move in the game, and therefore can do pretty much anything; the problem is that it can't do most of those things well. If you were considering using Smeargle offensively, save yourself the trouble and don't; Kakuna has higher attacking stats than Smeargle, which should pretty much kill the idea for you. Smeargle can set up Toxic Spikes instead of Spikes, but this job is better delegated to the likes of Roserade or Tentacruel, both of which have much better mid-game utility on offensive and balanced teams than Smeargle. Rapid Spin is in Smeargle's repertoire, but without the bulk to switch in, it makes a poor choice as well. Every other option even worth its salt in Smeargle's movepool has been mentioned in the above sets, so those are generally the way to go.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Smeargle is KOed by even the slightest of breezes, so pretty much any Pokemon with a respectably powerful STAB attack will beat it. That said, switching into Smeargle the first time it's out is troublesome because of Spore, so a Pokemon able to absorb it is handy to have. RestTalk Pokemon can switch into Spore and use Sleep Talk to try to take Smeargle out the following turn. A user of Rapid Spin is very helpful for removing the hard-won Spikes that Smeargle sets up, and there's none better for this role against offensive teams than Starmie. Starmie's powerful Hydro Pump obliterates both Smeargle and the spinblockers that might be sent in to nullify Rapid Spin.</p> ",

        "name": "Lead",
        "description": "<p>Smeargle is one of the best leads for offensive teams that want Spikes set up from the get-go. Against bulkier leads that lack Lum Berry, such as Swampert and Hippowdon, Smeargle can use Spore and then freely set up Spikes and also Stealth Rock, if it has it. Against faster leads that are vulnerable to sleep, such as Heatran, Smeargle will likely manage to only use Spore and set up one layer of Spikes, but this is still enough to help offensive teams. U-turn allows Smeargle to break the Focus Sash of leads such as Aerodactyl and Azelf, which commonly carry Taunt to disrupt Smeargle's setup strategy.</p> <p>Spore, Spikes, and U-turn are Smeargle's greatest assets for offensive teams and are why you'd want to use it in the first place. The last slot depends on whether you'd rather take out Machamp leads, with Own Tempo to prevent confusion, or if you want to set up Stealth Rock early. Counter can also be used at other times if Smeargle still has its Focus Sash intact.</p> <p>Because Smeargle really wants to go first in combat in order to Spore the opponent, 252 EVs are invested in Speed with a Jolly nature. 252 EVs are then placed in Defense to maximize its physical bulk, where it will be taking most hits and can respond with Counter. The leftover EVs are dropped in HP for a minuscule amount of added bulk. Focus Sash is the item of choice to keep Smeargle alive through one attack at the very least.</p> <p>Other options for the last slot include Taunt, Protect, Magic Coat, Encore, Perish Song, Explosion, Destiny Bond, and Lunar Dance. Taunt stops the opponent's Pokemon from setting up entry hazards or stat boosts on Smeargle. Protect prevents Smeargle from having its Focus Sash broken by Fake Out leads, such as Infernape. Magic Coat allows Smeargle to reflect Spore back at opposing Smeargle leads and Sleep Powder back at Roserade leads, which would otherwise stop Smeargle from getting any hazards up. Encore, Perish Song, Explosion, and Destiny Bond all provide different ways of stopping a Pokemon from using Smeargle as easy setup bait. Finally, Lunar Dance gives another Pokemon on Smeargle's team a second chance at a sweep by restoring their health to 100% and curing any status ailments.</p> <p>Smeargle has problems with Infernape, Jirachi, Lum Berry Metagross, and Roserade leads because they prevent it from using Spore effectively and limit its ability to set up. Gyarados and Starmie can deal with Infernape leads and also Metagross leads in the former's case. Heatran does well against Jirachi and also scares off Metagross leads, but must be wary of switching in on the latter's Earthquake. Roserade usually requires you to sacrifice a Pokemon to its Sleep Powder, but Heatran maims it afterward. Machamp leads are also a lot harder to deal with if you lack Counter, since not even Ghost-type Pokemon like switching into a possible Payback, meaning that you might have to switch a few times to safely get in a Pokemon that can OHKO Machamp. Smeargle has to U-turn against Aerodactyl and Azelf leads because of the likely Taunt, and so needs a partner to take them out after it has broken their Focus Sash. Choice Band Scizor is an excellent candidate to dispose of these two, as its powerful Bullet Punch easily KOes them before they can set up or attack. However, be wary of Magnezone switching in, as it is commonly paired with the aforementioned leads.</p> <p>When using this Smeargle as a lead, a spinblocker is necessary to stop your entry hazards from being spun away. Rotom-A is the best option for this due to its bulk and respectable offensive presence. Gengar can also block Rapid Spin while being a strong offensive threat that can take advantage of Spikes, but is very fragile, so one wrong switch could lead to its death. It is also important to have Pokemon on your team that can utilize the Spikes that Smeargle lays down. U-turn users like Flygon and Scizor fit the bill just fine because they cause many switches and thus rack up entry hazard damage. Heatran and Swampert can be used as phazers to slowly whittle down the opponent's Pokemon if they fit your team's style. Gyarados and Lucario both appreciate Spikes support for taking out Pokemon that would otherwise stop them, such as Hippowdon in Lucario's case or Vaporeon in Gyarados's. Heatran, Shaymin, and Starmie are all strong offensive threats in general that make good use of Spikes by forcing switches. If you choose Counter in the last slot, then a Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock, such as Heatran or Swampert, is critical to add to the residual damage your opponent will suffer.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf Lead",
        "description": "<p>With this set, Smeargle sacrifices the ability to take a hit for the ability to beat the faster leads that a Focus Sash leaves it at the mercy of. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Smeargle now catches Aerodactyl, Azelf, Infernape, and Roserade leads off guard with the fastest Spore in the game. Furthermore, Choice Scarf Smeargle functions much better in the mid-game due to its ability to outspeed base 130 Speed Pokemon and cripple them with Spore or Encore.</p> <p>Ultimately, this Smeargle is still trying to set up Spikes for your team. To facilitate that, Spore, arguably the best move in the game, makes a return on this set. Stealth Rock can be used instead of Spikes if your team calls for it, but Smeargle is so effective at setting up multiple layers of Spikes that it's almost a waste. Against leads with Lum Berry that Smeargle can't beat anyway, such as Machamp and Metagross, U-turn comes in handy to quickly get out of Dodge. Encore, however, is an effective way for Smeargle to shut down setup sweepers--that is, those that aren't boosting their Speed--before they become a problem.</p> <p>For this set, general bulk is more valuable than specific bulk, especially if you're using Encore. You will be trying to sneak this Smeargle in against both special and physical attackers in order to Spore, Encore, or set up Spikes on them. Because of that, 252 EVs are placed in HP. 216 Speed EVs are used to outspeed base 130 Speed Pokemon with a Speed-boosting nature, such as Jolteon and Aerodactyl. The rest of the EVs are put in Defense to bulk up Smeargle as much as possible. If you're anticipating switching into special threats more, then placing them in Special Defense instead is a legitimate option. Destiny Bond and Explosion are viable over Encore or U-turn for taking an opponent down with Smeargle when it has done his job. Despite Smeargle's pitiful Attack stat, STAB manages to turn Explosion into a deadly weapon that can OHKO even bulky Pokemon like Gyarados and Machamp. When running Explosion, use an EV spread of 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe to maximize its damage. Finally, Lunar Dance can be used to give a teammate another chance at sweeping when needed.</p> <p>While Smeargle has a better matchup with this set against many leads than a set with Focus Sash would, it still unequivocally loses to Jirachi (which OHKOes Smeargle with Iron Head). Fortunately, you can take advantage of a Jirachi's Iron Head and use Pokemon such as Gyarados or Heatran to set up on it. You should also consider using a Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock; Heatran, Swampert, and Gliscor are excellent choices for this role. Magnezone can also switch into Jirachi's Iron Head with impunity and set up on it. Pokemon that can force a lot of switches, such as U-turn users and phazers, are great partners once Smeargle sets down a layer or two of Spikes.</p> "

        "name": "Lv. 1 Endeavor Lead",
        "description": "<p>Smeargle's boundless movepool enables it to run a rather annoying Endeavor set from the lead position that's unlike any other. The strategy is to use Trick Room on Smeargle's first turn out, letting it go first on turn two. Once Trick Room is active, Smeargle should Spore the opposing lead if it isn't likely to have a Lum Berry; otherwise, it should Endeavor it. If Smeargle used Spore, then next it should use Endeavor to severely cripple the opposing lead. Under Trick Room, Smeargle will go first and use Dragon Rage to KO the opposing lead, and then be in a favorable position for crippling the opponent's next Pokemon as well. Protect can be used in the place of Trick Room to enable Smeargle to beat Fake Out leads, but they are relatively uncommon in OU outside of Infernape. In some match-ups, this Smeargle will be able to KO the opposing lead and then either put something else to sleep or reduce it to 1 HP.</p> <p>Because Smeargle is level 1 with this set and will be OHKOed by anything and everything that deals damage, there's little reason to invest any EVs into its defenses. That said, you should <em>not invest any EVs into HP if you're compelled to use all of Smeargle's 508 EVs; Smeargle wants as low an HP stat as possible. It is worth noting that a 0 HP IV isn't necessary because it doesn't actually reduce Smeargle's HP stat at all at level 1. 252 EVs are placed in Speed for the chance to win the Speed tie with opposing Endeavor Smeargle leads and Spore them first. Focus Sash is used because it lets Smeargle survive one hit and then use Endeavor to bring the opponent down to exactly 1 HP.</p> <p>This set has trouble with common Lum Berry leads, such as Metagross and Machamp, and anything that induces hail or sandstorm. The reason Lum Berry leads are so problematic is because they also carry priority moves to use once they break Smeargle's Focus Sash. Tyranitar and Abomasnow leads also trouble Smeargle because they can OHKO through Focus Sash with their damaging weather. In all of these cases, Smeargle can either switch out to a teammate or simply drop the opponent to 1 HP with Endeavor and get KOed. Machamp is a very difficult Pokemon to switch into, but Ghost-type Pokemon like Rotom-A do so relatively well and can weaken it to KO range for another Pokemon to finish off. Heatran switches into Metagross well if it can avoid Earthquake, while Rotom-A can burn Metagross and 3HKO it if the need arises. A Fighting-type of your own, such as Machamp or Breloom, can switch into Tyranitar with ease and threaten it out. Metagross can switch into both Tyranitar and Abomasnow with relative ease and threaten to OHKO both with Meteor Mash. Metagross can also set up Stealth Rock, which will prevent Pokemon that Smeargle Endeavors from safely coming back into the battle. Jirachi leads present Smeargle with an interesting dilemma. 40% of the time, Smeargle will win, while the other 60% of the time it will lose. To play it safe, Heatran can switch into Iron Head and threaten to OHKO Jirachi with Fire Blast. Heatran, like Metagross, can be used to set up Stealth Rock for your team.</p> <p>This Smeargle pairs well with teammates that can set up Trick Room or entry hazards and those with powerful priority. Trick Room isn't mandatory in choosing partners for Smeargle, but with it, Smeargle can sometimes get in later in the match and Endeavor another Pokemon. Entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock, are valuable to Smeargle because it reduces the opposing Pokemon's HP to KO range for Stealth Rock. This means that Endeavored foes that switch out will be unable to safely come back in later in the match. Good choices for setting up Stealth Rock are Metagross or Heatran because they also check some of the leads that Smeargle has trouble with. Strong priority users can pick off Endeavored Pokemon before they get the chance to do anything. Scizor and Lucario can use Bullet Punch and Extreme Speed, respectively, to finish off weakened Pokemon. Both of these Pokemon also have the added benefit of checking a few of the leads that Smeargle doesn't like dealing with.</p> "

  "Blissey": {
    "overview": "<p>Blissey's enormous base 255 HP and large base 135 Special Defense stats just scream special wall; in fact, it has the most special bulk in the game and access to instant recovery in Soft-Boiled. Blissey is so bulky that even extremely strong or boosting special attackers such as Choice Specs Heatran, Choice Specs Latias, Choice Specs Kingdra in rain, Gengar, Starmie, offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, offensive Calm Mind Suicune, and Substitute + Petaya Berry Empoleon are unable to break through it. This walling prowess allows it to spread status effectively via Thunder Wave and Toxic or take advantage of its huge support movepool with options such as Stealth Rock, Heal Bell, and Wish. Despite its lopsided stat distribution, it has more physical bulk than Clefable when fully invested and can spread status to physical attackers such as Tyranitar and Gyarados that cannot OHKO it.</p> <p>Blissey has been usurped by Clefable as a special wall due to Blissey's massive weakness to residual damage. Clefable's immunity to this residual damage and access to more utility moves such as Knock Off and Encore largely outclass Blissey's astronomical bulk. Blissey's vulnerability to all three entry hazards, sand, and status compromise its bulk and wear it down quickly. Blissey especially struggles with offensive pressure from attackers such as Breloom, mixed Flygon, and Tyranitar when backed by Spikes, forcing either Rapid Spin support or another way to mitigate entry hazards. Blissey also can easily be taken advantage of via Trick, Explosion, Taunt, Ghost-types with Substitute, and Lum Berry, as its offensive options are very weak and it can't afford to be locked into one attack. Blissey despises Fighting-types, as Machamp, Breloom, Infernape, and Lucario all OHKO it after Stealth Rock and force it out. Fighting-type coverage also is very common and attackers such Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Scizor can devastate it with Superpower. Blissey does not enjoy repeatedly dealing with physical attackers such as Gyarados, Metagross, and Swampert, especially if they can mitigate status.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Blissey has a humongous movepool, and can always use Heal Bell, Toxic, Sing, Flamethrower, Thunder, and Thunderbolt over Stealth Rock should Blissey not need to set it up. Heal Bell is fantastic on more defensive teams, as it can heal status and gets many opportunities to do so. Toxic allows Blissey to more actively pressure foes, as it has enough bulk to Toxic stall. It does nothing to help against the many Steel-types trying to set up on it, however. Sing is another status move that while it has low accuracy, has high payoff if it does hit and Blissey's bulk gives it chances to use it multiple times. Flamethrower can heavily damage Steel-types such as Skarmory, Scizor, Lucario, and Forretress. Thunder gives Blissey an OHKO on Gyarados and a 2HKO on Skarmory and Starmie, while Thunderbolt more reliably hits these Pokemon. However, the most valuable asset of Thunder is its paralysis chance, which can be further boosted with Serene Grace. This allows it to compress Thunder Wave and an offensive move into one moveslot, letting it use a utility option. Blissey can even use Ice Beam and Thunder as its offensive options over Seismic Toss. Other ways to take advantage of Serene Grace such as Shadow Ball dropping Special Defense, Body Slam paralyzing Ground-types, and Ice Beam causing a 20% chance to freeze are possible. Wish is another possibility, as Blissey can heal teammates effectively and has the bulk to pull it off.</p> <p>Blissey has many other interesting options, such as Counter to OHKO physical attackers, Charm to soften physical moves (but watch out that it is incompatible with Seismic Toss), and Snatch, which can steal certain moves such as boosting moves, recovery, Substitute, Reflect, and Light Screen. It also stops a Copycat Lucario in its tracks. Some other options include Healing Wish to heal up a teammate, Copycat to take advantage of moves Blissey does not learn such as setting up entry hazards, Block + Tail Whip to be a complete pest and set up a scenario for Pursuit trapping, and Gravity to enhance accuracy and increase the effectiveness of Ground-type attacks as well as entry hazards.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Machamp fears almost nothing Blissey can do and OHKOes it with DynamicPunch. Other Fighting-types such as Breloom, Lucario, Infernape, Heracross, and Gallade do the same. Breloom is even immune to status once Toxic Orb activates, while Heracross gains a Guts boost. The others do not enjoy being statused on the switch-in, however.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Blissey is hugely weak to residual damage and this is the main reason why it is not used as much. Stealth Rock and Spikes make switching in challenging, especially if Blissey is forced out before it can heal, while sand and status further interfere with its walling abilities. Toxic Spikes, especially two layers, make Blissey struggle to do much of anything.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Blissey's very low base Defense stat makes it vulnerable to pressure from physical attackers such as Dragonite, Tyranitar, Scizor, and Swampert. All of them can potentially hit Blissey super effectively, compromising its physical bulk. Explosion also is dangerous to Blissey; special attackers such as Heatran and Gengar can lure Blissey in and use Explosion on it to put it at very low health or remove it outright.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Blissey's attacks are pretty weak, so Taunt prevents it from healing and using status moves. Gyarados, Gliscor, Skarmory, and Tyranitar all can devastate Blissey with either set up or slowly wearing it down.</p> <p><strong>Setting-Up: Blissey can only mitigate set-up via status, super effective coverage, or slowly wearing them down with Seismic Toss—sweepers who can survive this use Blissey as set-up fodder. Some examples include Substitute attacks such as Jirachi, Empoleon, Suicune, and Machamp; bulky Pokemon with Rest or other ways to mitigate status such as Calm Mind + Rest Suicune or Calm Mind Clefable; Ghost-types with Taunt or Substitute such as Pain Split Gengar or Charge Beam Rotom-A; and with Lum Berry such as Gyarados, Dragonite, and Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Trick: Blissey is almost completely useless if one of the special attackers it beats such as Choice Specs Latias or Choice Scarf Rotom-A uses Trick and gives it a Choice item. Blissey should be careful to avoid switching into Trick.</p> ",

        "name": "Standard",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Blissey's huge bulk allows it to switch into nearly any special move, heal off the damage, and either wittle the foe down with an attacking move or use its utility moves. Seismic Toss is Blissey's main offensive option, damaging special attackers such as Empoleon, Heatran, Latias, Starmie, Suicune, and Zapdos. Blissey is one of the better Thunder Wave users in the tier—Thunder Wave dissuades offensive Pokemon such as Lucario, Gyarados, Dragonite, Infernape, and Jirachi from taking advantage of it and helps mitigate its slow Speed. As a more offensive option, Blissey can use Ice Beam to discourage Ground-types such as Flygon and Gliscor from absorbing Thunder Wave. Ice Beam also has a chance to OHKO Dragonite after Stealth Rock and hits Substitute Gengar and Rotom-A. Blissey is an excellent user of Stealth Rock, as it easily keeps it up against the premier Rapid Spinner in Starmie, has the bulk to generate free turns, and has the longevity to do over the course of the game.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Blissey greatly appreciates as much physical bulk as possible, and a Bold nature and a 252 HP / 252 Def EV spread emphasizes this. It has a very low base Defense stat and easily walls the tier's special attackers even without any Special Defense EVs. As Blissey only needs 252 Defense EVs to be effective, it has many other possible EV spreads. Especially with Ice Beam, it can run some more Special Attack EVs. With 136 Special Attack EVs, it can always break Gengar's and bulkless Rotom-A's Substitute and OHKO Gliscor and Dragonite after Stealth Rock. Blissey can also run some more Speed EVs, anywhere from 44 Speed EVs to outspeed minimum Speed Clefable to even up to maximum investment and a Timid nature to outspeed neutral nature Swampert, Tyranitar, and Empoleon. It can also lean further into its special bulk with a spread of 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature, which avoids the 2HKO from preposterous attacks such as Flash Fire boosted Choice Specs Heatran's Fire Blast. Keep in mind that investing away from HP or a Bold nature significantly decreases Blissey physical bulk, meaning attacks such as offensive Swampert's Earthquake and Metagross's Meteor Mash will 2HKO it.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Blissey should generally switch into what it walls early and often to set up Stealth Rock and spread Thunder Wave. However, Blissey is huge set-up bait for attackers and utility Pokemon alike, including Substitute attackers such as Breloom, Jirachi, and Machamp; Calm Mind + Rest Suicune; entry hazard setters like Skarmory and Roserade; and Lum Berry physical sweepers such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and Metagross. How to use Blissey greatly depends on the opposing team: for opposing offensive teams, Blissey can be very annoying to special attackers without entry hazard support or ways to mitigate status. Against what it walls, it should be played aggressively to get the most out of it, predicting switches with Thunder Wave and wearing down foes with Seismic Toss. Against more defensive teams, Blissey should take advantage of its huge stock of HP to force Clefable to use its PP and spread paralysis to support Pokemon such as Skarmory and Jirachi. With the moveset given, Blissey has more PP than Clefable and can force it to use a lot of Soft-Boiled PP by using Seismic Toss.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Blissey must take advantage of its niche over Clefable lest it be outclassed: Blissey notably answers Choice Specs Latias, Gengar, Heatran, and Suicune better than Clefable does and teammates should take advantage of that. One of the best teammates for Blissey is Starmie, as it provides Rapid Spin support, speed control, and further can spread paralysis. Blissey also appreciates Pokemon that can switch into physical attackers. Alongside Rapid Spin, physically defensive Zapdos is one of the best choices, as it can easily handle the Fighting-type of the tier such as Machamp and Breloom even if they are behind a Substitute. It can further spread paralysis with Discharge and can take on even boosted physical sweepers. Jirachi also appreciates paralysis to faciliate flinching and can handle very strong attackers with a defensive set or revenge kill them with a Choice Scarf set. Blissey prominently features with teammates who enjoy paralysis: some examples include Substitute Machamp, Swords Dance Breloom, and Substitute + Nasty Plot Togekiss. Blissey also can faciliate more versatile Clefable sets, such as Calm Mind, physically defensive, or even Life Orb, as Blissey absorbs its defensive duties. Other strong defensive Pokemon such as Latias, Skarmory, and Gliscor can further help with physical attackers: Latias can deal with Breloom and offensive Water-types; Skarmory forms the famous SkarmBliss combination, walls physical threats, and sets up Spikes; and Gliscor is one of the best Fighting-type answers in the game and, with a fully specially defensive spread, can assist with threats such as mixed Flygon with entry hazards up. Other interesting partners such as Hitmontop as an alternative Rapid Spinner and physically defensive Dragonite are also possible.</p> <p>Blissey also fits alongside more offensive Pokemon to counter special attackers in one slot. In this scenario, Blissey can fit alongside attackers such as offensive Heatran and Choice Band Dragonite that additionally appreciate Rapid Spin support. Choice Specs Heatran is a particularly good partner, as it immediately opens up a hole, appreciates paralysis support, and often gives Blissey a switch-in on Water-types trying to survive Overheat, such as Suicune and Starmie. Other ways to mitigate entry hazards such as with Magnezone can be helpful. Other attackers such as Gengar and mixed Flygon appreciate Blissey switching into Water-types and Zapdos, as they can struggle to KO them and get crippled or KOed in return.</p> "

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Monstrous, both competitively and aesthetically, Tyranitar is easily one of the most important Pokemon in the tier. Tyranitar’s unique typing, ability to summon sand, fantastic stat spread, and diverse movepool give it incredible versatility; it can excel on nearly any type of team in whatever role needed. With a Choice Scarf, Tyranitar becomes the best Pursuit trapper in the tier while also providing important speed control for defensive teams. With Dragon Dance, it becomes one of the best sweepers in the tier due to its coverage and power; it additionally provides important defensive utility against special attackers such as Rotom-A and Zapdos to hyper offensive teams. Choice Band sets pack destructive power while mixed sets can combine Tyranitar’s various advantages into one package, such as setting up Stealth Rock and being an important check to Latias, Heatran, and Rotom-A. Sand is a centralizing force in the metagame, as it helps residual damage stick on sand-vulnerable Pokemon such as Suicune, Machamp, Gyarados, Dragonite, and Infernape. It also helps to nullify rain sweepers such as Kingdra, Qwilfish, and Ludicolo, especially if Tyranitar is holding a Passho Berry. Tyranitar can be endlessly customized to any team’s needs; its naturally fantastic defenses, resistances, and special defense boost in sand allow it to check most special attackers even without much investment.</p> <p>Tyranitar’s main issues come from its typing and relatively slow speed. While its Rock / Dark typing gives Tyranitar excellent offensive prowess, it also has prominent weaknesses to common types such as Water, Ground, and especially Fighting. The popularity of Pokemon like Jirachi, Infernape, Breloom, Metagross, Lucario, Swampert, Flygon, and Bronzong can undermine its great bulk. Tyranitar is also rather slow even when boosted and has max investment; Choice Scarf versions typically need additional methods to handle speed boosting sweepers such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite, as they will outspeed Tyranitar. Bulkier sets often must choose between being outsped by the majority of the metagame or sacrificing some bulk to outspeed foes such as slower versions of Breloom, Metagross, and Rotom-A. Tyranitar also is quite vulnerable to status; it is weak to Toxic Spikes and can get crippled by a burn from Rotom-A or Heatran.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There are a couple of options that aren't listed in the main sets, but are entirely viable. Tyranitar can focus fully on wallbreaking to use a max speed mixed set with Fire Blast, Ice Beam, Superpower, and a host of other options such as Surf, Hidden Power Grass, Stone Edge, and Crunch with an Expert Belt. Such a set can also lead to take advantage of its coverage and set up Stealth Rock with a Focus Sash. Rock Slide has more accuracy than Stone Edge, but 25% less power, often making it a less effective option. A set revolving around Curse can be used as a late game win condition alongside Rest, Sleep Talk, and Crunch, but it isn't very consistent compared to other Curse users due to Tyranitar's many common weaknesses and its crippling weakness to Fighting-type attacks in particular. Dragon Dance is a much more consistent sweeping set on Tyranitar because it better compensates for Tyranitar's middling speed tier and also circumvents some of the problems that its defensive typing presents. Tyranitar is more than capable of using its massive bulk for a defensive set with Leftovers. 100 / 110 / (154) defenses are among the best in the entire metagame, and with full investment, Tyranitar can be incredibly hard to break on the special side. However, there's no \"one spread\" that's best for this purpose, so really, using defensive Tyranitar comes down to seeing what it needs to do and then giving it a spread that complements that. For example, with maximum Defense EVs, Tyranitar can survive even Dragon Dance Gyarados's Waterfall and still function against special attackers with Protect, maximum HP EVs, and Pursuit. However, it sorely misses the Choice Scarf set's speed for Pursuit trapping Gengar. For supportive sets, Tyranitar can also make use of its fairly solid utility movepool, which includes Roar, Protect, and Thunder Wave, but struggles to fit them on its all purpose set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Most Ground-types such as Swampert, Hippowdon, Gliscor, Quagsire, and Donphan take Tyranitar’s hits well and can retalitate with a super-effective Earthquake. Swampert and Hippowdon are the most notable, only getting 3HKOed at best by Crunch and 2HKOing back with Earthquake. Choice Scarf Flygon can outspeed even +2 Tyranitar and can revenge with Earthquake. All should be careful, as Tyranitar can use any of Surf, Ice Beam, or, rarely, Hidden Power Grass to surprise them while Crunch’s defense drops can help it get through them. Additionally, none of these enjoy Shuca Berry allowing Tyranitar to live their attacks more easily.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types such as Machamp, Breloom, Lucario, Gallade, Heracross, and Infernape almost always OHKO Tyranitar with Fighting-type attacks. Machamp is especially noteworthy, as it can even take on boosted Tyranitar’s attacks and always KO back with DynamicPunch, while Breloom and Infernape can KO it with Mach Punch. Lucario is especially threatening, as it can set up Swords Dance on resisted choiced attacks and threaten to sweep the whole team. With Bullet Punch, it KOs Choice Scarf Tyranitar at +2 even if it tries to revenge kill Lucario. Lucario’s own Choice Scarf set can switch in as Tyranitar uses Dragon Dance and threaten to OHKO it with Close Combat. Breloom is probably one of the best counters to Tyranitar in the game. It resists all of Tyranitar's Dark- and Rock-type moves, and it can use Tyranitar as setup fodder. However, all of these threats can fall if Tyranitar hits them on the switch with the correct attack, such as Fire Blast and Ice Beam in Breloom's case or Earthquake in Lucario case. None of them enjoy taking Superpower from the Choice Band set after some residual damage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types such as Jirachi, Scizor, Metagross, and Bronzong are good initial checks to Tyranitar, as Tyranitar has a difficult time OHKOing them while they can retalitate super effectively. Jirachi’s Iron Head is especially devastating to slower sets, as it 2HKOs and has a high chance to flinch. Scizor only fears Fire-type attacks or a boosted Stone Edge and at least 2HKO back with Bullet Punch or OHKO with U-turn. Metagross OHKOs with Meteor Mash after Stealth Rock and can take at least one boosted hit. Choice Scarf Metagross sets outspeed even +1 Tyranitar. Bronzong’s Gyro Ball at least 2HKOs most fast Tyranitar and can take at least one hit as well. Skarmory is one of the best physical Tyranitar checks in the game as it can phaze it out or use Counter on its attacks, but must watch out for Taunt. All of these must watch out for Fire Blast from the mixed set or boosted attacks from the Dragon Dance set.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Most Water-types can at least take a hit or two and retaliate with strong Water-type attacks. Suicune, Gyarados, Kingdra, Ludicolo, Qwilfish, and Empoleon hit Tyranitar hard. However, all need to be careful. Suicune, Gyarados, Kingdra do not enjoy sand while offensive sets can only take so many hits from Tyranitar. Gyarados and Empoleon need to watch out for Stone Edge and Superpower or Earthquake, respectively. Tyranitar’s special defense boost and potential Passho Berry can stymie attempts to break through with special Water-type attacks, but should Kingdra or Ludicolo change the weather, it can break through Tyranitar even with a Passho Berry.</p> <p><strong>Super-Effective coverage: Tyranitar has many weaknesses and most Pokemon can hit it super-effectively. Notably, Gengar and Latias can be trapped by Tyranitar, but Gengar outspeeds and can OHKO all but the bulkiest sets with Focus Blast while Latias hits it hard with Surf or Grass Knot. Flygon, Zapdos, and Infernape all can gain momentum with U-turn. Jirachi without Iron Head typically has Grass Knot to hit Tyranitar hard with, while Celebi can OHKO it with a boosted Leaf Storm or 2HKO with Grass Knot. Opposing Tyranitar can OHKO it with Superpower, Rotom-A can hit hard with Hidden Power Fighting, Hydro Pump, and Leaf Storm, while Heatran can 3HKO it with Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Status: Tyranitar typically can’t afford Rest and thus is very vulnerable to status, especially Toxic Spikes. Slower sets without Lum Berry can get burned by Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-A and Heatran. Paralysis from Clefable, Latias, Blissey, and Jirachi can ruin Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Zapdos and defensive Latias also sometimes carry Toxic that heavily weakens Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Tyranitar rarely carries Leftovers and is vulnerable to all three entry hazards. Spikes hamper Tyranitar, as it can be put in range of attacks like Starmie’s Hydro Pump and Latias’s Draco Meteor. Toxic Spikes are particularly debilitating for Tyranitar, as it typically can only cure poison with a Lum Berry.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>It may seem odd to use a Choice Scarf on such a slow Pokemon, but Tyranitar's great stat spread makes it a superior user of Choice Scarf. 61 base Speed gives it the ability to outspeed Pokemon with 115 base Speed and below, even with a positive nature, which allows it to outspeed notable foes such as Starmie, Azelf, Latias, and Gengar.</p> <p>Crunch and Pursuit form the core of Tyranitar’s niche, as with the additional Speed, it can checkmate frail Dark-weak foes such as Gengar and Starmie and eliminate them without fail. For example, Pursuit eliminates Gengar guaranteed after two rounds of Stealth Rock damage before it can OHKO Tyranitar with Focus Blast. Tyranitar can also take advantage of weaker special attackers even if it is slower; Choice Scarf Rotom-A only 4HKOs bulkless Tyranitar with Thunderbolt and gets 2HKOed with Pursuit or OHKOed if it switches out. Crunch exploits bulkier Dark-weak Pokemon trying to stay in and damage Tyranitar, such as defensive Rotom-A, Latias, Starmie, and Celebi. Superpower and Earthquake complete its coverage, hitting Steel-types such as Lucario and Empoleon hard. Superpower OHKOs opposing Tyranitar and 2HKOs Clefable and Blissey, while Earthquake OHKOs Heatran more reliably and 2HKOs most Jirachi.</p> <p>The last moveslot is Tyranitar’s main utility option. Stone Edge heavily damages prominent Flying-weak foes such as Zapdos, Gyarados, and Dragonite, OHKOing even bulky versions after Stealth Rock. Ice Beam provides crucial coverage on Gliscor and Breloom while still OHKOing Dragonite. Ice Punch can also be used, but since both Gliscor and Breloom are more physically bulky, Ice Beam often can do more damage. Tyranitar can also drop the last attack altogether and use a variety of non-attacking moves. Stealth Rock is the most prominent option, as Tyranitar can set up the entry hazard quickly on predicted switches to maximize residual damage. Should Tyranitar lead, it can uniquely set up Stealth Rock on Azelf and other anti-entry hazard leads besides Aerodactyl without worrying about being hit by Taunt. Other option include status such as Thunder Wave and Toxic or even Taunt itself. Note that Tyranitar only needs Crunch and Pursuit to function, so bluffing the threat of Superpower and Earthquake can be enough to have two utility options in the last two moveslots.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature are required to outspeed positive-natured base 115 Pokemon and are crucial to this set's performance. Should Tyranitar use Ice Beam, it should use a Hasty nature. 60 Special Attack EVs is enough to OHKO max HP Gliscor.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tyranitar typically tries to come in early in the game to remove prominent threats and set up sand. Should Tyranitar lead, it can try to get Stealth Rock immediately, but should be done cautiously as this can be predictable and forces Tyranitar to switch. Tyranitar has the unique niche of being a bulkier revenge killer; it can survive a boosted special hit or two to take down threats such as offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Choice Specs Latias, and Starmie. However, Tyranitar prefers to switch in with relative safety and force the opponent into a potential Pursuit trap, as it can be overwhelmed if needed to trap multiple threats. This Tyranitar is easy to set up on, especially if it is locked into Pursuit. Beware of Pursuit trapping around dangerous set-up sweepers such as Swords Dance Lucario, Dragon Dance Gyarados, Substitute Breloom, and Substitute Machamp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Tyranitar is a staple of DPP OU and has many viable partners, as it is one of the best checks to fast Dark-weak attackers. On more defensive teams, Tyranitar is often the fastest Pokemon on the team, sets up sand, and helps limit Gengar and offensive Latias. Tyranitar is part of the prominent big 5 archetype with Clefable, defensive Latias, Skarmory, and offensive Jirachi alongside a bulky Ground-type such as Hippowdon, Gliscor, Quagsire, or Donphan. Clefable is a fantastic partner for Tyranitar, as alongside defensive Latias, they check most of the special threats in the tier. Clefable’s Knock Off combined with sand helps wear down everything not immune to it, especially Suicune, Latias, and Starmie. Tyranitar can also absorb Heatran’s Explosion in a pinch and Trick from Latias and Rotom-A. Latias resists everything Tyranitar is weak to besides Bug- and Steel-type moves and is an excellent check to Breloom and Water-types trying to take advantage of Tyranitar. Skarmory and its Spikes are great partners to Tyranitar as they heighten residual damage. Tyranitar's Pursuit traps Starmie trying to Rapid Spin away entry hazards while it answers Fire- and Electric-types such as Heatran, Rotom-A, and Zapdos. Skarmory provides an answer to physical set-up sweepers such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Dragonite, Dragon Dance Tyranitar that outspeed, or speed tie in Dragon Dance Tyranitar's case, and OHKO Tyranitar. Offensive Jirachi takes advantage of its speed, sand, and Spikes to wear down the opponent with Iron Head and its coverage. Ground-types provide back up to strong physical attackers and Electric-types. Hippowdon helps Skarmory with Dragon Dance sweepers and sets up Stealth Rock; specially defensive Gliscor can help with mixed Flygon, Fighting-types such as Lucario and Breloom, and enjoys fast offensive special types eliminated; Quagsire's access to Water Absorb, anti set-up moves such as Encore and Haze, and bulk allow it to uniquely answer both rain sweepers and physical attackers; and Donphan can use Rapid Spin and also helps with Dragon Dance sweepers. Other defensive teammates can take advantage of what Tyranitar provides. Forretress sets up Spikes and appreciates Pursuit trapping support to Rapid Spin more easily. Defensive Jirachi enjoys sand helping it use Iron Head to wear down foes, appreciates Tyranitar answering Rotom-A and Gengar who like to burn it, and provides a strong answer to offensive Latias. Rotom-A itself assists against Fighting-types such as Machamp and helps to block Rapid Spin. It enjoys not having to worry about Gengar or Choice Scarf Rotom-A hitting it with Shadow Ball. Blissey is another option to absorb special attacks and set up Stealth Rock. Other common defensive Pokemon such as Bronzong, Nidoqueen, Starmie, Cresselia, physically defensive Zapdos, and defensive Swampert can fit well with Choice Scarf Tyranitar.</p> <p>Tyranitar also can fit on more offensive teams trying to bypass frail Ghost-types. As Tyranitar is easy to wall with many Steel-types should it lock into Crunch or Pursuit, Magnezone is a nice partner to trap Skarmory, Jirachi, Scizor, and Forretress. Swords Dance Gliscor and Mamoswine also appreciates the dual trapping that Tyranitar and Magnezone can provide while giving important defensive utility. Many Pokemon can take advantage of Tyranitar Pursuit trapping Latias, Starmie, Rotom-A, and Gengar. Fighting-types such as Infernape, Breloom, and Machamp, set-up sweepers such as Gyarados and especially Lucario, and attackers who appreciate entry hazards such as mixed Flygon and Gengar enjoy Choice Scarf Tyranitar.</p> "

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With Dragon Dance, Tyranitar has the potential to sweep teams after just a single turn of set up, which is easy to obtain due to Tyranitar's ability to force out many foes and its overall bulk. Tyranitar’s main option is Crunch, which has good neutral coverage on the tier and is very strong at +1. Crunch also allows Tyranitar to fulfill its roles if it can’t sweep, such as combatting defensive Rotom-A and Latias. Stone Edge is another option, as it is Tyranitar’s strongest attack and hits common Pokemon such as Skarmory, Zapdos, and Clefable. Earthquake is an important move on this set because it allows Tyranitar to hit Steel-types such as Metagross, Jirachi, Empoleon, and Heatran for super effective damage while also having great neutral coverage with Crunch and Stone Edge. Aqua Tail is another option to effectively hit Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gliscor, as they typically take Crunch well and can 2HKO back with Earthquake. It also provides a super-effective option on Heatran and opposing Tyranitar.</p> <p>The last option helps to complete Tyranitar’s coverage. Fire Punch is best alongside Crunch and Earthquake or Aqua Tail to best hit Skarmory, Breloom, and Bronzong. Ice Punch is another option, as it OHKOs Gliscor and hits Breloom very hard. Typically, Ice Punch is used alongside Stone Edge and Earthquake to give the best coverage. Taunt is a fantastic option alongside Earthquake and Crunch or Stone Edge, as Tyranitar gets good coverage in two moves and can use Taunt to take advantage of Skarmory and status inducing walls such as Rotom-A and Clefable. Unless it has Taunt or Magnezone support, Tyranitar needs one of Fire Punch or Stone Edge to combat Skarmory.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Jolly nature and maximum Speed is recommended to outspeed Pokemon with base 115 Speed, like Starmie and Raikou, after a single turn of setup. The choice of item will depend both on Tyranitar's teammates and its moveset. Lum Berry is the often the best choice, as it guarantees that Tyranitar's sweep won't be ended by status effects such as paralysis and burn and makes setting up safer against Pokemon such as Rotom-A, Blissey, Clefable, and Heatran. Another great choice is Chople Berry, which prevents Breloom and Infernape from reliably revenge killing Tyranitar with Mach Punch. Tyranitar can also use Chople Berry to soft check Gengar by switching into Shadow Ball and then taking a Focus Blast with relative ease. Shuca Berry is an excellent option for sets with Ice Punch as the last move, as it reduces the number of Pokemon that can revenge kill this set. For example, Flygon's Earthquake will do negligible damage, and Tyranitar will be able to hit it with an Ice Punch and continue its sweep. Shuca Berry will also allow Tyranitar to set up on a defensive Gliscor's Earthquake and other weaker Ground-type attacks. As a bonus, it can serve as a soft check to Dragon Dance Pokemon like opposing Tyranitar and Dragonite that opt to use Earthquake.</p> <p>Tyranitar has some more niche items it can use as well. On teams that can reliably prevent Stealth Rock such as lead Aerodactyl, Focus Sash is another option to survive any one hit from difficult foes such as Choice Scarf Lucario and KO back. Life Orb is destructively powerful and can break the bulkiest of walls, but watch out for residual damage adding up. On the other hand, Leftovers helps to mitigate the residual damage Tyranitar faces. Tyranitar can also use slightly more bulk at the expense of Attack EVs, such as up to around 80 HP EVs, to better withstand attacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Dragon Dance Tyranitar should try to use its bulk to set up on foes it threatens, such as defensive Latias, Heatran, and Rotom-A, especially with a Lum Berry. As it has good coverage and is difficult to OHKO outside of Fighting-type attacks, Tyranitar excels at weakening walls such as Skarmory or Hippowdon both for itself or to allow a teammate to sweep. As Skarmory otherwise can’t damage Tyranitar unless it phazes or uses Counter, Taunt can sometimes end the game immediately if it gets more than one Dragon Dance. Dragon Dance Tyranitar baits predictable ways to take it down, such as choice locked attacks, Trick from Latias or Rotom-A, and priority from Scizor, Infernape, and Breloom. Take advantage of this to set up something else or get a free switch. Tyranitar also does not always have to sweep if it needs to answer a threat, such as offensive Zapdos, Heatran, or Choice Scarf Rotom-A.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Tyranitar is a main stay of the hyper offensive playstyle, as it not only is a massive threat alongside other sweepers, but also provides important defensive utility against special attackers hard to find elsewhere. Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite are prominent partners, as they synergistically take advantage of each other breaking apart defensive cores and weakening Skarmory. Both also resist the Fighting-types that check Tyranitar, such as Choice Scarf Lucario and Machamp. Gyarados can set up on prominent Tyranitar checks such as Swampert and Scizor, while Tyranitar can take down defensive Latias, Rotom-A, and Zapdos. Dragonite, with both mixed and Dragon Dance sets, is one of the best Pokemon in the tier for weakening the Steel- and Water-types that check Tyranitar such as Metagross, Bronzong, Suicune, and Swampert while also setting up on Breloom. Other powerful sweepers such as Agility Metagross, Swords Dance Lucario, offensive Empoleon, offensive Jirachi, and Swords Dance Scizor are strong partners. Offensive Jirachi is an especially good partner, as it can lure in and KO Hippowdon and Swampert with Grass Knot while also answering Breloom and Skarmory with its coverage. Tyranitar enjoys anti set up leads to help prevent entry hazards, espcially Toxic Spikes. Azelf and Aerodactyl are excellent choices to immediately start with Stealth Rock, but other leads such as Choice Scarf Breloom and Choice Scarf Roserade can disable opposing leads with sleep and keep hazards off the field. Should the lead not have Stealth Rock, Metagross with ThunderPunch or Trick + Iron Ball and Heatran are excellent choices to help fend off Skarmory. Both can potentially use Explosion on Ground-types.</p> <p>Most of Tyranitar’s main checks are grounded and it appreciates Spikes to help wear them down. It is one of the more prominent sweepers for Spikes offense teams, as it takes advantage Starmie trying to use Rapid Spin to KO it or set up. Skarmory is the primary setter, as it provides important defensive coverage against prominent checks such as Bronzong and Metagross while also potentially preventing entry hazards with Taunt. Tyranitar can then switch into its Fire- and Electric-type weaknesses and set up Dragon Dance. Froslass is another excellent choice to prevent hazards and set up layers on many leads. Mixed Flygon is another great choice to wear down opposing walls. Rotom-A can help keep entry hazards up while being one of the best switch ins to Fighting-types in the game. Choice Scarf Lucario is one of the best revenge killers in the game to include with Spikes due to Copycat. Lastly, this set performs exceptionally well on teams that use a dual screens lead, because it makes setting up multiple Dragon Dances easier due to the added bulk from the screens, and with all those boosts, stopping a Tyranitar sweep is nearly impossible.</p> "

      {
        "name": "All Purpose",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Tyranitar's impeccable stats, unique typing, monstrous Special Defense in sand, and vast movepool enable it to fulfill many different roles simultaneously. Crunch is a reliable STAB attack that maims Pokemon like Starmie, Rotom-A, Celebi, and Latias for tremendous super effective damage. Most foes that it hits neutrally, like Flygon and offensive Suicune, will still sustain quite a bit of damage. Its chance to lower a foe's Defense is also crucial for breaking defensive Pokemon like Zapdos and Clefable. Payback is an alternative to Crunch on much slower variants, as it usually becomes more powerful, but it has fewer PP and forgoes the chance of a Defense drop. Dark Pulse is another interesting alternative to hit Rotom-A hard even in case of a burn, and it also hits Reflect Starmie for more damage; however, Crunch is almost always better.</p> <p>From there, Tyranitar can use many different moves to accommodate its team's needs. Fire Blast is a fantastic option to hit Skarmory, Breloom, Scizor, and Bronzong for massive damage. In particular, 2HKOing physically defensive Skarmory makes Tyranitar a potent threat against stall builds. As alternatives, Stealth Rock and Ice Beam are great moves. Tyranitar makes fantastic use of Stealth Rock, as its insanely high Special Defense and solid HP actually make it a check to Starmie, despite its weakness to Water-type attacks. In addition, it can put up sand to disrupt Water-types like Suicune and Kingdra, and with Passho Berry it can serve as a soft check to them. Having the ability to keep Stealth Rock up versus Starmie is an incredibly desirable trait, as Starmie is terrifying offensively and also OU's most consistent spinner by far. Ice Beam surprises foes like Gliscor, Flygon, and Dragon Dance Dragonite with an OHKO; it can also hit physically defensive Zapdos for solid super effective damage.</p> <p>Tyranitar is the best Pursuit trapper in OU thanks to its high Attack. Instead of outspeeding foes like the Choice Scarf set does, this set aims to Pursuit using Tyranitar's tremendoes bulk, decimating Psychic- and Ghost-types like Starmie, Rotom-A, Latias, and Gengar on the switch. Tyranitar can also use Pursuit to wear down foes as they switch out, like Clefable, Zapdos, and even Jolteon, Suicune, and Draco Meteor-locked Kingdra. For some teams, however, the threat of Pursuit is enough, and Tyranitar can use moves like Fire Blast and Ice Beam in its place to form more dedicated mixed attacking sets.</p> <p>Stone Edge is Tyranitar's most powerful STAB attack, which hits Gyarados, Dragonite, Zapdos, and Togekiss super effectively. It can also be used to fish for a critical hit against bulkier Pokemon like Clefable, Suicune, and Blissey. Earthquake is a great alternative to reliably cover Nidoqueen, Heatran, Magnezone, Infernape, Calm Mind Jirachi, and Lucario. As a bonus, it can hit Zapdos as it uses Roost, which surprisingly makes a large difference in the matchup. It may be just as effective to use a combination of moves like Crunch + Earthquake versus Zapdos as it is to use Stone Edge, as the latter only has an effective four PP due to Zapdos's ability Pressure. This means that Zapdos may be able to use Roost in succession to reduce Stone Edge's PP. Superpower hits Heatran, opposing Tyranitar, and Lucario for massive damage; it also hits Clefable and Blissey super effectively, often OHKOing the former and coming very close to OHKOing the latter. Using Superpower will make Tyranitar worse off versus Zapdos, however, so it may want to run Ice Beam alongside it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>It's extremely important to note that this Tyranitar set can run a large number of viable EV spreads. Depending on the moveset, it may want more or less Special Attack investment, more Special Defense investment, or even more Speed. The above EV spread has an emphasis on Special Defense, which Tyranitar uses to even further strengthen its effectiveness versus a large variety of special attackers, like Zapdos, Rotom-A, Latias, Starmie, Heatran, Kingdra, and Suicune. 52 Special Attack EVs allow Fire Blast to OHKO uninvested Breloom and significantly improves the move's damage output versus Skarmory. 80 Speed EVs enable Tyranitar to outpace uninvested Skarmory; however, if you use Fire Blast, you may want to invest more Speed at the expense of Attack or Special Defense to let Tyranitar outpace faster Skarmory, Breloom, and Scizor, including taking the attack EVs and investing into maximizing speed. The rest of the EVs are invested into Attack to maximize it given the constraints. If you use Ice Beam and Fire Blast, you may want to invest a bit more EVs in Special Attack to allow Tyranitar to shut down Skarmory and Gliscor more effectively.</p> <p>Passho Berry is what largely enables Tyranitar to turn the tide on all Water-types. There is not a single unboosted Water-type move that OHKOes Tyranitar—not even +1 Gyarados's Waterfall or Choice Band Swampert's Torrent-boosted Waterfall with the Defense drop from a Lonely nature. This item is especially effective versus Rain Dance sweepers like Kingdra and Ludicolo, as Tyranitar can come in on a Hydro Pump, set up sand, and still be relatively healthy. Alternatively, Custap Berry takes advantage of Tyranitar's tremendous bulk, which often enables it to survive two attacks and be within Custap Berry's activation range. This can give it an extra chance to attack or set up Stealth Rock, which Passho Berry often doesn't do. Alternative items like Lum Berry and Chople Berry can be used as well. Lum Berry can help Tyranitar to beat Will-O-Wisp Rotom-A especially with speed investment to outspeed slower defensive Rotom-A, and Chople Berry can be used for Mach Punch Breloom and, more importantly, Focus Blast Gengar. It can often be difficult to justify these options over Passho Berry and Custap Berry, however, as Rotom-A can miss with Will-O-Wisp and often still loses to Tyranitar, and Tyranitar is more reliable versus Gengar with a Choice Scarf.</p> <p>The choice between a Lonely, Adamant, and Brave nature is mostly set dependent. If you're using Fire Blast without Ice Beam, you may want to invest more Speed without lowering Tyranitar's Special Attack with an Adamant nature, so a Lonely nature fits best in these situations. An Adamant nature is best when you don't opt for any special attacks, such as with a moveset like Stealth Rock / Pursuit / Crunch / Earthquake. A Brave nature is a decent alternative to Lonely, reducing Tyranitar's Speed rather than Defense, which is often a good choice; however, a Lonely nature allows Tyranitar to just barely outspeed Clefable, which can be quite significant depending on the team.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switch Tyranitar in on special attackers like Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Latias. When facing Water-type special attackers like Starmie, Kingdra, and Suicune, try to pivot into a Water-resistant teammate before switching into Tyranitar so there's less likelihood of Tyranitar sustaining a Water-type attack as it switches in. If you're using a less expected move like Ice Beam or Fire Blast, keep it concealed until Tyranitar lures the right target in, like Skarmory or Gliscor. If you notice that Rotom-A has Leftovers, it almost certainly has Will-O-Wisp, so try to play around that by switching into a Fire-type Pokemon or a burn absorber like Clefable, Blissey, or Roserade. When you are sure your foe will switch out, Pursuit is very often a great option to wear it down, even against Dark-resistant Pokemon like Heatran and Magnezone.</p> <p>If you're using a Custap Berry, pay close attention to Tyranitar's HP as it gets lower. Be cognizant of entry hazards and how much HP Tyranitar will have after sustaining damage from Stealth Rock and Spikes. Doing so potentially enables Tyranitar to use its Custap Berry after switching in when it wasn't able to prior. Try to familiarize yourself with how much damage Tyranitar takes from an opposing Pokemon's attack to open up the potential for long-term planning with Custap Berry's activation in mind.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar is the quintessential Pokemon that supports all of its teammates rather than the other way around, and it fits on almost any team. However, there are a few Pokemon that work well to support any set this Tyranitar can run. Infernape and Heatran can switch into Will-O-Wisp. Their devastating Fire-type attacks melt Steel-types like Metagross, Bronzong, Jirachi, and Lucario, which all give Tyranitar trouble. Both can also use Grass coverage to wear down bulky Water- and Ground-types like Swampert, Milotic, Hippowdon, and Suicune. Choice Band Infernape can lure in Starmie, Rotom-A, and Latias and use U-turn to get Tyranitar in freely. Heatran can use Magma Storm to trap, cripple, and even remove foes like Swampert, Milotic, and Zapdos. Gyarados often switches into Infernape and Heatran and sustains significant damage from powerful Fire-type attacks, which helps Tyranitar. In return, Tyranitar can trap and remove Starmie, Choice Scarf Rotom-A, and Latias for Infernape and Heatran, as well as wear down Zapdos and Flygon. Its ability Sand Stream also helps keep Suicune, Zapdos, Gyarados, and Milotic in check by interfering with their Leftovers recovery, which Infernape and Heatran appreciate. Gyarados is a great teammate for Tyranitar as well, as it can switch into Earthquake from the likes of Swampert and Flygon and boost its Attack and Speed with Dragon Dance, setting up for a sweep. Tyranitar wears down Zapdos and checks Choice Scarf Rotom-A, Latias, Choice Scarf Heatran, and Starmie for Gyarados. A Starmie of your own can spin entry hazards away to help keep Tyranitar and Flying-types healthy. Starmie also checks Infernape, Water-types, and Ground-types. Zapdos can spread paralysis with Discharge, switch into Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, and threaten bulky Water-types, all of which makes Tyranitar more threatening. Tyranitar's 4x Fighting-type weakness means that Fighting-immune Pokemon like Gengar and Rotom-A pair quite well to ward off most Fighting-types. Latias resists Fighting-, Water-, and Grass-type attacks, while Tyranitar resists Ghost- and Dark-type attacks. Magnezone's ability to trap Skarmory and Scizor enables Tyranitar to drop Fire Blast for Stealth Rock more easily. Jirachi can support Tyranitar in various ways, whether it paralyzes foes with Body Slam, lures in Tyranitar's checks and removes them with coverage moves like Grass Knot and Thunderbolt, or wears down the opposing team with an Iron Head barrage.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With Choice Band, Tyranitar's attacks come off of a massive 604 Attack that can break through even the toughest of the tier's defensive Pokemon. Stone Edge is one of the keys to this set's success. It powers through even frailer resists such as Breloom and can OHKO a significant portion of the metagame. It also packs enough power to easily 2HKO walls such as Skarmory and Forretress. Crunch serves as an accurate secondary attack, and provides neutral coverage on Pokemon that resist Stone Edge, such as Swampert, Bronzong, and Metagross. Unlike the Choice Scarf set, Choice Band Tyranitar's Crunch and Pursuit combination does significantly more damage to special walls and frail offensive Pokemon alike such as Zapdos, Starmie, Latias, Rotom-A, Blissey, and Clefable. Should Tyranitar make the correct read on switching versus staying in, many of these Pokemon are either OHKOed or are so low on health that they struggle to heal up properly.</p> <p>The final slot provides Tyranitar with much-needed type coverage. Superpower hits Blissey, Clefable, opposing Tyranitar, and various Steel-types super effectively; it also hits Breloom and Machamp very hard. Earthquake hits Metagross, Jirachi, and opposing Tyranitar, but is a dangerous move to be locked into. Finally, Fire Punch allows Tyranitar to OHKO Scizor and Forretress, as well as reliably 2HKOing Skarmory and Bronzong. Aqua Tail hits Hippowdon, Gliscor, and opposing Tyranitar hard, as well as providing neutral coverage and a reliable attack.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Running 76 Speed EVs outpaces 0 Speed Skarmory, allowing Tyranitar to 2HKO them with Stone Edge without being impeded by Roost. However, it is somewhat common for Skarmory to run Speed EVs to avoid this exact situation, so it may be beneficial to boost Tyranitar's Speed investment as well. After maximizing Attack, the remaining EVs are placed into HP for maximum bulk.</p> <p>Tyranitar has many other viable EV spreads. Tyranitar can run max speed with no bulk investment to outspeed as much as it can, but is rather frail and is still not very fast. Should Tyranitar want to be in Trick Room, it can use no investment at all and use a spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD. Tyranitar also can use a Brave nature and minimum speed IVs or can run a few additional speed EVs to outspeed Clefable and Empoleon. Tyranitar can use nearly max special defense to better survive Modest Choice Specs Latias Draco Meteor and Gengar's Focus Blast. An example of such as spread is 64 HP / 184 Atk / 252 SpD that survives two Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock and non Life Orb Gengar Focus Blast and Pursuit them.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switch Tyranitar in on special attackers like Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Latias and special walls such as Blissey. Beware of switching directly into Clefable and losing the Choice Band to Knock Off. As Pursuit is much stronger than the Choice Scarf set, it potentially checkmate Pokemon at higher health. It even does good damage to Pokemon that resist it, such as Magnezone and Heatran. If Tyranitar outspeeds a lot of the opposing team, Stone Edge can often rip through multiple Pokemon due to its power. Tyranitar has similar issues to the Choice Scarf set in that it often allows free set-up from foes that resist Pursuit, so watch out for set-up sweepers.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Band Tyranitar fits well on offenses built around Trick Room Bronzong, balanced teams with paralysis support needing an offensive threat, and defensive teams with Rapid Spin to more easily remove Dark-weak foes and facilitate spinning. Offensive Trick Room Bronzong provides Tyranitar with a critical ability to go first and break faster Pokemon. If Bronzong uses Explosion after setting up Trick Room, Tyranitar can often get mulitple KOs with Stone Edge, especially against more frail offenses that cannot survive the power of a Choice Band Stone Edge or Crunch. Magnezone can be helpful here, as it traps Steel-types that resists Stone Edge and Crunch while also removing Skarmory and potentially defensive Jirachi. Other strong partners such as Dragonite, Swampert, Gengar, Gyarados and Choice Specs Latias can switch into Tyranitar's weaknesses and appreciate Magnezone support. Tyranitar also helps support special attackers, as with Pursuit, it can remove Latias, Blissey, and Clefable from play. Offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Starmie, and offensive Empoleon are especially nice partners. As Choice Band Tyranitar and Trick Room Bronzong are fairly self-sufficient, they can fit alongside many offensive threats, such as Breloom, Metagross, Choice Scarf Rotom-A, Heatran, and even Heracross.</p> <p>Due to Tyranitar's power against slower opponents, it can fit effectively alongside extensive paralysis support. Defensive Jirachi, Starmie, defensive Breloom, and defensive Zapdos are quite effective defensive support for Tyranitar. Starmie is especially helpful, as it can safely Rapid Spin away hazards to help keep Tyranitar alive. As Tyranitar itself can struggle to break through bulky Pokemon even with paralysis, it is commonly paired with other slow synergetic offensive Pokemon such as Machamp, Curse Swampert, and Rhyperior. Choice Band Tyranitar also helps to break through difficult threats for defensive teams, such as Calm Mind Clefable and offensive Latias. Good defensive partners such as Bronzong, defensive Celebi,  Gliscor, defensive Heatran, specially defensive Empoleon, and Clefable can be valuable. Defensive Celebi is especially useful, as it can spread paralysis and withstand strong Water-types such as Gyarados, Swampert, and rain sweepers such as Kingdra that threaten Tyranitar.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "TyraniBoah (SubPunch)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>The principle of this set is pretty simple: thanks to its natural bulk, Tyranitar can switch in on a plethora of Pokemon that don't threaten it like Latias, Zapdos without Toxic or Thunder Wave, and Choice-locked Rotom and then set a Subsitute. Tyranitar simultaneously doesn't worry about Pokemon like Clefable and Blissey, since it can use Substitute before they have an opportunity to status it. Behind Subsitute, Tyranitar becomes an enormous threat for bulkier teams. While many of these more defensive teams can usually deal with mixed Tyranitar via smart pivots into faster threats, Substitute totally invalidates this strategy and gives you an important advantage.</p> <p>Focus Punch, even without STAB, will always do respectable damage thanks to its high-Base-Power combined with Tyranitar's high Attack. It allows Tyranitar to hit Clefable, Blissey, and steel-types like Heatran, Scizor, Jirachi, Magnezone, Bronzong, and even Skarmory for great damage. Ice Beam threatens the usual Tyranitar checks like Gliscor, Breloom, and Hippowdon but also hits Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Dragonite and Zapdos. Finally, Crunch gives Tyranitar a powerful STAB attack that enables it to deal with all Latias variants more effectively and hit Psychic- and Ghost-types like Rotom-A, Starmie, Celebi, and Gengar. Flamethrower is an option too if you want to deal with Scizor, Skarmory, Forretress, and Metagross more effectively.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP allows Tyranitar to create a 101 HP Substitute, which means it can't be broken by Clefable's or Blissey's Seismic Toss. 100 Special Attack EVs guarantee Tyranitar will always OHKO Gliscor, 252 HP Dragonite after Stealth Rock, and Breloom after Stealth Rock and three layers of Spikes with Ice Beam, as well as improving your chances against Hippowdon. The rest of the EVs are put in Attack to maximize Tyranitar's power. A Lonely nature is preferred to both preserve Special Attack and Speed and maximize Attack. The Speed is especially important so Tyranitar can create a Substitute before Blissey and Clefable can cripple it.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Using this set is pretty simple; use Tyranitar's bulk to set up a Substitute on Pokemon like Rotom, Clefable, and Blissey, and then utilize its wide coverage to threaten a large portion of the metagame. However, Tyranitar needs to be preserved from status, and it's better if it switches on a Soft-Boiled from Clefable and Blissey, since being paralyzed or hit with Knock Off will reduce its utility. For the same reason, Tyranitar can only be brought in on non-Will-O-Wisp Rotom. If you can predict a switch-in by such a Rotom, it can highly reward you by allowing Tyranitar to create some holes in the opposing team, especially due to Focus Punch's high power and spammable nature thanks to the Subsitute and the rest of Tyranitar's coverage. However, preserving Tyranitar's HP is really important, and you need to set a Substitute only when Tyranitar can safely do enough damage to make it profitable to you. For the same reason, you need to play this Tyranitar set very safely around entry hazards, especially if you do not have any spinners on your team. When Tyranitar is under a Substitute, you don't need to make predictions because your opponent can't afford to do multiple switch-ins before breaking your Substitute. However, making a good prediction (versus an important wincon or a U-turn user for example) can give you a huge advantage in the game. Finally, use Crunch as much as possible early-game, as this keeps your remaining moves a secret, useful to better surprise Pokemon like Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Breloom with Ice Beam or set up Substitute more effectively once the team has been scouted out a bit more.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>The best way to support SubPunch Tyranitar is to give it some opportunities to switch in and set up a Substitute. Powerful special attackers like Heatran, Starmie, Zapdos, Latias, and Calm Mind Jirachi are perfect for this job thanks to their ability to lure Blissey and Clefable onto the field so Tyranitar can set up a Substitute. Magma Storm + Taunt Heatran is particularly effective thanks to its ability to trap Blissey and Clefable and prevent them from inducing status, giving a free Substitute opportunity to Tyranitar. Entry hazard support is also super appreciated for wearing down Tyranitar checks like Hippowdon, Jirachi, and Swampert. In addition, Tyranitar forces a ton of switches to capitalize on hazards thanks to its great coverage and ability to gain momentum. Moreover, by weakening Swampert, Skarmory, Zapdos, and Hippowdon, TyraniBoah gives opportunities to some sweepers like Swords Dance Lucario, Agility Metagross and Trick Room Bronzong. However, keeping entry hazards, and especially Toxic Spikes, away from your side is super important, so a rapid spinner (or at least a Grounded Poison-type Pokemon) is really useful. Finally, Pokemon like Zapdos, Rotom, and Celebi are always nice to wear down bulky Water-types like Suicune, Milotic, and Vaporeon.</p> "

  "Celebi": {
    "overview": "<p>Celebi is one of the better utility Pokemon in the DPP OU metagame. Celebi’s access to reliable recovery, wide range of support moves, and Grass / Psychic typing gives it a unique list of Pokemon it counters. It is notably the best counter in the game to Breloom due to Natural Cure, resistances, and huge bulk and checks most offensive Water-types such as Dragon Dance Gyarados lacking Bounce, Swampert, Empoleon, and Suicune. These openings allow Celebi to take advantage of its wide support movepool with choices such as Thunder Wave, Stealth Rock, Heal Bell, U-Turn, and Perish Song. Celebi also can go on the offensive with boosting moves such as Nasty Plot and Calm Mind, allowing it to set up and take on defensive threats such as Clefable, Jirachi, Heatran, and Skarmory that invalidate defensive Celebi. Celebi also is unique in that nothing in the tier shuts down builds that don't have the tools to deal with it like it does—hyper offensive teams can really struggle against Celebi spreading paralysis and walling everything due to its huge bulk, while some slower defensive teams give Nasty Plot Celebi openings to break down the team with boosted attacks.</p> <p>Celebi, however, is reduced to being niche in DPP OU due to the severe flaws from its typing and competition from Latias. Celebi is grounded and has seven weaknesses—of these, the five of Bug, Dark, Fire, Ice, and Ghost are the most critical. Celebi is 4x weak to U-Turn, meaning Flygon, Jirachi, Infernape, Zapdos, and Scizor can come in and freely gain momentum on Celebi, as even physically bulky Celebi is at least 2HKOed by most U-turn. Celebi's Psychic-typing means it is vulnerable to Pursuit Tyranitar, as it can’t OHKO Tyranitar without a boost. Celebi's other weaknesses open it up to Heatran, boosting Water-types with Ice-type coverage such as Empoleon and Gyarados, Rotom-A, and Gengar. Defensive Celebi also struggles broadly against bulkier teams, as it cannot hurt Clefable and its weak coverage options are otherwise easy to wall. Celebi struggles mightily with entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, but Spikes also neuter its great bulk. Celebi often cannot prevent Skarmory from setting up Spikes, either. Offensive Celebi is both easy to wear down and easy to force out, as it is forced to use Leaf Storm for power due to Clefable, Rotom-A, and other defensive Pokemon not being hit hard by Grass Knot or Energy Ball. Offensive Celebi gives up a lot of its defensive utility, as it relies on its Speed and power to check offensive Water-types and Breloom rather than numerical bulk. Celebi additionally struggles to differentiate itself from Latias, as Latias is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, has much greater offensive prowess, and does not have as many weaknesses as Celebi does while having a similar set of resistances.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Celebi has a ton of other options not especially viable in the DPP OU metagame. One of the more prominent of these is a Calm Mind set with Recover and defensive EVs to act as a win condition. Such a set often struggles to stay on the field, due to being easily forced out by weaknesses and status. Other previous sets such as offensive Life Orb support with Thunder Wave, Leaf Storm, Recover, and another coverage move, any Leech Seed sets, Choice Scarf, and Occa Berry + Stealth Rock leads are not very effective in the modern DPP OU metagame. Celebi generally needs to be either very bulky or fast, as Celebi doesn’t have enough numerical bulk when uninvested to handle boosted Water-types while also struggling against Tyranitar, Toxic Spikes, and various U-Turn users. Offensive Celebi is walled by many dangerous threats with only one coverage move. Leech Seed sets are largely invalidated by Clefable, as Celebi can’t damage it effectively outside of a boosted Leaf Storm. Leech Seed also doesn’t help against U-Turn users that will switch out immediately. Celebi has a good Speed tier and access to Trick and U-Turn, but Celebi’s offensive choices have little utility as well as Leaf Storm forcing Celebi out immediately. Celebi also is vulnerable to Tyranitar’s Pursuit. Celebi in the lead position is very weak to common U-turn leads such as Azelf, Uxie, Gliscor, and Flygon, while the Occa Berry will not save it against Choice Specs Heatran. Celebi without Leftovers struggles with longevity, while Celebi generally needs defensive investment to repeatedly set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Other than these, Celebi has a humongous support movepool—options such as Heal Bell, Perish Song, Rain Dance, Healing Wish, Light Screen, Reflect, Trick Room, Heal Block, and Toxic are all possible either as their own set or in the last slot of the utility set. Celebi has base 100 Attack, access to Swords Dance, and a unique physical movepool including Seed Bomb, Sucker Punch, and Zen Headbutt; however, it is exceedingly weak and can struggle to break through Steel-types even when boosted.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>U-turn revenge killers: Flygon, Scizor, Zapdos, Jirachi, Infernape, Azelf, and Gliscor can freely generate momentum off of Celebi with U-turn due to its 4x weakness to Bug. This debilitating weakness prevents defensive Celebi from staying on the field too long and revenge kills offensive Celebi.</p> <p><strong>Bad Luck: Defensive Celebi can be a magnet for critical hits and secondary status effects. Celebi is very bulky, but does not do a lot of damage, especially if it is not hitting super-effectively. Celebi barely avoids 2HKOs from strong attacks such as offensive Empoleon's Ice Beam or Gyarados +1 Ice Fang, and continuously using Recover to get at serviceable health can put Celebi at risk of being frozen or taken out by a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards: Celebi is weak to Toxic Spikes and easily allows foes such as Skarmory to set up Spikes. The extra residual damage makes it difficult for Celebi to repeatedly switch and wall opponents or set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Despite being able to OHKO Tyranitar with offensive sets or paralyze and 2HKO it with defensive sets, Tyranitar’s Crunch and Pursuit heavily damage Celebi, OHKOing offensive sets without a Colbur Berry after Stealth Rock in sand and 2HKOing defensive sets. Lum Berry Dragon Dance Tyranitar can absorb Thunder Wave and at least 2HKO back with Crunch, while Choice Scarf sets outspeed and checkmate Celebi. Weavile, while being less common, threats Celebi the same way.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Celebi often has to choose between hitting Steel-types not weak to Ground such as Skarmory, Bronzong, and Scizor and hitting Dragon-types. All of these threats take advantage of Celebi: Skarmory 2HKOs offensive Celebi with Brave Bird and sets up Spikes, Bronzong walls Celebi easily, and Scizor OHKOs Celebi with U-Turn. Should Celebi lack either Earth Power or Hidden Power Fire, Steel-types such as Metagross, Jirachi, and Lucario easily take advantage of Celebi especially if it lacks Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Without Hidden Power Ice, Celebi is set up fodder for Latias and Dragonite, although they do not enjoy being paralyzed. Latias can even take one boosted Hidden Power Ice and retaliate with strong attacks. Flygon is particularly dangerous even if it does not take Celebi's attacks well, as U-turn from Choiced sets forces it out and Fire Blast from mixed sets heavily damages it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Despite fearing Earth Power and Thunder Wave, Heatran and Infernape easily OHKO Celebi with Fire-type coverage. Should Celebi lack these moves, they can come in repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Rotom-A and Gengar at least 2HKO Celebi with Shadow Ball and will often outspeed it. Gengar resists Grass-type coverage, while Rotom-A takes little damage from Grass Knot due to its low weight. Neither enjoy paralysis, however.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types Zapdos, Gyarados with Bounce, and Togekiss can 2HKO Celebi easily with their Flying-type attacks or Heat Wave in Zapdos’s case. All of them do not enjoy Thunder Wave, however.</p> <p><strong>Clefable: Clefable doesn’t care about anything defensive Celebi does with the exception of Heal Block and uses Knock Off. It has to be careful of a Meadow Plate +2 Leaf Storm OHKOing, however.</p> <p><strong>Super-effective coverage</strong>: Water-Types such as Gyarados and Suicune often carry Ice-Type moves. While these are usually not powerful enough to KO Celebi outright, they can leave it unable to handle the next threats the opponent may carry.</p> ",

        "name": "Utility",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Celebi's many resistances and bulk allow it to be an effective wall. Beyond obligatory recovery, Celebi is able to support its team, spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave or setting up Stealth Rock. Thunder Wave helps Celebi wall threats effectively, as Grass Knot and Leaf Storm dissuade Ground-types immune to Thunder Wave from switching in. If this is not needed, Celebi is a superb user of Stealth Rock, as it threatens the most common spinner in Starmie. As the main offensive option, Grass Knot is the preferred choice, as it reliably hits many threats hard, such as Gyarados, Tyranitar, Suicune, and Swampert. However, as some threats such as Clefable, Rotom-A, and Gliscor take comparatively little from Grass Knot, Leaf Storm is a powerful alternative, as it doesn't care about weight and provides a strong first hit. Beware of the stat drops forcing Celebi out, however. A much stronger Grass-type attack distinguishes Celebi from Latias, as while Latias's Grass Knot is fairly weak, Celebi's Grass Knot easily OHKOs Swampert, 2HKOs Tyranitar and Suicune, and 3HKOs Gyarados, giving them less time to threaten Celebi offensively.</p> <p>The last slot determines additional coverage and potentially other support moves. The most prominent option is Hidden Power Fire, as it damages Skarmory, Scizor, Forretress, and Roserade and prevents them from setting up with impunity. Hidden Power Ice is another option for 2HKOing Dragonite and Gliscor while also hitting Latias. Both of these options hit Breloom, but Psychic is the best of these, OHKOing frail Breloom and being the best option for Gengar and Machamp. Beware of the poor coverage other with Psychic, however. Another option is to make Celebi a bulky pivot with U-turn, as being able to absorb a hit and then keep momentum with U-turn is another niche it has over Latias. Unfortunately, unlike Baton Pass, U-turn is affected by Pursuit if Celebi is faster than the user, so it should be used on the switch in to chip Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Celebi is required to run a physically defensive set. The Speed investment outspeeds Tyranitar while the remaining EVs are put into HP and Defense. Celebi's niche is its increased physical bulk over Latias, and needs to have nearly maximum investment to have a noticeable impact. With this investment, Celebi is extraordinarily bulky—unlike Latias, it survives 2 Ice Fang from +1 Gyarados, +1 Dragon Dance Tyranitar Crunch after Stealth Rock, and +2 Lucario Crunch 50% of the time after Stealth Rock. The bulk also lets Celebi survive U-turn more comfortably and continuously absorb Breloom's attacks, even while asleep. It thus needs to Recover less often, making it less vulnerable to critical hits as it tries to heal.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Celebi should generally only switch into threats it walls, such as Gyarados lacking Bounce, Swampert, and Breloom, and use its utility move such as Thunder Wave or Stealth Rock if the team needs to set it up. Celebi can more reliably switch into Gyarados and Swampert than Latias, as it has Natural to cure a potential freeze from Ice-type attacks. Celebi can also switch in an emergency, such as against boosted Lucario and Tyranitar to live the boosted hit and mitigate the threat. Keep Celebi far away from Pokemon setting up entry hazards, Clefable, and offensive Pokemon with U-turn. However, against more hyper offense teams that lack these options, Celebi is restrictive to play against, as it can come in repeatedly to wall even boosted threats and spread paralysis. With U-turn, Celebi can come in more often, as it generates momentum on its checks and counters, especially against status conditions. Celebi can take Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, or Toxic and then U-turn rid itself of paralysis, burn, or poison with Natural Cure.</p> <p>Avoid trying to use Recover too much, as continuous healing on an attack such as Empoleon's Ice Beam can lead to Celebi getting frozen or faint to a critical hit. Celebi is not as weak to Pursuit Tyranitar as other Psychic-types due to its bulk and ability to 2HKO Tyranitar with Grass Knot, but still should be careful against Tyranitar, as Crunch 2HKOs without a boost and Choice Band Crunch will put Celebi at very low health.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Celebi requires extensive support to function without being outclassed by defensive Latias, as Celebi generally occupies the same niche. Celebi only fits on defensive teams, as its lack of offensive pressure and exploitable weaknesses force a large support network. To counteract Toxic Spikes, Celebi needs either a spinner such as Forretress, Starmie, and Tentacruel or a grounded Poison-type to absorb Toxic Spikes, such as Nidoqueen and Tentacruel due to Roserade’s poor fit. Forretress is especially helpful, as it can set up Spikes and Celebi assists against sweepers trying to take advantage of it. Celebi also supports Leftovers Heatran well, as they resist a huge number of types in the game between the two of them including all of their respective weaknesses. Heatran also threatens entry hazard setters such as Skarmory and Forretress while being a strong Jirachi counter. Heatran and Starmie fit well together in a Fire-Water-Grass core by Rapid Spinning away Spikes and also spreading paralysis. Celebi appreciates back up answers to special threats, as offensive Water-types can score a critical hit or freeze as it tries to heal off their attacks. Clefable and Blissey help in this regard. Celebi also enjoys help against opposing Clefable, as it switches into every option it has and uses Knock Off or sets up with Calm Mind. Choice Band Tyranitar and one’s own Clefable are sufficient for this.</p> <p>Celebi does appreciate Magnezone support, however, it is often difficult to fit all of the pieces needed to support Celebi alongside Magnezone without being vulnerable to Roserade. Generally, Latias fits better alongside Magnezone. Other stall stalwarts such as Wish + Protect Jirachi, RestTalk Gyarados, Gliscor, Leftovers Bronzong, Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Skarmory work as teammates, as they provide additional defensive support and appreciate the back up against strong physical sweepers Celebi provides.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Celebi has a unique niche as a boosting Grass-type with Nasty Plot, allowing it to take advantage of its resistances to go on the offensive. Nasty Plot compliments it well, as it doesn't have a lot of longevity and needs as much power as it can get. The STAB move typically comes down to the rest of the team. Leaf Storm is the preferred move with Nasty Plot; despite resetting Nasty Plot, the power is needed to have a chance to OHKO Clefable. Leaf Storm also can break through utility and defensive Tyranitar, while even soft resists such as offensive Latias take a lot of damage from a +2 Leaf Storm. Grass Knot and Psychic are more reliable options, but Grass Knot does not damage Clefable and Rotom-A effectively, while Psychic is resisted by much of the tier and gives Tyranitar free entry.</p> <p>Earth Power is critical for offensive Celebi, as it OHKOs Heatran after a boost and heavily damages prominent Ground-weak Pokemon such as Jirachi, Metagross, Tyranitar (should Celebi have Psychic), and Lucario. The final move completes Celebi’s coverage: Hidden Power Ice is the main option as it has perfect coverage outside of Bronzong and hits Latias and Dragonite hard while OHKOing Flygon without reducing its Special Attack. Hidden Power Fire is also helpful for hitting Steel-types neutral to Ground hard, such as Skarmory, Scizor, and Bronzong. However, beware of the lower Speed IV needed, causing it to tie with max Speed Rotom-A and always be outsped by max Speed Zapdos, Jirachi, and Flygon. Celebi can also run Recover over the Hidden Power. Celebi loses super effective coverage on Breloom unless it uses Psychic should it go down this route, however.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Celebi generally needs all the power it can get, and a simple max Special Attack, max Speed Modest EV spread emphasizes this. This gives Celebi a desirably speed tier—as offensive Celebi checks threats with its Speed and power, outspeeding all variants of Suicune, Heatran, Rotom-A, and Gyarados allows it to hit hard before taking damage. The Modest nature also gives Celebi the best chance to OHKO Clefable at +2, OHKO Dragon Dance Gyarados after Stealth Rock and Suicune after a Calm Mind at +0, and OHKO max HP Heatran with Earth Power at +0. Timid is also possible to outspeed as much as possible, including Gliscor before it can U-Turn, at least tie with max Speed Zapdos, Jirachi, and Flygon, and outspeed Roserade and Lucario. Celebi can invest around 88 HP EVs to survive Choice Scarf Tyranitar’s Crunch after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>There are many different possible item choices for this Celebi. As Celebi is vulnerable to many types of residual damage, Leftovers gives it the maximum amount of chances to fire off strong attacks. This is especially important against defensive teams, as once Celebi sets up a Nasty Plot, the opponent can pivot around to wear it down. If Celebi uses Leaf Storm into a Latias or Jirachi, it may be too weak to set up another Nasty Plot. However, Celebi has no chance to OHKO Clefable without a boosting item at +2, while Meadow Plate gives it an 87.5% chance to do so. It also maximizes the chance to OHKO utility Tyranitar after Stealth Rock at +0, while even resists such as specially defensive Jirachi and defensive Latias can be 2HKOed by +4 into +2 Leaf Storm with Meadow Plate. However, Celebi is quite vulnerable to Choice Scarf Tyranitar on defensive teams; Colbur Berry variants easily absorb its Crunch and OHKOs back with +0 Leaf Storm after two rounds Stealth Rock. Other resistance berries such as Occa Berry for Heatran and Infernape as well as Kasib Berry for Rotom-A and Gengar are possible, but are more niche.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>How this Celebi is used depends on the match-up; against offensive teams, Celebi rarely gets to set up and checks offensive Water-types, Breloom, and Lucario. Celebi needs to be close to full HP to check these, however, so keeping it healthy before this purpose is critical. It also is easily forced out both after it uses Leaf Storm and by super effective coverage such as from Flygon, Rotom-A, and Heatran or U-turn from various revenge killers.</p> <p>Against more defensive teams, leverage the expectation that Celebi is defensive to set up a Nasty Plot. Due to Celebi’s weakness to entry hazards and especially Toxic Spikes, it should be brought in early against walls that don’t threaten it like Milotic and defensive Breloom. Opponents will often send in Clefable or Skarmory to set up hazards or use Knock Off on Celebi due the defensive set’s passivity, giving an opportunity to attack. Be careful about when to use Leaf Storm, as Celebi’s coverage hits many common Leaf Storm answers such as Latias, Skarmory, and Jirachi very hard and more importantly doesn’t lower its stats. Against sturdier special walls such as Blissey, Celebi should set up to +4 or +6 before attacking—a +4 into +2 Leaf Storm KOs Blissey after Stealth Rock with a Meadow Plate while +6 OHKOs outright. With Recover, Celebi can be more flexible when to come in, but beware of Clefable’s Encore as Psychic only OHKOs at +6.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Celebi generally is used with on teams with weak answers to offensive Water-types that can afford Celebi’s flaws. The more prominent of these is on Magnezone offenses, as Magnezone can trap Bronzong and Skarmory, allowing Celebi to freely run Hidden Power Ice. Celebi also appreciates other common choices on these teams; offensive Trick Room Bronzong teams typically struggle against Water-types and Breloom, giving Celebi an easy switch in. Gengar gives another answer to Breloom, as this Celebi doesn’t absorb its hits as well and can be 2HKOed by Focus Punch. Choice Scarf Flygon can revenge kill threats that set up on a -2 Celebi, such as Dragonite. In return, Choice Scarf revenge killers with U-turn such as opposing Flygon struggle with Trick Room Bronzong while Choice Band Tyranitar can help break through defensive teams. Offensive Heatran is an excellent partner, as it break through bulky Steel-types such as Skarmory, Bronzong, and Jirachi while Celebi resists all of its weakness. Swampert also appreciates Magnezone and supports Celebi, as it can tank hits from Tyranitar and Jirachi as well as resist Heatran’s Fire-type coverage. Heatran and Swampert can potentially form a Fire-Water-Grass core alongside Celebi.</p> <p>Celebi fits on hyper offense teams due to these teams struggling against offensive Calm Mind Suicune and Dragon Dance Gyarados, but Leaf Storm can be a huge momentum sink. With Recover, Celebi appreciates partners that maximize its longevity, such as Toxic Spikes absorbers such as Nidoqueen and counters to Choice Scarf Flygon such as Milotic and Skarmory.</p> "

  "Ludicolo": {
    "overview": "<p>Ludicolo is a very dangerous Pokemon to face in the rain. It has solid Special Attack, allowing it to be a fearsome sweeper. It also has very good special bulk, allowing it to take special hits well. Even its Attack is decent, meaning it can surprise many of its counters with either Focus Punch on a special set, or by going all out with a Swords Dance set. Being able to handle almost all Water-types is not something many Pokemon can boast, so Ludicolo makes a great option for any Rain Dance team.</p> <p>Ludicolo can't cover everything in one set and so will always have problems with some Pokemon; however, with adequate support, it can get past these barriers and be a menace to your opponent's team. Its ability Swift Swim means almost no Pokemon, barring Choice Scarf users, can outspeed it, helping it sweep even more easily.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ludicolo could run a Choice Specs set; however, in the rain, where every rain turn is precious, this is not the best idea. Thunder Punch could be used for a powerful hit on Gyarados on the Swords Dance set; however, losing Ice Punch would make you weak to Dragon- and Grass-types, and not running Swords Dance is not an option, due to Ludicolo's low Attack stat. Giga Drain is another option for a Grass-type attack which can also recover some of your health, but the loss of Base Power makes it a much lesser option. Ludicolo could use Zen Headbutt to hit Toxicroak, but it is very rarely seen in OU. Focus Blast hits some Steel-types hard, but Surf hits most hard enough and if you want a Fighting-type attack, you're better off with Focus Punch, as that can deal with Blissey. Ludicolo can use Fake Out, but this has limited use.</p> <p>Ludicolo has access to recovery in Synthesis, but it only heals 1/4 in rain so it isn't a good option. Ludicolo can use Substitute to ease prediction or in combination with Focus Punch; however, this takes up a valuable moveslot, which there are better options for.</p> <p>209 Speed (132 Speed EVs) should be a minimum on offensive sets to outspeed +1 positive natured Heatran in the rain. 225 Speed (196 Speed EVs) is usually best to outrun +1 neutral natured base 100s, but maxing Speed is also fine to Speed tie with other base 70 Speed Pokemon outside of rain, such as Breloom and Metagross (although they rarely run maximum Speed).</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Blissey easily handles special attacking Ludicolo without Focus Punch, thanks to its enormous HP stat and high Special Defense. Snorlax similarly does very well if Ludicolo lacks Focus Punch, but needs Rest if it wants to continuously switch in. Tentacruel laughs at all sets except Swords Dance thanks to its high Special Defense and STAB Poison-type attacks to take care of Ludicolo. Unlike other special walls, it actually resists Focus Punch, which helps it counter Ludicolo even more. Celebi is 2HKOed by Ice Beam, but as long as it doesn't switch in on that, it can handle any Ludicolo without the very rare Hidden Power Bug. Thunder Wave will make the sweeping Ludicolo sets practically useless. Cresselia can take its attacks well and effectively stop its sweep with Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Abomasnow laughs at almost anything Ludicolo can throw at it, while clearing the rain. Ludicolo can Focus Punch it on the switch or 2HKO most variations with Hidden Power Bug, but these aren't used that often, especially the latter being very rare. Abomasnow's Grass-typing means it's unaffected by Leech Seed, while its high Special Defense lets it take Ludicolo's attacks well.</p> <p>For the Swords Dance set, Skarmory can easily take it on by either Whirlwinding any Swords Dances it has netted or just killing it off with Brave Bird. Cresselia can wear it down with Ice Beam and sponge its hits by setting up a Reflect. Bulky Gyarados can take it on thanks to Intimidate. If it runs Bounce, it will easily OHKO Ludicolo or can just finish off a weakened one with Stone Edge. It can also cripple it with Thunder Wave. Dusknoir and Spiritomb are bulky enough to handle a Swords Danced Waterfall and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Toxicroak may be UU and so rare in OU, but it can do very well since it is immune to Water-type attacks, due to its Dry Skin ability, and is also resistant to Grass-type attacks. It can also take an Ice Beam and OHKO with STAB Poison-type attacks or often with its STAB Life Orb Cross Chop, with Stealth Rock in play.</p> ",

        "name": "Rain Dance Special Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Ludicolo is an amazing special sweeper in the rain, not having trouble with the bulky Water-types that populate OU, unlike most other special Swift Swim sweepers. Surf is your main STAB attack in the rain and a truly terrifying one at that, always OHKOing the standard 248 HP / min SpD Scizor with Stealth Rock in play and hitting almost everything that doesn't resist it for at least a 2HKO. A Grass-type STAB helps deal with most bulky Water-types; the choice of Grass Knot or Energy Ball comes down to how much trouble you have with Vaporeon. If you don't have much trouble with it, Grass Knot is preferred as it hits almost all other bulky Water-types harder than Energy Ball and manages a 2HKO on bulky Gyarados, even without Stealth Rock. However, if you have a lot of trouble with Vaporeon, then Energy Ball is preferred as it still hits most bulky Water-types hard enough, but unlike Grass Knot, it does enough damage to Vaporeon so that it can't stall you out by using Wish + Protect as Life Orb recoil slowly weakens you. Ice Beam hits the Dragon- and Grass-types that resist the Water- and Grass-type combination super effectively. It also hits Flying-types super effectively, but it must be noted that a neutral Surf in the rain is stronger than a 2x super effective Ice Beam.</p> <p>The last slot is the most arguable when it comes to what to use. Rain Dance is usually the preferred option as you can never have too many Pokemon with Rain Dance on a Rain Dance team, and Ludicolo has the special bulk to set it up. Focus Punch is a great alternative, though, since with a Rash nature and 60 Atk EVs, Focus Punch + Surf in the rain and Stealth Rock damage will always take out 24 HP / 232 SpD Calm Blissey, relieving Ludicolo of what is usually the biggest problem this set faces. Other useful options for this slot are Hidden Power Electric and Hidden Power Bug. Hidden Power Electric always OHKOes 4 HP versions of Gyarados, and with Stealth Rock, the same goes for bulky versions, making it particularly useful if running Energy Ball rather than Grass Knot. Hidden Power Bug has a high chance to OHKO the standard 252 HP Celebi with Stealth Rock support, whereas Ice Beam can only muster a 2HKO. When running Hidden Power Bug, use 56 HP / 252 SpA / 200 Spe since the Speed drop from running Hidden Power Bug would otherwise mean you wouldn't outrun +1 neutral natured base 100s. Hydro Pump can be used over Surf since the extra power secures OHKOs on 252 HP Togekiss, 252 HP Metagross, specially defensive Forretress, and specially defensive Skarmory for example (all with Stealth Rock support). However, the accuracy loss makes it less appealing than Surf, which still has a lot of power in the rain.</p> <p>If you're having trouble choosing between Grass Knot and Energy Ball, here are some damage calculations to help you:</p> <ul> <li>Grass Knot vs. maximum HP Suicune: 79.2% - 94.1% <li>Grass Knot vs. 188 HP Vaporeon: 51.3% - 60.7%</li> <li>Grass Knot vs. 156 HP Gyarados: 58.6% - 69.2%</li> <li>Energy Ball vs. maximum HP Suicune: 63.9% - 75.7%</li> <li>Energy Ball vs. 188 HP Vaporeon: 67.4% - 79.5%</li> <li>Energy Ball vs. 156 HP Gyarados: 39.2% - 46.5%</li> </ul> <p>A Modest nature and 196 Speed EVs reaches 225 Speed which means that in the rain, Ludicolo will outspeed neutral natured +1 base 100s. You could just max your Speed as this will at worst result in a Speed tie with neutral Breloom and Metagross outside the rain. When it is raining, however, you will outspeed 176 Speed EV +1 positive base 100s, but the extra bulk is usually more useful. Timid nature can be used since when it is raining, it allows Ludicolo to outspeed +1 positive base 100s and +1 +Speed Infernape, while outside of rain, Ludicolo will outspeed Jolly Tyranitar, neutral natured Mamoswine and Togekiss, and neutral natured Gyarados (or +2 Gyarados in rain). However, the loss of power will make it a lot harder for Ludicolo to deal with some of the bulkier Pokemon. Swift Swim is the obvious ability since this set aims to sweep in the rain where Swift Swim doubles its Speed. Life Orb is used since the extra power it provides helps against a multitude of Pokemon, getting OHKOs and 2HKOs it otherwise wouldn't get, but Damp Rock can be used if you have Rain Dance and want more Rain Dance turns.</p> <p>Since this set aims to sweep in the rain, its teammates should either set up Rain Dance to support it or also try and sweep in the rain. Kingdra is a great partner to Ludicolo since the mixed set can 2HKO both Blissey and Snorlax (with a rain boosted Waterfall) who this set can't deal with if it lacks Focus Punch. Kingdra can also use Hidden Power Electric or Signal Beam in place of Rain Dance for Gyarados and Celebi, respectively, since both of them can trouble Ludicolo. Faster Kingdra sets can also aid Ludicolo by taking out some of the faster Choice Scarf users which trouble Ludicolo, such as Gengar. Kabutops and Qwilfish are both very effective partners to Ludicolo since they both OHKO Blissey and Snorlax with a +2 Waterfall in the rain. A few other things they can do to help Ludicolo are dealing with Celebi with X-Scissor and Poison Jab respectively, and hitting Tentacruel hard with Stone Edge in Kabutops' case or Exploding on it if need be in Qwilfish's case. Also, their secondary STAB attacks are very helpful for taking care of Abomasnow who walls Ludicolo to no end, unless Ludicolo can predict the switch in and Focus Punch. Qwilfish's high Speed also allows it to deal with Choice Scarf users such as Gengar, who Ludicolo can't outspeed, OHKOing it 100% of the time with a rain boosted Waterfall. Both Gorebyss and Omastar can make decent partners, especially if this set has Focus Punch, since although they are both slow, they have a lot more power than Ludicolo, and therefore with Blissey out of the way, they can proceed to tear into the opposing team.</p> <p>The Rain Dance supporters who support Ludicolo best are simply those who can set it up most reliably and also get rid of Abomasnow and Tyranitar whose weather changing abilities disrupt Ludicolo. Hippowdon also changes the weather, but Ludicolo can use Surf or Grass Knot to kill it. Scizor is very effective since it has a STAB Bullet Punch to deal with the aforementioned Pokemon, can take care of Celebi with U-turn, and can also carry Brick Break or Superpower if need be for Blissey and Snorlax. Its many useful resistances allow it to set up Rain Dance for Ludicolo with relative ease. Although they are not common, Scizor is immune to the Poison-type moves that Ludicolo is weak to. Bronzong is probably the most reliable bulky Rain Dance set-upper there is so it makes a great partner to Ludicolo. It also has access to Explosion, which could help Ludicolo if Bronzong manages to Explode on one of the Pokemon who trouble Ludicolo. As a bonus, it also resists Ludicolo's Flying-type weakness and is immune to its Poison-type one, which may come in useful at times. Swampert is an effective partner since it is a great counter to Tyranitar and is also very reliable at setting up Rain Dance. It is also immune to Electric-type attacks, which while Ludicolo isn't weak to them, are still commonly aimed at it. Jirachi can also make an effective partner since it has many useful resistances and above average Speed, which allows it to set up Rain Dance quite easily and it also has a STAB Iron Head, which can take care of both Abomasnow and Tyranitar, assuming you get the 60% of a flinch. In the rain, Jirachi can also use 100% accurate Thunders with a 60% paralysis chance to slow down Choice Scarf users.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Ludicolo may only have a base 70 Attack stat, but since the last thing your opponent will expect is a physical Ludicolo, this set can do some major damage. The idea is to switch into something like Swampert, who will almost certainly switch, and then Swords Dance on the switch. You may even be able to get two Swords Dances in if your opponent switches to Blissey. Waterfall is a powerful STAB attack, having 180 Base Power in the rain; it will easily OHKO Blissey after a Swords Dance in the rain, and with Stealth Rock up, 168 HP / 120 Def Snorlax always falls too. Seed Bomb is your other STAB, which hits Water-types hard, always OHKOing even the most defensive of Vaporeon at +2, and offensive Suicune too. It also does 80.2% - 95% to 252 HP / 252 Def Bold Suicune and 86.9% - 102.9% to 12 HP / 12 Def Empoleon, meaning you can sometimes OHKO them at +2 too. Ice Punch takes up the last slot to hit the Dragon- and Grass-types, which resist the Water- and Grass-type combination, hard.</p> <p>Adamant with maximum Attack is needed, since with only a base 70 Attack stat, Ludicolo needs all the investment it can get. Similar to the OU Offensive Rain (Special) set, 196 Speed EVs are used to outspeed +1 neutral base 100s in the rain with the rest put in HP to take hits better, but you can just use maximum Speed should you want to, at worst, Speed tie with neutral Breloom and Metagross outside the rain, and when it is raining, outspeeding 176 Speed EVs +1 positive base 100s, but the extra bulk is usually preferred. A Jolly nature is not a good option since although the extra Speed may come in handy at times, the loss of Attack badly hurts. Swift Swim is the chosen ability since this set aims to sweep in the rain. Life Orb is the best item since this set needs all the power it can get, and although Leftovers for extra recovery or Lum Berry to take status may be useful on rare occasions, they are nowhere near as useful as the extra power of Life Orb.</p> <p>Since this set aims to sweep in the rain, the best partners are either those who set up Rain Dance or can take advantage of it. For Swift Swim sweepers, special attacking ones are the best options for partners since this set can OHKO Blissey at +2 and with the best special wall out of the way, Kingdra, Omastar, and Gorebyss will have a much easier time sweeping. They can also help Ludicolo out by taking care of some of the physical walls which trouble Swords Dance Ludicolo, such as Skarmory. Special Kingdra is the best option out of those three since its higher Speed means it can't so easily be revenged by Choice Scarf users and opposing Swift Swim Kingdra. All three of the aforementioned Pokemon can run Hidden Power Electric to take care of Gyarados, who annoys this Ludicolo set by lowering its Attack through Intimidate. Swords Dance Kabutops and Qwilfish are also both great partners since Ludicolo is great at getting rid of bulky Water-types which trouble Qwilfish and also Kabutops if it can't get off a Swords Dance. Also, using two Swords Dance Pokemon can easily carve a gaping hole into your opponent's team for another Swift Swim sweeper to take advantage of.</p> <p>The best Rain Dance supporters to Ludicolo are those which can set it up reliably and also take care of some of the weather changing Pokemon who stop Ludicolo's sweep. Jirachi and Scizor both offer useful resistances and have STAB Steel-type moves in Iron Head and Bullet Punch, respectively, which will deal with both Abomasnow and Tyranitar. Jirachi can also use Thunder to OHKO Gyarados, whose Intimidate ability annoys Ludicolo. Bronzong is one of the most reliable Pokemon to set up Rain Dance mid-game so it makes an amazing partner to Ludicolo. Its Explosion may also help Ludicolo if it can Explode on a troublesome Pokemon, such as Gyarados. Starmie can make a nice partner since it has the Defense to take on most Gyarados and can then take it out with Thunder. It can also run Rapid Spin as Toxic Spikes will badly hinder Ludicolo's ability to sweep. Electric-types with Rain Dance, such as Jolteon, Magnezone, Rotom-A, and Zapdos, are also useful partners as they all destroy Gyarados and add some useful resistances to help Ludicolo out, such as to Electric-type attacks (except for Zapdos).</p> "

  "Breloom": {
    "overview": "<p>Breloom stands as one of the more difficult threats to cover in the tier thanks to its unique blend of survivability and power. Breloom’s access to Spore, Poison Heal ability as well as Toxic Orb's easy activation, and powerful Grass- and Fighting-type attacks make it one of the premier stallbreakers in the tier. Spore warps the tier: only a few Pokemon such as defensive Latias, Zapdos, and Celebi can stomach repeated attacks while asleep. Offensive teams are forced to sacrifice a key Pokemon to Spore, run a Sleep Talk user, or never give Breloom a chance to gain momentum with multiple fast Pokemon or Lum Berry. Defensive teams must typically carry two strong Breloom checks: one to absorb Spore and the other to beat it. Once Toxic Orb activates, Breloom prominently is immune to both status and Knock Off, making it difficult to wear down despite its poor defensive stats. Breloom's typing grants it key access to strong Grass- and Fighting-type attacks such as Seed Bomb, Superpower, and Focus Punch, allowing it to threaten prominent Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Clefable, Blissey, and Swampert.</p> <p>Breloom’s attributes allows it to feature on a wide variety of teams and different roles: the most offensive teams use Breloom early in the game to prevent Stealth Rock via sleep and gain momentum while more defensive teams can take advantage of disabling a threat with sleep, Leech Seed, and a strong Clefable answer. Mach Punch allows Breloom to keep most Tyranitar sets in check, crucial for supporting a Choice Scarf Latias or Choice Scarf Rotom-A. Defensive sets are fantastic status absorbers for opposing Breloom, Rotom-A, and Clefable while generally threatening much of the tier with Leech Seed and paralysis with Force Palm. Swords Dance sets with paralysis support can slice through even multiple bulky checks such as Skarmory, Nidoqueen, and Latias. Substitute sets easily punish teams with poor Breloom checks with repeated Focus Punch without having to worry about revenge killing.</p> <p>Breloom’s flaws lie in its relatively low Speed and defensive stats, making it hard to fulfill all of its niches at once. Breloom is often stuck in a conundrum of needing to invest in its bulk to survive strong attacks such as +1 Tyranitar’s Fire Punch, +1 Gyarados’s Ice Fang, utility Tyranitar's Fire Blast, and Swampert’s Ice Beam, while still needing enough heavy Speed investment to outpace max Speed Swampert, Tyranitar, and slower version of Zapdos and Jirachi if Breloom has a Jolly nature. This makes Breloom vulnerable to offensive pressure from faster Pokemon such as Flygon, Heatran, Latias, Gengar, Dragonite, and Jirachi. Breloom’s survivability comes more from its resilience due to Poison Heal rather than numerical bulk even when invested; it can be overwhelmed by strong neutral attacks such as Life Orb Gengar's Shadow Ball and even resisted hits such as Choice Band Tyranitar’s Stone Edge. Although Breloom can be devastating if underprepared for, common cores are built to limit its impact. Hyper offensive teams often have multiple faster Pokemon with Lum Berry such as Dragonite and Metagross that can OHKO Breloom. Defensive Breloom is deathly afraid of Skarmory—Spikes heavily limit how often Breloom can come in and break common defensive cores, especially since defensive teams often have multiple Breloom counters. Even though Poison Heal heals Breloom in sand, it chips away at its resilience and makes it more difficult to function.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The most prominent other options for Breloom often involve dropping Spore. One of these is Bulk Up + Drain Punch, as a specially defensive EV spread can make Breloom a very bulky stallbreaker with Seed Bomb and Protect. However, such as set can struggle against strong attackers such as Latias and Gengar forcing it out. Breloom also has access to Stone Edge and ThunderPunch for specific targets; however, these are almost always outclassed by Seed Bomb and Facade as offensive options. Lead versions of Breloom especially should not use ThunderPunch, as it doesnt OHKO Gyarados after Intimidate. Defensive Breloom also can act as a weather clear for defensive Pokemon such as Suicune with Sunny Day, as it enjoys maximizing Poison Heal and easily forces out Tyranitar. Breloom can spread paralysis after it uses Spore with Stun Spore but watch out for its low accuracy.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Breloom is one of the most frustrating Pokemon to answer in DPP OU, as it can be a pest and survive due to Poison Heal's constant recovery while also putting to sleep a prominent answer. It often is checked throughout the game with offensive pressure on more faster pace teams and multiple walls on slower teams.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types: Celebi, Cresselia, Uxie, and Latias are the most prominent Breloom answers in the tier. They can all absorb its attacks in the short term and KO back with Psychic or Ice Beam. However, while Celebi has Natural Cure, another Pokemon is needed to absorb the Spore, or Breloom will switch to a powerful teammate or generate momentum off of a sleeping Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Zapdos, Gliscor, Skarmory, and Dragonite are all effective ways to scout out Breloom’s set. Of these, Zapdos is the best due to commonly outspeeding it and taking little from its attacks besides a boosted Facade. Gliscor and Skarmory can OHKO with Flying-type attacks, while Dragonite easily OHKOs with its powerful attacks and can even absorb Spore with Choice Band and Sleep Talk. However, Gliscor and Skarmory both become vulnerable to Breloom’s coverage upon using Roost, while Zapdos and Dragonite do not enjoy Stealth Rock and Breloom’s strong attacks.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Nidoqueen, Gengar, Roserade, and Crobat all can absorb Breloom’s attacks and hit hard in return. Roserade even can run a physically bulky set with Sleep Talk to set up Spikes while asleep and hit Breloom hard, while it commonly uses Poison Point over Natural Cure to absorb Spore. However, the others are all neutralized by Spore, while Nidoqueen and Gengar will eventually fall to repeated Seed Bomb. Crobat doesn’t enjoy Facade and struggles with longevity due to its Stealth Rock weakness.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Talk: Latias, Dragonite, Zapdos, Yanmega, and Heracross can switch into Spore effectively while still functioning or threaten Breloom with strong attacks. However, care should be taken to only switch them in on Spore, as Breloom with Protect and especially Subsitute can take advantage of the switch and generate momentum.</p> <p><strong>Powerful attackers: Faster Pokemon such as Gengar, Heatran, and Infernape, while they can’t always switch in, will easily outspeed and OHKO Breloom if they can get in safely.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure: Slower versions of Breloom can be checked by having its normal entry points on offensive teams—Tyranitar, Swampert, and generally slower Pokemon like Metagross and Machamp—either carry a Lum Berry to absorb Spore or run a lot of speed and hit Breloom hard. An example of this is max Speed Swampert OHKOing Breloom with Ice Beam, Zen Headbutt or Explosion + Lum Berry Metagross, and even opposing Breloom switching into Spore and hitting hard back with Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Physically bulky Pokemon: While Jirachi, Skarmory, and Rotom-A do not enjoy repeated attacks from Breloom, they avoid being 2HKOed and heal off the attack while threatening Breloom out. Rotom-A can even take Spore while still functioning, even KOing Breloom should it have Shadow Ball over Thunderbolt.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Breloom’s Spore is one of its strongest qualities, immediately disabling an opposing Pokemon by putting them to sleep. Superpower is Breloom’s strongest attack bar Focus Punch and heavily threats much of the tier, OHKOing many prominent Fighting-weak Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Clefable, Heatran, and Magnezone while hitting neutral threats such as Scizor, Bronzong, Metagross, and Machamp very hard. Focus Punch can be used after Spore or on a predicted switch, even 2HKOing physically defensive Skarmory. It also does not lower Breloom's stats like Superpower does. Seed Bomb pairs well with both Superpower and Focus Punch, as many prominent walls are Grass-weak such as Hippowdon, Swampert, Milotic, and Suicune. Others are immune or resist Fighting but not Grass such as Nidoqueen, Rotom-A, Uxie, Gliscor, and Gyarados. Seed Bomb is also strong enough to damage Gengar despite resisting it.</p> <p>Mach Punch provides a failsafe against Tyranitar, Agility Empoleon, and forces Lucario to use Extremespeed rather than Close Combat. Mach Punch can OHKO bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and easily 2HKOs bulkless Empoleon and Lucario. As another option, Protect emphasizes Breloom's survivability, as Breloom will always heal even in sand due to Poison Heal. For teams lacking good Breloom checks, a common way to deal with Breloom is to switch in a Sleep Talk user such as Choice Specs Latias or Choice Band Dragonite. As Sleep Talk can only be selected once while choice locked, Protect forces these Pokemon out. Should it be paired with Magnezone, Breloom can take advantage of Skarmory's removal and run Toxic to cripple secondary checks such as defensive Latias, defensive Zapdos and Gliscor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Due to Breloom not needing much Attack to pose a threat, there are many possible EV spreads. This specific EV spread gives Breloom maximum HP while also outspeeding neutral nature Tyranitar and Swampert with the rest of the EVs in Attack. With maximum HP, Breloom can survive many prominent attacks such as utility Tyranitar’s Fire Blast, Swampert Ice Beam, Gengar's Shadow Ball, and defensive Latias’s Ice Beam. Other possibilities include maximizing attack and speed using an EV spread of 12 HP / 244 Atk / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature. This allows Breloom to reach a Poison Heal number and outspeed Adamant Gyarados. Jolly variants are particularly difficult to deal with for defensive teams, as Breloom’s can outspeed slower versions of Jirachi and Zapdos and use Spore before they can respond. Breloom without investment is very frail, however. Should Speed not be important, Breloom can also just run a simple spread of 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Def, but beware of offensive pressure from faster variants of Swampert and Tyranitar.</p> <p>As Breloom's defensive stats are quite low, sparing some EVs in either of its defenses improves its survivability greatly. Breloom can run more physical bulk, such as an EV spread of 248 HP / 116 Atk / 144 Def that survives +1 Tyranitar’s Ice Punch and Gyarados’s +1 Ice Fang after sand damage. With special bulk, such as 108 HP / 176 Atk / 40 SpD / 184 Spe, Breloom can survive max Special Attack Swampert's Ice Beam without entry hazards and defensive Latias's Ice Beam after one layer of Spikes. Breloom can also use additional Speed, such as around 60 EVs to outspeed minimum speed Heatran, 136 to outspeed Machamp and minimum speed Rotom-A and Suicune, and 176 with a Jolly nature to outspeed Tyranitar. Generally, sets with Mach Punch run more attack to maximize damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Breloom often switches in early into prominent Pokemon such as Swampert, Tyranitar, and Clefable to exert pressure. However, these switches could be dangerous: Breloom can be OHKOed by super-effective coverage and is effectively useless should it take Knock Off or Thunder Wave. Once Breloom has activated Toxic Orb, it can freely switch into many status and Knock Off users such as RestTalk Rotom-A and Clefable. Delaying the timing of Breloom’s Spore can often net a more valuable target; opponents will often switch to a sleep absorber or leave their Swampert for example in to absorb the Spore. Delaying additionally avoids using Spore on a Lum Berry target such as Tyranitar, Metagross, Dragonite, and Gyarados. Should Breloom have Focus Punch over Superpower, predicting bulky neutral threats switching in after something absorbs Spore such as Skarmory and Jirachi can maximize damage. Breloom can even stay in on Skarmory as it uses Roost and OHKO it with Focus Punch. Should Breloom have Protect, beware of being too predictable to give opponents free switches due to the amount of offensive pressure Breloom typically exerts.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Breloom has many viable partners as a stable of DPP OU. One of the best partners for Breloom is Pursuit Tyranitar, as some of the most prominent Breloom checkssuch as Latias, Rotom-A, and Gengar, are Dark-weak and can be Pursuit trapped. Tyranitar is also helpful in other ways; Dragon Dance Tyranitar appreciates Breloom’s Spore to help break through bulky checks such as Skarmory, Jirachi, and Nidoqueen. Choice Band Tyranitar can break through Breloom checks with its powerful attacks, while Breloom can absorb Clefable’s Knock Off once the Toxic Orb is activated. Other prominent Breloom partners include Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Choice Scarf Latias, as Mach Punch allows Breloom to check the one boosted threat they cannot handle well: Dragon Dance Tyranitar. As Breloom takes advantage of both Clefable and Tyranitar, it is a great partner to many strong special attackers, such as Heatran, Empoleon, Latias, Zapdos, and Suicune. Heatran is uniquely valuable, as it can potentially trap and KO Latias with Magma Storm and either Dragon Pulse or Explosion while OHKOing Skarmory and Jirachi. Breloom also pressure defensive Water- and Ground-types such as Swampert, Hippowdon, Quagsire, and Suicune, potentially helping offensive Steel-types such as Heatran, Jirachi, Scizor, and Metagross.</p> <p>Breloom also benefits from Magnezone support, as it removes a prominent check in Skarmory, allowing to use Spore on something else. Breloom also heavily pressures Shed Shell Skarmory, as Skarmory can no longer passively heal after it takes a Focus Punch or Superpower. Both defensive and offensive partners with Magnezone work well, as Starmie, Clefable, and physically defensive Zapdos appreciate Breloom's power and ability to check Swampert and Tyranitar while more aggressive partners such as offensive Trick Room Bronzong, Gengar, and Metagross enjoy Breloom's ability to break open defensive teams should Skarmory be trapped. Starmie greatly improves Breloom's survivability by spinning away Spikes, while Breloom takes advantage of Pursuit Tyranitar trying to remove Starmie. Breloom’s ability to absorb Spore from opposing Breloom and its relatively slow speed allow it to fit well with Trick Room Bronzong, as the teams it is featured on typically struggle with opposing Breloom. In a similar vein to Magnezone, Trick + Iron Ball Metagross opens up Skarmory, Rotom-A, and Zapdos by slowing them down and removing their Leftovers.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Defensive Breloom takes a much different approach and focuses on shoring the team against status and Knock Off while being a strong answer to Tyranitar and Clefable. The primary weapon of defensive Breloom is Leech Seed, damaging all non Grass-types and Clefable while maximizing Breloom’s longevity. Force Palm OHKOs bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and 2HKOs Clefable. However, the primary advantage of Force Palm is its paralysis chance. Breloom's Force Palm is a fantastic way to paralyze Latias, Gliscor, and Jirachi, targets that are typically difficult to paralyze and lose a lot of efficacy once statused. Superpower provides Breloom with a much stronger option; Force Palm fails to 2HKO Bold Clefable and has to rely on paralysis to stop Chople Berry Dragon Dance Tyranitar. A more midground option that doesn't drop Breloom's stats is Sky Uppercut; however, beware of its imperfect accuracy. Breloom can also forgo a Fighting-type option to use Facade, as it nets a strong neutral hit on much of the tier.</p> <p>Protect synergizes well with Leech Seed: scouting the opponent, gaining additional recovery easily, and racking up Leech Seed damage. The most prominent last option is Spore, as it instantly neutralizes a threat. It also works well with Leech Seed to gain additional health. However, Seed Bomb is also an excellent option, as it allows Breloom to hit Ghost-types and remain threatening against Swampert and Gastrodon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This Breloom generally can go in two directions: physically or specially bulky. Physical bulk is preferred, as Breloom is often one of the primary checks for opposing Breloom, Tyranitar, and Swampert and needs a lot of physical bulk to withstand their attacks continuously. Physical bulk also helps Breloom check Hippowdon, Gliscor without a Flying-type attack, and Gyarados. Breloom can run some Speed investment, such as around 60 EVs, to outspeed minimum speed Heatran while also outspeeding slower versions of Skarmory, Tyranitar, Swampert, and Metagross. Due to Breloom’s very low Special Defense stat, some of this Speed investment can be put into Special Defense to help against defensive Latias's Ice Beam, utility Tyranitar’s Fire Blast, and Swampert’s Ice Beam.</p> <p>Another route to go is to invest in Breloom’s Special Defense with a Careful nature and full bulk investment with a spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD. Specially defensive Breloom is a fantastic answer to Calm Mind Clefable while also takes special coverage much better. Specially defensive Breloom can survive many super-effective special attacks such as +1 Suicune Ice Beam, defensive Zapdos’s Heat Wave, Jirachi’s Psychic, Choice Scarf Rotom-A’s Shadow Ball, and defensive Heatran’s Lava Plume. Breloom loses the ability to switch into opposing Breloom’s Spore while surviving Superpower and is commonly OHKOed by +1 Tyranitar’s Fire Punch by going down this path, however.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Breloom generally wants to activate its Toxic Orb as soon as possible, as it is useless without Poison Heal. Switch into opposing Breloom’s Spore sparingly, as opposing Breloom’s Fighting-type coverage 2HKOs on even physically bulky Breloom. This Breloom is particularly annoying for offensive teams to deal with, as it commonly stalls out any momentum from choiced attackers such as Latias, Rotom-A, Swampert, Tyranitar, and Gyarados while chipping them with Leech Seed. As such, take advantage of Breloom’s bulk and recovery throughout the game to choke out the opponent. Breloom often can recover from very low health quite easily with Leech Seed, Protect, and Poison Heal, allowing it to tank strong hits and eventually come out healthy.</p> <p>Keep Breloom away from entry hazard setters, Spikes, and Substitute users, as its offensive options are weak and easy to set up on. Once Breloom uses Spore, it should be trying to use Force Palm to spread paralysis on its checks as much as it can, as for example, Gliscor cannot use Taunt before Breloom uses Leech Seed, Latias cannot use Reflect on a potential Tyranitar switch, and Jirachi cannot use Iron Head to flinch Breloom.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Defensive Breloom generally belongs on stall teams that can afford its lack of offensive pressure, absorb the strong hits it can’t take, and benefit from its ability to neutralize Clefable. However, because Breloom is setup fodder for Skarmory and forced out by mixed Flygon, defensive partners need to account for offensive Spikes teams well. Tyranitar is particularly effective, as choiced sets can take advantage of a paralyzed Latias, while defensive sets easily stomach the strong special attackers that eliminate Breloom, like offensive Heatran and Latias. However, sand can sometimes be detrimental to Breloom’s constant passive recovery. Specially defensive walls with Knock Off, such as Clefable and Empoleon, are especially effective to help wear down opponents with Leech Seed. Breloom also saves Clefable from having to trade Knock Off with opposing Clefable. Anti Spikes measures are extremely important with Breloom due to the ubiquity of Skarmory. Breloom fits quite well with Magnezone to trap Skarmory and Forretress, while Shed Shell Skarmory doesn’t enjoy repeated residual damage and paralysis this set inflicts. Other choices that fit alongside Magnezone, such as Latias, defensive Wish + Protect Jirachi, Toxic + Protect Metagross, and Swampert are helpful. Hippowdon can also be effective, but like Tyranitar, sand can sometimes be detrimental. Choice Scarf Magneton can also be effective to help against the hyper offensive teams that can take advantage of defensive Breloom, as it outspeeds and revenge kills Adamant Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite. Breloom fits quite well on bulkier paralysis spamming teams due to spreading paralysis to Latias and Gliscor effectively. Potential partners include Starmie, physically defensive Zapdos, Jirachi, and Rhyperior. Starmie is especially helpful to Rapid Spin the hazards that the opponent sets up on Breloom. In return, Breloom counters Tyranitar and Clefable, two common Stealth Rock users and checks to Zapdos, and helps Jirachi out against Dragon Dance Tyranitar.</p> <p>Breloom fits well alongside bulky special sweepers that are vulnerable to Encore Clefable, such as Calm Mind + RestTalk Suicune, Calm Mind Latias, and Calm Mind + Wish or Substitute Jirachi, as it can take the Knock Off once Toxic Orb activates and 2HKO Clefable. Breloom enjoys easy entry for its Toxic Orb activation, meaning Uxie, RestTalk Rotom-A, and Latias are good partners to bait in Tyranitar. Uxie can even use U-Turn to bring in Breloom easily. These Pokemon also ease Breloom’s commitment to absorbing opposing Breloom’s Spore by surviving strong Fighting-type coverage and forcing opposing Breloom out.</p> "

        "name": "Lead",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Breloom is one of the best options to immediately get momentum as a lead on hyper offensive teams, as any foe without a Lum Berry or a faster Taunt is put to sleep. Spore is an excellent tool to prevent Stealth Rock and simplify game plans, as the pace of the team makes it difficult for the opposing Pokemon to wake up. The choice between Superpower and Focus Punch is item dependent—with a Choice Scarf, Breloom has to use Superpower because it can function as a revenge killer. However, with a Focus Sash, Breloom can leverage the more common Choice Scarf set to Focus Punch foes trying to wake up or switch. Seed Bomb threatens Grass-weak leads such as Swampert, Hippowdon, and Starmie as well as provides a reliable attack should it use Focus Punch. Stone Edge rounds out Breloom's coverage against Flying-types, hitting Zapdos, Gyarados, and Dragonite hard. However, since it doesn't OHKO them, Stun Spore is another option, especially with Focus Sash, to spread paralysis on Breloom checks such as Latias, Gliscor, Zapdos, and Skarmory.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>To outspeed common leads, Breloom needs to be as fast as possible. Since Breloom can't use a Toxic Orb, Effect Spore provides an additional chance to status contact attacks, such as Flygon and Uxie using U-turn to scout Breloom.</p> <p>The choice between Choice Scarf and Focus Sash depends on how weak to Stealth Rock the rest of the team is. Breloom has a Speed stat of 393 with a Choice Scarf, enough to outspeed common fast Stealth Rock leads such as Azelf and Choice Scarf Tyranitar, putting them to sleep (should Azelf lack a Lum Berry) before they can set up Stealth Rock. It also helps against powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Latias, Heatran, and Dragonite. Breloom can also act as speed control for typically frail hyper offense teams, letting it revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar and neutral speed nature Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite. On teams not as weak to Stealth Rock or have other revenge killers, Focus Sash allows Breloom to survive one hit and get off a Spore or powerful attack. Having a Focus Sash also prevents Breloom from being forced out immediately once it uses Spore.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Breloom should lead and almost always use Spore, as it has no bulk and aims to immediately get momentum. Exceptions tend to be if the opposing lead common carries a Lum Berry, such as Metagross and Gyarados; is faster than Breloom and will Taunt, such as Aerodactyl; or could be KOed by an attack and are thus likely to try to absorb Spore, such as Tyranitar and Swampert. Once Breloom uses Spore, Choice Scarf leads are forced out and can be used later as fodder or to revenge kill. Focus Sash leads instead try to do as much damage as possible before Breloom faints—Breloom fainting gives a free switch to another threat. As such, try to leverage the fact that Choice Scarf Breloom is forced out after using Spore on something slow to Focus Punch possible switches or foes trying to wake up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Breloom is a staple of aggressive hyper offense teams. With Choice Scarf, Breloom should be used with threats that do not like Stealth Rock, such as Gyarados and Dragonite. Mixed Dragonite is especially threatening with Breloom, as it enjoys coming in for free without Stealth Rock up and immediately threatens common Breloom answers. As using lead Breloom means forgoing early Stealth Rock, common synergistic users such as Heatran, Metagross, and Camerupt are good partners. Other hyper offense mainstays such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Swords Dance Scizor, offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, offensive Empoleon, and Swords Dance Lucario are other strong partners with Breloom. Swords Dance Scizor with Pursuit is an especially strong partner, as it helps to defeat Latias trying to come in after Breloom uses Spore. Scizor can even use an Occa Berry to better protect against Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>With Focus Sash, Breloom's partners do not have to be as aggressive, since Breloom can't prevent Stealth Rock from faster leads such as Azelf or Aerodactyl. However, it can immediately weaken prominent Breloom checks such as Skarmory, especially if the opponent tries to switch it in after Breloom uses Spore expecting the Choice Scarf set. With Stun Spore, Breloom can unexpectedly paralyze Latias, Gliscor, and Zapdos, helping Jirachi, Mamoswine, and Machamp break through them. Breloom also appreciates other forms of speed control, such as Choice Scarf Latias, as it setup fodder for Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite if they can mitigate status.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Breloom can become a full-blown sweeper with Swords Dance. Even walls that resist one or both of Seed Bomb and Superpower such as Nidoqueen, Latias, and Skarmory can be 2HKOed easily after a Swords Dance boost. Milotic and Hippowdon, prominent answers to physical sweepers, are both OHKOed by Seed Bomb after one Swords Dance, while Superpower OHKOs all non-physically bulky Jirachi.</p> <p>Facade rounds out the coverage, as it hits Zapdos, Latias, and Dragonite hard. Due to Toxic Orb, Facade will always be at 140 base power, doing more damage than Seed Bomb against neutral targets. It may seem odd to use Breloom without Spore, but the additional coverage is often worth it, especially since Latias outspeeds and walls Breloom even while asleep. Other options include Spore, which neutralizes a threat and eases set-up. Mach Punch helps to alleviate Breloom’s low speed against faster Pokemon weak to Fighting, such as Heatran and Lucario. Breloom can also be a bulky win condition with Protect in the last slot as well.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread given maximizes Breloom’s sweeping abilities while also hitting a Poison Heal number—both Jolly and Adamant natures work here. Many other EV spreads works too; the most prominent of these is run max HP and hit another Speed benchmark, such as around 60 EVs for minimum Speed Heatran, 136 for Machamp, minimum Speed Rotom-A, and minimum Speed Suicune, and 184 EVs for max speed neutral Tyranitar and Swampert while putting the rest in attack and HP. This route gives Breloom some more breathing room to set up. An additional route is to run further bulk by making Breloom Impish—this allows Breloom to fulfill its defensive obligations against Dragon Dance Tyranitar and opposing Breloom once the Toxic Orb has activated while still being a threat with Swords Dance. An example EV spread is 248 HP / 4 Atk / 120 Def / 136 Spe that survives Dragon Dance Tyranitar’s +1 Ice Punch, Dragon Dance Gyarados’s +1 Ice Fang while still outspeeding the Machamp, Rotom-A, and Suicune benchmark. As an Impish non-Attack invested +0 Superpower can leave standard Clefable and Chople Berry + Dragon Dance Tyranitar alive, another option is to run less Speed and use 248 HP / 76 Atk / 184 Def with an Adamant nature, as this still survives the bulk thresholds while strengthening Breloom.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Breloom, especially if it drops Spore and has no defensive investment, must be more careful when it comes in. Breloom appreciates its checks such as Latias to be either KOed or paralyzed before it uses Swords Dance. Against more defensive teams, due to Breloom’s longevity, it can come in more often, activate its Toxic Orb, and threaten Clefable and Tyranitar. As most opponents will expect Spore, leverage likely Sleep sacrifices to get a free Swords Dance or to switch to an appropriate counter. On more defensive teams, Breloom’s role changes as a wall that can sweep, so trading lots of Breloom’s health for eliminating +1 Dragon Dance Tyranitar is valuable.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Breloom is most commonly featured on teams with extensive paralysis support, as paralyzing walls such as Latias and Skarmory can open up opponents to a Breloom sweep. In return, Breloom provides these teams with a strong answer to Ground-types such as Swampert and Hippowdon that are immune to Thunder Wave and can be difficult to deal with, Knock Off Clefable, and Tyranitar. Common teammates for this style include Blissey, Bold Clefable, defensive Zapdos, Jirachi, and Starmie. These Pokemon, all help Breloom with its flaws: Starmie can make up for Breloom’s weakness to Spikes, while Blissey, Zapdos, Clefable, and Jirachi help take strong attackers such as Gengar, Choice Specs Latias, and Lucario that Breloom struggles with. Breloom also appreciates additional support for breaking down walls—the most prominent choice is Machamp, as it also takes advantage of paralysis support. Other Pokemon that take advantage of paralysis, such as Togekiss and Rhyperior, can also be supported by Breloom. More offensive paralysis teams can also support Breloom, such as with Azelf, Jirachi, Tyranitar, and Dragon Dance + Thunder Wave Gyarados. Tyranitar is particularly helpful, as it can Pursuit trap Dark-weak Breloom answers and can even spread paralysis on difficult to paralyze threats like Latias.</p> <p>An additional route to using Swords Dance Breloom is with Magnezone support, as it traps Skarmory and other bulky Steel-types such as Bronzong, Metagross, and Scizor that can interfere with sweeping. Common partners in this style include Tyranitar, Jirachi, Skarmory, Clefable, and defensive Latias. Other ways to open up walls, including Trick + Iron Ball or Choice Scarf Metagross and mixed threats such as Jirachi and Flygon are generally helpful.</p> "

      {
        "name": "SubPunch",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>The threat of Spore and powerful attacks is generally enough to get Breloom a Substitute on something it forces out. Substitute provides Breloom with a number of advantages. The first is that Breloom can more easily choose what to use Spore on, as sleep sacrifices only give Breloom momentum to attack rather than waste Spore. Additionally, Substitute counters switching in a choiced Sleep Talk user to absorb Spore, as they must break the Substitute before locking into Sleep Talk. Second, the Substitute allows Breloom to use the more powerful Focus Punch without worrying about being hit; with investment, it can even 2HKO resists like bulkless Latias. Third, the Substitute helps prevent revenge killing on the typically slow Breloom. With defensive investment, Substitute can survive weaker attacks, such as Choice Scarf Flygon’s U-Turn, opposing Breloom’s Seed Bomb, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar’s Crunch. As such, this Breloom is one of the best punishers of teams lacking multiple good Breloom checks.</p> <p>Seed Bomb rounds out Breloom’s coverage, giving Breloom a no drawbacks attack while also threatening Pokemon that resist Fighting. Another option, however, is to run Leech Seed, as Breloom has the unique advantage of Poison Heal over other SubSeed users, meaning it can potentially heal more HP than a Substitute requires. This will leave Breloom without a no drawbacks offensive move, however.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread given allows Breloom’s Substitute to survive Choice Scarf Flygon’s U-Turn. This counters a common way to get around Substitute: continually using U-Turn into a threat that survives the Focus Punch. It also survives Dragon Dance Tyranitar's +1 Fire Punch after Stealth Rock and sand damage. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack to power up Seed Bomb and Focus Punch. Breloom can also put some of the Attack investment into Speed to keep up a Substitute on foes such as Skarmory, Metagross, and defensive Heatran. However, Breloom can also go fully offensive and run 12 HP / 244 Atk / 252 Speed with a Jolly or Adamant nature. For SubSeed sets, the Jolly max Speed spread is particularly threatening to slower teams, as Breloom will continually be able to set up a Substitute + Poison Heal while throwing out strong Focus Punch. Breloom can also maximize its defensive bulk with a SubSeed set, with an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with an Impish nature.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because Breloom’s Focus Punch has to be predicted, Breloom typically should be brought in more carefully on something it threatens, such as Swampert, slower Tyranitar, Blissey, and Clefable and then Substitute on the switch out. This puts the opponent in a difficult situation of dealing with a Breloom behind a Substitute that still can put something to sleep. Beware of opponents that deal with Breloom with offensive pressure, as fast Swampert hitting Breloom with Ice Beam or Tyranitar using Fire Blast is one of the best ways to prevent Breloom from getting that Substitute. Once Breloom has a Substitute, Breloom can use Focus Punch and Leech Seed with impunity, as it can just attack sleep sacrifices without using Spore or set up repeated Leech Seed on slower targets. Once Breloom has used Spore and is forced out, coming in on Fighting-weak targets such as Clefable and Tyranitar again is more difficult, as they will continue to attack Breloom instead of switch out. Should Breloom be Jolly, using Spore is more forgiving on a threat such as defensive Jirachi, as Breloom can continuously sleep and set up a Substitute without being punished.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Generally, Substitute Breloom has similar partners to the offensive set; however Breloom doesn't have as much utility due to being forced to use a Fighting-type attack with drawbacks. As such, it enjoys being used alongside other checks to Tyranitar, such as Metagross and Jirachi. Trick Metagross can lure in and give prominent Breloom checks like Skarmory, Rotom-A, and Zapdos an Iron Ball or Choice Scarf to allow Breloom to more easily defeat them. Pursuit Tyranitar is again an excellent partner, as it can Pursuit prominent Sleep absorbers such as Rotom-A and Latias to allow Breloom to use Spore again. Breloom’s strong Focus Punch and Spore combination often soften up opposing teams for fast sweepers such as Calm Mind Jirachi and Dragon Dance Tyranitar to take advantage of. Many Pokemon enjoy Breloom’s ability to bust up defensive core involving Clefable, such as Heatran, Latias, Calm Mind Jirachi, Suicune, and Empoleon. A particularly potent pairing is Will-o-Wisp Heatran + Choice Specs Latias, as opponents will be less likely to switch in Clefable knowing Breloom can easily take advantage of it. This can force burn on Pokemon such as Tyranitar, opening up Choice Specs Latias. Breloom also appreciates entry hazard users, as some of its more prominent sleep absorbers are weak to Stealth Rock. Pokemon such as Heatran, Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Skarmory are useful. Skarmory also sets up Spikes, which can be helpful due to other prominent Breloom checks such as Celebi, Nidoqueen, and Jirachi giving free set up. With Spikes, SubSeed Breloom especially becomes very difficult to deal with.</p> "

Its incredibly crippling Stealth Rock weakness combined with low power and bad STAB moves make it an overall terrible choice.

One may think that its Bug / Flying typing may give it some niche, but Yanmega is a far superior option due to its much better defensive stats and its stronger power.</p> ",

X-Scissor is its best STAB move available. Night Slash hits Ghost-types like Gengar and, more importantly, Rotom-A for decent damage. Dig is a surprise move to catch grounded Steel-types like Jirachi, Magnezone, and, most notably, Heatran. After a Swords Dance, Dig should do significant damage to non-bulky Jirachi while OHKOing Heatran and Magnezone.</p> <p>An Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment are both absolutely mandatory to mitigate Ninjask's poor power as much as possible. The Speed investment allows Ninjask to outspeed Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Outspeeding Weavile is unnecessary, as Ninjask gets maimed by Ice Shard regardless. The rest of the EVs are put into HP to give Ninjask a greater chance of actually surviving an attacking move from any other OU Pokemon. 4 EVs are taken out of HP so it can survive Stealth Rock twice.</p> <p>Save Ninjask as a late-game cleaner in hopes that you can actually get a KO with it. It can safely set up Swords Dance versus a Pokemon Choice locked into a Ground- or Fighting-type move, but otherwise it probably won't get a chance to do much.</p> <p>If you must use Ninjask, Magnezone is a mandatory partner to trap pesky Steel-types like Skarmory and Bronzong that may get in the way of a Ninjask sweep.

It's a tough world for Hariyama in OU when there is Machamp lurking about with STAB No Guard Dynamic Punch at its disposal. Hariyama may seem outclassed in every possible way, but there are a few useful niches that Hariyama can claim and therefore edge out his four-armed rival in some way. Most of these niches stem from useful movepool options such as Fake Out, which can give Hariyama the free turn necessary to activate a status Orb and break Focus Sashes. Generally speaking, in OU you will want to use Machamp, but you may occasionally find Hariyama's features more useful for your team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder Punch is a more reliable option to take out Gyarados, but if you want to deal with Gyarados, Stone Edge is usually the superior option, thanks to its ability to hit other Flying-types for more damage. Facade is a powerful attack that hits most Pokemon for neutral damage, but Close Combat and Payback cover everything else and provide more useful coverage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gyarados is the best counter to Hariyama sets that lack Stone Edge or Thunder Punch. It can easily come in, Intimidate Hariyama, and proceed to Dragon Dance. Skarmory is faster and can nail Hariyama with Brave Bird, though be wary of using Roost as Close Combat will be super effective against Skarmory on that turn.

        "description": "<p>Hariyama is a Pokemon with lots of attacking power and bulk; its movepool is wide enough to cover the majority of common leads, while its superb HP allows it to emerge victorious from the exchange. Thanks to Fake Out, Hariyama can break the opposing lead's Focus Sash while activating Guts and blocking status from leads like Smeargle and Roserade. Hariyama can then proceed to use one of its other three powerful moves to defeat the opponent.</p> <p>Close Combat is your main STAB attack, dealing heavy blows to almost every lead. Low Kick is a good alternative, allowing Hariyama to hit most leads for the same amount of damage without the side-effect of lowering its defenses, although the drop in power is noticeable against leads such as Swampert and Machamp. Payback allows you to hit Azelf and Uxie super effectively while Ice Punch rounds out the coverage, annihilating leads such as Gliscor and Dragonite. Stone Edge is an alternative, allowing Hariyama to knock Flying-types out of the sky later in the game, but the ability to OHKO Gliscor with a Guts-boosted Ice Punch is usually too good to give up. However, Stone Edge allows it to take on Gyarados, one of Hariyama's biggest counters, later in the game, dealing 55% - 65.3% after Intimidate (assuming Guts has been activated).</p> <p>The main reason to use Hariyama over Machamp is because of its natural bulk. Hariyama has much more HP than Machamp, allowing Hariyama to invest EVs in its defenses and Speed, one thing Machamp misses out on. Hariyama has access to Fake Out, something that Machamp does not have, which allows Hariyama to break the opposing lead's Focus Sash before the pummeling begins, which is definitely a big bonus. Machamp, on the other hand, must bring the opponent's lead down to its Focus Sash before it can Bullet Punch, leaving it vulnerable to a counter switching in. With Hariyama as a lead, you can now utilize Machamp late game; Substitute Machamp makes a great partner to Hariyama. Machamp is usually checked by faster or bulky Pokemon such as Azelf, Heatran, and Gliscor; Hariyama can take them out at the start of the battle, thereby easing Machamp's sweep.</p> <p>The item Hariyama holds is up to the user's preference. Flame Orb should be used if Hariyama is planning to stay on the field for a while, otherwise Toxic Orb is the item of choice. The EVs are chosen so that Hariyama hits as hard as possible and takes special attacks superbly. 92 EVs are invested into Speed so that Hariyama can outpace minimum Speed Tyranitar, although more can be invested to adjust for Speed creep on Tyranitar's part.</p> <p>Metagross and Infernape are troublesome leads. Metagross has enough bulk to survive a Fake Out followed by a Close Combat, therefore Close Combat should not be so hastily used, as after the Defense drop Hariyama has a good chance of getting OHKOed by Meteor Mash. The best course of action against Metagross would be to Payback first, followed by a Close Combat to take it out. It should be noted however, that Metagross can beat Hariyama if it chooses to attack outright instead of setting up Stealth Rock. The same strategy applies to Infernape. Due to Infernape's faster Fake Out, Hariyama cannot break Infernape's Focus Sash; Hariyama must resort to using Payback on the second turn to break Infernape's Focus Sash, and then finish it off with Close Combat.</p> <p>Starmie is a great partner to Hariyama as it checks Infernape and Metagross well. It can switch in on Infernape's Fake Out, Hydro Pump Infernape down its Focus Sash as Infernape sets up Stealth Rock, and then proceed to outspeed and kill Infernape with Rapid Spin while clearing the rocks. Starmie can also switch into Metagross as it uses Stealth Rock, then Hydro Pump for a 2HKO while Metagross fails to knock out Starmie with Earthquake. Starmie can then perform its spinner duties regardless.</p> "

These calculations all assume a Jolly nature.</p> <ul> <li>Head Smash vs. 12/0 Breloom 74.2% - 87.5% <li>Head Smash vs. 0/0 Jirachi 47.8% - 56.3%</li> <li>Head Smash vs. 252/220+ Celebi 59.7% - 70.5%</li> <li>Head Smash vs. 252/4 Gliscor 75.7% - 89.3%</li> <li>Head Smash vs. 252/252+ Suicune 52.7% - 62.4%</li> <li>Head Smash vs. 252/176+ Skarmory 58.1% - 68.9%</li> <li>Head Smash vs. 252/0 Metagross 35.7% - 42%</li> </ul> <p>The listed EVs provide Aggron with maximum power while still letting him outspeed Pokemon such as uninvested Rotom-A, Suicune, Cresselia, and Gyarados; slower stall teams will therefore have even more problems taking out Aggron. If you want more power, feel free to use an Adamant nature along with enough Speed EVs to outspeed Skarmory. 164 Speed EVs let Aggron outrun uninvested Skarmory, but bear in mind that some do invest in Speed. Additionally, Toxic can be used over Ice Punch to cripple Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Swampert on the switch.</p> <p>Due to Aggron's three common weaknesses in Ground, Fighting, and Water, teammates who resist these moves are appreciated. Celebi is a great partner for Aggron because it resists all three of the aforementioned types; it can also spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, which compensates for Aggron's low Speed. Gengar is a good partner as well, as he is immune to Ground- and Fighting-type moves and can lure in Blissey, whom Aggron can easily switch in on. Additionally, Aggron resists Ghost and Dark, which the aforementioned Pokemon are weak to. Sandstorm support is appreciated as it boosts Aggron's Special Defense; Hippowdon can set up Stealth Rock and tank Flygon's Earthquake, while Tyranitar can use a Choice Band set to help wear down the opposing team, or use Flamethrower and Ice Beam to take care of Breloom and Flygon. As Aggron will be switching in and out a lot, Rapid Spin support is helpful; Starmie is a great choice because it not only resists Water and Fighting, but can break down physical walls with its STAB Hydro Pump.</p> <p>Aggron has trouble with defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Metagross. Celebi can handle all three with Grass Knot, Leaf Storm, and Earth Power, respectively. After Aggron KOes a foe, he can easily be revenge killed by faster Pokemon. Flygon can be handled with Gengar, who is immune to Earthquake, and by Hippowdon, who can tank any hit that Flygon throws at him. Hippowdon can also tank Bronzong and Metagross's hits as well as provide sandstorm to boost Aggron's Special Defense. Specially defensive Zapdos can take care of Starmie, Heatran, and Shaymin by tanking their hits and threatening them with its powerful attacks; furthermore, Zapdos has good synergy with Aggron.</p> "

Hippowdon is a good partner because he can take Choice Scarf Flygon's Earthquakes and KO with Ice Fang, while Tyranitar can lure in and KO Flygon with Ice Beam. Due to Aggron's decreased damage output, entry hazard support is helpful to assist in his sweep. Roserade is a good partner because he not only resists Water and Fighting, but can also can scare away bulky Water-types with his Grass-type STAB moves while setting up Spikes in the process.

In addition, even after a boost, Aggron is outsped by base 100 Choice Scarf users.

  "Claydol": {
    "overview": "<p>Claydol, once one of the most prominent support Pokemon around, now lies overshadowed by many of the newer faces and older rivals that it has only a few advantages over. Bronzong, with a superior defensive typing and slightly higher stats, is more popular as a supporter, and Claydol's only advantages from a support point of view are its much higher Speed, which allows it to outpace most Scizor and some Tyranitar, as well as its access to Rapid Spin. Even in the spinning department, however, it is overshadowed by Forretress, who has a superior defensive typing, an equally good support movepool, and the ability to take out spinblocking Ghost-types. Claydol's many weaknesses to common attacking types do not help its case either. However, Claydol's balanced offensive and defensive stats as well as its Ground-type STAB still make it worth using in certain situations.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Claydol has a whole host of other support options that can easily replace Rapid Spin or Stealth Rock, and can hence be specialized for different teams. Chief among these are Reflect and Light Screen, which have great merit on offensive teams that rely heavily on setup sweepers. As Claydol also learns Stealth Rock, it can mimic pure support Uxie in this way, by using Stealth Rock alongside dual screens with Explosion in place of Memento. Claydol can set up Gravity as well; although it is slightly overshadowed by Bronzong and Forretress in this role, it can make use of Gravity with a perfectly accurate Stone Edge, and unlike Bronzong, it isn't weak to Ground-type attacks under Gravity. Alternatively, Claydol learns Trick Room too. Lastly, Trick can be used alongside a Choice item to hopefully cripple an incoming wall or counter.</p> <p>Shadow Ball is another decent option that allows Claydol to hit spinblocking Ghost-types; this is particularly important as two of the three OU Ghost-types, namely Rotom-A and Gengar, are immune to Earth Power by virtue of their Levitate ability. Toxic is a very interesting option as it can cripple bulky Water-types, such as Swampert and Vaporeon, who are common switch-ins to Claydol. Grass Knot always 2HKOes 252/0 Swampert through Leftovers, but it deals pitiful damage to Suicune and Vaporeon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Water-types are perhaps the best counters to Claydol. Gyarados is probably the best choice as it is immune to Earthquake, takes little from Ice Beam, and can easily set up with Dragon Dance or use Taunt to stop Claydol from using its support moves. The same is more or less true for Suicune and Vaporeon, who both dislike Toxic but have strong Water-type STAB moves that will KO Claydol. Starmie has no such problem as Natural Cure heals it of poison; it also has access to Recover to offset any damage that Claydol can do. Swampert does worse, as it is 2HKOed by the rare Grass Knot and dislikes Toxic, but it can threaten Claydol in much the same fashion. Lastly, while most Dragon-types cannot take Ice Beam, Kingdra is neutral to Ice-type attacks and can take almost anything Claydol throws at it while destroying Claydol with its Water-type STAB moves or setting up with Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Ghost-types are an issue for Claydol. The common Gengar and Rotom-A are both immune to Earthquake thanks to Levitate and can defeat Claydol with their STAB moves. However, Gengar cannot switch into Shadow Ball or Psychic twice, while defensive Rotom-A dislikes Toxic. Dusknoir is an issue too, but does not have any strong Ghost-type STAB attacks nor an immunity to Ground-type moves. Bug- and Dark-types are problematic for Claydol, especially as the users of these moves, namely Scizor and Tyranitar, tend to have access to Pursuit as well. Scizor can take anything Claydol throws its way barring Hidden Power Fire, and, in addition to Pursuit, can use U-turn too, which KOes Claydol if it stays in and allows Scizor to scout the incoming Pokemon if Claydol switches. Tyranitar is much the same, but it has a more powerful STAB Pursuit and can also use STAB Crunch against Claydol that stay in. Heracross is noteworthy for its powerful STAB Megahorn, ability to absorb Toxic for a Guts boost, and access to Pursuit. Furthermore, it is the only one of the above that resists Earth Power, but conversely, it is weak to Psychic. Grass-types can be a nuisance as well. The biggest problem of the bunch is Celebi, who resists both of Claydol's STAB moves, doesn't take much damage from Ice Beam and Shadow Ball, and can hit Claydol hard with Grass Knot. Breloom does well too, despite weaknesses to Psychic and Ice Beam, and can use Spore or Seed Bomb to defeat Claydol. Roserade lacks the Ground-type resistance of its peers and is weak to Ice Beam and Psychic as well, but has a high Special Defense stat to shrug off super effective attacks, along with access to STAB Grass Knot and Leaf Storm.</p> <p>Lastly, Bronzong and Skarmory can take just about anything from Claydol, but they cannot immediately pose a threat. Bronzong must have Grass Knot to cause any real damage, and can only really hurt Claydol by putting it to sleep with Hypnosis. Skarmory can whittle it down with Brave Bird, but it must be wary of being caught by Earth Power when it uses Roost against a slower Claydol. Blissey can take any special hit and is not terribly bothered by most of Claydol's physical attacks, but it should be mindful of Explosion.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Rapid Spin is the most important move on the set, as it removes entry hazards that can be crippling for the rest of the Pokemon on your team; vice versa, Claydol can also cut opponents' lifespans short with its own Stealth Rock. Attacking moves are recommended in the last two slots as many OU Pokemon can cause Claydol trouble. The first of these should be a Ground-type STAB move, as Ground is an excellent attacking type and helps Claydol greatly against common Steel-types. Earthquake is usually the superior choice as it has a chance to OHKO Lucario and Infernape, as well as 2HKO Tyranitar and Jirachi, which Earth Power cannot do. However, Earth Power provides a guaranteed 2HKO on standard Choice Band Metagross, is not affected by Intimidate, and prevents the need for splitting EVs if you wish to run Ice Beam.</p> <p>There are a number of viable options in the last slot, but it is generally best to avoid splitting EVs as this reduces Claydol's already low offensive power. Thus, if using Earth Power, go for Ice Beam, and if running Earthquake, use Explosion. In general, Ice Beam is the best coverage option as it gives Claydol super effective coverage on not only the Grass- and Flying-types that resist or are immune to Ground, but also Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Flygon. However, it lacks power against foes it hits for neutral damage, such as Rotom-A. On the physical side, the option that most merits a mention is Explosion. This might seem ridiculous considering the fact that your opponent's first switch-in to Claydol is usually a Ghost-type, but it is by far Claydol's best way to deal significant damage. Explosion can create an important gap in the opponent's team, especially if it hits a bulky Water- or Grass-type, and also grants a free switch that could give you the opportunity to set up a sweep or regain momentum.</p> <p>Claydol is difficult to EV given its multiple traits and talents, and you will very rarely find Claydol that carry the same exact EVs. The 252 HP EVs grant Claydol optimum defenses, while the 144 Defense EVs ensure that it survives the 2HKO from Jolly Life Orb Mamoswine's Ice Shard as well as the OHKO from +2 Infernape's Fire Punch and Choice Band Machamp's Payback. 112 Attack EVs will let Earthquake OHKO Lucario and Infernape after Stealth Rock, 2HKO non-bulky Jirachi and Tyranitar, and add more sting to Explosion. If running a special set, 112 Special Attack EVs should be run instead to enable Claydol to always 2HKO 252/0 Metagross with Earth Power, and give Ice Beam a reasonable chance to OHKO 4/0 Flygon, as well as non-bulky Dragonite and 252/0 Gliscor after Stealth Rock.</p> "

  "Cradily": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Cradily might seem handicapped as a Curse sweeper due to its relatively large number of weaknesses and only average stats. While Cradily's Rock typing might trouble it to some extent, it does increase Cradily's Special Defense stat by 50% in a sandstorm. Combined with its access to Recover, a move that other Curse users, such as Swampert, Tyranitar, and Regirock, wish they had, Cradily can become quite a formidable threat.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Seed Bomb is by far the best move not mentioned above. It can replace Earthquake to provide Cradily with a secondary STAB attack that also nails common physical walls, namely Swampert and Hippowdon. Cradily can make use of a set consisting of Stockpile and Swords Dance, but it has limited coverage as it only has room for two attacks; one if it opts for a healing move. Stone Edge is an alternative to Rock Slide that trades accuracy for power, but it is not recommended due to Stone Edge's low PP. Mirror Coat reflects special attacks for double the damage, but also reduces Cradily's coverage. Toxic cripples bulky opponents, but is generally not worth a moveslot. Finally, Pain Split can be used over Recover to heal Cradily while damaging the opponent, but if the opponent does not have relatively high HP, Recover will be the more effective move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Most of Cradily's counters are Pokemon that pack a super effective attack. Scizor is the number one threat to Cradily, as three of its common moves hit Cradily for super effective damage, while Swords Dance lets Scizor boost its Attack faster than Cradily can boost its Defense with Curse. Metagross is another counter thanks to its powerful Meteor Mash, which hurts Cradily a lot even after one or two Defense boosts. Similarly, Infernape has a powerful STAB super effective Close Combat with which to dispose of Cradily; however, it can be taken out by a well-timed Earthquake. Jirachi can often flinch Cradily to death with STAB Iron Head, or Trick it a Choice Scarf to render it useless for the rest of the match. Finally, Breloom not only resists anything Cradily can throw at it, but can also use Spore to incapacitate it, set up a Substitute, and knock it out with Focus Punch.</p> ",

        "name": "Curse",
        "description": "<p>Cradily is an effective Curse user that has several advantages over Tyranitar and Regirock, namely Suction Cups, which prevents it from being phazed, and a Grass typing, which eliminates its weaknesses to Water and Grass. Curse is a great move that boosts Cradily's average Attack and Defense stats and enables it to both hit harder and take hits more easily. Rock Slide is Cradily's main attack as it gains STAB and hits most Pokemon that don't resist it quite hard after a few boosts. Recover allows Cradily to heal without going to sleep and becoming setup bait; however, Rest completely heals Cradily and cures it of status as well, especially Toxic and Will-O-Wisp. Earthquake is the recommended move if using Recover as it gives Cradily better coverage, while Sleep Talk is the preferred option if Cradily carries Rest; it allows Cradily to attack or set up while asleep.</p> <p>The EV spread and nature maximizes Cradily's HP and Special Defense stats to let it take most special attacks with ease, especially when sandstorm is in play. Special Defense investment is preferred to physical bulk because Cradily will be boosting its latter defense with Curse. The remaining EVs are put into Attack to enable Cradily to hit a bit harder.</p> <p>A Sand Stream Pokemon is needed for Cradily to reach its full potential. Tyranitar and Hippowdon are both great options; both can provide Stealth Rock support as well. A teammate that can switch into Bug-, Steel-, and Fighting-type attacks, such as Gyarados or Zapdos, is also appreciated as Cradily will often attract attacks of these types.</p> "

  "Walrein": {
    "overview": "<p>As usual, the Ice-type is very much a mixed blessing. Ice-type attacks are always useful on a team, but the STAB boost on them comes with an unfortunate list of weaknesses. Stealth Rock hinders Walrein's ability to tank attacks, as taking 25% damage each time it comes in will wear it down fast. Even with these drawbacks considered, Walrein is a fine tank in OU play with handy resistances to Ice- and Water-type attacks and respectable offensive stats for a predominantly defensive Pokemon.</p> <p>Back in ADV, the sight of Walrein in OU matches was rare, to say the least. However, with its cool new Ice Body ability, it can be a very useful--often integral--part of a hail-based team with support from Abomasnow. Walrein's stalling abilities with hail support are impressive and with Toxic or Toxic Spikes it can be surprisingly difficult to take down. Overall, Walrein got some very useful boosts in the transition from ADV to DPP, making it suitable for use in the OU environment.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Walrein has a few options worth noting from its respectably diverse movepool. Stockpile is available if you wish to boost both of Walrein's defenses, although Walrein has better things to be doing. Hidden Power Electric works okay alongside Blizzard, hitting Water-types for reasonable damage, especially Gyarados. Walrein can run a RestTalk set with Thick Fat, but its poor defensive typing and weakness to Stealth Rock make the set's viability questionable. Walrein can also run a Curse set to further boost its decent Attack and Defense, but Snorlax and Swampert do this job better. The only distinct advantage Walrein has over the former two is that nothing is immune to Avalanche. Lastly, Encore can be used to force switches and set up on the opponent's Pokemon. Roar is probably the better option, though, since it has more PP and can bring out something Walrein fares well against. Thick Fat can replace Ice Body pretty much anywhere, but then you're better off using other bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Vaporeon or Suicune. Brine is also a nice attacking move in tandem with Super Fang.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Since Walrein relies on poison to deal damage, most Steel-types will cause problems. Jirachi and Metagross have the defenses to take a few hits even from Earthquake and strike back with powerful attacks of their own; however, unless they carry Leftovers, both of these lose in the long run against Walrein. Empoleon can also Roar away Walrein's Substitute, but rarely has enough Speed EVs to ensure it will phaze Walrein before being phazed itself. If they come in before Walrein sets up a Substitute, Lucario and Machamp can scare away Walrein with their high-powered STAB moves.</p> <p>Tyranitar screws up Walrein's Leftovers recovery and replaces hail with sandstorm, making Ice Body useless. Gyarados can sponge hits from Ice- and Water-type attacks and set up with Dragon Dance before KOing Walrein with Stone Edge. Like Tyranitar, Gyarados also has access to Taunt. Suicune is faster than Walrein, can easily Roar it out, and takes minimal damage from any of the Walrein's attacks. Clefable is immune to the effects of hail and poison and can Encore Walrein's attacks, making it particularly problematic despite being rare in OU. Breloom is another issue if you don't have Blizzard, since it, like Clefable, is still able to recover HP during hail and can't be worn down by poison, thanks to its Poison Heal ability.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Stallrein (Toxic Stall)",
        "description": "<p>This set is based around taking advantage of Walrein's Ice Body ability and using it to stall turns.This set needs to be partnered with Abomasnow to get a constant stream of hail going. With Ice Body activated and Leftovers equipped, Walrein can alternate between Substitute and Protect, without losing any health, forcing the opponent to suffer up to 32 turns of hail and other residual damage.</p> <p>Poisoning the opponent is key to this set's success. Once Walrein has afflicted an opponent with Toxic, the stalling can commence. Simply alternate between Protect and Substitute (there is no net change in your health), healing yourself and intensifying the poison damage each turn, draining your opponent of its HP. This is the direct approach. There is another way to do this, however, but it requires some additional support. Adding a Toxic Spikes user such as Forretress or Tentacruel into the mix can really add to this set's effectiveness. Bear in mind that if you are unable to get both layers of Toxic Spikes in play, you will be inflicting the weaker variety of poison, making stalling the opponent out a slightly slower process.</p> <p>With Toxic Spikes support, Walrein can afford to drop Toxic from its moveset. However, if you keep it, Walrein will be able to poison Flying-type Pokemon and Pokemon with Levitate. Other than Toxic, you have a couple of options to use in its place. Roar works if your team is in need of a phazer and also has applications more specific to this set. First of all, you can shuffle opponents around to let Toxic Spikes take effect. Secondly, you can prevent Swampert from Roaring your Substitute away by Roaring it out first. Having Roar also means that Gyarados cannot simply Dragon Dance in Walrein's face and forces it to take even more residual damage upon re-entry. Earthquake is a great choice to hit Poison-types like Tentacruel that like to ruin your set-up by coming in to absorb Toxic Spikes. It also helps to wear down Steel-types, which are immune to poison. Super Fang can also be used to slice the opponent's HP in half. This ultimately makes the stalling process much faster with Toxic Spikes down. Finally, you have your choice of STAB move so Walrein's respectable Special Attack doesn't go to waste. Surf helps to wear down Tyranitar, whose ability to change the weather is a real pain. Surf also hits Steel-types for neutral damage and has the potential to 2HKO Forretress, whose immunity to Toxic and access to Rapid Spin can ruin Walrein's strategy. It also has a lot more PP than Blizzard, meaning that Walrein won't be quite so vulnerable to Taunt. Blizzard is still a worthy option, however, as it provides Walrein with good attacking coverage and smacks around most Flying-, Grass-, and Poison-types many of whom are immune to Toxic Spikes or the poison status altogether.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, Abomasnow is absolutely required in order to take full advantage of Walrein's ability. Since Walrein is normally used with hail, Abomasnow could support the entire team as a whole. Toxic Spikes will allow Walrein to more effectively stall out the opponent, so partnering Walrein with a user of them is a good strategy. Tentacruel and Forretress can reliably place down Toxic Spikes while also providing Rapid Spin support. Rapid Spin removes Stealth Rock from the field, allowing Walrein to come in without taking a quarter of its HP in damage.</p> <p>232 HP EVs ensure that Walrein's HP stat leaves the same remainder when divided by 16 and 4, which guarantees that all of the damage it takes from using Substitute is restored in two turns. Bearing this in mind, the EVs give Walrein the best possible overall defenses. Speed EVs can be used on Walrein in order to foil some common phazers such as Skarmory and Vaporeon. However, this might reduce Walrein's overall physical tanking abilities, albeit not by too much. More importantly, though, not investing in Speed ensures that Walrein is slower than standard Choice Band Scizor, which would otherwise break Walrein's Substitute while switching out to a faster Pokemon, thus breaking the stall.</p> <p>Tyranitar gives Walrein a world of trouble by removing hail and packing high-powered Rock-type attacks. Swampert can keep Tyranitar at bay, and can also set up Stealth Rock for added residual damage. Walrein's typing gives it an undesirable weakness to a number of commonly used attacks. Fighting-types who are immune to poison, such as RestTalk Machamp, can beat Walrein with their STAB attacks. Gyarados can also be a problem with Taunt, an immunity to Toxic Spikes, and the ability to then set up on Walrein. Having a Rotom-A on your team will compensate for these issues extremely well. Rotom-A can check and beat Gyarados, take the Fighting-type attacks aimed at Walrein, and also block Rapid Spin attempts from Pokemon like Forretress.</p> "

An excellent stat distribution (including a devastating Attack), coupled with great typing create a Pokemon that any team needs to be ready for. Top this all off with a more-than-usable ability that nullifies Intimidate, and you have a Pokemon that will always be remembered as a DPP OU staple.</p> <p>Metagross fills a certain niche that gains it consistent usage in the lead spot, where it can make use of Stealth Rock, reliable STAB, priority, and Explosion. Its respectable defenses allow it to effortlessly come in on moves it resists and wreak havoc. The only stat that really leaves you wanting more is Speed, which can be made up for due to Metagross's access to stat-boosting moves in Agility and Rock Polish. As with any Pokemon, it can run into problems (such as being weak to the omnipresent Earthquake), but Metagross remains reliable due to its knack for fulfilling certain duties in a variety of roles.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>HP and Attack are generally the stats you will want to prioritize, but some Speed is fine in order to beat Skarmory or other Metagross. Zen Headbutt fits on most sets in order to take out Rotom-A. Iron Head has a nice flinch rate, and warrants use over Meteor Mash also because of its perfect accuracy. Icy Wind is a usable option, and can be useful on a special-based set over Ice Punch. It also deals with Metagross's Speed, while retaining coverage on Gliscor and Dragon-types. The main problem is that it is just a little on the weak side.</p> <p>Other than that, movepool options are scarce. Gyro Ball is unreliable even with STAB and Metagross's low Speed, as Metagross's counters are generally slow. Hammer Arm warrants use on some sets, but its only real potential is against Magnet Rise Magnezone, making it therefore a little too situational. Psych Up is another situational move, but allows you to take on Curse Snorlax or even the rare Regirock. Magnet Rise can get rid of Metagross's Ground-type weakness, but still leaves it vulnerable to Fire-type moves and doesn't complement its low Speed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Rotom-A is the perfect counter to Metagross. Rotom-A resists all of Metagross's main attacking options while also being immune to Explosion and Earthquake. Rotom-A can immediately threaten Metagross with Will-O-Wisp, who obviously won't enjoy being burned, or stall through Rest + Sleep Talk if needed. Rotom-H can also severely weaken Metagross with Overheat; in fact, minimum Special Attack Rotom-H stands a small chance of 2HKOing Metagross with Overheat, provided Metagross has taken previous damage from Stealth Rock. Choice Band Zen Headbutt will pack a punch on Rotom-A though, so be wary of that as well as the Trick + Iron Ball set.</p> <p>Skarmory fears next to nothing from Metagross, barring the occasional Choice Band Thunder Punch or Hidden Power Fire. Because of this, Skarmory can easily set up Spikes or Whirlwind Metagross out, depending on what the situation calls for. Bronzong also fares well, and can even do some damage with Earthquake. Forretress works similarly to these other Steel-types, but can be hit by a powerful Earthquake from Metagross. Zapdos also resists some of the main attacking options, and can threaten with Heat Wave. Again, Trick + Iron Ball beats most of these common counters, so be wary.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types can often be problematic, but they fear both Thunder Punch and Explosion. Bulky Ground-types work even better, and most can easily do a lot of damage back with Earthquake. Hippowdon and Swampert fear Grass Knot though, while Ice Punch will quickly eliminate Gliscor.</p> <p>Magnezone is obviously a problem should it get a Magnet Rise off before Metagross can use Earthquake, as it will then take pittance from whatever else Metagross shells out. Due to its ability, Magnezone can also trap Metagross, meaning it will probably be able to get the kill in such a scenario.</p> ",

As for the move choice in the second slot, Earthquake allows Metagross to have greater coverage, but Meteor Mash is incredibly useful to hit with a strong STAB and pose a huge threat early on, should you obtain an Attack boost.</p> <p>Bullet Punch is useful here in conjunction with Metagross's lower Speed, as it allows you to pick off the all-too-common users of Focus Sash.

Lum Berry is the preferred item here as it allows you to handle sleep-inducing leads in addition to Machamp, but Occa Berry helps against some Fire-types, such as Infernape. However, you will still lose to Heatran in this case.</p> <p>Earthquake can be used on this set over Stealth Rock in order to run a pure attacking lead set that trumps a few more leads than it otherwise would. Earthquake hits Steel- and Fire-types such as Metagross, Jirachi, and Heatran; Heatran, however, is only beaten if it uses Stealth Rock on the first turn due to the commonly used Shuca Berry. If packing Occa Berry, Earthquake also allows Metagross to beat Infernape leads. If you choose Occa Berry to beat Infernape leads, though, Metagross loses the ability to beat Roserade, Gengar, and Smeargle leads that will put it to sleep.</p> <p>4 Speed EVs are all you'll need, but if you wish to raise your Speed even more, 40 EVs from Attack can be moved there. HP is maximized to complement the natural bulkiness of Metagross, while the EVs from Attack guarantee your STAB and Explosion are going to hit like a truck. An Adamant nature is preferred, as you don't need any help in Speed due to the inclusion of a priority move, and the bonus to Attack is incredibly useful.</p> <p>Trick can be used over Bullet Punch on this set with a Choice Scarf and max Speed. This allows you to outspeed usual threats such as Azelf and 2HKO, or cripple bulkier leads such as Swampert. However, this is generally not advised, as most leads are more easily dealt with by the primary set. It is also optional to use Ice Punch and a Shuca Berry. This prevents Dragonite's Earthquake from being a problem and also allows you to fare well against Shaymin.</p> <p>Heatran will be a problem no matter which item and move combination you pick. Bulkier leads such as Hippowdon and Swampert are also problematic, as although they can be dealt with by Explosion, this requires you to sacrifice Metagross. If you choose Lum Berry, Starmie makes a great partner, as it can Rapid Spin away any entry hazards that you could not stop, while also dealing with Heatran and Hippowdon. Starmie also is a good switch-in to Swampert and Infernape. A bulkier RestTalking Rotom-A works well in conjunction with Occa Berry Metagross, as it can absorb the status inflicted by sleep leads and is immune to Explosion and Rapid Spin.</p> "

        "name": "Agility",
        "description": "<p>The only stat that Metagross is really lacking in is Speed, which can be remedied by Agility. After merely one boost, Metagross is more than capable of ripping through teams late-game, where most useful resistances have been taken out or significantly weakened. Due to Metagross's huge Attack, sweeping at +2 Speed will be an easy task if the game has been played well so far.</p> <p>Agility is a necessity here to boost Metagross's Speed and set the stage for a potential sweep. Meteor Mash is the best STAB option, due to its naturally high Base Power. Earthquake provides fantastic coverage alongside Meteor Mash, as most Pokemon resistant to Steel will take a heavy hit from Earthquake. Thunder Punch is the preferred option to pick off threats such as Gyarados or bulky Water-types, but Zen Headbutt is perfectly viable in order to hit Rotom-A. Life Orb is the obvious choice here, especially with the high Speed you will have, but Leftovers is usable. Lum Berry is also a viable option, as it allows you to set up on someone who thinks he will be able to status you.</p> <p>The EVs provided allow you to reach a Life Orb number and outspeed Choice Scarf Rotom-A after an Agility, if you choose an Adamant nature. While a bulkier spread with Leftovers can be used, it is generally the inferior option. A Jolly nature is incredibly useful, as without it, Choice Scarf Flygon will have no problem coming in to revenge kill.</p> <p>Explosion or Ice Punch can be used on this set. Explosion is especially useful, as it may net you a kill that would otherwise have been impossible. However, since Metagross needs to be sweeping, it is hampered by the lack of coverage from Explosion. Ice Punch generally provides redundant coverage, but can be useful against Gliscor.</p> <p>When using this set, it is important to keep in mind that Pokemon who are resistant to Metagross's moves will have an easier time against this set in comparison to Choice Band, as the damage output is reduced greatly. For this reason, physically bulky Pokemon will do a nice job of walling this set, and ones with access to Thunder Wave can essentially render it useless. Scizor makes a good partner for these reasons, as it can use U-turn and allow Metagross to come in at an opportune moment. Celebi can greatly threaten the bulky Water-types you will have trouble with (should you forgo Thunder Punch), while Infernape can be reliable in handling Rotom-A if you do not use Zen Headbutt.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf, Metagross deals with its Speed problems without having to boost via Agility. This Metagross can serve as a great revenge killer, and often it can net pivotal surprise kills. Meteor Mash is obvious as it is the best option in terms of STAB, while Earthquake greatly damages Fire- and Steel- types. Thunder Punch is helpful, as it allows you to dispose of Gyarados (even after a Dragon Dance), but Zen Headbutt threatens Rotom-A. Explosion is the recommended option in the last slot, as the extra Speed provided here allows you to net one last kill should you be at low health. Trick is viable though, as it can cripple a wall who your team just can't break.</p> <p>It is worth mentioning that this set can function in Ubers. With a Choice Scarf, Metagross outspeeds Latias and Latios, and it can take Rayquaza's Outrage and immediately proceed to KO with Ice Punch. Explosion also proves useful in dealing with Calm Mind Kyogre.</p> <p>Attack and Speed are maxed out to deal the most amount of damage in the quickest possible manner. Metagross passes the 130 Speed mark, meaning it can deal with Infernape, Gengar, and Gyarados handily. As was previously mentioned, Ice Punch can be used in the last slot, but it is usually only useful in Ubers. This set has a lower damage output, so it must rely on a certain element of surprise. However, once your opponent learns Metagross has a Choice Scarf, don't rely on them making the same mistake again.</p> "

Zen Headbutt rounds off the coverage nicely, but Bullet Punch is an option to pick off weakened Azelf or Gengar. Trick is an interesting option, but it generally fits better on a Choice Scarf set. If coverage is absolutely necessary, Explosion can be dropped to accommodate both Zen Headbutt and Bullet Punch, although this is not recommended.</p> <p>The EVs maximize both Metagross's damage output and ability to dish it out.

Skarmory and Forretress aren't hurt terribly either, and bulky Ground-types are in the same boat. Rotom-A and Zapdos are resistant to most of the attacks here.

Should Rotom-A switch in and attempt to burn Metagross, it can easily retaliate with Psychic for the surprise KO. Meteor Mash remains, and should you decide to forgo Hidden Power Fire, Earthquake can be used for slightly different coverage (most notably, exchanging the ability to hit Skarmory in order to batter Heatran). Grass Knot allows Metagross to take on bulky Water- and Ground-types without fear, but Bullet Punch can be used if you are absolutely paranoid about its Speed.</p> <p>The EVs provided allow Metagross to outspeed Choice Band Scizor, while complementing its excellent bulk. They also provide great special attacking potential. Leftovers is the preferred option, as you don't lose any notable kills, and Metagross's life span is lengthened once again. Expert Belt is still an option though if you wish to up the damage output a bit. Hammer Arm can be used to beat Blissey and, if you chose Hidden Power Fire, Heatran.</p> <p>This Metagross is excellent at finding, luring out, and killing usual threats.

This particular set aims to make use of Metagross's high Attack rather than its low Special Attack. Trick combined with Iron Ball forms the core of this set, as it leaves the aforementioned common threats susceptible to Ground-type moves. This means that the great type coverage provided by Earthquake and Meteor Mash gets even better.</p> <p>The last slot is up for grabs. Explosion OHKOes almost any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, courtesy of Metagross's mammoth Attack. However, since this Metagross aims at being a utility counter, it may be more potent when it's not using Explosion. For this reason, Stealth Rock can be used to support the rest of the team.</p> <p>20 Speed EVs allow Metagross to outspeed base 115s after they have been Tricked an Iron Ball. Maximum Attack is also a given to deal as much possible damage via Earthquake. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP to complement Metagross's natural bulk. Iron Ball is the necessary choice for item, while an Adamant nature is useful for higher damage output. With poor prediction, this set will face difficulty against Heatran. While Earthquake can keep it at bay, it can easily come in on a Meteor Mash and proceed to pick off Metagross.</p> <p>The best teammates to this set are Pokemon that prefer to have Skarmory and Rotom-A gone, considering how well this set lures and eliminates them. Gyarados will have a much easier time setting up and maintaining a sweep with Rotom-A removed; Mamoswine will fare much better once Skarmory is gone. If Heatran does prove to be a problem, bulky Water-types can be used as a solution.</p> "

  "Latias": {
    "overview": "<p>Latias is the only Dragon / Psychic type in the tier, which means that it's an answer to Fighting-, Fire-, Water-, Grass-, Electric-, and Psychic-types. The combination of all these resistances is unique to only Latias and allows it to answer potent wallbreakers like Infernape and Breloom, which very few Pokemon can do. Furthermore, it's completely immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes thanks to Levitate, and it's also not weak to Stealth Rock, which means it's more resistant to all entry hazards than most Pokemon. Latias has such a vast array of move options that it can perform many different roles. With all these traits, Latias boasts near-unparalleled role compression, allowing it to fit wonderfully on almost any team and pair well with almost every Pokemon individually. Its stats are also nothing to scoff at, with monstrous Special Defense as well as impressive Special Attack and Speed.</p> <p>The main thing that holds Latias back is its susceptibility to Tyranitar, which can switch in, take Latias's Draco Meteor or even Surf, and trap it with Pursuit while threatening a powerful STAB-boosted Crunch. Latias's presence means Tyranitar is often equipped with increased Special Defense investment, which can allow it to take even a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor when healthy and still survive another one. Latias can also have a very hard time versus many Steel-types like Jirachi, Bronzong, Metagross, Empoleon, and even Magnezone, which can take a Draco Meteor or Surf decently well provided that Latias doesn't hold Choice Specs. Even if Latias forces a KO with its strong Draco Meteor, Tyranitar can easily revenge kill it, or another Pokemon can take advantage of Latias's lowered Special Attack. Besides Tyranitar and Steel-types, bulky special walls like Blissey and Clefable can take any attack and have high potential to force Latias out with the threat of a status move or chip damage from Seismic Toss and Ice Beam.</p> <p>It's not all black and white, however, because Latias's astronomical movepool enables creativity and counterplay to its common checks with moves like Trick and Thunder Wave. While Latias cannot avoid its biggest flaw, which is its susceptibility to some of the top threats in the OU metagame compared to other Pokemon, it has so many positive attributes that it's a fantastic fit on almost any team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Latias has one of the largest movepools in the tier, and combined with its incredible typing and stats, it has the potential to utilize a tremendous number of different strategies. A Trick + Flame Orb set can be extremely effective in the lead slot for its longevity, good lead matchups versus Pokemon like Machamp and Metagross, and its unexpected first-turn Trick that will often cripple a foe from the get-go. A Calm Mind + 3 Attacks set can be used with Dragon Pulse, Surf, and Hidden Power Fire, but the lack of recovery and utility is tough and makes this set hard to use. Latias is a great option for setting up Rain Dance thanks to its great role compression and typing. It can utilize Thunder alongside Rain Dance to do as much damage to Skarmory as possible. Latias can also use Sunny Day, but it won't be able to run Surf or Thunder alongside it, and other Pokemon are probably better at using it. Latias can be a dedicated support slot by opting for a Light Screen + Reflect set to support setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Gyarados, and Tyranitar, as well as Calm Mind users like Suicune and Jirachi. Psychic is an alternative STAB move, but this will probably require additional support from Magnezone because Steel-types resist it and other coverage moves are usually better. A Safeguard + Calm Mind set has some potential with support from Magnezone, but it's unreliable because it still has issues beating Jirachi and Clefable. Toxic can be used to inflict a surprise status ailment on Hippowdon, Tyranitar, Milotic, and Zapdos, but it's usually not worth the slot. Charge Beam is a possible alternative to Calm Mind to make room for additional coverage, but it's not guaranteed to increase Latias's Special Attack, making it inferior to Calm Mind. Dragon Breath is an interesting choice on a bulky set to compress both Thunder Wave and Dragon Pulse together while also granting additional PP, but it's significantly weaker than Dragon Pulse and also only has a 30% chance to inflict paralysis. Protect can be used, potentially alongside Wish, to scout Choice item Pokemon like Tyranitar, Flygon, and Rotom.</p> <p>Some of the crazier options available are quite interesting. Sucker Punch can be used as a surprise priority move that hits Choice Scarf Rotom-A, offensive Starmie, and Gengar; using this move with Hidden Power Fire can actually make the opponent believe Gengar will always outspeed Latias, so it can work as an interesting bait. Whirlpool can be used to trap Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Heatran for a few turns, which may enable Latias to pivot out to a trapper like Magnezone, but this move is extremely gimmicky. Mist Ball is an alternative to Psychic that has a 50% chance to lower the opposing Pokemon's Special Attack, but it only has 8 PP, which makes it significantly less viable. Shadow Ball can be used to hit Rotom-A as hard as possible without reducing Latias's Special Attack, but it's inferior to stronger coverage moves. Latias can opt for some physical moves like Earthquake and Outrage to catch Heatran and Clefable by surprise, but every other Dragon-type is better at doing this. Psycho Shift can be used on Sleep Talk sets to pass its status to another Pokemon, but Latias usually prefers a more consistent option, since Sleep Talk can only be used once while holding a Choice item. Finally, Role Play is a bizarre option that copies a foe's ability, which is best used on Pokemon like Clefable, Suicune, Zapdos, and Heatran to copy either Magic Guard, Pressure, or Flash Fire, but it's very difficult to fit onto a moveset in favor of other utility moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Tyranitar: Tyranitar has tremendous special bulk that it can use to take any of Latias's attacks most of the time and can threaten Latias with Pursuit and Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Jirachi, Metagross, Heatran, Bronzong, Magnezone, and Empoleon can all take a Draco Meteor or Dragon Pulse quite well and threaten Latias with a variety of attacks. Hidden Power Fire and Surf are Latias's best overall weapons to hit Steel-types consistently, so usually Latias will have trouble versus teams with multiple Steel-types. However, it can still use a variety of moves that may harm these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Clefable: Blissey and Clefable have tremendous special bulk and can take even a Draco Meteor quite well and potentially cripple Latias with Thunder Wave. Blissey may also use Toxic, and Clefable can remove Latias's item with Knock Off or hinder its setup with Encore. Both of these Pokemon have to be cautious about Trick, since receiving a Choice item completely cripples them. Clefable will be extremely unreliable versus Modest Latias, which has a much more powerful Draco Meteor that is likely to 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Choice Scarf Rotom-A, Choice Scarf Flygon, Gengar, Starmie, and even Weavile can give Latias some issues by outspeeding and threatening it with powerful, super effective moves. Starmie won't be able to OHKO Latias but can cripple it with Thunder Wave. Choice Scarf Rotom-A usually wants some chip damage before it uses Shadow Ball on Latias and also needs to be careful of Tyranitar.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Latias's Draco Meteor is the strongest in DPP OU, and the Choice Specs set takes advantage of this by powering it up as much as possible without having to set up with Calm Mind. Anything that doesn't resist the move, excluding Blissey, will take a large chunk of damage; even some of the frailer Pokemon that resist it like Lucario can take upwards of 75% from just one.</p> <p>Dragon Pulse is nice for taking advantage of Latias's devastating Dragon-type STAB without lowering its Special Attack with each use. Hidden Power Fire is an alternative to super effectively hit meddling Steel-types like Scizor, Jirachi, Metagross, and Bronzong for as much damage as possible. Also, when opting for Sleep Talk, Dragon Pulse should always be used instead of Hidden Power Fire because Sleep Talk fails after one use with a Choice item on hand in DPP, and it wants to use Dragon-type attacks as consistently as possible.</p> <p>Surf hits most Steel-types with neutral damage, hits Heatran super effectively, and hits hard enough with Choice Specs to do decent damage to all offensive Jirachi variants, Metagross, and even Bronzong. Water- and Dragon-type attacks boast nearly perfect coverage; Empoleon is the only Pokemon that resists both types, and it will still take a ton of damage from Draco Meteor or even Dragon Pulse unless it is a specially defensive variant.</p> <p>Trick is a wonderful option to cripple opposing Blissey and Clefable on the switch. It can also cripple threats like specially defensive Jirachi and bulkier variants of Bronzong. Alternatively, if you don't have a sleep absorber, Sleep Talk fits wonderfully on Latias, as it resists the typical attacks from the most common sleep inducers in the metagame, Breloom and Roserade. This comes with a risk, however, of Breloom using Substitute before Spore or Roserade using Stun Spore; rarely, Roserade can use moves like Hidden Power Ice or even Sludge Bomb, which deal a decent amount of damage to Latias. Because Latias has such potent coverage via its Dragon-type attacks and Surf alone, it is still difficult to switch into even while it's asleep. Sleep Talk + Trick is actually a nice combination because it allows Latias to use Sleep Talk again if it uses Trick during its first turn of sleep.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Special Attack and Speed are maximized to make Latias as powerful and as fast as possible, which maximizes its effectiveness as a Choice Specs user. A Timid nature is recommended to outspeed crucial threats like Infernape, Jirachi, Shaymin, and non-Choice Scarf Flygon; it can also let Latias Speed tie with Gengar, which is very significant. However, note that by opting for Hidden Power Fire, Latias will be slower than Gengar.</p> <p>Alternatively, a Modest nature turns Latias into a terrifying powerhouse at the cost of being slower than Infernape, Gengar, and potentially other base 100 Speed Pokemon. Tyranitar needs to have great investment in bulk to survive two Draco Meteors from Modest Choice Specs Latias, especially after Stealth Rock damage. Clefable also can't switch in nearly as safely, as with a Modest nature, Draco Meteor is quite likely to 2HKO it. The increased damage rolls also are quite favorable versus many variants of Jirachi, so Modest Latias can actually function as a stallbreaker. Dragon Pulse becomes quite strong and can go as far as to 3HKO certain offensive variants of Jirachi. In reality, Infernape is the biggest loss when opting for Modest, so this nature can be fantastic if your team covers Infernape extremely well.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to chip Tyranitar as much as possible with supporting teammates so it's more difficult for it to switch in safely and trap Latias with Pursuit. Use Latias's incredible typing to pivot into resisted attacks, and take advantage of double switches early-game to keep it safe from Tyranitar. Try to scout as much as possible before you unleash Draco Meteor, because after a Special Attack drop, Steel-types and even some bulkier sweepers like Dragon Dance Tyranitar can take advantage of Latias. Using Surf early on will allow Latias to hit Steel-types that switch in to eat a Dragon-type attack; this notably will often catch Heatran. When using Trick, you can consider using it early on versus noticeably bulky builds with Pokemon like Hippowdon and Clefable to catch your opponent by surprise and immediately cripple their long-lasting wall, but these builds can also have Choice Scarf Tyranitar, so you'll have to verify that it isn't in the picture if you don't want to risk getting trapped. Hidden Power Fire will often catch Jirachi, Metagross, and Bronzong off guard, especially early-game. Levitate is extremely useful, so take advantage of it by punishing bad locks like Earthquake from Choice Scarf Flygon or Choice Band Swampert. Because of its many resistances, Latias can also punish many locks like Thunderbolt from Choice Scarf Rotom-A and even Fire Punch from Choice Scarf Jirachi.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Specs Latias doesn't need too much support, but anything that assists in wearing down Tyranitar and Steel-types will be especially beneficial. Magnezone traps pesky Steel-types, which makes Latias's Draco Meteor that much more threatening. Also, Tyranitar will frequently switch into Magnezone to take its powerful Thunderbolt, which will put it in a good range for Latias to feel more comfortable staying in. Your own Tyranitar can support Latias wonderfully by using Pursuit to trap revenge killers like Choice Scarf Rotom-A and opposing Choice Scarf Latias. Swampert has strong offensive synergy with Latias, and it can also switch into Jirachi, Metagross, Bronzong, and Heatran and threaten them with its STAB Earthquake and Waterfall; Skarmory will also be baited in and pressured by Waterfall and even the occasional Hydro Pump. Latias in turn supports Swampert defensively, as it resists Grass-type attacks aimed at Swampert and can absorb sleep from Breloom and Roserade, two Pokemon that Swampert detests. Pokemon like Bronzong, Zapdos, and Gliscor are very effective versus Flygon, which can give Latias some trouble with its threatening Choice Scarf set. Steel-types pair very well with Latias by switching into Dragon-type attacks aimed at it, while Latias covers their Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type weaknesses. Lucario has incredible offensive synergy with Latias, and the Choice Specs set assists Lucario by wearing down its checks and having Tyranitar lock itself into Pursuit so Lucario can set up Swords Dance freely.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With a high Speed tier, excellent Special Attack, decent bulk, and great typing, Latias can function as a solid revenge killer. Draco Meteor is Latias's most powerful attack, which it needs in order to hit as hard as possible and to revenge kill Pokemon like Flygon, Dragonite, Kingdra, and even Gengar. Even without Choice Specs or Life Orb, Latias's Draco Meteor is still extremely powerful, and almost nothing will enjoy switching into it.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is preferred in the second slot to revenge kill Dragon Dance Gyarados, and it makes for more consistency against Skarmory and Water-types like Suicune and Milotic. Be aware, however, that Thunderbolt can be an exploitable lock because Ground-types can come in and force Latias out. Alternatively, after using Trick to give up its Choice Scarf, Latias can take advantage of Thunder Wave to cripple foes like Jirachi, Heatran, and Metagross, as well as Recover, which can be a cool option to improve its overall longevity.</p> <p>Trick is a great choice on Choice Scarf Latias to cripple threats that otherwise completely wall it. Blissey, Clefable, bulkier Tyranitar variants, and even specially defensive Jirachi will all despise receiving a Choice Scarf.</p> <p>Healing Wish is a fantastic option on Latias, especially for more offensive teams, to restore a weakened teammate. Since Choice Scarf Latias forces many switches, it can effectively use Healing Wish on the switch, allowing its teammate to come in safely. Alternatively, Surf combines very well with Latias's Dragon-type STAB attack to give it almost completely unresisted offensive coverage that is resisted only by Empoleon. Surf also hits Heatran super effectively, which would otherwise come in on Choice Scarf Latias quite easily. Even then, Surf shouldn't do a large amount of damage to Heatran, especially bulkier ones, but it's Latias's best practical weapon against it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Latias's Special Attack and Speed are maximized to make it as powerful and as fast as possible with Choice Scarf, even outspeeding threats as fast as +2 Agility Metagross and +2 Dragon Dance Tyranitar; note, however, that Latias cannot properly revenge kill Tyranitar unless it's significantly weakened. If not using Trick, Latias can opt for some arbitrary bulk with a spread of 80 HP / 252 SpA / 176 Spe, but it may lose out on outspeeding +2 Agility Metagross. Although this isn't too big of a deal, since Latias cannot deal that much damage to it regardless, it's advised to not forego Trick on teams that may have difficulty with Metagross.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to conserve Choice Scarf Latias for as long as possible so that it's around to revenge kill late-game Dragon Dance sweepers or even shut down other setup sweepers like Calm Mind Suicune and Calm Mind Clefable with Trick. Use double switches to your advantage to try to avoid Tyranitar Pursuit trapping Latias. Be particularly careful when using Draco Meteor, because after a Special Attack drop, Latias will be very weak and can be exploited by a large portion of the metagame. Try to wear down Steel-types with teammates so that it's harder for the opponent to play around Latias.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since Choice Scarf Latias cannot revenge kill Swords Dance Lucario and Dragon Dance Tyranitar and is susceptible to Dragon Dance Dragonite's Extreme Speed, some additional support to check these sweepers is very beneficial. Shuca Berry Jirachi can check all three with Fire Punch, Iron Head, and Ice Punch; it can even serve as a secondary check to Gyarados with Thunderbolt, allowing Latias to opt for a different move like Sleep Talk or Recover. Infernape with Mach Punch or Vacuum Wave can revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Swords Dance Lucario and has nice offensive synergy with Latias. Lucario with Bullet Punch can function as a revenge killer for Dragon Dance Tyranitar and even use its Extreme Speed to give Dragonite trouble. Latias and Lucario are a wonderful offensive pair in general with immaculate type synergy, and they each give each other opportunities very well via locking a Tyranitar into Pursuit for Lucario and taking advantage of Tyranitar and chipping Jirachi for Latias. Anything that assists in wearing down Tyranitar will give Latias significantly more freedom to come in and revenge kill opposing Pokemon with less risk. Magnezone can both chip down Tyranitar with its Thunderbolt and trap Steel-types that check Latias, especially Scizor, which can come in and threaten to trap it with Pursuit or do massive damage with its powerful Bullet Punch. Rotom-A can use Will-O-Wisp to bait and cripple Tyranitar with a burn. Heatran can also do the same thing with Will-O-Wisp or even Toxic. Roserade and Nidoqueen can provide Toxic Spikes support, which can poison Tyranitar on the switch, giving Latias a bit more breathing room.</p> "

        "name": "Reflect",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This set takes advantage of Latias's incredible defensive typing and promotes longevity and supporting its teammates with moves like Thunder Wave, Wish, and Reflect. Thunder Wave is great for slowing down many offensive threats like Jirachi, Metagross, Infernape, Rotom-A, and Zapdos. It can also support slower stallbreakers like Breloom, Metagross, Machamp, and Swampert, which compensates for this set's overall weakness to defensive Pokemon like Clefable and Skarmory. Wish is an alternative option on some balanced cores to keep teammates healthy and help them pivot in more easily.</p> <p>Dragon Pulse is Latias's most reliable STAB attack on bulkier sets and will dent Dragon-types like Dragonite, Flygon, and Kingdra while only being resisted by Steel-types. Psywave is an interesting alternative for more consistent damage to Steel-types, particularly Metagross and Bronzong, which in combination with Reflect can actually allow Latias to win the one-on-one matchup versus these Pokemon. The big downside to Psywave is the loss of large damage versus opposing Dragon-types and frailer offensive threats like Infernape and Breloom, and Dark-types like Tyranitar are completely immune to it.</p> <p>Reflect is fantastic to support your team against powerful physical attackers like Lucario, Infernape, Flygon, and Tyranitar. By using Reflect, Latias has much more counterplay against Tyranitar, allowing it to potentially paralyze Tyranitar and have an easier time escaping, thus allowing itself to take advantage of its wonderful typing longer.</p> <p>Recover is a staple to this set to keep Latias healthy for as long as possible via instant recovery. In tandem with Wish, Latias can recover massive amounts of health in a single turn; when used in combination with Thunder Wave, Latias can fish for full paralysis, which can allow it to get its health back a bit more easily.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Latias wants as much HP as possible to give it maximum general bulk. 96 Speed EVs are used to outpace Heatran and Adamant Lucario, allowing Latias to cripple two crucial threats with Thunder Wave. If opting for Wish, Latias should use Reflect versus Lucario first, but Thunder Wave is significantly more effective against it. The remaining EVs are poured into Defense with a Bold nature, which helps Latias take Close Combat from Infernape and Lucario as well as Tyranitar's attacks through Reflect as well as possible. Leftovers is used to grant Latias passive recovery to stay healthy for as long as possible. A spread of 252 HP / 188 Def / 68 Spe with a Timid nature is an option that sacrifices considerable physical bulk for outspeeding Pokemon like non-Choice Scarf Rotom-A, Impish Gliscor, neutral-natured Flygon and Zapdos, and potentially other bulky Latias. This sacrifices considerable physical bulk, however.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Latias can be extremely effective early-game by spreading status and forcing unexpected switches, which enables great scouting and facilitates opportunities to gain momentum. Paralyzing Tyranitar will be helpful if possible to increase Latias's survivability. You are nearly required to use Reflect if Tyranitar is in to give Latias the highest chance of successfully escaping. Try to target Metagross and Jirachi with Thunder Wave, but be careful with using it on Bronzong, as it makes Gyro Ball more powerful; however, using Reflect + Psywave in tandem is a great way to make life difficult for Bronzong. Beware of Explosion, however. Use Recover throughout the game to stay healthy. If opting for Wish, alternating between Wish and Recover is an effective way to keep Latias as healthy as possible. Use smart switches to take advantage of Wish support. You can bring Latias in on Swampert very easily, but you should be careful of an incoming Ice Punch or even Ice Beam.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Latias appreciates teammates that can help compensate for its weakness to defensive teams, Steel-types, and Tyranitar. Breloom is a great teammate that does well versus Tyranitar and can take advantage of Latias's paralysis support with its potent Superpower and Seed Bomb. Substitute + Focus Punch variants of Breloom can fish for paralysis and gain a positional advantage. Swampert is another fantastic teammate for its wonderful typing synergy and great offensive pressure with its STAB Water- and Ground-type attacks, as well as taking huge advantage of paralyzed foes. Gengar provides a nice Fighting-type immunity and an additional countermeasure to Infernape, and Substitute variants can fish for paralysis, much like Breloom. Metagross is a great pairing with Latias, as it has solid matchups versus Jirachi and Magnezone; in addition, Choice Scarf sets can threaten Lucario, many variants of Heatran, and even Skarmory with Trick. After using Trick, Metagross can still take advantage of Latias's paralysis support. Your own Lucario can opt for Ice Punch and take advantage of paralyzed targets like Zapdos and Jirachi. Latias and Lucario have immaculate synergy, and Latias really appreciates Lucario's support as a powerful end-game cleaner. Your own Tyranitar, particularly slower and bulkier variants like Choice Band and Custap Berry, will be very beneficial for trapping troublesome threats like Rotom-A and Starmie.</p> "

        "name": "Defensive Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Latias's natural bulk, incredible defensive typing, near-unresisted Dragon-type STAB coverage, and astronomical Special Defense allow it to effectively fill the niche of a defensive Calm Mind Pokemon. By increasing its Special Attack and Special Defense, Latias can better take attacks like Ice Beam and Shadow Ball from a myriad of Pokemon as well as more effectively shut down Zapdos and Water-types. Its Dragon Pulse, although not so strong with minimal Special Attack investment, will sting Pokemon that don't resist the attack, especially with a few boosts under its belt. Another downside to this move is its limited PP; however, it's the strongest choice for the set.</p> <p>Roar is extremely effective at phazing Steel-types and Tyranitar that try to come in and give Latias trouble, forcing them to take damage from entry hazards. Also, opposing Calm Mind users like Clefable, Suicune, and Jirachi will have a much tougher time against Latias due to being phazed as they try to set up. Refresh is an interesting alternative that allows Latias to cure status like poison from Toxic and burns from Will-O-Wisp, but it may struggle to cure paralysis because of Pokemon that take advantage of paralysis like Jirachi that will switch in and counter this set if they pack Iron Head.</p> <p>Substitute may be an interesting alternative to Refresh that directly blocks status moves from Pokemon like Heatran and slower variants of Celebi. Some Calm Mind boosts can also be enough to prevent Ice Beam from breaking Latias's Substitute, which reduces the threat of freeze. That said, Seismic Toss from Blissey and Clefable breaks Latias's Substitute, unlike other Substitute + Calm Mind users like Suicune and Jirachi. Although Substitute is better at blocking paralysis from slower Pokemon like bulky variants of Jirachi, Refresh does just as good of a job against a status-inducing Heatran, has more PP, and doesn't force Latias to use Recover as often. Recover is essential to keep it healthy and secure as many opportunities to set up and inflict pressure on the opposing team as possible.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Defensive Calm Mind Latias wants as much HP as possible for its overall bulk. Significant Defense investment and a Bold nature combined with this will give Latias the ability to take physical hits decently well while it boosts with Calm Mind. 56 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Modest Kingdra and Modest Calm Mind + Roar Suicune, allowing Latias to strike Kingdra with a Dragon Pulse first, as well as using Roar on Suicune first before it potentially is phazed. Leftovers is used to grant Latias passive recovery and prevent it from constantly losing health in sand or hail.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Calm Mind can be revealed early because it will likely be at the top of an opponent's suspicions if they notice that Latias has Leftovers. Latias can use it throughout the battle to consistently put pressure on the opponent with a strong Dragon Pulse or meddlesome Roar that can rack up entry hazard damage and allow you to scout the opposing team. Tyranitar will often switch into the battlefield, and chipping it with hazard damage will make it harder for it to safely enter, especially if Latias uses Calm Mind to boost its Special Attack. Although this Latias set has significant defensive investment, it will still be checked handily by Tyranitar via its powerful Crunch and Pursuit. Try to be somewhat conservative with Dragon Pulse's PP if you think you will need to enter a Calm Mind war later on. If you opt for Refresh, try to avoid paralysis, but feel free to stay in on moves like Toxic from Zapdos and Heatran. Use Recover throughout the battle to stay healthy so Latias can better utilize Calm Mind without the threat of being KOed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>With Roar, Latias will love additional entry hazards like Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Skarmory and Nidoqueen have excellent defensive synergy with Latias, and they can lay down their respective entry hazards for Latias to take advantage of. Blissey and Clefable also pair great defensively with Latias, and they can slow down opposing threats with Thunder Wave; Clefable can also use Knock Off to remove a foe's item, adding on to chip damage from entry hazards. Magnezone can be used to trap Steel-types like Bronzong and Choice Scarf Jirachi, which will also give Latias trouble. Rotom-A can be used to block Rapid Spin from Starmie or Forretress and can potentially bait in Tyranitar and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Choice Scarf Rotom-A can revenge kill setup sweepers like offensive Calm Mind Suicune and Taunt + Dragon Dance Gyarados. Heatran can thwart Scizor's attempt to damage Latias with Bullet Punch and set up Stealth Rock or cripple an opposing wall or Tyranitar with Toxic, which it does extremely effectively because its Fire-type attacks usually scare off opposing Steel-types. Roar variants can also take advantage of Spikes and Toxic Spikes alongside Latias, which assists in chipping Latias's checks.</p> "

        "name": "Calm Mind + 2 Attacks",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind + 2 Attacks Latias opts for an additional attacking move to give it better coverage. Calm Mind will boost its Special Attack and Special Defense, which makes it significantly harder for special attackers to take down with their super effective attacks. Dragon Pulse is recommended as the overall more consistent Dragon-type STAB attack, but Draco Meteor can be used for more immediate power to break threats like Rotom-A and Starmie. Draco Meteor has lower PP, however, and will require additional Calm Mind usage to compensate for the Special Attack drop.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire is recommended to super effectively hit Steel-types like Scizor, Jirachi, Bronzong, Skarmory, and Metagross for large chunks of damage after Calm Mind has been used, but Surf is a nice alternative for overall better coverage and super effective damage against Heatran. Recover keeps Latias healthy via instant healing and allows it to maximize its effectiveness as a Calm Mind user.</p> <p>An alternate set with Thunderbolt + Ice Beam as attacking moves is also quite strong. BoltBeam coverage targets threats like Skarmory, Starmie, Gyarados, Gliscor, Dragon-types, and additional Water-types like Suicune and Milotic super effectively, which can be terrifying on the proper team. This set usually requires a bit more support, as it will not have as much power without a Dragon-type STAB attack, and it will be worse versus other Steel-types that are more likely to come in like Jirachi, Metagross, and Bronzong.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Calm Mind + 2 Attacks Latias opts for maximum HP investment for overall bulk while maximizing Speed with a Timid nature to take advantage of its additional coverage and outspeed threats like Jirachi and Heatran. Leftovers is used for passive recovery and to offset sand damage, but Colbur Berry is a great alternative to take one Dark-type attack from Tyranitar or even a boosted Pursuit on the switch, which alleviates the pressure that Tyranitar puts on Latias only once.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to conceal the coverage move of choice when using this Latias, because it won't be expected, and you can consistently bait in Steel-type foes. If holding a Colbur Berry, you can bluff a Choice item and conceal Latias's identity as a Calm Mind sweeper. Alternate between Calm Mind and Recover to gradually boost Latias's stats while keeping it healthy. Try to use Calm Mind at least once, if opting for Draco Meteor, before you unleash an attack. If using a Colbur Berry and you predict a Pursuit from Tyranitar, you can use the switch to send a Pokemon in unscathed, but this can be risky. If using Surf, try to use it on a predicted Tyranitar switch to burn its Passho Berry or deal a decent chunk of damage, which can allow more comfort in potentially winning the one-on-one matchup with your Colbur Berry still intact. Use Calm Mind throughout the battle if holding Leftovers to consistently put pressure on the opposing team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Skarmory does an effective job at providing entry hazards for Latias to take advantage of, and it has nice defensive synergy with Latias with its ability to enter on Dark-, Dragon-, and Bug-type attacks aimed at Latias, while Latias comes in on Fire- and Electric-type attacks with ease. Tyranitar can deal with Choice Scarf Rotom-A and even trap it with Pursuit. Ground-immune Pokemon like Bronzong and Gliscor can do quite well versus Choice Scarf Flygon, which threatens to revenge kill Latias. Abomasnow provides coverage versus bulky Water-types like Swampert, Milotic, and Suicune, and it summons hail to negate passive Leftovers recovery from Steel-types, which will assist Latias in chipping them down with Hidden Power Fire or Surf. Zapdos also does a nice job at pressuring bulky Water-types and is a great answer to Flygon. Heatran can threaten Steel-types with its powerful Fire-type moves and has nice defensive synergy with Latias; Toxic variants can help cripple bulky Water-types and other bulky Pokemon like Hippowdon and opposing Latias.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Expert Belt",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Expert Belt allows Latias to bait in common checks, switch between its attacks, and use Grass Knot to take a huge chunk out of threats like the prevalent Swampert and the heavy Tyranitar. Draco Meteor is Latias's strongest attack, but it can be replaced with Dragon Pulse to give Latias more staying power. Draco Meteor, however, will be more effective versus Pokemon like Rotom-A, Celebi, and even more uncommon threats like Weavile.</p> <p>Grass Knot is what makes Expert Belt a unique set because Choice item sets don't have the room to properly accommodate the move. Grass Knot will do significantly more damage to Tyranitar and also accounts for the common possibility of Passho Berry, which will heavily reduce Surf's damage output once. With some chip damage, Latias can even use two Grass Knots—one as Tyranitar comes in—to take out Tyranitar on its own. Swampert can usually take one of Latias's attacks, but Grass Knot will destroy it. Grass Knot is also helpful for bulky Water-types like Milotic, Suicune, and Starmie.</p> <p>Surf goes incredibly well with Latias's Dragon-type STAB attack, and it's the best practical weapon versus Heatran, Infernape, and Gliscor. Water- and Dragon-type coverage is resisted only by Empoleon, which further supports Surf as a potent offensive option.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire is a nasty surprise to catch Scizor on the switch, and it also deals significant damage to other Steel-types like Jirachi, Magnezone, Lucario, Metagross, and Bronzong. Sleep Talk can be used over Hidden Power Fire to make Latias a sleep absorber that can use Sleep Talk more than once, but missing out on the additional coverage to hit Steel-types is unfortunate and fails to maximize Expert Belt Latias's effectiveness.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Special Attack and Speed are maximized to make this offensive Latias as fast and as powerful as possible. A Timid nature is used so that it outspeeds crucial threats like Jirachi, Shaymin, Infernape, and non-Choice Scarf Flygon, all of which Latias hits super effectively. Expert Belt takes advantage of the immaculate coverage from this four attack set and boosts damage for each super effective hit. Note that by opting for Hidden Power Fire, Latias will not Speed tie with Gengar.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to conceal Latias's moves for as long as possible. Use Expert Belt to your advantage to bluff a Choice item. This Latias isn't as afraid of Tyranitar as Choice item variants because it can sting Tyranitar harder with Grass Knot, effectively wearing it down. Like touched on before, Latias can even come out on top if it catches Tyranitar switching in with Grass Knot, especially with Stealth Rock support wearing Tyranitar down each time it enters. By bluffing a Choice item, Latias will be able to more consistently remove threats like Scizor and heavily damage foes like Heatran, Jirachi, Metagross, Bronzong, Magnezone, and Tyranitar with powerful, super effective moves. Use Latias's great typing to your advantage by pivoting it into the many attacks it resists. This Latias can especially take advantage of bad locks like Earthquake from Choice Scarf Flygon and Thunderbolt from Choice Scarf Rotom-A with its incredible coverage, staying power, and ability to alternate between super effective moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Expert Belt Latias misses out on hitting a few Pokemon super effectively: Empoleon, Zapdos, Gyarados, and Rotom-A. Even though Latias can still do quite decently versus all these Pokemon, a little bit of extra support will assist it in wearing these threats down. Strong Electric-type attacks from Magnezone, Zapdos, and your own Rotom-A will do well versus all four of these Pokemon; your own Rotom-A in particular will appreciate Expert Belt Latias's ability to bait in and sting opposing Tyranitar with Grass Knot. Tyranitar's support is appreciated for removing threats like fast offensive Starmie and revenge killers like Choice Scarf Rotom-A or even sometimes a Choice Scarf Flygon locked into the wrong move, which all give Latias trouble. Magnezone can assist in wearing down Jirachi and can even trap Bronzong, which Latias will appreciate even with its Hidden Power Fire. Lucario makes for a potent teammate that takes huge advantage of Latias's great coverage. Hidden Power Fire will wear down Jirachi and Choice Scarf Metagross, which both outspeed Lucario and resist its priority moves. Metagross appreciates Latias wearing down bulky Water-types like Swampert, Suicune, and Milotic through its Grass Knot, and the Electric-types that go well with Latias also make for great Metagross support. Overall, Expert Belt Latias is more of a team supporter than a Pokemon that requires support from its other teammates. It fits well with almost every Pokemon in the metagame.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Life Orb",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Life Orb Latias takes a different approach as an offensive variant and seeks to use its nice coverage and Recover to be a longer-lasting sweeper capable of destroying an opposing team with its powerful Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor, which it uses to hit everything as hard as possible.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire with Life Orb will assist in wearing down Steel-types like Jirachi, Metagross, Lucario, Magnezone, and Bronzong, and it denies momentum from Scizor by baiting it in and removing it in one hit. Alternatively, Thunder Wave is a solid option to paralyze Steel-types, notably Jirachi, that come in to take Draco Meteor, which will further assist in stunting offense. Healing Wish is another creative option that can be used in a pinch if Latias is low on HP and there isn't a reliable way to recover its health.</p> <p>Surf is a given, forming near-perfect coverage with Latias's powerful Dragon-type STAB Draco Meteor and devastating Heatran, Infernape, and Gliscor. Because this Latias may not opt for another attacking move alongside Draco Meteor, Surf is even more important.</p> <p>Recover directly supports Life Orb Latias by allowing it to have more staying power and to survive as long as possible, making it a more oppressive presence for offensive teams to overcome. As it loses HP each time it uses an attack via Life Orb, and likely even more from sand damage, Recover can be used in a pinch to compensate for this set's health loss.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Special Attack and Speed are maximized to make this Latias as fast and as powerful as possible. Life Orb is used as more of a general powerup for each attack, and the recoil is offset by Recover. A Timid nature is preferred to outspeed threats like Jirachi, Shaymin, Infernape, and non-Choice Scarf Flygon, but a Modest nature can be used if your team has these threats sufficiently covered, which will boost Latias's power to a new level and allow it to do significantly more damage to offensive variants of Pokemon like Jirachi, Bronzong, and Tyranitar. Note that when using Hidden Power Fire, Latias will not Speed tie with Gengar; however, by opting for Thunder Wave or even Healing Wish, it can maintain its ability to Speed tie.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Even with Life Orb, Passho Berry Tyranitar still needs to be played around, so use double switching to your advantage to keep Latias safe. If Latias sustains chip damage, try to scout out opposing movesets to plan opportunities to come in and heal up with Recover. You can also use Recover to scout Choice item Pokemon like Choice Scarf Heatran and, though this is much riskier, even Choice Band Swampert if you predict it to not use Ice Punch. If using Thunder Wave, wait until Jirachi enters the field, and make sure it's not holding a Choice Scarf before you attempt to cripple it. If you opt for Hidden Power Fire instead, however, you can try to nail Jirachi on the predicted switch if you're sure a Tyranitar won't switch in. Use Healing Wish in a pinch if you determine that it would be more beneficial to restore a teammate's health than attempt to preserve or heal Latias, but beware that the incoming teammate has to survive Stealth Rock damage first and will also potentially sustain damage from an enemy attack.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Latias requires a bit more support and wants to stay around for as long as possible, so it especially appreciates support to deal with Tyranitar, which is easily its largest threat. Magnezone can assist Life Orb Latias by removing Steel-types that resist Draco Meteor like Bronzong, some variants of Metagross, Choice Scarf Jirachi, and Skarmory. A Skarmory of your own can lay down Spikes to support Latias as well as provide more insurance versus threats like Choice Band and Dragon Dance Tyranitar, as well as Scizor, making it a strong teammate. Your own Jirachi can also force Scizor out with the threat of Fire Punch and can serve as a Lucario check if it's a faster variant. Jirachi also serves as a nice pivot versus opposing Latias, and specially defensive variants can deal with threats like Gengar, Starmie, and Rotom-A as well. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can effectively trap and remove Gengar, Starmie, and Choice Scarf Rotom-A, which can all threaten Life Orb Latias by outspeeding it and dealing massive damage with their super effective attacks.</p> "

  "Jirachi": {
    "overview": "<p>Jirachi awakens from its thousand-year-long hibernation in time for Generation IV, which brings Jirachi an expanded movepool, the new, abusable Choice Scarf, and a variety of new Pokemon to face off against and partner up with. With a widened physical movepool that now includes a STAB flinching move, Jirachi can run a plethora of different sets equally effectively. Its options include, but certainly aren't limited to, the time-tested Calm Mind sweeper from Advance, the Choice Scarf revenge killer and lead, the team supporter with dual screens and Wish, and the all-around status platform with Thunder Wave and a mixture of attacking options.</p> <p>Its nicely rounded stats allow Jirachi to make 101 HP Substitutes, Speed tie with the likes of Zapdos and Flygon, and more. On top of this, Jirachi's Steel and Psychic typing provides fantastic immunities to sandstorm and Toxic Spikes and resistances to many types. All of this makes Jirachi one of the most fearsome Pokemon around and an enigma on the battlefield until your opponent completely figures out what moves Jirachi is packing.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Jirachi's movepool is extremely vast, and even all the sets listed do not cover every notable option. Icy Wind can be used to hit, slow down, and 2HKO Dragon-types; Serene Grace-boosted Charge Beam has a 100% chance of giving Jirachi a Special Attack boost, but struggles to find its way onto a set due to access to Calm Mind and Thunderbolt; Drain Punch provides Fighting-type coverage as well as some small healing for Jirachi, but its low power is rather off-putting; Signal Beam can be used to maul both Celebi and Tyranitar at the same time, but provides little coverage outside of that.</p> <p>On the supporting side, Jirachi has a few tricks up its sleeve that can find their way onto assorted sets. Cosmic Power boosts both Jirachi's Defense and Special Defense simultaneously, which combines with Jirachi's excellent defensive typing to create a formidable tank that can be incredibly difficult to break. Safeguard can be pseudo-passed along with Wish to provide immunity to status for other Pokemon. Gravity is an interesting attack that can be used to set up a sweeper with powerful Ground-type STAB, such as Rhyperior, Mamoswine, or Flygon, and allows them to easily beat Skarmory without depending on prediction. Rain Dance deserves a special mention, as it eliminates Jirachi's Fire-type weakness, provides Thunder with perfect accuracy as well as a 60% paralysis rate thanks to Serene Grace, and boosts the damage on Water Pulse, which has a boosted confusion rate, also thanks to Serene Grace.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Jirachi's ridiculous versatility, as well as the effectiveness of each set, means it is virtually impossible to hard counter instantly. The Substitute + Calm Mind sets are arguably the most difficult to counter. Even the be-all, end-all counter to special offense, Blissey, is unable to stop Jirachi, given its possession of 101 HP Substitutes and Serene Grace for the possibility of Special Defense drops. Perish Song Celebi is undoubtedly the best counter to Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi, forcing Jirachi to switch out or die as Celebi Recovers in its face. Barring that, the most efficient counter depends on Jirachi's choice of moves. Psychic-based movesets are mainly countered by Tyranitar, which is immune to Psychic and takes squat from the filler attack thanks to its sandstorm-boosted Special Defense. Skarmory can come in and Whirlwind it away. Zapdos can come in and do likewise with Roar. Blissey boasts a much better chance of beating Flash Cannon sets, though it still has the same problem of being unable to break Jirachi's Substitutes in a single turn.</p> <p>The offensive Calm Mind set without Substitute has the potential to be more destructive, but also has its problems. Blissey easily beats this set with its seemingly infinite HP and gargantuan Special Defense. Likewise, Snorlax can come in and threaten Jirachi with either a powerful Fire Punch, paralysis from Body Slam, or a super effective Earthquake. Tyranitar fails to be OHKOed by any attack from Jirachi, even after a Calm Mind boost, and threatens with a powerful Earthquake. Sets without Thunderbolt can be Whirlwinded away by Skarmory. Without Hidden Power Ground or Fighting, Magnezone can switch in, resisting the entire moveset, and then trap and kill Jirachi at its leisure.</p> <p>Choiced sets have a few more notable counters. The Physical Choice set's biggest counter is Magnezone, which resists its entire moveset barring Fire Punch, traps it, and kills it. Bulky Water-types in general are very effective at beating physical Jirachi variants, but fear switching into Thunder Punch. Swampert takes it one step further by boasting an immunity to Thunder Punch, thus resisting the entire moveset with the exceptions of Zen Headbutt and U-turn. Hippowdon lacks the Fire- and Steel-type resistances, but its gargantuan Defense and access to reliable healing lets it shrug off Jirachi's blows easily. Skarmory resists Iron Head, Zen Headbutt, and U-turn, and can easily heal off damage, though switching into a Banded Fire Punch or Thunder Punch can be hazardous. Tyranitar boasts excellent physical durability and immunity to Zen Headbutt, though it fears Iron Head and U-turn. Heatran resists everything Jirachi can throw at it besides a neutral Thunder Punch, and threatens with STAB Fire Blast. Metagross also boasts high physical durability, though it fears Fire Punch. Gyarados resists Fire Punch, Iron Head, and U-turn, but fears Thunder Punch.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf equipped, Jirachi becomes an effective check to some of the metagame's largest threats, such as Dragon Dance Dragonite and Swords Dance Lucario. Jirachi's exceptional type coverage is what makes this set so potent. Fire Punch is great for taking down the Steel-types that like to switch into Iron Head, such as Scizor and Metagross. Ice Punch lets Jirachi pummel Gliscor and other Ground-types, as well as Dragonite and Flygon locked into Outrage. Lastly, Thunder Punch helps Jirachi defeat Gyarados, but won't KO any other bulky Water-types such as Suicune or Vaporeon. U-turn can scout for counters, which is especially helpful if you have entry hazards with which to weaken them, while Trick can be an effective way of dealing with stall teams or stat-boosting sweepers like Calm Mind Suicune. Use Trick with caution, however, since losing its speed makes Jirachi a much less effective revenge killer.</p> <p>This set can also be run to great effect as a lead with the moves Iron Head, Stealth Rock, Trick / U-turn, and one of Fire Punch, Thunder Punch, and Ice Punch. Fast leads such as Azelf and Aerodactyl will find themselves severely hampered by this set, since Iron Head not only scores a clean 2HKO, but has a 60% flinch rate, meaning that there is a good chance that they won't get a move in at all. Slower leads like Swampert or Tyranitar will suddenly find themselves crippled if Tricked a Choice Scarf, especially since most of the time they'll be locked into Stealth Rock, meaning you can bring in a Pokemon for free. However, U-turn can be used over Trick, since it makes Jirachi an extremely effective scout, especially if the opponent switches in something like Magnezone. In the lead slot, Jirachi doesn't need dedicated team support as much as other sets. However, when using Trick, it may find itself on the receiving end of Heatran's Fire Blast or Metagross's Earthquake instead of Stealth Rock. Having something that can set up on these Choice-locked threats is extremely useful. Pokemon like Gyarados and Dragonite can come in once Fire Blast or Earthquake has KOed Jirachi and set up a Dragon Dance as the opponent switches. As a bonus, they can begin their sweep at full HP thanks to Jirachi's keeping Stealth Rock out of play.</p> <p>Despite Jirachi's coverage, you have to be mindful of your opponent's team and which move you're locking Jirachi into. Heatran, Swampert, and Rotom-A all resist Iron Head and aren't hit super effectively by any of Jirachi's other attacks, meaning that they can take advantage of Jirachi. Swampert is an effective teammate for Jirachi, as it resists Heatran's main STAB and can retaliate with its own STAB Earthquake, although it must be wary of Toxic or Hidden Power Grass. Opposing Swampert are dealt with by anything that can switch into Earthquake or Waterfall. Suicune is an ideal switch-in, since it can Calm Mind up and proceed to throw boosted Surfs at Swampert; however, it must be wary of getting phazed by Roar. Suicune also has the added benefit of being able to threaten Heatran as well, provided it watches out for Explosion or Toxic. Rotom-A is trickier to deal with since it can run a variety of sets, although anything that can take on Shadow Ball and Thunderbolt can generally do well. Again, Swampert is a candidate since it can 2HKO most variants with Hydro Pump and is generally unaffected by Will-O-Wisp, but must switch out of Rotom-C's Leaf Storm.</p> <p>The list of Pokemon that can set up on Jirachi while it is locked into an attack is sadly quite long. Dragon Dance Gyarados, Calm Mind Suicune, Scizor, and even Lucario can switch into Iron Head and proceed to set up. Rotom-A can deal with most of these threats with its STAB Thunderbolt, but must watch out for Crunch from Lucario. Heatran and Dragon-types can set up with Substitute or Dragon Dance, respectively, on Fire Punch. Fortunately, these can be dealt with by using a bulky Water-type, which can also take care of the Steel-types setting up on Ice Punch and the Ground-types switching into Thunder Punch.</p> "

        "name": "Wish + Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>By utilizing Calm Mind and Wish on the same set, Jirachi can act as both a sweeper and a supporter. Because of its Steel typing, Jirachi, unlike most other Calm Mind sweepers, does not have to worry about Toxic putting an expiration date on its sweep, giving it the freedom to use Wish over Substitute. This set can prove particularly difficult for stall teams to eliminate, as Jirachi has the ability to heal itself and an immunity to Toxic. Against offensive teams, Jirachi provides a useful Dragon-type resistance and can use Wish to keep its teammates healthy. After scouting and eliminating the few Pokemon that can actually stop this set, Jirachi can start using Calm Mind to set up a sweep, healing itself with Wish when necessary. It is best to set up Jirachi's sweep against Pokemon that primarily use special attacks, as Calm Mind will reduce the damage that Jirachi takes. However, setting up against Pokemon that are locked into a resisted attack is also an effective strategy.</p> <p>Wish and Calm Mind form the backbone of this set. Thunderbolt and Psychic provide Jirachi with respectable type coverage, only being resisted by Pokemon with unique type combinations, such as Magnezone and Celebi. Flash Cannon is an option to consider over Psychic despite its lower Base Power, as it provides Jirachi with an answer for Pokemon like Tyranitar and Celebi.</p> <p>Because Jirachi does not have Substitute to help it absorb attacks, it is necessary to invest EVs into its Defense to give it physical bulk. This spread allows Jirachi to survive a +1 Adamant Life Orb Earthquake from Gyarados when at full health, while providing Jirachi with enough Speed to outpace max Speed Tyranitar. Alternatively, 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 Spe with a Bold nature allows Jirachi to outspeed any base 90 Pokemon with a neutral nature, most notably Lucario.</p> <p>Although this set provides Jirachi with the ability to support its team with Wish, it also becomes more vulnerable to being crippled without Substitute. In addition, the lack of Substitute also means that Jirachi is exposed to Trick. The most effective way to set up this particular Jirachi is to alternate between Wish and Calm Mind, as this combo provides a pseudo-safety net against critical hits. Finally, although Jirachi is immune to Toxic, it can still be paralyzed and burned, which can hinder its sweeping ability. Despite the aforementioned problems, Wish is still a valuable asset on any team, and it allows Jirachi to take on the role of a team supporter. Jirachi also tends to attract Fire- and Ground-type attacks, which provide the perfect opportunity to bring in Pokemon that otherwise have trouble doing so due to Stealth Rock, such as Dragonite and Gyarados. If Jirachi pulls off a Wish, these huge threats can come in at full health and attempt sweeps of their own.</p> <p>There are a few Pokemon that work particularly well with this Jirachi set that should be considered for your team. First of all, a Choice Band or Choice Scarf Tyranitar with Pursuit can assist in eliminating threats that attempt to Trick their Choice items onto Jirachi. Trick is predominantly used by Ghost- and Psychic-types, so Tyranitar can score some free KOs with Pursuit by switching in as your opponent's Pokemon uses Trick. This may clear the path for an eventual Jirachi sweep. Starmie is also a great teammate because it can beat Heatran and Infernape, the two most common Pokemon that can offensively stop Jirachi's sweep. As a bonus, Starmie also resists Fire-type attacks, making it another good Wish recipient to switch in on those pesky Fire-types. Finally, as mentioned earlier, Dragonite and Gyarados are effective offensive partners for this particular Jirachi. If you can time Jirachi's Wish properly to let these Pokemon come in at full health, negating Stealth Rock damage, they become very hard to stop. You should also take into consideration Jirachi's set when selecting teammates. For example, if Jirachi uses Thunderbolt and Psychic, it is recommended that you carry a check for Tyranitar, who can wall Jirachi; Gliscor and Swampert can beat most Tyranitar. If Jirachi is using Flash Cannon over Psychic, you should consider packing something that can beat Electric-type Pokemon such as Raikou and Jolteon; Choice Scarf Flygon does an excellent job at this and also makes for a good Wish recipient, considering its typing and ability. Finally, adding a teammate that can burn opposing Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp will increase the effectiveness of this Jirachi, as dampening blows from physical attacks can allow Jirachi to set up with greater ease.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This Jirachi can set up on a large range of Pokemon in OU and proceed to sweep the opponent's team after a few Calm Mind boosts. Jirachi is usually used as a physical attacker, so this set can catch the opponent off guard. Normally, Jirachi has an easier time setting up when it switches into a resisted attack, such as Scizor's Bullet Punch. From there, the main course of action should be to use Substitute, as it allows you to scout for your opponent's response to Jirachi. After that, Jirachi has two options: set up with Calm Mind if your opponent brings in a special attacker, or outright attack if your opponent brings in a Pokemon that poses an immediate threat.</p> <p>Flash Cannon is the STAB move of choice for this set, as it allows Jirachi to beat Tyranitar and Celebi one-on-one. Without Flash Cannon, Tyranitar can come in and wear down Jirachi with STAB Crunch or super effective Earthquakes, while Celebi can use Perish Song to force Jirachi to switch. Psychic can also be considered if you want Jirachi to handle Swampert, Rotom-A, and Infernape better. Thunderbolt is the best option for the second slot, as it has excellent neutral coverage when paired with either Flash Cannon or Psychic. Thunderbolt's main use is hitting bulky Water-types, like Suicune, and Skarmory for super effective damage. Thunderbolt also allows Jirachi to hit other counters, such as Heatran, for some decent damage.</p> <p>Max Speed is used to maximize Jirachi's offensive capability, outpacing Adamant Flygon and Jolly Lucario and forcing a Speed tie with non-Choice Scarf Flygon. This is to stop Jirachi from being potentially revenge killed by Earthquakes or Close Combats when sufficiently weakened. 252 HP EVs is absolutely required on Substitute Jirachi in order to set up on Seismic Toss Blissey. Alternatively, you can drop Jirachi's Speed to 308, 280, or 244 and boost Defense instead, allowing Jirachi to set up on weaker physical attackers like Bronzong.</p> <p>Jirachi's biggest weaknesses are against Ground- and Fire-type attacks, so Pokemon with a resistance or immunity to both are the best teammates for Jirachi, type-wise. Bulky Gyarados is a good teammate for several reasons: it has the ability to set up on Heatran and Swampert, both common Calm Mind Jirachi counters, and Jirachi can, in turn, set up on a majority of Gyarados's counters, such as Celebi and Vaporeon. Using Taunt on Gyarados means that Jirachi can freely switch in on a resisted attack, likely forcing the opposing Pokemon to switch out. Dragonite makes a good partner to Jirachi type-wise as well, but offers very little direct offensive support.</p> <p>Pokemon with counters that can be beaten by Calm Mind Jirachi are also acceptable teammates. CroCune and mono-attacking Swampert are good examples, as both share counters in Pokemon like Celebi, which Jirachi beats one-on-one. Jirachi can switch into Celebi with its handy resistance to Grass-type attacks and proceed to set up Calm Mind. However, Jirachi will be required to run Flash Cannon over Psychic to reliably beat Celebi. In return, Suicune and Swampert both can set up on Jirachi's common switch-ins as mentioned in the previous paragraph. Essentially, one Pokemon aims to weaken the other's counters so the other can sweep and vice-versa.</p> <p>Another support option to consider is Toxic Spikes, since they allow Jirachi to stall out Blissey while also crippling Swampert and Celebi, all of which like to switch into Jirachi. By repeatedly using Substitute, Toxic Spikes will progressively decrease the opposing Pokemon's HP until it is in KO range for either of Jirachi's attacks. In addition to Toxic Spikes support, Stealth Rock and Spikes are also recommended. Both forms of entry hazards discourage counters immune to Toxic Spikes from repeatedly switching in. Stealth Rock is preferred, as it is easily set up and hits Flying-types and Levitating Pokemon that are immune to Spikes. Rotom-A is a good choice for a spinblocker, thanks to its durability and limited weaknesses. Jirachi can also eliminate Blissey and Tyranitar, two major counters to Substitute + Charge Beam Rotom-A, allowing it to sweep more easily.</p> "

        "name": "Superachi! (Offensive Calm Mind)",
        "description": "<p>Superachi functions as both a sweeper and an excellent lure that baits and KOes Calm Mind Jirachi's usual checks. The likes of Heatran, Swampert, and Tyranitar are taken by surprise and KOed by the respective super effective move, leaving Jirachi free to tear down the rest of the team.</p> <p>Psychic is Jirachi's standard STAB move and, despite not having good coverage by itself, hits most Pokemon reasonably hard. Fortunately, this is where the other moves come in. Thunderbolt complements Psychic's coverage and skewers Skarmory and bulky Water-types alike. However, depending on preference and your team's needs, you can use Grass Knot to take out Swampert in one shot, as well as hit Tyranitar (who isn't afraid of even Hidden Power Ground) and Hippowdon harder. The fourth move is Hidden Power Ground because it OHKOes Calm Mind Jirachi's number one counter, Heatran, after one Calm Mind. It also hits Magnezone and grounded Steel-types fairly hard. Hidden Power Ground has great utility and is always the better option with Thunderbolt, but when using Grass Knot, Hidden Power Fire becomes a very alluring option. Hidden Power Fire, despite lowering Jirachi's Speed IV by 1, hits many notable threats for major damage, including Scizor, Forretress, Celebi, and Shaymin.</p> <p>The EVs are straightforward offensive EVs, with a Timid nature and 252 Speed EVs to tie with the numerous other base 100 Speed Pokemon in OU and outspeed Timid Roserade and Jolly Lucario. Investing 252 Special Attack EVs maximizes Jirachi's offensive potential, letting it hit with surprising force. Giving Leftovers to Jirachi helps keep it alive, and is preferable over Life Orb, which detracts from Jirachi's excellent natural bulk. Most Calm Mind Jirachi carry Leftovers as well, which helps you to further the illusion. If you prefer the power boost and are willing to sacrifice some of Jirachi's longevity, though, you can use Life Orb.</p> <p>While effective as a stand-alone sweeper, this set's real value lies in what it can do for its team. Superachi does a fantastic job of luring and KOing prominent OU threats like Heatran if running Hidden Power Ground, which many Pokemon can benefit from. Electric-types, such as Rotom-A and Zapdos, appreciate this the most, as do Grass-types with Heatran removed and Tyranitar with Swampert gone. To support Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Jirachi's powerful Psychic can eliminate Fighting-types while Grass Knot can remove Swampert; provided Tyranitar carries Shuca Berry or you have a Flygon check, the combination is particularly deadly. Make sure to pack a Stealth Rock user such as Heatran, since Jirachi needs Stealth Rock to score some KOs.</p> <p>One thing the user has to take into consideration is that Shuca Heatran is a very common lead, and is even seen outside of the lead slot. You can specialize and add Occa Berry for this if you really need to, though it isn't recommended; also note that the lack of Leftovers, which are normally on Calm Mind Jirachi, may well alert your opponent to the fact that you're running Superachi. Another alternative is Shuca Berry for Flygon, Gliscor, Tyranitar, and Dragonite. For example, you can do a lot of damage to Flygon with Psychic, then switch to a Flying-type of your own, such as Dragonite with Extreme Speed, to take the next Earthquake. Flygon is forced to switch if it has a Choice Scarf, letting you snatch a Dragon Dance, while Extreme Speed finishes it off should it come back in.</p> <p>This set is walled by Blissey and Snorlax, so Explosion Heatran, Tyranitar, or any strong physical attacker is recommended as a companion. This set has trouble with Celebi if running Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ground, so packing Heatran on your team may be worthwhile as well. Other options for crippling these walls are Toxic Spikes and Trick. Forretress and Roserade are good Toxic Spikes users, though they share Jirachi's weakness to Fire-type attacks. Starmie is a good choice for a Trick user; the threat of Hydro Pump wards off typical Pursuit users, and because Starmie is rarely seen with Trick, unsuspecting Blissey are easily crippled. It also beats Infernape, which outspeeds Superachi and has a super effective STAB.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + Thunder Wave",
        "description": "<p>By utilizing paralysis and Iron Head's boosted flinch rate with Serene Grace, Jirachi can leave its opponents with a mere 30% chance to successfully hit with a 100% accurate move. This set takes full advantage of these odds by providing Jirachi with the ability to heal itself with Leftovers every time the opponent gets flinched or is fully paralyzed. Substitute allows Jirachi to safely attempt to flinch opponents that would otherwise OHKO it. With Leftovers, Jirachi fully regains its lost health from Substitute after successfully preventing the opponent from attacking four times.</p> <p>Unlike most other sets, this set should be played with long-term planning in mind. It often takes two switch-ins for this Jirachi to be as successful as possible. The first time Jirachi comes in, it should paralyze its counter and then switch out. The next time Jirachi finds an opening to come in, it should use Substitute while your opponent switches back to the same paralyzed counter, and then begin to wreak havoc. Of course, Jirachi could attempt to keep using Substitute the first time it comes out until its opponent is fully paralyzed, but this is not a reliable strategy.</p> <p>176 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Jirachi to outpace all positive nature base 90 Speed Pokemon, most notably Lucario. 168 Attack EVs allow Jirachi to OHKO Lucario with Fire Punch after Life Orb recoil and a Defense drop. Even without max Attack, this spread still allows Jirachi to get the OHKOs and 2HKOs that it would get with 252 EVs. The rest of the EVs are thrown into HP and give Jirachi a nice amount of bulk to round out the set; however, if you want even more bulk, a 252 HP / 220 Atk / 36 Spe spread works too. The 252 HP EVs give Jirachi 101 HP Substitutes that aren't broken by Seismic Toss. For that spread, a Careful, Impish, or Adamant nature will work; the choice of nature really depends on what you need. A Careful nature allows Jirachi to take attacks from Starmie and other special attackers more easily. An Impish nature does the same, except for physical attackers like Machamp. An Adamant nature gives Jirachi a nice boost in Attack. Since Jirachi should be paralyzing most switch-ins, max Speed is generally not needed, making this secondary spread just as viable as the original. If you want to maximize Jirachi's offensive power, you may also use a spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe with a Jolly nature.</p> <p>Although this set is incredibly difficult for people to play around, it does have some hard counters. Pokemon that are immune to Thunder Wave or resist Iron Head and Fire Punch usually fit the bill. Such Pokemon include Hippowdon, Swampert, Gliscor, and Flygon. They each are immune to Thunder Wave, take little from Iron Head, and can hit back with powerful Ground-type attacks. Starmie is also a good counter because it resists Jirachi's attacks, and can easily switch out to rid itself of paralysis thanks to Natural Cure. Suicune also resists Jirachi's attacks, can set up Calm Minds, and use Rest to rid itself of paralysis. Heatran is a decent counter as well; Jirachi is able to paralyze it, but it still takes very little from Jirachi's attacks and can hit back hard with Fire Blast or Flamethrower. Jolteon is also a good check because he is immune to Thunder Wave, resists Iron Head, and can break through Jirachi's Substitutes with STAB Thunderbolt and not have to worry about being flinched with his superior Speed.</p> <p>Because Jirachi should be behind a Substitute most of the time, the opponent will be eager to break it. That makes any Pokemon who resists Fire- and Ground-type attacks a solid partner for Jirachi. Dragonite and Gyarados are both excellent choices. Mixed Dragonite can switch in on either of those types of attacks and use Draco Meteor to force out bulky Ground- and Water-types, while Gyarados loves getting free switch-ins so it can set up with Dragon Dance. Gyarados's STAB Water-type attacks can also scare off the Ground- and Fire-types that hinder Jirachi. Jirachi will also appreciate a Heatran with Toxic on its team. Heatran is a great lure for the same Pokemon who stop Jirachi, like Swampert and Vaporeon., and Toxic will make them essentially useless when facing Jirachi. Specially Defensive Skarmory walls Pokemon like Hippowdon and Vaporeon and appreciates the extra turns to set up Spikes. Any Pokemon that benefit from a paralyzed opponent, such as Machamp and Dragonite, will work great with this set too.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>While Jirachi is typically seen either running Calm Mind or carrying Choice Scarf, this set is an excellent alternative which acts as both a mid-game wallbreaker and a late-game sweeper. Be warned though, this is not a Pokemon who can be haphazardly thrown onto a team with the expectation of it functioning well. It serves a very specific role and should only be used if your team is capable of supporting it.</p> <p>Jirachi's main purpose here is as a mid-game wallbreaker. Like most mixed wallbreakers, this Jirachi relies on excellent type coverage; however, unlike its companions Infernape and Dragonite, Jirachi relies not on large damage output, but on surprise value. Expert Belt along with physical attacks will often cause the opponent to assume that Jirachi is holding a Choice Scarf and send in something like Skarmory, Swampert, or Dragonite to take the opportunity to set up. Jirachi's oft overlooked 100 base Speed only makes it easier to create this illusion.</p> <p>Even without bluffing Choice Scarf, however, the oddity of this set is often enough to work your opponent into a corner. If you manage to double-switch into something like Scizor, Swampert, or Dragonite, it is unlikely that your opponent will switch out, and you can go for an easy OHKO. Similarly, Jirachi is perfect for sending in after a double KO via Explosion or recoil damage. Besides being a powerful wallbreaker with its coverage and a useful late-game sweeper with a 60% flinch rate attack and 100 base Speed, this Jirachi also serves as a useful check against a number of common OU threats. Most notable among these is Lucario, which is outsped and takes a minimum of 78% damage from Fire Punch, a sure OHKO after a Defense drop from Close Combat.</p> <p>There are two Pokemon to look out for when using this Jirachi. The first is Heatran, who either 4x resists or is immune to every one of this set's attacks and can easily OHKO Jirachi with Fire Blast. If your team demands it, Hidden Power Ground can be used over Grass Knot or Ice Punch in order to quickly deal with Heatran and Magnezone; however, this will open Jirachi up to even more threats that are difficult to deal with than the generally predictable Heatran. The second Pokemon to look out for is Gyarados, which will not take much more than 30% from Grass Knot and can easily set up with Dragon Dance. If you are more worried about Gyarados than Swampert, then you can exchange Grass Knot for Thunderbolt, though that will make Jirachi less effective against both Suicune and bulky Ground-type Pokemon. In reality, any combination of these moves can be effective; the key is knowing exactly what your team needs Jirachi to eliminate.</p> <p>As Heatran and Gyarados can switch into this set with ease, pairing Jirachi with a bulky Water-type is highly recommended. Vaporeon is a good choice, as it can repeatedly switch into Heatran with its high Special Defense and simultaneously carry Hidden Power Electric to take out Gyarados after Stealth Rock. Vaporeon also packs a resistance to Fire-type attacks aimed at Jirachi, which can in turn switch into Grass-type attacks aimed at Vaporeon. Apart from complementary typing, Vaporeon can also pass Wishes to Jirachi. If using Thunderbolt over Grass Knot, Ground-types will give this set the most trouble. Flying-types such as Gliscor work well against most Ground-types, especially if the opposing Pokemon lacks a Rock- or Ice-type attack. Swampert, another common switch-in, can be dealt with by bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Gyarados.</p> <p>Offensively, this set should be paired with Pokemon that can take advantage of the holes Jirachi leaves on the opponent's team. Dragon Dance Dragonite is often the best choice as a teammate for several reasons. First, Dragonite can easily switch into the Fire- and Ground-type attacks normally aimed at Jirachi, usually netting it a free turn of setup, while Jirachi can switch into the Dragon-, Rock-, and Ice-type attacks aimed at Dragonite. Secondly, this Jirachi can eliminate Scizor and Swampert, two of Dragon Dance Dragonite's biggest checks since neither will think of switching out against what is likely a standard Choice Scarf set. If running Thunderbolt over Grass Knot, Swords Dance Lucario is a good offensive partner for this set - it will usually have no trouble sweeping once its three biggest counters, Gyarados, Dragonite, and Gliscor, have been taken out, while the dispatching of Scizor is also a nice bonus. Do watch out for the shared Fire- and Ground-type weaknesses that Lucario has, however.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Wish Support",
        "description": "<p>This set is tailored to use Jirachi's resistances and great defenses to pass Wishes around to other members of your team. The general strategy is to Wish and then U-turn to scout or take a hit from a faster Pokemon while healing something else on the team. If the opposing Pokemon is faster and can KO Jirachi, such as Mamoswine, you should opt to switch rather than use U-turn. Jirachi is best used to nurse Pokemon that resist Jirachi's Fire- and Ground-type weaknesses, like Dragonite and Gyarados, back to health.</p> <p>The other moves on this set allow Jirachi to provide even more support while beating certain threats. Body Slam is an awesome move on Jirachi, dealing some damage with a 60% chance of paralyzing anything but Ghost-types. This is especially annoying if you manage to paralyze a Ground-type like Mamoswine or Flygon that normally doesn't have to worry about losing its Speed. Thunder Wave is still available if you want to guarantee paralysis, but Body Slam is usually better. The fourth slot gives this Jirachi a little offensive power. Iron Head provides basic STAB, as well as allowing for an effective paraflinch combo after a successful paralysis from the third move. On the other hand, Ice Punch can deal massive damage to Dragonite. Jirachi always survives two Adamant +1 LO Outrages, even with Stealth Rock damage factored in, and Ice Punch can allow Jirachi to deal with Dragonite directly without relying on Wish or paralysis.</p> <p>240 HP EVs allows Jirachi to hit 401 HP, giving Jirachi optimal Leftovers recovery as well as granting it the ability to take 5 consecutive Seismic Tosses. Running 32 Speed EVs beats Jolly Tyranitar and Timid Magnezone, allowing this Jirachi to escape Choice Specs Magnezone's clutches unharmed. The rest of the EVs are split between the defenses, with enough put into Defense so Jirachi isn't 2HKOed by Adamant Dragonite's Life Orb Outrage after a Dragon Dance. A spread of 240 HP / 76 Def / 160 SpD / 32 Spe with an Impish nature gives considerable defenses on both sides, as well as hitting 244 Speed, which outpaces Timid Magnezone and Jolly Tyranitar. Alternatively, a 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 Spe Jolly spread can be used to outspeed and paralyze Jolly Lucario, crippling it for the remainder of the match.</p> <p>Gyarados is a good partner for this set because it can come in on both Fire- and Ground-type attacks. Since Gyarados not only lacks recovery, but also has a Stealth Rock weakness, Wish will greatly increase its longevity. Additionally, Jirachi can come in on Rock-type attacks aimed at Gyarados, although it has trouble switching into direct Gyarados counters such as Rotom-A. Dragonite also benefits from Wish support due to having similar problems as Gyarados, and can hit harder off the bat instead of having to set up, giving your opponent less of a chance to regain the momentum. Swampert is also a good partner because it can switch into all of the Pokemon who usually force out Jirachi, such as Heatran and Rotom-A, and can force them out in return. As a general note though, Jirachi has trouble fitting into fully offensive teams because it will be very difficult to repeatedly pass Wishes around, so using Jirachi on a more defensive team (one that can repeatedly switch into different attacks and not get too worn down) is highly recommended. If you're feeling gutsy, Thunder can be used over Thunder Wave and Body Slam to stave off Skarmory and Gyarados while spreading paralysis, but its 70% chance of hitting makes its 42% chance of paralysis less than appealing.</p> <p>Another interesting quality about this set is its ability to lure in certain Pokemon, only to paralyze them with Body Slam or Thunder Wave. Examples of such Pokemon include Gyarados, Gliscor, and Magnezone, all of which run a specific Speed stat to outpace certain threats. Lucario is an excellent sweeper that takes advantage of the above scenario. After a Swords Dance, Lucario can opt to use the stronger 90 Base Power Close Combat (when resisted) over the 80 Base Power Extreme Speed to take down its counters, provided that they have been weakened sufficiently.</p> "

        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<p>With a Careful nature and large investment in both Special Defense and HP, Jirachi is able to switch into many special attackers without being 2HKOed. Even Life Orb Starmie's Hydro Pump and Choice Specs Jolteon's Thunderbolt will fail to 2HKO Jirachi. The only other offensive Pokemon with this level of special bulk is Snorlax, whose typing and low Speed may not be enough for some teams. Unlike Blissey and Snorlax, however, Jirachi cannot switch into special attacks randomly and must constantly use Wish in order to stay healthy.</p> <p>By paralyzing its foes with Thunder Wave, Jirachi becomes faster than them, letting it abuse Iron Head's 60% flinch rate in tandem with paralysis. If your team has a problem with Pokemon who are immune to Thunder Wave, Body Slam can be used instead, sporting a 60% chance to paralyze. However, Jirachi will lose its ability to check Rotom-A if it runs Body Slam. Jirachi can keep itself in good condition with the steady recovery from Leftovers while periodically using Wish to regain 50% of its health. Iron Head helps Jirachi buy itself turns until it can safely use Wish. It is also Jirachi's strongest attack, and while not that powerful, its low damage output won't matter after a few hits. Wish is Jirachi's healing move, and works well in conjunction with Iron Head and Thunder Wave. Wish can also help Jirachi support its team later in the game. Protect is a useful move that may be used over Wish to scout Choice item users and to pick up additional Leftovers recovery. Lastly, Fire Punch helps Jirachi by hitting foes who resist Iron Head, preventing Jirachi from becoming setup fodder against these opponents.</p> <p>The EVs prevent Jirachi from being 2HKOed by a myriad of threatening special attackers, including, but not limited to, Life Orb Gengar and Lead Azelf. Jirachi can also act as a one-time stop to many physical stat-uppers, because it can switch in and paralyze the stat booster, allowing the rest of your team to take out the weakened opposing Pokemon. 32 Speed EVs let Jirachi outspeed Jolly max Speed Tyranitar, which can be invaluable when facing down Dragon Dance or fast Choice Band variants. Jirachi can also run an EV spread of 176 HP / 136 SpA / 176 SpD / 20 Spe along with a Calm nature and a moveset of Psychic, Thunderbolt, Wish, and Icy Wind. These changes will allow Jirachi to better handle Starmie, Jolteon and Dragon-types. However, Jirachi loses a significant portion of its bulk and the ability to combat most physical threats due to the lack of Thunder Wave. Only choose to run this variant if your team really struggles with Starmie and Jolteon.</p> <p>Sandstorm helps Jirachi when it is trying to stall opponents, making Tyranitar and Hippowdon important teammates because of their Sand Stream abilities. In order for Jirachi to win against Starmie, Jirachi needs a fair amount of luck. Jirachi also loses to Jolteon because Jirachi cannot paralyze it without Body Slam; therefore, back-up checks to Jolteon and Starmie will come in handy. Tyranitar is useful in this regard, as it can survive an attack from either and retaliate with Earthquake and STAB Crunch, respectively. The only special attackers whom Jirachi cannot reliably stand up to are Fire-types, so bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Vaporeon are great teammates. Finally, defensive Water-types can stall out Jirachi, so an Electric- or Grass-type teammate will come in handy; good candidates for this role include Rotom-A and Shaymin. Use Jirachi on balanced and bulky offensive teams. Typically, both of these team styles fare poorly against fast and powerful special attackers, and will therefore appreciate the Wish and paralysis support that Jirachi offers.</p> "

However, Gastrodon offers some unique assets that Swampert is missing, such as consistent healing via Recover as well as its ability Sticky Hold, which makes Gastrodon immune to Trick and prevents Knock Off from removing its item. Thanks to those two traits, Gastrodon has the luxury of being a truly excellent counter to Clefable. Like with Swampert, Gastrodon's excellent Water / Ground typing only leaves it with a Grass-type weakness while also granting it an Electric immunity, which can make Gastrodon hard to immediately threaten. Gastrodon's main utility is Curse, which in conjunction with its ability makes it a slow setup sweeper that cannot get easily stopped by Trick unlike its competition. Despite its unique attributes, Gastrodon remains very passive and has quite a few flaws; on one hand its coverage consisting of Waterfall and Earthquake means Pokemon like Breloom, Haze Milotic, and defensive Latias completely blank it, and on the other hand its extreme lack of power means it needs several boosts before being actually threatening. Furthermore, status like burn and poison heavily invalidates Gastrodon in the long run, so it's going to require a lot of support to be able to function nicely.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic can be used over Earthquake to lure Pokemon like Milotic and Reflect Latias and put them on a timer, both of which are extremely annoying for Curse Gastrodon. Rest is an option over Recover to get rid of eventual status more easily, but it remains inferior because Gastrodon won't heal as consistently without Recover. A set of Ice Beam, Earthquake, and Toxic can be used as a tank in the manner of Swampert that can also heal off damage with Recover. Counter and Mirror Coat are both usable as elements of surprise. The former is aimed at Pokemon like Dragonite, Gyarados, and Machamp, while the latter targets Pokemon such as Choice Specs Latias, Empoleon, and Gengar.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types like Breloom, Celebi, and Shaymin are a real nuisance for Gastrodon, as they resist both of its STAB attacks and can all easily force it out at any time, without Gastrodon being able to do anything about it. These aforementioned Pokemon in particular can all heal in various ways, which makes it even more impossible for Gastrodon to wear them down.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon that resist Water: Because of Gastrodon's poor coverage, it won't hit Pokemon like Latias, Dragonite, and Gyarados even for neutral damage. Defensive Latias walls Curse Gastrodon for days; even at +6 it only deals about 30% to Latias, or 15% under Reflect, not to mention Latias can use Roar to phaze Gastrodon. While Dragonite and Gyarados aren't as sturdy as Latias, they're way more scary in the sense that they exploit Gastrodon's inability to hit them effectively to set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Gastrodon is really lacking in power; even with several boosts it will hardly be threatening to some of the best physical walls in the tier. Skarmory rules Gastrodon like no one, as it can take advantage of Gastrodon's inability to touch it to easily lay down Spikes and can also prevent Gastrodon from boosting itself by phazing it at any moment with Whirlwind. Milotic in the same way prevents Gastrodon from getting multiple Curse boosts with Haze, which also has way more PP than Curse and thus can win the war in long games. Defensive Rotom can ruin Gastrodon with Will-O-Wisp, while Zapdos can run Toxic, Hidden Power Grass, or even Roar to make Gastrodon look miserable. To a certain extent, Gliscor can prevent Gastrodon from boosting itself with Taunt, wall it, and wear it down with Earthquake, as unboosted Waterfall deals negligible damage against Gliscor's high Defense. Physically defensive Hippowdon has no trouble checking Gastrodon temporarily as well thanks to its huge Defense, as it can phaze it with Roar and make it take entry hazard damage or wear it down in the long run.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Threats: Since Gastrodon is very weak and passive, especially without boosts, it will have a hard time handling fast and powerful Pokemon like Choice Specs Latias, Choice Band Dragonite, Choice Band Swampert, and Choice Band Gyarados, all of which can deal tremendous damage to it. Other heavy hitters like Machamp, Lucario, and Choice Band Tyranitar deal a ton of damage to it as well.</p> ",

        "name": "Curse",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Curse is Gastrodon's main offensive weapon, which lets it set up and effectively beat Clefable as well as sweep. The combination of Waterfall and Earthquake forms the best coverage Gastrodon has to offer and enables it to hit everything for at least neutral damage besides Grass-types such as Breloom, Celebi, and Shaymin and Pokemon like Latias, Dragonite, and Gyarados. Recover allows Gastrodon to heal itself at its convenience and grants it several opportunities to set up throughout a game.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Invest 252 EVs in HP in order to maximize Gastrodon's bulk overall. Since Gastrodon aims to beef its Defense up with Curse, 240 EVs in Special Defense as well as a Careful nature are the way to go to easily soak up damage from Pokemon like Latias, Starmie, Heatran, Gengar, mixed Dragonite, and even mixed Infernape with Grass Knot. More Defense can be added to set up on Tyranitar more easily and to take Infernape's Close Combat better, although you should keep in mind that Gastrodon should always have a Careful nature. There's no alternative to Gastrodon's Leftovers, as combined with its ability Sticky Hold, it means that it will always be able to passively recover its health.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>To get a chance to set up with Gastrodon, you'll need to get rid of its main counters. Trappers such as Magnezone can take out Pokemon like Skarmory, which are big thorns in Gastrodon's side. Try to preserve Gastrodon's health as much as possible and avoid status effects like burn and poison, which are extremely unpleasant for it. As soon as you remove Gastrodon's main counters, you can eventually find the opportunity to set up on Pokemon like Clefable, non-Choice Band Tyranitar, Choice Scarf Rotom-A, and Choice Scarf Latias. Make use of Gastrodon's ability to switch in endlessly on Clefable, as well as switch into Choice Scarf Rotom-A thanks to its Electric and Trick immunity.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>In terms of good partners, Magnezone is strongly appreciated, as it takes care of pesky Steel-types like Skarmory and Bronzong. Since Gastrodon hates status, having a spinner like Starmie or a Poison-type Pokemon such as Roserade or Nidoqueen that can remove potential Toxic Spikes and spread its own is very much appreciated. In the same vein, Healing Wish support from the likes of Latias, Jirachi, and Shaymin can bring Gastrodon back to full health even if it has taken status during the game. Heatran can deny status like burn and poison and spread its own Toxic on Milotic and Reflect Latias, which puts them on a timer and removes their ability to wall Gastrodon in the long run. Clefable has great synergy with Gastrodon as well, as it can absorb status aimed at Gastrodon, provides Knock Off support against the likes of defensive Latias, Milotic, and even Shed Shell Skarmory so Magnezone can pick it off, and checks some variants of Heatran and Zapdos that Gastrodon cannot handle, whereas on the other hand Gastrodon can cover a potential Trick aimed at Clefable. Alternatively, Calm Mind Clefable can help deal with Dragonite and Gyarados, which are huge threats to Gastrodon, while providing some sort of wincon in scenarios where Gastrodon would have a hard time sweeping the opposing team. Since Gastrodon is very inclined to let Breloom come in on the field for free, defensive Latias and Celebi can make useful sturdy answers to it while also providing great general defensive utility against the likes of Machamp and Swampert. Choice Specs Latias can also use Sleep Talk to absorb Breloom's Spore. Finally, Bronzong's plethora of resistances, solid bulk, access to Stealth Rock, and self-sufficiency make it one of the best Pokemon to patch plenty of weaknesses and play multiple roles in one slot. Bronzong can also bring a very nice aspect to the team and free other slots, which lets you run more specific support that Gastrodon drastically requires.</p> "

  "Honchkrow": {
    "overview": "<p>Honchkrow's main advantages come from its powerful mixed offenses and access to the strongest priority in the tier with Sucker Punch. Honchkrow has a fantastic movepool, as Brave Bird and various coverage moves such as Heat Wave and Superpower make it difficult to switch into. Its ability allows it to absorb sleep moves such as Breloom's Spore and Roserade's Sleep Powder. However, Honchkrow is completely unviable in DPP OU, as it is held back by a huge weakness to residual damage, an awful defensive typing, and slow Speed. While Honchkrow has a solid base HP stat, its terrible defenses, weakness to Stealth Rock, and sand vulnerability compromise its bulk and it takes huge recoil damage from Brave Bird and Life Orb. Unfortunately, Honchkrow is a slow, frail wallbreaker, and it struggles to deal with faster Pokemon that can OHKO it, such as Gyarados, Dragonite, Heatran, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Scizor using Bullet Punch. On top of this, Honchkrow is heavily reliant on prediction, as it needs Sucker Punch to damage faster Pokemon and mispredictions can easily get it OHKOed or let the opposing Pokemon set up unimpeded. While Honchkrow can switch into sleep moves, Breloom OHKOes it with Superpower or Focus Punch while even Breloom's and Roserade's Grass-type moves are dangerous: Breloom 2HKOes with Seed Bomb after Stealth Rock and Roserade outspeeds and OHKOes it with Leaf Storm after Stealth Rock and a round of Life Orb and sand damage. Honchkrow simply cannot reliably perform in DPP OU, and should not be considered for a serious team.</p> ",

  "Bronzong": {
    "overview": "<p>Bronzong sets itself apart from its Steel / Psychic type brethren Jirachi and Metagross with a great ability in Levitate, allowing it to check Ground-types as well as making it immune to Spikes. It also finds its key attributes in having a Stealth Rock resistance and sand immunity, making it quite durable and hard to take down. Its remarkable all-around mixed bulk coupled with a ton of key resistances allows it to act as a pivot that is able to switch into prevalent moves such as Latias's Draco Meteor, Metagross's Meteor Mash, and Flygon's Earthquake. One of Bronzong's biggest selling points is that, especially with Trick Room, it's one of the best checks to a large number of setup sweepers, mainly Dragon Dance Dragonite, Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, some variants of Calm Mind Jirachi, and even Suicune. In addition, its ability to fire off powerful assaults makes it a great late-game sweeper and supporter for slow teammates to help them perform better. However, Bronzong does not have large offensive coverage, and its base Attack stat is below average compared to other brutes in the tier. This is remedied by its access to Gyro Ball, which synergizes well with its low Speed, and Explosion, which enables it to pressure a large variety of threats, namely Zapdos, Swampert, Starmie, and even Blissey and Clefable.</p> <p>If not given the opportunity to use Trick Room, Bronzong's incredible slowness remains exploitable by popular threats such as Breloom, Machamp, and Heatran. It also does not resist Tyranitar's Dark-type STAB attacks, is weak to Jirachi's Fire Punch, and takes huge neutral damage from Zapdos's Thunderbolt or Starmie's Hydro Pump, which are incredibly popular. In addition, its lack of reliable recovery moves makes it prone to being worn down, and it will not like switching in repeatedly to take even resisted hits. Moreover, its lack of offensive presence outside of Gyro Ball means that it is setup bait for Skarmory. Generally, Bronzong has trouble beating physical walls and bulky Water-types without the use of Explosion, which can be easily wasted by the ubiquitous Rotom-A, which resists most of the rest of its weaponry as well.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Bronzong has a plethora of other moves if you want its ringing to sound differently. Its defensive capabilities allow it to fit nicely on rain teams as a great pivot with a Damp Rock set. Its movepool is adequate for such a set, since it is capable of setting up Stealth Rock and using Explosion to bring in a teammate freely. However, running all those moves means that you have to be okay with sacrificing Earthquake. Bronzong can pull off an effective dual screens set, since it has a few advantages over other setters, namely its bulk and access to Explosion. Its access to Hypnosis can also be useful for offensive teams to temporarily shut down a threat. However, the low accuracy makes this move somewhat risky to use. Heal Block can surprise defensive threats such as Zapdos and Rotom-A by preventing them from using recovery moves safely against Bronzong. Gravity negates the Ground-type immunities of Rotom-A, Skarmory, and opposing Bronzong, which can allow other teammates to break through them with powerful Earthquakes, as well as Magnezone's Magnet Rise, which can shift the one-on-one matchup in Bronzong's favor in tandem with Earthquake. However, Gravity also removes Bronzong's own Levitate, making it no longer able to check Flygon, Metagross, and such. Bronzong has a great special movepool, featuring moves like Calm Mind, Grass Knot, Psychic, Flash Cannon, and Charge Beam. Although Bronzong can lure and 2HKO some physically defensive Pokemon, its only medicore Special Attack and awful Speed make it more a gimmick than a real threat. Despite the fact that it looks very gimmicky, a maximum Speed lead set with Imprison and a Jolly nature could work, as it outspeeds some slow leads such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Metagross and can prevent them from using Stealth Rock while setting up its own. Last but not least, Skill Swap is an interesting option that makes Bronzong able to cripple Clefable by negating its ability.</p> <p>Trick can be utilized alongside Choice Band or Iron Ball. Choice Band is useful to cripple switch-ins that are not a threat anymore when locked into a move while boosting Bronzong's power at the same time. Iron Ball grants Bronzong the ability to cripple common switch-ins such as Rotom-A, Zapdos, and Skarmory by grounding them and halving their Speed, which enables Pokemon like Metagross and Swampert to break through their usual counters. Furthermore, Iron Ball allows Bronzong to run Heatproof as its primary ability since the item already makes it grounded. Heatproof in general is a great alternative to Levitate, as it can be used to fool Heatran or Infernape. However, Levitate grants Bronzong the opportunity to check Ground-types, which its typing wouldn't normally allow it to do. Also, becoming weak to Spikes is a really unwanted aspect that further reveals the deception. Lastly, Shed Shell is an option that can be used to escape Magnezone's Magnet Pull.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Most Water-types can switch into offensive or defensive Bronzong and threaten it with their neutral STAB moves. Gyarados has Intimidate, resists Gyro Ball, and can set up Dragon Dance, as it survives Explosion with the Attack drop. Bulky Starmie, especially, is annoying, as it can tank reasonably any of Bronzong's moves bar Payback, spin away its entry hazards, and repeatedly recover from Bronzong's attacks with Recover. Suicune's wonderful Defense allows it to laugh at Bronzong's Earthquake or Gyro Ball while setting up Calm Mind to prepare a sweep. CroCune can cure Toxic, survive Explosion, and stay healthy, while offensive sets will melt Bronzong with a boosted Hydro Pump. Milotic can wear Bronzong down with Surf and heal itself with Recover to win in the long run, although Toxic or Explosion threatens it. Swampert also hates Toxic but takes nothing from Bronzong's attacks bar Explosion even without Defense EVs and can utilize this momentum to set up Stealth Rock or launch some powerful Waterfalls.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Skarmory can stand forever in Bronzong's face, sponge any of its attacks, and take this time to set up Spikes thanks to its resistance to Gyro Ball and immunity to Earthquake and Toxic. Its astronomical Defense also enables it to use Roost and regain HP even if Bronzong uses Earthquake on that turn while taking a pittance from Explosion. Similarly, Bronzong is completely walled by opposing Bronzong. Bulky variants of Scizor can shrug off any of Bronzong's attacks, heal the damage with Roost, and proceed to set up Swords Dance to threaten it even more. Wish + Protect bulky Jirachi can beat Bronzong in a one-on-one matchup, but it slightly risks critical hits and also needs to burn quite a bit of PP to do so. Also, more offensive variants of Jirachi can overwhelm Bronzong with Fire Punch and a potential burn, which Bronzong hates. Offensive Empoleon's Water-type moves do a ton to Bronzong, and it can carry a Shuca Berry to shrug off Earthquake's damage, while defensive variants can cripple it with Knock Off and set up entry hazards. Lucario usually does not switch into Bronzong, but a +2 Life Orb-boosted Close Combat obliterates Bronzong, while an unboosted one will still do massive damage. The latter three must be wary of Earthquake, however.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types, in general, are effective against Bronzong, as they resist Gyro Ball and force great damage on it. Even if Magnezone runs the risk of switching into Earthquake, it can easily eliminate Bronzong with Magnet Rise and its STAB Thunderbolt. RestTalk Rotom-A is also a great counter, as it resists Gyro Ball, is immune to Explosion and Earthquake, and can cure Toxic with Rest. Defensive Zapdos causes Bronzong some PP issues with Pressure and Roost while resisting Gyro Ball and being immune to Earthquake. However, it is susceptible to Explosion and Toxic. Other Electric-types like Raikou and Jolteon inflict great damage on Bronzong but hate dealing with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types annoy Levitate Bronzong; Infernape and Heatran can switch in while Bronzong attempts to set up Stealth Rock and deal tremendous damage with their powerful STAB attacks. While Moltres is rare, with Pressure and resistances to Earthquake and Gyro Ball, it's also a major thorn in Bronzong's side. Bronzong can also be chipped pretty quickly by Pokemon that carry Fire-type coverage moves like Flygon, Jirachi, and Dragonite.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types generally take low damage from Gyro Ball thanks to their solid Defense and low Speed; furthermore, they can exploit Bronzong's passivity to either wall it or use it as setup fodder. Unless Bronzong carries Hidden Power Ice, Gliscor is a major thorn in Bronzong's side, as it is able to stall it out with Roost and prevents it from using Toxic or Stealth Rock with Taunt. Even Explosion does not always KO it. Gliscor can also use Knock Off to negate Bronzong's passive recovery or Ice Fang to fish for a freeze. Swampert hates Toxic but takes almost nothing from Bronzong's attacks even without Defense investment and can wear it down with Waterfall or set up Stealth Rock. Nidoqueen is weak to Earthquake but tanks Bronzong's attacks reasonably well, which means that it can set up dual entry hazards against it or even deny the offensive set Trick Room turns with Protect. The same goes for Hippowdon, which walls Bronzong bar Toxic.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Offensive Trick Room",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This set is meant to capitalize on Bronzong's reasonable base Attack stat and the huge power of Gyro Ball to turn Bronzong's abysmal Speed into an advantage with Trick Room. It is a great late-game cleaner and a massive threat to fragile teams.</p> <p>Its terrible base 33 Speed with 0 IVs and a Brave nature makes it move first against everything in the tier when Trick Room is active. Additionally, its typing prevents it from being worn down by the common sand and provides a welcome resistance to Extreme Speed and Bullet Punch. Consequently, you generally have to stall out its 4-turn assault in order to get rid of it, unless you have a true counter. Also, Gyro Ball reaching up to 150-Base Power makes any fast and frail Pokemon such as Latias or Gengar very vulnerable to it. While the prominent Choice Scarf Rotom-A is not 2HKOed by Gyro Ball, Bronzong is great at forcing it in and wearing it down with Gyro Ball or even forcing it to use Trick, which is very undesirable, since Macho Brace halves its Speed. Trick Room is also great at turning the tides versus powerful setup sweepers, mainly all Dragon Dance users. Bronzong notably can sponge +1 Dragonite's Outrage and set up Trick Room to shift the momentum to your advantage, force Taunt Gyarados into mind games between Explosion and Trick Room, and maim boosted Tyranitar with Gyro Ball. Earthquake provides adequate coverage and lands clean OHKOs against Steel-types such as Magnezone and Heatran, deals heavy damage to foes like Jirachi, Metagross, Lucario, and Empoleon, and can also assist in wearing down bulky Water-types. Explosion works well as a final blow, which allows Bronzong to go for a quick KO when Trick Room is ending or pass the baton to another teammate that could make great use of the twisted dimensions.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs maximize Bronzong's poor base HP; with its large number of resistances and only one weakness, it becomes a bulky sweeper. 252 Attack EVs power up its attacks and make sweeping possible. The final 4 EVs are placed in Special Defense to help Bronzong sponge Latias's Draco Meteor or Gengar's Shadow Ball. Minimum Speed IVs and a Speed-hindering nature maximize Gyro Ball's power and allow Bronzong to move before all other Pokemon during Trick Room. Thanks to Macho Brace, Bronzong's 150-Base Power Gyro Ball hits any Pokemon with at least base 75 Speed hard, which helps it break through slower threats. Additionally, Pokemon like Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Latias may feel compelled to use Trick to reduce Bronzong's options, but receiving a Macho Brace can be incredibly detrimental to each, as for example, it enables Gyarados to outspeed both. Levitate grants Bronzong the opportunity to check Ground-types and gives it a Spikes immunity. Leftovers can be an alternative if you want to rely more on Bronzong setting up Trick Room for another Pokemon than sweeping, since it gives more survivability. However, it considerably hampers Gyro Ball's damage against slow threats and can cause it to miss crucial KOs.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The best way to use Bronzong is to bring it in on a resisted move such as Latias's Draco Meteor or Choice-locked Flygon's Earthquake to start setting up a Trick Room freely. Foes like Starmie, Zapdos, and Rotom can stop Bronzong's sweep, which is why dedicated Trick Room sweepers that can handle them and keep up the pressure will make sure you get the most mileage out of Bronzong's utility. While some of your other Pokemon should be able to take decent advantage of Trick Room, they should not all be dedicated Trick Room sweepers because Bronzong cannot repeatedly set up the field effect. Also, if your opponent's team is revealed to be weak to Bronzong, they may have to resort to stalling out Trick Room, so try to play around that and hit a Magnezone aiming to tank Gyro Ball with a powerful Earthquake, for example.</p> <p>Bronzong has great power, but it will much more often 2HKO a foe than OHKO one, especially if it resists Gyro Ball; therefore, it is usually a great idea to weaken its counter before sending it on the field, since it is not exactly bulky to begin with and can end up being worn down quickly or having its sweep stopped by a solid counter. Alternatively, Bronzong can use Explosion to weaken a Skarmory or a Hippowdon, for example, to bring in another offensive threat that will take advantage of the resulting chip damage. Bronzong often needs Explosion to break through specific threats, so make sure you don't need it anymore before giving up its last breath. Also, be careful not to waste Gyro Ball's PP too quickly, since Pokemon with recovery can stall it out, especially those that have Pressure.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Band Tyranitar is excellent support for Bronzong, as together, they form one of the most recognizable offensive cores for taking down offense while also pressuring stall significantly. Under Trick Room, Tyranitar is able to score many KOs against frail teams that cannot stall out four turns of STAB Choice Band-boosted Stone Edge or Crunch even with adequate resistances, while Tyranitar can also overwhelm bulkier teams thanks to its unmatched power. Stealth Rock is almost required, as the residual damage helps Bronzong's Gyro Ball secure several KOs. Tyranitar is also good at setting up the entry hazard because it not only resists Bronzong's only weakness but also works well under Trick Room if the situation requires it. Additionally, it can take out Rotom-A, which is a big pain for Bronzong, as it can burn it or waste Trick Room turns. Tyranitar is also helpful against defensive Zapdos, which will quickly deplete Bronzong's PP with Pressure and Roost. Additionally, Sand Stream helps at pressuring bulky Water-types as well as the aforementioned threats. Heatran can take advantage of Will-O-Wisp users such as Rotom-A for a Flash Fire boost and set up Stealth Rock; in return, Bronzong supports Choice Scarf Heatran in particular by shutting down threats that it does not reliably cover such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Tyranitar. Infernape can find opportunities to switch into Will-O-Wisp as well, but it can be a bit risky. That said, while Infernape does not work well under Trick Room, Bronzong supports it very well otherwise by pressuring Latias and Gengar; in return, Infernape can threaten and eliminate Steel-types or some Water-types that resist Gyro Ball.</p> <p>Swampert is an interesting option, as it is a Stealth Rock setter that shares great defensive and offense synergy with Bronzong. A specially offensive Swampert can lure physical walls like Skarmory, Rotom-A, and opposing Swampert and nuke them with a Modest STAB-boosted Hydro Pump while also being able to fire off powerful assaults under Trick Room. Choice Band Swampert and other physical variants are also great, as they form an overwhelming physical core with Bronzong. A core of Swampert + Bronzong + Tyranitar is threatening offensively but requires defensive backup to cover the shared weaknesses against Water-types and Breloom. For that reason, Choice Specs Latias with Sleep Talk is useful, since it pivots into Breloom, provides nice weaponry to deal with bulky Water-types, and also resists Fire-type moves. For similar reasons, Choice Band Dragonite is a great addition. Choice Specs Kingdra is another interesting one thanks to its unique palette of resistances, access to Sleep Talk, and ability to force damage on Water-types. Occasionally, it can also score some KOs under Trick Room. Dragon Dance Dragonite, Gyarados, and Kingdra have excellent typing synergy with Bronzong while benefiting from the holes it creates in the opposing team and vice versa.</p> <p>Skarmory is one of the easiest ways to prevent Bronzong from sweeping, and it can also make it fodder to set up Spikes or even heal itself. As a result, Bronzong really wants its teammates to help circumvent a potential Skarmory weakness. Magnezone is the obvious number one option to patch this immediately, but any way to lure or just overwhelm it in general can make the team function nicely. Magnezone can also trap opposing Bronzong, thanks to Magnet Rise, and bulky Swords Dance Scizor, which is definitely helpful.</p> "

        "name": "Tank",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Tank Bronzong is a flagship set in the DPP metagame. This set takes advantage of Bronzong's above-average mixed bulk and wonderful defensive typing in order to sponge as many hits as possible, which in turn allows Bronzong to shut down a vast array of threats, providing it some momentum to set up Stealth Rock. This set is incredibly reliable against offensive archetypes because it's tough to beat and hits frail enemies hard. However, it has some trouble pressuring bulkier teams, which often feature Skarmory and other allies that can sponge its attacks. This includes bulky Starmie with Recover + Rapid Spin that can potentially keep Bronzong's entry hazards away, but a fast 3 Attacks + Rapid Spin set is significantly pressured. Gyro Ball is Bronzong's strongest STAB attack overall, doing great neutral damage to anything bar slow enemies like Clefable. Alternatively, Bronzong can opt for coverage with Hidden Power Ice to avoid PP issues and deal with Gliscor, Dragonite, Flygon, and Breloom at the same time, while Payback is a great offensive tool to pressure foes like Starmie, Gengar, Rotom, and Latias. Earthquake enables Bronzong to hit Infernape and Steel-types like Magnezone and Heatran, which otherwise laugh at it. Toxic horribly cripples Water-types such as Suicune, Milotic, Swampert, and Gyarados and other foes that resist its moves like Zapdos and Rotom-A. It can also surprise stallbreaker Gliscor, which doesn't always want to Taunt Bronzong straight away. Protect is a useful alternative to scout Choice item users and pick up additional Leftovers recovery that can also be used with Toxic to rack up additional damage. Another option worth considering is Explosion, which allows Bronzong to check a problematic foe and stops threats like Gyarados and Suicune from setting up on it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mixed bulk is great to let Bronzong handle a wide array of both physically and specially oriented sweepers. 252 HP EVs maximize Bronzong's poor base HP, which is optimal for maximized durability. 128 Special Defense and Defense EVs with a Sassy nature make for a great emphasis on mixed bulk, allowing Bronzong to sponge common special attacks such as Draco Meteor, Fire Blast, Hidden Power Fire, Shadow Ball, and Hydro Pump as well as avoid being worn down too quickly by physical attackers like Jirachi, Tyranitar, Gyarados, and Swampert. Levitate grants Bronzong the opportunity to check Ground-types, such as Mamoswine and Flygon, which its typing wouldn't normally allow it to do. Additionally, Bronzong's Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs decrease its Speed to make Gyro Ball stronger, though its nature should be Careful if you do not use it. Leftovers provides a form of passive recovery, which is crucial on such a defensive Pokemon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bronzong should be used as a pivot throughout the match. Take advantage of the great number of Pokemon Bronzong checks and use any given opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. However, keep in mind that it lacks reliable recovery and can get worn down pretty quickly. Similarly, Bronzong does not appreciate losing its Leftovers, so be wary of Knock Off when facing foes like Gliscor, Clefable, and Empoleon. If you are using Protect, be careful to not use it excessively when there are Pokemon on the opposing team that can use Bronzong as setup bait, such as Breloom and Skarmory. If you spot a Choice-locked Pokemon, use Protect to scout it out. Keep Toxic concealed for a bit to increase its surprise value and potentially land it on a foe like Gliscor or Milotic. Be also careful not to waste Gyro Ball's low PP too quickly, since it can be stalled out over the course of a game, especially by Pressure users like Suicune and Zapdos. Use Gyro Ball on more offensive Starmie and Earthquake on more defensive ones, which do not run maximum Speed investment. If you suspect your opponent is running an archetype that could feature Magnezone, try to hit it with Earthquake as it may switch in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Bronzong set tends to work well on its own and does not requires specific support from its teammates, as its objective is basically to set up Stealth Rock and attack opposing Pokemon with Gyro Ball or cripple them with Toxic. However, Bronzong fits best on balanced teams that can take advantage of its resistances and durability. Water-types such as Suicune and Starmie appreciate Bronzong's ability to switch into almost any variant of Latias as well as Grass-types such as Celebi, while they deal with Bronzong's lone Fire-type weakness. The same goes for Swampert, but you should be careful about not giving Breloom too many opportunities to come in, as it can be relatively annoying to handle for balanced teams. If you're using Water-types alongside Bronzong, Pokemon such as Latias and Zapdos work well alongside the bell, as they are both great counters to Breloom and provide a welcome Fighting resistance. On top of that, Zapdos helps deal with Water-types, which give Bronzong some trouble. Therefore, a core of Bronzong + Zapdos + Starmie provides a great defensive balance with an interesting offensive synergy. More generally, Pokemon that can sponge attacks from Fire-types and force them out are always great teammates to consider. This makes any Dragon-type a great teammate. Dragonite helps deal with Breloom and Fire-type moves, but you should keep in mind that switching into Stealth Rock repeatedly can wear it down quickly.</p> <p>Tyranitar is always a good teammate because it is a solid check for Starmie and Rotom-A, provides support against Zapdos, and resists Fire-type moves while getting up sandstorm, which chips down some of Bronzong's checks, whereas Bronzong is immune to it. As for example, Starmie, Rotom-A, and Breloom are limited in their use by sand. Another support option to consider is Toxic Spikes, since it allows Bronzong to stall out Water-types and cripple foes like Infernape and Tyranitar. With the use of Protect and sand damage, it will be even more effective. Nidoqueen in particular is great at doing this job alongside Bronzong, as it provides a solid Fighting-type resistance and can switch into Zapdos or Tyranitar to put Toxic Spikes up. Heatran works well by its side, as it can sponge Fire-type attacks and take advantage of Toxic Spikes with moves like Substitute, Magma Storm, and Protect while completing a solid defensive core. You should consider covering the Water-type weakness, however. Rotom-A also makes great use of Toxic Spikes, since it can deny Starmie's Rapid Spin and make Tyranitar suffer when it switches into Thunderbolt alongside poison damage. As Bronzong lacks a reliable instant recovery move, Wish users such as Clefable, Jirachi, and even Latias can help improve its longevity.</p> <p>Skarmory is one of Bronzong's bigger threats due to its ability to stack Spikes freely against it. By annihilating Skarmory, Magnezone naturally provides great support. Magnezone also helps at dealing with other Steel-types such as Scizor, Jirachi, Bronzong, and even Swords Dance Lucario if running Choice Scarf. The combination of Magnezone and tank Bronzong works on both offensive and defensive teams. Dragon Dance Dragonite and Choice Specs Latias would make great additions for an offensive approach, while Milotic or defensive Latias would complete a synergistic defensive core. Finally, Starmie is another great teammate to consider for Rapid Spin, especially if you run Dragonite or Zapdos. It also covers Fire-type moves and carries Thunderbolt to weaken Water-types for Bronzong. Your own Electric- and Grass-types in general can also serve well to wear down and threaten bulky Water-types.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Stealth Rock",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Bronzong can pull off a great offensive pivot set. This set is designed to benefit the team by using every opportunity to switch in to set up Stealth Rock while remaining as threatening as possible in order not to get walled by defensive archetypes. The combination of great coverage, a strong STAB move in Gyro Ball, Explosion, and being almost impossible to one-shot is what makes Bronzong that reliable. Gyro Ball nails foes such as Gengar, Latias, Tyranitar, and Dragonite that struggle to break through Bronzong's uninvested defenses. Earthquake provides adequate coverage, as it is always a favorable option for nailing Heatran, Infernape, Metagross, and Magnezone. Explosion rounds out the set by allowing a teammate to switch in for free after Bronzong's job is done while possibly KOing an opposing Pokemon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment with Bronzong's natural base defensive stats gives it great all-around bulk, which lets it tank both physical and special attacks. Maximum Attack EVs, in addition to powering up Explosion, allow Bronzong to deal heavy damage to common switch-ins such as Starmie and Breloom, as well as OHKOing any non-Shuca Berry variant of Heatran and Magnezone and hitting Jirachi for a huge chunk with Earthquake. The final 4 EVs are placed in Special Defense to help Bronzong sponge Latias's Draco Meteor or Gengar's Shadow Ball. A Brave nature with 0 Speed IVs decreases Bronzong's Speed to make Gyro Ball stronger. Levitate grants Bronzong the opportunity to check Ground-types and gives it a Spikes immunity. Occa Berry stops Bronzong from being forced out by Infernape and Heatran while providing more comfort against Dragonite and Jirachi's Fire-type coverage in order to set up Stealth Rock or use Explosion with more ease. Lum Berry can be a great item for a lead set, as it prevents sleep inducers such as Roserade and Breloom from statusing Bronzong and avoids confusion from Machamp. Assuming that no one will use a Ground-type move against Bronzong, Heatproof instead of Levitate is another option on a lead set that provides a free Occa Berry, allowing Bronzong to effectively run both Occa and Lum or Custap Berry. Alternatively, Leftovers is an option for increased longevity, while Custap Berry capitalizes on Bronzong's low Speed to set up Stealth Rock or go for a surprise KO with Explosion when it falls under 25% HP.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switch Bronzong into a Pokemon it checks or counters and proceed to set up Stealth Rock. Don't use Bronzong as a tank; it lacks staying power and does not have the required defensive investment to reliably check the threats it should check more than once. Thus, you should limit the number of times Bronzong switches in. If you find that Bronzong is not healthy enough to pivot anymore, using Explosion is a good exit door. Also, be careful about taking a Will-O-Wisp from a Rotom forme or using Explosion on it. Even if Bronzong is not supposed to survive for a long time, be careful not to waste Gyro Ball's PP too quickly. Gyro Ball should be used on more offensive Starmie and Earthquake on more defensive variants, as you do not want to waste your PP on a Pokemon that can Recover stall Gyro Ball. If you suspect your opponent to run an archetype that could feature Magnezone, try to scout potential Magnezone switch-ins with Earthquake.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Bronzong set tends to work well on its own and requires little support from its teammates. However, this set works great on teams that make heavy use of early Stealth Rock and benefit from the holes that Bronzong can potentially create. More precisely, Bronzong's ability to set Stealth Rock reliably against a wide variety of threats and force damage with Explosion makes it a nice fit for physically-based offense. Its ability to attract bulky Water-types and eliminate them provides any Tyranitar set more freedom when it enters the field. For example, Dragon Dance Tyranitar can set up more confidently when foes like Suicune or Swampert are gone. Thanks to STAB Pursuit, Tyranitar can eliminate the prevalent Rotom-A and Starmie, which cause Bronzong some trouble. Also, Bronzong's Steel typing makes it immune to Tyranitar's sand, which on the other hand inflicts useful free chip damage on foes like bulky Water-types and Zapdos. Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite are great options alongside it, since they both benefit from having bulky Water-, Ground-, and Steel-types being chipped down and a free entry onto the field after Bronzong's Explosion. They also provide a suitable answer to Fire-type moves, while Bronzong helps by tanking Rock-type moves and Draco-Meteor or Outrage from Choice Scarf Latias and Flygon they are vulnerable to. Additional physical attackers such as Metagross, Machamp, Lucario, Swampert, and Scizor are greatly appreciated by its side as they wear down shared counters. Choice Specs Kingdra can be interesting for any team running Bronzong, as it is capable of surprising physical walls, muscle through bulky Water-types such as Milotic or Suicune and check offensive threats that are the like of Heatran, Infernape or Starmie. Mixed Dragonite and Flygon are also both capable of putting high pressure on defensive cores that feature bulky Water-types, Electric-types such as Zapdos or Rest Talk Rotom and even Ground- or Steel-types that all give Bronzong troubles. In terms of managing Steel-types, Magnezone is an obvious teammate option as it instantly deletes Skarmory and provides suitable help against Jirachi, Scizor and opposing Bronzong. Finally, Bronzong's awful Speed tends to be exploited by Breloom which can incapacitate it with Spore, so having a way to deal with it is definitely great. Choice Specs Latias or Choice Band Dragonite with Sleep Talk resist any of Breloom's STAB attacks, can absorb Spore and OHKO it back with Draco Meteor or Outrage, respectively.</p> "

  "Spiritomb": {
    "overview": "<p>Spiritomb often faces stiff competition from the Rotom formes as a spinblocker due to their useful resistances, wide and unique movepools, and Levitate. However, unlike Rotom-A, it doesn't sport a nasty Dark-type weakness which can be exploited by physical behemoths such as Tyranitar and Scizor. Spiritomb is a solid and effective check to major threats such as Rotom-A, Machamp, Azelf, and Lucario, and access to Pressure further sets it apart from other bulky Ghost-types, as Spiritomb can PP stall many Pokemon to death. Spiritomb is also one of the only few true Machamp counters. Overall, Spiritomb has enough to set itself apart from the Rotom formes, and can function as an effective spinblocker even in the Standard environment.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sucker Punch is Spiritomb's strongest priority move, but is unreliable and has low PP, making it a bad choice for a mono-attacking option; Shadow Sneak might be considered for its reliability, but it is too weak to deal significant damage. Pain Split can be used to recover health as well as inflict damage, but Rest is more reliable. Taunt prevents Pokemon from setting up entry hazards and shuts down opposing walls. A Trick + Choice item set can be used to mess up various walls, though several other Pokemon outclass Spiritomb for this role. Finally, Spiritomb has boosting options in Calm Mind and Nasty Plot, but it's sadly too slow to sweep effectively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Heatran walks all over Spiritomb, as it resists both Shadow Ball and Dark Pulse while taking even Hidden Power Fighting comfortably, gets a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp, and can take it out with its powerful Fire-type attacks. Setup sweepers with Taunt, such as Gyarados, do a great job of checking Spiritomb as well, as they can shut it down completely and proceed to set up on it. Blissey doesn't mind taking a Will-O-Wisp thanks to Natural Cure, and laughs at Spiritomb's other attacks as well, though it can only slap a Toxic back on Spiritomb. Choice Band users such as Metagross, Dragonite, and Scizor can muscle through weakened Spiritomb with their sheer power, though they need to be careful when switching in, as Will-O-Wisp will severely cripple them. Finally, if Spiritomb lacks Taunt, Pokemon such as Skarmory and Forretress can freely switch in and use it as setup bait.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "RestTalk",
        "description": "<p>Spiritomb's main attraction over Rotom-A is that it is not Pursuit bait, and this set aims to take advantage of that. Rest allows Spiritomb to recover HP while curing status. Sleep Talk as always, pairs well with Rest; it ensures that Spiritomb isn't a sitting duck for two turns, and if it selects Will-O-Wisp, Spiritomb can actually spread burns even when asleep. Will-O-Wisp shuts down most physical attackers, and the residual damage caused by the burn allows Spiritomb to wear down many threats. Shadow Ball is used as the STAB, mono-attacking option over Dark Pulse for two reasons: Spiritomb is too slow to abuse Dark Pulse's chance to flinch, and the occasional Special Defense drops afforded by Shadow Ball can actually force switches.</p> <p>Taunt can be used over Sleep Talk to prevent Pokemon such as Skarmory and Forretress from setting up entry hazards, as they are common switch-ins to Spiritomb. Hidden Power Fighting can replace Will-O-Wisp as it gives Spiritomb perfect coverage alongside Shadow Ball, but spreading burns and shutting down physical attackers are too good to pass up. Pursuit can be used over Shadow Ball with a Careful nature to make Spiritomb a better check to Gengar, Starmie, and Azelf. Alternative EV spreads can be used too: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature balances Spiritomb's defenses after inflicting a burn, and 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD with a Bold nature to make Spiritomb a better physical wall.</p> <p>Though Spiritomb itself functions as a team player, it will need quite some support to be effective. Tanks such as Heatran and Blissey walk all over Spiritomb, as they can freely switch into Will-O-Wisp or Shadow Ball and wear it down, or in Blissey's case, force it to use Rest by hitting it with Toxic and switch to a counter. A strong Fighting-type thus makes a good teammate, as it can OHKO both of the aforementioned tanks. Infernape in particular also takes down Pokemon such as Skarmory and Forretress, who commonly use Spiritomb as setup bait, as well as Scizor, who can hurt Spiritomb with a Choice Band U-turn, making it an excellent partner for Spiritomb. Ironically, Blissey and Skarmory too make great teammates; the former sponges powerful special attacks for Spiritomb, while the latter sets up entry hazards that wear Spiritomb's checks down and Skarmory can OHKO Breloom with Brave Bird, who can prove to be troublesome with its immunity to Will-O-Wisp once Toxic Orb activates. Spiritomb also aids in safeguarding Skarmory's entry hazards with its ability to spinblock.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Curse",
        "description": "<p>Although this set is a gimmicky one, it works well when used properly. It is particularly useful on a stall team as the main purpose of this set is to wear down Pokemon using Curse and Will-O-Wisp. Since Spiritomb has three immunities and no weaknesses, it forces a lot of switches. Pursuit is therefore the preferred STAB move as its power doubles when the target switches out. This allows Spiritomb to trap various early and late game threats such as Gengar, Starmie, and Azelf, which are all weak to Pursuit. Spiritomb can also take on Pokemon that set-up later in the game, such as Snorlax and Suicune, with this set as it can wear them down very quickly with both Curse and Will-O-Wisp. This is also very helpful to stall teams which are unable to deal with set up Pokemon, especially when they are the last Pokemon left and cannot be phazed. These traits are the reasons to consider using Spiritomb over Rotom-A.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Spiritomb's Special Defense because Will-O-Wisp halves the burnt target's Attack, reducing the need to have a high Defense EVs investment. Shadow Ball with Calm nature can be used over Pursuit with Careful nature. Calm nature also helps in increasing Spiritomb's special bulk. However, Pursuit with a Careful nature is usually the better option.</p> <p>A cleric is highly recommended as this set does not carry Sleep Talk, leaving Spiritomb a setup bait as it sleeps for two turns after using Rest. Since Spiritomb often replaces Rotom-A, most teams do not have a reliable way to take down Skarmory and Gyarados. Therefore a Choice Scarf Jirachi with Thunder Punch helps in solving this problem. Gyarados has to be wary of Will-O-Wisp but it can hold a Lum Berry to cure its burn. A Rapid Spinner helps Spiritomb a lot because for Spiritomb to set up a Curse, it will need to be at a substantial amount of health. As far as teammates go, Blissey is a great option as it can wake Spiritomb from its slumber after the latter uses Rest or pass Wishes to Spiritomb. Several physical walls such as Steelix, Skarmory, and Forretress all make good teammates. They can also sponge physical attacks from foes which are not affected by Will-O-Wisp or have the Guts ability.</p> "

  "Lucario": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written in 2009; it is being rewritten to reflect modern DPP OU.</p> <p>Lucario is one of the top offensive threats of DPP OU, boasting high Attack and Special Attack stats, decent Speed, great STAB attacks in Close Combat and Aura Sphere, and many other useful attacking options. Its immunity to Toxic Spikes and numerous 4x and 2x resistances (most notably to Rock-, Dark-, and Dragon-type attacks) give Lucario many opportunities to switch in and wreak havoc on the opposing team. While it does have auspicious typing, Lucario's defensive stats leave much to be desired, and its relative frailty remains its largest weakness. In spite of that, Lucario is an extremely worthwhile addition to any team, and is almost certain to leave its mark on the opponent.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Maxing out Attack and Speed is recommended for the Swords Dance and Choice Band sets. The same goes for the Choice Specs set, but with Special Attack instead of Attack. Otherwise, the given EVs will do for the appropriate sets. A slightly bulkier spread for the Swords Dance set is 252 HP / 96 Def / 136 SpD / 24 Spe with an Adamant nature and Leftovers, which makes better use of Lucario's numerous resistances and gives you some extra durability while setting up.</p> <p>On the Choice Specs set, the choice between Dark Pulse and Shadow Ball comes down to the flinch rate versus the Special Defense drop. Shadow Ball is generally more useful for the special sets, which will enjoy getting a Special Defense drop on the switch and could not use the flinch against faster opponents anyway. Lucario can also run a mixed set, but this will involve losing Speed to make full use of it, so this is typically better left to Infernape. Calm Mind is another option for Lucario to boost its Special Attack and give it a bit of special bulk. It gives it an easier time against the Rotom formes, for example, and after a few boosts, it will be hard to deal with via special attacks. However, the Swords Dance set is a better stallbreaker, and Lucario may find it hard to get in enough Calm Minds to sweep.</p> <p>Focus Sash is a decent alternative item on the Swords Dance set, as it can ensure a second Swords Dance if you can keep the field clear of hail, Spikes, and Stealth Rock. Lucario can also make use of a Shuca Berry and Ice Punch to take down Gliscor and Hippowdon. Lucario can even use Ice Punch without a Shuca Berry on the standard Swords Dance set, but its most common target, Gliscor, usually EVs itself to outpace Jolly Lucario (but hitting it on the switch is a distinct possibility). Like most Pokemon, Lucario can use Choice Scarf with either a physical, special, or mixed movepool. Lucario also makes a decent Reversal user, since he is immune to sandstorm damage; however, the prevalence of priority attacks in OU means that it is much harder for this set to sweep when compared to Lucario's Swords Dance set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The first step to countering Lucario is knowing the set. Physical variants are the most difficult to counter since there are many possible combinations of attacks. Hippowdon can switch into nearly any physical Lucario set, survive an attack, and OHKO with Earthquake; it also has access to reliable recovery to ensure that it can perform this job repeatedly throughout the match. Gliscor can take any physical attack from Lucario barring Ice Punch, outpace Lucario with its base 95 Speed, and OHKO with Earthquake. Any set that does not run Stone Edge or Thunder Punch must worry about Gyarados. Without Crunch, Celebi makes a fine counter provided it has Psychic, Earth Power, or Hidden Power Fire; Rotom-A also performs well against Crunch-less Lucario. Even if Lucario does have Crunch, Timid Rotom-A can outpace Adamant Lucario and either burn it with Will-O-Wisp or OHKO it with Overheat (in the case of Rotom-H). SubCM Jirachi can use Substitute twice while Lucario fights back with Close Combat and then OHKO with Psychic, while physical Jirachi can OHKO after a Defense drop with Fire Punch. Suicune is also a great counter; its solid defenses allow it to take a +2 Close Combat and hit back with Surf. In addition, the offensive version outruns Lucario, can take a +2 Extreme Speed, and can take it down with Hydro Pump. Shaymin does the same work, both defensive and offensive variants. Gengar is immune to Close Combat and Extreme Speed and can OHKO with either Focus Blast or a Life Orb-boosted Hidden Power Fire, but it falls to the rare Bullet Punch Lucario.</p> <p>As far as special Lucario are concerned, Blissey beats most of them. Calm Blissey isn't 2HKOed by a Modest Choice Specs-boosted Aura Sphere and has Thunder Wave, Seismic Toss, and Flamethrower with which to juggle Lucario around with. Soft-Boiled, Wish, and Protect also make it difficult to kill a healthy Blissey with Lucario, so the only fear that Blissey should have is if Close Combat is present on the Choice Specs set. Spiritomb boasts an immunity to Aura Sphere and also has no weaknesses for Lucario to prey upon. The Special Defense drops from Shadow Ball and flinches from Dark Pulse can prove annoying, but the only attack Spiritomb should fear is a 2HKO from a Choice Specs-boosted Flash Cannon, which is almost never used. Gyarados is also a decent counter to the special Lucario sets thanks to its naturally high Special Defense. The RestTalk strategy is Gyarados's best way of countering the Choice Specs set. Zapdos fears the rare Hidden Power Ice or Rock, but it can switch into every other attack and send Lucario to the grim reaper with Heat Wave or STAB Thunderbolt. Unfortunately, Gyarados and Zapdos will take 25% Stealth Rock damage each time they switch in, so they should not be totally relied upon to counter Lucario.</p> <p>Cresselia and Dusknoir are fine switch-ins for Lucario provided they are not switching into Crunch or Shadow Ball. Cresselia can set up Reflect and use Thunder Wave to slow Lucario down while retaliating with Psychic and using Rest or Moonlight to recover health. Dusknoir is immune to Fighting-type attacks and Extreme Speed, and also takes little damage from Stone Edge and Ice Punch. Will-O-Wisp will cripple Lucario while Fire Punch, Earthquake, or Brick Break will make Lucario quickly crumble before Dusknoir. Choice Scarf Heatran cannot switch into Lucario directly but is a good check because it resists Bullet Punch and Extreme Speed and has Earth Power or STAB Fire Blast to take down Lucario. Choice Scarf Magnezone can switch into any non-Fighting attack, trap Lucario, and deal at least 75% with Thunderbolt. Choice Scarf Tyranitar must also take care not to switch into a Fighting-type attack, but can check and OHKO Lucario with Superpower or Earthquake provided it lacks Bullet Punch.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With one turn of setup, a 120 Base Power STAB attack, and one of the strongest priority moves available, Swords Dance Lucario is arguably the best late-game sweeper in OU. After a Swords Dance, even defensive Skarmory is OHKOed by Close Combat, assuming Stealth Rock damage and an Adamant nature. Meanwhile, many of the Pokemon that are faster than Lucario are frail enough to be OHKOed by Extreme Speed after a Swords Dance.</p> <p>The final move is the most difficult to choose. If bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types like Rotom-A and Celebi are of concern, Crunch is the best option. If Flying-types are giving Lucario the blues, Stone Edge is generally more useful. Bullet Punch can also be used to hit Pokemon that resist or are immune to Normal-type attacks and are faster than Lucario, such as Gengar and Choice Scarf Tyranitar. While it may be tempting to replace Extreme Speed with Bullet Punch, it isn't advised due to Extreme Speed's ability to effectively hit Starmie, Jolteon, and Infernape, along with its higher Base Power.</p> <p>To show how powerful this set is, here are some calculations against various Pokemon after a single Swords Dance. These calculations assume an Adamant nature.</p> <ul> <li>Close Combat vs. 252/252+ Skarmory: 84.4% - 99.7% <li>Close Combat vs. 252/0+ Skarmory: 101.5% - 119.5%</li> <li>Close Combat vs. 252/252+ Bronzong: 95.2% - 100%</li> <li>Close Combat vs. 252/176+ Hippowdon: 80.7% - 95%</li> <li>Crunch vs. 252/220+ Celebi: 81.2% - 95.5%</li> <li>Crunch vs. 252/252+ Rotom-A: 100% - 117.8%</li> <li>Extreme Speed vs. 0/0 Starmie: 97.3% - 114.6%</li> <li>Extreme Speed vs 0/0 Zapdos: 79.1% - 93.1%</li> <li>Bullet Punch vs. 0/0 Gengar: 95.8% - 113%</li> <li>Bullet Punch vs. 0/0 Tyranitar: 89.7% - 105.6%</li> <li>Stone Edge (+1) vs. 156/96 Gyarados: 121.6% - 143.2%</li> <li>Stone Edge vs. 248/228+ Zapdos: 118% - 138.9%</li> </ul> <p>Whether you choose an Adamant or Jolly nature depends on your team. Adamant gets important OHKOs against Bronzong and Skarmory, but a Jolly nature allows Lucario to outspeed Jolly Gyarados, Timid Suicune, and Timid Rotom-A.</p> <p>Having a Pokemon on your team that attracts Pursuit is very useful as this is one of the easiest ways for Lucario to set up a Swords Dance. Gengar, Choice Scarf Rotom-A, and Starmie are great options for this role. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Azelf, Heatran, Infernape, Metagross, and Swampert is very helpful since it allows Lucario to OHKO Pokemon such as Bronzong and Skarmory with a +2 Close Combat. Stealth Rock also makes it much tougher for Gyarados and Zapdos to continuously switch into Lucario if you decide against Stone Edge.</p> "

        "name": "Agility",
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Lucario has become one of the most popular sets around, which has caused many counters and checks to arise and prevent it from sweeping. Agility Lucario is designed to take advantage of Swords Dance Lucario's popularity and beat all of its common checks and counters, such as Gengar, Rotom-A, Gliscor, Dragonite, Choice Scarf Heatran, Magnezone, Tyranitar, and Jirachi. Lucario is also fully capable of late-game sweeping once you discover and weaken your opponent's team. Close Combat provides Lucario with a powerful STAB move to use, while Crunch and Ice Punch are used for additional coverage to hit the Pokemon that aren't threatened by Close Combat.</p> <p>Lucario can set up against any opponent it has a good chance to force out, such as Tyranitar locked into Pursuit or Blissey (watch out for Thunder Wave or Flamethrower). If you were using Swords Dance Lucario, even if you have the perfect opportunity to set up, counters such as Dragonite and Gliscor can switch in on the Swords Dance and OHKO Lucario before it has a chance to attack. This means that you need to predict the opponent's switch-in correctly in order to sweep with Swords Dance Lucario efficiently. With Agility Lucario, on the other hand, this is not a problem because it outpaces the aforementioned threats and OHKOes them first. This is one of the major selling points of Agility Lucario; it is easier to use than Swords Dance Lucario in that it requires less prediction to sweep.</p> <p>The Speed EVs give Lucario the ability to outpace virtually everyone after an Agility, as well as giving it enough Speed to outpace Timid Heatran if you can't pull off an Agility. However, because Lucario doesn't need to run max Speed to be effective with Agility, there are alternative Speed EVs you can use. With 188 Speed EVs, Lucario outruns Jolly Breloom, Metagross, and Adamant Gyarados before an Agility. Furthermore, he also outspeeds Timid Choice Scarf Gengar after an Agility. If you want less Speed for more bulk, 126 Speed EVs can instead be used to outpace defensive Celebi and Zapdos, as well as Jolly Tyranitar, before an Agility. Also, after an Agility, those 126 Speed EVs allow you to outpace both Choice Scarf Jirachi and Flygon. The remainder of the EVs could be put into either of Lucario's defenses to give it an easier time setting up and sweeping.</p> <p>Since Agility Lucario is weaker than its Swords Dance counterpart, entry hazard support is crucial to this set's success; Stealth Rock and Spikes make it easier for Lucario to grab KOs against the likes of Celebi, Suicune, and Jirachi. Swampert is one of the most reliable Stealth Rock users in the metagame, as its overall bulk and great typing nearly guarantee a Stealth Rock setup. Skarmory and Forretress, who also has Rapid Spin, are excellent users of Spikes, and both are even able to use Stealth Rock on the same set thanks to their great physical durability. Both Swampert and Skarmory also have the ability to phaze, racking up even more residual damage against the opponent.</p> <p>Ghost-types are necessary on a team with Lucario, as they prevent Rapid Spin users from removing your entry hazards. Rotom-A is a great option, as it has the bulk and typing to repeatedly switch into most Rapid Spinners, as well as packing immunities to Lucario's Fighting- and Ground-type weaknesses. As a bonus, Rotom-A attracts Choiced Pursuit users, such as Choice Band Scizor and Choice Scarf Tyranitar, giving Lucario a great opportunity to set up and sweep. Speaking of Rotom-A, defensive versions can be troublesome as they can withstand Lucario's Crunch, dealing 54% - 64%, and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Heatran makes a great teammate because of this, absorbing Will-O-Wisp for a Flash Fire boost and retaliating with a powerful Fire Blast. Heatran is also capable of dispatching Skarmory, another Pokemon that threatens Lucario with its high physical bulk.</p> <p>On top of focusing primarily on entry hazards, utilizing extremely hard-hitting Pokemon to break down the defensive core of the opponent is strongly recommended. Choice Specs Porygon-Z and Choice Band Dragonite are prime examples of these, as their ridiculously powerful Tri Attack and Outrage, respectively, obliterate anyone that isn't defensive enough. Other powerful Pokemon to look into include Gyarados, Infernape, and Tyranitar. Additionally, should Lucario be KOed during its sweep, the previously mentioned sweepers are able to take advantage of the opposing weakened team to clean up the remains.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Lucario is not a purely physical beast; its base 115 Special Attack is actually the higher of its two attacking stats, and a Choice Specs set can inflict massive damage on many of Swords Dance Lucario's physically bulky counters.</p> <p>Lucario's STAB Aura Sphere is an all-around great attack with decent power and perfect accuracy. Shadow Ball gives Lucario perfect type coverage in conjunction with Aura Sphere and is its best attack against the Ghost- and Psychic-types which may try to switch into expected Fighting-type attacks. Dragon Pulse also provides perfect coverage with Aura Sphere, but more importantly, 2HKOes Lucario's common Gyarados and Gliscor switch-ins. Hidden Power Rock is also an option to hit Flying-type Pokemon, but the Speed IV lost can be significant in Lucario mirror matches and against Timid Heatran (instead of outpacing it by one point, Lucario now ties). Lucario's final attack is STAB Vacuum Wave, which is useful against faster, frailer Pokemon and anything attempting a sweep at low health.</p> <p>Specially defensive Zapdos performs quite well against this set since it can Roost off damage and hit Lucario with Heat Wave or Thunderbolt. However, it must beware of Hidden Power Rock, which 2HKOes it. While Gliscor takes heavy damage from Shadow Ball and Dragon Pulse, it can usually outpace Lucario and retaliate with Earthquake. If Choice Scarf Magnezone switches into Shadow Ball or Dragon Pulse, it can trap Lucario and do at least 75% with Thunderbolt. Spiritomb is uncommon but causes problems for this set since it isn't 2HKOed by any attack while it 2HKOes in return with Hidden Power Fighting. Once your opponent has determined that Lucario is a special attacker, Blissey can switch in, survive two Aura Spheres (as long as it is Calm), and cripple Lucario with Thunder Wave or hit it hard with Flamethrower.</p> <p>Since this set is great at luring in Pokemon such as Gliscor, Gyarados, and Rotom-A and either OHKOing or 2HKOing them, Pokemon that can take advantage of their absence are great partners. Swords Dance Scizor, Agility Metagross, and Dragon Dance Gyarados make solid partners since Rotom-A is a common counter to all three. Tyranitar is a nice partner since it appreciates having Gliscor out of the way. Tyranitar can also counter Zapdos and switch into Blissey relatively easily, although it is not a fan of Toxic or Thunder Wave. Heatran can deal with Spiritomb and does well against Magnezone provided it's in good health. Stealth Rock support is also much appreciated, since it is needed to guarantee 2HKOs against Gyarados, Gliscor, and defensive Rotom-A with Dragon Pulse.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Though typically seen as a Swords Dance sweeper, Lucario is more than capable of trading in its Life Orb for a Choice Scarf to pick off dangerous foes instead of attempting a sweep. Lucario's offensive prowess, impressive palette of resistances, and novelty as a Choice Scarf user distinguish it from the competition. Altogether, these attributes make Lucario a potent and underrated revenge killer.</p> <p>Close Combat is Lucario's primary form of offense and one of the biggest selling points of this set; a fantastic move in its own right, the threat it poses is amplified when paired with Lucario's respectable Attack and boosted Speed. While Close Combat is useful for revenge killing specific threats such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar, opposing Lucario, and Kingdra, it does serve another purpose. Lucario's access to a move with sky-high Base Power and an excellent attacking type makes it considerably more threatening than a number of its fellow revenge killers. If Lucario's teammates can remove or weaken the Ghost-, Psychic-, and Flying-types on the opponent's team, Lucario can run straight through a battered lineup with its powerful STAB attack. Thunder Punch allows Lucario to OHKO Gyarados, while Ice Punch lets it OHKO Dragonite and the occasional Gliscor switch-in. Crunch is an excellent auxiliary attack, as it provides nearly unresisted coverage alongside Close Combat and can badly injure Ghost- and Psychic-types that attempt to sponge Lucario's Fighting-type moves. Stone Edge may look like an appealing alternative to Thunder Punch and Ice Punch, but, since it can't secure OHKOs on either Dragonite or Gyarados, it is generally an inferior option. With the four attacks listed above in its arsenal, Lucario can single-handedly revenge kill a large portion of the OU metagame.</p> <p>The EV spread is fairly straightforward; 252 Attack EVs allows Lucario to hit as hard as possible, while the Speed investment and Jolly nature are needed to outrun Jolteon, Scarf Rotom-A, and all variants of Dragonite and Gyarados after a Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Because of its inability to change moves and the power drop resulting from the item switch, Scarf Lucario is much easier to wall than its Life Orb counterpart. Although the primary goal of this set is to revenge kill threatening Pokemon rather than to consistently sweep a team, packing some solid answers to common Lucario switch-ins is still recommended. Bulky Water- and Ground-types can often switch into this set comfortably, as can Ghost-types like Rotom-A and Gengar (though they must be wary of Crunch). It's also worth noting that Lucario can be trapped by Magnezone and forced out by Heatran if it is locked into a move other than Close Combat, although both Pokemon may be hesitant to switch in directly.</p> <p>Specially Defensive Skarmory can help combat a few of these problems. It provides a Ground-type immunity, is a decent answer to a handful of Water-types, and is capable of scouting early in the game for Magnezone. The Spikes support Skarmory can supply will also make it more difficult for a number of opponents to safely switch into Lucario's attacks. Dragonite has excellent defensive synergy with Lucario, which allows it to enter the battlefield and set up against a large portion of the switch-ins that Lucario will encounter. Gengar's immunities to Ground- and Fighting-type moves make it another logical partner for Scarf Lucario. Gengar can typically set up a Substitute against Lucario checks such as Gliscor, Hippowdon, Shaymin, and Celebi; then, it can start launching attacks at the opposition without incurring much damage in the process.</p> "

        "name": "Attacking Lead",
        "description": "<p>Lucario's ability to quite literally \"counter\" common leads of OU with its versatility and power makes it a worthwhile lead. It is an ideal Counter lead due to Inner Focus, immunity to sandstorm, and the ability to use Swords Dance. Inner Focus prevents Infernape and Weavile from breaking Lucario's Focus Sash for free, while Lucario's Steel typing lets it Counter attacks from Hippowdon and Tyranitar without dying to sandstorm. Since many Lucario run Swords Dance, your opponent will be more likely to attack Lucario to thwart a potential set-up attempt.</p> <p>A combination of Close Combat and Extreme Speed will 2HKO common suicide leads like Aerodactyl and Infernape. Both of these attacks miss the 2HKO on Azelf, so Crunch is the recommended third attacking option. Counter's main use is against bulky leads such as Bronzong, Metagross, Swampert, and Hippowdon that you normally wouldn't be able to touch, and also helps against various attackers like Flygon, Mamoswine, and Machamp (although confusion makes Countering Machamp a tossup).</p> <p>A Lonely nature and a 0 Defense IV are used to maximize damage with Counter, while maximum Speed is required to outrun Heatran, which allows Lucario to OHKO it before it can do anything.</p> <p>Other possibilities in the third slot include assorted Hidden Powers; Hidden Power Grass 2HKOes Swampert, while Hidden Power Ice or Electric can be used against Gliscor and Gyarados, respectively. Magic Coat can be used to bounce Sleep Powder / Spore back at Roserade and Smeargle. Swords Dance can also be used as a sort of inverse Counter; while bulky leads would normally have the chance to set up, you can turn the tables and prepare for an early-game sweep. It is recommended that such a choice replace Counter to retain type coverage.</p> <p>Gyarados can set up on Lucario easily; Pokemon like Vaporeon and Suicune can be used to counter it and Choice Scarf Rotom-A is a good check. Since Scizor or Metagross may try to finish off Lucario with Bullet Punch after its Focus Sash activates, Magnezone can be a good partner to trap them. Dragon Dance Tyranitar can take advantage of Scizor and Metagross being taken out. Other Fighting-types, such as Heracross and Infernape, are good options for partners as this Lucario is a great way to scout your opponent's Fighting-type resistances in order to concentrate on taking them out. Since this lead doesn't set up Stealth Rock, you should have a Pokemon to set it up once Lucario has done its job. Heatran, Metagross, and Swampert are all good options for this.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Band equipped, Lucario can take advantage of the frequent switches it gets from its typing and break down the opposing team. While the Swords Dance set aims for a clean sweep, this set hits harder off the bat and aims to break down defensive pivots.</p> <p>Close Combat is Lucario's most powerful attack and will put a large dent in anything that does not resist it. It is important to remember that a neutral Close Combat does more damage than a super effective Crunch or Ice Punch, so those should only be used in the face of a resisted Close Combat or to exploit a 4x weakness. Extreme Speed hits Pokemon that are usually faster than Lucario, such as Starmie and Azelf. Bullet Punch is a fine option over Extreme Speed if your team needs help dealing with Gengar or Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Crunch allows Lucario to hit Celebi and Rotom-A for a 2HKO to clear the way for a Close Combat sweep later in the game. In the last slot, Stone Edge is an excellent attack to eliminate Gyarados and Zapdos with one attack, while Ice Punch will destroy any Gliscor that switch in.</p> <p>A Jolly nature can be used to outpace Impish Gliscor, Jolly Gyarados, Timid Rotom-A, Timid Suicune, and Modest Zapdos; however, Adamant is the preferred nature to take advantage of the boost from Choice Band and to make Extreme Speed a more powerful revenge killing tool.</p> <p>Since this set shares many of the same moves and counters with the Swords Dance set, the two sets also share effective teammates. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Vaporeon are great partners to deal with Gliscor and Gyarados if they have Hidden Power Electric. Heatran is a fine partner to scare off Celebi and Magnezone; unfortunately, Choice Scarf Magnezone will always be able to defeat Lucario as long as it doesn't switch directly into a Close Combat. Tyranitar is a solid partner to deal with Celebi, Zapdos, and Rotom-A. Life Orb Starmie can do a lot of damage to many of Lucario's counters. The combination of Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt gets OHKOs on Gliscor and Gyarados and 2HKOs on Celebi and Rotom-A. Stealth Rock support from Azelf, Heatran, Infernape, Metagross, or Swampert is very useful in hurting common switch-ins such as Gyarados and Zapdos.</p> "

  "Hippowdon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hippowdon is one of the bulkiest Pokemon in the metagame. With its gargantuan HP and Defense and Ground typing, Hippowdon is one of the best defensive answers to Tyranitar, which can almost never 2HKO Hippowdon without a way to boost its damage output like Choice Band, Expert Belt, or Dragon Dance. In addition, depending on whether it's physically or specially defensive, Hippowdon can wall a large portion of the metagame. Its ability, Sand Stream, is extremely desirable, as it forces constant chip damage on almost all Pokemon that are not Rock-, Ground-, or Steel-types. Thanks to Hippowdon's access to an instant recovery move in Slack Off coupled with its bulk, its longevity is near unrivaled. With access to great utility in Stealth Rock and Roar, Hippowdon functions as a fantastic, consistent support option.</p> <p>However, Hippowdon is extremely slow and can be passive even with its STAB-boosted Earthquake, so it's not difficult to offensively pressure it. Water- and Grass-types give Hippowdon an extremely hard time, especially the latter, which resist its Earthquake. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Gyarados and Calm Mind Suicune can put tremendous pressure on Hippowdon, as staying in to phaze them, whether by choice or by necessity, can result in sustaining a ton of damage. Skarmory can use Hippowdon to set up Spikes, which Hippowdon detests. There are very few Pokemon that despise status more than Hippowdon, as poison and burn make it significantly worse at doing its job.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hippowdon can utilize Curse to be a potent defensive setup sweeper alongside Earthquake, Ice Fang, and Slack Off. Crunch can be used to maim Gengar and take it by surprise, as well as perhaps fish for Defense drops on foes like Clefable and Blissey, but its use is quite limited, and it's still risky to stay in versus Gengar and take a Will-O-Wisp. Fire Fang can be used to hit Scizor and Forretress, while Thunder Fang can hit Gyarados, but there are much better checks available for these Pokemon. A more offensive set with Stone Edge can take Zapdos and Gyarados by surprise, but Zapdos can likely survive Stone Edge regardless of how offensive the Hippowdon is. Protect has potential to scout Choice item users and gain health over time, but there isn't usually room to fit this move, and Slack Off is better overall. Superpower can be used to surprise Blissey and Clefable, which can do serious damage with some offensive investment. Hippowdon can create greater than 100 HP Substitutes to set up on Blissey and Clefable, but it usually doesn't gain enough mileage off of Substitute to justify it. Stockpile can make Hippowdon nearly impossible to KO without a critical hit, but sets with this move are so passive that the opponent gets many opportunities to find a critical hit or set up Spikes, Calm Mind, or even Dragon Dance. Yawn can function as a pseudo-phazing move that forces foes out with the threat of sleep, but Roar is generally better.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types like Swampert, Suicune, Starmie, Empoleon, Milotic, and Kingdra can deal devastating damage to any Hippowdon, while Hippowdon doesn't strongly threaten these Pokemon back outside of Earthquake against Empoleon, which it likely won't get an opportunity to use anyway due to Empoleon's powerful Water-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types like Celebi, Breloom, Roserade, and Shaymin can use Hippowdon to set up with the threat of their strong STAB or utility moves. Hippowdon can't deal significant damage to these Pokemon outside of Roserade and Breloom with Ice Fang. In Breloom's case, depending on its bulk, the damage may not even be that significant.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon: Ground-immune Pokemon can often take advantage of Hippowdon's passiveness to set up. Gliscor can use Knock Off or set up Swords Dance without minding Ice Fang that much in many cases. Gengar doesn't take too much from Ice Fang and can fire off Shadow Ball repeatedly, which Hippowdon may have difficulty combating. Gyarados can set up Dragon Dance and fire off a powerful STAB-boosted Waterfall. Dragonite can find its way in and terrorize Hippowdon with Outrage and Draco Meteor depending on how much defensive investment it has. Latias doesn't mind Ice Fang too much and can use Surf to deal significant damage to Hippowdon.</p> <p><strong>Status: Status is especially effective versus Hippowdon, and a large number of Pokemon can take advantage of this to cripple it, often by surprise. Zapdos and Flygon can use Toxic to prevent Hippowdon from walling them. Gengar and Rotom-A can use Will-O-Wisp to put Hippowdon on a timer. Toxic Spikes users like Roserade and Nidoqueen can also force Hippowdon to take poison.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick users: Clefable and Gliscor can use Knock Off to remove Hippowdon's Leftovers, which dampens its ability to defensively answer Tyranitar, Dragonite, Infernape, and especially Jirachi. Trick can accomplish the same feat but can cripple it even further by giving it a Choice item, which makes it near impossible to defensively answer anything reliably.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hippowdon has the most physical bulk of any Pokemon in OU, and this set takes that to its highest potential. With unparalleled Defense, Hippowdon can shrug off attacks from some of the strongest physical attackers in the tier, like Tyranitar, Infernape, Metagross, and Machamp. In addition, it completely shuts down physical variants of Jirachi, taking very little damage even from a fully invested Iron Head. Hippowdon is a great Stealth Rock user, being able to set it up against a large range of Pokemon, like the aforementioned strong physical attackers. Slack Off gives Hippowdon instant recovery that takes its longevity to great heights, enabling it to wall a large portion of the metagame. Earthquake is its strongest STAB move, which is great because Ground-type STAB moves are desirable in the metagame. Roar is a fantastic option because Hippowdon is capable of phazing a large range of Pokemon due to its supreme bulk. Roar can also compensate for Hippowdon's passivity by wearing down foes with chip damage from Stealth Rock and sand, and it can be used in a pinch to stop dangerous setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Gyarados and even Breloom from setting up. As an alternative, Ice Fang gives Hippowdon great coverage alongside Earthquake, hitting important targets like Dragon-types and Gliscor and even doing a decent job at wearing down Gengar as it switches in.</p> <p>If another Pokemon on your team has Stealth Rock, you could opt for both Roar and Ice Fang or even a move like Toxic, which can be extremely useful against foes like opposing Hippowdon, Zapdos, Gyarados, and Milotic. You'll likely find that this is a rare occurrence, however, because even if a Pokemon like Clefable already has Stealth Rock on a defensive team, it can be useful to use Stealth Rock on Hippowdon as well to cover the physical attackers that Clefable cannot set it up on; Clefable in turn can cover the special attackers that prevent Hippowdon from setting Stealth Rock, like Starmie and Empoleon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense are necessary to shut down Tyranitar, Machamp, and Iron Head Jirachi as well as possible. There is definitely potential for some Special Defense EVs, which may improve Hippowdon's durability versus surprise special attacks like Tyranitar's Ice Beam and Jirachi's Grass Knot; however, sacrificing physical bulk will make a significant difference, as in practice Hippowdon will switch into a large range of physical attackers. Also, with maximum physical bulk, Hippowdon can sometimes survive some of the most devastating physical attacks, like +2 Lucario's Close Combat and even Metagross's Explosion.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It can be beneficial to conceal Roar or Ice Fang for as long as possible, as revealing it later can catch a Pokemon like Dragonite, mixed Flygon, or Dragon Dance Gyarados off guard. Many Ground-immune Pokemon can offensively pressure Hippowdon due to its inability to hit them with a strong attack, so keeping it healthy throughout a battle with Slack Off is essential in case of a surprise like a critical hit. Conserve Earthquake PP if possible, as it can be valuable in pressuring Clefable and Jirachi in a matchup against a defensive team. Using Roar aggressively can be very rewarding and compensate for Hippowdon enabling Pokemon to set up on it and even catch aggressive double switches from your opponent. Try to keep Hippowdon unstatused for as long as possible, as a burn from the likes of Gengar and Rotom-A, poison from Toxic Spikes, or Toxic from Zapdos and Bronzong can make Hippowdon significantly less effective.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hippowdon definitely requires some support to function well. Counterplay against Spikes and Toxic Spikes is very appreciated. Bulkier variants of Starmie can take on Swampert and Gyarados and also provide crucial Rapid Spin support. Magnezone is great to trap and remove Skarmory, which is one of the Pokemon that can exploit Hippowdon the most. In addition, Magnezone can paralyze Jirachi, which can dampen its ability to potentially take Hippowdon down through flinches, and also remove Bronzong with a Magnet Rise set. Latias has fantastic type synergy with Hippowdon with its Water and Grass resistances and can bring a lot of support to the table. A Sleep Talk set can absorb sleep from Breloom and Roserade, while bulkier utility sets can provide Thunder Wave, Reflect, and even Toxic support. Wish + Protect Jirachi, with a Careful nature in particular, can spread paralysis with Body Slam and take on annoyances like Gengar and special attacking Water-types. Roserade takes on Water-types like Kingdra, Empoleon, and Suicune, can set up entry hazards, clears Toxic Spikes with its Poison typing, and absorbs status. Clefable has fantastic defensive synergy with Hippowdon; it can absorb any Will-O-Wisp or Toxic that is thrown at Hippowdon, which makes the combination of the two incredibly difficult to break. Hippowdon also takes on physical attackers like Tyranitar, Infernape, and even Dragonite, while Clefable handles special attackers like Starmie, Empoleon, and Roserade. Both Hippowdon and Clefable are weak to Breloom, however, so a Breloom check works very well with these two. Zapdos is a great teammate for Hippowdon in general, as its defensive utility to answer Gyarados and Swampert is valuable. Skarmory also combines very well defensively with Hippowdon, helping to handle dangerous setup sweepers like Gyarados and Dragonite. In addition, it can set up Spikes to support Hippowdon wearing down foes with Roar. Gliscor surprisingly works very well with Hippowdon despite compounding Water- and Ice-type weaknesses. It doubles down on Tyranitar, Lucario, and Flygon while providing great utility in Taunt, Knock Off, and even Ice Fang.</p> "

        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Specially defensive Hippowdon is a behemoth capable of shrugging off some of the most powerful special attacks in the metagame, such as Dragonite's Draco Meteor, Gengar's Shadow Ball, and Infernape's Fire Blast. Stealth Rock fits well on Hippowdon, as it can use its monstrous bulk to set it up against a number of Pokemon, such as Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Infernape. In addition, Hippowdon can use its enhanced Special Defense to wear down bulky Starmie with Earthquake, as an uninvested Surf does not do that much damage. This can be essential in an entry hazard war against a Starmie team. Slack Off enables Hippowdon to maximize its capabilities against Dragonite, Flygon, and Infernape while also maximizing its longevity. Ice Fang is preferred to take advantage of its matchup against mixed Dragon-types while also hitting Gliscor. Roar is a fantastic alternative option; however, it is more risky to use it against a foe like Dragon Dance Gyarados or Dragonite because of this set's lack of investment in Defense.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Hippowdon wants as much Special Defense as possible to take Draco Meteor from the likes of Dragonite, Flygon, and Latias as well as possible. In addition, it can take advantage of maximum investment in bulk to take on Choice Specs Heatran's Overheat from the lead position. There is potential to use a bit of Defense with an Impish nature while still heavily investing in Special Defense to improve Hippowdon's matchup versus Dragon Dance Dragonite; however, it will lose out on a significant amount of special bulk by changing from a Careful to an Impish nature.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Make sure to keep Hippowdon as healthy as possible, especially when facing foes like mixed Flygon, Dragonite, and Gengar. Avoid status from the likes of Will-O-Wisp Gengar, Toxic Zapdos, and even Body Slam Jirachi when trying to answer these Pokemon. If your team cannot clear Toxic Spikes, try to send Hippowdon in before two layers have gone up. Although it detests even regular poison, being badly poisoned means Hippowdon is dead weight a large majority of the time. Keep Ice Fang concealed until the right moment to increase your likelihood of confirming a hit on a key target. Once Ice Fang has been revealed, liberally using it in more slow-paced matchups to fish for a freeze can be a good idea.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Physically defensive Skarmory is a great teammate, as these two walls have fantastic synergy, and Spikes support is helpful to compensate for Hippowdon's passiveness against Pokemon with a resistance or immunity to Ground. Gliscor can help with Choice Band Tyranitar, which can be a bit overwhelming for specially defensive Hippowdon; in return, Hippowdon can use its enhanced Special Defense to take on Ice Beam variants of mixed Tyranitar. Calm Mind Clefable can work wonderfully to patch up stall weaknesses that may be incurred with Hippowdon while also checking Dragon Dance Gyarados. Celebi and Roserade are useful teammates to combat Water-types like Swampert and Empoleon. Roserade's ability to lay down entry hazards and absorb Toxic Spikes also greatly benefits Hippowdon. Magnezone's ability to trap and remove Skarmory is great to prevent too many Spikes from making Hippowdon's job more difficult. Latias, especially with some Defense, can support Hippowdon very well. Alternatively, a Sleep Talk set can help to compensate for Hippowdon's Breloom weakness.</p> "

  "Abomasnow": {
    "overview": "<p>Abomasnow is a unique Pokemon due to its signature ability in Snow Warning allowing it to summon hail upon entry and therefore progressively wear down the wide majority of Pokemon in the metagame, including the omnipresent Steel-types, which can be a huge asset for teams that capitalize on residual damage. Its unique Ice / Grass typing further expands its utility by making it one of the most reliable answers to bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Starmie, Swampert, Milotic, and Empoleon. Furthermore, while Abomasnow's offensive stats are nothing to write home about, it can make up for that thanks to its powerful STAB attack in Wood Hammer, a very useful priority Ice Shard, and a perfectly accurate Blizzard under hail, which can turn it into an offensive threat.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Abomasnow's unimpressive defensive stats and lackluster Speed coupled with its crippling weaknesses to Steel, Fire, Fighting, Rock, and Bug leave it vulnerable to a plethora of metagame staples such as Jirachi, Tyranitar, Heatran, Infernape, and Metagross. The lack of a reliable recovery move and Stealth Rock weakness further cut into Abomasnow's survivability. While hail support can be extremely useful, it is a double-edged sword because it also wears down Abomasnow's teammates over time, since they're unlikely to have Ice typing themselves to fully take advantage of it. As a result, Abomasnow usually needs a considerable amount of support and therefore is difficult to fit onto a team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Seed Bomb is a less powerful but safer alternative to Wood Hammer, but the loss in power is so drastic against Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Clefable that it is not advised. Worry Seed can bother Pokemon that could take advantage of Abomasnow such as Jirachi, Scizor, Bronzong, and especially Clefable by changing their ability. Substitute can be used effectively alongside Leech Seed and hail damage to put the opponent in a very undesirable position, but Abomasnow's poor Speed, bulk, and typing make this strategy very challenging to pull off. Swords Dance can turn Abomasnow into a sweeper, but it is easily revenge killed and walled by a lot of Pokemon and usually requires too much support to be worth the trouble. Choice Scarf makes Abomasnow's Speed less of an issue and allows it to reliably revenge kill Pokemon like Rain Dance Kingdra, but its weakness to Stealth Rock and common priority moves and inability to revenge kill common sweepers such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragonite, and Agility Metagross leave it outclassed as a Choice Scarf user. Abomasnow can use Choice Specs to get a very powerful Blizzard alongside coverage moves such as Energy Ball, Earth Power, and Focus Blast, but its poor Speed, lack of Leftovers, and competition with other special wallbreakers mean that it usually isn't worth the trouble.</p> <p>Other moves such as Light Screen, Grass Whistle, Block, and Icy Wind can have some sort of application, but they usually are too situational or unreliable to justify their use.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: As they resist Abomasnow's STAB attacks and hit it super effectively, Steel-types are naturally solid answers to it. Scizor fears next to nothing from it and can freely use U-turn, inflict severe damage with a Choice Band-boosted Pursuit upon it switching out, or set up Swords Dance against it, only fearing the rare Hidden Power Fire. Forretress can also set up several layers of Spikes against it. Bronzong walls Abomasnow entirely and can set up Trick Room or Stealth Rock in front of it. Metagross and Jirachi threaten to OHKO Abomasnow with Meteor Mash or Fire Punch, but they cannot take Earthquake from offensive Abomasnow well. Skarmory can lay Spikes down against Abomasnow without much issue as long as it is not packing Blizzard, and even then specially defensive variants can heal off the damage and burn its PP. Nonetheless, it should be kept in mind that all of these Pokemon don't appreciate getting their health sapped by hail and Leech Seed, especially the ones that rely on Leftovers to recover.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: As long as they avoid Earthquake on the switch in, Heatran and Infernape threaten Abomasnow with an OHKO. However, a combination of hail and Leech Seed wears them down fairly quickly, and Infernape doesn't like taking Wood Hammer or Blizzard either. While uncommon, Moltres is an interesting check to Abomasnow, as it can avoid Leech Seed with Substitute and stall out Blizzard PP thanks to Pressure or simply force Abomasnow out with Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar: By removing hail upon entering the field, Tyranitar denies Abomasnow's recovery from Leftovers and can proceed to threaten it with Stone Edge, Fire Blast, or Superpower. Tyranitar can also hit Abomasnow very hard with Pursuit if it tries to switch out. Nonetheless, Wood Hammer can net a potential OHKO on most Tyranitar variants, and if it doesn't Tyranitar will still be in range of an Ice Shard follow up.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Lucario can attempt to set up a Swords Dance in front of Abomasnow thanks to its part-Steel typing and proceed to OHKO it with Close Combat, but it should be wary of Earthquake, which can prevent it from doing so. Although it'd rather avoid Ice Shard and needs to stay away from Blizzard, Breloom can put Abomasnow to sleep, hit it hard with Mach Punch before it can retaliate with Ice Shard, or set Substitute. Breloom also doesn't mind hail much due to Poison Heal. Machamp, Heracross, and Gallade can OHKO Abomasnow with their respective STAB attacks, but they take a significant amount from its attacks as well.</p> <p><strong>Clefable and Other Knock Off Users: As Abomasnow doesn't have a reliable recovery move, Leftovers recovery is key to its longevity, and getting hit by Knock Off is therefore very detrimental. Thanks to Magic Guard, Clefable doesn't care about hail and Leech Seed and thus can switch into Abomasnow and deny its attempt to regain health. From there, Clefable can cripple Abomasnow with Encore, Knock Off, or status effects or start to set up with Calm Mind, but it should be wary of a Wood Hammer from maximum Attack Abomasnow, which 2HKOes non physically-defensive variants. Abomasnow also has to worry about Knock Off when trying to switch into Pokemon such as Gliscor, Empoleon, and Tentacruel.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage: While they all have to stay out of Ice Shard range and want to stay away from Blizzard, Heat Wave Zapdos, Gengar, Choice Specs Latias, Stone Edge Gyarados, Hidden Power Fire Shaymin, and Togekiss can all force Abomasnow out with their offensive moves.</p> <p><strong>Status and Entry Hazards: As a Pokemon that relies on passive recovery to regain health, any form of residual damage greatly bothers Abomasnow. Toxic poison prevents it from stalling anything, burn from Will-O-Wisp outdamages Leftovers recovery and hampers its offensive presence, and entry hazards, mainly Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, make it difficult to bring Abomasnow onto the field safely.</p> ",

        "name": "Leech Seed",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This variant of Abomasnow aims to offer as much utility as it can get into a single set. Leech Seed is Abomasnow's main recovery move and provides passive damage in addition to hail, a combination that wears down the opposing Pokemon at a significant rate. The recovery granted by Leech Seed also aids Abomasnow's teammates if it is forced out by a powerful Pokemon such as Infernape. Abomasnow is also a good user of this move because its secondary Ice typing can discourage opposing Grass-types from trying to absorb Leech Seed. Protect pairs nicely with Leech Seed, as it allows Abomasnow to gain additional recovery for free while the opposing Pokemon is slowly losing its health. It also scouts which move a Choice item user will lock into, which is especially useful against strong super effective attackers like Choice Band Tyranitar and Scizor, and can also be a nice tool against Gyarados lacking Stone Edge and Taunt, as it ensures that Abomasnow can't be hit by Bounce.</p> <p>Wood Hammer is the strongest Grass-type STAB attack available to hit Water-types that Abomasnow is supposed to counter. It also threatens Tyranitar with a potential OHKO and 2HKOes max HP Clefable, which could be tempted to switch in and deny Abomasnow's Leech Seed. Ice Shard OHKOes Flygon and non-Yache Berry Dragonite after Stealth Rock damage and a round of hail while dealing substantial damage to Pokemon such as Gliscor, Roserade, and Latias and threatening to revenge kill severely weakened Pokemon. Blizzard is an option to punish defensive variants of Zapdos, Skarmory, Togekiss, and Hidden Power Fire Celebi in case they're trying to fight Abomasnow while being a significantly stronger move overall.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The recovery provided by Leftovers is invaluable for Abomasnow's survivability. 252 EVs in Attack and an Adamant nature are needed to get the aforementioned KOs with Wood Hammer and Ice Shard. The remaining EVs are placed into HP and Special Defense to retain sufficient bulk to handle most Water-types. Investing in Speed can be considered to get the jump on uninvested Swampert, Clefable, and Tyranitar. 16 EVs in Speed is usually the minimum if outspeeding those Pokemon is desired, but more EVs can be spent to outspeed Skarmory and Pokemon that sit around the base 70 Speed tier, mainly Tyranitar. Alternatively, if Blizzard is chosen over Ice Shard, Abomasnow can use a more bulky spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD and a Sassy nature to get as much special bulk as possible, which allows Abomasnow to check Rain Dance Kingdra, Choice Scarf Latias, and offensive variants of Rotom-A more effectively.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bring Abomasnow in on foes it is suited to handle, mainly Water-types such as Starmie, Swampert, Suicune, Empoleon, and Milotic. Abomasnow can also take care of Raikou lacking Aura Sphere, Zapdos without Heat Wave or Hidden Power Flying, and most variants of Gliscor. From there, it can spread Leech Seed and get chip damage on the opposing Pokemon, which, in tandem with hail and Protect, can quickly wear down Steel-types, which are tempted to come in on Abomasnow. Depending on the opposing team, sending Abomasnow out as soon as possible to set up hail early can be a good idea, especially if the opponent hasn't set up Stealth Rock yet and cannot change the weather. The ability to induce hail upon entry can be critical against Pokemon such as Kingdra in an emergency situation. If Abomasnow packs Ice Shard, it can be used as a revenge killer to weakened Pokemon and make sure that Flygon and non-Yache Berry Dragonite locked into Outrage won't cause any more trouble.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Abomasnow has a much easier time coming onto a field cleared of Stealth Rock and any other form of entry hazards. Therefore, Starmie makes for a great teammate due to its access to Rapid Spin and ability to keep Infernape, Heatran, and some Jirachi variants in check. Tentacruel is another notable spinner that pairs nicely with Abomasnow, as it is also able to deal with Fire-types, can set up and absorb Toxic Spikes, and can make use of Knock Off to remove the opposing Pokemon's Leftovers, which, if combined with hail and Leech Seed damage, wears down opposing Pokemon at an extremely fast rate. Nidoqueen is a good partner as well to absorb and set Toxic Spikes while serving as a check to Tyranitar and Fighting-types like Lucario and Infernape. Gliscor also does a good job at handling these threats and benefits from hail damage, as the residual damage enhances its stallbreaking capabilities. Defensive Jirachi is another noteworthy stallbreaker that appreciates hail support when trying to wear down the opposing team with Iron Head, as even opposing Steel-types such as Bronzong have trouble dealing with it if their Leftovers recovery is denied by hail. It also handles dangerous Pokemon such as Gengar and Latias and can support Abomasnow with Wish. Unlike most Pokemon, Clefable isn't bothered by hail at all due to its ability Magic Guard and can make good use of Knock Off, heal its teammates with Wish, and serve as an answer to Pokemon such as Heatran, Zapdos, and Latias that could force Abomasnow out. Skarmory brings another form of passive damage in Spikes and can check a large number of physical threats, namely Metagross, Scizor, and Gyarados. Since Abomasnow is unable to discourage opposing Skarmory from setting Spikes freely without Blizzard, Magnezone can be considered to circumvent this issue and to deal with other troublesome Steel-types such as Scizor and Jirachi.</p> <p>Other good defensive teammates for Abomasnow include Latias, which serves as a competent answer to Infernape, Breloom, Heatran, and Zapdos while passing Wish. Rotom-A is also a valuable teammate due to its reliability at spinblocking and checking Steel-types such as Metagross, Scizor, physical Jirachi, and Bronzong. Zapdos also deals nicely with the aforementioned Steel-types and Fighting-types like Breloom. Finally, a dedicated hail team featuring Walrein is doable, although stacking Ice-types that share several weakness, mainly to Stealth Rock, comes with synergy issues.</p> "

        "name": "All-out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Abomasnow's dual STAB coverage is fit to break through common bulky Pokemon such as Swampert, Gliscor, Milotic, Hippowdon, and Celebi, allowing it to act as an efficient wallbreaker that still retains some defensive utility. Wood Hammer pressures bulky Water-types, OHKOes most Tyranitar variants, and 2HKOes maximum HP Clefable and Bold Blissey after Stealth Rock. Blizzard is perfectly accurate under hail, OHKOes Breloom, and heavily cripples the likes of Skarmory, Zapdos, Rotom-A, Gengar, and Celebi. Ice Shard is a very useful priority move, as it allows Abomasnow to finish off Flygon and Dragonite once they have been weakened a bit and does substantial damage to Gliscor, Roserade, Latias, and offensive Zapdos. Earthquake hurts Steel-types such as Heatran, Jirachi, and Metagross as well as Infernape, which resist Abomasnow's STAB moves. Focus Punch can be used if Clefable and Blissey prove to be real issues, seeing that it spares Abomasnow from taking too much recoil from Wood Hammer when they repeatedly use recovery moves, and it is especially useful against Bold Calm Mind Clefable. It also hits Tyranitar and Heatran extremely hard and does a good amount of damage to Bronzong, Scizor, and Skarmory as it heals with Roost. Its unreliable nature and reliance on prediction should be kept in mind, however. Hidden Power Fire can be considered, as it invalidates Scizor and Forretress as counters and damages Bronzong.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers is recommended because Abomasnow can hardly afford to hamper its longevity with Life Orb and highly benefits from the passive recovery when switching into Ground- and Water-types. Leftovers also alleviates the recoil induced by Wood Hammer. Maximum Attack enables Abomasnow to net an important OHKO with Ice Shard on Flygon and Dragonite after Stealth Rock damage and a round of hail, a 2HKO on Clefable, and an OHKO on most Tyranitar with Wood Hammer. The EVs in Speed allow Abomasnow to outspeed Skarmory without investment. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack to enhance Blizzard's damage, 2HKOing maximum HP Rotom-A after Stealth Rock and hail damage. Putting only 16 EVs in Speed is enough to get the edge over uninvested Tyranitar, Swampert, and Clefable. This can also be achieved with 76 Spe and a Brave nature if lowering Defense is deemed to be too bothersome, seeing that Abomasnow wants to take advantage of the likes of Swampert, Gliscor, and Hippowdon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Without investment in defensive stats and Leech Seed, Abomasnow cannot take too many hits and should mostly be switching into defensively oriented Pokemon such as bulky variants of Starmie, Swampert, Hippowdon, non-Flamethrower Nidoqueen, Hippowdon, and Milotic. Bringing Abomasnow out early-game to induce hail can be rewarding, especially if Stealth Rock isn't up. Offensive Abomasnow can be difficult to switch into for some teams due to its powerful STAB attacks and coverage. However, be wary of using Wood Hammer too many times, as the recoil can significantly wear Abomasnow down if it's used too recklessly against Pokemon such as Blissey. Since Abomasnow is slow and suffers from a plethora of exploitable weaknesses, its success can be reliant on prediction; it will likely have to catch Steel- and Fire-type switch-ins with Earthquake to get past them, for instance. Abomasnow can also prevent attempts to sweep from Pokemon such as non-Yache Berry and non-Extreme Speed Dragon Dance Dragonite and Rain Dance Kingdra thanks to Ice Shard and hail. In a similar manner, Abomasnow can also serve as an offensive check to Water-types like offensive Calm Mind Suicune, Agility Empoleon, and Starmie thanks to its typing.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Abomasnow struggles to get past Steel-types such as Scizor, bulky Jirachi, Bronzong, Forretress, and, to a lesser extent, specially defensive Skarmory. Therefore, Heatran is a partner of choice, as it can keep them in check and can set up Stealth Rock to enhance Abomasnow's wallbreaking capabilities. Choice Scarf variants in particular are effective at revenge killing Lucario and appreciate Abomasnow's Ice Shard to handle Dragon Dance Dragonite. In return, Abomasnow can take on Water-types that cause Heatran trouble. Starmie is a very valuable partner as the most reliable spinner available and can help Abomasnow by getting rid of entry hazards and keeping Fire- and some Steel-type Pokemon in check. Tentacruel is another spinner to consider because it can absorb and set Toxic Spikes while keeping Fire-types in check. Skarmory is another Pokemon suited to take advantage of the aforementioned Steel-types by using them as Spikes fodder. It is also a very solid defensive teammate for Abomasnow due to its ability to check the likes of Metagross and Gyarados. On a more offensive team, Bronzong can help Abomasnow by setting up Trick Room to enhance the matchup against fast-paced teams.</p> <p>Offensive Abomasnow cannot take hits from the offensive Water-types such as Starmie, Suicune, and Empoleon forever. Therefore, specially defensive Pokemon such as Clefable and Jirachi make good partners, especially since they have an easier time crippling the opposing team with hail active. They also bring Wish support that Abomasnow appreciates. Nidoqueen and Gliscor can support Abomasnow by laying down entry hazards and stallbreaking, respectively, while keeping dangerous Pokemon such as Tyranitar and most Fighting-types in check. Due to Abomasnow's Speed and huge number of exploitable weaknesses, Pokemon that have good type synergy with it such as Latias, Zapdos, and Rotom-A are ideal teammates.</p> "

  "Weavile": {
    "overview": "<p>Weavile certainly isn't winning any awards defensively, as not only is he stripped of 25% of his health every time he switches into Stealth Rock, but he also has poor defensive stats and weaknesses to common attacking types, namely Rock, Fire, Steel, and Fighting. He can also be easily walled, so outside of the late-game, his sweeping potential is limited. On the other hand, Weavile's combination of Speed, Attack, and useful STAB moves can be a great asset to many teams. Is Starmie causing you trouble? Pursuit it to death. Is Choice Scarf Flygon irritating with its high Speed? Not with Weavile's Ice Shard in the wings. While Weavile faces stiff competition for STAB Dark-type attacks from Tyranitar, Weavile has significantly higher Speed and access to Ice Shard which can sometimes give him the edge depending on what your team needs. Overall, Weavile can be extremely threatening with proper team support, and as such, he is a physical attacker who should not be underestimated.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Punishment is useful for taking out Calm Mind users such as Jirachi, as it will do more damage than Night Slash after a few boosts. Assurance can also be used if you have Stealth Rock support, but Night Slash is generally the better choice due to its greater Base Power, high critical hit rate, and general reliability. Stay away from using special attacks, because although Weavile gets Nasty Plot, he will never be doing much damage with his terrible Special Attack stat. Focus Punch and Substitute can be used if you want Weavile to pack a more powerful Fighting-type move, although Life Orb and Substitute, as well as entry hazards, will deteriorate Weavile's health quickly. Reflect can be used, but it has little utility on such a defensively challenged Pokemon.</p> <p>Always use a Speed-boosting nature to take advantage of Weavile's great Speed stat. Maximizing Speed isn't needed, so just aim for 373 Speed (216 EVs) to outrun Base 120 Speed Pokemon such as Alakazam, and put the remaining EVs in HP. Max Attack is a given, because Weavile needs all the power he can get. On the lead set, you needn't put any EVs into HP, because the aim is to activate Focus Sash quickly so that Weavile can then use Counter to OHKO the opposing lead.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Steel-types are particularly troublesome for Weavile. Scizor is easily Weavile's greatest enemy; he can KO Weavile with either Bullet Punch or U-turn while taking minimal damage from any of Weavile's attacks. Similarly, Metagross does a fine job beating Weavile with either Meteor Mash or Bullet Punch, although he must be wary of switching into a Choice Band Night Slash. Jirachi is a good option as he is able to withstand any attack Weavile uses and respond with Iron Head. Bronzong is also a good counter to Weavile as Weavile will have a hard time breaking through his high defenses. He can use his defensive ability to set up Stealth Rock and then subsequently KO Weavile with Gyro Ball. Skarmory can come in on Weavile to set up Spikes and then Roost off any damage Weavile inflicts, or can opt to KO Weavile with Brave Bird. Forretress can also switch into Weavile with impunity and proceed to either set up hazards or KO with Gyro Ball.</p> <p>Pokemon with a high amount of bulk are also a challenge for Weavile, as with Weavile's pitiful defenses, almost any attack will put him in a dire situation. Gyarados is a good example, as with Intimidate he is able to take any attack Weavile throws at him and KO Weavile with Waterfall. Swampert can switch into Weavile and KO him with Earthquake, with Weavile failing to do any meaningful damage. Suicune and Vaporeon can do much of the same, being able to KO Weavile with Surf before Weavile can KO them.</p> <p>Machamp is an excellent counter to Weavile, as Weavile isn't able to do nearly enough damage to KO him before he responds with a super-effective Dynamic Punch. Faster Pokemon are also major threats to Weavile. Choice Scarf Heatran and Lucario can switch into everything barring Low Kick and then proceed to outspeed and KO Weavile with their respective STABs. Jolteon outruns Weavile and can proceed to deal heavy damage with Thunderbolt. Infernape and Hitmontop can switch into any of Weavile's moves and KO him with priority Mach Punch.</p> ",

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<p>At first glance, this Weavile seems to be a generic physical attacker, but he functions as insurance against many of the metagame's top threats. This is mostly thanks to Weavile's STAB Pursuit, which allows him to outspeed and KO threats such as Gengar. Starmie is also OHKOed by Pursuit on the switch, letting your Gyarados or Infernape sweep with their check eliminated.</p> <p>Weavile's STAB Ice-type attacks allow him to easily OHKO any Dragon-type Pokemon in OU bar Kingdra. Ice Shard is used on this set as it handles both Choice Scarf Flygon and Dragon Dance Dragonite regardless of their Speed. Low Kick OHKOes Tyranitar, whom Weavile can outspeed even after a Dragon Dance, and hits Steel- and Normal-types for super effective damage as well. Ice Punch can be used in the last slot as a means of hitting Flying- and Grass-types harder, while Night Slash can be used for stronger Dark STAB. Choice Band is the main item choice for extra power, but Life Orb is a viable option if you wish to retain decent power and still have the freedom to switch attacks.</p> <p>Gyarados and Scizor can be serious threats to this set, especially bulky variants. None of Weavile's attacks do significant damage to either, and both can do serious damage with Stone Edge and Bullet Punch respectively. Both Scizor and Gyarados fear Rotom-H as he can take most of Scizor's attacks and OHKO back with Overheat, while also OHKOing Gyarados with Thunderbolt. Choice Scarf Magnezone is a fantastic Scizor counter, as he can come in on a 4x resisted Bullet Punch and OHKO Scizor with Hidden Power Fire. Magnezone can also take care of other Steel-types who wall Weavile, such as Skarmory and Forretress. Celebi and Vaporeon are also good Gyarados counters; nothing Gyarados commonly uses can touch Celebi or Vaporeon (with the exception of Bounce in Celebi's case) and they can KO it in turn with Grass Knot or Hidden Power Electric respectively.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Weavile's combination of Speed and power makes him an excellent candidate for a late-game sweeper when his counters are weakened or gone altogether. With Swords Dance to boost his already impressive Attack, very few Pokemon can switch in on his boosted Night Slash, and your opponent will usually have to resort to a priority move or a Choice Scarf user to take down Weavile without taking significant damage themselves.</p> <p>Night Slash is a great STAB move that hits most types neutrally, and Low Kick lets Weavile handle Steel-types and Tyranitar. Ice Shard is generally a better option than Ice Punch because it OHKOes the same Pokemon, such as Flygon, who you would be hitting with Ice Punch, but allows Weavile to always strike first. It is also helpful against faster Pokemon, particularly Jolteon, who is always OHKOed by a +2 Ice Shard after taking Stealth Rock damage. Still, Ice Punch is an option if you want a more powerful attack to use, especially against bulky Ground-types, namely Hippowdon.</p> <p>The item choice is somewhat difficult, and largely depends on personal preference. Life Orb is a great option if you can predict a switch-in well, but given the popularity of Stealth Rock and Weavile's general frailty, it's not always the best choice. Expert Belt gives your attacks a little extra kick and can help Weavile bluff a Choice item, but it's usually not needed because anyone hit with a Swords Dance-boosted super effective attack is going to faint anyway. Lum Berry is another option, as it will let Weavile set up against the likes of Blissey, who would otherwise use Thunder Wave to stop Weavile's sweep.</p> <p>The greatest issue for this set is Scizor due to his ability to revenge kill Weavile with Bullet Punch. Scizor can easily be taken care of by a Substitute Heatran, who can take Scizor's Bullet Punch, scare it out at the prospect of a STAB Fire Blast, and set up a Substitute to wreak havoc on the opposing team. However, Heatran fears Superpower from Scizor, so this makes Gyarados and Rotom-A excellent choices to threaten him as well. Rotom-A in particular can use Will-O-Wisp to cripple Scizor, while Gyarados can set up a Dragon Dance on Scizor's Choice-locked Bullet Punch and proceed to sweep the opposing team.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Rhyperior's biggest problem is the competition it faces for a team slot. Although it possesses greater defensive stats than any of its fellow Ground-types, its lack of instant recovery is a letdown, something Gliscor and Hippowdon both have access to. Swampert's offensive and defensive stats seem poor compared to Rhyperior, but the mudfish has superior defensive typing and can use special attacks effectively. When considering Rhyperior for a slot as an offensive Pokemon, its low Speed means it requires support to effectively use Swords Dance to sweep with. Metagross provides stiff competition for the Rock Polish variants because it is able to reach much higher speeds and employ Explosion if necessary to get a team member in for free. However, this does not take away from the fact that Rhyperior is a very powerful Pokemon. 434 HP and 394 Defense are very hard to break when paired with Solid Rock and the potential for a free Special Defense buff from a sandstorm. Rhyperior is not to be underestimated and is a good choice on most teams if you can play to its strengths.</p> <p>In short, using Rhyperior is akin to making a pact with the devil: you gain incredible amounts of physical power. This can let you 2HKO anything in the metagame with a Choice Band, and the potential to boost your offensive prowess further with Swords Dance or Rock Polish is tempting. However, you should be ready to pay the price in accruing a painful weakness to the ever-so-common Scizor, Gyarados, and Starmie. Rhyperior is not the kind of Pokemon you can simply throw on a team and expect to succeed. It needs a good deal of support to truly shine.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rock Blast can be used to break Substitutes and destroys any Ninjask that dare to try and set up on Rhyperior. Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge if the low PP and accuracy concern you, although the flinch rate is of no real consequence on anything but the Rock Polish set. Focus Punch isn't generally much use due to a STAB Earthquake or Stone Edge having the same power and Fire Punch being just as powerful against Bronzong. Toxic works decently on the more defensive sets if bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon prove to be a large problem. Counter can be used to launch back things such as Flygon's Earthquake and unboosted Gyarados' Waterfall. Endeavor can work on the Rock Polish set if you are low on health. The only thing to say about Rhyperior's signature attack, Rock Wrecker, is that it shouldn't be used.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Barring boosted Megahorns and Focus Punches, Bronzong can shake off pretty much anything Rhyperior can throw its way and hit back with Grass Knot. Skarmory can't hurt Rhyperior, but can stall Rhyperior out--especially the Choice Band set--provided it is faster by wasting Stone Edge's PP with Roost and simply Whirlwinding Rhyperior away.</p> <p>Swampert handles Rhyperior decently and can bring him down with STAB Water attacks. Surf and Hydro Pump are more effective than Waterfall because they hit the weaker of Rhyperior's defensive stats. Suicune also fares well if it can avoid a critical hit from Stone Edge. Hippowdon can wear Rhyperior down by alternating between Earthquake and Slack Off. Beware of Choice Banded or Swords Danced Avalanches or Aqua Tails though.</p> <p>If you can get them in on either of Rhyperior's STAB moves, Breloom and Torterra handle Rhyperior well. Both can fire off Seed Bomb, while the latter can also use the more powerful Wood Hammer. Flygon can also work somewhat, although like the previously mentioned Grass-types, be sure to avoid Ice attacks and repeated hits from Megahorn. Defensive Celebi also works well as a counter; however, it must avoid a predicted Megahorn. STAB Grass Knot, with 120 Base Power due to Rhyperior's girth, will OHKO the rocky beast as long as Rhyperior does not invest heavily in Special Defense and a sandstorm is not raging.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Rhyperior has one of the highest Attack stats in the game combined with two extremely useful STABs. Not many things will enjoy taking an Earthquake or Stone Edge from 624 Attack. The attacking combination of Ground and Rock is only resisted by a handful of Pokemon in OU, including Bronzong, Breloom, and Flygon. The remaining two slots are used to deal with these Pokemon. Aqua Tail deals a minimum of 59% damage to 252 HP / 252 Def Impish Hippowdon, a guaranteed 2HKO even when factoring in Leftovers recovery. Megahorn is Rhyperior's best option against enemy Celebi, easily OHKOing even the most defensive variants. Fire Punch allows Rhyperior to net a guaranteed 2HKO against 252 HP / 80 Def Sassy Bronzong.</p> <p>Maximum Attack EVs are a given on a Pokemon with such an astoundingly high Attack stat. 252 Spe EVs allow Rhyperior to reach a stat of 177, just outspeeding Skarmory that sit at a stat of 176. Rhyperior is now able to 2HKO Skarmory with a Stone Edge before it has the chance to shed its Flying-type with Roost. As an alternative, Rhyperior can run 192 HP / 100 Atk / 156 SpD / 60 Spe in order to always survive 236 SpA Grass Knot from Celebi and 405 Attack Meteor Mash from Metagross. It is recommended that you run both Megahorn and Fire Punch when using this defensive spread.</p> <p>When employing this set, it is integral that you possess a response to Dragon Dance variants of Gyarados and Dragonite, as both will enjoy setting up on Megahorn and Earthquake. A Choice Scarfed Gengar is an excellent option for this role, and it is also immune to the Ground- and Fighting-type attacks aimed at Rhyperior. Therefore, it can also deal with Flygon if it comes in on an Earthquake or a U-turn. If using a Gengar, you should have a plan to deal with Scizor. A Lucario can set up on a Pursuit aimed at Gengar and take advantage of Rhyperior's ability to pound through Hippowdon with Aqua Tail. A Gyarados or Zapdos can handle anything that Scizor possesses, but should watch out for repeated U-turns. Rotom-A also handles Gyarados, as well as Scizor.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Swampert and Suicune will give you problems, taking your attacks and striking back with a Surf to OHKO unless you use a defensive EV spread (though Swampert cannot OHKO with Waterfall regardless). A good option to deal with this is an offensively oriented Celebi, such as a Tinkerbell or Swords Dance set. Breloom is another solid option, but you should watch for Ice Beams, as Breloom lacks the Special Defense that Celebi possesses.</p> <p>Celebi itself gives you trouble if it comes in on anything but a predicted Megahorn or a Stone Edge with prior damage. Tyranitar is a good option to deal with Celebi, and it also sets up the sandstorm that Rhyperior thrives in. Bronzong is annoying, but isn't doing much to you with Gyro Ball, and it dislikes taking Megahorns or boosted Stone Edges. Breloom is another potent threat to Rhyperior, but Gyarados handles it fairly easily provided you have something to take the sleep.</p> <p>Choice Band Scizor, Choice Scarf Jirachi, and Starmie are also potent threats that can force out this set. Magnezone support is an option for dealing with the first two. Fortunately, Tyranitar easily revenge kills Starmie, so it is not a concern.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Rock Polish solves the problem of Rhyperior's abysmal Speed. With max Attack and Life Orb, Rhyperior will be firing off attacks with an Attack stat of roughly 492. Earthquake and Stone Edge give the set the basis of its coverage, while the fourth moveslot is used to cover specific threats. Aqua Tail seriously dents Claydol and Hippowdon while Megahorn quickly disposes of Celebi. Substitute can be used in tandem with Rock Polish in order to protect Rhyperior from status and aid in getting a boost off successfully. On this set, Fire Punch lacks the raw power to successfully deal with Bronzong, so Fire Punch is not used.</p> <p>With a Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs, Rhyperior reaches a Speed stat of 196. Therefore, Rhyperior's Speed stat is 392 after a single Rock Polish. An Adamant nature can be used, but Rhyperior will outspeed Gengar at most, losing to Starmie, an opponent that is relatively vital to outspeed.</p> <p>This set can handle Celebi and (barring a miss on Stone Edge) Dragonite, but still dislikes dealing with Swampert, Suicune, Gyarados, Flygon, and Breloom. Therefore, the recommended partners of this set generally mirror the partners of the previous set. One concern, however, is that unlike the Choice Bander, this set doesn't have the raw power necessary to defeat Hippowdon and Skarmory. Therefore, it is a good practice to employ a sweeper or a lure capable of breaking through a stall team. A Choice Specs Lucario can lure in such physical walls and overwhelm them on the special side. A Gyarados is another potent threat to a stall team, though Rotom-A is a concern. A Tyranitar also works well here, setting up a sandstorm and either luring in Hippowdon and Skarmory and defeating them on the special side or blasting through them with Choice Banded Aqua Tails and Stone Edges.</p> "

        "description": "<p>A Pokemon such as Rhyperior is an excellent candidate for Swords Dance. Being aided by its somewhat impressive defensive capabilities, its massive Attack stat, and very powerful STAB attacks make Rhyperior perfect for this type of set, if it wasn't for his Speed. Thankfully max Speed is adequate to outpace most Skarmory, so using Stone Edge will be of little concern for Rhyperior. Speaking of Stone Edge, following a Swords Dance it OHKOes Gliscor if Rhyperior is using an Adamant nature; a true feat for this set. Earthquake deals massive damage even to Hippowdon, doing roughly 85% damage on average. Megahorn is an excellent choice because it 2HKOes Bronzong. Fire Punch is capable of beating down Bronzong; however, that will be the only time it will be useful.</p> <p>This set works best with Pokemon who can Baton Pass Speed to it or when surrounded by paralysis support. Zapdos is one of the best Agility Passing Pokemon to combine with Rhyperior, as the only real problem is Ice attacks, and quite a few of them are physical anyway. This set also functions equally well under Trick Room conditions by reversing Speed and allowing Rhyperior to attack first the majority of the time. If Rhyperior opts to use Fire Punch, it can lower its Speed to 164 EVs, just outspeeding Swampert. The remaining EVs can be invested in HP.</p> <p>This set can deal with Dragonite, Flygon, Hippowdon, Swampert, and Skarmory, but it cannot defeat any of the other nemeses of the prior sets. As such, you should employ similar partners as for the previous sets. However, paralysis and sandstorm support are a necessity for this set because it remains abysmally slow and it needs to remain on the field in order to sweep. Using Tyranitar is a given, as Hippowdon doesn't have enough of an offensive presence. A good option for paralysis support is Celebi, who can also counter Gyarados. Jirachi is another good option for this role, as the Wish support can help Rhyperior set up. However, this will further your weakness to Earthquake. Scizor is useful here for the purpose of dispatching Celebi, who ordinarily gives this set a fair bit of trouble, but some Celebi employ Hidden Power Fire to deal with this threat.</p> "

Substitute is the key move on this set. With the given EVs, Blissey is not able to break Rhyperior's 101 Substitutes with Seismic Toss. Cresselia also suffers this same scenario, provided she didn't get a Special Attack boost from Charge Beam or has Psychic in her move pool to obtain a Special Defense drop. After the Substitute is set up, Rhyperior can act accordingly by either boosting its 400 Attack stat to an impressive 800 with Swords Dance or simply using its powerful STABs to attack.</p> <p>The Speed EVs outpace minimum Speed neutral-natured Swampert. Don't worry about being walled by Bronzong because Gyro Ball is doing pitiful damage and after a couple of Swords Dances even Bronzong won't enjoy a boosted Stone Edge. If Celebi and other bulky Psychic-types become a problem, Megahorn fits nicely over Swords Dance.</p> <p>Sand Stream support is an absolute requirement for this set as well, as Rhyperior needs it to turn 2HKOs from Heatran's Earth Power and Zapdos' Hidden Power Ice into 3HKOs and also to stop Blissey and Cresselia from breaking the Substitute with a super effective attack. But due to the more defensive approach of this set, Hippowdon is a good option for providing it, as well as Tyranitar. If you are using Megahorn, you don't need to worry about Celebi. If you are using Swords Dance, Swampert is not a concern, as it is outsped and OHKOed by Earthquake after a Swords Dance.</p> <p>Choose your partners accordingly, noting that it is not optimal to choose offensive options such as Gengar if you decide to use Hippowdon for weather support. This is because Gengar is a highly offensive choice, and it works better when your team can apply offensive pressure to the opponent. Tyranitar excels at this with its powerful physical and special attacking stats (as well as its ability to lure in Scizor). Hippowdon applies little offensive pressure with its comparatively weaker Attack, non-existent Special Attack, and shallow movepool.</p> <p>Paralysis is a bonus for this set, and Celebi and Jirachi work well at spreading it around. You will need Swords Dance to have a chance at beating opposing Skarmory and Hippowdon. If you don't use it, then you will need to employ sweepers capable of breaking through a common stall team, such as Lucario and Tyranitar. Dragonite is another option, but it despises Sand Stream.</p> "

Megahorn provides coverage against Grass-types and makes a big dent in Cresselia and Celebi, while Avalanche hits Gliscor hard and can also bring down a Dragon Dancing Dragonite, if you don't want to rely on Stone Edge's shaky accuracy. Stealth Rock is always useful due to its ability to shave off a portion of any opponent's HP. Roar helps phaze Dragon Dancing Dragonite and other possible threats.</p> <p>With 244 HP and 80 SpD EVs in a sandstorm, Timid Heatran's Earth Power will never 2HKO Rhyperior.

The remaining EVs are placed into Defense.</p> <p>This set does little to bulky special attackers such as Suicune and Vaporeon, who directly threaten it. A Kingdra laughs at most attacks that these Pokemon possess, and can set up Dragon Dances on them. A Dragonite or Gyarados can do the same, but they can be struck down by Ice Beam or Hidden Power Electric, respectively. Other than that, Tyranitar is an excellent partner to this set to help deal with Celebi.</p> <p>Without the power of a Choice Band or a Life Orb boosting your Attack, you deal little damage to Bronzong, who laughs at your attacks. Rotom-A can deal with Bronzong and Gyarados. Alternatively, Heatran and Infernape can defeat Bronzong, though you are increasing your weakness to Ground-type attacks by using them in conjunction with Rhyperior.

With Tinted Lens, Yanmega is capable of 2HKOing even dedicated walls who resist his STAB attacks, an impressive feat. Meanwhile, if he instead chooses to use Speed Boost, he will outspeed the entire metagame, including Choice Scarf users, after a turn or two.</p> <p>It's hard to imagine Yanmega being anything other than top-tier OU after considering his strengths, yet the fact remains that he's not. Yanmega suffers from an utterly crippling 4x weakness to Stealth Rock that has completely nullified his presence as a standard of the metagame. Weaknesses to common Fire-, Ice-, and Electric-type attacks aren't helping Yanmega's position either. These weaknesses, coupled with Yanmega's not-so-stellar defenses, have sealed the dragonfly's fate and unfortunately banished him to the bottom of OU.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The listed sets already take advantage of Yanmega's most prominent movepool features, but there exist a few more that can be of use. Hidden Power Ice allows the LeadMega set to OHKO Lead Dragonite and can allow the Specs Tinted Lens set to OHKO Flygon switch-ins, but leaves both vulnerable to Heatran. Shadow Ball on the Specs Tinted Lens set will OHKO defensive Rotom-A, but Bug Buzz would do that after Stealth Rock damage anyway. As noted in the LeadMega analysis, Hypnosis can be run to deal with some otherwise troublesome Pokemon, though its accuracy is a letdown.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Outside of Blissey, absolutely nobody perfectly walls Specs Tinted Lens Yanmega. Skarmory and Heatran can come in on a predicted Bug Buzz and force him out to take more deadly Stealth Rock damage, but must be wary of a 2HKO from Air Slash. Snorlax is a good response with his monstrous special bulk, though Bug Buzz will still 3HKO him, an issue made worse by Snorlax's lack of reliable recovery. Anyone faster or with strong priority who can get in on an attack and survive will force Yanmega out. Scizor's Bullet Punch, Lucario's Extreme Speed, and Choice Scarf Heatran's Fire Blast immediately come to mind as suitable options for the job.</p> <p>The biggest counter to Yanmega, however, is not any one Pokemon, but rather a battle condition. Stealth Rock completely ruins him, and with its prevalence in the metagame, just maintaining it is enough to keep Yanmega at bay.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Yanmega's unique attributes allow him to function as an excellent anti-lead in the OU metagame. After a single Speed Boost, Yanmega will outspeed every single non-Choice Scarf lead bar Ninjask and hit them all for serious damage. Yanmega can also function excellently as a late-game sweeper if the need arises and he survives his early-game encounter.</p> <p>Protect gives Yanmega the edge against Fake Out or attacks from faster leads, particularly from Infernape and Starmie, who both outspeed him before Speed Boost kicks in. As Protect also guarantees that Speed Boost will activate once and maintains Yanmega's Focus Sash, it enables Yanmega to subsequently beat both Starmie and Infernape. Bug Buzz and Air Slash are Yanmega's STAB attacks, and when used together, provide reasonable coverage against most common leads, only missing at least neutral damage against Heatran, Aerodactyl, and Skarmory. It is for this reason that Hidden Power Ground and Hidden Power Fire are the choices for the fourth slot. Hidden Power Ground is useful for 2HKOing standard Shuca Berry Heatran leads and for a greater likelihood of beating Metagross leads, given the presence of Occa Berry. Hidden Power Fire, however, allows Yanmega to defeat Skarmory, Forretress, and Abomasnow leads at the cost of being walled by Heatran. Hidden Power Fire also serves as a weapon with which to combat Scizor later in the match, who can only 2HKO with Bullet Punch. Hypnosis can be used in the fourth slot over Hidden Power for a better chance at beating Tyranitar who lack Lum Berry and Swampert, but it is terribly unreliable and generally not worth sacrificing the ability to beat other leads reliably.</p> <p>This Yanmega can also be relatively successful outside of the lead position as a late-game sweeper with Speed Boost. With a Life Orb equipped, Yanmega will handily dish out OHKOs and 2HKOs against Pokemon weak to and neutral to his STABs, respectively. In this case, maximizing Speed EVs is necessary to outspeed a Dragon Dance-boosted Jolly Gyarados after a single Speed Boost. The primary issue with using this Yanmega as a sweeper is that he is 4x weak to Stealth Rock and is easily walled by the likes of Skarmory, Blissey, and Zapdos. Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock damage coupled with the inability to break through defensive Pokemon make Yanmega dead weight without perfect support.</p> <p>The EV spread is fairly simple, but has a few quirks that might not be obvious at first glance. 252 Special Attack EVs are obviously chosen to maximize Yanmega's offensive power. The 104 Defense EVs are necessary to soften the blows of physical leads, but particularly serve to prevent Metagross leads from 2HKOing you with a combination of Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch; this gives you a fighting chance at 2HKOing them back with Bug Buzz. The 152 remaining EVs are placed into Speed to conveniently sit Yanmega at 396 Speed after a single Speed Boost, enough to outpace Jolly Aerodactyl. If Hidden Power Fire is used in the fourth slot, 156 Speed EVs should be used with 100 Defense EVs to reach the same Speed threshold. A Modest nature is particularly viable because Speed Boost will compensate for Yanmega's reduced Speed, and he really needs the Special Attack boost to punch through opposing Pokemon. Focus Sash is chosen as the item so Yanmega can 2HKO Pokemon such as Heatran without being OHKOed first.</p> <p>Yanmega has trouble with Tyranitar, Swampert, Aerodactyl, Smeargle, and Roserade leads. Good partners to this set are Pokemon who can take on a group of those troublesome leads, set up Stealth Rock to support your team, or provide Rapid Spin support so Yanmega can have a chance to sweep later if he survives. For this reason, Life Orb Starmie makes an excellent teammate with its ability to Rapid Spin and scare away some of those leads with its STAB Hydro Pump. Skarmory can set up on Tyranitar and Swampert freely with its monstrous Defense and then just Whirlwind to scout the opponent's team and rack up entry hazard damage. Standard MixPert can do the same, and can set up Stealth Rock very effectively with its ability to switch into the Fire- and Rock-type attacks aimed at Yanmega. A status-absorbing Pokemon such as CroCune or RestTalk Machamp can switch into Sleep Powder or Spore from Roserade and Smeargle, respectively, and then switch to some other Pokemon with Sleep Clause active. Yanmega is excellent at applying offensive pressure immediately, which makes pairing him with other such offensive threats a good plan. Heatran makes a particularly excellent teammate for Yanmega, as he can come in on the Fire-type attacks aimed at Yanmega, gain a Flash Fire boost, and go to town. Heatran can also set up Stealth Rock and threaten Skarmory, a common Yanmega switch-in.</p> "

There are truly very few safe switch-ins to this Yanmega, as he has the power to punch through practically anyone in the metagame.</p> <p>Bug Buzz and Air Slash are mandatory on this set, giving Yanmega perfect type coverage within his STAB attacks alone. Hidden Power Ground is there to OHKO Pokemon who might try to switch in on Bug Buzz with their 4x resistance, such as Heatran and Lucario. U-turn fills the final slot perfectly, allowing Yanmega to scout the opponent's initial switch-in and bring out the necessary response. Be wary when using U-turn, however, as with Yanmega's Stealth Rock weakness, he cannot switch in haphazardly.</p> <p>The EVs are fairly standard for an offensive sweeper, maximizing Yanmega's Speed and Special Attack. Modest is the preferred nature as Timid allows Yanmega to outspeed very few notable Pokemon, while the added damage output from Modest is welcome.</p> <p>Hands down, the best offensive partners for this set are Gyarados and Metagross. Both of them are countered by Zapdos and Rotom-A, and both of them have a far easier time sweeping when they're removed. Serendipitously, fast Taunt-employing leads such as Aerodactyl and Azelf are also recommended for use alongside offensive Gyarados sets, so you do not have to go out of your way to use such leads just for Yanmega. However, if using Gyarados alongside Yanmega, you should construct your team with resistances to Rock- and Electric-type attacks in mind. It is also crucial to Yanmega's success that your team packs a Rapid Spinner such as Starmie or Forretress. Entry hazard support is also greatly appreciated by Yanmega, particularly Stealth Rock. With Stealth Rock on the field, this Yanmega can OHKO offensive variants of Rotom-A with Bug Buzz. Standard MixPert makes an excellent partner to set up Stealth Rock with his resistance to Fire- and Rock-type attacks. If Spikes are set up, even once-safe switch-ins can be 2HKOed or even OHKOed by Bug Buzz or Air Slash. Finally, make sure that your team can beat Blissey, who walls this set to the ends of the heavens and beyond. Lucario makes a fine choice for this, as he is immune to Toxic and supports Yanmega well with his 4x resistance to Rock-type attacks.</p> "

In fact, there is no Pokemon that can even come close to fulfilling the specific roles that Gliscor can fill. It is one of the most devastating stallbreakers in the tier, and it can utilize a scary Swords Dance set.</p> <p>While Gliscor is an incredible Pokemon, its raw power is comparatively low, and its Special Defense is lackluster.

That said, Gliscor's shortcomings are very few. It can fit onto a large variety of teams and is an essential Pokemon in OU.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Gliscor has a large movepool, and it can use a surprising number of moves to some degree of effectiveness. It can use a Stealth Rock set with U-turn, which can be a useful lead that uses U-turn to break a potential Focus Sash from Azelf, Empoleon, and Roserade. This set can also work effectively against Starmie by using U-turn as it comes in and following up with Tyranitar to trap and remove it. However, this set should not be used without dedicated support in Tyranitar and a Ghost-type like Rotom-A or Gengar, as a Stealth Rock user that is very weak to Starmie is a risky choice. A Choice Scarf set with Earthquake, Thunder Fang, Ice Fang, and U-turn can be effective, but Choice Scarf Flygon is usually more desirable, since its STAB-boosted Dragon-type attacks make it much more threatening. Fire Fang can be used over Ice Fang to better handle Swords Dance Scizor if your team cannot fit a primary check for it. Toxic can be used to cripple bulky Water-types like Milotic and Vaporeon, as well as Hippowdon and Rotom-A, but it is difficult to find room for this move without sacrificing a better option like Ice Fang. Stone Edge can be used to hit Zapdos, Dragonite, and Gyarados in only one slot, but its power is quite underwhelming, and other coverage and utility moves are generally preferred. Gliscor could support its team with Rain Dance, but there are almost always better options like Azelf and even Crobat. Night Slash can be used to hit Ghost-types, but it would only work as a surprise option and Gliscor is better off with its standard moves. Brick Break can be used to stunt hyper offense builds that utilize dual screens, but the move is so weak that this would be the only use. Aqua Tail can hit Hippowdon super effectively as well as opposing Gliscor, but so can Ice Fang, which can also threaten to freeze both of those Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types like Gyarados, Kingdra, Milotic, Starmie, Suicune, and Swampert can all threaten Gliscor massively with their super effective STAB attacks. Besides Kingdra, these Pokemon also commonly use Ice-type attacks, which are 4x super effective against Gliscor.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type attacks: Gliscor is 4x weak to Ice, so Pokemon that use Ice-type attacks like Jirachi, Hippowdon, Infernape, Heatran, Machamp, and Rotom-A can all be a threat. Ice-types like Abomasnow and Mamoswine can threaten Gliscor with STAB-boosted Ice-type attacks, namely Ice Shard, while simultaneously not taking too much damage from any of Gliscor's attacks⁠, although Mamoswine must watch out for Gliscor's Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon: Pokemon like Zapdos, Latias, Bronzong, Gengar, Cresselia, and Rotom-A are immune to Gliscor's strongest attacking move, can shrug off Ice Fang with ease, and are able to threaten Gliscor with powerful attacks or even status. Bronzong is especially effective versus Swords Dance Gliscor, but has to beware of a potential pairing with Magnezone. Cresselia can pack Ice Beam and Calm Mind simultaneously, which Gliscor cannot handle whatsoever, even with Taunt and Roost. Skarmory can do well versus Gliscor variants without Taunt, but it does not match up well otherwise.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Although Gliscor excels in its natural physical bulk, its special bulk is lackluster, so many special attacks from the likes of Gengar, Shaymin, Celebi, mixed Dragonite, Heatran, Infernape, and Latias can be quite troublesome to deal with.</p> ",

Taunt is also crucial versus offensive teams, as it can prevent setup sweepers from boosting their stats. Earthquake is Gliscor's best STAB move, dealing decent damage even without Attack investment and allowing Gliscor to OHKO most Heatran, Magnezone, and Lucario, all of which Gliscor can generally outspeed, as well as hit Pokemon like Tyranitar, Metagross, and Jirachi super effectively.</p> <p>Ice Fang is the most recommended move in the third slot, as it has many uses on Gliscor. Ice Fang can be used alongside Taunt to wear down Pokemon like Skarmory and Rotom-A, as although the damage is minimal, Gliscor is able to use Ice Fang multiple times against both Pokemon, which adds up over time. Ice Fang also hits Dragonite, Flygon, and opposing Gliscor for massive damage, and it simultaneously hits Grass-types super effectively; this affirms Gliscor's ability to take on Breloom. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used to cripple opposing teams, and it works especially effectively for removing items from Skarmory and Clefable, making it extremely strong versus stall. By opting to not use Ice Fang, however, Gliscor becomes worse versus Breloom and Dragon-types. Wing Attack is also a solid option when using a stall build for providing great insurance versus Breloom, consistently OHKOing it with 4x super effective damage. However, Wing Attack is not as good against stall builds compared to Ice Fang because it does not wear down Skarmory and Rotom-A as solidly and cannot threaten a freeze, and Knock Off is much better at dismantling stall builds than Wing Attack is as well.</p> <p>Roost is the last move, allowing Gliscor to keep itself healthy so it can consistently wear down stall and even bulkier offensive teams that can have trouble breaking it. Removing its Flying typing while healing is also a great bonus because Ground typing is actually quite good defensively, and its 4x weakness to Ice-type is reduced to 2x while using the move, which can allow Gliscor to actually sit in on weaker Ice-type attacks from Pokemon like defensive Swampert and Hippowdon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximizing HP and Speed is very effective when combined with Gliscor's natural bulk. The Speed investment and Jolly nature are necessary to maximize Taunt's effectiveness, enable Gliscor to function as a check to max Speed Lucario, and outspeed certain Pokemon like some variants of Jirachi, Roserade, non-Choice Scarf Rotom-A, and even offensive Suicune, which it can revenge kill if it is severely weakened. Optionally, Gliscor can use a minimum of 216 EVs in Speed to reach 308 Speed, which still allows it to outspeed Lucario, Roserade, Rotom-A, and offensive Suicune; the 40 EVs can then be transferred into Attack investment to guarantee a 3HKO on Breloom with Ice Fang regardless of Stealth Rock damage and to almost completely guarantee a 2HKO on maximum HP Metagross with Earthquake after Stealth Rock. This comes at the price of being slower than Pokemon that aim to Speed creep Gliscor like Zapdos, offensive Celebi, Jirachi, and opposing Gliscor.</p> <p>An Impish nature is a great alternative that gives Gliscor increased bulk, which makes a significant difference when facing foes like Choice Band Tyranitar, Choice Scarf Flygon, Metagross, and Lucario. With a spread of 252 HP / 40 Def / 216 Spe, Gliscor is still able to outspeed Adamant Lucario and max Speed Heatran, but it will lose out on shutting down fast Substitute + Will-O-Wisp Rotom-A. It will also be unable to hit Roserade first with a powerful Earthquake, and be potentially unable to use Taunt or Earthquake to either prevent Suicune from using Calm Mind or wear it down with chip damage. Another option is use maximum special bulk to become an excellent check to mixed attackers such as Flygon. With a spread such as 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD and a Careful nature, Gliscor survives weaker Ice-type attacks from Clefable, defensive Swampert, and Zapdos while maintaining its ability to check Lucario without Ice Punch and Breloom. It can even use a Sassy nature and minimum Speed IVs to have a Speed stat of 175, allowing it to underspeed Skarmory and Breloom to pivot effectively with U-turn.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because of Gliscor's unique typing and bulk, it can come in safely on many Pokemon. Use Gliscor's typing to your advantage by pivoting it into Electric-type, Ground-type, and even Fighting-type attacks. Gliscor can be used to gain momentum by punishing Choice Scarf Flygon and Choice Scarf Rotom-A's Earthquake and Thunderbolt. When facing a stall build, try to switch in on Skarmory; stall teams have decent diversity in their move selection, so try to properly scout movesets before comfortably sending Gliscor in on Pokemon like Tyranitar, Clefable, and Rotom-A. Taunt can completely shut down RestTalk and Substitute + Will-O-Wisp Rotom-A, provided that Gliscor does not switch in on Will-O-Wisp. Using Taunt can sometimes be quite risky against Pokemon like Swampert, Gyarados, and Dragonite, so proceed with caution and try not to use Taunt unsafely unless you deem it necessary. Sending Gliscor in on a double switch can be incredibly effective when facing stall builds, as they often have difficulty switching into Gliscor, which can create opportunities for you to put pressure on your foes. Take advantage of the defensive perks of Ground typing when using Roost with Gliscor to keep it healthy. Ice Fang can be used liberally and can often catch switches into Ground-immune pivots, as it will often hit those pivots super effectively and even occasionally inflict a freeze on them. If Gliscor is your main Lucario check, keeping it healthy is quite important. Try to determine if Lucario is using Ice Punch before sending Gliscor in. If you notice that Lucario isn't holding a Life Orb, then there is a higher likelihood that it packs Ice Punch with either a Choice item or a Shuca Berry; Gliscor needs to watch out for the latter, as Lucario can take an Earthquake with Shuca Berry and take Gliscor out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Starmie can switch into Gliscor very easily when it is healthy, spin away entry hazards, threaten the whole team with a powerful STAB Water-type move, or even recover its health, as Gliscor's Earthquake is simply not strong enough to threaten most healthy Starmie. For this reason, Tyranitar is an excellent teammate that can trap Starmie with Pursuit and threaten it with a powerful STAB Crunch or even Dark Pulse. Gliscor can also switch into Ground- and Fighting-type attacks while Tyranitar can come in on Ice-type attacks thanks to its sand-boosted Special Defense. Although both Tyranitar and Gliscor are weak to Water-type attacks, very specially bulky variants of Tyranitar can actually soft check Water-types like Starmie and Rain Dance Kingdra. Choice Scarf Tyranitar gets a special mention, since it can trap Starmie, Latias, Rotom-A, and even Gengar.</p> <p>Electric-type Pokemon can serve well to hit pesky Water-types like Gyarados, Starmie, Suicune, and Milotic super effectively. Zapdos has great defensive synergy with Gliscor, and it can use Hidden Power Grass to shut down Swampert while simultaneously matching up very well versus Gyarados, which is Gliscor's greatest enemy, and other Water-types as well. Zapdos also completely shuts down Swords Dance Scizor, an opponent that can actually give Gliscor trouble sometimes. Rotom-A can spinblock on defensive teams, which supports Gliscor in whittling down the opposition. As an Electric-type, it has similar benefits to Zapdos, and Choice Scarf Rotom-A notably is a fantastic revenge killer for removing Gyarados. Grass-types like Breloom, Celebi, and Shaymin can threaten bulky Water-types like Swampert and Milotic with super effective Grass-type attacks, while Celebi and Gliscor together make for a strong Fighting-resistant core. Although Grass-types serve as great answers to Water-types alongside Gliscor, an Ice-type weakness is compounded, so make sure to compensate for this with either Steel-types or your own Water-type.</p> <p>Magnezone pairs very well with Gliscor, forming a core that is devastating for defensive builds to face. Knock Off Gliscor gets a special mention, as it can remove a Skarmory's Shed Shell, allowing Magnezone to trap it without any issues. Magnezone can also trap Bronzong, Choice Scarf Jirachi, and Scizor, which have the potential to give Gliscor some trouble with Explosion, Ice Punch, and potentially boosted Bullet Punch. Gliscor has nice type synergy with Steel-types, as it can come in on Ground- and Fighting-type attacks while Steel-types can come in on Ice-type attacks for it. Skarmory and Gliscor form a fantastic defensive core because Gliscor can switch into Electric-type attacks, especially ones from Choice Scarf Rotom-A. Spikes support from Skarmory can also assist Gliscor in wearing down an opposing team. Water-types resist both Water- and Ice-type attacks, which are the only two types that Gliscor is weak to. Starmie, Milotic, and Suicune all pair nicely with Gliscor. The latter two can combine with Gliscor to form a strong defensive core that does well against Dragon Dance sweepers like Dragonite, Gyarados, and Tyranitar; in return, Gliscor can even check Swords Dance Lucario quite well, which Suicune and Milotic can both only soft check. Milotic can be used alongside Gliscor to form a defensive core that offensive teams often find quite difficult to break.</p> <p>Clefable and Blissey can come in on special Water- and Ice-type attacks while Gliscor can take physical attacks well, especially Fighting-type attacks. Because Clefable and Blissey are passive, setup sweepers can often take advantage of them which is where Gliscor's Taunt and defensive utility can be useful for stopping those setup Pokemon in their tracks. Latias resists Water-type attacks and has high Special Defense, which complements Gliscor's high Defense quite well. Choice Scarf Latias can also use Thunderbolt to revenge kill Gyarados. Using Toxic Spikes alongside Gliscor from Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Roserade can be beneficial for wearing down potential Gliscor checks like Celebi, Hippowdon, Swampert, Milotic, and Suicune.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Gliscor is a versatile Swords Dance sweeper that can employ either a set with incredible staying power or an all-out offensive set that thrives on perfect coverage. Because of Gliscor's natural bulk and unique typing, it can find many opportunities to use Swords Dance and put pressure on offensive and defensive teams alike. Another great way to use Swords Dance Gliscor is to weaken an opposing team, allowing Gliscor to serve as an effective late-game cleaner. Earthquake is Gliscor's best STAB move, which can deal massive damage after Swords Dance has been used. Even without a Swords Dance boost, Earthquake can hit Heatran, Jirachi, Lucario, Magnezone, and Metagross for super effective damage.</p> <p>Ice Fang is used in the third slot because it hits many of Gliscor's checks super effectively. Although it's a weak attack, it can cleanly OHKO Pokemon like Dragonite and Flygon and come very close to OHKOing opposing Gliscor after a Swords Dance boost. It can even OHKO certain variants of Breloom after just a single Swords Dance boost.</p> <p>Roost can be used alongside Swords Dance to give Gliscor more staying power and longevity, maximizing its ability to switch in on and threaten its foes while using Swords Dance over a longer game. However, Thunder Fang can be used to form an all-out offensive set, which can OHKO Gyarados after a Swords Dance and come as a huge surprise to your opponent, while also hitting Skarmory super effectively. Taunt is another alternative that, when paired with Swords Dance, can absolutely obliterate opposing stall builds. When using Taunt over Roost, however, Gliscor's staying power is reduced, and you will have to rely on constant passive recovery in order to keep Gliscor healthy and maximize its effectiveness.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Gliscor's Attack and Speed are maximized in order to give it as much of an offensive presence as possible. The Speed investment and Jolly nature maintain Gliscor's ability to check Lucario quite well and also let it outspeed some variants of Jirachi, Roserade, and offensive Suicune. Leftovers is the preferred item, which is especially important if opting for Taunt, but Yache Berry can sometimes be used for a more offensive take, as it can allow Gliscor to sponge an Ice-type attack from the likes of Tyranitar, Jirachi, and even Blissey and Clefable. Gliscor can even stay in on Hidden Power Ice from Zapdos and Infernape, which for the latter can enable it to OHKO it with Earthquake. When behind Light Screen and Reflect, Yache Berry can ensure that Gliscor can survive even the strongest of Ice-type attacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Swords Dance Gliscor benefits especially from capitalizing off bad locked moves from Choice item Pokemon, so try to detect Choice Scarf Flygon and Choice Scarf Rotom-A, and conceal your Gliscor until you can switch in on an Earthquake from the former or a Thunderbolt from the latter. Swords Dance Gliscor is especially good at playing off its surprise factor, since it's not that common. Moves like Thunder Fang and Swords Dance can be played very effectively with this strategy either by luring in Gyarados or conditioning your opponent to not feel as uncomfortable as they should about giving Gliscor momentum. If you're not using Roost, Gliscor's health and passive recovery are extremely important. If Stealth Rock is not up on your side of the field, try to find instances where you can send Gliscor in simply to restore a bit of HP with Leftovers. If you're using Taunt, Swords Dance will be even less expected, so try to play on that surprise as well; if you're using Roost, you can likely use Swords Dance more frequently during the battle, so take advantage of Gliscor's ability to constantly set up and pressure the opposing team. Ice Fang can be used to catch pivots that come in on an expected Earthquake, and it will often hit them super effectively.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Tyranitar pairs extremely well with Swords Dance Gliscor because it can trap Starmie, Rotom-A, Latias, and Gengar, all of which can prevent Swords Dance Gliscor from cleaning. Swords Dance Gliscor has no HP investment and maximum Speed, so Bronzong's Gyro Ball can often 2HKO it. Thunder Fang is Gliscor's best option against Bronzong, which does laughable damage even after a Swords Dance boost. On top of that, with its inability to properly run Taunt and Roost at the same time, it has a hard time preventing Bronzong from setting up Trick Room, and some Bronzong variants even pack Hidden Power Ice. For this reason, Magnezone is an excellent pairing, as it can trap Bronzong and remove it by using Magnet Rise and Thunderbolt; it can also trap Scizor and Choice Scarf Jirachi, which can deal significant damage to Swords Dance Gliscor with Bullet Punch and Ice Punch. Skarmory can phaze Gliscor with Whirlwind to give it trouble, but Magnezone can also trap it, aiding in Swords Dance Gliscor's ability to clean late-game. Your own Scizor can pair very well with Gliscor, as it can threaten Gengar and use its U-turn to help Gliscor reliably switch in and set up.</p> <p>Water-types like Starmie, Milotic, Suicune, and Swampert can make things very difficult for Gliscor either by outspeeding and threatening to OHKO it with a Water- or Ice-type move, or by surviving a Swords Dance-boosted attack. If Gliscor doesn't have Thunder Fang, Gyarados can switch in with ease and fearlessly shrug off a +2 Ice Fang. Grass- and Electric-types like Breloom, Celebi, Shaymin, Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Raikou can threaten Water-types and offensively synergize with Gliscor quite well. In particular, Grass-types other than most Breloom can serve as solid switch-ins to Water-type attacks, which can be especially helpful, but they are also weak to Ice-type moves.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Jirachi, Rotom-A, and Latias can all revenge kill Gyarados and other setup sweepers. Jirachi also resists Ice-type attacks, and while Latias resists Water-type attacks. In return, Gliscor can come in on Ground-type attacks aimed at Jirachi and Bug-type attacks aimed at Latias.</p> "

  "Mamoswine": {
    "overview": "<p>When you hear people talking in veiled whispers about actually using Ice-type Pokemon in OU, one of the few they'll be talking about is Mamoswine. Mamoswine's unique typing provides a neutrality to Stealth Rock, immunity to both hail and sandstorm, and an incredibly potent offensive STAB combination that is resisted only by Bronzong in all of DPP OU. This, in conjunction with Mamoswine's gigantic base 130 Attack stat, STAB Earthquake, and access to priority in the form of Ice Shard, leaves little to imagination as to how Mamoswine survives in a metagame so hostile to Ice-type Pokemon.</p> <p>Mamoswine is a powerful Pokemon, but as an Ice-type, he carries all of their associated and unfortunate weaknesses. With the prevalence of Steel-, Fighting-, Water-, and Fire-type attacks in OU, a vast number of offensive Pokemon have the ability to outspeed and OHKO Mamoswine with one of their typical attacks. This makes it difficult to get Mamoswine into play, as his only free switch-ins are on predicted Electric-type attacks. As if to make matters worse, Mamoswine is cursed with very mediocre Speed, leaving him to be outsped by many common Pokemon in the tier. Despite these enormous setbacks, Mamoswine maintains his position as a moderate threat and potent wallbreaker.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mamoswine has a few notable options that he can use to great effect and to beat his normal checks. When used in hail, Blizzard can be used off of Mamoswine's decent base 70 Special Attack stat with a Life Orb to 2HKO Skarmory. Bite can be useful for hurting Rotom-A and Azelf, although it is too weak to be useful anywhere else. An Expert Belt or NeverMeltIce is usable as an item to bluff the standard Choice Band set and score some surprise KOs against Pokemon that would normally love to set up on Choice-locked Earthquake, such as Zapdos, Gliscor, or Gyarados. Choice Scarf Mamoswine can be useful to catch your opponent off-guard with the added Speed. Because Mamoswine has access to STAB Ice Shard, however, it typically is in his best interest to run an item that boosts damage in some form. Mamoswine can also set up either Reflect or Light Screen as he forces a switch, but this role is generally better left to more durable Pokemon.</p> <p>Mamoswine can run a set of Ice Shard, Earthquake, Endeavor, and either Substitute or Endure in the last slot to lure in and remove Pokemon that typically beat Mamoswine, such as Scizor and Bronzong. This set, when used with either a Liechi Berry or Salac Berry, can be effective due to Mamoswine's immunity to both hail and sandstorm, although it is easily foiled by phazing from the likes of Skarmory. Mamoswine is almost always better off using the Physical Attacker set instead and leaving the handling of Scizor and friends to other Pokemon that are better suited for it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As an Ice-type Pokemon, Mamoswine has a rather unhealthy list of responses in the OU metagame. One of the things that makes Mamoswine viable in OU is that if the opponent mispredicts, they will likely lose a Pokemon due to Mamoswine's raw power and STAB type coverage. Jirachi, Lucario, and Scizor can all switch into an Ice-type attack and threaten to OHKO Mamoswine with their STAB attacks, but will be maimed by Earthquake if they mispredict. Similarly, Gyarados and Zapdos will try to switch into Earthquake and either set up on Mamoswine (in Gyarados's case) or attempt to seriously damage him with Heat Wave (in Zapdos's case). Levitate Bronzong is a textbook counter to anything Mamoswine will try to do, bar Choice Band Superpower. It shrugs off all of Mamoswine's other attacks and can take him down with a super effective Gyro Ball. Skarmory functions in a similar manner, despite having a neutrality to Ice-type attacks; he will set up Spikes on Mamoswine and then Whirlwind him away instead of trying to KO him. Because of Ice Shard's low Base Power, very defensive Pokemon that are weak to Ice-type attacks, such as Hippowdon and Celebi, can still check Mamoswine effectively. In addition, Cresselia and Uxie can set up dual screens on Mamoswine with their immunity to Earthquake and high defenses.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This set is designed to do what Mamoswine does best: knock the stuffing out of things. With excellent type coverage and a base 130 Attack stat, opponents will constantly be playing a deadly guessing game of prediction in order to switch in something that can take Mamoswine's chosen attack. Although this set is very reliant on prediction, it yields an enormous payout if played correctly.</p> <p>Mamoswine's Earthquake is the third-most powerful in the game, so there's no doubt that it'll be on this set. Despite its low Base Power, Ice Shard is a strong move that can snipe and eliminate the many Ice-weak Pokemon in OU. Stone Edge is Mamoswine's best option against Gyarados, and with a Choice Band can even OHKO physically defensive Zapdos after Stealth Rock damage. Superpower is an immensely powerful attack, chosen for an immediate OHKO on Blissey and to deal respectable damage to Bronzong and Skarmory switch-ins. Stealth Rock is useful on Mamoswine that carry Life Orb because he forces many switches with his power and can easily set it up.</p> <p>Mamoswine is a simple beast, and his favored EV spreads are much the same way. 252 Attack and Speed EVs are used so that Mamoswine hits as hard and as quickly as possible. The remaining 4 EVs are placed in Defense, as Mamoswine's HP stat is already very high. Jolly is the preferred nature so that Mamoswine can outspeed Naive Heatran and Adamant Lucario and OHKO both with Earthquake. Adamant is still an option, however, as the added power is significant. The item choice depends on how you want to use Mamoswine. Choice Band is preferred, as Mamoswine's resulting monumental Attack stat will destroy virtually anything that doesn't resist his attacks. However, the Choice Band set relies immensely on prediction, since giving Pokemon like Gyarados or Zapdos free switch-ins with Earthquake is never a good idea. Life Orb gives Mamoswine the flexibility of alternating between attacks to ease prediction at the cost of some of his HP per hit and reduced damage output. If using Stealth Rock, Life Orb should definitely be chosen over Choice Band so Mamoswine is not locked into it. Ice Fang can be used over Superpower because it is quite a bit more powerful than Ice Shard and will 2HKO physically defensive Celebi. It is generally an inferior option, though, because Mamoswine still achieves most necessary OHKOs and 2HKOs with Stone Edge and Ice Shard. Lastly, Substitute can be used over Stone Edge or Superpower to ease prediction, although the compounded residual damage from entry hazards and Substitute makes Leftovers the preferred item choice for such a variant.</p> <p>With Stealth Rock in the last slot instead of Superpower, Mamoswine can make either an excellent attacking lead or an excellent complement to another attacking lead such as Machamp. Mamoswine loathes the defensive, Ground-immune Steel-types Bronzong and Skarmory. Bronzong can OHKO Mamoswine with Gyro Ball while Skarmory can set up on Mamoswine and then Whirlwind him away. Scizor causes similar problems with his ability to survive a Choice Band Earthquake and OHKO Mamoswine back with Bullet Punch. It might be tempting to pair Mamoswine with Magnezone, which nearly perfectly stops these three Steel-types in their tracks, but because Magnezone shares a Fire- and Fighting-type weakness with Mamoswine, alternative partners are recommended. Heatran is an excellent teammate for his ability to reliably beat Skarmory, Bronzong, and Scizor. That he has a 4x resistance to Steel-type attacks and an immunity to Fire-type attacks is icing on the cake. It is important that you be wary of Earthquake when switching Heatran into Bronzong or Superpower when switching him into Scizor, though. Gyarados will try to switch into Earthquake, Intimidate Mamoswine, and proceed to set up Dragon Dance. Rotom-H makes a superb teammate for Mamoswine for its ability to take down Gyarados, OHKO Lucario and Skarmory with Overheat and Thunderbolt, respectively, and burn Bronzong switch-ins with Will-O-Wisp. Infernape can switch in on a predicted Ice Shard and threaten to OHKO Mamoswine with either STAB attack, so a Gyarados of your own is a good choice to take care of it. Starmie can also take on Infernape and simultaneously remove the entry hazards that Mamoswine doesn't particularly enjoy, but Starmie won't want to switch into Scizor.</p> "

        "name": "Lead",
        "description": "<p>Mamoswine makes for an effective lead with his excellent STAB attacking types, access to priority in Ice Shard, and Stealth Rock. Mamoswine's Attack stat and STAB Earthquake let him seriously hurt Metagross and OHKO Heatran leads through Shuca Berry. He can set up Stealth Rock reliably due to the switches he forces early in the match. Mamoswine can also function as a physical attacker later in the match with his excellent type coverage and powerful STAB priority.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is an important asset for leads, and Mamoswine sets it up well with his usable Speed and offensive presence. Earthquake and Ice Shard are Mamoswine's STAB attacks on this set, providing him with a combination of high-power and priority for hitting hard and picking off faster leads, respectively. A couple of options exist for the last slot, all of which help in specific situations. Endeavor is recommended since he will often be taken down to 1 HP with his Focus Sash, allowing him to cripple an opposing Pokemon before ultimately being taken down. Stone Edge can be used over Endeavor as a more reliable means to deal with Gyarados switch-ins that will attempt to set up on Mamoswine.</p> <p>252 Attack and Speed EVs are standard, allowing Mamoswine to hit as hard and as fast as possible. The nature can be a difficult decision for this set, though. An Adamant nature is necessary to OHKO Shuca Berry Heatran with Earthquake, whereas a Jolly nature is necessary to outspeed the same Heatran. Jolly tends to be more useful later in the game for outpacing Pokemon like Jolly Breloom and Adamant Lucario, but the damage boost from Adamant is significant and can make Zapdos and Gyarados switch-ins think twice about trying to set up on Mamoswine. A Focus Sash is necessary to survive attacks from opposing leads so that Mamoswine can KO them in return. Protect is worth a mention for use in the last slot over Endeavor and Stone Edge since it enables Mamoswine to beat Infernape leads. It generally has less late-game utility than the suggested options, but it can be useful on specific teams that have major trouble with lead Infernape.</p> <p>Mamoswine has trouble with Jirachi and Bronzong leads, so Magnezone makes for a wonderful partner, even though it shares two common weaknesses with Mamoswine. Magnezone is also useful for beating Scizor that tend to switch into Mamoswine. Mamoswine doesn't like facing down Azelf leads, so having a Choice Scarf Tyranitar on your team will help a lot with this, despite compounding the Scizor weakness. Machamp leads are obnoxious and will avoid a 2HKO from Earthquake followed by Ice Shard, however they will take serious damage from Earthquake regardless. Similarly, Infernape leads will beat Mamoswine that lack Protect. Because of this, it is worth having a bulky Gyarados on your team to switch into both Machamp and Infernape without much issue. Starmie is a good partner if you picked Endeavor as the last move, as it can handle Infernape well, get rid of Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin, and handle other leads that give Mamoswine trouble. Lastly, Rotom-A is an excellent partner to lead Mamoswine for being able to deal with the Gyarados that love setting up on him and for its immunity to Machamp's Dynamic Punch and Azelf's Explosion.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Porygon-Z is one of the strongest attackers in the tier, as both of its abilties can potentially boost the power of its moves and it has a fantastic offensive movepool. Adaptability boosted Tri Attack hammers many prominent defensive Pokemon such as Latias and Clefable, while its coverage options threaten walls that resists Normal, such as Jirachi and Skarmory. With Nasty Plot, Porygon-Z can 2HKO every Pokemon in the tier, even Blissey. Unfortunately, Porygon-Z struggles with just about everything else besides attacking, as its typing gives it no resistances besides its immunity to Ghost-types and its frailty make switching it in difficult. Porygon-Z especially struggles against offensive pressure from faster Pokemon such as Latias, Starmie, and Flygon, as it has average Speed and is easily at least 2HKOed by most common attacks. Faster Pokemon that resist or are immune to Normal, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Choice Scarf Heatran, Jirachi, Gengar, and Scizor using Bullet Punch can switch into even boosted Tri Attack and KO or heavily damage Porygon-Z. Porygon-Z is also very weak to residual damage and status—it is vulnerable to sand and affected by all three entry hazards. Paralysis ruins its Speed and burn and poison further expose its poor bulk. Porygon-Z can be effective against slower defensive teams as an offensive lead, but generally is not recommended for use in DPP OU.</p> ",

With this combination, she can set up entry hazards while blocking Rapid Spin at the same time. What also separates her from other supporters is her blistering Speed coupled with Taunt, which effectively blocks attempts to keep Froslass from setting up while preventing opposing Pokemon from setting up their own entry hazards. Froslass also works well on hail teams, as Substitute, Thunder Wave, and Snow Cloak will surely annoy the opponent. Despite all of these advantages, Froslass isn't well equipped to handle the OU metagame due to her common weaknesses and the prevalence of priority moves, especially Bullet Punch. Nevertheless, Froslass is a great choice for offensive teams that require Spikes at the beginning of the game without resorting to the slower Skarmory or Forretress.</p> ",

Hidden Power Ground can be used for Heatran, as it has a 79% chance of OHKOing 0 HP / 0 SpD negative natured Heatran with Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes down. Hidden Power Grass can be used for Swampert, 2HKOing the 252 HP / 0 SpD neutral natured MixPert set. Hidden Power Fire snags an OHKO on any unsuspecting Forretress and Scizor who try to Pursuit, but also leaves Froslass with a 30 Speed IV. Thunderbolt allows you to hit Water-types who resist Ice Beam along with Skarmory, although Starmie would be hit harder by Shadow Ball due to its weakness to Ghost-type moves.</p> <p>Froslass can also use an offensively oriented set, composed of Ice Beam, Shadow Ball, Thunderbolt, and a Hidden Power or Trick if Froslass is holding a Choice item. However, Gengar is generally a better Pokemon for this, as its higher Special Attack allows it to deal more damage. Froslass can also use a set with Trick to debilitate her opponents and then begin to set up Spikes, but her low defenses make it hard to do so effectively.</p> <p>As for support options, Light Screen may be used, but Froslass is generally too frail to continuously set them up. Block can be used along with Destiny Bond and Taunt to force a kill, but it is a one-time deal. Snatch can steal a Substitute or stat boosts from your opponent if they try to set up in front of Froslass to avoid Destiny Bond. Swagger can be used over Confuse Ray on the Snow Cloak set in order for the opponent to deal more damage to itself if it hits itself, but its 90% accuracy and the +2 Attack boost it gives to the opposing Pokemon can be dangerous.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Froslass's main counter is Tyranitar, as Sand Stream immediately removes any hail falling on the field, while he can threaten Froslass with Pursuit, Crunch, or Stone Edge. His ability causes a sandstorm, gives him a Special Defense boost and allowing Tyranitar to shrug off any Ice Beams Froslass may try to use. Scizor and Metagross can both come in on Ice Beam or Shadow Ball and bypass Froslass's Speed with Bullet Punch or catch her switching out with Pursuit. Snorlax can Pursuit or Crunch Froslass, depending on if she stays in or not. Also, any faster Taunter can force Froslass to attack and stop using support moves as Substitute does not block Taunt. Slower Taunters have to watch out for Thunder Wave.</p> <p>As a lead, Azelf and Aerodactyl both shut her down, as their higher Speed coupled with Taunt prevents Froslass from setting up any Spikes. Although Froslass can 2HKO them with Ice Beam, they will have still managed to set up Stealth Rock. On the Snow Cloak set, however, Swampert is a good counter to Froslass because of his immunity to Thunder Wave and neutrality to Blizzard and Ice Beam. Swampert can either Roar away Froslass or attack her with Earthquake or Surf.</p> <p>Froslass's success is tied to her Speed. If you can inflict paralysis upon her, Froslass will be effectively neutered. Barring that, Bullet Punch, Shadow Sneak, and Sucker Punch all have priority, bypassing Froslass's impressive Speed and scoring super effective damage. Stealth Rock also prevents Froslass from switching in too many times. Since her defenses are not that impressive, hitting Froslass with any neutral attack will cause severe damage to her, most likely causing her to die from another switch-in.</p> ",

        "name": "Spikes Lead",
        "description": "<p>Froslass is a good lead in today's metagame, as her base 110 Speed and immunity to Fake Out and Explosion allow her to fare well against some of the more commonly seen leads. Opposing leads who attempt to set up entry hazards are stopped by Taunt, enabling Froslass to set up her own entry hazards.</p> <p>Spikes is the main move in this set, causing residual damage whenever the opponent switches Pokemon. Taunt serves the same purpose as in the previous paragraph, while Destiny Bond works well with Taunt to take down the opposing Pokemon. Ice Beam rounds out the set, allowing you to 2HKO Aerodactyl, Azelf, and Hippowdon leads.</p> <p>Froslass has other viable attacking moves as a lead. Shadow Ball may be used as an alternative STAB attack, allowing you to 2HKO Infernape leads 80% of the time. However, you do lose the KOs on Aerodactyl and Hippowdon. Ice Shard may be used to 2HKO Aerodactyl, and its priority will cause Aerodactyl to either Taunt or set up Stealth Rock before dying; however, KOs on Azelf and Hippowdon are lost. If using Ice Shard, use 252 Attack EVs instead of Special Attack and a Jolly nature. Alternatively, Froslass may set up Spikes mid-game. With an EV spread of 248 HP / 8 SpD / 252 Spe along with Leftovers, she can survive various weaker attacks, such as unboosted Surfs from bulky Water-type Pokemon. She's also different from other Spikes users in that losing her doesn't mean you're losing a key defensive member of your team. Additionally, with Taunt and Ice Beam, opposing Pokemon will be hard pressed to set up, whereas Forretress and Skarmory can be forced out.</p> <p>Against leads who are slower than Froslass like Swampert and Heatran, leads who try to debilitate you like Roserade and Smeargle, or leads who set up such as Ninjask, Froslass can either Taunt and set up a minimum of one layer of Spikes, gain a Destiny Bond kill, or both depending on if the opponent tried to set up Stealth Rock the first turn. If you forgo the Taunt on the first turn, Froslass gets up a minimum of two layers of Spikes or one layer of Spikes and a Destiny Bond kill. If any lead decides to set up Stealth Rock, that's a minimum of three layers as Froslass goes down, or two layers of Spikes and a kill with Destiny Bond.</p> <p>Froslass has problems with leads such as Aerodactyl, Azelf, and Jirachi, as their higher Speed allows them to stop Froslass from setting up Spikes. Leads with priority, such as Metagross and Mamoswine, also cause problems for Froslass, as they force Froslass to either Taunt or set up a single layer of Spikes. If he attacks, Tyranitar can kill Froslass in one turn since the sandstorm nullifies Focus Sash. To combat these opposing leads, a variety of Pokemon may be used. To handle Aerodactyl and Azelf, you could attack immediately with Ice Beam, but they'll have accomplished their goal: Taunt the opposing lead and set up their own Stealth Rock. Magnezone and Swampert can handle Jirachi and Metagross. Swampert can also help against Mamoswine, Aerodactyl, and Tyranitar by hitting them with Surf, Earthquake, or Ice Beam. He can also set up Stealth Rock and provide Froslass with Fire-, Steel-, and Rock-type resistances.</p> <p>While Froslass is a Ghost-type Pokemon, she usually cannot last long enough to switch back later on in the match. This allows Rapid Spinners like Forretress and Starmie to switch in and Spin away your Spikes. Rotom-H makes a good partner to Froslass, as it not only blocks Rapid Spin, but can scare away both Forretress and Starmie with Overheat and STAB Thunderbolt respectively.</p> "

        "name": "Hail Stall",
        "description": "<p>While Froslass can make a reliable lead, you cannot forget about her ability: Snow Cloak. This set combines Snow Cloak and paralysis to cause plenty of stress for your opponent. For example, with the opposing Pokemon paralyzed and hail falling, Froslass will only be hit by a 100% accuracy move 60% of the time. If you can confuse the opponent, either through Froslass running Confuse Ray or some other means, then that brings the chance down to 30%, allowing Froslass to either set up Spikes or attack with her STAB move with near impunity.</p> <p>Substitute allows you to stall until the opposing Pokemon misses an attack. Thunder Wave slows down the opponent so Froslass can set up a Substitute before it can move and can prevent the opponent from attacking. It also prevents opposing Pokemon who try to use stat up moves from sweeping due to their lower Speed. While Froslass has a Substitute up, she can set up Spikes, which, alongside hail, slowly wear down the enemy. The last slot is for either attacking or more utility if you feel it is necessary. Blizzard takes advantage of the hail due to the accuracy boost it receives. Ice Beam is there for the extra PP and accuracy outside of hail, but is weaker. Taunt is an interesting choice on Froslass, as it prevents opponents from setting up, such as opposing Calm Minders. It also prevents Forretress and Skarmory from setting up entry hazards but prevents Froslass from dealing any damage.</p> <p>Leftovers is the recommended item to use on this set. With it, Froslass will be able to recover HP in order to create more Substitutes and restore HP while setting up Spikes. 248 HP EVs give her maximum defensive capabilities and allow her to switch into Stealth Rock four times from full health. 32 Speed EVs allow Froslass to outspeed neutral base 95s such as Electivire and positive base 81s such as Gyarados. The remaining EVs go into Defense to increase Froslass's physical bulk.</p> <p>Although Leftovers is the main option for this set, Bright Powder may be used as an alternative item. However, it is generally inferior to Leftovers because it does nothing if your opponent is taking the time to set up their own entry hazards or stat boosts. Leftovers allows you to continue healing while your opponent is attempting to set up, letting you make more Substitutes. Confuse Ray can also work in the last slot in order to lower the chance of the opponent hitting Froslass even further.</p> <p>In order to effectively use this set, pairing Froslass with Abomasnow is absolutely required. His ability, Snow Warning, brings permanent hail onto the battlefield and activates Froslass's ability. However, both Abomasnow and Froslass have trouble with Steel-, Fire-, and Rock-type moves. While Froslass may be able to Thunder Wave Pokemon carrying these moves, she cannot do much else against them. For this reason, Abomasnow should be of the SubPunch variant to take out Steel-type Pokemon or may choose to carry Earthquake to deal with both Steel- and Fire-type Pokemon.</p> <p>Having both Abomasnow and Froslass on one team creates many weaknesses. Furthermore, basing a team around hail possesses problems in the forms of Tyranitar and Hippowdon, as their ability replaces hail with sandstorm. Fortunately, a bulky Water-type Pokemon can help mitigate these problems, as Water-types resist Fire- and Steel-type moves and scare Tyranitar and Hippowdon away with STAB super effective Surfs. Swampert can set up Stealth Rock, Roar out the opposing Pokemon, and resists all three common weaknesses of Abomasnow and Froslass. Suicune's impressive defenses let it wall both special and physical attacks and can also utilize Roar. Vaporeon can pass Wishes to Froslass and Abomasnow, which is helpful due to the shared Stealth Rock weakness. Tentacruel can easily sponge Fire-type attacks thanks to his Water typing and high Special Defense, as well as Rapid Spin away entry hazards and set up Toxic Spikes. Heatran can use his ability to switch into Fire-type attacks and also resists Steel-type attacks, while Froslass's Ghost typing allows her to switch into Fighting-type moves like Close Combat.</p> <p>Because this set is not a lead, Froslass can switch in later on in the game to block Rapid Spin. However, she cannot do much against Forretress and Starmie offensively because both of them resist Ice-type attacks and Thunder Wave actually makes Forretress's Gyro Ball stronger. Once again, Rotom-H would make a good partner for reasons mentioned in the previous set. Additionally, Rotom-F would make a good partner due to hail boosting the accuracy of its Blizzards to 100%. However, it has trouble hitting Forretress effectively.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf Lead",
        "description": "<p>Froslass has an excellent Speed stat, which when combined with access to Spikes, makes her an excellent lead. Although she is generally slower than Aerodactyl and Azelf, this set attempts to remedy that by using a Choice Scarf. With the Choice Scarf, she can either cripple the opposing lead or proceed to set up several layers of Spikes.</p> <p>Trick is a powerful move on this set, as it cripples your opponent's lead. If Froslass is up against Aerodactyl or Azelf, she can Trick the Choice Scarf and lock them into either Taunt or Stealth Rock. If it's a bulky lead, then you've deprived your opponent of a useful late-game tank. Spikes is to take advantage of bulky leads as they switch out if they're locked into Stealth Rock or a weak attacking move. Destiny Bond gives you a free kill when you die, potentially allowing Froslass to cripple one Pokemon and KO another. Ice Beam is a reliable STAB option for 2HKOing Azelf and Aerodactyl leads, along with unboosted Dragon-type Pokemon. Furthermore, it ensures Froslass doesn't become useless if opposing leads Taunt her.</p> <p>Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball deserve a mention due to being able to hit Skarmory and Gengar for super effective damage. Thunderbolt can also be used to revenge kill Gyarados should Froslass still have her Choice Scarf. Feel free to use them over Destiny Bond. Additionally, if you keep the Choice Scarf later on in the game, Froslass can be a makeshift revenge killer, KOing +1 Dragon Dance Dragonite along with outspeeding Gengar.</p> <p>This set is heavily reliant on prediction, and if played incorrectly, can give your opponent an early advantage. Furthermore, several opposing leads cause problems for it. Metagross can just Bullet Punch twice or use Meteor Mash, as Froslass doesn't have a Focus Sash to protect herself from a hit. This means that you either get up one layer of Spikes, face an opposing Choice Scarf Metagross, or begin the game 5-5 with a Destiny Bond KO. Heatran can also be annoying, as Fire Blast OHKOes Froslass. Scizor is also a threat to this set, as Bullet Punch will bypass Froslass's outstanding Speed and Pursuit places Froslass in a checkmate position.</p> <p>Magnezone is a great partner to this set, as it can kill opposing Metagross who are locked into Meteor Mash or Bullet Punch along with Scizor. Swampert is a handy partner, as its Water typing grants it a resistance to Fire-type moves. It can also get up Stealth Rock for more residual damage. Both of them also resist several types that Froslass fears.</p> <p>Furthermore, an additional Ghost-type Pokemon is helpful to help keep Spikes on your side of the field. Rotom-H is a great partner to Froslass as it can hit Starmie and Forretress with super effective moves. It also helps scare away Metagross. Rotom-W can be used to scare away Heatran also, but don't go switching it into Fire Blast.</p> "

  "Uxie": {
    "overview": "<p>With incredible defensive stats and a plentiful amount of supporting moves such as Thunder Wave, Stealth Rock, Reflect, Light Screen, and Memento, Uxie can take many hits and assist its team with ease. Furthermore, it can utilize Trick in order to cripple the opposing Pokemon with a Choice Scarf, which is great at supporting setup sweepers.</p> <p>Uxie is weak to common attacking types from most standard Pokemon, such as Tyranitar and Rotom-A. Additionally, Uxie faces some competition as a utility lead from Azelf, who is much faster and packs moves like Taunt and Explosion. Nevertheless, Uxie is a great addition to any team due to its ability to support its teammates in a variety of effective ways.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Uxie has a wide movepool, which enables it to utilize many different strategies. Uxie can be an effective field effect supporter by using Rain Dance, Trick Room, or even Sunny Day. Since Uxie has tremendous natural bulk and functions as a reliable pivot, it is actually better at doing this than most other Pokemon. Fire Punch can be used to surprise Scizor and even Forretress, but this should only be used if there is a pressing need for a Scizor check. Grass Knot can hit Pokemon like Swampert and Tyranitar, but stronger Pokemon are more effective at using the move. Imprison can be used to prevent foes like Swampert, Hippowdon, and Metagross from setting up Stealth Rock. A Trick + Iron Ball set can surprise a Ground-immune foe like Zapdos, Skarmory, and Rotom, but the item suppresses Uxie's Levitate until Uxie's no longer holding it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Taunt Users: Uxie's main purpose is to support its teammates with moves like Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, Light Screen, and Reflect, so Taunt users like Gliscor, Heatran, Skarmory, and Gyarados can completely stop Uxie in its tracks while also taking advantage of its weak attacks.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar: Tyranitar is immune to Psychic, doesn't mind paralysis as much as other Pokemon, and can maim Uxie with a powerful Crunch or trap it with Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert are immune to Thunder Wave and also shrug off Psychic. Hippowdon needs to watch out for Trick, but if Uxie doesn't have it, Hippowdon can take advantage by setting up Stealth Rock or phazing with Roar.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attackers</strong>: Gengar, Rotom-A, Scizor, and even Heracross can threaten Uxie with their powerful super effective STAB attacks. Gengar and Rotom can utilize Substitute to block status moves and then attack with Shadow Ball, while Scizor and Heracross can hit hard with U-turn and Megahorn.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types like Jirachi, Metagross, Heatran, and Magnezone can at most be crippled by Thunder Wave. Psychic barely does any damage at all, and all these Pokemon can fire back with strong attacks.</p> <p><strong>Status Inducers: Uxie really dislikes status, mainly poison or a burn, so Pokemon like Heatran, Clefable and Zapdos can be quite annoying. Clefable's doesn't care about status because of its Magic Guard, which means it completely invalidates Uxie unless Uxie uses Trick to give it a Choice Scarf.</p> ",

        "name": "Utility Lead",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunder Wave is a great move for stunting opposing offense and soft checking setup sweepers. Uxie is a very reliable Stealth Rock user due to its immense bulk and Ground immunity, and its decent defensive typing complements these traits. Psychic is Uxie's best STAB move, which it uses against a variety of Pokemon, like Breloom, Machamp, Swampert, and Gliscor. U-turn makes Uxie a fantastic pivot option, as its large bulk combined with minimal Speed investment allows it to take a hit and pivot out to an unscathed teammate. In particular, Uxie can use U-turn against Starmie that spins Stealth Rock away, and then Tyranitar can come in and trap it with Pursuit.</p> <p>Uxie can use Ice Punch to hit Dragonite, Flygon, Gliscor, and even Zapdos harder. It's really weak otherwise, though, so Psychic is generally better. Skarmory can be a thorn in Uxie's side, so Uxie could even use Thunder to hit it super effectively, as well as hit Starmie and Gyarados. Still, Psychic remains the superior choice.</p> <p>If you're using a Relaxed nature, Thunder Wave is not preferred, since it defeats the purpose of going all-in to slow Uxie down. Alternative moves like Knock Off, Yawn, Toxic, and even Heal Bell are suitable. Knock Off allows Uxie to remove a foe's item, which is a rare and extremely useful move in DPP. In particular, removing Bronzong's Macho Brace and Leftovers from the likes of Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Skarmory is fantastic. Yawn can be used in conjunction with U-turn to further strengthen Uxie's role as a pivot, and this pairs very well with Spikes because Yawn consistently forces the opponent to switch their Pokemon. Toxic can be used to more directly cripple foes like Hippowdon and Zapdos, which can ease the matchup versus defensive teams. Heal Bell can be a useful move depending on the team, but this move is more so a decent option because Uxie has some flexibility in its moveset and access to the move is quite rare. The drawback to not using Thunder Wave, however, is Uxie's increased vulnerability to setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Calm Mind Jirachi.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs are used to maximize Uxie's general bulk. 24 EVs in Special Defense allow Uxie to always survive a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor from Modest Latias and also switch into Stealth Rock once. 16 EVs in Speed enable Uxie to outpace maximum Speed Adamant Scizor so it can use U-turn before its Bug Bite or even after its Bullet Punch and allow a teammate to freely switch in. The remaining 216 EVs are poured into Defense, which is useful for taking on Tyranitar and strong Fighting-types with Close Combat as well as possible. Leftovers keeps Uxie healthy, since it doesn't use a recovery move. Lum Berry is an interesting alternative to prevent Roserade and even Smeargle from inducing sleep before Stealth Rock is used; it also can cure confusion from Machamp's Dynamic Punch and paralysis from Jirachi's Body Slam. As an alternative, Uxie can have more Speed investment at the expense of Defense EVs depending on its team's demands. Uxie can hit benchmarks to outspeed Pokemon like Breloom, Modest Kingdra and Suicune, Gyarados, Dragonite, fast Taunt Heatran, and even Modest Zapdos and Timid Rotom-A.</p> <p>Uxie can opt for a Relaxed nature coupled with 0 Speed IVs to take as much advantage of a slower U-turn as possible and even slightly increase U-turn's damage output. With this investment, Uxie's Speed is just 175, barely underspeeding uninvested base 70 Speed Pokemon like Skarmory, Metagross, and Breloom; it will notably underspeed Tyranitar much more often, as many Tyranitar sets try to Speed creep Skarmory. This means it can take Metagross's Meteor Mash or Tyranitar's Crunch before it uses U-turn, which can be very helpful for teams with trappers like Dugtrio and Magnezone. With a Colbur Berry equipped, Uxie can reliably take any attack Tyranitar wants to throw at it and use a slower U-turn to get Dugtrio in safely; as an added bonus, U-turn's increased damage output enables it to do just enough damage to guarantee Dugtrio a KO versus Tyranitar. In addition, Machamp's Payback and Bronzong's Gyro Ball are significantly weakened, meaning Uxie can check them quite effectively and force them to either switch or, in Bronzong's case, use Explosion. This does come with some drawbacks, however, as Relaxed Uxie is weaker to Choice Band Swampert and Substitute Breloom. Swampert can threaten to make Uxie flinch with Waterfall, and Breloom can use Substitute before Uxie can hit it, meaning it can catch Uxie on a bad U-turn. If opting for this alternative setup, shift the 16 EVs in Speed back into Defense.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Uxie can do something productive in almost all lead matchups, so try to come up with a plan for each scenario. If facing Azelf, it may be smart to use U-turn on the predicted Taunt. Try to get Stealth Rock up on the first turn as much as possible, especially against Pokemon like Metagross and Machamp, as both may make it difficult via Explosion or Dynamic Punch. Use Thunder Wave to cripple foes like Tyranitar, Rotom, Skarmory, and Jirachi; by doing so, Uxie can actively support Pokemon like Swampert, Breloom, Machamp, and Tyranitar. Take advantage of Uxie's lower Speed by using U-turn to enable teammates to come in safely. Keeping Uxie healthy can allow you to use its utility late-game, which can be useful for taking on Fighting-types or setting up Stealth Rock after Starmie has used Rapid Spin. Although it's usually used as a lead, Uxie can support its team just as effectively while not acting as the lead. It's used as a lead much more often simply because its traits are sought after for a lead.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Uxie doesn't require much support and it can fit onto a wide variety of teams. Since Uxie can effectively spread paralysis, teammates that take advantage of this are preferred. Choice Band Swampert can take advantage of paralysis and use Waterfall to deal massive damage and make its foes flinch. Machamp can use Dynamic Punch to create a parafusion combination. Breloom, especially a Substitute variant, can take advantage of paralysis. Choice Band Tyranitar appreciates paralysis support because it can enable it to muscle through Skarmory or outspeed potential checks like Gengar and Lucario. Choice Scarf Rotom-A can function well as a revenge killer and spinblocker; it can check Metagross once, which is quite threatening to teams that typically feature Uxie. Because of this, Skarmory or a bulky Water-type like mixed Swampert and Suicune could pair nicely with Uxie. These Pokemon also appreciate the paralysis support that Uxie provides. Magnezone could be useful to circumvent Uxie's vulnerability to Skarmory and Scizor, trapping and removing both foes. Wish users like Latias, Jirachi, and Clefable can help to increase Uxie's longevity, as Uxie's bulk enables it to receive Wish quite well. If using a Relaxed nature, Dugtrio is a great teammate to take advantage of Uxie's slower U-turn on most Tyranitar variants. Pokemon that appreciate Hippowdon and Bronzong crippled like Flygon, Swords Dance Gliscor, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar pair nicely with Relaxed Uxie.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf Lead",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Due to Uxie's great bulk and decent Speed, it can utilize a Choice Scarf set in order to cripple opposing Pokemon and set up Stealth Rock. Uxie can generally last long enough during a battle to set up Stealth Rock again if it gets removed, while still being capable of weakening the opposing team. Trick cripples the opposing lead by swapping its item with a hindering Choice Scarf, locking it into either Stealth Rock or an attacking move. U-turn lets Uxie switch out and break Aerodactyl's and Azelf's Focus Sash at the same time if they decide to Taunt it, and also enables Uxie to function as a reliable pivot. Uxie can use Thunder Wave to cripple the Tricked Pokemon or an incoming foe. Thunder Wave is also useful to cripple Dragon Dance sweepers like Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Gyarados, as well as Swords Dance Lucario and Jirachi.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The listed Speed EVs allow Choice Scarf Uxie to outspeed Aerodactyl and Azelf and Trick them before they can Taunt Uxie. The rest of the EVs are poured into HP for maximum general bulk, and Defense to take on Tyranitar as well as possible. An Impish nature enables Uxie to often survive Tyranitar's Pursuit as it switches out, although it needs to be decently healthy.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>After crippling a foe with Trick, you have two choices; setting up Stealth Rock helps by slowly chipping away at the opposing team, while using U-turn after Trick lets Uxie switch after seeing what the opponent brings in. Choice Scarf Uxie lures in Tyranitar very often, so you should plan ahead and not use Trick if you suspect your opponent has a Choice item Tyranitar. Keeping your Choice Scarf can be useful mid-game to cripple setup sweepers with either Trick or Thunder Wave; in particular, Swords Dance Lucario won't be able to remove Uxie with Extreme Speed at +2, so it can be crippled for a teammate to revenge kill.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Uxie is bad against entry hazard users, such as Skarmory and Forretress, because they can freely set up entry hazards against Uxie due to its inability to dish out much damage. Therefore, a Rapid Spinner is a good teammate to remove those entry hazards. Forretress resists Ghost- and Dark-type moves, while Starmie is a splendid Rapid Spinner as it can scare away Spikes users with its powerful STAB moves. Although it lacks Rapid Spin, Heatran is great at destroying most entry hazard users due to its impressive typing and raw power. Magnezone can also serve to trap and remove Skarmory and Forretress, reducing the necessity for a spinner when using Uxie.</p> <p>Any setup sweeper that takes advantage of a bad locked move is a good teammate, there are certain Pokemon that can capitalize on that switch. Machamp appreciates Uxie's ability to both Trick a Choice Scarf to a foe and also spread paralysis, as it can set up a Substitute and immediately wreak havoc against the opposing team. Dragon Dance Dragonite, Gyarados, and Tyranitar, as well as Swords Dance Lucario, all appreciate Uxie's Thunder Wave and Trick support.</p> "

        "name": "Dual Screens",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Although Azelf seems better suited for this task due to its greater Speed and access to Explosion, Uxie can still set up Light Screen and Reflect well since it possesses much more bulk. This extra bulk allows Uxie to come in frequently throughout a match. Stealth Rock aids Uxie's teammates in sweeping, while U-turn can help scout your opponent's switches. Alternatively, Memento be used to sharply reduce a foe's Attack and Special Attack; a setup sweeper can then come in and take advantage of this.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EVs allow Uxie to outspeed Roserade and other base 90s in order to get off another move before it takes a hit. Being slower than Gliscor also means that Uxie can U-turn out after Gliscor uses Taunt, which allows your next Pokemon to freely set up. Alternatively, an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe can be used in order to at least Speed tie with opposing Gliscor and set up another defensive screen.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Based on the lead match-up, Reflect should be used against physical attackers, while Light Screen should be employed against special attackers. Uxie's Speed should also not be forgotten, as if EVed properly, it can still outspeed base 90 Pokemon. Use Memento only when you've determined that Uxie won't be useful later on.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Uxie often draws in entry hazard users because it can't do much back to them. Heatran and Starmie both deter entry hazard users in their own ways: Heatran has powerful STAB attacks while Starmie can Rapid Spin away any entry hazards. Additionally, Heatran has good defensive synergy with Uxie because it resists all of Uxie's weaknesses.</p> <p>This type of Uxie is better suited for offensive teams because of the momentum it provides with dual screens and U-turn. Many opposing teams rely on powerful moves to take down Pokemon like Suicune and Dragonite, but with the reduced damage that they take thanks to dual screens, these Pokemon can set up additional boosting moves and proceed to sweep the opposing team. Alternatively, Machamp is a good partner because its Substitutes can survive more hits and let it wreck the opposing team easier. Additionally, Machamp resists two of Uxie's weaknesses: Dark and Bug.</p> "

  "Mesprit": {
    "overview": "<p>BoltBeam and Psychic provide outstanding type coverage, allowing Mesprit to check some of the biggest threats in OU. High defensive stats allow it to take powerful hits, while above average offensive stats allow Mesprit to deal back decent amounts of damage. Mesprit is able to deal with threats such as Gyarados, Dragonite, Flygon, and Infernape with its great type coverage. Mesprit's only major downfall is the lack of a reliable recovery move outside of Rest. Wish support is always recommended due to Mesprit having to deal with such powerful hits.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mesprit has an amazing movepool; there are many options to consider. Reflect and Light Screen allow Mesprit to support its teammates while weakening attacks aimed at it. Healing Wish is somewhat risky, but allows Mesprit to restore the health of a deadly sweeper, which opponents may be unable to handle a second assault from. This move may be tempting but the exchange of Mesprit's life is a big turn off. Magic Coat can cripple opponents that try to status Mesprit, which is helpful in OU as many Vaporeon and Blissey use Toxic. Finally, Grass Knot is usable if you lack a way to remove Swampert, but this limits Mesprit's type coverage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Pokemon that resist the BoltBeam combination or take little damage from any specially based attack are great counters to Mesprit. Blissey is every special Pokemon's worst nightmare. With her mammoth HP stat and great Special Defense, she is able to wall Mesprit all day with no problem. Blissey is also able to weaken Mesprit with Seismic Toss as it is unable to recover its health without Rest.</p> <p>Magnezone is another great option as it takes minor damage from Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Psychic, while it is able to hit Mesprit with a STAB Thunderbolt or take most of Mesprit's health with Explosion.</p> <p>Tyranitar makes an excellent counter to Mesprit as it has an immunity to Mesprit's STAB Psychic, and it also takes a small amount of damage from the BoltBeam combination thanks to the Special Defense boost that sandstorm provides. Choice Band Tyranitar is able to OHKO Mesprit with Crunch 100% of the time, while Pursuit will also OHKO if Mesprit tries to escape.</p> <p>Scizor makes another fine option as it takes little damage from Psychic or Ice Beam, while Thunderbolt only 4HKOes a Choice Band variant. U-turn will always OHKO Mesprit when Scizor is holding a Choice Band and Mesprit has taken damage from Stealth Rock. Scizor also has access to Pursuit in case Mesprit tries to switch.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set is designed to KO dangerous OU sweepers such as Gyarados, Dragonite, and Infernape. Even without Special Attack EVs Mesprit is able to OHKO all 4 HP / 0 SpD Gyarados with Thunderbolt after Stealth Rock damage, all offensive Dragonite and Flygon with Ice Beam, and all Naive Infernape with Psychic. The EVs ensure that you never get KOed by these threats in return.</p> <p>Thunder Wave is the best option in the final slot as it gives Mesprit the chance to cripple faster sweepers and KO them on the following turn. Stealth Rock is another useful option, as it allows Mesprit to score an OHKO on Gyarados when it decides to switch in, and it also renders any Focus Sashes useless. U-turn allows Mesprit to escape an oncoming Tyranitar or Scizor before they are able to severely damage it with Pursuit.</p> <p>The EVs on this set are specialized to take hits as well as possible. Max HP is vital as it allows Mesprit to survive even boosted assaults from the most powerful OU sweepers. 180 Defense EVs ensure that Mesprit survives a +2 offensive Gyarados's Waterfall 100% of the time, and it also allows Mesprit to survive a +1 Outrage from Dragon Dance Dragonite. 76 EVs in Special Defense allow Mesprit to survive a standard Life Orb Gengar's Shadow Ball most of the time. This is shown in the damage calculations below, along with more OU threats included.</p> <ul> <li>+2 252 Atk Adamant Gyarados + Life Orb Waterfall vs 252 HP / 180 Def = 73% - 87% <li>252 SpA Timid Gengar + Life Orb Shadow Ball vs 252 HP / 76 SpD = 84% - 99%</li> <li>252 Atk Adamant Machamp + Leftovers Payback vs 252 HP / 180 Def = 49% - 58%</li> <li>252 Atk Jolly Flygon + Choice Scarf Outrage vs 252 HP / 180 Def = 33% - 40%</li> </ul> <p>Stealth Rock support is helpful if Mesprit decides to not run it. Forretress makes a fine choice as it is able to switch in against Bug-, Ghost-, and Dark-type moves, while it is also able to remove entry hazards from Mesprit's side of the field. Stealth Rock is necessary to OHKO Gyarados after it switches in.</p> <p>Support from Wish is a massive help to Mesprit as it is unable to restore its health outside of Leftovers and Rest. Vaporeon is a great choice to do this as it has a huge HP stat and decent defenses. Blissey is another fine choice as she can switch in on Ghost-type moves with an immunity and threaten them with Thunder Wave. Mesprit and Blissey are a great defensive combination as they are able to switch in on each other's weaknesses. For example, Mesprit is able to switch in on Fighting-type moves that Blissey cannot handle.</p> <p>With the removal of Gyarados, Dragonite, and Gengar, Fighting-types such as Lucario and Infernape are able to set up without the fear of being KOed. After a boost from Swords Dance, Lucario will be almost unstoppable. Threats such as Tyranitar, Scizor, and Weavile will all be OHKOed by Close Combat and Crunch. Infernape is a great option as it can deal serious damage both physically and specially, allowing it to defeat Rotom-A with Fire Blast, Swampert with Grass Knot, and Blissey with Close Combat. Magnezone is another option as it can switch into Scizor's Bullet Punch and trap it with Magnet Pull. Magnezone can then take out Scizor with Hidden Power Fire or damage it with Thunderbolt.</p> "

This set retains the ability to remove Gyarados, Dragonite, and Infernape with little trouble, while also allowing Mesprit to set up Trick Room and support slower members of its team. Thunder Wave isn't an option on this set as it will make the opponent slower than you, allowing them to outspeed Mesprit in Trick Room conditions.</p> <p>Trick Room allows Mesprit to support slow teammates. Thunderbolt and Ice Beam create the BoltBeam combination, giving great type coverage and being resisted by only Magnezone in OU. If Infernape or Gengar cause problems to your team, Psychic is the better option. U-turn allows Mesprit to escape the battle and scout oncoming attacks, as well as potentially bringing in a sweeper unharmed.</p> <p>The EVs on this set are the same as the above as they allow Mesprit to survive powerful boosted hits while being able to set up Trick Room for teammates. If you decide to use U-turn over Psychic, an alternative spread is recommended. 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Timid nature allows Mesprit to move after most opponents, allowing the switch-in to come in unharmed.</p> <p>Wish support is helpful here as it allows Mesprit to switch in and set up Trick Room multiple times. Vaporeon is a great teammate for this as it can switch in on Water-type moves with an immunity and support the team with Wish. Its low Speed is helpful too as it allows you to use Wish before taking a hit.</p> <p>As this set is designed for Trick Room, slow and powerful teammates are recommended. Metagross, Snorlax, and Magnezone make great choices as they all pose a significant threat in the OU tier. Metagross is able to rip holes in the opponent's team with its STAB-boosted Meteor Mash and powerful Explosion. Snorlax is a great tank for Trick Room teams as it can set up Curse and batter the opponent with boosted Body Slam and Crunch. Magnezone, on the other hand, attacks from the special side. If Blissey decides to come in and wall you, Magnezone is free to use Explosion in her face.</p> <p>Steel-types are good partners as they can switch in on Dark- and Bug-type moves aimed at Mesprit. Magnezone makes an excellent teammate with its typing and good defensive stats. A huge Special Attack stat will allow it to switch in on resisted moves and force its way through your opponent's team with STAB Thunderbolt. Magnezone also has the bonus of Magnet Pull, allowing it to trap Scizor and OHKO it with Hidden Power Fire.</p> "

  "Azelf": {
    "overview": "<p>One of the more iconic features of DPP OU is the lead metagame, and Azelf stands as one of the best candidates to get early momentum. Azelf’s varied movepool, high base 115 Speed, strong offensive stats, and underrated bulk allow it to prevent Stealth Rock with Taunt, set up one’s own Stealth Rock, and open up a hole with Explosion. These properties cement Azelf as a staple of hyper offensive teams. Azelf’s bulk is not to be underestimated—with investment, Azelf can survive many strong attacks in the lead position, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar’s Crunch + sand damage, Metagross’s Meteor Mash + Bullet Punch, and Machamp’s Payback + Bullet Punch that could invalidate frailer Azelf. Azelf also can lean into more immediately offensive sets with Choice Band and Life Orb, taking advantage of its high Speed and strong Explosion.</p> <p>Azelf’s primary flaws lie in its mediocre Psychic-typing and how the metagame has adapted to it. Despite Azelf’s fantastic offensive stats, Nasty Plot, and many coverage options, sweeping Azelf sets are ineffective and easily revenge killed. Azelf needs Psychic to break through bulky foes such as Rotom-A and Clefable, but it is resisted by many dangerous threats in the tier, such as Jirachi, Tyranitar, and Heatran. Azelf is the benchmark for successful leads; many leads are chosen for how they perform against Azelf. These include faster leads that try to get Stealth Rock up before Taunt such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Aerodactyl; extremely powerful leads that overwhelm it such as Dragonite, Gyarados, Heatran, and Choice Specs Latias; or leads they try to disable it such as Jirachi’s Body Slam + Iron Head combo, Choice Scarf Breloom's Spore, and Choice Scarf + Trick Uxie. Azelf also requires planning against offensive leads that could carry Stealth Rock—leads such as Metagross, Empoleon, Swampert, Heatran, and Bronzong can heavily damage Azelf if it chooses to Taunt to prevent Stealth Rock rather than just get its own Stealth Rock up and use Explosion. What to do in each situation depends on how weak the team is to Stealth Rock and how much bulk Azelf has.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Azelf is effective in setting up the team with Dual Screens; however, it is almost completely outclassed by Uxie with the exception of Explosion and Taunt. Taunt does allow Azelf to more successfully set up Gyarados and Dragonite, however. Azelf also can use a full offensive set in the lead position with Psychic, Fire Blast, Explosion, and Stealth Rock or possible other coverage moves such as Grass Knot, Hidden Power Fighting, or Hidden Power Ground while holding a Life Orb. Such a set tries to combine the standard lead and Choice Band by aiming to KO opposing leads and use its offensive pressure to set up Stealth Rock. Azelf also can try sweeping with Nasty Plot alongside Flamethrower, Psychic, and Hidden Power Fighting, Grass Knot, or Hidden Power Ground. These sets can also hold other items, such as Colbur Berry to help with Tyranitar and Lum Berry for general status. While threatening, most offensive teams can revenge kill these fairly easily. Defensive teams are more threatened due to its coverage options, but Azelf will eventually be forced to use Explosion because of residual damage. Stealth Rock Azelf doesn’t have to be in the lead position—another more threatening lead such as Dragonite or Gyarados can lead so that Azelf can set up Stealth Rock afterwards. Choice Scarf Azelf is an extremely fast revenge killer and can set up Stealth Rock guaranteed on faster leads such as Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Jirachi, and Choice Scarf Roserade; however it struggles with easily being Pursuit trapped by Tyranitar as well as lack of general power. It also is generally outclassed by Trick + Choice Scarf Uxie.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Tyranitar, especially Choice Scarf variants, and Weavile are the strongest Azelf counters in the game. Their Crunch and Night Slash respectively can easily dispatch Azelf, while Pursuit does a lot of damage on the switch out. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can also use Stealth Rock before Azelf can Taunt it, defeating its purpose. However, Tyranitar needs to be careful, as Azelf is commonly EVed to survive Crunch + sand and either paralyze it or use Explosion. Weavile easily dispatches all Azelf that don't carry a Colbur Berry. Azelf can threaten these with the rare Hidden Power Fighting. While rare, Spiritomb is immune to both Explosion and Psychic and can checkmate Azelf with the combation of Pursuit and Sucker Punch</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats Azelf cannot set up Stealth Rock effectively against faster Taunt users such as Aerodactyl or certain Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Jirachi and Roserade. However, the rest of Azelf's team often can take advantage of the free switch from Azelf's U-turn on Aerodactyl or Roserade and Jirachi's Choice lock.</p> <p><strong>Very Strong Sttackers</strong> Even with investment, Azelf has no hope to survive certain strong attacks, such as Choice Specs Heatran's Overheat, Choice Specs Latias's Draco Meteor, and Choice Band Dragonite's Outrage. Without a Focus Sash, Azelf will just be able to set up Stealth Rock. Choice Specs Starmie will commonly KO non very specially bulky Azelf and outspeed it, preventing even Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types Both Gengar and Rotom-A are immune to Azelf's most common attacking move in Explosion and easily OHKO it with Shadow Ball. Since few Azelf run maximum Speed, Gengar will most likely outspeed it. Both do not enjoy paralysis and get hit hard by Psychic, however.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types Metagross, Bronzong, Empoleon, Jirachi, Forretress, Scizor, and Skarmory often will prevent Azelf lacking Fire Blast to do anything besides use Explosion after it sets up Stealth Rock, while Heatran walls Azelf. Choice Scarf Scizor can even OHKO it with U-turn before it does anything. However, all of these besides physically bulky Skarmory and Jirachi need to be careful of Choice Band Explosion, as it will KO them.</p> <p><strong>Status Choice Scarf Breloom and Roserade prevent Azelf without a Lum Berry from doing anything at all by sleeping it. Even with a Lum Berry, status leads such as Body Slam Jirachi and Trick + Choice Scarf Uxie will paralyze Azelf and attempt to flinch it down in Jirachi's case or prevent it from doing anything at all with Uxie.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Pokemon Azelf is a frail Psychic-type Pokemon, and as such, all offensive sets without a Colbur Berry and bulk investment are easily revenge killed by every Choice Scarf Pokemon in the tier, such as Tyranitar, Flygon, Latias, Rotom-A, and Heatran.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Standard Lead",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Azelf is one of the premier Stealth Rock setters in the metagame due to its Speed. Once Azelf has set up Stealth Rock, Azelf's Explosion has two functions: it heavily damages every non Ghost-type and lets in another threat to immediately gain momentum as a free switch. Explosion also OHKOes every Rapid Spinner in the game besides Forretress, which can not Rapid Spin Stealth Rock away due to being slower. Even an Explosion on resisted targets such as Metagross, Bronzong, or Heatran can open up the opposing team. Another main Azelf role is Taunt, which helps keep Stealth Rock and other hazards off the field as well as preventing set up from leads like Gyarados and Dragonite.</p> <p>As Stealth Rock, Taunt, and Explosion make up Azelf's main niche as a lead, the last slot is more flexible. One great option is Thunder Wave, as Azelf can spread paralysis effectively instead using Explosion immediately. Common scenarios to use Thunder Wave include against Ghost-type Pokemon such as Rotom-A and Gengar coming in to block Explosion and paralyzing common defensive Pokemon resistant to Explosion such as Jirachi and Choice Scarf Tyranitar. U-turn is another useful move from the lead position, as it allows it to break opposing Focus Sash and scout out opposing Steel-types, Ghost-types, and Tyranitar trying to Pursuit trap it. Fire Blast directly threaten Steel-types such as Metagross, Skarmory, Jirachi, and Forretress. Make sure to use a Timid nature if using Fire Blast, as Azelf's Explosion is still strong even with a hindering nature.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Azelf has a myriad of different EV spreads to adapt to the metagame. This particular EV spread gives Azelf the ability to survive Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Crunch while also outspeeding positive nature maximum Speed Jirachi, Zapdos, and Flygon. This spread prevents Azelf from fainting to almost all common attacks in the metagame without a Focus Sash, allowing it to use Explosion after it sets up Stealth Rock. Azelf can run many different items as well. Lum Berry prevents lead Breloom, Jirachi and Uxie from statusing Azelf, while also preventing Machamp's confusion. Sitrus Berry's 25% heal gives Azelf some flexibility in EVs, allowing it to survive various priority such as from Machamp and Metagross as well as Tyranitar's sand from KOing Azelf after a strong hit. Colbur Berry allows Azelf to survive the strong Dark-type attacks from Tyranitar and Machamp that often prevent Azelf from doing anything beyond setting up Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Other EV spreads are viable—note all of these have a Jolly nature: these include outspeeding the positive nature base 90 Speed benchmark such as 228 HP / 216 Def / 8 SpD / 56 Spe that survives Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Crunch + Sand damage and Roserade's Leaf Storm, 252 HP / 56 Def / 64 SpD / 136 Spe outspeeds up to positive nature base 100 Speed Pokemon as well as survive Machamp's Payback and Modest Zapdos's Choice Specs Thunderbolt, 44 HP / 248 Def / 216 Spe that outspeeds Gengar and gives the maximum chance to survive Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Crunch, and 8 Hp / 248 SpD / 252 Spe with a Colbur Berry that survives various Dark type attacks and Metagross's Meteor Mash and has maximum Speed. Azelf can also use a Focus Sash with no bulk; however, Focus Sash leads Azelf to be vulnerable to offensive leads with priority moves such as Metagross's Metoer Mash + Bullet Punch, Empoleon's Hydro Pump + Aqua Jet, and Machamp's Payback + Bullet Punch while also being vulnerable to Tyranitar's sand, giving it only one turn to do anything.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Azelf is primarily used as a lead: it sets up Stealth Rock, prevents set up with Taunt, and then uses Explosion. How aggressive to be with Taunt to prevent set up largely depends on how weak to Stealth Rock and other hazards the rest of Azelf's team is, Azelf's bulk, and how threatening the opposing lead is to the rest of the team. Hyper offense teams with Dragonite, Gyarados, and Zapdos struggle when they lose a quarter of their health to Stealth Rock, so Azelf should aim to Taunt potential Stealth Rock users aggressively, even potentially forgoing Stealth Rock or Explosion. However, bulky Azelf sets can be more forgiving should the opposing lead attack instead of setting up—as an example, physically bulky Azelf can comfortably Taunt + Stealth Rock on Metagross as Meteor Mash + Bullet Punch will not KO, but less bulky Azelf are much more at risk. Beware of opponents taking advantage of Taunt and switching to a Choice Scarf Tyranitar and preventing Stealth Rock. Explosion is often very predictable from Azelf, so mixing up the timing of the Explosion such as using Thunder Wave or U-turn on a Ghost-type switch in can often lead to large payoffs. Fire Blast is often unexpected from Azelf, so hiding it often allows Azelf to do a lot of damage to bulky Fire-weak Pokemon such as Metagross and Forretress.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Azelf is a cornerstone of the hyper offense play style in DPP OU—common teammates on these types of teams include Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Dragonite, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Agility Metagross, Swords Dance Lucario, Swords Dance Scizor, and Swords Dance Empoleon. Azelf immediately gets these threats Stealth Rock and a free switch to start setting up. This setup is especially crucial for Gyarados and Dragonite, as it prevents them from having to deal with Stealth Rock. Azelf's Explosion also commonly targets Steel-types, meaning Dragonite has fewer Dragon-type resists it needs to punch through. Azelf also is great for offensive paralysis teams, as it is effective at spreading paralysis on hard to paralyze threats such as Rotom-A and Gengar. Common teammates include Jirachi, Machamp, Tyranitar, Breloom, Gyarados, Dragonite, and Latias. Jirachi is particularly effective: Jirachi's Iron Head is not only an effective tool at flinching down paralyzed threats, but mixed Jirachi is very good at breaking threats hard to handle for hyper offense, such as Skarmory and Gyarados with Thunderbolt, Swampert with Grass Knot, and Lucario with Hidden Power Ground or Fire Punch. Jirachi and Latias can also use Healing Wish to open up another attempt from a sweeper such as Gyarados.</p> <p>Azelf often immediately attracts in Tyranitar to remove it, and as such, can help Gengar, Calm Mind Jirachi, Zapdos, and Latias break past it once it paralyzes Tyranitar or uses Explosion. Zapdos also benefits from Azelf's ability to prevent Stealth Rock. Azelf's ability to prevent Toxic Spikes in the short term against Roserade and Nidoqueen is critical for Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar and offensive Calm Mind Suicune. Azelf can also support teams built around Explosion, such as with Magnezone, Metagross, and even Choice Scarf + Copycat Lucario. Magnet Rise Magnezone works well with Azelf with U-turn, as Bronzong and Metagross will never Earthquake into Azelf while Skarmory gives easy entry, allowing Magnezone to trap these Pokemon. Magnezone also traps Choice Scarf Jirachi using Iron Head. Most offensive Pokemon in the tier can pair well with a free switch and Stealth Rock; good teammates can help to mitigate various matchups for hyper offense teams.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Choice Band Azelf takes a different approach than the standard lead: it doesn't set up Stealth Rock and just immediately threatens the opponent with Explosion or a strong U-turn. Azelf's Explosion is among the strongest in the game—even many Explosion resistances have a high likelihood to be KOed, such as Metagross, Bronzong, Tyranitar, and non physically bulky variants of Jirachi and Skarmory. This prevents Stealth Rock from going up while also taking out a threat. Choice Band also gives Azelf a very strong U-turn, having a chance to OHKO non physically bulky Azelf, OHKOing bulkess Latias and Starmie after Stealth Rock, and 2HKOing Tyranitar. It also does respectable chip damage to most threats, especially helpful should Azelf want to save its Explosion for later in the game.</p> <p>Zen Headbutt is strong physical Psychic-type move that OHKOes Machamp while being the strongest non Explosion move. As an alternative, Sleep Talk makes Azelf a great switch in to Breloom's Spore, as any of the moves Sleep Talk calls will do a lot of damage to it. Trick is the main final option, as it can shut down walls such as Rotom-A, Hippowdon, and Swampert. Ice Punch is another option that OHKOes all Dragonite without a Yache Berry and is favorable to OHKO bulkless Zapdos. Azelf has access to other elemental punches; however, Explosion outdamages all other options even when resisted.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Azelf has some options on EV spread, but it should mostly always be running Adamant maximum Attack and max Speed. Choice Band Azelf's primary niche is its nuclear Explosion and fast Speed, and an Adamant nature emphasizes that. Reducing that power makes Azelf less likely to OHKO Pokemon that resist Explosion that can set up Stealth Rock, such as Metagross, Bronzong, and Heatran. As an example, Adamant Azelf has a 68.8% chance to OHKO maximum HP Metagross with Explosion, but a Jolly nature only has a 18.8% chance. However, Azelf without any investment is quite frail—Azelf can be made more bulky by using 8 HP / 252 Atk / 112 SpD / 136 Spe with a Jolly nature. This allows Azelf to survive Life Orb Starmie Hydro Pump while maintaining a lot of power. Another choice is make Azelf even more bulky with 8 HP / 224 Atk / 228 SpD / 56 Spe with a Jolly nature that survives Choice Specs Starmie Hydro Pump while still outspeeding Roserade. This spread still OHKOes Heatran and non physically bulky Bronzong, but only has a 6.3% chance to OHKO maximum HP Metagross with Explosion.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Band Azelf most often will lead and use Explosion on the first turn. This can often surprise the opponent once their Metagross, Bronzong, or Heatran is KOed, as the standard lead is far more common so they will almost assuredly stay in and attack. U-turn and Azelf's other coverage should be used if one predicts a Ghost-type switch or they are super effective. Beware of locking into Zen Headbutt and Ice Punch, as much of the tier take little damage and Tyranitar can easily Pursuit trap Azelf. While using Trick on a wall will weaken Explosion, Azelf's Explosion will still OHKO almost anything that doesn't resist it even without a Choice Band. If Azelf stays alive in the midgame and has Sleep Talk, switching it into Spore or other sleep inducing moves is advised, as after the lead sequence, Azelf's lack of bulk makes it difficult to switch in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Band Azelf is self-sufficient as an anti-lead designed to bait and remove bulky Steel types and Tyranitar with Explosion. As such, sweepers that appreciate no Stealth Rock are advised, such as Gyarados and Dragonite. Since this Azelf cannot set up Stealth Rock, another user such as Uxie, Heatran, Tyranitar, Bronzong, Metagross, and Jirachi is needed. Pokemon that are good in one-on-one situations, such as Metagross are quite good alongside Azelf, as Azelf often leads to a free switch for both players after it uses Explosion. Azelf also appreciates another U-turn user that can continue its chain, such as Scizor and Flygon. This Azelf is more conducive to teams built around using Explosion, so other common users such as Bronzong, Metagross, Magnezone, Heatran, Gengar, Camerupt, and Choice Scarf + Copycat Lucario are appreciated. Heatran is perhaps the best partner, as Azelf can heavily damage or KO Tyranitar with U-turn or Explosion, meaning offensive teams have less switch ins to Heatran's Fire-type attacks. Other than these, this Azelf fits on standard hyper offense teams. As such, partners such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Swords Dance Empoleon, Dragonite and Gyarados are good partners.</p> <p>Other good partners are specially offensive hyper offense teams focused on removing Tyranitar as soon as possible. Good partners include Heatran, various Calm Mind users such as Jirachi, Suicune, and Latias, and weather dependent sweepers like Kingdra. Machamp also appreciates bulky Steel-type neutral to Fighting heavily weakened or removed, potentially Rotom-A holding a Choice Band due to Trick, and is also a great one-on-one Pokemon. Take care to use this sets unique advantages over the standard lead (eliminating Stealth Rock users instead of preventing it, strong U-turn, Trick) in mind when choosing teammates.</p> "

        "name": "Utility Rain Lead",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Azelf can lean more into its support role by setting up Rain Dance and Stealth Rock for the team. Azelf is indistinguishable from the standard lead until it reveals Rain Dance or Damp Rock, so it can effectively set up Stealth Rock with its Speed. Rain Dance is the key to the set, as after Azelf sets up Stealth Rock and Rain Dance, it gives rain sweepers 8 turns to run through the opposing team. While it faces heavy competition for the role from Uxie, Azelf has several key advantages: it is naturally much faster, making opponents less likely to Taunt it; it has Taunt itself to prevent hazards from more defensive leads such as Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Nidoqueen Uxie struggles with; and has Explosion to open up Tyranitar or other threats to rain on the opposing team. Taunt also helps to prevent status, Protect to stall rain turns, and opposing set up before the rain sweeper hits the field. Azelf can also use U-turn instead should the team value Azelf to set up rain later in the game. Explosion can weaken an annoying threat such as Tyranitar or Skarmory and gives a free switch to a rain sweeper.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>As Azelf constantly fears being removed by Choice Scarf Tyranitar before getting rain set, it must run a physically bulky set designed to live its Crunch + sand damage. The Speed and Special Defense EVs allow it to outspeed and live Timid Roserade’s Leaf Storm. The physical bulk also makes it survive strong physical attackers such as Metagross’s Meteor Mash + Bullet Punch, Machamp’s Payback + Bullet Punch, and Choice Band Gyarados. Azelf must use Damp Rock to keep rain up for the full 8 turns.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Azelf typically lays Stealth Rock, sets up Rain Dance, and then uses Explosion. However, it can deviate from this game plan against specific leads. As Azelf’s rain sweeping teammates generally aren’t weak to Stealth Rock, using Taunt on potential Stealth Rock users such as Metagross, Empoleon, Heatran, and Bronzong isn’t as necessary. However, against Spikes and Toxic Spikes users such as Skarmory, Roserade, and Nidoqueen, Azelf should Taunt to prevent these hazards from going down. Against extremely powerful leads such as Choice Specs Latias, Choice Specs Heatran, and Tyranitar, Azelf should prioritize getting Rain Dance off, as rain sweepers need that support more than Stealth Rock should Azelf only survive one turn. Azelf’s Explosion is also very predictable after Rain Dance—while it is preferred to use Explosion on a good target, such as Tyranitar trying to reset rain, using Explosion immediately maximizes the turns rain sweepers have to run through the opposing team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rain teams typically are formulaic and follow a general structure of three or four rain sweepers and the remainder support Pokemon. Swift Swim Kingdra is the best rain Pokemon in the tier and is generally required on rain teams. Kingdra has many possible sets it can run, but with Choice Specs, it can 2HKO even soft Water resists such as Gyarados and Dragonite, as well as special walls such as Clefable and Jirachi with a rain boosted Hydro Pump. It also outspeeds every common Choice Scarf user. Kingdra OHKOes most non specially bulky or Passho Berry Tyranitar after Stealth Rock even with the sand boost. After Kingdra, the other most common Swift Swim Pokemon used are Qwilfish and Ludicolo, as they provide other utility. Qwilfish absorbs Toxic Spikes, has a powerful Explosion, can set up Spikes and use Swords Dance, and hits Breloom and other Grass-types hard, while Ludicolo offers a neutrality to Electric-types and has strong Grass-type options for bulky Water resists such as Suicune. Swords Dance Empoleon is an excellent choice as a non Swift Swim sweeper, as it destroys defensive teams that rain sometimes struggles against while taking advantage of boosted Water-type attacks. For support, the standard choice is Bronzong, as it offers a Dragon-type resistance to absorb Latias, Dragonite, and opposing Kingdra while also easily setting up rain multiple times. It can set up Stealth Rock if Azelf is unable to, potentially sleep something with Hypnosis, and 2HKO Tyranitar with Gyro Ball. Another common support is Metagross, as it can lure in Skarmory, Rotom-A, and Zapdos with a Trick + Iron Ball set, or take advantage of rain’s halving of Fire-type attacks to run an Agility set. A Lum Berry also helps against Breloom’s Spore. Rotom-A and Latias with Colbur Berry are other good supporters, as they both resist Electric, weaken Tyranitar, and can set up rain multiple times. Rotom-A is also a great answer to defensive Jirachi, which commonly survives rain boosted attacks and spreads paralysis.</p> <p>Many Pokemon enjoy not having sand active, and as such, are prime candidate for rain teams. The most prominent of these is Suicune, as its Substitute sets give a bulky and strong rain sweeper. Suicune also appreciates Toxic Spikes absorption and offensive Water resists such as Dragonite and Gyarados eliminated. Other more niche choices include Kabutops and Omastar, which are extremely powerful but lack the utility of other rain sweepers, defensive Dragon Dance Dragonite, Cresselia, Raikou, and Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi. To be effective rain support, teammates generally want to lure in and KO weather changers such as Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Abomasnow; sponge hits from Electric-types such as Zapdos and Rotom-A; and help weaken walls such as Skarmory, Jirachi, Latias, Milotic, and Blissey. Rain also struggles against Lucario and Gengar, as the style typically doesn’t run Choice Scarf Pokemon and most of the support give up an easy Swords Dance or can’t absorb Gengar’s attacks. Helpful Pokemon include Magma Storm Heatran, ironically Rain Dance Tyranitar, Swampert, Magnezone, and Machamp.</p> "

  "Shaymin": {
    "overview": "<p>When considering Grass-types, Shaymin is inevitably compared to Celebi. Both are base 100 Grass-types with Natural Cure, and Celebi has the edge in its host of support moves (including Recover). However, Shaymin gives it a run for its money with Seed Flare and a lack of Psychic typing to hold it back. Rounded base 100 stats provide Shaymin with respectable offense, solid bulk, and an important Speed stat, while Natural Cure allows Shaymin to switch out and heal the kinds of status that cripple other sweepers. Despite its movepool being somewhat shallow, Shaymin gets most of the coverage it needs, and has access to Seed Flare, its powerful signature move; Seed Flare's Special Defense drops mean even Blissey must be careful around it. A sturdy sweeper, Shaymin fits well in most Fire/Water/Grass cores, and has the ability to get rid of many of OU's bulky threats, such as Tyranitar, Hippowdon, Rotom-A, bulky Water-types (such as Suicune and Vaporeon), and Gliscor, giving it a useful role in the metagame.</p> <p>However, Scizor, Heatran, and Dragonite, all top threats in OU, give it some trouble, and without the right Hidden Power, it can be set up on easily. Grass as a type has poor coverage in OU because of the prominence of Steel- and Dragon-types, but it also hits the common Water- and Ground-types super effectively, and can easily switch in on Water and Electric moves. Overall, the pros outweigh the cons when using Shaymin, and while it doesn't fit on all teams, it's certainly a threat to be addressed.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shaymin's movepool is very shallow, and the other options it does have are fairly ineffective. As far as support moves go, it's outclassed by Celebi; Shaymin does have a very inaccurate sleep move in Grass Whistle, as well as Aromatherapy, Safeguard, and Healing Wish—not much to write home about. Rest or Leech Seed are generally preferable as filler because they are more useful to Shaymin, but it has access to Energy Ball (for reliable STAB), and several other attacks. Air Slash and Signal Beam don't get any extra coverage, but Air Slash <em>can flinch in a pinch, and Signal Beam demolishes Celebi. Psychic can work on Choice Specs Shaymin to 2HKO Dragonite in lieu of Hidden Power Ice, assuming Stealth Rock, and hits Gengar and Roserade super effectively. It gives Tyranitar and other Psychic-resistant a free switch-in, though.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Although it is Shaymin's best ally, Heatran poses a lot of problems. Shaymin can take it out with Earth Power if Heatran is not carrying Choice Scarf or Shuca Berry, but Heatran can come in on all of its other moves unscathed. Infernape has trouble switching in repeatedly and has to be careful of Earth Power, but it outspeeds Shaymin and has Fire STAB to roast the little hedgehog with. Without Hidden Power Fire, Skarmory, Forretress, and Scizor all take advantage of Shaymin; without Hidden Power Ice, Dragonite completely walls it. Zapdos, particularly Specially Defensive Zapdos, can hit Shaymin with Heat Wave and Roost away damage (being cautious of Earth Power). Without Life Orb, Roserade and Celebi can exploit it, and as Grass-types, they are immune to Leech Seed; however, both are 2HKOed by a Life Orb-boosted, super effective Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>There are a number of Pokemon who can wall Shaymin, but a lot of their defensive strategies will fall apart if their Special Defense drops or Shaymin has Leech Seed. Blissey walls Shaymin and can force it out with Toxic, though it must be careful of the aforementioned problems. Both Cresselia and Blissey can threaten it with Ice Beam, too. Most Blissey generally cannot really harm Shaymin though, and if it stays in on Leech Seed, it becomes Pursuit bait for a number of Pokemon. Snorlax can set up on Shaymin as well, though it loses to Leech Seed.</p> ",

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This is a standard offensive Shaymin set with three attacks and a recovery move. This set troubles bulky teams and has the Speed, bulk, and Special Attack to threaten more offensive teams. Seed Flare is Shaymin's staple STAB move, KOing many bulky Waters and Grounds with Life Orb attached. Hippowdon, offensive Rotom-A, and Water-types like Vaporeon and unboosted CroCune all fall to a single Seed Flare (after Stealth Rock damage). Even Blissey is afraid of switching in on Seed Flare due to the possibility of a harsh Special Defense decrease. Earth Power is on the set to augment coverage, hitting many of the Pokemon who resist Seed Flare super effectively, such as Heatran and Jirachi. The Hidden Power is a matter of preference and team needs; both hit opposing Grass-types and other key threats. Hidden Power Ice allows a 31 Speed IV and wipes out Dragonite and other Flying-types, who otherwise come in on Shaymin with impunity, whereas Hidden Power Fire roasts Skarmory, Scizor, and Forretress. Lastly, one can choose either Rest or Leech Seed to keep Shaymin alive. Rest lets Shaymin abuse Natural Cure for full recovery on the switch, but Leech Seed saps away Blissey and Snorlax's HP, as well as cushioning attacks for the team and negating Life Orb recoil. Synthesis is a viable alternative for instant 50% recovery, but Sand Stream is prevalent in OU, rendering it useless most of the time. For those who prefer survivability over raw power, Leftovers is an excellent item option, although it misses out on KOes.</p> <p>Shaymin works well as part of an offensive Fire/Water/Grass core. This core is useful because their weaknesses and resistances complement each other well, and there are many options for offensive teams. Heatran is the best option for the Fire-type due to its bulk and power. It can run a number of sets and lure Blissey in only to Explode on it. Suicune, Kingdra, and Gyarados all perform wonderfully in the Water-type slot. Kingdra and Gyarados can hit special walls with strong physical attacks (Taunt Gyarados in particular can set up on Blissey and Skarmory, while benefiting from Shaymin's ability to deal with Rotom-A). Suicune has the natural bulk to tank hits from Fire-types, and is particularly useful when you are utilizing Hidden Power Fire, as it makes for a good check to Dragonite. Another option is Starmie, who, while generally useless against Blissey, can wash Skarmory away and use Rapid Spin to rid the field of the opponent's entry hazards. The relationship is mutually beneficial; Shaymin is able to easily take Ground- and Water-type attacks for Heatran, as well as Electric- and Grass-type attacks for the Water-type, while appreciating the resistances that its partners bring to the table.</p> <p>Leech Seed, if used, forces constant switches, so the best way to exploit this is by setting up Spikes to increase residual damage. Forretress and Skarmory are the best Spikes users in OU, but unfortunately share Shaymin's weakness to Fire. Heatran can absorb these attacks with Flash Fire, and Water-types can sponge them. Forretress can Rapid Spin away hazards and set up Toxic Spikes, while Skarmory can Whirlwind to rack up damage. If you use hazards, make sure to pack a spinblocker such as Rotom-A to defend them!</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Leech Seed",
        "description": "<p>This set takes a more defensive approach, prolonging Shaymin's life, supporting its team, and draining the HP of threats like Blissey. Leech Seed Shaymin is better suited to more defensive teams, where the residual damage racks up from Leech Seed and the possibility of Special Defense drops force switches while Shaymin regains its HP continuously from Leftovers and Leech Seed. The player's choice between Protect and Substitute allows Shaymin to stall out the opponent while getting free turns of recovery. Seed Flare is used as a STAB attack, and the fourth moveslot is a choice between several coverage options. It's important to note that this set is highly similar to Leech Seed Celebi, who has more support options like Recover, but lacks Celebi's Dark- and Ghost-type weaknesses, as well as only having a 2x weakness to Bug-type attacks.</p> <p>Protect is the primary option because, despite the HP investment, it is easy enough to break Shaymin's Substitutes, and can be used in a pinch should it have under 25% HP. In this sense, Protect consistently allows Shaymin to abuse Leech Seed. Protect also lets Shaymin scout and guard itself against faster opponents. Substitute is an alternative for blocking status moves like Toxic, as well as offering protection from Trick. Unlike Protect, it allows Shaymin to take advantage of the switch. It is also worth noting that Seismic Toss cannot break 252 HP Shaymin's Substitutes in one turn. Beware of the opponent setting up on your Protects or Substitutes, however! The final moveslot has three options and can be tailored to suit a team's individual needs. Hidden Power Fire gets rid of the Skarmory, Scizor, and Forretress who cause this set a lot of grief, though Hidden Power Ice is acceptable if you find Dragonite plaguing you. Both Hidden Powers hit Grass-types--who are immune to Leech Seed--super effectively. Earth Power is a possibility as well for Heatran and Infernape, and does more damage against grounded Steels like Jirachi.</p> <p>The designated EVs are highly customizable. The spread given has 252 HP to capitalize on Shaymin's natural bulk, and 180 Speed EVs to reach 280 Speed, which allows Shaymin to outspeed Adamant Lucario, +Speed Heatran, and neutral-natured Rotom-A. More EVs can be added for Mamoswine and other Pokemon designed to beat Adamant Lucario, while max Speed is usable for Timid Rotom and Offensive Suicune. Be aware that the Speed number suggested is assuming a 30 Speed IV, so you can deduct 4 EVs from Speed if you are using Hidden Power Ice or Earth Power. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Attack to help Shaymin hit harder, though they can also be invested in Special Defense in order to take Starmie's Ice Beams / Hydro Pumps, random Hidden Powers, and attacks from the likes of Rotom-A better; Shaymin generally switches in on resisted special hits anyway.</p> <p>This Shaymin functions best in a Fire/Water/Grass defensive core, as its weaknesses and resistances neatly complement that of the core. It provides team support in the form of Leech Seed, which cushions blows and increases Shaymin's overall survivability, and is able to beat a number of specific threats (Rotom-A, Hippowdon, Vaporeon, and Swampert, for example). Also, unlike other sets, this Shaymin can consistently trouble most Blissey. If a Fire-type is used, Heatran is again the best option. There is a wide range of possibilities for a Water-type partner: Vaporeon, Swampert, Suicune, and defensive Gyarados work the best. All of the aforementioned Pokemon are excellent at tanking hits and have their own advantages. Swampert has Roar and Stealth Rock, and also carries an Electric immunity (but beware of Electric-types using Hidden Power Grass, though Shaymin walls them in that case bar Zapdos and Rotom-H). Gyarados counters Fighting-types and Scizor effectively with Intimidate and its Flying typing, especially with its natural bulk invested in. Vaporeon and Suicune are both very bulky as well. Vaporeon can support the team with Wish, while Suicune makes for a sturdy set-up sweeper.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice",
        "description": "<p>With this set, Shaymin can utilize one of two items to boost its respective stat. Choice Scarf takes advantage of Shaymin's base 100 Speed to revenge kill most Pokemon in OU (all Heatran, Jirachi, and +1 Dragonite, as well as +2 Adamant Metagross, Empoleon, and Tyranitar). Choice Specs has raw power without Life Orb recoil. For example, Choice Specs Shaymin OHKOes 4 HP Kingdra, Gyarados, Flygon, and all Tyranitar with Seed Flare; it also 2HKOes Celebi and Specially Defensive Skarmory with a super effective Hidden Power, and Scizor with Earth Power (after Stealth Rock damage). Specs decimates switch-ins and Scarf outspeeds the likes of Scarf Heatran expecting to go first, as well as tying with Flygon. Due to Choice items locking the user into one move, this set requires a lot of prediction, but has good payoff. Be careful of letting your opponent set up multiple layers of Spikes or Heatran get a Flash Fire boost. Hidden Power Ice is handiest to revenge kill Dragonite and Flygon, but Hidden Power Fire is still a useful option for those preferring to hit Scizor, Forretress, and Skarmory. Should you get a spare turn, Rest makes for decent filler so that Shaymin can fully recover, but Energy Ball is an option for a clean-up STAB without the accuracy and PP issues of Seed Flare.</p> <p>Timid is the best nature because +Speed base 100s are common in OU. In the case of the Scarfer, Flygon and Jirachi regularly carry Scarf as well, and in the case of Choice Specs, Jirachi, Celebi, and Zapdos are all worth considering, as well as +Speed Lucario and Roserade and +2 Adamant Metagross and Tyranitar. There are other options for the filler moveslot, but all are generally outclassed. Air Slash and Signal Beam let Shaymin hit other Grass-types (such as Celebi) harder, but Hidden Power Ice and Fire both do plenty of damage anyway, especially if you are using Specs.</p> <p>Choice Shaymin's best partners are the usual suspects: Heatran and Water-types. However, because this Shaymin lacks Leech Seed and can't switch moves, it is imperative it has a partner who can beat Blissey. Infernape or Explosion Magnezone and Heatran work well for this. Heatran and Magnezone can both lure and KO Blissey with Explosion, as well as take out Scizor, Skarmory, and Forretress (particularly necessary if Shaymin is sticking with Hidden Power Ice), since a Choice Seed Flare invites the latter two to set up in its wake. Water-types are great partners for Shaymin because of Heatran and company. Suicune, Kingdra, Starmie, and Gyarados are the best options for that.</p> "
