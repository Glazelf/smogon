Tera Psychic is generally preferred to boost the power of Deoxys's Psycho Boost, although Tera Ghost and Tera Fighting can be viable options, with the former boosting the power of Shadow Ball and providing a nifty immunity to Extreme Speed and the latter allowing Deoxys to beat Kingambit and Arceus-Dark. Deoxys fits best on offensive teams looking for a strong and reliable revenge killer and wallbreaker.

Great Tusk is a notable partner; Deoxys deals with Pokemon like Mewtwo, Kyurem-W, and Clefable that Great Tusk potentially struggles with, and in return, Great Tusk deals with Pokemon like Kingambit and Arceus-Fire.

Generally, Deoxys prefers Stealth Rock in the final moveslot, allowing it to nearly guarantee it sets up both Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes, although Taunt can be run instead allowing it to stop Pokemon from setting up or laying their own entry hazards. Focus Sash allows Deoxys to guarantee at least one layer of entry hazards. Tera Psychic boosts Deoxys's Psycho Boost, although Tera Ghost can be run instead, allowing it to spinblock Pokemon like Great Tusk and Cyclizar and block Extreme Speed from Arceus-Fire, which otherwise troubles it. Deoxys fits best on offense and hyper offense teams looking for a dedicated lead that can set up hazards consistently. Offensive threats like Mewtwo, Zacian, and Ogerpon-H appreciate the entry hazards Deoxys sets up to wear down their switch-ins like Arceus-Dark, Solgaleo, and Giratina. Pokemon like Spectrier and Gholdengo that can spinblock are also nice to have.

Tera Poison turns its Fairy, Fighting, and Bug weaknesses into resistances, which is incredible for setting up on Zacian, Magearna, and Zamazenta-C.

Tera Poison lets Arceus-Dark beat setup sweepers that can otherwise force it out like Zacian and Arceus-Fighting. Tera Fairy provides similar resistances as Poison while also providing an extremely useful immunity to Dragon, letting it better check threats like Palkia-O, while not causing a pesky weakness to the Psychic-type moves fired off from Pokemon such as Mewtwo and Deoxys. Arceus-Dark checks Pokemon like Chi-Yu and Kyurem-W, so it pairs well with Pokemon like Zamazenta-C, Mewtwo, Palkia-O and Solgaleo, which struggle against those threats. Physically defensive Pokemon like Great Tusk and Calm Mind Lugia complement Arceus-Dark well; the former can beat many Dark-resistant Pokemon that pressure it like both Urshifu formes while appreciating its ability to check Psychic-types, and the latter checks Fighting-types well and appreciates other setup sweepers being deterred from setting up. Giratina is another good teammate thanks to its typing letting it check sweepers that Arceus-Dark cannot, such as Arceus-Fire and Sneasler; in exchange, Arceus-Dark checks opposing Ghost- and Dark-types such as Spectrier and Chi-Yu and spreads status so Giratina can fire off powerful Hexes.</p>"

Hazard-weak wallbreakers, such as Chi-Yu and Kyurem-W, appreciate Great Tusk removing hazards for them; in exchange, they target the physical walls that Great Tusk loathes. Kyurem-W in particular forms an excellent offensive core with it, being able to offensively pressure its checks such as Giratina and Lugia. Arceus-Dark also makes a good partner for Great Tusk, as it covers Great Tusk's weakness to special attackers while also enjoying hazards being removed. Furthermore, Arceus-Dark pressures the Ghost-types that block Great Tusk's attempts to use Rapid Spin.</p>"
