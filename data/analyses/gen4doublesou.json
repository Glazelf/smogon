With its nigh-unwallable coverage and solid Speed tier, Rotom-A can pressure nearly the entire tier and force opponents into unfavorable damage trades. Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball are powerful STAB attacks that combine to hit the entire tier for at least neutral damage, while a coverage move of choice can better threaten specific foes. Overheat OHKOes Steel-types such as Metagross and Bronzong, and Hydro Pump 2HKOes Heatran and all but the bulkiest Tyranitar, while Leaf Storm OHKOes Swampert. Trick can be used to cripple support Pokemon such as Togekiss or Bronzong, which frees up Rotom-A to make use of its coverage options. Rotom-A's unique set of immunities and resistances allow for solid longevity even on this very offensive set, allowing it to use its powerful attacks without worrying about Fake Out or strong Fighting- and Ground-type moves, such as Heracross's Close Combat or Metagross's Earthquake. Choice Specs Rotom-A acts mostly as a wallbreaker, and it is particularly effective as a lead. Lead Rotom-A leverages its good defensive typing and ability to immediately pressure either of the opposing Pokemon, with Trick giving the additional option to cripple support Pokemon. As a lead, its Ghost typing gives Rotom-A a crucial immunity to Fake Out from Hitmontop and Mew, allowing Rotom-A to throw out strong attacks without the threat of being flinched. Mew in particular doesn't want to stay in on a Shadow Ball. Rotom-A appreciates teammates that can deal with Tyranitar, as it can take most of Rotom-A's attacks well while threatening super effective damage or setting up a Dragon Dance. Metagross and Heracross are good partners that threaten Tyranitar, while Rotom-A checks their counters, such as Gyarados, in return. Rotom-A doesn't appreciate trading with Sucker Punch Hitmontop or Mew, so Intimidate users such as Gyarados and your own Hitmontop make for good teammates.</p> "

Alternatively, Choice Scarf Rotom-A can drop a coverage move for a support move such as Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp and play more of a supportive role, especially after it drops its Choice Scarf with Trick. Choice Scarf Rotom-A is less focused on wallbreaking compared to Choice Specs sets, mostly a more support-oriented Pokemon early- and mid-game or a late-game cleaner. As a cleaner, Rotom-A prefers to lock into either of its STAB moves if possible, as its coverage options are less reliable and harder to spam. Overheat's and Leaf Storm's Special Attack drops greatly reduce Rotom-A's offensive pressure, while Hydro Pump's lower accuracy makes it risky to rely on for consistent damage. If Rotom-A uses a status move instead of a coverage move, then its priority is to lose its Choice Scarf with Trick and follow up with status moves to disrupt the opponent's game plan. As a lead, Choice Scarf Rotom-A can leverage its great Speed tier to get the jump on Pokemon that would normally be faster, such as Latios or Mew. In general, Rotom-A matches up well against common leads such as Metagross and Mew, threatening them with super effective damage. Additionally, more passive lead options such as Bronzong or Hitmontop hate getting a Choice Scarf from Trick. Choice Scarf Rotom-A appreciates partners that threaten Tyranitar such as Gyarados, Metagross, and Heracross, but it is less reliant on them than other Rotom-A sets to create value, as the Choice Scarf set doesn't need to spread consistent damage.

Bulky Rotom-A can drop a status move for Protect to allow for better longevity and easier positioning. Thunder Wave is often more valuable than Will-O-Wisp, as it can take fast threats such as Latios out of the game almost entirely, while the damage reduction and chip damage from Will-O-Wisp may not provide enough value in fast-paced games. Special Defense investment is required to be able to take on Latios's Draco Meteor and opposing Rotom-A's Shadow Ball, letting Rotom-A threaten super effective damage with its own Shadow Ballâ€”physical damage reduction is more readily available through Intimidate and your own Will-O-Wisp. Sitrus Berry is standard, as the burst healing allows Rotom-A to match up better against the tier's strong attackers, although Leftovers can be used to offset sand chip damage and synergize better with Protect. While Rotom-A is able to withstand the strongest attacks in the tier, it doesn't like to take unnecessary damage because it is often a team's defensive glue, so safely bringing Rotom-A onto the field is important. Bulky Rotom-A can be used as a lead, but once the opponent realizes it is a less aggressive set, they can take advantage of Rotom-A's low unboosted damage output. Bulky Rotom-A often trades health for the chance to status a major threat, such as Choice Specs Latios, Choice Scarf Heracross, or Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Rotom-A's low base HP makes it a great user of Pain Split, allowing for another avenue to whittle down foes while increasing longevity. Both mid-tier Speed and fast offensive Pokemon appreciate the speed control Rotom-A can provide. Pokemon such as Gyarados, Heatran, and Metagross love outspeeding threats such as Latios, Latias, or opposing Rotom-A, which would otherwise apply a lot of offensive pressure. Similarly, as teammates, these same fast threats appreciate Thunder Wave slowing down common Choice Scarf users such as Heracross, as well as allowing them to win potential mirror matches.</p> "

Special Defense investment is required to be able to take on Latios's Draco Meteor and opposing Rotom-A's Shadow Ball, letting Rotom-A threaten super effective damage with its own Shadow Ballâ€”physical damage reduction is more readily available through Intimidate and your own Will-O-Wisp. Sitrus Berry is standard, as the burst healing allows Rotom-A to match up better against the tier's strong attackers, although Leftovers can be used to offset sand chip damage and synergize better with Protect. While Rotom-A is able to withstand the strongest attacks in the tier, it doesn't like to take unnecessary damage because it is often a team's defensive glue, so safely bringing Rotom-A onto the field is important. Bulky Rotom-A can be used as a lead, but once the opponent realizes it is a less aggressive set, they can take advantage of Rotom-A's low unboosted damage output. Bulky Rotom-A often trades health for the chance to status a major threat, such as Choice Specs Latios, Choice Scarf Heracross, or Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Rotom-A's low base HP makes it a great user of Pain Split, allowing for another avenue to whittle down foes while increasing longevity. Both mid-tier Speed and fast offensive Pokemon appreciate the speed control Rotom-A can provide. Pokemon such as Gyarados, Heatran, and Metagross love outspeeding threats such as Latios, Latias, or opposing Rotom-A, which would otherwise apply a lot of offensive pressure. Similarly, as teammates, these same fast threats appreciate Thunder Wave slowing down common Choice Scarf users such as Heracross, as well as allowing them to win potential mirror matches.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Clamperl may seem pitiful, but its signature item Deep Sea Tooth doubles its Special Attack and makes it a fearsome attacker with Trick Room support. Clamperl exploits the tier's lack of common Water-resistant foes and can sweep through unprepared teams with its powerful Muddy Water, especially in rain. However, none of Clamperl's other stats get boosted, which makes it the slowest viable Pokemon in the tier and threatened by nearly any attacker. Clamperl is powerful, but its frailty and chance to miss Muddy Water make it an inconsistent performer.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Clamperl can drop a coverage option for Brine, which can eliminate low-HP foes without risking a Muddy Water miss. Clamperl can also run Hidden Power Grass to OHKO Swampert; however, as it already takes significant damage from Muddy Water, it is more important to cover the Gyarados and Empoleon matchups.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-resistant foes: Common Water-resistant foes such as Latios, Latias, and Shaymin all threaten to OHKO Clamperl with their powerful STAB attacks. While Clamperl can deal a lot of damage with Ice Beam, this means that it's not using Muddy Water, which leaves it vulnerable to the other opposing Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Any Attack: Clamperl is so frail that common powerful attacks such as Latios's Psychic will effortlessly OHKO it, while other attacks such as Metagross's Zen Headbutt, Tyranitar's Stone Edge, and many more threaten to at least 2HKO it.</p> ",

Common Water-resistant foes such as Latios, Latias, and Shaymin all move after Clamperl in Trick Room and take significant damage from Ice Beam, while opposing Water-types such as Gyarados and Empoleon must fear Hidden Power Electric. Clamperl needs Protect to defend itself in situations that expose its terrible bulk, such as when foes use Fake Out and whenever Trick Room isn't up. Trick Room is essential to Clamperl's success, as it can clean up late-game or weaken teams throughout the mid-game for another Trick Room attacker to clean up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dusclops is the best Trick Room setter for Clamperl, as it underspeeds Clamperl, meaning it can set up Rain Dance before Clamperl moves in Trick Room. It provides additional support with Helping Hand and can break Focus Sash with its attacking move so Clamperl can pick up more KOs. Bronzong can also provide Trick Room and Rain Dance support.</p> <p>Fellow powerful Trick Room attackers such as Rhyperior and Machamp can also pick up KOs whenever Clamperl misses them. Rhyperior is an especially natural fit, as its Lightning Rod ability keeps Clamperl safe from Electric-type attacks from Raikou and Rotom-A.</p> <p>Raikou is an additional Rain Dance user, and its Electric-type STAB attacks can eliminate common Water-types such as Gyarados and Suicune. Other beneficiaries of rain are fast Swift Swim users such as Kingdra and Ludicolo, which can help weaken teams for Clamperl whenever Trick Room isn't up.</p> "

  "Latios": {
    "overview": "<p>Latios is one of the tier's most prominent special attackers due to its excellent Special Attack, naturally high Speed tier, and powerful STAB attacks in Draco Meteor and Psychic. Latios also gets coverage options with which it can punish common switch-ins, making it difficult to ever truly counter it. It's a flexible attacker with a variety of offensive sets that, thanks to its typing and ability, can also check rain teams and switch into Earthquakes. However, the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor can leave Latios vulnerable to physical-attacking Steel-types, such as Metagross, or a Tyranitar Pursuit trapping it. Latios also offers little to no utility and struggles against opposing speed control, priority moves, and faster Pokemon such as Raikou and Choice Scarf users.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Non-Choice item sets can forgo Electric-type coverage and use Substitute or Tailwind to create favorable positions against opposing Protects, though this makes it easier for opposing Steel-types to switch in, and it must be noted that Tailwind's effects only last two turns in DPP. One could choose Thunder as Electric-type coverage on rain teams for even greater power, but it is inconsistent outside of rain, which Tyranitar can easily stop.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Metagross, Bronzong, and Heatran can all switch into both Draco Meteor and Psychic, and threaten to either deal heavy damage back with their Steel-type move, set up Substitute, or, in the case of Bronzong, set up Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control and Faster Pokemon: Thunder Wave severely cripples Latios's ability to revenge kill slower threats. Latios also struggles against Swift Swim Kingdra under rain as it can OHKO Latios with its faster Draco Meteor. Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Heracross threaten OHKOs with their STAB moves, as does opposing Choice Scarf Latios with its Draco Meteor. Raikou threatens a 2HKO with Shadow Ball. Latios's high Speed also makes it a liability under Trick Room. Lastly, it must worry about Sucker Punch from common users such as Hitmontop and Mew.</p> <p><strong>Sucker Punch: Like with faster Pokemon, Sucker Punch from common users such as Hitmontop and Mew can 2HKO Latios.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar can use Pursuit to trap opposing Latios after it has used Draco Meteor.

Thunderbolt damages Steel- and Water-types such as Empoleon and Gyarados without lowering Latios's Special Attack. Hidden Power Ground deals more damage against Steel-types such as Metagross and Heatran that would otherwise switch into Latios's STAB attacks; however, one could opt into Trick to cripple physical attackers such as Hitmontop or utility Pokemon such as Bronzong and Cresselia.
