    "overview": "<p>Clamperl may seem pitiful, but its signature item Deep Sea Tooth doubles its Special Attack and makes it a fearsome attacker with Trick Room support. Clamperl exploits the tier's lack of common Water-resistant foes and can sweep through unprepared teams with its powerful Muddy Water, especially in rain. However, none of Clamperl's other stats get boosted, which makes it the slowest viable Pokemon in the tier and threatened by nearly any attacker. Clamperl is powerful, but its frailty and chance to miss Muddy Water make it an inconsistent performer.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Clamperl can drop a coverage option for Brine, which can eliminate low-HP foes without risking a Muddy Water miss. Clamperl can also run Hidden Power Grass to OHKO Swampert; however, as it already takes significant damage from Muddy Water, it is more important to cover the Gyarados and Empoleon matchups.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-resistant foes: Common Water-resistant foes such as Latios, Latias, and Shaymin all threaten to OHKO Clamperl with their powerful STAB attacks. While Clamperl can deal a lot of damage with Ice Beam, this means that it's not using Muddy Water, which leaves it vulnerable to the other opposing Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Any Attack: Clamperl is so frail that common powerful attacks such as Latios's Psychic will effortlessly OHKO it, while other attacks such as Metagross's Zen Headbutt, Tyranitar's Stone Edge, and many more threaten to at least 2HKO it.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Clamperl will mostly be using Muddy Water, as there are few Pokemon in the tier that can comfortably take one, especially in rain. Common Water-resistant foes such as Latios, Latias, and Shaymin all move after Clamperl in Trick Room and take significant damage from Ice Beam, while opposing Water-types such as Gyarados and Empoleon must fear Hidden Power Electric. Clamperl needs Protect to defend itself in situations that expose its terrible bulk, such as when foes use Fake Out and whenever Trick Room isn't up. Trick Room is essential to Clamperl's success, as it can clean up late-game or weaken teams throughout the mid-game for another Trick Room attacker to clean up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dusclops is the best Trick Room setter for Clamperl, as it underspeeds Clamperl, meaning it can set up Rain Dance before Clamperl moves in Trick Room. It provides additional support with Helping Hand and can break Focus Sash with its attacking move so Clamperl can pick up more KOs. Bronzong can also provide Trick Room and Rain Dance support.</p> <p>Fellow powerful Trick Room attackers such as Rhyperior and Machamp can also pick up KOs whenever Clamperl misses them. Rhyperior is an especially natural fit, as its Lightning Rod ability keeps Clamperl safe from Electric-type attacks from Raikou and Rotom-A.</p> <p>Raikou is an additional Rain Dance user, and its Electric-type STAB attacks can eliminate common Water-types such as Gyarados and Suicune. Other beneficiaries of rain are fast Swift Swim users such as Kingdra and Ludicolo, which can help weaken teams for Clamperl whenever Trick Room isn't up.</p> "

  "Latios": {
    "overview": "<p>Latios is one of the tier's most prominent special attackers due to its excellent Special Attack, naturally high Speed tier, and powerful STAB attacks in Draco Meteor and Psychic. Latios also gets coverage options with which it can punish common switch-ins, making it difficult to ever truly counter it. It's a flexible attacker with a variety of offensive sets that, thanks to its typing and ability, can also check rain teams and switch into Earthquakes. However, the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor can leave Latios vulnerable to physical-attacking Steel-types, such as Metagross, or a Tyranitar Pursuit trapping it. Latios also offers little to no utility and struggles against opposing speed control, priority moves, and faster Pokemon such as Raikou and Choice Scarf users.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Non-Choice item sets can forgo Electric-type coverage and use Substitute or Tailwind to create favorable positions against opposing Protects, though this makes it easier for opposing Steel-types to switch in, and it must be noted that Tailwind's effects only last two turns in DPP. One could choose Thunder as Electric-type coverage on rain teams for even greater power, but it is inconsistent outside of rain, which Tyranitar can easily stop.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Metagross, Bronzong, and Heatran can all switch into both Draco Meteor and Psychic, and threaten to either deal heavy damage back with their Steel-type move, set up Substitute, or, in the case of Bronzong, set up Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control and Faster Pokemon: Thunder Wave severely cripples Latios's ability to revenge kill slower threats. Latios also struggles against Swift Swim Kingdra under rain as it can OHKO Latios with its faster Draco Meteor. Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Heracross threaten OHKOs with their STAB moves, as does opposing Choice Scarf Latios with its Draco Meteor. Raikou threatens a 2HKO with Shadow Ball. Latios's high Speed also makes it a liability under Trick Room. Lastly, it must worry about Sucker Punch from common users such as Hitmontop and Mew.</p> <p><strong>Sucker Punch: Like with faster Pokemon, Sucker Punch from common users such as Hitmontop and Mew can 2HKO Latios.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar can use Pursuit to trap opposing Latios after it has used Draco Meteor. It can also effortlessly use Dragon Dance in the face of a -2 Special Attack Latios. Choice Scarf sets can also use Crunch to OHKO it outright.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>A Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor can KO or at least significantly chunk most of the tier. However, the Special Attack drop allows Steel-types such as Metagross to switch in and threaten damage back with their own STAB attacks, while Tyranitar can either trap it with Pursuit or get a free Dragon Dance off. Thunderbolt damages Steel- and Water-types such as Empoleon and Gyarados without lowering Latios's Special Attack. Hidden Power Ground deals more damage against Steel-types such as Metagross and Heatran that would otherwise switch into Latios's STAB attacks; however, one could opt into Trick to cripple physical attackers such as Hitmontop or utility Pokemon such as Bronzong and Cresselia. One could also trade in power for Speed with Choice Scarf to outspeed other common Choice Scarf users, like Heracross, and to avoid the Speed tie with opposing Latios.</p> <p>While Latios has numerous useful resistances, it is still better to avoid risking damage by switching in too frivolously. Latios functions best as a revenge killer, with its devastating Draco Meteor being very difficult to switch into, or as a fast sweeper late-game, when it can lock into its coverage moves without worrying about opposing counterplay.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>As opposed to Choice item sets, Life Orb is a more flexible offensive option for Latios. It can stay on the field longer, as it no longer locks into unfavorable moves, and it can utilize Protect to defend itself in precarious positions, such as by blocking Fake Out, nullifying Sucker Punch, or stalling out opposing speed control.</p> <p>Unlike the hit-and-run nature of its Choice item variants, Life Orb Latios can stay on the field without locking into one move. This means Latios can repeatedly use its powerful attacks throughout the mid-game to weaken teams, allowing another late-game sweeper to clean up. This Latios set also performs well as a late-game sweeper itself, especially with Dragon Pulse, as it no longer worries about the Special Attack drops from Draco Meteor or locking into the right coverage move.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rotom-H is a natural fit, as its Overheat threatens Steel-types that resist Latios's STAB attacks such as Metagross and Bronzong. Choice Specs variants apply a lot of offensive pressure, while support-oriented sets can cripple fast threats for Latios with Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp. A Choice Specs-boosted Rotom-H Shadow Ball can also OHKO opposing Latios.</p> <p>Metagross can switch into Tyranitar and opposing Latios's STAB attacks and threaten significant damage back with Meteor Mash, or set up a Substitute as the foe switches out. Choice Scarf Heracross can also eliminate Tyranitar, as well as Steel-types and opposing Latios and Latias, with its STAB attacks, clearing the way for your own Latios. Other Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Machamp can also punch through Latios's typical answers like Heatran and Tyranitar.</p> <p>Intimidate users such as Hitmontop and Gyarados can extend Latios's longevity by weakening opposing physical attacks such as Sucker Punch, Crunch, and Payback.</p> <p>Fake Out users such as Hitmontop and Mew can immobilize foes or force a Protect on the opponent's side, allowing Latios to attack one Pokemon without worrying about retaliation. The aforementioned users also have Fighting- and Ground-type coverage, respectively, with which they can soften up Steel-types.</p> "
