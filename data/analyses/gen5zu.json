Another useful option that cannot be used alongside Extreme Speed is Fake Out. Nasty Plot is an enticing option on a special-attacking set, though it's held back by Pikachu's horrid bulk and average Speed, so Raichu outclasses it in this role. Pikachu possesses powerful utility options such as Encore, Yawn, and Knock Off, though Pikachu's terrible bulk means that, if it isn't KOing or pivoting off its target, it's likely getting KOed back. Hidden Power Grass threatens Whiscash, OHKOing offensive variants, though the coverage of Hidden Power Ice is generally superior.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fake Out: Fake Out users bypass Pikachu's good Speed and Extreme Speed's +2 priority to threaten Pikachu's terrible Defense.

        "description": "<p>Extreme Speed combined with Pikachu's immense Light Ball-boosted Attack makes it an excellent revenge killer. Wild Charge is Pikachu's strongest physical Electric-type attack that is compatible with Extreme Speed. Volt Switch lets Pikachu pivot while dealing sizeable damage. Hidden Power Ice targets the Grass-, Ground-, and Dragon-types that resist or are immune to Pikachu's Electric-type STAB moves. Maximizing Pikachu's Attack with a Lonely nature is essential to get the most out of Extreme Speed, though Pikachu may either use a Speed-boosting nature or an alternative EV spread of 252 Atk / 112 SpA / 144 Spe. The latter spread increases the power of its special moves, letting it deal more damage to foes like Lairon and Hippopotas, while keeping enough Speed investment to outpace positive-nature base 65 threats such as Mienfoo. Static is the only ability Pikachu possesing Extreme Speed can have.</p> <p>Pikachu is best used on offensive teams looking for a powerful revenge killer. Wallbreakers such as Simisear and Mr. Mime can help break through walls like Solrock and Meganium, which are among the few Pokemon that can switch into Pikachu and remain healthy enough to KO it back. While Pikachu's Extreme Speed is very threatening to frail offensive Pokemon like Simisear and Mr. Mime, it cannot OHKO them and they usually OHKO it back. Thus, sources of chip damage, notably Stealth Rock, are crucial to getting these threats into KO range. Solrock and Lairon are notable Stealth Rock setters, as each additionally provides a strong offensive and defensive backbone. While it is much harder to fit on teams, Spikes support from teammates like Shelmet also goes a long way to help Pikachu get its checks into KO range. Given its frailty, Pikachu appreciates the defensive backbone provided by teammates like Lairon, Solrock, and Muk, as they can switch into the attacks it cannot. Pivots like Mienfoo and Persian can form effective VoltTurn cores with Pikachu, with them notably helping it switch in safely.</p> "

After a Nasty Plot, not many Pokemon will want to switch into it. Its Thunderbolt can do great damage to any Electric-weak target and most neutral foes that have middling bulk; examples of these would be Lairon, Simisear, Arbok and Mr. Mime. Hidden Power Ice hits the Ground- and Grass-types that resist Thunderbolt. Focus Blast is used to pick up OHKOs on Pokemon that Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Ice doesn't, like Lairon, Glaceon, and Graveler. Endure with a Salac Berry is an alternative to boost Raichu's Speed and survive Persian's Fake Out, which is useful on hyper offensive teams. When running Salac Berry + Endure sets, you lose out on 2HKOs with Life Orb at +2 against Meganium, Grumpig and Clefairy, but you gain the ability to outspeed Choice Scarf users except for Simisear. Ice Gem picks up the OHKOs on Hippopotas and bulky Shelgon with Hidden Power Ice after a Nasty Plot boost. Lightning Rod is used over Static to come in on opposing Electric-types to gain a free Special Attack boost. Raichu isn't very keen on taking physical attacks anyways.</p> <p>Raichu does well on balance, offensive, or hyper offensive teams looking for a powerful special sweeper. There are very few options that can deal with Raichu, let alone Raichu with a Nasty Plot boost; these options may outspeed it naturally or with a Choice Scarf. Choice Scarf users would be the likes of Arbok, Grumpig, Mienfoo, and Mr. Mime; naturally, Raichu is outsped by Emolga, Simisear, and Persian. Frillish, Shelgon, and Lairon do well against the majority of these checks. Priority moves are also an option against Raichu, such as Pawniard's and Arbok's Sucker Punch, Pikachu's Extreme Speed, or Muk's Shadow Sneak. Pokemon like Lairon, Solrock and Pelipper can come in on these checks. Another choice is Pokemon with great Special Defense like Meganium, Gloom, Ivysaur, Grumpig, and Clefairy that can take a hit at +2, but they won't OHKO it back unless Raichu has been previously weakened. Bulky Whiscash is the only Pokemon that can take a hit from boosted Raichu and OHKO back. Simisear appreciates Raichu as a teammate to help get through the bulky Water-types like Walrein, Staryu, Pelipper, and Frillish. Raichu ideally wants to pair with a Grass-type like Leafeon, Meganium, or Ivysaur to help with Ground-types Hippopotas, Whiscash, and Wormadam-G. It can pair with Poison-types such as Arbok and Muk to handle the bulkier Grass-types mentioned above, which it can't break through with Hidden Power Ice. Raichu also does well with physical wallbreakers like Muk, Leafeon, and Slaking to help break through their respective physical walls.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With maximum investment in Special Defense, Clefairy is nearly unparalleled in its ability to check special attackers long term. Magic Guard leaves Clefairy unaffected by the status and entry hazards that hamper Grumpig and Meganium, making it an ideal special wall on stall teams. Seismic Toss gives Clefairy a move to output consistent damage regardless of its attacking stats. Knock Off allows Clefairy to permanently cripple any non-Muk switch-in, cutting off healing from Pokemon reliant on Leftovers or softening walls reliant on Eviolite. Removing a boosting item as a Pokemon switches in can also nullify threats that need the item to break through a wall, such as Light Ball Pikachu and Choice Band Slaking. Soft-Boiled is necessary to keep Clefairy healthy, and it can be used alongside Wish for reliability. Thunder Wave allows Clefairy to hamper offensive Pokemon that could otherwise take advantage of it, like Mienfoo or Muk. Encore is a good option to prevent setup from any Pokemon lacking Taunt, allowing a teammate to switch in without risk. Wish provides support to the team, restoring the health of Pokemon without recovery like Muk, Grumpig, and Simisear. Stealth Rock and Heal Bell are two other potential options, but it isn't difficult to fit those moves on other Pokemon and utility moves like Encore and Wish are very powerful.</p> <p>This Clefairy set fits best on defensive and stall teams that have physically defensive support options, as they allow Clefairy to invest fully in Special Defense to take on hugely powerful special attackers like Nasty Plot Simisear, Calm Mind Grumpig, and Substitute Walrein. Solrock is an all-purpose physical wall that helps answer the Normal- and Poison-types that threaten to break stall teams. Clefairy safeguards Solrock against burns and poison while answering the Grass- and Water-types that switch into Solrock like Meganium, Frillish, and Staryu. Meganium is another excellent defensive staple that pairs quite well with Clefairy. Its incredible mixed bulk and typing let it check the few special sweepers that Clefairy cannot answer, namely Nasty Plot Mr. Mime and Raichu, while securing its team against the dangerous Kingler. In exchange, Clefairy's immunity to residual damage lets it absorb any Scald or Toxic aimed at Meganium, maximizing Meganium's bulk instead of forcing it to waste Aromatherapy PP to keep itself healthy. Wormadam-S is another fixture on stall teams that is especially bolstered by Clefairy's Wish support and ability to easily switch into Scald and Will-O-Wisp. It makes the most out of this support by using its great bulk and typing to check a huge range of threats, notably physical attackers it resists like Shelgon and Persian, as well as Grumpig and Mr. Mime, which can do huge damage to Clefairy with a boosted Focus Blast.</p> "

Arbok can act as a wallbreaker with Choice Band or speed control with Choice Scarf, though it's outclassed in both roles.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Hippopotas takes minimal damage even from boosted super effective attacks, has reliable recovery in Slack Off, and threatens Arbok with Earthquake or Whirlwind. Even after a Coil, Wormadam-G or Graveler can tank an Aqua Tail or Seed Bomb and threaten Arbok back with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Without Earthquake or Aqua Tail, Arbok struggles to hurt Steel-types like Lairon and Pawniard, which can easily overwhelm Arbok with their powerful attacks. Wormadam-S is another effective check, as it is not weak to any of Arbok's coverage moves and can hit back hard with Psychic or Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Solrock: If Arbok lacks Aqua Tail or Seed Bomb, Solrock can easily switch in and threaten to burn Arbok with Will-O-Wisp, and it can stay healthy with Morning Sun. Even with super effective coverage and a Coil boost, Arbok cannot OHKO Solrock. However, Arbok has an easier time breaking through offensive Solrock sets, as they have a harder time tanking its attacks and can be removed by Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: If Arbok lacks Seed Bomb, Frillish stonewalls it, while Whiscash can overwhelm it one-on-one. Even with Seed Bomb, Frillish can threaten to burn Arbok before it gets enough boosts to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats: Choice Band Slaking can outspeed and OHKO even a boosted Arbok while taking minimal damage from its Sucker Punch. Naturally faster threats like Simisear and Emolga, alongside Choice Scarf users like Mr. Mime and Kingler, can outspeed Arbok, tank a boosted Sucker Punch, and revenge kill it. However, if they face Arbok at full health, they will likely lose one-on-one, and entry hazards can bring them into Sucker Punch range.

Earthquake primarily targets Steel-types like Lairon and Pawniard, and it has the added benefit of breaking through opposing Arbok, though picking it leaves Arbok struggling against Ground-types and Solrock. Alternatively, Aqua Tail still provides super effective coverage against most Rock- and Ground-types while still doing high damage to Pawniard, though it leaves Arbok unable to break through Whiscash and Frillish before they can KO or cripple it back. Seed Bomb retains super effective damage against Solrock and Ground-types while also threatening Whiscash and Frillish, though now Arbok has no effective way to damage Steel-types, and Frillish can still threaten Arbok if not weakened prior. Sucker Punch lets Arbok pick off faster threats like Persian and Simisear, as well as threatening Choice Scarf Psychic-types like Grumpig and Mr. Mime. Intimidate lets Arbok find more setup opportunities by weakening opposing physical attackers.</p> <p>Arbok best fits on offensive teams looking for an effective wincon that can set up on certain important physical attackers, such as Muk or Mienfoo. Based on its choice of coverage, Solrock, Steel-types, or Ground-types tend to be able to wall it. Water-types such as Staryu and Whiscash serve as effective checks to Solrock and most Pokemon of these types, Grass-types such as Leafeon and Meganium can also handle Solrock and Ground-types, and Mienfoo and Hippopotas can handle Steel-types as well. The aformentioned Grass-types also help against Frillish and Whiscash if Arbok forgoes Seed Bomb. Stealth Rock support from setters such as Solrock and Lairon is essential for getting faster threats like Simisear and Mr. Mime into Sucker Punch range. While much harder to fit on teams, Spikes support from the likes of Pineco or Shelmet also greatly aids Arbok in these matchups, especially with preventing Persian from repeatedly switching in to wear Arbok down with Fake Out. Other offensive threats like Kingler and Raichu can soften up the opposing team to aid Arbok's endgame sweep.</p> "

Heal Bell is for curing Leafeon and its teammates of status conditions. Leaf Blade is still a strong STAB move despite the lack of Attack investment, and it keeps Leafeon from being incredibly passive.</p> <p>Cleric Leafeon does best on bulky and balance teams. It is able to sit in on Pokemon like Solrock, Meganium, Hippopotas, and Vibrava while later curing status with Heal Bell. This means it can pass Wishes with little to no drawback to an offensive Pokemon with a favorable matchup against them like Glaceon, Grumpig, Walrein, or Pelipper. Cleric Leafeon really appreciates being paired with Pokemon such as Simisear, Muk, Emolga, and Arbok that can deal with foes that resist its Leaf Blade. It does well at providing teams with longevity when they otherwise wouldn't be able to outlast bulkier teams that attempt to wear them down with status conditions or other notable chip damage.</p> "

U-turn is a great pivoting tool to take advantage of predicted switches, but it also allows Persian to attack while switching out, which avoids being locked into a suboptimal move. Bite grants Persian a stronger hit on Solrock and allows it to damage Ghost-types like Frillish heavily, but Knock Off is an alternative if crippling Eviolite switch-ins is considered more important. Switcheroo allows Persian to force its Choice Scarf on an opposing wall, ensuring that it will also have utility against defensive teams.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Persian fits well on teams that appreciate Persian's ability to blanket check many setup sweepers that other common Choice Scarf users can't outrun, like Agility Kingler, Salac Berry Raichu, and Salac Berry Simisear. Defensive staples like Meganium lacking Dragon Tail, Staryu, and Solrock are liable to being set up on, and Choice Scarf Persian helps ensure that teams with them are secure versus threats like Raichu. However, teams with this Persian set must have reliable answers to Lairon and other physically bulky setup threats like Shelgon, which Persian has a poor matchup against. Choice Scarf Persian is also one of the best tools for a defensive team against other defensive teams, as Switcheroo can ruin regular Persian checks like Solrock and Wormadam-T.</p> "

Persian's tendency to force physical walls in lets it snipe Pokemon like Lairon, Wormadam-T, and Solrock with a coverage move. Double-Edge is the preferred STAB move on this Persian, as this set cannot afford Silk Scarf and thus needs the power of Double-Edge. Hidden Power Fire is used to dispose of Wormadam-T, which is an incredibly reliable counter otherwise, but Hidden Power Ground can be used alongside U-turn to run a hybrid of the Offensive Pivot and Mixed Wallbreaker sets. This combination allows Persian to still lure in and snipe Lairon and other Steel-types while pivoting out of poor matchups, like Wormadam-T and Solrock. Water Pulse is used to hit Rock- and Ground-types like Lairon, Solrock, and Hippopotas. Knock Off allows Persian to cripple Pokemon that have little issue walling a Persian without Silk Scarf, such as Clefairy or defensive Leafeon. Fake Out lets Persian retain its priority, although it's a notably weaker option without Silk Scarf.</p> <p>This Persian pairs best with teammates that appreciate its ability to lure in regular checks to Persian. Emolga takes incredible advantage of weakened Lairon and Solrock, as this opens up the opposing team to its powerful Acrobatics. Dragon Dance Shelgon also exploits the absence of Steel-types, as it can click Outrage and Dragon Claw without worry. Pikachu and Raichu appreciate that bulky Grass-types are often used to check Persian after this set has been revealed; they're allowed more opportunities to throw out their powerful Electric-type attacks once Persian weakens Meganium or Ivysaur. Offensive Stealth Rock users pair well with this aggressive Persian set, like Lairon, Solrock, and Graveler.</p> "

Persian is the fastest Pokemon with access to all of a weather-setting move, U-turn, and Taunt, which lets it set ideal conditions for Pokemon reliant on weather. Return is the necessary STAB move that allows Persian to threaten damage on its own, but Double-Edge is an alternative to apply more pressure.</p> <p>This Persian set should find itself alongside weather attackers and support Pokemon. On rain teams, Agility Pelipper and Beartic are excellent wallbreakers, and they can clean through weakened teams with their incredible power and Speed under rain. Raichu can make use of a perfectly accurate Thunder under rain, and its Nasty Plot boosted Hidden Power Ice helps wear down Grass-types like Meganium and Ivysaur for Water-type teammates they might wall otherwise. Kingler and Walrein under rain are terrifying threats, using the power boost to destroy all but the bulkiest of checks. Persian cannot keep up weather all on its own, though, and it should pair with other Rain Dance users for consistency. Phione has the best defensive profile of the Rain Dance users, and it utilizes Hydration and Water-type STAB moves to be surprisingly difficult to handle. Illumise is another option, able to use a slow U-turn while setting priority Rain Dance for endgames against fast cleaners.</p> "

If Substitute users like Simisear and Whiscash can set up a Substitute while Slaking is loafing around, they can automatically beat it.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Frillish stands out as one of Slaking’s worst matchups, stomaching a Night Slash even after Stealth Rock. Frillish can cripple it with status or switch to a different teammate as Truant activates. Other Ghost-types like Lampent and Gastly can also switch into Return, but they must be much more careful with Slaking’s Dark-type coverage, and Earthquake for the former.</p> <p><strong>Rock- and Steel-types: Pokemon like Graveler, Lairon, and Pawniard can come in freely on anything but Earthquake, and they can retaliate by either setting up Stealth Rock or freely pivoting to other teammates. Solrock instead can come in on Earthquake but fears Night Slash. Wormadam-S particularly stands out, comfortably tanking any attack Slaking commonly runs and regularly running Protect.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Physical walls like Hippopotas and Gloom can stomach even a Choice Band-boosted Return, recover the damage off, and freely use their utility moves when Truant activates.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Although Slaking sits at a good Speed tier, naturally faster Pokemon like Emolga and Simisear, and Choice Scarf users like Mr. Mime and Glaceon, can pick off Choice Band Slaking with enough chip damage.

Double-Edge can be used over Return for extra power at the cost of wearing Slaking down more quickly. Earthquake crushes Steel-types like Lairon and Pawniard and significantly damages Graveler. Night Slash targets Solrock and Ghost-types like Frillish and Gastly. Sucker Punch picks off faster Pokemon like Simisear, Emolga, and Persian with enough chip damage.

Staryu stands out as a great partner, pressuring Rock- and Steel-types with Scald and Frillish with Toxic, as well as removing entry hazards to improve Slaking's longevity. Pivots such as Emolga and Vibrava allow Slaking an easier time entering the field safely. Pokemon that commonly carry Protect, like Grumpig and Muk, can be especially problematic for Slaking; teammates like Emolga and Arbok can check them with their faster Speed or super effective coverage, respectively. Ground- and Fighting-types like Mienfoo, Hippopotas, and Whiscash can check Steel-types, while Grass-types like Meganium and Ivysaur can check Frillish and Solrock. Once Slaking has sufficiently damaged teams, offensive partners like Muk and Simisear can clean up late-game.</p> "

Psychic is Grumpig's strongest attack to lock into and has solid neutral coverage, dispatching offensive staples like Simisear, Leafeon, and Emolga after some chip damage. Psyshock is a generally weaker alternative that hits unboosted Muk harder, but it is especially effective Mothim after a Quiver Dance. Focus Blast has good synergy with a STAB Psychic, importantly hitting Rock Polish Lairon, but also doing significantly more damage to Pokemon like Clefairy, Glaceon, and Walrein. Hidden Power Fighting gains accuracy against Lairon in exchange for a point of Speed, and due to its lack of power, the ability to hit most other targets. Trick gives Grumpig a way to cripple defensive switch-ins like Clefairy and Meganium and allows it to attack freely. Shadow Ball allows Grumpig to hit other Grumpig and Mr. Mime directly, as well as hitting Frillish and Lampent for more damage than Psychic. If the rest of the team can handle these Pokemon, then Calm Mind can be used in the last moveslot alongside Psyshock. This allows Grumpig to use the free turn from Trick against a foe setting up for its own setup opportunity. Thick Fat notably allows Grumpig to switch into Simisear's STAB moves.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Grumpig is a very flexible Pokemon, able to switch into threats in a pinch and use its wide coverage to handle them accordingly. Balance and offense teams love Grumpig compressing a revenge killer and a switch-in to some of the biggest threats in the metagame, especially Simisear. More defensive teams can also appreciate the speed control Grumpig provides against nearly unwallable threats like Mr. Mime and Simisear. Clefairy is an excellent partner, as Clefairy can blanket check a large portion of the metagame, while Grumpig can offensively answer the few Pokemon capable of breaking through Clefairy, such as Raichu. Persian and Grumpig together can revenge kill almost any threat in the metagame thanks to their Speed and combined physical and special power. If Grumpig is willing to give up its Choice Scarf, then Trick is an excellent tool to facilitate teammates. Certain wallbreakers like Exploud and Pikachu appreciate Clefairy and Meganium being crippled by a Choice Scarf. As a teammate, Meganium wants little more than a Simisear check and a Clefairy hit by Trick, as with those threats crippled or KOed, Meganium becomes nearly impossible to KO. Walrein and Glaceon are two incredible wallbreakers that appreciate Grumpig's revenge killing offensive Pokemon faster than them, and in turn they put huge pressure on Clefairy and opposing Grumpig, potentially opening up a Psychic sweep in the endgame.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Grumpig can even take on a defensive role, utilizing its important resistances and wide movepool to spread status, disrupt the opponent's team, and even become a cleric. Psychic is essential so that Grumpig isn't too passive, letting it threaten frail Pokemon like Simisear and Pokemon weak to Psychic like Mienfoo. The rest of the moves can be picked from Grumpig's many great options, but its most broadly useful option is Thunder Wave, which cripples much of the tier and can set up a slower wallbreaker for success. Taunt allows Grumpig to harass slower walls like Meganium, Clefairy, and Solrock, and any wall after Thunder Wave, preventing them from healing or using their other utility moves. Protect is a consistent option to keep Grumpig healthy over the course of a game, as well as scouting Choice item users and preventing Slaking from Pursuit trapping it. However, Taunt and Protect are by no means mandatory. While cleric support can be fit more easily on other staples like Meganium and Clefairy, Heal Bell can be used if the team is lacking those Pokemon, or to open up their moveslots. Whirlwind is the final common option and very unique, forcing out Substitute users like Walrein and other Grumpig, as well as setup sweepers like Raichu and Shelgon in an emergency. Maximum Special Defense EVs minimize damage from Pokemon like Simisear and Walrein while Grumpig cripples them or forces them out, and Thick Fat provides the pseudo-resistances needed to check said Fire and Ice types.</p> <p>This Grumpig is best used on defensive and stall teams, as it can compress a check to many very threatening special attackers, namely Glaceon and Simisear. A key partner to Grumpig is Solrock, as it can answer many powerful physical attackers, especially Persian and Emolga, while setting Stealth Rock. Frillish allows stall teams to maintain Stealth Rock versus Staryu, heavily cutting into the longevity of wallbreakers like Simisear and Glaceon, which means they cannot come in multiple times to wear Grumpig down. Staryu's Rapid Spin can clear Stealth Rock for Grumpig, making the most of its and its teammates' bulk. Clefairy and Meganium are defensive staples of the metagame that should be used on most stall teams, but their ability to absorb and heal status makes them very valuable to Grumpig in specific, especially if it forgoes Heal Bell. Grumpig lacks reliable healing, so Wish passers like Leafeon and Clefairy are good to keep Grumpig at high health.</p> "

Volt Switch can be picked to evade Rocky Helmet damage from the aforementioned Solrock and chip foes a bit more. Hidden Power Fighting heavily damages Lairon, Pawniard, and Graveler, but it forces Emolga to run 30 Speed IVs, making it slower than opposing Emolga.

Special attackers like Grumpig and Walrein can help scare off physical walls like Solrock and Hippopotas, which would otherwise comfortably switch into Acrobatics. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon like Solrock, Clefairy, and Wormadam-S is also helpful, since it makes Emolga even more difficult to switch into over the course of a game.
