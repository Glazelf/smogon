        "description": "<p>Raichu is one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, and it has a very solid Special Attack stat and great coverage moves to deal with just about anything. After a Nasty Plot, not many Pokemon will want to switch into it. Its Thunderbolt can do great damage to any Electric-weak target and most neutral foes that have middling bulk; examples of these would be Lairon, Simisear, Arbok and Mr. Mime. Hidden Power Ice hits the Ground- and Grass-types that resist Thunderbolt. Focus Blast is used to pick up OHKOs on Pokemon that Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Ice doesn't, like Lairon, Glaceon, and Graveler. Endure with a Salac Berry is an alternative to boost Raichu's Speed and survive Persian's Fake Out, which is useful on hyper offensive teams. When running Salac Berry + Endure sets, you lose out on 2HKOs with Life Orb at +2 against Meganium, Grumpig and Clefairy, but you gain the ability to outspeed Choice Scarf users except for Simisear. Ice Gem picks up the OHKOs on Hippopotas and bulky Shelgon with Hidden Power Ice after a Nasty Plot boost. Lightning Rod is used over Static to come in on opposing Electric-types to gain a free Special Attack boost. Raichu isn't very keen on taking physical attacks anyways.</p> <p>Raichu does well on balance, offensive, or hyper offensive teams looking for a powerful special sweeper. There are very few options that can deal with Raichu, let alone Raichu with a Nasty Plot boost; these options may outspeed it naturally or with a Choice Scarf. Choice Scarf users would be the likes of Arbok, Grumpig, Mienfoo, and Mr. Mime; naturally, Raichu is outsped by Emolga, Simisear, and Persian. Frillish, Shelgon, and Lairon do well against the majority of these checks. Priority moves are also an option against Raichu, such as Pawniard's and Arbok's Sucker Punch, Pikachu's Extreme Speed, or Muk's Shadow Sneak. Pokemon like Lairon, Solrock and Pelipper can come in on these checks. Another choice is Pokemon with great Special Defense like Meganium, Gloom, Ivysaur, Grumpig, and Clefairy that can take a hit at +2, but they won't OHKO it back unless Raichu has been previously weakened. Bulky Whiscash is the only Pokemon that can take a hit from boosted Raichu and OHKO back. Simisear appreciates Raichu as a teammate to help get through the bulky Water-types like Walrein, Staryu, Pelipper, and Frillish. Raichu ideally wants to pair with a Grass-type like Leafeon, Meganium, or Ivysaur to help with Ground-types Hippopotas, Whiscash, and Wormadam-G. It can pair with Poison-types such as Arbok and Muk to handle the bulkier Grass-types mentioned above, which it can't break through with Hidden Power Ice. Raichu also does well with physical wallbreakers like Muk, Leafeon, and Slaking to help break through their respective physical walls.</p> "

Substitute is another option for Coil Arbok to dodge status, though it hates having to give up one of its coverage moves or Sucker Punch. Arbok can act as a wallbreaker with Choice Band or speed control with Choice Scarf, though it's outclassed in both roles.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Hippopotas takes minimal damage even from boosted super effective attacks, has reliable recovery in Slack Off, and threatens Arbok with Earthquake or Whirlwind. Even after a Coil, Wormadam-G or Graveler can tank an Aqua Tail or Seed Bomb and threaten Arbok back with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Without Earthquake or Aqua Tail, Arbok struggles to hurt Steel-types like Lairon and Pawniard, which can easily overwhelm Arbok with their powerful attacks. Wormadam-S is another effective check, as it is not weak to any of Arbok's coverage moves and can hit back hard with Psychic or Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Solrock: If Arbok lacks Aqua Tail or Seed Bomb, Solrock can easily switch in and threaten to burn Arbok with Will-O-Wisp, and it can stay healthy with Morning Sun. Even with super effective coverage and a Coil boost, Arbok cannot OHKO Solrock. However, Arbok has an easier time breaking through offensive Solrock sets, as they have a harder time tanking its attacks and can be removed by Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: If Arbok lacks Seed Bomb, Frillish stonewalls it, while Whiscash can overwhelm it one-on-one. Even with Seed Bomb, Frillish can threaten to burn Arbok before it gets enough boosts to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats: Choice Band Slaking can outspeed and OHKO even a boosted Arbok while taking minimal damage from its Sucker Punch. Naturally faster threats like Simisear and Emolga, alongside Choice Scarf users like Mr. Mime and Kingler, can outspeed Arbok, tank a boosted Sucker Punch, and revenge kill it. However, if they face Arbok at full health, they will likely lose one-on-one, and entry hazards can bring them into Sucker Punch range. Persian's Fake Out out-prioritizes Sucker Punch and is thus able to pick off a weakened Arbok.</p> ",

Earthquake primarily targets Steel-types like Lairon and Pawniard, and it has the added benefit of breaking through opposing Arbok, though picking it leaves Arbok struggling against Ground-types and Solrock. Alternatively, Aqua Tail still provides super effective coverage against most Rock- and Ground-types while still doing high damage to Pawniard, though it leaves Arbok unable to break through Whiscash and Frillish before they can KO or cripple it back. Seed Bomb retains super effective damage against Solrock and Ground-types while also threatening Whiscash and Frillish, though now Arbok has no effective way to damage Steel-types, and Frillish can still threaten Arbok if not weakened prior. Sucker Punch lets Arbok pick off faster threats like Persian and Simisear, as well as threatening Choice Scarf Psychic-types like Grumpig and Mr. Mime. Intimidate lets Arbok find more setup opportunities by weakening opposing physical attackers.</p> <p>Arbok best fits on offensive teams looking for an effective wincon that can set up on certain important physical attackers, such as Muk or Mienfoo. Based on its choice of coverage, Solrock, Steel-types, or Ground-types tend to be able to wall it. Water-types such as Staryu and Whiscash serve as effective checks to Solrock and most Pokemon of these types, Grass-types such as Leafeon and Meganium can also handle Solrock and Ground-types, and Mienfoo and Hippopotas can handle Steel-types as well. The aformentioned Grass-types also help against Frillish and Whiscash if Arbok forgoes Seed Bomb. Stealth Rock support from setters such as Solrock and Lairon is essential for getting faster threats like Simisear and Mr. Mime into Sucker Punch range. While much harder to fit on teams, Spikes support from the likes of Pineco or Shelmet also greatly aids Arbok in these matchups, especially with preventing Persian from repeatedly switching in to wear Arbok down with Fake Out. Other offensive threats like Kingler and Raichu can soften up the opposing team to aid Arbok's endgame sweep.</p> "

Calm Mind is an enticing option when paired with Solrock's diverse special movepool, which includes Flamethrower, Fire Blast, Earth Power, and Shadow Ball. However, Solrock's unboosted Special Attack is abysmal, and Solrock lacks a good special Rock-type STAB move. Additionally, as a special attacker, Lunatone outperforms Solrock.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Physically defensive Pokemon like Clefairy and Hippopotas don't mind most of Solrock's attacks and can overwhelm it with chip damage or status.

Due to how common the Pokemon it walls are, Solrock can effortlessly find opportunities to set up Stealth Rock, making it among the best setters in the tier. Rock Slide is Solrock's preferred Rock-type STAB move due to its solid accuracy and ability to flinch Clefairy, though Stone Edge can be used instead for its higher damage, notably scoring a 2HKO on Persian. Earthquake primarily targets Steel-types like Lairon and Pawniard and certain Poison-types like Arbok and Muk. Will-O-Wisp is an alternative over either attacking move, as it's a strong catch-all tool that lets Solrock cripple the physical attackers it's tasked with checking, mitigating the hole it leaves in Solrock's coverage. Rocky Helmet is used to wear down opposing physical attackers, notably targeting users of U-turn, though Leftovers can be held instead to make Solrock itself less susceptible to being worn down. 16 Speed EVs let Solrock outspeed Adamant Lairon, with the rest being used to maximize physical bulk.</p> <p>Solrock is a perfect fit on defensive, balance, and bulky offense teams looking for a reliable check to most physical attackers. Notably, every team needs some check to Persian, a role Solrock is superb at. While Solrock pairs well with the majority of the tier due to the sheer volume of Pokemon it checks, it's a notably excellent partner to physically frail Pokemon like Persian and Simisear, which enjoy having a sturdy defensive backbone. Solrock needs the support of wallbreakers like Muk and Kingler, as it lacks the firepower to reliably break through bulky foes like physically defensive Clefairy and Meganium. Solrock's mediocre special bulk leaves it losing to most special attackers, so a special sponge like Muk or specially defensive Clefairy pairs well with it. Solrock also can't wall Water- and Grass-types, so checks to them like Ivysaur and Meganium are good partners as well.</p> "

Emolga’s last moveslot is quite flexible: Taunt stops walls like Clefairy, Wormadam-S, and Frillish from using their utility moves, Encore locks Pokemon like Arbok and Grumpig into their setup moves, and Knock Off cripples Eviolite-reliant walls like Frillish and Staryu, as well as removing Leftovers from Pokemon like Wormadam-S. Motor Drive gives Emolga an Electric immunity and additional Speed from Electric-type attacks, like opposing Volt Switch, potentially letting it beat other Emolga.</p> <p>Emolga is an excellent facilitator for VoltTurn teams and pairs well with other pivots like Persian, Mienfoo, and Pelipper. Emolga’s pivoting also allows for offensive threats like Simisear, Grumpig, and Arbok to hit the field more safely. In turn, Emolga appreciates having Rock-type checks removed or severely weakened by teammates like Meganium, Staryu, and Ivysaur. Special attackers like Grumpig and Walrein can help scare off physical walls like Solrock and Hippopotas, which would otherwise comfortably switch into Acrobatics. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon like Solrock, Clefairy, and Wormadam-S is also helpful, since it makes Emolga even more difficult to switch into over the course of a game. Bulky Pokemon to stomach hits from faster threats like Persian and Choice Scarf Simisear, like Hippopotas and bulky Grumpig, can help with Emolga's longevity.</p> "
