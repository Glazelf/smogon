        "description": "<p>Venusaur is a great sun sweeper because of its ability Chlorophyll, good Special Attack, and good movepool consisting of moves like Growth and Weather Ball. Weather Ball turns into a Fire-type move in the sun that can take care of Corviknight and Aegislash. Giga Drain is used to enable Venusaur to take care of Water- and Ground-types such as Keldeo, Toxapex, and Gastrodon while giving it a way to recover from Life Orb recoil. Sludge Bomb is used to OHKO Fairy-types such as Togekiss and can take care of Hydreigon and Kyurem-B after a single use of Growth. Growth should be used under sun to turn Venusaur into a dangerous sweeper. Earth Power is a niche option that can be used to hit Poison-type Pokemon such as Salazzle and Drapion. Venusaur should try to set up Growth on a predicted switch or on a passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Toxapex. It should also come in on via a U-turn or Memento from Whimsicott or on passive Pokemon such as Toxapex. A Modest nature allows it to net an OHKO on Aegislash and Corviknight.</p> <p>Whimsiscott is a mandatory teammate because of its access to Prankster Sunny Day and its ability to get Venusaur in safely with U-turn or Memento. Shiftry is a great partner to pair with Venusaur because of its Dark typing and Chlorophyll, allowing it to take care of Psychic-types that Venusaur can struggle with such as Jirachi and Indeedee. Shiftry can also take care of Dragapult with Sucker Punch. Celebi also goes great with Venusaur because it can help pressure Fighting-types such as Bulletproof Kommo-o and use Weather Ball to help Venusaur sweep in the Steel-type matchup. Celebi can also greatly help in the Poison-type matchup with Earth Power and Psychic. Ferrothorn is great to pair with Venusaur due to its access to entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes and ability to come in on Ice-type attacks from Cloyster and Alolan Ninetales and physical attacks such as Dracovish's Psychic Fang. Virizion is a great revenge killer that also deals with threats like Snorlax, Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Centiskorch against Normal-, Dark-, Ice-, and Bug-type matchups respectively. It can also take care of Alolan Ninetales with Smart Strike and act as an emergency Sunny Day settler if Whimsicott gets KOed.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its great Speed, high Special Attack, and Solar Power ability with sun support, Charizard is an amazing Choice Scarf user and wallbreaker. It's able to outspeed big threats such as Choice Scarf Excadrill, Choice Scarf Indeedee, and Dragapult and threaten them with its powerful attacks. Solar Power gives Charizard a 1.5x Special Attack boost under sun that makes it an incredibly strong wallbreaker capable of sweeping entire teams like Psychic and Fairy and allows it to OHKO threats such as Dragapult with Dragon Pulse after Stealth Rock. Flamethrower is used in situations where Charizard can't afford missing such as against Choice Scarf Excadrill, which can sweep Fire pretty easily without Charizard to revenge kill it. Fire Blast is the more powerful option, best suited when Charizard wants to deal as much damage as possible against the opposing team. Dragon Pulse hits threatening Dragon-types such as the aforementioned Dragapult and is overall amazing in the Dragon matchup, as Charizard is able to clean late-game. Focus Blast hits bulky Pokemon that resist its Fire STAB such as Tyranitar, Rhyperior, and Thick Fat Snorlax. Charizard should avoid switching in when Stealth Rock are up because its 4x weakness and the substantial Solar Power recoil adds up very quickly, and its teammates should find opportunities to remove them so Charizard has more freedom. Due to how powerful its Fire attacks are under sun, it should either break holes in the opposing team early so its teammates can clean up or be preserved for a late-game sweep. Charizard is also a great revenge killer that can deal with threats such as Dracozolt and Hydreigon.</p> <p>Torkoal is an amazing teammate because it sets up sun for Charizard with its Drought, can remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin, and can set its own Stealth Rock to chip Pokemon like Dragapult to support Charizard's wallbreaking. Cinderace can also get rid of hazards if they're not up on both sides with Court Change and can pivot with U-turn to give Charizard safe switches in. Cinderace also has High Jump Kick to hit threats such as Tyranitar and Snorlax. Ninetales is another sun setter that supports Charizard's Solar Power wallbreaking that can break holes in teams using its own sun-boosted Fire attacks, Solar Beam to hit Water- and Rock-types, and Nasty Plot to weaken the opposing team for Charizard. Rotom-H is a good teammate because it threatens Water-types with its Electric-type attacks and provides a second option for Ground immunity for Fire-type teams barring Mold Breaker users such as Excadrill. Arcanine is a strong physical wallbreaker with nice coverage in Wild Charge and Close Combat, as well as Extreme Speed to pick off weakened foes or put them in range for Charizard to revenge kill. Chandelure can be used as a second Choice Scarf user to threaten Dragapult and cripple annoying Pokemon such as Toxapex and Appletun by using Trick. Salazzle can use its Corrosion Toxic to spread poison and wear down Pokemon such as Toxapex that Charizard can't handle.</p> "

However, Alolan Raichu's underwhelming Special Attack makes it unable to OHKO walls like Tyranitar in sand, Heatran, and Ferrothorn, even with a Life Orb. Outside of Electric Terrain, Alolan Raichu is outsped by many threats like Spectrier, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Alolan Raichu's very poor bulk makes it unable to come into attacks freely while making it susceptible to priority users like Urshifu-R, Crawdaunt, Dragonite, and Rillaboom.</p> ",

Focus Blast heavily damages Dark-, Steel-, and Ice-types such as Zarude, Tyranitar, Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Kyurem. Knock Off is useful for removing Galarian Slowking's Assault Vest, making it much easier to deal with for Electric teams. Grass Knot can be used over Knock Off to super effectively hit Water-types that are immune to Rising Voltage such as Swampert, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad and threaten Ground-types like Hippowdon. Nasty Plot can be used over Knock Off or Grass Knot to make Alolan Raichu a fearsome setup sweeper, taking advantage of Pokemon it forces out such as Pelipper and Amoonguss.

Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Alolan Raichu outspeed foes like Hydreigon, Volcarona, and Garchomp outside of Electric Terrain.</p> <p>Because of Alolan Raichu's mediocre bulk, it appreciates Volt Switch support from teammates like Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Rotom-W to bring it in safely.

Additionally, Tapu Koko can take on Dragon-types that Alolan Raichu struggles with, like Latias and Latios, thanks to its Dragon immunity and Dazzling Gleam and weaken shared checks such as Galarian Slowking, which Alolan Raichu can capitalize on in the late-game. Zeraora is a fantastic physical wallbreaker, pressuring troublesome specially defensive walls like Blissey and Galarian Slowking. In return, Alolan Raichu can deal with threatening physical walls such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Amoonguss.

  "Nidoking": {
    "overview": "<h1>Ground</h1> <p>Nidoking is Ground's best special wallbreaker due to its various coverage moves boosted by Sheer Force and Life Orb, which let it break past physically defensive walls such as Skarmory, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn that are otherwise difficult for the type to break through. Nidoking also helps against types like Fairy, Flying, Steel, and Grass, as they lack sturdy defensive switch-ins to it. Its part-Poison typing provides useful defensive utility by letting it switch in on Fairy-type attacks and remove Toxic Spikes. It is additionally the only way for Ground teams to set Toxic Spikes themselves. However, while Nidoking can pressure many physically defensive walls, its Speed tier leaves it outsped and KOed by a plethora of offensive Pokemon, such as Tapu Lele, Excadrill, and Hydreigon, to name a few. Nidoking's mediocre bulk also makes it difficult to come in on Pokemon that it can deal with but can wear it down, such as Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Bulu. This frailty also makes it vulnerable even to revenge killers lacking super effective moves such as Spectrier.</p> <h1>Poison</h1> <p>Nidoking is one of the best wallbreakers that Poison has to offer thanks to its powerful combination of Life Orb and Sheer Force. Its role as a wallbreaker is very important in the Steel matchup, as Earth Power + Flamethrower demolishes Steel teams after Heatran's Air Balloon has been popped. Nidoking also offers Poison an Electric immunity to prevent Volt Switch spam from Electric-types like Regieleki and Tapu Koko. Its access to BoltBeam coverage allows Nidoking to apply more pressure on Flying teams, which is nice, since Stealth Rock cannot pressure Flying much because of how often it uses Heavy-Duty Boots. Nidoking is, however, slower than many faster threats like Excadrill, Cinderace, and Keldeo and weak to Water-, Ice-, and Ground-type moves like Scald, Ice Beam, and Earthquake. These flaws mean, Nidoking can only come in on certain passive walls or slower Pokemon like Galarian Weezing, Skarmory, and Toxapex.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Ground</h1> <p>Sludge Wave can be used over Earth Power to 2HKO defensive Pokemon that can tank the rest of Nidoking's moves easily such as Rotom-W and Moltres. However, forgoing Earth Power means Nidoking can't break through Heatran, limiting its effectiveness in the Steel matchup. Fire Blast over Flamethrower notably 2HKOes specially defensive Celesteela, but it is less reliable. Substitute is an option to make Nidoking harder to revenge kill, but it is very hard to fit.</p> <h1>Poison</h1> <p>Sludge Wave can be used to notably hit Clefable, because, otherwise, Nidoking may be at risk of losing its item from Knock Off.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Ground</h1> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Specially defensive walls such as Blissey and defensive Rotom-W can tank multiple hits from Nidoking and retaliate.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Powerful revenge killers such as Alolan Raichu, Barraskewda, and Spectrier can force out Nidoking easily by threatening an OHKO with their STAB moves.

Nidoking must also be wary of super effective attacks from slower foes such as Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Swampert, as it fails to OHKO them.</p> <h1>Poison</h1> <p><strong>Knock Off: Nidoking does not appreciate its item being removed and it being weakened by Knock Off users like Clefable and Tornadus-T.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves: Priority moves like Aqua Jet and Ice Shard from Pokemon like Crawdaunt, Azumarill, and Mamoswine can KO Nidoking if their users are running a damage-boosting item like Choice Band or Life Orb, or after some prior chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks: Fast Ground-type Pokemon like Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Garchomp threaten Nidoking out with Earthquake. They also fear switching into Nidoking, though, since they are at risk of being hit by Ice Beam. Water-types like Keldeo, Urshifu-R, and Barraskewda can KO Nidoking with their Water-type STAB moves but do not always appreciate switching in risking a Thunderbolt. Ice-types like Kyurem, Weavile, and Mamoswine can KO Nidoking with Ice-type moves bar Ice Shard, which requires prior chip damage. However, yet again, they fear switching in, this time due to Earth Power or Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Specially bulky Pokemon like Piloswine, Blissey, and Snorlax can sponge all of Nidoking's attacks. Piloswine can KO Nidoking with Earthquake and set Stealth Rock for chip damage, while Blissey and Snorlax can recover from and switch into its moves whenever due to their high bulk. Blissey can set up Stealth Rock and generate momentum with Teleport, while Snorlax can set up Curse and recover off damage with Rest. Slowking can also generate momentum with Teleport or deal chip damage with Scald, while Mandibuzz can remove Nidoking's Life Orb with Knock Off and recover with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Naturally faster threats like both Urshifu formes, Tapu Lele, and Excadrill, and Choice Scarf users like Galarian Darmanitan and Heracross have no problem KOing Nidoking.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<p>Earth Power is the preferred STAB move, as it covers walls such as Heatran, physically defensive Gastrodon, and Tyranitar. Flamethrower provides great coverage against Steel- and Grass-types such as Skarmory, Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Bulu, hitting them for massive damage. Ice Beam nails Flying- and Dragon-types such as Zapdos, Dragonite, and Garchomp, as well as potential switch-ins like Landorus-T, Latias, and Hydreigon. It also deals with Cradily better than Earth Power. Thunderbolt hits additional Flying-types that are neutral to Ice Beam such as Mantine, Pelipper, and Celesteela super effectively. Toxic Spikes can be used over Earth Power to support the team and quickly wear down grounded foes such as Porygon2. However, Nidoking's poor bulk gives it limited opportunities to set Toxic Spikes, and Earth Power is needed to break through Heatran. Sheer Force works well in tandem with Life Orb, preventing Nidoking from being worn down by Life Orb recoil and stacking damage boosts. A Timid nature allows Nidoking to outspeed the likes of Tapu Bulu and Heatran.</p> <p>Teammates such as Mamoswine, Landorus-T, and Excadrill appreciate Nidoking's ability to deal with threats like Skarmory and Celesteela. Hippowdon is a good partner, as its Sand Stream and Stealth Rock support wears down foes quickly for Nidoking. Additionally, its good bulk lets it come in on physical attackers such as Choice Scarf Excadrill, Garchomp, and Galarian Zapdos. Excadrill breaks through troublesome specially defensive walls such as Blissey and Slowking for Nidoking, beats Psychic- and Ice-types that it struggles against such as Tapu Lele, Alolan Ninetales, and Kyurem, and provides Rapid Spin support. Under Hippowdon's sand, Excadrill can also outspeed a handful of other offensive threats for Nidoking such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon, Dragapult, and Spectrier. Gastrodon and Seismitoad both provide a Water immunity for Nidoking; Gastrodon's Recover makes it more reliable against threats like Barraskewda, Keldeo, and Tapu Fini, and Seismitoad can check the highly dangerous Azumarill. Mamoswine is a powerful wallbreaker that can revenge kill some faster threats that give Nidoking trouble such as Latias, Dragapult, and Thundurus-T with Ice Shard. Choice Scarf Landorus-T is able to revenge kill additional fast foes such as Spectrier, Tapu Lele, and Volcarona while providing entry hazard removal with Defog. Its Ground immunity is also useful to handle threats such as Excadrill and Garchomp. Bulk Up + Gravity Landorus-T is another option to make Nidoking's Earth Power more spammable while helping in matchups like Poison. Choice Scarf Krookodile can act as a dangerous revenge killer against Ghost- and Psychic-types like Spectrier, Victini, and Latios. Krookodile also provides an immunity against Psychic-type attacks directed at Nidoking.</p> "

It appreciates Flamethrower for consistency to help with Steel-, Bug-, and Grass-types like Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Buzzwole, and Tapu Bulu, whereas Fire Blast is nice for picking up more KOs against bulkier Steel-types like Celesteela and Corviknight. Both Earth Power and Flamethrower are needed to deal with Steel's defensive cores members: Aegislash, Heatran, and Celesteela, but, Thunderbolt or Ice Beam is needed to pop Heatran's Air Balloon. Thunderbolt is useful for hitting Water- and Flying-types like Mantine and Slowbro, whereas Ice Beam helps with Ground-, Grass-, and Flying-types like Hippowdon, Appletun, and defensive Zapdos. Stealth Rock allows Nidoking to compress the role of entry hazard setter, but the presence of Heavy-Duty Boots reduces the need for hazards. Maximized Speed EVs allow Nidoking to Speed tie an opposing Nidoking and outpace Diggersby and Togekiss.</p> <p>Nidoking offers the entire team its Electric immunity, but Toxapex appreciates it more than other teammates due to its weakness to Electric. Toxapex's bulk and Scald allow it to switch into physical attackers that threaten Nidoking like Barraskewda and Cinderace while also shutting down setup sweepers like Weavile and Cloyster with Haze. Galarian Weezing provides a Dragon immunity, which is important to switch into a Draco Meteor or Dragon Darts that could KO Nidoking, while also having utilities like Defog to get rid of entry hazards, Will-O-Wisp and Toxic Spikes to spread status, and Pain Split for longevity. Nidoking is weak to Psychic, so adding a Psychic-immune teammate like Skuntank or Drapion helps with Pokemon like Latias, Alakazam, and Tapu Lele. The former has Defog and Sucker Punch to revenge kill Psychic- and Ghost-types like Blacephalon and Alolan Raichu, while the latter has useful utilities like Knock Off, which removes Heavy-Duty Boots and makes Stealth Rock more effective and Whirlwind to phaze setup sweepers like Jirachi and Spectrier. Amoonguss is the best check to Ground-type Pokemon, notably Mold Breaker Excadrill, which threatens Nidoking and most of its teammates with Earthquake. Amoonguss also helps break Steel teams, as it has Spore to give Nidoking opportunities to come in while also forming a Regenerator core with Toxapex; together, they help Nidoking deal with Ground-, Rock-, and Water-type Pokemon like Excadrill, Rhyperior, Terrakion, and Urshifu-R. Nihilego runs Choice Scarf to revenge kill Pokemon like Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Victini and appreciates Nidoking's ability to threaten Steel-types it cannot properly deal with, like Ferrothorn and Aegislash. It has nice coverage moves like Thunderbolt, Dazzling Gleam, Power Gem, and Grass Knot, which improve quite a few matchups like Flying, Dragon, Fire, and Ground. Gengar is an option over Nihilego and supports Drapion or Skuntank in dealing with Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon like Galarian Corsola and Slowbro with Shadow Ball, and it also deals with bulky Pokemon like Toxapex and Aegislash. Galarian Slowking's ability to sponge Psychic-type attacks that KO Nidoking from Pokemon like Alolan Raichu and Latias is appreciated, and it forms a triple Regenerator core with Toxapex and Amoonguss, making Poison teams harder to break.</p> "

It also means Clefable can come in freely against Spikes when going against types like Grass and Steel.

A coveted move in Nasty Plot lets it shred apart opposing teams and take up the role of a wallbreaker too. Its access to a strong Grass-type move in Solar Beam, which charges in one turn when sun is up, lets it take care of Rock-, Water-, and Ground-types such as Rhyperior, Jellicent, and Gastrodon. With Nasty Plot and Extrasensory, Ninetales is also able to deal with Toxapex, which can otherwise stomach hits from it. Hypnosis is an option over Extrasensory to put to sleep troublesome Pokemon like Tyranitar and Toxapex on a predicted switch-in. Against defensive teams like Poison, Ninetales should focus on setting up with Nasty Plot to break through the opposition, while against offensive teams like hyper offense Ghost, Ninetales should focus on direct attacking due to the lack of a defensive backbone to tank hits. Maximum Special Attack investment lets Ninetales hit as hard as possible, and maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows it to outspeed slower Pokemon that could KO Ninetales, such as Indeedee and Obstagoon. Heat Rock maximizes the number of sun turns, increasing the damage of Fire-type moves for Ninetales and its teammates.</p> <p>All of Ninetales's teammates enjoy its ability to set sun. Charizard appreciates Ninetales's wallbreaking ability that allows it to clean late-game, as well as providing sun to activate Solar Power. In return, Charizard can take care of threats like Dragapult and Tyranitar with Dragon Pulse and Focus Blast, respectively. Choice Band Arcanine forms a good wallbreaking core with Ninetales, weakening each other's checks and counters. Arcanine also appreciates Hypnosis support from Ninetales to further limit its checks like Hippowdon. Cinderace can swap Stealth Rock from its side of the field with Court Change and threaten common hazard setters like Tyranitar with High Jump Kick. Torkoal can provide Ninetales with essential Stealth Rock support to score easier KOs and keep opposing hazards away with Rapid Spin, as they would otherwise undermine Ninetales's potential as a wallbreaker. In addition, Torkoal can set sun against slower weather setters like Pelipper and Hippowdon. Rotom-H can provide Ninetales with Volt Switch and Defog support; additionally, they can run Nasty Plot sets together to overwhelm shared checks.</p> "

Light Clay and Snow Warning pair with Aurora Veil to maximize its duration and enable setup, enabling teammates such as Mimikyu to more easily take advantage of it. The given EVs and a Timid nature allow Alolan Ninetales to be as strong and fast as possible and take on Pokemon such as Cloyster and Toxapex. Alolan Ninetales should time when its sets Aurora Veil against other teams with access to weather, as it can easily be blocked if hail is overridden.</p> <p>All of Alolan Ninetales teammates appreciate its ability to set up Aurora Veil, especially the setup sweepers. Calm Mind Hatterene, Swords Dance Mimikyu, Bulk Up Grimmsnarl, and Nasty Plot Togekiss are the team's setup sweepers that can take advantage of Aurora Veil, allowing them to tank hits with more ease and making setting up easier. Hatterene also can bounce back entry hazards for Alolan Ninetales thanks to Magic Bounce, which also allows it to keep up Aurora Veil against Defog users such as Galarian Weezing and Pelipper. Other teammates such as Gardevoir and Primarina appreciate the Aurora Veil, as it allows them to spam their attacks with little drawback. Gardevoir especially helps Alolan Ninetales, as it can take advantage of opposing weather teams thanks to Trace and its Choice Scarf to revenge kill their sweepers with ease, such as Excadrill and Barraskewda. Clefable is another support Pokemon available to Aurora Veil teams, being able to support them with Thunder Wave and Healing Wish or set up Stealth Rock, allowing its teammates to break through the foe's team with more ease. Stealth Rock also allows Alolan Ninetales to at least 2HKO all Pokemon in the Water matchup, such as taking out Toxapex with Freeze-Dry and OHKOing Cloyster with Moonblast. Pokemon such as Grimmsnarl can take on Pokemon that can beat Ninetales such as Jirachi and Gengar with Sucker Punch, and Togekiss can tank attacks from Choice Scarf users that take can OHKO Alolan Ninetales such as Duraludon and paralyze them with Thunder Wave. Lastly, Ribombee's Sticky Web allows Alolan Ninetales to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion, Dracovish, and Duraludon.</p> "

Thanks to it, Dugtrio can pick off weakened foes or eliminate problematic threats such as Dracovish and Weavile without allowing them to counteract. Earthquake is Dugtrio's primary and strongest attack. Stone Edge is mainly used to hit Flying-types such as Gyarados and Charizard. Reversal hits extremely hard when Focus Sash is consumed, allowing Dugtrio to do significant damage to Normal- and Ice-type Pokemon such as Obstagoon and Mamoswine. Sucker Punch allows Dugtrio to hit common Choice Scarf users such as Galarian Darmanitan and Dracovish, and common priority users such as Mamoswine. Screech can be used as an alternative to further complement its physical presence, allowing Dugtrio to trap foes more consistently by reducing their Defense. Focus Sash complements its ability Arena Trap, as it guarantees at least one Pokemon trapped from full HP. Dugtrio should seek trapping opportunities to pick off weakened foes or slower Pokemon that it can reliably beat.</p> <p>Dugtrio needs to keep its Focus Sash intact in order to trap fast threats such as Weavile effectively, so Excadrill makes an excellent teammate for Dugtrio, as it can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards for Dugtrio. It can also handle Fairy-types such as Grimmsnarl and Ribombee that either use Dugtrio as setup fodder or simply easily KO it without fear of Reversal. Hippowdon makes another decent teammate for Dugtrio with its access to Sand Stream and Stealth Rock; the cumulated passive chip damage allows Dugtrio to trap more consistently throughout the match. With its great bulk, Hippowdon can also pivot for Dugtrio after it traps and removes a threat and a revenge killer is sent out by the opponent. Mamoswine is a good offensive teammate with nearly unresisted coverage that allows it to punch many holes in opposing teams; this allows Mamoswine and Dugtrio to complement each other excellently. Dugtrio can trap and eliminate Pokemon that were weakened by Mamoswine, while it also can be used to trap fast Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Dracovish to grant Mamoswine freedom. Seismitoad is a good defensive partner with access to Toxic, which can generate chip damage for Dugtrio for consistent trapping. With its ability in Water Absorb, it can also check Dracovish. Rhyperior makes a good teammate for Dugtrio, as it can handle the Flying-types that Dugtrio cannot trap and struggles against, most notably Corviknight.</p> "

Its ability Intimidate provides some utility support, as it allows Arcanine to deter physical attackers like Gyarados for the team.

Wild Charge lets Arcanine deal with Water-type Pokemon such as Toxapex, Pelipper, Mantine, and Gyarados. Close Combat allows Arcanine to beat Thick Fat Snorlax and threaten Normal-type teams and is also good against common Rock-types like Tyranitar that can switch into its Flare Blitz. Extreme Speed lets Arcanine beat faster Pokemon like Hydreigon, Keldeo, and Alolan Raichu after they have been weakened.

Shadow Ball lets Alakazam do good damage to Pokemon weak to it like Aegislash and Alolan Raichu. Focus Blast, on the other hand, lets Alakazam threaten Ferrothorn and Tyranitar, which can stomach its other moves easily. Alakazam should not take any unnecessary damage that may result from directly switching it into opposing Pokemon, as they may leave it unable to retain its Focus Sash.

Its low HP stat makes Pain Split a form of semi-reliable recovery. Its part-Poison typing provides a neutrality to Poison-type attacks, allowing it to switch into attacks such as Drapion's Poison Jab and excel in the Fairy matchup. Nonetheless, its special bulk is not great, allowing many special attackers to take advantage of it such as Spectrier, Kyurem, and Volcarona.

Neutralizing Gas allows it to hinder Pokemon that rely on their abilities to function well, nullifying Crawdaunt's Adaptability, Jirachi's Serene Grace to reduce its flinch chance, and even Hatterene's Magic Bounce to set up Toxic Spikes. Additionally, its ability nullifies Levitate, making Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Hydreigon vulnerable to its Toxic Spikes. Finally, Neutralizing Gas also allows Galarian Weezing to prevent Regenerator users such as Amoonguss and Toxapex from healing by switching out, allowing Fairy teams to make significant progress against Poison teams. Sludge Bomb allows it to target Pokemon such as Azumarill as well as poison walls such as Mantine and Mandibuzz. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Diggersby and Zeraora. Toxic Spikes cripples foes such as Dragapult and Urshifu-R, allowing its teammates like Azumarill, Mimikyu, and Togekiss to sweep easily. Pain Split allows Galarian Weezing to regain health throughout the match and wear down the foe. Black Sludge is especially useful due to Pain Split not always being reliable. Maximum HP and Defense EVs alongside a Bold nature make Galarian Weezing as physically bulky as possible, allowing it to take on Pokemon such as Zeraora and Diggersby.</p> <p>All of Galarian Weezing's offensive teammates appreciate its ability to set up Toxic Spikes, which allows them to break through Pokemon such as Swampert and Porygon2. Galarian Weezing can also help teammates set up more easily by crippling physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp. Its secondary Poison typing also allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes for its teammates. Tapu Lele can take on Poison-type Pokemon such as Toxapex and Amoonguss with Psychic for Galarian Weezing. Additionally, it can threaten a majority of Defog users with Thunderbolt and Moonblast, like Mantine and Mandibuzz. Tapu Bulu can take on and pressure Ground- and Water-type Pokemon like Garchomp, Swampert, and Urshifu-R. Tapu Koko can deal with Flying-type Pokemon such as Celesteela. Additionally, Tapu Koko can provide Taunt utility to prevent Defog users such as Zapdos from removing Galarian Weezing's Toxic Spikes. Mimikyu can take on Psychic-type Pokemon that threaten Galarian Weezing like Tapu Lele and Alakazam with its Ghost-type STAB moves. Azumarill sets up with Belly Drum to break past bulky Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Chansey. Azumarill can also threaten Ground-type Pokemon such as Excadrill for Galarian Weezing. Choice Scarf Alolan Ninetales can take on Ground- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T with Blizzard. Klefki can form a hazard-stacking core with Galarian Weezing by setting Spikes and can set dual screens to allow Galarian Weezing to tank attacks more easily.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Galarian Weezing plays an important role on Poison teams because of its access to Defog along with its good ability and typing. Having a Defog user is especially important for Poison as a balance type because it prevents teams from being overwhelmed by Spikes. Galarian Weezing also helps against opposing Terrain, allowing teammates like Skuntank to use priority without Psychic Terrain and helping other revenge killers like Choice Scarf Gengar and Choice Scarf Drapion to beat Alolan Raichu by overriding its Electric Terrain. Seeing as Poison teams are typically weak to Ground-type Pokemon such as Sand Rush Excadrill, Choice Band Mamoswine, and Diggersby, Levitate is extremely crucial. Furthermore, Galarian Weezing's Fairy typing allows it to switch into Dark- and Dragon-type attacks from Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Dragapult and beat them in return with Strange Steam. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Mimikyu and Tyranitar. A physically defensive spread is used to more easily check a massive threat in Dragon Dance Kyurem-B. Clear Smog or Flamethrower can be used over Defog if the team has Skuntank to fill the Defog role. The former prevents setup sweepers from setting up on Galarian Weezing for free, and the latter hits Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn for super effective damage. Seeing as it relies on Pain Split for recovery, Galarian Weezing should be carefully preserved throughout a match in order to switch into Ground-type attacks as well as Defog away hazards. This means it should avoid switching into strong attacks such as Pelipper's Hurricane and Heliolisk's Thunderbolt.</p> <p>The entire Poison team appreciates Galarian Weezing's Ground immunity. Salazzle is one of the best partners for Galarian Weezing, as it can beat Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Bisharp, and Corviknight. Toxapex, Vileplume, and Drapion form a good defensive core with Galarian Weezing. Toxapex can switch into a myriad of attacks such as Bisharp's Iron Head and Aegislash's Flash Cannon, as well as neuter setup sweepers with Haze and scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Galarian Darmanitan. Vileplume can switch into Mold Breaker Excadrill's Earthquake and remove pressure by checking Ground-type Pokemon with its defensive typing, Giga Drain, and Strength Sap. Skuntank provides a crucial Psychic immunity, meaning it can switch into and pick off Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Alolan Raichu, and Indeedee with Sucker Punch. Skuntank can also run Defog, freeing up Galarian Weezing to run Clear Smog or Flamethrower. Other offensive Pokemon such as Toxitricity and Gengar are able to beat faster threats such as Pelipper, Corviknight, and Obstagoon that Galarian Weezing struggles against.</p> "

One of these forms of utility is its access to Stealth Rock, which can allow it to assist its teammates by chipping down opposing threats, making it easier to revenge kill them. Seismic Toss allows Chansey to not be completely passive, which lets it wear down opposing special attackers very quickly and break most Substitutes. These two moves paired with the amazing recovery of Soft-Boiled allow Chansey to wear down types that rely on their special attackers, namely Electric, Poison, and Psychic. Teleport can be used on its last slot to help Chansey act as a great pivot and get its offensive teammates in safely, or it can use Toxic to put opposing offensive Pokemon on a timer and make it harder for your opponent to keep them in. Its ability in Natural Cure also allows it to absorb status ailments for its offensive teammates and works well with Teleport when scouting for status moves. Chansey invests its EVs in bulk and Defense so that it can take physical hits better, especially from weaker revenge killers like Choice Scarf Excadrill.</p> <p>Every other Pokemon on Normal appreciates Chansey's ability to wall special attackers like Hydreigon, Indeedee-M, and Hatterene. Offensive Pokemon like Indeedee-M, Diggersby, Bewear, Obstagoon, and Heliolisk especially appreciate its Teleport support, as they can immediately threaten the opposing team with their dangerous power once switched in. Indeedee-M can force out dangerous Fighting-types like Conkeldurr and Keldeo with a Choice Scarf while also breaking down opposing walls like Toxapex and Amoonguss thanks to Expanding Force's power. Diggersby, Obstagoon, and Bewear coming in for free can also be a huge boon against opposing bulky teams, as they give most defensive cores in the game a very hard time. Heliolisk also appreciates Teleport pivoting greatly, as it can threaten to KO Keldeo, which is a massive threat to Chansey thanks to its Secret Sword and also has a great matchup against opposing Water-type teams. Outside of Teleport, Porygon2 is Chansey's preferred partner thanks to its ability to wear down physical attackers and complete the Eviolite defensive core. This physical wall appreciates Chansey's ability to wear down special attackers that threaten Porygon2, and in return it walls the physical attackers like Mimikyu that threaten Chansey. Ditto is also a great Pokemon on Normal that can beat out certain setup sweepers or wallbreakers that try to take advantage of Chansey's passive nature, such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Shell Smash Cloyster.</p> "

After a Dragon Dance, Gyarados OHKOes almost every Water-type with Power Whip and can beat Toxapex one-on-one. Because Water teams are typically good at setting Stealth Rock against Flying, it is important to give Gyarados Heavy-Duty Boots in order to make sure it is as healthy as possible when attempting to sweep. While often used to handle Water, Gyarados is effective in other matchups too; for example, Ground teams have no defensive answer to the perfect Water + Grass coverage that Gyarados uses. While Gyarados is very powerful against Fire teams, keep in mind that sun halves Waterfall's damage output, it will find much more success if Torkoal is either removed or weakened before attempting to sweep. Intimidate is preferred in order to give Gyarados more opportunities to set up, as the matchups it is most effective in only require a single Attack boost, but Moxie is another option to make sweeping slightly easier if Gyarados can find a KO.</p> <p>Gyarados is fairly self-sufficient in its particular matchups and doesn't rely on its teammates for too much. However, Xatu's dual screens make it much easier to set up. Gyarados fits best on teams that use one or two Pokemon to cover each matchup, so Pokemon like Corviknight that are extremely effective against types, such as Steel, that it struggles with are especially useful. While Gyarados does not require Defog support, Mandibuzz can still act as a support Pokemon with its slow U-turn to bring it in safely on setup fodder.

At +1, it is left outsped by fast Pokemon such as Zeraora and Dragapult if running an Adamant nature, and many Choice Scarf users even with Jolly. Once it has revealed its moveset, it becomes easier to check, as, if it's lacking Earthquake, it gets walled by Heatran and neutered by Haze Toxapex, whereas without Fire Punch it can't touch Pokemon such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn. Dragonite may also struggle to find safe opportunities to switch in because it risks getting its Multiscale broken.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Multiscale allows Dragonite to tank most unboosted hits from full health, and Heavy-Duty Boots keeps it from getting chipped by Stealth Rock; this endurance makes Dragonite a fearsome setup sweeper.

Flying-type teams also appreciate its part-Dragon typing, which gives it many notable resistances, including Water and Fire against Pokemon such as Urshifu-R, Volcarona, and Victini. It also gives a neutrality to Electric. However, Dragonite has very limited opportunities to safely switch into the field due to the risk of breaking Multiscale.

Belly Drum alongside Aqua Jet allows Azumarill to clean through the opponent's team with its priority. Knock Off allows Azumarill to hit Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex and support the team by removing items such as Chansey's Eviolite. Substitute is used to dodge status from Pokemon such as Toxapex and Torkoal, allowing Azumarill to more securely set up Belly Drum. Play Rough hits Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Pokemon that resist Aqua Jet such as Keldeo. 4 HP EVs ensure that Azumarill can always use its Sitrus Berry after a Belly Drum. An Adamant nature allows it to threaten Ferrothorn and Toxapex after using Belly Drum. Belly Drum is most ideally set up behind the dual screens that Klefki provides, and setting up two layers of Spikes with Klefki allows Azumarill to always OHKO Ferrothorn and Toxapex after a Belly Drum by using Knock Off. Additionally, Azumarill should use Substitute whenever a slower Pokemon can only threaten it with status, such as Toxapex running Toxic.</p> <p>Klefki offers mandatory support for Azumarill, as it provides dual screens for Azumarill to set up Belly Drum more easily, and its Spikes support allows Azumarill to clean more easily late-game. Klefki can also check threats such as Scizor with Foul Play. Togekiss paired with Azumarill allows Fairy teams to take on the Steel matchup, with Togekiss breaking through Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory with Fire Blast and Azumarill cleaning through the rest of the team with Belly Drum in tandem with Knock Off for Corviknight and Aqua Jet for Excadrill. Togekiss can also break through Grass-type Pokemon such as Rillaboom for Azumarill and break past stall Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mandibuzz with tools such as Nasty Plot and Thunder Wave. Hatterene can take on Poison-type Pokemon for Azumarill such as Toxapex and Galarian Weezing as well as block hazards that could add to Belly Drum's health penalty thanks to Magic Bounce. Galarian Weezing can provide fantastic support for Azumarill by setting Toxic Spikes to wear down checks such as Bewear and absorbing the opponent's Toxic Spikes. Additionally, Galarian Weezing can burn physical attackers such as Diggersby. Mimikyu and Grimmsnarl form a physical setup core with Azumarill, as they are able to use Swords Dance and Bulk Up to help Azumarill in both the Psychic and Electric matchups. Additionally, both have strong priority, making the team less dependent on Azumarill's priority to check a multitude of threats including Volcarona, Alolan Raichu, and Gengar. Lastly, Gardevoir can provide Azumarill with a second chance to sweep with Healing Wish.</p> "

Mantine also enjoys having Lanturn on its team, as it provides an Electric immunity and Heal Bell support while also taking on Choice Specs Zapdos more reliably and providing slow Volt Switch support to the team. However, it should be noted that Lanturn is primarily seen on stall teams.

    "overview": "<h1>Steel</h1> <p>Skarmory's typing allows it to easily find itself a spot in Steel teams for providing the much-needed Ground immunity and Fighting neutrality. Skarmory has access to Spikes, making it the primary setter for its team while freeing up Ferrothorn to run more utility options such as Thunder Wave and Stealth Rock. Its high Defense stat and great typing allow Skarmory to check various physically offensive Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Urshifu-R with the help of Roost, Rocky Helmet, and Toxic. Moreover, having access to Roost and Toxic sets Skarmory apart from its competitors in Celesteela and Corviknight. Skarmory is an easy target for Electric-types such as Zapdos and Zeraora, which can grab momentum against Skarmory with their respective coverage. Furthermore, Skarmory can be trapped and eliminated by Magnezone, which enables a safer win route for Bulk Up Zeraora, and it is also vulnerable to Fire-type attacks from Pokemon such as Victini, Blacephalon, and Volcarona, which all pose a threat to it. Skarmory's Special Defense is low, making it weak to common special attackers in the tier such as Blacephalon, Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Kyurem. Being unable to touch any Ghost-type Pokemon outside of Toxic causes Skarmory to lose momentum heavily, especially against Substitute users such as non-Choice Specs Aegislash, Dragapult, and Spectrier, which all force it out.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Often appearing on balance teams, Skarmory's incredible Defense stat allows it to check many physical attackers such as Melmetal and Bisharp for its teammates. Due to its excellent typing, Skarmory can provide a key neutrality to Ice-type attacks, allowing it to check powerful Ice-types such as Mamoswine and Weavile. Skarmory's access to Spikes, Whirlwind, and Roost allows it to carve out a niche for itself on Flying teams. As a result of its low HP and Special Defense, Skarmory is unable to tank resisted hits from special attackers such as Choice Specs Kyurem and Choice Specs Tapu Lele and can be worn down by walls using special attacking moves like Scald from Toxapex. Skarmory faces competition from Corviknight and Celesteela, as they both share the same typing. Corviknight and Celesteela can tank both physical and special attacks, while Skarmory is relegated to tanking physical attacks.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Skarmory serves as the primary Spikes setter for its team, allowing offensive teammates such as Bisharp and Excadrill to wallbreak more consistently throughout the game. Body Press synergizes well with Skarmory's bulk and is especially helpful in the mirror matchup against Pokemon such as Bisharp, Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Heatran on the switch, as well against Dark-types such as Weavile, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon. Roost helps Skarmory to stay healthy throughout the match against foes such as Urshifu-R, Excadrill, and Tyranitar. Whirlwind is used to prevent setup from Pokemon such as Garchomp and Dragapult while also generating passive chip damage if Spikes were set beforehand. Toxic can be used over Whirlwind to cripple Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Mantine. Rocky Helmet complements Skarmory's physical bulk and typing excellently, as contact move users such as Urshifu-R and Weavile as well as U-turn and Flip Turn users such as Landorus-T, Scizor, Swampert, and Barraskewda will all be worn down by it. Sturdy allows Skarmory to set Spikes or use Toxic on a foe that can knock it out from full health if necessary. Furthermore, Sturdy allows Skarmory to deal damage against troublesome Pokemon that threaten Steel teams, such as Hydreigon. An Impish nature and maximum HP and Defense investment make Skarmory as tanky as possible against the aforementioned physical threats such as Urshifu-R, Excadrill, and Landorus-T.</p> <p>Having access to Spikes makes Skarmory a valuable teammate, as it allows its offensive teammates such as Excadrill, Aegislash, Melmetal, and Bisharp to have an easier time against common walls such as Toxapex, Porygon2, and Ferrothorn. Ferrothorn is one of the best teammates for Skarmory, as the duo form an effective entry hazard-stacking core with Ferrothorn's Stealth Rock. Furthermore, Skarmory can make up for Ferrothorn's weakness to Fighting, while Ferrothorn takes care of Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Rotom-W for Skarmory and provides a resistance to Water. Heatran provides the much-needed Fire immunity against Pokemon like Blacephalon and Hydreigon, while Skarmory can take on Ground-type attacks such as Earthquake from Garchomp and Excadrill. Furthermore, Heatran's common moves in Toxic and Magma Storm can deal immense chip damage when combined with Skarmory's Spikes. Excadrill takes care of Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Zeraora if it is holding a Choice Scarf and can remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin to preserve Skarmory's Sturdy. Aegislash makes a good partner for Skarmory, as it relieves the pressure from Skarmory to handle Fighting-type attacks. This is especially important against Choice-locked foes such as Urshifu-R, which will have to avoid being heavily punished by Skarmory's Rocky Helmet. Furthermore, Aegislash helps greatly against Psychic-types such as Hatterene and Tapu Lele, which Skarmory generally struggle against. Bisharp's ability in Defiant also deters Defog from Pokemon such as Mantine and Zapdos, and its typing allows it to shine against Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Galarian Slowking, Slowking, Galarian Corsola, and Spectrier.</p> "

Whirlwind can be used over it to phaze opposing setup sweepers such as Bisharp and Dragon Dance Dragapult. In conjunction with Skarmory's bulk it can be used to shuffle opposing teams, slowly damaging them via Spikes. Body Press uses Skarmory's enormous Defense stat to hit threats such as Galarian Darmanitan and Tyranitar. Roost provides Skarmory with reliable recovery, allowing it to preserve Sturdy as well as consistently providing an answer to foes such as Cloyster and Excadrill. Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers as well as pivots that use Flip Turn and U-turn by taking a chunk of their HP. Leftovers allows Skarmory to gain passive recovery, which it in turn gives it more chances to use its ability Sturdy. Sturdy is Skarmory's best ability, as it can allow Skarmory to survive attacks from foes such as Heliolisk and Volcarona when at full HP, and it can proceed to OHKO the former with Body Press. Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature allows Skarmory to be as bulky as possible, as well as boosting the power of Body Press.</p> <p>Mantine is an excellent teammate for Skarmory, as its superb Special Defense allows it to wall special attackers such as Volcarona, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Hydreigon. In return, Skarmory is able to handle foes like Dragonite and Dragapult. Skarmory appreciates the presence of Landorus-T to OHKO threats such as Tapu Koko and Zapdos. Landorus-T can also switch in on foes such as Zapdos after it has been Choice-locked into Thunderbolt. Skarmory then reciprocates this by acting as a switch-in to physical attackers such as Mamoswine that would otherwise OHKO Landorus-T with Icicle Crash. Defensive Zapdos can provide a key neutrality to Electric-type attacks as well as act as a special wall, taking attacks from foes such as Tapu Koko under Electric Terrain. Moreover, it can run a Toxic + Substitute set to wear down opposing walls such as Mandibuzz that Skarmory would find hard to deal with. Skarmory can then assist Zapdos by taking on potent physical attackers such as Swords Dance Terrakion that Zapdos would otherwise fall to. Zapdos can also run a Choice Specs set that appreciates Skarmory's ability to wear down foes such as Slowking with Spikes. Teammates such as Choice Band Galarian Zapdos and Galarian Moltres appreciate the presence of Spikes on the field, with the former potentially OHKOing foes such as Slowbro, Slowking, and Mew and the latter becoming a much more potent sweeper, being able to guarantee an OHKO on foes such as Slowking. In return, Galarian Zapdos is able to prevent foes from removing Spikes via Defog carelessly due to Defiant. Galarian Moltres is able to check the fearsome Spectrier that would otherwise OHKO Skarmory after it has been inflicted with a status condition. Thundurus-T and Dragonite are also good teammates for Skarmory, as both are helped by Spikes chipping away at their respective checks, and the former can absorb Electric-type attacks for it. Knock Off users such as Tornadus-T allow teammates to take advantage of Skarmory's entry hazards, as it can force foes that normally run Heavy-Duty Boots such as Victini and Cinderace to switchin less often. Moreover, Tornadus-T can use Taunt on opposing Defog users such as Mantine and Corviknight to prevent them from ridding the field of Skarmory's Spikes.</p> "

Choice Specs strengthens Kingdra's subpar Special Attack to allow it to act as an amazing sweeper and wallbreaker. Under rain, Surf is Kingdra's go-to move, as it is capable of OHKOing certain Pokemon like Zeraora and Urshifu-S. Dragon Pulse is used in situations where Kingdra has to deal safe and reliable damage to Pokemon like Kyurem, Toxapex, and Mantine that may resist or be immune to its Water-type moves. Draco Meteor acts as a nuke towards Pokemon like Keldeo and Amoonguss that would normally eat up whatever Kingdra has to throw at it. Hydro Pump can be used in order to break through Pokemon like Porygon2 and even has a chance to OHKO stallbreaker Mew and Aegislash under rain. Hurricane is also an option over Hydro Pump, as Hurricane is reliable under rain and can potentially OHKO opposing Grass-types such as Virizion, Whimsicott, and Celebi, to name a few.

Pelipper can also run a Choice Specs set to help Kingdra break through Grass-types if Kingdra does not have Hurricane in its moveset. Eject Button Toxapex can also serve as a pivot that is able to support Kingdra by weakening bulkier Pokemon like Porygon2 and Chansey through Toxic Spikes or Toxic support. Pokemon like Tentacruel, Pelipper, and Rotom-W are Pokemon that can be used for entry hazard control and help Kingdra stay healthy throughout the game. Slowking can also be included in the team, as it can pivot Kingdra or other teammates in safely while acting as a special wall at the same time. Seismitoad can also be paired up with Kingdra, as it can set up Stealth Rock to weaken checks to Kingdra like Porygon2 and Chansey while providing an Electric immunity to the team. Late-game sweepers like Choice Band Azumarill, Choice Scarf Dracovish, Keldeo, and Shell Smash Cloyster also appreciate Kingdra's wallbreaking abilities, while they deal with Pokemon like Chansey, Ferrothorn, Jellicent, and Toxapex, which are otherwise hard for Kingdra to deal with.</p> "

Foul Play acts both as a countermeasure for Pokemon like Scizor and Azumarill that would otherwise use Porygon2 as setup bait and as an attacking move to hit other powerful physical threats like Alolan Marowak and Excadrill. Ice Beam gives Porygon2 good coverage to deal with Dragon threats like Hydreigon and Noivern more easily as well as certain other offensive threats like Diggersby and Hawlucha. Toxic allows Porygon2 to wear down defensive Pokemon like Mandibuzz and Gastrodon that may otherwise attempt to switch in. Teleport is another option to be considered, as it allows Porygon2 to bring in frail offensive Normal-type threats like Diggersby, Heliolisk, and Indeedee-M safely and create momentum. Discharge can be an option to run over Toxic as good coverage for hitting Flying- and Water-type threats like Corviknight and Pelipper with a sizable chance to paralyze notable threats for Normal teams such as Calm Mind Keldeo and Bulk Up Urshifu-R, which would otherwise use Porygon2 as setup fodder.

Ditto and Porygon2 also work well together due to their ability to PP stall Poison and Water teams by copying Regenerator from Pokemon such as Toxapex and Amoonguss. Heliolisk provides Porygon2 with an easier time against Water due to its great ability in Dry Skin for absorbing powerful Water-type attacks from wallbreakers like Dracovish. Bewear appreciates Porygon2's ability to mitigate its low Speed by paralyzing faster Pokemon like Hydreigon and Kyurem with Discharge.

It is also able to effectively stall out menacing attacks like Tapu Bulu's Horn Leech with Pressure. Due to its lack of reliable recovery, Suicune is extremely vulnerable to entry hazards, status, and other chip damage leaving it unable to reliably switch into attacks. In addition, having Scald as its only offensive move makes it vulnerable to Water-immune Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Mantine. Furthermore, Suicune's heavy reliance on Leftovers makes it extremely vulnerable to Knock Off.</p> ",

Protect adds passive recovery via Leftovers and works with Substitute and Pressure to PP stall foes; Protect also allows Suicune to scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Rillaboom, Tapu Lele, and Latios. Substitute can also be used to block status conditions such as poison and burn that would nullify Suicune's passive recovery and therefore prevent it from effectively PP stalling. It can create a Substitute for free on Pokemon like defensive Celesteela. Suicune's HP investment allows it to form a Substitute with 101 HP, which doesn't break after one Night Shade or Seismic Toss from Galarian Corsola or Blissey.</p> <p>Toxapex is able to provide Toxic Spikes support, which helps Suicune stall out its foes. In addition, it can stop setup sweepers like Bisharp with Haze. Swampert provides an Electric immunity to the team and phazes setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Dragapult with Roar. Furthermore, Swampert can set Stealth Rock, which helps Suicune wear down opposing teams. Urshifu-R is good to break past many potential checks to Suicune, such as Water-immune Pokemon such as Cradily, Seismitoad, and Mantine, with Close Combat and Thunder Punch. Tapu Fini provides a Dragon immunity while also setting up Misty Terrain, which prevents Suicune from becoming statused, and threatening Suicune's Dragon-type checks like Latios and Hydreigon. In turn, Suicune can assist Tapu Fini by spreading burns and PP stalling its checks such as Skuntank. Choice Scarf Tapu Fini also helps to weaken foes with Trick and Knock Off. Mantine not only removes hazards like Toxic Spikes, but also offers a Ground immunity. In addition, it provides a key neutrality to Grass. Mantine also has Haze to stifle setup Pokemon like Belly Drum Azumarill and Volcarona. Slowking assists Suicune and the team by filling the role of a specially defensive pivot, bringing in Suicune with ease and countering Pokemon it struggles against such as Toxapex and Toxicroak. Teammates with Heal Bell like Vaporeon help with Suicune's vulnerability to status chip damage.</p> "

Heavy Slam deals with Fairy-types like Hatterene and Galarian Weezing, while Fire Punch is particularly useful to hit Ferrothorn reliably. Substitute is also an option to set up more easily on weaker Pokemon like Torkoal, Toxapex, and Galarian Weezing, and Leftovers is used along with it to gain passive recovery. Lum Berry prevents Tyranitar from being crippled by the likes of Toxapex, Slowking, and Salazzle. Tyranitar should use its good bulk paired with Sand Stream to set up easily on special attackers like Dragalge and Rotom-H as well as passive Pokemon like Amoonguss.

Taunt can also prevent entry hazards from slower leads such as Skarmory, which helps Tyranitar stay healthy. Hydreigon can weaken physically defensive Pokemon like Bewear, Corviknight, and Hippowdon for Tyranitar, making it an important wallbreaker. Mandibuzz can use Defog to get rid of hazards like Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes, which would otherwise make Tyranitar easier to revenge kill.

Urshifu-S can threaten Steel teams for Tyranitar with its powerful STAB move combination and pick off faster threats such as Barraskewda and Choice Scarf Jirachi with Sucker Punch. Grimmsnarl provides useful dual screens for Tyranitar, which allows it to set up on Pokemon like Charizard and Kyurem more safely throughout the match. Drapion and Bisharp are able to help against problematic Fairy-types like Primarina, Grimmsnarl, Galarian Weezing, and Mimikyu so Tyranitar can forego Heavy Slam. Additionally, Drapion can spread status with Toxic Spikes, which is useful for preventing Electric teams from switching in freely.</p> "

Also, a teammate such as Toxic Spikes Drapion helps it by spreading status, but note that Sableye would then not be able to burn Pokemon like Mamoswine when they are already poisoned. Wallbreakers such as Hydreigon, Bisharp, and Grimmsnarl are also good teammates for Sableye, being able to clean more easily with Sableye preventing hazards being set and wearing down the enemy team. Bisharp and Drapion also help in the Fairy matchup, which is a matchup problematic for Dark. Grimmsnarl also helps Sableye versus other Dark teams due to Dark-type's immunity to Prankster.</p> "

This, along with reliable recovery in Recover, makes it hard to beat for many teams alike. Generally, Taunt should be used to block setup, recovery, entry hazards, and status, and should be used in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off to break down many different Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Corviknight, and more. Be aware that Prankster Will-O-Wisp is especially useful for crippling faster offensive threats that Ghost teams hate dealing with such as Excadrill, Barraskewda, and Dracozolt. Maximum HP and Special Defense investment ensures Sableye is as specially bulky as possible, and it can cripple physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp just fine.</p> <p>The entire Ghost team appreciates Sableye's ability to block entry hazard setters from setting entry hazards using Taunt, seeing as Ghost teams typically do not carry entry hazard control. Galarian Corsola aids Sableye defensively, as it is also able to cripple Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp and take on more threatening wallbreakers like Mamoswine, Diggersby and Excadrill more comfortably with its sturdy bulk. Offensive Ghost-type Pokemon like Gengar, Polteageist, Mimikyu, Dragapult, and Aegislash appreciate Sableye's ability to stallbreak and soften up the opposition, making it easier for them to sweep.</p> "

Its part-Steel typing gives a neutrality against Bug-type attacks and allows it to pivot into Toxic. Ferrothorn also deals with physical attackers like Excadrill for Cradily, while Cradily deals with special attackers like Nidoking in return.

Choice Scarf Rillaboom is great to pair with Roserade due to its access to Knock Off to weaken the foe, Superpower to hit Steel-types such as Bisharp and Lucario, and U-turn to help pressure Psychic-types and bring in a teammate safely. Appletun also makes for a great teammate due to its part-Dragon-typing and great Special Defense, which allows it to come in on Fire-type attacks for Roserade while forming a good duo with Ferrothorn due to it being able to come in on Ice-type attacks. Rotom-C makes for a great partner due to being able to take on Flying-type Pokemon such as Corviknight and Mandibuzz with Nasty Plot and Thunderbolt. Whimsicott is a much-needed teammate due to its part-Fairy-typing, allowing it to help greatly in the Dragon- and Dark-type matchup. It can also help with weakening teams by using Leech Seed, which forces switches; Whimsicott and Ferrothorn appreciate Roserade's entry hazards, as it helps wear down the opposing team, and makes it easier for Roserade to clean late-game. Whimsicott can also be used for Sunny Day to make Venusaur turn into a fearful Chlorophyll sweeper with Growth and Weather Ball to help greatly with Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Bisharp.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Ground</h1> <p>Due to Storm Drain and its solid mixed bulk, Gastrodon provides a vital Water immunity for Ground teams, allowing it to wall troublesome Pokemon like Barraskewda, Rotom-W, and Keldeo. This is very beneficial for its teammates, as Gastrodon can prevent Water-type moves from being spammed and force the opponent to play around it. Its access to Recover also gives it a huge edge over Seismitoad, since it can consistently wall the aforementioned threats without being too affected by chip damage. A neutrality to Ice allows Gastrodon to repeatedly take hits from threats to Ground teams such as Weavile, Galarian Darmanitan, and Mamoswine as well. Storm Drain's Special Attack boost can also help make Gastrodon less passive, allowing it to fire off powerful Scalds. However, replacing Seismitoad means that Gastrodon can be taken advantage of by a huge threat in Azumarill, which is able to OHKO it with Knock Off after a Belly Drum boost, proceeding to possibly sweep the rest of the entire team. Gastrodon is typically passive and can be almost completely useless against foes like Substitute Hydreigon, Substitute Kyurem, Tapu Bulu, and Zarude. Despite having solid mixed bulk, Gastrodon can be exploited by many powerful wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Rillaboom, and Crawdaunt due to Knock Off.</p> ",

Float Stone is also an alternative item to weaken Grass Knot from foes like Alolan Raichu, Tapu Koko, and Thundurus-T.

        "description": "<p>While Earth Power is useful because of Gastrodon's higher Special Attack, Earthquake is preferred over it to break Keldeo and Dragapult's Substitute. Scald can cripple many physical attackers such as Weavile, Bisharp, Galarian Darmanitan, and Dragonite due to its decent burn chance. Toxic is able to cripple many switch-ins and foes that Gastrodon wouldn't be able to deal with otherwise such as Latios, Latias, Rotom-W, and Mantine. Recover is mandatory to heal off damage from threats like Barraskewda, Keldeo, and Kingdra, letting it consistently check them. Leftovers gives Gastrodon extra recovery in order to preserve its health better. A physically defensive spread allows Gastrodon to take hits from foes like Secret Sword Keldeo, Barraskewda, and Weavile better. Avoid getting Gastrodon too weakened by moves or status conditions like Toxic, since it will be unable to consistently wall Pokemon and may get KOed by Water-type Pokemon with other STAB moves like Urshifu-R and Kingdra.</p> <p>Hippowdon forms a decent defensive core with Gastrodon, as its Sand Stream and access to Stealth Rock make it capable of wearing down foes easily. Excadrill is an excellent offensive partner that can pressure foes that give Gastrodon trouble like Latias, Zarude, Tapu Lele, Kyurem, and Tapu Bulu and function even more effectively under Hippowdon's sand. It can also remove troublesome entry hazards for Gastrodon with Rapid Spin. Mamoswine is able to revenge kill fast Dragon-, Grass-, and Flying-types that give Gastrodon trouble such as Dragapult, Hydreigon, Zarude, and Thundurus-T with Ice Shard, making it a useful wallbreaker. Nidoking is particularly useful for its ability to absorb Toxic Spikes for Gastrodon and KO problematic foes like Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Skarmory due to its excellent coverage and good power with Life Orb and Sheer Force. Choice Scarf Landorus-T can outspeed and revenge kill wallbreakers that Gastrodon struggles against such as Spectrier, Tapu Lele, and Gengar while removing entry hazards for it with Defog. Swords Dance Garchomp is a great wallbreaker that breaks past bulky foes such as Slowking, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela with Fire Fang while providing a useful Grass neutrality for Gastrodon. Choice Scarf Krookodile is an option to deal with Psychic- and Ghost-types that Gastrodon dislikes dealing with such as Tapu Lele, Celebi, Dragapult, and Spectrier.</p> "

Earthquake allows Gastrodon to effectively damage Electric-type Pokemon like Alolan Raichu and Zeraora that otherwise threaten Water-type teams, as well as breaking Substitutes from Pokemon such as Keldeo, Primarina, Dragapult, Jirachi, and Aegislash. Scald is useful for burning physical attackers like Excadrill, Scolipede, and Hawlucha, whereas Toxic can badly poison a number of Pokemon such as an opposing Gastrodon, Galarian Corsola, and Araquanid. Recover and Leftovers allow Gastrodon to stay healthy to continue spreading status ailments and serve as a defensive pivot. However, Float Stone with maximum Special Defense investment is nice for taking on Grass Knot Heliolisk and Alolan Raichu, while Heavy-Duty Boots is valuable for avoiding entry hazard damage, particularly Toxic Spikes. Storm Drain is useful to avoid Scald burns from Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mantine, while Sticky Hold is great for Knock Off users such as Bisharp, Crawdaunt, and Weavile. Maximum HP and Defense investment allows it to better take on physical attackers such as Zeraora and Excadrill.</p> <p>The entire team appreciates Gastrodon's role in absorbing Electric-type attacks; therefore, it fits on more balanced teams with Pokemon like Toxapex, Azumarill, Slowking, and Mantine. Toxapex is a glue on every Water team, as it provides utility with Knock Off, Toxic, and Toxic Spikes, and it can spread status effects just like Gastrodon. Azumarill offers a nice immunity to Grass-type attacks from Pokemon like Rillaboom and Ferrothorn and pairs well with Gastrodon, since that is its only weakness. Slowking helps with special attackers like Hatterene, Togekiss, Substitute Kyurem, and Psychic-type Pokemon that may try to use Expanding Force under Psychic Terrain against Gastrodon , while Mantine prevents special attackers like Volcarona, Hatterene, and Chandelure from setting up and sweep with Haze. In return, Gastrodon helps with physical attackers along with Toxapex thanks to their amazing Defense stats. Keldeo helps against Normal-, Ice-, and Steel-types such as Blissey, Kyurem, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn that wall Gastrodon with Secret Sword. Primarina helps with Dark-, Dragon- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Keldeo thanks to its Fairy-type STAB moves, as well as beating passive defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Toxic Aegislash with Substitute and Calm Mind. Rotom-W is a nice revenge killer to Flying- and Water-type teams with Thunderbolt and offers a Ground immunity along with entry hazard removal with Defog.</p> "

Poison Jab does a fantastic job of handling Grass-types such as Appletun and the aforementioned Psychic-types. Sucker Punch is used to punish Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Dragapult, Jirachi, and Alolan Raichu. However, it must be used with caution in the Psychic matchup, as Jirachi's common teammate Indeedee-M blocks Skuntank from using Sucker Punch with Psychic Terrain. Defog gets rid of entry hazards while freeing Galarian Weezing from running it and removing Electric Terrain and Psychic Terrain. Protect is used to scout for moves from Choice-locked Pokemon such as Jirachi and Excadrill while also providing an additional turn of Black Sludge recovery. Aftermath is picked to punish foes that heavily depend on contact moves, such as Dracovish, Bisharp, Jirachi, and Weavile, and common U-turn users such as Dragapult and Celebi.</p> <p>Galarian Weezing is a good partner with its ability Levitate, allowing it to be immune to Ground-type attacks from foes such as non-Mold Breaker Excadrill, Seismitoad, and Hippowdon. Galarian Weezing also provides Will-O-Wisp support, which can be used to cripple physically offensive Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Weavile. In return, Skuntank frees Galarian Weezing from running Defog, which creates space for coverage options such as Flamethrower and Fire Blast. Vileplume forms a solid defensive core with Skuntank with its physical bulk and Strength Sap. Moreover, with its Ground neutrality, Vileplume provides a switch-in to Mold Breaker Excadrill by always taking two unboosted attacks, and with Skuntank's Defog, Vileplume switches into Excadrill even more safely. Toxapex is a fantastic defensive pivot for many offensive Pokemon such as non-Taunt Keldeo, Dracovish, and Mimikyu. Between Toxic, Baneful Bunker, and Toxic Spikes, Toxapex comes with great potential to spread poison, which can be further exploited with Skuntank's Protect. Salazzle benefits well from Skuntank, as Skuntank can Defog entry hazards for Salazzle. This allows Salazzle to use the combination of Substitute + Toxic relatively safely and to threaten Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Aegislash with its Flamethrower. Furthermore, Salazzle can take out Choice Scarf Excadrill if it's behind Substitute. In return, Salazzle takes advantage of defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Mandibuzz, which Skuntank struggles against. Skuntank also helps with Toxic damage accumulation with its Protect. With its good coverage, Gengar takes out Pokemon that have the potential to exploit Skuntank, such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight. In return, Skuntank can switch into Ghost-type attacks for Gengar. Drapion can be used as a fast teammate to take out other Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Gardevoir. Furthermore, its Knock Off can remove items from foes such as Galarian Corsola, Corviknight, and Toxapex.</p> "

Garchomp's Speed tier allows it to excel as a cleaner and wallbreaker, taking on threats such as Urshifu-R, Kyurem, Mimikyu, Mew, and Tapu Fini. Its Dragon typing helps it tank Water- and Grass-type attacks from threats such as Rillaboom and Urshifu-R, which potentially allows Garchomp to stop a sweep.

Scale Shot boosts Garchomp's Speed, allowing it to revenge kill faster threats such as Tapu Koko, but it drops Garchomp's Defense and makes it vulnerable to priority attacks such as Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Bisharp's Sucker Punch.

Garchomp and Excadrill also benefit from each other breaking down shared checks such as Slowbro and Mandibuzz, allowing the other an easier time sweeping. Gastrodon and Seismitoad offer Garchomp a Water immunity. Gastrodon is the more sustainable option, as it provides a more consistent switch-in to threats such as Barraskewda due to it having reliable recovery, while Seismitoad can deal with threats like Belly Drum Azumarill. Choice Scarf Landorus-T can revenge kill threats such as Dragapult and Tapu Koko, while Gravity Landorus-T allows both itself and Garchomp to check Celesteela, Skarmory, and Corviknight without relying on Fire Fang. Mamoswine takes on Flying-, Dragon-, and Grass-types such as Landorus-T, Latios, and Amoonguss with its powerful Ice-type attacks while also being able to revenge kill Pokemon such as Dragapult for Garchomp. Additionally, Mamoswine can remove items such as Slowbro's Heavy-Duty Boots and Tapu Lele's Choice Scarf, opening up avenues Garchomp to beat them. Nidoking can help Garchomp take on the Steel and Flying matchups, hitting all Steel-types with Earth Power + Flamethrower and all Flying-types with BoltBeam coverage, and take pressure off it. Nidoking can break through Pokemon such as Celesteela, Corviknight, and Skarmory for Garchomp; in return, Garchomp can break past special walls such as Blissey.

Make sure to preserve Air Balloon if the opponent has Excadrill so Magnezone can successfully trap and remove it.</p> <p>Powerful wallbreakers such as Tapu Koko, Choice Specs Zapdos, and Regieleki appreciate Magnezone trapping Steel-types such as Excadrill and Ferrothorn, making their STAB moves much more spammable against Steel teams. Tapu Koko deals with Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-types that Magnezone struggles against such as Galarian Zapdos, Hydreigon, and Garchomp thanks to its Fairy-type STAB attack. Additionally, it defeats Ground-types like Hippowdon, Swampert, and Seismitoad with Grass Knot. Zeraora deals with specially defensive walls that Magnezone fails to take on with Body Press, such as Galarian Slowking and SubToxic Aegislash. Alolan Raichu can outspeed almost the entire metagame under Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain, handling fast threats such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon, Choice Scarf Terrakion, Spectrier, and Volcarona for Magnezone. Additionally, it removes troublesome Poison- and Fighting-types such as Amoonguss, Keldeo, and Buzzwole with Psychic and takes on Ground-types such as Swampert and Gastrodon with Grass Knot. Zapdos and Rotom-W both appreciate Magnezone acting as an emergency check to Ground-types like Excadrill and Mamoswine with Air Balloon. Choice Specs Zapdos defeats Grass-types that can pressure Magnezone such as Rillaboom, Celebi, and Tapu Bulu while also nailing Dragon- and Ground-types such as Swampert, Kommo-o, and Hippowdon with its powerful Hurricane. Rotom-W provides useful resistances against Fire- and Water-type attacks, preventing Pokemon such as Blacephalon, Cinderace, and Barraskewda from breaking through Magnezone and the rest of the team.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Togekiss is an effective stallbreaker on Fairy teams that helps break down defensive types like Poison, Grass, and Steel. Its ability Serene Grace synergizes with Air Slash, allowing it to threaten defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Slowking, Amoonguss, Galarian Weezing, and Cradily. Furthermore, its Flying typing gives the team a secondary check to Grass- and Ground-types alongside Tapu Bulu, as it can check Rillaboom, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. After Nasty Plot, Togekiss becomes a threatening wallbreaker to slower and more defensive teams. However, Togekiss struggles to find a place on Fairy teams due to its mediocre physical bulk and middling Speed. Togekiss is often restricted from switching in freely, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and Fairy teams tend to lack Defoggers due to their preference to stack entry hazards with Klefki and Clefable. However, this can be mitigated by using Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> ",

Aura Sphere can be used over Substitute to threaten Heatran and Tyranitar, which otherwise wall this set. Nasty Plot increases Togekiss's wallbreaking power and allows it to OHKO Celesteela, Melmetal, and Tyranitar. If running Fire Blast, a Modest nature may be considered to OHKO Aegislash and Magnezone.

Dual screens also enable Belly Drum Azumarill, another setup sweeper that can be used in tandem with Togekiss to decimate Steel and Poison matchups. Azumarill also helps Togekiss by removing Rock-type Pokemon like Nihilego and Tyranitar with its strong Water-type attacks and specially defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking with Knock Off. Togekiss greatly appreciates fast pivots that can bring it in on a predicted switch. U-turn or Volt Switch Tapu Koko is especially good at this, as it invites walls such as Ferrothorn for Togekiss to take advantage of and provides a fast Taunt to prevent Stealth Rock from being set. Clefable provides Stealth Rock, which chips down Togekiss's targets and allows it to pick off defensive Pokemon more easily. Tapu Bulu handles Electric- and Rock-types like Rotom-W, Tapu Koko, and Tyranitar. Tapu Lele takes on faster Poison-types such as Nidoking and can take advantage of Togekiss's wallbreaking to clean late-game with Choice Scarf.</p> "

It also lets it clean up Flying and Dragon teams late-game when their walls have been sufficiently chipped. A Choice Band allows Mamoswine to OHKO walls such as Amoonguss, Zapdos, and Toxapex with the appropriate STAB move.

Gastrodon provides a Water immunity, can spread Toxic to wear down the opposing team, and can take special attacks aimed at Mamoswine. Alternatively, Seismitoad may be considered as the Water-immune partner, as it can check Azumarill, which usually poses a huge threat for Ground teams.

Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon are all easily set up on by Rotom-C, and other Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Excadrill have trouble revenge killing it due to Substitute. Nasty Plot allows Rotom-C to serve as a setup sweeper by beating Pokemon such as Hatterene, Bisharp, and Excadrill after a boost, while Subsitute also allows it to set up on status users such as Seismitoad, Pokemon that are unable to deal significant damage to Rotom-C such as Toxapex, and forced switches, as well as helping against Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Thunderbolt is valuable coverage that hits Pokemon such as Corviknight and Toxapex for super effective damage, as well as Pokemon like Aegislash, Bisharp, Jirachi, Salazzle, and Galarian Weezing neutrally. Leaf Storm is Rotom-C's stronger STAB attack that hits the aforementioned Ground-type Pokemon and can beat bulkier Pokemon, such as Mew, Hatterene, and Gardevoir, with a Nasty Plot boost. Although its bulk is not the best, Rotom-C can serve as an answer to certain offensive Pokemon using its typing, such as Barraskewda and Seismitoad under rain, but shouldn't set up on other hard-hitting offensive Pokemon such as Indeedee and Dragapult that threaten to OHKO or heavily dent it.</p> <p>The entirety of Electric appreciates Rotom-C's ability to serve as a reliable answer to Ground-type Pokemon, seeing as Electric teams struggle immensely against them otherwise. In return, Sticky Web setters such as Galvantula and Vikavolt are good partners for Rotom-C, as they patch up its middling Speed and allow it to outspeed Pokemon such as Choice Specs Indeedee, Choice Scarf Gardevoir, Choice Specs Gengar, and Mimikyu, paving the way for it to sweep. Choice Band Zeraora is a fantastic wallbreaker that can take on faster Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Cinderace, and Dragapult and forms an offensive core with Rotom-C. Zeraora's ability to wallbreak early-game and beat Dragon- and Steel-type Pokemon with Play Rough, Plasma Fists, and Close Combat is fantastic for Rotom-C to sweep weakened teams or vice versa. Toxtricity is another special attacker that can beat Grass-type Pokemon such as Whimsicott, Vileplume, and Roserade for Rotom-C. Alolan Raichu is a powerful wallbreaker that can outspeed and beat threats such as Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, Choice Scarf Gengar, and Choice Scarf Excadrill for Rotom-C under Electric Terrain. Pincurchin can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes as well as use Memento to weaken the opponent and bring Rotom-C in for it to set up and sweep. Morpeko is amazing against Psychic and Ghost teams and can bring Rotom-C in with Parting Shot while the stat drops help it set up. Morpeko can also break screens, which limit Rotom-C’s sweeping potential, with Psychic Fangs.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Rotom-C's useful Electric typing, access to Nasty Plot, good Special Attack, and average Speed stat allow it to help out greatly with Flying-types and become a fearsome setup sweeper. Nasty Plot allows Rotom-C to net OHKOs against bulkier Water- and Flying-types such as Toxapex and Corviknight. Use Substitute on passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex to avoid status and set up with Nasty Plot. Thunderbolt makes Rotom-C able to take on Flying-types such as Corviknight and Mandibuzz. Dark Pulse is used for neutral damage and greatly helping with Ferrothorn, Seismitoad, and Excadrill and Ghost- and Psychic-types like Aegislash and Celebi. Maximum HP makes it easier for Rotom-C to keep its Substitute while setting up on Ferrothorn, while maximum Speed with a Timid nature allows Rotom-C to outpace Togekiss.</p> <p>Rotom-C's appreciate its ability to be able to threaten Flying-types such as Pelipper and Corviknight. Rotom-C loves entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn and Roserade to sweep more easily mid- to late-game and in particular likes Ferrothorn thanks to its Steel typing allowing it to come in on Ice-type attacks. Appletun forms a good defensive core with Ferrothorn because its Dragon typing and Thick Fat makes it able to come in on Fire-type attacks from Pokemon like Dragapult and Charizard. Virizion makes a great partner due to its ability to take on Charizard and Centiskorch with Stone Edge, OHKO Alolan Ninetales with Smart Strike and Steel-type Pokemon like Excadrill. Leech Seed users such as Ferrothorn, Appletun, and Whimsicott are good partners for Rotom-C, as they wear down opposing Pokemon for it while helping it set up by providing it with more passive recovery. Whimsicott can be used for its Substitute + Leech Seed to chip Pokemon down and make it easier for Rotom-C to clean up. Whimsicott's Fairy typing and access to Moonblast also help greatly in the Dragon- and the Dark-type matchup with pressuring and taking care of Hydreigon and Grimmsnarl. Whimsicott can also use Heat Rock and Sunny Day to make Venusaur and Celebi turn into dangerous sweepers that greatly help in the Steel-type matchup, taking care of Pokemon that Rotom-C has trouble with such as Duraludon with Growth-boosted Weather Ball or Nasty Plot-boosted Earth Power .</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Steel</h1> <p>Heatran is a key Pokemon for Steel teams thanks to Flash Fire's ability to absorb Fire-type attacks such as V-create from Victini. Heatran has excellent typing with decent defensive stats, which contributes to its good special bulk. Heatran also has access to a variety of utility options; Toxic and Lava Plume allow it to cripple bulky Pokemon such as Mantine, Galarian Corsola, and Rotom-W, Taunt allows it to block utility moves like Leech Seed, Stealth Rock, and Recover from slower Pokemon such as Celesteela, Galarian Corsola, and Toxapex, and Stealth Rock lets Ferrothorn dedicate its slot to Spikes. However, Heatran's Fire typing compounds Steel teams' natural weaknesses; it stacks the Ground-type weakness for its team against foes like Garchomp and creates a weakness against Water-types such as Barraskewda. Heatran also has mediocre Speed and is forced to switch out against fast physical threats such as Urshifu-R, Barraskewda, Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. Heatran lacks proper recovery and is reliant on Leftovers, which directly affects its longevity during the battle as it doesn't like taking hits from other Pokemon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Heatran may opt for a trapper set by using Magma Storm over Lava Plume, allowing it to beat some of its checks such as Toxapex and Galarian Slowking with the help of Taunt.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types are generally bulky enough to take one or two hits from Heatran and OHKO it in return. Garchomp and Gastrodon especially resist Lava Plume and easily force out Heatran, but Ground-types need to be careful of status from Lava Plume and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Heatran's Water-type weakness is easily exploited by Water-types, as faster threats force it out, and Heatran cannot reliably break through bulkier Water-types. However, Toxapex is threatened by Earth Power, while Mantine and Swampert must watch out for Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion threaten to KO Heatran with their STAB moves.

        "description": "<p>Lava Plume is Heatran's most spammable STAB attack that comes with a 30% chance to burn the foe, which can be used to cripple Toxapex. Earth Power is used mainly for opposing Heatran and hits Toxapex as well as Electric-types such as Alolan Raichu and Tapu Koko. Toxic cripples foes that Heatran cannot reliably beat, like Mantine, Slowbro, and Porygon2. Heatran's excellent typing and natural bulk make it one of the best Stealth Rock setters, as it forces a lot of switches. However, Taunt allows it to be an effective stallbreaker if another teammate is carrying Stealth Rock. A specially defensive spread with a Calm nature gives Heatran a better matchup against foes such as Tornadus-T and Latios. Leftovers mitigates Heatran's lack of natural recovery. Flash Fire is the preferred ability, as it allows Heatran to absorb Fire-type attacks.</p> <p>Heatran's presence is appreciated by every Steel-type, as it is the only reliable answer to Fire-types such as Victini. Ferrothorn is one of Heatran's best teammates; Heatran can take Fire-type attacks for Ferrothorn, while Ferrothorn can take Water-type attacks for it and threaten Water-types with Power Whip. In addition, Ferrothorn's Spikes synergizes with Lava Plume and Toxic to accrue chip damage on foes, while Taunt from Heatran prevents Defog from foes like Mantine and maintains Spikes. Celesteela, Skarmory, and Corviknight all make good partners for Heatran, as their typing allows them to switch into Ground-type coverage directed at Heatran. Moreover, Celesteela heals Heatran with Leech Seed and helps against checks such as Swampert, Skarmory provides Spikes and Whirlwind for passive damage while Heatran deters Defog with Taunt, and Corviknight's Pressure allows the duo to make better progress against bulky teams. Excadrill removes entry hazards that harm Heatran, as it already has limited recovery. Moreover, Excadrill can absorb Electric-type attacks for Heatran from foes like Choice Specs Tapu Koko, check opposing Heatran, and, with a Choice Scarf set, clean weakened teams. Aegislash takes care of Fighting-type coverage such as Focus Blast from Tapu Lele and Alakazam. Moreover, Toxic + Substitute Aegislash contributes to Heatran's stallbreaking. Bisharp helps Heatran stallbreak with Knock Off, removing crucial items such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Mantine and Pelipper and Eviolite from Porygon2 and Galarian Corsola. Bisharp also contributes to Psychic- and Ghost-type matchups effectively by threatening faster Pokemon such as Victini, Latios, Gengar, and Dragapult with Sucker Punch and getting free Knock Offs against slower Pokemon such as Slowbro, Galarian Slowking, and Galarian Corsola. Assault Vest Melmetal can take a few hits from specially offensive Pokemon that threaten Heatran, such as Tapu Lele. Calm Mind Jirachi can take advantage of Pokemon that Heatran cannot reliably beat, such as Toxapex and Mantine, while also taking on Dragon-types like Kyurem and Hydreigon.</p> "

Scald is mainly used to spread burns to opposing Pokemon. Earth Power allows Seismitoad to take on Toxapex one-on-one reliably. Toxic can be used as an alternative over Earth Power to further spread status on opposing Pokemon. Protect allows Seismitoad to scout on foes like Barraskewda and grants it a free turn of Leftovers recovery while threats such as Hydreigon and Dragapult accumulate Toxic damage. Substitute helps with blocking status effects, building up Toxic damage on foes, and improving the Water-type matchup drastically by consistently setting up against Pokemon that can't touch Seismitoad, such as Rotom-W and Toxapex. Seismitoad lacks reliable recovery outside of Leftovers + Protect, so it needs to be used with caution to avoid status conditions such as burn and poison against foes that can spread them, such as Galarian Corsola and Toxapex.</p> <p>Being able to switch into Water-type attacks makes Seismitoad an ideal teammate to every Ground-type Pokemon. Physically offensive teammates such as Excadrill and Mamoswine appreciate Seismitoad's capability to spread status with Scald and Toxic, which allows them to break more consistently. Excadrill may also use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards to prevent Seismitoad from getting worn down, while Mamoswine is an offensive check to Grass-type Pokemon. Hippowdon complements Seismitoad well with a specially defensive spread to form a solid defensive backbone. Furthermore, Hippowdon has access to Sand Stream and Stealth Rock, which can effectively cripple opposing Pokemon when paired with Seismitoad's Toxic. Smack Down Rhyperior is a decent teammate that helps against Corviknight, which otherwise uses Seismitoad and many other Ground-type Pokemon as setup fodder.</p> "

Taunt is used to shut down Defoggers such as Mandibuzz and Mantine as well as slower entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Hippowdon, Toxapex, and Skarmory. Knock Off has the benefit of removing items from bulky threats such as Porygon2, Mandibuzz, and Blissey, making them easier to deal with. Earthquake lets it threaten Pokemon such as Torkoal, Klefki, and Cobalion. It also discourages fast sweepers like Volcarona and Scolipede from safely setting up on it and beating the majority of the team. Intimidate is a fantastic ability, as it weakens problematic foes like Terrakion and Zeraora, which can handle Dark-type teams easily with their STAB and coverage moves. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows it to outspeed slower foes such as Lucario, Kommo-o, and Rotom-C. Focus Sash lets Krookodile set Stealth Rock without getting OHKOed by powerful attacks such as Moonblast from Jirachi or Focus Blast from Alakazam. It's recommended to lead with Krookodile at the start of match, so it can set up Stealth Rock more efficiently with its Focus Sash intact. Magic Bounce users such as Xatu and Hatterene should also be dealt with before attempting to set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Setup sweepers and wallbreakers such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Bulk Up Urshifu-S, Hydreigon, and Bisharp appreciate Krookodile's entry hazard support to wear down the opposing team and its ability Intimidate. Taunt is especially useful because it prevents most Pokemon from setting up entry hazards and defensive threats like Toxapex and Corviknight from fully recovering their health. Bisharp can also handle a huge threat in Hatterene, which deflects Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce. Urshifu-S appreciates Stealth Rock damage on opponents, since it can specifically OHKO Zeraora with Sucker Punch and Hatterene with Wicked Blow after a Bulk Up boost. Drapion's part-Poison typing is very useful, as it can set Toxic Spikes and form a hazard-stacking core with Krookodile. Zarude is helpful against troublesome Water-types such as Keldeo and Primarina, as they are both able to use Substitute and force Krookodile to damage them. Krookodile cannot prevent faster leads such as Ribombee, Galvantula, and Cobalion from setting up entry hazards, so Mandibuzz getting rid of them with Defog is appreciated.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Galvantula is a fantastic lead because it is one of the few Electric-types with access to Sticky Web and has a high base Speed. Having Sticky Web set up is important for Electric-type teams because it helps against threatening Choice Scarf users such as Weavile, Gengar, and Gardevoir and hinders setup sweepers like Cloyster and Barbaracle. Galvantula is also a good attacker because it can land Thunder consistently thanks to Compound Eyes. Thunder is able to 2HKO common Defoggers such as Galarian Weezing and Rotom-W while also threatening anti-hazard leads such as Xatu. Bug Buzz is used for Pokemon that can tank Thunder such as Hydreigon, Mew, Rotom-C, and Alolan Raichu. String Shot slows opposing Pokemon, which makes it easier for Galvantula's teammates to outspeed and check threatening sweepers, such as Excadrill. Energy Ball can be used instead of String Shot to offer Galvantula coverage against Ground-types such as Gastrodon and Seismitoad. Galvantula should be wary of Magic Bounce users such as Hatterene and Defiant users such as Bisharp, as they can take advantage of Sticky Web. A Timid nature and maximum Speed investment allow Galvantula to outspeed Pokemon such as Mew and Speed tie Cobalion. Focus Sash is used so Galvantula can survive any attack and set up Sticky Web or attack.</p> <p>Powerful wallbreakers and sweepers such as Zeraora, Toxtricity, and Rotom-H make for great teammates, as they take full advantage of Galvantula's Sticky Web. Specifically, Alolan Raichu outspeeds a Jolly Barraskewda outside of rain after Sticky Web. A Choice Band Zeraora is also a huge threat to Dark-, Dragon-, and Normal-type teams once Sticky Web is set because it can outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Krookodile and Dragapult and OHKO them with Close Combat and Play Rough, respectively. When Sticky Web is up, Toxtricity does well against Poison- and Fairy-type teams, as it can outspeed Pokemon such as Salazzle and Alolan Ninetales and do tons of damage. Rotom-H is a great option that takes advantage of Galvantula's Sticky Web, especially against Steel- and Grass-type teams, dealing with Pokemon such as Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Celebi that Electric teams can struggle against. Finally, Pincurchin's entry hazard stacking abilities, when combined with Galvantula's Sticky Web, can heavily damage grounded foes upon entry. Furthermore, Pincurchin's Electric Surge is able to power up Galvantula's Thunder.</p> "

Its Steel typing grants it Ice, Bug, and Flying neutralities as well as a Poison immunity, four types Grass teams are typically weak to, as well as a plethora of resistances, allowing it to check many Pokemon across the board while staying healthy with Leech Seed and setting hazards. Protect should be used in order to scout against Choice-locked Pokemon such as Dragapult and Galarian Darmanitan; additionally, it helps with gaining more Leftovers recovery and racking up damage and healing with Leech Seed if used together. Spikes can be dropped if the team includes another Spikes setter such as Roserade, though it is not recommended, as Grass teams appreciate the hazard stack. Generally, Ferrothorn should look for opportunities to come in using its good typing and bulk and start stacking hazards or using Leech Seed to wear the opposing team down. Iron Head can be used over Gyro Ball to hit Hatterene, and if it is used, it should be used with an Impish nature. Maximum investments in HP and Defense along with a Relaxed nature ensure that Ferrothorn takes on Pokemon such as Galarian Darmanitan, Excadrill, and Weavile better, with a Relaxed nature also increasing the power of Gyro Ball.</p> <p>Appletun is an amazing partner for Ferrothorn because of its Dragon typing along with Thick Fat, allowing it to serve as a Fire-resistant Pokemon and covering one of Ferrothorn's key weaknesses. Together, the core can scout and beat common Choice-locked Pokemon such as Galarian Darmanitan, Indeedee, and Dragapult by using Protect to play around them. Leech Seed users such as the aforementioned Appletun, Whimsicott, and Ludicolo take advantage of Ferrothorn's hazards in order to force switches and rack up damage and can support Ferrothorn if it is not running Leech Seed. Whimsicott can also beat Fighting-type Pokemon such as Kommo-o and Hawlucha that threaten Ferrothorn with Moonblast. Offensive Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Rillaboom and Rotom-C make good partners for Ferrothorn, as they can outspeed Pokemon that threaten Ferrothorn such as Dragapult and Togekiss and use pivoting moves such as U-turn and Volt Switch respectively to bring Ferrothorn in. Rotom-C is generally good for threatening Flying-type Pokemon such as Corviknight and Choice Specs Pelipper that Ferrothorn dislikes dealing with. Ferrothorn's hazards can also support said offensive Pokemon by wearing down the opposing team.

Stealth Rock is a great utility move to chip away at the opposing team. Spikes is another option if another Pokemon on the team already has Stealth Rock. Maximum investment in Defense is for consistently dealing with physical threats to Steel-type teams such as Barraskewda, Mamoswine, and Crawdaunt. Ferrothorn is primarily a utility Pokemon and is used to switch in on attacks and apply defensive pressure to the opponent.</p> <p>Jirachi is a good partner for Ferrothorn as they form a core that can overwhelm Water-type teams thanks to Jirachi's access to Thunderbolt, Energy Ball and Psychic. Aegislash is a good partner because its Ghost typing gives it an immunity to Fighting-type attacks that threaten Ferrothorn and allows it to block Rapid Spin. Aegislash also benefits from Ferrothorn's entry hazards because it can use Shadow Sneak to pick off weakened foes. Bisharp is another good partner that punishes entry hazard removal because of its Defiant ability, which gives it a +2 Attack boost if the foe uses Defog. Corviknight forms a great defensive core with Ferrothorn and provides a Ground immunity. Excadrill is a great revenge killer and is an offensive check to Fire-types that threaten Ferrothorn and Steel-type teams in general. Duraludon can set up Stealth Rock, allowing Ferrothorn to run Spikes. Lucario and Durant are two strong wallbreakers that benefit from Ferrothorn's entry hazards chipping away at the opposing team.</p> "

It can also serve as a late-game cleaner once its checks are severely weakened or fainted. Brave Bird is Braviary's main STAB attack, denting most non-resistant targets and picking off slower, weakened threats such as Mimikyu and Barraskewda outside of rain. Close Combat complements Brave Bird, as it hits Steel- and Rock-types like Bisharp and Tyranitar that resist its STAB attacks; however, it should be used cautiously, since it is much weaker without a STAB boost and can turn Braviary into setup fodder for the likes of Corviknight and Aegislash. A fast Defog provides Normal teams with a form of entry hazard removal, while U-turn takes advantage of forced switches to keep up momentum. Defiant is Braviary's only useful ability, allowing it to gain valuable Attack boosts by switching into the opponent's Defogger.</p> <p>Physical walls such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Mandibuzz stop Braviary in its tracks, so it appreciates having powerful wallbreakers like Choice Band Diggersby and Choice Specs Indeedee as teammates. Diggersby in particular can also use sets with Spikes, which pressures the opponent into using Defog and giving Braviary a Defiant boost. In return, Braviary takes out faster threats like Dragapult and blows away entry hazards from the field. Ditto is another good partner because it forms a revenge killing duo with Braviary versus offensive teams and serves as a backup switch-in to defensive Pokemon that Braviary can't break. With its part-Electric typing, good coverage, and Dry Skin, Heliolisk can pressure Steel-, Ground-, and Water-type teams for Braviary, enabling it to be more effective in said matchups.

Roost allows Braviary to effectively wall offensive foes like Rillaboom and Heracross while keeping itself healthy to keep taking hits for its teammates. Defog most notably removes Toxic Spikes and Sticky Web that would heavily cripple the offensive capabilities of Braviary's teammates. This works well with U-turn, allowing Braviary to create immediate offensive presence by pivoting in threatening teammates. Maximum HP investment and 240 Defense EVs allow Braviary to take physical hits like Excadrill's Iron Head, Cinderace's High Jump Kick, and Mimikyu's unboosted Play Rough. 16 EVs in Speed allows Braviary to outrun Belly Drum Azumarill and do major damage to it with Brave Bird, since it survives an Aqua Jet. Its spread paired with Heavy-Duty Boots and an Impish nature allows Braviary to be a very consistent and effective physical wall that can Defog in front of most threats.</p> <p>Braviary enables all of Normal's offensive Pokemon by pivoting them in with U-turn and removing troublesome entry hazards with Defog. Diggersby, for example, greatly appreciates Braviary's pivot support and removal of Toxic Spikes, as being poisoned can make it hard for Diggersby to stay as a consistent threat throughout the match. Other examples include Heliolisk and Bewear, which pressure Water- and Dark-types like Keldeo and Bisharp more easily with hazards gone; Obstagoon and Indeedee, which terrorize the opponent far more consistently with Sticky Web and Stealth Rock gone; and Snorlax, which cherishes Braviary's ability to take Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Zeraora. In return, these offensive Pokemon remove many of the threats that would force Braviary out. Chansey particularly appreciates Braviary's ability to remove hazards, as its inability to run Heavy-Duty Boots makes it harder for it to switch into attacks when hazards are present. Braviary in turn appreciates Blissey's own pivot support and its ability to take special hits like Hydreigon's Draco Meteor and Volcarona's +1 Fire Blast or Flamethrower.

Garchomp sets Stealth Rock, provides an Electric immunity, and removes Pokemon that wall Hydreigon such as Tyranitar, Terrakion, and specially defensive Heatran. Dragapult can be used to deter foes such as Urshifu-R, Thundurus-T, and Gengar from using Fighting-type moves to remove Hydreigon and covers for Hydreigon's Bug weakness due to its Ghost typing, and it also has an excellent Speed tier that lets it outpace and remove threats like Latias and Tapu Lele. Choice Scarf Latias provides a fast teammate for Hydreigon, aids in Fighting and Poison matchups, and can provide Healing Wish to give Hydreigon a second chance to wallbreak.</p> "

Roost also helps Volcarona gain multiple setup opportunities, which can make it very difficult to deal with. However, Volcarona struggles to fit all of its coverage options and relies on the opponent not knowing its set to sweep. Volcarona is also crippled by status conditions and Knock Off, as it is reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots to switch in safely on entry hazards.</p> ",

Psychic primarily hits Toxapex, but it also hits other Poison- and Fighting-types such as Crobat and Urshifu-R. Giga Drain hits Water- and Ground-types such as Swampert, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. Roost gives Volcarona reliable recovery, which allows it to stay healthy and gain multiple boosts. Bug Buzz can be used to hit Dark- and Psychic-types like Hydreigon and Slowking. Heavy-Duty Boots is necessary to avoid Stealth Rock damage, and Flame Body can potentially punish physical attackers. Swarm can be used in conjunction with Bug Buzz for increased damage output.</p> <p>Bug teams appreciate Volcarona's unmatched late-game sweeping potential. Scizor is a great partner for Volcarona, as it can switch into and deal with Rock-types like Tyranitar and Cradily and facilitate Volcarona's sweep through removing items with Knock Off. It is also a great switch-in to status and opposing Knock Off attempts directed at Volcarona. Entry hazard support from Shuckle, Golisopod, and Araquanid is also very helpful for Volcarona. Shuckle provides both Stealth Rock and Sticky Web, while Araquanid provides a switch-in to Volcarona's primary check in Heatran. Heracross is a great teammate that can help break through Steel-types without struggling to damage Heatran, which makes Volcarona's cleaning much easier. Choice Scarf Buzzwole threatens to revenge kill some of Volcarona's checks such as Choice Band Urshifu-R and Choice Scarf Landorus-T.

It has the coveted Quiver Dance, good Special Attack, and passable Speed stat, which allow it to threaten a plethora of teams, given the chance to set up. Quiver Dance is the most important move on the set, as it lets Volcarona be an offensive juggernaut, allowing it to outspeed and beat threat like Choice Scarf Dracovish after minor chip damage. Fire Blast is its strongest STAB move and should be used to break through Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Hatterene, Corviknight, and Galarian Weezing after a Quiver Dance boost. Psychic is used to threaten Poison- and Fighting-type Pokemon like Toxapex, Dragalge, and Keldeo. Roost allows Volcarona to keep itself healthy and set up easily against types like Electric, Ghost, Dragon, and Psychic without getting worn out. Bug Buzz allows Volcarona to threaten Psychic- and Dark-type Pokemon such as Slowbro and Tyranitar, which can shrug off other attacks from it. It also has the added benefit of hitting Pokemon behind Substitute like Heliolisk and Seismitoad. Volcarona should seek opportunities to set up against Pokemon that do not threaten it like Mew and Galarian Weezing. It should be used mid- or late-game once its checks and counters like Incineroar, Snorlax, and specially defensive Toxapex are taken out or weakened enough. Maximum Special Attack EVs optimize its overall damage output, while maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Volcarona to Speed tie with other base 100 Speed Pokemon and outspeed slower Pokemon like Excadrill, Indeedee-M, and Hydreigon. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures that Volcarona is not susceptible to any form of entry hazard, which can otherwise undermine its ability as a setup sweeper.</p> <p>Physical attackers like Cinderace, Darmanitan, and Alolan Marowak appreciate Volcarona taking on physical walls like Slowbro and Seismitoad. In return, they threaten special walls like Tyranitar if Volcarona is not running Bug Buzz and take on Dark teams as a whole. Torkoal is the premier support Pokemon and a great partner, as it provides Volcarona with important Drought support; this not only allows it to hit much harder with sun-boosted Fire Blast, but it also reduces the damage from Water-type moves, giving it the opportunity to set up against Pokemon like Rotom-W. Yawn support from Torkoal lets Volcarona set up more easily against an asleep foe. Incineroar with its Knock Off and Taunt utility can weaken defensive cores of Normal- and Poison-type teams, letting Volcarona wreak havoc after a Quiver Dance boost. Charizard can wallbreak in sun thanks to its ability Solar Power and take on Pokemon like Choice Scarf Dracovish, which Volcarona cannot handle without setting up. Additionally, they form a good core against Dragon-type teams. Rotom-H can provide Volcarona with dual screen support, which lets Volcarona set up much more easily, or it can use a Nasty Plot set to weaken shared checks like Toxapex and Mantine. Salazzle can cripple troublesome Pokemon like Mantine, Jellicent, and specially defensive Toxapex, which can prove to be a pain otherwise for Volcarona.</p> "

Iron Head hits Fairy-types that are threatening for Fighting teams, such as Clefable and Hatterene, for super effective damage. Cobalion can also use Thunder Wave to cripple Pokemon such as Choice Scarf users such as Gardevoir and Dragapult, making them less of a threat. Alternatively, Cobalion can be used as a pivot with Volt Switch to gain momentum for the team.

Fighting teams also value a fast Taunt from Cobalion, as Fighting teams can often lack reliable hazard removal aside from Conkeldurr. All of Cobalion's teammates appreciate it being able to deal with Fairy-type Pokemon such as Clefable and Mimikyu. Keldeo can deal with Ground-types that threaten Cobalion, such as Excadrill and Hippowdon, and prevent opposing Defoggers from removing Stealth Rock with Taunt. Cobalion appreciates Terrakion removing Fire-type Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Charizard and Choice Scarf Darmanitan, both of which threaten Cobalion. Thunder Wave can also cripple faster threats such as Gengar, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gardevoir, which can allow Swords Dance Terrakion and Calm Mind Keldeo to sweep teams more easily. Teammates also appreciate Cobalion's Volt Switch, allowing them to safely come into the battle. Faster Taunt users such as Froslass can prevent Cobalion from setting up Stealth Rock, and faster hazard setters such as Ribombee can freely set up Sticky Web before Cobalion is able to use Taunt on them.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Keldeo is an amazing Pokemon for Water teams, as its additional Fighting typing and high Speed allow it to pose a threat to opposing Steel-, Dark-, and Normal-types that would otherwise pose a threat to the team, such as Bisharp, Hydreigon, and Snorlax. As a stallbreaker, Keldeo punishes walls like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and defensive Seismitoad by stopping their dangerous passive moves like Toxic, Haze, Recover, and entry hazards with Taunt. With Calm Mind, it can set up to beat these walls while also letting Keldeo KO Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Corviknight. These boosts with Calm Mind also allow it to break Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Mew, and Aegislash with Hydro Pump. Scald can be used as an alternative to Hydro Pump due to its more reliable accuracy and chance to burn opposing Pokemon; however, the caveat to using this move is that it is significantly weaker than Hydro Pump without Calm Mind boosts. Keldeo's STAB move in Focus Blast allows it to break Steel-, Dark-, and Normal-types like Ferrothorn, Bisharp, Hydreigon, Indeedee, and Snorlax that Water teams would otherwise have a tough time getting through. Keldeo runs maximum EVs in both Speed and Special Attack so that it can maximize its offensive presence and outspeed key Pokemon like Hydreigon and Indeedee. This offensive presence is supported by Leftovers, which allows Keldeo to become more threatening when it sets up and also recovers health.</p> <p>Keldeo forms a very strong offensive core with Pokemon like Primarina and Crawdaunt. Primarina appreciates Keldeo's ability to stallbreak and allows it to clean late-game with its Calm Mind set. Crawdaunt can also switch into Psychic-type attacks from the likes of Reuniclus and use its powerful Knock Off and Liquidation to break teams down. While Keldeo's ability to be an oppressive offensive threat is incredibly valuable, it still needs support from a lot of other Pokemon to achieve this goal. Defensive Pokemon in Seismitoad and Toxapex provide the team with an Electric immunity and a Grass neutrality, respectively. Seismitoad also provides Stealth Rock support while Toxapex offers support through Toxic, Toxic Spikes, spreading Scald burns, and wearing down opposing Pokemon to make it easier for Keldeo to break through them. Rotom-W is also a great partner, as it is able to switch into Flying-type attacks from the likes of Corviknight and Togekiss and can answer back with its own STAB Electric-type moves. It also provides Defog support to prevent Keldeo from being worn down by Sticky Web, Toxic Spikes, and other entry hazards. Pelipper can assist Keldeo by getting rid of key Grass-type Pokemon like Vileplume and Virizion with its STAB Hurricane, as well as support Keldeo with Drizzle, bolstering the power of Keldeo's Hydro Pump. Cloyster is another teammate that helps deal with Grass-types as well as Dragon- and Flying-types for Keldeo and appreciates its ability to keep Stealth Rock and other hazards off the field with Taunt. Lastly, Araquanid is a great support Pokemon, as it can not only threaten Psychic-types like Gardevoir, but also use Sticky Web to allow Keldeo to threaten more Pokemon, namely Heliolisk and Choice Scarf Indeedee.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While donning the Choice Specs, Keldeo becomes a very threatening wallbreaker that is very hard to switch into for types like Normal, Dark, and Ground. With STAB Hydro Pump, Keldeo is able to burst through walls like Mandibuzz and Corviknight thanks to its raw power. This along with its STAB Aura Sphere eviscerating most Normal- and Steel-types like Indeedee, Bewear, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp makes it extremely hard to switch into. Secret Sword is a good alternative to Aura Sphere if the little extra power and the ability to hit the Defense stat as opposed to the Special Defense stat is preferred, which is key in dealing with Pokemon like Snorlax. Keldeo also uses Icy Wind to hit some would-be threats on the switch such as Noivern, Vileplume, and Dragapult, and Scald to have a more reliable Water-type STAB move when needed. In order for it to maximize its offensive presence, Keldeo runs full EV investment in both Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature. This boost in Speed allows it to outspeed key Pokemon like Mimikyu, Modest Alolan Raichu, and non-Choice Scarf Jirachi naturally.</p> <p>Keldeo's offensive presence and ability to break open holes in the opposing team make it great as a partner for setup sweepers like Gyarados and Cloyster. Keldeo also helps get rid of prominent Grass-types like Appletun and Vileplume with Icy Wind. Crawdaunt and Primarina are offensive partners that can help out Keldeo by getting rid of annoying Psychic- and Dragon-types, respectively, while switching into their respective types. Crawdaunt in particular, while able to greatly improve the Steel matchup alongside Keldeo, also helps check Jellicent which completely walls Keldeo. Rotom-W is also a very invaluable teammate for Keldeo, as it can take Flying-type attacks from the likes of Corviknight and Togekiss and threaten them out with its own Electric-type STAB move and pivot using Volt Switch. It can also use a Substitute + Nasty Plot set that can break Pokemon like Jellicent and Toxapex, as well as provide support through Defog, which prevents Keldeo from getting worn down from hazards. Seismitoad allows Keldeo to have Stealth Rock support as well as providing it a switch-in to Electric-type attacks. Toxapex also helps take Grass-type attacks for Keldeo as a defensive pivot while using Toxic or Toxic Spikes to help wear down the opposing team. Pelipper sets rain, which gives Keldeo ludicrous amounts of power with its Hydro Pump and allows partners like Dracovish to help clean teams that were weakened by Keldeo's wallbreaking power. Araquanid is also very helpful in assisting Keldeo with Sticky Web to slow down faster threats like Heliolisk and Choice Scarf Indeedee.</p> "

Body Slam and Earthquake are Diggersby's STAB moves and should be used most of the time, given most non-resistant or immune targets are outright OHKOed or severely hurt by them. Fire Punch covers Steel-types not weak to Earthquake, notably Corviknight and Ferrothorn, while Quick Attack is useful to revenge kill faster threats like Barraskewda if they're weakened. An Adamant nature is optimal to hit as hard as possible; however, Jolly can be ran alongside Mega Kick to outspeed Adamant Excadrill outside of Sand and retain the 2HKOs on Mandibuzz and Hippowdon.</p> <p>Snorlax appreciates the wallbreaking potential of Diggersby to sweep opposing teams with its Curse set. Similarly, Braviary can clean late-game once Diggersby removes walls such as Toxapex and Aegislash. Choice Scarf Ditto deals with the offensive threats Diggersby struggles against, like Dragapult and Galarian Darmanitan, and it can also deter opponents from attempting a setup sweep. As Diggersby appreciates spamming its powerful STAB moves, Indeedee is a good partner to remove Pokemon immune to them, such as Corviknight and Sableye. Indeedee's Psychic Terrain support also prevents priority moves from revenge killing Diggersby. Finally, Heliolisk helps Diggersby a lot by checking Water-types and bringing Diggersby safely into the field, respectively.</p> "

Shadow Sneak should be spammed the most after setting up and can pick off weakened foes and clean late-game; it mainly assists versus Psychic teams and opposing Ghost teams. Close Combat is able to hit threats such as Ferrothorn, Steelix, and Avalugg hard. Iron Head is used to hit Fairy-types such as Grimmsnarl, which poses a huge threat to Ghost teams with priority Sucker Punch. Maximum Attack and HP investment allows Aegislash to hit as hard and be as bulky as possible to effectively activate Weakness Policy when in Shield forme, where it exhibits its sky-high defenses.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Froslass, Runerigus, and Galarian Corsola all serve as great teammates for Aegislash, in order to help it sweep. Dragapult can break down with Choice Band or Choice Specs for Aegislash to sweep, as can Polteageist mid-game. Gengar is also a fine partner, as it can benefit from Aegislash's wallbreaking capabilities and can clean late-game. Lastly, Mimikyu can take on faster Dark-types such as Hydreigon and serves as a secondary check to Grimmsnarl.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With its amazing Special Attack in Blade forme paired with Choice Specs, Aegislash becomes a very powerful wallbreaker. STAB Shadow Ball is great, since only two types resist or are immune to it, making it very difficult to switch into, and it's able to 2HKO bulky Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex. Flash Cannon is Aegislash's secondary STAB attack and is primarily used against Pokemon weak to Steel or against Pokemon that resist or are immune to Shadow Ball such as Indeedee and Grimmsnarl. Steel Beam is Aegislash's most powerful attack at the cost of cutting half of its HP, which is why it should only be used when Aegislash needs to OHKO a threat such as omni-boosted Kommo-o or Mandibuzz. Aegislash has high Attack despite having a Modest nature, which allows it to effectively run Shadow Sneak so it can revenge kill weakened threats such as Keldeo, Chandelure, and Alolan Raichu. Stance Change is part of the reason why Aegislash is such a great wallbreaker, because it can take a hit before changing to Blade forme and use a powerful attack. Maximum investment in HP allows Aegislash to take attacks such as Choice Specs Shadow Ball from Dragapult in Shield forme due to its amazing bulk. Alternatively, maximum Speed can be used to outspeed Pokemon such as Adamant Crawdaunt and Corviknight. Aegislash should be used to wallbreak early- to mid-game and clear the way for its teammates to win.</p> <p>Corviknight is a great partner, as it covers Aegislash's Ground weakness and makes a great pivot to attacks that threaten Aegislash such as Indeedee's Mystical Fire and Gengar's Shadow Ball. Ferrothorn gets up entry hazards to weaken the opposing team and put them in range of Aegislash's attacks. It also works well with Aegislash in dealing with Choice Specs Keldeo, as Ferrothorn resists Water-type attacks and can scout with Protect, while Aegislash is immune to Fighting-type attacks. Ferrothorn can also support Aegislash with its Leech Seed and let it recover back some HP. Melmetal forms a very powerful offensive core with Choice Specs Aegislash, being able to break through the majority of the metagame. Choice Scarf Excadrill is a good revenge killer capable of dealing with threats such as Chandelure and Rotom-H. Bisharp works well with Aegislash in overwhelming Psychic- and Ghost-type teams and is also valuable in other matchups thanks to its ability to revenge kill threats such as Alolan Raichu, Dragapult, Venusaur in sun, and Seismitoad in rain with Sucker Punch. Choice Scarf Duraludon can revenge kill Dragon-types that Aegislash has trouble with such as Hydreigon and Dragapult. Jirachi can check Keldeo with Psychic, provide Healing Wish support for Aegislash, and run Trick Room to allow Aegislash to take advantage of its mediocre Speed. Bronzong is another option for Trick Room-oriented teams.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its great defensive typing and amazing bulk in Shield forme combined with Toxic, Substitute, and its signature move King's Shield, Aegislash is able to annoy teams with Toxic stall while also applying offensive pressure with Shadow Ball due to its naturally high Special Attack. It can use Substitute on Pokemon that can't break through it, such as Jirachi and Celebi, and use Shadow Ball to deal damage or Toxic on a predicted switch. Toxic works well with King's Shield and Substitute to stall out the opposing Pokemon. King's Shield is also incredibly useful for scouting Choice item users such as Keldeo and Zeraora, switching to Shield forme so Aegislash can take attacks such as Shadow Ball from opposing Choice Specs Dragapult and Aegislash and OHKO them, as well as regain health with Leftovers and stall out weather. Shadow Ball threatens some common Toxic switch-ins such as Jirachi, Hatterene, and Celebi and does decent damage to Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex. Full investment in HP and Special Defense is used to maximize Aegislash's special bulk and allow it to take attacks such as Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump from Pelipper and unboosted Weather Ball from Venusaur in sun.</p> <p>Corviknight and Ferrothorn form a great defensive core with Aegislash, as they're able to cover a lot of each other's weaknesses. Aegislash can check Pokemon that threaten the other two, such as Dragapult and Choice Specs Aegislash, and provides a valuable Fighting immunity. Corviknight is able to switch in on Ground-type attacks that threaten Aegislash and check Fighting-types that annoy Ferrothorn with Brave Bird. Ferrothorn switches in on strong Water-type attacks that the other two can't take very well such as Choice Specs Keldeo's Hydro Pump, which Ferrothorn and Aegislash are able to beat thanks to their shared ability to scout its move with Protect or King's Shield. Ferrothorn also provides Leech Seed support for additional recovery and sets up entry hazards. Choice Scarf Duraludon is a good partner because it's able to revenge kill Hydreigon and is great against Dragon-type teams. Choice Scarf Excadrill is another great revenge killer and deals with threats such as Chandelure and Zeraora. Jirachi is capable of handling Keldeo thanks to its STAB Psychic, breaking Corviknight and Toxapex with the combination of Calm Mind, Psychic, and Thunderbolt, and supporting Aegislash with Healing Wish. Bisharp is a strong wallbreaker and is especially good against Psychic- and Ghost-type teams together with Aegislash.</p> "

Shadow Claw is Aegislash's main STAB move and serves to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types. Shadow Sneak serves as a STAB priority move that helps to cover its horrendous Speed stat and revenge kill weakened foes. Close Combat is used in order to hit Steel-, Rock-, and Normal-types such as Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, and Indeedee. Weakness Policy takes advantage of Aegislash's ability to take powerful hits and boost its Attack to help it sweep more easily. Aegislash can be used early-game to weaken the opposing team to give its teammates the capability to sweep late-game, or as a late-game sweeper with its priority move in Shadow Sneak being able to KO weakened threats.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters like Spikes Ferrothorn or Stealth Rock Duraludon helps Aegislash to sweep more easily late-game.

Other late-game sweepers such as Choice Scarf Excadrill are also good partners for Aegislash, being able to clean remaining Pokemon after an Aegislash sweep. Aegislash fails to defeat Dark-type Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, so having a teammate that can take advantage of them like Bulk Up Corviknight is nice, too.</p> "

Its Poison typing also allows Dragalge to take Fairy-type attacks from foes like Gardevoir and Hatterene and remove the opposing Toxic Spikes from foes like Toxapex. Sludge Wave is Dragalge's way of dealing damage while having a way to nail the aforementioned Fairy-types. Dragalge's mediocre Speed allows it to put Flip Turn to excellent use, bringing in teammates such as Kyurem and Hydreigon safely against Pokemon it underspeeds, such as Toxapex, that like to spread status. Protect is used for scouting Choice-locked Pokemon such as Diggersby, Indeedee-M, Jirachi, and Gardevoir, providing an extra turn of Black Sludge recovery as well as accumulating Toxic Spikes damage. Adaptability bolsters the power of Sludge Wave greatly and allows Dragalge to beat Hatterene after one Calm Mind. 20 Special Attack EVs ensure that Dragalge always OHKOes Gardevoir after one turn of poison damage or after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of EVs are dumped to HP and Special Defense to benefit best from Dragalge's natural bulk. 24 Speed IVs along with a Sassy nature allow Dragalge to underspeed Toxapex, thus acting as a sponge to status inflicting moves such as Scald and Toxic.</p> <p>Substitute users such as Kyurem and Hydreigon appreciate Toxic Spikes, greatly as it helps them to break types like Normal, Fairy, Psychic, and Ground more consistently throughout the game. Furthermore, Dragalge can act as a slow pivot for the two with Flip Turn. In return, Kyurem can take advantage of Water-types that are not afraid of facing Dragalge such as Seismitoad and Toxapex with Freeze Dry, while Hydreigon can switch into Psychic-type attacks from Choice-locked foes such as Indeedee-M and beats Steel-types such as Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Dragapult is another Substitute user that is a fantastic partner for Dragalge, as it can lend itself to a plethora of roles; thanks to Hex, it can punish most Psychic-types besides Jirachi and Indeedee-M with the help of Toxic Spikes, its U-turn allows it to be one of fastest pivots in the game, and with a Choice Scarf set, it can be an excellent revenge killer against foes like Kingdra under Swift Swim with its almost unresisted STAB combination. Furthermore, its Ghost typing allows Dragapult to act as a spinblocker against foes like Excadrill and Torkoal. Duraludon is another good partner for Dragalge, as the duo forms a good defensive backbone thanks to Duralodon's good physical bulk. Thanks to its Steel typing, Duraludon can switch into Choice Scarf Jirachi's Iron Head and threaten it with Thunder Wave and handle other Fairy-types such as Azumarill, Mimikyu, and Klefki. Noivern can help Dragalge in many ways between its sets; a standard stallbreaker set prevents common Defog users such as opposing Noivern and Braviary from removing Toxic Spikes with Taunt, and its access to U-turn lets the duo perform as a pivot core with Dragalge's access to Flip Turn. Furthermore, its Flying typing lets Noivern switch into Ground-type attacks from foes like Choice Scarf Excadrill and Seismitoad.</p> "

Grass Knot lets it pressure Ground-type teams and in combination with its STAB Electric-type move, it becomes a headache for Water-type teams to deal with, making such matchups relatively easier for Normal-type teams to handle. Focus Blast lets it beat Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Excadrill that normally can switch into Heliolisk.

Glare allows it to paralyze faster threats such as Kingdra under rain and Choice Scarf Cobalion when Heliolisk is behind a Substitute. Glare mainly allows it to spread status well due to only Electric-type Pokemon being immune to it. Thunderbolt permits it to threaten Water- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Toxapex, Mantine, and Corviknight. Grass Knot grants Heliolisk the ability to target Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Seismitoad, Gastrodon, Mamoswine, and Rhyperior. The combination of Thunderbolt and Grass Knot allows Heliolisk to threaten every Water-type Pokemon for super effective damage. Substitute allows Heliolisk to take advantage of passive Pokemon such as Mantine, Toxapex, and specially defensive Aegislash. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Heliolisk to ignore entry hazards that will hinder it such as Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes. However, Leftovers can be used to passively regain health, giving it more opportunities to set up a Substitute. Dry Skin grants Heliolisk an immunity to Water-type attacks, allowing it to switch into attacks such as Dracovish's Fishious Rend and Azumarill's Aqua Jet, which can otherwise devastate Normal teams. Maximum EVs in Special Attack and Speed ensure it is as powerful as possible and faster than Pokemon such as Keldeo. Heliolisk should try to set up a Substitute against Water teams, especially on passive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mantine or Pokemon Choice-locked into a Water-type attack such as Choice Scarf Rotom-W's Hydro Pump. Substitute then allows it to severely threaten Water teams. Outside of the Water and Flying matchups, Heliolisk's main job is to be spreading paralysis with Glare, which can be done more easily if it's behind a Substitute.</p> <p>Heliolisk supports its offensive teammates with Glare, allowing them to outspeed threats such as Hydreigon. Blissey is a fantastic partner, as it can switch into a plethora of attacks for it such as Rotom-H's Overheat and Indeedee's Expanding Force. In addition, Blissey can set Stealth Rock for Heliolisk, allowing it to break past Pokemon such as Keldeo and Togekiss more easily. Finally, it can also pivot with Teleport to bring in Heliolisk safely. Ditto is a great way to check faster Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Cinderace. Braviary is an important teammate when Heliolisk is not using Heavy-Duty Boots, as it can clear hazards off the field, which is crucial for Heliolisk due to its weakness to Toxic Spikes and Sticky Web. This is especially important against Water teams. Diggersby, Bewear, and Obstagoon can break through special walls for Heliolisk such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, Celebi, and Tyranitar. Diggersby can also take on Fire- and Poison-type Pokemon such as Torkoal, Incineroar, and Salazzle. Obstagoon can help Heliolisk in the Psychic- and Ghost-type matchups by taking on Pokemon such as Mew and Alolan Marowak. Bewear is the best check to threats such as Urshifu-S, as Fluffy alongside a Chople Berry can make that matchup manageable. In return, Heliolisk can slow down faster Pokemon such as Hydreigon with Glare for them.</p> "

This and Hawlucha's access to Swords Dance, make it very good at cleaning weakened teams, and it grants the team a good matchup against Grass- and Bug-type teams thanks to its Flying typing. With White Herb, it can set up Unburden in front of any Pokemon that isn't a Ghost-type with Close Combat, and use either Acrobatics or Brave Bird to hit most of the tier very hard. Brave Bird is especially useful in matchups like Ghost, where activating White Herb is impossible due to everything being immune to Close Combat. Swords Dance is used to further boost its power in front of walls such as Ferrothorn on Steel. Taunt facilitates this by preventing walls like Toxapex or Hippowdon from healing and using Haze or phazing moves, as well as preventing entry hazards and other status moves. One should also be wary of Pokemon that are faster than Hawlucha after Unburden, such as Barraskewda in rain. Maximum Attack and Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Hawlucha to hit as hard as possible while outspeeding most key threats outside of Unburden such as Gengar and Keldeo.</p> <p>Hawlucha can't outright sweep teams from the beginning of the match, which is why it needs teammates like Bewear and Lucario to break holes in the opposing team so it can find an opportunity to set up and clean. Bewear helps check walls like Galarian Corsola thanks to its Substitute + Bulk Up set, while Lucario can help bust through walls like Toxapex with its Nasty Plot set. These Pokemon in return appreciate Hawlucha's ability to prevent hazards from being on the field thanks to Taunt, as well as making it easier to switch into walls like Hippowdon or Ferrothorn. Choice Scarf Toxicroak is also a great teammate, as it can KO most Fairy-types that threaten Hawlucha like Gardevoir and Hatterene. Hawlucha also enjoys the support that Stealth Rock Kommo-o can provide, as it weakens opposing Pokemon and makes it easier for Hawlucha to sweep late-game by breaking.</p> "

Additionally, its good Speed tier allows it to outpace threats such as non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Urshifu-R, Keldeo, and Tapu Lele, and it has good offensive utility in Extreme Speed. Unfortunately, Zygarde-10% is very frail, limiting its ability to stay in on attacks like Celesteela's Heavy Slam, Skarmory's Body Press, and Rotom-W's Hydro Pump without taking heavy damage before KOing them with Thousand Arrows. While Zygarde-10%'s Dragon / Ground typing is menacing for an offensive Pokemon, it struggles to break through generally bulky Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Slowbro due to its only average Attack stat.</p> ",

However, being locked into Outrage makes Zygarde-10% even more vulnerable to powerful attackers like Dragapult and bulky walls like Amoonguss, since it becomes unable to switch out for a few turns. Extreme Speed allows Zygarde-10% to revenge kill faster weakened threats such as Alolan Raichu and Barraskewda.

Maximum Speed investment allows it to outspeed Hydreigon, Urshifu-R, Keldeo, and Choice Specs Latios, while Choice Band is recommended to maximize its damage output and power.

Excadrill can also remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin to increase Zygarde-10%'s longevity and use Sand Rush to handle faster threats Zygarde-10% cannot take care of. Mamoswine is also useful for defeating problematic foes such as Amoonguss and Tapu Bulu, outspeeding and picking off faster foes like Dragapult with Ice Shard and removing items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Eviolite from prominent Pokemon such as Blissey, Mandibuzz, Porygon2, and Galarian Corsola with Knock Off. Hippowdon can deal chip damage on foes by setting Stealth Rock and sand, and it can preserve Zygarde-10%'s poor bulk by switching into most powerful attackers such as Dragonite, Terrakion, and Bisharp. Gastrodon and Seismitoad both provide a valuable Water immunity against Urshifu-R and Barraskewda. Nidoking is good for absorbing Toxic Spikes, setting its own, and using Flamethrower to KO Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Tapu Bulu.

Toxic allows Toxapex to cripple various Pokemon, while Haze is great for checking setup sweepers. These two moves, along with Recover, make Toxapex hard to take down for many teams across the board. Toxic Spikes can also be used to indirectly cripple types like Fairy and Dragon. Toxapex should be used as a defensive check to various Pokemon, and Toxic and Scald should be used liberally to spread status and wear down the opposition. When Toxapex is worn down, Regenerator should be taken advantage of in order to remain healthy. Maximum Defense and HP investment along with a Bold nature allows Toxapex to deal with threatening Pokemon such as Mimikyu, Bisharp, and Dragapult more comfortably.</p> <p>Offensive Pokemon such as Seismitoad, Barraskewda, and Gyarados appreciate Toxapex's ability to switch into and wear down the opposing team using status. Toxapex is also prone to being beaten by wallbreakers, so offensive Pokemon such as the aforementioned Seismitoad and Barraskewda as well as Choice Scarf users like Rotom-W and Dracovish are appreciated to revenge kill threatening Pokemon like Gyarados, Indeedee, and Hydreigon. Other Pokemon such as Pelipper and Seismitoad synergize well defensively with Toxapex, with Pelipper providing a Ground-type immunity and Seismitoad taking on Electric-type attacks. Toxapex itself is great for absorbing status and taking Grass-type attacks alongside this.</p> "

The former can use Yawn to make it easier for Salazzle to come in, Rapid Spin to get rid of hazards, and Stealth Rock to help damage foes to make it easier for Salazzle to stall them out, while the latter can use Hypnosis to help Salazzle come in and can use Solar Beam to take care of Ground- and Water-types such as Seismitoad and Mamoswine. Cinderace, Arcanine, and Darmanitan are all fast physical attackers that appreciate Salazzle badly poisoning walls such as Galarian Corsola, Toxapex, and Mandibuzz that give them trouble, and they can all beat Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Snorlax for Salazzle in return. Cinderace is able to use Sucker Punch to help wear down fast Pokemon like Dragapult, use U-turn to bring in Salazzle safely, and use Court Change to move hazards to the other side of the field for Salazzle.

Choice Band Arcanine can be used, as it can use Extreme Speed to take care of weakened Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Keldeo, and Alolan Raichu for the team mid- to late-game.

Offensively, Mimikyu improves the matchup against offensive types like Electric, Psychic, and Ghost; however, it struggles with common defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Celesteela, and Hippowdon, and thus it functions best as a late-game cleaner once its teammates have broken down the opposing defensive core. Mimikyu is also very susceptible to passive damage from entry hazards, status, and Life Orb recoil, and it heavily relies on Disguise being unbroken to pose an offensive threat.</p> <h1>Ghost</h1> <p>Mimikyu is a great late-game cleaner and sweeper with its access to priority and STAB Play Rough, allowing it to check Dark-types like Galarian Moltres and Hydreigon. Disguise lets Mimikyu get a free Swords Dance, allowing it to get past defensive Pokemon like Clefable and Heatran and revenge kill faster Pokemon like Dragapult and Victini more easily. Its speed tier lets Mimikyu outspeed Pokemon like Kyurem and Galarian Moltres but leaves it vulnerable to faster Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Galarian Zapdos, and Zarude that it cannot KO with Shadow Sneak. Its low Attack means Mimikyu has an overreliance on a boost to deal damage. Even with a Swords Dance boost, Mimikyu is unable to 2HKO and break through defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Celesteela. Disguise also does not prevent Mimikyu from getting statused by Pokemon like Klefki and Gastrodon, and when combined with the chip from Life Orb and Disguise breaking, Mimikyu gets worn down a lot throughout the match.</p> ",

Volt Switch allows it to pivot out of checks such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar, rack chip damage on foes, and bring in a teammate to deal with these checks. Dazzling Gleam breaks through Dragon- and Dark-types such as Latias, Latios, Hydreigon, Zarude, and Urshifu-S. Grass Knot provides excellent coverage against Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, Swampert, and Seismitoad, which would be able to consistently switch into Tapu Koko and block its Volt Switch. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Tapu Koko to outspeed Cinderace, Alakazam, and non-Choice Scarf Weavile while Speed tying with Spectrier. Tapu Koko should usually be led with early-game to set up Electric Terrain so it can make Electric-type moves more spammable against the opposing team. It should also wallbreak mid- or late-game once its offensive teammates have weakened the opposing team.</p> <p>Alolan Raichu heavily benefits from Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain due to its ability Surge Surfer, allowing it to outspeed almost the entire metagame, including Choice Scarf Excadrill, Swift Swim Kingdra, and Choice Scarf Blacephalon. Its Psychic typing can also be helpful against Poison-types like Amoonguss, Dragalge, and Nidoking. Zeraora is an excellent physical wallbreaker that can help against specially defensive foes like Blissey, Galarian Slowking, and Tyranitar, forming a good offensive core with Tapu Koko to take on types like Dark, Psychic, Dragon, and Ghost together. Rotom-W and Zapdos both provide useful Ground immunities for Tapu Koko; Rotom-W is able to defeat or force out Mamoswine and Sand Rush Excadrill while resisting Fire-type attacks from Choice Scarf Victini and Blacephalon, which Tapu Koko particularly struggles against. Zapdos can deal with Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, Tapu Bulu, and Zarude with Heat Wave and its useful typing while getting rid of problematic entry hazards such as Stealth Rock, Sticky Web, and Toxic Spikes. Air Balloon Magnezone can trap troublesome Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Excadrill with Magnet Pull. Regieleki also heavily benefits from Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain, as its boosted Rising Voltage 2HKOes even foes that resist it like Ferrothorn, Zarude, and Kyurem while OHKOing Dragapult when aided by Choice Specs.

It is also the best option to hit neutral targets like Spectrier and Zapdos due to it being boosted by Electric Surge. Grass Knot hits Ground-type Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Seismitoad, and Mamoswine. The combination of Thunderbolt + Grass Knot breaks Water teams entirely by hitting the vast majority of Pokemon for super effective damage. Dazzling Gleam ensures Thundurus-T and Landorus-T cannot switch in for free against Fairy in fear of getting 2HKOed. It also hits Dragon-type Pokemon like Garchomp, Latios, and Kyurem, which Thunderbolt and Grass Knot can't beat. Roost increases Tapu Koko's longevity and mitigates Life Orb recoil, letting it heal throughout the match and come in on weaker attacks like Toxapex's Scald and defensive Zapdos's Discharge. A Timid nature allows Tapu Koko to outspeed Pokemon such as Alakazam and Weavile while Speed tying with Spectrier. Life Orb ensures that Tapu Koko OHKOes Celesteela with Thunderbolt and 2HKOes Landorus-T and Thundurus-T with Dazzling Gleam and prevents it from being Choice locked.</p> <p>Tapu Bulu supports Tapu Koko defensively by switching into Ground-type attacks from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Krookodile.

The combination of Stealth Rock and Knock Off makes Clefable an amazing teammate by further helping Tapu Koko in the Flying matchup. Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Zapdos and Mantine means Tapu Koko can put in work by forcing switches while punishing the same Defoggers with Thunderbolt. Klefki patches up Tapu Koko's poor bulk with its ability to set dual screens. It can also set Spikes to punish types like Ground and Water alongside Tapu Koko forcing switches. Azumarill's ability to revenge kill a faster and dangerous threat in Excadrill and beat Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Galarian Slowking after a Belly Drum boost is appreciated by Tapu Koko. Choice Specs Tapu Lele supports Tapu Koko by breaking Pokemon like Blissey and Amoonguss, which wall Tapu Koko, with Psyshock. Grimmsnarl can help against Psychic and Ghost teams alongside Tapu Koko, providing synergy against the matchups. Try to not let Tapu Koko get badly poisoned by Pokemon such as Toxapex and Celesteela, as that will hinder its ability to stay in for long durations of time when it needs to swap between moves. Be wary of Choice Scarf Rotom-W's Trick, as giving Tapu Koko a Choice Scarf means it cannot switch moves against Water anymore.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Psychic</h1> <p>Tapu Lele is one of Psychic's most essential Pokemon due to its ability Psychic Surge, sky-high Special Attack, and excellent STAB combination that targets troublesome Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Dragonite, and Latios. Psychic Terrain boosts the power of Psychic-type STAB moves, especially teammates' Expanding Force, while invalidating priority moves like Sucker Punch, Shadow Sneak, and Aqua Jet from users such as Bisharp, Aegislash, Mimikyu, and Azumarill. This greatly benefits Tapu Lele's faster teammates and lets it beat Azumarill. Tapu Lele has a few great coverage options to deal with its typical checks, such as Thunderbolt for Celesteela and Corviknight, Focus Blast for Steel- and Dark-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Tyranitar, and Shadow Ball for Ghost-types like Aegislash. However, even with Psychic Terrain's protection, Tapu Lele's average Speed tier leaves it vulnerable to being revenge killed by numerous naturally faster Pokemon such as Zeraora, Volcarona, Gengar, and Nihilego that it would desire to outspeed. Tapu Lele's poor physical bulk also makes it difficult for it to consistently switch into attacks and set up Psychic Terrain for its teammates.</p> <h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Tapu Lele serves as a unique wallbreaker for Fairy teams thanks to its ability Psychic Surge, which strengthens its Psychic-type moves while also blocking priority moves from foes like Scizor, Weavile, and Dragonite. Moreover, Tapu Lele's STAB combination is very good against many matchups, and, with the help of wallbreaker teammates like Azumarill and Tapu Bulu, it can easily clean late-game. Coverage options such as Focus Blast and Thunderbolt can help Tapu Lele against Pokemon that it cannot beat normally, such as Heatran, Celesteela, and Mantine. However, its Speed tier is middling; even with a Choice Scarf, Tapu Lele is slower than other common Choice Scarf users such as Gengar, Blacephalon, and Weavile. This Speed, combined with its bad defenses, means Tapu Lele cannot reliably switch into threats and is oftentimes limited to revenge killing or accepting heavy hits. This also leaves Tapu Lele weak to the aforementioned Choice Scarf users. Lastly, Psychic Terrain also blocks teammate priority moves, such as Azumarill's Aqua Jet and Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak.</p> ",

Thunderbolt can break through bulky Water- and Flying-types such as Slowking, Slowbro, and Celesteela, letting this set wreck Water and Flying teams with the combination of Psychic and Thunderbolt. Shadow Ball can be used over Thunderbolt to help against Ghost-types like Aegislash as well as foes like Jirachi, attempting to switch in on Tapu Lele's other attacks. It also greatly helps in the Psychic mirror matchup. Avoid consistently switching into attacks so Tapu Lele can be kept healthy to wallbreak. If Psychic Terrain or a Fairy-type STAB move is mandatory for a battle, then Tapu Lele should always be kept alive. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Tapu Lele to outspeed Nidoking and Duraludon, while Choice Specs makes it a fearsome wallbreaker.</p> <p>All teammates appreciate Tapu Lele's wallbreaking capabilities and benefit from its Psychic Terrain. Victini is an excellent partner for Tapu Lele, as it can break through specially defensive foes such as Blissey as well as Steel-types like Celesteela, Aegislash, and Ferrothorn with V-create, while Tapu Lele has Focus Blast to deal with Heatran. Slowbro is a great physical wall that resists Fire-type attacks such as Cinderace's Pyro Ball and Victini's V-create for Tapu Lele while guaranteeing it safe entry with Teleport. Slowbro can also carry Thunder Wave, slowing down foes like Volcarona and Hydreigon for Tapu Lele. Jirachi provides Stealth Rock support, slows down foes like Nihilego and Hydreigon with Thunder Wave, has the combination of Serene Grace and Iron Head to slowly wear down foes, and brings Tapu Lele in safely with U-turn. Additionally, a Choice Scarf set lets Jirachi outspeed threats like Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and non-Choice Scarf Dragapult, which are huge threats to Tapu Lele. Celebi is an alternative Stealth Rock setter over Jirachi thanks to its part-Grass typing, allowing it to force out Water- and Ground-types like Swampert, Seismitoad, Hippowdon, and Excadrill, the latter being a big threat for Psychic teams. Additionally, it can absorb status aliments with Natural Cure, provide U-turn and Healing Wish support, and use Recover for great longevity. Latias is able to remove problematic entry hazards such as Sticky Web, Toxic Spikes, and Stealth Rock for Tapu Lele with Defog while providing a natural immunity to Ground-type attacks like Sand Rush Excadrill's Earthquake, Nidoking's Earth Power, and Garchomp's Earthquake. It can also provide Healing Wish support. Alakazam is a dedicated revenge killer that can KO an abundance of threats such as Choice Scarf Weavile, Barraskewda, Scolipede, and Drapion with its high Speed tier, Counter, Focus Sash, and Magic Guard, which prevents any form of residual damage, making it more effective in this role.</p> "

Klefki is another excellent supporting partner thanks to its plethora of excellent utility moves; Spikes contributes majorly to weakening the opposing team, Thunder Wave cripples faster Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and Urshifu-R, and dual screens support makes it even more difficult for opposing threats to handle Tapu Lele, especially late-game. Clefable is a decent support option because it can provide Stealth Rock to weaken the opposing team. Clefable can also use Knock Off to rid bulky Pokemon such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn of their passive recovery, meaning these Pokemon get worn out after multiple switches, and threaten them with Flamethrower. Mimikyu is an excellent revenge killer and one-time blanket check to most Pokemon thanks to its ability Disguise, and it is helpful against Psychic teams, which benefit from Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain. Tapu Koko can take on Flying-types such as Celesteela and Mantine for Tapu Lele and pivot it in with Volt Switch. Togekiss can help against Steel-types such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn with Flamethrower.

Substitute can be used as an alternative over Protect to take advantage of weak specially offensive Pokemon that cannot break it such as Slowbro, Toxapex, and Rotom-W. Horn Leech is Tapu Bulu's main STAB attack, and Grassy Terrain not only provides a boost to Horn Leech but also passive recovery, which, when combined with the recovery from Horn Leech, lets it stay healthy throughout the game.

Furthermore, Klefki covers up Tapu Bulu's main weaknesses in Poison, Flying, and Ice. Clefable provides Stealth Rock to chip down foes with residual damage and allow Tapu Bulu to have an easier time while breaking. Moreover, Clefable can absorb status for Tapu Bulu through Magic Guard. Galarian Weezing provides utility in Will-O-Wisp and Toxic Spikes, which cripple foes to allow Tapu Bulu to set up even more safely. Moreover, Galarian Weezing is excellent in a mirror matchup and against Grass-type teams, and its ability Neutralizing Gas can be helpful against Regenerator users such as Toxapex, Slowbro, and Galarian Slowking. In exchange, Tapu Bulu can take on Ground-type attacks for Galarian Weezing. Other wallbreakers such as Togekiss and Mimikyu reduce the workload of Tapu Bulu in several matchups that it cannot properly function in; the former is good against Grass-type Pokemon, while the latter is good against Psychic- and Ghost-types.

Dazzling Gleam is for Dragon-type Pokemon like Dragapult and Garchomp, notably OHKOing Hydreigon. Grass Knot damages Water- and Ground-types while specifically 2HKOing Gastrodon and Hippowdon and OHKOing Swampert and Seismitoad after chip damage.

Nihilego struggles with Ground-types like Excadrill, Gastrodon, and Landorus-T, Water-types like Slowking and Barraskewda, and priority users like Azumarill and Urshifu-R, but having Amoonguss as a teammate helps. Amoonguss is Poison's best switch-in to Mold Breaker Excadrill and spreads status like sleep from Spore, paralysis from Stun Spore, and poison from Sludge Bomb, which is beneficial for the entire team. It is threatened by Fire-types like Volcarona, Blacephalon, and Victini, which Choice Scarf Nihilego can revenge kill. Toxapex helps Nihilego by sponging Steel-type attacks like Iron Head and Bullet Punch while also forming a Regenerator core with Amoonguss. In return, Nihilego revenge kills threats with Psychic-type coverage like Zen Headbutt Cinderace and Psychic Volcarona while benefitting from Toxapex getting rid of items such as Leftovers and Eviolite with Knock Off, spreading status with Scald, Toxic Spikes, and Toxic, and preventing Pokemon like Dragapult and Tapu Bulu from setting up with Haze. Galarian Weezing removes entry hazards with Defog and helps Nihilego with Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon like Dragapult and Garchomp. In return, Nihilego helps it with Fire-types like Volcarona and Rotom-H along with having Dazzling Gleam itself to further improve Dragon matchups. Skuntank and Drapion offer the team Psychic immunity; Skuntank has Sucker Punch to revenge kill Alolan Raichu and Dragapult, while Drapion has utility moves like Knock Off and Toxic Spikes. They also help with Psychic-types like Galarian Slowking, Latias, and Victini. Nidoking offers Stealth Rock and helps with Electric- and Steel-type Pokemon like Regieleki, Tapu Koko, Ferrothorn, and Aegislash.

However, Buzzwole has a middling Speed stat, which makes it unable to outspeed faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Latias and Blacephalon. Buzzwole's low Special Defense stat also means it takes decent damage from even weak attacks like Toxapex's Scald.</p> <h1>Fighting</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Buzzwole is one of the best revenge killers and late-game cleaners for Fighting teams thanks to its high Attack, good physical bulk, and incredible ability in Beast Boost. Its Bug-type STAB move is mandatory for Fighting teams to deal with otherwise problematic Psychic- and Grass-types like Alakazam, Mew, Celebi, and Rillaboom, and its Fighting / Bug typing allows it resist Ground- and Fighting- attacks, increasing its chances to switch in against Pokemon like Excadrill and Terrakion. Buzzwole is vulnerable to status like paralysis and burn from Pokemon like Zapdos and Galarian Corsola, as paralysis cripples it and limits the possibility to act as deadly revenge killer, while burn halves its offensive power. Buzzwole's Speed tier is average, and it also has poor special bulk, so faster threats like Choice Scarf Blacephalon and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele outspeed and revenge kill it. It faces competition with Heracross due to having the same typing, but Heracross has a stronger Bug-type STAB move and better Speed and Special Defense.

  "Melmetal": {
    "overview": "<h1>Steel</h1> <p>Melmetal is a frightening wallbreaker on Steel teams thanks to its sky-high Attack stat and its ability in Iron Fist allowing it to be a fearsome wallbreaker. Its great natural bulk allows it to tank a variety of attacks, such as Garchomp's Earthquake, and then dish out massive damage. Iron Fist increases the power of its Double Iron Bash, Ice Punch, and Thunder Punch, further improving its wallbreaking prowess. Superpower, Ice Punch, and Thunder Punch all allow Melmetal to target various Pokemon that Double Iron Bash isn't as effective against. Even with all these great qualities, its poor Speed means it will usually need to be healthy to tank an attack and do damage, making it more vulnerable to burns and reducing its overall effectiveness. Its special bulk is quite poor, allowing many strong special attackers such as Hydreigon and Nidoking to easily take it out with their super effective STAB attacks. Additionally, Melmetal needs to be carefully added onto Steel teams, as, it is best in matchups that Steel already excels in. Further, between the defensive core and various other options to target weaker matchups, which space is already very limited on Steel teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Steel</h1> <p>Melmetal can use Assault Vest to tank strong special attacks such as Choice Specs Hydreigon's Fire Blast while still being able to OHKO it with Superpower. However, Melmetal is noticeably weaker without a Choice Band and Double Iron Bash becomes a roll to OHKO Hydreigon. Melmetal can invest 244 in its Special Defense over HP in order to better take on special attackers such as Tapu Koko. Melmetal can use Facade over Superpower or Thunder Punch to still hit with significant power while burnt; however, it generally prefers the extra coverage those two moves bring to take on Ferrothorn and Mantine, respectively.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Steel</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective Special Attacks: Special super effective attacks such as Heatran's Magma Storm, Nidoking's Earth Power, and Thundurus-T's Focus Blast are capable of OHKOing Melmetal. Most of Melmetal's bulk comes from its Defense stat, so it can be worn down by strong special attacks fairly quickly; however, these foes do need to be careful, as Double Iron Bash or a coverage move can do a good chunk of damage to them.</p> <p><strong>Steel-resistant Pokemon: Since Melmetal will mainly be clicking Double Iron Bash, Pokemon that resist Steel and can tank it such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Skarmory are bothersome; however, they do need to be careful of Melmetal's coverage moves such as Superpower and Thunder Punch.</p> <p><strong>Burn: Pokemon capable of inflicting Melmetal with a burn such as Galarian Corsola with Will-O-Wisp and Toxapex with Scald can cripple it, as its only value comes from its monumental Attack stat.</p> </section>",

Since Double Iron Bash strikes twice, it can take on many Pokemon with defensive abilities such as Mimikyu and Dragonite, as well as effectively hit Substitute users such as Kyurem. Ice Punch allows Melmetal to hit Flying- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Garchomp. Earthquake allows it to hit Electric-, Poison-, and Steel-type Pokemon for super effective damage such as Alolan Raichu, Toxapex, and Aegislash. Superpower hits Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and other Pokemon such as Rotom-W that can switch into its other attacks. Thunder Punch nails Water- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Slowbro, Mantine, and Celesteela. 12 EVs in Speed allow Melmetal to outpace uninvested Toxapex. Melmetal is a powerful wallbreaker; therefore, it is best to bring it in safely to wallbreak. When Melmetal is in battle, most of the time it should attack with Double Iron Bash, unless one of its coverage moves will hit the foe or a predicted switch-in harder.</p> <p>Magnezone can trap Steel-type Pokemon for Melmetal such as Celesteela in Flying teams, allowing Melmetal to fairly easily click Double Iron Bash. The two also form a great wallbreaking core, as Magnezone can break physical walls for Melmetal such as Skarmory, and Melmetal can break past special walls for Magnezone such as Blissey. Aegislash, Celesteela, and Heatran form an immunity core that covers all of Melmetal's weaknesses, which gives it a solid backbone to fall back on. The immunity core can also wear down the opposing team, allowing Melmetal to break through its foes more easily late-game. Ferrothorn helps Melmetal by providing it with a Water resistance, entry hazard support in Spikes or Stealth Rock, and Leech Seed support. Ferrothorn can also break past Pokemon that wall Melmetal such as Swampert and Gastrodon. Excadrill provides an Electric immunity, entry hazard removal with Rapid Spin, and a way to take on Pokemon such as Rotom-W, which would otherwise wall Melmetal, thanks to Mold Breaker Earthquake. Excadrill can also help Melmetal break down shared checks such as Mandibuzz and Swampert with a Swords Dance-boosted attack. Bisharp can take care of Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon for Melmetal such as Victini and Blacephalon with Sucker Punch.

High Jump Kick is to hit Dark- and Rock-type Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Tyranitar. Sucker Punch allows Cinderace to target faster threats such as Dragapult while also being able to pick off weakened threats. U-turn allows it to pivot out of a bad matchup such as against Toxapex and bring in the appropriate teammate. U-turn can also be used to pick up momentum when Cinderace forces a switch. Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to ignore hazards on the field so that it can use Court Change effectively. Cinderace should use Court Change when it is more beneficial to switch hazard fields, such as against a hazard stacking team to punish them rather than clearing the hazards with Torkoal's Rapid Spin. Libero is Cinderace's ability of choice as it gives a STAB boost for all of its attacks, notably allowing Sucker Punch to OHKO Dragapult after Stealth Rock chip.</p> <p>All of Cinderace's teammates appreciate its ability to generate momentum with U-turn and swap hazard fields with Court Change.

Its Steel typing also gives it a Toxic immunity, meaning Corviknight can take on defensive Stealth Rock setters such as Hippowdon, Shuckle, Piloswine, and Seismitoad that may carry the move. Pressure is particularly good on this set, as it means Corviknight can PP stall Stealth Rock users and keep entry hazards off the field more easily in conjunction with Defog. Body Press hits Pokemon such as Bisharp, Cloyster, Mamoswine, Excadrill, and Tyranitar for super effective damage, allowing Corviknight to check these Pokemon reliably. U-turn is important for Corviknight, as it can grab momentum against Pokemon it can't beat like Toxapex and Aegislash and bring in a teammate to more reliably take them on. Throughout the game, Corviknight should aim to find opportunities where it can comfortably use Defog or grab momentum using U-turn by switching in on Pokemon it walls. Maximum HP and Defense investment allows Corviknight to check the aforementioned Pokemon in Mamoswine, Weavile, Cloyster, Excadrill, and Bisharp with more reliability while also boosting the power of Body Press to check these threats.</p> <p>Because Flying teams are typically weak to Stealth Rock, all of Corviknight's teammates appreciate its incredible reliability as a Defogger to keep entry hazards off the field. Choice Scarf Charizard is a great teammate for Corviknight, as it can outspeed and beat threats to Corviknight such as Choice Scarf Duraludon, Hydreigon, Aegislash, and Heliolisk; Charizard also appreciates Corviknight's Defog due to its 4x Stealth Rock weakness. Choice Scarf Noivern is another teammate that can outspeed and beat Dragon-type Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Dracovish and Choice Specs Dragapult. Corviknight's U-turn is also good for bringing Charizard and Noivern in comfortably in matchups such as Steel and Dragon, respectively. Togekiss is a great setup sweeper that can break through Pokemon with Nasty Plot in conjunction with Thunder Wave and Air Slash, such as Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, and Dragapult, that Corviknight can't get past.

It's a staple for Steel teams because its typing gives it a very important Ground immunity that lets it check threats such as Excadrill as well as taking neutral damage from Fighting-type attacks. Special Defense investment is crucial because it allows Corviknight to comfortably switch into attacks such as Gengar's Shadow Ball and Flygon's Flamethrower. Mirror Armor is used to take on common Mystical Fire users, such as Hatterene, Indeedee, and Gardevoir, and lower their Special Attack. Mirror Armor can also help it avoid Special Defense drops from attacks like Shadow Ball. Bulk Up boosts Corviknight's already decent Defense, making it more difficult to take down, and increases its offensive pressure by boosting its Attack, allowing Brave Bird to break defensive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Hippowdon more easily. Brave Bird is its best STAB move and hits threatening Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Kommo-o that take very little from its other attacking options for super effective damage. Alternatively, it can use Power Trip, which becomes very strong after a couple of boosts, to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively at the cost of not being able to take on Fighting-types as effectively. Roost, paired with Leftovers, gives Corviknight a form of recovery to support its bulky setup and increase its longevity. Taunt prevents Toxapex from using Haze, Hippowdon from phazing Corviknight with Whirlwind, Ferrothorn from setting up entry hazards, and other Pokemon from recovering, setting up, or using their own Taunt. Due to its great bulk, Corviknight can afford to switch into threatening attacks, as its main role is to apply defensive pressure. It should find opportunities to use Bulk Up against passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and against Pokemon that don't threaten to 2HKO it such as Choice Scarf Terrakion.</p> <p>Ferrothorn forms a great defensive core with Corviknight and provides an important resistance to Water for Steel teams, as they're threatened by powerful attacks such as Seismitoad's Hydro Pump. Ferrothorn can also use Leech Seed and set up entry hazards to soften up the opposing team to make it easier for Corviknight to sweep. Excadrill covers Corviknight's weakness to Electric-type attacks, such as Zeraora's Plasma Fists, and can threaten Electric- and Fire-types such as Rotom-H and Charizard with its Mold Breaker Earthquake and Rock Slide, respectively, as well as revenge killing threats such as Hydreigon and SubToxic Salazzle. Choice Scarf Duraludon is another great partner that can revenge kill troublesome Pokemon such as Dragapult and Hydreigon and use Thunder Wave to spread paralysis on the opposing team to give Corviknight an easier time dealing with otherwise faster foes. Aegislash appreciates Corviknight's Ground immunity and in return can wallbreak the opposing team to weaken Corviknight's checks. Aegislash's Fighting immunity allows it to check threats such as Terrakion, and its good bulk also lets it survive some attacks that threaten Corviknight, such as Hydreigon and Dragapult's Fire Blast, whose users Aegislash can OHKO in return. Jirachi is a good option for breaking Water teams with its great coverage, notably being able to threaten Keldeo and Toxapex with its STAB-boosted Psychic. Melmetal is a very powerful and bulky wallbreaker that can soften up the opposing team to allow Corviknight to set up more easily and win. Lucario and Bisharp can also break holes in the opponent's team by setting up with Nasty Plot and Swords Dance, respectively, and they're great against Dark- and Psychic-type teams.</p> "

Rapid Spin gives Rock teams a way to remove hazards like Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes in matchups such as Poison and Bug that could stop a teammate from sweeping. Flame Body is very good against physical attackers such as Jirachi and Bisharp to hinder them with a burn. Use Coalossal early-game to get down Spikes to make it easier for its teammates to sweep. It is also useful mid-game to help get rid of troublesome entry hazards. 252 HP and 252 Special Defense EVs with a Sassy nature let Coalossal take hits from Mew and Hatterene.</p> <p>Setup sweepers such as Terrakion, Rhyperior, and Tyranitar appreciate Coalossal removing entry hazards like Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes that could stop them from sweeping. Barbaracle is an excellent teammate to take care of Ground-types such as Seismitoad and Mamoswine with Grass Knot and Liquidation, and it appreciates Coalossal to break Dugtrio's Focus Sash with Spikes. Shuckle can form a hazard stacking duo with Coalossal to further support setup Pokemon, setting Stealth Rock and Sticky Web to help its teammates such as Shell Smash Barbaracle, Swords Dance Terrakion, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar sweep. Tyranitar is also useful for setting sand that helps Coalossal stomach special attacks even better. Rhyperior is great for taking care of Corviknight with Smack Down + Earthquake, which Coalossal struggles to deal with. Terrakion can greatly help with taking care of Excadrill, Urshifu-S, and Hydreigon with Close Combat. Lycanroc-D helps to handle Poison-types such as Toxapex and can use Accelerock to finish off Pokemon like Volcarona and Scolipede. Lunatone can also be a good partner, as it can come in on Ground-type attacks due to Levitate and take care of troubling Pokemon like Toxapex thanks to its Psychic typing.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its Dragon typing and Thick Fat ability, Appletun plays an important role as a Fire-resistant Pokemon on Grass-type teams. Its high HP combined with its decent Special Defense allows it to comfortably tank special hits that aren't super effective such as Dragapult's Shadow Ball and Hydreigon's Dark Pulse. Investment in Special Defense is chosen because most Fire-type attacks are special and Appletun's most valuable trait is resisting Fire. Recover combined with Leech Seed, Protect, and Leftovers can be problematic to deal with, as it gives Appletun a lot of ways to recover HP and stall out the foe. Protect is also very important for scouting Choice users such as Dracozolt, Dragapult, and Hydreigon, allowing Grass teams to take advantage by making the right switch. Appletun's bulk allows it to pivot in on attacks that don't threaten to OHKO it such as Gengar's Focus Blast and gain momentum by using Leech Seed, followed up by Protect to scout the opponent's next move and gain more recovery from Leech Seed and Leftovers.</p> <p>Ferrothorn forms a great defensive core with Appletun, as they cover each other's weaknesses. Appletun resists Fire-type attacks that threaten Ferrothorn and the rest of the team, while Ferrothorn is immune to Poison, resists Dragon, and takes neutral damage from Ice-, Flying-, and Bug-type attacks. This comes into play against threats such as Galarian Darmanitan, Choice Specs Hydreigon, and Indeedee, which have the coverage to threaten both Appletun and Ferrothorn, but Protect allows them to scout which move they're going for and make the appropriate switch. Ferrothorn can also set up entry hazards, which Appletun can take advantage of by using Leech Seed to force switches and Protect to scout Choice users, resulting in the opposing team taking a lot of damage. Whimsicott also covers Appletun's Dragon weakness and threatens Dragon-type teams, which are hard for Grass to deal with. Whimsicott also appreciates Appletun's Leech Seed to get recovery when it switches in on a Dragon-type attack. In addition, Whimsicott can use Encore on Pokemon trying to setup or lock them into a recovery or status move. Rotom-C threatens Flying-types, most notably Corviknight and Togekiss, which pose huge threats to Grass. Rillaboom is a good partner and great Choice Scarf user that can threaten Ferrothorn with Superpower, which otherwise would be very hard for Grass teams to break. Choice Scarf Rillaboom can outspeed and threaten some problematic Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Choice Scarf Gardevoir, and Dragapult.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Water</h1> <p>Barraskewda is the premier Swift Swim user on rain-based Water teams due to its blazing high Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire metagame in rain, and ability to hit hard. Due to these traits, Barraskewda is useful in a plethora of matches, namely Electric and other matchups such as Dark, which it can take on by itself. This is backed by its great coverage moves in Close Combat, Psychic Fangs, and Crunch, allowing it to hit a multitude of different threats such as Kyurem, Amoonguss, and Slowking. Flip Turn grants rain teams with more pivoting, allowing the archetype to have a lot of momentum. However, Barraskewda has pretty poor defensive stats, meaning it can be easily revenge killed by faster threats outside of the rain such as Dragapult and common priority such as Bisharp's Sucker Punch and Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak.</p> ",

Close Combat targets Water-resistant foes such as Zarude and OHKOes Ferrothorn and other Steel- and Normal-types such as Magnezone and Heliolisk after minor chip damage. Psychic Fangs grants Barraskewda coverage against Poison- and Fighting-types such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, Keldeo, and Urshifu-R. Crunch can be used over Psychic Fangs to target Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Latios, Dragapult, and Jellicent. Flip Turn allows Barraskewda to chip foes such as physically defensive Rotom-W, allowing it to KO it later with Waterfall, and maintain momentum. Swift Swim allows Barraskewda to outpace threats such as Alolan Raichu in Electric Terrain, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Thundurus-T in rain. Maximum Speed investment alongside a Jolly nature allows Barraskewda to outspeed Tapu Koko and Spectrier outside of rain while outpacing +2 Adamant Dragapult in rain. An Adamant nature can be used to 2HKO Toxapex with Psychic Fangs and 2HKO Mandibuzz in rain with Waterfall. Barraskewda and its teammates can continually spam Flip Turn and their pivoting moves, allowing rain teams to continually generate momentum and bring in Barraskewda safely.</p> <p>All of Barraskewda's teammates appreciate it taking on threats such as Alolan Raichu, Zeraora, and +2 Volcarona in rain and generating momentum with Flip Turn. Pelipper enables Swift Swim, making it a mandatory teammate for Barraskewda. Physically defensive Pelipper can take on threats such as Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu with Hurricane, bring Barraskewda in safely with U-turn, provide a reliable Ground immunity, and clear entry hazards for it with Defog. Urshifu-R is a powerful wallbreaker that can eliminate Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, clearing a path for Barraskewda in the Steel matchup. It can also help Barraskewda break down shared checks such as Iron Defense Corviknight with Surging Strikes and deal with bulky Water-types such as Mantine and Pelipper with Thunder Punch. Swampert sets Stealth Rock, provides an Electric immunity, takes on Electric-types like Zeraora outside of rain with Earthquake, and brings Barraskewda in safely with Flip Turn. Slowking provides a reliable switch-in into Psychic-type attacks such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's Psychic, helps Barraskewda pressure Poison- and Water-types like Toxapex with Future Sight, and safely brings in Barraskewda with Teleport. Slowking also acts as a nice sponge for special attacks such as Latios's Draco Meteor. Kingdra is Barraskewda's best partner, targeting matchups where Barraskewda struggles such as Dragon, taking on Grass-types like Amoonguss and Zarude with Hurricane, and generating momentum with Flip Turn. Like Kingdra, Choice Scarf Tapu Fini can help out in the Dragon matchup without being reliant on rain, cripple walls such as Porygon2 with Trick, and clear entry hazards with Defog. Crawdaunt can put in work in the Psychic and Ghost matchups, claiming an OHKO each time it is brought in safely, as well as disrupting opposing progress in the Water mirror by taking out Slowking and Toxapex.</p> "

Furthermore, due do its very middling Speed, Sticky Web support from Vikavolt is greatly needed in order for it to outspeed opposing Pokemon. Finally, slow pivot support from Pokemon like Rotom-W immensely benefits Toxtricity, allowing it to be brought in safely and gain KOs, as its mediocre defenses disallow it from taking on many attacks.

Sludge Wave is primarily used against Fairy- and Grass-type Pokemon, as otherwise, Boomburst is its most powerful attack. Volt Switch allows Toxtricity to pivot and give its teammates safe switches in or put its foe in range of its attack the next time it switches in. Toxtricity's part-Electric typing makes it very valuable against Water- and Flying-type teams and allows it to break Corviknight, which is otherwise a threat to Poison. Its Speed and bulk are mediocre, hence it prefers switching in on passive Pokemon that can't do too much damage or being brought in on a predicted switch.</p> <p>Galarian Weezing covers Toxtricity's big weakness to Ground-type attacks and can remove entry hazards that hinder Toxtricity's longevity with Defog. Drapion is immune to Psychic-type attacks that threaten Toxtricity and can set up Toxic Spikes to weaken the opponent's team to support Toxtricity's wallbreaking. Drapion also has access to STAB Knock Off, which provides useful utility in removing the foe's item. Gengar is a great revenge killer that can handle faster threats such as Hydreigon and Galarian Darmanitan. Salazzle helps break Steel-type Pokemon, notably Ferrothorn, which are problematic for Poison teams to deal with. It can also annoy many teams with its Corrosion-boosted Toxic combined with Substitute and Protect, and it pivots into Toxapex. Defensive Vileplume is a great partner for checking Mold Breaker Excadrill thanks to its typing, which lets it take neutral hits from Ground, and access to Strength Sap and Sleep Powder, which allow it to consistently check it. Toxapex acts as a great pivot to strong attacks that threaten Toxtricity such as Charizard's Fire Blast and Weavile's Icicle Crash.</p> "

Giga Drain does more damage to Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types and lets Polteageist heal some HP. White Herb gets rid of the Defense drops from Shell Smash to give Polteageist a better chance of surviving an attack while setting up. Focus Sash is another option; however, Ghost teams don't tend to run entry hazard removal, making it inconsistent. Even at +2 Speed, Polteageist doesn't outspeed Choice Scarf Gengar and some weather sweepers such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Swift Swim Barraskewda, making Weak Armor is the preferred ability for the additional +2 boost in Speed if Polteageist gets hit with a physical attack. However, even though it has good Special Defense, Polteageist's low HP and Defense mean it can't set up so easily in front of powerful attackers.

Galarian Corsola and Runerigus can set up Stealth Rock for even more damage to the opposing team, supporting Polteageist's late-game sweep. Runerigus can also use Memento to give Polteageist easy setup opportunities.

Psychic allows it to target Poison-type Pokemon such as Galarian Weezing and Toxapex while also being a powerful STAB move so Hatterene can take on Pokemon such as Charizard. Draining Kiss allows Hatterene to apply offensive pressure while being able to heal itself, letting it more easily take advantage of its Calm Mind boosts. Mystical Fire targets Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight after enough boosts. Alternatively, Trick Room takes advantage of Hatterene's low Speed and impressive bulk after a Calm Mind, making it harder to revenge kill for faster threats such as Gengar, Dracovish, and Charizard.

Magic Bounce allows Hatterene to bounce back entry hazards and status moves, which is very useful considering Psychic-type teams lack good hazard control.

Alakazam can act as an emergency check to physical attackers such as Urshifu-S, Azumarill, Bisharp, and Scolipede thanks to Magic Guard and a Focus Sash. Alakazam can also act as a powerful setup Pokemon with Nasty Plot that can revenge kill threats such as Scizor with +2 Expanding Force. Choice Scarf Jirachi can take on Fairy- and Ice-type Pokemon that are capable of threatening Hatterene, such as opposing Hatterene and Galarian Darmanitan, with Iron Head. Jirachi can also provide Hatterene with a second chance through Healing Wish or pivot it in safely with U-turn. Gardevoir can alleviate Hatterene's pressure to act as the team's sole check to Dark-type Pokemon, as well as provide Hatterene with a Healing Wish.

Celebi can set Stealth Rock for Psychic teams as well as act as a resistance to Water-, Ground-, and Electric-type Pokemon such as Seismitoad, Rhyperior, and Alolan Raichu.

Rest and Sleep Talk are used together to give Grimmsnarl a form of recovery, allowing Grimmsnarl to set up more consistently. With Rest, Grimmsnarl makes a good sponge to status conditions such as burn and Toxic poison as well. Spirit Break is used to deal significant damage against types such as Dragon and Fighting and in mirror matchups. The Special Attack drop from Spirit Break also allows Grimmsnarl to take on specially offensive Pokemon that it struggles against, such as Duraludon, pairing well with Bulk Up boosting its Defense. Prankster complements Grimmsnarl's whole set, as it allows Grimmsnarl to almost always move first, helping Dark-type teams with handling powerful foes such as Dracovish and Dracozolt. However, Sleep Talk rolls often are too unreliable to handle Steel- and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Corviknight, Duraludon, and Gardevoir, so it is recommended to not take any risks against foes that can naturally beat Grimmsnarl. Leftovers grants Grimmsnarl additional passive recovery. A specially defensive EV spread is used because Grimmsnarl's physical stats are already boosted by Bulk Up.</p> <p>Hydreigon acts as a solid wallbreaker with its excellent coverage and firepower, eliminating threats such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Duraludon for Grimmsnarl, and both Pokemon drastically improve the Dragon-type matchup. Drapion sets up Toxic Spikes for Grimmsnarl, forcing opposing Pokemon to switch more often, thus allowing Grimmsnarl to set up more consistently. With a Choice Scarf set, Drapion also drastically improves the Fairy-type matchup. Tyranitar can set up Stealth Rock, which can negate Focus Sash and Sturdy of foes like Duraludon to prevent them from revenge killing Grimmsnarl. With its good special bulk, Tyranitar can also handle specially offensive Fairy-type threats for Grimmsnarl, such as Ribombee and Gardevoir. Bisharp's part Steel typing allows it to handle slow Fairy-types such as Clefable and Hatterene. It can also beat opposing RestTalk Grimmsnarl and has a powerful STAB priority in Sucker Punch that helps with taking on fast threats such as Dracovish. Mandibuzz provides Defog support to Grimmsnarl, which allows Grimmsnarl to switch in and set up more safely. With Toxic, it can also cripple threats such as Hippowdon that prevent Grimmsnarl from setting up. Mandibuzz also provides a handful of neutralities to types such as Bug and Fighting and a Ground-type immunity for teammates such as Tyranitar and Drapion.</p> "

Prankster is amazing for this set, as it gives priority to Grimmsnarl's Bulk Up along with Rest and Sleep Talk; this helps tremendously against offensive Pokemon, as it allows Grimmsnarl to boost, heal, and use Darkest Lariat if picked by Sleep Talk first. Darkest Lariat's the chosen attack, as its ability to hit through Defense boosts allows Grimmsnarl to serve as a solid answer to opposing setup sweepers that boost Defense, such as Corviknight and Snorlax. Darkest Lariat is also effective against Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Bronzong, Reuniclus, Gengar, and Aegislash, while also hitting other Steel-type Pokemon such as Excadrill and Corviknight, which Fairy teams appreciate. Though Rest does give it recovery, be aware that Sleep Talk is not always reliable, so Rest should be used on an as-needed basis. As it has a poor unboosted Defense stat, Grimmsnarl should try to set up on defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight, Bronzong, and Seismitoad rather than wallbreakers such as Mamoswine, Galarian Darmanitan, and Diggersby.</p> <p>Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Togekiss, and Hatterene are good partners for Grimmsnarl, as they can all take down Poison-type Pokemon such as Vileplume and Toxapex that Grimmsnarl often struggles with. Choice Scarf Gardevoir can also beat faster wallbreakers such as Barraskewda, Sand Rush Excadrill, and Mamoswine that give Grimmsnarl issues before it sets up, and it can provide Healing Wish support if Grimmsnarl gets worn down. Because Grimmsnarl forces switches frequently, Clefable's ability to set up Stealth Rock for Grimmsnarl allows it to break apart teams more easily. Mimikyu and Grimmsnarl form a good core that can work together to beat Ghost and Psychic teams with their super effective attacks. Mimikyu can also take on Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Gengar that Grimmsnarl struggles with, while it and Togekiss appreciate Grimmsnarl's ability to serve as a status sponge against status inducers such as Galarian Corsola and Seismitoad with Rest.</p> "

Kommo-o and Noivern can also use Taunt to prevent foes from recovering HP or setting hazards, which is especially useful in matchups against Cloyster. Noivern also forms a U-turn core with Dragapult, being able to generate momentum for the team. Dracovish and Dracozolt are strong wallbreakers that can take advantage of slower Pokemon thanks to their signature moves, Fishous Rend and Bolt Beak, allowing them to take on Hippowdon and Toxapex, respectively.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Dragapult excels at being a special wallbreaker because of its vast special movepool, good Special Attack, and amazing Speed stat that allows it to outspeed various threats in the metagame such as Choice Scarf Dracovish and Dracozolt, Hydreigon, and Gengar, which makes it a massive threat to many teams alike. Using coverage along with its STAB attacks, it's able to take advantage of various matchups like Steel, Water, Dragon, and Ground. Fire Blast, Flamethrower, and Thunderbolt hit Steel- and Water-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Corviknight, Gyarados, and Toxapex for super effective damage. Fire Blast is preferred in order to deal greater damage against Corviknight, while Flamethrower can be used for the consistency. Infiltrator can be used for Substitute users such as Whimsicott and Hydreigon, while Clear Body is useful against teams that carry Sticky Web. Dragapult should generally try to find opportunities where it can wallbreak with little drawback, which is easy to do with its high Speed.</p> <p>Dragapult pairs well with offensive Pokemon such as Polteageist, Gengar, Mimikyu, and Aegislash to break past shared checks and sweep teams. For example, Mimikyu can work together with Dragapult to beat Dragon, while Polteageist and Dragapult can both pose a huge threat to Water. Choice Scarf Gengar can outspeed other Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir and Excadrill that Dragapult dislikes dealing with, and Aegislash appreciates Dragapult's early- to mid-game wallbreaking so that it can try to sweep teams late-game and can cover some of Dragapult's weaknesses using its Steel typing. Dragapult also appreciates defensive Pokemon such as Runerigus, Galarian Corsola, and Sableye. The former two can lay down entry hazards for it to have an easier time wallbreaking and serve as good pivots for Dragapult, while Sableye itself can use Knock Off, Taunt, and Will-O-Wisp to soften up opposing teams. Froslass is a useful partner for Dragapult because of its ability to set Spikes, allowing it to wallbreak more efficiently, and its ability to deny opposing hazards with Taunt.</p> "

Draco Meteor is Dragapult's strongest attack that hits a variety of neutral targets hard while also being particularly useful for beating Dragon-type Pokemon such as Kyurem-B, Duraludon, and Hydreigon. Shadow Ball hits Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon such as Gengar, Mimikyu, Gardevoir, and Hatterene for super effective damage, making Dragapult great in the Ghost mirror matchup in particular. Fire Blast allows Dragapult to revenge kill Steel-, Ice-, and Grass-type Pokemon such as Excadrill, Weavile, and Venusaur with more ease. U-turn is amazing for grabbing momentum against forced switches or against bulky Pokemon such as Corviknight, Snorlax, Tyranitar, and Toxapex that give Dragapult trouble. Infiltrator is the preferred ability, as it allows Dragapult to revenge kill Substitute users such as Kyurem-B and Hydreigon effectively as well as ignoring Aurora Veil and dual screens from Pokemon such as Alolan Ninetales and Grimmsnarl, allowing Dragapult to revenge kill Pokemon with more ease on their respective types. 4 EVs in Defense ensure that it never gets OHKOed by Jolly Cloyster's +2 Ice Shard.</p> <p>Galarian Corsola is an excellent teammate because of its ability to set Stealth Rock as well as serve as a defensive pivot for Dragapult. Stealth Rock is particularly good for putting Pokemon such as Weavile, Choice Scarf Charizard, Alolan Ninetales, and Chandelure in range of Dragapult's attacks as well as breaking Focus Sash against Pokemon such as Cloyster and Dugtrio. Chandelure is a good partner for Dragapult because of its ability to break down bulkier Steel-type Pokemon such as Aegislash and Corviknight with its strong Fire STAB attacks as well as use Substitute to take on Sucker Punch users such as Bisharp and Shiftry. Choice Specs Gengar and Aegislash are both wallbreakers that can beat bulky Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Toxapex as well as take on Fairy-types like Togekiss and Clefable for Dragapult. Swords Dance Aegislash can also beat Pokemon like Tyranitar and Snorlax for Dragapult. Mimikyu and Dragapult work together to take on Dragon teams effectively with their super effective coverage while Mimikyu can also beat Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Mandibuzz for it. Froslass is a decent teammate on hyper offensive teams because of its ability to use Taunt on Sticky Web setters such as Galvantula and Araquanid that hinder Dragapult's revenge killing capabilities as well as use Spikes to continuously wear down teams in conjunction with Dragapult's ability to force switches and grab momentum with U-turn.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Dragapult is a fantastic setup sweeper that takes advantage of its high natural Speed, outspeeding all of the unboosted metagame after a single turn, which makes it not only tricky to wall but also much harder to effectively revenge kill. Dragon Dance allows Dragapult to OHKO threats such as Diggersby and Zeraora and 2HKO Toxapex with Dragon Darts after a single boost as well as outspeed Adamant Excadrill in sand and Kingdra in the rain, and after using Dragon Dance twice, it can outspeed Hawlucha after Unburden. Dragon Darts is its main STAB attack and can severely dent any Pokemon that does not resist it. Phantom Force hits Pokemon that resist Dragon Darts such as Excadrill and Hatterene. Substitute allows Dragapult to avoid status moves from Pokemon such as Toxapex and grants it more opportunities to set up Dragon Dance. Sucker Punch can be used to gain an advantage over opposing Dragon Dance Dragapult and attack before Cinderace's Sucker Punch, Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak, and Rillaboom's Grassy Slide. Dragon Fang notably allows Dragon Darts to OHKO offensive Volcarona, but Leftovers is an option that gives Dragapult more opportunities to set up Substitute. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs alongside an Adamant nature allow Dragapult to move as fast and strike hard. 4 Defense EVs allow it to always survive +2 Jolly Cloyster's Ice Shard.</p> <p>Galarian Corsola is the best partner Dragon Dance Dragapult can ask for many reasons; the first is its ability to set Stealth Rock up, allowing Dragapult to serve as a setup sweeper more effectively. It can also cripple physical attackers such as Tapu Bulu with Will-O-Wisp alongside Strength Sap, potentially provide Dragapult free turns to set up Dragon Dance through Cursed Body, and serve as a general physical pivot into Pokemon such as Cinderace for Dragapult. Mimikyu forms a physical setup core with Dragapult, as it can take on Dark- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, Urshifu-R, and Terrakion for Dragapult with its STAB and coverage moves in Play Rough and Drain Punch as well as revenge kill Pokemon such as Hatterene under Trick Room thanks to its ability Disguise. Aegislash provides a specially defensive wall that can pivot into Dragon-, Fairy-, and Ice-type attacks such as Duraludon's Draco Meteor, Primarina's Moonblast, and Avalugg's Avalanche thanks to its Steel typing. It can also act as a Choice Specs wallbreaker or physical setup sweeper, allowing it to take on Pokemon like Corviknight and Chansey for Dragapult. Dragapult appreciates Choice Specs Gengar's ability to punch holes in walls such as Mandibuzz, Galarian Weezing, Skarmory, and Tyranitar with its coverage moves. Choice Scarf Gengar, on the other hand, can act as a revenge killer against Pokemon such as Zeraora for unboosted Dragapult. Jellicent can, like Galarian Corsola, cripple physical walls with Strength Sap and Will-O-Wisp while also preventing slower Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex from setting entry hazards with Taunt. Alolan Marowak and Chandelure most simply can break through Steel-type Pokemon for Dragapult. Substitute Chandelure, in particular, can take on Pokemon, such as Bisharp, while Alolan Marowak is a strong Swords Dance attacker able to soften physically defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Braviary for Dragapult to sweep more easily.</p> "

Surging Strikes in particular allows Urshifu-R to hit through Defense boosts from Magnezone and Mimikyu's Disguise. Unseen Fist allows Urshifu-R to prevent opposing Pokemon from scouting what move it will use. This allows it to break through types like Steel, where Aegislash and Ferrothorn cannot use Protect and see whether Urshifu-R will use Close Combat or Surging Strikes. It also has moves like U-turn to pivot and Thunder Punch to hit Pokemon that resist both of its STAB moves, like Mantine and Pelipper. However, Urshifu-R has an average Speed tier and is unable to outspeed threats like Zapdos and Zarude. This means Urshifu-R sees competition from Keldeo, which is able to outspeed and dent these Pokemon. Its mediocre Speed doesn't hinder its wallbreaking power, though.

It also allows Urshifu-R to break Pokemon that can boost their Defense, like Iron Defense Corviknight, and break Shuckle's Sturdy, which lets Urshifu-R KO it before it sets any entry hazards. Aqua Jet allows Urshifu-R to pick off weakened foes or revenge kill faster Pokemon like Volcarona and Alolan Raichu. U-turn is nice for keeping momentum against foes like Celebi and Slowbro, which tank Urshifu-R's other moves. Thunder Punch hits Mantine, Pelipper, and other Water-types.

Slowking in particular is a great pivot, with Teleport and Future Sight to assist Urshifu-R. Teleport allows Slowking to bring Urshifu-R in safely, and Future Sight allows Urshifu-R to force progress in the Poison and Water matchups. Urshifu-R helps Slowking by checking threats like Kyurem and Weavile. Pelipper sets rain for Urshifu-R, allowing Surging Strikes to OHKO Pokemon like Aegislash and Clefable. Pelipper can also provide Defog and clear entry hazards like Spikes and Sticky Web, which limit Urshifu-R's chances to come in. Swampert and Gastrodon provide switch-ins to attacks from foes like Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu with their Electric immunities; Swampert also sets Stealth Rock. Tapu Fini sets Misty Terrain for Urshifu-R, preventing it from getting statused, and also revenge kills Pokemon like Hydreigon and Garchomp with Choice Scarf. Rotom-W deserves a special mention as a Choice Scarf user, being able to check threats like Thundurus-T and Zapdos. Wallbreakers like Crawdaunt pressure checks to Urshifu-R like Slowbro and Toxapex. Crawdaunt especially can help in the Psychic matchup with its Psychic immunity. Other Knock Off users like Toxapex are incredibly helpful to remove opposing Leftovers and Rocky Helmet.

Choice Specs boosts Regieleki's decent Special Attack to greater heights, making its attacks harder to tank.</p> <p>Tapu Koko is a crucial teammate, as it provides Regieleki with Electric Terrain, which further boosts the power of its moves—especially Rising Voltage. Tapu Koko can also deal with Dragon- and Dark-type Pokemon for Regieleki such as Garchomp and Hydreigon as well as Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon with Grass Knot. Teammates like Zeraora and Alolan Raichu greatly benefit from Regieleki's wallbreaking capabilities, as it's able to blow past Pokemon that check those two such as defensive Zapdos, Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, Blissey, and specially defensive Drapion. In return, Zeraora provides Knock Off support and can use its Choice Band set to form a wallbreaking core with Regieleki. Alolan Raichu, on the other hand, can capitalize on Regieleki's wallbreaking ability to clean teams late-game and take care of Ground-type Pokemon like Gastrodon, Swampert, and Hippowdon with Grass Knot, which Regieleki dislikes facing. Rotom-W and Zapdos provide a good defensive backbone and pair of Ground immunities for Regieleki to rely on while also providing Defog support to keep it healthy and not slowed down by Sticky Web. Defensive Zapdos with Static also checks problematic Pokemon like Grassy Glide Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu for Regieleki and takes care of them with Heat Wave. Air Balloon Magnezone can trap and beat certain checks to Regieleki such as Ferrothorn and Choice item Excadrill.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Ghost</h1> <p>Spectrier is a dangerous special attacker that can quickly snowball teams thanks to its higher Speed than Pokemon like Garchomp and Keldeo, its access to Calm Mind to set up on and become resilient to the likes of Tapu Fini and Zapdos, a great ability in Grim Neigh, and its Ghost-type attacks hitting most Pokemon for neutral or super effective damage. Spectrier can also take advantage of Water and Ground teams, which lack good switch-ins to Will-O-Wisp + Hex. It can use passive Pokemon like Toxapex, Slowking, and Slowbro to set up with Substitute + Calm Mind, and it has good utility in Will-O-Wisp, which can force out physical attackers such as Garchomp and walls like Celesteela. However, Spectrier has very limited coverage, which makes it unable to take on Dark- and Normal-types such as Tyranitar and Porygon2. It also can get revenge killed by Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Excadrill along with fast Pokemon such as Regieleki and Dragapult.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Ghost</h1> <p>Choice Specs can be used to make Spectrier a fearsome special attacker to anything that does not resist its moves, but it cannot utilize Substitute or Calm Mind to take advantage of passive Pokemon like Toxapex. Nasty Plot with Metronome can turn Spectrier into a fearsome sweeper much faster, which helps it beat walls like Mantine, Zapdos, and Toxapex, but it cannot set up on special attackers like Tapu Fini more consistently without Calm Mind.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Ghost</h1> <p><strong>Normal-types: Spectrier cannot do much against Normal-types such as Blissey, Porygon2, and Obstagoon.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-types such as Hydreigon, Zarude, and Mandibuzz easily take Spectrier's Hex. However, Mandibuzz can be somewhat hindered by Will-O-Wisp weakening Foul Play or Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Naturally faster Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Regieleki, and Dragapult as well as Choice Scarf users such as Excadrill and Landorus-T can OHKO or 2HKO unboosted Spectrier with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards: Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes quickly wear Spectrier down. They are especially problematic due to Ghost not having reliable entry hazard control.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic and Will-O-Wisp easily wear Spectrier down, while Thunder Wave makes it unable to outpace Pokemon like Jirachi and Gengar.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<p>Spectrier can set up forced switches from slower Pokemon such as Urshifu-R and Garchomp and on walls like Celesteela and Ferrothorn with ease due to Substitute and Will-O-Wisp. Substitute blocks status from Pokemon like Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Heatran as well as Leech Seed from Celesteela and Ferrothorn, and is very good to use on predicted switches against Pokemon that fear Will-O-Wisp like Garchomp and Dragonite. Will-O-Wisp is primarily used on physical attackers such as Mamoswine, Dragonite, Garchomp, and Tapu Bulu, but it can be useful together with Hex to 2HKO walls such as Celesteela, Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Swampert. It also allows Spectrier to set up Substitute against defensive Tornadus-T's Knock Off and Mandibuzz's Foul Play. Hex goes well with Will-O-Wisp, as the combination allows Spectrier to beat bulky Pokemon like Celesteela and fast physical attackers such as Terrakion, Urshifu-R, and Garchomp. 52 HP EVs and 200 Defense EVs allow Spectrier to keep its Substitute up against burned Celesteela and Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Galarian Corsola can switch into strong physical attacks from Pokemon like Barraskewda, Choice Scarf Terrakion, and Choice Scarf Excadrill. It can also provide Spectrier with Stealth Rock, Will-O-Wisp, and Cursed Body support, making it easier to sweep. Dragon Dance Dragapult is a great setup sweeper against Dragon and Electric type teams. Dragapult also helps with Pokemon that Spectrier has trouble against like Hydreigon and Zeraora, while Spectrier can take down troublesome walls for Dragapult like Toxapex, Avalugg, and Celesteela. Mimikyu is essential for using its Disguise to beat Dark- and Ghost-types such as Hydreigon, Tyranitar, Zarude, and opposing Dragapult. Mimikyu's Drain Punch can also help take care of Dark- and Normal-types like Bisharp, Obstagoon, and Diggersby. Choice Scarf Blacephalon checks Pokemon like Excadrill, Zarude, and Choice Band Weavile. Gengar is very useful in threatening troublesome Dark-types like Tyranitar and Hydreigon with Focus Blast, Mandibuzz with Thunderbolt, and Grimmsnarl with Sludge Wave. It can also remove Toxic Spikes thanks to its part-Poison typing. Aegislash can use Swords Dance to beat the defensive backbone of Blissey and Porygon2 on Normal teams. SubToxic Aegislash can hinder walls such as Mantine and Zapdos, and Hex Spectrier greatly benefits from Aegislash using Toxic to inflict status onto opposing Pokemon. Its part-Steel typing is also useful against Alolan Ninetales, Rillaboom, and Tapu Lele. Albeit uncommon, Jellicent is a great answer to Kingdra's attacks that Spectrier has trouble taking on.</p> "
