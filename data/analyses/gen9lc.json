        "description": "<p>Mankey is one of the most powerful Choice Scarf users in Little Cup thanks to its high Speed, which allows it to outpace or tie with the entire unboosted metagame. This allows Mankey to beat other common Choice Scarf users such as Magnemite, Mudbray, and Gothita. U-turn allows it to greatly capitalize on the switches it forces. Earthquake is a powerful coverage move that hits Mareanie, Glimmet, and Voltorb. Assurance is used to deal as much damage as possible to Ghost-types, OHKOing Eviolite variants on the switch if Stealth Rock is up, while Ice Punch OHKOes Toedscool and threatens Flying-types like Wattrel. Stone Edge is an uncommon option to hit Larvesta and Flying-types. Vital Spirit can be helpful on teams lacking a Grass-type, as it provides a switch-in to Toedscool's Spore, while Defiant is very useful in matchups against Pokemon such as Sticky Web Surskit and Parting Shot Shroodle, as the Attack boosts make Mankey nigh unwallable. Tera Fighting allows Mankey to hit as hard as possible with Close Combat in situations where an unboosted hit is insufficient. Some of Mankey's best teammates include Toedscool to switch in on Ghost-types and remove entry hazards, which can hamper Mankey's pivoting abilities, and either Gothita or Diglett, which can remove the bulky Poison-types like Mareanie and Foongus that give Mankey trouble. Mankey also performs well as part of a VoltTurn core with Pokemon like Volt Switch Voltorb and U-turn Zorua.</p>"

Gunk Shot is used to hit Pokemon that have already been hit by Knock Off, while Drain Punch OHKOs Pawniard and provides some recovery to increase Grimer's longevity. Drain Punch also allows it to damage other Alolan  Grimer neutrally, making it valuable in matchups against opposing Alolan Grimer. Sleep Talk can be used to make Alolan Grimer a great Foongus check and sleep absorber for the team, while Memento gives sweeper teammates a chance to set up. Imprison, together with a bit of Speed investment, lets Alolan Grimer completely shut down opposing Alolan Grimer. Tera Grass eliminates Grimer's only weakness to Ground and lets it take on opposing Hisuian Voltorb more easily.</p> <p>Alolan Grimer is forced out by Ground-types like Mudbray, Numel, and opposing Toedscool, so checks to those Pokemon like Drifloon, Toedscool, and Shellos are essential. Alolan Grimer pairs well with offensive sweepers like Unburden Shroodle, Shellder, and Numel, which can sweep more easily due to Alolan Grimer weakening the enemy team with Knock Off. Grookey is a good partner as well, since Grassy Terrain gives Alolan Grimer much appreciated passive recovery and cuts damage from Earthquake in half, while Alolan Grimer's Knock Off makes switching into Grookey's Wood Hammer much harder. Volt Switch users like Hisuian Voltorb and Wattrel can help get Alolan Grimer in safely, and they can help pressure and overwhelm Ground-types for each other.</p>"

Volt Switch lets Voltorb deal solid damage while preserving itself and capitalizing on the switches it forces with its Speed. Thunderbolt deals a stronger blow, invaluable against bulky Water-types like Mareanie, Quaxly, and Shellos, and is valuable for cleaning up weakened fast threats. Tera Blast, once Voltorb has Terastallized, gives it the heralded BoltBeam coverage and turns the tables on would-be checks like Toedscool, Mudbray, Diglett, and Wattrel. Because of Voltorb's limited coverage and the prominence of Ground-types, Voltorb often depends on Terastallization (or the threat of it) to function well in a match. Voltorb leans on a few utility options for its fourth move due to its limited movepool; Protect stops Nymble's First Impression from revenge killing it and can scout defensive Terastallizations, especially Tera Water on Toedscool. Taunt prevents setup and entry hazards from the likes of Pawniard, Surskit, and Glimmet, and Thunder Wave neutralizes setup sweepers and faster threats that Voltorb cannot OHKO. Voltorb pairs well with teammates that can switch into its Ground-type checks when it has not Terastallized. Toedscool is a natural partner thanks to its bulk, Ground resistance, and ability to remove entry hazards for Terastallized Voltorb, given its new Stealth Rock weakness. Drifloon's Ground immunity also supports Voltorb well. As a pivot, Voltorb appreciates the support of other pivots to continually put your opponent on the back foot. Nymble has a powerful STAB U-turn and often invites in Mareanie, which Voltorb can pressure. Wingull not only checks Ground-types with its dual STAB types and Ground immunity, but also appreciates Voltorb handling the bulky Water-types that check it.</p>"

Shroodle also excels in an offensive metagame full of setup sweepers, shutting down setup Pokemon  such as Shellder, Crabrawler, and Numel with Encore.  Copycat can be used over Gunk Shot in some situational cases, such as to copy moves like Memento, Stealth Rock, and even damaging moves to potentially revenge kill opponents.
