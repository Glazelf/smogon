This allows Mankey to beat other common Choice Scarf users such as Magnemite, Mudbray, and Gothita. U-turn allows it to greatly capitalize on the switches it forces. Earthquake is a powerful coverage move that hits Mareanie, Glimmet, and Voltorb. Assurance is used to deal as much damage as possible to Ghost-types, OHKOing Eviolite variants on the switch if Stealth Rock is up, while Ice Punch OHKOes Toedscool and threatens Flying-types like Wattrel. Stone Edge is an uncommon option to hit Larvesta and Flying-types. Vital Spirit can be helpful on teams lacking a Grass-type, as it provides a switch-in to Toedscool's Spore, while Defiant is very useful in matchups against Pokemon such as Sticky Web Surskit and Parting Shot Shroodle, as the Attack boosts make Mankey nigh unwallable. Tera Fighting allows Mankey to hit as hard as possible with Close Combat in situations where an unboosted hit is insufficient. Some of Mankey's best teammates include Toedscool to switch in on Ghost-types and remove entry hazards, which can hamper Mankey's pivoting abilities, and either Gothita or Diglett, which can remove the bulky Poison-types like Mareanie and Foongus that give Mankey trouble. Mankey also performs well as part of a VoltTurn core with Pokemon like Volt Switch Voltorb and U-turn Zorua.</p>"

Thunder Wave is a useful tool to hinder opponents, potentially giving Snubbull and its teammates free turns.

Quaxly can use Tera Grass for a better matchup versus Electric- and Grass-types as well as a valuable immunity to Spore from Foongus and Toedscool. Tera Flying can also be used with Brave Bird to turn Quaxly into a more potent offensive threat. Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, such as Hisuian Growlithe, Wingull, and Nymble, are great partners for Quaxly, as they appreciate the removal of entry hazards to be used at their full potential. Foongus is another good partner, as it can safely switch into Grass-types and provides valuable Spore support. Pokemon such as Toedscool and Wattrel check Electric-types for Quaxly.</p>"
