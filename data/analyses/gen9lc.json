This allows Mankey to beat other common Choice Scarf users such as Magnemite, Mudbray, and Gothita. U-turn allows it to greatly capitalize on the switches it forces. Earthquake is a powerful coverage move that hits Mareanie, Glimmet, and Voltorb. Assurance is used to deal as much damage as possible to Ghost-types, OHKOing Eviolite variants on the switch if Stealth Rock is up, while Ice Punch OHKOes Toedscool and threatens Flying-types like Wattrel. Stone Edge is an uncommon option to hit Larvesta and Flying-types. Vital Spirit can be helpful on teams lacking a Grass-type, as it provides a switch-in to Toedscool's Spore, while Defiant is very useful in matchups against Pokemon such as Sticky Web Surskit and Parting Shot Shroodle, as the Attack boosts make Mankey nigh unwallable. Tera Fighting allows Mankey to hit as hard as possible with Close Combat in situations where an unboosted hit is insufficient. Some of Mankey's best teammates include Toedscool to switch in on Ghost-types and remove entry hazards, which can hamper Mankey's pivoting abilities, and either Gothita or Diglett, which can remove the bulky Poison-types like Mareanie and Foongus that give Mankey trouble. Mankey also performs well as part of a VoltTurn core with Pokemon like Volt Switch Voltorb and U-turn Zorua.</p> "

Volt Switch lets Voltorb deal solid damage while preserving itself and capitalizing on the switches it forces with its Speed. Thunderbolt deals a stronger blow, invaluable against bulky Water-types like Mareanie, Quaxly, and Shellos, and is valuable for cleaning up weakened fast threats. Tera Blast, once Voltorb has Terastallized, gives it the heralded BoltBeam coverage and turns the tables on would-be checks like Toedscool, Mudbray, Diglett, and Wattrel. Because of Voltorb's limited coverage and the prominence of Ground-types, Voltorb often depends on Terastallization (or the threat of it) to function well in a match. Voltorb leans on a few utility options for its fourth move due to its limited movepool; Protect stops Nymble's First Impression from revenge killing it and can scout defensive Terastallizations, especially Tera Water on Toedscool. Taunt prevents setup and entry hazards from the likes of Pawniard, Surskit, and Glimmet, and Thunder Wave neutralizes setup sweepers and faster threats that Voltorb cannot OHKO. Voltorb pairs well with teammates that can switch into its Ground-type checks when it has not Terastallized. Toedscool is a natural partner thanks to its bulk, Ground resistance, and ability to remove entry hazards for Terastallized Voltorb, given its new Stealth Rock weakness. Drifloon's Ground immunity also supports Voltorb well. As a pivot, Voltorb appreciates the support of other pivots to continually put your opponent on the back foot. Nymble has a powerful STAB U-turn and often invites in Mareanie, which Voltorb can pressure. Wingull not only checks Ground-types with its dual STAB types and Ground immunity, but also appreciates Voltorb handling the bulky Water-types that check it.</p> "

        "name": "Entry Hazard Setter",
        "description": "<p>Glimmet functions as a premier entry hazard setter due to its ability to set multiple forms of hazards. Mud Shot hits Pawniard, which otherwise walls Glimmet. This has additional utility in lowering opposing Pokemon's Speed, which allows Glimmet to deter setup sweepers, force switches, and give it more opportunities to set entry hazards. Power Gem is a nice STAB option for Drifloon, but Spikes can be used instead to punish grounded Pokemon; Spikes sets should be supported by another Stealth Rock user. Tera Ghost is used to give Glimmet an immunity to Rapid Spin to keep entry hazards up, while Tera Grass makes it better defensively. Grookey works quite well with Glimmet as a result of Grassy Terrain weakening Ground-type moves such as Earthquake; it also has good matchups versus Toedscool and Quaxly to punish Rapid Spin attempts. Drifloon functions as an additional spinblocker that can switch into Ground-type moves. Pawniard helps against Gothita, which annoys Glimmet, and can either help by spreading hazards with Stealth Rock or going on the offensive with Swords Dance.</p> "
