This allows Mankey to beat other common Choice Scarf users such as Magnemite, Mudbray, and Gothita. U-turn allows it to greatly capitalize on the switches it forces. Earthquake is a powerful coverage move that hits Mareanie, Glimmet, and Voltorb. Assurance is used to deal as much damage as possible to Ghost-types, OHKOing Eviolite variants on the switch if Stealth Rock is up, while Ice Punch OHKOes Toedscool and threatens Flying-types like Wattrel. Stone Edge is an uncommon option to hit Larvesta and Flying-types. Vital Spirit can be helpful on teams lacking a Grass-type, as it provides a switch-in to Toedscool's Spore, while Defiant is very useful in matchups against Pokemon such as Sticky Web Surskit and Parting Shot Shroodle, as the Attack boosts make Mankey nigh unwallable. Tera Fighting allows Mankey to hit as hard as possible with Close Combat in situations where an unboosted hit is insufficient. Some of Mankey's best teammates include Toedscool to switch in on Ghost-types and remove entry hazards, which can hamper Mankey's pivoting abilities, and either Gothita or Diglett, which can remove the bulky Poison-types like Mareanie and Foongus that give Mankey trouble. Mankey also performs well as part of a VoltTurn core with Pokemon like Volt Switch Voltorb and U-turn Zorua.</p> "

Volt Switch lets Voltorb deal solid damage while preserving itself and capitalizing on the switches it forces with its Speed. Thunderbolt deals a stronger blow, invaluable against bulky Water-types like Mareanie, Quaxly, and Shellos, and is valuable for cleaning up weakened fast threats. Tera Blast, once Voltorb has Terastallized, gives it the heralded BoltBeam coverage and turns the tables on would-be checks like Toedscool, Mudbray, Diglett, and Wattrel. Because of Voltorb's limited coverage and the prominence of Ground-types, Voltorb often depends on Terastallization (or the threat of it) to function well in a match. Voltorb leans on a few utility options for its fourth move due to its limited movepool; Protect stops Nymble's First Impression from revenge killing it and can scout defensive Terastallizations, especially Tera Water on Toedscool. Taunt prevents setup and entry hazards from the likes of Pawniard, Surskit, and Glimmet, and Thunder Wave neutralizes setup sweepers and faster threats that Voltorb cannot OHKO. Voltorb pairs well with teammates that can switch into its Ground-type checks when it has not Terastallized. Toedscool is a natural partner thanks to its bulk, Ground resistance, and ability to remove entry hazards for Terastallized Voltorb, given its new Stealth Rock weakness. Drifloon's Ground immunity also supports Voltorb well. As a pivot, Voltorb appreciates the support of other pivots to continually put your opponent on the back foot. Nymble has a powerful STAB U-turn and often invites in Mareanie, which Voltorb can pressure. Wingull not only checks Ground-types with its dual STAB types and Ground immunity, but also appreciates Voltorb handling the bulky Water-types that check it.</p> "

It can set up Stealth Rock while being a solid defensive answer to Pokemon such as Drifloon, Deerling, and both forms of Zorua, or it can use Swords Dance and Defiant to become a top-tier sweeper with Sucker Punch. Low Sweep threatens opposing Pawniard, OHKOing after Stealth Rock damage, while also providing Speed control against common switch-ins like Crabrawler. Alternatively, teams that don't fear opposing Pawniard can opt for Night Slash, a consistent source of STAB damage that threatens bulky Water-types and pairs best with Swords Dance. Flying and Ghost are both strong defensive Tera types that address Pawniard's key weaknesses; Tera Flying is a better choice against Diglett, whereas Tera Ghost is better against Fighting-types and doesn't add a Stealth Rock weakness. Tera Dark as an offensive option is more niche, but on Swords Dance + Night Slash sets, it can easily invalidate common Pawniard checks such as Quaxly and Mareanie. One of the best partners for Pawniard is Toedscool, as it is similarly versatile and counters the Pokemon Pawniard struggles with, such as bulky Water-types, Fuecoco, Diglett, and Mudbray. Other great partners are Ghost-types like Drifloon and Hisuian Zorua, as they exploit Fighting-types like Mankey and Crabrawler, which easily KO Pawniard. Most teammates appreciate Pawniard's versatility: Crabrawler, Toedscool, and Drifloon all heavily appreciate its defensive utility, as it switches into these Pokemon's common checks like Hisuian Zorua and Deerling. Pawniard also shines on teams without Glimmet that need a reliable Stealth Rock user, as well as Sticky Web teams that want a potent set-up sweeper and something to deter Drifloon's Defog.</p> "
