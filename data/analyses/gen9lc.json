        "description": "<p>Pawniard's well-rounded stats, typing, and movepool make it one of the best role compressors in Little Cup. It can set up Stealth Rock while being a solid defensive answer to Pokemon such as Gastly, Deerling, and Zorua, or it can use Swords Dance and Defiant to become a top-tier sweeper with Sucker Punch. Low Sweep threatens opposing Pawniard, OHKOing after Stealth Rock damage, while also providing Speed control against common switch-ins like Crabrawler. Alternatively, teams that don't fear opposing Pawniard can opt for Night Slash, a consistent source of STAB damage that threatens bulky Water-types and pairs best with Swords Dance. Flying and Ghost are both strong defensive Tera types that address Pawniard's key weaknesses; Tera Flying is a better choice against Diglett, whereas Tera Ghost is better against Fighting-types and doesn't add a Stealth Rock weakness. Tera Dark as an offensive option is more niche, but on Swords Dance + Night Slash sets, it can easily invalidate common Pawniard checks such as Quaxly and Mareanie. One of the best partners for Pawniard is Toedscool, as it is similarly versatile and counters the Pokemon Pawniard struggles with, such as bulky Water-types, Fuecoco, Diglett, and Mudbray. Another great partner is Gastly, as it easily exploits Fighting-types like Mankey and Crabrawler, which easily KO Pawniard. Most teammates appreciate Pawniard's versatility: Crabrawler, Toedscool, and Gastly all heavily appreciate its defensive utility, as it switches into their biggest counters of opposing Gastly, Deerling, and Choice Scarf Zorua, respectively. Pawniard also shines on teams without Glimmet that need a reliable Stealth Rock user, as well as Sticky Web teams that want a potent set-up sweeper and something to deter Drifloon's Defog.</p> "
