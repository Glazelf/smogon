        "description": "<p>Arcanine stands out as an effective speed control in Mix and Mega due to its powerful form of priority, potent Fire / Fairy STAB combination, and access to Teleport. This Pokemon can perform a wide range of roles such as revenge killing, late-game sweeping, and slow pivot. Altarianite adds a secondary Fairy typing to Arcanine's Fire typing and allows it to fire off Fairy-type STAB Pixilate Extreme Speed, allowing Arcanine to outpace and deal with a large range of the offensive threats in Mix and Mega. Flare Blitz is Arcanine's secondary STAB option and gives it the ability to blow past Steel-types that resist Extreme Speed, such as Corviknight and Solgaleo. Morning Sun gives provides Arcanine with defensive utility and longevity throughout the game and works well with Arcanine's pre-Mega ability Intimidate to act as an emergency check to other Altarianite users like Dragonite. Teleport allows Arcanine to slow pivot out, which gives it a solid niche over other Extreme Speed users less able to make use of the switches they force.</p> <p>Arcanine struggles the most against some of the premier physical walls like Toxapex, Lunala, and Slowbro, so partners that can exploit these Pokemon like Lucarionite Zygarde, Spectrier, and Pheromosa are all good partners. Pheromosa is particularly useful here, as its access to U-turn allows it to keep up the momentum Arcanine wins with Teleport against most teams. In turn, Arcanine is one of the best offensive checks to other Altarianite users like Dragonite, and can bring these relatively fragile Pokemon in safely. Zeraora and Lucarionite Terrakion allow Arcanine to wear down and overwhelm shared physical checks like Slowbro and Lunala, who often prove incapable of staying healthy enough to answer all of them throughout the match. Ampharosite Blissey also pairs extremely well with Arcanine, as it can reliably set Stealth Rock to punish the switches Arcanine forces and can set Toxic on most of Arcanine's defensive checks. In turn, Arcanine serves as reliable speed control on the builds where Blissey fits best and is capable of stopping the threats that seek to exploit Blissey's added Dragon-typing.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With Sablenite, Mandibuzz acts as a consistent defensive answer to threatening attackers such as Spectrier, Lunala, Solgaleo, and Kartana. Foul Play acts as a mandatory STAB move, allowing Mandibuzz to actually defeat the likes of Lunala and Spectrier rather than simply be setup bait, and prevents it from being total setup bait for physical attackers. Knock Off may be used instead to punish Ho-Oh and Eternatus while still chasing out Ghost-type Pokemon, but is generally worse. U-turn allows it to gain momentum versus Pokemon like Dragonite that can use Mandibuzz as setup bait. To gain momentum, it is sometimes worth sacrificing a portion of Mandibuzz's health and U-turn against threats to it like Terrakion, Rhyperior, Zacian, and Zeraora. Defog provides entry hazard control. Alternatively, Toxic is an effective punish to several of Mandibuzz's common switch-ins, such as Ampharosite Blissey, Entei, and Zapdos.</p> <p>Mandibuzz has a few issues: a vulnerability to Stealth Rocks impacts its overall effectiveness. If it's inflicted with the poison or burn status, Mandibuzz will be severely crippled. Furthermore, Magic Bounce is insufficient to avoid status, considering the omnipresence of Scald on bulky Water-types. Mandibuzz also struggles to keep Stealth Rock off the field against threats like Rhyperior, Terrakion, and the ever present Ampharosite Blissey. Since Mandibuzz is faster than Sablenite Corviknight, it will fail to gain momentum when facing it. Finally, the prevalence of Altarianite Entei, Regieleki, and Dragonite is unfavorable to Mandibuzz. To alleviate these matchups, the following are adequate partners: Venusaurite Corviknight, a good defensive blanket check that allows Mandibuzz the freedom to not need defog; Tyranitarite Rhyperior, bringing a key Electric immunity, Stealth Rock, and Entei check; Banettite Toxapex, absorbing status moves and Fairy-type attacks and effectively countering the likes of Ho-Oh. Other bulky Water-types such as Slowbro can work as Entei and Ho-Oh counters that can burn other physical attackers, but they compete with Mandibuzz for the Sablenite slot. Considering Mandibuzz's role as a slow pivot, pairing it with frail breakers such as Terrakion, Zeraora, and Spectrier is ideal. Mandibuzz also appreciates Entei as a teammate, for it pressures many threats to Mandibuzz, such as Terrakion, Zeraora, Dragonite, and Blissey. In return, Mandibuzz can take on Pokemon that bother Entei like Lunala and Mew.</p> "
