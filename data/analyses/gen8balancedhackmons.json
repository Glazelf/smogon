Strength Sap keeps Groudon healthy throughout the game, which allows it to repeatedly switch into foes such as Zamazenta-C and defensive Ho-Oh sets. Zekrom, Magearna, and other slow wallbreakers love Groudon's efficiency at spreading Spikes and paralysis; with Spikes up and foes such as Xerneas and Palkia paralyzed, they're far more difficult to switch into or force out. While Imposter Chansey must risk being crippled by paralysis to switch in against Groudon, it's still important to ensure that Chansey cannot freely set up Spikes when it does. Poison Heal Xerneas with Rapid Spin and Strength Sap helps out with this, as it can clear away Spikes, is unaffected by Glare, and can easily heal off damage from Thousand Arrows.</p> "},

While it's less reliable than Thousand Arrows, the extra power from Precipice Blades enables Groudon to OHKO Zamazenta-C if it opts for Mold Breaker, or to take down Xerneas and Regigigas after a layer of Spikes on Adaptability sets. Trick neutralizes common physical walls such as Giratina and Fur Coat Lunala, and Glacial Lance is another strong option against Giratina that also knocks out Zygarde-C. U-turn can be used to pivot out from physical walls into a specially offensive teammate such as Dialga or Pixilate Xerneas, and these Pokemon can create opportunities for Groudon by inviting in easy prey like Zamazenta-C and Solgaleo. Poison Heal Regigigas sets with Swords Dance and Wicked Blow can weaken Giratina, Zygarde-C, and Fur Coat Lunala so they can no longer switch into Groudon's attacks. Against Imposter users, a teammate with solid physical bulk and reliable recovery can handle the imposter's attacks. Strength Sap Xerneas or a defensive Giratina set can perform this role effectively.</p> "

Teleport, when combined with minimum Speed investment, allows Giratina to almost always move last and safely put its teammates in advantageous situations. Spectral Thief prevents Giratina from becoming setup fodder. Knock Off makes permanent progress and scares out Imposter users, allowing Giratina to Teleport out without risking a Speed tie. Entrainment and Core Enforcer scare out Poison Heal and -ate users, Entrainment functioning against Xerneas and slower Pokemon and Core Enforcer providing a valuable STAB move that also ignores Magic Bounce. Nuzzle spreads paralysis for your team's wallbreakers to capitalize on. Minimum Speed investment allows Giratina to underspeed opposing pivots. Giratina has excellent synergy with Poison Heal users, as it provides valuable entry hazard control and a safe avenue into activating their Toxic Orbs via Teleport. Xerneas is a particularly strong teammate for Giratina, since Xerneas Imposter-proofs Giratina. Strong wallbreakers, such as Kyurem-B and Spectrier, appreciate Teleport's free entry and Magic Bounce helping to limit entry hazard chip. Giratina struggles most with Pixilate Xerneas, Eternatus, and Kyurem-B, as they can either 2HKO or OHKO Giratina, so teammates such as Ice Scales Zamazenta-C and Primordial Sea Steel-types can help check these threats.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Fur Coat Lunala is an excellent wall that can check the majority of physical attackers in the tier, with its typing leaving very few weaknesses and Fur Coat allowing it to easily withstand powerful attacks like V-create and Glacial Lance. Nuzzle provides speed control that can threaten out powerful attackers like Eternatus and Zacian, while Glare still paralyses Groudon and Zygarde-C. Hex is a strong STAB attack that is unresisted by most of the tier and has good synergy with Nuzzle's paralysis to clean up weakened teams. Core Enforcer negates Regigigas's Poison Heal and forces it to switch out, which, when combined with Lunala's immunity to Normal allows it to reliably switch in and scare out Regigigas lacking Wicked Blow. Entrainment improves the matchup against Xerneas and makes Lunala harder to pivot around. Recover provides a reliable recovery option which keeps Lunala in good enough condition to check threats over longer games. Lunala's glaring weakness to Dark-type attacks, most commonly Wicked Blow and Knock Off from Regigigas, makes Zygarde-C a good teammate, as the pair has the physical bulk to withstand threats carrying coverage for the other. Lunala's speed control and ability to scare out offensive threats can be exploited by slower wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B and Groudon. Lunala can self-Imposter-proof to an extent, as a boosted Hex will always 2HKO Eviolite Imposter Chansey, but Ground-type teammates can help negate the Imposter user's Nuzzle to prevent boosting Hex's power.</p> "

With Simple, No Retreat not only offers a massive bulk increase, but also raises Stored Power's Base Power to 220, which when combined with a +2 Special Attack boost is sufficient to OHKO the majority of the metagame. Final Gambit is used alongside Lunala's high HP to heavily damage Prankster users like Groudon and Ho-Oh who look to remove Lunala's boosts. 0 Special Defense EVs, 5 Special Defense IVs, and a Rash nature allow Lunala to always OHKO Imposter Eviolite Chansey with Astral Barrage, whereas using maximum Special Defense allows set up in front of most special attackers. Sweepers like Shift Gear Kyurem-B and Simple Eternatus synergize well with Lunala, as they can exploit Prankster users being absent or heavily injured due to Final Gambit, giving them an easier time cleaning up a team. Pixilate Xerneas makes a good teammate, as it can pressure foes that Lunala is unable to break past such as Yveltal and Ice Scales users like Zamazenta-C. Yveltal also partners well with Lunala as it can safely Imposter-proof with Spectral Thief and has STAB Knock Off to remove Assault Vest, which allows certain targets like Kyogre and Melmetal to survive boosted Stored Power and Astral Barrage, respectively.</p> "

Simple maximizes Eternatus's power after setting up, but it could opt instead for Mold Breaker, which gives it a better matchup against Ice Scales users and Steel-types with Flash Fire. Alternatively, Adaptability boasts greater initial power, which makes Eternatus less reliant on setting up and improves its ability to check Palkia and Xerneas. Blue Flare is a strong coverage option against Steel-types like Zamazenta-C and Magearna. Earth Power is a notably weaker but more accurate alternative that hits Steel-types with Flash Fire or Primordial Sea. Pixilate Xerneas is a great partner for this set, as it appreciates Eternatus softening up the special walls and Steel-types that it struggles with. Additionally, Poison Heal Regigigas loves to switch in on Spectral Thief and Nuzzle aimed at Eternatus. Imposter Chansey can scout opposing teams to identify opportunities for Eternatus to set up and has the massive special bulk necessary to handle Imposter users copying Eternatus.

Volt Switch helps Eternatus chip down its checks, retain momentum, and escape from Anchor Shot, particularly against Zamazenta-C. Blue Flare is a less flexible, but more immediate method of breaking through Steel-types. Trick can be used alongside Black Sludge to cripple Magic Bounce users and special walls that would limit Eternatus's ability to make progress. Wallbreakers such as Pixilate Xerneas and Kyurem-B make for good teammates, as they are adept at forcing switches to maximize the effectiveness of Eternatus's Spikes. Eternatus's Regenerator can be exploited by Imposter Chansey for free recovery, so Pokemon like Magic Bounce Zamazenta-C or Pixilate Rapid Spin Magearna that prevent Imposter from doing too much harm make good partners. Teammates like Desolate Land Ho-Oh and RegenVest Kyogre can lure in Imposter users to Nuzzle them or remove their Eviolite with Knock Off, making it tougher for them to safely switch in against Eternatus later.</p> "
