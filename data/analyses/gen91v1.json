Removing Drain Punch gives harder matchups against Dark-types like Ting-Lu. Not slotting Counter forces it to hit physical Fairy-types like Azumarill and Play Rough Meowscarada with Gunk Shot, which has lower accuracy.</p> </li> <li> <p>The HP and Special Defense investment with a Careful nature allows Annihilape to survive a Hyper Beam from Modest Choice Specs Sylveon. 116 Attack EVs let it 2HKO most Sylveon variants with Gunk Shot turn 1 and Rage Fist turn 2, minimizing miss chances. The remaining EVs are put in Speed to outspeed Modest Sylveon and Modest Magnezone.</p> </li> <li> <p>Annihilape struggles to deal with faster Pokemon with super effective STAB moves like Talonflame, most Dragapult variants, and faster Taunt users such as Booster Energy Great Tusk and Corviknight.</p> </li> </ul> "
