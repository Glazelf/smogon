Taunt is better in denying offensive setup from foes, like opposing Annihilape, and blocking slower Taunt or Encore users such as uninvested Corviknight and Donphan. Encore better punishes defensive setup, such as Garganacl's Iron Defense and stall Arcanine.</p> </li> <li> <p>Annihilape's last moveslot comes with a lot of opportunity costs. Removing Drain Punch gives harder matchups against Dark-types like Ting-Lu. Not slotting Counter forces it to hit physical Fairy-types like Azumarill and Play Rough Meowscarada with Gunk Shot, which has lower accuracy.</p> </li> <li> <p>The HP and Special Defense investment with a Careful nature allows Annihilape to survive a Hyper Beam from Modest Choice Specs Sylveon. 116 Atk EVs let it 2HKO most Sylveon with Gunk Shot turn 1 and Rage Fist turn 2, minimizing miss chances. The remaining EVs are put in Speed to outspeed Modest Sylveon and Modest Magnezone.</p> </li> <li> <p>Annihilape struggles to deal with faster Pokemon with super effective STAB moves like Talonflame, most Dragapult, and faster Taunt users such as Booster Energy Great Tusk and Corviknight.</p> </li> </ul> "
