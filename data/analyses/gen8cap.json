However, it is usually outclassed by Arghonaut, which has phazing and better physical bulk, in this regard. Additionally, the Toxic and entry hazards immunity that Magic Guard provides is usually worth more than running Unaware. On its utility set, Clefable can run Sticky Barb along with Trick to cripple Heatran, Toxapex, Equilibra, and Corviknight. However, Trick lacks the consistency of Knock Off and can sometimes neuter Clefable if it receives an unwanted item, such as an Assault Vest from Galarian Slowking. Encore can be run on the utility set to reduce Clefable's tendency of being setup fodder while allowing it to essentially win against any opposing Calm Mind Clefable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types such as Kartana, Scizor, Melmetal, Equilibra, and Ferrothorn are all good answers to Clefable, as they take little to no damage from Moonblast and force Clefable out with strong Steel-type STAB moves.

Heatran can trap, taunt, and KO Clefable before it gets the chance to setup; Astrolotl can spam Fire Lash until Clefable is forced to switch and is very difficult to wear down; and Volcarona can setup alongside Clefable and beat it one-on-one. However, all of these Pokemon must beware Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Urshifu-R, Swords Dance Garchomp, Tapu Lele, and Rillaboom can overwhelm Clefable and not allow it to switch in due to their immense offensive strength. Rillaboom in particular is a threat, forcing Clefable out with a roll to OHKO with Wood Hammer.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Poison-types such as Toxapex, Chromera, and Galarian Slowking take little from any of Clefable's options and can force it out. It should be noted that Galarian Slowking must be wary of Knock Off, and cannot beat Calm Mind Clefable in a one-on-one.

        "description": "<p>Clefable excels at providing a myriad of utility options to teams while acting as a solid defensive Pokemon due to its typing and bulk. Clefable is a great user of Stealth Rock, as it can take advantage of free turns versus passive Pokemon like Blissey, Toxapex, and Tomohawk. If Stealth Rock is covered somewhere else on Clefable's team, Wish can be run to support teammates that are vulnerable to getting chipped by hazards such as Heatran and Melmetal, while Thunder Wave can spread paralysis and cripple offensive switch-ins like Melmetal, Rillaboom, and Heatran. Knock Off is the best option for the final slot, as it can cripple common Moonblast switch-ins such as Equilibra and Heatran. The given EV spread allows Clefable to survive two uses of Freeze-Dry from Choice Specs Kyurem with Leftovers recovery and two uses of Hex from Heavy-Duty Boots Dragapult without its Leftovers, with the rest invested in Defense to better answer threats like Dragonite and Landorus-T. Alternatively, if Dragapult is already checked on a team, Clefable can run maximum investment in HP and Defense in order to check Weavile and Swords Dance Garchomp.</p> <p>Corviknight and Toxapex are excellent teammates for Clefable, as they can switch in on the physical wallbreakers that Clefable cannot handle such as Rillaboom, Melmetal, and Urshifu-R. Along those lines, Astrolotl, Slowking, and Earthquake Galarian Slowking make great teammates, as they can consistently switch in on Heatran and force it out, though Astrolotl and Slowking must be wary of Toxic. Steel-types such as Equilibra and Scizor can take advantage of Clefable's passivity, so teammates like Arghonaut and Zapdos are appreciated for being able to counter these Pokemon. Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Equilibra are helpful for weakening Heatran and opposing Equilibra and for pressuring Poison-types such as Toxapex, Galarian Slowking, and Nidoking. Finally, if Clefable is running Thunder Wave, Hex Dragapult is an excellent teammate, capable of punishing the special walls that otherwise answer Clefable such as Toxapex and Heatran.</p> "

The final moveslot depends on the team. Flamethrower is used for hitting Equilibra, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn super effectively, while Thunder is mainly for Toxapex, which can otherwise use Haze, and Heatran. Knock Off can be run over a coverage move to cripple Pokemon like Heatran, Equilibra, and Galarian Slowking for itself and its teammates, though this decreases Clefable's sweeping potential. Similarly, Trick in conjunction with Sticky Barb can be used to further maim one of Clefable's checks, though this lacks the consistency of Knock Off. Life Orb is the preferred item, as it enables Clefable to be a strong late-game sweeper, but Leftovers is an option that allows Clefable to be a more effective wall before it sets up. 60 Speed EVs let Clefable outspeed uninvested Corviknight and slower Pokemon like Equilibra, however, one can put those EVs into Defense instead to be a sturdier defensive pivot.</p> <p>Clefable appreciates teammates such as Slowking and Garchomp that can take care of Heatran, which otherwise hard walls sets running Flamethrower. It additionally needs teammates that can switch in on Rillaboom's Wood Hammer and Melmetal's Double Iron Bash, which Skarmory, Zapdos, and Tomohawk all do well. Clefable pairs well with Heatran, Scizor, and Corviknight, which can come in on Equilibra's Doom Desire. In return, Clefable is a solid answer to Landorus-T and Zeraora. Heatran deserves special mention for being able to trap and KO Toxapex, which otherwise can Haze stall Clefable if it lacks Thunder. Furthermore, Heatran pairs well with Knock Off Clefable, as it will be able to remove Toxapex's Shed Shell. Pokemon such as Rillaboom and Tornadus-T help Clefable sweep by weakening Galarian Slowking and Heatran with Knock Off. Finally, Clefable should be paired with a special wall like Galarian Slowking or Colossoil to take on special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Nidoking that threaten it before it sets up.</p> "

Stealth Rock setters like Heatran and Tyranitar can take Ice-type moves to cover one of Garchomp's core weaknesses.

Combining Spikes support from teammates like Astrolotl and Ferrothorn with these VoltTurn cores helps Syclant break past its grounded checks like Toxapex and Melmetal. Other common bulky Steel-types like Heatran can also give Syclant trouble if it's locked into an Ice-type move, so having partners like Slowking and Equilibra that can reliably answer them is greatly appreciated. Finally, Syclant benefits from having reliable pivots on its team because it can struggle to enter the game safely; Slowking, Landorus-T, and Zeraora are all good options that can also apply pressure to common Steel-types that are difficult for Syclant to break past by itself. Syclant in turn heavily pressures Pokemon like Miasmaw that can pose a large threat to some of these pivots.</p> "

However, once Meteor Beam is used, you must try to get significant mileage out of Stratagem, as it's quite underwhelming if it's forced to switch out and lose its boost for good. Paleo Wave is the STAB move of choice after Meteor Beam is used. Fire Blast hits Steel-types like Equilibra and Ferrothorn that want to switch in on a predicted Rock-type move. Earth Power is a more accurate but weaker way to handle certain Steel-types as well as a way to hit Tyranitar, which can threaten to OHKO back. Energy Ball is an option to hit bulky Water-types such as Slowking and Gastrodon that otherwise can switch in quite freely.</p> <p>Stratagem's low defensive stats in tandem with its weakness to common types means it struggles to find the proper timing to switch in, and it must thus rely on its teammates to switch in safely. Offensive pivots such as Krilowatt and Rillaboom can get Stratagem in on advantageous matchups so it can pave the way for them to clean up later. Spikes setters like Astrolotl and Ferrothorn dissuade the opponent from switching around Stratagem and also help it break down walls more easily. Pajantom can trap walls such as both forms of Slowking and Equilibra with Spirit Shackle, allowing Stratagem to switch in rather safely on a guaranteed advantageous matchup. Finally, Rillaboom and Ferrothorn can not only deal with bulky Water-types like Slowking, Tapu Fini, and Arghonaut that would be troublesome for Stratagem to break, but also provide Knock Off utility to remove Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots from the opponent's Pokemon, both of which Stratagem greatly appreciates.</p> "

However, the downside to Dry Skin is that Mollux will take residual damage every turn under sun, so it won't be able to check Fire-type attackers. While serving as a wall, Mollux can also be very threatening because very few Pokemon can resist its two STAB moves and it can spread status easily thanks to Sludge Bomb and Lava Plume. Calm Mind allows Mollux to make the most of this asset, making it all the more threatening and allowing it to check Calm Mind Clefable. 8 Speed EVs allow Mollux to allways outspeed Adamant Conkeldurr.</p> <p>Mollux's key weakness to Stealth Rock forces it to run Heavy-Duty Boots, making it prone to Knock Off. Therefore, it will be forced out against common Knock Off users like Toxapex and Arghonaut.</p> <p>Mollux is a good partner for Corviknight and Equilibra, as their typings defensively complement each other perfectly; both are immune to Ground-type attacks that Mollux is weak to, while Mollux acts as a Fire- and Water-type switch-in. They can also provide hazard removal to clear Stealth Rock away in case Mollux loses Heavy-Duty Boots. Tomohawk and Arghonaut prevent physical attackers like Landorus-T and Colossoil from taking advantage of Mollux. Pokemon that struggle against Clefable like Hydreigon, Kyurem, Dragapult, and Mandibuzz pair well with Mollux, as Mollux counters it. Kyurem and Hydreigon are also good to punish Ground-types like Landorus-T and Hippowdon that annoy Mollux. Grass Knot Zeraora and Toxic Smokomodo are also good options to pressure Ground-types and can help Mollux to sweep. Finally, Dragapult appreciates particularly the status Mollux spreads, potentially allowing it to sweep with Hex late-game.</p> "

That being said, given the right team support, Volkraken can turn into a relatively strong special breaker with the somewhat unique ability to pressure all three of Tomohawk, Equilibra, and Heatran at once. Furthermore, Volkraken's access to Analytic can make switching into it quite terrifying. Fire Blast and Hydro Pump is a near-unique STAB combination in the CAP metagame that can prove to be difficult for some teams to deal with, picking up 2HKOs on the common Tomohawk + Equilibra core. Scorching Sands is by far the best option for the third slot, as it 2HKOes Toxapex and is a roll to OHKO Krilowatt. U-turn is used over Flip Turn to avoid losing momentum against Storm Drain Gastrodon. U-turn additionally chunks Slowking more than Flip Turn. Another option for Volkraken is to run Choice Scarf, which can give it an easier time fitting on teams, though the drop in power is quite noticeable.</p> <p>Volkraken appreciates anything that can help it get in against a foe that is forced to switch out so as to activate Analytic. Accordingly, it enjoys pivots like Kerfluffle, Tapu Koko, and Rillaboom, which appreciate Volkraken's raw breaking power and ability to pivot itself. Rillaboom deserves special mention for consistently beating Volkraken's two biggest counters: Slowking and Gastrodon. Dragapult is another notable pivot that can break through Slowking and appreciates Volkraken pressuring Clefable. Volkraken's ability to wallbreak is further amplified under rain, with nothing in the metagame other than Slowking being able to tank two Hydro Pumps in rain. Therefore, Pelipper and Barraskewda make excellent teammates for Volkraken. Entry hazard removal is key for Volkraken to operate well as it foregoes Heavy-Duty Boots for the power of Choice Specs, so Pokemon such as Equilibra and pivot Tornadus-T are important. Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Zeraora, and Melmetal that need the Tomohawk + Equilibra core to be pressured appreciate Volkraken's ability to dish out heavy damage to teams using this defensive backbone. Miasmaw, particularly the Taunt set, deserves a special mention as a teammate for its unique ability to deny Slowking and Toxapex Regenerator recovery. Finally, setup sweepers like Garchomp and Kartana that require chip damage on Pokemon such as Toxapex and Equilibra to win appreciate Volkraken's ability to force heavy damage on the opponent's team.</p> "

Slower wallbreakers that appreciate being brought in for free with Parting Shot also tend to have great synergy with Kerfluffle. Miasmaw stands out among them as being particularly effective, as it loves the chance to safely switch into Toxapex, Slowking, and Galarian Slowking to deny them their Regenerator healing and make them much easier for Kerfluffle to eventually break through.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Jumbao derives much of its value from being able to support early-game wallbreakers that have late-game cleaning potential with Healing Wish. Additionally, it is one of the best offensive countermeasures to Swords Dance Garchomp in the metagame. It also has a good matchup against most weather teams thanks to Trace, letting it copy Speed-boosting abilities from the likes of Barraskewda, Excadrill, and Arctozolt and potentially revenge kill these foes, in addition to copying Regenerator from foes like Slowking and Slowbro. Jumbao can run Drought with Solar Beam to support teammates like Heatran, but the opportunity cost of not copying useful abilities like Slowking's Regenerator is usually not worth it.</p> <p>Jumbao is straight walled by Galarian Slowking, so Ground-types like Colossoil, Equilibra, and Garchomp help to deal with it. Garchomp in particular is fantastic because Healing Wish lets it break down its checks early-game so it can sweep late-game more easily. Similarly, Fire-types like Heatran and Moltres are problematic, so Water-types such as Slowking, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini are helpful to have. Slowking can also safely bring Jumbao in against Dragon-types like Latios and Hydreigon with Teleport and provide it Future Sight support, making it harder to defensively answer. Wallbreakers like Dragapult and Melmetal appreciate Jumbao's Healing Wish, as it lets them play more aggressively early-game.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb Jumbao is one of the strongest special attackers in CAP, using metagame staples like Slowking and Zeraora as entry points to fire off its strong STAB attacks and coverage. Trace allows Jumbao to copy Slowking’s Regenerator so it can stay healthy and constantly threaten Slowking throughout a game. Trace also allows Jumbao to absorb Zeraora's Volt Switch and switch into most Heatran sets, both of which are useful to balance teams. Leaf Storm and Moonblast pair excellently, as the sheer power of Leaf Storm dissuades Moonblast switch-ins like Toxapex and Equilibra from coming in. Focus Blast is important coverage for Steel-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal. Shore Up helps Jumbao stay healthy, as it is otherwise prone to entry hazard and Life Orb chip damage. A Modest nature allows Leaf Storm to guarantee an OHKO versus Slowking and a 2HKO on Toxapex as it switches in, as well as letting Focus Blast 2HKO Corviknight after Stealth Rock and Scizor after a small amount of chip damage. Timid may occasionally be preferred to outspeed the likes of Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Nidoking.</p> <p>Jumbao pairs well with Steel- and Water-types, which cover its weaknesses to the likes of Melmetal, Scizor, and Volcarona. It pairs incredibly well with Heatran, each resisting every type the other is weak to. Additionally, Heatran can pressure Jumbao's Steel-type checks like Corviknight and Scizor, and it can use Taunt to help weaken Blissey and prevent Slowking from instantly pivoting out with Teleport as Jumbao switches in. Heatran can also use Magma Storm to trap and remove some of Jumbao's checks such as Toxapex and Galarian-Slowking. Jumbao also pairs well with Slowking, which has similar type synergy and can pivot Jumbao in safely with Teleport while additionally setting Future Sight, which makes Pokemon like Toxapex and Tornadus-T unable to switch into Jumbao’s attacks. Toxapex covers Jumbao’s weaknesses to Scizor, Astrolotl, and Weavile and benefits from Jumbao taking advantage of Slowking and Zeraora. Tornadus-T greatly appreciates Jumbao's ability to stave off Zeraora, and in return Tornadus-T can often weaken Jumbao's answers like Blissey and Galarian Slowking with Knock Off.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Much of Equilibra's strength as a team support option in the CAP metagame comes from its powerful Doom Desire and ability to compress multiple crucial roles into a single team slot, such as being a sturdy Ground immunity, Volt Switch blocker, and reliable form of hazard control. Doom Desire can force predictable and exploitable choices upon an opponent, and when used in tandem with wallbreakers like Dragapult and Rillaboom, it can often mean getting a guaranteed KO. Equilibra is also a stellar hazard remover with Rapid Spin due to its winning matchup against common Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T and Clefable. Flash Cannon is preferred for Equilibra's final moveslot as a means to beat Calm Mind Clefable, force out strong wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Kyurem, and immediately pressure Flying-types like Landorus-T and Tornadus-T. Alternatively, Pain Split lets it recover against common switch-ins such as Slowking and Blissey to better check strong wallbreakers like Dragapult and Tapu Lele in the long term. Aura Sphere is also an option for beating opposing Equilibra, forcing Corviknight and Skarmory to use Roost more often, and avoiding being trapped by Magnet Rise Magnezone as easily. Equilibra's EV spread is designed to outspeed Tyranitar, survive three Heat Waves from defensive Zapdos, and tank one Fire Fang from +2 Life Orb Garchomp, with the remaining EVs invested into Special Attack for stronger Doom Desires.</p> <p>Equilibra's plethora of valuable resistances and immunities combined with its ability to consistently remove entry hazards makes it very easy to find partners that appreciate its presence; Tomohawk in particular has exceptional defensive synergy as a physical wall that benefits from having Electric- and Fairy-types checked, while Equilibra enjoys Tomohawk's ability to deal with Fighting-types and strong physical wallbreakers like Rillaboom. Clefable is also relevant because it can soak up common Fighting-type coverage moves that bother Equilibra, while Equilibra in turn deals with the Poison- and Steel-types that threaten it such as Melmetal and Nidoking. Strong wallbreakers like Dragapult and Rillaboom as well as other offensive Pokemon like Zeraora appreciate Doom Desire's ability to invalidate many of their respective defensive answers. Pokemon weak to hazards such as Choice Specs Kyurem and Choice Band Weavile also enjoy Equilibra's consistency in spinning away Stealth Rock. Teams that rely on hazard stacking benefit from Equilibra's Rapid Spin not resetting their progress. Finally, it's advisable to have a reliable answer to many of the bulky Water-types that hold Equilibra back, especially Slowking; Rillaboom, Zapdos, and Jumbao are a few options that can keep the pressure up against many of these Pokemon.</p> "

In return, these teammates can pressure bulky Water-types for Astrolotl. Spinners like Tomohawk and Equilibra also pair nicely with Astrolotl, providing entry hazard removal that preserves Astrolotl's Spikes. Pokemon like Garchomp and Dragapult that are prone to being crippled with status appreciate Astrolotl's cleric support. Additionally, Hex Dragapult enjoys Astrolotl spreading status across the opposition.</p> "

First Impression also lets it act as a good revenge killer, especially against Pokemon susceptible to chip damage such as non-Heavy-Duty Boots Dragapult, Jumbao, Garchomp, and Rillaboom. Poison Jab is used to pressure opposing Fairy-types, and it can secure 2HKOs on Clefable and Tapu Fini while OHKOing Jumbao. Furthermore, Neutralizing Gas shuts down Magic Guard and Misty Surge, which would typically make Clefable and Tapu Fini immune to a potential poison.
