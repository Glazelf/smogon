Its ability in Mountaineer prevents Stealth Rock damage, so you can forgo Heavy-Duty Boots and dedicate your item slot to a damage boosting option like Choice Band. Earthquake is absolutely necessary for dealing with Pokemon like Toxapex, Melmetal, and Heatran that would otherwise stonewall Syclant. Ice Shard is valuable for picking off weakened Tornadus-T without risking a Speed tie and revenge killing faster threats like Dragapult, +1 Garchomp, and weakened Unburden-boosted Hawlucha, though one can opt to run Spikes instead to capitalize on the switches that Syclant forces. Triple Axel is an alternative option over Icicle Crash that offers a significant boost in damage; however, its inconsistency and its susceptibility to contact punishments like Rocky Helmet and Static mean that the tradeoff usually isn't worth it. Syclant can also choose to run Superpower over Earthquake to hit Equilibra and Ferrothorn super effectively, although Earthquake's coverage is still superior in most cases.</p> <p>Because Syclant is extremely frail and held back by many common bulky Water- and Steel-types, it relies immensely on its teammates to shore up its shortcomings as a wallbreaker. Strong physical attackers like Rillaboom and Kartana are good partners to apply pressure to some of Syclant's best switch-ins like Arghonaut and Equilibra. Having teammates like Krilowatt and Nidoking that can take advantage of Toxapex and other bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini is also appreciated. Krilowatt is especially useful because it forms a strong VoltTurn core with Syclant, bringing it in on Pokemon like Blissey and Astrolotl, which are then easily forced out. Combining Spikes support from teammates like Astrolotl and Ferrothorn with these VoltTurn cores helps Syclant break past its grounded checks like Toxapex and Melmetal. Other common bulky Steel-types like Heatran can also give Syclant trouble if it's locked into an Ice-type move, so having partners like Slowking and Equilibra that can reliably answer them is greatly appreciated. Finally, Syclant benefits from having reliable pivots on its team because it can struggle to enter the game safely; Slowking, Landorus-T, and Zeraora are all good options that can also apply pressure to common Steel-types that are difficult for Syclant to break past by itself. Syclant in turn heavily pressures Pokemon like Miasmaw that can pose a large threat to some of these pivots.</p> "

However, once Meteor Beam is used, you must try to get significant mileage out of Stratagem, as it's quite underwhelming if it's forced to switch out and lose its boost for good. Paleo Wave is the STAB move of choice after Meteor Beam is used. Fire Blast hits Steel-types like Equilibra and Ferrothorn that want to switch in on a predicted Rock-type move. Earth Power is a more accurate but weaker way to handle certain Steel-types as well as a way to hit Tyranitar, which can threaten to OHKO back. Energy Ball is an option to hit bulky Water-types such as Slowking and Gastrodon that otherwise can switch in quite freely.</p> <p>Stratagem's low defensive stats in tandem with its weakness to common types means it struggles to find the proper timing to switch in, and it must thus rely on its teammates to switch in safely. Offensive pivots such as Krilowatt and Rillaboom can get Stratagem in on advantageous matchups so it can pave the way for them to clean up later. Spikes setters like Astrolotl and Ferrothorn dissuade the opponent from switching around Stratagem and also help it break down walls more easily. Pajantom can trap walls such as both forms of Slowking and Equilibra with Spirit Shackle, allowing Stratagem to switch in rather safely on a guaranteed advantageous matchup. Finally, Rillaboom and Ferrothorn can not only deal with bulky Water-types like Slowking, Tapu Fini, and Arghonaut that would be troublesome for Stratagem to break, but also provide Knock Off utility to remove Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots from the opponent's Pokemon, both of which Stratagem greatly appreciates.</p> "

Furthermore, Taunt Tapu Koko can also shut down and beat some of the major Defoggers in the metagame like Corviknight and Tornadus-T, while Explosion from Regieleki can prevent the foe from removing entry hazards. Astrolotl's ability to weaken Cawmodore's checks with Spikes is also very valuable, as it makes Cawmodore's role as a cleaner much easier. Setup sweepers like Garchomp, Hawlucha, and Rillaboom are all solid teammates for Cawmodore on hyper offense teams, as they can punch holes in opposing walls and make it easier for it to clean late-game and vice versa.</p> "

While at first glance Volkraken's monstrous 135 Special Attack stat and respectable 100/80/100 bulk seem quite good, it is easily revenge killed, often chipped by entry hazards and pivots, and walled by the best Pokemon in the tier: Slowking. That being said, given the right team support, Volkraken can turn into a relatively strong special breaker with the somewhat unique ability to pressure all three of Tomohawk, Equilibra, and Heatran at once. Furthermore, Volkraken's access to Analytic can make switching into it quite terrifying. Fire Blast and Hydro Pump is a near-unique STAB combination in the CAP metagame that can prove to be difficult for some teams to deal with, picking up 2HKOs on the common Tomohawk + Equilibra core. Scorching Sands is by far the best option for the third slot, as it 2HKOes Toxapex and is a roll to OHKO Krilowatt. U-turn is used over Flip Turn to avoid losing momentum against Storm Drain Gastrodon. U-turn additionally chunks Slowking more than Flip Turn. Another option for Volkraken is to run Choice Scarf, which can give it an easier time fitting on teams, though the drop in power is quite noticeable.</p> <p>Volkraken appreciates anything that can help it get in against a foe that is forced to switch out so as to activate Analytic. Accordingly, it enjoys pivots like Kerfluffle, Tapu Koko, and Rillaboom, which appreciate Volkraken's raw breaking power and ability to pivot itself. Rillaboom deserves special mention for consistently beating Volkraken's two biggest counters: Slowking and Gastrodon. Volkraken's ability to wallbreak is further amplified under rain, with nothing in the metagame other than Slowking being able to tank two Hydro Pumps in rain. Therefore, Pelipper and Barraskewda make excellent teammates for Volkraken. Entry hazard removal is key for Volkraken to operate well as it foregoes Heavy-Duty Boots for the power of Choice Specs, so Pokemon such as Equilibra and pivot Tornadus-T are important. Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Zeraora, and Melmetal that need the Tomohawk + Equilibra core to be pressured appreciate Volkraken's ability to dish out heavy damage to teams using this defensive backbone. Miasmaw, particularly the Taunt set, deserves a special mention as a teammate for its unique ability to deny Slowking and Toxapex Regenerator recovery. Finally, setup sweepers like Garchomp and Kartana that require chip damage on Pokemon such as Toxapex and Equilibra to win appreciate Volkraken's ability to force heavy damage on the opponent's team.</p> "

While generally less viable, other bulky Poison-types such as Amoonguss and Mollux are good checks as well.</p> <p><strong>Other Pokemon with Regenerator: Slowking in particular is a great switch-in, because it does not fear any of Kerfluffle's moves and gets a valuable opportunity to use Future Sight or Teleport. Tornadus-T can switch into Kerfluffle and immediately force it out; however, it still takes heavy damage from Moonblast, so it can't switch in unless it's kept healthy. Astrolotl can switch in and scout Choice Specs Kerfluffle and then pivot to an appropriate answer, but it must be at high health to do so.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash: Aegislash is immune to Kerfluffle's strongest STAB move in Focus Blast and can switch into Moonblasts with relative ease as well, though it's still prone to getting worn down due to its lack of reliable recovery options and susceptibility to entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Moltres</strong>: Moltres has little to fear from Kerfluffle's Moonblast, and while Focus Blast and Sludge Bomb can deal respectable damage, Moltres still remains a solid switch-in due to its bulk and access to reliable recovery. Be wary of getting poisoned by Sludge Bomb, though, as there's a small chance Kerfluffle can 2HKO a poisoned Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Pokemon that are faster and capable of KOing Kerfluffle such as Choice Scarf Jumbao, Choice Scarf Kartana, and Tornadus-T are all potent offensive checks. Even Pokemon like Dragapult and Zeraora can threaten to KO Kerfluffle with prior chip damage.

        "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Kerfluffle's strong STAB combination of Fairy and Fighting along with its great offensive stats and access to Parting Shot makes it a compelling option among the tier's many wallbreakers and offensive pivots. Moonblast is Kerfluffle's most reliable and spammable STAB move, and when paired with Focus Blast and Aura Sphere, Kerfluffle can easily bypass opposing bulky Steel-types like Equilibra and Heatran and pose a huge threat to teams that rely on these Pokemon to check Fairy-types. Despite its low-Base Power, Aura Sphere is often convenient in situations where you don't want to risk missing a Focus Blast, though Sludge Bomb can still be useful against certain Fairy-types like Clefable, Jumbao, and Tapu Fini. Parting Shot is great at grabbing momentum and safely bringing in teammates, and it also lowers the power of Future Sight from an incoming Slowking or Galarian Slowking. Heavy-Duty Boots can be run over Choice Specs if you want to avoid entry hazard damage and being Choice locked into moves, though it leaves you unable to muscle past certain walls like Clefable and Tapu Fini. Sets with Heavy-Duty Boots can also run Close Combat over Focus Blast along with a Hasty nature, as this allows you to consistently 2HKO Blissey and Equilibra even with no Attack investment while additionally freeing up your third moveslot to run Taunt or Sludge Bomb.</p> <p>Despite Kerfluffle's strengths, it can ultimately struggle to break past many common Poison-types, and it finds itself easily revenge killed due its relative lack of OHKO power and being Choice locked into moves. Ground-types like Landorus-T, Equilibra, and Garchomp are generally effective partners for these reasons, as they can threaten many of the Pokemon that wall Kerfluffle's STABs. Equilibra has the added benefit of removing hazards to keep Kerfluffle healthy while setting Doom Desire to deny Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Moltres, and Clefable from safely switching into Kerfluffle's Fighting-type moves. Slowking and Slowbro offer similar support with Future Sight + Teleport, a combination that has truly incredible synergy with Kerfluffle and is the only consistent way it can break past Toxapex. Another great Future Sight setter is Galarian Slowking, though it unfortunately can't use Teleport to always safely bring Kerfluffle in. Spikes support from teammates like Astrolotl and Ferrothorn is great for Kerfluffle, as it can struggle to OHKO opposing Pokemon but is still effective in repeatedly forcing switches; Spikes additionally help Kerfluffle break past its checks in the long run by forcing damage on Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Toxapex, which would otherwise be able to recover their HP through Regenerator. Slower wallbreakers that appreciate being brought in for free with Parting Shot also tend to have great synergy with Kerfluffle. Miasmaw stands out among them as being particularly effective, as it loves the chance to safely switch into Toxapex, Slowking, and Galarian Slowking to deny them their Regenerator healing and make them much easier for Kerfluffle to eventually break through.</p> "

Doom Desire can force predictable and exploitable choices upon an opponent, and when used in tandem with wallbreakers like Dragapult and Rillaboom, it can often mean getting a guaranteed KO. Equilibra is also a stellar hazard remover with Rapid Spin due to its winning matchup against common Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T and Clefable. Flash Cannon is preferred for Equilibra's final moveslot as a means to beat Calm Mind Clefable, force out strong wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Kyurem, and immediately pressure Flying-types like Landorus-T and Tornadus-T. Alternatively, Pain Split lets it recover against common switch-ins such as Slowking and Blissey to better check strong wallbreakers like Dragapult and Tapu Lele in the long term. Aura Sphere is also an option for beating opposing Equilibra, forcing Corviknight and Skarmory to use Roost more often, and avoiding being trapped by Magnet Rise Magnezone as easily. Equilibra's EV spread is designed to outspeed Tyranitar, survive three Heat Waves from defensive Zapdos, and tank one Fire Fang from +2 Life Orb Garchomp, with the remaining EVs invested into Special Attack for stronger Doom Desires.</p> <p>Equilibra's plethora of valuable resistances and immunities combined with its ability to consistently remove entry hazards makes it very easy to find partners that appreciate its presence; Tomohawk in particular has exceptional defensive synergy as a physical wall that benefits from having Electric- and Fairy-types checked, while Equilibra enjoys Tomohawk's ability to deal with Fighting-types and strong physical wallbreakers like Rillaboom. Clefable is also relevant because it can soak up common Fighting-type coverage moves that bother Equilibra, while Equilibra in turn deals with the Poison- and Steel-types that threaten it such as Melmetal and Nidoking. Strong wallbreakers like Dragapult and Rillaboom as well as other offensive Pokemon like Zeraora appreciate Doom Desire's ability to invalidate many of their respective defensive answers. Pokemon weak to hazards such as Choice Specs Kyurem and Choice Band Weavile also enjoy Equilibra's consistency in spinning away Stealth Rock.
