Although its average Speed and mediocre Special Attack makes Frosmoth seem like a better option in comparison, Butterfree does have a few tricks up its sleeve. Compound Eyes makes Sleep Powder and Hurricane far more threatening with very low chances of missing. Substitute takes advantage of Sleep Powder to provide Butterfree with an extra layer of protection, allowing it to safely use Quiver Dance multiple times. While its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock makes Heavy-Duty Boots seem better, Leftovers makes Butterfree much more consistent if your team has reliable entry hazard removal and prevention.</p> <p>Butterfree is most effective late-game when a lot of the opposing team is weakened, and it can come in and set up with Quiver Dance to win. However, it is also tremendously threatening in the early-game, especially with Leftovers before Stealth Rock is up. It can set up on and beat common leads such as Rhydon and Galarian Stunfisk and open the way for teammates such as Rotom and Frosmoth. Using Butterfree early-game lets it cripple walls with Sleep Powder. Slow wallbreakers like Flapple, Arctovish, and Alcremie appreciate Butterfree's Sleep Powder, allowing them to safely switch in. In return, Butterfree appreciates their damage making it much easier to KO bulky Pokemon such as Clefairy, Wishiwashi, and Miltank. Butterfree is very frail, and it struggles with Choice Scarf users such as Rotom, Silvally, and Sawk without a Substitute set up. It appreciates bulky teammates like Tangela, Gurdurr, and Uxie, which can come in on opposing attacks, primarily priority attacks that Butterfree is very weak to. When using Leftovers, entry hazard removers like Altaria, Coalossal, and Articuno are needed in order to make sure Butterfree can get onto the field. Entry hazards set by Pokemon like Rhydon, Qwilfish, and Miltank wear down opposing Pokemon for Butterfree, making it easier to sweep.</p> "

Such sets can run Destiny Bond to get an unexpected KO, but Qwilfish usually doesn't have the room for it and is required to run an inferior max Speed spread. Although weaker than Liquidation, Waterfall is an option on both sets for its flinch chance and synergy with Thunder Wave. Poison Jab is also an alternative to the STAB moves on defensive sets for its ability to damage Water-resistant attackers like Exeggutor, Basculin, and Shiftry and spread poison. However, Thunder Wave and Scald already spread status and cripple those Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Uxie: Thanks to Levitate, Uxie isn't affected by Qwilfish's entry hazards and can heavily damage it with Psychic, while Qwilfish hardly hurts Uxie with its moves.

Qwilfish also takes heavy damage from common Ground-type coverage from wallbreakers like Rapidash and Sawk; the latter is noteworthy due to Inner Focus ignoring Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Wallbreakers: Even with Intimidate, Qwilfish's bulk isn't amazing and, without any reliable recovery moves, it is quickly put in range of powerful wallbreakers like Kangaskhan, Choice Band Cinccino, and Swords Dance Silvally formes.</p> ",

Tangela is also able to tank hits from Fighting-types such as Sawk and Poliwrath, while Thwackey is able to provide passive recovery and reduce damage from Earthquake. Knock Off absorbers such as Uxie and Alolan Persian can preserve Coalossal's Heavy-Duty Boots, letting it consistently pivot in to remove entry hazards; Uxie can also threaten the aforementioned Fighting-types.</p> "

Sucker Punch OHKOes faster offensive threats such as Choice Scarf Rotom as well as picking off Accelgor and Cinccino after some chip damage. Alternatively, Grassy Glide can be used on Grassy Terrain teams, threatening all faster Pokemon that do not resist Grass. Hustle does allow Flapple to 2HKO just about any Pokemon in the metagame, but its accuracy drop, combined with Flapple relying on a drawback-laden Draco Meteor or Outrage to dispatch Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Altaria, makes Flapple somewhat unreliable.</p> <p>Flapple's poor bulk and defensive typing give it few direct switch-in opportunities, so it pairs well with bulky pivots that are able to bring it in safely such as Uxie, Wishiwashi, and Rotom-S.

Special attackers such as Cramorant and Rotom appreciate Flapple's ability to pressure special walls like Wishiwashi and Stunfisk. In return, Cramorant provides entry hazard removal, while Rotom forms an effective VoltTurn core with Flapple. Ninetales and Rapidash easily handle Ice- and Steel-types like Articuno, Klinklang, and Alolan Sandslash that Flapple struggles with, while Flapple can break down their checks such as Altaria and Wishiwashi. Late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Sawk and Silvally formes appreciate Flapple's ability to break walls such as Cofagrigus and Pyukumuku, respectively.
