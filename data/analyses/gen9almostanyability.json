Extreme Speed is useful priority that picks off weakened targets, Stealth Rock allows Hisuian Arcanine to act as an offensive entry hazard setter that pressures Corviknight and Iron Treads, and Flame Charge boosts its Speed to thwart potential revenge killers. As Hisuian Arcanine places a lot of pressure on physical walls, other physical cleaners like Meowscarada and Chien-Pao can be partnered with Hisuian Arcanine to clean up after it has broken those walls while providing speed control. Since Hisuian Arcanine is checked by Garchomp and bulky Water-types like Quaquaval, Refrigerate Regieleki makes a good partner for it by forcing these Pokemon out, pivoting Hisuian Arcanine in, and helping to deal with faster threats through its raw Speed. Hisuian Arcanine's middling Speed makes slow pivots like Corviknight good partners due to their ability to bring it in safely; alternatively, Corviknight's dual screens set allows Arcanine to take a hit and strike back.</p>"

Draco Meteor is the STAB move of choice, surprising offensive Great Tusk with a 2HKO, while Fire Blast 2HKOes Corviknight. Download is a niche option over Regenerator, letting it secure a 2HKO on Mandibuzz and offensive Manaphy with Draco Meteor while also freeing your Regenerator slot for a teammate like Kommo-o or Great Tusk, but it comes at the cost of cutting into Garchomp's longevity. Life Orb notably guarantees the 2HKO on specially defensive Garchomp with Draco Meteor. Offensive threats like Manaphy, Azelf, and Iron Moth appreciate Garchomp for its entry hazards and ability to threaten common defensive foes, chipping them down to be picked off later in the game. Defensive pivots such as Corviknight, Zapdos, and RegenVest Manaphy appreciate Garchomp outspeeding and threatening powerful offensive threats such as Great Tusk, Ceruledge, and Sandy Shocks, while Garchomp appreciates these defensive partners handling the faster attackers like Weavile, Azelf, and Chien-Pao that force Garchomp out. Garchomp is worn down very easily by hazards and appreciates Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk and Quaquaval and Wish support from Scream Tail, allowing it to come in repeatedly over the course of the game while greatly improving its longevity, especially if running Download. Garchomp also struggles to break through common defensive foes like Scream Tail and Earth Eater Empoleon, so it appreciates teammates such as Gengar and Zamazenta-C, which can break down these walls.</p>"

Swords Dance allows Garchomp to threaten hazard removers like Quaquaval and act as a potential wincon late-game, while Dragon Tail forces switches, racking up entry hazard chip damage and preventing setup, and Liquidation hits both Landorus formes and Levitate Iron Treads and chips Corviknight. Toxic Debris punishes resisted physical hits and U-turn from pivots like Corviknight and RegenVest Manaphy and pressures the opposing team while leveraging Garchomp's Volt Switch immunity to threaten fast-paced teams with strong VoltTurn cores. Alternatively, Regenerator allows it to switch in more times throughout a game to find opportunities to set up entry hazards or Swords Dance, while Well-Baked Body punishes Fire-types like Cinderace and Ceruledge for clicking their strong STAB moves and increases its walling capabilities. Garchomp's inability to check threats like Chien-Pao, Weavile, and Galarian Zapdos facilitates another physical wall like Corviknight or Zapdos, which can switch into them and pivot out. Garchomp's inability to check special threats like Azelf, Gengar, and Walking Wake makes special walls like RegenVest Manaphy and Goodra great partners if Garchomp is not using Regenerator; if Garchomp is using Regenerator, Blissey and Empoleon are alternative options as special walls.</p>"

Volcarona is completely walled by Well-Baked Body Steel-types such as Corviknight and Kingambit; thus, partners such as Sandy Shocks help to eliminate them in the early-game. While Giga Drain can hurt Garganacl, Volcarona's massive weakness to Rock means it doesn't want to stay into Garganacl at all; thus, teammates such as Magic Guard Quaquaval are particularly helpful.

Due to its average Special Defense, Corviknight appreciates specially defensive teammates like Hisuian Goodra, Roaring Moon, and Manaphy that can form a solid defensive core with it. Corviknight is primarily a utility Pokemon, so it pairs well with offensive teammates like Azelf and Barraskewda, which in return make use of Corviknight's ability to safely pivot them in.

These moves improve Enamorus-T's already good natural bulk and let it shrug off attacks from revenge killers that can handle Draining Kiss like Cinderace and Ceruledge. Earth Power pairs well with Draining Kiss, since it hits Fire-, Poison-, and Steel-types that resist Draining Kiss, such as Ceruledge, Gengar, and Heatran. Life Orb boosts Enamorus-T's damage output to compensate for the low base power of Draining Kiss. Enamorus-T can switch into Ground-, Dragon-, and Fighting-types like Great Tusk and Kommo-o to set up. However, Steel-types that are immune to Earth Power, such as Earth Eater Gholdengo and Empoleon, completely wall Enamorus-T, so Fire-type Pokemon that prey on these Steel-types, such as Heatran and Iron Moth, make great partners. In exchange, Enamorus-T can wall Ground-type moves from Great Tusk and Garchomp that threaten the aforementioned Fire-types. If Enamorus-T has not set up, it can be vulnerable to super effective attacks from Pokemon that take Draining Kiss well, like Zapdos and Ogerpon-C. However, entry hazards can wear down many of these Pokemon into KO range of Draining Kiss. Enamorus-T's weakness to Stealth Rock limits its ability to set up, so hazard control from the likes of Corviknight and Great Tusk alleviate this. Finally, Psychic Surge Azelf completely prevents Enamorus-T from using Draining Kiss except on non-grounded foes, which increases the pool of Pokemon that can revenge kill it. Therefore, Enamorus-T likes to have a defensive teammates that can switch into Azelf and the foes that Azelf enables.</p>"

Bulk Up is used to boost Great Tusk's offensive and defensive presence, while Knock Off cripples switch-ins like Corviknight and Earth Eater Skeledirge. Regenerator provides reliable recovery and allows Great Tusk to switch back in to take hits from multiple threats, but Fluffy can be used to reduce damage taken from contact move users like Roaring Moon and physical Kommo-o. Alternatively, Toxic Debris can punish users of physical utility moves such as Knock Off and U-turn, forcing entry hazard removers like Corviknight in. Leftovers can be used for small but valuable recovery, while Rocky Helmet can be used to punish contact attackers. Frailer Pokemon that are weak to entry hazards such as Azelf and Weavile appreciate Great Tusk's ability to reliably remove hazards. Great Tusk's abysmal special bulk makes it susceptible to special attackers like Manaphy and Azelf. Therefore, Pokemon like Hisuian Goodra and RegenVest Manaphy can form a defensive core with Great Tusk, being able to switch into those wallbreakers and force them out with utility like Dragon Tail and Knock Off, respectively.</p>"

Ice Spinner OHKOes Primordial Sea Zapdos after a Bulk Up, OHKOes Dragonite and 2HKOes Landorus-Therian, while Knock Off threatens Skeledirge and Ceruledge if not running Headlong Rush and cripples defensive Pokemon like Corviknight, Quaquaval, and Earth Eater Gholdengo looking to switch in. Close Combat threatens Earth Eater Kingambit and Empoleon, as well as Roaring Moon, while Headlong Rush threatens Iron Moth, Skeledirge and Ceruledge. Toxic Debris provides a layer of danger, putting offensive teams on a timer and forcing Poison-type Pokemon to switch in, while Fluffy helps Great Tusk set up Bulk Up more easily with its heightened physical bulk, making it a powerful tank. Great Tusk is a potent wallbreaker and entry hazard remover, so Pokemon that are vulnerable to entry hazards like Ogerpon-H and Weavile benefit from its presence. In return, they threaten common defensive Pokemon that wall Great Tusk, such as Manaphy and Corviknight. Great Tusk has terrible special bulk and appreciates pivoting, so special walls like RegenVest Roaring Moon and the aforementioned Manaphy make for great teammates. Despite Great Tusk's high Attack stat, it still requires entry hazard chip damage to pick up KOes, Stealth Rock to OHKO itemless Zapdos at +1 and Stealth Rock and three layers of Spikes to OHKO Toxapex. Therefore, teammates like Sandy Shocks and Garchomp, which can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes, are appreciated.</p>"

Stone Edge allows Roaring Moon to threaten the plethora of Flying- and Fire-types that the tier has, such as Thundurus, Iron Moth, and Zapdos, while Iron Head allows it to chip Fairy-types like Scream Tail and Diancie that otherwise can switch in freely. 192 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature ensure that Roaring Moon outspeeds Thundurus and Gengar. Roaring Moon appreciates physically defensive walls like Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Quaquaval that can remove entry hazards which limit Roaring Moon's walling capabilities, while it checks the special Electric- and Fire-types that threaten them like Hisuian Electrode and Iron Moth in return. Roaring Moon's presence is appreciated by pivots and wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Sword of Ruin Ceruledge due to its ability to switch into revenge killing attempts from the likes of Hisuian Electrode, Sandy Shocks, and Azelf. Roaring Moon deathly fears Dragon- and Fairy-types like Hydreigon, Walking Wake, and Enamorus-T, making Earth Eater Empoleon a notable partner with its ability to pivot into these Pokemon.</p>"

      "Choice Item": {
        "description": "<p>With high Attack and Speed and a powerful Knock Off, Roaring Moon is a great offensive pivot and wallbreaker, capable of threatening KOs while also generating momentum with U-turn. Knock Off OHKOes other offensive pivots such as Azelf, Barraskewda, and Hisuian Electrode, while also crippling defensive switch-ins like Corviknight and Great Tusk. Earthquake threatens Steel-types like Heatran and Empoleon, Iron Head hits Fairy-types like Scream Tail and Diancie, and Stone Edge hits Flying-types like Zapdos and Mandibuzz. Choice Scarf allows Roaring Moon to safely outspeed previously mentioned pivots, increasing its effectiveness as speed control, while Choice Band turns Roaring Moon into more of a wallbreaker, notably 2HKOing Scream Tail with Iron Head and OHKOing Fluffy Zapdos with Stone Edge. Roaring Moon struggles greatly against defensive Great Tusk, Quaquaval, and Kommo-o, which makes specially offensive partners like Azelf and Walking Wake great, as they allow Roaring Moon to potentially sweep late-game after its checks have been heavily chipped down. Other offensive pivots like Barraskewda and Sandy Shocks also like Roaring Moon, as they can form VoltTurn cores and pressure common switch-ins like Corviknight, Great Tusk, and defensive Zapdos. While fast, Roaring Moon is still weak to priority moves from the likes of Weavile, Slither Wing, and Dragonite, which makes defensive partners such as Corviknight and Scream Tail appreciated as well as Azelf thanks to Psychic Surge negating priority. Roaring Moon racks up chip damage from entry hazards easily with U-turn increasing how often it switches in, meaning that Teammates with hazard removal like Corviknight and Great Tusk are also appreciated. Hazard setters like Garchomp and Kommo-o are also helpful, as they help wear down its checks like Corviknight, allowing VoltTurn cores to be more effective.</p>"

  "Walking Wake": {
    "sets": {
      "Choice Item": {
        "description": "<p>Walking Wake's excellent Special Attack, good Speed, and nearly unresisted STAB combination allow it to stand out as either a threatening wallbreaker or powerful speed control depending on its choice of item. Knock Off cripples switch-ins such as Empoleon and RegenVest Manaphy, Scald provides a more reliable STAB option on non-Primordial Sea sets while also threatening a burn on potential switch-ins, while Dragon Pulse provides a more reliable Dragon-type STAB move. Flip Turn is used in order to gain momentum for Walking Wake's teammates while also pivoting out of unfavorable matchups such as against Empoleon and Blissey. Primordial Sea allows Walking Wake to run Weather Ball instead of Hydro Pump, trading power for accuracy while also giving Walking Wake an easier time switching into Fire-types thanks to the Fire-type immunity. Dragon's Maw significantly boosts the power of Walking Wake's Dragon-type attacks, notably allowing it to OHKO RegenVest Manaphy after a Knock Off and one layer of entry hazards, at the cost of not increasing the power of its Water-type attacks and providing no additional defensive benefit. A Choice Specs can be used in order to increase Walking Wake's effectiveness as a wallbreaker, notably allowing non-Primordial Sea sets to 2HKO RegenVest Manaphy and Hisuian Goodra with Draco Meteor after a Knock Off, while a Choice Scarf can be used to outspeed and threaten an OHKO against would-be offensive checks, such as Weavile, Chien-Pao, and Roaring Moon. Walking Wake appreciates offensive teammates such as Galarian Zapdos, Meowscarada, and Ogerpon-C, which can pressure switch-ins like Empoleon, RegenVest Manaphy, and Desolate Land Heatran. Fast teammates such as Barraskewda and Choice Scarf Azelf also pair well with Walking Wake, as they appreciate the holes it breaks in the opponent's team while forming a VoltTurn core with the momentum they generate, potentially allowing them to sweep late-game. These teammates can also force out Walking Wake's offensive checks, such as Weavile, Chien-Pao, and Roaring Moon, which can outspeed it and threaten it with an OHKO.</p>"

Sacred Sword allows Iron Leaves to hit Grass- and Psychic-resistant foes like Kingambit and Hydreigon, while Wild Charge threatens Flying-types like Talonflame and Corviknight. Iron Leaves struggles with being prediction-reliant and having low physical bulk, especially with its 4x weakness to the extremely prevalent U-turn, which makes wrong predictions very punishing. Therefore, having defensive teammates like Ting-Lu and Corviknight that can repeatedly pivot it in safely are necessary. Due to its lack of recovery and need for repeated switching, Iron Leaves appreciates entry hazard removers like Iron Treads to keep it from getting worn down. Hadron Engine users like Sandy Shocks are also great teammates that power up both Psyblade and Wild Charge with Electric Terrain.</p>"}

Ivy Cudgel not only boasts obscene power, but also is non-contact and has a high critical hit chance, bypassing Fluffy and Rocky Helmet and often bypassing Intimidate with critical hits. Power Whip is the preferred secondary STAB move to OHKO Manaphy, while Horn Leech provides recovery. Knock Off hits Desolate Land Ceruledge, Iron Moth, and Heatran, while Play Rough dispatches of Kommo-o, Trailblaze allows Ogerpon-W to potentially sweep offensive teams, and Spikes reliably wears down switch-ins like Hisuian Goodra, (comma) which can get 2HKOed after Spikes. Primordial Sea is the preferred ability to make Ivy Cudgel even stronger and provide a useful Fire immunity, while Sword of Ruin also boosts Ogerpon-W's other coverage, achieving important benchmarks like OHKOing Kommo-o. Ogerpon-W appreciates fast cleaners that can take advantage of the holes it creates in opposing teams, especially fast special pivots like Azelf and Hisuian Electrode that can get it in on special walls and overwhelm the physical walls like Kommo-o that it struggles with. Ogerpon-W has mediocre bulk, so it appreciates defensive teammates like Meloetta, defensive Zapdos, and Intimidate Corviknight to take hits and get it in safely or dual screens support from Prankster Corviknight to let it set up safely.</p>"

Ogerpon-H has a number of options for its last moveslot, such as Play Rough to hit Kommo-o and Roaring Moon, OHKOing both after a Swords Dance, and Knock Off to cripple foes, especially switch-ins like Primordial Sea Zapdos, which gets 2HKOed after Stealth Rock, as well as 2HKOing Well-Baked Body Gholdengo with Sword of Ruin. Desolate Land provides the most power to Ivy Cudgel and lets Ogerpon-H offensively check Water-types like Manaphy and Barraskewda, while Sword of Ruin allows Play Rough to OHKO Kommo-o and 2HKO Garchomp. Due to its average defenses and lack of recovery if not running Horn Leech, Ogerpon-H benefits both from entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and Quaquaval and slow pivots like Corviknight and Empoleon that can get it on the field safely. Ogerpon-H also appreciates hazard setters like Garchomp and Heatran, which can chip down walls like Scream Tail for it to more easily KO.</p>"
