Extreme Speed is useful priority that picks off weakened targets, Stealth Rock allows Hisuian Arcanine to act as an offensive entry hazard setter that pressures Corviknight and Iron Treads, and Flame Charge boosts its Speed to thwart potential revenge killers. As Hisuian Arcanine places a lot of pressure on physical walls, other physical cleaners like Meowscarada and Chien-Pao can be partnered with Hisuian Arcanine to clean up after it has broken those walls while providing speed control. Since Hisuian Arcanine is checked by Garchomp and bulky Water-types like Quaquaval, Refrigerate Regieleki makes a good partner for it by forcing these Pokemon out, pivoting Hisuian Arcanine in, and helping to deal with faster threats through its raw Speed. Hisuian Arcanine's middling Speed makes slow pivots like Corviknight good partners due to their ability to bring it in safely; alternatively, Corviknight's dual screens set allows Arcanine to take a hit and strike back.</p>"

Trick can be used to cripple more defensive switch-ins such as Blissey and RegenVest users, while Sludge Bomb threatens an OHKO on Primordial Sea Zapdos and Ogerpon-C while also potentially crippling switch-ins with poison.

Gengar's ability to absorb Toxic Spikes is greatly appreciated by offensive teams especially, as they can otherwise be crippled by them. Gengar is OHKOed by most Pokemon faster than it, such as Azelf, Barraskewda, and Roaring Moon, and takes takes heavy damage from most priority moves, so defensive teammates such as Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Empoleon are appreciated, with Corviknight and Great Tusk being able to remove the entry hazards that Gengar is prone to being chipped down by.

Skill Swap, which has the added benefit of going through Substitute, renders Gengar immune to most attacks; this either forces the foe to switch no matter how much setup it has accrued, giving Gengar a free turn, or if Gengar successfully landed Mean Look first, spells its foe's doom. Toxic Spikes forces progress even in situations where it is unable to reliably trap the opponent's special switch-in, such as against Roaring Moon, and forces Defoggers like Corviknight into a catch-22: stay in to remove Toxic Spikes and risk getting trapped, or switch out and accept that entry hazards stay up. Taunt and Trick are alternatives that allow Gengar to trap and remove targets it otherwise could not like Meloetta, Mandibuzz, and Blissey but relegate it to a trap-or-bust option. Gengar pairs exceptionally well with physical pivots that get it in on slow physical walls it can scare out; if the opponent then switches to their special wall, they risk losing it to Mean Look + Skill Swap. Fast special cleaners like Azelf appreciate both Toxic Spikes and opposing special walls being trapped and removed; Azelf also appreciates Gengar's ability to lure and trap most Dark-types.

Meowscarada's ability to force out special walls like Hisuian Goodra, RegenVest Manaphy, and Roaring Moon is greatly appreciated by special wallbreakers and pivots like Walking Wake, Iron Moth, and Choice Specs Azelf, which in return force out the physical walls that wall Meowscarada like Corviknight and defensive Zapdos.

Skeledirge pairs well with hazard setters such as Garchomp and Iron Treads, as it allows them to keep their hazards on the field, and they can in turn handle opposing Well-Baked Body Pokemon. Due to its middling Special Defense, Skeledirge appreciates specially defensive teammates like Blissey and Hisuian Goodra. Additionally, a teammate that covers the type that Skeledirge chooses not to be immune to, such as Quaquaval for Earth Eater variants and Corviknight for Desolate Land variants, helps form a strong defensive core. Dark-types like Meowscarada and Chien-Pao also OHKO Skeledirge with a bit of chip damage, so Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos and Slither Wing that can threaten them are appreciated.</p>"

Recover gives Gholdengo the ability to heal off damage taken while setting up, as well as simply giving it the longevity to attack the opponent's team throughout the battle. Alternatively, Focus Blast hits Steel-types like Heatran and Hisuian Goodra, while Thunder Wave slows down faster attackers like Iron Moth and Roaring Moon that try to threaten Gholdengo while powering up Hex to break down bulkier Pokemon like Manaphy. Gholdengo's ability to beat down balanced cores with the sheer strength of Steel Beam benefits faster cleaners like Barraskewda, Chien-Pao, and Choice Scarf Azelf and Walking Wake. If Gholdengo runs Thunder Wave, it can also support other offensive Pokemon that appreciate faster attackers getting slowed down, such as Great Tusk, Ceruledge, and Dragonite. However, Gholdengo is vulnerable to faster Dark-types like Chien-Pao, so Pokemon that can check them like Corviknight and Quaquaval are appreciated. Corviknight can even safely bring in Gholdengo with its U-turn. Additionally, if Gholdengo is not using Thunder Wave and Hex, RegenVest users like Manaphy and Meloetta completely wall it, so Pokemon that beat them with super effective STAB moves or physical attacks like Desolate Land Ogerpon-H and Roaring Moon are appreciated.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With Nasty Plot, a fantastic offensive and defensive typing, and solid coverage, Gholdengo is a terrifying wallbreaker that threatens to tear apart teams after a single free turn. Hex can be used over Shadow Ball with Thunder Wave or Toxic Spikes support, with Life Orb sets 2HKOing badly poisoned RegenVest Manaphy while also threatening Bulletproof Gholdengo. Recover gives Gholdengo significant longevity and multiple opportunities to use Nasty Plot, while Substitute gives it a free turn to set up Nasty Plot or Thunder Wave against foes like Corviknight and Kommo-o and dodges phazing attempts from Dragon Tail users like Hisuian Goodra and Roaring Moon. Focus Blast hits Roaring Moon, Kingambit, and Hisuian Goodra, while Thunder Wave can boost the power of Hex and spread useful paralysis against threats like Manaphy, Roaring Moon, and Ogerpon-C. Leftovers and Colbur Berry both boost its longevity, with the latter letting Gholdengo survive Knock Off from Roaring Moon or +2 Ogerpon-C, while Life Orb boosts Gholdengo's power significantly, granting it feats such as guaranteeing a 2HKO on specially defensive Garchomp with Make It Rain. If running Focus Blast, Beads of Ruin is an option over Adaptability, boosting Focus Blast's power at the cost of revealing Gholdengo's ability and slightly decreasing the power of its STAB moves. Gholdengo can struggle to break through common special walls like Blissey, Bulletproof Empoleon, and RegenVest users like Hisuian Goodra and Meloetta, so it appreciates powerful offensive teammates like Roaring Moon, Ogerpon-C, and Galarian Zapdos that can handle these walls while Gholdengo picks off physical walls like Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Kommo-o. Gholdengo appreciates defensive pivots like Corviknight, Manaphy, and Empoleon that can take a hit and bring Gholdengo in against foes it forces out such as Kommo-o, Pixilate Scream Tail, and Galarian Zapdos.</p>"

Ting-Lu's best entry hazard depends on its team, as it can form a strong hazard-stacking core with Stealth Rock and/or Spikes setters like Garganacl and Glimmora. Ruination spreads consistent damage, especially against Ground-immune foes like Earth Eater Kingambit, and forces defensive Pokemon like Corviknight, Hippowdon, and Blissey to waste their recovery PP. Whirlwind forces entry hazard damage onto foes and ensures Ting-Lu isn't setup fodder for threats like Talonflame and Quaquaval. The Speed IVs let it underspeed Corviknight to punish its Roost with Earthquake.

Some special attackers like Scream Tail can prove dangerous, so pairing Ting-Lu with Corviknight and Desolate Land Iron Moth are good options. Ting-Lu can switch into weaker physical attackers like Roaring Moon, but it should be used as help for the main physical wall on the team.

Choice Specs provides maximum wallbreaking power, notably allowing it to OHKO physically defensive Ting-Lu with Desolate Land + Overheat, whereas Choice Scarf gives it the Speed to clean late-game and chase out faster threats like Cinderace and Chien-Pao. Desolate Land provides the most damage amplification and comes with an immunity to Water, whereas No Guard enables Chi-Yu to liberally spread burns with Inferno. Psychic is useful coverage to hit Clodsire and Iron Moth super effectively; alternatively, Will-O-Wisp allows Desolate Land sets to reliably spread burn, however Chi-Yu's poor bulk means it can be dangerous to use. Chi-Yu's best fit is on balance and offense teams that appreciate its high damage output, as well as its good matchups against common special walls like RegenVest Iron Treads.

Chi-Yu generally prefers to run Heavy-Duty Boots to avoid entry hazard damage, but Life Orb can be run on Sheer Force sets for extra power. Chi-Yu also has several Fire-type STAB moves to choose from: Fire Blast is the most powerful, Flamethrower is the most consistent option, and Inferno is used on No Guard sets to punish switch-ins like Garganacl and Ting-Lu with a burn. Chi-Yu does struggle against special walls like Clodsire and Blissey, so physically offensive Pokemon like Meowscarada and Kingambit make good teammates. Chi-Yu is also physically frail, so it appreciates teammates like Corviknight and Avalugg that can switch into strong physical attacks and Wish passers like Florges and Scream Tail that can help it stay healthy.</p>"

U-turn allows Roaring Moon to pivot out on these switch-ins, and Dragon Tail allows Roaring Moon to force out setup sweepers such as Manaphy, which Roaring Moon cannot meaningfully damage, while letting it rack up entry hazard damage. Stone Edge allows Roaring Moon to threaten the plethora of Flying- and Fire-types that the tier has, such as Thundurus, Iron Moth, and Zapdos, while Iron Head allows it to chip Fairy-types like Scream Tail and Diancie that otherwise can switch in freely. Roaring Moon appreciates physically defensive walls like Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Quaquaval that can remove entry hazards which limit Roaring Moon's walling capabilities, while it checks the special Electric- and Fire-types that threaten them like Hisuian Electrode and Iron Moth in return. Roaring Moon's presence is appreciated by pivots and wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Sword of Ruin Ceruledge due to its ability to switch into revenge killing attempts from the likes of Hisuian Electrode, Sandy Shocks, and Azelf. Roaring Moon deathly fears Dragon- and Fairy-types like Hydreigon, Walking Wake, and Enamorus-T, making Earth Eater Empoleon a notable partner with its ability to pivot into these Pokemon.</p>"
