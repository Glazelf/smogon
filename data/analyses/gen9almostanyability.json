Brave Bird is Corviknight's most consistent attack and 2HKOes or 3HKOes most special attackers, whereas Iron Head OHKOes Flutter Mane and avoids recoil. Defog provides entry hazard control, which is very crucial for teams facing hazard-stacking threats like Ting-Lu and Garchomp, while U-turn provides slow pivoting support for offensive teammates. As a result, frail pokemon such as Dragapult, Iron Bundle, and Iron Moth are great teammates, as they appreciate Corviknight's ability to get them in safely. Ice Scales Corviknight struggles against strong physical attackers, so pairing it with a strong physical wall like Avalugg or Hippowdon is recommended. Even with Ice Scales, Corviknight can be susceptible to strong special attacking Fire-types like Chi-Yu and Iron Moth, so Regenerator Garchomp and Ting-Lu make good teammates. Corviknight is prone to having its Defog blocked by Good as Gold, so it's strongly recommended for it to be paired with spinners such as Great Tusk that can remove entry hazards if Corviknight is unable to.</p> "

In return, Dragapult breaks through Fur Coat users like Hippodown and Corviknight for them. Dragapult is forced out by priority users such as Aerilate Dragonite and Triage Flutter Mane, so Pokemon that can switch into them like Gholdengo and Clodsire are recommended. Dragapult pairs well with defensive pivots like Corviknight and Iron Hands that can safely bring it onto the field to outspeed and threaten a majority of offensive threats, such as Flutter Mane and Chein-Pao. Entry hazards setters like Ting-Lu and Palossand can set Spikes and Stealth Rock, respectively, which helps Dragapult break past switch-ins like Kingambit more easily.</p> "
