        "description": "<p>Ice Scales Corviknight is a premier specially defensive pivot that can check prominent special attackers like Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, and Dragapult with its immense bulk and great typing while also providing entry hazard removal. Brave Bird is Corviknight's most consistent attack and 2HKOes or 3HKOes most special attackers, whereas Iron Head OHKOes Flutter Mane and avoids recoil. Defog provides entry hazard control, which is very crucial for teams facing hazard-stacking threats like Ting-Lu and Garchomp, while U-turn provides slow pivoting support for offensive teammates. As a result, frail pokemon such as Dragapult, Iron Bundle, and Iron Moth are great teammates, as they appreciate Corviknight's ability to get them in safely. Ice Scales Corviknight struggles against strong physical attackers, so pairing it with a strong physical wall like Avalugg or Hippowdon is recommended. Even with Ice Scales, Corviknight can be susceptible to strong special attacking Fire-types like Chi-Yu and Iron Moth, so Regenerator Garchomp and Ting-Lu make good teammates. Corviknight is prone to having its Defog blocked by Good as Gold, so it's strongly recommended for it to be paired with spinners such as Great Tusk that can remove entry hazards if Corviknight is unable to.</p> "
