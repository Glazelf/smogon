Earthquake forces out Ground-weak Pokemon like Iron Moth and Kingambit. Iron Head targets bulky Fairy-types such as Florges and Scream Tail, while Stone Edge hits threats such as Talonflame and Volcarona. Roaring Moon fits best on teams in need of a pivot with both longevity and a Speed tier that exceeds the likes of Chien-Pao and Barraskewda. Roaring Moon struggles to break past physically defensive foes like Levitate Garganacl, so it appreciates having strong special attackers such as Greninja and Gengar as teammates. Steel-types like Corviknight and physical walls like Dondozo are great for patching up Roaring Moon's defensive blind spots.</p> "},

        "description": "<p>Roaring Moon serves as a great specially defensive pivot, able to check various prominent special attackers like Iron Moth and Sandy Shocks with its good bulk and defensive typing. Crunch and Earthquake provide great coverage against the likes of Gengar and Iron Moth, Rock Slide consistently hits Volcarona while Stone Edge OHKOes fully defensive Volcarona after Stealth Rock, and Dragon Tail can punish setup and rack up entry hazard chip. Frail offensive attackers like Swords Dance Ceruledge and Cinderace appreciate Roaring Moon getting them onto the field safely. Roaring Moon, despite its great bulk, can fail against Fairy-types, especially Triage Hatterene, so partners like specially defensive Corviknight partner well with Roaring Moon. Corviknight can double as much appreciated hazard removal. Roaring Moon also struggles against most physical attackers and appreciates strong physical walls like Intimidate Corviknight and Fluffy Dondozo as partners.</p> "

Iron Head is for threats like Hatterene and Chien-Pao, while Earthquake deals with Kingambit and Cinderace. Frail offensive teammates like Gengar and Iron Moth appreciate Roaring Moon's ability to deal with faster threats. Additionally, defensive pokemon like Dondozo and Garganacl benefit from Roaring Moon's ability to pivot them in. Physically defensive walls like Corviknight and Fluffy Dondozo can limit Roaring Moon's effectiveness, so it's recommended to pair Roaring Moon with a special wallbreaker like Gengar or Sandy Shocks to deal with them.</p> "}

        "description": "<p>With its high Attack stat and variety of Sharpness-boosted moves, Iron Leaves is a decent wallbreaker that can OHKO common metagame threats like Garganacl and Quaquaval. Sacred Sword allows Iron Leaves to hit Grass- and Psychic-resistant foes like Kingambit and Hydreigon, while Wild Charge threatens Flying-types like Talonflame and Corviknight. Iron Leaves struggles with being prediction-reliant and having low physical bulk, especially with its 4x weakness to the extremely prevalent U-turn, which makes wrong predictions very punishing. Therefore, having defensive teammates like Ting-Lu and Corviknight that can repeatedly pivot it in safely are necessary. Due to its lack of recovery and need for repeated switching, Iron Leaves appreciates entry hazard removers like Iron Treads to keep it from getting worn down. Hadron Engine users like Sandy Shocks are also great teammates that power up both Psyblade and Wild Charge with Electric Terrain.</p> "
