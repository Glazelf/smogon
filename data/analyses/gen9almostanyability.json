Extreme Speed is useful priority that picks off weakened targets, Stealth Rock allows Hisuian Arcanine to act as an offensive entry hazard setter that pressures Corviknight and Iron Treads, and Flame Charge boosts its Speed to thwart potential revenge killers. As Hisuian Arcanine places a lot of pressure on physical walls, other physical cleaners like Meowscarada and Chien-Pao can be partnered with Hisuian Arcanine to clean up after it has broken those walls while providing speed control. Since Hisuian Arcanine is checked by Garchomp and bulky Water-types like Quaquaval, Refrigerate Regieleki makes a good partner for it by forcing these Pokemon out, pivoting Hisuian Arcanine in, and helping to deal with faster threats through its raw Speed. Hisuian Arcanine's middling Speed makes slow pivots like Corviknight good partners due to their ability to bring it in safely; alternatively, Corviknight's dual screens set allows Arcanine to take a hit and strike back.</p>"

Gengar struggles against teams with fast Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, and Chien-Pao, as it cannot meaningfully damage them and is immensely threatened by them, making Pokemon like Fluffy Corviknight and physically defensive Manaphy great partners; they can also provide a slow pivot to get Gengar in safely. Weather Ball from Pokemon with Primordial Sea or Desolate Land bypasses Normalize, meaning Gengar cannot reliably force out common users like Walking Wake and Volcanion, so sturdy checks to them like RegenVest Swampert and Blissey make solid teammates.</p>"

Offensive Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos, Chien-Pao, and Ceruledge appreciate Deoxys-D being able to weaken opposing walls with hazards or Knock Off, as well as potentially getting them in safely if it's running Teleport. Deoxys-D narrowly avoids 2HKOs from stronger wallbreakers like Iron Boulder, so hazard control options like Scrappy Great Tusk and Corviknight are highly recommended so that Deoxys-D can have more longevity.</p>"

Energy Ball hits Swampert and Iron Boulder; alternatively, Dark Pulse OHKOes Azelf and 2HKOes Gholdengo and Deoxys-D while still hitting Iron Boulder. Trick can debilitate defensive Pokemon, but it comes with the cost of weakening Deoxys-S. A Timid nature allows Deoxys-S to outspeed +1 Gouging Fire, +1 Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks, while a Modest nature gives it more power, allowing it to always 2HKO defensive Gholdengo after slight chip damage. Other special wallbreakers like Iron Moth, Walking Wake, and Latios are appreciated, as they can break down shared checks such as RegenVest users like Manaphy, Swampert, Meloetta, and Hisuian Goodra with Deoxys-S.

Focus Blast lets Deoxys-S damage Steel-types like Heatran and Hisuian Goodra, while Dark Pulse can be used instead to 2HKO Deoxys-D and Gholdengo. Knock Off is another option that can be used to debilitate opposing Pokemon like Swampert and Manaphy by removing their held items, making them easier for Deoxys-S and its teammates to deal with. Deoxys-S struggles against specially defensive Pokemon like Meloetta and Manaphy, so it pairs well with physically offensive partners like Chien-Pao, Meowscarada, and Galarian Zapdos that can effectively force them out. Due to its relative frailty and lack of recovery, Deoxys-S benefits from pivots like Corviknight and entry hazard removers like Great Tusk that allow it to come in safely.

Taunt shuts down entry hazard setters like Deoxys-D and Smeargle; setup sweepers such as Gouging Fire, Manaphy, and Iron Boulder; and Defoggers like Corviknight. Pokemon such as Gouging Fire and Chien-Pao that threaten Defog users pair well with Deoxys-S, since Defog threatens to remove dual screens after Deoxys-S has left the field. Mandibuzz is the biggest threat to Deoxys-S's dual screens, since its Defog cannot be blocked by Prankster Taunt. Since Deoxys-S is usually used as a suicide lead, it should only be used on hyper offense teams. Deoxys-S pairs well with setup sweepers like Manaphy, Roaring Moon, and Chien-Pao, since it's able to reliably get up dual screens, which allow them set up more easily and make harder to revenge kill. Pokemon weak to entry hazards such as Volcarona appreciate Deoxys-S's ability to block them from being set with Taunt. Dark-types, such as Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, are able to set up in front of Deoxys-S due to being immune to Prankster Taunt, so switch-ins like Great Tusk are required.</p>"

Ice Beam is used to hit Ground- and Dragon-types hard, such as Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon. Energy Ball can be used to beat Swampert while also pressuring Water- and Ground-types instead of being forced to predict. Superpower acts as Deoxys-S's main physical attack, being able to hit specially defensive walls such as Hisuian Goodra, Blissey, and Meloetta. Knock Off helps Deoxys-S and its teammates by crippling RegenVest users to be taken on better later in the game. Entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes let Deoxys-S potentially weaken defensive checks for itself and its teammates. Life Orb is used to more easily use Deoxys-S's mixed potential but can reduce how many times how many times its able to switch in. Choice Specs can be used instead as an easier way for Deoxys-S to hit 2HKO damage rolls on RegenVest Pokemon and give it more switch-in opportunities, but this gives it less flexibility and physical power. With 236 Speed EVs and a Naive nature, Deoxys-S is able to outrun +1 Jolly Gouging Fire and Garchomp as well as neutral Regieleki. Setup sweepers and Choice-locked Pokemon like Roaring Moon, Chien-Pao, and Manaphy appreciate Deoxys-S's presence, as it can help with weakening or taking out any of their checks such as Great Tusk, Primarina, and RegenVest users. Teams containing slower attackers also appreciate Deoxys-S, as it can act as a form of speed control. Deoxys-S does struggle with making it onto the field safely due to both hazards and having minimal bulk, so having a defensive pivot or a hazard remover would help it, like Great Tusk, Corviknight, or Mandibuzz.</p>"

Life Orb notably guarantees the 2HKO on specially defensive Garchomp with Draco Meteor.

Swords Dance allows Garchomp to threaten hazard removers like Quaquaval and act as a potential wincon late-game, while Dragon Tail forces switches, racking up entry hazard chip damage and preventing setup, and Liquidation hits both Landorus formes and Levitate Iron Treads and chips Corviknight. Regenerator allows it to switch in more times throughout a game to find opportunities to set up entry hazards or Swords Dance, while Well-Baked Body punishes Fire-types like Cinderace and Ceruledge for clicking their strong STAB moves and increases its walling capabilities.

Prankster + Haze, on the other hand, is an excellent tool to frustrate hyper offense teams and stop dangerous setup sweepers like Chien-Pao, Polteageist, and Chesnaught. While the consistent recovery of Black Sludge is generally preferred, Rocky Helmet allows Toxapex to annoy non-Magic Guard Galarian Zapdos and Chien-Pao even when it is forced to use Recover. Toxapex is utterly unable to threaten most Magic Guard users, like Galarian Zapdos and especially Water-resistant ones like Hisuian Electrode and Quaquaval, so reliable checks to them like Hisuian Goodra and Fluffy Corviknight are recommended. Toxic Spikes variants appreciate spinners like Iron Treads, as they can provide entry hazard removal without removing Toxic Spikes as well. Toxapex can easily be overwhelmed by multiple attackers, so it should always have a secondary physically defensive teammate, especially one that handles Ground-types, like Intimidate Corviknight; this also relieves some of the pressure off of Toxapex of checking pivots without Regenerator.</p>"

Garganacl's inability to check common special wallbreakers like Sheer Force Iron Moth and Enamorus-T makes pivots like Regieleki and Slither Wing and physical wallbreakers like Chien-Pao great partners; in return, they appreciate Garganacl's ability to maintain Stealth Rock on the field and annoy their checks like Hisuian Goodra and Corviknight with Salt Cure. Garganacl gets rapidly worn down by entry hazards when carrying Leftovers, making physically defensive hazard removal options like Corviknight and defensive Quaquaval good partners; these Pokemon also check physical wallbreakers that threaten Garganacl like Galarian Zapdos, while it checks the special wallbreakers that threaten them. The aforementioned Magic Guard Quaquaval checks Garganacl lacking Iron Defense + Body Press and can spin away Garganacl's Stealth Rock; Desolate Land Skeledirge can spinblock Quaquaval effectively, making it a good partner for Garganacl.</p>"

Chien-Pao appreciates other physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Roaring Moon and Galarian Zapdos helping break through walls like Intimidate Corviknight that it struggles to deal with.

Ruination spreads consistent damage, especially against Ground-immune foes like Earth Eater Kingambit, and forces defensive Pokemon like Corviknight, Hippowdon, and Blissey to waste their recovery PP. Whirlwind forces entry hazard damage onto foes and ensures Ting-Lu isn't setup fodder for threats like Talonflame and Quaquaval. The Speed IVs let it underspeed Corviknight to punish its Roost with Earthquake.

Some special attackers like Scream Tail can prove dangerous, so pairing Ting-Lu with Corviknight and Desolate Land Iron Moth are good options. Ting-Lu can switch into weaker physical attackers like Roaring Moon, but it should be used as help for the main physical wall on the team.

Desolate Land provides the most damage amplification and comes with an immunity to Water, whereas No Guard enables Chi-Yu to liberally spread burns with Inferno. Psychic is useful coverage to hit Clodsire and Iron Moth super effectively; alternatively, Will-O-Wisp allows Desolate Land sets to reliably spread burn, however Chi-Yu's poor bulk means it can be dangerous to use. Chi-Yu's best fit is on balance and offense teams that appreciate its high damage output, as well as its good matchups against common special walls like RegenVest Iron Treads.

Chi-Yu also has several Fire-type STAB moves to choose from: Fire Blast is the most powerful, Flamethrower is the most consistent option, and Inferno is used on No Guard sets to punish switch-ins like Garganacl and Ting-Lu with a burn. Chi-Yu does struggle against special walls like Clodsire and Blissey, so physically offensive Pokemon like Meowscarada and Kingambit make good teammates. Chi-Yu is also physically frail, so it appreciates teammates like Corviknight and Avalugg that can switch into strong physical attacks and Wish passers like Florges and Scream Tail that can help it stay healthy.</p>"

Earthquake and Stone Edge allow Roaring Moon to hit Steel-types such as Heatran and Fairy-types such as Enamorus-T, which resists both of its STAB moves, respectively. Lash Out is a good option to punish Intimidate Corviknight. Choice Scarf allows Roaring Moon to act as excellent speed control, outspeeding and revenge killing threats like Azelf and Deoxys-S, while Choice Band lets it OHKO Unaware Deoxys-D and Galarian Zapdos.

Weakness Policy can easily be activated by a weak U-turn from Corviknight, Manaphy, or Azelf, while Life Orb provides consistent damage. Applicable partners include Prankster Corviknight for its dual screens support and ability to pivot Roaring Moon in safely, and Gholdengo, since it has incredible type synergy with Roaring Moon, being able to resist Fairy, Dragon, Bug, Ice, and having an immunity to Fighting. Roaring Moon struggles against defensive Great Tusk, especially Fluffy variants, and Fluffy Corviknight. With partners such as Azelf and Manaphy for Great Tusk and Iron Moth and Gouging Fire for Corviknight, Roaring Moon's biggest checks and counters become quite threatened.

Weather Ball is run on Primordial Sea sets for consistency and to chunk Desolate Land Heatran, while Hydro Pump is preferred on Dragon's Maw variants. Draco Meteor hits Desolate Land Iron Moth and Water-resistant switch-ins like RegenVest Manaphy and Hisuian Goodra, outdamaging Regenerator on the latter two and OHKOing the former with Dragon's Maw sets. Knock Off can be run to let Walking Wake better enable its own wallbreaking by crippling RegenVest Pokemon, while Scald and Dragon Pulse can be used if its team already has Knock Off support as more consistent damaging options with no drawbacks and, in the case of Scald, the chance to burn foes. Flip Turn allows Walking Wake to maintain momentum and pivot in teammates safely. Due to its middling Speed when running Choice Specs, Walking Wake is susceptible to being revenge killed by Chien-Pao and Gengar, so it appreciates teammates like Choice Scarf Roaring Moon and Azelf that can take care of faster threats. While Walking Wake can play around RegenVest Pokemon with Knock Off, it still benefits from physically offensive teammates like Galarian Zapdos and Iron Boulder that can more easily handle them. Due to its lack of recovery, Walking Wake appreciates entry hazard removal support from the likes of Great Tusk and Corviknight to allow it to come in safely.</p>"
