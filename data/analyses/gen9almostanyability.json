        "description": "<p>Ting-Lu's absurd mixed bulk and unusual typing make it a formidable mixed wall, capable of checking several key threats such as Kingambit, Ceruledge, Dragapult, and Iron Moth. Ting-Lu's best entry hazard depends on its team, as it can form a strong hazard-stacking core with Stealth Rock and/or Spikes setters like Garganacl and Glimmora. Ruination spreads consistent damage, especially against Ground-immune foes like Dragonite and Noivern, and forces defensive Pokemon like Corviknight, Hippowdon, and Blissey to waste their recovery PP. Whirlwind forces entry hazard damage onto foes and ensures Ting-Lu isn't setup fodder for threats like Dragonite, Fur Coat Iron Hands, and Earth Eater Gholdengo. The Speed IVs let it underspeed Corviknight to punish its Roost with Earthquake. Foes like Scream Tail, Iron Valiant, and Iron Bundle can endanger Ting-Lu by targeting its weaknesses, so Ice Scales Corviknight and Desolate Land Iron Moth are good teammates; the former also provides Defog, while the latter provides Toxic Spikes to amplify Ting-Lu's own entry hazards.</p> "

Throat Chop lets it beat all Boomburst users and Ground-immune Gholdengo. Ruination + Sand Tomb traps and eliminates opposing Ting-Lu and Skeledirge, while also draining recovery PP from Hippowdon or Blissey. Some special attackers like Iron Valiant and Iron Bundle can prove dangerous, so pairing Ting-Lu with Ice Scales Corviknight and Desolate Land Iron Moth are good options. Ting-Lu can switch into weaker physical attackers like Roaring Moon, but it should be used as help for the main Fur Coat wall on the team. Ting-Lu is vulnerable to opposing setup sweepers, so teammates like Unaware Corviknight are greatly appreciated. Corviknight can also reduce its weakness to entry hazards.</p> "}

Choice Specs provides maximum wallbreaking power, notably allowing it to OHKO Ice Scales Corviknight and physically defensive Ting-Lu with Desolate Land + Overheat, whereas Choice Scarf gives it the Speed to clean late-game and chase out faster threats like Dragapult and Chien-Pao. Desolate Land provides the most damage amplification and comes with an immunity to Water, whereas No Guard enables Chi-Yu to liberally spread burns with Inferno. Psychic is useful coverage to hit Clodsire and Iron Moth super effectively; alternatively, Will-O-Wisp allows Desolate Land sets to reliably spread burn, however Chi-Yu's poor bulk means it can be dangerous to use. Chi-Yu's best fit is on balance and offense teams that appreciate its high damage output, as well as its good matchups against common special walls like Ice Scales Corviknight and RegenVest Iron Treads. Bulky pivots, like the aforementioned Corviknight and Iron Treads, make particularly good Chi-Yu partners because both can clear entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock.</p> "

Chi-Yu generally prefers to run Heavy-Duty Boots to avoid entry hazard damage, but Life Orb can be run on Sheer Force sets for extra power. Chi-Yu also has several Fire-type STAB moves to choose from: Fire Blast is the most powerful, Flamethrower is the most consistent option, and Inferno is used on No Guard sets to punish switch-ins like Garganacl and Ting-Lu with a burn. Chi-Yu does struggle against special walls like Clodsire and Blissey, so physically offensive Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Iron Hands make good teammates. Chi-Yu is also physically frail, so it appreciates teammates like Corviknight and Avalugg that can switch into strong physical attacks and Wish passers like Florges and Scream Tail that can help it stay healthy.</p> "

Iron Head and Stone Edge target Florges and Iron Bundle, respectively. 112 EVs in Attack let Roaring Moon always OHKO Dragapult with Throat Chop. Roaring Moon fits best on teams in need of a pivot with both longevity and a Speed tier that exceeds the likes of Iron Bundle and Dragapult. Roaring Moon struggles to break past physically defensive foes like Great Tusk and Iron Hands, so it appreciates having strong special attackers such as Armarouge and Iron Valiant as teammates.
