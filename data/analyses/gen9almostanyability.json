Extreme Speed is useful priority that picks off weakened targets, Stealth Rock allows Hisuian Arcanine to act as an offensive entry hazard setter that pressures Corviknight and Iron Treads, and Flame Charge boosts its Speed to thwart potential revenge killers. As Hisuian Arcanine places a lot of pressure on physical walls, other physical cleaners like Meowscarada and Chien-Pao can be partnered with Hisuian Arcanine to clean up after it has broken those walls while providing speed control. Since Hisuian Arcanine is checked by Garchomp and bulky Water-types like Quaquaval, Refrigerate Regieleki makes a good partner for it by forcing these Pokemon out, pivoting Hisuian Arcanine in, and helping to deal with faster threats through its raw Speed. Hisuian Arcanine's middling Speed makes slow pivots like Corviknight good partners due to their ability to bring it in safely; alternatively, Corviknight's dual screens set allows Arcanine to take a hit and strike back.</p> "

Swords Dance reduces Garchomp's passivity, allowing it to break down walls such as Quaquaval and Landorus-T over time. Garchomp's strong matchup against common entry hazard removers such as Quaquaval, Cinderace, and Well-Baked Body Iron Treads makes it an excellent Stealth Rock setter. Alternatively, if a teammate already carries Stealth Rock, Garchomp can use Spikes to apply more pressure to offensive teams. Dragon Tail deters setup sweepers such as Zamazenta-C and walls such as Corviknight and Ground immunity Iron Treads from taking advantage of Garchomp, while Rock Slide allows Garchomp to hit threats such as Enamorus-T, Zapdos, and Earth Eater Skeledirge. Corviknight is a brilliant partner for Garchomp, taking on dangerous physical attackers such as Galarian Zapdos and Chien-Pao for it, while Garchomp covers its Fire and Electric weaknesses. Blissey can take on the special attackers that can overwhelm Garchomp, such as Sheer Force Iron Moth, Choice Specs Zapdos, and Greninja. Iron Moth checks various threats to Garchomp, such as Corviknight, Scream Tail, and Enamorus-T, and it appreciates Garchomp's ability to beat Hisuian Arcanine and RegenVest users such as Meloetta. Other powerful wallbreakers such as Zapdos, Slither Wing, Hisuian Arcanine, and Volcanion appreciate Garchomp's phazing and entry hazard support to wear down their checks over time.</p> "

Similarly, more defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and Unaware Scream Tail also appreciate Garchomp outspeeding and heavily damaging offensive threats like non-Choice Scarf Slither Wing, Hisuian Arcanine, and Galarian Zapdos. Mixed Garchomp is vulnerable to faster threats that force it out with super effective moves, like Chien-Pao and Pixilate Scream Tail, and U-turn users that swing momentum in their favor, such as Meowscarada, Iron Moth, and Roaring Moon: slow, bulky pivots that help combat these weaknesses and turn momentum back in your favor, such as Corviknight, RegenVest Meloetta, and slow Iron Treads, are recommended.</p> "

Speed control from the likes of Hisuian Electrode and Regieleki is helpful, as Thundurus-T’s middling Speed leaves it prone to getting revenge killed.</p> "

Corviknight is unable to prevent Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Chien-Pao from setting hazards or setting up, so strong Fighting-type anti-leads like Slither Wing make excellent teammates.</p> "}

Barraskewda is very frail and appreciates bulky pivots such as Corviknight, Zapdos, and Manaphy, which can take a hit such as Dragonite's Extreme Speed or Azelf's Expanding Force and bring it in safely to threaten the foe. Barraskewda performs well alongside specially offensive pivots such as Walking Wake and Iron Moth, threatening the checks such as Hisuian Goodra and Garchomp that they would otherwise struggle to break, while in return they threaten Barraskewda'schecks such as Fluffy Corviknight and Zapdos. Due to its frailty, Barraskewda appreciates entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Quaquaval, ensuring it can come in as many times as possible to threaten the foe without fainting to hazard chip. Likewise, Barraskewda appreciates hazard setters such as Garchomp and Kommo-o wearing down checks such as Scream Tail and Desolate Land users over the course of a game, also securing a 2HKO on Manaphy lacking Defense investment with Close Combat after Stealth Rock damage.</p> "

Finally, tools found on hyper offense teams like dual screens, Sticky Web, and entry hazard stacking help Iron Moth more effectively avoid revenge killers and more easily eliminate any of its switch-ins.</p> "

Chien-Pao uses Sacred Sword in order to guarantee an OHKO on Pokemon like Kingambit, Heatran, and Hisuian Goodra, as well as heavily chipping Zamazenta-C. It can also use Lash Out over Crunch, which can 2HKO Intimidate Corviknight after Stealth Rock damage, though getting extra chip on Corviknight can help to guarantee the 2HKO. With Chien-Pao having one of the highest Speed tiers, it's able to pick up OHKOs on many frailer offensive Pokemon like Ogerpon-C and Gengar, it also works excellently as a revenge killer because of Ice Shard and it's its aforementioned high Speed able to take down weakened Pokemon or force out Pokemon like Ceruledge, Zapdos, and Azelf. Offensive Pivots such as Barraskewda and Hisuian Electrode appreciate Chien-Pao's presence, as they like being able to pivot into Chien-Pao to deal with Hisuian Goodra or Corviknight. Chien-Pao is weak to entry hazards, limiting how many times it can come in, so teammates like Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and Great Tusk can all help with it whilst also taking hits that Chien-Pao can't take and pivoting to get it in safely. Even with help from pivoting, Chien-Pao does have a hard time breaking through common foes such as defensive Corviknight, Unaware Scream Tail, and Quaquaval, which can all switch in on it fairly easily, but the help of teammates like Mixed Garchomp, Magic Guard Heatran, and Hisuian Electrode can help deal with its checks.</p> "

Ting-Lu can switch into weaker physical attackers like Roaring Moon, but it should be used as help for the main physical wall on the team. Ting-Lu is vulnerable to opposing setup sweepers, so teammates like Unaware Corviknight are greatly appreciated. Corviknight can also reduce Ting-Lu's weakness to entry hazards.</p> "}

Desolate Land provides the most damage amplification and comes with an immunity to Water, whereas No Guard enables Chi-Yu to liberally spread burns with Inferno. Psychic is useful coverage to hit Clodsire and Iron Moth super effectively; alternatively, Will-O-Wisp allows Desolate Land sets to reliably spread burn, however Chi-Yu's poor bulk means it can be dangerous to use. Chi-Yu's best fit is on balance and offense teams that appreciate its high damage output, as well as its good matchups against common special walls like RegenVest Iron Treads.

Chi-Yu also has several Fire-type STAB moves to choose from: Fire Blast is the most powerful, Flamethrower is the most consistent option, and Inferno is used on No Guard sets to punish switch-ins like Garganacl and Ting-Lu with a burn.

Pivots like Zapdos, Regieleki, and Hisuian Electrode form a VoltTurn core with Roaring Moon that wears down each other's checks. Roaring Moon's unimpressive physical bulk and weakness-laden typing mean that it is a prime target of revenge killers like Slither Wing and Triage Enamorus-T; walls like Corviknight and Hisuian Goodra pair well with Roaring Moon, as they absorb revenge killing attempts while providing defensive utility that Roaring Moon lacks.</p> "

Knock Off cripples switch-ins such as Empoleon and RegenVest Manaphy, Scald provides a more reliable STAB option on non-Primordial Sea sets while also threatening a burn on potential switch-ins, while Dragon Pulse provides a more reliable Dragon-type STAB move. Flip Turn is used in order to gain momentum for Walking Wake's teammates while also pivoting out of unfavorable matchups such as against Empoleon and Blissey. Primordial Sea allows Walking Wake to run Weather Ball instead of Hydro Pump, trading power for accuracy while also giving Walking Wake an easier time switching into Fire-types thanks to the Fire-type immunity. Dragon's Maw significantly boosts the power of Walking Wake's Dragon-type attacks, notably allowing it to OHKO RegenVest Manaphy after a Knock Off and one layer of entry hazards, at the cost of not increasing the power of its Water-type attacks and providing no additional defensive benefit. A Choice Specs can be used in order to increase Walking Wake's effectiveness as a wallbreaker, notably allowing non-Primordial Sea sets to 2HKO RegenVest Manaphy and Hisuian Goodra with Draco Meteor after a Knock Off, while a Choice Scarf can be used to outspeed and threaten an OHKO against would-be offensive checks, such as Weavile, Chien-Pao, and Roaring Moon. Walking Wake appreciates offensive teammates such as Galarian Zapdos, Meowscarada, and Ogerpon-C, which can pressure switch-ins like Empoleon, RegenVest Manaphy, and Desolate Land Heatran. Fast teammates such as Barraskewda and Choice Scarf Azelf also pair well with Walking Wake, as they appreciate the holes it breaks in the opponent's team while forming a VoltTurn core with the momentum they generate, potentially allowing them to sweep late-game. These teammates can also force out Walking Wake's offensive checks, such as Weavile, Chien-Pao, and Roaring Moon, which can outspeed it and threaten it with an OHKO.</p> "
