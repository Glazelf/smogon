Close Combat allows Hisuian Arcanine to hit Ting-Lu and Well-Baked Body Iron Treads, while Will-O-Wisp threatens burns on checks like physically defensive Quaquaval and Garchomp. Extreme Speed is useful priority that picks off weakened targets, Stealth Rock allows Hisuian Arcanine to act as an offensive entry hazard setter that pressures Corviknight and Iron Treads, and Flame Charge boosts its Speed to thwart potential revenge killers. As Hisuian Arcanine places a lot of pressure on physical walls, other physical cleaners like Meowscarada and Chien-Pao can be partnered with Hisuian Arcanine to clean up after it has broken those walls while providing speed control. Since Hisuian Arcanine is checked by Garchomp and bulky Water-types like Quaquaval, Refrigerate Regieleki makes a good partner for it by forcing these Pokemon out, pivoting Hisuian Arcanine in, and helping to deal with faster threats through its raw Speed. Hisuian Arcanine's middling Speed makes slow pivots like Corviknight good partners due to their ability to bring it in safely; alternatively, Corviknight's dual screens set allows Hisuian Arcanine to take a hit and strike back.</p>"

Skill Swap also reliably forces out and generates a free turn against any Pokemon slower than Gengar such as Sandy Shocks and Beads of Ruin Walking Wake, as they will be unable to hit it through Normalize. This makes Gengar one of the most reliable Toxic Spikes setters, as it threatens most common removal options like Corviknight and Great Tusk. Gengar is an excellent teammate for fast special cleaners like Azelf, Deoxys-S, and Iron Moth, as they benefit tremendously from opposing special walls being removed or weakened with Toxic Spikes. Gengar struggles against teams with fast Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, and Chien-Pao, as it cannot meaningfully damage them and is immensely threatened by them, making Pokemon like Fluffy Corviknight and physically defensive Manaphy great partners; they can also provide a slow pivot to get Gengar in safely. Weather Ball from Pokemon with Primordial Sea or Desolate Land bypasses Normalize, meaning Gengar cannot reliably force out common users like Walking Wake and Volcanion, so sturdy checks to them like RegenVest Swampert and Blissey make solid teammates.</p>"

Adaptability Luster Purge consistently OHKOes common slower offensive Pokemon like Zapdos and Walking Wake without dropping Latios's Special Attack, but Trick can cripple an opposing Chansey or Deoxys-D or disrupt a setup sweeper like Cresselia. Adaptability provides the most overall power to the set, letting it reliably 2HKO common RegenVest pivots like Swampert and Manaphy with Psyshock, while Tinted Lens lets it 2HKO Meloetta and Empoleon with Psyshock and have a good chance to OHKO Corviknight and Gholdengo with Draco Meteor. Latios pairs well with fast cleaners like Deoxys-S and Hisuian Electrode, as they can readily take advantage of the opposing RegenVest user being removed from the match. Strong physical wallbreakers like Iron Boulder and the Ogerpon formes appreciate Latios bringing them in safely with Flip Turn and even chunking their checks like Corviknight that may try to eat a predicted Psyshock. Latios invites in powerful Dark-type revenge killers like Roaring Moon and Chien-Pao, making robust checks to these such as Fluffy Corviknight and Regenerator Primarina mandatory.

Adaptability is more consistent, as it is always active and does not announce itself, while Hadron Engine can support Electric-types and Surge Surfer users, disrupt opposing terrain from the likes of Azelf and Deoxys-S, and let Latios OHKO Corviknight with Thunderbolt. Trick is an option in the last slot to shut down bulky setup sweepers like Cresselia and cripple walls like Deoxys-D. Latios works best with slow pivots like Corviknight and Swampert that can get it onto the field in advantageous positions; similarly, Latios often provides easy entry to slow, wallbreaking teammates like Galarian Zapdos and Ceruledge with Flip Turn. Latios is heavily threatened by Chien-Pao and Roaring Moon, as they discourage it from using its Psychic-type moves and can even threaten it thanks to priority moves and Choice Scarf, respectively.

Calm Mind allows Latios to set up against passive foes such as Corviknight and Skarmory. Soul Dew notably makes Adaptability Draco Meteor a guaranteed 2HKO on Corviknight after a Calm Mind, but Leftovers is an option to give Latios more longevity. Adaptability is the preferred ability for consistent high damage, allowing Latios to reliably 2HKO Blissey and RegenVest Swampert with Psyshock, while Tinted Lens is an option to threaten an OHKO on Corviknight and Gholdengo with Draco Meteor after a Calm Mind and 2HKO Heatran and Hisuian Goodra with Psyshock after a boost. Latios works fantastically with other powerful special attackers such as Iron Moth, Zapdos, and Azelf, as they all appreciate RegenVest users and Blissey being weakened. Latios also appreciates slow, physically bulky pivots such as Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and physically defensive Manaphy, who which can both pivot it in safely and effectively check the offensive Dark-types that threaten Latios such as Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, and Chien-Pao.

Many of the best physical walls such as Corviknight and Manaphy survive by barely avoiding 2HKOs, which they fail to when switching into Future Sight as well, while others like Iron Hands, Great Tusk, and Pecharunt take far too much damage from Future Sight anyway. Doom Desire is an alternative with no immunities that also hits Scream Tail harder but otherwise has worse coverage against relevant targets. Psychic Noise denies recovery to Empoleon and Corviknight and punishes aggressive Iron Moth and Great Tusk switch ins. The last moveslot is extremely flexible; Thunderbolt for Corviknight, Iron Head for Scream Tail, Ice Punch for Dragonite, and Body Slam to fish for paralysis are some of the most notable options. Jirachi should be paired with physical wallbreakers on more offensive teams, as they best take advantage of its combination of slow pivoting and Future Sight. Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Zamazenta, Ceruledge, and the Ogerpon formes are excellent teammates that also appreciate Jirachi switching into fast Psychic-types like Deoxys-S and Azelf attempting to revenge kill them. Jirachi is weak to several common special attackers, most notably primal weather users like Iron Moth and Walking Wake, and Ghost-types such as Gengar and Gholdengo, so teammates that can offensively check them like other primal weather users and Roaring Moon are greatly appreciated.

Ice Beam is used to hit Ground- and Dragon-types hard, such as Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon. Energy Ball can be used to beat Swampert while also pressuring Water- and Ground-types instead of being forced to predict. Superpower acts as Deoxys-S's main physical attack, being able to hit specially defensive walls such as Hisuian Goodra, Blissey, and Meloetta. Knock Off helps Deoxys-S and its teammates by crippling RegenVest users to be taken on better later in the game.

The final two moveslots are very flexible. Knock Off debilitates switch-ins like Swampert, Manaphy, and Hisiuan Goodra. Dazzling Gleam threatens to OHKO offensive Roaring Moon and does good damage to Mandibuzz and Chien-Pao, while Flamethrower allows Azelf to still hit the latter while having coverage into Corviknight and non-Well-Baked Body Gholdengo. Trick can punish switch-ins like Hisuian Goodra and Manaphy while also debilitating other walls like Deoxys-D, but it makes Azelf a less reliable form of Speed control. Defensive pivots like Corviknight and Swampert give Azelf a Pokemon to fall back on and a slow pivot to get it in safely, while offensive pivots like Barraskewda and Roaring Moon appreciate Azelf setting up Psychic Terrain to get rid of their weakness to priority moves. Depending on its coverage, Azelf can struggle breaking through Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon like Hisuian Goodra and Mandibuzz as well as bulky special walls like Swampert and the rare Blissey, so wallbreakers like Great Tusk and Galarian Zapdos make excellent partners, as they can deal with these Pokemon, and the former also removes entry hazards Azelf can struggle against. Other offensive Pokemon that are weak to priority moves like Ogerpon-W, Roaring Moon, and Chien-Pao also make excellent partners with Azelf due to the Psychic Terrain it sets up.</p>"

Manaphy should be aware of Knock Off, as it is heavily reliant on Assault Vest to provide defensive value. Manaphy can be overwhelmed by teams with multiple special wallbreakers like Deoxys-S, Hisuian Electrode, Azelf, and Walking Wake, so it should be run either with a secondary special wall or on more offensive teams that limit opposing wallbreakers.

Manaphy also works well on hyper offense teams if using Protosynthesis due to Booster Energy being single-use; on these teams, it likes to be supported by other special wallbreakers such as Latios, Gholdengo, and Azelf that can help to wear down specially bulky checks for Manaphy like Blissey, Iron Moth, and Ceruledge.</p>"

Physical attackers like Roaring Moon and Chien-Pao naturally threaten Meloetta out, so Pokemon that can deal with them, like Corviknight, Great Tusk, and defensive Quaquaval, make for good partners. Lastly, Meloetta appreciates entry hazard removal from the likes of Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Mandibuzz, to keep its HP high enough to switch into strong attackers.</p>"

Flame Body has a 30% chance to end the usefulness of opposing offensive pivots, again, most notably Roaring Moon, and greatly frustrates Rapid Spin Great Tusk attempting to clear Spikes. Iron Defense is the preferred fourth move to set up alongside Bulk Up Great Tusk and Swords Dance users like Iron Hands and Garchomp, while Knock Off can help remove Heavy-Duty Boots to further accentuate Spikes. The given EV spread lets Chesnaught outpace Corviknight, giving it extra chances to fish for a burn, as Brave Bird will not 2HKO it after Iron Defense. Chesnaught mostly finds its home on stall teams, where it can find plenty of teammates to switch into its common weaknesses, especially Fire and Psychic, and can find multiple switch-in opportunities to try and activate Flame Body, which is one of the few ways for stall teams to punish pivoting. Chesnaught is especially horrified of Fire-types like Ceruledge and Cinderace, as they can obliterate it without fear of a burn, and it cannot touch Ghost-types like Gengar and Hisuian Zoroark without Knock Off, so teammates like Well-Baked Body Mandibuzz are strongly recommended.</p>"

Brave Bird is Corviknight's strongest neutral move and hits Ghost-types and key targets like Great Tusk and Galarian Zapdos, while Body Press fits well on Intimidate sets to do more damage to Roaring Moon, Ogerpon-C, and Chien-Pao. Corviknight is exceedingly passive, so it needs powerful and fast offensive teammates like Barraskewda and Azelf to re-gain momentum; in exchange, it provides them safe entry with its slow U-turn and entry hazard removal. Slower wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Ceruledge also appreciate Corviknight's slow pivoting services.

Barraskewda is very frail and easily OHKOed by faster foes such as Choice Scarf Roaring Moon and Azelf, which makes defensive pivots such as Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and Swampert necessary.

Body Press, when coupled with maximum Defense investment, deals consistent damage to Corviknight, while Ice Spinner can be used to hit Flying-type switch-ins like both Zapdos formes and Dragonite. Knock Off debilitates switch-ins like Corviknight and Zapdos by removing their Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots, respectively. Alternatively, Great Tusk can use Stealth Rock if none of its teammates are capable of setting it. Bulk Up can also be considered to increase Great Tusk's offensive presence, but is typically less preferred than other utility options. Scrappy notably prevents Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Pecharunt from spinblocking Great Tusk. Alternatively, Regenerator provides Great Tusk with reliable recovery it otherwise lacks, while Fluffy allows it to better check attackers such as Roaring Moon and allows a teammate like Swampert to use Regenerator instead. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures Great Tusk can more reliably remove entry hazards by avoiding chip damage from them, while Leftovers provides recovery for non-Regenerator sets, and Rocky Helmet can be used to punish attackers that make contact. Offensive Pokemon that appreciate entry hazards off the field such as Azelf and Chien-Pao pair well with Great Tusk's Rapid Spin support. Due to its poor special bulk, Great Tusk appreciates specially bulky Pokemon, such as Heatran, Empoleon, and if not using Regenerator, RegenVest Pokemon such as Manaphy and Swampert. Certain physical wallbreakers such as Chien-Pao and Galarian Zapdos are significant threats to Great Tusk, so it appreciates a secondary physical wall capable of checking these Pokemon such as Corviknight or Skarmory.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its high Special Attack and decent Speed, Chi-Yu is a potent wallbreaker that makes use of Nasty Plot and its unresisted STAB combination to tear through common walls like Sand Stream Garganacl and non-Unaware Florges. Chi-Yu generally prefers to run Heavy-Duty Boots to avoid entry hazard damage, but Life Orb can be run on Sheer Force sets for extra power. Chi-Yu also has several Fire-type STAB moves to choose from: Fire Blast is the most powerful, Flamethrower is the most consistent option, and Inferno is used on No Guard sets to punish switch-ins like Garganacl and Ting-Lu with a burn. Chi-Yu does struggle against special walls like Clodsire and Blissey, so physically offensive Pokemon like Meowscarada and Kingambit make good teammates. Chi-Yu is also physically frail, so it appreciates teammates like Corviknight and Avalugg that can switch into strong physical attacks and Wish passers like Florges and Scream Tail that can help it stay healthy.</p>"

A high Attack combined with the power of Sword of Ruin as well as a good Speed tier allows it to function as a potent wallbreaker or revenge killer, depending on your choice of item. Earthquake and Stone Edge allow Roaring Moon to hit Steel-types such as Heatran and Fairy-types such as Enamorus-T, which resists both of its STAB moves, respectively. Lash Out is a good option to punish Intimidate Corviknight. Choice Scarf allows Roaring Moon to act as excellent speed control, outspeeding and revenge killing threats like Azelf and Deoxys-S, while Choice Band lets it OHKO Unaware Deoxys-D and Galarian Zapdos. Roaring Moon struggles against Fluffy Corviknight and defensive Great Tusk, so partners such as Azelf and Ogerpon-H are appreciated; in return, it can threaten their checks like Gholdengo and Walking Wake.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Due to its high Attack and Speed further augmented by Dragon Dance, Roaring Moon functions incredibly as a threatening setup sweeper. Iron Head provides coverage for Fairy-types like Scream Tail, while Stone Edge nails Mandibuzz and can bypass Fluffy walls like Corviknight. Outrage is used to deal massive damage to physically bulky Pokemon such as Iron Hands at the cost of confusion; alternatively, Acrobatics can be used to handle Great Tusk and most Ogerpon formes after Weakness Policy's activation. Weakness Policy can easily be activated by a weak U-turn from Corviknight, Manaphy, or Azelf, while Life Orb provides consistent damage. Applicable partners include Prankster Corviknight for its dual screens support and ability to pivot Roaring Moon in safely, and Gholdengo, since it has incredible type synergy with Roaring Moon, being able to resist Fairy, Dragon, Bug, Ice, and having an immunity to Fighting. Roaring Moon struggles against defensive Great Tusk, especially Fluffy variants, and Fluffy Corviknight. With partners such as Azelf and Manaphy for Great Tusk and Iron Moth and Ogerpon-H for Corviknight, Roaring Moon's biggest checks and counters become quite threatened. Additionally, wallbreakers such as Choice Band Iron Boulder and Chien-Pao can both physically wear down defensive walls to clear the way for Roaring Moon to get a clean sweep.</p>"

      "RegenVest": {
        "description": "<p>Roaring Moon's excellent set of resistances, great Speed and Attack, and solid bulk make it a serviceable bulky pivot without the passivity of other RegenVest Pokemon like Manaphy and Swampert; in particular, its great typing allows it to scout and offensively check and prominent special attackers like Gholdengo, Iron Moth, and Hisuian Electrode. U-turn allows it to maintain high momentum, pivoting out of difficult matchups like against Great Tusk and Fluffy Corviknight and healing off any chip damage with Regenerator. Earthquake allows it to hit Steel-types like Kingambit and Heatran, which would otherwise trouble it. Roaring Moon tends to play aggressively, with its average bulk contributing to it being seen mainly on offensive teams; therefore, hard-hitting offensive teammates like Ogerpon-C, Chien-Pao, and Azelf enjoy its presence. Roaring Moon cannot safely switch in on strong Dragon-types like Latios and Walking Wake, so a secondary special wall like Empoleon or Scream Tail makes for an excellent partner. Entry hazards severely compromise Roaring Moon's longevity, and its lack of physical bulk makes it reliant on strong physical walls to take hits instead; as a result, physically defensive hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight are nearly essential partners.</p>"

Choice Specs can be run to provide Walking Wake with more wallbreaking power, notably giving it a chance to 2HKO RegenVest Swampert, while Choice Scarf helps to make up for its relatively poor Speed and lets it outspeed and OHKO the likes of Chien-Pao and Deoxys-S. Weather Ball is run on Primordial Sea sets for consistency and to chunk Desolate Land Heatran, while Hydro Pump is preferred on Dragon's Maw variants. Draco Meteor hits Desolate Land Iron Moth and Water-resistant switch-ins like RegenVest Manaphy and Hisuian Goodra, outdamaging Regenerator on the latter two and OHKOing the former with Dragon's Maw sets. Knock Off can be run to let Walking Wake better enable its own wallbreaking by crippling RegenVest Pokemon, while Scald and Dragon Pulse can be used if its team already has Knock Off support as more consistent damaging options with no drawbacks and, in the case of Scald, the chance to burn foes. Flip Turn allows Walking Wake to maintain momentum and pivot in teammates safely. Due to its middling Speed when running Choice Specs, Walking Wake is susceptible to being revenge killed by Chien-Pao and Gengar, so it appreciates teammates like Choice Scarf Roaring Moon and Azelf that can take care of faster threats. While Walking Wake can play around RegenVest Pokemon with Knock Off, it still benefits from physically offensive teammates like Galarian Zapdos and Iron Boulder that can more easily handle them. Due to its lack of recovery, Walking Wake appreciates entry hazard removal support from the likes of Great Tusk and Corviknight to allow it to come in safely.</p>"
