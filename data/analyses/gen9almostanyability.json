Speed control via Thunder Wave from allies like Blissey and Scream Tail is useful in deterring faster foes like Greninja.

Corrosion + Toxic is particularly effective against Corviknight, which commonly switches into Toxapex expecting to be immune to poison. However, pairing Toxic with Prankster means that Toxapex will be unable to poison Corviknight and Dark-type Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Roaring-Moon. Tablets of Ruin is also a viable option to allow Toxapex to stay in more comfortably against physical threats such as Meowscarada. Surf provides a decent STAB option to hit physical walls such as Corviknight, but Chilling Water can also be used in lieu of Liquidation to guarantee a lowered Attack stat. Iron Moth can threaten Toxapex and is also immune to poison damage, so a specially defensive partner like Garchomp is valuable.</p> "
