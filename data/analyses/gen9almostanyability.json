Extreme Speed is useful priority that picks off weakened targets, Stealth Rock allows Hisuian Arcanine to act as an offensive entry hazard setter that pressures Corviknight and Iron Treads, and Flame Charge boosts its Speed to thwart potential revenge killers. As Hisuian Arcanine places a lot of pressure on physical walls, other physical cleaners like Meowscarada and Chien-Pao can be partnered with Hisuian Arcanine to clean up after it has broken those walls while providing speed control. Since Hisuian Arcanine is checked by Garchomp and bulky Water-types like Quaquaval, Refrigerate Regieleki makes a good partner for it by forcing these Pokemon out, pivoting Hisuian Arcanine in, and helping to deal with faster threats through its raw Speed. Hisuian Arcanine's middling Speed makes slow pivots like Corviknight good partners due to their ability to bring it in safely; alternatively, Corviknight's dual screens set allows Arcanine to take a hit and strike back.</p> "

Power Gem acts as a strong coverage option, targeting common Fire- and Steel-type switch-ins like Skeledirge and Primordial Sea Zapdos. A Mild nature is chosen to maximize both Heatran's physical and special power, and 96 Attack EVs let it 2HKO common RegenVest users like Meloetta and Hisuian Goodra after Stealth Rock damage. 200 Speed EVs let Heatran outspeed Modest Volcanion, and the rest of the available EVs are put into Special Attack to maximize Steel Beam's power. Heatran relies on being able to consistently force foes out to make progress, so bulky entry hazard setters like Garchomp and Ting-Lu can help set up Spikes alongside Heatran's Stealth Rock to consistently chip and punish the opponent's switches. Additionally, to help seal the deal against bulky pivots like Garchomp and fast revenge killers like Chien-Pao, Heatran appreciates teammates like Scream Tail to absorb their hits and have a chance to make progress against them.

Due to its frequent need to switch and reliance on a recoil move to wallbreak, Palafin requires effective entry hazard removers like Corviknight and Donphan; WishPass Scream Tail is also a great teammate to heal off chip damage. Even with its strong coverage moves, Palafin struggles mightily against opposing Desolate Land, so reliable switch-ins like Well-Baked Body Slither Wing are strongly recommended.

Earthquake forces out Ground-weak Pokemon like Iron Moth and Kingambit. Iron Head targets bulky Fairy-types such as Florges and Scream Tail, while Stone Edge hits threats such as Talonflame and Volcarona. Roaring Moon fits best on teams in need of a pivot with both longevity and a Speed tier that exceeds the likes of Chien-Pao and Barraskewda. Roaring Moon struggles to break past physically defensive foes like Levitate Garganacl, so it appreciates having strong special attackers such as Greninja and Iron Moth as teammates. Steel-types like Corviknight and physical walls like Dondozo are great for patching up Roaring Moon's defensive blind spots.</p> "},

Crunch and Earthquake provide great coverage against the likes of Polteageist and Iron Moth, Rock Slide consistently hits Volcarona while Stone Edge OHKOes fully defensive Volcarona after Stealth Rock, and Dragon Tail can punish setup and rack up entry hazard chip. Frail offensive attackers like Swords Dance Ceruledge and Cinderace appreciate Roaring Moon getting them onto the field safely. Roaring Moon, despite its great bulk, can fail against Fairy-types, especially Triage Hatterene, so partners like specially defensive Corviknight partner well with Roaring Moon. Corviknight can double as much appreciated hazard removal. Roaring Moon also struggles against most physical attackers and appreciates strong physical walls like Intimidate Corviknight and Fluffy Dondozo as partners.</p> "

Frail offensive teammates like Choice Specs Greninja and Iron Moth appreciate Roaring Moon's ability to deal with faster threats. Additionally, defensive pokemon like Dondozo and Garganacl benefit from Roaring Moon's ability to pivot them in.

Iron Head is used to hit bulky Fairy-types like Scream Tail and Florges, while Outrage is a powerful alternative for bulky Dragon-types like Garchomp. Special attackers like Iron Moth and Greninja appreciate Roaring Moon's ability to break through specially defensive walls like Sand Stream Garganacl and Regenerator Tinkaton while they can beat Intimidate Corviknight that could otherwise wall Roaring Moon and threaten it with Body Press. Roaring Moon can have a tough time setting up safely, so having a teammate like Corviknight that can safely switch it in or having dual screens support from setters like Slowking are recommended. Roaring Moon can also be threatened by priority users such as Triage Hatterene and Ice Shard Chien-Pao, so pairing it up with a wall that can sponge priority moves like Toxapex or anti priority measures such as Psychic Surge Armarouge is advised.</p> "

Sacred Sword allows Iron Leaves to hit Grass- and Psychic-resistant foes like Kingambit and Hydreigon, while Wild Charge threatens Flying-types like Talonflame and Corviknight. Iron Leaves struggles with being prediction-reliant and having low physical bulk, especially with its 4x weakness to the extremely prevalent U-turn, which makes wrong predictions very punishing. Therefore, having defensive teammates like Ting-Lu and Corviknight that can repeatedly pivot it in safely are necessary. Due to its lack of recovery and need for repeated switching, Iron Leaves appreciates entry hazard removers like Iron Treads to keep it from getting worn down. Hadron Engine users like Sandy Shocks are also great teammates that power up both Psyblade and Wild Charge with Electric Terrain.</p> "
