  "Wingull": {
    "overview": "<p>Wingull is capable of reaching the coveted 19 Speed tier, meaning it can outspeed almost all of its unboosted foes and hit them hard with one of its powerful STAB moves. Although Wingull must rely on Hurricane's shaky accuracy in order to beat the Grass-type foes that resist Scald, this is remedied by the fact that Wingull functions very well in rain, which provides Hurricane with perfect accuracy and increases Scald's power by 50%. Unfortunately, these are the only two significantly powerful options Wingull has access to, meaning it can be walled by specially bulky foes such as Chinchou and Porygon. Wingull is also very frail, and although it resists some common priority attacks such as Mach Punch and Aqua Jet, any Pokemon that can withstand a hit will usually OHKO it in return, especially with its Stealth Rock weakness and Life Orb recoil taken into account. Despite Wingull's flaws, it can be difficult to stop in the rain without a Choice Scarf user, as its decent Special Attack stat and Life Orb mean very few Pokemon can safely switch into it, especially as Wingull is capable of punishing switch-ins with Knock Off and U-turn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roost allows Wingull to recover from Life Orb recoil, but Wingull's mediocre defenses prevent it from using this move effectively. Wingull can use Rain Dance itself to increase Hurricane's accuracy and boost the power of Scald, but this is better left to its teammates, as Wingull is generally not bulky enough to use it effectively. Choice Scarf allows Wingull to function as a decent revenge killer and pivot. However, Wingull's damage output will decrease significantly if it uses Choice Scarf and Wingull generally dislikes being locked into one move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Chinchou is an excellent counter to Wingull, as it does not take much damage from any of Wingull's moves, aside from Hidden Power Grass, and can either OHKO Wingull with Volt Switch or cripple it with Thunder Wave. Elekid and Choice Scarf Magnemite are able to revenge kill Wingull.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Slowpoke and Frillish are able to switch into Scald and deal a massive amount of damage to Wingull with Psychic and Shadow Ball, respectively. However, Frillish and Slowpoke both take heavy damage from Hurricane. Omanyte is also a good check to Wingull, as it resists Hurricane and does not mind being burned by Scald.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Eviolite Users</strong>: Porygon and Muchlax are rarely 2HKOed by Hurricane and can deal a massive amount of damage to Wingull with Tri Attack and Body Slam, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Pawniard deals a large amount of damage to Wingull with Sucker Punch. Fletchling also deals massive damage to Wingull with Acrobatics.</p>",

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Wingull's most powerful Water-type move, and it hits extremely hard in the rain after Life Orb and STAB are factored in. Hurricane is Wingull's most powerful Flying-type STAB move, and it has perfect accuracy in the rain. However, if Wingull is not being used on a rain team or if Hurricane's accuracy is undesirable outside of rain, Air Slash can be used as a safe alternative, although the loss in power is noticeable. Knock Off and U-turn punish Wingull's switch-ins by either removing their item or escaping from them while gaining momentum by bringing in a teammate able to take them on. Hidden Power Grass allows Wingull to hit Chinchou, Tirtouga, and Omanyte, but it covers little else.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With a Timid nature and 236 Speed EVs, Wingull reaches 19 Speed, allowing it to outspeed most other unboosted foes such as Mienfoo and Archen, both of which it can OHKO with Hurricane and Scald, respectively. A Timid nature is chosen over a Hasty or Naive nature, as this prevents Wingull's bulk from being lowered, and U-turn and Knock Off are used for their utility rather than their power. 18 HP IVs allow Wingull to reach 19 HP, minimizing Life Orb recoil. If using Hidden Power Grass, the EV spread should be changed to 240 SpA / 236 Spe to account for the drop in IVs. Although Rain Dish is practically useless, it negates Life Orb recoil in the rain.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Wingull is too frail to be switched into an attack. It needs to be brought in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch or as a revenge killer, preferably once specially bulky foes are significantly weakened so that Wingull can sweep. However, it can do severe damage to teams mid-game with the rain up, allowing for a teammate to clean up afterwards. Wingull makes for a good lead, as it can force out common lead Pokemon such as Drilbur and Mienfoo and take advantage of the switch with Knock Off or U-turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A switch-in to Electric-type moves is imperative. Chinchou is the best example of this thanks to Volt Absorb. It can also provide a free switch for Wingull with Volt Switch, burn Wingull's physical checks with Scald, and capably set up rain for Wingull. Ferroseed and Foongus are also able take on Chinchou and other Water-types that trouble Wingull. Ferroseed is able to set entry hazards while Foongus can set up rain and neutralize foes with Spore. Wingull fits well on rain-based teams, especially as it is able to beat most Grass-types, something other rain sweepers usually cannot do. However, Swift Swim sweepers such as Anorith and Omanyte are still good teammates for their ability to quickly raze teams with their combined offensive pressure.</p>"

  "Woobat": {
    "overview": "<p>Woobat has access to a useful ability in Simple, which allows it to quickly become a threatening Calm Mind sweeper. While it does have good Speed, the rest of its stats are rather mediocre, meaning it's nearly dead weight without any stat boosts. Its low bulk is also an issue, limiting its setup opportunities, not to mention its typing, which leaves it weak to Knock Off and Stealth Rock. Woobat requires heavy team support to be used effectively, but its unique abilities and movepool certainly give it a solid niche in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Woobat has plenty of other coverage moves it can run, such as Giga Drain, Energy Ball, Shadow Ball, and Signal Beam. Charge Beam can boost Woobat's Special Attack by two stages in tandem with Simple, making it an interesting option. Knock Off is an option to cripple walls that may switch into Woobat, allowing it or a teammate to more easily deal with them later. Taunt can prevent opposing walls such as Ferroseed and Porygon from using a status move on Woobat as it sets up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Pawniard and Houndour are immune to Stored Power, and can deal heavy damage with their super effective STAB moves or revenge kill Woobat with Sucker Punch. Houndour in particular is immune to both Stored Power and Heat Wave, only fearing the uncommon Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off heavily damages Woobat and removes its Eviolite, making it much easier to deal with and revenge kill.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Pokemon that outspeed Woobat such as Gastly, Choice Scarf Pawniard, or Choice Scarf Magnemite can revenge kill it, preventing it from sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Utility Moves</strong>: Taunt prevents Woobat from setting up or healing and limits Woobat's offensive potential. Encore can lock Woobat into a setup move, making it much easier to play around. Roar and Whirlwind both force Woobat to switch out, negating all stat boosts it has accumulated. On a similar note, Haze eliminates all of Woobat's stat boosts, bringing its sweep to a complete halt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Simple Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thanks to Simple, Calm Mind boosts Woobat's Special Attack and Special Defense by two stages each. After a single use of Calm Mind, Stored Power has 100 Base Power, hitting any foe that doesn't resist the move very hard at +2. Heat Wave provides coverage against Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Pawniard, the latter of which is immune to Stored Power. Hidden Power Fighting can also be used in the third slot, as the set would otherwise be completely walled by Houndour. However, Woobat will be forced to lose a point in either Defense, Special Attack, or Speed due to the drop in IVs, making it a subpar option, especially considering Woobat is still heavily threatened by Houndour's Sucker Punch. Roost keeps Woobat healthy as it sets up, preventing it from being easily picked off by a faster Pokemon later in the battle.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature and maximum investment in Speed assure Woobat hits 17 Speed, outspeeding Pawniard and tying with Mienfoo. The rest is put into Special Attack so that Woobat hits as hard as possible. 76 HP EVs allow Woobat to hit an odd number in HP, reducing the impact of Stealth Rock and slightly improving Woobat's longevity. The 12 EVs in Defense prevent Eviolite Pawniard's Sucker Punch from OHKOing Woobat most of the time. Eviolite improves Woobat's bulk and gives it more setup opportunities.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Woobat can be used as an early-game wallbreaker or a late-game sweeper depending on your team's matchup. The combination of Simple, Calm Mind, and Stored Power immediately puts heavy pressure on several foes, and is quite useful for punching holes in the opponent's team early-game for that reason. The presence of Sturdy + Berry Juice Pokemon on the opponent's team, such as Dwebble, Tirtouga, and Magnemite, however, can limit Woobat's effectiveness early-game, so Woobat should be preserved for mid- to late-game if these Pokemon are still present.</p> <p>Ideally, Woobat should try to set up on slower Pokemon that use special attacks, such as Spritzee and Skrelp. This allows Woobat to set up Calm Mind while healing off any damage done with Roost. Woobat can even set up on weaker super effective hits, such as defensive Chinchou's Volt Switch. Keeping Woobat healthy with Roost is important, as it is prone to being picked off by faster Pokemon and priority moves after it gets a KO. Try to avoid Knock Off, too, as Woobat is incredibly easy to revenge kill without Eviolite.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Croagunk, and Timburr pair well with Woobat, as they can easily handle the Dark-type Pokemon that give it trouble, such as Pawniard and Houndour, and can also serve as viable switch-ins to Knock Off users in general. Pokemon that appreciate having special walls heavily weakened or defeated, such as Life Orb Abra and Life Orb Gastly, also pair well with Woobat. Memento support from Cottonee or Diglett can help give Woobat extra opportunities to set up Calm Mind. Woobat appreciates having Stealth Rock removed to maximize its setup opportunities, so a Rapid Spin or a Defog user such as Staryu, Drilbur, or Archen can pair well with Woobat to ensure that it stays at full health when it switches in.</p>"

  "Vanillite": {
    "overview": "<p>Vanillite is the only Ice-type Pokemon with access to Autotomize, which doubles its Speed and, along with its decent Special Attack, allows it to function as a late-game sweeper. It has also access to Ice Shard, which can be helpful to hit faster threats even when unboosted. Vanillite has poor bulk, though, which makes it vulnerable to priority moves after using Autotomize and to powerful attacks when unboosted. It also has a limited special movepool, being outclassed by Amaura in terms of coverage and power; however, unlike Amaura, Vanillite isn't OHKOed by Fighting-type priority moves. Its two abilities are useless: Ice Body doesn't give Vanillite any special advantage, while Weak Armor even is detrimental because it makes Vanillite weaker to priority moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flash Cannon hits Spritzee and the rare Ice-types in the tier, but it forces Vanillite to give up more useful coverage. Frost Breath can be used over Ice Beam, as it gets better damage rolls in several cases—for instance, it has a much better chance of OHKOing Foongus after Stealth Rock and has the utility of always landing a critical hit, which can be (situationally) useful against Calm Mind users. The downside is its imperfect accuracy. Water Pulse hits Fire- and Rock-types while leaving a free moveslot for another type of Hidden Power to deal with Steel- or Water-types. Magic Coat can prevent status moves, but Taunt is a better option because it prevents the foe from setting up as well. Signal Beam can hit Slowpoke and Abra super effectively. Hidden Power Fighting can be used to KO Pawniard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Fighting-types</strong>: Timburr, Mienfoo, and Croagunk are all bulky enough to switch into Vanillite's attacks, and they can easily KO it with their STAB moves. Timburr and Croagunk also have access to priority moves to finish off Vanillite when it's weakened.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon With Recovery</strong>: Porygon, Spritzee, and Munchlax take very little damage from Vanillite's attacks and are all able to stall out or 2HKO Vanillite without taking any damage thanks to their recovery moves. They must be wary of Vanillite carrying Taunt, though.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Staryu and Slowpoke resist Vanillite's main STAB move and take little damage from Hidden Power Ground. Defensive Chinchou can be a good check, but it has to be wary of Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Pawniard</strong>: Pawniard is faster than unboosted Vanillite and can OHKO it with Iron Head, while it takes little damage from Hidden Power Ground if holding an Eviolite; in addition, it can revenge kill boosted Vanillite with Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Almost every faster Pokemon with a powerful STAB move that Vanillite doesn't resist is able to KO it before it sets up due to its lackluster defenses. Priority users, such as Timburr, Pawniard, and Fletchling, are able to finish off Vanillite once it's weakened, even after a boost.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Larvesta, Ponyta, and Vulpix can stomach a hit from Vanillite and easily KO back. Larvesta is particularly notable, as it's only hit neutrally by Hidden Power Ground.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Autotomize": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Autotomize allows Vanillite to double its Speed, making it a good late-game sweeper. Ice Beam is Vanillite's go-to move and deals a good amount of damage to neutral targets. Hidden Power Ground helps deal with Fire-types, Steel-types, Skrelp, and Chinchou, which Vanillite wouldn't be able to hit in a relevant way otherwise. Ice Shard helps deal some damage to priority users and play around Sucker Punches. Taunt can prevent status moves such as Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, and Recover from being used.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>240 EVs are used to maximize Vanillite's Special Attack, and 244 Speed EVs are useful to outspeed almost all other Pokemon after Autotomize, including 17 Speed Pokemon with Choice Scarf. Eviolite gives Vanillite decent bulk that helps it set up Autotomize without being KOed by almost every attack. Use a Modest nature if you aren't running Ice Shard. Vanillite's ability doesn't give it any particular advantages, but Weak Armor makes it more susceptible to priority moves, so Ice Body is the best choice.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because of its subpar bulk, Vanillite can't switch into any attacks, so it needs to switch in when something on your team is KOed or only when you are sure it is able to tank the opposing attack with ease and that the foe doesn't have any coverage move that can hit Vanillite super effectively. In addition to Vanillite's subpar bulk, its lack of useful resistances heavily limits its opportunities to switch in and set up. Even against Pokemon Vanillite can theoretically \"force out\" and try to set up on, such as some Grass- or Flying-types, it still must be wary of the foe staying in and attacking due to its low defensive stats, potentially putting it into easy KO range for a revenge killer later. Use Autotomize when there are no strong counters or revenge killers on the opponent's team. Be aware that Vanillite can fail to set up and can be OHKOed because of its mediocre bulk, even if it holds Eviolite.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vanillite appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Ferroseed, Drilbur, Dwebble, and Trubbish to weaken bulkier Pokemon that it wouldn't be able to deal with otherwise. Memento users such as Cottonee and Stunky can help Vanillite set up by forcing a switch or simply weakening the foe. Gothita pairs well with Vanillite because it is able to deal with bulky Water-types, Fighting-types, and bulky Pokemon such as Porygon and Spritzee. Bulky Pokemon such as Spritzee, Trubbish, Croagunk, and Vullaby can be switched into priority moves and Knock Off, especially from Fighting-types, which threaten Vanillite. Fighting-types can handle bulky Normal-types and provide Knock Off support, making it easier for Vanillite to sweep. Wallbreakers, such as Snivy and Mienfoo, along with Knock Off support, are very good to weaken the opposing team, including Vanillite's checks.</p>"

  "Deerling": {
    "overview": "<p>Deerling's main niche in the Little Cup metagame lies in its ability Sap Sipper, which gives it an immunity to Grass-type moves. Thanks to Sap Sipper, Deerling serves as one of the only offensive Snivy checks, able to switch in on a Leaf Storm, gain an Attack boost, and outspeed and KO the opposing Snivy. Deerling also forces out various other Grass-types and can capitalize on that fact thanks to its wide movepool. Additionally, Deerling's great base Speed stat allows it to hit 18 Speed, outspeeding much of the unboosted metagame. Deerling's unique STAB combination lets it hit common Grass-type checks with Normal coverage, and it is the only offensive Grass-type that can do this. This unique typing holds it back, however, giving it a weakness to common powerful Flying- and Fighting-type priority moves, which somewhat offsets its high Speed, and leaving it weak to common moves such as Ice Beam and U-turn. Deerling also is easily crippled by status, which many of the Pokemon it aims to check can easily inflict (such as Glare Snivy and Scald or Thunder Wave Chinchou). Additionally, Deerling's defensive stats, though acceptable, are not much more than that, which gives it limited durability in a match.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aromatherapy can be run on either set to give Deerling a way to heal itself and its teammates, since many of the Pokemon it switches into run status moves, such as Scald Chinchou and Glare Snivy. A Chlorophyll set is possible, since Deerling is one of the only physical Chlorophyll sweepers and the fastest Pokemon with the ability. Usually, though, sun teams don't need a Pokemon to fulfill this specific role, and Deerling is already fast without Chlorophyll. A Work Up set can also be run, with Deerling either taking advantage of the boosts itself or Baton Passing them to a teammate with its good Speed, but Deerling lacks the bulk to reliably pull off such a set. Feint Attack, despite its low Base Power, gives Deerling a way to hit Honedge, Pumkaboo, and Gastly, which would all otherwise wall it, but running it over another move usually causes Deerling to miss out on vital coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Priority Users</strong>: Strong priority users such as Fletchling, Timburr, and Pawniard can take advantage of Deerling's poor defensive stats and hit it hard with super effective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Moves</strong>: Deerling has a plethora of weaknesses, including some to the common Fighting-, Flying-, and Ice-type moves that many Pokemon run as coverage in LC. Deerling cannot consistently take these attacks, and they wear it down very quickly.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Cross Chop Elekid, Brick Break Aipom, Choice Scarf Mienfoo and Scraggy, and Taillow all easily revenge kill Deerling with their super effective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types, especially Honedge, Pumkaboo, and Gastly, are hard counters to Deerling, and all can set up or, in the case of Pumpkaboo, get free recovery, against it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fire-types</strong>: Ponyta and Larvesta switch into Deerling with no fear and threaten to burn it with Flame Body or Will-O-Wisp. Ponyta also is able to outspeed Deerling, while Larvesta has U-turn to give its side momentum.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return and Seed Bomb serve as Deerling's two STAB moves and capitalize on its unique type combination. Both hit quite hard thanks to Life Orb, especially after a Sap Sipper boost. Jump Kick hits Steel-types, which resist both of Deerling's STAB moves. In the last slot, Substitute lets Deerling take advantage of the switches it forces, as well as check Ferroseed with no fear of getting paralyzed. Wild Charge lets Deerling lure in and remove Archen, which would otherwise wall it. Baton Pass gives Deerling a way to keep momentum alive by pivoting out on one of the switches it forces to bring in the appropriate counter and can let Deerling pass the Attack boosts it gets from Sap Sipper off to a teammate. Baton Pass can also be run over Jump Kick on teams that don't really require coverage to hit Steel-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sap Sipper gives Deerling a pseudo-immunity to Grass-type moves, allowing it to check Snivy, Cottonee, Ferroseed, and other common Grass-types. The given Attack EVs, plus Life Orb, allow Deerling to make the most use of the Attack boosts it gets from Sap Sipper, as well as force out the Pokemon it checks and hit the switch-ins as hard as possible. Maximum Speed EVs and a Jolly nature are used so Deerling can hit 18 Speed, outspeeding a majority of the metagame, most notably Snivy. The remaining EVs go into HP and Defense to bolster Deerling's physical bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set works best by capitalizing on Deerling's unique ability to wall certain Pokemon: Ferroseed, Cottonee, and Snivy, specifically. Deerling should be sent in against these Pokemon to get a Sap Sipper boost if possible and then force the Pokemon out. Deerling can also be used to force out Chinchou and, to a lesser extent, Magnemite. However, Deerling does need to be wary of status moves, such as Snivy's Glare and Chinchou's Scald. Additionally, due to its excellent Speed tier, Deerling can be used to revenge kill weakened opposing Pokemon throughout the match. This Deerling set struggles against opposing priority, and so it should usually be switched out of Pokemon such as Pawniard, Fletchling, and Timburr, which carry powerful priority moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because of the switches that Deerling forces, teammates that set up entry hazards make for good partners. Onix and Drilbur are good options that can set Stealth Rock for Deerling, and in return they appreciate having Water- and Grass-type attacks sponged that they're weak to. Onix can also check the Fire- and Flying-types that make Deerling's life miserable. Fighting-type checks such as Skrelp and Snubbull are necessary for Deerling to do its job. Skrelp and Deerling form a very solid resistance core as well. Likewise, a Fletchling check is absolutely essential. Archen, Omanyte, and the aforementioned Onix counter Fletchling while retaining good synergy with Deerling. Pokemon that appreciate a +1 Speed boost Baton Passed to them such as Choice Scarf Drilbur and Shellder all make for good partners as well. Lastly, sweepers that need Grass-types worn down, such as Corphish, appreciate Deerling doing so.</p>"
      },
      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return and Seed Bomb both deal respectable damage and keep Deerling from being complete Taunt and setup bait. Thunder Wave allows Deerling to support its team by paralyzing switch-ins. Baton Pass lets Deerling switch out of an unfavorable matchup without having to predict, as well as often pass a Substitute to give a free switch to a teammate or pass a Sap Sipper Attack boost. Substitute gives Deerling a way to capitalize on the switches it forces, as well as get around Grass-types that might attempt to paralyze it, such as Glare Snivy and Thunder Wave Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Special Defense EVs allow Deerling to sponge special hits as well as possible. Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature put Deerling at 18 Speed, which lets it outspeed the majority of the metagame. The rest of the EVs go into HP, to give Deerling an odd-numbered HP stat and allow it to pass as many Substitutes as possible, and Attack, to make it a little less passive. Sap Sipper allows Deerling to switch in against Grass-types with no fear. Berry Juice gives Deerling the ability to create more Substitutes over the course of a match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Defensive Deerling is designed to take advantage of the switches Deerling forces to support its team through paralysis and chip damage on opposing Pokemon. Deerling should not take repeated hits, even neutral ones, due to its overall mediocre defenses and lack of recovery. Thunder Wave is easy to spam early in the match to slow down whatever switches into Deerling. Late-game, Deerling can begin to attack to get chip damage on foes so a teammate can sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive Deerling works best on teams that need a more defensively reliable Grass-type check. Fighting-type checks are a must when using Deerling. Snubbull makes for a good partner because it can switch in on the Fighting-types that threaten Deerling while dealing damage to Poison-types with Earthquake. Croagunk resists both Fighting- and Poison-type moves for Deerling and can weaken opposing teams with Knock Off. Ponyta is a good partner for Deerling because it checks Fighting-types, Fletchling, and Pawniard and can weaken Skrelp and Archen, all of which prevent Deerling from doing its job. Stunky can remove the Ghost-types that trouble Deerling, can weaken Pawniard, and appreciates Deerling checking Ground-types for it. This Deerling set has good defensive synergy with Water-types, such as Chinchou and Skrelp, the latter of which also resists Fighting and works well with offensive Pokemon that need Grass-types removed, such as Tirtouga and Corphish.</p>"

  "Cubchoo": {
    "overview": "<p>Cubchoo has an interesting niche in the Little Cup metagame, possessing good offensive capabilities with its decent Attack and Special Attack stats, and having access to an array of coverage moves. However, Cubchoo lacks in its defensive capabilities and Speed, making it a bit more vulnerable than most attackers. Cubchoo's excellent coverage lets it greatly threaten common Pokemon that switch into it, potentially OHKOing or 2HKOing them with moves such as Play Rough, Rock Tomb, and Superpower. However, Cubchoo's Ice typing gives it very common weaknesses to Steel-, Fire-, Rock-, and Fighting-type moves. Cubchoo also can be greatly hindered by status moves such as Will-O-Wisp, as it cuts Cubchoo's Attack severely. Cubchoo is also vulnerable to all types of entry hazards, which hinders its longevity in battle. Overall, Cubchoo is quite a niche Pokemon in the Little Cup metagame because it has very few opportunities to switch in due to its poor bulk and typing, low Speed, and almost zero defensive synergy, and it has to rely heavily on prediction.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cubchoo can also opt to run a mixed attacker set with a Life Orb and a Timid nature, alongside Rock Tomb, Surf, Superpower, and Ice Beam. This alternative set should run maximum Special Attack, in order to force physically defensive Pokemon such as Foongus and Vullaby out. This set can also be used to lure out checks such as Ponyta, Pawniard, and Ferroseed, as they can be OHKOed or 2HKOed by Surf, Superpower, and Ice Beam, respectively. Substitute can be used over Rock Tomb on the physical set, as it deals with Pawniard more easily. Finally, Night Slash can be used to deal heavy damage to Pokemon such as Slowpoke, Honedge, Bronzor, and Frillish.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: In particular, Mienfoo and Timburr can both outspeed Cubchoo and beat it with their Fighting-type STAB moves, resisting almost all of Cubchoo's moves with the exception of Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon also pose a threat to Cubchoo, as most commonly used ones such as Magnemite and Pawniard outspeed Cubchoo and can easily take it out with their powerful STAB moves; Bronzor can also be a threat to Cubchoo, as it can set entry hazards and heal itself with Berry Juice while Recycle stalling Cubchoo and then inflicting it with Toxic or attacking its weaker Special Defense with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Most Fire-type Pokemon in the tier are fast, such as Magby and Ponyta, which can easily outspeed Cubchoo and take it out with either Fire Blast or Flare Blitz. However, mixed Cubchoo sets are able to KO Fire-types with Surf.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon</strong>: Although Cubchoo has coverage moves to deal with Rock-type Pokemon, some fast Rock-type Pokemon such as Onix and Archen can either set entry hazards to damage Cubchoo when it switches in or take it out immediately with a STAB Rock-type move. Cubchoo also needs to be careful of Rock Tomb itself.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Cubchoo has mediocre Special Defense and can be picked off by neutral special attacks, so it is often forced out by powerful special attackers, especially the ones Cubchoo doesn't have coverage moves against, such as Gastly.</p> <p><strong>Walls</strong>: Cubchoo can easily be picked off by bulkier Pokemon, as they tend to not take much from Cubchoo's attacks and are able to wear it down. Many walls also carry status moves that hinder Cubchoo's longevity. Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Slowpoke in particular are a big problem for Cubchoo, as it doesn't have any coverage moves against them and falls victim to Toxic or Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Fast Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Faster offensive Pokemon can really threaten Cubchoo with their STAB moves. For example, Cubchoo doesn't tend to run any coverage moves to hit Gastly and Honedge and will just be left open to their fast and powerful STAB moves, although Cubchoo can run the rare Night Slash and take them both out.</p>",

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Cubchoo's primary STAB move is Ice Punch, which deals a lot of damage to Grass-, Ground-, Dragon-, and Flying-type Pokemon such as Foongus and Fletchling. Play Rough is a very useful coverage move that lets Cubchoo OHKO or deal heavy damage to the Fighting-type Pokemon that switch into it. Superpower is Cubchoo's main coverage move against Dark-, Rock-, and Steel-types such as Pawniard and Tirtouga, as it deals massive damage and can potentially OHKO them if they switch into Cubchoo. Like Play Rough, Rock Tomb is used best to check Fire-types when they switch into Cubchoo so they can take substantial damage and receive a drop in their Speed stat, potentially letting Cubchoo 2HKO them. Instead of Rock Tomb, Encore can also be used to cripple setup sweepers Calm Mind Spritzee that attempt to setup on Cubchoo.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set is all-out offensive, as Cubchoo's powerful coverage moves can threaten its checks that switch into it, such as Fighting-types and Steel-types. Cubchoo can use Rock Tomb effectively with entry hazards, as it can 2HKO Fire-types and slow them down so Cubchoo can move first, although Ponyta is still faster after one Rock Tomb. Rock Tomb allows Cubchoo to outspeed nearly every Pokemon that it can hit with one of its coverage moves; however, Cubchoo should be wary of Pawniard, as it gains a +2 boost to its Attack thanks to Defiant, and can KO Cubchoo with Knock Off. Cubchoo can be replaced by a Fighting-type Pokemon or a Pokemon that resists Sucker Punch as Cubchoo is very reliant on its item and the +1 Speed boost Rattled gives it isn't worth the lost item. An Eviolite is used to make Cubchoo more bulky, as its defensive capabilities are lacking. Alternatively, a Life Orb can be used to increase Cubchoo's offensive capabilities, threatening many Pokemon that switch into it. Sets running Life Orb work very well alongside entry hazard support, but they make Cubchoo more frail and reduces its longevity. Cubchoo shouldn't really switch into Knock Off despite the Rattled Speed boost, as Cubchoo's item is more valuable than its Speed, and it fares poorly against common Knock Off users such as Mienfoo and Pawniard, especially since the Speed boost doesn't allow Cubchoo to outspeed them anyway.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cubchoo can be used to take out powerful Flying-types such as Fletchling and offensive Vullaby, as it is bulky enough to take their hits and retaliate with Ice Punch. Cubchoo can also handle Grass-types with Ice Punch, but it has to be careful because most Grass-types in LC have status moves and can target Cubchoo's mediocre Special Defense. Cubchoo can take out Ground-types with Ice Punch if it gets the chance, but it should be careful against top-tier Ground-types such as Drilbur and Diglett, as they both outspeed Cubchoo; however, it has the bulk to take a Rock Slide and OHKO with Ice Punch. Cubchoo should never be switched into neutral special moves or super effective moves, as although Cubchoo may be bulky, it can't take powerful special moves or powerful super effective moves such as High Jump Kick and Shadow Ball. Cubchoo's Ice typing only gives it a resistance to other Ice-type moves, making it very reliant on the support of other Pokemon. Cubchoo should be very careful in trying to avoid status if at all possible, particularly burns, as they can neuter Cubchoo's offensive capabilities and severely cut its longevity. Stealth Rock and other entry hazards are very effective against Cubchoo, as Stealth Rock deals a chunk of damage and Cubchoo's longevity is very important if you're going to use it efficiently. Cubchoo can get a useful Speed boost from Bug-, Ghost-, or Dark-type moves, but it often doesn't have enough bulk to make use of the Speed boost, although it gets a Speed boost from every hit of Venipede's Pin Missile.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Being an Ice-type, Cubchoo heavily relies on support from other Pokemon to deal with its numerous checks. Cubchoo really appreciates Pokemon that can easily switch into Knock Off, as Cubchoo is very reliant on its item. Cubchoo appreciates entry hazard setters and Defog and Rapid Spin users as Cubchoo needs the extra damage when sweeping. Cubchoo also needs entry hazards removed on its side, as they can hinder Cubchoo's longevity, so a perfect Pokemon for this slot would be Drilbur, as it can both set and remove entry hazards. Clerics are very useful to increase Cubchoo's longevity; a good Pokemon for this role would be Spritzee. Bulkier Pokemon in general make excellent partners for Cubchoo. Defensive Pokemon or Knock Off absorbers such as Bronzor and Shellos, respectively, can take care of moves such as Knock Off or super effective attacks that are thrown at Cubchoo. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Munchlax and Lickitung are also of use, as they can tank special attacks such as Scald far better than Cubchoo can. Stalling Pokemon are also very effective, as they can wear out offensive sweepers that are sent out to deal with Cubchoo and can take them out. Cubchoo is often forced out by fast, offensive Fire-types such as Ponyta and Magby, as Cubchoo can't touch them unless it predicts the switch. Seel is a great teammate to deal with these Pokemon, as its typing, Thick Fat, and access to Aqua Jet allow it to check these Fire-types very easily. In return, Cubchoo can help to deal with some Grass-types such as Foongus.</p>"

  "Koffing": {
    "overview": "<p>The mascot of Smogon, Koffing continues to be a great help to many teams. With a high Defense stat and Poison typing, Koffing reliably walls some of the powerful physically attacking Pokemon in the metagame. Not only does it take little damage from Fighting-types, it also gets Levitate, meaning that it is immune to one of its would-be weaknesses. This leaves it weak to only one type, the uncommon Psychic-type. However, Koffing is extremely slow and lacks any strong offensive power. Also, despite its incredible physical bulk, Koffing is susceptible to most special attackers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Because Koffing has no reliable means of recovery, Berry Juice would be a helpful option. However, as Koffing commonly switches into Fighting-type Pokemon, this item is likely to be removed by Knock Off. RestTalk is another option for recovery and makes Koffing a fantastic wall to most Chlorophyll sweepers as it resists Grass- and Poison-type attacks and won't mind Sleep Powder. Flamethrower is a more accurate option than Fire Blast, but it does not have the same level of power, which means that it's less capable of dealing with common Steel-types. Explosion is an option for going out with a bang. Memento can be used as a suicide option as well, almost entirely stripping an enemy of their offensive presence, and can be used to help a teammate come in and set up afterward. Thanks to its Poison typing, Koffing has access to a perfectly accurate Toxic. Koffing can utilize Stockpile in a defensive set, likely using Toxic or Toxic Spikes to slowly KO opposing Pokemon while it survives. Toxic Spikes is a new addition to Koffing's movepool and can be used to poison all grounded foes as they enter battle, although opposing Poison-types can absorb them just by switching in. Haze is more reliable for stopping setup sweepers than Clear Smog in most cases, but does not deal damage and is blocked by Taunt. Thunderbolt is an option for hitting Water- and Flying-types hard, and can be useful for getting around Tentacool, but is generally not useful otherwise. Shadow Ball can be used to hit Psychic- and Ghost-type switch-ins such as Abra and Gastly. Taunt can stop slower walls such as Hippopotas and Foongus from using status moves or recovering, but Koffing is generally a bit too slow to utilize this to its full potential.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Abra, Slowpoke, and a few others can inflict major damage to Koffing with their STAB attacks. Gothita is especially notable for being able to trap Koffing with Shadow Tag and follow up with an easy KO.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake Users With Mold Breaker</strong>: Drilbur especially, but also Cranidos, can override Koffing's immunity to Ground-type attacks by ignoring Levitate. This means that their powerful Ground-type moves can easily hit Koffing and OHKO it most of the time.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types resist Sludge Bomb well as Fire Blast. Some of the more specially inclined ones, such as Omanyte, don't mind being burned and set up on Koffing with little risk.</p> <p><strong>Tentacool</strong>: Tentacool walls any set without Thunderbolt and can deal decent damage with Scald or use Knock Off against either Koffing or an incoming teammate as Koffing flees.</p> <p><strong>Flash Fire</strong>: Ponyta and other Flash Fire users can come in on a Will-O-Wisp or Fire Blast and get a boost to their Fire-type attacks, often putting Koffing in a defensively bad position, especially if its Eviolite has been removed via Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Koffing is threatened by Pokemon that can prey on its low Special Defense and disregard the Attack drop from a burn, such as Abra.</p> <p><strong>RestTalk Users</strong>: Chinchou and Munchlax don't care about burns, as they can use Rest to remove them, and Koffing's attacks do very little to them.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp is Koffing's key to bringing down physical attackers and is perhaps the most important move in its arsenal. Pain Split is Koffing's only means of recovery. Though unreliable, it not only heals Koffing, but damages the opponent as well. Sludge Bomb is a STAB attack that can deal decent chunks of damage and has a nice 30% chance to poison the opposing Pokemon. Clear Smog is a possible option over Sludge Bomb if you want Koffing to be able to stop setup sweepers from getting out of control, though its effect will not activate if the opponent has a Substitute up. Fire Blast is primarily for hitting the Steel-types that are immune to Koffing's STAB move; it lands a powerful hit on Pawniard and nails Ferroseed especially hard. Destiny Bond lets Koffing take a foe down with it when it is KOed by a direct attack. It's mostly a last-ditch attempt to get rid of a troublesome enemy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Eviolite, with the given EV spread, gives Koffing an effective Defense stat of 30. This allows Koffing to tank physical hits well. Apart from maxing out Defense, the remaining EVs contribute to Koffing's special bulk so that it can survive stray neutral special hits more easily. Fewer EVs are invested in HP so that Pain Split takes more health from the opponent. Levitate rids Koffing of its would-be Ground-type weakness, except for when facing an opponent with Mold Breaker and Earthquake.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Koffing can switch in comfortably against Bug-, Fairy-, Ground-, and Fighting-type foes and can force most physical attackers out with the threat of Will-O-Wisp. A warning to the wise: do not use Will-O-Wisp on Timburr. Most Timburr run Guts, which will boost its Attack and help it deal more damage. Pain Split can be used at lower health against enemies with higher health to damage them while also recovering HP; Koffing's low Speed can come in handy for this move in particular, as it lets the opponent take away some of its health before stealing it back with Pain Split. Destiny Bond can be used to make the opponent reconsider delivering a fatal blow. This looming threat often keeps foes from attacking a low Koffing, providing an opportunity to recover with Pain Split while they hesitate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Koffing's main goal is to neutralize Fighting-type threats. Because of this, teammates that have problems with Fighting-types enjoy the support that Koffing provides. Koffing appreciates the recovery granted by Wish support, even though it has Pain Split; Lickitung makes a particularly good partner for this purpose, as Koffing can shrug off the Fighting-type attacks aimed at Lickitung, while its Wish recovery can be provided to both of them. Scraggy makes an ideal partner that covers Koffing's sole weakness to Psychic-type attacks, and Koffing tanks the Fighting-type attacks aimed at Scraggy. Other Dark-types, such as Zorua and Purrloin, love having Koffing as a partner, as it resists all of their weaknesses. Other Dark-types such as Vullaby and Pawniard appreciate this coverage too, but to a lesser extent, as their second type neutralizes some of these resistances. Chinchou makes a good partner for dealing with Tentacool, which resists Koffing's STAB move and Fire Blast rather easily. Entry hazard setters like Dwebble and Ferroseed can be ideal partners, as Koffing can force switches which rack up residual damage quite nicely.</p>"

  "Trapinch": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Trapinch suffers competition from Diglett as a Ground-type trapper, it is able to heavily differentiate itself through its higher Attack stat and far greater bulk. Its decent defenses allow it to trap several important threats that Diglett struggles against, although they still aren't anything to write home about. Trapinch's effectiveness outside of trapping specific targets is hindered by its low Speed and limited movepool. Furthermore, once it has done its job, its common weaknesses make it easy to force out. For these reasons, Trapinch's disadvantages should be carefully weighed before simply throwing it onto a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Trapinch's movepool outside of the listed options is underwhelming at best. Endure or Substitute can be used to more reliably activate Trapinch's Berry Juice if it has been weakened, but most attacks will already weaken Trapinch enough to activate it; they can also be used in conjunction with Custap Berry, but the given set is more reliably effective. Crunch is Trapinch's best option for Gastly, but it has little use otherwise. An EV spread of 156 HP / 196 Atk / 76 SpD / 36 Spe with an Adamant nature, Eviolite, and a moveset of Bulldoze / Superpower / filler / filler is geared specifically towards revenge killing offensive Porygon and has a good chance of revenge killing wall Porygon as well, but it fares much worse against Trapinch's other targets. Otherwise, Trapinch is too slow to take advantage of Speed-lowering moves. Most offensive Trapinch sets are badly hindered by its low Speed, making sets such as Life Orb Trapinch generally unviable. A set with minimum Speed can be used to take advantage of Trick Room thanks to Trapinch's high Attack stat, but Trapinch lacks the power to OHKO most Eviolite holders even with a Life Orb, possibly forcing it to give up precious Trick Room turns and preventing it from acting as an effective sweeper; as such, its primary role on these teams should be to trap important threats for other Trick Room sweepers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pokemon That Can Defeat Trapinch in a One-on-one Scenario</strong>: Although Trapinch cannot be checked or countered in the traditional sense due to Arena Trap, it is easily forced out after getting a KO by most Grass-, Water-, Flying-, and Ice-types, as well as anything that has the means to heavily damage it and is not significantly threatened in return; this includes a large portion of the metagame such as Foongus, Corphish, Drifloon, and Spritzee.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers That Do Not Mind Earthquake</strong>: Trapinch's reliance on Earthquake to significantly damage foes means that certain setup sweepers such as Timburr and Snivy can easily force it out after it has KOed something. They are especially dangerous because Trapinch cannot simply sacrifice itself once it has been weakened.</p> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: Despite taking heavy damage from Superpower, a healthy Porygon can countertrap Trapinch by Tracing Arena Trap and eventually come out on top, especially if it is carrying Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Arena Trap</strong>: Trapinch is unable to perform its duty as a trapper against Flying- and Ghost-types and Levitate users because they are immune to Arena Trap; Flying-types and Levitate users are also immune to Trapinch's STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Trapinch's primary STAB move, heavily damaging most Pokemon that do not resist it. Feint guarantees that Trapinch can pick off weakened threats such Focus Sash Abra and Sturdy Magnemite; it is used over Quick Attack because the difference in damage is negligible for its purpose with the given EV spread, and Feint can let Trapinch get some chip damage in on opposing priority users. Rock Slide provides coverage against Flying- and Bug-types, although it lacks the Base Power to significantly damage bulkier Pokemon. The last moveslot is just a filler option; Toxic ensures that Calm Mind Spritzee does not set up on Trapinch, whereas Superpower threatens Porygon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given defensive EVs ensure that Life Orb Adamant Pawniard's Knock Off and Analytic Magnemite's Flash Cannon almost never OHKO Trapinch after Stealth Rock. 18 Attack lets Trapinch 2HKO Eviolite-less Spritzee the vast majority of the time. Berry Juice is a strong item on Trapinch because it usually lets Trapinch heal back to full HP after trapping its target; it also allows Trapinch to directly switch into Choice Scarf Magnemite and reliably revenge kill SturdyJuice Magnemite. Eviolite is another good choice to better deal with Knock Off users and avoid a greater variety of OHKOs, in exchange for Berry Juice's longevity. If Eviolite is run, an EV spread of 156 HP / 36 Atk / 76 Def / 236 SpD is preferable to usually avoid the 2HKO from Magnemite's Flash Cannon after Stealth Rock before factoring in Analytic, and the OHKO from Choice Scarf Chinchou's Hydro Pump after a layer of Spikes; the physical bulk to withstand Pawniard is no longer needed, as Eviolite reduces Knock Off's damage. A more offensive EV spread of 156 HP / 196 Atk / 76 Def / 76 SpD with either Berry Juice or Eviolite is viable to 2HKO Ponyta while burned and KO offensive Porygon after Stealth Rock with a combination of Superpower and Quick Attack, but the lower bulk makes it more difficult for Trapinch to trap its other targets; this is one of the few scenarios where Quick Attack's extra power makes it worth using over Feint.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If Trapinch is required to trap more than one Pokemon on the opposing team, it is best to use it as a revenge killer, as Berry Juice will usually allow it to heal back to full health after trapping one target. With Feint, Trapinch can ensure that heavily weakened targets that are affected by Arena Trap are picked off. Do not directly switch Trapinch into Magnemite until you can be sure it is a Choice Scarf variant, has Sturdy broken, or has used up its Berry Juice, as if a healthy SturdyJuice Magnemite hits Trapinch on the switch with Flash Cannon, it will be able to win; however, Trapinch can reliably revenge kill all variants of Magnemite. Ponyta needs to be hit with Knock Off before Trapinch can trap it, and Trapinch will be heavily weakened in the process. Be careful of the opponent taking advantage of Trapinch's predictability and using double switches to gain momentum on predicted Trapinch switch-ins.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Trapinch's niche is its ability to remove key Pokemon such as Focus Sash Abra, Magnemite, Diglett, Gothita, Pawniard, and Croagunk; because of this, Pokemon that appreciate these threats gone like Croagunk, Fletchling, and Foongus enjoy having Trapinch as a teammate. As Trapinch tends to be easily forced out once it has trapped something, teammates such as Foongus and Chinchou that can deal with various Water-, Grass-, and Flying-types are necessary to ensure that it does not become a liability. Paralysis support from the likes of Snubbull and Foongus can make it easier for Trapinch to revenge kill frailer targets. Slow VoltTurn users such as bulky variants of Mienfoo and Chinchou can help to get Trapinch in safely. Entry hazard removal, especially a means to remove Toxic Spikes, can help Trapinch to more consistently avoid specific KOs.</p>"

  "Pumpkaboo-Small": {
    "overview": "<p>As the smallest Pumpkaboo forme, Pumpkaboo-S has higher Speed, but lower HP, than its larger brethren. As a result, Pumpkaboo-S is outclassed in defensive roles, but its higher Speed lets it take on an offensive role more effectively, especially with Sticky Web support. Its low HP can also be used to its advantage, as it can hit 19 HP so it takes only 1 damage from Life Orb recoil. Its Ghost / Grass typing is a mixed bag; it sports four resistances and two immunities, including the ability to block Rapid Spin, but it also has five weaknesses, including an unfortunate weakness to the common Knock Off. Although Pumpkaboo-S does resist several priority moves thanks to its typing, it's weak to a few important ones, namely Fletchling's Acrobatics and Pawniard's Sucker Punch, meaning it will likely be forced out if these Pokemon have not been removed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flame Charge is an option to boost Pumpkaboo-S's Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after one use without Sticky Web support. Explosion allows Pumpkaboo-S to heavily dent or KO a foe once its job is done and also ensures that Fletchling won't be setting up on it. Seed Bomb is an option over Bullet Seed, but Bullet Seed almost always does more damage. Pumpkaboo-S could invest more in Special Attack and run moves such as Shadow Ball, Energy Ball, and Giga Drain, but its Attack stat is higher than its Special Attack, and it should generally stick to physical or mixed attacking. Sludge Bomb can hit Fairy-types such as Cottonee and Spritzee quite hard. Psychic can be used for better coverage against Poison-types such as Croagunk. Flamethrower can be used as a more accurate option over Fire Blast, but the power drop is significant, missing the OHKO on Ferroseed and missing 2HKOs on Foongus and Pumpkaboo-XL. Trick is an option alongside a Choice item to cripple a wall. It works well in tandem with Frisk, as you know what item Pumpkaboo-S will be receiving from the foe. Will-O-Wisp can cripple physical attackers and prevent Pumpkaboo-S from becoming setup bait, but this is generally done better by Pumpkaboo-XL. In fact, Pumpkaboo-S gets a wide array of support options, but any support set is done better by its larger cousin Pumpkaboo-XL.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta can come in on any move from Pumpkaboo-S but Rock Slide and threaten Pumpkaboo-S with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Fletchling and Vullaby heavily threaten Pumpkaboo-S, as they can hit it super effectively and are immune to Sticky Web. Fletchling in particular is the perfect revenge killer for Pumpkaboo-S, as it is immune to Shadow Sneak and can OHKO it with priority Acrobatics. Both must watch out for Rock Slide, however.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Pawniard, Stunky, and Houndour all threaten Pumpkaboo-S with Sucker Punch and can trap it with Pursuit. They must be wary of which coverage move they are switching into, however.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Koffing and Croagunk resist Bullet Seed and can tank most common moves from Pumpkaboo-S. Croagunk, however, must be wary of Fire Blast due to Dry Skin.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Pumpkaboo-S is crippled by all status effects, especially burn and paralysis, as they hamper its offensive potential.</p>",

      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bullet Seed is Pumpkaboo-S's main STAB move. When boosted by Life Orb, it does impressive damage to targets that are hit neutrally and demolishes foes weak to Grass, such as Tirtouga and Chinchou. Fire Blast provides coverage against the Grass- and Steel-types that can wall Bullet Seed, OHKOing Ferroseed after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKOing Foongus, Pumpkaboo-XL, and Pawniard. Shadow Sneak gives Pumpkaboo-S a form of priority, allowing it to pick off weakened faster threats. Rock Slide provides great coverage against Fire-types, especially Larvesta, as well as Flying-types such as Vullaby, Archen, and Fletchling. Keep in mind that Fletchling must be hit on the switch, as its priority Acrobatics will OHKO Pumpkaboo-S before it has a chance to attack. Destiny Bond lets Pumpkaboo-S take a foe down with it as it faints. It's also a useful tool with which to play around Sucker Punch users, which could otherwise OHKO Pumpkaboo-S.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>228 Speed EVs with a neutral nature let Pumpkaboo-S hit 15 Speed. With Sticky Web support, this is enough to outspeed the unboosted metagame as well as 14 Speed Choice Scarf users. Life Orb increases Pumpkaboo-S's damage output. Using 0 HP IVs lowers Pumpkaboo-S's HP to 19, so it only takes 1 damage from Life Orb recoil. The Attack investment alongside a Naughty nature lets Pumpkaboo-S's physical moves hit as hard as possible. A Naive nature may be used to let Pumpkaboo-S hit 16 Speed, allowing it to outspeed 15 and 16 Speed Choice Scarf with Sticky Web support. The remaining EVs give Pumpkaboo-S an extra point in Defense and Special Attack. The ability chosen is Frisk; Insomnia might initially seem more useful, but Pumpkaboo-S is already immune to the only common sleep-inducing moves, Spore and Sleep Powder, and Pickup will rarely be of any use, because most Knock Off users OHKO Pumpkaboo-S anyway. Frisk is much more useful, as it reveals the foe's item and is especially helpful in determining what set the opponent is running on versatile Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Chinchou.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bullet Seed is Pumpkaboo-S's go-to move, as with Life Orb it does great damage against any target it hits neutrally or super effectively and can easily break through Sturdy + Berry Juice users such as Tirtouga. Fire Blast should be used on predicted Grass-type switch-ins; all relevant bulky Grass-types are easily 2HKOed, or OHKOed in the case of Ferroseed. Remember that Pumpkaboo-S is somewhat frail, so it should only switch into Pokemon that can't hurt it much, such as Drilbur. If using Destiny Bond, it can be used to take out a specific threat to your team, allowing another teammate to potentially sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pumpkaboo-S is most effective when paired with a Sticky Web user, as this best takes advantage of its mixed offensive abilities and its ability to spinblock. Surskit is generally the most effective Sticky Web user, but Spinarak and Sewaddle could also be considered. Since Pumpkaboo-S acts as a spinblocker for Sticky Web teams, a teammate that can deter Defog is appreciated, namely Pawniard, as it gains a +2 Attack boost from Defog thanks to Defiant. Pokemon that can provide Knock Off support such as Pawniard, Mienfoo, and Timburr help soften up the opposition for Pumpkaboo-S. Damage rolls for multi-hit moves such as Bullet Seed increase dramatically against foes lacking Eviolite, so Knock Off support is especially important. A teammate that can switch into Fletchling is mandatory, as it heavily threatens Pumpkaboo-S. Archen, Chinchou, and Tirtouga all work well in this role; they can also serve as checks to Fire-types, which also threaten Pumpkaboo-S.</p>"

  "Bergmite": {
    "overview": "<p>Bergmite is one of only two Pokemon in LC with access to both Rapid Spin and a reliable recovery move, granting it a niche as a bulky entry hazard remover. Bergmite has very good physical bulk, allowing it to do well in any physically biased metagame. However, Bergmite has poor Speed and subpar Special Defense, along with mediocre attacking stats. Most unfortunate, though, is Bergmite's pure Ice typing, which makes it vulnerable to every entry hazard it is meant to remove and grants it a 2x weakness to Stealth Rock. Ice is a terrible defensive typing in general, granting Bergmite only one resistance and a plethora of weaknesses. Finally, Bergmite is setup bait due to its low damage output and lack of a good status move.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bergmite can viably run Berry Juice alongside Sturdy, but this is generally unnecessary, as Bergmite already has access to Recover and is also vulnerable to entry hazards, which break Sturdy. Surf can be run over Rock Tomb to OHKO Onix and Numel, but it is inferior to Rock Tomb against any other Pokemon. Stone Edge can also be run over Rock Tomb for an OHKO on Larvesta and for a generally more powerful coverage option. However, the drop in accuracy and utility makes Stone Edge an inferior option most of the time. Mirror Coat can be used to punish special attackers trying to abuse Bergmite's low Special Defense. On a separate note, Bergmite has the makings of a potent Curse sweeper with access to Curse, Recover, and Avalanche. However, it is let down by its typing and poor Special Defense, and it is heavily outclassed by Munchlax.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bergmite is walled completely by any Steel-type and is weak to Steel-type attacks. Common ones, such as Pawniard and Ferroseed, can also set up entry hazards. These two are both particularly troubling, as Ferroseed punishes Rapid Spin due to Iron Barbs and has the bulk to consistently set up entry hazards as they are removed, whereas Pawniard resists both of Bergmite's attacks, even receiving an Attack boost from Rock Tomb, and is immune to Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Bergmite is threatened by Rock-type attacks, especially Rock Blast, which can break through Sturdy. Many common entry hazard setters, such as Onix and Dwebble, carry the move and can set up entry hazards on Bergmite with impunity. However, many Rock-types are also part Ground, meaning Bergmite can threaten them with Avalanche.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types don't particularly fear Avalanche and can hit Bergmite with powerful, super effective STAB attacks. Timburr in particular is irksome due to the Guts boost it receives after being hit by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types demolish Bergmite with STAB Flare Blitz and the likes, but they are hit for super effective damage by Rock Tomb and cannot set entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Bergmite cannot use Rapid Spin against Ghost-types and is very threatened by them, as most Ghost-types are special attackers. Honedge and Frillish are particularly troubling, as they resist Bergmite's Ice-type attacks.</p>",

      "Rapid Spin Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Avalanche provides Bergmite with a STAB attack and is better than Ice Fang due to Bergmite's low Speed. Rapid Spin removes entry hazards and is Bergmite's niche. Recover provides Bergmite with longevity. Rock Tomb has decent neutral coverage with Avalanche, hitting Fire-types, and also provides decent utility by dropping the foe's Speed. Toxic, on the other hand, can put switch-ins such as Fire-type, Fighting-type, and generally bulky Pokemon on a timer, making Bergmite less of setup bait.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs and an Impish nature maximize Bergmite's defenses, particularly bolstering its Defense. Adding another point in HP doesn't do much to help Bergmite survive significant attacks, so the other EVs boost Attack and Speed. Defense is maximized to help check physical spinners such as Drilbur. An alternate spread of 44 Atk / 156 Def / 236 SpD / 52 Spe with a Careful nature lets Bergmite take both physical and special hits and lets it perform much better against special attackers. Eviolite allows Bergmite to survive powerful attacks such as Timburr's Drain Punch and allows Bergmite to make great use of Recover.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bergmite has an unfavorable matchup against Rock- and Steel-type entry hazard setters, such as Dwebble and Ferroseed. Attempting to spin while they are on the field is not advised. On the other hand, Bergmite fares much better against Ground- and Grass-type entry hazard setters, such as Hippopotas, Drilbur, and Chespin. Spinning on them is a much better idea, but be aware of the Rock-type coverage moves these Pokemon often carry. Bergmite also has a good matchup against Flying-types, and it can reliably beat physically attacking ones, such as Fletchling, due to its high Defense and access to a slow Avalanche. Lastly, be wary of using Toxic if the opponent has Timburr, as it may switch in and receive a Guts boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-type Pokemon such as Larvesta and Ponyta are weak to entry hazards and can thus find a great partner in Bergmite. Fire-types can also take on the Steel-types that wall Bergmite, but they will compound a Rock weakness. Bergmite benefits from Fighting-type teammates, such as Croagunk and Pancham, in a similar manner, as they can take care of the Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon that threaten Bergmite. Croagunk is a particularly good teammate, as it can also take on Fighting-types and appreciates Bergmite's ability to get rid of Ground-types. In general, any team that needs a bulky spinner that can take on Grass- or Ground-types will find Bergmite to be a suitable fit.</p>"

  "Noibat": {
    "overview": "<p>Noibat has very bad overall stats. It reaches 16 Speed with a Timid nature, though, which isn't that bad in Little Cup. It has a unique STAB move combination that consists of Draco Meteor and Hurricane and is resisted only by Steel-types, which Noibat can run Heat Wave to hit. It also has access to Tailwind, which is an interesting support move. It has many resistances thanks to its typing that make up for its poor bulk, and it is immune to Ground-type moves. Finally, Infiltrator has a cool niche when it comes to revenge killing Pokemon that are behind a Substitute.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set can be used to increase Noibat's power. Switcheroo would replace Tailwind on such a set; this would help Noibat wallbreak, because special walls don't appreciate their Eviolite being swapped with a Choice Specs. Frisk can be used as well in order to scout the foe's item, but Infiltrator is more helpful overall against Snivy and other Substitute users. U-turn can be a good option to gain momentum, especially on a Choice Specs set, but it is outclassed by Heat Wave, which provides better coverage. Air Slash can be used over Hurricane for more accuracy, although the loss of power is very significant. Choice Scarf can have its niche as well, because it lets Noibat outpace the whole unboosted metagame with 16 Speed and Speed tie with Choice Scarf Chinchou. However, this set lacks the power of a boosting item and is relatively weak.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Bulky Pokemon, such as Porygon, Spritzee, and Munchlax, can easily take Noibat's attacks, recover their HP, and KO Noibat.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Almost any faster Pokemon that has good offensive stats, such as Abra, Gastly, Archen, or Drilbur, is able to OHKO Noibat because of its very poor bulk. Priority move users, such as Fletchling and Snover, are able to OHKO Noibat as well.</p>",

      "Tailwind + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor and Hurricane are two powerful STAB moves with great coverage, being resisted only by Steel-types. Heat Wave hits Steel-types super effectively, giving Noibat perfect coverage that hits every Pokemon in Little Cup neutrally or super effectively. Tailwind provides good support for Noibat's teammates by doubling their Speed for the following three turns.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>236 EVs are invested into Speed in order for Timid Noibat to reach 16 Speed. 236 EVs are put into Special Attack in order to maximize the damage Noibat can deal. Life Orb increases the power of its moves as well. Infiltrator lets Noibat hit through Substitutes. Noibat runs a 9 HP IV in order to minimize the HP lost to Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Noibat can't switch into attacks properly because of its poor bulk, so you should aim to send it out when a Pokemon on your team has just been KOed by a foe slower than Noibat in order to revenge kill it. Then, just deal as much damage as possible, and use Tailwind when Noibat forces a switch or is about to be KOed and there are faster threats in the opposing team that your team needs to outspeed in order to KO.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Noibat appreciates entry hazard support in order to punish switches and pressure the opposing team. Drilbur is particularly good for this role because it also offers Rapid Spin support, which allows Noibat to switch in without taking Stealth Rock damage. Ferroseed can help as well by setting both Stealth Rock and Spikes, but it can't remove entry hazards. Pawniard has good synergy with Noibat, being able to threaten Spritzee and take advantage of Tailwind, especially if using a Life Orb set, while Noibat can deal with Fighting-types Pawniard struggles with. Skrelp is also a nice option, as it can destroy a lot of Pokemon that check Noibat, such as Fairy- and Rock-types, and it greatly enjoys Tailwind support. Other powerful wallbreakers, especially Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Scraggy, greatly appreciate Tailwind support and deal with Munchlax and Porygon. Gothita can deal with bulky Pokemon that Noibat can't, such as Spritzee, Munchlax, and Porygon.</p>"

  "Piplup": {
    "overview": "<p>Piplup is one of only a handful of Pokemon in Little Cup with access to both Stealth Rock and Defog, meaning it can remove your opponent's entry hazards while setting up its own. Piplup's Water typing means it isn't weak to Stealth Rock, so it can switch in more easily than other Defoggers, especially along with its good defenses. Piplup is no slouch offensively either, as its good Special Attack stat along with a decent STAB move in Scald means it can beat common Stealth Rock users such as Drilbur and Archen. However, it has less offensive presence than these two and access to less special attacking options, which means it can sometimes become setup bait for Pokemon that are specially bulky or resist Piplup's moves. Piplup is also outclassed in other roles by Chinchou, so it can be quite predictable.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Piplup can use Hydro Pump over Scald; however, Hydro Pump's inability to inflict a burn and lower accuracy make it a less viable choice than Scald. Piplup can also use Brick Break in order to take on Pawniard and Magnemite, and it's also able to use Signal Beam in order to take on Carvanha; however, neither of these options hit much aside from the Pokemon listed. Toxic and Yawn are options to spread status and force switches, but Piplup is better off trying to spread burns with Scald. Defiant isn't legal with Defog, but Piplup has a decent Attack stat and a number of reasonably strong physical options, meaning it can switch in on a Defog or Sticky Web and hit fairly hard; however, Tirtouga and Corphish outclass it as a Water-type physical attacker.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Even after taking damage from Stealth Rock, Cottonee, Ferroseed, Pumpkaboo, and Foongus can all comfortably tank an Ice Beam and severely cripple Piplup with a super effective STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Purrloin, and Cottonee are all capable of preventing Piplup from setting up Stealth Rock or using Defog with Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Chinchou can tank any of Piplup's attacks and hit back with a powerful Electric-type attack. Magnemite can also nail Piplup with an Electric-type attack, though it will have trouble switching in.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Piplup is highly susceptible to residual damage, as entry hazards and damage from attacks can wear it down quickly.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stealth Rock + Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock and Defog are moves that allow Piplup to employ entry hazard control. Piplup's Stealth Rock will wear down opposing Pokemon and break the Sturdy of Pokemon such as Tirtouga and Magnemite, allowing its teammates to push past foes more easily. Defog removes all entry hazards, allowing Piplup's teammates to avoid taking residual damage. Piplup's STAB Scald has a chance to burn foes, meaning it will be able to set up or remove entry hazards more easily. Ice Beam hits foes such as Fletchling and Foongus, and has good coverage with Scald; however, it fails to 2HKO most Grass-type Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Bold nature and the EVs listed maximize Piplup's bulk and allow it to reach Eviolite numbers, letting it both withstand hits and take on most entry hazard setters. Torrent is the only ability legal with Defog, boosting Piplup's Water-type attacks when it's below one-third of its maximum health. Although it's situational, the boost in power is useful.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Piplup is bulky enough to be switched directly in on attacks, but its lack of recovery means you should not do so unless removing or setting entry hazards is necessary; thus, Piplup should be brought in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch wherever possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock really appreciate having Piplup as a teammate. Fletchling, Archen, Taillow, Larvesta, Ponyta, and Sturdy users such as Magnemite and Tirtouga benefit greatly from an absence of entry hazards on the field. Piplup can't push past bulky Grass-types such as Foongus, Pumpkaboo, and Ferroseed, so it will need support from teammates such as Ponyta, Larvesta, and Fletchling in order to beat them. Incidentally, all of these Pokemon are weak to Stealth Rock and appreciate Piplup removing them through Defog. Piplup can also take care of the Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon that threaten these teammates, while they can switch into the Grass-type moves that threaten Piplup. Chinchou also makes for a good teammate; while both it and Piplup are weak to Grass-type attacks, Chinchou can come into Electric-type attacks from Magnemite and opposing Chinchou. A cleric such as Spritzee or Lickitung can pass some hefty Wishes to Piplup, enabling it to perform its role much more effectively.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Bulbasaur returns for another round of LC as one of the strongest sun sweepers in the metagame alongside Bellsprout and Oddish. However, it stands out from these two, as it is the fastest Chlorophyll sweeper in LC and has more bulk than Bellsprout. It also has access to Growth, giving it an edge over Oddish. However, despite being bulkier than other Chlorophyll sweepers, its bulk is still relatively low, making it difficult to switch it in. Generation VI brought with it changes in weather, leaving Bulbasaur a drastically limited amount of time in which it can sweep. However, it still has the bulk and power to pull off incredible feats and tear through enemy teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A defensive set with Synthesis, Leech Seed, Sleep Powder, and a STAB move, like Sludge Bomb or Giga Drain, would be threatening, but it is easily walled by Grass- or Steel-types. A Choice Scarf set can be used out of the sun, but it lacks power and is inferior to most other Pokemon that commonly run Choice Scarf.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Vulpix is a solid good counter to Bulbasaur, taking little damage from Solar Beam or Hidden Power Fire. Even Sludge Bomb deals little damage. However, Sleep Powder can provide Bulbasaur with an opportunity to whittle Vulpix's health down. Other Fire-types, such as Larvesta, Ponyta, and Growlithe, are also good walls to Bulbasaur, especially when one of their allies has been put to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Vullaby with Overcoat takes little damage from any attacks and can't be put to sleep. It can also hit hard with Brave Bird. RestTalk Munchlax is barely affected Bulbasaur's attacks as well as Sleep Powder. Koffing can take any hit from Bulbasaur after Sleep Powder has been used and can OHKO with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Snover can switch in on Sleep Powder, removing the sun and replacing it with hail. If it has a Choice Scarf, it can also deal a good amount of damage back to Bulbasaur. Hippopotas only fears being hit by Giga Drain, but also changes the weather to sandstorm, stopping Bulbasaur's sun sweep.</p> <p><strong>Fletchling</strong>: With a priority Acrobatics, Fletchling can easily revenge kill any Chlorophyll sweeper set that Bulbasaur might run.</p>",

      "Life Orb Sun Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sludge Bomb is a powerful STAB move with a 30% chance to poison the enemy, which helps to get through Fairy- and Grass-type Pokemon. Solar Beam is an incredible STAB move, as it takes only one turn to charge in the sun and hits Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types super effectively. Giga Drain can be used over Solar Beam, as it doesn't rely on the sun to charge up. A sun-boosted Hidden Power Fire helps Bulbasaur get around Steel-types that would otherwise wall it, as well as just providing it with all-around coverage. Even after all this, there still are Pokemon that Bulbasaur has a hard time tearing through. Sleep Powder allows Bulbasaur to cripple these Pokemon, so that it can have a couple turns to defeat them.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximizing Speed and Special Attack EVs allows Bulbasaur to be as big a threat as possible. The IV changes account for Hidden Power Fire and minimize recoil damage dealt by Life Orb. A Life Orb helps Bulbasaur deal significantly more damage. With a Modest nature, Bulbasaur Speed ties with Timid Bellsprout. However, Bulbasaur does end up being more powerful than Bellsprout.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bulbasaur is fairly simple to use. Switch into Vulpix to set up the sun, then wait for the optimal opportunity for Bulbasaur to come in. Bulbasaur's decent special bulk allows it to switch in on special attacks better than physical attacks, so take that into account when preparing to switch. Water-type moves are the best to switch into, because in the sun they deal little damage to Bulbasaur. Once in battle, use Bulbasaur's strongest moves against the Pokemon that it's matched against. If you know that can't OHKO the opponent or that Bulbasaur can't survive one of that Pokemon's attacks, cripple it with Sleep Powder.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vulpix is an obvious choice for a partner, as Drought lets it automatically set up sun upon switching in. If Vulpix has a Heat Rock, that's even better, as it means that the sun will last longer and Bulbasaur will benefit more from Chlorophyll. Bulbasaur pairs well with other Chlorophyll sweepers, as they also benefit from the sun and can break through walls, allowing Bulbasaur to clean up late-game. Flying-types, especially Fletchling, are a huge threat to Bulbasaur, so Pokemon like Chinchou and Archen are extremely useful. Bulbasaur has trouble safely switching in, so Pokemon that can provide a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Chinchou, are extremely useful.</p>"

      "Eviolite Growth": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Growth boosts Bulbasaur's Special Attack two stages, bringing it up to 32 Special Attack, making Bulbasaur an extremely dangerous sweeper in the sun. Sleep Powder gives Bulbasaur a chance to use Growth as well as provide a means to get through bulkier Pokemon. Giga Drain allows Bulbasaur to continue to be a threat out of the sun, as Growth will still have left it with +2 Special Attack. Hidden Power Fire helps Bulbasaur get past Steel- and Grass-types, while Sludge Bomb hits Grass-types harder but is walled by Steel Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This EV spread maximizes Speed and Special Attack while taking into account the IVs lost because of Hidden Power Fire. A Timid nature hits 15 Speed, allowing Bulbasaur to outspeed or Speed tie with all Choice Scarf threats when in the sun. This nature also allows it to outspeed opposing sun sweepers, such as Bellsprout. Eviolite gives Bulbasaur more opportunities to switch in and set up Growth and can allow the sweep to continue outside the sun.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because of Eviolite, Bulbasaur doesn't have as much of a problem switching in with this set. However, it's still beneficial to try to switch into a neutral or resisted hit so as to take as little damage as possible. Sleep Powder should be saved for a Pokemon that Bulbasaur can't easily take down. Once the opposing Pokemon is asleep, use Growth as the enemy either switches that Pokemon out or wastes the turn staying in. From there, Bulbasaur should attempt to punch as many holes in the enemy team as it can. Because only one Pokemon can be asleep at a time, avoid putting Pokemon to sleep that could have been OHKOed instead. Try to remove opposing Fire-type Pokemon before setting up sun. Fire-types tend to be able to wall Chlorophyll sweepers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vulpix is the best choice for a teammate, as it automatically starts sun upon switching in. Heat Rock on Vulpix is nice, as it gives Bulbasaur more time to set up and sweep. This set has trouble with Fire-types such as Ponyta and Vulpix, so Pokemon that counter them are appreciated. Archen or Diglett are both useful for this function. Stealth Rock also minimizes the effect that they have on Bulbasaur's sweep. Archen is especially useful, as it also takes care of Fletchling and other Flying-type Pokemon. Chinchou can stop Fire-types and Flying-types well.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Squirtle's primary role on a team is to remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin, but it is outclassed in many ways by Staryu. There are reasons to use Squirtle, however, because of its access to priority moves such as Aqua Jet and Fake Out, better bulk, and the ability to Rapid Spin on Ghost-types thanks to Foresight. Unfortunately, Squirtle has poor Attack and Speed stats so it's typically delegated to being used on more defensive teams, but its lack of recovery hinders it on such team archetypes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Squirtle has many physical coverage options such as Brick Break, Bite, and Zen Headbutt, but they are rather weak and Squirtle will often lose to the intended target anyway. Squirtle could use a special set with Scald, Ice Beam, and Aura Sphere, but then Squirtle's biggest niche of having priority moves is gone. Choice Scarf Squirtle with Water Spout has potential, but is outclassed by other users such as Remoraid and Frillish. You could equip Squirtle with a Life Orb to spam hard-hitting priority moves, but Seel is better in this regard. Haze would allow Squirtle to not become setup bait, but most setup sweepers will beat Squirtle anyway. Toxic can be used to hinder walls that Squirtle couldn't otherwise due to its poor offensive stats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Pumpkaboo and Frillish are good answers to Squirtle. They block Rapid Spin and can Recover off any damage Squirtle does to them.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Chinchou all threaten to do huge damage to Squirtle.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Ice Punch is very weak and Grass-types can beat Squirtle even after switching in on it. Ferroseed and Foongus are the most problematic of these.</p> <p><strong>Dry Skin, Storm Drain, and Water Absorb Users</strong>: Squirtle's non-STAB attacks will do negligible damage to Pokemon immune to Water and they will be able to whittle it down in return. Mantyke in particular doesn't care about Squirtle.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Squirtle is completely walled by the opposing Water-types and almost every one can beat Squirtle, due to Squirtle's terrible offensive stats and lack of recovery.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Any sweeper that doesn't mind Waterfall or Ice Punch can freely set up and wreak havoc on Squirtle and its team.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Squirtle will be easily worn down and generally wont be able to do much back to generally bulky Pokemon, such as Porygon and Spritzee.</p>",

      "Rapid Spinner": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin is Squirtle's niche that enables it to clear away opposing entry hazards. Fake Out is important for free chip damage while Waterfall is the STAB move of choice. Ice Punch can be used to hit the majority of Grass-types in the tier, particularly Pumpkaboo, which blocks Rapid Spin. Ice Punch is very weak, however, so Squirtle can forgo it for additional priority in Aqua Jet, which lets Squirtle revenge kill and deal additional chip damage before fainting. Foresight allows Rapid Spin to hit Ghost-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Torrent is the ability of choice, which boosts Squirtle's power when at low HP. The shown EV spread reaches even numbers, which are the optimal numbers to use with an Eviolite. The Speed EVs also allow Squirtle to outspeed many Ghost-types in the tier, especially Honedge and Pumpkaboo-XL, which would want to block Rapid Spin. Squirtle has great bulk and will often have to take a Knock Off to Rapid Spin, so Eviolite is preferred; however, Squirtle does lack recovery, so Berry Juice could potentially be useful.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Squirtle has no recovery, so it's easily worn down. You can avoid this by only switching in when necessary. The most important times to switch Squirtle in are when you need to clear entry hazards or revenge kill with priority. Additionally, using Fake Out on a burned or poisoned target allows for more free damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Anything that appreciates the removal of entry hazards loves having Squirtle as a teammate. Fire- and Flying-types such as Larvesta and Doduo also cover Squirtle's Grass-type weakness, while Squirtle can beat the Ground- or Rock-types that threaten them. Squirtle also works well with Toxic Spikes because you can rack up a lot of free damage after Fake Out and poison damage. If you're not using Toxic Spikes, Staryu will almost always be the better choice. Grass-types cover Squirtle's weaknesses to Grass and Electric. Cottonee is a particularly good teammate because it also dissuades sweepers that would want to set up on Squirtle.</p>"

It is faster than most Normal-type attackers such as Aipom, Bunnelby, Buneary, and Zigzagoon and can deal good damage to targets that don't resist its moves when in the right conditions. However, it still faces a lot of competition from other Normal-types and is forced to rely on Hustle in order to deal large amounts of damage, which causes all of its attacks to lose 20 percent of their initial accuracy. It also has very low bulk, leaving it susceptible to strong priority attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rattata can be used as a Baton Pass recipient of Hone Claws Torchic; however, Darumaka and Deino are more suited for such roles. Choice Scarf allows Rattata to perform better against faster foes, but then Rattata misses out on a lot of power that it normally would wield. Wild Charge can be used to hit bulky Flying- and Water-types such as Archen, Frillish, and Omanyte. Zen Headbutt hits Fighting-types harder, but it is largely unnecessary because STAB Normal-type attacks already do this well enough. Iron Tail is the only move that Rattata can use to hit Rock-type Pokemon for solid damage, but it has a staggering 60% accuracy when Hustle is applied, making it very unreliable. Guts might seem like a good option, but Guts Rattata doesn't offer enough advantages over other attackers with Guts.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Pokemon with naturally higher Speed stats such as Abra and priority move users such as Fletchling can easily take advantage of Rattata's nonexistent bulk and inflict large amounts of damage on it, if not outright KOing it.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon</strong>: Rock-type Pokemon such as Archen, Onix, Tirtouga, Omanyte, and Dwebble are capable of stopping Rattata dead in its tracks, as it has no moves to hit these Pokemon well enough; the latter three are particularly deadly, as they can use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon such as Pawniard, Magnemite, and Honedge need to wary of Flame Wheel when switching in or when in KO range, but most can check Rattata, as they are able to take at least one hit; additionally, Pawniard can KO Rattata with Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Pancham, Timburr, Scraggy, and Croagunk can all check Rattata but ultimately can't switch into attacks comfortably. Timburr and Croagunk in particular can KO Rattata with a super effective Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status ailments, paralysis and burns in particular, cause Rattata to lose most of its effectiveness during the course of a battle, as the former cuts its Speed and hinders its ability to hit its targets and the latter cuts its damage output by half, which cripples most sweepers.

      "Hustle": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Double-Edge is Rattata's main attacking move and is necessary for picking up all of the OHKOs or 2HKOs it needs. Return, while less powerful than Double-Edge, doesn't have recoil. Sucker Punch helps mitigate Rattata's susceptibility to revenge killing and hits Ghost-types such as Gastly. Crunch is another option that hits Ghost-types without them having to attack, so it is helpful for catching Pokemon such as Pumpkaboo on the switch for massive damage. Flame Wheel is Rattata's only move for hitting Steel-types and is able to OHKO Ferroseed after Stealth Rock. U-turn maintains offensive momentum and gets chip damage on counters, while Quick Attack is another priority move useful for finishing off weakened foes. Quick Attack should only rarely be used with Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb and Hustle are important to make sure the set manages to deal enough damage towards its foes; otherwise, there is very little reason to use Rattata. The EVs are optimized to hit a Speed stat of 17 and to have as much attacking power as possible. The other EVs are put into Defense to help take most priority attacks better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rattata should never be switching into an attack, as it is simply too frail to survive a hit comfortably, and it should rely on its teammates to bring it in through slow pivoting moves such as Volt Switch and U-turn. Attacking is only worth it if there is a good chance of knocking out what is in front of Rattata. Rattata is easily worn down by entry hazards and Life Orb recoil, especially alongside the use of Double-Edge, so keeping it alive and healthy before it knocks itself out is important.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Archen and Drilbur are useful for picking up KOs that Rattata normally wouldn't; Archen further is notable for having both a usable offensive presence and the ability to switch into Fletchling. Users of Volt Switch and U-turn such as Chinchou, Magnemite, and Larvesta are useful for safely bringing Rattata onto the field without it having to take damage. Snubbull is notable for being a good partner to Rattata because of its ability to switch into common Fighting-types bar Croagunk. Timburr and Abra can revenge kill setup sweepers such as Omanyte and Dwebble, which threaten Rattata. Users of Knock Off such as Timburr, Croagunk, Archen, and Abra lure in defensive walls and remove their Eviolite, making them easier for Rattata to take on.</p>"

  "Spearow": {
    "overview": "<p>Spearow does not excel at much, but carves out a niche by having an option to heavily damage Rock- and Steel-types in Drill Run, while other Flying-types such as Taillow and Fletchling cannot deal as much damage with their coverage moves. Spearow also has decent Speed and Attack, alongside an alright movepool, but that is where the positives end.</p> <p>Spearow's typing doesn't really help it offensively. It also leaves it with very few resistances and weaknesses to Ice-, Electric-, and Rock-type moves, compounded by being extremely frail. Spearow also has a mediocre ability in Sniper that doesn't provide much usefulness. Spearow is also weak to Stealth Rock, which means it has limited switch-in opportunities and when paired with Life Orb and Double-Edge recoil, Spearow will be worn down very easily. Spearow is almost completely outclassed by Pokemon such as Doduo, Fletchling, Taillow, or even Starly, as they have better Attack, better Speed, and have better abilities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heat Wave allows Spearow to OHKO Ferroseed after Stealth Rock. If you opt to use Heat Wave, it is recommended that you use a spread of 196 Atk / 188 SpA / 116 Spe to maximize Spearow's offenses. However, Drill Run has better power and coverage, and Spearow has quite low Special Attack. Roost can be used to provide reliable recovery for Spearow, but it isn't very good because Spearow is very frail. Tailwind can be used as a support move that can help teammates to get a Speed boost, but the effect is only temporary and Spearow is too frail to set it up in most situations.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Like most other physical attackers, any form of status will bring Spearow to its end, because Toxic poison deals increased damage every turn, paralysis leaves Spearow outsped by almost every Pokemon in the tier, allowing foes to KO it slightly easy because of its frailty, and burn makes all of its moves weak, making it unable to break walls.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Archen and Tirtouga can take any hit Spearow throws at them and then proceed to OHKO Spearow with one of their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Pawniard, Choice Scarf Magnemite, and Ferroseed can usually take a hit from Spearow and cripple it with one of their moves after, though the former two need to be wary of Drill Run.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Elekid and Blitzle can outspeed Spearow and beat it with their STAB attacks, though they cannot reliably switch in at all.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: As Stealth Rock removes 1/4 of Spearow's health when it comes in, its switch-ins will be limited, allowing members of the opposing team to pick it off with an attack.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Priority Moves</strong>: Any powerful priority move, such as Fletchling's Acrobatics or Pawniard's Sucker Punch, can take out Spearow because it is extremely frail.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon, such as Abra or Archen, can outspeed Spearow and, in most situations, OHKO Spearow directly.</p>",

      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Double-Edge is Spearow's most powerful STAB attack, but it inflicts recoil damage on Spearow after use. Drill Peck is another good STAB attack that provides super effective coverage against Grass- and Fighting-types. U-turn allows Spearow to keep up momentum for its team and switch out of its checks and counters while dealing chip damage. Drill Run is used ito hit Electric-, Rock-, and Steel-types for super effective damage, as the latter two types resist all other STAB. However, all Electric-types other than Magnemite are hit harder by Double-Edge.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sniper is the preferred ability, as Spearow doesn't have a better ability to use; the ability has decent synergy with Drill Run to attempt to land critical hits. Life Orb powers up Spearow's moves, but gives a tiny bit of recoil damage. The IVs in HP lower Spearow's HP to an amount where the Life Orb recoil only takes off one point of HP and also allow Spearow to switch into Stealth Rock for 5 times at most. The investment in Attack lets Spearow hit as hard as possible, while the EVs in both defenses give a tiny boost to Spearow's bad bulk. The investment in Speed is backed up by a Jolly nature, allowing Spearow to Speed tie with Drilbur and Mienfoo.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Make sure to not recklessly switch in Spearow, as it's extremely frail, and with Stealth Rock up, Spearow will take damage every time it switches in, wearing it down quite easily. U-turn out when you predict that a check or counter to Spearow will switch in, as you can switch to another Pokemon that can proceed to beat that threat; the move also helps to keep momentum for the team. Spearow can, however, be switched in to outspeed and revenge kill a Pokemon, but this should be done carefully, as Spearow is frail.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnemite is a good teammate in particular, as it covers all of Spearow's weaknesses. In return, Spearow beats the Fighting-types that trouble Magnemite while being immune to Ground. Cleric support from Pokemon such as Spritzee and Snubbull is quite useful, as status cripples Spearow. Rapid Spin or Defog users such as Drilbur or Vullaby make for pretty good teammates too, as they can remove Stealth Rock, which troubles Spearow. Pokemon that can take care of Rock-types reliably, such as Pawniard and Mienfoo, make good teammates too. Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock, such as Drilbur or Ferroseed, help Spearow get a KO more easily. Knock Off users such as Pawniard and Mienfoo can weaken the foe by removing their item while dealing damage and also help Spearow to pick off foes. Ground-types that beat the Electric-types that trouble Spearow, such as Diglett and Hippopotas, are good teammates as well, especially Diglett, as it traps and beats the Pokemon that trouble Spearow after it U-turns out. Other U-turn or Volt Switch users can form the VoltTurn combination with Spearow and are therefore good partners too, especially slow ones like Chinchou, as they can grant Spearow a safe switch in.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Although it is outclassed defensively by most other Poison-type Pokemon, Ekans has an expansive and rather unique movepool, which includes the rare Coil and Glare, as well as a larger offensive presence after boosts. Its typing grants it nice resistances to Fighting-, Fairy-, and Poison-type moves and Shed Skin is a fantastic counter to common status ailments. However, without a Coil boost, Ekans has disappointing stats and a mediocre offensive presence which can make it easy to play around.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A utility set is mostly outclassed by Pokemon such as Cottonee, but is usable due to Ekans's access to unique moves in Glare, Disable, and Haze. By nature of its Poison typing, Ekans has access to a perfectly accurate Toxic; however, the paralysis from Glare is generally more useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Abra</strong>: Abra can set up a Substitute on a predicted Sucker Punch and subsequently decimate Ekans with its powerful Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Archen</strong>: Archen resists Gunk Shot, is immune to Earthquake, and can usually shrug off a Sucker Punch. It can also hit it back with Earthquake and heal up with Roost and/or Berry Juice.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Drilbur and Diglett are able to take Ekans out with STAB Ground-type attacks, and the latter traps it as well. However, they tend to be prone to Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Hippopotas and Foongus easily shrug off most hits thrown at them.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types are immune to Ekans's STAB moves, but are usually hit hard by Earthquake. However, Levitate Bronzor and Ferroseed are quite problematic.</p> <p><strong>Phazing</strong>: Phazing, while uncommon, can be used by the likes of Munchlax and Hippopotas to make all Ekans's efforts go to waste.</p>",

      "Coil Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Besides Snivy, Ekans is the only Pokemon in Little Cup that can use Coil, which boosts its Attack, Defense, and accuracy in one turn. Gunk Shot's accuracy was buffed this generation, which puts it at 100% accuracy after one Coil boost. Earthquake smacks Steel-types such as Pawniard and Magnemite, which would otherwise wall Ekans's STAB moves with their Poison-type immunities. Sucker Punch hits Gastly and Psychic-types hard, but common moves such as Substitute and Will-O-Wisp can circumvent this. As such, Bite can be used instead. Glare can also be used in the last slot to cripple faster threats, hitting Ground- and Grass-types with 100% accuracy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread grants Ekans 22 / 12 / 16 bulk, which is further boosted by Eviolite. Intimidate can force switches and Shed Skin removes bothersome status ailments such as paralysis and burn. Berry Juice is used to sustain Ekans's longevity, as it will be switching in and out throughout the match to make good use of Intimidate. Eviolite can be used instead for the added defenses and ability to contend against Pawniard, a common Ekans switch-in. A Careful nature is preferred to increase Ekans's special bulk, as Coil only affects Ekans's Defense stat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ekans can easily switch into a Fighting-type move and Intimidate the foe, then proceed to use Coil as the opposing Pokemon switches out or attempts to hit Ekans. An attacking move can also be used to nail a switch-in for solid damage, so make sure you are selecting your move accordingly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ekans's ability to take out Fairy-types is a valuable asset to the plethora of Fighting-types in the tier, such as Mienfoo and Scraggy. Water-types such as Staryu and Slowpoke can defeat Ground-types, which can cause some problems for Ekans and prevent it from boosting with Coil. Wish support from Pokemon such as Lickitung and Spritzee is very beneficial, and Ekans can take Fighting- and Poison-type moves aimed at these Wish passers, respectively.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Sandshrew has good physical bulk and Attack, along with access to Rapid Spin and Knock Off, both of which are fantastic support moves. However, besides its superior Defense stat and access to Knock Off, Sandshrew is mostly outclassed by Drilbur, which has mostly superior stats and a better ability in Mold Breaker. Sandshrew is also easily worn down due to its lack of recovery and mediocre base 30 Special Defense. Also, due to the removal of permanent weather, Sandshrew loses its previous niche as a sand sweeper, limiting its capabilities to that of a defensive support Pokemon. Although Sandshrew is outclassed in quite a few areas, it is still a solid choice on any bulky balance team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to Sandshrew's already-impressive bulk, Eviolite can be opted out for Berry Juice, providing Sandshrew with a form of recovery; however, Sandshrew's subsequent lack of special bulk is quite noticeable, and its ability to soak up hits is diminished quite a bit. RestTalk is Eviolite Sandshrew's only reliable method of recovery, but Sandshrew lacks the resistances to properly take advantage of such a set. A fully offensive Sand Rush set can be utilized in tandem with Hippopotas, allowing Sandshrew to utilize its good Attack stat and coverage moves to sweep an opposing team. Sand Veil is an option should Sandshrew's potential Speed boost with Sand Rush not be sufficient, letting Sandshrew occasionally dodge an incoming hit while sand is up. Rock Tomb can be used over Rock Slide, allowing Sandshrew to better follow up on certain switch-ins; however, Rock Tomb fails to OHKO Fletchling after Stealth Rock. Sandshrew can make good use of a Swords Dance set, OHKOing Pumpkaboo with Knock Off at +2. Poison Jab is a solid means of dealing with Fairy-types, notably Cottonee, and spreading poison around the opposing team. Sandshrew can utilize Counter thanks to its fantastic physical bulk, but the move usually ends up wasting a moveslot and is a gimmick more than anything else.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Gastly and Pumpkaboo can switch into an Earthquake or Rapid Spin with ease; however, none of them want to take a Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers such as Abra and Omanyte can easily KO Sandshrew with Energy Ball and Hydro Pump, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types resist Sandshrew's Earthquake; furthermore, as most Grass-types are special attackers, they can KO Sandshrew with Giga Drain or Energy Ball.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Although most Water-types don't resist Sandshrew's Earthquake, many of them are specially-oriented and so are able to KO Sandshrew with Scald, Surf, or Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: Burn renders Sandshrew almost useless outside of being a utility Pokemon, halving its Attack stat; it also lacks recovery, so the chip damage from burn is quite threatening.</p> <p><strong>Hazard Removers</strong>: Defog and Rapid Spin users, such as Vullaby, Staryu, and Drilbur, can usually cause some trouble for Sandshrew, being able to remove its Stealth Rock with ease; Staryu in particular can be an issue for Sandshrew, as it is able to KO it in addition to removing hazards.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin allows Sandshrew to aid its teammates by removing hazards. Earthquake is Sandshrew's STAB move of choice, hitting a lot of Pokemon quite hard. Knock Off is a great utility option, hitting Ghost-types that try to spinblock, notably Pumpkaboo, a Pokemon that Drilbur cannot heavily damage. It also removes opposing Eviolites, Choice Scarves, and Berry Juices, making walls and sweepers easier to deal with. Stealth Rock is a fantastic move; Sandshrew's more offensive teammates can benefit from foes being weakened by it. Rock Slide can be used over Stealth Rock if your team already has a hazard setter, allowing Sandshrew to hit Larvesta, Flying-types, and Ice-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs provide Sandshrew with lots of bulk, hitting 23 / 18 / 10 before Eviolite, with the remaining EVs being invested in Attack and Speed, hitting 16 Attack and 11 Speed, to let Sandshrew outspeed Pokemon such as Timburr and Pumpkaboo. Eviolite boosts Sandshrew's bulk and works well with the EVs, which make Sandshrew's Defense and Special Defense even numbers. Sandshrew's abilities rather contradict its role, but if the opponent uses a sand team, Sandshrew becomes blisteringly fast thanks to Sand Rush.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sandshrew's impressive Defense stat allows it to switch into a majority of non-super effective physical moves; take advantage of this by setting up Stealth Rock or removing hazards with Rapid Spin while the foe switches out. If Stealth Rock is used over Rock Slide, be wary of Fletchling, as it is immune to Earthquake and lacks an item, weakening Knock Off's power. Although Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin are great moves, they make Sandshrew rather predictable, as it'll either lead or switch in shortly after the opponent sets hazards; be sure to play smartly with Sandshrew, for example nailing the obvious Pumpkaboo switch-in with a Knock Off as opposed to simply using Rapid Spin.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sandshrew pairs well with Fire-, Flying-, and Bug-types, as it can remove Stealth Rock from the field. Spikes users, such as Trubbish and Ferroseed, can partner with Sandshrew to form an effective hazard-setting core. Ferroseed, in particular, can handle the Water- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Sandshrew. Pumpkaboo can spinblock, keeping Sandshrew's Stealth Rock on the field; it also resists Water- and Grass-types attacks aimed at Sandshrew. Pawniard deters Defog users, as its ability, Defiant, gives it a large Attack boost when hit by Defog. Clerics such as Spritzee and Lickitung can compensate for Sandshrew's lack of recovery, providing it with Wish and Heal Bell / Aromatherapy support. RestTalk Munchlax can handle Foongus and special Water-types, all while absorbing status, particularly burn, that Sandshrew doesn't appreciate.</p>"

  "Nidoran-M": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoran-M is a fairly powerful physical attacker thanks to both its ability, Hustle, and its access to Hone Claws, which offsets Hustle's accuracy drop while further boosting Nidoran-M's Attack. Nidoran-M also has access to great coverage options such as Drill Run and Head Smash, which complement its Poison STAB type. It also has access to Sucker Punch, a powerful priority attack that both provides additional coverage and helps remedy Nidoran-M's middling Speed. Unfortunately, Nidoran-M has mediocre defenses, requiring it to run Eviolite in the hopes of actually setting up with Hone Claws. Its Poison STAB type is also subpar, as it has decent neutral coverage but only notably hits Grass- and Fairy-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nidoran-M has access to Head Smash, a powerful Rock-type coverage move that KOes Archen and Gastly. However, Sucker Punch is generally preferred, as it helps mitigate Nidoran-M's middling Speed. Nidoran-M can hit 14 Speed and has access to powerful physical attacks boosted by Hustle; these qualities practically scream Choice Scarf, and Nidoran-M is no exception. A Choice Scarf set would include Poison Jab, Drill Run, Head Smash, and one of Double Kick or Shadow Claw, with an EV spread of 220 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SpD / 196 Spe and an Adamant nature. Double Kick is an interesting option, as it allows Nidoran-M to OHKO Pawniard unboosted and Ferroseed at +1 with just a bit of prior damage. However, running the move means Nidoran-M loses out on other, more valuable coverage or priority moves. You can forgo Eviolite and instead run a Life Orb to increase Nidoran-M's damage output to an impressive level. If you choose to do so, remember to lower Nidoran-M's HP IV to 7 to hit a Life Orb number. However, if it runs a Life Orb, Nidoran-M has a much more difficult time setting up a Hone Claws. Lastly, Nidoran-M has access to the somewhat rare Toxic Spikes, allowing it to function as an entry hazard setter. However, it is ridiculously outclassed in this role by Pokemon such as Trubbish, Skrelp, and Spinarak.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon</strong>: Ground-types resist Nidoran-M's Poison STAB type and are not hit super effectively by any of its coverage moves. They can then retaliate with super effective Ground-type STAB attacks, which will cripple or outright KO the frail Nidoran-M. Drilbur, the most prominent Ground-type in LC, also outspeeds Nidoran-M, forcing it to rely on Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon</strong>: Psychic-type Pokemon can deal heavy damage to Nidoran-M with their super effective STAB moves, but they don't resist Poison and are weak to Sucker Punch. However, the most prominent Psychic-type Pokemon, Abra, often runs Focus Sash, which will prevent even Sucker Punch from KOing.</p> <p><strong>Archen</strong>: Archen can easily survive a +1 Hustle Sucker Punch, resists Poison / Ground coverage, and often carries Earthquake as coverage. All of these traits make Archen very threatening to Nidoran-M unless it elects to run Head Smash.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Any generally bulky Pokemon such as Koffing or Vullaby can take a +1 Poison Jab and retaliate. Koffing is especially dangerous to Nidoran-M, as it is immune to Nidoran-M's Ground-type coverage thanks to Levitate and can threaten with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon</strong>: Most Ghost-type Pokemon can bypass Sucker Punch with a status move such as Will-O-Wisp. These include Frillish, Substitute Gastly, and Pumpkaboo-XL, though Pumpkaboo is slower than Nidoran-M and will thus have to take a Poison Jab before retaliating.</p> <p><strong>Fast Pokemon that Resist Dark</strong>: Any Pokemon faster than Nidoran-M that isn't scared of Sucker Punch can take advantage of Nidoran-M's middling Speed and hit it hard. These threats include Houndour and Choice Scarf Scraggy.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Hone Claws": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Poison Jab is Nidoran-M's strongest STAB attack, and is its main attacking move. Drill Run provides great coverage, hitting the Steel-, Rock-, and Poison-types that resist Poison Jab for super effective damage. However, Poison / Ground coverage misses out on a few prominent Pokemon, such as Archen and Gastly. Sucker Punch gives Nidoran-M valuable priority and also provides great coverage with Poison Jab by hitting Ghost-types super effectively. Finally, Hone Claws boosts Nidoran-M's Attack even further while also offsetting Hustle's accuracy drop.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>220 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature maximize Nidoran-M's Attack, allowing it to make good use of Hustle and Hone Claws. With 196 Speed EVs, Nidoran-M outspeeds standard Fletchling, allowing it to outprioritize Fletchling via Sucker Punch. If Nidoran-M is running a Jolly nature, it will also outspeed non-Choice Scarf variants of Chinchou and other 14 Speed Pokemon. The remaining EVs give an extra point in each defense, increasing Nidoran-M's bulk. Eviolite also functions to bolster Nidoran-M's defenses, giving it more opportunities to set up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Nidoran-M is still frail even with Eviolite and has no recovery, so only try to set it up against Pokemon that don't threaten it, such as Spritzee. If you can't seem to find a Pokemon to set up on, remember that Nidoran-M's Attack is already quite good before Hone Claws due to Hustle, so it isn't always necessary to set up. It is also a decent revenge killer thanks to Sucker Punch. Nidoran-M does well late-game; it can set up against Fighting-, Poison-, Grass-, and Fairy-types, but it must be wary of Knock Off or unexpected coverage moves, such as Snivy's Hidden Power Ground or Spritzee's Psychic. Finally, Nidoran-M will not be able to do much of anything if Ferroseed is still alive on the opposing team, so removing it should be a top priority.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Psychic-type attackers such as Abra threaten Nidoran-M, so a Dark-type teammate such as Vullaby is invaluable. Vullaby can also provide valuable Knock Off support and is even immune to Ground-type attacks. Other Dark-type teammates such as Stunky and Houndour can provide valuable Pursuit support, effectively eliminating Psychic-type threats. Ground-type attackers such as Drilbur are particularly threatening, as they resist Nidoran-M's STAB type and threaten it with their own super effective Ground-type STAB attacks. Flying- or Grass-type teammates do wonders in this regard, especially bulky ones such as Vullaby and Pumpkaboo. As mentioned before, Ferroseed completely walls Nidoran-M, so a Fire- or Fighting-type teammate, such as Ponyta or Timburr, will do wonders. Gothita and Magnemite can also help out in this aspect, as both can trap Ferroseed and eliminate it with Hidden Power Fire. Because Nidoran-M is so frail, Memento or Parting Shot support from the likes of Cottonee and Pancham does wonders for Nidoran-M, allowing it to set up Hone Claws in safety. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Archen helps wear down Nidoran-M's checks and counters, helping it pull off a sweep. Finally, Sticky Web support from the likes of Surskit helps fix Nidoran-M's middling Speed; Surskit also can take on Ground-types.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Zubat has a 4x resistance to Grass-, Bug-, and Fighting-type attacks, as well as an immunity to Ground-type attacks. It also has access to Brave Bird, which hits most of those types super effectively. Zubat has access to Infiltrator, which allows it to attack through Substitutes, and it gets Defog, which clears away all entry hazards and screens on the field. With these resistances and abilities, Zubat works well as a support Pokemon. However, Zubat's subpar stats keep it from being able to take advantage of these good traits. Zubat has several good special moves, but it has a terrible Special Attack stat to back them up and it lacks good physical attacking moves. Zubat only hits 16 Speed, which means that it is outsped by many common threats such as Mienfoo, Archen, Trubbish, and Drilbur. Its pitiful defenses make it hard to use for extended periods of time, and its Stealth Rock weakness makes it hard to switch in, which it should be doing a lot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Whirlwind, Toxic, and Tailwind are some other support options that Zubat can run. Consider your team and its strengths and weaknesses when deciding what to use. A Nasty Plot set, taking advantage of Zubat's wide special movepool, would unfortunately be a little too slow to be effective. It can run any combination of these special moves, including Giga Drain, Heat Wave, Shadow Ball, and Sludge Bomb, in order to give it incredible coverage. Steel Wing can be used to hit Fairy- and Rock-types, but its low Base Power makes it less potent. Hypnosis is another support option Zubat can run, as it lets Zubat put a Pokemon to sleep and then pivot out with U-turn, but the poor accuracy makes it too much of a gamble to run. Finally, Inner Focus allows Zubat to ignore Fake Out from Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Aipom.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Defiant</strong>: Defog raises the Attack of Pokemon that have this ability by two stages. The most common Pokemon that runs Defiant is Pawniard, and it can be a dangerous threat at +2 Attack.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon</strong>: Omanyte and Tirtouga can both set up on and subsequently KO Zubat. However, some Zubat carry Giga Drain, which can be a serious threat to both of them.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon</strong>: Chinchou and Magnemite are both common Electric-types that take little damage from Zubat's attacks and threaten to OHKO Zubat with their powerful STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon</strong>: Both Abra and Slowpoke threaten Zubat; however, these Pokemon must be more wary, as Abra doesn't want to switch into a Brave Bird and Slowpoke is outsped by Zubat, which can easily U-turn out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog is immensely important, as it allows Zubat to remove troublesome entry hazards. Brave Bird is Zubat's most powerful STAB attack and its best chance of being a threat to opposing Fighting-types. U-turn allows Zubat to switch out while dealing some damage, allowing Zubat to act as a pivot. Roost gives Zubat reliable recovery, as it takes heavy damage from switching into Stealth Rock, and therefore needs some means of recovering that health.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Speed and Attack is used so that Zubat can have as much offensive presence as possible, and a Jolly nature increases its Speed so that it can outspeed max Speed Scraggy. Eviolite should be run in order to increase Zubat's defenses. Without it, Zubat isn't likely to be able to survive most attacks, as Zubat's natural defenses are pitiful. Infiltrator allows Zubat to hit through Substitutes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Zubat can easily switch in on any Fighting-type move, as its Poison / Flying typing blesses it with a 4x resistance. From there, the opposing player will be forced to choose between staying in and taking a super effective STAB Brave Bird or switching, giving Zubat a free turn to Defog. However, offensive Mienfoo outspeeds Zubat, meaning that Mienfoo can simply U-turn out and take advantage of the opposing loss of momentum. Zubat's main job is to be a Defog user, keeping the field clear for its teammates. If possible, avoid using it as a sweeper, as so many other Pokemon are much better at this job. Also, avoid using Defog when the opponent has a Pokemon with Defiant, which would most likely be Pawniard. A free +2 Attack boost to an opposing Pokemon is not worth clearing the field of hazards.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Volt Absorb Chinchou takes care of the Electric-type Pokemon that threaten Zubat, and Dark-type Pokemon easily neutralize Psychic-types. Running a Defog user like Zubat is optimal on a team with Sturdy + Berry Juice users, such as Magnemite and Tirtouga. Zubat helps keep the field clear of entry hazards that would break Sturdy, and it effortlessly switches in on the Ground- and Grass-type moves that these two Pokemon fear. Don't run a Zubat if your team is also dependent on entry hazards, dual screens, or Sticky Web. Defog removes your team's entry hazards and screens as well, so Defog should only be used when you don't need those advantages.</p>"

  "Oddish": {
    "overview": "<p>Oddish is the bulkiest and most powerful special attacker of all Chlorophyll users. This makes it a viable sweeper in the sun, though it faces competition from Bellsprout and Bulbasaur; both have access to Growth, and Bellsprout has access to Weather Ball. Oddish is also difficult to revenge kill, as it is very fast in the sun, resists Fairy-, Fighting-, Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks, including common priority attacks like Aqua Jet and Mach Punch, and can use Sleep Powder on Sucker Punch users. Although it is weak to common attacks such as Fletchling's Acrobatics, Oddish is quite bulky and can sweep teams as long as the sun is up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dazzling Gleam is an option to hit Vullaby and Scraggy hard, but it has little other use. Oddish can also use Moonlight or Synthesis on the Eviolite set for recovery, which both heal two-thirds of its health in the sun.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Snover</strong>: Snover removes the sun Oddish needs and can come in on a Sleep Powder, Giga Drain, or a charging Solar Beam and OHKO Oddish with Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Fletchling</strong>: Fletchling can come in on anything but Sludge Bomb and OHKO Life Orb Oddish with Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Vullaby</strong>: Vullaby OHKOes Oddish with Brave Bird, can't be put to sleep, and is rarely 2HKOed by Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Larvesta and Ponyta are great checks to Oddish, as their Fire-type attacks are boosted by the sun Oddish uses. They can consistently check Oddish if the Sleep Clause prevents Oddish from using Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Porygon, Munchlax, and Lickitung are all bulky enough to tank a Solar Beam and fire off an attack in return.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Chlorophyll Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Oddish's most powerful attack is Solar Beam, which hits without charging in the sun. It heavily damages anything that doesn't resist it, though it is less reliable than Giga Drain, which hits regardless of whether or not the sun is up, albeit for less power. Sludge Bomb nails Grass- and Fairy-type Pokemon, particularly Cottonee and Spritzee. Hidden Power Fire covers the Steel-types that Solar Beam and Sludge Bomb fail to hit, including Pawniard, Magnemite and Ferroseed. Sleep Powder incapacitates a foe too bulky for Oddish to deal with. It's also useful for bringing back the sun by giving Vulpix a free turn to switch in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>In order for Oddish to sweep effectively, it needs 240 Special Attack EVs. A Life Orb makes its attacks hit extremely hard. 200 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow it to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Pawniard and Drilbur under the sun.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Without Eviolite, Oddish is too frail to be switched in, especially if it has racked up residual damage from entry hazards and Life Orb recoil, so it should only be brought in on a Grass- or Water-type attack. Oddish should attempt to sweep late-game once its counters are removed, but it can also force switches and put heavy dents in opponents in order for a teammate to finish them off late-game. However, Oddish isn't useful if the sun isn't up, so if the sun is about to end, it can use Sleep Powder on an opponent so that Vulpix can come back in and set up the sun.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Oddish needs a teammate to set up the sun, and Drought Vulpix is the best choice. In addition, other Chlorophyll users such as Bulbasaur and Bellsprout can be considered as teammates, as they can help break down opposing teams. Eviolite Chinchou and Archen are helpful with removing the Fire- and Flying-types Oddish can't take on and can even provide a safe switch-in for Oddish with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. Drilbur can provide Rapid Spin support, which is quite helpful for Oddish, as damage from Life Orb and entry hazards will wear it down very quickly. A Steel-type such as Magnemite or Pawniard can reliably check Oddish's Flying-type counters such as Vullaby and Fletchling. Oddish enjoys having entry hazards of its own to wear down its bulkier opponents. Dwebble and Archen both can set them up, while Archen can also provide Defog support and reliably check other Flying-types such as Vullaby and Fletchling.</p>"
      },
      "Eviolite": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Oddish's most powerful STAB option is Solar Beam. Although Giga Drain is weaker, it's a useful alternative, as it ensures Oddish isn't left waiting a turn to charge if the sun runs out or the weather is changed by an opposing weather inducer. Sludge Bomb is a reliable STAB that nails Grass- and Fairy-types, particularly Cottonee and Spritzee, for super effective damage. Hidden Power Fire is mostly for hitting Steel-types that resist Oddish's STAB moves, including Pawniard, Magnemite, and Ferroseed, for super effective damage. Sleep Powder is useful for incapacitating a foe Oddish can't push past, or for helping Vulpix bring back the sun if it is about to be cut short. It can also be used to incapacitate Sucker Punch users such as Pawniard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Oddish is the bulkiest Chlorophyll sweeper in the tier and is even bulkier with Eviolite. For instance, with 76 Defense EVs, it can take an itemless Acrobatics from Fletchling and avoid an OHKO all but 6.3% of the time. Oddish needs 160 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature for its attacks to hit hard, as well as 200 Speed EVs with Chlorophyll in order to outspeed all unboosted threats in the sun. This also allows it to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Chinchou and Magnemite and Speed tie with others such as Pawniard and Drilbur.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With Eviolite, Oddish is quite bulky and can therefore switch in more easily than other Chlorophyll users. It can switch into common threats such as Cottonee, Croagunk, Timburr, Mienfoo, and Chinchou quite comfortably and start attacking from there. Oddish should be brought in whenever the sun is up to put heavy offensive pressure on an opponent or to simply sweep once threats such as Vullaby and Fletchling are taken out. Sleep Powder can be used so Oddish has time to switch out and get its sun back if it is about to run out. It can also cripple a threat that Oddish is unable to beat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vulpix is an important teammate for Oddish, as it sets up the sun that the latter requires to sweep. Another Chlorophyll user such as Bellsprout or Bulbasaur can be considered in order to overwhelm an opponent with offensive pressure; however, this puts even more pressure on the team's Flying-type checks to do their job. Archen is able to check Oddish's deadliest counters, including Flying- and Fire-types. It's also capable of providing support by removing entry hazards as well as setting up its own, which is very welcome for this set, as Eviolite Oddish lacks the power it would have with Life Orb, and thus appreciates having walls worn down. Steel-type teammates such as Magnemite and Pawniard are able to check Flying-types such as Vullaby and Archen. They also resist the Ice- and Psychic-type moves Oddish is weak to, while Oddish is bulky enough to come in on the Fighting-type moves they are weak to. A teammate to remove hazards, such as Drilbur or the aforementioned Archen, is important as well, as although Oddish may be bulky, it cannot take hits so easily if it has taken too much entry hazard damage.</p>"

  "Paras": {
    "overview": "<p>Paras has a small niche in Little Cup thanks to its access to useful moves such as Spore, Knock Off, and Aromatherapy, as well as a very helpful ability in Dry Skin, which gives it an immunity to Water-type moves. Its Bug / Grass typing provides it with useful resistances to Electric-, Fighting-, Grass-, and Ground-type moves, giving it plenty of opportunities to switch in and support the team. Its positive traits end there, however, as its typing leaves it with a whopping six weaknesses, including 4x weaknesses to both Fire- and Flying-type moves, as well as a weakness to Stealth Rock. In addition to this, Paras has very low Speed and HP stats, making it even tougher for it to perform its role well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance is an option to boost Attack, but Paras is too slow to make good use of the boost. Because the foe will often switch out after being put to sleep by Spore, Stun Spore can be used to cripple another one of the opponent's Pokemon as it switches in. Counter is an option to heavily punish U-turn users. X-Scissor is a decently powerful STAB move and can be used to hit Grass-types, which are immune to Spore, but the most common Grass-types in the metagame, Ferroseed, Foongus, Cottonee, and Pumpkaboo-XL, are only hit neutrally by the move. Since Paras often switches into Fighting-types, which often carry Knock Off, Thief is an option to steal the foe's item. Leech Seed is an option to help wear down the opponent's team. Brick Break can be used to smack Pawniard and Houndour on the switch. Agility gives Paras a much-needed boost to its Speed, but Paras's mediocre coverage and susceptibility to priority such as Fletchling's Acrobatics make it a very lackluster sweeper. Effect Spore could be used over Dry Skin, but it's luck-based and situational at best.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Foongus and Ferroseed are perhaps the best counters to Paras, as they are immune to Spore and aren't heavily threatened by any of its moves. Foongus threatens Paras with Sludge Bomb, while Ferroseed can use Paras as an opportunity to set up entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Other Pokemon Immune to Spore</strong>: Overcoat users such as Vullaby and Shelmet are immune to Spore and can handle Paras with their STAB moves. Other Pokemon such as Spinarak and Magby are immune to sleep altogether thanks to Insomnia and Vital Spirit, respectively, and can defeat Paras with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Fletchling and Archen can easily defeat Paras with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Vulpix, Ponyta, and Larvesta can easily KO Paras with their STAB moves. Larvesta in particular can gain momentum on Paras with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Once Sleep Clause has been activated, Paras can't do much to opposing Poison-types such as Koffing and Croagunk, which heavily threaten Paras with their STAB Poison-type moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Paras is one of only three Pokemon in Little Cup with access to the 100% accurate Spore, allowing Paras to reliably put a foe to sleep as long as it isn't immune to powder moves or sleep. Knock Off allows Paras to cripple Pokemon that switch into it by removing their items and ensures that Paras isn't dead weight against opposing Grass-types. Bullet Seed hits reasonably hard coming off Paras's base 70 Attack and provides Paras with a useful STAB move as well as a method of dealing with Focus Sash, Sturdy, and Substitute users. Aromatherapy can be used instead to heal Paras and its teammates of status. Synthesis allows Paras to stay healthy throughout the match so that it can continue to check Water- and Fighting-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>76 HP EVs let Paras hit 21 HP, allowing it to switch into Stealth Rock four times without fainting. An Impish nature and 236 Defense EVs give Paras good physical bulk, allowing it to act as a good check to Fighting-types. The remaining EVs are put into Special Defense and Attack to boost Paras's bulk and damage output. Dry Skin gives Paras a useful immunity to Water-type moves at the cost of an even larger weakness to Fire-type attacks, but this is hardly a drawback, as Paras is OHKOed by every relevant Fire-type attack regardless of Dry Skin.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Paras should try to switch into Water-type moves such as Scald if possible, as these moves will heal Paras thanks to Dry Skin. In addition to its Water immunity, Paras has plenty of other resistances that it can take advantage of when it switches in, such as Ground, Grass, and Fighting. Be wary of switching into potential U-turn or Volt Switch users, however, as Paras has very exploitable weaknesses and is easily forced out. Spore should be used as soon as possible to take an opposing Pokemon out of commission. Keep in mind that Grass-types, as well as Overcoat users such as Vullaby, are immune to Spore, so Paras should use Knock Off against these potential switch-ins to remove their items. After a foe has been put to sleep by Spore, the free turn can be used to heal up with Synthesis, use Aromatherapy, cripple the switch-in with Knock Off, or switch to a teammate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate solid switch-ins to Fighting-types, such as Pawniard, have good synergy with Paras. Pokemon that resist Fire- and Flying-type moves, such as Archen and Chinchou, pair well with Paras, as they can patch up its biggest weaknesses. In return, Paras can cover Archen's weaknesses to Electric- and Water-type moves, as well as Chinchou's weaknesses to Ground- and Grass-type moves. Houndour is a great teammate, as it gains a Flash Fire boost from Fire-type moves aimed at Paras and can easily take down the Grass-type Pokemon that give Paras trouble. However, keep in mind that the two share a weakness to Rock-type moves. Teammates that can remove entry hazards, such as Vullaby and Drilbur, make for good teammates, as Paras is vulnerable to all entry hazards and weak to Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Venonat": {
    "overview": "<p>Venonat's niche lies in its extensive utility movepool, which includes Thief, Toxic Spikes, Morning Sun, and Sleep Powder. Compound Eyes makes Sleep Powder 97.5% accurate and a very reliable way to put opposing Pokemon to sleep. Venonat's typing gives it two 4x resistances to Fighting and Grass, but it also comes with weaknesses to Flying-, Fire-, Rock-, and Psychic-type attacks as well as a Stealth Rock. While Venonat has excellent support options, its offensive presence is very weak and shouldn't be relied on.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Venonat could use Stun Spore, but the opposing Pokemon are usually already poisoned or asleep. A set with Agility and Baton Pass could be used to set up a teammate for sweeping, but Torchic often does this better. Venoshock is another option to deal more damage, but Venonat lacks the power to make this worth using. Venonat learns Psychic, which could heavily damage Fighting- and Poison-types, but it's usually better to use utility moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Vullaby can absorb Sleep Powder due to Overcoat and use Defog to clear away Toxic Spikes. Fletchling can OHKO Venonat before it can move with some prior damage or if Venonat is using Berry Juice.</p> <p><strong>Foongus</strong>: Venonat struggles to do any significant damage to Foongus, while Foongus eliminates Toxic Spikes every time it comes into play and is immune to Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Faster Psychic-types</strong>: Faster Psychic-types such as Abra, Gothita, and Natu can all do massive damage or OHKO Venonat. Natu is particularly threatening, as it can bounce Sleep Powder and Toxic Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Fast Taunt Users</strong>: Mienfoo and Onix can use Taunt to prevent Venonat from setting up Toxic Spikes and using Sleep Powder, effectively stopping it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Ponyta, Larvesta, and Houndour can OHKO Venonat before it can do anything, though they can be put to sleep on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Grounded Poison-types</strong>: Stunky, Skrelp, Croagunk, and Foongus can absorb Toxic Spikes. Skrelp also utilizes a RestTalk set occasionally, making it a good switch-in to Venonat's Sleep Powder.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Toxic Spikes Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes can wear down all Pokemon that are grounded and not Poison-type, and it also breaks Focus Sashes and Sturdy while putting a timer on setup sweepers. Sleep Powder allows Venonat to further support its team by taking an opposing Pokemon out of the battle for a while and giving Venonat free turns to set up Toxic Spikes. Signal Beam is Venonat's most consistent and powerful move. Alternativey, Giga Drain gives Venonat a small source of recovery and has better super effective coverage. Morning Sun gives Venonat a lot of longevity and works well with Eviolite. Thief should only be used with Berry Juice, as it allows Venonat to steal items after using its Berry Juice or getting hit by Knock Off.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Speed EVs allow Venonat to reach 15 Speed, while the bulk EVs and Eviolite allow it to almost always survive an Acrobatics from Fletchling of the time. The remainder EVs are placed in Special Attack for a small boost in damage. The EVs also make sure Venonat has an odd HP number to take less damage from Stealth Rock. Berry Juice can be used to steal items along with Thief and lets Venonat switch in on Stealth Rock more times. Compound Eyes increases Sleep Powder's accuracy to 97.5%. Tinted Lens could be used to give Venonat more offensive presence, but it comes with the cost of missing Sleep Powder more often.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Venonat into Fighting- and Fairy-types to easily tank a hit and set up Toxic Spikes or put something to sleep. Venonat's primary role is to set up Toxic Spikes, so be aware of opposing grounded Poison-types, as they can absorb them. Venonat is not particularly useful late-game and should often be sacrificed early in the game, after setting up Toxic Spikes and putting something to sleep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pawniard and Ghost-types such as Pumpkaboo make for good partners to discourage or prevent the foe from using Defog and Rapid Spin, respectively. Diglett and Gothita can trap opposing Poison-types that can absorb Toxic Spikes; Diglett can handle Stunky and Croagunk better, while Gothita works better against Foongus, and both of them do equally well against other Poison-types like Trubbish and Skrelp. Pokemon that can check Flying- and Fire-types make for good teammates, with Onix, Tirtouga, and Chinchou being particularly good for this because of their ability to check both. Pursuit trappers such as Stunky and Munchlax can stop Abra from posing too much of a threat to Venonat. Pokemon that appreciate the Toxic Spikes support like Venoshock + Hex Gastly and walls such as Spritzee and Porygon are also good teammates. Hard hitters and sweepers, such as Carvanha, also synergize well with Toxic Spikes because of the important chip damage it provides. Finally, Rapid Spin users like Drilbur and Staryu can help improve Venonat's longevity by removing Stealth Rock.</p>"

Meowth's movepool and access to the strongest Fake Out in Little Cup give it a good matchup against common leads such as Mienfoo, Dwebble, and Onix. However, Meowth's low attacking stats mean it has to run a Life Orb and hit foes super effectively to secure KOs. Meowth's terrible bulk only compounds this, as it will likely be KOed if it cannot KO what's in front of it. Its low bulk makes it susceptible to revenge killers as well. Finally, Meowth often faces competition from Aipom, which is both bulkier and a stronger wallbreaker, for a teamslot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fighting OHKOes Eviolite Pawniard while retaining decent coverage against other Steel-types, but is usually inferior to Hidden Power Fire, which has much better all-around coverage and still 2HKOes Eviolite Pawniard. Taunt may be used to stop opposing entry hazard setters and setup sweepers from setting up on Meowth, but Meowth can usually handle most of these Pokemon by simply attacking them. Hypnosis can be used to put a foe to sleep, but its low accuracy makes it unreliable. Seed Bomb or Hidden Power Grass can be used to provide stronger coverage against Chinchou, Omanyte, and Tirtouga, but Meowth has trouble fitting it in its set without giving up more important coverage. Gunk Shot 2HKOes Spritzee after Stealth Rock damage and has a decent chance to OHKO Berry Juice Snubbull after Stealth Rock damage, but Meowth again has trouble finding a moveslot for it. Icy Wind can hit opposing Ground- and Flying-types super effectively in one slot and can also slow down faster switch-ins such as Choice Scarf Magnemite so that Meowth can follow up with another attack. Finally, the combination of Normal Gem and Covet gives Meowth a stronger Fake Out while allowing Meowth to steal the foe's item, but this set is outclassed by Meowth's other sets as well as Aipom. Meowth is too frail to make use of a stolen Eviolite, Foregoing Life Orb for Normal Gem leavesall of Meowth's other moves noticeably weaker, and Covet is outclassed by Knock Off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Pokemon such as Porygon and Spritzee can stomach Meowth's strongest attacks and retaliate by attacking or crippling Meowth. They must be careful of the Nasty Plot set, however.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr can tank any of Meowth's attacks and KO back with their super effective STAB attacks. However, Aerial Ace does a lot of damage to these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Ferroseed, Pawniard, and Magnemite take little from most of Meowth's attacks, but they must be careful of Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon faster than Meowth, such as Diglett and any Choice Scarf user, can threaten to KO it due to its frailty. Many of these Pokemon take heavy damage from Feint, however.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Strong priority attacks such as Fletchling's Acrobatics and Pawniard's Sucker Punch bypass Meowth's Speed and often KO it due to its frailty.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Meowth's Fake Out is the strongest in the metagame, letting it get significant chip damage and helping scout the foe's set based on damage output. Feint provides Meowth with STAB and Technician-boosted +2 priority, allowing it to pick off weakened Choice Scarf users and priority attackers such as Fletchling. Alternatively, Return may be used for heavier damage against neutral targets. Water Pulse hits Rock-types such as Dwebble, Onix, and Archen super effectively, KOing them after Fake Out or Stealth Rock damage. Aerial Ace deals massive damage to Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr. Knock Off cripples Meowth's switch-ins by removing their item and is Meowth's most reliable method of defeating Gastly. U-turn allows Meowth to get chip damage and switch out of foes it cannot KO outright, as well as pivot on its switch-ins. Hidden Power Fire is also an option to 2HKO Ferroseed, which doesn't take much from any of Meowth's other moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread with a Hasty nature maximizes Meowth's Attack and Speed, letting it hit as hard and as fast as possible. 36 Special Attack EVs ensure that Meowth's Water Pulse KOes offensive Archen after Fake Out or Stealth Rock damage. Technician boosts the power of Meowth's weaker moves such as Fake Out, Feint, Water Pulse, and Aerial Ace. Life Orb significantly boosts the power of all of Meowth's attacks. 19 HP IVs are run to reduce Meowth's HP to 19 so that it only takes 1 HP of damage from Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Meowth is very frail and takes a lot from the weakest of neutral attacks, so avoid switching it into battle directly. Instead, use it as a lead or bring it in on a revenge kill or a slow pivoting move such as Mienfoo's U-turn. When Meowth is in play, it is a very straightforward Pokemon. Use Fake Out and Feint to revenge kill frailer Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mienfoo and Zigzagoon, or use Meowth's wide coverage to KO whatever Pokemon it is facing, to hit switch-ins, or to serve as an anti-lead.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow pivots with access to U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Mienfoo and Chinchou, help ensure that Meowth can enter battle safely. Checks to Fighting-types, such as Spritzee and Snubbull, are useful, as Meowth can be forced out by these Pokemon. Rock-types such as Archen and Nosepass check Fletchling while providing Stealth Rock support to help Meowth secure KOs. Knock Off users such as Pawniard help weaken the opponent's team, allowing Meowth to secure more KOs. Gothita can guarantee the removal of troublesome Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Timburr. Pursuit trappers, such as Stunky, are helpful for removing Ghost-types if Meowth is not running Knock Off.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot doubles Meowth's Special Attack, allowing it to deal heavy damage to most of the metagame after a single boost. Round is Meowth's preferred STAB move, hitting anything that isn't resistant or immune to it hard after a Nasty Plot boost while being capable of bypassing Substitutes. Water Pulse provides great neutral coverage overall alongside Round and super effective coverage against Archen and Hippopotas, OHKOing them after a Nasty Plot boost. Hidden Power Fire OHKOes Ferroseed after Stealth Rock damage and provides stronger coverage against other Grass- and Steel-types such as Foongus, Snivy, and Honedge. Alternatively, Thunderbolt allows Meowth to OHKO Omanyte and Skrelp after a Nasty Plot boost, as well as Vullaby after Stealth Rock damage; however, this leaves the set walled by Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Meowth's Special Attack and Speed, allowing it to hit as hard and as fast as possible while accounting for Hidden Power Fire's IV drops. If Meowth is not running Hidden Power Fire, a spread of 76 Def / 196 SpA / 36 SpD / 196 Spe gives it an extra point in Special Defense. A Modest nature gives Meowth the most wallbreaking potential, guaranteeing that Pokemon such as fast Mienfoo and Foongus are OHKOed at +2. Alternatively, a Timid nature may be used instead to hit 19 Speed, outspeeding Gastly and tying with Ponyta and Abra, but this comes with a noticeable drop in power. Life Orb boosts the power of all of Meowth's attacks. 19 HP IVs are used to lower Meowth's HP to 19 so that it only takes 1 HP of damage from Life Orb recoil. Technician is Meowth's best ability, giving Round, Water Pulse, and Hidden Power Fire a significant power boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Meowth's frailty, avoid switching it in directly. Instead, use free turns provided by moves such as Memento or forced switches to set up. Once Meowth has set up, use whatever move will do the most damage to the foe; at +2, Meowth is strong enough to OHKO much of the metagame.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support is vital for this set to secure KOs; thus, common Stealth Rock setters such as Archen and Pawniard make excellent teammates. Spikes users such as Dwebble and Omanyte can allow Meowth to more viably run a Timid nature. Checks to Fighting-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull are useful if Meowth is forced out by one. Cottonee can provide setup opportunities for Meowth with Encore and Memento and is a decent check to Fighting-types. Pokemon capable of removing Ferroseed, such as Gothita and Magnet Pull Magnemite, are important if Meowth not running Hidden Power Fire, as Ferroseed completely walls Meowth otherwise.</p>"

  "Mankey": {
    "overview": "<p>Mankey has a nice movepool that includes Close Combat, Earthquake, Gunk Shot, the elemental punches, and U-turn. It also has two good abilities, Defiant and Vital Spirit, as well as good base Attack and Speed stats. However, it is quite frail and is outclassed by other common Fighting-types in certain roles; for example, both Mienfoo and Timburr outclass it as a pivot, as they have access to Knock Off to hit Ghost-types and cripple foes. However, Mankey's niche lies in its Choice Scarf set, which can utilize Defiant and a STAB Close Combat to punch holes in opposing teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An itemless set including Acrobatics and Thief can be utilized, giving Mankey a pseudo-Knock Off, as well as a strong 110 Base Power Flying-type move. Vital Spirit is an option, but it can only really check Foongus and even then, Mankey can only 2HKO it after Stealth Rock damage. Encore can cripple support Pokemon and, in tandem with Bulk Up, can provide Mankey with a free turn to set up; Foongus is especially hampered by Encore, as Mankey is immune to Spore if it has its other ability Vital Spirit and can threaten Foongus with Ice Punch. Rock Slide allows Mankey to hit Flying-types and, more importantly, Larvesta for super effective damage. Taunt, combined with Mankey's impressive 17 Speed, can shut down opposing entry hazard leads and support Pokemon, creating free turns and momentum for Mankey and its allies. Night Slash gives Mankey a way to hit Ghost-types so that it doesn't have to switch out every time Gastly or Pumpkaboo switches in.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Fletchling and Choice Scarf Doduo can effectively revenge kill Mankey, as both can outspeed and hit it with a super effective Flying-type move. Vullaby can also handle Mankey, as it avoids the 2HKO from Close Combat as long as Stealth Rock isn't up.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Croagunk and Trubbish don't mind anything Mankey can throw at them, bar Earthquake, and can hit it with a STAB Sludge Bomb or Gunk Shot, respectively. Foongus is hit neutrally by Earthquake and can avoid the 2HKO from Ice Punch if Stealth Rock isn't up. Koffing completely walls Mankey thanks to Levitate, rendering Earthquake useless against it.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Bulky Psychic-types, notably Slowpoke, can easily handle Mankey, as they're only hit super effectively by U-turn. Slowpoke, due to its handy ability Regenerator, can actually heal off more damage than Jolly Mankey can deal with U-turn; however, Adamant Mankey can outdamage Regenerator's healing capability by one point of HP. Gothita and Wynaut can also switch into any of Mankey's attacks, bar U-turn, and trap it, eventually KOing it with either Psychic or Counter, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types, notably Spritzee, can be quite an issue for Mankey, as although Gunk Shot can 2HKO Spritzee, it can comfortably take any of Mankey's other moves and threaten it with a super effective Fairy-type move. Spritzee also has access to reliable recovery in Wish, letting it repeatedly switch into Mankey's Close Combat, and can OHKO Mankey with Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Due to Mankey's lack of a Dark-type move on its main set, Ghost-types can usually switch in with little trouble. Gastly and Frillish, in particular, are large nuisances, as the former is immune to Earthquake and the latter can threaten Mankey with Scald and Will-O-Wisp. Pumpkaboo is also a large threat, as it resist Earthquake and can burn Mankey with Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Mankey's STAB move of choice, sporting 120 Base Power. U-turn allows Mankey to pivot out of unfavorable matchups and scout, as its damage output can determine whether the foe is running Eviolite or Berry Juice. Earthquake is primarily for hitting Poison-types, such as Trubbish, that can otherwise wall Mankey; it also smacks Chinchou for super effective damage. Gunk Shot hits Fairy-types that resist Mankey's STAB, notably Snubbull, Cottonee, and Spritzee, for super effective damage. Ice Punch provides Mankey with a means of hitting Foongus, which shrugs off Mankey's other attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs are primarily centered on maximizing Mankey's Attack and Speed and enhancing its capabilities as a physical attacker; the remaining EVs are invested in HP and Defense to boost Mankey's bulk. An Adamant nature allows Mankey to 2HKO both Timburr and Spritzee with Close Combat and Gunk Shot, respectively, and have a decent chance to KO Trubbish after Stealth Rock damage. A Jolly nature can be utilized instead, boosting Mankey's Speed to 17, which allows it to Speed creep Choice Scarf Bunnelby and Modest Choice Scarf Chinchou. Defiant turns Mankey's fear of Sticky Web into something it appreciates, capitalizing on Sticky Web's Speed drop and gaining a +2 Attack boost; it also deters foes from attempting to Defog, which also boosts Mankey's Attack by two stages. Choice Scarf lets Mankey outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup and still hit 17 Speed when Sticky Web is in play.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Mankey's frailty, one should be cautious when switching it in, as most moves it doesn't resist will put a large dent in it. Mankey functions best as a late-game cleaner, so bringing it in by slowly pivoting, or simply sacrificing a Pokemon, is preferred.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow pivots, such as Mienfoo and Chinchou, can allow Mankey to switch in safely so it can proceed to threaten the foe with a powerful attack. Knock Off support from the likes of Pawniard and Mienfoo softens up opposing walls, enhancing Mankey's cleaning and revenge killing capabilities. Entry hazard support from the likes of Archen, Tirtouga, and Ferroseed is quite beneficial, as it whittles down the health of Mankey's switch-ins, eventually allowing Mankey to capitalize on their low HP and KO them with one of its coverage moves. Also, opponents will usually attempt to Defog away entry hazards, at which point Mankey can switch in and gain a +2 Attack boost thanks to Defiant. Pokemon that can handle Fairy-, Poison-, and Flying-types have good synergy with Mankey, as they clear away the Pokemon that resist its STAB attack. Tirtouga, Archen, and Ferroseed make great teammates, as the former two can handle Poison- and Flying-types, while the latter can handle Poison- and Fairy-types.</p>"

  "Growlithe": {
    "overview": "<p>Growlithe has access to a very useful ability, Intimidate, giving it a niche as a physical wall in Little Cup. Growlithe has a wonderful total of six resistances, including one to the now much more viable Steel-type. Growlithe also benefits from Drought Vulpix being allowed in the tier, as sunlight amps up its Flare Blitz while also making its main recovery, Morning Sun, much more reliable. However, despite these great assets, Growlithe has a few flaws. It is susceptible to every single entry hazard, especially Stealth Rock, which strips off 25% of its health just by switching in. Growlithe is also outclassed as a physical attacker by Ponyta and Darumaka, and as a special attacker by Houndour. Growlithe also lacks a way to get through the very common Chinchou. Intimidate is also a double-edged sword, as it gives Defiant users +1 Attack instead of -1, which is quite an issue when Pawniard is one of the most common Pokemon in the tier. It also has issues getting past common physical setup sweepers such as Dwebble and Tirtouga thanks to their super effective STAB moves. Despite these flaws, Growlithe is a good physical wall in Little Cup.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Growlithe's other ability, Flash Fire, is usable if your team is in absolute need of a way to stop Fire-types, but it is generally far less useful than Intimidate. Roar is an option to phaze opponents, although Growlithe already has issues fitting in all the moves it needs. It does, however, stop Torchic chains that can easily set up on Growlithe, which can come in handy. Flame Charge can aid in a sweep, boosting Growlithe's Speed, but Growlithe is a defensive Pokemon, not an offensive one. If it does choose to run Flame Charge, its set should consist of Flare Blitz / Flame Charge / Wild Charge / Close Combat. However, this is mostly outclassed by Ponyta, though Ponyta has more difficulty setting up and lacks a way to get past Rock-types. A Choice Band can bolster Growlithe's Attack, but this is better left to other Pokemon. Close Combat gets great coverage, but it lowers Growlithe's defenses, which is not optimal on a defensive Pokemon. Howl is the only way Growlithe can boost its Attack, but the boost is often too small and hard to set up. A special attacking set has merit, but again, it is outclassed by other Pokemon. Fire Blast and Flamethrower are alternatives to Flare Blitz if you don't enjoy the recoil. Toxic turns Growlithe into a very nice stall Pokemon. Thief can steal Eviolites and Berry Juices if your item is lost to Knock Off. Sunny Day can can work as an alternative to Vulpix support, though it isn't worth the loss of a moveslot. Justified is an extremely situational ability, but it can net Growlithe +1 Attack for switching into Knock Off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Sandstorm and Hail</strong>: Sandstorm and hail both severely reduce the recovery from Morning Sun while also dealing chip damage, which Growlithe absolutely hates. However, Growlithe can somewhat beat Hippopotas, as Hippopotas dislikes Will-O-Wisp's residual damage and crippling of its physical attacks.</p> <p><strong>Numel</strong>: Numel is very rare, but it is the best counter to Growlithe out there. It cannot be burned and is immune to or resistant to everything else Growlithe throws at it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Chinchou, Frillish, and Slowpoke all wall Growlithe to infinity and back, taking next to nothing from its moves, not even Wild Charge. They can all retaliate with Scald and knock Growlithe out.</p> <p><strong>Timburr</strong>: Timburr can wall Growlithe, as it does not mind Will-O-Wisp thanks to Guts. It doesn't really enjoy Intimidate, but it can still come in on Growlithe and take it on. Its powerful Drain Punches can easily decimate Growlithe, while also helping it heal off the damage from Flare Blitz.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types are walled by Growlithe, however, it is also walled by them. This creates a stalemate between Growlithe and other Fire-types.</p> <p><strong>Munchlax</strong>: Munchlax, especially RestTalk Munchlax, is a great counter to Growlithe. Thick Fat allows it to shrug off Flare Blitz, and it can recover from repeated hits and a burn thanks to Rest. It can take any of Growlithe's moves, while slowly wearing it down in return.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock, along with other entry hazards, leave Growlithe prone to being worn down, as it tends to switch a lot.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With both Will-O-Wisp and Intimidate, Growlithe can be very difficult to take down on the physical side. Flare Blitz is Growlithe's main form of attack, as it is decently powerful. Morning Sun allows Growlithe to recover health, and is boosted in Sun; however, it can be shaky under other weathers. Wild Charge gets good coverage with Flare Blitz, hitting the things that Flare Blitz cannot, such as Water-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Impish nature is preferred, as it gives Growlithe as much physical bulk as possible. The given EVs and nature allow Growlithe to reach 25 HP / 21 Def / 19 SpD after Eviolite, making it very bulky, especially when backed up by Intimidate. Eviolite is the item of choice here, as it gives Growlithe more overall longevity than does Berry Juice. Eviolite also allows Growlithe to take certain special attacks, such as Staryu's Scald, much better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be sure to capitalize on Intimidate, as it is one of the few advantages to using Growlithe, especially against Pokemon such as Timburr. Never switch Growlithe in on a Pawniard or Inkay, as they will be given +1 Attack instead of -1, due to Defiant and Contrary, respectively. Growlithe is one of the greatest stops to the best cleric in the tier, Spritzee, as it resists its STAB Moonblast and can take its other attacks as well. Growlithe is best used after Water-types such as Chinchou and Frillish have been eliminated, as their STAB moves put an end to it. Growlithe should also watch out for other Fire-types, as they wall it to hell and back. Growlithe is a key check to many physical attackers and is a huge threat to them. However, Pokemon that commonly carry Knock Off are the bane of Growlithe, as it hates the removal of its precious Eviolite.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chinchou makes for a great partner, as it can take on the Water- and Fire-types that give Growlithe trouble, while in return, Growlithe can handle the Grass-types that give Chinchou problems. Rapid Spin or Defog support is absolutely mandatory, as entry hazards chip away at Growlithe's health all too fast. Two great candidates for this role are Tentacool and Vullaby. Vullaby is especially good, as it can take on Ground-types, but awkwardly, both Tentacool and Vullaby share weaknesses with Growlithe. Spritzee has decent synergy with Growlithe, and can pass Wishes and keep it healthy with Heal Bell, something that Growlithe absolutely needs. Growlithe can form a devastating Intimidate core with Sraggy or Snubbull as a teammate. Vulpix's Drought increases the power of Growlithe's Flare Blitz and the healing of Morning Sun, but the two of them stack weaknesses. Most Grass-types also have good synergy with Growlithe, handling Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type Pokemon, with Growlithe taking on the Ice- and Bug-types that threaten Grass-types in return.</p>"

It's one of two Pokemon in the LC metagame that has access to both Hypnosis and Belly Drum, allowing it to put a Pokemon to sleep and then Belly Drum to boost its Attack dramatically. Unfortunately, Poliwag's defenses are not that great, and there are better Belly Drum users out there, specifically Zigzagoon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Poliwag has access to Swift Swim, allowing it to run a Rain Dance sweeper set, but rain teams are subpar in Little Cup. Poliwag can also use Wake-Up Slap as the fourth move to hit Ferroseed, but this wakes it up from sleep in the process. Protect can also be used to help against Pokemon who are attempting to whittle down Poliwag's HP by using Fake Out and then switching. Substitute can also be used to help prevent status moves, such as Thunder Wave from Porygon, from hindering Poliwag.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Lileep</strong>: Lileep can only be 2HKOed by Wake-Up Slap while taking all the other hits.</p> <p><strong>Chinchou</strong>: Chinchou can cause problems, as it can KO Poliwag with an Electric-type move, resists Waterfall, and if running a RestTalk set, it does not mind Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Ferroseed</strong>: Ferroseed resists Waterfall and Return, but has a slim chance of being 2HKOed by Thief.</p> <p><strong>Frillish</strong>: Frillish is immune to both Waterfall and Return. It only fears Thief from Poliwag.</p> <p><strong>Croagunk</strong>: Croagunk is immune to Waterfall and is only 2HKOed by Return while Sludge Bomb + Vacuum Wave KOes Poliwag.</p> <p><strong>Carvanha</strong>: Carvanha outspeeds after a Protect and KOes with Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Elekid</strong>: Elekid outspeeds Poliwag and can KO it with an Electric-type move.</p> <p><strong>Fletchling</strong>: Fletchling has a good chance to OHKO with Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Timburr</strong>: Timburr is only 2HkOed by Waterfall while KOing back with Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out + Switching</strong>: Aipom, Mienfoo, and Meowth can switch into Poliwag after a KO and chip away damage with Fake Out.</p>",

      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Poliwag needs to have Belly Drum as a move, otherwise it is useless. Belly Drum allows Poliwag to boost its Attack to +6. Waterfall is Poliwag's main attacking move because after a Belly Drum, very few Pokemon can take a non resisted +6 Waterfall. Hypnosis is useful for creating an opportunity to get off Belly Drum, as Poliwag outspeeds the majority of the metagame. Encore can be used on Fake Out users or Water-type moves that Poliwag is immune to, creating another opportunity to set up. Return or Thief can be used as the last move. Return hits hard and provides good coverage alongside Waterfall, but the likes of Frillish and Ferroseed can easily stop it. Thief allows Poliwag to steal the opposing Pokemon's items after Poliwag loses its Berry Juice when using Belly Drum and also allows Poliwag to hit Frillish.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set is simple to use. Poliwag puts opposing Pokemon to sleep with Hypnosis, then uses Belly Drum to reach a massive Attack stat. Then, it sweeps with Waterfall and either Thief or Return. Water Absorb provides Poliwag with an immunity to Water-type attacks, giving it a few chances to switch in. Berry Juice allows Poliwag to restore HP after using Belly Drum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Poliwag loves Sticky Web support, as it allows Poliwag to outspeed its common checks, such as Elekid and Choice Scarf Chinchou. Stealth Rock support is helpful for combating Magnemite and other Sturdy + Berry Juice users who can survive a hit. As for Pokemon that support Poliwag, Magnemite can help take out Poliwag's counters such as Ferroseed and Frillish.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Machop has retained its place as the only Pokemon that can carry both No Guard and Dynamic Punch, a notoriously deadly combination. Not only does Dynamic Punch benefit a lot from No Guard, but other moves, such as Rock Slide, benefit from the perfect accuracy too. Machop also has access to a lot of good coverage moves such as Knock Off and Poison Jab, and it has solid bulk and a decent HP stat in addition to a strong Attack stat. However, it sees less usage than some other Fighting-types, because besides its No Guard + Dynamic Punch combination, it is outclassed in almost every way.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set can deal more damage to opponents, but it prevents Machop from being as fast as it is with a Choice Scarf. It could, however, be useful on a Sticky Web team, where Machop doesn't need stellar Speed to be a threat. Its Flying-type weakness would persist, though, as Flying-types aren't affected by Sticky Web. Most other sets and moves Machop that has access to are better used by other Fighting-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Tanks</strong>: Machop deals negligible damage to bulky Pokemon, especially Pokemon that resist Dynamic Punch. Some of these Pokemon include Koffing, Larvesta, Slowpoke, and Spritzee.</p> <p><strong>Status Moves</strong>: Burn and paralysis inhibit Machop. If it's burned, it will have a difficult time punching its way through any Pokemon. Paralysis impedes Machop, keeping it from outspeeding the Pokemon that it needs to fight.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: With a Choice Scarf, Machop is fast. However, other Choice Scarf Pokemon are faster. These quick attackers take advantage of their superior Speed to take Machop down. Pokemon with priority moves, particularly Acrobatics Fletchling, can be an even bigger threat.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Having a Choice Scarf locks Machop into one move. If a Ghost-type switches into a Dynamic Punch, Machop will be forced to switch out.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Because of No Guard, all moves hit with 100% accuracy. As such, Dynamic Punch, which otherwise has 50% accuracy, will hit every time. Dynamic Punch is Machop's best STAB move, as it has a massive Base Power as well as a 100% chance to confuse the opposing Pokemon. Knock Off allows Machop to take on Ghost-type Pokemon, while also allowing it to remove other Pokemon's items, leaving them more vulnerable to attack. Rock Slide can do a lot of damage to Flying-types, Pokemon that can present a serious threat to Machop. Poison Jab finishes off Machop's coverage, giving it the ability to defeat Fairy-types more easily. It's important to note that these moves are specifically intended for this coverage. Dynamic Punch will reliably deal the most neutral damage to any Pokemon and should be frequently taken advantage of.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf is an absolutely necessary item, as in conjunction with a Jolly nature, it brings Machop to 21 Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. The EV spread maximizes Attack and Speed, with a small amount going into increasing bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Machop must be played carefully. Switch it out when a dangerous Psychic- or Flying-type, such as Abra or Fletchling, comes in, even when it is weak to the move Machop is locked into. Predicting switches and responding using appropriate coverage moves really comes in handy, and you should obviously select the most powerful coverage move for any given situation. Knock Off is the best move to use early-game, because it gets rid of the opponent's item and leaves them weakened. Dynamic Punch is extremely powerful, but it only has a 8 PP. Lastly, avoid switching Machop into most attacks. If it's a resisted attack, that's preferable to a strong neutral hit or a super effective hit, but Machop should mostly switch in after an ally has fainted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>For Machop to be a significant threat, it requires a good deal of support, especially Pokemon that it can switch out to. Any bulky Steel-types, such as Magnemite and Ferroseed, resist Machop's weaknesses to Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks and can therefore switch into them. Magnemite also resists Flying-type attacks, another threat to Machop. Slow U-turn and Volt Switch users, such as Vullaby and Magnemite, respectively, give Machop a safe switch in. A Dark-type like Pawniard can come in handy when it comes to Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon, especially if it has Pursuit to trap them.</p>"

In addition to the wonderful resistances that Water / Poison typing has always brought, the introduction of Fairy-types has given Tentacool a new niche by allowing it to check threats such as Calm Mind Spritzee. Solid special bulk coupled with decent Speed for a defensively oriented Pokemon make it a good special pivot. With an excellent supportive movepool, which includes gems such as Knock Off and Rapid Spin, Tentacool can cause quite a headache for the opposing team, and the unbanning of Berry Juice gives Tentacool a chance to bypass the issue of lacking recovery. However, its pathetic physical bulk leaves Tentacool as a shaky check to physical Fire- and Fighting-types such as Ponyta and Mienfoo, and once its Berry Juice has been used up, Tentacool is very prone to being worn down. These traits in conjunction with Tentacool's weaknesses to common Electric-, Ground-, and Psychic-type attacks leave much to be desired from the jellyfish.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Acid Spray allows Tentacool to threaten switch-ins more easily after forcing a switch and helps Tentacool pose as a moderate offensive threat. Ice Beam could be used to hit Foongus and Flying-types harder, as well as Ground-types if Scald isn't a safe move to use, but Tentacool's STAB moves are usually enough. Giga Drain is an option for an attacking move that lets Tentacool recover some HP, but most Pokemon don't take much damage from it, so Sludge Bomb is usually the better option. Sludge Wave is interchangeable with Sludge Bomb depending on whether 5 base power or a 20% poison chance is considered more valuable. Tentacool has reasonable Speed and access to Swords Dance, but physical sweeping should usually be left to faster and stronger Pokemon. As for items, Berry Juice is optimal, but an Eviolite set can be used with Wish support if the added bulk is particularly important.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ferroseed</strong>: Ferroseed is immune to Sludge Bomb, resists Scald, and can hit back hard with Bullet Seed.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Bulky Electric-types such as Chinchou and Magnemite can switch in and wreak havoc with their Electric-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Slowpoke</strong>: Slowpoke is bulky enough to take anything Tentacool can throw at it while healing off the damage with Slack Off and Regenerator, and can KO Tentacool with a Psychic-type STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Croagunk</strong>: Dry Skin Croagunk is immune to Scald and resists Sludge Bomb, allowing it to wear Tentacool down with Knock Off or set up boosts.</p> <p><strong>Fast Ground-types</strong>: Although they won't appreciate taking a Scald, fast Ground-types such as Drilbur and Diglett, once they manage to get in, will be able to severely damage Tentacool with Earthquake.</p>",

      "Rapid Spinner": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Access to notable moves such as Rapid Spin and Knock Off gives Tentacool the opportunity to function as an acceptable defensive support Pokemon. Being able to use the coveted Rapid Spin is one of Tentacool's big draws, as removing entry hazards from your side of the field while retaining entry hazards on the opponent's is quite useful. Sludge Bomb and Scald act as reliable STAB moves for Tentacool, and each carries a bonus chance to status the enemy with poison or burn, respectively. Knock Off hits much of the item-reliant LC metagame hard thanks to its Base Power being buffed to 65 this generation. However, Toxic Spikes is another rare move that Tentacool can boast access to, and it can be used in the last slot instead if deemed necessary.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Tentacool is best used by taking advantage of its phenomenal special bulk, and the EVs and nature are designed to do so. The remaining EVs should be put in defense in an effort to make Tentacool an overall better wall and Speed to boost Tentacool to a respectable 14 Speed. A Bold nature with a physically defensive spread can be used instead, but Tentacool will still have trouble taking powerful physical hits due to its naturally low Defense. Berry Juice is the preferred item because otherwise Tentacool lacks any form of recovery whatsoever, which is not ideal for a defensive Pokemon. Liquid Ooze is the recommended ability because it can help turn the tables on Pokemon that use draining moves such as Leech Seed or Giga Drain in certain situations.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Despite its numerous resistances, Tentacool's lack of consistent recovery and physical bulk means that it should be switched in with caution. With that being said, Tentacool is best saved for mid-game when you want to change the tide of the battle by getting rid of entry hazards or knocking off an opponent's item. Despite Tentacool's low base Special Attack, Sludge Bomb's high Base Power allows Tentacool to actually deal a fair bit of damage, so with Tentacool's acceptable coverage and decent Speed, it can attempt to weaken slower teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can take advantage of a clear field, such as Ponyta and Fletchling, are primary candidates for teammates. Larvesta in particular decimates Psychic-types with U-turn while Tentacool resists Larvesta's Water weakness. Good physical tanks work well by making up for Tentacool's weaker Defense. Slowpoke can take on the Fire-types and Fighting-types that Tentacool couldn't hope to wall. To further increase Tentacool's longevity, Wish support is also appreciated, especially from the likes of Spritzee, as Tentacool can switch in on the Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-type moves aimed at it. Chinchou is able to keep Tentacool free of status with Heal Bell and absorb the Electric-type attacks aimed at Tentacool. Tentacool synergizes well with other Knock Off users by forcing a large portion of the enemy team to forgo their items.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Tentacool's primary STAB move, and it allows for surprise 2HKOs on Pokemon that switch in on an expected Scald, such as Porygon, which offensive Tentacool has a good chance to KO with a Life Orb-boosted Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock damage. Sludge Bomb is Tentacool's secondary STAB move, allowing it to hit Fairy-types super effectively and is the main advantage this Tentacool set has over Staryu. Knock Off lets Tentacool hit Pokemon on the switch and remove their item, making it easier for the rest of the team to deal with them, or else putting them in range of a KO from Tentacool's own moves. In the last slot, Acid Spray can be used to weaken a switch-in, effectively doubling Tentacool's damage output or else forcing a foe out into a more favorable matchup. Rapid Spin can be used to support the team by removing hazards, and when used in tandem with Knock Off, can lure in and cripple spin-blockers; however, this set does not make Tentacool a reliable entry hazard remover, as it gets worn down quickly. Giga Drain allows Tentacool to deal respectable damage to Chinchou and other bulky Water-types like Corphish.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With 196 Speed EVs, Tentacool reaches a respectable 17 Speed stat, which lets it Speed tie with many of the most relevant Pokemon in the metagame, as well as solidly outspeed every Fairy-type in LC bar the rare maximum Speed Cottonee. 196 Special Attack EVs, coupled with Life Orb, let Tentacool hit as hard as possible. The rest of the EVs are invested into Defense and Special Defense to give Tentacool more longevity. Clear Body is run to prevent Tentacool's stats from being lowered, meaning it has an immunity to Sticky Web, which gives Tentacool a niche as the only spinner in LC with this immunity. Liquid Ooze can also be run to punish Drain Punch and Giga Drain users, but offensive Tentacool does not possess the bulk to take many of these hits anyway. 19 HP IVs are run to lower Tentacool's HP to 19, preventing it from taking more than 1 HP damage in recoil every time it takes recoil damage from Life Orb.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Offensive Tentacool primarily functions as a lure, bringing in Pokemon that expect to take no damage from Rapid Spin or low damage from the defensive set, and hitting them hard with a Life Orb-boosted attack. Tentacool has extremely good coverage with just its STAB moves, so it has an easy time taking advantage of them early-game. Avoid switching Tentacool in on physical attacks, as it has very poor physical bulk. Be cautious when playing against trappers, though, as both Diglett and Gothita trap Tentacool and remove it from play easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tentacool appreciates support from Pursuit trappers such as Stunky and Pawniard, which can trap and remove troublesome Psychic-types from play (though both of these Pokemon exacerbate Tentacool's Ground weakness). Pokemon that appreciate having the Pokemon that Tentacool tends to lure, specifically Ghost-types and bulky Water-types, eliminated are good partners, such as Choice Scarf Mienfoo, which also appreciates having Tentacool remove Fairy-types. If Rapid Spin is run, Pokemon that dislike entry hazards are good partners for Tentacool. Ponyta and Larvesta both fall into this category, and both can sponge some of the physical hits Tentacool hates, as well as synergize with it offensively. If Acid Spray is run, Pokemon that can set hazards are good partners because of the switches Acid Spray forces. Lastly, Snivy and Pumpkaboo-XL are both good partners because they deal with Diglett. Snivy can use Glare to paralyze faster Pokemon, helping Tentacool do more damage, and Pumpkaboo-XL can burn the physical attackers Tentacool hates.</p>"

  "Geodude": {
    "overview": "<p>Geodude is a solid SturdyJuice Stealth Rock lead, with powerful STAB attacks, a base 100 Defense, and a base 80 Attack. It has poor Speed, but it is able to bypass this with Sucker Punch. However, Geodude fulfills a role that many other Pokemon do. Drilbur can also set Stealth Rock, and can remove them as well and is faster and more powerful. Geodude, however, has a Rock / Ground typing, which allows it to have two different viable STAB attacks. Geodude also faces competition from Onix and Bonsly. Geodude has Counter, Sucker Punch, and more power than Onix, but doesn't have as much Speed and doesn't get Taunt. Because of its typing, Geodude gets STAB Earthquake over Bonsly, but also is weaker to Water-, Grass-, and Ice-type attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Geodude has access to the elemental punches, which allow it to get around certain Pokemon. It also gets Explosion, which can be used on a suicide lead set. This is unwise to run, as Explosion often won't deal a lot of damage and the moveslot required would be much better used doing something else. Geodude has access to Rock Polish, which gives it the potential to sweep teams, although it's heavily outclassed as a sweeper by more offensive Pokemon, such as Tirtouga and Drilbur. Also, Stone Edge and Rock Slide are two powerful Rock-type STAB moves with their own merits the Geodude can use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water- and Grass-type Attacks</strong>: Both Water- and Grass-type Pokemon take neutral damage from Stealth Rock and hit Geodude with 4x super effective attacks that can easily OHKO, assuming that Sturdy has been broken.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Most Fighting-types carry Knock Off and some super effective move, namely Drain Punch or High Jump Kick, allowing them to easily take Geodude out in two turns.</p> <p><strong>Utility</strong>: Fake Out and Knock Off make survival for Geodude a serious problem, as they break Sturdy and remove Berry Juice, respectively. Taunt and Encore stop Geodude from functioning properly, hindering how well it can support a team. Defog and Rapid Spin remove Geodude's Stealth Rock, effectively ruining its use.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker</strong>: An Earthquake from Drilbur or Cranidos bypasses Sturdy and OHKOes Geodude, often preventing it from even getting up Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stealth Rock Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock deals damage to Pokemon switching in, so it is helpful for breaking Sturdy and Focus Sash on some Pokemon and assuring important OHKOs or 2HKOs against other Pokemon. Sucker Punch can get the surprise priority hit on a lot of Pokemon, but Counter can be used to take out opposing Pokemon, especially Fighting-types, that try to take out Geodude in one hit. Earthquake is a powerful Ground-type STAB move that helps Geodude get around Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon. Rock Blast is a powerful STAB move that hits Flying-types such as Fletchling extremely hard. It also hits multiple times, allowing it to bypass Substitutes, Sturdy, and Focus Sash.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment allows Geodude to be as big a threat as possible, with max Defense increasing survivability. These HP EVs bring Geodude to 21 HP, so Berry Juice will always reset Sturdy. Sturdy and Berry Juice work together to allow Geodude to survive at least two hits, with the exception of abnormal situations such as Mold Breaker.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Stealth Rock should almost always be used first, as the earlier entry hazards are set up the more effect they can have. However, if the opponent clearly intends to overpower Geodude physically, Counter can score you a free KO. Geodude is also really helpful mid-game, as it can tank several hits. For example, Geodude can take Fletchling's Acrobatics and attack back with a super effective Rock Blast.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fletchling and other sweepers enjoy entry hazard support, as it breaks Sturdy on certain Pokemon and easily turns 2HKOs into OHKOs. Foongus and other bulky Grass-types that can switch into Water- and Grass-type attacks help to keep Geodude alive and functional. Geodude doesn't appreciate entry hazards that break Sturdy, but it also doesn't like its own entry hazards being removed. As such, a Rapid Spin user, such as Drilbur or Staryu, helps to keep your side of the field clear while still keeping Geodude's hazards intact. Mold Breaker Drilbur is also useful for taking out opposing Sturdy + Berry Juice leads. Geodude also appreciates Ghost-types to block Rapid Spin and Pawniard to discourage the use of Defog.</p>"

  "Slowpoke": {
    "overview": "<p>With a unique typing and outstanding defensive stats, Slowpoke easily distinguishes itself as one of the tier's most solid walls. Its ability, Regenerator, gives it a unique niche that allows it to switch in and wall a multitude of threats without sustaining too much damage in the long run. This, coupled with Slowpoke's high HP and Defense, useful resistance to Fighting-type moves, and access to support moves such as Thunder Wave, Slack Off, and Scald, makes Slowpoke a very difficult wall to muscle past. Unfortunately, Slowpoke does have quite a list of weaknesses and a pitiful Special Attack stat, making it relatively easy to defend against. Still, its bulk and longevity make it one of the tier's best walls.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Slowpoke has a load of other options. Yawn can be used to put troublesome threats to sleep and force switches. It also makes Slowpoke difficult to switch into. Surf hits harder than Scald, but lacks the ability to burn. Slowpoke can use Zen Headbutt if it chooses to attack physically, as its Attack stat is a bit higher than its Special Attack. Slowpoke can also run a neat Trick Room set, and while it doesn't have the power to take advantage of the effect itself, Regenerate lets it switch in and out to set it up for teammates. Finally, Slowpoke can run Trick with a Choice item to try to catch a bulky foe off guard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: In general, Grass-types are the best answers to Slowpoke. They don't mind Scald or Psychic and can stomach paralysis. They can KO Slowpoke with Grass-type STAB attacks. However, certain Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Snover must watch out for Fire Blast, which will deal serious damage to them.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types are also scary. While they don't appreciate burns or paralysis, they can come in and Knock Off Slowpoke's Eviolite, removing much of its bulk and dealing tons of damage. Dark-types such as Carvanha and Pawniard can deal heavy damage with their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types are immune to Thunder Wave and don't mind sponging a few hits in order to KO Slowpoke. Chinchou is one of Slowpoke's best counters, as Thunder Wave heals it and it resists Scald. Chinchou can also use Heal Bell to heal its teammates of status inflicted by Slowpoke. Magnemite can easily switch in against Psychic and KO Slowpoke with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off is severely crippling to Slowpoke. Not only does it deal super effective damage, but it also removes Slowpoke's Eviolite, severely reducing its bulk.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Slowpoke in general doesn't mind Toxic, but it is a useful status condition to keep Slowpoke on its toes by putting a timer on it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Slowpoke's STAB attack of choice, being able to hit things decently hard and also potentially burn them. Slack Off is a reliable form of recovery, letting Slowpoke heal itself while continuing to wall the opposition. Thunder Wave can cripple offensive foes, making it easier for teammates to handle them later. Finally, Psychic is a secondary STAB move that hits the Fighting-types that Slowpoke walls for a fair amount of damage. As an added bonus, it also hits Poison-types, and can help deter them from trying to inflict status on Slowpoke. Fire Blast can also be used in the last slot to nail Steel-, Bug-, and Grass-types that give Slowpoke problems, making it harder to switch into.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set's main goal is to wall physical attackers and act as a bulky tank to support Slowpoke's team. A high Defense stat and Regenerator make Slowpoke a very solid Pokemon that can be difficult to KO and almost impossible to wear down. An alternative EV spread of 116 HP / 76 Def / 116 SpA / 196 SpD with a Careful nature allows Slowpoke to survive powerful Special attacks in exchange for some physical bulk. With Scald and Thunder Wave, Slowpoke can easily wall, cripple, and outlast loads of common powerhouses. Slowpoke's longevity and ability to switch in many more times than its opponents make it a long-lasting support Pokemon that can easily sponge attacks and cripple offensive sweepers. Its typing also helps it wall many Fighting-types, but the buff to Knock Off makes this slightly risky against certain Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr. In addition, Slowpoke's weaknesses to common attacking types and attacks such as Volt Switch and U-turn make it difficult to wall many common top-tier threats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because of its ability, Slowpoke can easily heal itself after most minor misplays. Despite this, Slowpoke shouldn't be used randomly. It should be used against physical attackers that can't reliably and continuously hit it super effectively. Once in, Slowpoke should cripple its opponent with either Scald or Thunder Wave. The EVs give Slowpoke a small boost in power, so Scald and Psychic will deal decent damage to anything they hit super effectively. If Slowpoke sustains too much damage or the opponent switches into a counter, Slowpoke can either heal itself with Slack Off or switch out and heal with Regenerator. Slowpoke should watch out for mixed attackers, as its Special Defense stat isn't very high and it is susceptible to repeated strong special STAB attacks. Slowpoke also has to watch out for Knock Off, which hits hard and cripples it by removing its Eviolite.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slowpoke can easily fit into a multitude of defensive cores since it doesn't fear switching out because of Regenerator. Grass-types are the best partners for Slowpoke, because they resist the Grass- and Electric-type attacks that Slowpoke is weak to, while Slowpoke resists the Fire- and Ice-type attacks that threaten them. Notable Grass-types include Foongus and Ferroseed. Fairy-types also work well with Slowpoke. They can absorb Dark- and Bug-type attacks while Slowpoke beats Poison-types, the Fairies' bane. Spritzee gets a special mention, as it can provide Aromatherapy and Wish support for Slowpoke, which Slowpoke really appreciates. In general, Pokemon that can handle Grass-, Electric-, and Dark-types are ideal partners for Slowpoke. Pawniard is notable, as it has good type synergy with Slowpoke and appreciates the paralysis support that Slowpoke provides. Vullaby, too, gets a special mention as it can easily wall many of the Pokemon that Slowpoke can't, such as Bellsprout and Scraggy. Together, they can handle most of the tier aside from Electric-types, forming a very solid core.</p>"

  "Magnemite": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnemite can fill a variety of roles and hit harder than almost all other special attackers in the Little Cup metagame. Thanks to Magnemite's access to Sturdy and Recycle, it is able to keep itself healthy while dealing great damage. This sets it apart from other special attackers in the tier, such as Abra, which relies on Focus Sash to survive a hit. Magnemite also has Analytic to help Choice Scarf sets hit harder when moving second. Magnemite also hits the 14 Speed tier without a Timid nature, allowing it to hold a Choice Scarf and outspeed the whole unboosted metagame. Its Steel / Electric typing gives it a lot of useful resistances, including those to Psychic, Flying, and Fairy. Magnemite's Flying-type resistance along with its ability to recover health makes it one of the best Fletching checks in Little Cup. Magnemite also has access to fantastic STAB moves in Volt Switch, Flash Cannon, and Thunderbolt.</p> <p>However, Magnemite heavily relies on its Berry Juice or Choice Scarf, and Knock Off can eliminate Magnemite's recovery or boosted Speed, respectively. Magnemite hits only 15 Speed with a positive nature, leaving it outsped by many of the popular Pokemon in Little Cup, such as Pawniard and Drilbur. Magnemite is also weak to Fighting, a very common offensive type in Little Cup.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magnemite has access to both Reflect and Light Screen, so it could run a dual screens set to support its team. Magnemite also has access to Rain Dance and Thunder, a set using which could be used on rain teams as a backup rain setter. Toxic can be used to attempt to stall foes while recovering HP with Berry Juice and Recycle. Finally, Choice Specs alongside Analytic makes Magnemite very powerful and hard to switch into.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chinchou:</strong> Due to Volt Absorb, Chinchou gains health when switching into Magnemite's Electric-type attacks, and Chinchou is 4x resistant to Steel. However, Hidden Power Grass or Ground can do some significant damage.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types:</strong> Ground-types can switch into Magnemite's Electric-type STAB moves and hit back with Earthquake. Drilbur bypasses Sturdy with Mold Breaker and can OHKO Magnemite. Diglett's Arena Trap prevents Magnemite from switching out, which can be particularly devastating if Magnemite is running Choice Scarf and it locked into an Electric-type move.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off:</strong> Magnemite greatly relies on its item; as such, removing Magnemite's item leaves it completely neutered.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types:</strong> Fire-types can switch into a predicted Flash Cannon and threaten Magnemite with a super effective Fire-type move or a burn, which is a huge problem for Berry Juice variants.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types:</strong> Fighting-types don't have the easiest time switching into Magnemite, but once they're in, they can cripple Magnemite with Knock Off, deal damage and regain health with Drain Punch, or predict a switch and use U-turn or, in Pancham's case, Parting Shot.</p> <p><strong>Ferroseed:</strong> Ferroseed takes significant damage from only the rare Hidden Power Fire and can set up entry hazards freely against Magnemite.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls:</strong> Walls such as Porygon, Lickitung, and Munchlax take very little damage from all of Magnemite's attacks and can heal off any damage taken.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards:</strong> Spikes and Stealth Rock will break Magnemite's Sturdy and leave it vulnerable to attacks that can OHKO it.</p>",

      "Sturdy + Berry Juice": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is Magnemite's primary STAB attack due to its ability to maintain momentum against Magnemite's checks and counters. Flash Cannon does decent damage to the Ground-types that come in expecting an Electric-type attack and hits Fairy-types for super effective damage. Recycle allows Magnemite to reuse its Berry Juice after consuming it, giving Magnemite reliable recovery. Endure allows Magnemite to survive an attack after its Sturdy is broken and trigger its Berry Juice, allowing it to regain Sturdy. Hidden Power Ground hits incoming Chinchou that expect an Electric-type attack, and for OHKOing opposing Magnemite without their Sturdy intact. Thunderbolt is a more powerful Electric-type STAB attack that won't force Magnemite out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Speed EVs allow Magnemite to reach 14 Speed with a neutral nature and outspeed threats such as Adamant Corphish, while the speed EVs maximize Magnemite's damage output. The extra EVs are put in Defense to increase Magnemite's physical bulk. When Magnemite is using Hidden Power Ground over Endure or Thunderbolt, it needs to run an EV spread of 240 SpA / 236 Spe, as Hidden Power Ground lowers Magnemite's Special Attack IVs, thus requiring 4 more EVs to get the Special Attack point. A Modest nature allows Magnemite to hit harder, while a Timid nature lets it avoid Speed ties with bulkier Chinchou, Jolly Corphish, and opposing Magnemite. Sturdy allows Magnemite to survive almost any move from full HP, which can give Magnemite semi-reliable recovery when paired with Berry Juice, Recycle, and Endure.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Magnemite should avoid switching in if there are entry hazards on your side of the field, as they will break Sturdy and leave it vulnerable to attacks that can OHKO it. Magnemite should avoid switching into Knock Off users such as Pawniard, because if Berry Juice gets Knocked Off, Recycle won't work anymore, leaving Magnemite without recovery. When you predict that the foe will attack when Magnemite's Sturdy is broken, Magnemite should use Endure to survive and regain it's lost HP with Berry Juice. Once Pokemon that resist or are immune to Electric have been removed, Magnemite can spam Volt Switch and give your team momentum more easily. Once it has lost Sturdy, Magnemite can switch into weaker or resisted attacks from foes that don't have Knock Off, such as Spritzee and Shellder.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon with U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Mienfoo, Chinchou, Larvesta, Fletchling, and Archen, can maintain momentum and form a VoltTurn core with Magnemite. Magnemite makes good teammates with Fighting-types in general due to its ability to switch into and defeat most Fairy-types. Both Foongus and Cottonee can easily switch into Chinchou and Ground-types, Pokemon that Magnemite struggles against. Diglett is also a great teammate, as it deals with Chinchou, trapping and KOing it with a super effective Earthquake. Magnemite loves having Pokemon that can switch into Fighting-types, such as Spritzee and Trubbish, the latter of which can also switch into Knock Off because of Sticky Hold. If Endure is chosen, Toxic Spikes support from Trubbish can slowly wear down your opponents team as you stall foes out by Recycling Berry Juice. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Drilbur, Staryu, Vullaby, and Archen is incredibly useful to ensure Magnemite's Sturdy is not broken. Pokemon that struggle against Fletchling, such as Mienfoo, Timburr, Croagunk, Foongus, and Cottonee, enjoy Magnemite's presence, as it has little trouble switching into Fletchling and taking any attack it has bar Overheat, which Magnemite can survive if it uses Endure at the right time.</p>"

Thunderbolt is more powerful than Volt Switch and doesn't force Magnemite out, which is great when attempting to sweep your opponent's team late-game. Hidden Power Ground hits Chinchou and opposing Magnemite for super effective damage, while Hidden Power Grass hits Chinchou and Ground-types, and is great for situations where your opponent has both as without Hidden Power Grass you are forced to predict.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With a Choice Scarf, Magnemite reaches 22 or 21 Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. The EVs maximize Magnemite's Special Attack and Speed. A Timid nature is used to outspeed Pokemon with 21 Speed and tie with boosted Scraggy and opposing Magnemite. A Modest nature maximizes Magnemite's damage output. Analytic lets Magnemite hit switch-ins harder, but Sturdy lets Magnemite survive almost any attack from full health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Locking Magnemite into an Electric-type move is a bad idea if your opponent has a Ground-type or Chinchou. Magnemite should avoid switching into Knock Off users, such as Pawniard, as losing its Choice Scarf eliminates its revenge killing capability. Use your other teammates to take out opposing Pokemon immune to Electric, thereby allowing Magnemite to gain momentum with Volt Switch more easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon with U-turn or Volt Switch such as Mienfoo, Chinchou, Larvesta, Fletchling, and Archen, can maintain momentum and form a VoltTurn core with Magnemite.

Hidden Power Fighting is used to KO Pawniard, Ferroseed, and opposing Magnemite (be wary of Hidden Power Ground) after trapping them, which is the whole point of the set. Flash Cannon is a secondary STAB move with decent neutral coverage. Thunderbolt is a stronger Electric-type STAB move than Volt Switch. Thunder Wave can be used instead to paralyze fast threats such as Abra and Gastly. Toxic wears down Porygon and Chinchou.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs let Magnemite survive a Knock Off followed by a Sucker Punch from Eviolite Pawniard after Stealth Rock, a Brick Break from Life Orb Adamant Pawniard after Stealth Rock, or a Hidden Power Fighting from Life Orb Abra. The Special Attack EVs allow Magnemite to KO standard Eviolite Pawniard most of the time with Hidden Power Fighting. Magnemite uses Magnet Pull to trap Steel-types such as Pawniard, Ferroseed, and opposing Magnemite. Eviolite is used to make Magnemite way bulkier and avoid an OHKO from Life Orb Pawniard's Brick Break. You can run Choice Scarf with 240 SpA / 240 Spe to be less weak to Diglett.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Magnemite as a slow pivot, since its low base Speed plus Volt Switch are really good for this job. Use Magnemite to revenge kill Pawniard; don't switch it in directly. However, you can switch it directly into Ferroseed to trap it. Don't switch into Volt Switch or U-turn if your opponent has Diglett.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fletchling and Vullaby are good teammates because they can use U-turn to bring in Magnemite versus Pawniard, enabling it to trap it with Magnet Pull and KO it with Hidden Power Fighting. Flying-types such as Doduo and Fletchling and Fairies such as Spritzee appreciate Magnemite's help a lot, since its ability to trap Pawniard makes their job way easier. Both Corphish and Omanyte like Magnemite as a partner due to its ability to trap Ferroseed, a big counter to them. Frail Pokemon such as Gastly and Abra appreciate Magnemite's slow Volt Switch to get them into play safely. A Chinchou and Ground-type switch-in such as Snivy helps a lot, since Magnemite is really weak to both. Shellder heavily appreciates Magnemite's help to trap Pawniard and other Steel-types, which are the main checks to it. Entry hazard setters such as Dwebble are a big help, since Magnemite need a bit of damage to KO some variants of Eviolite Pawniard.</p>"

  "Seel": {
    "overview": "<p>While Seel's stats suggest that it'd perform best as a special wall, its general lack of support options leaves it outclassed by other bulky Water-types such as Chinchou. Seel's best niche is as a Perish Trapper, and while the strategy is sometimes regarded as gimmicky, Seel is the best option in Little Cup to pull it off. Seel also has a surprisingly good offensive movepool that includes several priority moves. However, it faces stiff competition from more powerful Water-types such as Carvanha and Corphish. With this in mind, it should be played to its advantages, which include better coverage moves, Fake Out, and higher bulk. Overall, while Seel faces serious competition from other Water-types in Little Cup, it can fill very specific niches that just might fit your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Seel can make use of a few other support options such as Encore, Disable, and Toxic. Ice Shard is another priority option, but it's not terribly useful. Iron Tail can be used to 2HKO Spritzee, but its low accuracy is an issue. A full special attacking set with Surf, Ice Beam, Signal Beam, and Hidden Power Fire is an option, but Seel is heavily outclassed by other special attackers. Finally, Stockpile can be used to boost Seel's defenses, but lack of recovery outside of Rest limits its potential.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mienfoo</strong>: Bulky Mienfoo isn't 2HKOed by Waterfall and can recover lost health with Drain Punch and Regenerator. It also has U-turn to escape from the Perish Trapper set.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types can easily switch into Seel thanks to their Water resistance. Ferroseed works particularly well because it can punish Seel's contact moves with Iron Barbs, and it only takes neutral damage from Icicle Spear. Cottonee can lock Seel into a non-threatening move with Encore, but should be wary of switching in on Icicle Spear.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: While they have trouble switching into Seel's attacks, most notably Drill Run, Electric-types such as Magnemite, Elekid, and Chinchou threaten Seel with their STAB moves and can Volt Switch out of the Perish Trapper set.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Perish Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Whirlpool allows Seel to trap the opposing Pokemon. Perish Song then puts a three turn counter on both Seel and the foe. The other two moves, Rain Dance and Rest, allow Seel to set up rain and return to full health and instantly wake up due to Hydration. Rain Dance can also be used for team support, ensuring Seel isn't dead weight versus hyper offense and VoltTurn teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Bold nature and the given EV spread maximize Seel's overall bulk, allowing it to easily trap weaker defensive threats. Hydration lets Seel heal itself with Rest and wake up instantly in the rain. Eviolite maximizes Seel's bulk, but Berry Juice can give Seel more turns to set up and successfully pull off a Perish Trap.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Seel should execute its moves in a specific order: Whirlpool, followed by Perish Song, Rain Dance, Rest, then switch. This allows it to trap certain defensive threats such as Spritzee, Koffing, and Lickitung and escape unscathed. It's important to note that if Seel switches out before two turns have ended, Whirlpool's trapping effect ends and the foe can switch out. Seel struggles to trap most offensive Pokemon, so it should stick to trapping defensive threats. If you find yourself up against a team where Seel is unable to trap any opposing Pokemon without being 2HKOed, use it as a Rain Dance setter instead and have some teammates ready to take advantage of the rain.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Seel is able to both remove walls and provide Rain Dance support, so sweepers that have Swift Swim or are strong Water-types, such as Omanyte, Carvanha, and Anorith, make for good offensive teammates. Fighting-type sweepers such as Scraggy and Timburr are also good teammates, as they appreciate that Seel can remove Spritzee. Finally, Pokemon such as Lickitung and Spritzee can provide cleric support for Seel in the case that it is heavily damaged or asleep from using Rest outside of rain.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fake Out provides chip damage, while Aqua Jet is a second priority move that has good revenge killing potential alongside Fake Out. Waterfall is Seel's strongest physical STAB move and should be used to hit bulkier foes. Drill Run 2HKOes Croagunk and Chinchou, which are two common switch-ins to Seel. Keep in mind that Chinchou can still outspeed and Volt Switch out to a more favorable matchup. Icicle Spear allows Seel to potentially OHKO Grass-types such as Foongus and Cottonee.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb is required to maximize Seel's offensive potential. Thick Fat is a rather lackluster ability considering Seel already resists Fire and Ice, but it's more useful than Seel's other abilities. The given EV spread and an Adamant nature maximize Seel's Attack while also giving it some bulk. Seel doesn't need any Speed investment, although you can run 236 Speed EVs if you want to tie with other 14 Speed Pokemon. HP investment would cause Seel to take 3 damage from Stealth Rock instead of 2, so it should be left alone.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While Seel's Fake Out is weak compared to other users such as Aipom and Meowth, the Fake Out + Aqua Jet combo serves as a nice tool for revenge killing weakened threats. Seel can even take out certain threats such as Abra and Berry Juice Archen that are at full health while only taking Life Orb recoil in the process. With the defensive investments, Seel is able to tank some powerful attacks with HP to spare for Life Orb recoil, such as Pawniard's Knock Off and Fletchling's Acrobatics, allowing it to hit them with powerful attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-types such as Ponyta and Houndour can blast through the bulky Grass-types that trouble Seel. Ponyta in particular can also run Solar Beam to handle bulky Water-types, another problem for Seel. Bulky Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Foongus have excellent type synergy with Seel, easily tanking the Electric- and Grass-type moves that threaten Seel, while also taking on opposing Water-types.</p>"

Grimer also boasts access to the elemental punches, something Trubbish lacks. If you need a niche check to Spritzee and Pawniard, Grimer may have some use to you.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Grimer has a decent physical movepool that includes access to all of the elemental punches, though Fire Punch is generally the best choice. Ice Punch can be useful in hitting Archen and Ground-types harder, but Grimer has no business staying in on them anyway. Grimer can also employ Infestation to trap opponents and give another teammate an easy switch in. Finally, a mono-attack set with Rest, Sleep Talk, Curse, and Poison Jab can be used, but it is too easily walled by Steel-types. Memento can be used to cripple an opponent and help a sweeper such as Pawniard set up. Finally, Toxic can be used to wear down walls more quickly.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Drilbur and Hippopotas resist Gunk Shot and can hit back with a super effective STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Tirtouga, Archen, Omanyte, and Onix resist Gunk Shot, have good defenses, and can attack back with their STAB moves or a Ground-type coverage move.</p> <p><strong>Faster Psychic-types</strong>: Faster Psychic-types, especially Abra, can KO Grimer with their powerful STAB moves. Gothita is unique in that it can trap Grimer thanks to Shadow Tag and KO with a STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Pokemon such as Vullaby, Slowpoke, Shellos, and RestTalk Chinchou can take Grimer's attacks and heal off the damage taken.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gunk Shot is Grimer's most powerful attack, severely damaging anything that doesn't resist it. Fire Punch has very good coverage alongside Gunk Shot, mainly targeting Steel-types such as Pawniard, Magnemite, and Ferroseed. Shadow Sneak is helpful for bypassing Grimer's terrible Speed and makes picking off Pokemon such as Gastly easier. Thief can be used in the last moveslot to take a foe's item after Grimer's Berry Juice has been used. Pain Split can be used for the semi-reliable recovery it provides. Keep in mind, however, that Thief's coverage is nearly identical to that of Shadow Sneak.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs and nature guarantee that Grimer can beat most Pawniard variants one-on-one, as it can never be 2HKOed by Pawniard's Knock Off and can always 2HKO with Fire Punch. An Adamant nature is also useful for the higher chance to OHKO Spritzee after Stealth Rock damage. Berry Juice is for recovery and greatly increases Grimer's longevity. Also, if Thief is used, Grimer can steal the foe's item after using its own Berry Juice.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Grimer is best used as a check to Knock Off-spamming Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Pawniard, and Croagunk. However, Grimer cannot reliably check all forms of Pawniard, as Fire Punch does not always 2HKO Eviolite variants, therefore sometimes making it setup bait for Swords Dance Pawniard. Also, because Grimer is easily worn down due to its lack of recovery, try to use it sparingly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lickitung makes a good partner for Grimer, as it can spread paralysis, which Grimer appreciates, and provides Wish support to help Grimer stick around for a bit longer. Lickitung can also check specially offensive Pokemon, mainly Psychic- and Ghost-types through its bulk and typing. In turn, Grimer can switch in on Fighting-type attacks aimed at Lickitung. Grimer appreciates Dark- and Flying-types such as Pawniard and Vullaby to switch in on Psychic- and Ground-type attacks, respectively. Finally, because Grimer often has a tough time taking on Ghost- and Psychic-types, Pursuit support from Pokemon such as Pawniard is appreciated.</p>"

A decent ability in Insomnia also makes it a great counter to Foongus. Furthermore, Drowzee has a decent movepool with support and attacking options such as Thunder Wave and Shadow Ball. However, Drowzee is slow, very passive, and weak to the common Knock Off, causing it to lose momentum. In addition, Drowzee is reliant on Wish for recovery, making it more vulnerable to status and taking up an additional moveslot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Drowzee can make use of its decent physical movepool with options such as Zen Headbutt, Drain Punch, and the elemental punches. However, most of these options are weak coming off of Drowzee's low Attack. Shadow Ball is useful for hitting Abra for much more damage than Psychic, but it is useless outside of that. Due to its low Speed, Drowzee makes for a decent Trick Room setter; however, it is too weak to take advantage of Trick Room itself. Counter hits physical attackers targeting Drowzee's lower Defense. Hypnosis can cripple foes with sleep but is very inaccurate. Finally, Drowzee has access to many setup moves, including Calm Mind, Nasty Plot, and Belly Drum, but it isn't fast enough to use these effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Pawniard and Vullaby are immune to Psychic and can threaten to OHKO Drowzee with their STAB Knock Offs, but they do not like being paralyzed. Scraggy can set up on Drowzee and does not mind Thunder Wave thanks to Shed Skin.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Cottonee can completely shut down Drowzee while not taking much from its weak Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: While Drowzee does not particularly mind paralysis, burns and poison can be especially debilitating, since Drowzee's reliance on Wish for recovery makes the passive damage add up quickly.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Gastly can force Drowzee out with the threat of a super effective STAB Shadow Ball, but they are crippled by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers such as Corphish can target Drowzee's average Defense with super effective attacks such as Knock Off.</p>",

Eviolite boosts Drowzee's Defense and Special Defense by 50%.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Drowzee's fantastic special bulk and Insomnia to switch into powerful special attackers such as Abra and Skrelp or into sleep inducers such as Foongus. If you think the opponent will switch to a counter, such as Pawniard, use Thunder Wave to cripple the counter as it switches in. Avoid Knock Off users, as Drowzee will take severe damage from them and lose its Eviolite, which it needs to effectively check the threats it wants to check. Drowzee can be a momentum sink; thus, it is best used on bulkier teams that don't mind the momentum loss it causes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull can absorb Knock Off for Drowzee while Drowzee beats Poison-types for them.

Its Attack stat is one of the highest in the tier, only falling behind Archen and Cranidos. It also has access to Swords Dance and Agility, two excellent boosting moves that allow Krabby to easily sweep unsuspecting teams with its wide coverage. Some of Krabby's downsides, however, are its low Special Defense and HP, making it unable to go toe to toe with most special attackers. Ferroseed and most other Grass-types in Little Cup can easily switch in on any of Krabby's moves, bar Superpower, and proceed to set up entry hazards or afflict it with a status ailment.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Life Orb set can be viable because it doesn't require any setup and excels at wallbreaking, but it lacks the Speed provided by Agility or Choice Scarf. Rock Slide can be used on either set in conjunction with Sheer Force; however, this isn't very practical due to Rock Slide being the only notable physical move that Sheer Force benefits from. If you do decide to use Sheer Force and Rock Slide, replace Return with Body Slam for the additional power. X-Scissor is a nice coverage move, but most of the Grass-type Pokemon in Little Cup are hit neutrally by Bug-type attacks due to their secondary typing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Krabby is walled by all of the common Grass-types in Little Cup, notably Cottonee, which can Encore Krabby's boosting moves, and Ferroseed, which is incredibly difficult for Krabby to break through, even with Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types, particularly Chinchou due to its Water-type resistance, can OHKO Krabby with a STAB move. Magnemite can also switch into any move but Knock Off, providing it still has Sturdy intact.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status moves also severely hinder Krabby's capabilities as a sweeper and wallbreaker. Burn and paralysis cripple it and even Toxic damage can be bothersome when trying to set up two moves and then sweep.</p> <p><strong>Frillish and Slowpoke</strong>: Frillish and Slowpoke are fantastic counters to any Krabby not running Knock Off, and they can easily burn it or paralyze it, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Croagunk</strong>: Croagunk can switch into anything, only taking neutral damage from Return or Body Slam.</p>",

Crabhammer is Krabby's only physical STAB move and hits everything that doesn't resist it for a solid chunk of damage, while its only downside is the 90% accuracy. Knock Off can be used to cripple opposing walls and hit Slowpoke, Frillish, and Ferroseed, while Return has more Base Power and can hit anything, with the exception of Rock- and Steel-types. Hyper Cutter is the preferred ability, as it allows Krabby to break through Snubbull and switch into a nicely predicted Memento unscathed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs allow Krabby to outspeed most common Choice Scarf users after an Agility, and while 116 Speed can be beneficial to outspeed Choice Scarf Mienfoo and Chinchou, bulk is generally better. 12 Speed, after an Agility boost, lets Krabby outspeed the common Shell Smash Tirtouga. Eviolite is the preferred item so that Krabby can set up on opposing Pokemon that could otherwise threaten it with an OHKO; however, Berry Juice can be used against weaker Pokemon to ensure some recovery. If you decide to use Berry Juice, keep in mind that Krabby will most likely get KOed by many special moves, especially super effective ones, rendering the item useless. An Adamant nature gives Krabby more power, and there are no notable Pokemon that can hit 30 Speed and threaten Krabby.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch into something that Krabby can reliably check and proceed to set up either Swords Dance or Agility as they switch out. Swords Dance allows Krabby to power through walls with ease, while Agility is more useful for dealing with faster threats. Krabby is most successful when the opponent's major priority users and bulky Grass-types have fainted, as Krabby lacks priority moves itself and has no reliable way to hit Pokemon such as Foongus and Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Team options</h4> <p>Krabby really appreciates entry hazard support so that can it power through bulkier Pokemon. It also appreciates Defog or Rapid Spin support so that it can reliably take a hit while setting up. Grass-type Pokemon make great partners due to their key resistances to Electric- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Krabby; Ferroseed is a notable choice because it can also lay down hazard support.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Crabhammer is Krabby's main STAB move and is usually the prime option when revenge killing an opponent's Pokemon. Knock Off allows Krabby to severely cripple bulky Pokemon. Superpower is Krabby's best option to deal with Pawniard and Ferroseed, which can hit it hard and remove its Choice Scarf or otherwise completely wall it, respectively. Return is a nice, neutral-coverage move, and without it, Krabby is walled by Dry Skin Croagunk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>These EVs allow Krabby to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and revenge kill successfully. An Adamant nature can be used if you crave more power, but this causes Krabby to Speed tie with a lot of common threats. A Jolly nature will outspeed common Choice Scarf Pokemon and Scraggy after a Dragon Dance, but you forgo the added power which can make a big difference when it comes to KOing an opposing Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Krabby is a great revenge killer and is best utilized in the mid- and late-game once the opponent's team is weakened, so it is guaranteed some KOs and does not have to worry about retaliation. Unfortunately, Krabby has no priority moves, so removing priority users before attempt to KO or sweep is a must. Krabby also lacks a pivot move, such as U-turn, and an item-switching move, such as Trick, which many other Choice Scarf users have access to, making it even more important that Krabby is used as a revenge killer or to clean up in the late-game. Also, do not switch into any special moves, especially Grass- and Electric-type attacks, because Krabby has a subpar Special Defense stat and an average HP stat and will likely be OHKOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Krabby appreciates hazard support as it makes it easier to power through bulkier Pokemon. Defog or Rapid Spin support is also really helpful, as it helps Krabby retain HP so that it can take a hit while setting up. Grass-type Pokemon make great partners due to their key resistances to Electric- and Grass-type attacks; Ferroseed is especially notable, because it can also provide hazard support. Chinchou can also absorb Electric-type attacks. Krabby also benefits from a teammate that can handle common priority users, such as Fletchling and Spritzee, as priority can interfere with its sweeping.</p>"

  "Voltorb": {
    "overview": "<p>Voltorb is a unique Pokemon, though it is really only useful for its high Speed. It has quite a shallow movepool, but has enough moves to work well in several roles, but the only role in which it truly shines is as a Taunt user. Whenever you see Voltorb, which is not exceedingly often, it will likely run Taunt. Voltorb is quite frail. However, it shouldn't need to take many hits because it can revenge kill almost the entire metagame, thanks to its workable Special Attack which lets it run offensive sets as well as support sets, though these are less viable because Elekid outclasses Voltorb in every aspect but Speed. It can be devastating with a Life Orb. Voltorb's three abilities are all very interesting and varied. All in all, Voltorb can be a potent status user or an attacker that pulls its weight, but prospective users should be wary of its flaws.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Voltorb could try to run Hidden Powers besides Ice to get coverage on Steel-types, but Hidden Power Ice is generally superior. Charge Beam is a nice way for Voltorb to increase its Special Attack, and can do significant damage after a few boosts. A set built around the use of the move would be interesting and unexpected, but might be difficult to pull off. Sucker Punch is an acceptable answer to Choice Scarf users that might outspeed Voltorb.</p> <p>Many different items can be used effectively with Voltorb, notably Air Balloon and Choice Specs. Voltorb can also run Thief effectively due to its high base Speed. A set featuring Substitute and Berry Juice can be very effective. Light Screen is always a useful option for a lead that can learn it, and Voltorb appreciates the boost to Special Defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: With its high Speed and low defenses, Voltorb badly wants to outspeed its opponents, but many foes are faster when they equip a Choice Scarf. Voltorb could carry Protect to scout for this. Voltorb must be especially wary of Ground-type Choice Scarf users.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Voltorb can't handle anything that can stomach an attack from it. This includes Chinchou and anything else that resists Ice-type attacks and is neutral to Electric-type attacks. Lileep is also a powerful check to Voltorb.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Voltorb's only true counters besides Chinchou are Ground-types. Voltorb has such a hard time dealing with them, especially on the lead set, that it's generally a good idea to support Voltorb with Shellder or another strong Ice-, Water-, or Grass-type to assist it. Once those are eliminated, Voltorb has almost no hope against Ground-types. Its Hidden Power Ice can provide only fleeting coverage.</p>",

However, it's too unreliable to be used without rain, so be sure to have Rain Dance up before you use the move. Volt Switch is an effective switching move, especially when coupled with STAB. It is useful in many situations and can to ensure Voltorb's survival in tight spots. Taunt is a good choice to counter the opponent's lead and status Pokemon, and can also stop boosting sweepers in their tracks. It is especially useful against entry hazard users such as Dwebble, as well as being Voltorb's only real niche over Elekid. However, it's next to useless against anything else and Thunder Wave can be used instead.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Static is a useful ability in any situation, and offers a decent paralysis chance and that can cripple enemies. Aftermath can be equally useful by damaging defensive checks to Voltorb that manage to knock it out. Item-wise, a Damp Rock is almost mandatory for anything running Rain Dance. Eviolite should be used to bolster Voltorb's pitiful defenses in lieu of rain. The latter item prevents many OHKOs, notably from Choice Scarf users such as Pawniard and Mienfoo. The given EV spread allows Voltorb to deal significant damage and, with a Timid nature, to outspeed almost the entire metagame.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is useful as a support lead and can deal serious damage to boot. Use the Rain Dance variant on rain teams as a Rain Dance user and a rain sweeper. The Eviolite variant is an excellent status lead on any team. Voltorb's tremendous Speed allows it to revenge kill quite a few Pokemon, as well as to outspeed and KO some other common leads.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set can't run Hidden Power Ice, so an Ice- or Grass-type is welcome to deal with Ground-types. Grass also resists Electric, so a Fire- or Flying-type helps as well. Even a Bug-type might be helpful, and might also be used to counter the many Psychic-type special walls that check this set. Of course, anything with an ability boosted by rain also benefits from this set.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Taunt is one of Voltorb's niches and is always an extremely useful move in LC. It's also the only thing offensive Voltorb has on Elekid. Thunderbolt is Voltorb's only reliable high Base Power STAB special attack, and is Voltorb's main means of sweeping. It will deal a sizable chunk of damage to many Pokemon with a Life Orb. Hidden Power Ice is Voltorb's source of coverage on the two types that resist Electric: Ground and Grass. It's moderately powerful with the boosting items that can be used with this set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Static is a powerful ability that can provide Voltorb with the capability to spread paralysis even with only offensive moves. Aftermath can be quite nice as well, making a revenge kill by a teammate much more likely. Life Orb increases Voltorb's damage output. HP IVs are reduced to 1 in order to limit Life Orb recoil while maintaining Hidden Power Ice. The same EV spread as used on the first set is advised here, and it is equally useful because it allows Voltorb to outspeed and OHKO or 2HKO most of the metagame. Timid allows Voltorb to hit 20 Speed and outrun almost every other unboosted Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Voltorb is an effective attacker and one of very few decent Electric-types in LC. It can be used as a special attacker on any team needing some Electric-type coverage. The Choice Specs variant of this set can be used as a powerful pivot, and with the right switching, pairs well with a different Life Orb user such as Abra. Feel free to attach a Choice Scarf to this set as well, as it allows Voltorb to outspeed the entirety of LC, even other Choice Scarf users.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Some defensive allies, like such as Tirtouga and Koffing, are helpful to this set. Voltorb's pitiful defenses need some backup. Attackers to counter Rock- and Steel-types are also welcome, because this set can't handle those very well. For the Life Orb set, something with U-turn to build a VoltTurn core is useful. As mentioned previously, Abra is also very useful.</p>"

  "Exeggcute": {
    "overview": "<p>Exeggcute's unique Grass / Psychic typing is both a blessing and a curse, granting it seven weaknesses and six resistances. Harvest and Chlorophyll are great abilities that work well on sun-based teams, and the sun also grants Exeggcute recovery options that allow it to fill a niche in Little Cup. It has also good Defense and Special Attack, allowing it to function offensively and defensively. Exeggcute does have several limitations, however. It is beaten by the ever-present Knock Off and U-turn, its lackluster Speed and Special Defense leave it prey for most special attackers, and it is somewhat outclassed by Pokemon such as Trubbish and Cottonee because they have more reliable recovery.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Exeggcute has several other viable options, but typically they are outclassed or just ineffective. It can utilize a Chlorophyll set, but is generally outclassed by Pokemon like Deerling, Bulbasaur, and Bellsprout. Sludge Bomb is a way to deal with Cottonee and Spritzee. Synthesis can provide a quick and easy way to regain HP, but Exeggcute has so many other recovery options that it is not worth the turn or moveslot. Toxic can wear down other Pokemon faster in the long run than Leech Seed, but doesn't provide the recovery that Leech Seed does. Stun Spore can cripple foes for the match, but doesn't give Exeggcute a chance to immediately set up properly like Sleep Powder. Starf Berry can be run over Oran Berry on the Harvest set to boost repeatedly and turn Exeggcute into a formidable sweeper on its own, but if you don't get the right stat boosts all the effort will be a waste. Similarly, Lum Berry can be used with Rest to provide instant full recovery in a single turn multiple times, but this gives the opponent the opportunity to bring in a check when Exeggcute could have just set up a Substitute or used Sleep Powder instead. Leaf Storm can be run as a harder hitting attack, but the Special Attack decrease afterwards is not appreciated. Explosion can be used in conjunction with Trick Room to bring in a Trick Room sweeper unscathed, but like all Trick Room setters it should only be used on a dedicated Trick Room team. Lastly, dual screens can be set up reliably due to Exeggcute's high Defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Vullaby</strong>: Vullaby is immune to Sleep Powder, resists both of Exeggcute's STAB moves, takes nothing from Hidden Power Fighting, and hits back super effectively with STAB Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Pokemon like Houndour, Vullaby, and Pawniard all take little to no damage from Giga Drain, and are immune to Psychic. They force a switch or KO with most of their moves, while Exeggcute is virtually helpless without Hidden Power Fighting. Houndour also has access to Early Bird which allows it to wake up faster and KO quickly with a STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Not only is Knock Off super effective against Exeggcute, it also permanently gets rid of the Oran Berry that makes Harvest, and by extension Exeggcute, usable.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Fletchling, Archen, and Doduo can KO with STAB Acrobatics or Brave Bird, but must beware of taking damage on the switch from Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Houndour, Ponyta, and Larvesta can take advantage of the sun that is set up for Exeggcute, and can usually OHKO with a STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Any Bug-type will most likely KO Exeggcute due to its 4x weakness. Exeggcute also fears U-turn, a common pivot move on Pokemon like Mienfoo, Bunnelby, and Larvesta.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types like Pumpkaboo can come in on Exeggcute and then use Substitute to avoid Leech Seed and Sleep Powder. They can then proceed to set up, or just KO with a STAB Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Without Hidden Power Fire, Grass-types wall Exeggcute, as they can't be put to sleep or Leech Seeded, and Exeggcute cannot survive many super effective moves. However, Grass / Poison-types like Foongus and Bulbasaur should be wary of Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Sound-based Moves and Infiltrator</strong>: Though they are rare, moves that go through Substitute, such as Noibat's Air Slash or Hurricane, Zubat's Brave Bird or U-turn, and Joltik's Bug Buzz, hurt a lot.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Harvest Abuser": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute lets Exeggcute safely abuse Harvest, giving it a nearly-unlimited supply of Oran Berries. Sleep Powder allows a free Substitute and also disables a single Pokemon for a short period of time. Predicting a switch is also a good opportunity to use Sleep Powder, set up a Substitute and attack, or set up a Leech Seed. Alternatively, Leech Seed can be used to wear down walls and provide even more recovery on top of Oran Berry and Giga Drain. Giga Drain provides a way of dealing damage while also providing some recovery, and is the primary STAB attack. Psychic is the secondary STAB move and can deal reliable damage to Fighting- and Poison-types that may want to use Knock Off, U-turn, or a Poison-type move. Hidden Power Fighting or Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Pawniard and other Steel-types on the switch or while behind a Substitute, as otherwise these Pokemon can effortlessly switch in and OHKO Exeggcute with Knock Off. Additonally, Hidden Power Fire hits Bug- and Grass-types for super effective damage, preventing Ferroseed from walling Exeggcute. Protect is another option, but should only be used in conjunction with Leech Seed to safely restore more HP.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Speed EVs allow Exeggcute to Speed tie with Tirtouga before a Shell Smash. The 80 Special Defense EVs boost Exeggcute's poor Special Defense, giving it some much needed bulk. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Defense and Special Attack to bolster its two best stats. The combination of Harvest and Oran Berry gives Exeggcute unlimited recovery as long as it isn't hit with a move that can KO it while a Substitute isn't up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Exeggcute needs sun to function effectively, as sunlight gives it a 100% chance of recovering its Oran Berry with Harvest. Exeggcute also appreciates a slow pivot, which allows it to get into battle unscathed. Exeggcute likes to set up Substitutes against Pokemon that typically cannot harm it, like Chinchou, and against Pokemon that are inclined to set up, like Tirtouga and Omanyte. Leech Seed is a great recovery option that can also force switches, and such switch turns should be used to set up Substitute. Leech Seed works well in tandem with Exeggcute's other recovery options, such as Giga Drain and Oran Berry with Protect.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sun support is necessary to abuse Harvest. Vulpix can provide that support with Drought and can take Bug- and Ice-type moves well, while Exeggcute takes Water- and Ground-type moves for Vulpix in return. Pokemon that can come in on Pawniard and absorb Knock Off are also great partners. Exeggcute appreciates Stealth Rock, so a hazard setter like Onix or Dwebble is a good teammate. Additionally, Dwebble has access to Spikes which can further aid in racking up chip damage.</p>"

  "Cubone": {
    "overview": "<p>When holding its signature item, Thick Club, Cubone reaches 28 Attack without a positive nature. This, paired up with its wide array of coverage, and its signature move Bonemerang, which allows Cubone to break through the opponent's Focus Sash, Substitute, and Sturdy, makes Cubone one of the strongest attackers in Little Cup. Cubone also has very good physical bulk without Eviolite. However, all these positive traits are balanced out because Cubone is very slow, doesn't have a very good ability, and it has low special bulk. Cubone also requires support from Sticky Web, Trick Room, or Baton Pass to work properly. Lastly, the presence of Knock Off heavily hinders Cubone's sweeping capabilities because it needs its item to truly shine. Regardless of all this, with a bit a bit of support, Cubone could become an excellent sweeper for your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute or Swords Dance can replace Fire Punch. The former allows Cubone to take an incoming Will-O-Wisp, or Sucker Punch from Pawniard, while the latter gives Cubone even more power, ensuring its switch-ins don't survive a hit. If you're using either of these two options, it's recommended that you use Rock Slide for the third move slot for better coverage, and that you don't use these with Trick Room Cubone, as they will waste one of your sweeping turns. Bone Rush can be used over Bonemerang if you wish to beat Sturdy + Berry Juice users completely, although 2-3 hits from Bone Rush are always going to be weaker than 2 hits from Bonemerang, leaving this option outclassed. Earthquake can replace Bonemerang if you wish to have more accuracy, although you will forgo your ability to break through Substitute, Focus Sash, and Sturdy. Double-Edge can be used in conjunction with the ability Rock Head, replacing Fire Punch for a solid 120 Base Power move; unfortunately, this option lacks coverage. Cubone can use Stealth Rock, but you're better off using Cubone's great power and coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Koffing</strong>: Koffing is immune to Cubone's STAB thanks to Levitate and can cripple Cubone with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: If Cubone gets hit by Knock Off, it will lose its item, and thus its boosted Attack stat.</p> <p><strong>Aqua Jet Users</strong>: Aqua Jet from Life Orb Corphish can OHKO Cubone. Carvanha doesn't OHKO with Aqua Jet, but instead it can use Protect to nullify the Speed drop from Sticky Web and KO Cubone. Offensive Tirtouga can 2HKO with Aqua Jet but Cubone's use of Bonemerang means Tirtouga's going to be left at 1 HP after that, especially because +2 Aqua Jet only has a 6.3% chance to OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Strong Flying-types</strong>: Even though they can't switch in relatively safely because of Cubone's coverage, Flying-types can switch in without Sticky Web lowering their Speed. Doduo can do a number on Cubone with a Life Orb-boosted Brave Bird. Choice Specs Taillow can also take down Cubone with Boomburst.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: One of the biggest unexpected threats to Cubone is Choice Scarf Chinchou, which outspeeds and OHKOes Cubone with its Water-type STAB moves, even if Sticky Web is active. Choice Scarf Darumaka, Bunnelby, and Amaura can simply annihilate Cubone with their STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bonemerang is Cubone's STAB move of choice, breaking Focus Sash, Substitute, and besting Sturdy + Berry Juice users. Also, because of the damage rolls in Little Cup, it hits harder than Earthquake. For example, a Cubone using Earthquake might deal 16 damage 50% of the time and 18 damage the other 50% of the time, whereas Bonemerang will deal consistent damage of 9, meaning you'll be getting 18 damage most of the time, unlike with Earthquake. Knock Off rids Cubone's checks and counters of their Eviolites, so they will have a harder time switching in a second time. Rock Slide keeps Flying-types such as Fletchling, Archen, and Vullaby in check, although Thunder Punch also does this. Both of these moves have their own benefits; for instance, Rock Slide can OHKO Larvesta, while Thunder Punch can OHKO Mantyke. Fire Punch is used to hit Grass-types such as Cottonee, Chespin, and Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread listed gives Cubone as high Attack as it can possibly have, hitting 28 Attack while holding Thick Club. The Defense EVs allow Cubone to take less damage from Fletchling's Acrobatics, so that Cubone can land a Thunder Punch or Rock Slide more consistently. The Speed EVs leave Cubone with 14 Speed, which means that while Sticky Web is active, Cubone will be able to outspeed the whole unboosted metagame. Cubone can also be used on Trick Room teams with a spread of 116 HP / 196 Atk / 76 Def / 116 SpD, a Brave nature, and 0 Speed IVs. With this spread, Cubone can switch into attacks more often.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cubone should avoid being hit by Knock Off, as it will instantly lose half of its sheer power. After Sticky Web is active, Cubone can be switched in on resisted hits or attacks it's immune to and begin to sweep. The big difference for teams using Cubone in Trick Room is that Cubone has limited turns to sweep; however, because it's bulkier, it's able to take strong attacks such as Abra's Psychic, Chinchou's Scald, Bunnelby's Return, and Corphish's Life Orb-boosted Aqua Jet. Due to this, Cubone is able to switch into most non-resisted hits and begin its sweep. Even without support from Sticky Web, Baton Pass, or Trick Room, it can often only switch into slow walls, but Cubone's power can force the opponent to switch out, allowing you to weaken their team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Either Surskit or Spinarak would be the first partners to look at, as they're the best Sticky Web users in the metagame. Croagunk is able to beat Corphish and Carvanha, which threaten Cubone with Aqua Jet, making it a solid partner. Drilbur and Psychic-types such as Abra and Gothita can KO Koffing, which also poses a threat for Cubone. Baton Passers such as Torchic may be used as partners to pass Speed boosts to Cubone. Pokemon that spread paralysis around the opposing team, such as Cottonee and Porygon, allow Cubone to outspeed the opposing team later on. For Trick Room, bulky Trick Room users such as Porygon and Spritzee make for good partners, as they don't share a weakness with Cubone.</p>"

  "Lickitung": {
    "overview": "<p>Lickitung is one of the bulkiest Pokemon in Little Cup, having 90 / 75 / 75 defenses. Lickitung's access to Wish and Heal Bell in conjunction with its bulk make it a great support Pokemon on defensive teams. Thanks to Lickitung's ability Oblivious, it cannot be infatuated or taunted; however, it isn't immune to Encore like Spritzee is. Lickitung also faces competition from Spritzee as a Wish passer and cleric and Munchlax and Porygon as a special wall. Lickitung also struggles against Fighting-types, which are common in Little Cup, and can often become setup bait for the foe.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lickitung has access to a huge physical movepool which includes the elemental punches, Dragon Tail, Power Whip, Aqua Tail, and Earthquake; however, Lickitung is too slow to be able to sweep. Lickitung's special movepool is also fairly huge but, sadly, contains nothing Lickitung can really use, except for Fire Blast, which can hit annoying Steel-types such as Ferroseed. Curse and Swords Dance are both decent setup moves for Lickitung. Curse can be used together with RestTalk and Dragon Tail, but the introduction of Fairies makes this less viable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Lickitung struggles with Fighting-types such as Scraggy, Mienfoo, Timburr, and Croagunk. Not only can they fire off super effective Fighting-type STAB moves, but they can also easily Knock Off Lickitung's Eviolite, greatly reducing its overall bulk.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off greatly reduces Lickitung's walling and support capabilities, so you should keep Lickitung away from Knock Off users.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Swords Dance Pawniard, Belly Drum Zigzagoon, and Shell Smash users, such as Omanyte and Tirtouga, can easily use Lickitung as setup bait.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wish Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish is useful for recovering health for teammates and makes it easier for them to switch in; it can also be used to heal Lickitung itself. Protect helps guarantee Wish recovery and allows Lickitung to scout the foe's attacks. Body Slam is a nice STAB attack and has a 30% chance to paralyze the foe. Return is also a viable alternative to Body Slam for additional power. Knock Off is great for removing items and allows Lickitung to be a good counter to Ghost-types such as Gastly. Heal Bell allows Lickitung to further support its teammates by curing status such as burns from Fire-types or Scald users.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite is the optimal item for providing more bulk, as Wish is already a continual and reliable source of recovery and greatly outclasses Berry Juice's one-time use. 236 EVs in Special Defense allows Lickitung to more easily take on special attackers such as Gastly, Abra, Porygon, Magnemite, and Chinchou. The special bulk is also needed to avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Gastly and Life Orb Abra after Stealth Rock damage, as with any less investment, it can't handle them with entry hazards up. Maximized HP EVs further improve Lickitung's special bulk and ensure that Lickitung's Wishes are as big as possible. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense to improve physical bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lickitung can switch into almost all unboosted non-Fighting-type attacks with ease. Therefore, keep Lickitung away from Fighting-types at all times and also watch out for Knock Off, as Lickitung's tanking capabilities are significantly reduced without Eviolite. Lickitung also needs to be careful to not end up being setup bait for threats such as Swords Dance Pawniard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spritzee can work well with and form an effective Wish-passing core with Lickitung, as they both cover each other's weaknesses. Snubbull, Koffing, and Cottonee appreciate having Lickitung as a partner for Wish support in particular and can take on the Fighting-types that beat Lickitung. Swords Dance Pawniard can easily use Lickitung as setup bait; therefore, a teammate that can stop Pawniard is strongly recommended. Both Timburr and Croagunk resist Sucker Punch while being able to hit Pawniard for massive damage with priority STAB Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, respectively. Croagunk is especially a great partner because it resists Fighting and enjoys Wishes from Lickitung. Trubbish also makes a good teammate for Lickitung, dealing with the Fighting-types that carry Knock Off with its combination of Sticky Hold, Berry Juice, and Recycle. Dark-types, such as Pawniard, Stunky, and Vullaby, can help Lickitung beat Ghost-types if it is not using Knock Off.</p>"

Rhyhorn also is a complete stop to Fletchling and Zigzagoon, which are both big threats in the metagame. However, Rhyhorn has a bad defensive typing, giving it a 4x weakness to Water- and Grass-type attacks. Rhyhorn also has terrible Special Defense and Speed, and has no recovery outside of the unreliable Rest.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rhyhorn has a bunch of other options at its disposal. Stone Edge can be used over Rock Blast for a higher damage output most of the time, but Stone Edge can't break through Substitute, and the chance to miss is significantly higher. Superpower hits very hard, but lowers Attack and Defense, the two stats Rhyhorn relies on. A more defensive set with Stealth Rock is viable, but is outclassed by Lileep. Rhyhorn has access to the elemental fangs, but they are very weak as they aren't boosted by STAB. Curse is an option to give Rhyhorn better tank-like abilities, but Rhyhorn fails to find the time to set up. Rhyhorn can tank most neutral physical hits well, so Counter is an option to gain some satisfying KOs. Roar works well with Stealth Rock, and slowly wears down the opponent. Rock Polish can be used to let Rhyhorn outspeed most threats, but is outclassed in almost every way by Shell Smash users, which can also hold an Eviolite or Berry Juice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types OHKO Rhyhorn with their STAB moves and they resist Rhyhorn's Ground-type STAB move, while Rhyhorn cannot do much back.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Omanyte and Tirtouga easily OHKO Rhyhorn.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types, namely Scraggy, can hit non-Eviolite Rhyhorn hard; they also resist Rhyhorn's Rock-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Drilbur</strong>: Although Drilbur is 2HKOed on the switch, it can threaten to 2HKO non-Eviolite Rhyhorn with Earthquake and spin away Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls can usually avoid the 2HKO from Rhyhorn and gradually wear it down.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock provides great utility and slowly wears down the opponent. Stealth Rock is an ideal move for Rhyhorn because of its enormous physical bulk and the large amount of opportunities Rhyhorn gets to set it up. Earthquake is a primary STAB move that hits most of the tier relatively hard. Rock Blast is the secondary STAB move, and it is used over Stone Edge and Rock Slide because it breaks through Substitute, which is rather common. Megahorn can hit Lileep and Slowpoke, while Drilbur and Hippopotas are hit super effectively by Aqua Tail.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs, factoring in Eviolite, increase the chance of surviving an Earthquake from Life Orb Drilbur and Life Orb Bunnelby. An Eviolite boosts Rhyhorn's defenses, making its Defense stat extremely high, and also boosts its mediocre Special Defense. Life Orb is an alternate item, but it wears Rhyhorn down and makes it more susceptible to attacks. An Adamant nature helps to maximize Attack. Any ability works, as Rhyhorn can not make use of any them as it lacks recoil moves and doesn't use special attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rhyhorn forces a lot of switches due to its great defenses and its ability to wall certain Pokemon, so predicting when to use certain attacks or Stealth Rock on a switch is something you should keep an eye out for. Although Rhyhorn's defensive typing isn't great, Rhyhorn can function as a pivot into Choice-locked Pokemon or Pokemon that can't do much to it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chinchou takes most Water-type attacks well for Rhyhorn. Ghost-types such as Gastly can spinblock and switch into Fighting-type moves which threaten Rhyhorn. Foongus resists Grass-, Water-, and Fighting-type moves which can potentially OHKO Rhyhorn, while Rhyhorn can cover Fire- and Flying-type attacks that threaten Foongus, making it a good partner for a defensive core. Fletchling threatens opposing Grass-types which threaten Rhyhorn.</p>"

  "Horsea": {
    "overview": "<p>Horsea is a potent sweeper thanks to its ability Swift Swim, which doubles its Speed in the rain, and its impressive Special Attack stat alongside strong attacks such as STAB Hydro Pump and Ice Beam, the former of which receives a boost in the rain. Although Horsea is very fast and powerful, it requires support from its teammates in order to sweep; as its Special Defense is lacking, it has difficulty setting up rain for itself, and despite how strong its attacks are, it won't be able to beat specially bulky foes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Horsea gets access to Focus Energy and Sniper, meaning that it can secure critical hits on all of its moves if it holds a Scope Lens, effectively giving it a 125% boost to its Special Attack. However, Horsea is much too frail to set up without support. Horsea can use Hidden Power Fire in order to take on Ferroseed, but it is weakened in the rain and the Hidden Power options listed will cover more foes. Agility can be used to let Horsea give itself a Speed boost; however, Horsea will receive the same increase from Rain Dance in addition to an increase in power to its Water-type moves. If Hydro Pump's accuracy is unappealing, Horsea can use Surf or Scald, but it really prefers the power of Hydro Pump to break past bulky walls. Clear Smog can be used to OHKO Cottonee after Stealth Rock damage, but it is almost never worth a moveslot, as Cottonee takes almost as much damage from Ice Beam. Horsea has access to Dragon Dance, but it's completely outclassed by Corphish at running a Dragon Dance set due to its lack of Attack, bulk, priority, and Knock Off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Chinchou and Magnemite can OHKO Horsea with their Electric-type STAB moves, although they must remain wary of Hidden Power Ground and Magnemite's Sturdy must not be broken.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Ferroseed resists all of Horsea's moves and is not OHKOed by Hidden Power Fire in the rain. Cottonee is bulky enough to survive an Ice Beam and OHKO Horsea with Giga Drain. It can also Encore Horsea into any other move, all of which Cottonee resists. Foongus can survive an Ice Beam and counter with Giga Drain, OHKOing Horsea and restoring a good portion of its health.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Pokemon with priority attacks such as Timburr and Fletchling can both finish off Horsea with their priority attacks if it is weakened, although Horsea is bulky enough to take weaker priority moves if it's healthy. Focus Sash Abra is also capable of revenge killing Horsea, particularly if the rain has ended. Vulpix can come in, cut Horsea's rain short, and OHKO it with Energy Ball.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Moves that affect Speed such as Tailwind or Thunder Wave provide a challenge, as Horsea is banking off of its ability to outspeed other Pokemon.</p>",

      "Swift Swim": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Horsea's STAB Hydro Pump deals enormous amounts of damage under rain, OHKOing bulky Mienfoo and Vullaby after Stealth Rock. Ice Beam provides great coverage alongside Hydro Pump, hitting Grass-types such as Pumpkaboo, Foongus, and Cottonee. Substitute prevents Horsea from being crippled by status and prevents Sucker Punch users such as Pawniard and Stunky from cutting Horsea's sweep short. Rain Dance can be used if Substitute isn't needed in order for Horsea to sweep. Hidden Power Ground hits Magnemite, Croagunk, and Chinchou, which are much more common than the Swift Swim users that Hidden Power Grass hits.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>200 Special Attack and 196 Speed EVs with a Modest nature allow Horsea to hit as hard and fast as possible, while the remaining EVs are invested in Defense, allowing Horsea to withstand some attacks. Life Orb boosts Horsea's damage output and will inflict minimal recoil with Horsea's 19 HP. Swift Swim doubles Horsea's Speed in the rain, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Make sure to get rid of Pokemon that could halt Horsea's sweep before starting rain. Bulkier Pokemon will need to have their items removed via Knock Off, and specially bulky foes will need to be significantly worn down. Horsea also needs as many turns in the rain as possible in order to secure some valuable KOs, including bulky Mienfoo, Timburr, and Vullaby after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Surskit, Riolu, Purrloin, Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Foongus are all capable Rain Dance setters. Mienfoo in particular is a great partner, as it can set up rain and use Knock Off, ridding bulkier foes of their items; it can also bring Horsea in safely with a slow U-turn. Chinchou and Staryu are also both valid users of Rain Dance, as they each enjoy rain-boosted Hydro Pump and accurate Thunder; Chinchou is able to come in on the Electric-type Pokemon that threaten Horsea, and bring Horsea in safely with a slow Volt Switch, while Staryu can provide Rapid Spin support. A Damp Rock can be used on rain setters with Prankster in order to increase the duration of the rain, but bulkier teammates such as Mienfoo and Foongus will appreciate having Eviolite more than Damp Rock. Ferroseed and Foongus are great counters to Chinchou, being able to switch into any of its moves and KO or cripple it if it doesn't switch out. They can also make for good switch-ins to Cottonee, which also threatens Horsea. Entry hazard users are useful, as the damage of Stealth Rock and Spikes helps soften Pokemon and breaks the Sturdy of foes such as Magnemite and Tirtouga. Other teammates that can utilize rain can help Horsea lay waste to teams with their powerful attacks. Anorith, Omanyte, and Mantyke are just some examples of offensive teammates that can be used in the rain.</p>"

  "Goldeen": {
    "overview": "<p>Goldeen's ability Lightning Rod alongside its Water typing lets it handle several Electric-types such as Magnemite, Chinchou, and Elekid incredibly well. It's one of the best Volt Switch stoppers in the metagame; not only is it immune to Volt Switch, but it also resists many common coverage moves carried by Electric-types and can threaten them back with Drill Run. Goldeen also has a wide variety of coverage options to take advantage of its good Attack and Speed with, such as Knock Off, Poison Jab, and Megahorn. However, Goldeen is prone to being worn down quickly by entry hazards, Life Orb recoil, and switching into resisted hits, limiting its time on the battlefield. Despite this, Goldeen is still a fairly effective hard stop to Volt Switch users.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aqua Tail is a more powerful option over Waterfall, giving Goldeen a better shot at muscling past bulkier foes, but it comes at the cost of some accuracy. Bounce, despite being easily played around, hits Fighting-types and Foongus harder than any of Goldeen's other moves and discourages them from switching into Goldeen. A mixed or special attacking set is an option to take advantage of Special Attack boosts from Lightning Rod. For example, a +1 Ice Beam hits many Grass-types harder than Megahorn or Poison Jab. However, these sets tend to be over-reliant on receiving boosts due to Goldeen's measly base 35 Special Attack. Hidden Power Fire can be run to hit Ferroseed, which doesn't really care about any of Goldeen's other attacks. However, it's still an incredibly weak move, struggling to 2HKO without significant investment and a Special Attack boost from Lightning Rod. A Swift Swim set is an option, but it's mostly outclassed by other Swift Swim users, and running Swift Swim means giving up Lightning Rod, which is one of Goldeen's defining traits.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Foongus can easily tank most of Goldeen's attacks and threaten back with their STAB moves. Foongus risks being 2HKOed by a Life Orb-boosted Knock Off followed by Megahorn, however.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Although Goldeen does sport a useful immunity to Thunder Wave, it is still quite vulnerable to other forms of status, such as burn, sleep, and paralysis from non-Electric-type attacks, as they will all severely hamper Goldeen's offensive presence.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Goldeen tends to get worn down quickly from switching into attacks, and its lack of reliable recovery doesn't help. The presence of entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes can further reduce its longevity.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Waterfall is a hard-hitting STAB move and is Goldeen's best option for breaking past bulky foes. Drill Run is a very important coverage move, as it threatens Electric-types such as Magnemite and Chinchou. Knock Off cripples bulky switch-ins to Goldeen, such as Foongus and Ferroseed. Poison Jab allows Goldeen to OHKO Cottonee and 2HKO Spritzee after Stealth Rock damage; however, Megahorn is an option to hit most Grass-types harder than Goldeen's other moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Goldeen's Attack and Speed EVs are maximized, allowing it to hit as hard and fast as possible. A Jolly nature is used so that Goldeen can hit 17 Speed. The remaining EVs give Goldeen a point in Special Defense to let it check special attackers better, especially Electric-types such as Magnemite and Chinchou. A Life Orb is the preferred item to maximize Goldeen's damage output. Using 0 HP IVs lowers Goldeen's HP to 19, so it only takes 1 damage from Life Orb recoil. Eviolite can be used instead to boost Goldeen's defenses, giving it more bulk and opportunities to switch in at the cost of some firepower. If using Eviolite, the HP IVs can be set to 31. The ability, Lightning Rod, is the main reason Goldeen has a niche; it turns Goldeen from just another mediocre Water-type to one of the best Electric-type counters in the metagame.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Goldeen should be sent in on Electric-types, as it hard walls them thanks to Lightning Rod. Goldeen can destroy most Electric-types one-on-one with Drill Run, but keep in mind that Electric-types without Hidden Power Grass are likely going to switch out of Goldeen anyway. Use this opportunity to predict the switch; Knock Off is a good catch-all move, removing the foe's item.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Goldeen is quite prone to being worn down quickly due to the amount of switching it does, as well as Life Orb recoil. Therefore, teammates that can remove entry hazards, such as Archen and Vullaby, are appreciated. In turn, Goldeen can handle Electric-types for these Pokemon. Fire-types such as Ponyta, Larvesta, and Vulpix make for good teammates, as they can easily break through Grass-types for Goldeen. Any Pokemon that appreciates a solid switch-in for Electric-types will enjoy having Goldeen as a partner; this includes nearly all Flying- and Water-types. Be sure to have a solid answer to Grass-types if pairing Goldeen with another Water-type. Clerics such as Spritzee and Lickitung pair well with Goldeen, as Goldeen hates all forms of status and often risks being burned by switching into Chinchou's Scald.</p>"

  "Eevee": {
    "overview": "<p>Eevee is outclassed in almost every way in the LC metagame; offensively, it does not hit as hard as Bunnelby and lacks coverage options, and defensively, it is generally outclassed by Lickitung as a support Pokemon because of its lack of bulk. However, Eevee finds a niche on teams that need a cleric and do not want to lose momentum thanks to its access to Baton Pass, which can give an ally a free switch in, and Adaptability, which allows it to be less passive than Lickitung.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam can be used over Return for its paralysis chance, giving Eevee a more supportive set, but doing so causes Eevee to lose out on a lot of its damage output, which is the primary reason to run Eevee over Lickitung. Substitute is a possible move to let Eevee pass Substitutes to its teammates, and Yawn can be used to force Eevee's switch-ins back out, but both are quite situational. Eevee can also run an attacking set using Quick Attack, Return, Bite, and Iron Tail. However, this set is completely outclassed by other offensive Normal-types, such as Bunnelby, as Eevee does not have the Speed or coverage to pull it off very effectively. Lastly, Eevee could be used to Baton Pass boosts, such as Work Up and Curse, but it lacks the bulk to pull off such a set well. Eevee should never use Last Resort.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Eevee has no way to hit Ghost-types, and thus can give them free setup or recovery opportunities, including giving Gastly free Substitutes and Honedge a free Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Most of the tier's Fighting-types, including Mienfoo, Timburr, and Scraggy, can force Eevee out, though less bulky Mienfoo variants have to be wary of Return + Quick Attack, which has a small chance of KOing them.</p> <p><strong>Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: Rock- and Steel-types are not bothered by Eevee's STAB moves. Ferroseed can switch into Eevee, damage it with Iron Barbs, and paralyze anything it tries to pass its Wishes to; Pawniard uses Eevee as setup bait; Onix is able to Taunt Eevee and set up entry hazards; and Tirtouga and other Shell Smash users can set up against Eevee easily.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users, including Mienfoo and especially those such as Onix that resist Eevee's one attacking move, prevent Eevee from successfully Wish passing and wear it down, limiting its use.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wish Passer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish allows Eevee to pass 12 HP Wishes to its teammates. Return does decent damage against everything that doesn't resist it, thanks to Adaptability, and can be used to pick off weaker threats when nothing needs to be healed. Protect allows Eevee to receive its own Wish, keeping it healthy for later in the battle. Baton Pass lets Eevee tank a neutral hit before pivoting out, enabling a weakened Pokemon to come in and receive the Wish. Quick Attack can also be run in the last slot, giving Eevee a way to pick off weakened Pokemon in the late-game. For a more defensive set, Heal Bell can be run, allowing Eevee to support its team by eliminating status.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs and nature let Eevee survive a +2 Fletchling's Acrobatics and usually KO back with Return after Stealth Rock, as well as survive 16 Atk Mienfoo's High Jump Kick from full health. This spread also allows Eevee to 2HKO Timburr on the switch and KO Mienfoo with Return + Quick Attack after it has been hit with Knock Off. A spread with a Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs lets Eevee Baton Pass out of slow Pokemon such as Snubbull after they move, but makes Timburr harder to deal with. Eviolite gives Eevee the greatest possible bulk, allowing it to compensate for its only decent base defenses as much as it can. Adaptability is the most useful ability for Eevee and, on this set, allows it to hit fairly hard with Return, despite the lack of Attack investment.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Most of the time, Eevee should use Wish against a defensive Pokemon or on a switch, take a hit, and Baton Pass to something that needs healing. If there are Pokemon that can use Eevee as setup bait, it is a good idea to pivot out with Baton Pass as soon as Eevee comes in so that it does not lose momentum. Eevee should only attack when nothing on its team needs a Wish passed to it and there are no Ghost- or Steel-types that could switch in for free setup opportunities. Try to avoid Fighting-type attacks whenever possible and use caution when switching Eevee into strong neutral attacks, which wear it down quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Snubbull, Skrelp, and Croagunk appreciate Eevee's Wish passing due to their lack of reliable recovery and can check the Fighting-types that give Eevee trouble. Pursuit trappers, such as Stunky and Pawniard, can trap the Ghost-types that Eevee cannot hit, allowing it to more comfortably attack if need be. Frail Pokemon that get worn down throughout a match, such as Gastly, appreciate Wishes that come with momentum from a Baton Pass as well.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Kabuto is the only Pokemon in LC that has access to Rapid Spin and is resistant to Flying-type moves; it also stands out as an incredible Fletchling counter that also beats Diglett with ease. Kabuto's STAB moves also allow it to beat common entry hazard control Pokemon, such as Archen and Drilbur. Aqua Jet is another useful tool to beat Drilbur most of the time. However, Kabuto's Rock / Water typing is both a blessing and a curse; while it's the only Pokemon with Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin, and Knock Off that is not weak to Water-type attacks, it has nasty weaknesses to Electric-, Ground-, Fighting-, and Grass-type moves. Also, despite its great physical bulk, its special bulk is very low, making it easy for special attackers to take it out. The Defog buff makes Rapid Spin less viable in the metagame, but Kabuto can still maintain great control over entry hazards without sacrificing power.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kabuto doesn't have many viable options. Kabuto can run a suicide lead set with Focus Sash and Weak Armor focusing on Speed. However, Dwebble is much more effective as a suicide lead, and Kabuto won't be able to use Rapid Spin as often as the Eviolite set. Kabuto has a decent special movepool, but a poor Special Attack stat makes its special moves nothing more than poor coverage options. Kabuto can run a Berry Juice + Thief set fairly effectively, but Knock Off is usually better for removing items. An offensive set with Rain Dance and Swift Swim is a possibility, but Tirtouga and Omanyte are much better than Kabuto as sweepers. Hidden Power Fire is an option to KO Ferroseed, which otherwise completely walls Kabuto. Hone Claws is Kabuto's only boosting move, and while it also allows Rock Slide to be more accurate, it's usually hard to fit onto Kabuto's set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Mienfoo, Timburr, and Scraggy can take Kabuto's attacks very well, while Croagunk completely walls Kabuto. They can all easily set up on Kabuto as well. Mienfoo can even Taunt Kabuto and prevent it from setting up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types, especially Pumpkaboo, can take any of Kabuto's attacks bar Knock Off fairly well and immediately threaten to KO Kabuto.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Cottonee, Foongus, Lileep, and Ferroseed are very irritating for Kabuto. Cottonee can come in and force Kabuto out if it has Giga Drain, and Foongus can use either Giga Drain to OHKO Kabuto or Spore to make Kabuto dead weight. Lileep is immune to Waterfall and Aqua Jet thanks to Storm Drain, and Ferroseed completely walls Kabuto.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status, especially burn, greatly hurts Kabuto and prevents it from doing its job effectively.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Chinchou can take all of Kabuto's moves and 2HKO with its own STAB Electric-type moves. Magnemite can switch into Rock Slide and Aqua Jet and OHKO Kabuto with Thunderbolt.</p>",

      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin allows Kabuto to get rid of entry hazards without relying on Defog, so you can always remove entry hazards without clearing away your own. As Kabuto doesn't have access to Stone Edge, Rock Slide is its main Rock-type STAB attack, being both decently powerful and accurate. Aqua Jet is a must-have priority attack that helps to beat Drilbur and Archen. Aqua Jet also helps to finish with anything that switches into Kabuto's Rock Slide while having no risk of an incoming attack, unless the opposing Pokemon is faster and has priority. Waterfall is an option for a secondary STAB move, hitting Rock- and Ground-types such as Archen and Drilbur quite hard. Thanks to Kabuto's good physical bulk, it can also be a viable Stealth Rock setter. Knock Off can also be used in the last slot to cripple defensive threats and hit Ghost-types a bit harder, making Pumpkaboo struggle when trying to spinblock Kabuto.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Attack EVs and nature maximize Kabuto's Attack so that it can hit as hard as possible. The rest of the EVs are placed in HP and Defense to give Kabuto enough bulk to survive hits such as Drilbur's Earthquake and then 2HKO back with Aqua Jet. While Kabuto with maximum Speed EVs reaches 16 Speed, it is outclassed by Drilbur as a fast spinner. Eviolite boosts Kabuto's physical bulk and helps to increase Kabuto's low Special Defense a bit, making it the preferred item. Battle Armor is the only ability that Kabuto can make any use of. However, if Kabuto is being used on a rain team, it can use Swift Swim instead with either 76 Speed EVs or a Jolly nature to outspeed Choice Scarf Pawniard in the rain.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kabuto can be used as a lead, but remember to check the opposing team and see if it has a potential Taunt user before you lead with Kabuto. Common Taunt users include Mienfoo, Onix, and Cottonee. When running Knock Off, if the opponent has a Ghost-type and there are entry hazards on your side of the field, try to use Knock Off so the opposing Ghost-type gets seriously hurt on the switch-in. Try to switch into many of Kabuto's resistances, such as those to Fire-, Flying-, and Normal-type attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Flying-types such as Fletchling have good defensive synergy with Kabuto and can remove Grass- and Fighting-types for it. Kabuto also pairs extremely well with other Grass-types such as Cottonee, which resist everything Kabuto is weak to; in return, Kabuto resists Fire- and Poison-type moves for Cottonee. If Kabuto is using Stealth Rock, spinblockers are extremely useful for keeping Stealth Rock during the whole game, while Pawniard can punish Defog. Pokemon weak to entry hazards such as Larvesta and Ponyta appreciate Kabuto's ability to remove hazards.</p>"

Dratini's lower Speed tier also stops it from being very threatening without boosts. However, Dratini has access to two amazing moves: Dragon Dance and Extreme Speed. Extreme Speed's power boosted by Dragon Dance makes Dratini very threatening. Dratini also boasts a good STAB move in Outrage, which 2HKOes anything that doesn't resist it when Dratini is at +1. Because of these traits, Dratini remains a good Pokemon in the Little Cup metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A parashuffler set with Thunder Wave and Dragon Tail can work, but Dratini lacks sufficient bulk to use it. Dratini can work with its special movepool, but it lacks the stats to use a fully special set and it relies too much on Extreme Speed. A RestTalk set using Marvel Scale or a Rest set using Shed Skin with Dragon Dance and Outrage can work. Waterfall provides little extra coverage, but it can be used to hit Drilbur. A Choice Band can be used, but Dratini relies too much on its versatility.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairies such as Spritzee can easily beat Dratini, but are threatened by Iron Tail.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon such as Pawniard don't take much damage from Dratini's STAB moves or Extremespeed, but they must be wary of Fire Blast. Pawniard in particular is able to bypass Fire Blast with Sucker Punch, although it usually fails to OHKO Dratini without prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: Sturdy stops Dratini from OHKOing opponents, and most Pokemon with Sturdy can take advantage of Dratini's frail defenses and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Gastly can outspeed Dratini and hit it hard with a STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out</strong>: Fake Out can pick off a weakened Dratini as Fake Out has higher priority than Extreme Speed.</p>",

Outrage is an extremely powerful STAB move that hits Pokemon that don't resist it hard when Dratini is at +1. Extreme Speed works well with Dragon Dance, as at 80 Base Power, it hits most weakened Pokemon very hard when Dratini is boosted. Iron Tail hits Fairy-type Pokemon very hard, but due to its low accuracy, Fire Blast should be used to hit Steel-type Pokemon instead.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Attack EVs with a boosting nature maximize Dratini's Attack, allowing it to hit as hard as possible after a Dragon Dance. A Naughty nature should be used if Fire Blast is chosen. The Speed EVs allow Dratini to hit 21 Speed after a Dragon Dance and outspeed the majority of the metagame. A Life Orb boosts Dratini's damage output at the cost of some HP each hit. 0 HP IVs reduce Life Orb recoil to 1 HP point per hit. Shed Skin allows Dratini to shrug off burns and paralysis.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dratini doesn't have much coverage, so getting rid of all of Dratini's checks and counters is preferred, as it makes Dratini's sweeping much easier. That being said, Dratini is best used late-game. Dratini can also punch holes in the opponent's team so that another sweeper can come in and attempt to sweep. Fairy-types are a complete stop to Dratini if it is locked into Outrage, so it's ideal to clear them out before setting up. Lastly, Fake Out users can easily KO a weakened Dratini as Fake Out always moves before Extreme Speed, so sometimes it is better to switch out rather than allow Dratini to be KOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dratini is pretty frail, so dual screens support from Bronzor or Encore support from Cottonee is ideal to make setting up Dragon Dance easier. Wynaut easily traps and gets rid of Dratini's checks, also allowing Dratini to set up easier. Cottonee has priority Encore and Memento, which usually forces the opponent to switch out, giving Dratini a free turn to use Dragon Dance. Magnemite traps Steel-types and can hit Fairies with Flash Cannon. Entry hazards setters such as Dwebble and Ferroseed can provide hazard support to allow Dratini to net more KOs. Timburr can also clear out Steel-types if they are a problem.</p>"

As a cleric, Chikorita faces stiff competition from Chinchou, Spritzee, and Lickitung, which are generally considered more useful, but Chikorita's crucial resistances to Ground and Water allow it to check Drilbur, Chinchou, Tirtouga, Corphish, and Carvanha. Although it's bulky, Chikorita lacks any sort of offensive presence, as its movepool is shallow and its attacking stats are low.</p>",

Ancient Power gives Chikorita a move to hit Fire-types with, but the move's 60 Base Power isn't going to do much damage to anything besides Larvesta. Toxic is an option to wear down bulky Pokemon Chikorita can't hurt much, such as Porygon and Ponyta. Leaf Storm is an option over Giga Drain to give Chikorita a much more powerful STAB option. Counter is an interesting move to hit physical attackers with, considering Chikorita can survive most physical hits. Chikorita's Attack is the same as its Special Attack, so Bullet Seed could be used to break Substitutes, but the added recovery from Giga Drain is almost always better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Chikorita can't do masses of damage to most Grass-types, but Grass / Poison Pokemon such as Foongus and Bellsprout can easily switch in and hit Chikorita with a super effective STAB move, and Chikorita's Hidden Power Fire won't do too much in return.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Chikorita can't do much damage to Fire-types, so they can easily force it out.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Chikorita is easily forced out by Flying-types and the threat of their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types completely wall Chikorita and can hit it hard with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Fletchling, Dragon Dance Scraggy, Bulk Up Timburr, and Calm Mind Spritzee can easily take advantage of Chikorita's lack of offensive presence to get some boosts.</p> <p><strong>U-turn</strong>: Pokemon with U-turn cause a large amount of trouble for Chikorita: it either has to stay in and take the super effective hit, or switch out and lose momentum.</p>",

      "Aromatherapy": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Because being a bulky cleric is Chikorita's main niche, Aromatherapy is the obvious first choice. Synthesis gives Chikorita a mostly reliable form of recovery. Giga Drain is the STAB move of choice, allowing Chikorita to threaten Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types and giving it a bit of extra recovery. The last move is mostly filler. Using Hidden Power Fire means that Chikorita isn't completely deadweight against opposing Grass- and Steel-types such as Ferroseed, Foongus, and Pawniard. Hidden Power Fighting is another option, still hitting Steel-types and also OHKOing Choice Scarf Pawniard after Stealth Rock. Unfortunately, Hidden Power is quite weak, but Chikorita doesn't get too many other options.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The defensive EVs give Chikorita 16 and 14 in Defense and Special Defense respectively, which become 24 and 21 after Eviolite is taken into account, allowing it to avoid the 2HKO from bulky Chinchou's Ice Beam as well as Drilbur's and Timburr's Poison Jab. Chikorita can also avoid the OHKO from powerful moves such as Amaura's Tri Attack, Fletchling's Acrobatics, and +2 Tirtouga's Stone Edge. Chikorita is bulky enough to serve as a strong physical wall to anything that does not have a super effective STAB move or that can't set up on it. Chikorita's HP stat hits 23, meaning it takes 1 less damage from Stealth Rock than if it were invested fully. 48 Special Attack EVs are necessary to 2HKO Ferroseed and Choice Scarf Pawniard with Hidden Power Fire. They also allow Chikorita to OHKO Choice Scarf Pawniard with Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Chikorita works as a wall that can switch into the Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types that it can easily put a stop to throughout the match, using Aromatherapy or Synthesis when needed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that hate status and are weak to Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types appreciate Chikorita as a partner. Pawniard is an example of a Pokemon that hates being burned and needs a Pokemon to switch into Ground-type moves. Rock-types can switch into Flying- and Fire- types for Chikorita and need something to switch into Water- and Ground-types. As with most bulky Grass-type Pokemon, Chikorita works well in a Fire / Water / Grass core, due to the members' good defensive type synergy. Ponyta hates Toxic and paralysis, while bulky Tirtouga hates Toxic and burns, so they make good partners to Chikorita.</p>"

  "Cyndaquil": {
    "overview": "<p>Cyndaquil can be a very potent wallbreaker under the right conditions, but unfortunately, these are hard to meet because of its poor bulk and reliance on maintaining Eruption's high Base Power. It's almost a necessity to clear entry hazards for using Cyndaquil, and any priority moves or faster Choice Scarf users may also severely hinder it. Other Fire-types such as Vulpix are generally better options, and Cyndaquil should thus be used only when its very specific niche is desired.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Electric can be used to hit Mantyke and Archen. On a non-Choice Scarf set, Flame Charge can be used to sweep, but Cyndaquil lacks the bulk and power to do this. Lava Plume could be used as an alternate STAB move for its 100% accuracy and ability to burn foes. Will-O-Wisp can also be used to burn Cyndaquil's checks such as Munchlax, Hippopotas, and Archen. Choice Specs can be used for additional power but fails to be effective against faster Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Cyndaquil's poor bulk means that priority users such as Fletchling and Bunnelby will be able to KO it after very little prior damage. Even if they do not KO it, Eruption will be rendered useless.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Able to come in on any move barring Hidden Power Grass, Water-types immediately force Cynadaquil out. Mantyke has an enormous Special Defense stat and isn't weak to Hidden Power Grass or Ground, making it one of Cyndaquil's best checks. Other Water-types such as Corphish and Tirtouga have access to Aqua Jet to easily OHKO Cyndaquil.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock types don't appreciate taking a Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Ground from Cyndaquil, but can otherwise easily come in and threaten it out. Many of them are able to set up Stealth Rock to limit Cyndaquil's future use. Archen is especially problematic because it is not weak to the Hidden Powers that Cyndaquil normally uses.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Taking any sort of damage, whether it be from entry hazards, poison, or weather, reduces Eruption's power and limits Cyndaquil's damage output.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Eruption is Cyndaquil's most powerful move and the main appeal to using Cyndaquil. However, its power is diminished by any damage taken by Cyndaquil, especially from entry hazards and priority moves. Extrasensory is a coverage move specifically for hitting Skrelp, Croagunk, and Tentacool. Hidden Power Ground and Grass both hit Chinchou and Rock-types super effectively; Hidden Power Ground also hits opposing Fire-types and the rare Tyrunt, while Hidden Power Grass hits Water-types and many Rock-types that are 4x weak to Grass. Fire Blast is an alternative STAB move for when Cyndaquil (and Eruption) has been weakened.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf lets Cyndaquil outspeed all unboosted Pokemon and some opposing Choice Scarf users. Blaze allows a severely weakened Cyndaquil to do much more damage. Flash Fire can allow Cyndaquil to come in freely on a Fire move to receive a boost, but Cyndaquil often loses to opposing Fire-types anyway. The EVs are aimed to maximize Cyndaquil's offensive stats. The HP EVs allow Cyndaquil to switch into Stealth Rock four times without fainting, and the extra EVs are placed in Defense to better tank priority moves. A Timid nature lets Cyndaquil outspeed other Choice Scarf users such as Bunnelby or Pawniard, but the extra Speed isn't always needed. Using a Modest nature to hit as hard as possible is a viable alternative.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When Cyndaquil is at 15 HP (71%) or lower, Fire Blast has a higher Base Power than Eruption. Also note that a Blaze-boosted Fire Blast hits harder than Eruption at full health. If using Flash Fire, switch into predicted Fire moves when Cyndaquil will be able to KO the foe with a Flash Fire boost. If the opposing Pokemon has a priority move or is a faster Choice Scarf user, it may be risky to use Eruption and have its Base Power weakened before attacking. Try to avoid taking any damage at all, as it's very important to keep Eruption's Base Power high.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defog or Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Archen and Vullaby is absolutely essential to preserve Eruption's high Base Power. Drilbur is a particularly good Rapid Spin user because of its ability to threaten opposing Fire-types and Rock-types; it also has a favorable matchup against Chinchou, while Cyndaquil handles Grass-types in return. Vulpix's Drought can allow Cyndaquil to hit much harder and OHKO many more Pokemon. Slow pivots such as Mienfoo or Chinchou allow Cyndaquil to come into battle without taking any damage.</p>"

  "Totodile": {
    "overview": "<p>Totodile is a powerful wallbreaker thanks to Sheer Force, which boosts the power of moves with secondary effects, such as Waterfall and Ice Punch, by 30%. Totodile has access to two excellent boosting moves, Swords Dance and Dragon Dance, allowing it to boost its wallbreaking capabilities even further or act as a late-game sweeper. However, it faces stiff competition from Corphish in these roles, as Corphish has a higher Attack stat and Adaptability, as well as access to the coveted Knock Off. Totodile has a few advantages over Corphish, however, most notably its access to Ice Punch, which allows it to break past bulky Grass-types such as Foongus after a boost. Totodile also has a bit more bulk than Corphish, allowing it to set up more easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Crunch hits Slowpoke and Frillish super effectively, two Pokemon that could otherwise wall Totodile's entire set. Aerial Ace is a niche coverage option that hits Croagunk super effectively, but it's weak, doesn't receive a Sheer Force boost, and has little use outside of this. Rock Slide OHKOes Mantyke but provides rather redundant coverage in other situations. Iron Tail hits Snubbull and Spritzee hard and is able to OHKO both of them after a Swords Dance boost, but its accuracy is a bit of a letdown. Substitute can be used as a way to dodge status moves and Sucker Punch, potentially giving Totodile another turn to set up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status Users</strong>: Burn, paralysis, and sleep all heavily cripple Totodile, as they severely cut its offensive potential. Any status user capable of tanking a hit from Totodile can serve as a decent check.</p> <p><strong>Fast Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Fast Choice Scarf users such as Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Pawniard can serve as good checks to both the Swords Dance and Dragon Dance sets, as they can outspeed +1 Totodile and hit it hard with their STAB moves. Swords Dance sets are a bit harder to revenge kill, however, as a counter will need to be healthy enough to stomach a +2 Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Chinchou, Skrelp, and Slowpoke can switch in without too much trouble, sponge a hit, and retaliate back with their STAB moves or cripple Totodile with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Croagunk</strong>: Croagunk is immune to Waterfall and Aqua Jet thanks to Dry Skin, resists Superpower, and is only hit neutrally by Ice Punch. Croagunk can thus switch in on almost any move and retaliate with its STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance raises Totodile's Attack and Speed, letting it outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after one use and attempt a sweep. Waterfall gets boosted by Sheer Force and STAB, making it a very strong attacking option. After a single Dragon Dance, foes lacking a resistance or an immunity to the move will be taking massive damage. Ice Punch provides important coverage against bulky Grass- and Flying-types such as Foongus and Vullaby. After a Dragon Dance boost, Totodile can OHKO them both after Stealth Rock damage if it holds Life Orb. Superpower provides coverage against bulky Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Lileep, and Porygon. However, Totodile will require Knock Off support or prior damage to secure OHKOs on these Pokemon, or it risks being KOed or crippled. Aqua Jet can be used to hit opposing priority users such as Fletchling, Pawniard, and Timburr for decent damage before they can strike back with their own priority moves. Aqua Jet particularly messes with Sucker Punch users such as Pawniard, as Sucker Punch will fail if it goes last.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize Totodile's Attack and Speed. An Adamant nature is preferred so that Totodile hits as hard as possible. With maximum Speed investment, Totodile hits 21 Speed after a Dragon Dance boost, allowing it to outpace the entire unboosted metagame. A Jolly nature is an option to outspeed 14 Speed Choice Scarf users after a boost, such as Magnemite, Scraggy, and Snover. Sheer Force is a necessity, giving a nice power boost to Totodile's Waterfall and Ice Punch. Eviolite increases Totodile's bulk, which gives it more setup opportunities and makes it harder to revenge kill. Life Orb, on the other hand, gives Totodile a significant power boost and makes sweeping past bulky foes much easier. Thanks to Sheer Force, Life Orb recoil is negated for moves with secondary effects such as Waterfall and Ice Punch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Totodile functions as a late-game sweeper and should try to wait to set up until its checks and counters have been weakened or KOed. Totodile should attempt to set up a Dragon Dance on Pokemon it forces out, such as Archen, Drilbur, or Diglett. Keep in mind that Superpower lowers Totodile's Attack and Defense, making it easier for opposing priority users, Choice Scarf users, and bulky foes to revenge kill or cripple Totodile. Totodile hates all status effects, as they hamper its sweeping ability, so it shouldn't try to set up on Pokemon that commonly carry status moves, such as Porygon. Also, beware of Pokemon that can set up alongside Totodile, such as Timburr, which can boost with Bulk Up and defeat Totodile in a one-on-one situation.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A Memento user such as Cottonee or Diglett can provide Totodile with an easy setup opportunity; this is especially important if Totodile is running Life Orb. Cottonee can also provide additional setup opportunies for Totodile with Encore, while Diglett can trap and KO Pokemon such as Chinchou and Croagunk, which are troublesome foes for Totodile. Clerics such as Spritzee can heal Totodile of status and pass Wishes to it. Entry hazard setters such as Dwebble, Ferroseed, and Archen can pair well with Totodile, allowing Totodile to obtain crucial OHKOs on bulky Pokemon such as Vullaby, Ferroseed, and Foongus. A Pokemon that can switch into status moves, such as Timburr or Foongus, can make for a good teammate, as Totodile is a target for all sorts of status moves. Timburr can benefit from status thanks to Guts and can provide Knock Off support, while Foongus doesn't particularly mind being statused and can put a foe to sleep with Spore. Other offensive Water-types including Tirtouga, Carvanha, Corphish, and Omanyte can pair up nicely with Totodile, as they weaken each other's checks and counters, allowing one to eventually pull off a sweep late-game. Drilbur can serve as an offensive check to Chinchou and Croagunk, two Pokemon that Totodile doesn't enjoy dealing with, and can also provide the team with Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin support. Gothita or Magnet Pull Magnemite can trap Ferroseed for Totodile, allowing it to safely run Aqua Jet over Superpower.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance doubles Totodile's Attack, increasing its damage output even further and allowing Totodile to act as a powerful wallbreaker. Waterfall gets STAB and a Sheer Force boost, making it Totodile's strongest attacking option. Ice Punch hits Grass-types such as Foongus incredibly hard, easily KOing them at +2 with Life Orb, and KOing at +2 after Stealth Rock damage if Totodile opts for Eviolite. Aqua Jet allows Totodile to pick off faster weakened Pokemon and can be used in conjunction with Swords Dance late-game to clean up weakened teams. Superpower, on the other hand, provides important coverage against Ferroseed, Lileep, and Porygon; at +2, it OHKOes them all after Stealth Rock damage. Superpower also provides handy neutral coverage against Water-types, which otherwise resist Totodile's coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature ensure that Totodile hits as hard as possible. A Jolly nature could be used to get the jump on Pokemon such as defensive Chinchou and defensive Archen, but Totodile usually prefers Adamant for the added damage output and ability to attain key guaranteed OHKOs at +2, such as Porygon and Foongus. Sheer Force is an amazing ability, giving a 1.3x power boost to Totodile's Waterfall and Ice Punch. Eviolite gives a nice boost to Totodile's bulk, making it easier for Totodile to set up and harder for it to be revenge killed, while still hitting very hard at +2 with Sheer Force. Life Orb can be used instead to hit harder right off the bat. Sheer Force also negates Life Orb recoil for moves with secondary effects such as Waterfall and Ice Punch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Totodile in mid- or late-game to break through walls, paving the way for another teammate to sweep. Alternatively, Totodile can potentially clean up on its own late-game if faster foes have been weakened into KO range for Totodile's Aqua Jet. Totodile should attempt to set up a Swords Dance on Pokemon it forces out, such as Archen, Drilbur, or Diglett. Keep in mind that Superpower lowers Totodile's Attack and Defense, making it easier for a foe to revenge kill Totodile. Totodile's offensive potential is seriously hampered by status effects, so try to avoid setting up on Pokemon that commonly carry status moves, such as Porygon. Note that Pokemon such as Timburr can boost alongside Totodile and defeat it one-on-one.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clerics such as Spritzee make for good teammates, as they can heal Totodile of status and pass Wishes to it. Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Foongus have good synergy with Totodile, as they can cover its weaknesses to Grass- and Electric-type moves. Ferroseed can also provide entry hazard support, allowing Totodile to secure OHKOs on bulky Pokemon such as Porygon, Koffing, and Vullaby. Foongus doesn't mind most types of status, so it can switch into status moves aimed at Totodile and put a foe to sleep with Spore. Timburr can benefit from status moves aimed at Totodile thanks to Guts and provides Totodile with useful Knock Off support. Other offensive Water-types can pair up nicely with Totodile, as they can wear down each other's checks and counters, allowing one to pull off a sweep late-game. These include Tirtouga, Carvanha, Corphish, and Omanyte. Drilbur can serve as an offensive check to Chinchou and Croagunk, two Pokemon that Totodile doesn't enjoy dealing with, and can also provide the team with Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin support. Gothita or Magnet Pull Magnemite can trap Ferroseed for Totodile, allowing it to safely run Aqua Jet over Superpower.</p>"

  "Spinarak": {
    "overview": "<p>Spinarak is one of the three Pokemon in Little Cup that can use the move Sticky Web, and it is the only one with access to another entry hazard move: Toxic Spikes. Spinarak makes for a great lead with Focus Sash, though its great defensive typing resists common attacking types, such as Fairy and Fighting, allowing it to use Eviolite effectively as well. While its Attack is mediocre, it has powerful STAB options in Megahorn and Poison Jab that Spinarak can do considerable damage with. Spinarak's ability Insomnia allows it to act as a sleep absorber and set up easily on Foongus. However, Spinarak has poor stats. Its Speed can sometimes prevent it from doing its job effectively, and it has mediocre defenses, which are compounded by the fact that it's weak to common attacking types. Its STAB combination can also prove problematic, as it is completely walled by Steel-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Spinarak's other options are fairly limited and somewhat redundant, especially considering it only has one real job to do. However, it has physical priority options in Sucker Punch and Shadow Sneak to get some damage off on opponents such as Abra before going down. X-Scissor is also an option if Megahorn's 85% accuracy is undesirable, although the loss in power is considerable. Baton Pass can be used to ensure a teammate gets a safe switch in. Additionally, this can be used to pass an Agility boost to a very slow teammate.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pawniard</strong>: Pawniard doesn't take a lot of damage from Megahorn, is unaffected by Toxic Spikes, and will grab a nasty Attack boost upon switching in on Sticky Web thanks to Defiant.</p> <p><strong>Archen</strong>: Archen resists both of Spinarak's STAB moves and can use Defog to get rid of the entry hazards Spinarak sets up while doing massive damage with Rock Slide or Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Natu</strong>: Spinarak is unable to set up entry hazards while Natu is active due to its Magic Bounce ability deflecting them on to Spinarak's side of the field. It also hits hard with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Fast users of the move Taunt, including Cottonee and Purrloin, can render Spinarak unable to set up Sticky Web, although both must be wary of Spinarak's STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sticky Web": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sticky Web is the primary reason to use Spinarak in Little Cup. It's a useful entry hazard move which slows down grounded opponents when they enter battle, and Spinarak's teammates will always appreciate a slower opponent. Megahorn is Spinarak's most powerful STAB attack, and it will inflict heavy damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Poison Jab is Spinarak's other STAB move, and it OHKOes Cottonee and 2HKOes Spritzee after Stealth Rock. Protect is useful for keeping Spinarak's Focus Sash intact by protecting against Fake Out users such as Mienfoo, but if you choose to run the defensive Eviolite set, you can use Toxic Spikes to poison switch-ins.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Spinarak will always benefit most from choosing Insomnia as its ability, as this will enable it to set up Sticky Web on sleep inducers such as Foongus without worrying about being put to sleep. Focus Sash is Spinarak's primary item, as it will almost always assure that Spinarak sets up Sticky Web successfully. 196 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature allow Spinarak to hit hard. 196 Speed allows Spinarak to outspeed some slower opponents and get an attack off after setting up Sticky Web, while the remaining EVs are placed in HP to increase Spinarak's longevity. Spinarak can also run a defensively-oriented set with Eviolite. Although Spinarak can't be guaranteed the protection from any one move like it has with Focus Sash, it has more use after Sticky Web is used, as it takes negligible damage from any Fighting-type attack in the tier, it can use Toxic Spikes effectively and can counter Cottonee and Spritzee. A bulkier EV spread of 196 HP / 196 Def / 116 SpD with Eviolite gives it enough bulk to almost always survive an Acrobatics from item-less Fletchling.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Spinarak should typically be used as a lead to ensure Sticky Web can be set up as soon as possible. However, if your opponent has a Pokemon that can remove entry hazards, such as Drilbur or Vullaby, they need to be taken out first so Spinarak can set up Sticky Web later. If Spinarak does manage to set up Sticky Web and your opponent doesn't have a Rapid Spinner or a Defogger, you can save it as a status absorber or death fodder. If Spinarak is using Focus Sash, be wary of opponents that might be running Fake Out, as they may be able to KO Spinarak after breaking its Focus Sash. If Spinarak is running Eviolite, it must be used cautiously. While it is bulkier, it isn't safe from being OHKOed by opponents such as Abra or Vulpix.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pawniard, Mienfoo, Bunnelby, Archen, and Drilbur are all suitable teammates that can utilize Sticky Web, as they all hit quite hard and outspeed all unboosted opponents after the speed drop. For the Flying-type Pokemon unaffected by Sticky Web, such as Taillow and Archen, you can use an Electric-type Pokemon such as Elekid, Magnemite, or Chinchou. Defog users such as Archen or Vullaby can be annoying as they remove Spinarak's Sticky Web, but Pawniard can discourage the use of Defog, as it will trigger Defiant and give Pawniard an Attack boost. A Fighting-type such as Timburr or Croagunk is very useful, as opposing Pawniard will receive an Attack boost from switching in on Sticky Web.</p>"

  "Cleffa": {
    "overview": "<p>With the 21st-lowest BST, Cleffa appears totally useless. However, its borderline viability is derived only from its access to Magic Guard and Counter. With Magic Guard, Cleffa can switch into entry hazards without impairment, preserving its Focus Sash. Cleffa's absurdly low BST can somewhat work to its advantage due to Counter; Cleffa's paper-mache defenses normally would be an extreme detriment, as even weak neutral attacks can 2HKO, but instead Cleffa is able to make great use of them with a guaranteed Focus Sash and Counter. Since even resisted attacks are extremely punishing for Cleffa, Counter allows it to inflict a massive retaliation. Access to Endeavor complements Cleffa's pitiful stats, allowing it to cripple slower Pokemon after it has been heavily damaged. Thunder Wave furthers how annoying Cleffa is, allowing only Electric-immune Pokemon to reliably switch in without detriment. Cleffa has notably larger downsides than the two premier catch-all stops—Abra and Magnemite— such as being completely shut down by Ghost-types, having a very minimal offensive presence, and the simple fact that Cleffa needs to be brutally attacked to be an effective member of the team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cleffa does not have many alternative options other than this set; of the two Cleffa has, neither are really great. Icy Wind can be used in the last slot to further harass switch-ins, allowing Elekid, Gastly, and setup Pokemon to be more easily revenge killed and prevents their setup but is almost always less useful than Encore or Thunder Wave. Hidden Power Fighting can also be run semi-effectively in order to catch Pawniard and Magnemite on the switch in for a large sum of damage; however, it fails to outright OHKO either and very infrequently would this be handy. If you do choose to run Hidden Power Fighting the IVs need to be adjusted to 2 Def / 30 SpA / 2 SpD / 30 Spe for the set to still maintain functionality.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to the functions of this set, Cleffa will usually be picked off or forced out after it has achieved its purpose. Once a sweeper or threatening wallbreaker has been crippled or KOed, anything reaching 13 Speed or higher will check Cleffa.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types with Substitute</strong>: Gastly will always be particularly threatening to Cleffa, as it is unaffected by both Counter and Endeavor while being indifferent to Cleffa's common attacks. Substitute can get around Thunder Wave as well, meaning all Cleffa can do is Encore, though Gastly can outright attack Cleffa and beat it. Gastly has to avoid Thunder Wave as it comes in, however.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types are irksome to Cleffa, as they can viably run Berry Juice to be largely unaffected by Endeavor, are immune to Thunder Wave, and are typically special attackers. Chinchou and Magnemite can pivot around Cleffa's attacks and are unaffected by Counter and Thunder Wave and unfazed by Encore.</p> <p><strong>Unpredictability</strong>: The honest most reliable way to beat Cleffa is to have anything with an unexpected move. For example, a random Substitute can be threatening to Cleffa, as can unexpected special coverage on a physical attacker. Most unordinary sets or unpredictable pokemon will threaten and beat Cleffa if they avoid Thunder Wave.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Counter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Endeavor and Counter are what barely make this set more than a gimmick, allowing Cleffa to completely incapacitate a wall after it has taken a strong attack. Endeavor also allows Cleffa to remove all non-Ghost-types or Substitute-using special sweepers when paired with Thunder Wave. Thunder Wave is useful for punishing switch-ins and allowing Cleffa to rely less on prediction when choosing to use Endeavor or Encore. Encore is extremely useful for crippling the few sweepers that set up on Cleffa, notably users of Substitute that otherwise completely shut down the set. Encore also allows bulkier sweepers, such as Bulk Up Timburr, to be managed as well as serving to give Cleffa something proactive to do against these Pokemon, and allows Cleffa to not lose all momentum.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Magic Guard prevents Cleffa from prematurely breaking its Focus Sash—all but guaranteeing a retaliation from Cleffa. The HP investment allows Cleffa to absorb the largest amount of damage possible in order to double it back with Counter. The lowered Defense IVs and a Hasty nature means that even resisted attacks do considerable amount, perfect for powering up Counter, while the lowered Special Defense IVs allow Cleffa to lose more HP for Endeavor. The Speed EVs allow Cleffa to hit 12 Speed, outspeeding Download Porygon, Snubbull, and all slower walls, allowing it to get off an Endeavor or Encore on these targets.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The set revolves around taking advantage of Counter and Endeavor to effectively cripple or outright KO a majority of the tier. Little Cup is composed predominantly by physical attackers, allowing Cleffa to match up comfortably versus a large percentage of the tier. When using Cleffa, be sure to preserve its Focus Sash by never switching into any attacks with it. Know what your targets are, and if these Pokemon are mixed attackers. In the case of either an either special or mixed attacker, Thunder Wave is the safest option to click, and should be followed up with Endeavor. Encore should be used to manage bulkier sweepers, such as Bulk Up Timburr, and help maintain momentum versus Pokemon setting up Substitute. However, Cleffa does need to be wary when dealing with the likes of Shellder, Rock Blast Omanyte, Honedge, and Snivy running Substitute, as all of these sweepers are largely indifferent to Cleffa's presence.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cleffa has the best synergy with Pokemon that are powerful attackers but can be setup bait for intimidating sweepers, especially those that would require a backup plan, such as Choice Scarf Bunnelby, Stunky, and Archen. Teddiursa, Mienfoo, and Snover also pair well with Cleffa due to how often these give up free turns or are just too weak to prevent opposing Pokemon from settin up, and thus give Cleffa reason to be on the team. Additionally, Cleffa can completely cripple otherwise solid answers to these Pokemon with Endeavor. Stunky, Munchlax, and other Pursuit trappers trap and remove Gastly, producing a reduced opportunity cost for using Cleffa and again offset Cleffa's inability to handle Ghost-types. Pokemon with pivoting moves—Mienfoo, Elekid, and Deerling in particular—can help lure in slower walls for Cleffa to take advantage of after its Focus Sash is broken. Fletchling has a tendency to give Pawniard and most Shell Smash users free turns to set up, meaning Cleffa is rather helpful for subduing these opponents and potentially Endeavoring down a wall for Fletchling; Fletchling also can pivot Cleffa into slower bulkier walls while also revenge killing the strongest Cleffa counters. Cleffa's Endeavor has notably great synergy with Snover, Amaura, and Hippopotas, KOing the foe in tandem with the weather effects while Cleffa avoids damage. In certain cases a powerful attacker—such as Fletchling, Corphish, Gastly, and Ponyta—might be required to follow up Cleffa to remove a particularly troublesome setup sweeper, though generally these Pokemon have greater synergy with Cleffa outside of just this use.</p>"

  "Natu": {
    "overview": "<p>Natu has a unique Psychic / Flying typing as well as a unique and useful ability in Magic Bounce. With access to a fairly large movepool, Natu can fill a number of roles effectively. Between its defensive, dual screens, and offensive sets, Natu can make a good fit for any team. However, Natu does have some flaws. Its unique typing makes it very vulnerable to the common Electric-, Dark-, and Rock-types in the tier. Even though its ability allows it to bounce entry hazards away, it still often loses to common Stealth Rock users due to a type disadvantage. Although it has nice offensive coverage, it has terrible offensive stats to use its coverage properly. Overall, Natu can be a great addition to any team, but it needs support and prediction to use correctly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Natu has several other options, but they either don't really fit well into its sets or are outright outclassed. Shadow Ball can be used to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types, but it is generally better to use Sucker Punch. Tailwind can be used to help Natu's teammates by giving them a free Speed boost. It would also allow Natu to get up screens faster, and it could allow Natu to invest in more bulk. Calm Mind can be used with Roost on a sweeper set, but Natu is generally too frail to pull such a set off. Air Cutter can be used as a secondary STAB move, it but is weak. Haze can be used on the Eviolite set to stop sweepers in their tracks, but Natu is typically too frail to tank hits before hazing. Toxic can be used as an alternative to Thunder Wave. Zen Headbutt can be used on a physically based Natu, but its special movepool is much better. Lastly, Feather Dance can be used on a defensively based Natu to lower opponents' Attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Dwebble, Tirtouga, and Archen have a type advantage against and can force Natu to switch, or KO with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gastly, Honedge, and Frillish can all KO Natu with a super effective STAB move. They have to be wary of Sucker Punch, however. Additionally, Gastly cannot switch in due to being threatened by Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Magnemite, Chinchou, and Elekid can all KO Natu with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Pawniard, Houndour, and Vullaby can all safely beat Natu with Knock Off, Sucker Punch, or Dark Pulse. Additionally, Dark-types can Pursuit trap Natu so they pose an especially threat. Pawniard has to be wary of Heat Wave, and Vullaby has to watch out for Dazzling Gleam, however.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Spritzee, Munchlax, and Lickitung wall Natu pretty hard. Spritzee is able to set up on Natu, Munchlax can aim for a Body Slam paralysis, and Lickitung can cripple Natu with Knock Off.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roost is used for a steady source of recovery and to improve Natu's longevity. Psychic is a STAB move that hits Poison- and Fighting-types for lots of damage, as well as dealing plenty of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Heat Wave is a great coverage option to hit Ferroseed and Pawniard, which otherwise beats Natu super effectively. U-turn is used to gain momentum and also to hit opposing Psychic-types for decent amounts of damage. Lastly, Thunder Wave allows Natu to spread status with no drawbacks, as it cannot be hit with Taunt or statused itself.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs maximize HP for more mixed bulk and hit Eviolite numbers in Natu's defensive stats, and the remaining EVs are put into Special Attack and Speed for slightly more offensive presence. A Bold nature increases Natu's Defense, which helps it take hits. Magic Bounce is why Natu has a niche in Little Cup, preventing it from being hit with Taunt, or statused, as well as bouncing back entry hazards. Finally, Eviolite is the only item that should be considered on this set, as Natu needs the bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Natu can always switch in on a predicted status or hazard move, but it should be wary of attacks. It should never stay in on Dark-types, as they typically have the upper hand. Use Roost whenever you have the chance in order to replenish health to boost Natu's longevity, as while Natu is bulky, it can get worn down. When in doubt, use U-turn to gain momentum and switch into a good option to take care of your opponent. Thunder Wave anything that you need gone or that threatens your team. Good Thunder Wave targets include Pawniard, which might use Sucker Punch, and Fletchling, which poses a threat to lots of Pokemon on many teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Natu provides plenty team support. Dwebble, Fletchling, and Houndour appreciate the protection from Stealth Rock, as they aren't very bulky. Shell Smash users such as Omanyte, Dwebble, and Tirtouga can be partners as well, as they appreciate hazards gone. Natu can also deal with threatening Grass-types for these Pokemon. Fighting-types work well with Natu, as they take care of troublesome Dark-types. Ground-types such as Diglett help to beat threatening Electric-types. Anything that is weak to entry hazards and crippled by status typically benefit from Natu's presence.</p>"

Heat Wave is a great coverage option for Ferroseed and Pawniard, which otherwise beats Natu. Dazzling Gleam is a good way for Natu to beat Dark-types such as Vullaby which are otherwise some of its worst matchups. Sucker Punch allows Natu to hit threatening Ghost-types such as Gastly, as well as Psychic-types such as Abra. It also helps to pick off weakened opponents. Giga Drain is a great coverage move that allows Natu to deal with some of its biggest threats, including Tirtouga, Omanyte, and weakened Chinchou. Roost is used for a steady source of recovery that improves Natu's longevity. Lastly, U-turn is used to gain momentum, while also hitting opposing Psychic-, Grass-, and Dark-types for decent damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Speed EVs allow Natu to hit 17 Speed, which is a highly valuable Speed tier. 196 EVs go into Special Attack to allow Natu to hit harder, and 116 EVs in Attack are used so that U-turn and Sucker Punch do respectable amounts of damage. Magic Bounce is the obvious ability, as it bounces back status moves that could stop a sweep. A Naive nature is good to both boost Speed while not lowering either offensive stat. Finally, Life Orb is used to hit hard, while 19 HP IVs are used to reduce Life Orb damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Offensive Natu is not bulky, so it should not be switching into attacks often. Always switch in on predicted status moves. Use U-turn whenever you don't know what your opponent will do, as it allows you to gain momentum. Life Orb damage racks up quickly, so use Roost when you run low on health. As this Natu variant is frail, slow Volt Switch and U-turn users are good teammates to get it in. Chinchou has good type synergy with Natu, while Mienfoo resists Knock Off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dwebble, Fletchling, and Houndour appreciate the protection from Stealth Rock, as they aren't very bulky. Shell Smash users, such as Omanyte, Dwebble, and Tirtouga, can also work as partners, as they appreciate having entry hazards removed. Natu can also deal with threatening Grass-types for these Pokemon. Ground-types such as Drilbur can beat problematic Electric-types for Natu. Diglett works especially well as it traps and can safely KO them. Other Pokemon that are weak to entry hazards and crippled by status benefit from Natu's presence.</p>"

U-turn is for momentum, and it is a good way to get Natu's teammates in after setting up dual screens. Psychic is a good STAB move that is used so that Natu has at least some offensive presence. Wish can be used instead to provide recovery, and Natu can pass Wishes to its teammates via U-turn to ensure that they're at full health.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Light Clay is best run here to increase the number of turns that dual screens will be up. This set is not meant to be offensive, as it is used just to set up screens while passively preventing entry hazards as well as providing Wish support. Magic Bounce is the obvious ability. The EV spread is used so that this Natu can be flexible when setting up dual screens. 196 Speed EVs are used so Natu can outspeed many Pokemon and get up screens reliably. 36 EVs are invested into Attack to give U-turn some power, while the rest of the EVs are put into HP and defenses to maximize Natu's bulk. A Jolly nature is used to raise Speed while lowering Special Attack. If you are using Psychic, you can put the 36 EVs into Special Attack instead of Attack and use a Timid nature.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Natu in on any status and hazards, but be wary of attacks. Set up dual screens to help teammates tank hits and pass Wishes. Use U-turn to gain momentum when you don't know what your opponent is going to do. Prediction is key on this set, so always predict switch-ins. Finally, always switch out of Dark-types such as Pawniard, as Natu can't do anything to them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Many Pokemon appreciate protection from entry hazards, and Natu works well to mitigate this issue for many Pokemon. Dwebble, Fletchling, and Houndour appreciate the protection from Stealth Rock, as they aren't very bulky. Shell Smash Pokemon such as Omanyte, Dwebble, and Tirtouga can be used as well, because they appreciate dual screens' protection as well as hazard blocking. Natu can also deal with threatening Grass-types for these Pokemon. Ground-types such as Drilbur can beat problematic Electric-types for Natu.

    "overview": "<p>Mareep is one of the few Pokemon in Little Cup with access to both Light Screen and Reflect. This, coupled with only one weakness to Ground and solid bulk from Eviolite, gives Mareep a small niche as a dual screens setter. However, not only is Mareep one of the only Electric-types in Little Cup without access to Volt Switch, but it is shut down by basically any Taunt user, and lacks reliable recovery outside of Berry Juice.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Light Clay can be used to keep screens up longer; however, Mareep loses out on the bulk of Eviolite or the recovery of Berry Juice, keeping it from setting up multiple times. Light Clay is usable if you aren't using bulky setup sweepers, as then the three extra turns of increased defenses aren't needed. Cotton Guard boosts Mareep's Defense to solid levels, but Mareep struggles to set up to begin with and should spend its time on the field supporting its team. An all-out attacking set with Thunderbolt, Power Gem, Signal Beam, and a Hidden Power of choice can be used; however, this is done better by Elekid and Chinchou, which have higher Speed and better movepools.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mareep cannot touch Ground-types, such as Drilbur, with any attack, and they can respond with a powerful STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Chinchou</strong>: Chinchou shuts down Mareep with Volt Absorb, and it can status a Pokemon Mareep switches out to with a Thunder Wave or a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon with a fast Taunt, such as Onix, Cottonee, and Mienfoo, stop Mareep from setting up screens. Onix, in particular, can Taunt Mareep and hit it with a STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Spritzee, Porygon, and Munchlax can all stall out screens and heal themselves quite easily.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Mareep's STAB move doesn't bother Grass-types much, while they can pressure Mareep with status. Most of them, such Foongus, Pumpkaboo, and Chespin, don't mind being paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Defog</strong>: Defog removes the screens that Mareep sets up for its team; however, most Defog users are hit super effectively by Mareep's STAB attack.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Light Screen and Reflect double your team's Special Defense and Defense, respectively, and allow teammates to set up relatively unscathed. Thunder Wave paralyzes other Pokemon, slowing down potential threats which can let other Pokemon sweep. Heal Bell allows Mareep to reliably cure teammates of status behind the extra bulk of Light Screen and Reflect. Toxic allows Mareep to whittle down bulky Pokemon that take little damage from or are immune to Mareep's Electric STAB move, such as Porygon and Hippopotas. For offensive options, Thunderbolt is a powerful STAB attack, while Discharge is slightly weaker but comes with a 30% chance to paralyze the foe. Both prevent Mareep from being total Taunt bait.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite is the preferred item because it maximizes Mareep's bulk, while Berry Juice gives Mareep a solid option of recovery; however, this makes setting up on Knock Off users such as Pawniard and Mienfoo much harder. The EVs and nature maximize Mareep's overall bulk. Mareep, backed by an Eviolite, is quite bulky. This allows it to pivot in and out of neutral attacks to set up. Static can paralyze physical attackers, allowing Mareep to set up screens later in the game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mareep should be used before you want a setup sweeper to come in. Use Reflect or Light Screen based on what attacker is in front of you to receive immediate benefits, and then set up the second screen. Mareep has trouble getting past common leads, such as Onix, Dwebble, and Drilbur, and shouldn't be used in the lead position. Mareep should instead be used to support a setup sweeper later in the game. Try to reserve Mareep to come in on Pokemon that cannot deal large damage to it, such as Fletchling and Foongus.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wish support from Spritzee can greatly improve Mareep's longevity, allowing it to set up screens multiple times in the battle. Setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Scraggy, Belly Drum Zigzagoon, Bulk Up Timburr, and Swords Dance Fletchling as well as Baton Pass recipients such as Munna and Natu appreciate the added defenses Mareep's screens supply. Slower Pokemon, such as Corphish, Karrablast, and bulky Pawniard, enjoy the paralysis chances that Mareep offers between Thunder Wave and Static.</p>"

Furthermore, its ability Infiltrator means that not even Substitute can block Hoppip's Sleep Powder, turning Hoppip into a potent offensive and supportive threat. Despite its lack of outstanding stats, which creates the potential for it to be walled once Sleep Clause is activated, as well as its few minor, easily patched-up weaknesses, Hoppip fulfills a specific and desirable role on a multitude of teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf set can function as a decent pivot thanks to Hoppip's typing, access to U-Turn, and fast Sleep Powder, but Hoppip greatly appreciates its ability to switch moves and take advantage of Acrobatics. Stun Spore is a useful support option to cripple faster Pokemon once Sleep Clause has been activated. Memento gives a teammate an easier time setting up at the cost of Hoppip fainting. Sun support grants Hoppip the opportunity to effectively take advantage of Chlorophyll. A specially offensive Chlorophyll set is possible, but Hoppip's physical set has a similar damage output without requiring as much support. Hoppip can run an Eviolite set with Synthesis and a boosting move, but this may take a while to set up. Encore discourages opponents from setting up on Hoppip once Sleep Powder is used. A combination of Substitute and Leech Seed can be used thanks to Hoppip's access to powerful Flying-type STAB attacks, but Leech Seed is generally a gimmicky strategy in LC.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Sleep Powder Absorbers</strong>: Pokemon that are immune to Sleep Powder and can withstand Hoppip's STAB attacks, such as Hoothoot, Elekid, and Vullaby, are able to come in on anything Hoppip offers and force it out; certain dedicated sleep absorbers, such as RestTalk variants of Munchlax and Snubbull, are able to do the same. Early Bird Doduo and Houndour are able to come in on Sleep Powder or Bullet Seed, but they will take heavy damage from a fully powered Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burns and paralysis cripple Hoppip if it does not run Aromatherapy, or force it to waste a turn curing itself if it does. Fast Taunt users can prevent Hoppip from using a large portion of its moves.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Good Stats</strong>: Once Sleep Clause has been activated, most Pokemon with decent offensive and defensive stats that are not weak to Hoppip's STAB attacks are able to beat it.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sleep Powder is able to put one foe out of commission entirely; thanks to Hoppip's ability, Infiltrator, not even Substitute will be enough to prevent this. Acrobatics becomes a powerful STAB move once Berry Juice is activated and annihilates a good portion of the Grass-types that may attempt to switch in to absorb Sleep Powder. Bullet Seed is another viable choice, dealing heavy damage to frailer foes due to how damage rolls work at level 5. Substitute gives Hoppip a reliable means to activate Berry Juice and thus pairs well with Acrobatics; it's also generally useful for scouting attacks and switch-ins. U-turn allows Hoppip to scout the opposing team and provide momentum for its own team after crippling the opposition with Sleep Powder in a similar manner to Compound Eyes Yanma before it was banned. Hoppip's powerful STAB moves and ability to bypass Reflect make it a potent attacker, so Swords Dance is a good option for Hoppip to sweep even more easily. However, Aromatherapy allows Hoppip to further support its own team, as well as remove its own paralysis or burn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set aims to take advantage of Hoppip's unique strengths to allow it to support its team and damage the opposing team in a single set. The given EVs maximize Hoppip's Attack and Speed stats for as much sweeping potential as possible, with the remainder of the EVs dumped in HP so that Hoppip is able to switch into Stealth Rock eight times instead of seven. Berry Juice extends Hoppip's lifespan and, after it has been used, allows Hoppip to take advantage of a fully powered Acrobatics. Infiltrator is useful for allowing Hoppip to get around Substitute and Reflect. A Jolly nature is preferred to most notably outspeed bulky variants of Archen and Chinchou, but an Adamant nature can be used for more overall power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Berry Juice allows Hoppip to switch into weaker attacks and fire off powerful Acrobatics. Use Substitute to activate Berry Juice if a fully powered Acrobatics is needed. It can also be used when Hoppip initially comes in so that you can decide whether to follow up on the switch-in with Sleep Powder or another attack. Hoppip can take advantage of a sleeping foe to set up a Substitute or a Swords Dance, or U-turn out to a teammate that can appropriately deal with the switch-in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can deal with sleep absorbers are appreciated. For example, Roost Archen beats Vullaby, and defensive Mienfoo beats RestTalk Munchlax. As with most offensive Pokemon, Hoppip appreciates having entry hazards on the opposing side to obtain key KOs. Sticky Web support allows Hoppip to outspeed a larger portion of the metagame and sweep more easily. Hoppip is fantastic at removing potent threats such as Mienfoo, Tyrogue, and Sunkern with its STAB attacks, so teammates weak to these Pokemon will benefit from Hoppip's presence. Fighting-types such as Timburr are appreciated, as they can check Ice-types such as Snorunt.</p>"

In addition, its decent physical bulk and access to Scald allow it to act as a soft check to certain physical attackers. However, Wooper remains a generally unviable Pokemon, as its pitiful offensive presence makes it extremely passive, its terrible special bulk means that it loses to almost any special attacker that has a neutral or super effective STAB move, and its double weakness to Grass means that rarer coverage moves shut it down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unaware can be used over Water Absorb to make Wooper check a completely different set of Pokemon, including Zigzagoon and Fletchling. However, the Pokemon that Unaware Wooper attempts to check often have means to get around it; for example, Seed Bomb is a common coverage move on Zigzagoon. Additionally,Water Absorb Wooper arguably walls a more unique set of threats than Unaware Wooper does. None of Wooper's moves other than the ones listed are of any notable use. Ice-type coverage moves are much too weak to be worth using. Scald is superior to Waterfall because of its burn chance, which provides the majority of Wooper's damage output. Setup moves such as Stockpile and Curse are unlikely to result in a sweep, as they do not mitigate Wooper's enormous drawbacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types resist both of Wooper's STAB types and easily force it out with their own.</p> <p><strong>Gothita</strong>: Wooper is weak enough to allow Gothita to directly switch into it. Once it's in play, Gothita can trap Wooper and eliminate it with Energy Ball.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Coverage Moves</strong>: Running uncommon moves such as Hidden Power Grass allows Pokemon that Wooper would otherwise wall to beat it, although Wooper alone is not nearly viable enough to actually warrant doing so.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers are able to prey on Wooper's lower Special Defense and KO it with powerful STAB moves, provided Wooper does not resist them.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Without its Eviolite, Wooper is quite frail, putting it into 2HKO range against a variety of Pokemon that it could otherwise check.</p> <p><strong>Burns and Poison</strong>: Damaging status conditions can force Wooper to use Recover more often than it would otherwise need to, eventually stalling out its PP, and can also make it harder to check threats in general.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Water Absorb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Wooper's most spammable move, as it is boosted by STAB and carries a handy burn chance. Earthquake is Wooper's most powerful move, and it hurts the Electric- and Steel-types that Wooper will be switching into most often. Recover is necessary for Wooper to stick around and counter what it needs to counter repeatedly. The remaining slot is best used to help deter setup sweepers: Yawn pairs well with entry hazards, as it forces plenty of switches, Toxic cripples certain walls and puts a timer on foes, Encore can be used to gain momentum with proper prediction, and Haze ensures that the foe cannot set up on Wooper.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs allow Wooper to reach respectable 23 / 21 / 18 bulk factoring in Eviolite, which is enough to usually avoid the 2HKO from Elekid's Life Orb-boosted Psychic from full health, even if the first Psychic lowers Wooper's Special Defense. The combination of EVs and nature gives Wooper Eviolite numbers for greater mixed bulk. Eviolite is necessary for Wooper to consistently avoid KOs from the Pokemon it needs to check. Water Absorb allows Wooper to wall a number of key Pokemon that could otherwise be difficult to deal with for many teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch into Magnemite, Chinchou, Skrelp, Staryu, Stunky, Honedge, and Slowpoke with impunity; except for niche coverage moves, they barely threaten Wooper. Omanyte, Elekid, Surskit, and Tentacool are more likely to run Grass-type coverage moves, but they are otherwise mostly walled as well. Tirtouga, Ponyta, Larvesta, and Croagunk lose handily to Wooper; however, they can cripple Wooper with Knock Off or Will-O-Wisp in the process, so be careful if you need Wooper to check other threats. Wooper has the raw physical bulk needed to check some physical attackers, such as Eviolite Drilbur without Swords Dance. Use Recover frequently to stay healthy enough to wall what is necessary. Avoid Knock Off when possible, as Wooper needs its Eviolite to avoid a multitude of important 2HKOs. The most Wooper can do to most of its switch-ins is try to burn them with Scald, so use that most of the time; be wary of Guts Timburr, however.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wooper is far too ineffective overall to be used on a team that does not appreciate a full stop to one or more of the Pokemon that Wooper counters, so use it on a team that appreciates such a stop. Entry hazard removal is helpful to ensure that Wooper is not crippled by Toxic Spikes or other entry hazards, which may impede its walling capabilities. In particular, Skrelp and Tentacool greatly enjoy having a hard wall to most of their checks and can absorb Toxic Spikes; the latter is also able to utilize Rapid Spin to clear away other entry hazards. Entry hazard control in general is helpful; Wooper is somewhat adept at forcing switches to take advantage of hazards on the opponent's side of the field, so setters such as Ferroseed are beneficial. Wooper should only be used on slower teams, as it tends to kill momentum. Knock Off absorbers such as Mienfoo and Trubbish are good teammates, as Wooper needs to maintain its Eviolite. Clerics such as Spritzee can be used to deal with burns that Wooper may sustain from switching into Fire-types.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Pineco has access to the SturdyJuice combination, which allows to endure one hit from full health. It can set up every entry hazard (except Sticky Web) and it learns Rapid Spin, which allows it to remove entry hazards. It also has a good physical bulk. However, despite of these traits, it can't stop opposing Pokemon from setting up and is a very predictable lead with a detrimentally low base Speed. It limits teambuilding because it has to be paired with a spinblocker and a Defiant user to properly take advantage of entry hazards and it can be outclassed by the faster and the more offensive Dwebble.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Slide is a good option for a more offensive set and hits Natu. A physically defensive set with Mental Herb allows Pineco to avoid Taunt from Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Onix, and Stunky. Counter could replace Explosion to KO Drilbur after it has used Rock Slide, which is often used against Pineco. An Eviolite set with Pain Split or a Light Clay set with Reflect and Light Screen could be nice alternative sets. Pineco can also set up Toxic Spikes if your team needs this support. Endure could be a good idea if Sturdy has been broken.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Cottonee, Mienfoo, Stunky, and Onix can easily stop Pineco from setting up.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Defoggers such as Archen, Vullaby, and Stunky as well as Rapid Spinners such as Drilbur, Staryu, and Anorith cause great problems to Pineco as they remove every entry hazard that it sets up. Drilbur is a big problem, as it can KO Pineco with Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon such as Bulk Up Timburr, Swords Dance Fletchling and Belly Drum Zigzagoon, and Magby can boost their stats against Pineco and threaten the whole team.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Natu</strong>: Natu forces Pineco to avoid setting up entry hazards thanks to its ability, Magic Bounce.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Set up Stealth Rock to break Focus Sashes and to threaten Flying-types which are immune to Spikes. Spikes deal big damage to grounded Pokemon every time they switch in. Rapid Spin is for removing entry hazards set by opposing Pokemon. Explosion can do a large amount of damage while blocking Rapid Spin and Defog, but generally, Pineco is too slow to take advantage of it. Payback can be preferred in order to hit Ghost-Types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Sturdy + Berry Juice combination allows Pineco to survive at least one hit and set up one entry hazard, if it doesn't get its item Knocked Off. 236 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature are preferred in order to deal a good amount of damage, 236 Speed EVs help set up more entry hazards against slower Pokemon, and 36 Defense EVs are a helpful filler.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pineco has to be used as a lead, because if it is switched into an attack, its Sturdy could be lost. Stealth Rock is usually the first move to use, while Spikes is used to hurt less offensive teams more. Rapid Spin is used against the other common leads such as Dwebble or Tirtouga to remove entry hazards and break Sturdy. Explosion is used in order to prevent the majority of the setup sweepers from boosting their stats after you've set up at least one layer of Spikes or Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Like every entry hazard lead, Pineco needs a spinblocker as a switch-in for Rapid Spin. Pumpkaboo, Phantump and Frillish are the best choices for this role. Cottonee with Encore could be a nice teammate in order to deter opposing Pokemon from setting up on Pineco and sweeping. Pawniard deters Defoggers because it gets an Attack bonus from the move thanks to Defiant.</p>"

Because of Quick Feet, Toxic Orb allows Teddiursa to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. In addition to great Speed, Teddiursa has a high Attack stat which enables it to hit very hard, especially with Facade. Although Teddiursa reaches an impressive 21 Speed after Toxic Orb's activation, it is still outsped by many Choice Scarf users, and a lack of priority means that it is susceptible to priority attacks itself. Its defenses are mediocre as well; this is further compounded by the fact that Teddiursa's health will be whittled away by Toxic damage. It is also weak to Fighting-type moves and cannot boost its defenses with Eviolite, as it must hold Toxic Orb in order to be effective.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Teddiursa can run a Belly Drum set, but it's inferior to other Belly Drum users such as Zigzagoon and Magby.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Coming off Teddiursa's high Attack, Facade is a powerful STAB move after Teddiursa is poisoned. Close Combat usually 2HKOes Ferroseed and punishes other Steel-types, such as Pawniard and Magnemite. Crunch lets Teddiursa nail Gastly and other Ghost-types while providing excellent coverage with Facade. Protect is for activating Toxic Orb safely and stopping Fake Out. However, if Teddiursa is able to be brought in safely, Swords Dance is a useful alternative, as at +2, Teddiursa is able to muscle past even the bulkiest opponents.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Attack EVs are necessary in order for Teddiursa's attacks to hit as hard as possible, while 196 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Teddiursa to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame at 21 Speed after Toxic Orb's activation. The remaining EVs are placed in HP, Defense, and Special Defense to increase Teddiursa's bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Teddiursa in on a free switch through a revenge kill or from a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. Teddiursa usually cannot afford to take hits when poisoned. Avoid keeping Teddiursa in for too long as Toxic damage will rack up and Teddiursa lacks recovery. Teddiursa functions best as a late-game cleaner after its bulkier opponents have been worn down by entry hazards and residual damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teddiursa appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Dwebble, Archen, and Ferroseed. However, Teddiursa also cannot afford to take damage from entry hazards, so an offensive Rapid Spin user such as Staryu or Drilbur makes a good teammate. Knock Off users such as Pawniard, Tirtouga, Mienfoo, and Timburr remove important walls' items so that Teddiursa can break through them more easily. Trubbish checks Fighting-type threats, particularly Timburr, and can lay Spikes quite easily, while a late-game sweeper such as Life Orb Abra can finish off weakened teams or punch holes in things for Teddiursa to finish off. Slow pivots such as Vullaby and Chinchou can provide a safe switch for Teddiursa.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>The main reason to run Slugma over Ponyta, or any other Fire-type for that matter, is the fact that it has the advantage of a reliable recovery move. Slugma also has movepool advantages over the other Fire-types, including: Memento, Light Screen, Reflect, Lava Plume, and Earth Power. Slugma is also the only Memento user to not fear Pawniard because unlike Diglett or Cottonee, Slugma is not easily eliminated by Pawniard's priority Sucker Punch or Iron Head. However, even with this interesting movepool, Slugma finds itself being outclassed by Pokemon like Ponyta and Larvesta that not only have Flame Body, but also have higher Speed, comparable bulk, and a much greater offensive presence. Due to all these advantages that other Fire-types have over Slugma, it is very hard for it to find a spot on any serious team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive Slugma set can be used using the ability Weak Armor with 196 EVs in both Special Attack and Speed, and then the rest of the EVs can go towards its bulk. The moves Recover, Fire Blast, Earth Power, Hidden Power Rock, and Self-Destruct are all useable on this set. Slugma has Guard Swap and Weak Armor, which could make a potentially fun set. With the use of Memento, you can make it even easier for teammates to sweep or set up. Ponyta and Vulpix are far superior offensive Pokemon overall due to their higher initial speed and offensive power.</p> <p>Flamethrower can be used over both Lava Plume and Fire Blast; however, because it offers very little increased damage output from the former, you're better off sticking to the listed STAB moves. Self-Destruct can also be used on either of these sets, to provide damage before Slugma faints and also help a teammate set up, but Memento is generally a superior choice. Rock Tomb can also be used on either set for more support because it reduces the Speed of the target. Yawn can also be used to force switches and rack up entry hazard damage. Slugma also has access to Curse and Stockpile, but its lackluster Defense and Attack stats mean it can't use these moves effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Slugma takes a large amount of damage just by switching into Stealth Rock and Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Slugma is a huge lure for Water-types such as Chinchou, Shellos, or Staryu. These Pokemon don't mind its STAB moves, or burns, and they are all special hitters, so they don't make contact anyway.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Drilbur, Hippopotas, and Sandshrew all do heavy damage to Slugma with their STAB Earthquake. Hippopotas also has Whirlwind, so it can phaze out the Pokemon Slugma set up screens for. However, many Ground-types hate being burned.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Archen, Tirtouga, Dwebble, and other Rock-types can switch into Slugma and threaten it with their STAB moves; however, they all must be wary of switching into a Lava Plume or Will-O-Wisp due to the increased burn chance. Tirtouga must also be wary of switching into an Earth Power, and Dwebble also does not resist Slugma's Fire-type STAB attacks. Archen is immune to Earth Power and can smack Slugma with STAB Rock Slide or Earthquake, as both moves avoid Flame Body's burn chance.</p> <p><strong>Munchlax</strong>: Munchlax, especially the Berry Juice set, does not particularly like being burned, but it doesn't mind any attack Slugma can throw at it. Munchlax also threatens Slugma with a super effective Earthquake, or use Rest to heal the burn.</p> <p><strong>Guts</strong>: Timburr threatens Slugma by switching in on a Will-O-Wisp or Lava Plume and gaining a boosted Drain Punch or Knock Off to hit Slugma with. Though it cannot switch into Slugma's attacks, Taillow is another great user of Guts. Larvitar has Guts, super effective STAB moves, and Dragon Dance, which it can use to set up on Slugma.</p>",

      "Status Spreader": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Recover keeps Slugma healthy enough to switch into physical attackers throughout the battle. Fire Blast is the suggested STAB move due to its ability to OHKO Eviolite Pawniard after Stealth Rock damage, but Lava Plume can be substituted for better accuracy and a higher chance to burn the target. Earth Power allows Slugma to hit common switch-ins like Chinchou and Tirtouga for super effective damage. Acid Armor allows you to set up on physically offensive Pokemon even further, and dares them to make contact with Slugma, which works very well with Will-O-Wisp and Toxic. Will-O-Wisp burns any target, regardless of whether contact is made or not. Toxic helps Slugma stall out Pokemon, while Earth Power hits Poison-types and Slugma's STAB move hits Steel-types, the Pokemon immune to Toxic. Memento can be used to give a team member a chance to set up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The provided EVs maximize Slugma's bulk while hitting Eviolite numbers. The Bold nature makes Slugma's Defense hit the Eviolite number 14. The EVs in HP hit a Stealth Rock number of 23, meaning Slugma can switch in times. Flame Body gives Slugma more chances to burn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Slugma into physical attackers that make contact, like Mienfoo and Fletchling. Keep Slugma away from Timburr and Taillow because of Guts, though Taillow generally won't switch in for fear of an offensive move from Slugma. Do not use Memento on Pawniard because it will gain an x2 boost to its Attack stat thanks to Defiant; however, Fire Blast easily eliminates it provided Stealth Rock is present, while Will-O-Wisp severely cripples it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lileep, Chespin, and Ferroseed are good partners to Slugma because they check or wall Water-types, which Slugma hates. Chespin also has an added bonus of countering Drilbur. An entry hazard remover is greatly appreciated by Slugma. Vullaby and Staryu are good choices because they are also good checks to Drilbur. Archen is also a good choice because it counters Taillow and checks Timburr. Croagunk, Spritzee, and Snubbull are also good team members because they all handle Timburr, while Snubbull and Croagunk can nail Munchlax with their super effective Fighting-type attacks.</p>"

Recover can be used over Memento if you prefer for your Dual Screener to last longer. Lava Plume has a good chance to burn things, which is important for Slugma's support, but Fire Blast has more power. The main draw Fire Blast has over Lava Plume is that Fire Blast OHKOes Eviolite Pawniard after Stealth Rock damage. Lava Plume is the preferred STAB move on this set because it can burn foes since it is not using Will-O-Wisp. However, Will-O-Wisp can be used over Reflect.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs give Slugma maximum bulk, with its Def bolstered by a Bold nature, and Special Defense hitting Eviolite numbers, and HP becoming a Stealth Rock number of 23. Flame Body gives Slugma more chances to burn foes that make contact. Eviolite gives Slugma more bulk, while Light Clay makes Screens last 3 turns longer.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch into physical attackers who make contact, like Mienfoo or Fletchling, so you can burn them with Flame Body. Set up Screens and then use Memento, but do not Memento on Pawniard because you will give it an x2 boost to its Attack stat Thanks to Defiant. Fire Blast easily disposes of Pawniard, provided Stealth Rock is active. Slugma is one of the best Memento users due to opponents not wanting to risk switching in Pawniard on Slugma.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Zigzagoon appreciates both Screens and Memento, which allows it to set up its Belly Drum easily. Other sweepers also enjoy this support,like Fletchling, Shell Smashers, and Timburr. An entry hazard remover like Vullaby, Drilbur, Archen, or Staryu is very appreciated by Slugma. Vullaby checks Drilbur, Archen counters Taillow and checks Timburr, while Drilbur and Staryu enjoy Slugma being able to counter Grass-types. Slugma can also absorb Will-O-Wisps for Drilbur, Vullaby, and Archen.</p>"

Endeavor is used when Swinub is down to 1 HP and it outspeeds its opponent.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and nature maximize Swinub's Speed and Attack. Oblivious prevents Swinub's from being Taunted, and therefore not being able to set up Stealth Rock.

    "overview": "<p>Remoraid is quite threatening due to its excellent STAB moves, Water Spout and Hydro Pump, and a vast coverage movepool. Its workable offensive stats and Speed coupled with its excellent capabilities with Choice items make it a viable offensive threat. However, Remoraid's poor defenses make it very easy to eliminate and its lack of priority moves renders it useless versus faster opponents.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Life Orb set can be utilized, as it allows Remoraid to vary its attacks, a feat unattainable when locked into a move by a Choice item. Scald is a more reliable Water-type STAB move with a useful added burn chance. Rock Blast provides Remoraid with a means of hitting Mantyke, which can otherwise tank all of Remoraid's attacks with ease. Thunder Wave is a good move to cripple enemies on a non-Choice item set, but Remoraid lacks the bulk to effectively spread paralysis. Scope Lens, coupled with the use of Focus Energy, gives Remoraid a 100% chance to land a critical hit, which will be boosted by Sniper. If it can survive at full HP for one turn, it can then launch a 2.25x Water Spout, which OHKOes most of the metagame. However, Scope Lens leaves Remoraid easily revenge killed, and this set has difficulty finding opportunity to set up. Hidden Power Grass can be used in lieu of another coverage move to hit Water-types with lower Special Defense, but a Hustle-boosted Bullet Seed usually does the job just fine. A purely physical Choice set can also work, but it can't make use of Remoraid's best move, Water Spout.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Other Choice Scarf users can outspeed and kill Remoraid before it gets a chance to land Water Spout. Fletchling and Pawniard both can either KO Remoraid or severely weaken its Water Spout with their respective strong priority attacks, Acrobatics and Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Remoraid finds itself utterly helpless after being paralyzed, as many attackers will outspeed and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Remoraid has difficulty breaking through special walls, such as Munchlax and Mantyke, as they can shrug off any hit that Remoraid throws at them.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Foongus and Pumpkaboo can take a Fire Blast and KO Remoraid with Giga Drain and Bullet Seed, respectively.</p>",

      "Mixed Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Water Spout is Remoraid's most threatening move, as it is the most powerful move in the game when Remoraid is at full health. Hydro Pump provides Remoraid with a secondary Water-type STAB option that is almost as powerful as Water Spout in case its HP is lowered significantly. Fire Blast is a fantastic coverage move, allowing Remoraid to hit Steel- and Grass-type Pokemon for super effective damage. Bullet Seed, bolstered by Remoraid's base 65 Attack stat, provides Remoraid with a means to hit Chinchou rather hard. Ice Beam can be used instead of Bullet Seed in order to hit Lileep and Flying-types for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs give Remoraid boosts to both its offensive stats and Speed, allowing it to outspeed and OHKO or 2HKO a large number of Pokemon in Little Cup. Hustle boosts the power of Bullet Seed, allowing Remoraid to nab some important KOs on opposing Water-type Pokemon, such as Chinchou. A Naive nature increases Remoraid's Speed even further while coming at no real cost to Remoraid, as it generally can't survive powerful attacks regardless; it is selected over Hasty due to the fact that most priority attacks are physical.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Remoraid's best strategy is simply to spam Water Spout, hitting everything that doesn't resist Water for big damage. Be sure to avoid opponents with priority moves, as these will severely lower Water Spout's damage output. Remoraid performs most effectively if switched in when the foe doesn't attack, so a VoltTurn strategy is very effective; this allows its HP to remain at full and its Water Spout to be quite potent.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulkier Pokemon aid Remoraid by taking hits that would otherwise severely damage it; its weaknesses, Electric and Grass, can be covered by a variety of Pokemon, such as Magnemite and Foongus. Entry hazard support from the likes of Drilbur and Onix is appreciated, as it assists Remoraid in KOing some of the bulkier Pokemon in the metagame. Likewise, entry hazard removers, such as Vullaby and Drilbur, are extremely helpful in keeping Remoraid at full health. VoltTurn users, especially slow ones, allow Remoraid to switch in without taking a hit. Knock Off support from Pokemon such as Pawniard is extremely beneficial, as it softens up opposing walls, which makes it easier for Remoraid to break through them.</p>"

Anything looking to outspeed it must watch out for STAB Sucker Punch, which is capable of taking down the likes of Fletchling. However, it is easily taken out because of its many weaknesses and extremely poor bulk, leaving it vulnerable to just about anything that can land a hit on it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nasty Plot could be used for a +2 Special Attack boost, but Houndour's poor bulk means setting up is often far too risky. An Eviolite set with Special Defense EVs is no longer useful due to the banning of Misdreavus. Additionally, a more physically inclined set with Crunch over Dark Pulse is usable, but Houndour's lower base Attack means this set is weaker overall and less effective at wallbreaking. Hidden Power Fighting hits opposing Houndour and Carvanha for an OHKO, but doesn't offer any other coverage that Houndour's STAB attacks don't already provide.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Scraggy can all take a hit and regain their HP with Drain Punch while KOing Houndour, though none of them like switching into Fire Blast.

    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is the strongest move on this set, capable of 2HKOing many defensive Pokemon, and the one it will be spamming most of the time once Houndour gets in safely. Dark Pulse is a more accurate secondary STAB with a nice flinch chance, getting near-perfect coverage alongside Fire Blast as well as super effective coverage on Ghost- and Psychic-types. Sucker Punch is Houndour's tool for taking out Pokemon that outspeed it or are using slower priority, such as Fletchling, although it is unreliable and can be taken advantage of. Destiny Bond can take out slower opponents, forcing a trade with one of Houndour's checks and possibly opening up a sweep for something else. Pursuit, on the other hand, ensures that the Ghost-types Houndour naturally checks don't get away for free. Substitute is a decent move that eases prediction, but is generally inferior to the listed moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread maximizes Special Attack and Speed with one point invested into Attack and Special Defense each. A Hasty nature lets Houndour hit 17 Speed, an important benchmark, while lowering Houndour's already pathetic Defense stat. 0 HP IVs are used to minimize recoil from Life Orb. The choice between Early Bird and Flash Fire is personal preference. Early Bird lets Houndour get around Trace Porygon and absorb sleep, mainly Foongus's Spore. Flash Fire gives Houndour an immunity to Fire-type moves, including Will-O-Wisp, and can power up Fire Blast when switching into them, but Houndour will have trouble switching into most users of these moves anyway. Life Orb is by far the best item for this set in order to hit as hard as possible while being able to switch moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In general, Houndour shouldn't be switched in on predicted attacking moves it isn't immune to, as it takes a lot of damage even from resisted attacks. Bringing Houndour in after a teammate is KOed or after a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is the best way to get it in safely. Prediction is key when using Houndour, as letting a check such as Timburr in for free on Sucker Punch can be disastrous, while not using Sucker Punch against a faster opponent will usually lead to Houndour's end.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Houndour appreciates teammates that can deal with Fighting-types. Trubbish and Croagunk do this well. As it is weak to Stealth Rock, entry hazard removal is a good idea when using Houndour; Drilbur, Vullaby, and Archen are all viable choices for this role. Sticky Web, while not being a particularly effective strategy in Little Cup, pairs very nicely with a Pokemon as strong as Houndour, fixing its Speed issues. Volt Switch and U-turn support is one of the best ways get Houndour on the field safely, and Chinchou, Magnemite, and Mienfoo are the most notable users of these moves. Lastly, another Dark-type such as Scraggy or Carvanha forms a good offensive core with Houndour, as Houndour can lure out one of their shared checks and take it out with Destiny Bond.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Once again, Fire Blast is the main move of this set, as its power is useful for revenge killing purposes and cleaning late-game. Dark Pulse serves the same purpose as a complementary STAB, and is a good move to spam with its great neutral coverage. Destiny Bond takes out any Pokemon Houndour can't KO once it has done its job. The last slot is mostly filler; Flamethrower is a more reliable Fire STAB with better accuracy at the cost of a bit of power, while Pursuit can be used for trapping purposes, but is weak and easy to take advantage of.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize power and Speed, with leftover EVs thrown into Attack and Special Defense. Hasty nature allows Houndour to outspeed Choice Scarf Pawniard and Speed tie with Choice Scarf Mienfoo, two important pokemon that Houndour definitely wants to outspeed. Use 36 Defense EVs with a Timid nature if Pursuit is not used. As Houndour won't be able to break through Porygon anyway, Flash Fire has a bit more merit on this set, but Early Bird can still be used for absorbing sleep status.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set works best late-game, when it can sweep through weakened teams with Fire Blast or Dark Pulse. It also can be used to take out threatening Pokemon with Destiny Bond earlier in the game, or to revenge kill Pokemon such as Pawniard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set still needs things to handle Fighting-types, so Trubbish and Croagunk are again excellent choices. This set likes entry hazard support for easier cleaning; Dwebble and again, Trubbish, are good choices for hazard layers. As Houndour will need to switch out often, Rapid Spin support from Drilbur is appreciated even more. Carvanha and Scraggy again work well with Houndour as they can weaken or KO each other's checks.</p>"

  "Phanpy": {
    "overview": "<p>Phanpy has stellar physical bulk and a fair typing, though it faces stiff competition from other Ground-types. Phanpy misses out on Rapid Spin, unlike its older brother Donphan, causing it to lose ground to Sandshrew and Drilbur. Meager special bulk further undermines Phanpy's viability. However, Phanpy's access to Knock Off allows it to differentiate itself from Drilbur and Hippopotas, and Ice Shard allows Phanpy to pick off faster threats whereas Sandshrew can't. Various other options such as Play Rough, Roar, Head Smash, and Gunk Shot give Phanpy a more distinct niche, though rather situational.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Play Rough can be run in order to hit Fighting-types harder, though it's rather weak outside of this. Head Smash is another option, which hits Vullaby much harder than Play Rough and allows Phanpy to OHKO Larvesta on the switch. Head Smash also prevents Archen and Fletchling from trying to switch into Phanpy. However, it does hamper Phanpy's niche as a defensive Pokemon due to recoil and has undesirable accuracy. Rock Tomb is a weaker alternative to Head Smash which slows down switch-ins, allowing Phanpy to Speed tie with Pokemon with 17 Speed. Gunk Shot nails common Grass-type switch-ins such as Chespin, Snover, and Cottonee, but many other common Grass-types aren't weak to Poison and the move is inaccurate. Lastly, Toxic can be used to wear down walls and provides more utility for the team, though Phanpy has limited opportunities to use it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types can easily switch into Phanpy due to its weak offenses and threaten it with their STAB attacks. Slowpoke is an example of such, and has the bulk and the power to easily handle Phanpy; however, Slowpoke will need to be wary of Knock Off. Corphish and Totodile are other examples that have the raw power to KO Phanpy. The rare Mantyke avoids Phanpy's STAB moves while threatening it back with Scald. However, stray Rock Tombs and Head Smashes will swiftly deal with Mantyke. Staryu and Shellder can comfortably switch in, spin away entry hazards, and KO Phanpy with ease.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon easily switch into Phanpy and can typically KO it with their STAB moves. Foongus, Lileep, and Cottonee are defensive answers to Phanpy, able to counter and KO it. Snivy is an offensive answer, grabbing a nice +2 off of Phanpy as it KOes with Leaf Storm, and doesn't take much damage from Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Mienfoo and Cottonee can Taunt Phanpy, preventing it from using Stealth Rock and effectively decimating Phanpy's immediate usefulness.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Entry hazard removers can make Phanpy useless at times. Vullaby is a good example, as it doesn't mind Knock Off and Phanpy's coverage moves too badly, can Defog away entry hazards, and can KO Phanpy.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock endows Phanpy with the ability to support its teammates. Knock Off allows for walls to be more easily broken down and in general helps the team break past common Water- and Grass-types. Earthquake is Phanpy's STAB move of choice, hitting most Pokemon for decent damage while having nice coverage alongside Knock Off. The last slot is a toss-up between Roar and Ice Shard. Roar helps make up for Phanpy's weaker offensive presence, making setting up on Phanpy impossible, while also having utility in ruining the opposing team's momentum. Ice Shard can be used over Roar, however, as it deals extra chip damage and can potentially pick off weakened Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Phanpy's EV spread allows it to outspeed both Skrelp and Timburr while having impressive physical bulk, bolstered further thanks to Eviolite. An Impish nature gives Phanpy the highest Defense stat it can get but still allows Phanpy to hit with some power thanks to its Attack investment. Pickup is the chosen ability due to being the most likely to activate in battle; however, it is still often useless.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When using Phanpy, strive to set up Stealth Rock early-game against physical attackers, such as Diglett, Croagunk, Dwebble, and Larvesta, while avoiding special attacks. Use Roar as the opponent brings in their Phanpy switch-in to keep momentum in your favor. Use Knock Off versus bulky Pokemon to help your team run through them late-game. If Phanpy is running Ice Shard, just use it to scavenge a KO on a threat that is low on health.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Lileep make for great teammates for Phanpy, as Ferroseed is able to stack Spikes and covers Phanpy's weaknesses well, while Lileep absorbs Scalds and other special attacks nicely. However, be aware of their shared Ice-type weakness. A variety of Water-types such as Tentacool and Skrelp can easily tank special hits aimed at Phanpy while resisting Ice- and Water-type attacks. Tentacool can get rid of entry hazards with Rapid Spin and has the ability Liquid Ooze to annoy Giga Drain and Drain Punch users, whereas Skrelp adds great offensive power to your team. General walls such as Spritzee and Porygon have great bulk and enjoy the use of Stealth Rock. Spritzee has the added bonus of being able to pass Wishes to Phanpy in order to recover its HP. In theory, Phanpy defeats Poison- and Steel-types for Spritzee while gracefully taking Fighting-type attacks for Porygon. Unfortunately, Ferroseed counters Phanpy, and Phanpy fails to check a number of Poison-types due to their secondary typing allowing them to hit Phanpy for STAB super effective damage or evade Earthquake. As a result, Vullaby pairs nicely with Phanpy as well to deal with these foes.</p>"

  "Smoochum": {
    "overview": "<p>The pre-evolution of everyone's favorite Pokemon, Smoochum is rather interesting with its unique Psychic / Ice typing. It has a very good offensive typing for dealing with common Fighting-, Flying-, and Poison-types in the tier. It has the highest Special Attack stat of any Ice-type in the tier. Smoochum's ability, Oblivious, means it cannot be affected by Taunt, and it can take advantage of this with setup moves such as Substitute and Nasty Plot. It also has a decent 17 Speed. However, there are some downsides to using this little cutie. It has absolutely terrible defenses, and anything with a super effective move will probably take it out. On top of this, its Ice typing leaves it weak to entry hazards. Unlike its evolution, Jynx, it does not have access to Lovely Kiss. Along with its poor defenses, Smoochum is also plagued with terrible weaknesses to the common Dark-, Bug-, Fire-, Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types, and only resists Psychic- and Ice-type moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Even though Smoochum seems like it would be a Pokemon with many viable options, there are in fact not many other possibilities for it. It can run a dual screens set, but is highly outclassed in this role. It also has access to Wish, but cannot utilize it as well as bulkier Pokemon like Lickitung. Smoochum can use a different Hidden Power type according to its team's needs, but Hidden Power Fighting is normally best. A Calm Mind set is usable, but it is generally outclassed by Nasty Plot due to Smoochum's low defenses. With its rare access to Perish Song, Smoochum can force a switch at the cost of a coverage move. Hail and Blizzard can be used on a bulkier set to annoy opposing Pokemon while maintaining a powerful, perfectly accurate STAB move. Lastly, Smoochum has access to Heal Bell, but once again it is severely outclassed by bulkier alternatives.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pawniard</strong>: Pawniard can switch in on either of Smoochum's STAB moves with relative ease and can force a switch if Smoochum does not have Hidden Power Fighting. Even with Hidden Power Fighting, Smoochum loses to Sucker Punch unless it also carries Substitute. Choice Scarf Pawniard can easily outspeed and KO Smoochum with Iron Head or Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Honedge</strong>: Honedge can come in on anything Smoochum has to throw at it, fearing only the rare Shadow Ball. It does not fear Hidden Power Fighting like other Steel-types, and can OHKO with Shadow Sneak without worrying about Choice Scarf or Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Most Dark-types, such as Houndour, Pawniard, and Carvanha, can check Smoochum if they can get a free switch-in.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types will not take much damage from any of Smoochum's moves other than Hidden Power Fighting. Some can easily take a Hidden Power Fighting and check Smoochum back with a super effective STAB move or wall it entirely.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types can usually beat Smoochum one-on-one, as they are typically faster and can OHKO it. Ponyta can come in on anything but a Choice Scarfed Psychic. Houndour resists Ice Beam, is unaffected by Psychic, and only fears Hidden Power Fighting. It also has access to Sucker Punch, which can take care of Smoochum as long as it's not behind a Substitute.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Setup": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam and Psychic are the main STAB moves, which hit common threats such as Vullaby, Timburr, Mienfoo, and Croagunk. Substitute allows Smoochum to safely avoid status, and possibly gain a free turn. Alternatively, Nasty Plot can boost Smoochum's already amazing Special Attack even higher. Hidden Power Fighting deals with the Dark- and Steel-types that would otherwise counter Smoochum, such as Pawniard, Aron, Shieldon, Houndour, and Magnemite. Shadow Ball is another option that can catch Slowpoke and other Psychic-types off-guard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>240 Special Attack EVs give Smoochum a great deal of power. 240 Speed EVs along with a Timid nature allow to hit a valuable 17 Speed, which is great in Little Cup. This Speed allows Smoochum to outspeed most non-Choice Scarf Pokemon as well as Speed tie with threats like Mienfoo. With 0 HP IVs, it takes minimal damage from Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Setting up, preferably with Memento or dual screens support from a teammate, should always be the focus of this set, as a Nasty Plot or Substitute is necessary for proper sweeping. Avoid priority moves at all costs as they hurt Smoochum greatly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Many Pokemon complement Smoochum nicely, and it has an abundance of well-suited teammates. Houndour makes an especially good teammate, as it can absorb Fire-type moves, resists Dark-, Ghost-, and Steel-type moves, and Smoochum can check Fighting-types for it. Smoochum appreciates entry hazards just as much as any other Pokemon, so a Pokemon with Stealth Rock or Spikes, such as Ferroseed, can help immensely. Smoochum appreciates Rapid Spin support even more, due to its frailty and weakness to Stealth Rock. A physically bulky Rapid Spinner or Defogger can clear hazards for Smoochum while also taking hits for it. A good option would be either Tentacool to take Bug- or Fire-type moves, or Drilbur to take Rock-type moves and check Steel-types such as Honedge and Pawniard. Archen is also a good choice as it can Defog and use U-turn to keep offensive momentum. Along with entry hazards, Smoochum also needs substantial team support, such as a dual screens user, to help it take hits and set up with Substitute or Nasty Plot.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic and Ice Beam are the main STAB moves to either revenge kill Pokemon or hit them extremely hard. Shadow Ball hits opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Slowpoke and Wynaut, while Hidden Power Fighting hits pesky Dark- and Steel-types. Lastly, Trick can cripple a foe and afterwards allow Smoochum to switch moves if it needs to.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With a Choice Scarf, Smoochum is able to hit extremely hard and become a powerful revenge killer. It can Trick its Choice Scarf to cripple foe, giving away its item in exchange for a possibly better one. With 240 EVs in Special Attack, its attacks can put a dent in any team. It also has 240 Speed EVs to hit 16 Speed, which the Choice Scarf boosts to 24 Speed. A Modest nature is preferred to boost Smoochum's already amazing Special Attack even higher, as 24 Speed is enough to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Revenge killing is the job of the Choice Scarf set, and it can be used late-game to finish teams off or to cripple a single foe. Bear in mind that Smoochum will be locked into a single move, so prediction is key. It should Trick away its Choice Scarf onto foes that threaten the rest of your team, or on a predicted ineffective move like Sucker Punch. Smoochum should always try to come into battle unscathed, so make sure that all entry hazards have been removed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Smoochum appreciates entry hazards just as much as any other Pokemon, so a Pokemon with Stealth Rock or Spikes can help greatly. Trubbish is a good teammate as it can check Pawniard as well as set up Spikes for Smoochum. It also appreciates Rapid Spin support. A physically bulky Rapid Spinner or Defogger can clear entry hazards for Smoochum, while also taking hits for it. A good option would be Tentacool to take Bug- or Fire-type moves, or Drilbur to take Rock-type moves and check Steel-types such as Honedge and Pawniard. Snover works well with Smoochum as its hail allows Smoochum to use Blizzard as a hard-hitting, perfectly accurate STAB move. Houndour once again makes a great teammate, as it absorbs Fire-type moves, resists Dark- and Steel-type moves, and appreciates Smoochum's ability to check Fighting-types.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Elekid is very fast, hitting 20 Speed, which is the fastest unboosted Speed tier in the metagame. However, Elekid is also extremely frail, meaning that it can't switch in as often as it would like to and it is ripped apart by priority moves, which plague the tier. Thankfully for Elekid, sand is not as important as it was in BW, boosting Elekid's viability to an extent.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cross Chop can be replaced with Brick Break if you have accuracy concerns. However, this is not advised on the special set, as Brick Break misses out on many of the KOes that Cross Chop provides. Meditate, Ice Punch, Quick Attack, and Thief are options on the physical set as well, but are generally not great moves due to either four-moveslot syndrome or inferior coverage. Even with Ice Punch, for example, Elekid will still lose to Ground-types. Focus Punch is also an interesting move that Elekid has access to and can be used with Substitute over Volt Switch and Cross Chop on the physical set. Signal Beam is an option on the special set, but it provides inferior coverage. Elekid also has access to both Discharge and Thunder Wave, but Elekid lacks the bulk to spread paralysis well and its common switch-ins don't care about paralysis.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Diglett</strong>: Diglett traps and Speed ties with Elekid. It can either OHKO Elekid with Earthquake after its Focus Sash is used, assuming that Elekid wins the Speed tie, or eliminate a weakened Elekid with Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Drilbur and Hippopotas can both wall and OHKO Elekid. Drilbur can also set up on Elekid with Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Foongus, Ferroseed, and Cottonee are able to wall Elekid. However, Foongus is 2HKOed by Psychic, while Cottonee must watch out for Fire Punch and Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Chinchou</strong>: Chinchou walls Elekid and can 2HKO it with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Special Walls</strong>: Walls such as Porygon, Lickitung, Munchlax, and Spritzee can take multiple assaults from Elekid's special set, while they can easily 2HKO Elekid with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: These Pokemon can use Elekid as setup bait, as they are able to take a majority of Elekid's attacks with ease. They then recover back to full HP with Berry Juice. Magnemite can eliminate Elekid with Hidden Power Ground after Life Orb recoil, Onix completely walls Elekid, Dwebble can use Elekid as setup bait for entry hazards, and other Sturdy Pokemon can use it as setup bait for Shell Smash.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: With Elekid's blaring frailty, it's not hard to see why priority easily checks it. Strong priority users such as Timburr, Fletchling, and Pawniard easily 2HKO most of Elekid's sets.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Entry hazards wear Elekid down, and when taking Life Orb recoil into account, it won't be able to switch in and pivot around as much as it would like to, limiting Elekid's survivability.</p>",

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is used as Elekid's main STAB move, while Volt Switch is used for scouting early-game and acting as a decent pivot. Psychic is a decent coverage option, as it 2HKOes Foongus, one of the most common switch-ins to Elekid. Substitute is an excellent move to use on Elekid, as it allows Elekid to bypass Sucker Punch and eliminate the Pokemon using it, as well as defeat Carvanha. Elekid can also become a decent mixed attacker by using Cross Chop. Hidden Power Ground is generally the best choice of Hidden Power, as it hits Chinchou and Magnemite, which would normally wall Elekid, for super effective damage. Hidden Power Grass can be used to maintain coverage against Chinchou, while also hitting Ground-types such as Drilbur for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>240 Special Attack and 236 Speed EVs maximize Elekid's Speed and Special Attack, while 0 IVs in HP make it so that Elekid only loses 1 HP after taking damage from Life Orb recoil. A Timid nature allows Elekid to hit 20 Speed, although Elekid should use a Hasty nature and an EV spread of 16 Atk / 240 SpA / 236 Spe if it uses Cross Chop. Static is the preferred ability, as Elekid will lose to Foongus anyways and Static gives Elekid a clutch chance to paralyze a Pokemon that makes contact, sometimes supporting the team even when Elekid is KOed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because Elekid is extremely frail, it is important to use it as a revenge killer. Elekid should not be switching into anything, as it will likely be KOed. It is also important to always use Volt Switch if Elekid is in a bad match-up or switch out if the opposing Pokemon has priority.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Diglett is able to trap and KO opposing Electric-types such as Chinchou, as well as other common switch-ins to Elekid. Drilbur can perform a similar role as Diglett, but it does not have the ability to trap opponents. However, while they both have access to Stealth Rock, Drilbur also boasts Rapid Spin to support Elekid. Staryu and other bulky Water-types can KO Ground-types such as Diglett, Drilbur, and Hippopotas, but Staryu can also give Rapid Spin support. Poison-types such as Croagunk, Trubbish, and Koffing are also useful as they can wall and defeat both Foongus and Cottonee. Fire-types such as Ponyta, Houndour, and Larvesta can also be used to eliminate Grass-types. They also have the added bonus of defeating Ferroseed, which walls Elekid lacking Cross Chop with ease. Mienfoo and Fletchling can help form a decent VoltTurn core with Elekid. Knock Off users like Pawniard are very good partners, as they can remove Berry Juice from Pokemon with Sturdy and Eviolite from bulky Pokemon such as Chinchou and Foongus, which helps to wear them down faster. Entry hazard users are also important partners, as they make walls easier to break down by dealing passive damage to them.</p>"

Fire Punch also provides good coverage by hitting common Grass-type switch-ins, but it is mostly a filler.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack and 236 Speed EVs maximize physical offensive stats, while 0 HP IVs minimize Life Orb recoil. A Hasty nature is chosen so as not to reduce Volt Switch's damage, but a Jolly nature can be used if Elekid is not using Volt Switch. Static is the best ability once again, as Elekid will always lose to Foongus and the chance to paralyze can be very crucial in certain moments.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Elekid should be played a bit more cautiously with this set. This is because Elekid is extremely frail, while also being worn down quickly by both Life Orb and Wild Charge recoil. Elekid is best used as a revenge killer and should never switch into powerful attacks. Also, be sure to pivot around with Elekid early-game and always switch out of any priority attacks aimed at it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Diglett is able to trap and KO Chinchou, while also supporting Elekid with Stealth Rock. Drilbur does the same as Diglett, but cannot trap the opponent. However, it does have Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock to support Elekid.

Poison-types such as Croagunk, Trubbish and Koffing can wall and defeat both Foongus and Cottonee, although it isn't as important to use them as partners for this set. Fletchling and Mienfoo can form a decent VoltTurn core, assuming that Elekid is using Volt Switch. Knock Off users can help Elekid out a lot as they make it easier for Elekid to break down walls.

Its movepool contains gems such as Belly Drum, Mach Punch, Cross Chop, Flare Blitz, and more. However, the blessings don't end there; it gets access to two good abilities, Flame Body and Vital Spirit, as well as being a Fire-type, which prevents burns and is generally potent offensively. While slightly held back by its fragility and weakness to Stealth Rock, as well as its susceptibility to priority, Magby is not a Pokemon to be underestimated.</p>",

A mixed set consisting of Flare Blitz / Mach Punch / Thunder Punch / Overheat is usable, but Cross Chop is usually preferred over Overheat. A Substitute + Focus Punch set is also decent, but Magby struggles to force switches and get a Substitute up. However, this can be quite powerful if used successfully.

Some Ghosts, like Frillish, can easily absorb a Flare Blitz and OHKO back.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Priority Users</strong>: Corphish, Timburr, Croagunk and other durable priority users can tank Magby's Mach Punch and KO it with Aqua Jet, Mach Punch or other priority; Timburr even benefits from a burn because of its ability, Guts.</p> <p><strong>Flash Fire</strong>: If using Flash Fire, Ponyta and Growlithe can switch into Fire Punch or Flare Blitz, get a boost from Flash Fire, and in Ponyta's case, Speed tie. However, both can survive a hit and OHKO back.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Anything faster than Magby can KO it unless they are weak to Mach Punch, due to Magby's frailty.</p> <p><strong>Hippopotas</strong>: Hippopotas takes negligible damage from the Life Orb set and can survive a +6 Fire Punch while OHKOing back with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Diglett</strong>: If its Focus Sash is intact, Diglett can switch in, outspeed Magby, and KO with Sucker Punch.</p>",

      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Belly Drum boosts Magby's Attack stat to 68, letting it destroy the metagame. Fire Punch is Magby's primary physical STAB move, and it does enough at +6 to justify not using Flare Blitz. Mach Punch provides Magby priority to use on Pokemon it would Speed tie with or be outsped by, such as Meowth and Elekid. Return OHKOes Chinchou at +6, a very important benchmark, and does heavy damage to Pokemon that resist Fire, such as Munchlax and Shellder. Flame Charge lets Magby outspeed all relevant Choice Scarf users after a boost so that it does not have to rely on the relatively weak Mach Punch to damage them. Thunder Punch can also hit some of the Water-types that resist Fire Punch, such as Slowpoke, super effectively, but Return is usually enough.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Magby can potentially reach 19 Speed, and this set does so, making it impossible for Pawniard to revenge kill it, barring the very rare and exploitable Choice Scarf Sucker Punch. This set utilizes only 29 HP IVs, which allows Magby to activate Berry Juice's recovery immediately after using Belly Drum. Berry Juice grants Magby recovery, getting it back to full HP no matter what. Vital Spirit lets Magby be one of the best Foongus switch-ins and protects it from other sleepers, like Gastly. Finally, Flame Body can be used to cripple any Pokemon trying to use Fake Out to chip away at it, such as Mienfoo, Aipom, and Meowth.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Magby should be brought in by means of revenging or a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, preferably coming in on something that can not threaten it, such as Snover, Larvesta, Mienfoo, or Foongus lacking Stun Spore. Keep in mind, however, that Magby is extremely frail and will fall to many powerful neutral attacks. Magby can also switch in on Will-O-Wisp for free, as it cannot be burned due to its typing. Once Magby has gotten in, set up Belly Drum and sweep. It's okay to retreat, however, as switching it into a Fake Out can burn the foe, effectively neutering it; however, only do that if you must.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit trapping from the likes of Pawniard can easily facilitate a Magby sweep, as Ghost-types are immune to its only form of priority. Defog or Rapid Spin support is also appreciated, as Stealth Rock chips off a quarter of Magby's HP, and Sticky Web neuters it. Sticky Web support is appreciated, as it usually prevents grounded foes from outspeeding it, meaning Magby doesn't have to use Mach Punch. Knock Off support is also appreciated to stop Choice Scarf users and remove Eviolites. Magby draws status like moths to a flame, so a status absorber or cleric is appreciated as a teammate. Any way to weaken bulky Water-types like Chinchou is appreciated; for example, Hidden Power Ground Magnemite can lure in and weaken the foe's Chinchou, and Mienfoo or Pawniard can Knock Off Slowpoke's Eviolite. Finally, Pokemon with Sturdy can usually withstand Magby's attacks, so Stealth Rock support is appreciated.</p>"

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is Magby's most powerful physical STAB attack, and it has immense power, especially under the sun. Cross Chop hits Munchlax and Porygon hard, as well as Rock-types. Return hits Chinchou considerably harder and provides decent neutral coverage. Thunder Punch, however, hits Archen and bulky Water-types not named Chinchou harder. Finally, Mach Punch gives Magby priority and OHKOes Pawniard while bypassing Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs and a positive nature allow Magby to reach 19 Speed, bypassing Pawniard's Sucker Punch. It can also Speed tie with or outspeed many common Pokemon, such as Aipom, Pawniard, and Mienfoo. All the remaining EVs are put into Attack to let Magby hit harder. Life Orb lends Magby much more power, and 0 HP IVs cause it to only lose 1 HP per attack. Vital Spirit gives Magby a safe switch against Foongus and other sleep-inducing Pokemon like Gastly. Flame Body can also be used, as it lets Magby have a chance of burning a Fake Out or faster / more durable priority user as Magby goes down; however, Magby will only have one shot at this, as almost any attack will KO it after the recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is recommended that you bring Magby in safely, whether by means of a slow Volt Switch, U-Turn, a switch into a resisted attack, or by revenging something. Will-O-Wisp is an excellent attack to switch in on, as Magby cannot be burned by nature of its typing. Once it is in, it can break opponents down with its powerful attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit trapping by the likes of Pawniard and Stunky can defeat the Ghost-types that are immune to three of Magby's attacks. Defog or Rapid Spin support is recommended, as Stealth Rock hurts, and Sticky Web neuters Magby. Sticky Web support is appreciated, as it prevents Diglett from switching in and KOing with Sucker Punch, and also prevents Pokemon like Carvanha from outspeeding Magby after one boost. Finally, any way to weaken bulky Water-types like Chinchou is appreciated; for example, Hidden Power Grass Chinchou can weaken opposing Chinchou, and Mienfoo or Pawniard can Knock Off Slowpoke's Eviolite.</p>"

  "Larvitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Larvitar has a great offensive STAB combination that is virtually unresisted in LC. It also gets Dragon Dance, a great setup move that boosts its Attack and Speed. Larvitar also has an amazing ability in Guts, meaning it can easily absorb Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, as its typing makes it immune to Thunder Wave.</p> <p>While Larvitar's Rock / Ground typing is great offensively, it is horrible defensively. Larvitar is 4x weak to Water- and Grass-type moves, as well as 2x weak to Fighting-type moves, which run rampant in LC. Although Larvitar gets Dragon Dance, it only hits 14 Speed with a Jolly nature, which means that it is outsped by common Choice Scarf users, such as Pawniard and Mienfoo. It also faces competition from common setup sweepers such as Tirtouga and Omanyte, as they have a better boosting move in Shell Smash and better bulk. Lastly, Larvitar needs Flame Orb to ensure that Guts activates, but it is frail without Eviolite's bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Polish is great for allowing Larvitar to outspeed common Choice Scarf Pokemon. However, when using Rock Polish, Larvitar has to run Flame Orb to boost its Attack, and it doesn't tend to force as many switches as it would like to get a free boost. Crunch can be used strictly to keep Pumpkaboo in check, as most other Ghost-types are either weak to or hit hard by Larvitar's STAB moves. Poison Jab can be used to hit Fairy-types. However, the most common Fairy-types, Spritzee and Cottonee, both have ways to deal with it, as Spritzee can tank a +1 Poison Jab, and Cottonee can Encore Larvitar into Dragon Dance or OHKO it with Giga Drain. Larvitar can use Stealth Rock as a last-ditch attempt to get hazards up, but there are better hazard setters in LC, and Larvitar would rather be attacking or setting up a sweep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users, such as Pawniard, Drilbur, and Mienfoo, can outspeed Larvitar even after one Dragon Dance and KO it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types, such as Cottonee and Foongus, can OHKO Larvitar, even with Eviolite, while also taking Larvitar's STAB moves with ease.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types, such as Corphish and Chinchou, can OHKO Eviolite Larvitar with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Fighting-types</strong>: Mienfoo and Timburr can both take a +1 Earthquake and recover the health back with Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Larvitar is weak to many priority moves, including Mach Punch, Vacuum Wave, Aqua Jet, and Bullet Punch, although it resists two important priority attacks in Fletchling's Acrobatics and Zigzagoon's Extreme Speed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>After one Dragon Dance, Larvitar can outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Rock Slide is a reliable STAB move, though Stone Edge may be used for more power at the cost of accuracy. Earthquake takes the next slot, as it is a nice STAB move and synergizes well with Rock Slide. Superpower allows Larvitar to nail Ferroseed, Porygon, and Lileep, which all have the bulk to take Larvitar's STAB moves even after a boost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>244 Attack EVs and 188 Speed EVs are used to reach Larvitar's maximum potential. The rest of the EVs are put into Defense and Special Defense to hit Eviolite numbers. Eviolite is used to let Larvitar take more hits and set up more reliably. Flame Orb, however, can be used to ensure Guts activates and gives Larvitar more initial power. Jolly Larvitar reaches 14 Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after a Dragon Dance. With an Adamant nature, Larvitar only reaches 13 Speed, meaning that after a boost it Speed ties with 19 Speed Pokemon, such as Ponyta and Abra, and can be outsped by 20 Speed Pokemon, such as Diglett and Elekid.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With Eviolite, Larvitar can tank weak neutral or resisted hits, such as Fletchling's and Taillow's STAB moves. Trubbish is great setup bait as well, as it is threatened by a STAB Earthquake. Larvitar must watch out for super effective hits, however. Larvitar is best used mid- or late-game when its checks and counters have been worn down or KOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cottonee is the best partner for Larvitar, resisting Fighting-, Ground-, Water-, and Grass-type moves. In return, Larvitar resists Fire- and Poison-type moves for Cottonee. They both share a Steel weakness, however. Memento support gives Larvitar more opportunities to set up and is an absolute must if you opt for Flame Orb, as Larvitar doesn't have the bulk to take hits without Eviolite and can only reliably set up on Taillow and Fletchling. Knock Off users, such as Pawniard and Mienfoo, are imperative, as they knock off Eviolite and Berry Juice, allowing Larvitar to power through walls that can avoid the OHKO or 2HKO. Entry hazard support is useful for Larvitar, breaking Sturdy and weakening opponents in general. Archen in particular is a good partner as it can Defog away hazards as well as set them. Surskit and Spinarak are good Sticky Web users, and Larvitar appreciates the Speed drop to the opponent.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Slide is Larvitar's preferred Rock-type STAB move because of its higher accuracy and PP along with the additional chance to flinch it has. Stone Edge, despite being more powerful, has lower accuracy as well as a low PP of only 8; however, it 2HKOes bulky Vullaby, which Rock Slide fails to do, and has a high critical hit ratio. Earthquake is Larvitar's strongest STAB move that deals good damage to neutral foes, and it notably OHKOes Chinchou's Berry Juice set and 2HKOes its RestTalk set. Earthquake also OHKOes Ponyta and Pawniard after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKOes Skrelp, Omanyte, and Honedge, as well as Foongus after its Eviolite has been Knocked Off. Superpower provides coverage for popular bulky Pokemon in the metagame like Munchlax, Porygon, and Ferroseed, as well as Scraggy, all of which are 2HKOed by Superpower. Crunch is used mainly to handle Pumpkaboo-XL, which is 3HKOed by Crunch; it also hurts other bulky Ghost-types, such as Frillish. Pursuit can be used to get chip damage on Fletchling and damage Pokemon that are likely to switch out of Larvitar, such as Gastly. It can also be used to activate Guts by making contact with Pokemon with Flame Body, such as Larvesta and Ponyta, both of which are likely to switch out of Larvitar as well. Pursuit can also be used to break Abra's Focus Sash.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread, nature, and Choice Scarf maximize Lavitar's Attack and Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and potentially OHKO Ponyta, Chinchou, Archen, and Larvesta, as well as 2HKO Pokemon such as Vullaby, Skrelp, Honedge, Ferroseed, Scraggy, Munchlax, Porygon, Omanyte, and Croagunk. Guts lets Larvitar absorb status, such as burn and poison, and boost its Attack by 1 stage. The remaining EVs are distributed to HP and Defense to increase Larvitar's longevity and to slightly decrease the chances of it being KOed by priority moves like Sucker Punch, Mach Punch, and Vacuum Wave after it has been weakened by chip damage from the burn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Larvitar should never be left to face Water- or Grass-types unless it can KO them, as even the weakest STAB Grass- or Water-type moves can OHKO it. It should switch out immediately if faced with an Aqua Jet user, such as Corphish or Carvanha. Switch Larvitar into a Will-O-Wisp to make it even more effective offensively. If there are Flying-types or Pokemon with Levitate in the opponent's team, predict carefully to avoid incorrectly locking Larvitar into Earthquake and wasting a turn having to switch it out. As this set lacks bulk and may be weakened by chip damage from burn or poison, it's important to make accurate predictions when switching it in, especially against Pokemon that have access to coverage that might KO Larvitar. Larvitar could be switched into Poison- or Normal-type moves, which it resists. Weakened Pokemon that could be switching out can be trapped using Pursuit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>It is essential to pair Larvitar with Pokemon that resist Grass, Water, and Fighting, so Croagunk, Foongus, Sewaddle, and Cottonee make for ideal partners, as they resist all three types. Other checks can also be used, such as Vullaby, Ponyta, and Larvesta, which resist Grass; Snubbull, Gothita, and Spritzee, which resist Fighting; and Snivy and Ferroseed, which resist Water. Pokemon with access to Knock Off also make for good teammates, as they weaken foes for Larvitar. Likewise, Pokemon that prefer not facing Fire-, Flying-, Steel-, and Rock-types and want them out of the way can benefit from Larvitar's presence, as it can beat such foes easily.</p>"

  "Treecko": {
    "overview": "<p>Once Treecko drinks its Berry Juice, Unburden allows it to outpace every viable Choice Scarf Pokemon bar Gastly. Swords Dance and a decent Attack allow Treecko to hit relatively hard after a boost; this power is backed up by its great coverage versus the metagame. However, using Treecko is feast or famine. It cannot switch into any attack and only has a single chance to sweep. Being somewhat frail, Treecko struggles to set up and is threatened by priority users. Treecko also cannot wear down its own counters, due to it being pitifully weak before setting up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Endure allows Treecko to survive any hit and greatly helps versus faster Pokemon, as it allows Treecko to reliably activate Unburden; however, without Swords Dance, Treecko suffers from being extremely weak, and without all of its coverage moves, too many Pokemon wall Treecko for it to reliably sweep. Substitute can be run to guard against status and to protect Treecko until Berry Juice is consumed, though it has the same issues as Endure. Rock Slide is an option over either Drain Punch or Acrobatics; however, it is almost always inferior to both, as Archen and Fletchling both survive an unboosted Rock Slide, with Fletchling being able to simply revenge kill Treecko before it could boost and follow up with an attack. Rock Slide, however, does allow Treecko to beat Larvesta without risking a burn. Focus Sash is an inferior option to Berry Juice because it requires you to constantly have entry hazards cleared for Treecko and to rely on the Focus Sash to break in order for Unburden to activate. Leaf Storm and Hidden Power Fire are somewhat viable options to consider on Treecko, though they are rather weak and are often inferior to Drain Punch and Bullet Seed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Due to Flying-types both hitting hard and having adequate bulk to survive most of Treecko's attacks, they typically make for rather good checks and counters to Treecko. Vullaby and Archen both take very little from anything Treecko can do and can retaliate back with STAB Brave Bird and Acrobatics, respectively. Fletchling, while it cannot switch in safely, can cleanly revenge kill Treecko with Gale Wings Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types resist Grass and tend to be bulky enough to easily survive anything Treecko can use, even after Knock Off. Koffing can burn Treecko or hit it with Sludge Bomb before Treecko can even dent it, as can Skrelp, though Skrelp takes notably more damage from Treecko. Stunky has STAB Sucker Punch and Aftermath along with rather decent bulk, allowing it to cleanly KO Treecko or, if it gets KOed instead, inflict chip damage on it. Trubbish has a powerful Gunk Shot and reliable recovery, enabling it to repeatedly counter Treecko.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Ponyta can switch into any of Treecko's attacks, threatening with burns through Flame Body and KOing with Flare Blitz. Thunder Wave users such as Ferroseed and Porygon and Will-O-Wisp users such as Pumpkaboo greatly limit Treecko's effectiveness, essentially turning most Pokemon into a counter.</p> <p><strong>Honedge</strong>: Honedge resists or is immune to all of Treecko's attacks by virtue of its unique typing, letting it set up on and KO Treecko.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: If Unburden has not been activated, Gastly, Doduo, Larvesta, Mienfoo, and a variety of Choice Scarf users can all switch in and either force Treecko out or KO it immediately.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Multiple priority attacks can KO Treecko, making Pawniard, Croagunk, Fletchling, Shellder, Houndour, and the like checks to a weakened Treecko.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance, alongside Unburden, turns Treecko into a rather brilliant sweeper. The preferred STAB option is Bullet Seed, as it allows Treecko to bypass Substitutes, lets it set up on and KO Focus Sash Abra, and has the ability to hit extremely hard at five hits. However, Seed Bomb is a more consistent option, securing important KOs on the likes of Chinchou and Archen, which two hits from Bullet Seed cannot. Acrobatics provides a second powerful attack that adds great coverage on Grass-, Bug-, and Fighting-types while also making use of Unburden activating. Lastly, Drain Punch provides Treecko with some key recovery while also preventing Steel-types from walling this set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize Treecko's Attack, allowing it to hit 28 Attack with a Jolly nature, and 30 Attack with an Adamant nature, after a single Swords Dance. The rest of the EVs go into Treecko's bulk, allowing it to hit 22 HP, 12 Defense, and 12 Special Defense, important benchmarks to avoid being OHKOed by most neutral attacks. This bulk works well in tandem with Berry Juice, allowing Treecko to recover back to good health and simultaneously double its Speed thanks to Unburden. The choice between a Jolly and an Adamant nature comes down to whether outspeeding 18 Speed Choice Scarf Pokemon after Unburden or OHKOing the likes of Timburr and Foongus without Stealth Rock is more important to your team.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In order to preserve Berry Juice, Treecko should never switch directly into an attack, as the item typically needs to be consumed the turn Treecko uses Swords Dance. Treecko also fails to force out most attackers and is too weak unboosted, so it cannot wear down its counters either. Because of this, saving Treecko until the late-game is the best choice. Before Treecko sets up, try to have most priority users removed, especially Fletchling and Shellder. When you do set up Treecko, be sure to do it versus Pokemon that cannot OHKO or status it, such as Abra, Mienfoo, Drilbur, and Gothita. If Treecko is running an Adamant nature, make sure to scout for Choice Scarf on Gastly and on other 18 Speed Pokemon by checking damage rolls versus them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Treecko enjoys the support of wallbreakers such as Pawniard and Skrelp, as they pair nicely with Treecko due to their ability to substantially weaken the opposing team. Entry hazard users such as Omanyte, Tirtouga, Archen, Pawniard, Onix, and Dwebble further help wear down the opposing team and aid Treecko's sweep. Fletchling counters such as Archen, Magnemite, and Tirtouga help wear down Fletchling, giving Treecko a chance to sweep before being immediately revenge killed. Ponyta and Larvesta help to weaken Pawniard with burns, allowing Treecko to survive its Sucker Punches from a lower HP. Chinchou counters Larvesta and Ponyta, while Diglett removes both, enabling Treecko to avoid being burnt by Flame Body or risking not KOing them. Diglett also has access to Stealth Rock and Memento, giving Treecko far more setup opportunities. Gothita can trap and remove or cripple a large number of Treecko's checks, such as Spritzee, Ferroseed, and Porygon. Snivy and Treecko have excellent synergy that allows Snivy to wallbreak for Treecko and allows a failed Treecko sweep to turn into a Snivy sweep. Dragon Dance Barboach can be quite an interesting partner for Treecko due to its ability to remove most Poison-types and lure in a fair number of revenge killers that Treecko sets up on. On a more defensive note, Timburr and RestTalk Skrelp pair well with Treecko, as they wear down its counters and absorb status readily. Both Cottonee and Stunky pair interestingly with Treecko due to their access to Memento and their respective priority moves.</p>"

  "Torchic": {
    "overview": "<p>Torchic has usable bulk and solid offensive stats, allowing it to take a hit and retaliate back with its Fire-type STAB attacks when needed. The little chicken is held back, however, by its subpar defensive typing, which gives it weaknesses to the omnipresent Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type attacks in LC, in addition to a weakness to Stealth Rock. Furthermore, Torchic can be extremely predictable, often giving the opponent free turns.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower is a secondary STAB option that is more powerful than Flame Charge and more reliable than Fire Blast; however, it lacks Fire Blast's power and Flame Charge's utility. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers, but Torchic is hard-pressed to find a moveslot for it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Strong setup sweepers such as Shellder can capitalize on the free turns Torchic gives to counter sweep. They must beware of the Life Orb set or Will-O-Wisp, however.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Stealth Rock and Spikes both limit how many boosts Torchic can accumulate by lowering its HP, while Sticky Web lowers the Speed of Torchic, requiring Torchic to stay in extra turns to further boost its Speed.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Powerful Water-type STAB attacks from the likes of Chinchou and Skrelp greatly threaten Torchic. Corphish can cleanly OHKO Torchic before it can move with Aqua Jet, while Carvanha is naturally faster than Torchic and also has access to Speed Boost.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore users</strong>: Taunt and Encore both prohibit Torchic from setting up, often leaving it a sitting duck; however, most common Taunt and Encore users such as Cottonee are 2HKOed or OHKOed by the Life Orb set.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Roar and Whirlwind users such as Hippopotas can force Torchic out and remove all its boosts.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Protect allows Torchic to both scout the foe's moveset and ensure that it outspeeds the foe the next turn. Life Orb-boosted STAB Fire Blast coming off of 17 Special Attack hits extremely hard; for comparison, it slightly outdamages Adamant Choice Scarf Mienfoo's High Jump Kick, one of the most powerful attacks in the metagame. Hidden Power Grass hits Water- and Rock-types and provides the best possible coverage alongside Fire Blast. Rock Slide is another viable coverage option, OHKOing Berry Juice Archen and Larvesta after Stealth Rock as well as doing serious damage to Ponyta.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread alongside a Modest nature maximizes Torchic's Special Attack to make its main move, Fire Blast, as strong as possible. 236 Speed EVs allow Torchic to reach 14 Speed, which is enough to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame at +1. The remaining EVs are put into Torchic's defenses, allowing it to take weak priority attacks more easily. However, if running Rock Slide, an EV spread of 36 Atk / 36 Def / 200 SpA / 236 Spe with a Rash nature should be used to give Rock Slide enough power to net the KOs it's supposed to. 0 HP IVs give Torchic an HP stat of 19, reducing recoil from Life Orb to only 1 HP. Life Orb provides a noticeable power increase while still allowing Torchic to switch moves, unlike Choice items. Speed Boost makes Torchic increasingly difficult to revenge kill the longer it stays on the field and differentiates Torchic from more powerful Fire-type wallbreakers such as Houndour and Vulpix.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Life Orb Torchic is an extremely powerful wallbreaker, momentum grabber, and late-game cleaner. Fire Blast is by far its most powerful attack, 2HKOing or even OHKOing everything that doesn't resist it. This set works best if brought in via a safe switch or after a teammate has fainted against a foe that it forces out, such as Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate having bulky foes weakened, such as Choice Scarf Magnemite, work well with Life Orb Torchic. Entry hazard support allows Torchic to get significantly more OHKOs and 2HKOs, so Pokemon capable of setting entry hazards, such as Dwebble and Ferroseed, make for good teammates. Conversely, all types of entry hazards are detrimental to Torchic, so entry hazard removal, preferably in the form of Rapid Spin support from the likes of Drilbur and Staryu, is needed. Skrelp also makes for an excellent teammate, as it threatens nearly everything that beats Torchic with its Adaptability-boosted Water-type STAB moves.</p>"

Although XY gave Poochyena coverage against Fighting-types with Play Rough, and nerfed Steel-types so that Poochyena's Dark-type STAB moves have better coverage, Poochyena still remains on the list of Pokemon that are either used very situationally or just not good in general. This is because Poochyena's best stat is its lackluster base 55 Attack. Poochyena is also very frail, and faints to almost any STAB attack. It is also very susceptible to priority, namely Mach Punch. Poochyena also relies on Quick Feet to outspeed most Pokemon, forcing it to hold a Toxic Orb. You should always consider other options before you use Poochyena, because there are many.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Poochyena can use Thief over Crunch to steal items such as Berry Juice, but the power drop is very noticeable. A Life Orb set with Crunch, Sucker Punch, Fire Fang, and Ice Fang has a greater damage output than with Quick Feet. However, Poochyena is too slow to use it, and it will most likely be KOed before it does any major damage. Iron Tail can be used to hit Fairy-type Pokemon, but it is extremely inaccurate. Poison Fang can also be used to hit Fairy-types, but it is very weak. Super Fang can easily slice an opponent's health in half, making it a good option. Yawn can force switches, but Poochyena usually can't find a turn to use it. A RestTalk Heal Bell set can work, but Poochyena is too frail to run it to its best capability.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Timburr, Machop, and Croagunk all force Poochyena out either by outspeeding with a Choice Scarf, or by OHKOing with priority Fighting-type attacks. They must be wary of Play Rough, however.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Unless Poochyena is running a move such as Iron Tail to hit them, Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull can walk all over Poochyena.</p> <p><strong>Hard Hitters</strong>: Life Orb or Choice Band/Specs users can easily KO Poochyena, due to its very low defenses.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority moves such as Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave can easily 2HKO Poochyena before it can do major damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Bulky attackers such as Porygon can take a hit from Poochyena and retaliate with ease.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users and revenge killers in general can easily outspeed and heavily damage, if not OHKO, Poochyena.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Quick Feet": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Crunch is Poochyena's main STAB move, dealing the most damage to opposing Pokemon that resist any of Poochyena's other moves. Play Rough is used to provide coverage against Fighting-types and other Dark-types. Facade reaches 140 Base Power with Toxic Orb's poison, hitting neutral threats rather hard. Fire Fang is an option to hit Pawniard and most other Steel-types harder than Crunch, while Howl can boost Poochyena's Attack. Sucker Punch is an option to hit Choice Scarf users, but it is unreliable, and Poochyena already outspeeds most Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>236 Attack EVs max out Attack with a neutral nature, while 236 Speed EVs in combination with a Jolly nature allow Poochyena to hit 21 Speed with Quick Feet. 36 Special Defense EVs are filler and add a point to Special Defense. A Toxic Orb is held to poison Poochyena, which activates Quick Feet, boosting Poochyena's Speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Poochyena almost never finds a free turn for Quick Feet to activate or to use Howl, so it's best sent out against a Pokemon that it can check, allowing it to set up, and then finish it off. Poochyena is rather straightforward, however, so attacking is its only main concern.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hazard setters such as Ferroseed and Dwebble make for great partners, as Poochyena isn't very strong to begin with, so hazard support allows it to score more OHKOs and 2HKOs. Snubbull and Spritzee are good partners, as they can help cover up Poochyena's Fighting-type weakness. Scraggy and most other physical wallbreakers can weaken or get rid of physical walls such as Dwebble, Aron, and Ferroseed, which can all take a hit from Poochyena.</p>"

  "Zigzagoon": {
    "overview": "<p>Zigzagoon is one of the most unique sweepers in the Little Cup metagame, due to its access to the Belly Drum + Extremespeed combination, which makes it very powerful after it sets up and difficult to revenge kill because of Extreme Speed's +2 priority. However, Zigzagoon has a shallow movepool and a mediocre offensive typing; it's also very slow, though Extreme Speed mitigates this flaw. Zigzagoon also relies on setting up Belly Drum to perform its role and is kind of useless if it fails in doing so; it also needs a lot of team support compared to other sweepers so that it can perform its role perfectly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iron Tail can help against defensive Archen, while Gunk Shot can be used to OHKO Spritzee, which can survive an Extreme Speed. Zigzagoon also has access to Rock Smash, which can be used to hit Lileep, Aron, and Shieldon super effectively. Zigzagoon can also use a set with Salac Berry, Belly Drum, Gluttony, and maximum Attack and Speed EVs to deal with Pokemon such as Gastly, but it's hard to pull off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types are immune to Extreme Speed, but they should be wary of Thief. Life Orb Gastly is a great check to Zigzagoon, as it has a high chance of OHKOing Zigzagoon with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types resist Extreme Speed, making them solid checks. A great example is Pawniard, which can Knock Off Zigzagoon's Berry Juice and knock it below 50% health, making Zigzagoon's Belly Drum fail; it can also switch into Memento and Parting Shot users to get an Attack boost thanks to Defiant.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fighting-types</strong>: Bulky Fighting-types such as Timburr and bulky variants of Mienfoo have a chance of surviving Extreme Speed and can hit Zigzagoon back with a powerful super effective STAB Fighting-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Tirtouga, Omanyte, and Lileep resist Extreme Speed, though they should be wary of Seed Bomb and Rock Smash.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon with Taunt stop Zigzagoon from setting up Belly Drum and therefore prevent it from sweeping.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Belly Drum is used to maximize Zigzagoon's Attack, letting it OHKO most Pokemon with Extreme Speed, a strong STAB move that has +2 priority. Thief lets Zigzagoon hit Ghost-types, which are immune to Extreme Speed and would otherwise wall Zigzagoon, super effectively and also steal its target's item if Zigzagoon has consumed its Berry Juice. Seed Bomb lets Zigzagoon hit Omanyte and Tirtouga, which resist Extreme Speed, and Hippopotas, which can't be OHKOed by Extreme Speed but has a 50% chance to get OHKOed by Seed Bomb. Protect can also be used to shield Zigzagoon from Fake Out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature maximize Zigzagoon's Attack, and 32 Speed EVs let Zigzagoon outspeed Pumpkaboo. The rest of the EVs are thrown into HP and the defenses to allow Zigzagoon to set up reliably; the HP EVs let it hit an even number in HP, causing Berry Juice to activate when Zigzagoon is at 50% health. Pickup lets Zigzagoon get the last item consumed at the end of the turn if it's not holding an item.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Zigzagoon shouldn't switch in until all its potential checks are down, or else it won't be able to reliably sweep. Zigzagoon should also wait for the right opportunity to get in and set up so that it can perform its role as a late-game sweeper as perfectly as possible. It should also avoid switching in on moves that do more than 50% so that it doesn't prematurely consume Berry Juice, so either send Zigzagoon after one of your Pokemon has fainted or use a slow Volt Switch or U-turn user.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can use Memento are solid teammates, as Memento drops the foe's Attack and Special Attack, allowing Zigzagoon to set up reliably with Belly Drum without being afraid of getting OHKOed. Some examples are Diglett, which can use its high Speed to use Memento and can also trap Pokemon that check Zigzagoon such as Pawniard and Tirtouga; Cottonee also has access to priority Memento due to Prankster. Another great Memento user is Stunky, which can also Pursuit trap Ghost-types such as Gastly as well as break Abra's Focus Sash, which can be problematic for Zigzagoon if it's still intact. Gothita is also a nice teammate to have, as it can trap Pokemon that can revenge kill Zigzagoon, such as Archen, Tirtouga, and Ferroseed, and hurt them with Thunderbolt, Energy Ball, and Hidden Power Fire, respectively. It can also Trick its Choice Scarf onto bulky Pokemon. Pancham can be a great teammate due to its ability to use Parting Shot; it can also deal with Tirtouga, Pawniard, Ferroseed, and other Pokemon that check Zigzagoon. Pokemon that can deal with Ferroseed and Zigzagoon's other checks, such as Mienfoo, are also appreciated. Zigzagoon appreciates having entry hazard support, as it lets Zigzagoon sweep more reliably, so teammates that can set them up such as Dwebble are great to have. Knock Off users such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Pawniard can remove Eviolites and Berry Juices from the foes, allowing Zigzagoon to secure OHKOs on Pokemon such as Timburr and Spritzee.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Lotad has a unique typing with a nice STAB combination; however, it has low stats. It depends on rain to work well, as Swift Swim gives Lotad a small niche on rain teams by doubling its Speed. It has a nice movepool which includes powerful STAB moves. However, Lotad is weak to common types in Flying and Bug.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Although Lotad is able to utilize a SubSeed set, it is outclassed in that role by other Grass-types such as Cottonee.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Tanks and Walls:</strong> Pokemon with decent special bulk are obviously Lotad's main counters; for example, Croagunk can take any hit from Lotad thanks to its typing and ability.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority Abusers</strong>: Fletchling can revenge kill Lotad with ease thanks to its access to Gale Wings Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Weather Inducers</strong>: Weather setters such as Vulpix and Snover can easily revenge kill Lotad by removing the rain that Lotad relies on.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Faster Choice Scarf users can easily KO Lotad due to its frailty.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This is the only viable set that Lotad can run. Rain Dance doubles Lotad's Speed. Surf and Giga Drain are the main STAB moves. Energy Ball could be used over Giga Drain for its higher damage output, but Giga Drain's recovery is usually more useful than a chance to OHKO Chinchou after Stealth Rock. Ice Beam is for coverage, hitting Flying-types hard. Scald can be used over Surf for its utility, but Lotad's mediocre Special Attack usually makes it not worth it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature allows Lotad to hit 24 Speed under rain, while a Timid nature lets it hit 26 Speed, which allows it to outspeed Timid Choice Scarf Chinchou, Jolly Choice Scarf Drilbur, and Jolly Choice Scarf Mienfoo. With a Modest nature, Lotad Speed ties with Jolly Choice Scarf Bunnelby, Jolly Choice Scarf Cranidos, Modest Choice Scarf Chinchou, Adamant Choice Scarf Drilbur, and Adamant Choice Scarf Mienfoo. It is also important to note that reducing Lotad's HP IVs to 19 allows it to take less damage from Life Orb recoil; the EVs maximize Lotad's both Special Attack and Speed, while slightly boosting its defenses.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Lotad in after a foe has been KOed or through a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. Set up rain and sweep while predicting correctly. Preserving Lotad until late-game until its main counters, such as Ferroseed, Mantyke, and Munchlax, are KOed is advisable.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lotad is rain-dependent, so it's nice to have other Rain Dance users that can support it. Entry hazards are also beneficial, allowing Lotad to secure some important KOs. Ferroseed can be a good teammate for this reason, while Chinchou can be useful to deal with Mantyke and provide rain support, and Scraggy is a powerful teammate that can deal with Munchlax, supporting Lotad's sweep.</p>"

  "Taillow": {
    "overview": "<p>With two useful abilities in Guts and Scrappy and an excellent base 85 Speed stat that allows it to hit the coveted 19 Speed tier, Taillow is able to take advantage of its ridiculously high-powered STAB attacks such as Brave Bird and Boomburst to act as a potent offensive threat. U-turn allows Taillow to play around its checks, and the ability to viably run either a physical or special set means that Taillow isn't totally one-dimensional.</p> <p>However, despite its strengths, Taillow is actually quite easy to take down. Its bulk is absolutely atrocious; this is further compounded by its weakness to Stealth Rock. Moreover, despite the power of Taillow's STAB moves, its coverage moves are much less impressive, being limited in quantity and generally quite underwhelming. Although Taillow has its niche, its enormous flaws hold it back from being a top-tier threat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taillow's movepool is quite shallow, so there aren't many other viable options other than the ones already listed. The mixed set can also utilize Choice Specs or Choice Scarf, but the former does not obtain very many notable KOs over Life Orb, and the latter tends to lack the damage necessary to sweep effectively. A physical Choice Scarf set can be used with U-turn / Brave Bird / Return / Pursuit to outspeed the entire metagame, but its damage output is somewhat underwhelming. Roost can be used on either set to prolong Taillow's otherwise limited lifespan, but Taillow tends to be too frail to use it effectively. On the mixed set, Hidden Power Grass can be used to damage Omanyte and Sturdy-lacking Tirtouga. However, Hidden Power Fighting is generally the most useful Hidden Power variant. A Choice Band set can be used because it takes less recoil than the Guts set, but the inability to switch moves usually renders it the lesser option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Defensive Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: Defensive Rock- and Steel-types can reliably counter most variants of physical Taillow as well as special Taillow sets that lack Hidden Power Fighting and Heat Wave; Tirtouga, Eviolite Pawniard, and Archen are particularly notable examples.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Because Taillow is incredibly frail, common users of Choice Scarf can easily outspeed and KO it with a powerful STAB move, such as Pawniard's Knock Off. Taillow's frailty also leaves it vulnerable to powerful priority attacks; this is especially detrimental to the special set because it doesn't have priority of its own.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Boomburst is the attack that should be utilized the most; when paired with Scrappy and Life Orb, it becomes very difficult to switch into. Heat Wave heavily damages Steel-types, OHKOing Ferroseed and Magnemite after Stealth Rock damage. Hidden Power Fighting can be used instead to deal more damage to Rock-types and OHKO standard Pawniard, but it misses out on the aforementioned KOs. What Taillow can't break, it can U-turn out of, granting its team momentum in the process. Brave Bird is mostly a filler move, but with Life Orb, it is useful for OHKOing Fighting-types, something that Air Slash cannot do.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs and nature maximize Taillow's Special Attack and Speed and thus its sweeping potential, with the remaining EVs put in Defense so that Taillow can better take priority attacks. The reduced HP IVs allow Taillow to hit 19 HP, meaning Taillow only loses one HP per round of Life Orb recoil instead of two. Life Orb is the preferred item so that Taillow can hit hard while maintaining the ability to switch moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set performs best once opposing Rock- and Steel-types are adequately weakened or removed, allowing Taillow to freely fire off Boomburst. Otherwise, playing with this set is quite straightforward: use Boomburst as much as the situation allows.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards on the opposing side are as appreciated as they are for any offensive Pokemon, allowing Taillow to get a few OHKOs and 2HKOs that it otherwise could not; Tirtouga and Pawniard are examples of Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock while checking the Rock-types that trouble Taillow. Diglett is able to set up Stealth Rock and can trap and KO a variety of Rock- and Steel-types. On the other hand, Rapid Spin support is beneficial to deal with Taillow's Stealth Rock weakness, with Drilbur being a prime candidate for its ability to set up Stealth Rock as well. Taillow also makes an excellent member of a \"bird spam\" core by being paired with other Flying-types, such as Fletchling, Doduo, and Archen; one Flying-type weakens the opposing team's checks and counters to Flying-types, allowing the others to sweep.</p>"
      },
      "Guts Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set aims to take advantage of powerful Guts-boosted attacks. Facade becomes incredibly dangerous once Taillow is inflicted with status, 2HKOing almost everything that doesn't resist it. Brave Bird is an alternative STAB move; although the recoil can be detrimental, it hits Fighting- and Grass-types quite hard and deals more damage than Facade before Guts is activated. Quick Attack, although not especially powerful, is useful for picking off weakened threats and is Taillow's only priority attack. U-turn is useful for maintaining momentum and chipping away at Taillow's checks, while Protect allows Taillow to reliably activate Toxic Orb. However, Steel Wing can be viably used in the third or fourth moveslot if Archen is particularly troublesome.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs maximize Taillow's Attack and Speed and thus its sweeping potential, and the leftover EVs are dumped into HP so that Taillow can switch into Stealth Rock 4 times instead of 3 if Toxic Orb does not activate. Toxic Orb is preferred over Flame Orb because Taillow's lack of methods to directly break through checks and counters means that it will usually not be staying in for very long.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because most of Taillow's success depends on Guts, it is essential to activate Toxic Orb as early as possible. The best way of doing so is through a slow U-turn or Volt Switch user to get Taillow into play unharmed. This can also be done by switching Taillow into a Ghost- or Ground-type move or Will-O-Wisp, although this can be quite risky, as the opponent may choose a different attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Taillow is prone to switching a lot during the match, Rapid Spin or Defog support is essential; as such, Drilbur makes for an excellent partner because not only can it remove hazards from your side of the field, but it is also capable of setting Stealth Rock and heavily damaging troublesome Rock- and Steel-types with its STAB Earthquake. Arena Trap Diglett is another good teammate to get rid of certain Rock- and Steel-types. Because this set doesn't have Scrappy, a solid Pursuit user such as Stunky or Houndour is also a good partner to remove Ghost-types, which are immune to Facade. As with all of its sets, Taillow can be paired with another powerful Flying-type Pokemon such as Fletchling, Doduo, or Archen to help wear down their shared checks and counters.</p>"

Shroomish also boasts decent defenses and a useful defensive typing which allows it to wall common Pokemon such as Drilbur and Chinchou. Shroomish also gets access to some decent attacks such as Giga Drain and Drain Punch in addition to Synthesis, meaning it can recover off damage quite easily. Poison Heal allows Shroomish to recover even more health as well as act as a status absorber, albeit at the cost of the defensive boost given by Eviolite. However, Shroomish isn't spectacular at dishing out hits, as its offensive stats are unimpressive and it is also easily walled by Pokemon such as Foongus, Croagunk, Trubbish, and Ferroseed. Although its defensive typing can help it out against Ground- and Water-type opponents, Shroomish's glaring weaknesses to Pokemon such as Fletchling and Foongus means that they will have little trouble beating it with their super effective STAB moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shroomish can run Stun Spore in addition to Spore in order to paralyze an opponent as they switch out their sleeping Pokemon in an attempt to bring in a counter. However, Foongus outclasses it in this role. Berry Juice can provide recovery, but it is unnecessary, as Shroomish has multiple ways to recover HP and it does not enjoy losing the added bulk from Eviolite. Substitute is an option for the Poison Heal, Leech Seed, and Focus Punch sets. Swords Dance can make Shroomish very imposing; however, it is too slow and still walled by many opponents, even at +2 Attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Fletchling and Archen hit Shroomish very hard with their STAB moves and don't take much damage from any of Shroomish's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Gastly, Croagunk, and Trubbish resist Shroomish's STAB moves and can inflict a lot of damage to Shroomish with a super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Foongus and Cottonee can both reliably wall Shroomish's STAB moves and are immune to Spore. Foongus can then hit Shroomish with a super effective Sludge Bomb, while Cottonee can Encore Shroomish into a weak move. Snover heavily damages both variants of Shroomish with Blizzard; however, it must remain wary of Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Absorbers</strong>: Vullaby can easily wall Shroomish and KO it with Brave Bird. It resists Shroomish's STAB moves, which makes it difficult for Shroomish to wear Vullaby down. Pokemon with the ability Vital Spirit or Early Bird, such as Magby or Houndour, can also threaten Shroomish.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spore is a staple on Shroomish, as it enables it to put an opposing threat to sleep. Bullet Seed is a powerful STAB move which hits opponents such as Drilbur, Onix, Tirtouga, and Chinchou. Giga Drain is also a reliable STAB move which provides a small amount of recovery. Drain Punch enables Shroomish to hit opponents such as Pawniard super effectively while providing Shroomish with a small amount of recovery. It also nails Ferroseed and Lileep, which might try to switch in on a predicted Spore. Synthesis allows Shroomish to recover off damage, particularly against a sleeping opponent.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Shroomish prefers to hold Eviolite, as it improves its bulk. The chosen EV spread gives Shroomish the highest Attack possible with enough EVs in Defenses to reach Eviolite numbers. The remaining EVs are put into HP and Special Attack for the sets that run Giga Drain. An Adamant nature gives the highest Attack possible, but a Brave nature can be used if Shroomish runs Giga Drain as it won't be greatly affected by the loss of a point in Speed. Effect Spore is a decent ability to mess up contact move users, but it can interfere with Spore and is unreliable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Shroomish should use Spore whenever it gets the opportunity. Crippling an opponent can be very advantageous, as you can switch out in an attempt to gain a favorable match up, or hit the incoming switch with an attack, or simply heal up with Synthesis if Shroomish has taken damage. Drain Punch can be used to hit opponents such as Pawniard and Houndour, which resist Shroomish's STAB moves. Shroomish is crippled by status, however, so it should not stay in on opponents such as Ferroseed or Porygon which can cripple Shroomish with a Thunder Wave.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-types such as Pawniard and Magnemite are great teammates for Shroomish, as they are immune to Poison-type attacks, and resist the Bug-, Flying-, and Ice-type attacks that Shroomish is weak to. They also wall Fletchling, which is a huge threat to Shroomish, although they cannot wall mixed Fletchling that carry Overheat. A teammate to absorb Will-O-Wisp and defeat the Grass-types that wall Shroomish, particularly Foongus and Cottonee, is helpful; Houndour or Ponyta both can do this. Abra or Drilbur beat the Poison-types that wall Shroomish; they can also both shred through opponents after Shroomish has weakened them extensively.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spore is a staple on Shroomish, as it enables it to put an opposing threat to sleep. Protect assures Toxic Orb's activation and also allows it to stall for an extra turn of recovery. However, without Hidden Power Fire, Shroomish is completely walled by other Grass-types and Steel-types. Leech Seed provides residual damage and recovery for Shroomish. Giga Drain is the STAB move of choice, as it hits Chinchou and Drilbur for super effective damage, and provides recovery. Toxic enables Shroomish to beat Lileep, Porygon and Vullaby, Pokemon that would wall it easily otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Although Shroomish misses the bulk provided by Eviolite, Toxic Orb combined with Poison Heal gives it reliable recovery every turn and makes it immune to other status effects. Running Max HP EVs means Shroomish will recover 3 HP per turn while poisoned, while the rest of the EVs are placed in Defense and Special Defense with a Bold nature in order to make Shroomish as bulky as possible without Eviolite.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>After Toxic Orb's activation, Shroomish can act as both a status and Knock Off absorber, as it does not need its Toxic Orb after it is activated. Although it is still frail without Eviolite, the gradual recovery means that it can take hits reasonably well. Putting an opponent to sleep with Spore will allow Shroomish to recover plenty of health as Poison Heal and Giga Drain work well together in aiding recovery.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-types such as Pawniard and Magnemite are great teammates for Shroomish, as they are immune to Poison-type attacks and also resist the Bug-, Flying-, and Ice-type attacks that Shroomish is weak to.

Its Fairy typing provides a resistance to Sucker Punch and Knock Off, two very common moves. Its typing isn't very useful outside of that, however, as it has no Fairy-type STAB move to complement it. It also has a fairly shallow movepool and faces competition from Bunnelby as a Huge Power user, as Bunnelby hits 28 Attack as opposed to Azurill's 24 Attack, and it is much faster. It also requires a lot of support, including teammates that run Trick Room.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Azurill has very few other options due to its barren movepool. Substitute can be used to block status, but the coverage will be missed. Eviolite can be used for extra bulk at the cost of some damage output. Bounce can be used to hit annoying Grass-types. Work Up, as a boosting move, can be used, but Azurill is too frail to utilize it most of the time, and it would rather have the coverage options. Azurill can be used outside of a Trick Room team with a healthy amount of Baton Pass or Thunder Wave support. Finally, it can use maximum Speed investment to outspeed most walls outside of Trick Room, for an easier time taking them down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Most Steel-types, such as Eviolite Pawniard, Honedge, Aron, and Ferroseed can all beat Azurill thanks to their type advantage. Honedge should watch out for Knock Off, however, and Aron should watch out for Waterfall.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Eviolite Tirtouga, Omanyte, and Kabuto can all take on Azurill with relative ease due to their high Defense and good typing to take Azurill's coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Spritzee, Slowpoke, and Koffing can all take hits well, and dispose of Azurill. Spritzee must be wary of Iron Tail, however.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burns, paralysis, and poison can all deter Azurill, as burns halve its Attack, paralysis can cause it to not move for a turn, and poison whittles its health down.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is your go-to reliable STAB move that hits anything that doesn't resist it very hard. Knock Off is a great coverage move that allows Azurill to hit Ghost-types, while Waterfall rounds off the coverage by hitting Rock-, Ground-, and Fire-types super effectively. Iron Tail allows Azurill to beat a few things that otherwise wall it such as Lileep and Spritzee. Lastly, Double-Edge is another heavy hitting STAB attack, but the recoil is not appreciated.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Brave nature is used because you're going to be using this in Trick Room, so the loss of Speed is actually beneficial, while its Attack is maximized in order to hit as hard as possible. The Defense EVs add substantial bulk, allowing it to take less damage from opposing priority such as Quick Attack. Finally, a Life Orb is the item of choice, as it allows Azurill to hit even harder.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Azurill is best brought in after a teammate has been knocked out as an early-game wallbreaker. Don't switch Azurill into an attack, as it will most likely be weakened to the point where it's useless, if it doesn't outright get KOed. Try to avoid Pawniard as much as possible, and if you can't KO a wall, Knock Off is helpful to for crippling it. Azurill's goal is to weaken the opposing team to the point that whatever cleaner you have can finish the job with relative ease.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Trick Room setters such as Porygon, Spritzee, and Pumpkaboo are mandatory. Late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Bunnelby work well and appreciate Azurill for softening up the opponent's team. Hazard setters can help to break Sturdy, something that Azurill is very much grateful for, as with just one layer of Spikes and some prior damage, it can OHKO Magnemite and Dwebble. Azurill requires a lot of support to use effectively, but late-game sweepers and cleaners appreciate its help of busting through even the bulkiest of Little Cup walls with ease.</p>"

  "Nosepass": {
    "overview": "<p>Nosepass is the weirdest of the famed SturdyJuice entry hazard setters of LC, being modeled after both a compass and a nose. Matching that strange design, Nosepass has access to a wide variety of moves, such as Volt Switch, that other setters lack. Nosepass boasts a base 135 Defense stat, the second highest in the metagame. However, Nosepass is arguably outclassed by the Pokemon with the highest Defense, Onix. Despite its incredible movepool, Nosepass has very weak offensive capabilities, and lacks the capacity to deal any significant damage against most of the tier. As such, Nosepass is limited to the role of a capable Stealth Rock setter with the ability to cripple its foes with Thunder Wave and pivot out with Volt Switch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>One of Nosepass's defining characteristics is its incredible movepool. It has Earthquake, Rock Slide, and several other good physically attacking moves, like the elemental punches. Of these punches, Fire Punch is the best, as it helps get past Ferroseed. One of the better alternative sets Nosepass can run is a Pain Split Eviolite set. With Nosepass's high defenses and low HP, Pain Split can truly be a problem for many opposing Pokemon. Nosepass can also run many odd moves that don't go well in a viable set but are still interesting, like Toxic, Stone Edge, Magic Coat, Magnet Rise, and Explosion, as well as Rock Polish and other boosting moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fast Taunt Users</strong>: Mienfoo can get off a fast Taunt, stopping Nosepass completely and forcing a switch. However, Nosepass can predict this and go directly for a Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Defog and Rapid Spin Users</strong>: Pokemon that can remove Stealth Rock can negate Nosepass's hazard-setting efforts.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: As most Fighting-type Pokemon carry Knock Off, they can break Sturdy and remove Berry Juice in one turn, then Drain Punch or High Jump Kick for the KO the next.</p> <p><strong>Water-types and Grass-types</strong>: These Pokemon take neutral damage from Stealth Rock and almost all of the moves that Nosepass has access to. Slowpoke, in particular, walls Nosepass, taking very little damage even from Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker</strong>: Mold Breaker users such as Axew and Drilbur couldn't care less about Sturdy. A Superpower or Earthquake from these Pokemon can tear Nosepass apart before it can even move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock hampers enemy teams by breaking Sturdy and discouraging constant switches. Thunder Wave should be used if the opponent tries to set up while Nosepass is setting up Stealth Rock. Use Volt Switch for a slow switch out, which can help get Nosepass out so that it can assist later in the game, and can help get other Pokemon in safely. Rock Blast is a multi-hit STAB move that hits Flying-types pretty hard. This is extremely useful for switching into Fletchling and then punishing it if the opponent decides to keep it in, for breaking Sturdy on other entry hazard setters, and breaking Focus Sash on Pokemon such as Surskit. Dazzling Gleam can be used to damage Fighting-type switch-ins, specifically Scraggy, who takes 4x super effective damage from the move. Against most other Fighting-types, Thunder Wave and Volt Switch is a better combination, as it allows Nosepass to cripple them and get a slow switch out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Nosepass's preferred nature and EV spread depend on its chosen moves. Defense and Special Defense should be maximized in order to increase survivability. The remaining EVs should be put into Attack if using Rock Blast or into Special Attack if using Power Gem. A Bold nature boosts Defense at the expense of Attack, so it should be run if Nosepass is using Power Gem. Alternately, a Relaxed nature increases Defense at the expense of Speed, which increases the likelihood of moving last with Volt Switch. This works best with an EV spread of 76 Atk / 236 Def / 196 SpD. Sturdy and Berry Juice work in conjunction to ensure Nosepass has at least a turn to set up. With this combination, Nosepass can usually make several moves before going down or switching out.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Get in, use Stealth Rock and maybe Thunder Wave, and serve as a suicide switch. Nosepass can tank physical hits pretty well because of its massive Defense stat and is an effective check to many common threats. Sometimes, it's more important to make a offensive move than set up Stealth Rock. Pay attention to the enemy's team and be careful with the decision that you make. While Thunder Wave can really obstruct Fighting-types like Mienfoo, it can be unwise to use if the enemy has a Timburr or Scraggy, due to Guts and Shed Skin, respectively. Use Volt Switch for a slow switch out, giving you the switch advantage on the following turn. However, Volt Switch deals almost no damage, so don't depend on it too much. Its sole purpose is to get Nosepass out and another Pokemon in safely. If there is an opposing Fletchling, keep Nosepass around to deal with it, as it can counter any set except the rare Hidden Power Grass variant.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cottonee, as a switch-in for Timburr, is extremely useful. Switch into a Drain Punch, use Encore on the Drain Punch, then fight back with STAB Fairy-type moves. Pokemon that sweep better after assistance from entry hazards, such as Taillow and Fletchling, are also good teammates for Nosepass. Ghost-type Pokemon can stop Rapid Spin users from removing Stealth Rock. Pawniard and other Pokemon with the Defiant ability discourage the enemy team from using Defog. Pokemon that appreciate a slow Volt Switch in, such as Fletchling, work well with Nosepass. Pokemon that can switch into Water-type attacks, such as Foongus or Dry Skin Croagunk, also are good partners. Foongus has great synergy with Nosepass, as they handle each other's threats.</p>"

  "Aron": {
    "overview": "<p>Aron is a unique Pokemon with a high Defense stat and nine resistances that enable it to wall Fairy- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Spritzee and Fletchling. Aron has access to the most powerful Rock-type move, Head Smash, and the ability Rock Head, which negates Head Smash's recoil. Aron also has access to Metal Burst, which can be used alongside Sturdy and its low Speed stat to severely dent foes caught off guard. However, Aron has two unfortunate 4x weaknesses to Ground and Fighting, which allow Pokemon of these types, such as Drilbur and Mienfoo respectively, to easily take advantage of it. Aron also has a 2x weakness to Water-type moves; these weaknesses, alongside Aron's low Special Defense, make it tough for Aron to fit into a metagame where these types are common. Aron's capability as a wall is also hampered by the fact that it has no recovery outside of the unreliable RestTalk, which it cannot afford to run. The only hope it has at recovery is Berry Juice, which can only be used once.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A dedicated Rock Polish set has potential as a sweeper; however, it is outclassed by Tirtouga, which has a better typing and access to Shell Smash. Autotomize is an inferior Rock Polish because it weakens Heavy Slam, making Rock Polish the better move in almost all occasions. Double-Edge could be used alongside Rock Head, but Aron's STAB moves deal more damage to neutral targets in most cases anyway. Earthquake allows Aron to 2HKO Honedge; however, Honedge is able to OHKO Aron with Sacred Sword, and Pawniard is often the larger threat to aim for. A super effective Shadow Claw, which might seem useful in order to damage to certain threats, still deals less damage than a neutral Head Smash, making it an unwise move to run. A set utilizing Curse may seem good on paper, but in practice it is usually let down thanks to Aron's low Special Defense stat. Magnet Rise could surprise Ground-types, but it doesn't really do much otherwise because most Ground-types carry Fighting-type moves as well. Using RestTalk as a means of recovery is a possibility, though it's shaky at best and RestTalk Aron has a case of four-moveslot syndrome. It should be noted that a level 1 Endeavor set should never be used because it is nowhere near as effective in LC as it is in higher tiers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mold Breaker</strong>: Drilbur and Pancham can bypass Sturdy thanks to Mold Breaker and OHKO Aron with their respective STAB moves. Both of these Pokemon also resist Head Smash, although they must watch out for Heavy Slam. Other Mold Breaker Pokemon include Axew and Cranidos; however, these Pokemon are not able to stomach a Head Smash and thus have to worry about switching into Aron.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Once Sturdy is broken, Aron is almost always OHKOed by Fighting-type attacks; however, these Fighting-type Pokemon risk being hit by Metal Burst should Sturdy not be broken. However, once it is broken, Fighting-types, such as Mienfoo, Croagunk, and Timburr, are all able to survive Aron's STAB moves and KO it with their own STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Dedicated Physical Walls</strong>: Slowpoke stands out as a prime physical wall that beats Aron because it avoids the 2HKO from Head Smash, KOes Aron in return with Scald, and can even paralyze Aron with Thunder Wave. Phanpy is able to avoid the 2HKO from all of Aron's moves and beats it with Earthquake and Ice Shard. Lickitung is not 2HKOed by Head Smash and can PP stall with Wish and Protect to slowly wear down Aron.</p> <p><strong>Breaking of Sturdy</strong>: Several methods can be used to break Aron's Sturdy, such as the use of entry hazards, which break Sturdy upon Aron switching in. Another way is with a burn from Will-O-Wisp, which also halves Aron's Attack stat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sturdy Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Slide is Aron's most reliable STAB move, as it does not cause recoil, keeping Sturdy intact; alternatively, Head Smash can also be used for its raw power. It is important to note that Head Smash wears Aron down extremely fast and breaks Sturdy. Heavy Slam is Aron's secondary STAB move, has 100% accuracy, and is able to hit the majority of the tier for a lot of damage. Iron Head is another option that is more consistent in its damage output and has a nifty chance of flinching the foe. However, it should be noted that Heavy Slam hits Bunnelby, Cottonee, Drilbur, Foongus, Scraggy, Snubbull, Spritzee, Timburr, and Vullaby, among others, for more damage than Iron Head. Superpower provides useful coverage against Steel-types such as Pawniard which resist both of Aron's STAB moves. Metal Burst works well in tandem with Aron's low Speed stat and Sturdy, which allows it to survive one hit from full health and potentially deal a lot of damage in return. Alternatively, Stealth Rock is another option for the last slot that can be used to wear down switch-ins and provide team support.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed EVs maximize Aron's damage output while retaining its good physical bulk. No HP EVs are used so that Aron is able to recover all of its health from Berry Juice at 1 HP. 0 Speed IVs and a Brave nature ensure that Aron is as slow as possible so that it will be able to use Metal Burst after the foe attacks, as the move will fail if Aron moves first.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aron is usually able to take at least two hits thanks to Sturdy and Berry Juice, which brings Aron back to full health in order to withstand another attack. Because Berry Juice is Aron's only form of recovery, you should be wary of Knock Off users. Pokemon with the Mold Breaker ability, such as Drilbur, are able to ignore Sturdy, making it unwise for Aron to stay in on these Pokemon. Metal Burst should be used when predicting a strong blow because if Aron is brought down to 1 HP, it will most likely KO the attacker in return. Head Smash should be used sparingly should Sturdy not be broken, as using Head Smash will instantly break it. Aron's typing should be taken advantage of; switch it into Fairy- and Flying-types such as Spritzee and Fletchling.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A Pokemon that carries Rapid Spin or Defog can remove entry hazards and allows Aron's Sturdy to remain intact upon switching in, as breaking it renders Aron unable to use Metal Burst effectively. Pokemon such as Trubbish that can beat common Knock Off users such as Mienfoo and Timburr are helpful, as they ensure that Aron will keep its Berry Juice. Pokemon such as Chinchou that can beat Aron's two prime counters, Drilbur and Slowpoke, also make for good partners.</p>"
      },
      "Rock Head": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Head Smash is an extremely powerful STAB move that can 2HKO even some Pokemon that resist it. It works well alongside Rock Head, which negates its recoil. Heavy Slam is useful because it hits the majority of the metagame hard, while Iron Head could be used for more reliable damage. Superpower is used to beat Steel-types, such as Pawniard and Magnemite, which resist Aron's STAB moves. Stealth Rock is a very useful move in general because it wears down switch-ins and supports Aron and its teammates. Alternatively, Rock Polish could be used to boost Aron's Speed and set it up for a potential sweep, though it is important to note that practically all Choice Scarf users will still outspeed Aron even after a boost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed Attack EVs and an Adamant nature maximize Aron's offensive potential, and the defensive investment allows Aron to hit Eviolite numbers. By running 36 Speed EVs, Aron is able to outpace Spritzee and smack it with Heavy Slam. Eviolite can be used alongside Wish support, as it greatly increases Aron's longevity and bulk. Berry Juice forms a wonderful combination with Sturdy because when Aron is at 1 HP, Berry Juice will bring it back to full health. However, using a Life Orb is justifiable when running Rock Polish for a boost in power to all of Aron's moves at the expense of a bit of health loss.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aron makes for a great counter and switch-in to Fletchling thanks to its 4x resistance to Fletchling's Flying-type moves. Head Smash is capable of denting even Pokemon that resist Rock-type moves, so simply using it on predicted switches is a good idea; however, one must remember that it only has 8 PP and should not be wasted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that often force switches pair well with Aron due to its ability to provide Stealth Rock support. Pokemon that can handle Aron's weakness to Fighting-types, such as Spritzee and Slowpoke, make for good partners. Spritzee can also pass Wishes or use Aromatherapy to keep Aron healthy throughout the match; this is especially useful when Aron chooses to run an Eviolite. Meanwhile, Slowpoke has the ability to beat Drilbur, another problem for Aron. Foongus makes for a good partner because it can soak up Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Chinchou and Staryu.</p>"
      },
      "Sticky Web Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thanks to Heavy Metal, Aron's weight is doubled, making Heavy Slam's power even stronger. Hone Claws bolsters Aron's Attack stat to reasonable levels and can be used against Pokemon that Aron walls, such as Fletchling. Earthquake hits Electric- and Steel-types, which resist Heavy Slam. Magnet Rise is extremely useful because it allows Aron to set up on Ground-type Pokemon without fear. Should having a secondary STAB move be of use, Rock Slide or Head Smash may be used; both are good options, though missing a Head Smash could cost Aron a sweep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Heavy Metal doubles Aron's weight, which allows Heavy Slam to hit like a truck against the light LC metagame. To put this into perspective, the only Pokemon that weighs more than this is Wailmer, and the closest Pokemon below 120 kilograms is Munchlax, at 105 kilograms; the rest of the tier is far below this. Sticky Web support makes up for Aron's low Speed, so more investment is not necessary; Aron outspeeds anything with 17 Speed or below after Sticky Web. Running 36 HP EVs is quite specific but allows Aron to only take 1 HP Life Orb recoil. Life Orb boosts Aron's damage output while allowing it to change moves; without Life Orb, Aron loses the ability to OHKO Mienfoo with Heavy Slam at +1 Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Fletchling is a prime foe to set up Hone Claws on thanks to Aron's 4x resistance to Flying-type moves. Another Pokemon that Aron can set up on is Spritzee, which fails to do anything to Aron and is OHKOed by Heavy Slam. Similarly, Heavy Slam should be used on practically everything thanks to its high Base Power, which allows it to dent anything that does not resist it. Using coverage moves where appropriate is what Aron should do otherwise, but mainly spamming Heavy Slam is usually a good option.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A Sticky Web setter, such as Surskit or Spinarak, is a necessity and is what this set revolves around. Another Pokemon that can set up entry hazards, such as Drilbur, is a useful partner because entry hazards can turn some 2HKOs into OHKOs. Preventing entry hazard removal is equally as important; Pawniard can deter Defog, while Ghost-types such as Gastly are able to block Rapid Spin. Pawniard in particular stands out for its ability to get rid of Gastly, which is unaffected by Sticky Web and threatens Aron with Shadow Ball or Destiny Bond.</p>"

  "Electrike": {
    "overview": "<p>Electrike is primarily used as a Choice Scarf or a Choice Specs user in Little Cup, as it has access to Switcheroo, allowing Electrike to cripple walls that may try switching into it by replacing their Eviolite with a Choice item. Unlike other Electric-types in Little Cup, Electrike has access to Flamethrower, letting it heavily threaten the Grass-types that resist Electric-type moves, such as Ferroseed, Foongus, and Cottonee. Lightning Rod is also quite useful, as it allows Electrike to switch in and block other Volt Switch users, hampering their momentum and giving Electrike a handy Special Attack boost. Despite these useful traits, Electrike is quite lackluster in comparison to other Electric-types. Elekid, Chinchou, and Magnemite all have generally better base stats than Electrike, as well as other advantages in terms of their movepool, ability, or typing, giving Electrike serious competition for a teamslot. Because of this, Electrike should always make use of its unique access to Switcheroo, Flamethrower, and Lightning Rod, as this differentiates it from other Electric-types and gives it a usable niche in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Electrike can run a Life Orb set, but this is done better by Elekid due to its higher Speed. Snarl is an option on the Choice Scarf set; as a sound-based move, it hits through Substitute, allowing Electrike to revenge kill dangerous foes such as Substitute + Life Orb Gastly. Snarl also has the added utility of lowering the foe's Special Attack, which can be handy late-game to provide a potential setup opportunity for a teammate.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Numel, Diglett, Drilbur, and Hippopotas are immune to Electrike's STAB moves and can easily OHKO Electrike with their own STAB moves. Numel, in particular, resists Flamethrower and is only hit neutrally by Hidden Power Grass, making it a particularly effective answer to Electrike. Diglett is also notable, as it can trap Electrike with Arena Trap, allowing it to remove Electrike from the game if it gets a safe opportunity to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Chinchou</strong>: Although Electrike can handle most other Electric-types quite well thanks to its coverage and Lightning Rod, Chinchou poses a large threat to Electrike due to its typing and Volt Absorb, giving it an immunity to Electrike's STAB moves as well as a resistance to Flamethrower. Chinchou can heavily damage Electrike with a Water-type STAB move or Hidden Power Ground, while the best Electrike can do back is Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p><strong>Trace Porygon</strong>: Porygon has the bulk to take any of Electrike's attacks and recover off the damage, and it blocks Volt Switch thanks to Trace. It will also gain a Special Attack boost if it switches in on one of Electrike's Electric-type moves, making it a significant threat to Electrike and its team. Porygon doesn't particularly enjoy switching into Switcheroo, however.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Generally, anything that can survive a hit from Electrike and retaliate back serves as a good check due to Electrike's less than stellar bulk.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is Electrike's primary STAB move, as it's great for scouting the opponent's team early-game and maintains offensive momentum for your team. Flamethrower provides helpful coverage against Grass-types, such as Ferroseed, Foongus, and Cottonee. Flamethrower also OHKOes Magnemite after Stealth Rock damage. Hidden Power Grass hits opposing Ground-types and Chinchou super effectively, which is important, as they are immune to Electrike's STAB moves. Alternatively, Thunderbolt can be used over Hidden Power Grass as a stronger STAB option, giving Electrike a better tool for cleaning up late-game. Switcheroo sets Electrike apart from other Electric-type Choice item users, allowing Electrike to cripple opposing walls by replacing their item with a Choice item.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Lightning Rod gives Electrike a useful immunity to Electric-type moves, as well as a boost to its Special Attack if it's hit by one, allowing it to take advantage of opposing Volt Switch users. Maximum investment in Special Attack and a Modest nature let Electrike hit as hard as possible, making it a good revenge killer with Choice Scarf. The given Speed investment lets Electrike hit 24 Speed with Choice Scarf, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, as well as foes such as Choice Scarf Magnemite, Choice Scarf Snover, and +2 Adamant Tirtouga. A Timid nature can be used to hit 25 Speed with Choice Scarf, which outpaces +2 Jolly Tirtouga, Jolly Choice Scarf Larvesta, and Jolly Choice Scarf Pawniard. Choice Specs, on the other hand, lets Electrike's moves hit much harder, especially if Electrike manages to grab a Special Attack boost from Lightning Rod. For example, a +1 Choice Specs Hidden Power Grass can OHKO Berry Juice Chinchou without any prior damage. A Timid nature is preferred with Choice Specs to maximize Electrike's Speed. If Electrike isn't running Hidden Power Grass, a spread of 36 HP / 236 SpA / 236 Spe should be used instead.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Electrike typically functions as a revenge killer and a momentum grabber with its access to Volt Switch and good coverage options. With Lightning Rod, Electrike can be switched into predicted Electric-type moves and obtain a Special Attack boost, increasing Electrike's damage output and pressuring the opponent's team. Be cautious, however, as Electrike doesn't have the greatest bulk, so switching into a stray coverage move instead of an Electric-type attack can leave it heavily damaged or KOed. Switcheroo should be used on predicted switches to Pokemon that Electrike has trouble doing much damage to, such as Munchlax, as they won't enjoy being crippled by a Choice item. Switcheroo is also a good catch-all method of crippling Electrike's switch-ins, which is useful if your opponent still has multiple potential switch-ins to Electrike and you're having trouble deciding whether to use Volt Switch, Flamethrower, or Hidden Power Grass.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Electrike works well on VoltTurn teams and pairs well with U-turn users such as Mienfoo, Fletchling, and Larvesta to keep offensive pressure on the opponent. Although Electrike can run Hidden Power Grass, it prefers having Ground-types dealt with by teammates so that it can use Volt Switch more freely. Water-types such as Staryu and Corphish can break through Ground-types easily with their STAB moves and can provide Rapid Spin and Knock Off support, respectively. Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Foongus can take on Ground-types and Chinchou for Electrike, while Electrike can defeat the Flying-types that threaten them in return. Fighting-types such as Pancham and Timburr can take on bulky Normal-types, particularly Porygon, which is important, as Electrike won't be able to break through these Pokemon on its own. Staryu, Drilbur, Archen, and Vullaby can all support Electrike by removing entry hazards, which is helpful, as Electrike doesn't appreciate being worn down by passive damage each time it comes in. Diglett is a helpful partner, as it traps and removes Chinchou from the game, letting Electrike use its STAB moves much more freely.</p>"

It can also make good use of its great base 130 HP with a bulkier Eviolite set. Wailmer's typing is a boon both offensively and defensively, as it grants Wailmer only two weaknesses and lets Wailmer hit top-tier threats such as Drilbur and Archen super effectively with Water-type STAB moves.</p> <p>However, Wailmer's extremely poor defenses, inability to counter faster Pokemon, and lackluster movepool leave something to be desired. Water Spout also fails to OHKO some Eviolite users, leaving Wailmer vulnerable to taking hits and having Water Spout's Base Power lowered. Wailmer also faces competition from other Pokemon in both of its roles. Remoraid is faster, also has access to Water Spout, and has more coverage options. Munchlax is a stronger tank with better defenses and a larger movepool; it can wall many of the same Pokemon as Wailmer by virtue of Thick Fat. Wailmer functions as a middle ground between both Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Clear Smog can be used, but Roar usually offers more utility because it goes past Substitute and forces the opponent to take entry hazard damage as well. However, Clear Smog is somewhat useful if you use Pressure, as Taunt blocks Roar. Icy Wind is an option, but neither set really appreciates its benefits. Wailmer's movepool contains many physical options, including Waterfall and Earthquake, and it has a decent Attack stat to use them with, but it is heavily outclassed as a physical Water-type sweeper by Carvanha, Corphish, and offensive Tirtouga. Wailmer also has a boosting option in Curse, but it cannot use Curse well because it needs RestTalk to prevent itself from being worn down. However, Wailmer will then only have one moveslot left for an attack, so it will be walled by many Pokemon. Wailmer can also use Choice Specs for a power boost, but it would rather have the increased Speed from Choice Scarf and is too frail without defensive investment to use Choice Specs properly. A suicide lead set using Rain Dance and Self-Destruct is possible but not feasible, as there are better, more durable Rain Dance leads, such as Mantyke, and Self-Destruct will usually fail to KO the opponent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Water</strong>: If not all Pokemon that resist Water Spout are off the field when Wailmer attempts to sweep with it, the opponent can switch in one of these Pokemon and end Wailmer's sweep. Additionally, because RestTalk Wailmer only has one move, Pokemon that resist Water-type moves can completely wall it and proceed to deal damage if Wailmer can't Roar them out. Moreover, many Pokemon that resist Water-type moves also have STAB moves that are super effective against Wailmer.</p> <p><strong>Chinchou</strong>: Chinchou is a reliable way to beat Wailmer because it resists not only Wailmer's STAB moves but also Ice Beam, meaning Wailmer must resort to the weak Hidden Power Grass. Meanwhile, Chinchou can hit Wailmer hard with STAB Electric-type attacks. Additionally, Choice Scarf Chinchou outspeeds Choice Scarf Wailmer.</p> <p><strong>Dedicated Special Walls</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Lickitung and Munchlax are able to avoid the 2HKO from Water Spout and hard wall Choice Scarf Wailmer.</p> <p><strong>Croagunk</strong>: Croagunk is immune to Wailmer's STAB attacks and uses them to replenish its health with its ability Dry Skin. It can gradually wear Wailmer down while keeping itself healthy.</p> <p><strong>Eviolite Users</strong>: Pokemon holding Eviolite, even those that don't resist Water-type moves, are annoying for Choice Scarf Wailmer to face, as they can usually take a Water Spout from full health and hit back to weaken Water Spout's power.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority users such as Fletchling and Pawniard can quickly put an end to a Water Spout sweep by dealing damage to Wailmer before it can attack, lowering Water Spout's Base Power.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Choice Scarf Wailmer is helpless when statused. Paralysis effectively removes Wailmer's Choice Scarf and leaves it open to being revenge killed, sleep leaves it unable to act as the opponent hammers away at it, and poison whittles away at Water Spout's Base Power every turn. However, RestTalk Wailmer is fine with status, as long as it has an opportunity to use Rest and heal.</p> <p><strong>Weather</strong>: Save for rain, all forms of weather are detrimental to Wailmer. Hail slowly chips away at Wailmer's HP, while sand does the same and increases Rock-types' Special Defense, making them harder to break through. Sun halves the power of Wailmer's STAB moves and leaves it open to being revenge killed by Chlorophyll sweepers.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Wailmer is vulnerable to all entry hazards. Spikes and Stealth Rock weaken Water Spout while reducing Wailmer's overall durability. Toxic Spikes put a timer on Water Spout's usefulness, though RestTalk Wailmer doesn't care as much about status.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Water Spout is Wailmer's main draw and hits 150 Base Power when Wailmer is at full health. Hydro Pump, Scald, and Surf are more reliable STAB moves with consistent Base Power, though none are as powerful as a fully powered Water Spout. Hydro Pump is extremely powerful but has low accuracy, Scald has a chance to burn but is much less powerful, and Surf has good Base Power as well as perfect accuracy. Ice Beam is super effective against the Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Wailmer's Water-type STAB moves. Finally, Hidden Power Grass makes sure that Wailmer is not walled by the Water-types which resist its other three moves. Hidden Power Fire can also be used to lure in and beat Ferroseed, but Wailmer will miss out on hitting Water-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Speed and Special Attack allows Wailmer to hit as fast and hard as possible. The remaining EVs are put into HP to increase all-around bulk and into Defense to lower the damage done by most priority moves, which bypass Choice Scarf's Speed boost. A Timid nature is preferred so that Wailmer is able to outspeed other boosted Pokemon, such as Jolly Scraggy after one Dragon Dance and Adamant Choice Scarf Cranidos, and Speed tie with boosted Pokemon such as Jolly Tirtouga after Shell Smash and Jolly Choice Scarf Bunnelby. A Choice Scarf is mandatory, as otherwise Wailmer will be hit too hard by faster threats to deal any decent damage with Water Spout. Finally, Water Veil is the only ability of any use, as it prevents burns, which slowly chip away at Wailmer's health and Water Spout's power. Wailmer's other abilities, Oblivious and Pressure, are useless for this set, as the former only prevents Taunt, which does not affect this set, and the latter is better used on bulky sets meant for PP stalling powerful moves. If Hidden Power Fire is chosen, an EV spread of 76 Def / 200 SpA / 200 Spe should be used.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Wailmer is best brought in mid- or late-game to clean up the rest of the opponent's team once everything that could hamper a Water Spout sweep is gone. However, beware faster Choice Scarf Pokemon in your opponent's reserve. Send Wailmer out after one of your Pokemon has fainted, or bring it in after a Memento or slow U-turn. Wailmer is fairly easy to use, as most of the time you will want to use Water Spout. However, if Wailmer isn't healthy or the opponent still has a threat that could critically weaken it, use Wailmer's other Water-type STAB move or the appropriate coverage move for the situation.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>First and foremost, this set likes having Pokemon that resist Water Spout removed or crippled, especially Grass-types, which can hit back with super effective STAB moves. For this reason, Pokemon such as Foongus that resist those STAB moves and can hit back hard are good teammates for Wailmer. Wailmer also appreciates having entry hazards removed so that Water Spout is as powerful as possible. Thus, spinners such as Drilbur and Staryu and Defoggers such as Archen and Vullaby are great teammates. Drilbur and Archen get special mentions because they can set as well as remove hazards, helping Wailmer secure critical OHKOs, such as against Trubbish and Carvanha, and also check Croagunk, which is immune to Wailmer's STAB attacks thanks to Dry Skin. Wallbreakers such as Bunnelby and Darumaka, as well as Knock Off users such as Pawniard and Vullaby, are good teammates because they can soften up walls that can take Wailmer's Water Spout. Finally, a slow U-turn or Volt Switch from Pokemon such as Vullaby and bulky Mienfoo can bring Wailmer in safely and make sure Water Spout is as powerful as possible.</p>"
      },
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is a reliable Water-type STAB move with a decent chance to burn. Roar lets Wailmer phaze the opponent to rack up entry hazards damage or stop a threatening setup sweeper. Rest in tandem with Sleep Talk allows Wailmer to heal itself of status and recover stray damage while continuing to deal damage or phaze foes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize the potential of Eviolite by hitting even numbers in Wailmer's defenses. The leftover EVs are split equally between HP, Special Attack, and Speed so that Wailmer can take more hits, hit a little harder, outspeed defensive Fletchling, and Speed tie with defensive Mienfoo and Adamant Cubone, Larvesta, and Corphish. Eviolite increases Wailmer's already good 30 / 14 / 12 bulk. A Bold nature is preferred as most of the hits Wailmer will be taking are physical, but the Defense and Special Defense EVs can be switched and the nature changed to Calm for more special bulk. Oblivious is the preferred ability to prevent Wailmer from being Taunted, as then it can only switch out or use Scald. Pressure can be used instead to limit the number of times the opponent can use powerful low-PP moves such as Fire Blast and Gunk Shot, but Oblivious is generally more useful. Water Veil is useless on this set because Wailmer can simply Rest to rid itself of a burn, and all its moves are special so it does not care about the Attack drop.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best taken advantage of throughout the match with a wall in reserve that can take strong hits aimed at Wailmer. However, be wary of bringing Wailmer in too late in the game, as then it won't be able to phaze well or even phaze at all. Wailmer can also be brought in to tank neutral or resisted hits in critical situations and then either Rest off the damage or phaze away the threat. Wailmer is also a good sleep absorber, but try to avoid bringing it in on sleep inducers that are Grass-type, as they can deal serious damage to Wailmer with their STAB moves. Finally, make sure to keep track of the number of turns Wailmer has been asleep, as missing a Sleep Talk can cost you valuable damage or give the opponent a game-ending free turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wailmer's purpose is undermined if you choose not to run it with an entry hazard setter, as its phazing is then pointless. Thus, Pokemon such as Archen, Trubbish, and Ferroseed are great teammates. Wailmer also goes well with bulky sweepers such as Scraggy, Timburr, and Croagunk that appreciate the extra damage from Wailmer's phazing, which can secure key OHKOs and 2HKOs for them. In return, those Pokemon can check Pokemon such as Chinchou and Foongus, which threaten Wailmer with their super effective STAB moves.</p>"

  "Numel": {
    "overview": "<p>Numel is a unique Pokemon in the current LC metagame, sporting two great abilities in Oblivious and Simple. Oblivious lets Numel reliably set up Stealth Rock throughout the game, while Simple makes Numel a deadly sweeper, allowing it to quickly boost its stats and power, which is complemented by Numel's great offensive coverage. Numel's unique defensive typing makes it a great switch-in for many Poison-, Grass-, Steel-, Electric-, and Fire-types. Numel does suffer from a few flaws, however, such as its low Speed, lack of reliable recovery, and inability to win against entry hazard removers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Numel has a variety of usable options, including a Rest + Sleep Talk set, which mends its lack of recovery and lets it hit the foe with Lava Plume and Earth Power while asleep. Hidden Power Electric allows Numel to hit Mantyke and Archen, although it does not have many other uses and generally Earth Power will hit Water-types harder. Unless you really want to hit Mantyke hard, Ancient Power generally is more useful. Yawn can be used to force out Numel's switch ins, as well as provide opportunities for teammates to set up. Stockpile can allow Numel to quickly boost both of its defenses thanks to Simple. Sunny Day can also be used to allow Numel to boost its own Growth and Fire-type attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Due to Numel's unfortunate 4x weakness to Water, it is forced out by any Water-types. Mantyke hard walls Numel, as it resists Numel's primary STAB attack and is immune to its secondary STAB attack. Chinchou and Staryu can both force Numel out but don't appreciate taking an Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Drilbur can switch into Numel and force it out with the threat of an Earthquake. They can be crippled on the switch with Will-O-Wisp, however.</p> <p><strong>Archen</strong>: Archen resists Fire and is immune to Ground, but it fears a burn on the switch in.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to its sub par speed, Numel is vulnerable to fast revenge killers and strong priority users such as Fletchling and Corphish.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Lava Plume and Earth Power function as Numel's STAB moves and allow it to threaten Grass-, Electric-, and Steel-types. Lava Plume has higher PP and a high chance to burn the opposing Pokemon, while Fire Blast can be used for additional power at the cost of accuracy. Numel can chip away at opposing Pokemon's health and potentially break their Focus Sash by setting up Stealth Rock. Ancient Power hits Archen and Mantyke, which resist Numel's STAB attacks, while Will-O-Wisp allows Numel to handle physical attackers more consistently and wear down opposing walls and switch-ins.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set maximizes Numel's Special Attack to allow it to hit hard while still taking attacks well. The remaining EVs are funneled into Numel's HP and Defense to give it better mixed bulk and allow it to switch into strong special attackers. Oblivious ensures Numel can always set up Stealth Rock, but if Ancient Power is used, Simple is a good option on the off chance Numel receives a boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Numel is a great switch-in to common Pokemon in the metagame, such as Foongus, Magnemite, and Ferroseed, as they all fear its STAB attacks. Numel also makes for a great counter to Ponyta, as Numel resists its STAB moves. Set up entry hazards or use Will-O-Wisp on switches to burn incoming counters, although Numel must be cautious of burning Guts users such as Timburr.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spritzee's Wish support is an absolute necessity to Numel, as it provides a form of recovery and allows Numel to beat Poison-, Fire-, and Steel-types that give Spritzee trouble throughout the match. Bulky Grass-types such as Pumpkaboo, Ferroseed, and Chespin are needed to cover up Numel's glaring weakness to Water- and Ground-types. Pumpkaboo has the added benefit of being able to spinblock, keeping Numel's Stealth Rock on the field. Numel's typing allows it to switch into the Fire-types that Grass-types cannot beat, forming a good defensive core. Water-type Pokemon such as Chinchou and Staryu function well with Numel as well, as Chinchou resists and beats opposing Water-types, while Staryu is a good switch-in to common Ground-types such as Drilbur and Archen. Chinchou and Staryu are both weak to Grass-types, making Numel a nice switch-in.</p>"
      },
      "Simple Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earth Power and Fire Blast are Numel's two STAB attacks, and Flame Charge allows Numel to boost its Speed by two stages. Growth raises Numel's attacking stats by two stages, making it an imposing sweeper to face once it sets up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set's purpose is to quickly set up multiple boosts and sweep the opponent's weakened team late in the game. 236 EVs allow Numel to hit 13 Speed and outspeed the entirety of the unboosted LC metagame after one Flame Charge, as well as outpace common 17 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Drilbur and Chinchou. A Modest nature, 236 Special Attack EVs, and a Life Orb give Numel maximum damage output. The remaining EVs are placed into Numel's HP for additional bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Without Eviolite, Numel is quite frail and consequentially cannot set up on strong attackers. It is best to set up boosts against defensive Pokemon that cannot hurt Numel, such as Ferroseed. Prioritize raising speed, as without the boost Numel is open to being revenge killed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Numel appreciates sun support from Vulpix, as it provides ample opportunities to set up with sun-boosted Flame Charge and doubles Growth's effect, raising both Numel's Attack and Special Attack by 4 stages. Chlorophyll users can also be paired with Numel and Vulpix to beat the Water- and Grass-types that prevent Numel from sweeping. Stealth Rock setters such as Dwebble and Onix help Numel beat the Flying-types that wall it such as Archen and Mantyke. Chinchou can also beat Archen and Mantyke. Numel also appreciates the pivot support that Volt Switch provides, allowing Numel the opportunity to switch in on Grass-types and set up. Ferroseed partners well with Numel, reliably beating Water- and Ground-types while having the ability to provide the entry hazard support Numel requires. Lileep also makes for a great partner, as it can wall Archen and Mantyke and switch into Water-types thanks to Storm Drain.</p>"

  "Cacnea": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Cacnea's Speed and bulk are mediocre, it has a great Attack stat as well as a decent attacking movepool, which includes a powerful STAB move in Seed Bomb as well as priority in Sucker Punch, which helps Cacnea account for its awful Speed. Water Absorb gives Cacnea an immunity to Water-type attacks, and its Grass typing gives it an immunity to powder-based moves. It also resists common attacking types including Ground, Electric, and Grass. However, Cacnea is also weak to five common attacking types, which is compounded by its low defenses, meaning it will not take hits very well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cacnea can choose to run a mixed set with Growth, or go fully special with Nasty Plot, however its special movepool is extremely limited. Cacnea also has access to many other support or defensive options such as Spikes, Destiny Bond, Grass Whistle, and Synthesis; however, Cacnea lacks the Speed and bulk to use many of these effectively, and Grass Whistle's accuracy is very poor. Cacnea has access to Switcheroo, with which it can cripple an enemy with a Choice item. Cacnea can use Thunder Punch to surprise Flying-type Pokemon such as Fletchling and Archen on the switch. It also can use a Substitute + Focus Punch set, although it is illegal with Water Absorb as Focus Punch can only be obtained before Gen V.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Vullaby can take anything Cacnea can throw at it and respond with a STAB Brave Bird. Fletchling can OHKO Cacnea after Stealth Rock damage with a priority Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Larvesta and Ponyta can nail Cacnea with a Flare Blitz, and both of them are bulky enough to come in on a Drain Punch; they can also burn Cacnea with Flame Body.</p> <p><strong>Foongus</strong>: Foongus takes pitiful damage from Bullet Seed and Drain Punch and can simply nail Cacnea with a Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Croagunk</strong>: Croagunk resists all three of Cacnea's main offensive options and can nail it with Gunk Shot or set up a Swords Dance comfortably.</p> <p><strong>Cottonee</strong>: Cottonee can Encore Cacnea into Sucker Punch or Swords Dance and resists Cacnea's other options.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Cacnea to boost its already high Attack and enables its attacks to break through bulky enemies. Seed Bomb is Cacnea's main STAB move, which heavily damages opponents such as Chinchou, Drilbur, and Tirtouga. It also breaks Sturdy and Focus Sashes while breaking Substitute, which enemies may set up while Cacnea uses Sucker Punch or a Swords Dance. Drain Punch hits the Steel-types that wall Seed Bomb, particularly Pawniard and Magnemite, and Sucker Punch lets Cacnea compensate for its low Speed to an extent by hitting with priority; it also hits fairly hard and punishes frail attackers such as Abra.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Defense EVs with Eviolite and an Impish Nature allow Cacnea to take physical hits more reliably, most notably Fletchling's Acrobatics, which only OHKOes Cacnea 6.3% of the time. 156 Attack EVs let Cacnea hit hard without taking from Cacnea's defenses, which reach Eviolite numbers. The remaining EVs are placed in HP and Special Defense to increase Cacnea's bulk further while reaching the aforementioned Eviolite numbers. Water Absorb is Cacnea's only usable ability, and allows it to come in on Water-type foes easily as well as avoiding nasty Scald burns from Chinchou and other Water-types. If raw power is needed, a set with 36 HP / 236 Atk / 116 Def / 116 SpD can be used, although this lowers Cacnea's physical bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Even though Cacnea is somewhat bulky, it should not be switched in on attacks, as it will have to normally take two hits before it gets a chance to attack. As such, a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is helpful to bring Cacnea in. Cacnea can set up a Swords Dance on bulky Water-types such as Chinchou, Tirtouga, and Slowpoke and proceed to dent the opposing team. However, Sucker Punch should be used carefully, as it might give foes an opportunity to set up easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cacnea needs a teammate to take down the Flying-types which give it trouble. Archen, Chinchou, and Magnemite are all capable of checking them while providing decent synergy with Cacnea. They can also take on the Fire-types which trouble Cacnea. Cacnea's moves aren't as strong as it would like, so a teammate with Knock Off such as Pawniard or Mienfoo can help it by removing items from bulky enemies, including Eviolite and Berry Juice. Cacnea is susceptible to status and damage, so a cleric such as Spritzee or Lickitung can help it last longer in battle.</p>"

  "Swablu": {
    "overview": "<p>Swablu has great Special Defense and a wonderful ability in Natural Cure, which makes it a fine pivot into Scald and Thunder Wave users. Its Defense is somewhat lackluster when not invested in, but access to great boosting options in Cotton Guard and Agility make up for this. The combination of these two moves grants Swablu the ability to sweep and otherwise threaten offense teams. Access to recovery in Roost gives Swablu the ability to make use of these boosting options while also continually checking Abra. However, Swablu suffers from weak offensive stats, although this is partially compensated for by high Base Power attacks and a limited but adequate offensive movepool.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swablu can run Hidden Power Grass in place of Heat Wave to lure and remove Onix and Omanyte, which otherwise are perfect counters to Swablu. Ice Beam is an option to lure Archen, though only the Berry Juice is consumed, which can be more trouble than good. Moonblast can be used to hit Fighting-types slightly harder and allows for Swablu to win against Bulk Up Timburr, but is generally less useful than the both Cotton Guard and Agility. A special set with Hyper Voice over Return can also be used, though this is noticeably weaker than the physical set and loses many important 2HKOs and 3HKOs. A special set does give Swablu's coverage options much more power, however, while also allowing Swablu to function while burnt and overall increasing Swablu's ability as a Natural Cure pivot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types resist all of Swablu's attacks and can retaliate back with a super effective STAB option. Shell Smashers are especially dangerous, as they can boost freely on Swablu.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Swablu's best option versus Steel-type Pokemon is Heat Wave, which does barely enough to 2HKO Ferroseed and Magnemite. Steel-types are generally able to switch in to stop Swablu, either through Knock Off and Thunder Wave in the cases of Pawniard and Ferroseed or with powerful Thunderbolts in the case of Magnemite.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Swablu typically only runs Return, meaning that Ghost-types can switch in unopposed frequently. Heat Wave also does minimal damage to every Ghost-type except Pumpkaboo and Phantump.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon with recovery</strong>: Porygon has high Special Attack and often carries super effective coverage versus Swablu; this coupled with Porygon's massive bulk means that Swablu struggles even to dent Porygon. Spritzee, Hippopotas with Rock-type moves, and Lickitung are other examples of bulky Pokemon that can outlast Swablu, though not quite as well as Porygon.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Cotton Guard": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is the highest power STAB move Swablu has access to that does not have downsides, allowing Swablu to secure as many 2HKOs and 3HKOs as possible. Roost provides Swablu with recovery and lets it make use of its bulk and boosts. Cotton Guard allows Swablu to become a bulky monstrosity and prevents all priority moves from revenge killing it. Agility grants Swablu the ability to outspeed the unboosted metagame and sweep. With both Cotton Guard and Agility, Swablu can effectively overwhelm offensive teams. However, you can forgo one of these for Heat Wave, which gives Swablu the ability to lure and defeat Magnemite, Pawniard, and Ferroseed, though it is a weak attack otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The HP EVs give Swablu the most bulk possible while also allowing it to survive four Stealth Rock switch ins, and the Special Defense EVs allow Swablu to reach 16 Special Defense, the largest important benchmark for Swablu. These in tandem with Eviolite give Swablu enough bulk to effectively pull off the set. Attack is maximized so Swablu has significant chance of being a threat while Natural Cure allows for Swablu to heal potential burns. Natural Cure allows Swablu to absorb status for your team, such as Thunder Waves from Staryu or Ponyta's Will-O-Wisp, which can be very useful early-game (burns do limit Swablu's effectiveness until they can be healed off, however).</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swablu should find opportunities to set up versus weaker special attackers, or special attackers that have poor coverage against Swablu, such as Spritzee, Abra, or Choice-locked Gothita. However, status Pokemon prevent Swablu from sweeping and should not be set up against nor should Swablu set up before all of them are removed. Additionally, Swablu needs to keep its Eviolite to maintain opportunities to set up. In order to rack up damage on Swablu's counters, Swablu should come in several times to wear them down before attempting a sweep. Stealth Rock should be kept off your side of the field as much as possible to sustain Swablu's HP and allow for Swablu to pivot into Scald and Thunder Wave as much as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Nosepass provides Swablu with ample switch-in opportunities thanks to its slow Volt Switch and also provides entry hazard support. Nosepass also has similar checks and good coverage options to weaken them and pave way for Swablu's sweep. Seel resists Ice and can lure in and remove Chinchou and other Electric-types with Drill Run, which Swablu greatly appreciates. Seel can also weaken bulky Pokemon and can pick off faster, problematic threats like Elekid with its priority. Seel also needs a switch in to Grass-type Pokemon, which Swablu excels at handling despite missing out on having any decent Flying-type STAB moves. Nosepass, Seel, and Swablu form a dastardly core that can effectively fend off some of the metagame and provide a large and very defensive backbone to several team archetypes. Torchic can be beneficial to Swablu, aiding it by Baton Passing Attack and Speed boosts. Most trappers pair well with Swablu; Trapinch and Diglett are able to remove Steel- and Rock-types for Swablu, and Pursuit trappers such as Houndour, Stunky, and Pawniard are able to remove troublesome Ghost-types for Swablu. The former two Pursuit users can also be used to lure in bulky Ground- and Rock-types with Hidden Power Grass. Gothita can be effective for trapping and crippling Ferroseed and Rock-types that Diglett cannot and is able to cripple bulky Pokemon with Trick. Knock Off users like Pawniard, Mienfoo, and Abra, as well as Thief users such as Snubbull are able to help remove the Eviolites of bulky Pokemon for Swablu, aiding in its sweep later in the match. Entry hazard setters, chiefly Omanyte and Dwebble, can provide much needed support for Swablu and help it secure many 2HKOs with multiple layers. Both Omanyte and Dwebble can help with Knock Off support as well. Toxic Spikes support from Skrelp, Omanyte, or Skorupi allows Swablu to slowly beat out most attackers and helps wear down Swablu's best counters in Rock-types.</p> <p>Fletchling has many options to support Swablu; Hidden Power Water Fletchling forms a fiendishly effective core with Swablu, luring in Archen and Pokemon with Ground / Rock and Steel / Rock typing. Likewise, Hidden Power Grass Fletchling can be used to lure Tirtouga and Omanyte, which are both immediately more threatening than Archen, and still hits Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon. Salac or Durin Berry Fletchling with Natural Gift performs similarly; Salac Berry works against Steel-types and Shell Smashers at the expense of losing coverage on Archen, while Durin Berry works more effectively against Onix and hits Archen. Overheat Fletchling can be ran to remove all Steel-types for Swablu. Vullaby can also form an effective core with Swablu, weakening most of their shared checks rather effectively with Knock Off and a strong Brave Bird or U-turn.</p>"

  "Corphish": {
    "overview": "<p>Corphish is a great wallbreaker and late-game cleaner thanks to Adaptability, a great ability that boosts Corphish's STAB multiplier from 1.5 to 2. Backing up this ability, Corphish has great STAB moves in Crabhammer and priority Aqua Jet. Corphish also has access to Knock Off, a great move for a wallbreaker. Although Corphish has access to two boosting moves in Swords Dance and Dragon Dance, it faces competition as a setup sweeper from Scraggy, Fletchling, Tirtouga, and Omanyte. Corphish's flaws lie in its only decent physical bulk, fairly mediocre special bulk, and sub-par speed, albeit it's still fast enough to outspeed most walls. Lastly, Corphish struggles against prominent threats such as Chinchou, Cottonee, and Croagunk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Superpower can be used instead of Swords Dance on the first set, giving Corphish the ability to beat Ferroseed and Lileep. Hone Claws should never be used, as it is outclassed by both Dragon Dance and Swords Dance. Substitute is an option as Corphish can force a lot of switches. Aerial Ace can be used as well to deal moderate damage to Foongus and Croagunk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-resistant Walls and Tanks</strong>: Walls and tanks resisting Water-type moves, such as Croagunk, Foongus, Cottonee, and Chinchou are all a big problem for Corphish. Croagunk is immune to Corphish's STAB moves, and resists all of Corphish's other attacks except Aerial Ace. Foongus and Cottonee not only resist Corphish's STAB moves but Superpower as well (with Cottonee also resisting Knock Off), and they can also retaliate with their super effective Grass-type STAB or status moves. Chinchou resists Corphish's STAB moves and can easily outpace and retaliate with a super effective Electric-type STAB move. Lileep is also immune to Crabhammer and Aqua Jet, but has to be careful against Knock Off and a possible Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Corphish's biggest problems are its low Speed and no recovery options, so naturally strong or bulky offensive threats can check Corphish with little prior damage. However, Corphish does hit really hard so this can be tough. Examples include Chinchou, Magnemite, Mienfoo, and Cottonee.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Crabhammer is an extremely strong Water-type STAB move that, thanks to Adaptability, does a heavy amount of damage to everything that doesn't resist it, OHKOing offensive Mienfoo after some prior damage. Knock Off removes items and allows Corphish to weaken its checks, such as Foongus and Chinchou. Aqua Jet is powerful priority that lets Corphish pick off weakened threats. Swords Dance boosts Corphish's Attack, making it very threatening.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The following EV spread maximizes Corphish's Attack and Speed, reaching 18 Attack and 13 Speed, letting Corphish hit as hard as possible while still outspeeding most walls. Eviolite is used on this set in order to give Corphish more bulk, giving it fair physical bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is fairly straightforward to use. Removing Eviolite is really helpful for Corphish and its partners; hit opposing switch-ins with Knock Off, use Swords Dance if a boost is needed, and then attack with Crabhammer or Aqua Jet afterwards, or just switch out if they threaten Corphish. Try to keep Corphish alive against stall and bulky teams, as Corphish is great at weakening walls and bulkier Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Corphish can help to wallbreak for other Water-type sweepers; Tirtouga, Omanyte, and Carvanha are therefore great teammates to use alongside Corphish. Corphish has no access to recovery, and is damaged by both Spikes and Stealth Rocks, so hazard removal is appreciated, especially because Corphish loves being able to switch in and out often. Archen can hit threats such as Croagunk and Chinchou with Earthquake, and can also beat Grass-types with Acrobatics, but shares a common Electric-type weakness. Hazard setters such as Drilbur and Ferroseed provide important residual damage to opponents with hazards, which can greatly aid Corphish when wallbreaking. Drilbur can also remove hazards thanks to Rapid Spin, and threaten Croagunk and Chinchou with its STAB Earthquake. Wish support is nice for Corphish on more balanced teams for recovery, so both Spritzee and Lickitung deserve a mention.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Corphish's Attack and Speed, allowing it to sweep quite easily late-game. Crabhammer is its primary STAB move, doing tons of damage when backed by Adaptability and a possible Dragon Dance boost. Knock Off provides solid neutral coverage alongside Crabhammer and can be used to cripple switch-ins early-game. Aqua Jet gives Corphish more utility before it sets up and allows it to pick off weakened Choice Scarf or priority users after setting up. Aerial Ace is a less useful option in the last slot, but it will ensure that Corphish is not completely walled by Croagunk (although Corphish will have to be healthy, and Croagunk without its Eviolite, for Corphish to actually beat it); it also deals a decent amount of damage to Eviolite-less Foongus and Cottonee. Superpower can deal with weakened Ferroseed and Lileep, but the given moves are generally more useful.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs best bring out Corphish's sweeping potential by maximizing its Attack and Speed, with the remaining EVs in Defense to hit an Eviolite number. A Jolly nature is used to hit 14 Speed so that Corphish can outspeed 19 and 20 Speed Pokemon such as Abra, Taillow, Elekid, and Diglett after a boost; however, if you are confident in removing Staryu and in getting Stealth Rock up to ensure that Aqua Jet OHKOes Elekid and Taillow, an Adamant nature noticeably benefits Corphish's damage rolls; most other 19 and 20 Speed Pokemon fear Aqua Jet regardless. Eviolite is the preferred item, as it gives Corphish the bulk to survive a number of would-be OHKOs and set up. Life Orb is a viable alternative, as it grants Corphish an enormous amount of power after a Dragon Dance, cleanly OHKOing defensive Porygon after Stealth Rock provided Corphish has an Adamant nature and OHKOing Fletchling with a +1 Aqua Jet. However, the loss of bulk makes it much more difficult to actually get the boosts; additionally, if Life Orb is used, Corphish's HP IV should be reduced to 13. Berry Juice is a decent choice if you want Corphish to try to set up more than one Dragon Dance, but the lack of immediate bulk can be troublesome.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is usually best to have Corphish set up late in the match, after its checks, which include Foongus, Croagunk, Chinchou, Magnemite, and Cottonee, have been heavily weakened or removed. Despite this, Corphish possesses a great deal of utility with Knock Off and strong priority, which can be useful throughout the match. Corphish can support its own sweep by removing its checks' items with Knock Off earlier on in the match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Unlike other variants of Corphish, Dragon Dance Corphish is usually used as the dedicated sweeper in Water-type spam cores, although it is still effective as a wallbreaker thanks to Knock Off and its overall enormous damage output. Good choices for Water-type spam partners include Carvanha, Tirtouga, and Omanyte. Gothita and Diglett are able to trap and weaken or KO many of Corphish's checks, such as Croagunk and Chinchou. As with all offensive Pokemon, entry hazard support helps Corphish obtain notable KOs and wear down the opposition; Ferroseed in particular handles many of Corphish's checks, but it may forfeit momentum on offensive teams.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Aqua Jet is the main move on the set, and is great for revenge killing and cleaning the opposing team up, thanks to Choice Band. STAB Crabhammer can be used continuously thanks to the ability to hit switch-ins extremely hard, therefore weakening walls to open the way for a teammate to sweep. Knock Off is another great move Corphish has access to, and functions in a very similar manner to Crabhammer, except with the bonus effect of removing items. Switcheroo is used to cripple walls, such as Spritzee, Cottonee, and Foongus, giving them a Choice Band, while Corphish receives an Eviolite back.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread is used to maximize Corphish's Attack and bolster Corphish's Speed so it can outspeed more walls. The remaining EVs are thrown into Defense to improve Corphish's physical bulk. Adaptability is an obvious choice when it comes to ability, as it boosts the power of Corphish's STAB moves by 50%. Choice Band is chosen to give Corphish even more power, and gives Corphish the ability to cripple walls and special attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early- to mid-game, Corphish should be using Crabhammer and Knock Off to weaken switch-ins. Aqua Jet is used for revenge killing and cleaning late-game. If Corphish finds itself on the field against a faster Pokemon, it is, in most cases, best to switch out given its frailty. Slow Volt Switch and U-turn teammates are therefore very important for that reason. Switcheroo is best used on a predicted switch-in mid-game if it's unlikely for Corphish to clean with Aqua Jet later.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Omanyte and Tirtouga are the number one partners for Choice Band Corphish, given that Corphish can weaken or remove almost all of Omanyte and Tirtouga's checks. Slow Volt Switch and U-turn users, such as Mienfoo and Magnemite also work well with Corphish.</p>"

  "Baltoy": {
    "overview": "<p>Baltoy finds its niche in being the only Rapid Spin user that is resistant to Stealth Rock and is immune to Spikes. This sets it apart from other Rapid Spin users, as it can come in on Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin it away while not being too worn down by it. Baltoy also has access to Stealth Rock. With Eviolite, Baltoy has reasonable bulk, and backed by its unique resistances, it has the ability to wall various threats such as Trubbish. However, Baltoy is outclassed by almost entirely everything, including Drilbur, Sandshrew, Hippopotas, and Staryu. Because of the prominence of Knock Off, Baltoy's Psychic typing is very detrimental to its role as a bulky Pokemon. Baltoy's common weaknesses are easily exploited as well, with many top-tier threats having powerful STAB moves to heavily damage, if not KO Baltoy with. A drawback to Baltoy itself is its case of huge four-moveslot syndrome; it can't fit everything it needs to in one set. It also is extremely weak, usually leaving it setup fodder. Baltoy's few useful niches should be taken advantage of when using it; otherwise you're better off running Drilbur.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Running Trick alongside a Choice item is effective because Baltoy can hit 14 Speed and catch many opponents off guard. Trick Room is a neat move that Baltoy can utilize to support its teammates. Baltoy also has access to dual screens, which work well in tandem with Trick Room. Magic Coat is intriguing thanks to its ability to reflect Taunt and opposing entry hazards. Calm Mind could be used on a more offensively oriented set, but Baltoy is far too weak to utilize it effectively. In a similar vein, Cosmic Power is an option but is, once again, too gimmicky for use. Dazzling Gleam can catch Scraggy switch-ins off guard but lacks use outside of this. Some other coverage options include Grass Knot and Shadow Ball. Explosion is a neat way to lure in Defog users and explode to ensure that Stealth Rock stays up. Finally, Gravity could be used for a non-blockable Earthquake, but is also gimmicky, uses up a precious moveslot, and removes Baltoy's Ground immunity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off removes Baltoy's Eviolite, which boosts its bulk.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Moves</strong>: Baltoy has a total of six weaknesses; two common Pokemon that threaten it are Chinchou and Pawniard, which can pressure it with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types are immune to Earthquake and shrug off Psychic, although some frailer Flying-types must watch out for Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types block Baltoy from using Rapid Spin, though Gastly must watch out for Psychic.</p>",

      "Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin removes entry hazards from your side of the field. Stealth Rock damages Pokemon when they switch in, and also works very well with Rapid Spin. Earthquake and Psychic aren't very powerful, but they do allow Baltoy to harm foes in some way. Recycle should only be used with Berry Juice, providing reliable recovery. Ice Beam can be used over Psychic for coverage, though it is very weak.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The allocated Defense and Special Defense EVs allow Baltoy to hit 16 in both stats, hitting Eviolite numbers. The rest of the EVs are dumped into HP and Attack to boost them a bit. A Relaxed nature is used to ensure the power of Baltoy's moves is not affected, and Baltoy doesn't mind the Speed drop. Eviolite is the preferred item, keeping great bulk and being more long-lasting than Berry Juice, although Berry Juice is useful for instant recovery. The exception to this is when running Recycle, which allows Baltoy to reuse Berry Juice. Levitate is a unique niche that Baltoy has over Drilbur, giving it an immunity to Ground-type attacks, Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web which Drilbur lacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Baltoy is quite simple to use; its primary goal is to set Stealth Rock or remove hazards with Rapid Spin. Baltoy is immune to Spikes and resists Stealth Rock, which is another niche. Do not lead with Baltoy, as even though it has Stealth Rock, it has quite a bad matchup often and is best used when it is brought in on something it can wall. Baltoy is really passive and tends to lure in setup sweepers, so be sure to have a Pokemon that is able to phaze or utilize Taunt. Knock Off is Baltoy's bane, removing its source of bulk and often leaving it low on health, so always be sure to keep it away from any potential Knock Off user. Prediction is helpful; for instance, using Psychic on a Gastly switch-in can remove it and will allow Baltoy to use Rapid Spin without being spinblocked by Gastly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull have good synergy with Baltoy, resisting Dark- and Bug-type moves. Dark-types such as Scraggy and Pawniard also have good synergy with Baltoy thanks to Baltoy's resistance to Fighting-type moves. U-turn troubles Baltoy, making Steel-types like Ferroseed good partners. In particular, Ferroseed is useful because it can freely set Spikes without having to worry about your own Defog removing it. Cleric support is useful to remove Toxic; Chinchou has nearly flawless synergy with Baltoy and access to Heal Bell as well.</p>"

It has access to Stealth Rock, which is more important than ever with Sturdy + Berry Juice and Pokemon such as Fletchling, Larvesta, and Ponyta, turning some 2HKOs into OHKOs. Lileep can also wall special attackers that don't have a setup move, such as Abra, Chinchou, Staryu, and Gastly. The same goes for physical attackers that cannot set up and lack super effective moves against Lileep, such as Carvanha, Ponyta, and Bunnelby. One of Lileep's biggest problems is its weakness to Fighting- and Steel-types, both very common in Little Cup. It is also setup bait for certain sweepers. The loss of permanent sand also hurts its ability to rack up passive damage and limits the duration of its 1.5x Special Defense boost while walling.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Amnesia, Barrier, Stockpile, and Curse are decent options, especially Curse as it makes Lileep a boosting tank. Mirror Coat could be a fun surprise, but is too situational. Bullet Seed is a good option together with Curse if you want to use physical moves, since it allows Lileep to beat Tirtouga one-on-one at +2 Attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Mienfoo, Timburr, and other Fighting-types can Knock Off Lileep's Eviolite and then severely damage it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pawniard and Magnemite both resist Giga Drain and Ancient Power, are immune to Toxic, and have a super effective STAB Steel-type move that they can 2HKO Lileep with. However, they must watch out for Hidden Power Fighting and Earth Power, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Fletchling can set up on Lileep if it lacks Ancient Power. Calm Mind Spritzee can set up on it as well, but hates Toxic.</p>",

      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is an important entry hazard, and Lileep is one of the few walls with access to it that also gets a recovery move. Giga Drain gets STAB and recovers HP, and hits Staryu and Drilbur, two of the most common Rapid Spin users, for super effective damage. Recover is for longevity, since Giga Drain doesn't recover enough HP most of the time. Ancient Power also gets STAB and a nice 10% chance for +1 across all stats, while also hitting most Defog users such as Vullaby and Archen, as well as Larvesta, Fletchling, and other Flying-type Pokemon super effectively. Toxic wears down walls Lileep would be otherwise be unable to harm. Earth Power and Hidden Power Fighting can be used for Fire- or Steel-type coverage, particularly against Magnemite and Pawniard, but they offer less coverage on other important Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Calm nature lets Lileep take on special attackers a bit better, but it can also use a Bold nature with a 228 HP / 220 Def / 60 SpD EV spread. The maximum HP investment is to help increase Lileep's mixed bulk</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Setting up Stealth Rock is Lileep's primary purpose. The second is to wall or pivot and switch into Pokemon that trouble its teammates, such as Foongus, Abra, Staryu, Chinchou, Ponyta, and special attackers. It can often be the weakest link on a team, despite having a great niche, so sometimes it is better to just set up Stealth Rock and then sacrifice it to get another Pokemon in safely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slowpoke and Ponyta / Mienfoo / Timburr make a great pivot core, being able to switch in on most Pokemon in the metagame. Use it with teammates that hate the Pokemon Lileep walls or pivots into and/or appreciate Stealth Rock. Lileep likes partners that can take on Steel- and Fighting-types. Mienfoo and Timburr can easily take on Pawniard, Magnemite, and Ferroseed, while Larvesta or Vullaby can switch into Fighting-types and also still take on Pawniard. Lileep has the added bonus of being able to take on powerful sun-boosted Fire-type attacks from most variants of Ponyta and Vulpix, so it doesn't mind if your Larvesta's, Ponyta's, or Vulpix's Sunny Day boosts your opponent's Fire-type attacks.</p>"

  "Anorith": {
    "overview": "<p>Anorith's huge Attack stat is what jumps out at first glance. Its ability to both spin and set entry hazards sets it apart from other spinners. Anorith occupies an excellent Speed tier, with its 18 Speed allowing it to outspeed Drilbur and Taunt Mienfoo. It can even sweep with a Swords Dance set late-game, although hazard control should be Anorith's main goal. However, Anorith is very frail, even with Eviolite, meaning that it often cannot switch in safely to Rapid Spin away entry hazards. It is also weak to those entry hazards, specifically Stealth Rock, severely limiting its usefulness. Anorith's Attack stat is also wasted due to its shallow movepool, which leaves it unable to harm Fighting-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Anorith has a small movepool, so its options are limited. Brick Break can be used to OHKO Pawniard without needing a Swords Dance boost and a Life Orb, and it also hits Ferroseed harder than X-Scissor. However, it usually cannot find a slot for it. Anorith can run a Rock Polish set but it cannot use it effectively due to it being walled by almost every Fighting-type. Swift Swim can be used, but once again Anorith is walled by most Fighting-types, not to mention it can't take rain-boosted Aqua Jets among other priority attacks. Speaking of Aqua Jet, Anorith can use it as a priority attack. However, it is very weak outside of rain, and with rain up, Anorith will usually have +2 Speed due to Swift Swim anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Anorith is extremely frail, so Pokemon that are faster than it can usually eliminate it. Abra and Staryu both naturally outspeed and threaten Anorith.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users are even more dangerous than Pokemon that are naturally faster than Anorith, as you usually don't know whether a Pokemon is holding a Choice Scarf or not. This uncertainty can usually end a Swords Dance sweep.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Scraggy resist both of Anorith's STAB moves and do not care about Knock Off. Timburr and Scraggy can also set up on Anorith.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Anorith's 18 Speed, it can set up Stealth Rock extremely early in the game, outspeeding fast Taunt users such as Aipom. Rapid Spin allows Anorith to get rid of opposing hazards without relying on Defog. Rock Blast is useful in that it allows Anorith to break through Substitutes and Focus Sash, while being more accurate than Stone Edge. This allows Anorith to be an anti-lead to Sticky Web teams. Knock Off cripples defensive threats and slower offensive threats by removing their item, often paving the way for other teammates to sweep. X-Scissor is a great alternate STAB move if Knock Off is not needed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed are a must because of Anorith's frailty, huge Attack stat, and reliance on its 18 Speed to be truly effective. The remainder EVs are put into Defense to increase it by one point. Berry Juice is the best item for Anorith, as it promotes longevity allowing Anorith to switch in on Stealth Rock and spin them away throughout the match. However, Eviolite can be used on more offensive teams, as Anorith would only need to spin Stealth Rock away once if at all.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Anorith has the fastest Stealth Rock in the tier, letting it set entry hazards before most opponents can KO it, and this should be utilized to the greatest extent. Since Anorith reaches 18 Speed, it can be used as an emergency revenge killer if needed. Knock Off should be used after entry hazards are set to help out Anorith's teammates. Anorith should be kept away from 19 Speed Pokemon, such as Abra, as they can usually KO it before Anorith can do anything.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Combining Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin onto one Pokemon frees up a team slot. Offensive sweepers love Anorith's ability to clear hazards for them, set up hazards to weaken the opponent, and get rid of Eviolite. Anorith lures out Pawniard, so Fighting-types make good partners to take advantage of that. Scraggy and Timburr can take advantage of the hazards and Anorith's tendency to lure in Pawniard to set up a Dragon Dance or a Bulk Up. Chinchou can switch into Water- and Steel-type moves easily, while Anorith can remove Lileep with X-Scissor also threaten common walls with Knock Off. Ferroseed resists all of Anorith's weaknesses, while providing Spikes to complement Anorith's Stealth Rock.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>After a Swords Dance, factoring in Life Orb, Anorith reaches an impressive 49 Attack. This is massive in Little Cup and can easily devastate teams. X-Scissor is a reliable STAB move, destroying Pokemon such as Slowpoke and Lileep. Rock Blast is used to break through Focus Sash and Sturdy, as well as Substitute. Aerial Ace is the preferred fourth move, as it allows Anorith to hit Fighting-types with a super effective attack, often OHKOing late-game. However, Knock Off can be used in its place if Anorith is used alongside another sweeper, as not many threats like taking massive damage from a +2 attack and also losing their item.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed are necessary because of Anorith's frailty, huge Attack stat, and reliance on Speed to be effective. The remaining EVs increase its Defense by one point. An Adamant nature is not effective at all, as Anorith's biggest niche is its high base Speed, and not hitting 18 Speed really hurts. A Life Orb gives Anorith the power it needs to secure key OHKOs, such as on Pawniard and Mienfoo.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This is a glass cannon of a set and should be used on a revenge kill, or after a Memento. Since Anorith reaches 18 Speed, it is not often outsped, meaning it can usually sweep late-game. With Rock Blast, Anorith is a decent answer to Pokemon such as Fletchling and Dwebble, breaking Dwebble's Sturdy + Berry Juice combination and hitting Fletchling with a super effective 2x move. Priority really hurts Anorith, so be careful around Pokemon such as Pawniard and Timburr.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Removing hazards is a must for this set, as Anorith is weak to both Stealth Rock and Spikes. Staryu is excellent due to its Water typing and reliable recovery, although Drilbur can be used with great success as well. Anorith only has a maximum of 18 Speed, so 19 Speed Pokemon such as Staryu can be big threats. Accordingly, Pokemon that can switch in and beat Staryu, such as Foongus or Chinchou, are a must.</p>"

Unlike the other Ghost-types in LC, Shuppet has access to all of Shadow Sneak, Knock Off, and Destiny Bond.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Adamant Choice Band set would also profit from Shuppet's priority moves, taking advantage of its synergy with Frisk and Trick. Shuppet's movepool shows many options, some playable and others the very opposite. Shadow Ball is a good STAB move, but it's not so easy to find a free moveslot for it. Sucker Punch has a higher Base Power than Shadow Sneak and could be used as an alternative, but it is only useful if the foe attacks. Furthermore, Payback could be useful, as its Base Power doubles if the foe has taken its turn. Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp could used. Will-O-Wisp can be useful for crippling Knock Off absorbers, for example. Although Shuppet can learn Phantom Force, it's better not to use it, because wasting a turn with Phantom Force must be avoided. Shuppet learns Taunt too but cannot use very well due to its low Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fletchling</strong>: Fletchling is a good counter to offensive Trick Room Shuppet, as it is not affected by Knock Off or Shadow Sneak, bypasses Trick Room with Gale Wings, and can recover any lost HP using Roost prior to KOing Shuppet.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types threaten Shuppet, as they resist its main moves. Some Dark-types even have access to Sucker Punch and Pursuit. Pawniard, Vullaby, and Scraggy are especially threatening, as they can KO Shuppet with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Spritzee</strong>: Wish + Protect Spritzee can wall Shuppet easily, but it's quite rare to see Spritzee and Shuppet face-to-face, as Spritzee doesn't want to lose its Eviolite to a lead Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Faster/Prankster Taunt Users</strong>: Cottonee, Prankster Purrloin, Mienfoo, Aipom, and Onix are prime examples of Pokemon that can outspeed and Taunt Shuppet, preventing it from setting up Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Despite Shuppet's good Attack stat, it has few strong attacking moves and can only really be threatening with Knock Off. Ferroseed, Lickitung, Porygon, Mienfoo, and Timburr are examples of bulky Pokemon that Shuppet can't easily beat.</p>",

      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room allows Shuppet to support its team. While Shadow Sneak is its only priority STAB move, Knock Off can cripple Pokemon that switch into Shuppet, by removing their item. The last slot is for Destiny Bond, allowing Shuppet to KO itself and bring a foe down with it; however, this only works if Shuppet can outspeed the foe with Trick Room.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Attack, and the rest of the EVs are invested into both defenses, which are unsatisfactory. On the other hand, other EVs investment with Shuppet's Focus Sash and desired low Speed, will be useless. Focus Sash ensures that Shuppet can survive one attack and set up Trick Room. Furthermore, it allows for synergy with Destiny Bond if you decide to use it. Frisk is useful to scout for items carried by foes, but Cursed Body could be better. With a 30% chance to disable any move that hits Shuppet, Cursed Body could force any foe to switch out and thereby allow a Trick Room sweeper to beat or force out something it couldn't otherwise. Using Cursed Body usually allows Shuppet to push out Fighting-types, as most Fighting-types only have one means of hitting Ghost-types for decent damage, Timburr and Croagunk in particular.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>After Trick Room is set, Shuppet's priority Speed is useful for hitting other Pokemon with Destiny Bond and boosted Knock Off, which can be used as well. A priority move such as Shadow Sneak could be useful to revenge kill foes. By using Destiny Bond, you secure at least one KO before Shuppet faints. With Trick Room, Shuppet can play a different role other than just a suicide lead, but Shuppet's poor defenses prevent it from safely switching in multiple times to set up Trick Room.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Spritzee and Porygon can set Trick Room and take advantage of it. Slow, offensive Pokemon such as Bunnelby, Magnemite, Cubone, Golett, Solosis, and Trapinch benefit nicely from Trick Room, utilizing its effects to mend their low Speed stat and sweep opposing teams.</p>"

  "Duskull": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Duskull may seem like a great wall, but due to its abysmal HP, and its weakness to the ever-present Knock Off, it makes for a mediocre wall at best. Duskull has to rely on status to KO foes, which is not a very effective strategy, as Duskull has no reliable recovery. Duskull finds itself being dead weight for most teams, as it is outclassed in almost everything it can do and cannot successfully harm most of the LC metagame. Duskull's few strengths do not outweigh its many weaknesses, leaving it a poor choice for a slot on a team. That being said, Duskull can be used effectively on some stall teams that rely on entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Curse is difficult to utilize because Duskull can be whittled down easily. Toxic isn't very useful, due to how common switches are. Rest and Sleep Talk provide what can be considered reliable recovery, but when Duskull is asleep, it becomes more of setup bait than it already is. Memento can support sweepers, but Duskull is difficult to use on fast-paced teams, due to it being counter-momentous. Hex and Shadow Ball are both STAB moves, but Duskull's low Special Attack means that these attacks will do meager damage to anything even somewhat bulky. Haze can limit setup sweepers, but most sweepers can still beat Duskull without a boost. Taunt could be used, but Duskull's low Speed will usually allow at least one setup or status move to be used before Taunt is deployed. Destiny Bond is very limited due to Duskull's abhorrent Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt can leave Duskull crippled, as it can only use Shadow Sneak to defend itself.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Shadow Sneak does not OHKO any relevant Ghost-types, while most can OHKO or 2HKO Duskull with a super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: If a Substitute user is not weak to Shadow Sneak, it can effectively shut Duskull down.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers that do not care about being burned such as Omanyte, Scraggy, and Timburr will continue sweeping like nothing ever happened. As Duskull can not effectively damage them, Duskull is left as set-up bait.</p> <p><strong>Clerics and Status Absorbers</strong>: Clerics and status absorbers such as Knock Off Lickitung and RestTalk Chinchou can completely shut Duskull down.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types are completely immune to Will-O-Wisp and can shut Duskull down. Ponyta and Larvesta can burn and heal with Morning Sun, while Pokemon like Houndour can easily trap Duskull with Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Pokemon such as Pawniard, Scraggy, and Mienfoo can use Knock Off to deal significant damage and remove Eviolite, rendering Duskull susceptible to being KOed.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Duskull's only form of somewhat reliable recovery comes in Pain Split, and while Duskull can take a few hits, its lack of recovery can really limit how long Duskull can last. Will-O-Wisp is Duskull's most reliable way of dealing damage; it can also cripple some sweepers and limit the potential of physical wallbreakers. Substitute allows Duskull to survive a few more turns and can be used for scouting. Shadow Sneak is Duskull's best way of attacking non-passively due to its priority and Duskull's lack of other decent options. This also helps deal damage to Pokemon such as Abra who could not be damaged by Duskull otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite helps Duskull take hits much better, the EV spread hits Eviolite numbers with a Careful nature. Levitate allows Duskull to avoid Earthquakes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp can be used to burn physical attackers, but you should try to avoid burning Pokemon with Guts such as Timburr. Try and use Substitute on obvious switches or when the opponent has no way to effectively damage Duskull. Substitute can also help to get off a more effective Pain Split. Knock Off is the bane of Duskull's existence, as it removes Duskull's item and does massive damage in the process.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can absorb Knock Off such as Mienfoo, Shellos, and Trubbish make for good teammates. Momentum-grabbing moves like U-turn and Volt Switch can effectively be used with Duskull and entry hazard setters. Duskull's niche is that as a Ghost-type, it can keep entry hazards on the field.</p>"

  "Wynaut": {
    "overview": "<p>Wynaut can be one of the most annoying Pokemon to fight against. With access to an amazing ability in Shadow Tag, great 95 / 48 / 48 defenses, and the ability to take down most threats with Mirror Coat and Counter, Wynaut is a solid Pokemon. Wynaut is a nice check to almost anything that lacks a super effective move against it. With Safeguard, it can also trap and counter slow walls such as Foongus, Lileep, and Slowpoke. Sadly, a solid part of the metagame can easily break through it, due to the abundance of Knock Off. However, Wynaut is still a great support Pokemon and a nice safety blanket against many Pokemon. Encore is also a great move in combination with Shadow Tag, and can greatly aid a teammate in setting up. Wynaut does a brilliant job in trapping and removing certain threats, while also helping teammates to switch in.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wynaut's movepool is incredibly small, only having access to eight moves. Tickle is a much better option than Charm, as it also lowers the opponents Defense. Splash is totally useless. Eviolite instead of Berry Juice as a item is really the only other option for Wynaut. However, this is rarely recommended as Berry Juice, in most situations, is much better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Mienfoo, Onix, and Stunky are a huge problem for Wynaut, and forces it to only use Counter and Mirror Coat.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types are immune to the effects of Shadow Tag this generation, and Ghost-types such as Gastly also OHKO Wynaut with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>U-turn and Volt Switch users</strong>: U-turn and Volt Switch users are a huge problem for Wynaut, because U-turn and Volt Switch ignore Shadow Tag. Wynaut can Counter / Mirror Coat the switch-in, however, Ghost-types and Dark-types are immune to Counter and Mirror Coat, respectively, giving threats such as Pawniard a free switch-in, both of which can also OHKO Wynaut with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Spritzee</strong>: Spritzee is immune to Encore due to its ability Aroma Veil, and can therefore use Wynaut as a setup bait.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Encore is used to lock opposing Pokemon into non-attacking moves such as Stealth Rock, Defog, or even setup moves such as Shell Smash and Swords Dance, giving a teammate the ability to get a free switch-in. Encore can also lock a foe into a attacking move, and Wynaut can then hit it hard back with either Counter or Mirror Coat. Counter and Mirror Coat are used to counter physical and special attacks respectively, dealing twice the damage Wynaut took back. Encore, Counter, and Mirror Coat are all mandatory moves for Wynaut. For the last slot, Wynaut has three options: Safeguard, Tickle, and Destiny Bond. Safeguard allows Wynaut to avoid Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Sleep-based moves such as Sleep Powder, and Spore, which otherwise would greatly hinder Wynaut. Tickle can be used in conjunction with Pursuit users or Diglett to trap a opponent and OHKO it with ease. Destiny Bond is a useful last ditch effort to take out another Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The following EV spread maximizes Wynaut's HP, totaling 49 with Berry Juice. This means that Wynaut is technically capable of dealing 96 damage to opponents before fainting. A Bold nature is chosen to absorb Fighting-types attacks more effectively. However, the Defense and Special Defense EVs can be customized to deal with specific threats. Wynaut also has the ability to Speed creep on many walls, depending on what threats you want to remove. 92 Speed EVs give it 10 Speed, allowing it to outspeed slower walls.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Encore on non-attacking moves such as Stealth Rock or setup moves such as Shell Smash, then switch out for free momentum. This also gives a teammate the ability to get a free turn to use a set up move on. Keep in mind that Spritzee isn't affected by Encore, so Spritzee can therefore use Wynaut as setup bait.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wynaut is a good choice if you have a frail setup team, and can reliably get rid of Choice Scarf users that lack a super effective move. Setup sweepers love the free turns Wynaut gives them by encoring a moves like Stealth Rock and Defog. Diglett or Pursuit users are very useful with Tickle, meaning the opponent is stuck using a move such as Stealth Rock and can easily end up having -6 Defense after being trapped by Wynaut. Volt Switch and U-turn users are fantastic partners as they can often give Wynaut a free switch in.</p>"

  "Snorunt": {
    "overview": "<p>Snorunt should be used as a suicide entry hazard lead. Snorunt is a good entry hazard setter because it can beat most entry hazard removers, especially Flying- and Ground-types, thanks to Ice Beam. However, it can't deal with Staryu. Snorunt has access to Ice Shard, which is helpful because of its priority. Snorunt's stats are mediocre; it's very weak and can't take many hits. In addition, it has a bad defensive typing, which means it can't survive for a long time during the match because it only resists Ice-type moves. This is very bad, as Fighting-types are on almost every team. Snorunt faces heavy competition from other Spikes users, such as Dwebble, Pineco, and Omanyte, as Omanyte has better typing and bulk, while Pineco and Dwebble have access to the Sturdy + Berry Juice combination, which increases their longevity.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Eviolite is a nice option to give Snorunt more bulk. Toxic can wear down bulky Pokemon such as Spritzee and setup sweepers that could threaten your team by putting them on a timer. Different types of Hidden Power, such as Hidden Power Rock for Larvesta and Hidden Power Grass for Water-types, can deal damage to different Pokemon and has to be chosen depending on the rest of your team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt prevents Snorunt from using Spikes, which is generally the main reason you'd use it in the first place. Mienfoo can use Taunt to prevent any Spikes from being set and then proceed to hit with a super effective Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Rapid Spin and Defog remove Spikes, which are the main selling point of using Snorunt at all. Staryu warrants a mention, as it resists Ice-type attacks and takes very little damage from Hidden Power Ground, while being able to use Rapid Spin or hit hard with Scald or Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Multi-Hit Moves</strong>: Multi-hit move users negate Focus Sash and thus may stop Snorunt from laying any Spikes. Shellder is guaranteed to break a Focus Sash and OHKO with Rock Blast.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Most setup sweepers, such as Corphish and Timburr, can take advantage of Snorunt due to either its average offensive presence or their type advantage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes is the main reason you would use Snorunt. Ice Beam is Snorunt's best STAB attack and is great because it pressures entry hazard removers such as Archen, Drilbur, and Vullaby. Hidden Power Ground is pretty weak, but allows it Snorunt to hit Steel-types and Chinchou when they are switched in. The two attacks have perfect neutral coverage outside of Surskit, but Snorunt's stats are still poor. Ice Shard is a useful priority attack, which lets Snorunt finish off weakened foes, especially Fast Eviolite Archen, after hitting them with Ice Beam.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Speed EVs with a Naive nature are recommended, as they allow Snorunt to outspeed standard Chinchou and Magnemite. 200 Special Attack EVs boost the power of Ice Beam, and 36 Defense and 40 Special Defense EVs provide some additional bulk, as they increase Snorunt's defenses from 11 to 12; lastly, 36 Attack EVs boost Ice Shard's damage output. Inner Focus allows Snorunt to avoid flinching, which is especially helpful against Fake Out users. Focus Sash guarantees at least one layer of Spikes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lead off with Snorunt most of the time in order to set up Spikes. Switch into Ground-types and Grass-types and attempt to force them out so Snorunt can set up layers Spikes for free. Getting up as many layers of Spikes as possible against teams lacking entry hazard removal can be very helpful. Snorunt can also KO many Defoggers and spinners, except for Staryu, because they're weak to Ice-type moves; as such, use your Ice-type STAB to KO them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf users, such as Mienfoo, Magnemite, and Chinchou, are great partners because they can use U-turn or Volt Switch against their checks and slowly wear them down in tandem with Spikes. They can also make use of Spikes late-game because they're able to sweep the opposing team. Ghost-types are good partners because they can block Rapid Spin. Wallbreakers such as Pancham, Skrelp, and Corphish enjoy having their switch-ins worn down by Spikes. Pawniard can help, as it discourages the use of Defog thanks to Defiant. Late-game sweepers such as Abra, Carvanha, and Bulk Up Timburr enjoy having the entry hazard support, and Snorunt can also occasionally beat Cottonee.</p>"

  "Clamperl": {
    "overview": "<p>Clamperl is a unique Pokemon thanks to its signature item, Deep Sea Tooth, which allows it to reach a shattering 34 Special Attack. On top of this, Clamperl has access to Shell Smash, which patches up its poor Speed and skyrockets its Special Attack stat. However, Clamperl's Speed stat is quite poor even when boosted, and Clamperl finds it hard to find an opportunity to set up in the first place. While Shell Smash provides Clamperl with immense offensive boosts, it comes with the negative side effect of lowering Clamperl's defenses, thus making it very vulnerable to priority. Clamperl faces stiff competition from Omanyte as a Shell Smash sweeper because Omanyte is less item-reliant, has a superior typing, and is also bulkier than Clamperl; however, Clamperl hits harder than Omanyte.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Clamperl really doesn't have many options other than the listed moves, as it has quite a tiny movepool. Hidden Power Electric hits Tentacool and Mantyke hard, but neither are common enough to make running it worth Clamperl's time. Running Rattled is a possibility, but Shell Armor is much more useful in nearly all cases. A defensively oriented set with Deep Sea Scale might sound viable on paper, but Clamperl lacks recovery moves and is better at fulfilling other roles, making it an unwise choice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Fletchling is the strongest priority user in the metagame and has an easy time KOing Clamperl after it uses Shell Smash, while Pawniard can KO Clamperl with Sucker Punch after a bit of prior damage. Fighting-types with access to priority, such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Croagunk, are also able to check Clamperl.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf users, such as Gastly and Doduo, are able to outspeed and KO Clamperl. Focus Sash Abra is another great revenge killer that always KOes Clamperl with Psychic after Shell Smash's Special Defense drop. Pokemon that take advantage of SturdyJuice, such as Magnemite and Tirtouga, can take a hit from Clamperl and KO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Not many bulky Pokemon bar Ferroseed and Munchlax care to switch into Clamperl, but most others are able to stomach a hit or two and either force it out or cripple it through various means, such as with status or phazing moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash is a seldom distributed move that instantly boosts Clamperl's Attack, Speed, and Special Attack stats by two stages each; these boosts, allow Clamperl to outspeed a large portion of the metagame and hit the majority of it extremely hard. Surf is Clamperl's strongest STAB option and is quite reliable, so it is often the most spammable move. Ice Beam nets nice coverage against Pokemon that resist Surf, such as Foongus, Croagunk, and Cottonee. Substitute lets Clamperl set up with more ease and allows it to avoid Sucker Punch from the likes of Pawniard; it also blocks Thunder Wave and other status-inflicting moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs are allocated into Special Attack and Speed for the highest sweeping potential; the Special Defense EVs give Clamperl one extra point in Special Defense. A Timid nature is used to outspeed key Choice Scarf users such as Mienfoo after a Shell Smash. Shell Armor is especially useful in Clamperl's case because it prevents critical hits from ruining its sweep; this is most often a problem when coming from priority. Deep Sea Tooth is Clamperl's signature item which doubles its Special Attack, making it even harder to switch into. It is important to note that no item, not even Eviolite, should ever be run over Deep Sea Tooth, as nothing provides equal or more benefits as it does.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Clamperl can be used at various times throughout the match; during early-game, it can fire powerful attacks to weaken threats for later in the game, while Clamperl can set up and pull off a sweep late-game. Clamperl should never set up recklessly, as it will almost always get only one opportunity to do so; for example, Clamperl could set up a Shell Smash when it is facing a potential Choice Scarf user, which could outspeed it even after a boost and thus waste Clamperl. Another example of this is setting up too early when bulkier walls can still stomach its hits and force it out. Finally, Clamperl should never set up until strong priority users, such as Pawniard and Fletchling, are KOed, as priority moves bypass Clamperl's Speed boosts.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clamperl requires a lot of team support to be able to sweep. Cottonee is able to support Clamperl by gaining momentum with Encore and easing setup with Memento; it also resists both of Clamperl's weaknesses and can take on Chinchou quite easily. Entry hazard support is crucial to wear down bulkier Pokemon so Clamperl can break through them; such support can come from Dwebble, Drilbur, and Archen. Foongus has good defensive synergy with Clamperl and can use Spore to pivot into Clamperl for an easier time setting up. Wynaut stands out as well for its ability to trap Choice Scarf users and KO them before they have a chance to revenge kill Clamperl. Entry hazard removal from Drilbur is appreciated, as Clamperl doesn't enjoy being worn down, because if it is worn down, it cannot survive priority attacks. Diglett can set Stealth Rock, trap Pawniard, and provide Memento support, making it a prime partner to Clamperl.</p>"

  "Bagon": {
    "overview": "<p>Bagon is blessed with a great ability in Sheer Force, boosting the power of moves with a secondary effect. It also has access to Dragon Dance and Hone Claws, two great setup moves that complement Sheer Force, and great coverage moves to take advantage of it as well. Bagon maxes out at 18 Attack, equaling prominent threats such as Timburr and Jolly Pawniard. There are several negative qualities about Bagon, however. It has mediocre Speed and defenses, and requires turns to set up to be useful. Lastly, it is forced out by Fairies with no way of dealing any reasonable damage to them, which is detrimental to its use.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There are a few other options for Bagon. It can run a specially based set with Hydro Pump, Dragon Breath / Draco Meteor, Fire Blast, and a Hidden Power. A support set consisting of Wish / Protect / Dragon Claw / Toxic is also viable. Rock Head can be used in tandem with Double-Edge on an alternative Dragon Dance set. Brick Break can be used to deal with Steel-types such as Aron and Pawniard. Finally, Hone Claws can be used as Sheer Force helps with the inaccurate moves, but Bagon does not have enough Speed or bulk to pull this off effectively. Dragon Rush works especially well in tandem with Sheer Force, Life Orb, and Hone Claws.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Spritzee always forces a switch, unless it is at low health. Cottonee can come in and Encore either Dragon Dance or Dragon Claw to force a switch. They can also hit Bagon with Dazzling Gleam for super effective damage.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types such as Choice Scarf Snover and Smoochum can easily come in and KO Bagon, provided it hasn't set up a Dragon Dance yet. Bear in mind that they only check Bagon, as a Rock Slide or Fire Fang will KO with a boost.</p> <p><strong>Steel- and Rock-types</strong>: Shieldon and Aron take little damage even from boosted attacks, so they can force a switch and can set up Stealth Rock in the process.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: All forms of status hinder Bagon. Poison whittles it down and can cut short a sweep, paralysis renders its Speed boosts useless, and a burn halves its Attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance is the move of choice to set up and sweep, allowing Bagon to outspeed many threats and gain an Attack boost. Dragon Claw is the preferred STAB move for this set, but it is not boosted by Sheer Force and causes Bagon to take recoil damage from Life Orb. Rock Slide is a great coverage move that deals with Flying- and Fire-types such as Vullaby, Fletchling, Archen, Ponyta, Larvesta, and Houndour. Zen Headbutt hits Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr and Poison-types such as Koffing, Grimer, and Trubbish super effectively. Fire Fang allows Bagon to hit Bug-, Steel-, and Grass-types including Cottonee, which otherwise beats it, while Crunch is for handling Ghost-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment is preferred to hit as hard as possible, and 196 Speed EVs allow Bagon to outspeed the whole unboosted tier. An Adamant nature allows it to hit extra hard while still being able to reach 21 Speed at +1. Life Orb allows Bagon to hit hard without taking damage thanks to Sheer Force, while Eviolite gives it some bulk and improves its longevity. Keep in mind that Eviolite gives Bagon less offensive prowess and may leave it underwhelming damage-wise.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bagon appreciates entry hazards to get past pesky Sturdy + Berry Juice users or other Pokemon with Sturdy that can stop a sweep in its tracks. A slow pivot such as Magnemite works well with Bagon, as Volt Switch allows it to get into battle unscathed. Setting up on a support Pokemon is recommended, as a Dragon Dance boost or two is crucial for Bagon to outspeed threats and improve its sweeping capabilities. Fairy-types should also be eliminated before setting up, as they stop Bagon dead in its tracks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As far as team options go, Bagon needs lots of support. Bagon appreciates entry hazards to KO threats that would otherwise survive an attack, especially Sturdy users. Ferroseed makes a great teammate, as it takes hits for Bagon very well and can also set up entry hazards. Staryu is a good specially based spinner which ensures that Bagon's HP isn't whittled down by entry hazards. Bagon still struggles against Spritzee, so it appreciates a teammate like Pawniard or Croagunk to take care of it. Pawniard also can also deter the use of Defog and gets rid of threats like Fletchling for Bagon.</p>"

  "Turtwig": {
    "overview": "<p>Turtwig has a distinct niche in Little Cup with its great defensive stats, pure Grass typing, and access to Stealth Rock. It has a good matchup against a variety of spinners such as Drilbur and Staryu, allowing it to keep entry hazards up against a variety of teams. Turtwig also has access to reliable recovery in Synthesis, which lets it stay healthy enough to switch into threats throughout the match. However, Turtwig has a bad defensive typing with weaknesses to common types such as Fire, Flying, Poison, and Ice. It is also extremely slow, being outsped by most of the metagame, and struggles against common Defoggers such as Vullaby and Stunky, as it has no way to deal sufficient damage to them. A limited offensive movepool makes Turtwig very passive, meaning it struggles against many Pokemon it can't hit for super effective damage and gives them many opportunities to set up. Finally, Turtwig faces competition from other Stealth Rock setters and is hopelessly outclassed at any other roles it could try.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used to deal with bulky Pokemon such as Vullaby but leaves Turtwig walled by Steel-types. Turtwig can set up with Curse or Swords Dance; however, its typing, Speed, and bad offensive movepool prevent it from excelling at these roles. Leech Seed can also be used to wear down common switch-ins, but it doesn't heal a large enough amount of damage to warrant its use, leaving Turtwig as setup bait. Finally, Turtwig can set dual screens, but this is a mediocre strategy in LC, and Turtwig is outclassed by Snivy at this role.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Almost every Taunt user, such as bulky Mienfoo, outspeeds Turtwig and can prevent it from filling its role.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Most setup sweepers not weak to one of Turtwig's coverage moves, such as Bulk Up Timburr, can take advantage of its passivity and use it as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Drifloon, Vullaby, and Fletching can all 2HKO Turtwig with their Flying STAB moves and also set up on it or use U-turn to grab momentum.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Ponyta and Larvesta can OHKO Turtwig with their offensive attacks or cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Larvesta can also use U-turn to build momentum. These two are particularly threatening because they can cripple whatever you switch in on them with status.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Croagunk and Skrelp in particular OHKO Turtwig, while Foongus can defeat it easily. Gastly is also a big offensive threat but dislikes taking a Crunch on the switch. These can all force out Turtwig due to their powerful coverage and the fact that Turtwig won't have a good way to reliably hit them.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Shellder can spin away entry hazards and OHKO Turtwig with Ice-type moves, even without Shell Smash. Other Pokemon that Turtwig would usually switch into, such as Chinchou, may also carry Ice-type moves, which can swiftly KO Turtwig.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is an incredibly useful move that punishes the opponent for switching. Synthesis reliably heals Turtwig, letting it stay healthy to switch into threats and set Stealth Rock multiple times if need be. Bullet Seed is a mandatory STAB move and can break through Focus Sashes and Sturdy. Superpower deals with Steel-types that switch in, OHKOing Pawniard and Magnemite after Stealth Rock and dealing a large amount of damage to Ferroseed and Porygon. However, the Attack and Defense drops severely weaken Turtwig afterwards and may force it to switch out. Crunch can also be used as a coverage option to hit Drifloon hard and threaten Gastly on the switch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Eviolite coupled with the given EVs and a Careful nature gives Turtwig respectable 22 / 24 / 24 bulk, which allows it to switch into resisted hits repeatedly. The Speed EVs let Turtwig hit 10 Speed, which allows it to outspeed Pokemon like Spritzee and bulky Tirtouga and Speed tie with Timburr, defensive Porygon, and Hippopotas. Overgrow can punish the foe with stronger Grass-type attacks if Turtwig is weakened.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Set up Stealth Rock as quickly as possible, as it is more effective the more the foe switches in on it. Use Synthesis when needed, but be wary of its low PP, as it is your only way of healing Turtwig. Once Turtwig's role is done, it can happily switch into resisted hits from Pokemon like Chinchou and Drilbur. Be wary of using Superpower unnecessarily, as it will significantly weaken Turtwig both offensively and defensively and potentially force it to switch. Also, be wary of switching into Scald, as Turtwig hates getting burned.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vullaby is a very good teammate, as it can switch into and defeat Foongus, which defeats Turtwig. In return, Turtwig can check Electric-types such as Chinchou and Magnemite for Vullaby. Turtwig helps Pokemon that appreciate entry hazards up such as Carvanha and Abra to OHKO certain Pokemon due to Stealth Rock's chip damage. Pokemon that want a good switch-in to Water-types, like Fire-types such as Ponyta, also appreciate Turtwig. Poison-types such as Croagunk and Skrelp are good partners because they can switch into Poison-type moves aimed at Turtwig. In return, Turtwig can take resisted Ground-type moves. Steel-types such as Magnemite also appreciate Turtwig switching into Ground-type attacks and can switch into Flying- and, situationally, Poison-types for Turtwig. Electric-types like Magnemite and Chinchou also beat Flying-types with their Electric-type STAB moves. These also appreciate Turtwig shielding them from Ground-type moves. Water-types can switch into Fire- and Ice-type attacks, although some, like Tirtouga, can't afford to switch into Will-O-Wisp. Chinchou and Shellder are good partners due to them also defeating Flying-types with their other coverage moves. Staryu, Skrelp, Tirtouga, and Omanyte all appreciate Turtwig's defensive typing and bulk, which let it switch into many of their threats. RestTalk Skrelp in particular is a great option, as Turtwig takes out Ground-types for it while Skrelp deals extremely well with Fire-types. Munchlax is another option, as it deals with Drifloon and Ponyta for Turtwig.</p>"

  "Chimchar": {
    "overview": "<p>Chimchar is one of only two Fire-type Pokemon in Little Cup with access to Stealth Rock. It also has access to many other moves that make it a great lead, such as Fake Out, Taunt, Encore, and U-turn. Unfortunately, its average Speed stat prevents it from utilizing these moves effectively, as it is unable to outspeed many prominent leads in LC. Chimchar is also a poor Stealth Rock user, as although it is able to set up the entry hazard, it loses to all common Rapid Spin users and is shut down by most leads that are faster than it. Chimchar does have decent Attack and Special Attack, along with some great boosting moves in Swords Dance, Nasty Plot, and Bulk Up, but a combination of low Speed, a barren attacking movepool, and below-average bulk prevent it from being a viable offensive threat, particularly as it is outclassed as an offensive Fire-type by Ponyta, Larvesta, and Vulpix.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Chimchar has access to Bulk Up, Swords Dance, and Nasty Plot, but its shortage of moves and its poor Speed prevent it from sweeping. It can use Vacuum Wave with a complementary Hidden Power type, but it doesn't get STAB on Vacuum Wave and is mostly outclassed by Croagunk in this regard. Chimchar can opt for a bulkier set with Eviolite and Slack Off, but there is little reason to use it over Ponyta or Larvesta, as they are bulkier and also have access to recovery. Some of Chimchar's physical options include Gunk Shot, Fire Punch, and Thunder Punch. Gunk Shot has a good chance to 2HKO Spritzee, while both Fire Punch and Thunder Punch receive a boost from Iron Fist. Chimchar can use U-turn to gain momentum after setting up Stealth Rock, but it has little use afterwards. Endeavor can be used as it synergizes well with Focus Sash; however, Venipede uses the move far more consistently as a lead. If Fire Blast's accuracy is too dicey for you, then Flamethrower is an alternative, although it cannot KO Dwebble after Fake Out.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Chimchar fails to beat the two most common spinners in the tier, Drilbur and Staryu. Both outspeed and bring Chimchar down to its Focus Sash with their STAB moves and can finish it off with Rapid Spin, which will also remove the Stealth Rock Chimchar set up. Defog users, particularly Archen and Vullaby, can switch in easily and undo Chimchar's work.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Common Taunt users, particularly leads such as Mienfoo and Onix, can prevent Chimchar from setting up Stealth Rock, rendering it mostly useless.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Onix, Tirtouga, and Archen aren't troubled at all by Chimchar. Onix can outspeed and OHKO Chimchar through its Focus Sash with three Rock Blast hits, Tirtouga can 2HKO Chimchar with Waterfall and Aqua Jet, and Archen can use Defog to remove Chimchar's Stealth Rock while 2HKOing it with Earthquake. If Chimchar loses the Speed tie against Dwebble, it will also go down to Rock Blast if it hits three times.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Chimchar is a moderately fast Stealth Rock user that can setup the hazard consistently. Both Taunt and Encore prevent Chimchar from becoming set up bait: Taunt can prevent a slower lead from setting up entry hazards or attempting to boost, whereas Encore can lock an opponent into a move, thereby giving a free switch to one of Chimchar's teammates. Fake Out allows Chimchar to negate an opponent's Sturdy or Focus Sash, especially those of common leads such as Dwebble and Onix. Overheat is a strong Fire-type STAB move that guarantees the OHKO on Dwebble after a Fake Out. It can also do heavy damage to foes that don't resist it, especially if Chimchar is brought down to Blaze range. Fire Blast is a weaker alternative to Overheat that doesn't lower Chimchar's Special Attack stat; however, it will likely not KO Dwebble after a Fake Out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>188 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Chimchar to reach 16 Speed, letting it Speed tie with Dwebble. A Timid nature is chosen over Hasty or Naive, as Fake Out's purpose isn't to deal a lot of damage, but simply to break Sturdy and Focus Sash, meaning an Attack-reducing nature isn't detrimental. 212 Special Attack EVs allow for Chimchar's Fire-type attack to hit harder, while the remaining EVs are invested in bulk; they give an additional point in HP and Special Defense and two in Defense, allowing Chimchar to take a Knock Off and Drain Punch from Mienfoo. A Focus Sash typically guarantees Chimchar either setting up Stealth Rock or firing off an attack, if the opponent doesn't have a multi-hit move such as Rock Blast. It also works well in tandem with Blaze, which upon activation makes Chimchar's STAB moves even stronger.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Chimchar's job is to set up Stealth Rock and deal damage to an opposing lead with Fake Out, a job it can only do successfully if it is used early-game, particularly as a lead. Avoid leading with Chimchar if your opponent has a lead like Onix or Mienfoo, as they are faster and can prevent Chimchar from setting hazards with Taunt. If the opponent is slower than Chimchar, then Chimchar will be able to use Taunt or Encore effectively, preventing an opponent from setting up entry hazards or boosting. A Fire-type attack from Chimchar can severely dent a frailer opponent, particularly if Chimchar has been brought down to Blaze thanks to Focus Sash.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A spinblocker such as Pumpkaboo can prevent Chimchar's Stealth Rock from being removed. Pumpkaboo synergizes quite well with Chimchar, as Chimchar loses to Staryu and Drilbur, the metagame's most common spinners, while Pumpkaboo usually beats both of these threats. Cottonee is also able to beat both of these spinners or Encore them into Rapid Spin, in addition to beating most of the leads that Chimchar struggles with. Pawniard does not prevent the removal of entry hazards, but it does punish Defog users, most of which beat Chimchar, by receiving a Defiant boost from it. Other fast, hard-hitting Pokemon appreciate having Stealth Rock up, as it softens opposing teams, and also breaks Sturdy in Pokemon such as Tirtouga and Magnemite.</p>"

  "Starly": {
    "overview": "<p>Starly's great ability, Reckless, coupled with strong STAB moves boosted by it in Brave Bird and Double-Edge, allows it to quickly punch holes in the opposing team. However, that is Starly's only niche, as its reliance on recoil moves to do damage quickly wears it down. It also needs Choice Scarf to function effectively because it's slow and frail, but without a boosting item it lacks the power to defeat bulkier Pokemon. Also, most teams contain Fletchling checks, which also check Starly. Finally, Starly is outclassed by most other offensive Flying-types, including Fletchling, Doduo, and Archen.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With Choice Scarf, Starly's Endeavor will nearly always go first, letting it deal a lot of damage to an opposing Pokemon when it's low on health, but Starly isn't able to switch moves at the crucial time to properly cripple foes with Endeavor. Choice Band or Life Orb can be used for more power; however, Starly is too slow to use them because its low Speed means that it must take hits, which hamper its ability to sweep because it uses recoil moves to deal damage. Sleep Talk can be used to allow Starly to act as a pseudo-sleep absorber and fire off random moves, though its circumstantiality makes it unreliable.</p> <p>Revenge hits Steel- and Rock-types hard, but it has negative priority, so Starly will be open to taking hits. Pursuit can be used to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively, but it's weak, and U-turn gains more momentum on a switching foe anyway. Thief is more powerful than Pursuit and can steal an enemy's item, though most Pokemon can KO Starly with Knock Off already. Quick Attack can help in a pinch against foes on their last legs, as Starly will usually outprioritize opposing Pokemon due to its Choice Scarf, but it is weak and otherwise useless. Hidden Power Fighting can be used to hit Pawniard and other Steel-types, but it has no function outside of this, and Hidden Power Grass is usually better for hitting Rock-types. Hidden Power Ground and Heat Wave are super effective against Pokemon that resist Brave Bird, but other special options are usually better, and Heat Wave is incompatible with Reckless.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types resist both of Starly's STAB moves in addition to everything listed on the main set. Pawniard has priority in Sucker Punch and can Knock Off Starly's Choice Scarf, Magnemite 4x resists Brave Bird and can punish Starly with a super effective Electric-type move, and Ferroseed can set Stealth Rock while dealing recoil damage to Starly with Iron Barbs.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Because it is so frail, a weakened Starly is easily KOed by priority attacks, which bypass its Choice Scarf. Examples of strong priority moves are Zigzagoon's Extreme Speed, Fletchling's Acrobatics, Pawniard's Sucker Punch, and Carvanha's Aqua Jet, all of which can outprioritize and KO Starly after some prior damage; Acrobatics and Sucker Punch even have a chance to OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Archen, Dwebble, and Tirtouga resist both of Starly's STAB moves and can hit back with super effective STAB moves. Starly can punish most of them with Hidden Power Grass or Steel Wing, though.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Starly is unable to break through certain Pokemon, such as Vullaby, Snubbull, and Porygon, that invest in Defense and are not weak to Brave Bird. Additionally, even some Pokemon weak to Brave Bird can avoid the OHKO and hit Starly back hard.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird and Double-Edge are strong STAB moves that are boosted by Reckless. U-turn allows Starly to escape unfavorable matchups and can also be used to scout switch-ins and generate momentum; it is also the only reason to use Starly over Doduo, which has better all-around stats and access to Knock Off. The last move should be one that, while not great to be locked into, can be helpful in certain situations. Hidden Power Grass hits Tirtouga and most other Rock-types for lots of damage; it is used because Starly's other options bar Steel Wing are not very effective against Rock-types, and Tirtouga takes neutral damage from Steel Wing. Steel Wing is also generally less effective than Hidden Power Grass because Rock-types are usually physically bulky; however, Steel Wing does still hit Archen.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Reckless is the only ability of any use, boosting Brave Bird and Double-Edge to frightening levels of power. Choice Scarf lets Starly move first most of the time, allowing it to punch holes in the opposing team or quickly U-turn out. A Speed-boosting nature is used to maximize the effects of Choice Scarf. Use a Naive nature if using Hidden Power Grass and a Jolly nature if not. Attack-boosting natures can be used for more power, but Starly will be outsped by Jolly Choice Scarf Cranidos and Bunnelby, as well as Modest Clamperl and Jolly Tirtouga after Shell Smash, all of which can easily KO it. The EVs maximize Speed and Attack while slightly increasing HP and Special Attack to accommodate the use of recoil moves and Hidden Power Grass, respectively. If using a physical coverage move and a Jolly nature, move the 36 Special Attack EVs to Defense so that Starly takes less damage from priority moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Starly can be brought in at any time in the game, provided it is safe to do so, but try to bring it in late-game as a suicidal cleaner when all of its checks are gone. Because it's so frail, bring it in through slow pivoting moves, such as Volt Switch from Chinchou or U-turn from Mienfoo, or into a predicted Ground- or Ghost-type move so that it doesn't take damage. Don't switch Starly into Stealth Rock too many times, as it will quickly be worn down. Starly is also not a good wallbreaker, so don't play it as one.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock removers such as Drilbur, Archen, and Staryu are a must, as they prevent a quarter of Starly's health from being stripped off every time it enters the field. Ground-types such as Drilbur and Diglett can get rid of the Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon that resist Starly's STAB moves. Drilbur can also Rapid Spin away Stealth Rock, while Diglett can trap grounded Pokemon that trouble Starly. Starly can be used in a VoltTurn core with pivots such as Chinchou, Larvesta, Magnemite, and Mienfoo, or in a bird spam core with other Flying-types, such as Fletchling, Doduo, and Archen. Finally, entry hazards from setters such as Dwebble and Drilbur can help Starly clean up late-game.</p>"

  "Bidoof": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite having access to two great abilities in Simple and Unaware, Bidoof struggles to find a niche in LC over better setup sweepers such as Timburr. The reasons for this lie in Bidoof's low stats, which require it to invest heavily in bulk, thus leaving it weak even after setting up, and its uninspired typing that leaves it weak to LC's myriad of Fighting-types. Its primary boosting move, Curse, has the side effect of lowering Bidoof's Speed, meaning that it will often have to take two attacks before dealing any damage. Despite its many flaws, Simple is still an amazing ability that allows Bidoof to double its Attack and Defense in a single turn with Curse. Bidoof's Normal typing, while mediocre defensively, provides it with a powerful, reliable STAB with good neutral coverage in Return. Bidoof also has access to STAB Quick Attack to circumvent Curse's Speed drop, as well as decent coverage moves to hit Pokemon that resist Normal.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A defensive Unaware set making use of Bidoof's decent support movepool consisting of moves such as Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave is useable, but Bidoof's poor defensive typing, its lack of recovery, and the fact that it loses to Timburr, the most common setup sweeper in LC, hold this set back tremendously. A special attacking set making use of either Charge Beam or Work Up and Bidoof's good special movepool could be used, but Bidoof's low Special Attack and Speed make it worse than the Curse set. Amnesia could be used in tandem with Curse to let Bidoof boost both its Defense and Special Defense, but it's hard to find a moveslot for it. Superpower gets excellent coverage alongside Return, but the stat drops that Superpower causes do not go well with Simple. Facade allows Bidoof to benefit from burns that normally cripple it, but it is weaker than Return if Bidoof is not statused.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: LC's ever-present Fighting-types are by far the biggest threat to Bidoof, all of which are capable of OHKOing it with their STAB attacks. Mienfoo can use Taunt to prevent Bidoof from setting up, Croagunk can target its unboosted Special Defense with a powerful Sludge Bomb or Focus Blast, and Timburr, Pancham, and Scraggy can all set up alongside it.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types are immune to Bidoof's STAB attacks. Gastly can do serious damage to it with its powerful Sludge Bomb, while Pumpkaboo-Super resists Aqua Tail and can burn Bidoof with Will-O-Wisp. They must watch out for a boosted Thief, however.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Pawniard and Ferroseed resist Bidoof's STAB moves, take little from its coverage options, and can threaten it with a powerful Knock Off or put it on a timer with Leech Seed, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers such as Skrelp and Snivy can do large amounts of damage to Bidoof, often leaving it unable to sweep even if they do not OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Utility Moves</strong>: Taunt and Encore prevent Bidoof from setting up, making it deadweight. Burns from Will-O-Wisp drastically reduce Bidoof's damage output, and residual damage from the likes of Toxic and Leech Seed wears it down.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Curse in tandem with Simple allows Bidoof to reach a respectable 24 Attack and 22 Defense with a single turn of setup. Return is a powerful and reliable STAB attack that is also Bidoof's most powerful attack, and Quick Attack is a STAB priority move that helps mitigate Curse's Speed drop. Aqua Tail hits Pawniard neutrally as well as Rock-types such as Archen super effectively and provides the best overall coverage alongside Bidoof's STAB attacks. Thief hits Ghost-types super effectively and can steal the foe's item, which can be useful after Bidoof consumes its Berry Juice or loses its Eviolite to Knock Off.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and nature optimize Bidoof's special bulk, with the remaining EVs used to slightly increase its other stats. Simple is Bidoof's biggest niche, allowing it to boost its Attack and Defense twice as fast as other bulky boosting sweepers such as Timburr. Berry Juice gives Bidoof increased longevity and synergizes well with Thief, while Eviolite provides a significant increase to Bidoof's bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bidoof is most effective when it is saved until late-game; even when boosted, it is not particularly powerful, and it needs the opposing team to be worn down in order to sweep effectively. Bidoof has the easiest time setting up versus slow, bulky physical attackers such as Snubbull and Munchlax. When facing such Pokemon, use Return to hit them harder; when facing frailer but stronger Pokemon such as Elekid, use Quick Attack to work around Bidoof's low Speed. If Bidoof is running Thief, use it to hit Ghost-types such as Gastly and Pumpkaboo-Super and to steal items after Bidoof's Berry Juice has been consumed or its Eviolite Knocked Off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gothita can trap and eliminate the Fighting-types that would otherwise completely shut Bidoof down. In a similar vein, Fighting-type checks such as Spritzee also make great teammates. Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta check Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Pumpkaboo-Super which otherwise wall Bidoof. Entry hazard setters, particularly Spikes users such as Dwebble, are also good teammates, as the chip damage that entry hazards provide make it easier for Bidoof to get KOs. Finally, strong attackers such as Corphish and Gastly can wear down the opponent's team for Bidoof so that it has an easier time sweeping.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Shinx is the only Pokemon in Little Cup with access to Intimidate and a pivoting move, giving it a niche as a physically defensive pivot. Thanks to Intimidate and its Electric typing, it is also an incredibly reliable counter to Fletchling and other Flying-types. Pure Electric typing is a mixed bag for Shinx; it is only weak to one type, but it only resists three. Shinx's poor base stats and sparse movepool leave it unable to do anything outside of its specific niche, and it faces heavy competition from most other Electric-types. Shinx is additionally hindered by its lack of recovery moves, forcing it to use Berry Juice in order to repeatedly fill its niche.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If you dislike recoil, you could run Spark over Wild Charge; however, Shinx is incredibly weak and Spark misses out on many important KOs. Thief can also be replaced by Ice or Fire Fang for better attacking coverage. Specifically, Ice Fang helps Shinx not be totally demolished by Diglett, and Fire Fang does good damage against Ferroseed and Snover; however, the damage is so pitiful in other cases that Volt Switching out would almost always be a better option. Replacing Thief would also remove much of Shinx's staying power and utility. If you'd like to mix up the set, Shinx has access to Guts and can thus perform decently as a status absorber, but this set is generally outclassed by Timburr. Finally, Shinx can hit 17 Attack and 14 Speed and has access to a pivoting move; as such, it can somewhat viably run a Choice Scarf set. However, its attacks have low Base Power and shallow coverage, leaving it generally outclassed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Diglett</strong>: Unlike against most Pokemon, Diglett can easily switch into Shinx; due to Arena Trap, Shinx will be unable to switch out and will be KOed.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Electric</strong>: Electric immune Pokemon are unaffected by Thunder Wave, Volt Switch, and Wild Charge, making them excellent Shinx counters. Additionally, Ground-types such as Drilbur can OHKO Shinx even through Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers don't mind Intimidate and can thus exploit Shinx's poor Special Defense; this issue is augmented when using Berry Juice Shinx. Magnemite is particularly dangerous due to its Electric resistance and immunity to Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Shinx is easily switched into, and anything with recovery easily deals with it, especially Timburr, which benefits from Thunder Wave and Toxic due to Guts and sets up on Shinx. Shinx also struggles with Porygon and other particularly bulky Pokemon, which don't really mind anything Shinx throws at them.</p>",

Volt Switch is only present for pivoting purposes and is very weak due to negative investment. Toxic cripples bulky switch-ins that don't mind its Electric-type attacks, while Thunder Wave potentially cripples fast switch-ins, though Thunder Wave is generally less useful than Toxic.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs provided maximize Shinx's HP and Defense in order to take advantage of Intimidate as much as possible. 0 Speed IVs and a negative nature help Shinx function better as a pivot, as it underspeeds a majority of other pivots and thus can switch after the foe. Berry Juice provides Shinx with the recovery it otherwise lacks; Eviolite is somewhat redundant due to Intimidate but also boosts Shinx's Special Defense, though the longevity Berry Juice provides is generally more useful.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Shinx's job is to beat physical attackers, specifically Flying-types such as Fletchling. As such, switch it in on Flying-types as often as possible. However, be careful of Pokemon that may carry super effective coverage moves, such as Earthquake Archen. Additionally, you must play incredibly carefully when facing a team that features Diglett, as a Fletchling U-turn into it will spell instant doom for Shinx. Try to use Intimidate as much as possible while being aware of Pawniard, which will gain a Defiant boost in the event of a predicted switch. Finally, remember to make good use of Thief, as it provides Shinx with an opportunity to steal an item to heal itself or an opportunity to gain additional bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Shinx is completely ineffective against Ground-, Grass-, and Electric-types such as Drilbur and Chinchou, aside from being able to hit them with Toxic. Bulky Grass-types such as Foongus and Eviolite Snover form strong defensive cores with Shinx by beating those Ground-, Grass-, and Electric-types, and Shinx returns the favor by eliminating the Flying-types that hurt them. Because Shinx can remove Flying-types, it pairs well offensively with bulky Fighting-types such as Timburr; these teammates provide insurance against Pawniard should your opponent make a crafty double switch. Finally, anything that values Intimidate support — specifically, setup sweepers — can benefit from Shinx's utility. For example, Snivy is a bit frail physically, and thus enjoys Shinx's support; it also forms a Shinx / Grass-type core like the ones mentioned above.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Shieldon's access to the Sturdy + Berry Juice combination, great bulk, and resistances carve it a niche as a reliable Stealth Rock setter in the Little Cup metagame. While Shieldon's typing grants it notable resistances such as a 4x resistance against Flying, it also curses Shieldon with crippling 4x weaknesses to common types in Fighting and Ground. This, combined with its low offensive presence and speed, leaves Shieldon struggling to find a slot on most teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shieldon can use Metal Burst to take a hit from full health and OHKO the attacker. Toxic can be used to wear down bulky Pokemon, as Shieldon cannot threaten them with its attacks. Iron Head is a more consistent STAB option, but it doesn't 2HKO Spritzee. Shieldon has a good special movepool that includes Fire Blast, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt, though they usually provide less utility than the moves listed. An Eviolite set is possible, but Shieldon's lack of reliable recovery means it will be worn down very quickly. If Shieldon uses Magnet Rise, it will have the ability to beat Diglett 1v1 if Shieldon has Sturdy intact.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Almost every Fighting-type can easily switch in and OHKO Shieldon if Sturdy is broken. Mienfoo, Scraggy, Timburr, and Croagunk can Knock Off Berry Juice to prevent recovery.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: See above, except with Ground-types. Diglett and Drilbur deserve special mentions for trapping it and having Mold Breaker to negate Sturdy, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Hazard Prevention</strong>: Drilbur and Staryu can both force it out and spin away Stealth Rock. Taunt users such as Mienfoo can also prevent Shieldon from setting up Stealth Rock and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>: Pretty much anything with a Fighting-, Ground-, or STAB Water-type attack can deal with Shieldon once Sturdy is broken.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shieldon's bulk and resistances, as well as Sturdy, allow it to reliably set up Stealth Rock. Heavy Slam is a STAB attack that is decently powerful against most of the tier, given Shieldon's high weight; unlike Iron Head, it always 2HKOes Spritzee, one of the main Pokemon Shieldon is called on to check. Rock Blast is used as a secondary STAB move, and is notably super effective against the most common Defog users, Archen and Vullaby. The last move is mainly filler; Earthquake provides coverage on Steel-types such as Pawniard, while Roar can phaze setup sweepers attempting to take advantage of Shieldon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sturdy and Berry Juice are obvious choices, ensuring that Shieldon takes at least two hits before going down. The EVs on this set allow Shieldon to hit 21 HP for optimized recovery from Berry Juice, with most of the remaining EVs invested in Shieldon's defenses, as investing heavily in its meager offenses or Speed is wasteful.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Take advantage of Sturdy + Berry Juice to set up Stealth Rock as soon as possible, as this should be Shieldon's first priority. However, sacrificing Shieldon may not be wise if you rely on Shieldon to wall something on the opposing team, such as Fletchling.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ghost-types such as Frillish are not only able to spinblock for Shieldon, but are also immune to Fighting, though they will have trouble switching into Fighting-types due to Knock Off. Rapid Spin support is a good option to preserve Shieldon's Sturdy, and Drilbur and Staryu are the most notable spinners in the tier. Foongus and Cottonee have great synergy with Shieldon, being able to switch in on Shieldon's biggest counter in Drilbur, while Shieldon takes on Flying-types for them. Shieldon forms a decent defensive core with Spritzee. Eviolite is a viable item choice if Shieldon is used in this core, as Spritzee provides Wish support for it.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Buizel finds a niche as one of the few Pokemon in Little Cup to hit 19 Speed. Buizel has access to STAB priority in Aqua Jet, which is decently powerful coming off of its sizable 16 Attack. Buizel is also one of only four Pokemon in Little Cup with access to Water Veil, which prevents Buizel from being burned and consequently having its Attack cut. However, this is where Buizel's positive qualities come to an end. Buizel is very frail, and its frailty is augmented by Life Orb recoil. Buizel's coverage options are subpar at best, and it lacks any way to hit Water-types for significant damage. Additionally, Buizel finds competition from Corphish as a physical Water-type attacker, because Corphish has superior defensive stats, a better movepool, and Adaptability-boosted Water-type attacks. The only reason to use Buizel over Corphish is for the much higher Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Buizel can viably run a specially offensive set utilizing Hydro Pump and Ice Beam in conjunction with a Life Orb or Choice Specs. This allows Buizel to gain great coverage through Hidden Power while also taking advantage of a generally physically defensive metagame. Buizel can viably make use of Substitute and Focus Punch to run a SubPunch set, which is capable of OHKOing Porygon and Ferroseed after prior Stealth Rock damage. Buizel also has access to Switcheroo, allowing it to run Choice Band to both increase its damage output and cripple walls by limiting them to one move. Iron Tail 2HKOes Snubbull and Spritzee; however, it is generally less useful than Brick Break or Pursuit. Finally, Buizel can run a Bulk Up set and has access to Baton Pass to pass its boosts to a teammate; however, it is completely outclassed as a Bulk Up sweeper by Timburr and as a Bulk Up passer by Mienfoo. In can also pass Agility, but doing so would require Buizel to be a dedicated Baton Passer, something better done by Torchic. Alternatively, Buizel can opt to just run Baton Pass, in order to pivot out of unfavorable switch-ins and retain momentum.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Buizel has no way to hit Water-type Pokemon for any significant damage. Chinchou, perhaps the most common one, also possesses a super effective secondary STAB to threaten Buizel.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Buizel lacks the power to break through bulkier walls such as Porygon and Ferroseed. Due to Buizel's low defenses, it is unable to beat these Pokemon without dying to their attacks first.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Because Buizel is very frail, it isn't hard to pick off after a few rounds of Life Orb damage. Strong priority and Choice Scarf users, such as Fletchling and Gothita, can beat Buizel without too much trouble.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Aqua Tail is Buizel's strongest physical STAB attack, but only has 90% accuracy. Waterfall is often preferred for its reliable 100% accuracy, but comes with a noticeable drop in power. Ice Punch hits Grass- and Dragon-types super effectively, most notably 2HKOing Foongus and Cottonee. Brick Break punishes Pawniard, Ferroseed, and Porygon, but just falls short of 2HKOing Ferroseed. This option is best run in tandem with Spikes support. Alternatively, Pursuit allows Buizel to revenge kill Gastly without fail. Aqua Jet provides valuable priority, allowing Buizel to pick off weakened foes such as Abra.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb raises Buizel's damage output dramatically and makes it a threatening attacker. The given EVs maximize Attack and Speed, with the remainder put into Special Defense, as it is the only remaining stat that can be boosted with 36 EVs. A Jolly nature maximizes Speed, allowing you to outspeed dangerous Pokemon such as Gastly and tie with others such as Abra.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Buizel's high speed and access to priority makes it a fantastic revenge killer. Buizel has very poor bulk with Life Orb and should not be switched into any remotely strong attack; this further emphasizes its role as a revenge killer. Buizel can be switched in on Will-O-Wisp thanks to Water Veil, but is open to punishment from common Pokemon that carry the move, such as Ponyta's Wild Charge. Additionally, be aware that Buizel has no real way to beat Water-types, and is actually at a disadvantage against common ones such as Chinchou. As such, staying in on Water-types is not advised.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Buizel can't get around Water-types, so a Grass-type teammate such as Foongus or Ferroseed is valuable. These two in particular can switch in on common Water-type Pokemon such as Chinchou and support Buizel with entry hazards and Spore, respectively. Grass-types also cover Buizel's only two weaknesses, Electric and Grass. Electric-type Pokemon are very threatening to Buizel, and the most common one, Chinchou, threatens Buizel both offensively and defensively. This makes Pokemon immune to Electric-type attacks, such as Chinchou and Hippopotas, great teammates for Buizel. Buizel generally needs help to get around Porygon, Ferroseed, and other bulky Pokemon, so a Fighting-type wallbreaker such as Pancham is a great teammate. Any teammate that values the removal of Gastly can benefit from Buizel's presence if it is running Pursuit. Cottonee is an especially nice teammate, as it fears Gastly and also beats Water-types for Buizel.</p>"

  "Cherubi": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite being outclassed as a lone Chlorophyll sweeper due to a lack of Sleep Powder and a secondary STAB type, Cherubi excels at opening holes for and generally supporting other Chlorophyll sweepers. Cherubi is one of two Pokemon with access to both Chlorophyll and Healing Wish, which works perfectly alongside its access to Weather Ball and Dazzling Gleam, which allow it to take on many common checks to sun teams and clear the way for another Chlorophyll sweeper. Unfortunately, Cherubi's coverage misses out on Fire-types unless it uses Hidden Power. This is slightly augmented by Stealth Rock support and Cherubi's decent offensive stats coupled with a Life Orb, yet this does leave it rather frail and forced out by anything it does not KO. Additionally, Cherubi mandates the presence of both Vulpix and a second Chlorophyll sweeper to be used effectively, limiting its usefulness to very specific team builds.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cherubi has few other great moves to run; Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit Fire-types, but it is rather weak and usually a worse option compared to Dazzling Gleam. Grass Whistle can be used to put an opposing Pokemon to sleep, but its horrible accuracy makes it almost useless. A set with Growth and Eviolite is usable but largely outclassed by bulkier Chlorophyll sweepers such as Bulbasaur. Lastly, a bulky set taking advantage of Aromatherapy and Healing Wish is usable, but it is extremely niche at best.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Munchlax is one of the best counters to sun sweepers; it readily absorbs anything Cherubi can throw at it and OHKOes it with Fire Punch in the sun. Cherubi is also 2HKOed by Body Slam and Return, meaning it cannot hit Munchlax hard enough to overwhelm it even if Munchlax only has a STAB move. Additionally, Porygon is a solid answer, as it can paralyze Cherubi with Thunder Wave and OHKO with Ice Beam while always surviving a Solar Beam from decent health.</p> <p><strong>Chespin</strong>: Chespin's ability Bulletproof makes it immune to Weather Ball, meaning only a resisted Solar Beam or weak Dazzling Gleam from Cherubi can damage Chespin. Chespin also walls the premier Chlorophyll sweeper Bellsprout, which is most frequently paired with Cherubi.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types can be a huge problem for Cherubi. Fletchling in particular is one of the best offensive checks to all sun sweepers thanks to priority Acrobatics, which OHKOes Cherubi outright.</p> <p><strong>Ponyta</strong>: Ponyta resists all of Cherubi's attacks and can easily switch in if Stealth Rock is not up. Ponyta is at best 2HKOed half of the time by Cherubi after Stealth Rock, while it can OHKO back with Flare Blitz. Flame Charge also allows Ponyta to outspeed the entire team while still beating Cherubi, which is problematic due to Ponyta being able to deal with Archen, Honedge, Magnemite, and Pawniard, all of which are very important checks to Fletchling.</p> <p><strong>Faster Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Faster Choice Scarf users such as Gastly and Doduo, while uncommon, outspeed Cherubi and easily OHKO it, making these Pokemon great checks.</p> <p><strong>Weather Inducers</strong>: Snover, Amaura, and Hippopotas can all switch into all of Cherubi's attacks, though the former two should not do so too often due to their Stealth Rock weaknesses. With the removal of sun, Cherubi cannot use Solar Beam in one turn and will be locked into charging it up, allowing for a Grass-resistant foe to switch in and force Cherubi out. Additionally, all three are able to check and force out Cherubi because it will no longer outspeed Snover and Amaura or reliably 2HKO Hippopotas.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Chlorophyll Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Solar Beam is the most powerful STAB option for Cherubi and naturally finds usage on this set thanks to sun support, which is necessary when using Cherubi. Similarly, Weather Ball becomes a 100-Base Power Fire-type attack in the sun, providing good coverage alongside Solar Beam. Dazzling Gleam is useful for hitting Vullaby, as it 2HKOes all common variants or KOes them in tandem with Solar Beam or Weather Ball after Stealth Rock. Healing Wish can be used once Cherubi is low on health to restore another important Pokemon on the team to full health.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread and a Modest nature maximize Special Attack and Speed, while the remaining EVs are invested in Defense to take priority attacks better. Chlorophyll is Cherubi's only ability and doubles its Speed under sun. The EV spread lets it hit 13 Speed, allowing it to outspeed Choice Scarf 17 Speed Pokemon with Chlorophyll active. Life Orb makes Cherubi significantly more powerful, securing a variety of 2HKOs; the reduction of HP IVs to 9 allows Cherubi to hit 19 HP, reducing the Life Orb recoil to 1 HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cherubi should be utilized to weaken an opposing team's sun checks and therefore should enter the field under sun as soon as possible. When paired with a Pursuit trapper that can switch into Fletchling, such as Cranidos, Honedge, or Pawniard, Cherubi can be used to lure in Fletchling and remove it from play. Stealth Rock should be kept up for as long as possible to extend Cherubi's ability to puncture holes in opposing teams. Stealth Rock has an additive bonus of forcing in Defog Vullaby to clear the field of hazards, allowing Cherubi to take out the unsuspecting target. Use Healing Wish to bring a critical member of the team, often Vulpix or a Pursuit user, back to full health after Cherubi has done its job of softening sun checks. Thanks to Healing Wish, you can play more aggressively to keep sun up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vulpix is a mandatory teammate for setting up sun with its ability Drought. In addition, Cherubi works best when paired with another Chlorophyll sweeper such as Bellsprout. Both Cherubi and the other Chlorophyll sweeper appreciate a Pursuit user capable of trapping Fletchling, such as Cranidos or Honedge. Honedge must be wary of sun-boosted Overheat from Fletchling, however. Entry hazard support from Archen, Pawniard, or Drilbur allows Cherubi to get additional OHKOs and 2HKOs, most notably against opposing Vullaby and Larvesta. Offensive threats lacking reliable recovery, notably Pawniard and Timburr, pair well with Cherubi thanks to the Healing Wish support it can provide.</p>"

  "Shellos": {
    "overview": "<p>The buff to Knock Off caused a drastic increase in the viability and popularity of the move, and with it, a rise in methods to deal with it. Among these methods is a Pokemon with the ability Sticky Hold to absorb the attack, and Shellos is a wonderful candidate for such a role. Although its stats might not be particularly impressive, Sticky Hold, Eviolite, and reliable recovery mean that Shellos can be difficult to take out. On top of that, Shellos has all the right moves to fit in on a team as its bulky Water-type. However, Shellos is by no means free of the detriments that its average stats bring. In addition to being slow and lacking offensive presence, Shellos is left with decent but not exceptional bulk, leaving it very prone to wallbreakers and preventing it from seeing more use. Shellos is an excellent choice when used with other defensive Pokemon thanks to its ability to withstand Knock Off with ease, but it should be avoided on more fast-paced teams due to its limited offensive presence and inability to take especially powerful attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Despite having a fairly average movepool, Shellos has a few other options. Most notably, Stockpile allows Shellos to attempt a sweep, but such a set is beaten by several common threats, such as Foongus and RestTalk Chinchou, and can be taken out by random critical hits. Amnesia or Acid Armor are alternate methods of boosting Shellos's defenses, but running one of the two will leave Shellos vulnerable on the other defensive stat, and running both will leave Shellos pressed for moveslots. A combination of Rest and Sleep Talk allows Shellos to heal to full health while removing any status conditions, but Shellos will only be able to heal once every three turns, which doesn't bode well with Shellos's only decent defensive stats, and Sleep Talk choosing Rest could have fatal consequences. Counter and Mirror Coat are interesting choices in certain scenarios, such as reflecting back Volt Switches, but Shellos usually has better options. Scald is almost always the preferred Water-type STAB move because other options, such as Surf, do not carry as useful side effects as Scald. Hidden Power as a coverage option is generally unnecessary because Shellos already carries plenty of coverage moves that have higher Base Power and do not lower its IVs. Memento is underwhelming on a Pokemon as slow as Shellos, and is usually used for sweepers, which might not fit on the defensive teams Shellos should be on. A Curse set is usually ineffective because Shellos doesn't get Waterfall, and as such, lacks a decent STAB move to take advantage of the Attack boosts with.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Foongus resists Scald, avoids the 2HKO from Ice Beam, is immune to Toxic, and can force Shellos out with the threat of Spore or Giga Drain, while Sun sweepers such as Bulbasaur, Oddish, and Bellsprout can withstand anything but Ice Beam, weaken Scald even further with Sunny Day, and set up Growths or KO with Solar Beam. Lileep is immune to Scald and can avoid the 3HKO from Ice Beam more often than not, but it dislikes Toxic. Ferroseed is able to set up entry hazards against Shellos and wear it down with Bullet Seed, but it can eventually lose if Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Chinchou is able to threaten Shellos with a STAB Electric-type attack, with defensive variants being able to avoid the 2HKO from Earth Power. Magnemite is able to deal tremendous damage with Thunderbolt, but it must be wary of Earth Power if Sturdy is not intact.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Tentacool can absorb anything that Shellos can throw at it thanks to its high Special Defense stat and can set up Toxic Spikes, which severely hampers Shellos's walling potential, while forcing Shellos out with a combination of Acid Spray and Giga Drain. Croagunk is immune to both Toxic and Scald and is able to use Nasty Plot or Bulk Up to set up on Shellos, but it might not enjoy repeated Earth Powers.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Being badly poisoned will render Shellos unable to effectively stall by limiting its ability to stay in; this is best done through Toxic or two layers of Toxic Spikes. Pokemon that are able to withstand multiple Scalds, such as Frillish, can Taunt Shellos, preventing it from using Recover or Toxic, and then proceed to wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Rest + Sleep Talk</strong>: Defensive Chinchou once again makes an excellent counter to Shellos by mostly ignoring anything that Shellos can throw at it and threatening it with Electric-type attacks. Rest + Sleep Talk variants of Munchlax and Mantyke will be unable to immediately harm Shellos significantly but can PP stall it dry by not attacking while asleep. Snubbull has a chance of being 3HKOed if one of Shellos's Scalds gets a maximum damage roll or lands a critical hit, but it can otherwise do the same.</p> <p><strong>Nukes</strong>: Due to Shellos's somewhat average stats, extremely powerful attacks such as Life Orb Bunnelby's Return and Life Orb Reckless Mienfoo's High Jump Kick can deal over 70% damage, meaning that if these Pokemon are able to get in safely, they will be able to cleanly 2HKO Shellos outside of a miss.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This is Shellos's best bet for taking advantage of its unique strengths. Scald is a reliable STAB move and carries a useful burn chance, allowing Shellos to better wall physical attackers. Recover is essential to Shellos's walling capabilities by providing reliable recovery, allowing Shellos to remain healthy. As a coverage move, Earth Power is the preferred option because it allows Shellos to switch into and easily beat Croagunk and Pawniard that lack Swords Dance , while also hitting Chinchou and Magnemite on the switch, but Ice Beam deals decent damage to frailer Grass-types on the switch as well as hitting the occasional Dragon-type. The final moveslot is best dedicated to one of Shellos's supportive options; Toxic cripples certain switch-ins such as Lileep and Porygon, but does not synergize well with Scald's burn chance. On the other hand, Clear Smog helps prevent Shellos from being setup bait against sweepers such as Tirtouga and Scraggy, whereas Yawn allows Shellos to force more switches, although it does not synergize well with Scald, either.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sticky Hold should be Shellos's ability because it is what gives Shellos its main niche, allowing it to absorb the ubiquitous Knock Off. Eviolite gives Shellos acceptable bulk, and it cannot be removed by Knock Off thanks to Sticky Hold. With the given EVs, which hit Eviolite numbers, Shellos is able to reach respectable defensive stats of 27 HP / 21 Defense / 21 Special Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because Shellos is able to maintain its Eviolite-boosted bulk, it is able to switch in on the likes of Mienfoo and Pawniard and wall them with relative ease, provided that they don't have a means of boosting their Attack. Scald is the most spammable move because Shellos can try to cripple switch-ins with a burn, but keep in mind that, unless it's hitting for super effective damage, Shellos is usually fairly weak. Do not attempt to switch into extremely powerful attacks, because Shellos's defenses are still breakable. If using Shellos as your sole answer to a certain Pokemon, ensure that Shellos is always healthy enough to absorb two of their attacks because Shellos is quite slow.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Shellos is best used on defensive teams; it should not be used on an offensive team because its entirely defensive nature means it will make the team lose momentum. Pokemon that are particularly impeded by Knock Off, such as Spritzee and Abra, make good teammates. In fact, anything that especially dislikes Pawniard, such as Spritzee or Lileep, will appreciate Shellos's presence. In terms of Pokemon to help support Shellos, Ferroseed beats the Grass- and Electric-types that plague Shellos while Shellos is able to withstand the Fire-type attacks aimed at Ferroseed. A cleric such as Spritzee or Lickitung can help with Shellos's susceptibility to Toxic. Shellos's typing and movepool allow it to fit into a variety of defensive teams as a bulky Water-type and a switch-in to Knock Off.</p>"

It also has a decent Attack stat along with access to a wide range of attacking options, including Fake Out, Return, Drain Punch, and the elemental punches. Buneary also has an interesting ability in Klutz, which when used with Switcheroo allows Buneary to cripple walls by tricking a Choice item or a status orb onto them. However, Buneary's average defenses, no resistances, weakness to the common Fighting-type, and susceptibility to faster Pokemon and priority users hinder its longevity. It also faces difficulty taking on bulkier Pokemon if it is not running a Switcheroo set. However, Buneary is still quite capable, and its ability to run multiple sets can make it difficult to play around.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Buneary has access to Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, Iron Tail, Power-Up Punch, and even Circle Throw, but the offensive options listed in the Choice Band set are generally more viable. Assault Vest can be used on the Klutz set in order to cripple clerics and walls such as Spritzee and Ferroseed; however, a Choice item will normally cripple these foes just as well. Buneary is the only viable Pokemon in LC to get both Baton Pass and Cosmic Power. With Eviolite, Buneary  becomes very bulky after a Cosmic Power boost, which it can then pass to a teammate. Fling can be used with an Iron Ball to get a high-powered attack against the Ghost-types that Buneary has trouble with; however, Switcheroo is generally better anyway due to how it can permanently cripple enemies while stealing their items in the process. Buneary gets Magic Coat, which could be used to deflect Taunt or other disruptive moves that might be aimed at Buneary to cripple it. Focus Sash can be used with Endeavor and Quick Attack, making Buneary an effective user of the FEAR tactic, but its other options are more viable in LC. Buneary also has the high Speed to use Flail after activating its Focus Sash, making it very deadly as long as there are no priority users, faster Pokemon, or Rock-, Steel-, or Ghost-types left on the opponent's team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Vacuum Wave Croagunk and Mach Punch Timburr can negate Buneary's impressive 19 Speed with their STAB priority attacks and often either OHKO Buneary or put it in a bad position. Many other Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Scraggy are bulky enough to take a Choice Band Return and heal off the damage taken with Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Although not many Ghost-type Pokemon can risk being crippled by a Choice Band, Ghost-types such as Gastly and Pumpkaboo can easily come in on Buneary if it is locked into Return or Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users can put any support set Buneary runs out of commission; however, Cottonee is the only one that outspeeds Buneary, due to Prankster.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: While they don't like to be crippled by items, physically bulky Pokemon such as Vullaby, Timburr, Ponyta, Spritzee, and Tirtouga can come in on a resisted Choice Band attack and either attack or heal.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Mienfoo, Pawniard, Drilbur, and Bunnelby all outspeed Buneary and can hit it very hard, as Buneary isn't very bulky without Eviolite.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Buneary's STAB Return hits foes very hard, considering its high Base Power and the Choice Band boost it receives. Drain Punch is a powerful option to hit the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Return, and it also regains a bit of health back. Jump Kick is a more powerful Fighting-type alternative to Drain Punch; however, it doesn't provide healing, and it can also be a dicey move to be locked into because it gives Ghost-type foes a free switch-in. Fire Punch ensures Buneary isn't walled by Ghost-types, particularly Pumpkaboo and Gastly, and provides super effective coverage against Ferroseed if Fighting-type coverage isn't needed. A boost to all physical attacks is great, but what makes Choice Band viable on Buneary is its ability to use Switcheroo and cripple a troublesome foe by limiting its move options. Healing Wish can be used to completely heal a teammate when Buneary is running low on HP. This can be especially useful in securing a sweep by giving a powerful teammate a second chance. Thunder Wave can be used instead to cripple strong foes such as Mienfoo, Pawniard, and Archen if Buneary is about to go down.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs allow Buneary to reach 19 Speed and a whopping 24 Attack with Choice Band. Limber nullifies the enemy's attempts to ruin Buneary's Speed by paralyzing it and is used over Klutz because Choice Band's 50% boost will not apply with Klutz.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set reaches its peak offensive potential mid-game or late-game after foes are softened up a bit, so all-out attacking early in the game is a bad idea, as Buneary's bulk is quite low without Eviolite. Many players will assume Buneary is running Klutz, so you can play mind games by making them think Buneary is running the Switcheroo support set or something not offensive; this bluff can cause the opponent to misplay. Switcheroo should be reserved for a carefully-thought-out play; only use it when you are sure it's the right moment to, as Buneary usually won't get the Choice Band back and its offensive presence becomes stunted afterward. Switcheroo also lets Buneary steal Berry Juice to heal itself, while preventing it from healing the original holder, which is reasonably easy to do with 19 Speed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A strong Dark-type or a Pursuit user such as Pawniard, Stunky, Houndour, or Munchlax helps remove the Ghost-types that wall this set, making Buneary's Return and Drain Punch a lot more spammable. Anything that can take on the bulky Fighting-types that beat Buneary is a good teammate, such as Spritzee and Vullaby.</p>"
      },
      "Switcheroo Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fake Out is a priority move that provides free damage and item scouting so that you can know what to expect upon using Switcheroo. Return is a reliable STAB attack that is decently powerful and can be used with Buneary's 19 Speed to make it less passive under pressure. Switcheroo gives a foe, particularly a bulky wall such as Ferroseed or Spritzee, a crippling item, depriving it of its preferred item. Heal Bell can be used mid- or late-game to rid Buneary's team of all status and often assure victories. Healing Wish has a similar purpose but instead allows any non-fainted teammate to come in with completely restored health and status; this can often make impossible comebacks possible and eliminates the drag of having an important Pokemon degraded to death fodder upon taking a hard hit, being statused, or both. Furthermore, this move has very limited distribution and Buneary is the fastest user of it. Thunder Wave is an option for crippling foes such as Pawniard, Archen, and Mienfoo if Buneary is about to go down.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature with 236 Speed EVs allows Buneary to reach the important 19 Speed tier, while the remaining EVs in HP and Defense give Buneary the highest possible physical bulk. The given spread allows Buneary to hit 25 HP, a number that minimizes passive damage from entry hazards or a burn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>You cannot play recklessly with Buneary. Its defenses aren't stellar even with full investment, and a misprediction can sometimes be disastrous. Fake Out really helps with deciding when to go for Switcheroo, as you can gauge the damage to tell if the foe is holding Eviolite or not; however, Return can be used to clean late-game if necessary but usually should not be used too early in a match unless it will secure a KO. Klutz allows Buneary to hide its item because none of the usual effects will activate, letting Buneary use Switcheroo to cripple a foe out of the blue at an opportune moment. If Buneary is using Flame Orb, it can cripple most physical attackers while also taking away their preferred item; this is effective in the long run because it doesn't miss like Will-O-Wisp and cannot be healed by Heal Bell or Aromatherapy, as it activates at the end of every turn as long as the enemy holds it. If Buneary is using Choice Band, it can cripple most special attackers and walls while taking away their preferred item; locking the foe into an attack can provide a teammate with a valuable free switch, and Pokemon that rely on their support move pool will be severely hindered.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Anything that can come in on Fighting-type Pokemon makes for a good teammate, such as Ponyta, Spritzee, and Vullaby. Pokemon that hate being limited by status problems are happy to have Buneary as a teammate to help keep them in good shape if needed. Anything that can get Buneary in safely via U-turn or Volt Switch while forcing switches will allow Buneary the opportunities it needs to scout the opponent's team and find the right time to use Switcheroo; Pokemon that come to mind for this role include Mienfoo, Chinchou, Magnemite, Larvesta, and Vullaby. Things that can deal with Taunt users, particularly Cottonee, Onix, and Mienfoo, also make for good teammates.</p>"

  "Glameow": {
    "overview": "<p>Glameow faces a lot of competition in the LC metagame as a fast, offensive Normal-type. While its offensive stats are outclassed by those of both Aipom and Meowth, its Dark- and Fairy-type coverage moves give it unique offensive options. With access to both Fake Out and Sucker Punch, it's capable of outprioritizing Fletchling, and it can use its high Speed to revenge kill effectively. Don't spring into action with Glameow right away, though; it suffers from a severe lack of bulk in a metagame full of bulky Pokemon. Entry hazards and residual damage wear it down quickly, and, in worst cases, it can't even take a single attack without being KOed. Due to its very low bulk and poor offensive stats, it is threatened by and can be setup bait for plenty of common sweepers like Timburr, Omanyte, and Pawniard. With the right support, however, Glameow can find its way into a team desperately needing a fast Knock Off or Fake Out user.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Super Fang can potentially hit defensive Pokemon harder, as it halves the target's HP while ignoring defensive stats, but it has shaky accuracy and can't be easily reused like Fake Out or Return. If you're looking for more overall damage, Quick Attack can be used over Fake Out, as it is more consistent; however, it lacks the flinch chance required for Glameow to get out safely or build free turns. With Glameow's high Speed, Taunt can shut down faster setup sweepers like Pawniard and Shell Smash Dwebble, but due to its terrible bulk, it can't capitalize on those free turns easily. Iron Tail can 2HKO standard Spritzee but has little application outside of that. Hypnosis from Glameow's 19 Speed has the potential to gravely cripple an opposing Pokemon, but its low accuracy makes it unreliable. In the same vein, Toxic can be used to discourage physical walls such as Spritzee and Ponyta that have reliable recovery, but each of them can 2HKO Glameow with their STAB moves, so it's a very high-risk strategy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Glameow's poor offenses mean that Pokemon with high bulk or recovery can nullify its damage and switch into Glameow's attacks without fear. Defensive Ponyta's Flame Body, recovery, and high bulk make it nigh impossible for Glameow to dent. Bulky Regenerators like Foongus and Mienfoo can recover off Glameow's damage as quickly as it's dished out. Leaving Glameow in to take a Drain Punch can be catastrophic, as mostly every user of the move in the metagame can OHKO Glameow with it and regain a considerable amount of HP. Foongus, on the other hand, can easily cripple Glameow with Spore, rendering it useless as it only needs to stay in for one or two turns at a time, or 2HKO with Sludge Bomb. However, many bulky Pokemon dislike having their items removed by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Boosting Sweepers</strong>: Glameow's poor bulk means that it is entirely incapable of surviving attacks from opposing sweepers. Choice Scarf variants of Mienfoo and Bunnelby, boosted priority from Timburr, Pawniard, and Fletchling, and Shell Smash sweepers at +2 Speed will easily OHKO it with their STAB moves. Without any prior damage, Glameow has a hard time revenge killing these threats as well. Be very careful when scouting for these types of Pokemon, as they can also outspeed Glameow before you have the opportunity to use U-turn and potentially cost you games.</p> <p><strong>Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: Ferroseed can switch into Fake Out and U-turn effortlessly and tack on extra residual damage to wear down Glameow. Ferroseed can also easily set up hazards when brought in against Glameow, which worsens the residual damage problem further. Entry hazard setters like Dwebble and Onix are also bad matchups for Glameow, as they can easily shrug off attacks and even OHKO with STAB Rock Blast with a good roll. Tirtouga, Omanyte, and Pawniard can easily set up on Glameow due to their high defenses and typing and Glameow's low offenses.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types will always threaten Glameow due to their super effective STAB attacks, but Croagunk specifically isn't hit very hard by Play Rough and has access to super effective priority while resisting Glameow's priority. If Glameow is not running Play Rough, Scraggy and Timburr can easily set up on it and threaten the entire team with their sweeping potential.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Pumpkaboo and Drifloon are immune to Fake Out, and they can both bait out Sucker Punch and cripple Glameow at the same time with Will-O-Wisp. Focus Sash variants of Gastly can survive Sucker Punch after switching into a Normal-type move and can OHKO with Sludge Bomb after Life Orb recoil. However, Glameow has the potential to cripple Ghost-types switching in with Knock Off.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is this set's main STAB move; with its high Base Power, it hits for good neutral damage when boosted by Life Orb. Sucker Punch is a strong priority move that, when used with Glameow's high Speed, can revenge kill weakened threats easily, especially Pokemon that are weak to it such as Abra and Gastly. Fake Out is used mainly to do a decent amount of chip damage. In order for the move to be used again, however, Glameow must be switched in multiple times. Knock Off is a valuable move in LC that can potentially cripple any Pokemon hit with it; thanks to Glameow's high Speed, few Pokemon in the metagame can outpace it and others are almost guaranteed to be hit, even if Glameow is KOed in the process. Play Rough is a Fairy-type coverage move that can hit Fighting- and Dark-types hard on the switch in. Standard bulky Mienfoo, for example, is KOed by Play Rough after a hit with Fake Out, while standard Timburr is 2HKOed by Play Rough. Finally, U-turn can be used on predicted switches to gain momentum or to get Glameow out of tough matchups.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs and Life Orb ensure that Glameow inflicts maximum damage on its foes. Maximum Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Glameow to hit 19 Speed, letting it Speed tie with Abra and Ponyta as well as outspeed all 17 and 18 Speed Pokemon. The stray point in Defense ensures that Glameow is not OHKOed by Timburr's unboosted Mach Punch from full health, allowing it to respond before being KOed by Life Orb recoil in a worst-case scenario. The 1 IV in HP brings Glameow's HP down to 19, minimizing Life Orb recoil by making it only subtract 1 HP per attack; this is crucial because Glameow relies on Life Orb to deal as much damage as it can. Limber isn't a stellar ability, but it has niche uses, allowing Glameow to safely switch in on paralysis-inducing moves like Snubbull's or Porygon's Thunder Wave and Cottonee's Stun Spore.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Glameow set fully takes advantage of Glameow's potential as a hit-and-run attacker. Due to reduced Life Orb recoil, you shouldn't be afraid to use Fake Out whenever possible to deal damage and keep Glameow safe. U-turn can be used similarly to predict incoming switches. However, be wary against Ferroseed, Ponyta, and Larvesta; these Pokemon can easily take Glameow's weaker attacks and add on residual damage that reduces Glameow's longevity in the battle. In the case of a Flame Body burn, Glameow gets shut down completely. After switching into Fake Out, standard bulky variants of Mienfoo will be KOed by Play Rough, so be sure to predict incoming Mienfoo if you're running Play Rough. Knock Off can be used to great effect as well; in the worst-case scenario, Glameow's high Speed allows it to Knock Off a key threat in a game before it can react. Fake Out when used in conjunction with Sucker Punch can revenge kill weakened threats; pay special attention to opponents' Abra or Gastly, which are weak to Sucker Punch and are easily picked off after hazard damage. Glameow's offenses are lackluster, however; don't expect to be able to revenge kill healthy threats. Try not to switch Glameow into any damaging attacks, if possible. Its extremely poor bulk means it can't take hits and perform its role at the same time, even if Life Orb does less recoil. However, being a Normal-type, Glameow can switch in on a predicted Shadow Ball from Gastly or Abra and set up for a revenge kill. Due to Limber, Glameow can also switch in on Snubbull, Porygon, and Cottonee if they attempt to use a paralysis-inducing move. Use this opportunity to use Fake Out or Knock Off to add extra damage on these defensive threats.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard stackers in LC such as Dwebble, Ferroseed, and Onix can add extra residual damage on the opponent's side, making it easier for Glameow to pick off weakened Pokemon with Return and Sucker Punch. Onix specifically has the merit of being able to shut down other hazard setters with a fast Taunt, giving Glameow extra breathing room when switching in. That being said, Rapid Spin or Defog support increases Glameow's longevity in a battle, as a lack of entry hazards on your side allows Glameow to switch in and out freely. As entry hazards can help Glameow perform its role in a battle, Pokemon that can disrupt or punish hazard removal, such as Defiant Pawniard and spinblockers such as Pumpkaboo and other Ghost-types, can be a great help. Bulky, defensive pivots such as Ponyta, Spritzee, Foongus, and Acrobatics variants of Mienfoo can easily switch in on common counters to Glameow; Ponyta's burn potential with Flame Body and Will-O-Wisp, combined with its excellent bulk, allows it to stave off physical attackers such as Pawniard and Mienfoo that threaten Glameow with high-powered STAB attacks. Spritzee and Foongus wall Fighting-types bar Croagunk. Acrobatics Mienfoo can be a good Knock Off absorber that can also check other Fighting-types like Timburr and the aforementioned Croagunk, as well as other Foongus. Late-game cleaners such as Pawniard, Corphish, and Timburr can always benefit from repeated hit-and-run damage, as it weakens the Pokemon they need to sweep through. Finally, trappers such as Diglett and Gothita can effectively trap and KO Flame Body users such as Larvesta and Ponyta, as well as the pesky Ferroseed.</p>"

  "Stunky": {
    "overview": "<p>Stunky has a great typing that leaves it with a grand total of one weakness: Ground. Additionally, it is the lone Poison-type immune to Psychic thanks to its second typing of Dark, which grants Stunky key resistances to Dark- and Ghost-type moves. Its niche is further enlarged by Stunky's typing allowing it to switch into Abra and Gastly without needing to worry about Hidden Power Fighting and remove them thanks to Pursuit. Poor abilities limit Stunky's effectiveness, with Aftermath being the only real option. Aftermath activates once, and only when Stunky is KOed by a contact move, thus unfortunately it is very situational. However, Aftermath working in tandem with Stunky's coverage options Play Rough or Fire Blast allows Stunky to trade itself for the opposing Pokemon in a number of cases. Stunky's defenses are average at best, but this is thankfully mitigated by Stunky's helpful resistances and great Speed, being one of the few Pokemon able to hit 18 Speed. Few Pokemon can outspeed a fully invested Stunky, and the ones that do tend to struggle against it anyway. Stunky also has the niche of having access to Defog while not being weak to Rock. However, Defog is incompatible with Play Rough and Stunky has no recovery to heal entry hazard damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Explosion can be useful if Stunky is close to fainting to go out with a bang, but this is typically inferior to Memento. Toxic can be used to wear down bulky Pokemon with recovery such as Porygon because Stunky can't break through them with its poor offensive stats, but is hard to fit onto any set. Acid Spray is a unique choice, but it allows for some minor wallbreaking especially against the likes of Foongus. Snarl hits through Substitutes and lowers the foe's Special Attack, though it is weak and situational. Choice Scarf, Life Orb, and Berry Juice can all be considered on faster Stunky, but are all relatively niche. Life Orb allows Stunky to hit harder, but sacrifices bulk for only a small number of KOs while Choice Scarf makes Stunky setup bait after it removes Abra or Gastly. Berry Juice can be used over Eviolite for more longevity, but this can create an issue versus the likes of Gastly if entry hazards are on the field.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types are troublesome for Stunky, because while they don't particularly do much damage it, they take very little from Stunky's Dark STAB moves and tend to be okay with Play Rough's damage.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types are not always foolproof checks before Stunky's moveset is known, but if Stunky lacks a Poison STAB move, then Pokemon such as Spritzee or Snubbull can effectively wall Stunky.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Timburr are good checks to Stunky because they don't mind Stunky's Dark STAB move and they can outlast it with Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground is the one weakness that Stunky has, so Pokemon such as Drilbur and Diglett can make quick work of it with their STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: The Grass / Poison dual typing counters any Stunky not running Fire Blast. Foongus can freely use status moves and repeatedly switch into Stunky. Ferroseed can wear Stunky down fairly easily with Iron Barbs and Bullet Seed damage, as well as set up entry hazards or use Thunder Wave as it forces Stunky out. Chespin is immune to Sludge Bomb due to Bulletproof and can set up.</p> <p><strong>Pawniard</strong>: While most of the time using Defog would be a great thing, using it as Pawniard switches in could be the start of a sweep against Stunky's team. Pawniard's Defiant will raise its Attack by two stages. However, Pawniard does fear Fire Blast and tends to lose to full-health Stunky.</p> <p><strong>Walls</strong>: Stunky has subpar attacking stats, so anything with enough bulk, and especially recovery, can take hits from Stunky and wear it down.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Pursuit": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Pursuit gives Stunky the means of punishing and preventing the escape of Ghost-types such as Gastly, Pumpkaboo, and Psychic-types such as Abra, Gothita, and Natu. Even Pokemon not weak to Dark feel the effects of Pursuit, as they cannot switch out unscathed. Sucker Punch gives Stunky priority, allowing it to revenge kill certain setup sweepers such as Omantye and Drilbur. Sucker Punch is unreliable though, as the opponent has to attack for it to work. Defog is a good option too if your team needs entry hazard removal, although there are better hazard removers out there such as Staryu, Drilbur, and Vullaby due to Stunky's inability to threaten Stealth Rock users and lack of recovery. Running Fire Blast gives Stunky the ability to KO Pawniard, hoping to nab a boost from Defog, and other Steel-types hoping to capitalize on Stunky's meager offenses. Sludge Bomb is the best Poison STAB move Stunky gets, but can be disappointingly weak at times. However, Sludge Bomb does get the job done versus Fairy-types and several Grass-types such as Cottonee.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread allows for Stunky to always counter Abra and Gastly even with Stealth Rock up while having the ability to almost always survive two attacks from Pawniard and Fletchling. A Brave nature is used for hitting 15 Attack, which allows Pursuit to always KO Abra and Gastly after Stealth Rock. The decrease in Speed is hardly noticed in most cases as Stunky still outspeeds what it wants to as well. The Special Attack investment allows for the 2HKO on Pawniard with Fire Blast and Eviolite Spritzee with Sludge Bomb.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be aware of the situation when you bring Stunky into battle, as you don't want it to be taking any extra hits, as its bulk leaves a little to be desired even with an Eviolite. Stunky is also relatively easy to force out and is fairly weak offensively, so make sure anything you want to take out without the use of Pursuit is weak enough to be KOed. Stunky's Speed is lowered due to a Brave nature, so the use of Sucker Punch is much more important.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stunky has no reliable recovery, so Pokemon that can pass Wish such as Spritzee are good partners for Stunky. Stunky's only weakness is Ground, so Pokemon such as Drilbur and Hippopotas pose serious threats. Foongus and Pumpkaboo can deal with these threats safely. Bunnelby and Zigzagoon have their sweep prevented by Ghost-types, which Stunky takes out with Pursuit. Stunky can Defog entry hazards away for Pokemon such as Larvesta and Fletchling.</p>"
      },
      "Fast Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Pursuit enables Stunky to trap Pokemon which would otherwise threaten your team, notably Gastly, Gothita, and Abra, and finish off weakened Pokemon before they can return to their trainer. Sucker Punch allows Stunky to get some extra damage in on faster foes as they attack. Play Rough can be used over Sucker Punch in conjunction with Memento to give Stunky a means of hitting Fighting-type Pokemon which otherwise wall Stunky. Defog provides your team with entry hazard removal, but the amount of times Stunky can use Defog are limited due to its sub-par bulk. Also, Stunky fails to threaten most Stealth Rock users such as Archen, Onix, Diglett, and Drilbur. Memento creates an opportunity for a setup sweeper on your team to punish the opposition. Another utility option Stunky has is Taunt, allowing it to prevent Pokemon from using their status moves, which can really cripple some defensive Pokemon and allow Stunky time to Defog. With a Speed of 18, the fast Taunt can also outspeed Sticky Web setters such as Surskit and prevent them from setting up. Crunch is another STAB option, having the same power as Sucker Punch but with more consistency.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature allows Stunky to hit 18 Speed. That lets Stunky outspeed foes and Defog away entry hazards or use Memento to support a teammate before being KOed. It is especially useful for Sticky Web setters so Stunky can outspeed and Taunt them. Aftermath is the preferred ability, causing some extra damage to the opponent if Stunky is knocked out by a move that made contact. Stunky really enjoys the added bulk of an Eviolite because it is rather frail without it, which allows it to trap the Pokemon it needs to much better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be careful about when you bring Stunky into the battle; it can't take many hits, even with an Eviolite, so make sure you have the bulk to trap what you need to when you bring it in. Stunky's attacking stats are not the greatest too, so make sure the opponent is weakened enough to be KOed if you trying to do anything besides just trap them. Take note that this set finds its place on offensive teams, but should still not be played as a wallbreaking Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A variety of Fighting Pokemon greatly like the support that Stunky brings, with Timburr, Scraggy, and Pancham gaining the most from Stunky's support. Entry hazard-weak Pokemon, such as Larvesta and Ponyta, also pair well with Stunky due to Defog, with Ponyta and Larvesta also being able to aid with dealing with Fighting-type Pokemon and Pawniard that annoy Stunky. Wish passers, such as Spritzee, help prolong Stunky's lifespan, allowing it Defog more often, or come in on Ghost- and Psychic-types more. Switch-ins to Drilbur are also liked as Stunky teammates; Staryu, Cottonee, and Lileep each free up a moveslot on Stunky, making a Memento core as well as dealing with Fighting-types, countering Chinchou, as well as setting up Stealth Rock, respectively. Bunnelby, and especially Zigzagoon, can sweep much easier with Ghost-types out of the way, and appreciates Abra's Focus Sash getting broken too. Zigzagoon also appreciates Stunky using Memento, as this gives Zigzagoon an easier time setting up. Memento also aids the likes of Magby, Omanyte, and Rock Polish Archen with their setup as well. In general, hazard-weak Pokemon, sweepers, and Psychic-weak Pokemon all appreciate Stunky's assets as a teammate.</p>"

Recycle + Berry Juice increases Bronzor's longevity by allowing it to repeatedly recover its HP, unless it gets Knocked Off. Earthquake hits other Steel-types and Chinchou. Psychic is Bronzor's most powerful STAB move, which can hit Fighting-types on the switch. Toxic cripples bulky Pokemon, such as Porygon and Spritzee, that Bronzor wouldn't be able to touch otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed EVs, with a Careful nature and Berry Juice, allow Bronzor to check and set up entry hazards against almost every Pokemon without Knock Off, Flying- and Psychic-types in particular, throughout whole match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bronzor is a good switch-in to every Pokemon without Knock Off or another powerful Dark-, Fire- or Ghost-type STAB move. It's a great check to Archen, Fletchling, and all the other common Flying-types except for Vullaby. It is also a solid answer to Abra and other powerful special attackers that can't cripple it with Knock Off or a status move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The best teammates for Bronzor are Pokemon that can easily switch in against Knock Off users such as Fletching, bulky Fighting-types, and Sticky Hold users in the form of Trubbish and Shellos. Munchlax and Choice Scarf Pawniard can easily deal with Ghost-types that threaten Bronzor such as Gastly. Pokemon that can switch into Fire-, Dark-, and Fighting-types moves such as Skrelp, Ponyta and Vullaby are useful for dealing with the Pokemon that make Bronzor switch out. Bronzor also needs something to either spinblock or to take care of Drilbur and Staryu. Snivy and other Grass-types are great for taking on those two Pokemon, with Pumpkaboo in particular taking on both of them while also spinblocking.</p>"

  "Mime Jr.": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magic Coat can be useful to bounce back entry hazards and status moves. Mime Jr. can make for a decent setter of Reflect and Light Screen, but this is usually done better by other Pokemon, namely Natu and Snivy. Shadow Ball hits Honedge and has great coverage alongside Hidden Power Fighting, but Mime Jr. often doesn't enjoy giving up a moveslot for it. Hidden Power Bug can be used over Hidden Power Fighting to provide coverage against Psychic-types such as Slowpoke while still retaining coverage against Dark-types, but it misses out on the super effective hit on Ferroseed and Pawniard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Utility Moves</strong>: If Mime Jr. is Taunted before it can Taunt the foe, it won't be able to use any of its support moves, forcing it to switch out. Encore can potentially lock Mime Jr. into a boosting move. The opponent can then send in a Pokemon to take advantage of whichever defensive stat isn't being boosted and force Mime Jr. out. Knock Off hampers Mime Jr.'s longevity by removing its item, reducing the number of times that Mime Jr. can come in and boost.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Strong Poison-types such as Gastly and Skrelp are incredibly threatening to any set that lacks a Psychic-type STAB move, as they can hit Mime Jr. very hard with both of their STAB moves. However, these Pokemon will not be able to safely switch into Mime Jr.'s offensive sets. Stunky is also a notable Poison-type, as it is immune to Psychic thanks to its secondary Dark typing.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types, particularly Slowpoke, resist Choice Scarf Mime Jr.'s offensive coverage and can wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Pumpkaboo-XL and Honedge are immune to Hidden Power Fighting, aren't bothered too much by Psychic, and can threaten Mime Jr. with their STAB Ghost-type attacks. Honedge is particularly notable, as it resists Psychic and only fears the rare Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Any Pokemon that is bulky enough to take a hit from Mime Jr. and then cripple it back with a status move, heal off the damage, or simply wear it down by attacking can make for a good answer to Mime Jr. A good example is Porygon, which can tank Mime Jr.'s Technician-boosted Hidden Power Fighting, threaten back with Thunder Wave or Tri Attack, and heal off the damage done with Recover. Defensive Pokemon will need to be wary of switching into Trick, however.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is Mime Jr.'s strongest reliable STAB move and its primary option for revenge killing foes such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Gastly. Hidden Power Fighting provides coverage against Steel-types, most notably Pawniard, and it also receives a power boost from Technician. Healing Wish is an excellent utility option that allows Mime Jr. to restore one of its teammates to full health. Trick can be used to cripple switch-ins by giving them a Choice Scarf.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Speed investment alongside a Timid nature and a Choice Scarf allows Mime Jr. to hit 24 Speed, outpacing the unboosted metagame as well as some boosted threats such as +2 Tirtouga and +1 Scraggy. 200 Special Attack EVs boost the power of Mime Jr.'s attacks, and 80 Defense EVs allow Mime Jr. to tank priority moves more easily. Technician boosts the power of Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mime Jr. primarily functions as a revenge killer early- and mid-game. If Mime Jr.'s checks and counters are still present on the opposing team, use Trick to regain momentum or cripple the foe as they switch in, respectively. Healing Wish should be used mid- or late-game to restore a weakened or statused teammate to full health and give it a second shot at sweeping.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mime Jr. has trouble getting around opposing Psychic-types, so a strong Dark-type such as Pawniard, Houndour, or Stunky can pair up well with Mime Jr. to take on these threats or even trap them with Pursuit. Honedge can also make for a good Pursuit trapper, as it is able to take on Abra more easily than Pawniard or Houndour can. Entry hazard support from the likes of Dwebble, Ferroseed, and Venipede is also appreciated to help wear down the opposing team more quickly. Teammates that can check Fletchling, such as Archen, Chinchou, and Tirtouga, pair up well with Mime Jr., as it is easily forced out by Fletchling's strong priority Acrobatics. Chinchou makes for a great teammate, as it hard checks Fletchling and provides Volt Switch support to gain momentum for the team and bring Mime Jr. in safely. Gothita can trap and cripple or KO numerous special walls that Mime Jr. struggles with, which is especially helpful if Mime Jr. isn't running Trick itself. Numerous setup sweepers, such as Bulk Up Timburr, Swords Dance Fletchling, Dragon Dance Scraggy, Swords Dance Pawniard, and more, will appreciate Mime Jr.'s ability to restore them to full health with Healing Wish.</p>"

  "Gible": {
    "overview": "<p>While Gible faces heavy competition from other Dragon-types for an offensive role, it has several unique qualities that let it differentiate itself from its brethren. Gible's nearly unresisted STAB combination is backed up by a decent base 70 Attack, and it has a good ability in Rough Skin, which helps wear down physical attackers. However Gible has fairly low Speed and only average defenses, which isn't helped by its lack of reliable recovery and 4x weakness to Ice-type attacks. Gible's Ground typing also provides little defensive synergy with its Dragon typing. Gible should not be the first choice for an offensive Dragon-type, but it has good utility in the form of Stealth Rock and Rough Skin.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hone Claws is Gible's only boosting option, which also lets it use Dragon Rush and Stone Edge more effectively, but Gible is a bit slow and lacks recovery to use it effectively. Outrage is a much more powerful alternative to Dragon Claw but leaves Gible very prone to being revenge killed, and is better suited on more powerful Dragon-types such as Tyrunt. Similarly, Stone Edge can be run instead of Rock Tomb, but Rock Tomb possibly lets Gible attack twice due to its secondary effect and also somewhat cripples switch-ins. A mixed set with Draco Meteor can be used to hit hard without being locked into Outrage, but Gible's Special Attack is underwhelming. Fire Blast can be run in order to hit Ferroseed and Cottonee super effectively. A fully defensive set with Eviolite can be run in order to let Gible use Rough Skin more effectively, but Gible is reliant on Rest for recovery. Gible can also choose to hold Life Orb and run a faster offensive set, but due to Gible's low Speed and mediocre defenses, it is very prone to being killed quickly, although it can be effective with speed control. Gible can also hold Choice Scarf in order to make up for its low Speed, but this set lacks power and is easily walled. Berry Juice can be used for one-time recovery, but Eviolite is ultimately more useful for making Gible's defenses passable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Both Snubbull and Spritzee are able to take any of Gible's attacks bar Iron Tail due to their general bulk and threaten to deal heavy damage back with their STAB moves. Cottonee is especially threatening because it resists both of Gible's STAB moves and threatens to deal massive damage with Dazzling Gleam.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Because of Gible's 4x weakness to Ice-type attacks, virtually all Ice-types threaten to KO it with their STAB moves; most outspeed Gible as well, although Rock Tomb hits them very hard.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Attacks</strong>: Even without STAB, an Ice-type move can hurt Gible severely if not outright OHKO it. Common Pokemon with Ice-type coverage moves include Porygon, Staryu, and Chinchou.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulky foes are usually able to take Gible's attacks, as base 70 Attack isn't overwhelming. Examples include Ferroseed, Slowpoke, and Porygon, which can all repeatedly take Gible's attacks and threaten it back. However, most bulky Pokemon do not appreciate Toxic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock allows Gible to support its team, but Rock Tomb can be used if Stealth Rock support is not needed. Rock Tomb allows Gible to hit Flying-types harder than Dragon Claw can, and the move also provides support by slowing down foes. Earthquake and Dragon Claw form a nearly unresisted STAB combination, and Earthquake deals heavy damage even on neutral hits. The last moveslot has several options depending on what the team needs. Toxic allows Gible to cripple bulky foes that it cannot otherwise break through, Roar prevents Gible from being set up on and synergizes well with entry hazard support, and Iron Tail is a decent coverage option for hitting Fairy-types harder than Earthquake.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs with an Adamant nature allow Gible to hit as hard as possible with its STAB moves. The given defensive EVs allow Gible to avoid multiple 2HKOs and OHKOs from threats such as Spritzee, Snubbull, and Pawniard with Eviolite factored in. The remaining EVs let Gible hit 11 Speed, allowing it to outspeed foes such as defensive Porygon and standard Timburr. Rough Skin can help Gible wear down physical attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gible has several useful resistances and decent bulk, so it can switch into many neutral or resisted attacks. However its defenses aren't stellar and it lacks recovery, so be cautious about repeatedly switching in without Wish support. Once Gible is in, it becomes a matter of picking a STAB move to use, as only two Pokemon in LC resist both, Cottonee and Bronzor. Coverage moves can be used to hit predicted switch-ins but are fairly weak against neutral targets. Keep Gible's low Speed in mind with regards to its HP and the possibility of a foe's Ice-type coverage move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Water-types take devastating Ice attacks well. Chinchou can use Volt Switch to get Gible in safely, while Skrelp also resists Fairy-type attacks and threatens to KO Fairy-types with its Poison-type STAB moves. Steel-types such as Magnemite and Ferroseed resist all of Gible's weaknesses, while Gible resists and can threaten Fire-types. Ferroseed in particular provides additional entry hazard support, which can be useful if Gible is running Roar. Fire-types also resist both Fairy- and Ice-type moves and can easily break through Ferroseed, which has enough bulk to wall Gible. Gible also appreciates Wish support from Pokemon such as Spritzee, as it lacks reliable recovery of its own.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its massive base 135 HP and its great base 85 Special Defense, Munchlax has no trouble shrugging off most special attacks. Combine this with Thick Fat, and Munchlax is one of the hardest stops to Fire- and Ice-type Pokemon in the metagame. Munchlax also has a good base 85 Attack stat, allowing it to hit hard with moves such as Body Slam, Fire Punch, and Earthquake. However, base 40 Defense is quite low, and a horrid base 5 Speed means Munchlax will almost always be moving last. Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Scraggy are omnipresent in Little Cup and can easily prey on Munchlax. Finally, Munchlax faces serious competition from Porygon as a Normal-type tank, as Porygon has better mixed bulk, access to Recover, and a wider movepool.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pursuit is a very notable option, as it can trap Gastly that lack Will-O-Wisp. Outrage is a powerful option that can hit Ghost-types, but invites almost every Steel-type in the tier to come in and wall Munchlax. Shadow Ball hits Ghost-types while not losing power from burns, but Munchlax's low Special Attack stat makes it quite useless. Sunny Day and Rain Dance can be used on sun and rain teams, as Munchlax is a durable user of the moves. Belly Drum is usable with Munchlax's good bulk, but its Speed is so low that it's usually a waste of time. When used properly, Trick Room can help remedy the Speed problem and let Munchlax net a few KOs. However, with the substantial support needed to pull this off, it usually isn't worth the effort.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Timburr, Scraggy, and Croagunk can all do massive damage to Munchlax with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Onix and Tirtouga can take Body Slam, Return, or Fire Punch with ease. However, they must be wary of Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Depending on Munchlax's moveset, Ghost-types can have an easy time setting up on Munchlax. They can also burn the Berry Juice set with Will-O-Wisp. Still, they must be careful of Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Depending on the moveset Munchlax runs, Steel-types can have an easy time walling and setting up on Munchlax. Some of these Pokemon include Pawniard, Ferroseed, and Aron. Pawniard can also Knock Off Munchlax's Berry Juice or Eviolite, making it even more threatening. However, these Pokemon must watch out for Fire Punch and Earthquake.</p>",

      "Physically Offensive Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Body Slam is a great STAB attack that allows Munchlax to do a good amount of damage to foes while also having a chance to paralyze them. Return is a more powerful STAB option, although it doesn't have the chance to paralyze. Fire Punch hits Steel-types that would otherwise wall Munchlax, such as Ferroseed and Bronzor. It's also Munchlax's best way of hitting Ghost-types with Levitate, like Gastly. Curse boosts Munchlax's Attack and Defense while lowering its practically useless Speed, which can help in KOing potential counters. Earthquake hits Rock-types such as Tirtouga and Onix, while also hitting Steel-types such as Magnemite for more damage than Fire Punch. Toxic can also be used to wear down Pokemon that would otherwise wall Munchlax. Finally, Recycle gives Munchlax a way to recover HP, allowing it to avoid getting worn down itself.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Thick Fat is the best ability Munchlax can run, as it allows it to effectively counter Pokemon such as Larvesta and Ponyta despite its low Defense stat. 236 Attack EVs make Munchlax as strong as possible, and 236 Special Defense EVs help add to Munchlax's already massive special bulk. An Adamant nature increases Munchlax's power, though an Impish nature can be used to give Munchlax more physical bulk. Another possibility is running a spread of 156 Atk / 116 Def / 236 SpD with an Adamant nature, giving Munchlax better defensive bulk and the power of an Adamant nature. Finally, Berry Juice is the item of choice, as when used in tandem with Recycle, it gives Munchlax a reliable form of recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Munchlax is a great switch-in to most special attackers due to its great special bulk. Body Slam is Munchlax's main STAB move, and as such, it should be used liberally unless the opponent has a Ghost-type. Using Curse lets Munchlax threaten prospective Fighting-type switch-ins, as it can absorb a Drain Punch and still KO back after a boost or two. Munchlax hates most status effects, especially Toxic and sleep, and therefore should be kept away from them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Munchlax appreciates teammates like Trubbish that can reliably switch into Fighting-types to cover its weaknesses to physical Fighting-types. Pawniard is a major threat, as it can Knock Off Munchlax's item and then set up a Swords Dance. Mienfoo is a great counter to Pawniard, and as such makes a good teammate. Fletchling loves having Munchlax as a partner because Munchlax can beat Magnemite and Chinchou, which are among Fletchling's best checks. Munchlax is also vulnerable to Ghost-types that can easily burn it, so Choice Scarf Pawniard is a good partner, as it can KO these threats. Finally, Munchlax hates status, making Aromatherapy or Heal Bell users such as Spritzee helpful teammates.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Body Slam is the main STAB move for this set, as it's decently powerful and has the chance to paralyze the enemy. Return is a more powerful option, but it lacks the chance to paralyze. Fire Punch is Munchlax's main way to hit Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Bronzor; it also hits Ghost-types with Levitate, such as Gastly. Curse can be used to help boost Munchlax's Attack and Defense while lowering its useless Speed stat, allowing it to KO some of its counters more easily. Note, however, that using Curse instead of Fire Punch leaves Munchlax vulnerable to almost all Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-type Pokemon. Whirlwind is also an option for the second slot; with it, Munchlax can phaze away boosting sweepers and counters while also being able to rack up possible entry hazard damage. Finally, Rest allows Munchlax to heal itself up to full health, and Sleep Talk makes sure Munchlax isn't a complete sitting duck while sleeping.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With Thick Fat, Munchlax can actually counter Pokemon such as Ponyta and Larvesta despite its middling physical bulk, making it the best ability Munchlax can run. 236 Attack EVs help to power Munchlax up as much as possible, while 236 Special Defense EVs improve Munchlax's already great special bulk. 36 EVs in Defense and an Impish nature allow Munchlax to maximize its bulk by hitting Eviolite numbers; however, Adamant is a viable option for slightly boosting Munclax's damage output. Finally, Eviolite is used to further boost Munchlax's great bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Munchlax makes a great switch-in to most special attackers due to its great special bulk. Body Slam should be thrown around liberally unless your opponent has a Ghost-type. With Curse, Munchlax can even threaten prospective Fighting-type switch-ins, as after a Curse it can survive a Drain Punch and KO back. Finally, while RestTalk Munchlax can absorb status well, it must rely on Sleep Talk to do anything for two turns after using Rest.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can reliably switch into Fighting-types, such as Trubbish, make excellent partners to cover Munchlax's weakness. Mienfoo is valuable as a check to Pawniard, which otherwise can Knock Off Munchlax's item and set up with Swords Dance. Fletchling appreciates Munchlax's ability to deal with Magnemite and Chinchou. Lastly, Munchlax is quite vulnerable to Ghost-type Pokemon, making Choice Scarf Pawniard a good partner, as it can Pursuit trap Ghost-types.</p>"

  "Riolu": {
    "overview": "<p>As one of the few Pokemon with Prankster in Little Cup and even fewer that can warrant an offensive set, Riolu holds a specific niche as a revenge killer and late-game cleaner. With access to both Copycat and Prankster, it can fire off powerful High Jump Kicks and chain them together so the opponent cannot react. Prankster also makes sure that Riolu can set up Swords Dance before a Pokemon Taunts it. Its decently sized movepool gives it enough options to cover potential checks and a variety of threats. However, it is somewhat outclassed as a Fighting-type with Pokemon like Timburr and Mienfoo being dominant in the tier. Its Copycat chain is also easily interruptible through faster priority or Protect.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Berry Juice can be used in place of Eviolite on the bulkier set, but Riolu's bulk is so low that a lot of neutral attacks can OHKO it anyway. A Focus Sash can be used on hyper offensive teams but is otherwise outclassed by other items. Rock Slide can be used to deal with Flying-types on the switch as well as Ponyta and Larvesta. Magnet Rise can be used in order to beat Diglett and Drilbur, as Diglett now cannot trap Riolu and KO it with Earthquake. Role Play can be used on foes like Mienfoo and Foongus in order to copy their Regenerator ability and regain health on a switch. However, outside that, it has limited use. A Substitute set can be useful, but Riolu does not have the power to be threatening enough without an Attack boost. A weather setter set can be useful on teams dedicated to weather, but manual weather is generally a poor strategy anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Abra</strong>: Abra can function as one of the best checks to Riolu, as it often carries a Focus Sash and sometimes carries Protect and can OHKO with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Spritzee and Snubbull can completely counter Riolu unless it happens to run both a Roseli Berry and Iron Tail. They can switch in on almost anything else and OHKO with their Fairy-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Fast Fletchling can outspeed and outprioritize Riolu and OHKO it with Acrobatics, and other Flying-types can typically outspeed Riolu and OHKO it with their STAB moves; however, they must sometimes be wary of switching into Riolu, as High Jump Kick can 2HKO some of them with Stealth Rock up.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types like Foongus can switch into almost anything except the uncommon Zen Headbutt and Blaze Kick, and they can typically use Spore to put Riolu to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Ponyta and Larvesta</strong>: Ponyta and Larvesta check most Fighting-types and can possibly burn Riolu. If Riolu doesn't get burned, however, a +2 High Jump Kick or Rock Slide OHKOes them after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Gothita</strong>: Gothita can trap and OHKO Riolu; however, it has to be wary of a +2 High Jump Kick with entry hazards up.</p> <p><strong>Faster Priority Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Cottonee and +1 Carvanha can outspeed Riolu and cripple it, either through Encoring Riolu's setup move or revenge killing it with a priority move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Swords Dance Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance is Riolu's setup move and separates it from other Fighting-types by gaining +1 priority from Prankster. High Jump Kick should be the main STAB move, as it has the most power and is devastating after a boost. Copycat is essential because it allows Riolu to consistently spam its High Jump Kick without any drawbacks, as it will always be at +1 priority. Protect can be used in order to scout the foe and potentially copy its move, such as a Mienfoo using U-turn. This is also useful for copying moves such as Knock Off to weaken High Jump Kick switch-ins. Zen Headbutt can be the second offensive move, as it hits Croagunk, Gastly, and other Fighting-types super effectively. It's also the best option against threats like Foongus. Crunch can be an option to hit other Ghost types, specifically Pumpkaboo-XL. Cross Chop and Drain Punch are two Fighting-type moves that can be options over High Jump Kick if one prefers not to risk Riolu losing half of its HP on a miss. Cross Chop has decent power but can lack killing power if unboosted and misses more often than High Jump Kick, while Drain Punch fails to KO many foes even when boosted but provides a safer alternative for Eviolite and bulkier sets.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread maximizes Speed and Attack while investing the rest into Defense in order for Riolu to last slightly longer. It's imperative that the HP EVs be invested into the defenses instead and the HP IV lowered to 0 in order to hit exactly 19 HP for good Life Orb recoil rolls. A Life Orb is generally preferred for a regular Swords Dance set, as it lets Riolu net more KOs than an Eviolite would.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Riolu should be sure to set up when common Ghost-types like Pumpkaboo-XL and Gastly are gone and walls like Spritzee and Snubbull taken care of. It's best to set up on Pokemon that can't really OHKO Riolu or Pokemon that it forces out, such as Pawniard. One can also set up on Pokemon that have been hit with Memento, which makes Stunky an excellent partner. Due to Riolu's poor bulk, Memento support is almost always preferred to help Riolu set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stunky and Honedge are two excellent partners. Stunky takes care of Ghost-types for Riolu to sweep while also beating Spritzee and Snubbull with its Poison-type STAB moves. Honedge can easily switch in on Fletchling and Spritzee, as well as take out Abra with Pursuit. Pawniard is another option, as Pawniard can check Spritzee and Snubbull while spreading Knock Off and supporting the team with moves like Thunder Wave and Stealth Rock. Houndour is a good teammate as well, since it checks Ghost-types and can wallbreak for Riolu. Memento users make for great teammates, so Pokemon like Cottonee and, again, Stunky are excellent partners. Riolu often needs some sort of defensive core, which makes Pokemon like Ferroseed and Spritzee really good. Ponyta is also an excellent teammate, as it can burn foes like Mienfoo, which will allow Riolu to set up more easily. Gothita can be used to help eliminate Fairy-types and Croagunk, as well as other Poison-types.</p>"

      "Bulky Swords Dance Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance is the main boosting move, and High Jump Kick is the primary attacking move that can easily be spammed through Copycat. Copycat gains +1 priority through Riolu's ability Prankster, thus allowing for a chain of attacks that can otherwise make up for Riolu's poor Speed. Protect can be used in the last slot in order to scout Choice Scarf Pokemon and copy different utility moves, such as Rapid Spin, Stealth Rock, U-turn, Volt Switch, and Knock Off. However, Iron Tail can be used on a Fairy-type lure set, as with a Roseli Berry, one can set up on Snubbull and Spritzee and KO them after a boost. Riolu has a few others move it can use in the last slot, such as Crunch to stop Ghost-types and Zen Headbutt to try to KO Foongus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>If you're using a Roseli Berry, it is better to run a little bulk, as this lets Riolu survive Spritzee's +1 Moonblast most of the time, while Riolu would otherwise lose in a perfect one-on-one situation. The extra bulk investment also lets Riolu survive several weak neutral attacks, such as Omanyte's Surf. 14 Speed EVs let Riolu outspeed 13 Speed Fletchling and outprioritize it with a Copycat High Jump Kick, while an Adamant nature should be used to get as much power as possible, notably guaranteeing the OHKO on Spritzee with Stealth Rock up. An Eviolite can be used in order to create more setup opportunities at the cost of lower power. A Roseli Berry can be used if one wants to lure in Snubbull or Spritzee and KO them, as well as use them as setup bait. This can often leave Riolu open to being revenge killed by any sort of priority attack, as setting up with a Roseli Berry will leave it with only a couple of health points left.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With a Roseli Berry, it's beneficial to bait in Pokemon like Spritzee and set up a Swords Dance so Riolu can lure it in and beat it. From there, you can click High Jump Kick throughout the game to wear down checks. Riolu needs to make sure to set up after Ghost-types have already been removed, as its main sweeping move is High Jump Kick. Use Riolu to bait in Fairy-types, and then send in a teammate that appreciates the Fairy-type being gone. This set focuses less on sweeping by itself and more on clearing the way for its teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stunky is one of the best partners for Riolu, as it traps Gothita, Gastly, and Abra and can also support Riolu with Memento. It also can check Spritzee thanks to its Poison typing. Houndour is a good teammate as well, since it checks Ghost-types and can wallbreak for Riolu. Cottonee, Wynaut, and other support Pokemon are good teammates, as they can allow Riolu to get easy boosts via moves like Encore, Taunt, and Memento. Pokemon that can take advantage of Spritzee and Snubbull being gone, such as Timburr, Choice Scarf Mienfoo, Scraggy, and Carvanha, make for excellent partners. Trappers like Gothita and Diglett pair well with Riolu, as they can remove Poison-types and make sweeping easier.</p>"

  "Hippopotas": {
    "overview": "<p>Even with the nerf to weather this generation, Hippopotas is a viable Pokemon, working well as a physical wall and a sand setter. Its superb physical bulk makes it a great answer to several physical threats such as Mienfoo, Fletchling, Timburr, Archen, Drilbur, Pawniard, and Zigzagoon. Moreover, it has access to a reliable recovery move in Slack Off, making it very resilient; it also has access to moves such as Stealth Rock and Whirlwind, with the latter preventing it from being setup fodder, unlike other walls like Spritzee. However, Hippopotas has its flaws; one of them is its special bulk. While it isn't bad, it is still underwhelming, meaning special attackers such as Chinchou, Abra, Omanyte, Staryu, Foongus, and Cottonee can easily destroy Hippopotas. Overall, despite its flaws, Hippopotas is a great physical wall and a staple for sand teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used, and it works well in combination with Earthquake, which hits Steel- and Poison-types that are immune to Toxic for super effective damage. The elemental fangs can be used and offer good coverage, but most of the time Earthquake is the better option for a attacking move. Crunch hits Ghost-types hard, which is particularly valuable because Ghost-types often have Levitate and so are not reliably covered by Earthquake. Superpower offers good coverage, but is hard to fit onto a set. Curse can be used, but it doesn't help Hippopotas's special bulk, and the boosts also accumulate too slowly. A sun counter set to deal with Vulpix can be used, with a 132 HP / 20 Atk / 132 Def / 180 SpD / 20 Spe EV spread and a Careful nature. Smooth Rock can be used to extend the length of sand to eight turns, which is great for teams dedicated to sweeping with either Drilbur or Sandshrew.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Cottonee, Foongus, and Chespin wall Hippopotas and also deal heavy damage with their Grass-type STAB moves. Cottonee can also Encore Hippopotas into using a move such as Stealth Rock, giving a teammate a free switch-in.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types, particularly Omanyte, Staryu, and Corphish, are also a huge problem for Hippopotas. All of them outspeed Hippopotas and OHKO it with their Water-type STAB moves. Staryu can also remove Hippopotas's Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Hippopotas struggles against Flying-types such as Fletchling and Vullaby if it lacks Rock Tomb, and can also have difficulty with Pokemon with Levitate thanks to their immunity to Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Snover</strong>: Snover is the perfect Hippopotas counter as it changes the weather to hail and outspeeds and OHKOes Hippopotas with either of its STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is an obligatory STAB move that hits hard thanks to Hippopotas's solid base 72 Attack. Slack Off gives Hippopotas reliable recovery and assists greatly in walling opponents. Stealth Rock supports the team and puts pressure on the opposing team's switch-ins by providing important residual damage. Whirlwind is a great move as it helps Hippopotas in dealing with setup sweepers, also shuffling teams and racking up residual damage. Rock Tomb can be used instead of Whirlwind to deal with Flying-types such as Fletchling, while also lowering the opponent's Speed by one stage, which can be very helpful support for teammates.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite is the preferred item because of the additional bulk it provides, as Slack Off is already a continuous and reliable source of recovery that greatly outclasses the one-time use of Berry Juice. The given EV spread allows Hippopotas to hit Eviolite numbers and check some of the top threats in the metagame, including Magnemite and Bellsprout. A more physically defensive EV spread of 132 HP / 20 Atk / 212 Def / 100 SpD / 20 Spe with an Impish nature can be used as well if physical attackers are particularly troublesome, but being able to check Choice Scarf Magnemite is one of Hippopotas's main niches.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hippopotas works great as physical wall due to its solid 68 / 78 / 48 bulk. Furthermore, unlike other walls, it isn't setup bait. Thanks to Whirlwind, opponents that attempt to gain multiple boosts, set up Substitute, and/or Baton Pass boosts won't get past Hippopotas. Note that if Hippopotas comes in at the same time as Snover or Vulpix, sandstorm will be the dominant weather, as Hippopotas is slower than both of them. Hippopotas also works well on stall and semi-stall teams due to its great bulk and the ability to remove sun, while also doing residual damage to opponents thanks to Sand Stream.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lileep is a great teammate as it gets a 50% Special Defense boost under sandstorm and is immune to Water-type moves aimed at Hippopotas thanks to Storm Drain. Vullaby is another great partner for Hippopotas, as it can deal with the Chlorophyll sweepers that often accompany Vulpix: it resists Grass, and its Overcoat ability blocks both sand damage and Sleep Powder. Munchlax deals with the Ice-type weakness of many of Hippopotas's favorite teammates, and Hippopotas can easily tank the Fighting-type moves aimed at Munchlax. Nosepass also gets the Special Defense boost under sand, making it a great mixed wall. Tentacool is another great teammate that deals with Ice-type attacks, while also having great special bulk and the ability Liquid Ooze, which damages opponents trying to hit Hippopotas with Giga Drain. As for offensive teammates, Sand Rush users such as Drilbur and Sandshrew that can sweep with their sand-boosted Speed are good choices, as is Archen, which gets a buff to its Special Defense thanks to its Rock typing.</p>"

  "Skorupi": {
    "overview": "<p>With decent Speed and Defense stats, a good offensive movepool, and a good defensive typing, Skorupi manages to find itself a niche in the Little Cup metagame. There are many things holding Skorupi back, however. Although it has a wide offensive movepool, its Attack stat is far too low to work effectively. Even though it has high Defense, Skorupi's low Special Defense hinders its overall defensive capabilities. Finally, although Skorupi sports an interesting offensive typing, that typing also leaves it hampered by weaknesses to common Psychic-, Flying-, Rock-, and Fire-type moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Although Skorupi has a variety of other options, it is typically too weak to utilize them effectively. It has access to a multitude of boosting moves, including Swords Dance, Accupressure, Hone Claws, and Agility. Brick Break can be used to beat threats such as Pawniard and Aron, but Skorupi would rather use its defensive moves most of the time. A Sniper set with Cross Poison, Night Slash, and either Scope Lens or Razor Claw can be used to some success, as a Sniper critical hit amounts to a 2.25x damage boost, which is more than a super effective hit. Whirlwind can be used to reliably phaze physical sweepers with its great Defense stat, as well as to spread Toxic Spikes status. Rock Tomb can be used to deter Flying- and Fire-type opponents, while also lowering the Speed of others. Lastly, Toxic is an alternate option to Toxic Spikes for immediate status spreading, but it does not support Skorupi's teammates as effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Fletchling, Doduo, Archen, and Vullaby can all outspeed and dispose of Skorupi with their strong STAB attacks. Additionally, they are immune to Toxic Spikes, and many even have the ability to Defog them away.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon such as Pawniard, Honedge, and Aron are immune to Toxic Spikes and can wall Skorupi quite effectively. Honedge should be wary of Knock Off, however.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Archen, Dwebble, and Onix can easily take Skorupi out with their super effective STAB moves, while also resisting Skorupi's go-to STAB move, Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Abra</strong>: Abra is a great check to Skorupi, as it is immune to Toxic Spikes and can OHKO Skorupi with a Psychic. Additionally, it cannot be OHKOed if holding a Focus Sash, which furthers its ability to check Skorupi.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Growlithe, Ponyta, Larvesta, and Vulpix can all OHKO Skorupi with their Fire-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Croagunk and Stunky can absorb Skorupi's Toxic Spikes as well as resist both of its attacking moves, rendering Skorupi nearly useless. Setup sweeper variants of Croagunk, such as Bulk Up and Nasty Plot, are especially threatening, as Skorupi cannot touch them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes is for spreading status throughout the opposing team and for limiting the switch-ins your opponent can make. Normally, only one layer should be set due to the fast-paced nature of Little Cup. Taunt is a very valuable move that allows Skorupi to block other entry hazard setters, such as Ferroseed and Dwebble. Poison Jab is a reliable STAB move that allows Skorupi to hit Fairy- and Grass-types, most notably Cottonee, hard. Lastly, Knock Off is a great utility move that can remove Eviolite and Life Orb as well as do a great deal of damage to Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 EVs go into HP for a decent amount of bulk, while 36 EVs in both Attack and Defense give a small boost for both stats. The last 236 EVs are invested in Speed and, when paired with a Jolly nature, allow Skorupi to hit 17 Speed, which is a very valuable Speed tier for a Taunt user. The ability of choice, Battle Armor, prevents any surprise critical hits. Lastly, Eviolite bolsters defenses, furthering Skorupi's defensive presence.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Skorupi can be used as a sort of suicide lead, since it isn't providing much offensive leverage unless your opponent carries Fairy-types. As a lead, Skorupi likes to Taunt other leads and gain momentum by spreading status amongst your opponent's team via Toxic Spikes. It should watch out for STAB Rock-type attacks, however. If you have set up a layer of Toxic Spikes, you can go for a Knock Off, Skorupi's go-to utility move, to cripple your foe. Finally, always try to stay away from special attackers, as Skorupi's ability to take special hits isn't quite as good as its ability to take physical ones because its Special Defense is very low.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gothita makes an exceptional teammate, as it traps and eliminates any Poison-type Pokemon that try to absorb Skorupi's Toxic Spikes. Ground-types such as Diglett work well to beat opposing Rock- and Fire-type Pokemon. Chinchou makes a great teammate, checking threatening Flying- and Fire-type Pokemon for Skorupi. Munchlax makes for an excellent teammate, as it resists Fire-type moves thanks to Thick Fat and can take special moves for Skorupi. Additionally, it can Pursuit trap threatening Psychic-types for Skorupi, while Skorupi walls Fighting-types in return. Rock-types such as Onix and Aron make good teammates, as they can cover Skorupi's Flying- and Fire-type weaknesses. Additionally, Onix is a cool partner for Skorupi because its Stealth Rock complements Skorupi's Toxic Spikes. Rapid Spinners such as Drilbur and Staryu make good teammates to spin away hazards that bother Skorupi. Additionally, Drilbur and Staryu can handle the Fire- and Rock-types that might give Skorupi trouble with their STAB attacks.</p>"

  "Croagunk": {
    "overview": "<p>Croagunk returns for the third generation in a row as an excellent Pokemon in LC. Croagunk can check a lot of threats at once, meaning that Croagunk will often find its way onto a team. Croagunk’s typing grants it resistances to Bug-, Rock-, Poison-, Grass-, Fighting-, and Dark-type moves, and its ability, Dry Skin, grants it an immunity to Water-type moves as well. Croagunk’s resistances allow it to counter and check a slew of top tier Pokemon such as Carvanha, Mienfoo, and Tirtouga, among others. In addition, Croagunk is the only Fighting-type in LC to be hit neutrally by Fairy-type attacks, so it can severely weaken Cottonee and Spritzee, LC's premier Fairy-types. However, its bulk and attacking stats can be underwhelming at times, often allowing neutral attacks to 2HKO or severely weaken Croagunk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fake Out is an option, but it is quite weak, and most of the time, Croagunk has better moves to use. Rock Slide can hit incoming Flying- and Fire-types, particularly Larvesta. Earthquake can also hit Fire-types and is more useful for hitting Ponyta than Rock Slide is. Ice Punch hits the Flying- and Ground-types that often switch into Croagunk for super effective damage. Sludge Bomb can be used on the physical utility set in order to 2HKO physically defensive Spritzee. Icy Wind or Bulldoze can be used on the Nasty Plot or Bulk Up sets respectively in order to have a safer way to set up by forcing a switch. A Substitute + Focus Punch set can be used, or even just Substitute. Bullet Punch can be used as a safer option than Sucker Punch, but it is largely outclassed by Vacuum Wave. Poison Touch can be used as an alternate ability, if you want to feign Dry Skin. The chance to poison helps to weaken switch-ins as well. A Work Up set can also be used on teams that can make up for Croagunk's Speed issues.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Koffing or Grimer can easily switch in on Croagunk, resisting both of its STAB types. Koffing can burn Croagunk, while Grimer can hit hard with a Fire Punch and doesn't mind Knock Off thanks to Sticky Hold.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Slowpoke make great counters to Croagunk, hitting it with their 4x super effective STAB moves. Abra is a nice check as well, although it has to be wary of switching in as a Knock Off followed by a Vacuum Wave KOes it. Abra can also hold a Focus Sash and stop Croagunk from attempting a sweep.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Hippopotas and Drilbur can easily switch in and immediately threaten Croagunk. Diglett struggles to switch in, but it can easily trap and KO Croagunk.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Fletchling can outspeed and KO Croagunk with its STAB attacks. Vullaby, Mantyke, and Archen also make excellent switch-ins, as none of them fear anything that Croagunk has to offer aside from a possible poison from Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types resist Croagunk's STAB attacks and can usually threaten it with a burn. However, most of them cannot switch in directly, as a Knock Off will either cripple or outright OHKO them.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types hit Croagunk hard due to Dry Skin. Larvesta and Ponyta can threaten it with a burn, and the former resists Fighting-type moves. Vulpix is also a threat as the sun it brings with Drought hurts Croagunk, and Croagunk can do nothing to it in return.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is one of the best moves in the game, and it allows Croagunk to pose a threat to many of its switch-ins. Sludge Bomb is Croagunk’s most powerful move in this set, hitting Fairy-types super effectively, allowing Croagunk to 2HKO Spritzee. Vacuum Wave is useful for dealing with faster Pokemon such as Carvanha, Bunnelby, and Pawniard, as well as for picking off faster weakened threats. Drain Punch is used as it gives Croagunk a means of recovering health and allows Croagunk to beat Rock-, Ice-, and Normal-types with ease. Sucker Punch lets Croagunk heavily damage Gothita, Abra, and Gastly before they attack.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Equpping an Eviolite gives Croagunk some much needed bulk, and it works really well with Drain Punch recovery. The EVs are distributed between the defensive and offensive stats in order to be as efficient as possible, although Croagunk has to sacrifice its Speed. Dry Skin allows Croagunk to wall Carvanha and Tirtouga, as well as be able to switch into Chinchou’s Scalds.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Croagunk should be switching on the Pokemon that it walls, such as Tirtouga, Carvanha, Scraggy, Mienfoo, and Timburr. It cannot be expected to be a huge threat to opposing teams, as it can be easily worn down if the opponent repeatedly forces it in. Croagunk should be used as a glue Pokemon to stop Pokemon such as Tirtouga from sweeping your team. If Pokemon such as Carvanha or Tirtouga are on the opposing team, it is best to play reservedly, keeping Croagunk ready so that the threat cannot set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As it's often used as a glue Pokemon, Croagunk generally offers more to the team than the team can offer to it. It does, however, need good switch-ins to Psychic-, Fire-, Ground-, and Flying-type moves from the likes of Abra, Larvesta, Drilbur, Archen, and Fletchling. Rock- and Steel-types make great partners as they resist Flying-type moves. Tirtouga also likes Croagunk's Knock Off support. Rock- and Water-types can take on the Fire-types that Croagunk hates. Slowpoke can handle Ground- and Fire-types, making it a good partner. Other Fighting-types such as Mienfoo or Scraggy appreciate Croagunk's ability to cripple Fighting-type switch-ins with Knock Off as well as being a good switch-in to Fairy-types. Pokemon that can pass it health are really beneficial, as Croagunk has no recovery outside of Dry Skin and the weak Drain Punch. Spritzee, Lickitung, and Ferroseed make good partners, as Croagunk can switch in on Fighting- and Poison-type moves for them.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Drain Punch is Croagunk's main STAB move, and it allows Croagunk to heal itself throughout the match. Drain Punch also checks Scraggy, Tirtouga, and Carvanha. Gunk Shot is the strongest attack that Croagunk has, and is Croagunk's best move for beating Spritzee. Gunk Shot 2HKOes Spritzee more often than not, and in tight situations, it can be fallen back on for its poison chance, although a 30% chance is not all that huge. After losing its Eviolite, Spritzee is OHKOed by Gunk Shot. Gunk Shot is also the best attack against Timburr and Mienfoo. Sucker Punch lets Croagunk avoid being revenge-killed by Gothita. Knock Off is the best support move that Croagunk can offer. Bulk Up is used in the last slot in order to set up against Timburr, Trubbish, or any other Pokemon that cannot harm Croagunk. Fletchling fails to OHKO Croagunk at full health after a boost, and this can be used to lure a threat out to OHKO it with a +1 Gunk Shot. However this is generally risky, and relies heavily on Croagunk being at full health. Poison Jab can be used over Gunk Shot if accuracy is an issue, as Gunk Shot only hits 80% of the time, but the loss in power is noticeable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>36 Speed EVs let Croagunk outspeed Spritzee, allowing for the possible 2HKO with Gunk Shot. 36 Speed EVs also let Croagunk outspeed Honedge, Ferroseed, and Porygon. 188 Attack EVs leave Croagunk as strong as possible on the physical side, allowing for multiple 2HKOs and OHKOs in order for Croagunk to act as a blanket check to troublesome Pokemon. The remainder is thrown into HP and the defenses to give Croagunk some needed bulk, which allows it to survive important attacks such as Spritzee's Moonblast, which fails to 2HKO Croagunk with the given EV spread. Eviolite boosts Croagunk's defenses even further, and is more beneficial than any other item.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Croagunk should be switching in on walls and threats that cannot really harm it, such as Timburr or Spritzee. Other common Pokemon to switch into include Mienfoo, Tirtouga, and Carvanha. This set should be used similarly to the mixed utility set, checking a variety of Pokemon. Croagunk should be used conservatively, as it can check a variety of threats to a team. If Pokemon such as Carvanha, Mienfoo, Tirtouga, Timburr, Spritzee, or Cottonee are still alive, keep Croagunk safe in order to revenge kill or check them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set appreciates more support than the Utility set. Aromatherapy Spritzee is a great partner, as Croagunk does not like being burned. Scraggy is an excellent partner, as it appreciates Knock Off support, as well as Croagunk's ability to beat Spritzee, Timburr, and Mienfoo. Croagunk does not like Ghost-types all that much, making Dark-type Pokemon such as Pawniard good partners. Croagunk also needs a teammate that can switch into Ground-type moves, as Drilbur can easily switch in on a move like Fake Out or Gunk Shot. Fletchling forces Croagunk out, so Archen or Chinchou make great partners.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot allows Croagunk to punch holes through common Pokemon. At +2, Sludge Bomb OHKOes Spritzee, 2HKOes Vullaby, and 2HKOes Timburr. Porygon is also 2HKOed at +2, as are other more stall-based Pokemon, such as Lileep. Vacuum Wave forces Pawniard out and helps check Pokemon such as Tirtouga or Carvanha. Shadow Ball is Croagunk's best option against Gastly. Focus Blast lets Croagunk heavily damage Porygon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs are optimized to OHKO and 2HKO threats to team members after a boost, such as Vullaby or Timburr. A +2 Sludge Bomb 2HKOes Vullaby and can often OHKO Spritzee, allowing Fighting-type teammates to sweep unimpeded. 36 Speed EVs allow Croagunk to outspeed minimum Speed Spritzee, allowing for the 2HKO without a boost. Eviolite is the preferred item to avoid OHKOs.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Croagunk can set up on common Pokemon such as Chinchou, Trubbish, and most Fighting-types, specifically Timburr or Mienfoo. One of the best and easiest ways to set up is to take advantage of Croagunk's excellent typing and slew of resistances. Forcing out Pokemon such as Cottonee or Pawniard is ideal. Croagunk can also come in on Pawniard and Tirtouga, two big offensive threats, and either set up or straight out KO them. In a pinch, Croagunk can also perform as a glue, like the Mixed Utility set, but it is outclassed in this regard by the aforementioned set, and the lack of bulk really hurts Croagunk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Something that can beat Drilbur is an excellent teammate, as Croagunk cannot beat Drilbur itself except for on a predicted switch with Icy Wind. Pokemon that hate Timburr, Vullaby, or Spritzee make good teammates with Croagunk, as Croagunk can eliminate them to sweep. This means that Pokemon such as Scraggy or Pawniard make great teammates. A good switch-in to Fletchling is always needed, making Archen a good teammate. Something that can set up Stealth Rock is also an ideal teammate, as some of the Pokemon that Croagunk can check, such as Vullaby, are much easier to handle when Stealth Rock is up.</p>"

  "Finneon": {
    "overview": "<p>Finneon is one of only a handful of Pokemon in LC to have access to the move Defog without being weak to Stealth Rock. With its decent bulk and high Speed, Finneon is able to use the move well. Finneon also has access to U-turn, meaning after it has cleared the field of entry hazards, it can preserve momentum by switching out. Although Finneon can use a fast Defog to support its team, a lack of recovery prevents it from being able to repeatedly remove entry hazards. It also finds itself outclassed in other roles by Pokemon such as Chinchou, meaning its set can be predictable. This is further compounded by its limited offensive presence, as it has access to few special attacking moves along with a mediocre Special Attack stat. However, Finneon is able to take on opposing Stealth Rock users such as Drilbur and Archen quite well, meaning it can keep entry hazards off the field better than other Defoggers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Finneon can use a Choice Scarf set, but it is entirely outclassed by Chinchou. Although Finneon appreciates the recovery from Berry Juice, an Eviolite set can take a +2 Sucker Punch from Pawniard and retaliate with Hidden Power Fighting. Finneon has access to Ice Beam, but it is too weak to 2HKO most Grass-types. Finneon can also use Hidden Power Grass to hit Water-type Pokemon; however, it normally prefers the coverage given by Hidden Power Fighting. Finneon also has access to Toxic, which can be used to wear down walls; however, most walls are paired with a cleric. Finneon can be used as a Swift Swim sweeper, but is outclassed by other Pokemon in that role such as Omanyte and Horsea. Finneon can support its teammates with either Rain Dance or Tailwind, and use U-turn to bring in a teammate that benefits from these moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Ferroseed, Cottonee, and Foongus take little damage from Finneon's attacks, even Ice Beam. They are all able to inflict heavy damage on Finneon with their Grass-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon immune to Water</strong>: Pokemon with the abilities Dry Skin and Water Absorb, such as Croagunk, Frillish, and Mantyke, are all able to come in on Finneon's Scald, in addition to resisting U-turn and Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Walls</strong>: Bulky Pokemon that can heal off Scald burns, such as Spritzee and Munchlax, can stall Finneon out indefinitely.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Chinchou doesn't care about any of Finneon's moves and can threaten it out with Volt Switch. Magnemite also OHKOes Finneon with Volt Switch, and although it takes neutral damage from Scald, it can come in on a Defog and threaten Finneon out.</p> <p><strong>Pawniard</strong>: Although Pawniard must be wary of Hidden Power Fighting, it can come in on a Defog and get an Attack boost.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon that don't mind Scald, particularly Croagunk and Timburr, can set up on Finneon easily.</p> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: Trace Porygon can come in on Finneon and trace Storm Drain, meaning it will be immune to Scald, in addition to receiving a Special Attack boost from it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog is the main reason to use Finneon, as it clears all entry hazards on both sides of the field. Scald is capable of burning physical attackers and is a reliable STAB move, while U-turn allows Finneon to gain momentum after using Defog and act as a pivot. Hidden Power Fighting allows Finneon to 2HKO Eviolite Pawniard and OHKO variants without Eviolite.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>232 Speed EVs with a Timid nature give Finneon 17 Speed, enabling it to outspeed Dwebble and Pawniard and tie with Archen and Drilbur. 48 Special Attack EVs make Finneon's attacks hit harder, while the remaining EVs are distributed into Finneon's defenses, enabling it to take hits. Berry Juice is best for Finneon, as it has no reliable recovery move and will need to take hits in order to perform its role. Storm Drain is Finneon's most useful ability; as it prevents damage from Water-type moves, and gives Finneon a handy Special Attack boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Finneon can be switched in on Water-type attacks from foes such as Tirtouga and Corphish; from there, it can use Defog to remove entry hazards. After removing entry hazards, Finneon can use U-turn in order to bring a teammate in. Alternatively, if the foe is a physical attacker or weak to Water-type moves, Finneon can use Scald in order to burn it. However, it's important to remember that Pokemon such as Timburr don't mind being burned thanks to Guts. If there is a Pawniard on your foe's team, it may switch in as you use Defog, triggering Defiant and giving it an Attack boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon weak to entry hazards really enjoy Finneon's presence, as it can clear away Stealth Rock, enabling teammates such as Fletchling, Ponyta, Larvesta, Archen, Magnemite, and Tirtouga to come in more easily. Diglett and Drilbur are also good teammates for Finneon, as they can deal with Electric-types such as Magnemite and Chinchou. Foongus is a good teammate for Finneon, as it covers its Electric- and Grass-type weaknesses while Finneon can come in on the Fire- and Ice-type moves that threaten Foongus. Foongus can also put a foe to sleep with Spore that Finneon can come in and use Defog on. Pokemon that are weak to Water can lure a Water-type move that Finneon can come in on for free. Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta can deal with the bulky Grass-types that Finneon can't deal with, such as Cottonee, Ferroseed, and Foongus. They also appreciate Finneon's ability to remove entry hazards and check opposing Water-types. Finneon needs a teammate that can beat Pawniard so that it can Defog freely, so Mienfoo and Timburr are suitable for this role.</p>"

  "Mantyke": {
    "overview": "<p>Mantyke is a unique Pokemon, as it is an amazing special wall that also has an offensive presence. It resists a good amount of types and has a very crucial immunity to Ground, giving it nice synergy with a decent number of Pokemon. To couple with Mantyke's defensive aspects, it boasts two nice offensive STAB moves in Hydro Pump and Air Slash, which can threaten many common threats in the tier. While it doesn't have the best abilities, both of them allow for Mantyke to play its various roles much more efficiently. The biggest downside to Mantyke is its crippling Electric-type weakness, despite its amazing Special Defense. It is also weak to Stealth Rock and has lackluster HP and Defense stats, though those are easily overshadowed by Mantyke's prowess as a special wall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Surf can be run as a primary Water-type STAB move, however, Mantyke misses Hydro Pump's sheer power and Scald's potential to inflict burns. Mantyke can use Agility over Rain Dance and still get a Speed boost, but it misses out on the boost in power of Water-type attacks and loses the Speed boost upon switching out. Ice Beam and Signal Beam can be used as other coverage moves on an offensive set. For a more supportive role, Tailwind can be used to aid teammates. Mantyke can also run Haze to surprise setup sweepers and eliminate their stat boosts. Alternatively, to better combat specially oriented setup sweepers, Mantyke can run Mirror Coat to take advantage of its absurd Special Defense stat.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types, such as Chinchou, Magnemite, and Elekid, have a 4x type advantage on Mantyke and can threaten it with a STAB Electric-type move. Chinchou in particular is able to take on Mantyke, as it resists Water- and Flying-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Users</strong>: Sturdy users, such as Magnemite, Tirtouga, and Dwebble, have no problem taking a hit from and dealing back damage to Mantyke. Pokemon with Shell Smash and Sturdy can always set up if there are no entry hazards on the field and OHKO Mantyke with a STAB Rock-type move.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Most Water-types, including Slowpoke and Chinchou, take little damage from any of Mantyke's attacks. Chinchou especially threatens Mantyke, as it resists both of Mantyke's STAB moves and can deliver devastating attacks in return.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Hard hitting physical attackers such as Pawniard and Tirtouga can beat Mantyke easily by Knocking Off its item. Tirtouga can also threaten Mantyke with a STAB Rock-type move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rain Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rain Dance gives Mantyke amazing opportunities as an offensive Pokemon, both doubling its already decent Speed and boosting the power of its main STAB move, Hydro Pump, to ridiculous levels. Even outside of rain, Hydro Pump leaves huge dents in Pokemon that do not resist it. Air Slash is the secondary STAB move Mantyke should use, allowing it to take on both Grass- and Fighting-type Pokemon. Either Hidden Power Ground or Grass should be used in the final moveslot; both have their advantages depending on the situation. Hidden Power Ground nails Electric-type Pokemon extremely hard, its primary targets being weakened Chinchou and Magnemite. On the other hand, Hidden Power Grass nails Shell Smash Tirtouga much harder than Hidden Power Ground while still doing respectable damage to opposing Chinchou and Slowpoke.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs optimize Mantyke's Special Attack and Speed, allowing it to take advantage of the set to deal massive amounts of damage to opposing Pokemon when coupled with a Modest nature. 36 EVs are placed into Defense, giving Mantyke a better shot at surviving certain physical attacks, such as Drilbur's Rock Slide and Pawniard's Sucker Punch. 36 Defense EVs also hit an Eviolite number if Mantyke is holding it. Running a Life Orb allows Mantyke to hit much harder, though it is more difficult to set up rain, whereas with an Eviolite, Mantyke can set up rain very easily at the expense of some power. If Life Orb is being held, it is wise to run no HP investment and only 9 HP IVs, as it allows Mantyke to hit 19 HP and causes it to only take 1 HP from Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The first priority when attempting to sweep with Mantyke is to remove Pokemon such as Chinchou, Magnemite, and Pokemon with Sturdy, as they can stop Mantyke cold in its tracks. After such threats are removed, Mantyke can set up rain to allow it to plow through opposing teams. The best time to set up rain is against Pokemon that Mantyke can scare out, namely Fighting- and Ground-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr. Mantyke can also set up rain against Drilbur if Stealth Rock is not up. However, if Mantyke has taken prior Stealth Rock damage, Drilbur is able to OHKO it. Another group of Pokemon that Mantyke can set up rain on would be Fire-type Pokemon that lack an Electric-type move, namely Larvesta and, to a lesser extent, Darumaka. However, Mantyke does not need rain to function, as it can still hit opposing Pokemon for a lot of damage on anticipated switches.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Diglett is a nice teammate for Mantyke, as it is able to dispose of threats such as Chinchou and Pawniard while still being able to set up Stealth Rock. Drilbur is another Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock to benefit Mantyke, but unlike Diglett, Drilbur can spin away opposing Stealth Rock as well, which benefits Mantyke immensely. Ferroseed is a more defensive teammate for Mantyke, being able to take advantage of the rain to set up entry hazards and dispose of Chinchou for Mantyke. Pawniard can also aide in Mantyke's sweep by removing Eviolite from opposing walls, namely Porygon and Slowpoke.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rest keeps Mantyke alive and able to act as a great special wall for large portions of the battle. Sleep Talk lets Mantyke potentially attack opposing Pokemon after it has healed up and while it is still asleep. Scald damages opposing Pokemon and has the chance to cripple physical attackers by burning them. Air Slash prevents Mantyke from being entirely walled by Grass-types such as Pumpkaboo and Foongus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>156 EVs are placed into HP to allow for Mantyke to have more longevity. 196 EVs are placed into Defense, while 116 are put into Special Defense, increasing Mantyke' overall bulk. The EV spread's focus stays more on Defense, as Mantyke already has a ridiculously high Special Defense stat. The final 36 EVs are put into Speed, allowing Mantyke to outspeed a good deal of Pokemon, most notably Pumpkaboo.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mantyke should always take advantage of situations in which it can use Rest in order to keep it effective as a bulky wall. Removing Electric-type Pokemon that threaten Mantyke is a good idea, though not entirely necessary. The only issue with not disposing of them is the opponent gaining momentum with Volt Switch, which can be detrimental.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ferroseed is a great partner for defensive Mantyke, as it can set up entry hazards and is a safe switch-in to the Electric-type attacks that threaten Mantyke. In addition, Mantyke can take the Fire-type attacks that threaten Ferroseed. Both Magnemite and Lileep also synergize nicely with Mantyke while providing an offensive option to remove threats. As a more defensive partner, Chinchou works wonders in tandem with Mantyke, as Volt Absorb makes it immune to Electric-type attacks. Mantyke is, in return, immune to Ground-type attacks. Chinchou also has access to Heal Bell, meaning that Mantyke doesn't have to be as reliant on Sleep Talk to attack. Drilbur helps alleviate the entry hazard issues Mantyke faces while still being able to beat most Electric-type Pokemon for Mantyke. Pawniard is able to remove defensive threats through the use of Knock Off, leaving them in range of Mantyke's Scald or as Rest fodder. Mantyke on its own works best on more defensively inclined teams, providing a solid switch-in to many special attackers, namely Abra. Offensive teams do not appreciate the drop in momentum of using Mantyke.</p>"

  "Snover": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its ability, Snow Warning, Snover is one of the only two Pokemon in LC with a completely accurate Blizzard. Snow Warning is also useful for overriding other weather effects, and thereby easily shutting down Sand Rush, Chlorophyll, and Swift Swim users. The problem is that these weather abusers aren't very common. Furthermore, with the Base Power nerf to Blizzard, Snover is less potent than previously. Finally, it is difficult to use Snover reliably when Fletchling, one of its biggest threats, is so common in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Energy Ball is a more powerful option which can be used over Giga Drain, although Energy Ball doesn't get any notable KOs that Giga Drain doesn't. Leech Seed is an option on the Eviolite set, although it's usually better to use Giga Drain. Don't use Synthesis, as it only restores 25% HP in hail. Hidden Power Fighting is an option if you're trying to lure Pawniard, but Eviolite Pawniard isn't OHKOed by it and Choice Scarf Pawniard outspeeds any Snover variant. Shadow Ball is an option to 2HKO Honedge, but its usefulness ends there as most other Ghost-types are hit just as hard or harder by Blizzard. Water Pulse can be used in place of Hidden Power in order to hit Fire-types, but it's inferior to Hidden Power Rock because it misses the OHKO on Larvesta and it misses the 2HKO on Vulpix.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: As long as they don't come in on a Hidden Power Rock, Ponyta, Houndour, and Larvesta can switch into Snover without a problem and take advantage of its 4x weakness to Fire. Larvesta in particular can capitalize on the forced switch by using U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Vulpix</strong>: Vulpix not only poses a large threat to Snover with its Fire-type STAB moves, but also removes the hail with Drought.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Magnemite and Pawniard can switch in on Snover's STAB moves and immediately threaten it with their super effective Steel-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fighting-types</strong>: Bulky Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr can easily tank a Blizzard and then KO with their Fighting-type STAB moves. In particular, Timburr can revenge kill Choice Scarf Snover quite easily with Mach Punch, which does around 80%.</p> <p><strong>Tentacool</strong>: Tentacool resists Blizzard, and if Snover uses Giga Drain, Tentacool's Liquid Ooze will hurt Snover in the process. Tentacool can then threaten Snover with a super effective STAB Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Fletchling</strong>: Fletchling easily revenge kills Snover with priority Acrobatics. The only thing it has to fear is Ice Shard from Choice Scarf Snover.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blizzard is the best STAB move on a hail inducer. It hits a lot of the tier, most notably Flying-types, extremely hard. Giga Drain hits Water-type switch-ins, healing Snover in the process. Ice Shard might seem a bit strange on a Choice Scarf set, but it provides Snover with a method of defeating opposing priority users that have been weakened, specifically Fletchling. The last slot provides coverage against common switch-ins to Blizzard. Hidden Power Fire nails opposing Steel-types, particularly Ferroseed. It is also the most effective choice for dealing with opposing Snover. Hidden Power Rock hits opposing Fire-types, such as Larvesta and Vulpix, on the switch. Hidden Power Ground hits Magnemite the hardest. It also hits a mix of Fire- and Steel-types super effectively, including Ponyta, Vulpix, and Honedge, but it lacks super effective coverage on Ferroseed, Bronzor, and Larvesta.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a boosting nature gives Snover 14 Speed, allowing it to hit 21 Speed with Choice Scarf and outspeed the unboosted metagame. Special Attack is then maxed out to make Snover's attacks hit as hard as possible. A Naive nature increases Speed at the expense of Special Defense, meaning that Snover must try to avoid special attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Snover is best used late-game when it can safely spam Blizzard. A prediction gone wrong early- or mid-game can spell doom for Snover. However, it can revenge kill reasonably well. If you bring Snover in on something weak to Ice-type attacks, such as Archen, while your opponent has an Ice-resistant Pokemon in reserve, prediction becomes important. Use Giga Drain or the appropriate Hidden Power to punish the switch-in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As it is weak to Stealth Rock, Snover appreciates the help of a Rapid Spin or Defog user. Fortunately, many of these Pokemon pair well with Snover. Mold Breaker Drilbur can easily take on the Fire- and Steel-types that trouble Snover, including Pokemon with Levitate such as Bronzor. Vullaby can Defog entry hazards away and remove Eviolites with Knock Off, softening up the opposition for Snover. Staryu can take on the Fire-types that give Snover trouble. Archen provides Defog support and helps wall Flying-types such as Fletchling, which are a huge problem for Snover.</p>"
      },
      "Eviolite": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blizzard is a very powerful STAB move that has perfect accuracy in hail. Giga Drain is the best option for a secondary STAB move, as it keeps Snover healthy throughout the match and nails Water-types that resist Blizzard. Ice Shard is a useful move, picking off opposing Pokemon that are faster than Snover and have been significantly weakened. Keep in mind that Eviolite Snover can't take on max Speed Fletchling with Ice Shard as Snover is slower. The Hidden Power of choice goes in the last slot. This choice depends on Snover's teammates and what types of Pokemon are the biggest problem for your team. Hidden Power Rock hits most Fire-types hard. Hidden Power Ground nails Magnemite, and Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types, especially Ferroseed, extremely hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The investment in bulk gives Snover even numbers in its defenses, taking the best advantage of Eviolite. The remaining EVs are placed in both attacking stats, with Special Attack being maxed. As Snover needs investment in both offensive and defensive stats, a Speed-lowering nature is used. The EV spread also allows for any Hidden Power listed to be used without trouble.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bulky Snover makes use of its typing to repeatedly switch into Water-, Electric-, and Ground-types and heal up with Giga Drain. This makes it an especially good switch-in for Chinchou, as Chinchou rarely carries Hidden Power Fire. This Snover variant can also bluff being Choice-locked, as many people expect Snover to be a Choice Scarf variant. For example, it can surprise Water-types with Giga Drain if the opponent thinks Snover is locked into Blizzard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Snover appreciates a Rapid Spin or Defog user, such as Drilbur, Vullaby, or Staryu. Archen is a good partner as it carries Defog and can take on Pokemon such as Fletchling and Houndour. Snover can take on the Water- and Electric-types that threaten Archen. Fighting-types are a problem for Snover, so Flying-types such as Fletchling and Doduo make good offensive teammates.</p>"

  "Tepig": {
    "overview": "<p>Tepig is a brutal attacker that utilizes powerful moves with large drawbacks. Due to being weak to Stealth Rock, using Life Orb, relying on recoil-heavy moves, and having lackluster stats, Tepig's impact is limited but intense. However, more powerful attackers such as Darumaka give Tepig competition, as Darumaka hits far harder than Tepig due to Hustle and has U-turn to preserve momentum, with Tepig's saving grace being its reliability and ability to hit Water-types super effectively with Wild Charge. Tepig's better coverage options also let it edge out Ponyta as an all-out attacker despite Tepig being slower and lacking recovery.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tepig has access to some utility options such as Will-O-Wisp and Taunt, but it is usually better off with an all-out attacker set. Hidden Power Grass provides savvy coverage versus Rock / Water and Rock / Ground types such as Tirtouga and Onix, which can otherwise wall Tepig decently with their defensive sets. Unfortunately, this forces Tepig to go mixed and thus run a Naive nature, worsening its matchup against Staryu and Skrelp. Zen Headbutt gives Tepig the ability to muscle past the likes of Timburr and Koffing. Additionally, Tepig can don a Choice Scarf to outspeed unboosted Pokemon and reduce the recoil damage it takes; however, this makes Tepig incredibly weak and prone to being taken advantage of.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Although Tepig possesses moderate Speed, faster Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Staryu, Archen, and Choice Scarf Magnemite are fairly common and able to revenge kill it easily.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers</strong>: Due to its poor defenses, Tepig is vulnerable to powerful priority attacks, such as Fletchling's Acrobatics, Pawniard's Sucker Punch, and Corphish's Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Tepig is already easily worn down by recoil damage, but entry hazards put Tepig on even more of a timer and limit how often it can switch.</p> <p><strong>Hippopotas</strong>: Hippopotas is unbelievably bulky, so it can stall out Tepig and either set up Stealth Rock or OHKO it with Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is Tepig's most powerful attack, with few Pokemon truly wanting to take it; only Pokemon that resist Fire can switch into it well. Head Smash complements Flare Blitz's coverage and power, OHKOing walls such as Ponyta and Vullaby after Stealth Rock. Sucker Punch gives Tepig the ability to pick off weakened Pokemon and can often be used to finish off Pokemon that dared to switch into it. The last slot is dedicated to rounding out Tepig's offensive presence, with Wild Charge allowing Tepig to obliterate all Water-types except Goldeen and Chinchou, and Superpower giving Tepig a way to remove Porygon, the rarer Lileep, and other Rock-types. However, Flame Charge is another option to consider, as it puts Tepig into a Speed tier above the unboosted metagame, giving it more time to launch brawny attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb provides Tepig with incredible power and allows it to switch moves, making it superior to Choice Band. Due to Tepig being weak to Stealth Rock, using Life Orb, and employing recoil-intensive moves, Blaze makes Tepig's inevitable low-HP final hurrah hit insanely hard. The EVs and nature are tailored to maximize Tepig's strength while also outspeeding or Speed tying all common Water-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tepig should never switch into an attack; rather, it should come in off a slow U-turn or to revenge kill opposing Pokemon. Tepig's health is a valuable resource, so strive to clear entry hazards from the field and remove the opponent's Stealth Rock setter early. Flare Blitz will do a large amount of damage to everything bar the uncommon dependable Pokemon that resist Fire, so it should be used most often.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removers, such as Staryu, Drilbur, Archen, and Vullaby, are great for keeping up Tepig's longevity, as Tepig has to worry enough about recoil as is without adding Stealth Rock damage into the mix. Tepig appreciates all forms of entry hazard support, especially Stealth Rock setters such as Archen, Dwebble, Tirtouga, and Pawniard, as the residual damage helps Tepig bust through most of its common switch-ins. Toxic Spikes setters such as Skrelp and Omanyte also reliably provide extra chip damage on the foe, making it easier for Tepig to shatter through opposing teams of all varieties. Both Dwebble and Omanyte also have access to Spikes, which turns many 2HKOs into OHKOs for Tepig. Sticky Web support from Surskit or Spinarak gives Tepig the ability to outspeed all of the grounded metagame, making it much harder for the opposing team to deal with. Grass-types such as Snivy and Cottonee can make quick work of the Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types that pester Tepig. Pumpkaboo-S is especially synergistic, as it provides spinblocking support to help keep entry hazards on the field, securing OHKOs for Tepig. Archen, Fletchling, and Cottonee all have access to Tailwind and can use it to allow Tepig to outspeed everything for several turns and potentially pickup a handful of KOs. Lastly, Buneary has access to Healing Wish and Thunder Wave, which can give Tepig a second chance and cripple faster Pokemon for Tepig.</p>"

  "Oshawott": {
    "overview": "<p>Oshawott finds its niche as the only Water-type special attacker with access to non-STAB Air Slash, which allows it to lure in and remove Croagunk without having to run Hidden Power. Oshawott really does have some power behind it; its Hydro Pump 2HKOes Porygon, and it hits the same benchmarks as special Carvanha. Unfortunately, Oshawott is slow. An overreliance on Life Orb means Oshawott lacks bulk for the most part; if it does not OHKO or 2HKO its switch-ins, it will likely be either severely crippled or forced to switch out. It also struggles to take on users of strong priority attacks, such as Pawniard and Fletchling. Additionally, Oshawott has to compete with almost every other Water-type attacker, such as the aforementioned Carvanha, many of which are better in every aspect outside of Croagunk luring.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Oshawott could opt to run Hidden Power Fire in order to remove Ferroseed; this would make it the ultimate lure partner for Skrelp, which is only truly walled by Croagunk and Ferroseed. One could also opt for Icy Wind in an attempt to slow Oshawott's faster switch-ins; however, this makes Oshawott even more of a dead weight in the face of Snivy. Oshawott can also run a Swords Dance set made unique by its access to X-Scissor, but it would be difficult to set up and would be largely outclassed by Corphish.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Chinchou and Slowpoke don't take much damage from any of Oshawott's attacks; Chinchou is a particularly notable threat for its ability to OHKO Oshawott with its Electric-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Oshawott does not have the benefits of Eviolite, so it struggles taking even neutral hits from faster attackers such as Mienfoo and Archen. In general, anything moderately powerful with 15 Speed or higher is a threat, provided the foe is not in the KO range of Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers Not Caught on the Switch</strong>: Pokemon such as Munchlax and Spritzee are 2HKOed by Hydro Pump; however, if they come in on one of Oshawott's coverage moves, they can threaten it out with their STAB attacks.</p>",

      "Croagunk Lure": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is a very strong STAB attack with the potential to 2HKO many neutral targets, such as Porygon and Spritzee. Ice Beam provides coverage against the Grass-type Pokemon that resist Hydro Pump and is strong enough to 2HKO Foongus, the most relevant defensive Grass-type. Air Slash also provides coverage against Grass-type Pokemon; however, it is specifically used to guarantee the ability to lure in and remove Croagunk, which is KOed by a combination of Ice Beam and Air Slash. Aqua Jet allows Oshawott to pick off weakened foes; this generally comes into play when Pokemon that take neutral damage from Water-type attacks attempt to switch into Hydro Pump, such as Mienfoo.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Oshawott's Special Attack and Speed in order to maximize its ability to wallbreak; it also Speed creeps the 13 Speed tier, in which only the fastest defensive Pokemon reside. Using a Rash nature boosts Oshawott's Special Attack without negatively affecting its Attack and Speed. Running a Life Orb allows Oshawott to secure a 2HKO against Croagunk with Air Slash and to boost its power in general. Torrent helps boost Oshawott's damage output as it gets worn down.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Oshawott thrives on forced switches, so send it in on free turns against slower Pokemon it forces out such as Hippopotas. Using Oshawott is all about taking out Croagunk, so try to predict the switch and hit it with Air Slash! However, try not to hit the opponent's Croagunk with Hydro Pump, as that will heal its HP and significantly decrease your chance of KOing it. Outside of luring in Croagunk, Oshawott can also break through weakened defensive Pokemon; for example, its Hydro Pump 2HKOes Spritzee even if it still has its Eviolite! Essentially, if your opponent lacks Pokemon immune to Water-type attacks, the general game plan is to repeatedly click Hydro Pump. Lastly, don't go switching Oshawott into things willy-nilly; its bulk is respectable, but it lacks Eviolite.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Oshawott's niche is luring Croagunk, pair Oshawott with Pokemon that want Croagunk gone! These include Corphish, Spritzee, and Scraggy, among other Water-, Fairy-, and Fighting-type Pokemon. Pokemon like Mienfoo and Chinchou bring Croagunk in like a moth to the flame, and they can pivot out into Oshawott for a surprise Air Slash KO. Chinchou itself is a particularly good teammate, as it checks opposing Water-type Pokemon for Oshawott while enjoying Oshawott's ability to break through several of its checks. Also, you'll need to add Pokemon that can switch into the fast Pokemon that threaten Oshawott; you're looking for checks to Pokemon like Snivy and Elekid, such as Foongus.</p>"

  "Lillipup": {
    "overview": "<p>Lillipup is not a great Pokemon in Little Cup, because it lacks the bulk to switch in on attacks, the power to wallbreak well, or the Speed to threaten offensive Pokemon. As a Normal-type, it faces competition both as an offensive Pokemon and as a defensive one. Aipom and Bunnelby are much stronger Normal-types with more power, Speed, and coverage, while Porygon is much bulkier and has access to reliable recovery. However, Lillipup is able to carve out a small niche for itself. Thanks to its ability Vital Spirit, Lillipup can be used to absorb sleep for teams that cannot afford a Pokemon to be put to sleep. Access to Thunder Wave and several coverage options such as Play Rough also lets Lillipup support its teammates and threaten traditional counters to Normal-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pursuit can be used to trap Pokemon such as Gastly and Abra, but it is very weak without STAB and fails to OHKO them if they do not switch out, as well as failing to OHKO Gothita even if it does switch out. Roar can be used for phazing, but few Pokemon will really be setting up on Lillipup due to not wanting to be paralyzed. An EV spread of 196 Atk / 76 Def / 236 Spe with a Jolly nature and Eviolite can be used to outspeed Scraggy and Timid Magnemite, but it loses out on Berry Juice recovery and isn't really needed to beat Scraggy because the opponent will most likely try to set up a Dragon Dance on Lillipup.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types fear being 2HKOed by Play Rough, but they force Lillipup out if they are not already paralyzed in addition to having less than half of their maximum HP. Timburr is a particularly good check because it can set up on Lillipup and takes advantage of Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Pokemon such as Porygon, Hippopotas, and Spritzee take little damage from Lillipup's attacks and can recover off any damage.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: Wallbreakers such as Archen, Life Orb Abra, and Skrelp all make short work of Lillipup. Pokemon that use Substitute, such as Snivy and Gastly, can avoid Lillipup's Thunder Wave and KO it with powerful attacks. Snivy can even proceed to boost its Special Attack.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: If Lillipup lacks Fire Fang, it has no way to hit Ferroseed, which can set up entry hazards, or Magnemite, which is immune to Thunder Wave. Although it fears Thunder Wave, Pawniard takes very little from Lillipup's attacks and forces it to lose its Berry Juice or be KOed after prior damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Thunder Wave Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunder Wave cripples Lillipup switch-ins, allowing its teammates to outspeed the opposing Pokemon. It also ensures Lillipup is not setup bait for dangerous sweepers such as Shell Smash Omanyte. Return is a good STAB move that packs a punch off of Lillipup's decent Attack stat. Play Rough lets Lillipup 2HKO Fighting-types, which otherwise counter it. Fire Fang can be used to 2HKO Ferroseed and Magnemite, and it gives Lillipup some way to hit Pawniard. Crunch hits Ghost-types such as Gastly, which can be extremely threatening thanks to its immunity to Return and ability to use Substitute on a Thunder Wave. Wild Charge can be used to OHKO Berry Juice Archen after it takes Stealth Rock damage and also does considerable damage to Omanyte and Tirtouga.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Vital Spirit makes Lillipup immune to sleep and allows it to switch in on Foongus's Spore and other sleep moves. Berry Juice restores Lillipup's HP and can allow it to come in more often on Foongus and other weaker Pokemon. Maximum Attack investment is needed to 2HKO Fighting-types with Play Rough. 23 HP and 13 Special Defense let Lillipup avoid a 2HKO from any of Foongus's attacks and survive a Sludge Bomb from Life Orb Gastly at full health and Eviolite Bellsprout's Solar Beam after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Thunder Wave often in order to spread status and cripple switch-ins, and then switch Lillipup out to a counter. If the opponent has a Foongus, switch Lillipup in on it so that none of your Pokemon have to be put to sleep. However, be careful of allowing Lillipup to be poisoned by Sludge Bomb, as this will wear it down quickly. If the opponent has a Timburr or Scraggy, it is a good idea to use Play Rough as they switch in order to 2HKO and OHKO them, respectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teams that cannot afford to have a Pokemon crippled by sleep and appreciate paralysis support will appreciate having Lillipup. Swords Dance Pawniard works as a partner because it has an easier time if its checks are paralyzed. Slow wallbreakers like Skrelp and Swords Dance Pancham appreciate being able to outpace faster Pokemon. Fairy-types make for good partners for Lillipup because they counter Fighting-types while Lillipup can switch into Foongus for them. Checks to Flying-types are necessary because Lillipup is OHKOed by Doduo and Taillow and can be setup bait for Fletchling. Pursuit support is appreciated so Lillipup isn't walled by Ghost-types when not running Crunch.</p>"

  "Purrloin": {
    "overview": "<p>Purrloin can find itself a niche on certain teams as a disruptive pivot thanks to its ability Prankster and access to a wide array of status moves. Its movepool includes great supportive moves such as Encore, Taunt, Knock Off, Sunny Day, Rain Dance, and U-turn. Purrloin is also fairly fast, hitting a respectable 17 Speed. However, Purrloin's bulk is mediocre at best, making it hard for it to fully do its job. Purrloin's Attack stat isn't very impressive either, meaning it can't run offensive sets too well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Copycat copies the last used move in the battle and has priority thanks to Prankster. Play Rough allows Purrloin to hit Fighting- and Dark-types that resist its Dark-type STAB moves for super effective damage. Gunk Shot can be used to hit Fairies hard. Sunny Day and Rain Dance together with Heat Rock and Damp Rock, respectively, can make Purrloin a reliable weather setter that almost always gets weather up thanks to Prankster. Sucker Punch can be used to take down faster foes that are at low health and can also be used to surprise attackers that are weak to it, such as Gastly. Pursuit is an option for getting a good chunk of damage on a foe that is switching out to avoid the effects of Encore. Trick can be used with a disruptive item such as Choice Band or Choice Specs.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Timburr, Croagunk, Pancham, and Scraggy can easily threaten Purrloin by doing massive damage with their Fighting-type STAB attacks. They also resist Purrloin's STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull can deal heavy damage to Purrloin with their STAB Fairy-type moves. Spritzee is also immune to Encore and Taunt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Disruptive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Encore disrupts support Pokemon as well as setup sweepers, locking them into an undesirable move. U-turn is great for grabbing momentum. Knock Off has great utility in removing Eviolite from foes and crippling switch-ins to Purrloin after Encore is used while also dealing considerable damage, as it gets STAB. Thunder Wave is a good option for quickly putting setup sweepers out of commission, making it easier for teammates to KO them. Taunt can be used because it allows Purrloin to easily stop hazard leads and opposing status users from fulfilling their respective roles.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite is the best option when it comes to Purrloin's item, but Berry Juice is also fairly viable. The given EV spread and a Careful nature greatly improve Purrloin's bulk, giving it 23 / 12 / 12 defenses. The remaining EVs are put into Speed to allow Purrloin to outspeed standard Fletchling and into Attack to raise it by one point. A spread of 188 HP / 60 Def / 228 Spe and a Bold nature can be used to outspeed fast Fletchling.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Encore is great for locking the foe into a setup or status move. U-turn is nice to use after Encoring the foe into something undesirable, as well as for gaining momentum overall. Purrloin can also use Thunder Wave quite well thanks to Prankster. Due to Purrloin's mediocre bulk, it should be very wary of Fighting-, Fairy-, and Bug-type moves, which it is weak to.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow VoltTurn users, such as Mienfoo, Pancham, Vullaby, Magnemite, and Larvesta, are greatly appreciated, as they can help get Purrloin safely in. Poison-types such as Croagunk, Foongus, and Trubbish can easily take on Fighting-, Bug-, and Fairy-types, which Purrloin has problems with. Spritzee is another great teammate, taking on Fighting-types while also providing Wish support for Purrloin. Setup sweepers really enjoy having Purrloin on their team, since Purrloin can make it easier for them to set up by using Encore.</p>"

  "Pansage": {
    "overview": "<p>Pansage is extremely frail, has poor offensive stats, and lacks powerful coverage options; however, the damage mechanics at level 5 make Pansage's Bullet Seed one of the strongest attacks in the metagame. Bullet Seed can 2HKO even the bulkiest walls, and Pansage's decent movepool allows it to heavily damage almost everything that resists Bullet Seed. Lastly, Pansage has a decent Speed tier and can outspeed many threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pansage learns Nasty Plot, but Snivy typically outclasses any set using it. A set utilizing Acrobatics and Berry Juice allows Pansage to hit Foongus, but Pansage is much weaker without its Life Orb. Hone Claws and Substitute are good options for setting up and easing prediction, but Pansage typically needs all of its coverage options and can't afford to use either of these moves. A set with Gluttony and a Salac or Petaya Berry could be used to try to sweep; however, again, Pansage is very weak without a Life Orb. Lastly, Taunt helps to break down walls and prevent entry hazards from being set up, but Pansage's poor bulk makes it difficult to utilize.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Foongus</strong>: Foongus takes very little from any of Pansage's attacks and forces it out with Sludge Bomb. However, Pansage can 2HKO a Foongus that has lost its Eviolite with Gunk Shot after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Croagunk</strong>: Croagunk resists all of Pansage's common coverage and can OHKO it with Sludge Bomb. However, it is prone to being worn down and takes a lot from Bullet Seed if its Eviolite has been Knocked Off.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Fletchling can outspeed and OHKO Pansage with its super effective STAB Acrobatics, while Vullaby can take any hit and KO in return. They both must watch out for Rock Tomb, though.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta can cripple Pansage with a burn or KO it with Flare Blitz. However, both are hit hard by Rock Tomb.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Moves</strong>: Pansage is very frail, so fast attackers such as Abra and priority attackers such as Pawniard can easily KO it or force it out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bullet Seed is Pansage's strongest attack and the only reason to include Pansage on a team; it's capable of 2HKOing every Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Knock Off weakens many switch-ins to Pansage such as Pumpkaboo-XL and Foongus, and Low Sweep hits Steel-types such as Pawniard and Magnemite. Rock Tomb can 2HKO bulky Fire-types and Vullaby after Stealth Rock and allows Pansage to outspeed faster threats. Alternatively, Gunk Shot lets Pansage heavily damage Grass- and Fairy-types and is its best way of dealing any sort of meaningful damage to Foongus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread increases Pansage's Attack as much as possible while allowing it to reach 17 Speed. Life Orb significantly increases the power of Pansage's attacks. Overgrow is Pansage's most useful ability, as it makes Bullet Seed even stronger when Pansage is at low health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Pansage to break down walls with its powerful Bullet Seed. Pansage's coverage options should be used to heavily damage or KO incoming checks and counters. Pansage as a whole isn't a very good Pokemon and will lose many matchups, making it important to only use it against walls and Pokemon it can threaten to KO. Take advantage of weak attacks, Life Orb recoil, and damage from entry hazards to activate Overgrow and empower Bullet Seed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pansage appreciates Stealth Rock support to weaken its Flying-, Fire-, and Ice-type checks and ensure extra KOs such as the 2HKO on Ponyta. Slow pivots can compensate for Pansage's poor bulk and allow it to come into play and begin firing off powerful attacks. Pansage struggles to damage Foongus in any meaningful way, making Vullaby and Sleep Talk + Rest Skrelp great teammates. Gothita can also deal with Foongus along with trapping other Poison-types and fast threats to Pansage. Skrelp and other Water-types are also good for dealing with Fire-types that threaten Pansage. Chinchou is a particularly good Water-type teammate because it can check Flying-types on top of its ability to pivot Pansage in with a slow Volt Switch. Finally, Snivy and Fletchling appreciate Pansage's abilities to break down walls for them and they can return the favor.</p>"

  "Pansear": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Pansear has above average stats and gets a powerful Special Attack boost from its ability when taken down to 1/3 HP, it is significantly held back by its poor movepool and below average attacking stats. It's also largely outclassed by other Fire-types, mainly Houndour. However, its bulk and ability to take on Fighting-types, as well as its ability to use a unique Berry Juice + Recycle set, gives it a small niche in competitive play.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower is a decent choice for its better accuracy, but it isn't recommended, as Pansear's low Special Attack makes Fire Blast almost always better. Taunt can be fairly decent for keeping Pansear from being setup fodder, but Pansear generally doesn't have room for it. Pansear also has a good physical movepool, but it isn't very threatening and is generally outclassed by Ponyta in that niche. Torment can also be used as a secondary option on a stall set because many Pokemon don't have two good moves to hit Pansear with, letting Pansear set up behind a Substitute. Toxic can also be used over Will-O-Wisp to deal with Pokemon that can counterstall Pansear with recovery, but Will-O-Wisp is usually more useful to help Pansear more effectively wall physical Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Other Fire-types</strong>: Since Pansear can't burn opposing Fire-types or really damage them at all, they can completely stop it. Houndour stands out in this regard because it can utilize Flash Fire to take a Fire-type move and answer back with a very powerful STAB Dark-type move, but all Fire-types should be dealt with before setting up. The only real exceptions to this are Larvesta and Ponyta, which Berry Juice Pansear almost completely walls.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Reliable Recovery</strong>: Any Pokemon that can survive a hit from Pansear and reliably reclaim their lost HP makes for a large threat to Pansear; the most prominent of these are Porygon, Spritzee, and Roost users like Vullaby and Archen.</p> <p><strong>Specially Attacking Water-types</strong>: Any Pokemon that can bring stall Pansear to just above the threshold for Berry Juice's activation and then finish it off with a powerful Water-type attack, such as Chinchou, or any Pokemon that can just OHKO Pansear such as Shell Smash Omanyte, will defeat it easily.</p> <p><strong>Water-types with Priority</strong>: Corphish's Aqua Jet and Carvanha's ability to easily revenge kill Pansear with a very powerful Waterfall make them both notable counters to Pansear. The latter is particularly threatening, as it can also use Pansear as fodder to accrue multiple Speed boosts for a sweep.</p> <p><strong>Special Setup Sweepers</strong>: Special setup sweepers can use Pansear as setup fodder and OHKO it without caring about being burned by Will-O-Wisp. The most prominent of these include Omanyte and Nasty Plot users such as Houndour, Vullaby, and Croagunk.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Berry Juice Stall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Recycle replenishes Pansear's Berry Juice, keeping it alive until it runs out of PP given that Pansear isn't OHKOed or your move isn't predicted. Will-O-Wisp whittles down the foe while Pansear stalls and makes Pansear a somewhat decent physical wall by halving the foe's Attack. Substitute cuts Pansear's own HP to activate Berry Juice, as well as letting it avoid status and wear down burned Pokemon. Flame Charge gives Pansear +1 Speed, letting it outspeed Diglett and common Choice Scarf users as well as giving it a good STAB move. Knock Off could work over Substitute or Will-O-Wisp to cripple bulkier foes, but it struggles for a moveslot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This EV spread gives Pansear 15 Speed so it can outspeed common Choice Scarf threats as well as the entire unboosted metagame after a Flame Charge. Its Defense and Special Defense stats also have enough investment to let it survive Fletchling's Acrobatics, Abra's Psychic, and Mienfoo's Drain Punch, and it specifically survives Chinchou's Scald and a burned Diglett's Earthquake; both of these Pokemon are big threats to Pansear. Its ability, Blaze, gives it a very good power boost at under 1/3 HP but should not be taken advantage of much, as the whole point of the set is to keep Pansear at a high HP. Berry Juice and Recycle are used in conjunction to stall the opponent out by continually restoring Pansear to full health until the foe faints or runs out of options. 132 Def / 132 SpD / 244 Spe with a Jolly nature is also a good alternate spread to run to outspeed Jolly Pawniard, but it isn't recommended.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Never switch in Pansear to a Knock Off user due to it negating Recycle and therefore the entire set. However, if Pansear has consumed its Berry Juice and is faster than the opponent's Pokemon, then it can easily use Recycle, allowing it to take a Knock Off and not worry about losing its important item. It is also recommended to use Pansear late-game when the enemy team has taken a bit of chip damage. Furthermore, Pansear completely walls Ponyta, though it is also walled by it if neither has Toxic. Getting up a Flame Charge is always a very good idea if the opponent has Diglett. Using Substitute to activate Berry Juice and get back to full HP so Pansear can survive certain attacks such as a burned Life Orb Diglett's Earthquake is usually beneficial. Finally, Pansear can sometimes use Will-O-Wisp on the switch of a Pokemon that can OHKO it so it can stall out said Pokemon later in the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Grass-types like Ferroseed and Foongus beat Ground- and Water- types that threaten Pansear, as do fast Water-types like Choice Scarf Chinchou. Slow U-turn or Volt Switch users also help Pansear get in the field. Furthermore, Cottonee checks are very useful, as Pansear hates being Taunted; Fletchling fills both of these roles quite well. Entry hazard removers such as Vullaby and Drilbur stop Pansear from being whittled down every time it switches in while hazards are up. Toxic Spikes users can help Pansear stall by making sure it doesn't have to waste a turn using Will-O-Wisp, although they decrease the effectiveness of Pansear as a physical tank. Pokemon that can punish big threats like Porygon, such as Pawniard and Scraggy, generally make good teammates for Pansear. Finally, Pokemon that appreciate the burning of common threats like Omanyte and other setup sweepers like the support from Pansear.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot doubles Pansear's Special Attack and sets it up for a sweep. Fire Blast is a very powerful STAB option for Pansear and is almost essential on this set. Hidden Power Grass OHKOes a lot of common Pokemon like Omanyte and Onix, as well as 2HKOing other threats like Chinchou. Flame Charge helps Pansear set up even more and outspeed many foes, such as Diglett and common Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Chinchou and Magnemite. Substitute helps Pansear hide from status, avoid damage, and get down to Blaze's activation range.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Pansear's Defense investment lets it take less than 1/2 from Mienfoo's Drain Punch and survive a lot of other physical moves easily. Pansear is given maximum Speed investment to reach a comfortable 17 Speed, which lets it outspeed much of the current metagame and Speed tie with common threats like Onix and Mienfoo. The rest goes into Special Attack along with 30 IVs to maintain Hidden Power Grass. As for items, Eviolite lets Pansear survive many more attacks, but it gives up some power, while Life Orb is used for more power at the cost of the extra bulk. Finally, Blaze is a great ability when used with Life Orb and/or Substitute because when Pansear has less than 1/3 HP, it gains an incredible Special Attack boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pansear should be used as a setup sweeper, meaning it should never be sacrificed early-game and shouldn't try to set up on big threats such as Diglett and Carvanha. On the same note, all threats should be defeated before setting up with Pansear. Setting up on weak Pokemon such as Spritzee is beneficial so Pansear doesn't get KOed before a sweep. All in all, giving up Pansear isn't a good idea unless the opponent has many counters to it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Grass-types like Ferroseed and Foongus are good against Water-types that threaten Pansear, and Porygon takes care of Carvanha and some other common threats to Pansear. Entry hazard removers and hazard setters are important for keeping Pansear from being whittled down and simultaneously whittling down foes; Drilbur is great for this role. Fast Water-types check Rock-, Ground-, and sometimes even other Water-types. Gothita traps and removes common threats like Fletchling and Timburr, preventing them from being a threat to Pansear. As Pansear can break through a lot of walls, Pokemon such as Download Porygon and Corphish appreciate its help.</p>"

  "Panpour": {
    "overview": "<p>Panpour is unique in Little Cup in that it is the only Water-type Pokemon in the tier with access to Nasty Plot. This niche is backed up by a good base Speed and decent coverage options. Unfortunately for Panpour, however, it struggles to set up due to its incredibly poor bulk. Panpour also has to compete for a teamslot with other Water-type sweepers such as Omanyte, which is both more powerful and faster due to Shell Smash.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Panpour can viably run Hidden Power Fire over Hidden Power Grass in order to get the jump on Ferroseed. This option can work especially well when Panpour is used in tandem with another Water-type wallbreaker such as Corphish, as it is also walled by Ferroseed. However, this in turn leaves Panpour totally walled by opposing Water-types. Giving Panpour a Life Orb or Splash Plate instead of Berry Juice or Eviolite will drastically increase its damage output; however, Panpour will then face a longevity issue, as it will have to take a hit while using Nasty Plot and will take large amounts of recoil damage from Life Orb. Surf can be used over Hydro Pump if accuracy is an issue, but it is significantly weaker. Taunt can be substituted for Knock Off to help break through bulky Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Frillish.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ferroseed</strong>: Unless you choose to run Hidden Power Fire, Ferroseed annihilates Panpour, as it can survive any hit and then proceed to cripple Panpour with Thunder Wave and KO it with Bullet Seed.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Pokemon, specifically bulky Water- and Normal-types such as Porygon and Slowpoke, give Panpour loads of trouble, as they can take even boosted hits and either cripple Panpour with Thunder Wave or retaliate with their own strong attacks. However, running Knock Off helps mitigate this. Croagunk is particularly troubling, as it is immune to Panpour's Water-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users</strong>: Panpour is slightly slower than it needs to be to be truly effective, as it must take hits from faster Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf Chinchou and Snivy, or priority users, such as Fletchling and Pawniard, before it has the chance to attack. Therefore, removing them will allow Panpour to have a much easier time doing its job.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot is Panpour's niche, doubling its Special Attack and turning it into a decently powerful attacker. Hydro Pump is Panpour's strongest STAB option; it hits quite hard after a Nasty Plot. Ice Beam provides super effective coverage on Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon and good neutral coverage as well. Hidden Power Grass gives Panpour a chance to take on bulky Water-types such as Chinchou. If you don't mind dropping a coverage move, Panpour can make good use of Knock Off, as the move allows Panpour to weaken its checks on the switch, as well as pressure bulky Pokemon such as Porygon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs maximize Panpour's Special Attack and Speed, letting it hit as hard and fast as possible. The leftover EVs boost HP and Defense to help Panpour set up a Nasty Plot. Berry Juice restores Panpour's HP, allowing it to set up on weak or neutral hits and take priority attacks better after its Berry Juice has been used. On the other hand, Eviolite helps Panpour set up but leaves it more vulnerable to priority attacks at low health. Torrent is Panpour's only useful ability, boosting its power to fantastic levels when it is at low health. A Modest nature is slightly preferred over Timid, as it secures notably better damage rolls at +2 against significant targets such as Eviolite Mienfoo. If Panpour is running Knock Off instead of Hidden Power Grass, it can maximize its Special Attack with a spread of 12 Atk / 252 SpA / 244 Spe. The 12 remaining EVs go into Attack to make Panpour's Knock Off marginally stronger.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to set up against passive foes such as Spritzee or against Pokemon that are at a type disadvantage such as Onix and Ponyta. This will help limit the damage Panpour takes while setting up, increasing its effectiveness substantially. It is also a good idea to remove opposing Choice Scarf and priority attack users before setting up, specifically Choice Scarf Chinchou and Fletchling, as they will decimate Panpour. Try not to overestimate Panpour's power, as even at +2 it cannot secure important OHKOs on neutral targets such as Porygon and Pawniard. Panpour hits the important 17 Speed tier if you choose to run Timid, so it can have a good chance of taking on threats such as Archen and Drilbur. Panpour is fairly frail, so only use it as either a wallbreaker early-game or a cleaner late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Panpour's damage output is generally underwhelming, entry hazard support is almost essential to its success. Pokemon such as Dwebble and Archen can provide said entry hazard support; coincidentally, both of them also do well against opposing Grass-types, which are threats to Panpour. Ferroseed is a full stop to Panpour, and most other bulky Pokemon, such as Porygon, don't mind Panpour's attacks too much. Gothita is an excellent partner for Panpour, as it can trap and remove Ferroseed via Hidden Power Fire and can also utilize Trick to cripple bulky Pokemon by removing their Eviolite. A slow pivot, such as Mienfoo or Magnemite, can help bring Panpour in with its Berry Juice intact, greatly aiding its setup. Panpour partners well with other Water-type wallbreakers such as Corphish, as the duo can wear down each other's checks through consistent offensive pressure. Fighting-type teammates can break through Pokemon that wall Panpour such as Ferroseed and Porygon and can provide helpful Knock Off support. Grass-types are useful to check opposing Water-types, especially if Panpour isn't running Hidden Power Grass. For example, Pokemon like Ferroseed and Lileep can set up entry hazards and remove threats such as Chinchou.</p>"

  "Munna": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Munna appears to offer very little compared to other Psychic-types. Although it has decent 76 / 45 / 55 bulk, its weakness to Knock Off generally negates this. Munna's Speed and offenses are not high enough for it to fill an offensive role either, certainly not to the point where it could be considered over Abra or Gothita. Munna is able to utilize its bulk and low Speed stat to support itself and its teammates through Trick Room. Although it might seem outclassed at this role due to Solosis's superior Special Attack stat and excellent abilities, Munna is the slowest Pokemon in Little Cup with access to both Trick Room and Healing Wish, which can create an opportunity for one of Munna's crippled teammates to sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fighting allows Munna to take on Pawniard, OHKOing it after a Calm Mind boost, while Shadow Ball hits foes such as Pumpkaboo and Gothita super effectively. Energy Ball gives Munna super effective coverage over Drilbur, Chinchou, and Tirtouga. Munna can utilize Trick with Choice Specs to either fire off powerful attacks or offload its item on a foe.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Common Taunt users such as Mienfoo and Onix can shut down both of Munna's sets by preventing it from passing its boosts or setting up Trick Room. However, Munna can hit both of these foes hard with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Munna is susceptible to being worn down by Toxic and Leech Seed damage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Most Steel-types, particularly Ferroseed, Pawniard, and Magnemite, have an easy time switching into Munna, as Munna's coverage is unable to dent them.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Any Munna set not carrying Dazzling Gleam is hard-walled by Pokemon such as Pawniard, Stunky, and Houndour, which are able to hit Munna super effectively with their STAB moves.</p>",

      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Munna is able to use its bulk to set up Trick Room to take advantage of its low Speed stat and support its teammates. Psychic is Munna's most powerful STAB move, doing super effective damage to foes such as Croagunk, Foongus, and Mienfoo. Dazzling Gleam hits Dark-types that are immune to Psychic. Healing Wish is Munna's niche over other Trick Room setters because it allows for Munna's stronger teammates to be used much more liberally, as Munna will almost always be able to use Healing Wish thanks to its Speed in Trick Room to safely bring them in with full health.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The defensive EVs and Eviolite give Munna impressive 25 / 21 / 21 bulk, enabling it to take a Knock Off from Pawniard and almost always set up Trick Room. The remaining EVs are invested in Special Attack, allowing Munna's attacks to hit harder. Synchronize is a situational ability, but it can allow Munna to punish foes that attempt to cripple Munna's teammates.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Munna can set up Trick Room safely on nearly any Pokemon that does not have Taunt or a super effective move. The optimal time to set up Trick Room is late-game, after Munna's teammates have been weakened. Munna can use Healing Wish in order to heal a teammate fully and create an opportunity for them to punch holes or clean up the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Munna benefits from being used on Trick Room teams. Slow Fighting-types such as Croagunk and Pancham can be used in order to take on Dark-types, particularly Pawniard. Slow Pokemon with huge offensive stats are the best teammates for Munna, as Healing Wish means they can be used aggressively early-game and healed up fully late-game, allowing them to finish off the opposing team that they already punched holes in. Pokemon such as Cubone, Clamperl, Cranidos, Azurill, and Pawniard are a few viable examples.</p>"

  "Blitzle": {
    "overview": "<p>Blitzle is a fast Pokemon in LC, reaching 18 Speed when fully invested. Blitzle's ability Sap Sipper lets it act as an effective offensive check to Snivy, giving it a niche on webs teams. Blitzle also boasts nice Attack and Special Attack stats alongside a diverse movepool, allowing it to have an offensive presence, albeit an only adequate one. However, Blitzle's frailty and only slightly above-average damage output leave it outclassed by most other Electric-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Blitzle suffers from a diverse movepool that lacks strong attacks, though it can play around by paralyzing foes via Thunder Wave, Pursuit trapping unsuspecting Psychic-types like Abra, and using Bounce to its advantage to make it a counter to Grass-types. However, Flame Charge outclasses Bounce, as Bounce is easily played around, whereas Flame Charge is able to hit immediately and raise Blitzle's Speed. A special set using Thunderbolt, Hidden Power, and Charge Beam can be used but is outclassed by Elekid even more so than a physical variant, as Blitzle lacks a wide enough movepool to harm most of the tier. It is also limited severely by the fact that it requires a Lightning Rod boost to put dents in most walls. An Agility set could skyrocket Blitzle's Speed, though it would lack the power that Blitzle loves having at its disposal; the Flame Charge boost is typically enough for Blitzle, rendering such a set nearly obsolete. Motor Drive and Lightning Rod are both useful abilities if a Snivy check is not needed, although there is little reason to use Blitzle over more common Electric-types in this case.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chinchou</strong>: Chinchou resists most of the moves in Blitzle's repertoire and can dispose of the frail Blitzle relatively easily. Chinchou's access to Volt Absorb makes it even more pesky for Blitzle, which cannot touch it with STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Blitzle is essentially rendered useless once it loses its Life Orb, as it is no longer able to hit hard enough to leave dents in the opposing team. Choice Scarf Pawniard can remove Blitzle's Life Orb, survive a Flame Charge due to the weakened damage output, and proceed to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Blitzle has basically no method of badly harming Ground-types, as they are immune to Electric and it cannot deal much damage to them with its other attacking moves. While Blitzle cannot harm Ground-types, they can easily retaliate with their STAB moves, heavily damaging Blitzle if not OHKOing it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Any Pokemon that can eat up one of Blitzle's attacks is, more often than not, able to retaliate hard, hitting Blitzle for massive amounts of damage. Drilbur is an example of this, as it is immune to Blitzle's STAB moves and not hit hard by the rest of its movepool; thus, Drilbur can easily eat up a hit and proceed to OHKO Blitzle with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Pokemon such as Focus Sash Abra and Choice Scarf Pawniard can easily come in after Blitzle has taken a hit or two and proceed to finish it off with great ease; Abra can survive any hit from Blitzle and finish it off with its powerful moves, while Pawniard utilizes its tremendous Attack and Choice Scarf to obliterate unboosted Blitzle. The same applies to any Choice Scarf user capable of dealing good damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wild Charge is Blitzle's best STAB move and has nice Base Power; its only downside is that it whittles Blitzle down very quickly due to both its recoil and Life Orb's. Volt Switch is a STAB move that helps keep up offensive momentum. Flame Charge is a coverage move, albeit a weak one, that boosts Blitzle's Speed by one stage. However, Flame Charge typically does abysmal damage to Eviolite-holders, so its primary purpose is to weaken or finish off Pokemon that are not holding an Eviolite. The final moveslot is dedicated to a Normal-type move, with each serving a very different purpose from the other. Double-Edge is a hard-hitting move that can be very taxing on Blitzle due to its recoil, whereas Quick Attack is a moderately weak priority attack that is used primarily to finish off weakened foes. Both of these moves are situational and easily interchangeable, as they will typically not be favored over another move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 EVs maximize Blitzle's Attack, increasing its potency as a physical attacker. 228 Speed EVs and a Naive nature put Blitzle at 18 Speed, the maximum it can reach, without hindering either offensive stat. The remaining EVs are split between Blitzle's defenses and Special Attack, increasing each by one point. 0 HP IVs minimize the recoil Blitzle takes from Life Orb, increasing Blitzle's longevity. Life Orb boosts the power of all of Blitzle's attacks without locking it into a move. Sap Sipper is the ability of choice, as it makes Blitzle immune to Grass, an otherwise neutral type, while boosting Blitzle's Attack if it is hit by a Grass-type move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be certain to use Blitzle conservatively, as it is easily whittled down. It should not be sent in against any strong Pokemon as it will be hit hard due to its subpar defenses. The best times to directly switch Blitzle in are when Blitzle has a safe switch from a teammate's pivoting move such as U-turn or Volt Switch, or when the opposing Pokemon is guaranteed to use a Grass-type move so that Blitzle can gain the boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Blitzle's main niche is as a Sticky Webs abuser that checks Snivy, an otherwise enormous threat to Sticky Webs teams; unlike most Snivy checks, Blitzle is unlikely to detract from the team's momentum due to its offensive nature. For this reason, Spinarak and Surskit are excellent teammates. As Blitzle has no method of increasing its damage output outside of Life Orb, it is best to have an entry hazards user. Dwebble and Ferroseed both work for this role, as they are competent Pokemon capable of laying down Spikes or Stealth Rock. Flying-types are great partners for Blitzle, as they can avoid Ground-type attacks that could devastate Blitzle, as well as deal with bulky Grass-types that do not take much from Flame Charge, such as Foongus and Pumpkaboo. In return, Blitzle can easily eat up or avoid any form of Electric-type attack directed at Flying-types. Fletchling is a powerful Flying-type physical attacker that greatly appreciates having Blitzle to eat up Electric-type attacks. As Blitzle is walled by most Ground-type Pokemon and Chinchou, having a Grass-type that can dispose of them, such as Pumpkaboo or Foongus, is much appreciated by Blitzle. Finally, having a potent Knock Off user that can aid in wearing down opposing walls is greatly beneficial to Blitzle, which often cannot heavily damage Eviolite users. Corphish both appreciates and assists Blitzle, taking advantage of Blitzle's immunity while still fulfilling the role of Knocking Off foes' items.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Scald has better accuracy than Hydro Pump and a chance to burn on the switch, but Tympole misses out on many important KOs. Substitute and 3 attacks can be used to get around Sucker Punch, but Tympole needs the coverage and ability to set up rain by itself, which acts as a safety net in order for Tympole to maintain a sweep, should it need to. Sludge Wave can be used over Sludge Bomb for more power and the ability to hit Chespin, which would otherwise wall Tympole, but the extra power is negligible, making Sludge Bomb the better option. Hidden Power Grass and Hidden Power Electric both hit other Water-types, with Hidden Power Electric providing better coverage, but these options are generally too weak to KO important targets such as Staryu and Slowpoke. Berry Juice and Eviolite increase Tympole's longevity and bulk, respectively, while Damp Rock extends the number of rain turns; however, the power drop from not having Life Orb is very noticeable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Lileep, Chespin, and Foongus are all good answers to Tympole as they resist its STAB moves and don't take much damage from Sludge Bomb. Chespin has the bonus of even being immune to Sludge Bomb. Snover changes the weather from rain to hail, which halts Tympole's sweep. Snover can't safely switch into Tympole, however, as it is weak to Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Normal-types</strong>: Bulky Normal-types such as Porygon, Munchlax, and Lickitung are all good answers to Tympole due to their sheer bulk, which allows them to survive Tympole's Hydro Pump even while under rain.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis stops Tympole's sweep by quartering Tympole's Speed.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Pawniard, Croagunk, and Fletchling can easily revenge kill Tympole because they bypass Swift Swim and hit Tympole before it can strike them.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Staryu, Slowpoke, Chinchou, and Skrelp all resist Tympole's STAB moves, but Chinchou and Skrelp fear Earth Power.

Sludge Bomb hits Grass- and Fairy-types that Hydro Pump misses, such as Snover, Cottonee, and Spritzee, harder than Hydro Pump and has a 30% chance to poison the target. Earth Power allows Tympole to get around Pokemon that rain teams generally struggle with, such as Chinchou, Croagunk, and Pawniard; however, only Berry Juice Chinchou is OHKOed. Rain Dance can be used to support the team or let Tympole sweep on its own.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature maximizes Tympole's Special Attack while hitting 28 Speed in rain and 14 Speed outside of rain. EV The remaining EVs are put into bulk to help against priority attacks. Life Orb maximizes power and Swift Swim gives Tympole great Speed in the rain.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Tympole in early-game to set up rain and weaken the threats to your other rain sweepers.

Fighting-types, such as Pancham, Mienfoo, Timburr, and Croagunk, can pick off Munchlax, Ferroseed, and Lileep and cripple walls such as Slowpoke via Knock Off. Pancham also supports Tympole through the use of Parting Shot. Riolu and Purrloin have access priority Rain Dance, which can be useful in a pinch. Other Swift Swim sweepers such as Omanyte, Mantyke, and Horsea can form an offensive core with Tympole; Omanyte specifically can lure in Lileep and hit it with an Ice Beam. Tympole can lure in Chinchou and hit it with Earth Power in order to clear up a sweep for Mantyke and other Swift Swim sweepers. Grass-types such as Cottonee, Pumpkaboo, Foongus, Chespin, and Ferroseed cover Tympole's weaknesses. Ferroseed and Chespin provide great typing synergy with Tympole and can set up Spikes to weaken targets, such as Berry Juice Chinchou, so Tympole can KO them more easily. Foongus has access to Rain Dance and Regenerator, allowing it to consistently set up rain throughout the match while still acting as a decent pivot with Damp Rock.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Life Orb Chlorophyll set consisting of Solar Beam / Hidden Power Fire / Bug Buzz / Air Slash is a possibility, but is gimmicky. Calm Mind is an option for boosting power and special bulk. Sewaddle can use Sunny Day to trigger Chlorophyll without Vulpix support. It's notable that Sewaddle has access to Agility, Iron Defense, Calm Mind, and Baton Pass as well as it can use these moves to pass boosts to a teammate. Bug Buzz is a secondary STAB option, but it doesn't hit very many Pokemon for super effective damage, apart from Purrloin and Psychic-types. Lastly, Sewaddle gets Magic Coat to deflect status moves, but its incompatibility with Sticky Web makes it a poor option in most scenarios.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pokemon with Super Effective Moves</strong>: Sewaddle has six weaknesses, all of which are relatively common attacking types. Even with Sewaddle's decent defenses, it cannot withstand even the weakest of Fire- and Flying-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock and Status</strong>: Sewaddle dislikes Stealth Rock, as it strips a quarter of its health away each time it enters battle.

      "Sticky Web Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sticky Web gives your team the advantage by lowering the Speed of the opponent's grounded Pokemon by one stage. This makes it easier for slower, powerful Pokemon to sweep. Energy Ball is Sewaddle's obligatory STAB attack. Hidden Power Fire is used to hit enemy Steel-types such as Ferroseed and it is further powered up if the sun is present. Hidden Power Rock is an alternative to hit Flying- and Fire-types on the switch-in, nailing Larvesta especially hard. Air Slash is to hit opposing Fighting-type Pokemon, and it also hits opposing Grass-types for decent damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given combination of EVs allows Sewaddle to switch into Stealth Rock multiple times while maintaining its bulk, and a Bold nature is used to take physical hits better. If you are using Hidden Power Rock, Sewaddle needs to have 200 Defense and 120 Special Defense EVs to make up for the IV drops. This means there are not enough EVs available to invest in Special Attack. Chlorophyll is the primary ability, as Overcoat is quite redundant with Sewaddle's new immunity to powder moves and lack of synergy on sand teams. Swarm is also a mediocre ability, as Sewaddle prefers to stay at high healh, and this set doesn't have a Bug-type attack for Swarm to boost anyways.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Set up Sticky Web when you can; Sewaddle has completed its primary job if this is done. To accomplish this, it is usually best to lead with Sewaddle or switch into a  Water-, Fighting-, Ground-, or Electric-type move. Sewaddle is also the only Sticky Web user that doesn't have to rely on Focus Sash since it has the defenses to take a few non-super effective hits, and Eviolite helps it considerably in that regard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vulpix is Sewaddle's best partner. Despite sun aggravating Sewaddle's Fire weakness, it doubles its Speed. Pokemon resistant to Fire- and Flying-type moves are also great partners. Steel-types such as Pawniard and Magnemite and Water-types including Slowpoke and Mantyke can switch into these moves, while Sewaddle can take Electric- and Ground-type attacks aimed at them. Rock-types such as Archen and Tyrunt also resist Fire- and Flying-type moves, so they make excellent defensive partners, too. Also, bear in mind that slower Pokemon can utilize Sticky Web to sweep. Pokemon like Pawniard, Mienfoo, and Timburr make good offensive teammates that appreciate the Speed advantage. Charmander and Helioptile are offensive sun partners that also benefit from Sticky Web support.</p>"

Toxic Spikes's presence also helps boost the effectiveness of other Pokemon using Venoshock or Hex, and chip damage helps sweeping teammates. Protect confers free Speed boosts and protection against Fake Out. Endeavor can be used toward the end of Venipede's life, such as when Focus Sash activates, to weaken the foe so that it can be KOed easily, especially with Pin Missile. STAB Pin Missile does a fair amount of damage, breaking possible Focus Sashes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature and max Speed EVs allow Venipede to outspeed most Pokemon without needing to Protect, and max Attack EVs maximize the effectiveness of Pin Missile. The remaining EVs go into Defense for extra bulk, though they could be left out to get Venipede's HP down to 1 quicker for maximum power Endeavor; if you do this, you might as well lower the IVs to 0 as well.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Venipede is only really good for setting up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and although it's tempting to lead with it, most leads can stop Venipede, so if the foe has a counter such as Dwebble, save Venipede for mid- or late-game. Protect should be used to stop Fake Out and to gain enough Speed to outspeed the foe. Venipede can stack entry hazards effectively against walls that often fail to deal enough damage to 3HKO it. Pokemon such as Spritzee, Snubbull, Foongus, and non-Bulk Up Timburr are examples of Pokemon Venipede can switch into. It's ideal to save Venipede until all Defoggers and Spinners are gone before entry hazard stacking.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate general chip damage, such as Zigzagoon, or any other setup sweeper, such as Fletchling or Timburr, make good teammates. Venipede's primary role is neutered by Rapid Spinners and Defoggers such as Staryu and Drilbur, so spinblockers and Defiant users such as Pumpkaboo and Pawniard, respectively, make great teammates. Gastly is a more offensive option instead of Pumpkaboo for a spinblocker. Although it is frail, Gastly benefits greatly from the presence of entry hazards, as it can fire off a 130 Base Power STAB Venoshock if the target is poisoned, which Venipede can ensure by setting up Toxic Spikes. More stall-oriented Pokemon such as Spritzee, Lickitung, and Hippopotas make good teammates because of the switches they force, so the entry hazard damage will add up while they can recover off stray damage.</p>"

Fletchling tops the list of checks, as its Acrobatics threatens Petilil with a priority OHKO after entry hazard damage.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Most Fire-types such as Ponyta, Larvesta, Magby, Houndour, Vulpix, and Torchic threaten to OHKO Petilil after Stealth Rock damage, especially with Sun support.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Hard-hitting Poison-types such as Gastly, Croagunk, and Skrelp can almost certainly OHKO Petilil.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Snover and Amaura are immense threats to Petilil, as they can get rid of the sun and make Petilil much easier to revenge kill with their STAB Ice moves. Pokemon that carry Ice-type moves as coverage, such as Omanyte, Shellder, and Chinchou, can also pose a threat.</p> <p><strong>U-turn</strong>: One of the major downfalls of using Petilil is that it needs to be very wary of U-turn, a move that a lot of the Pokemon in the metagame run as filler, mainly Larvesta whose STAB U-turn can severely damage Petilil. Others such as Mienfoo, Bunnelby, Vullaby, and any other Pokemon that gets access to U-turn should be treated with much caution.</p>",

      "Sun Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain allows Petilil to recover half of the damage dealt as health and is Petilil's preferred STAB move. However, Solar Beam is a far more offensive choice as it OHKOes almost all Pokemon weak to Grass and deals significant damage to neutral foes. Despite not having the accuracy of Foongus's Spore, Sleep Powder still hits most of the time and allows Petilil to put a foe to sleep for a few turns. Healing Wish lets Petilil sacrifice itself to cure a team member of status and restore them back to full health. Hidden Power Fire gets a boost in damage under sun and allows Petilil to 2HKO a large portion of its checks, such as Snover, Ferroseed, and Foongus after Stealth Rock damage. On the other hand, Hidden Power Ice is Petilil's only coverage for Vullaby, which is immune to powder moves, and 2HKOes after its Eviolite has been knocked off and after Stealth Rock damage. Hidden Power Ice can also potentially 2HKO the rest of Petilil's Grass-type checks apart from Snover and Ferroseed. Stun Spore is a good choice for a secondary status move once Sleep Cause is in effect to paralyze fast Pokemon or ones with Vital Spirit or Insomnia.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and nature along with Eviolite allow Petilil at full health to survive an Acrobatics from Fletchling, Sludge Bomb or Sludge Wave from Croagunk, Brave Bird from defensive Vullaby, or Sludge Bomb from Foongus to KO the enemy in return or ensure the use of Healing Wish. The bulk also lets Petilil check Water-, Electric- and Ground-types more efficiently. Petilil's maximum unboosted Speed of 13 is doubled to 26 under the sun courtesy of its ability Chlorophyll, which allows Petilil to outspeed Choice Scarf Pokemon with 17 Speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sun is mandatory, as Petilil outspeeds the unboosted metagame and has better offensive presence under the sun. Setting up sun before Petilil switches in can also allow it to Speed tie with +2 Shell Smash Sweepers such as Omanyte and Shellder and outspeed Tirtouga to revenge kill them. Petilil should never be left in against foes that threaten it with a potential OHKO, such as Ponyta and Skrelp. Petilil will perform best when faced with Pokemon that have a significant weakness to Grass-types, such as Water-, Electric-, and Ground-types, but be careful of potential coverage moves such as Ice Beam on Chinchou. Healing Wish should be used when Petilil is low on health to make full use of Petilil's longevity, or could be used as a strategy to bring a teammate safely into the battle, even if they are healthy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vulpix and an additional Chlorophyll sweeper, ideally Bellsprout, are mandatory teammates as they both gain quite a lot from Petilil's presence; Petilil complements Vulpix by resisting its weaknesses to Ground and Water and helps other Chlorophyll sweepers like Bellsprout by allowing them to run another move over Sleep Powder. Furthermore, since Bellsprout and other Chlorophyll sweepers can get weakened by Life Orb recoil and resisted priority attacks or might get statused by moves like Thunder Wave, they appreciate Petilil healing them completely with the use of Healing Wish so they can continue to fulfill their roles without hesitation. Flying- and Fire- type checks such as Chinchou, Onix, Tirtouga, and Omanyte make good teammates, as Petilil has trouble handling them. Checks to Ice- and Poison-types such as Pawniard and Magnemite are also good teammates. Stealth Rock and Knock off users are handy for weakening Vullaby and Foongus to allow Petilil to get a potential KO on them.</p>"

  "Sandile": {
    "overview": "<p>Sandile's unique STAB type combination is resisted by just two Pokemon in the entire LC metagame: Cottonee and Vullaby. Sandile has access to a powerful ability in Moxie. With Moxie, Sandile steadily gains strength when sweeping and becomes very powerful after a boost. Its movepool is also quite extensive, including moves such as Fire Fang and Aqua Tail. It is also quite fast, making it an effective Choice Scarf user. To top it all off, Sandile can provide useful Pursuit support. However, Sandile also has many weaknesses to many common types. Its lack of bulk also means it can't take priority hits, and it's even weak to a few priority moves such as Aqua Jet and Ice Shard. Sandile faces stiff competition from Pawniard and Drilbur as Dark- and Ground-type sweepers. It is also very easily worn down by status and entry hazards, and its lack of power before Moxie boosts also means that Sandile struggles to break through walls. Finally, Sandile lacks access to Knock Off, unlike other Dark-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Fang hits potential Water-type switch-ins and Vullaby, but it has little use outside of this. Choice Band can make Sandile very powerful, but the Speed provided by Choice Scarf is much more appreciated; in a similar vein, Life Orb can be used, but the recoil from Life Orb wears down Sandile very quickly. Stealth Rock can be used, although Sandile lacks the bulk to properly set it up. Hone Claws is Sandile's only form of boosting its Attack outside of Moxie and makes Stone Edge much more reliable. Aqua Tail gets nice coverage, although it is fairly weak against Pokemon it is neutral against. Foul Play is an interesting move, but Crunch's reliability is often preferred. Finally, Iron Tail puts massive hurt on Fairy-types; however, it is very unreliable and gets horrible coverage otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types resist Crunch and often have the bulk to tank Sandile's other moves.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Fighting-, Grass-, Ice-, and Water-type moves all put a serious hurt on Sandile. Grass-types work especially well because they resist Earthquake; Cottonee also resists Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types are immune to Earthquake and can set up on Choice-locked Sandile.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Passive damage such as Spikes wears Sandile down because it lacks reliable recovery. Will-O-Wisp in particular completely ruins its sweep and wears it down quickly.</p>",

      "Bulky Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock lets Sandile provide its team with a lot of utility, being useful for breaking Sturdy and potential Focus Sashes. Taunt prevents foes from setting hazards,as well as stopping foes like Porygon from using status and healing moves. It also can be used to annoy Ferroseed and bulky Tirtouga, which like to take advantage of the free turn they gain from forcing Sandile out to set hazards. Pursuit is an option to grab chip damage on foes like Fletchling as they try to switch out. It is also useful for eliminating Gothita after it picks off something with Psychic or Thunderbolt. Earthquake provides it with a solid source of damage. Stone Edge grants Sandile the ability to threaten Flying-types such as Vullaby and Archen, which would otherwise be able to come in and Defog for free. Finally, Crunch is another option for a STAB move, granting Sandile super effective coverage on certain bulkier Pokemon, most notably Pumpkaboo and Slowpoke.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Intimidate is the ideal ability for this set, as it helps mitigate Sandile's admittedly poor bulk. Eviolite effectively gives Sandile decent 21 / 18 / 15 bulk, which allows it to survive certain attacks it would otherwise not, such as Fletchling's +1 Acrobatics and Chinchou's Scald from full health. Maximum Speed EVs with a Jolly nature are necessary because it allows Sandile to hit the crucial 17 Speed tier that allows it to Speed tie with many top threats like Onix, Mienfoo, and Archen. 17 Speed also grants Sandile the best chances at both setting entry hazards and preventing them from being laid in return, most notably from Dwebble, whic honly hits 16 Speed. 156 Defense EVs allow Sandile to avoid a 2HKO from itemless Archen's Acrobatics after the Attack drop from Intimidate and OHKO back with Stone Edge. The remaining EVs are thrown into Attack in order to allow Sandile to maintain a bit of offensive presence.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Sandile into Rock-types such as Onix and Dwebble and use Taunt and set Stealth Rock as soon as possible; this should be done especially on opposing entry hazard setters or when you expect your opponent to predict your switch out. Despite Sandile's poor bulk, it can usually take a weak super effective attack like Croagunk's Vacuum Wave or U-turn, so don't be afraid to make an aggressive play in order to gain a potential advantage. Don't be too scared about switching into Pawniard and giving it a Defiant boost, because Sandile can still outspeed it and threaten it with Earthquake. When running Pursuit, bringing Sandile in on Gothita after it has used Psychic or Thunderbolt to pick off something is a great opportunity to eliminate it. Other potential targets to trap include slower Ghost-types like Pumpkaboo and Frillish, though making that play is sometimes tricky, as they can threaten Sandile with their STAB moves and aren't KOed should they not switch out. If Sandile isn't doing too much for you mid- or late-game and there is a threatening physical attacker on the opposing team, switching Sandile in to get off an Intimidate can be potentially game saving.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Croagunk has really nice type synergy with Sandile, dealing with the Grass-, Water-, and Fighting-types that give Sandile trouble. However, a more secure Fighting-type check than Croagunk is mandatory, especially for threats like Scraggy and Timburr, because while Sandile can prevent setup with Taunt, it doesn't exactly want to stay in on them. This makes Cottonee, which can not only check Fighting-type threats by virtue of typing but also punish setup with Encore, a fantastic option for a teammate. Fletchling and other Flying-types enjoy Sandile's ability to deal with Rock- and Steel-types. Staryu is particularly annoying for Sandile, as Eviolite sets can come in on it without fail and proceed to spin away its entry hazards and Recover off any damage Sandile may have done to them, so a teammate such as Pumpkaboo, which not only threatens Staryu with its Grass STAB moves but also blocks Rapid Spin, is recommended.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is a very powerful STAB move that Sandile can utilize to clean up weakened teams. Crunch adds to Sandile's great coverage, hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types hard. Fire Fang is used to break through Ferroseed and Cottonee, while providing nice all-around coverage. Pursuit is useful for trapping Psychic- and Ghost-types, but Stone Edge can be used instead to hit Flying-types attempting to switch into Earthquake.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed EVs give Sandile the highest Attack and Speed possible, while adding an additional point to Defense. Choice Scarf bolsters Sandile's Speed and gives it a chance to sweep when coupled with Moxie. An Adamant nature is preferred to make Sandile as hard hitting as possible, since Adamant Choice Scarf Sandile still outspeeds most of the metagame with its 24 Speed; however, a Jolly nature can be used if Sandile needs to outspeed Choice Scarf Chinchou. Choice Band and Life Orb are also candidates for items, but the immediate Speed provided by Choice Scarf is much more beneficial.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sandile must be wary of being locked into certain moves; for example, Earthquake should be used sparingly when the opponent carries a Flying-type, and the same goes for using Crunch when the opponent has a Fairy-type, etc. Try to avoid being locked into Fire Fang and Pursuit if possible, as these moves are not very powerful without boosts, and Sandile does not always have the luxury of attaining a boost. Bringing Sandile in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is needed, as it lacks bulk and has many weaknesses. Walls should be broken down early game so Sandile has an easier time sweeping late-game. Don't attempt to set up Moxie boosts early on in the match, as Sandile will often not be powerful enough to steamroll opposing teams by itself.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Ghost-types, such as Mienfoo and Bunnelby, make good partners. Trubbish is a good partner because it provides Spikes support to wear down the opposition and resists Sandile's Fighting-, Fairy-, and Grass-type weaknesses; Sandile can take Psychic-type moves in return. Pawniard provides Knock Off support, removing opponents' Eviolites, which is crucial for Sandile because it needs the support to break through bulkier Pokemon. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Archen and Dwebble is helpful to wear down Flying-type Pokemon attempting to switch into Earthquake. Fairy-types, such as Spritzee and Snubbull, are good partners to handle Dark-, Fighting-, and Bug-types for Sandile.</p>"

  "Darumaka": {
    "overview": "<p>Darumaka is a big offensive threat thanks to its base 90 Attack stat, the Hustle ability, which boosts the power of its attacks by 50%, and good movepool. Darumaka's access to U-turn makes it a good Choice Scarf and Choice Band user, and it also has access to solid coverage options in Rock Slide and Superpower. However, while Hustle boosts Darumaka's Attack stat to monstrous levels, it is also arguably one of Darumaka's biggest problems, as it lowers the accuracy of its moves by 20%. As Darumaka can't afford to hold Eviolite, if one of its moves either misses or fails to KO the foe, it can easily be KOed back. Darumaka is also weak to Stealth Rock and can easily be revenge killed with Aqua Jet or Sucker Punch. Flare Blitz's recoil further decreases Darumaka's longevity.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Punch is an option over Flare Blitz if you are worried about Darumaka taking recoil, but it's far from being as powerful as Flare Blitz. Flame Charge is an option to patch up Darumaka's middling Speed, though the coverage options listed are usually better for their overall offensive potential, and they are a lot easier to take advantage of with Choice Scarf's immediate Speed boost. Darumaka can make use of Yawn to force switches and Will-O-Wisp to punish physically offensive foes; however, Darumaka is, in almost all cases, better off just outright attacking. Darumaka can also use Substitute on a forced switch, though the HP loss from Substitute generally doesn't help given Darumaka's already dwindling life expectancy. Life Orb can be used to boost the power of Darumaka's attacks, but it is generally a bad option, as Darumaka already takes sufficient recoil from its primary STAB move and Life Orb exacerbates this problem.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ponyta, Houndour, and other Flash Fire users can come in on Flare Blitz easily, but none enjoy getting hit by Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Thunder Wave users with Prankster, such as Cottonee and Purrloin, can easily render Darumaka pretty much useless, though Darumaka can often KO foes it is faster than and therefore avoid getting paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Chinchou and Shellos can switch into Choice Scarf Darumaka fairly comfortably, but will struggle to avoid the 2HKO if Darumaka is using a Choice Band. On the other hand, Choice Band Darumaka fails to 2HKO Slowpoke.</p> <p><strong>Thick Fat Munchlax</strong>: Thick Fat Munchlax can switch into Flare Blitz with relative ease and cause Darumaka to take a lot of recoil due to Munchlax's super high HP stat. However, Munchlax will struggle to withstand a Flare Blitz from Choice Band Darumaka after Stealth Rock damage and is easily OHKOed by Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Entry hazards are one of Darumaka's biggest issues. Stealth Rock is especially troubling, as Darumaka is weak to it, but Darumaka doesn't enjoy Spikes or Sticky Web either.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Pokemon with priority moves can easily wear down Darumaka due to its lack of bulk, especially Aqua Jet users such as Tirtouga and Corphish.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is a very powerful Fire-type STAB move that punches huge holes into the opponent's team, even if enemies only take neutral damage. U-turn is obligatory for a Choice Scarf or Choice Band user and is used to maintain momentum on predicted switches as the opponent panics to find the safest switch-in. Rock Slide is awesome coverage for hitting the Fire-types that resist both Flare Blitz and U-turn and is also useful for hitting Flying-types such as Archen. Superpower is a very potent coverage move, being super effective on five types, and rounds out Darumaka's moveset nicely.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Attack and Speed EVs maximize Darumaka's offensive capabilities, and the remaining EVs are invested into HP to improve Darumaka's overall bulk. With Hustle, a Jolly nature, and Choice Scarf, Darumaka effectively has an Attack stat of 27 and a Speed stat of 22, making it a highly threatening force to be reckoned with in terms of power, speed, and ability to gain momentum. Darumaka's Attack stat with a Choice Band reaches a mind-blowing value of 40 with a Jolly nature, and is guaranteed to hit any target that doesn't resist the move Darumaka is using extremely hard.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Prediction is very important when using Darumaka; if you mispredict the opponent's switch, you will give them a free turn you might regret. Make use of U-turn and use your other moves very carefully; a Pokemon with Flash Fire switching into Darumaka's Flare Blitz is a total momentum shift. Try to keep Darumaka from taking too much damage from entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock, because its health is limited enough as it is, and it's not the easiest thing to pass a Wish to. Make sure Darumaka switches in safely on something it can really threaten; slow Volt Switch and U-turn users really help with ensuring this.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Diglett is a great teammate for Darumaka, being able to trap and KO Chinchou and Ponyta. Darumaka can also get Diglett in easily by using U-turn on a predicted switch. Foongus makes a good teammate for dealing with Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types that might give Darumaka problems. Entry hazard removal support is greatly appreciated by Darumaka, as its Stealth Rock weakness really hampers its survivability, which is further hampered by Flare Blitz's recoil. Good entry hazard removers that synergize well with Darumaka include Archen, which can check Fletchling and Fire-types and has access to U-turn itself, and Staryu, which can deal with Ponyta and Rock-types. Chinchou and Mienfoo can cover Darumaka's weaknesses to Water and Rock, respectively, while also forming a solid VoltTurn core with it, which allows Darumaka to switch in without fear. Vulpix can offer Drought support, which makes Flare Blitz hit incredibly hard. Vulpix and Darumaka can also help wear down each other's shared counters. Watch out for their shared weaknesses to Rock, Ground, and Water, though.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Yamask's Ghost typing and excellent Defense make it a great stop to Normal- and Fighting-types, and Mummy lets it nullify the useful abilities of contact attackers. Its wide movepool allows it to support its team in many ways, such as with Will-O-Wisp and Toxic Spikes or through Trick Room, which works well with its terrible Speed. However, without Trick Room, Yamask's low Speed hampers its capacity for support. It is also weak to Knock Off, and its low HP and lack of reliable recovery leave it prone to being worn down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Trick + Choice Specs can be used to heavily cripple physical attackers and let Yamask fire off more powerful attacks. To patch up its low Speed, Yamask can use an offensive Trick Room set consisting of Trick Room / Nasty Plot / Shadow Ball / Energy Ball. Hidden Power Fighting gives Yamask unresisted coverage in tandem with a STAB move and deals decent damage to many of its checks, including Pawniard and Scraggy. Magic Coat allows Yamask to bounce back entry hazards and Toxic Spikes lets it set them, but it doesn't have spare moveslots for these moves.</p> <p>Destiny Bond lets Yamask remove a single threat, and Haze allows it to neuter setup sweepers; however, it's much too slow to make use of these moves, and every setup sweeper either beats Yamask regardless or is crippled more effectively by Will-O-Wisp than by Haze. Disable can be used after a predicted Knock Off from a Fighting-type such as Mienfoo so that it can't touch Yamask afterwards, but Yamask will take heavy damage and lose its Eviolite in the process. Calm Mind looks good on paper for its ability to boost both Yamask's mediocre Special Defense and its average Special Attack, but Yamask is much too slow to function as a setup sweeper, and its weaknesses to Shadow Sneak, Sucker Punch, and Knock Off only exacerbate this fact. Yamask can use Energy Ball and Psychic to hit Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types and Fighting- and Poison-types, respectively, but it doesn't have the moveslots or power to use these moves effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Pawniard, Scraggy, Vullaby, and Stunky are great counters to Yamask because of its Ghost typing, low Speed, and inability to do anything back. Pawniard, Vullaby, and Scraggy can 2HKO Yamask with Knock Off if they aren't burnt, while Stunky can Pursuit trap it. Additionally, Pawniard gains an Attack boost from Memento thanks to Defiant, Scraggy can rid itself of Will-O-Wisp burns with Shed Skin, and Vullaby can Roost off any damage from Yamask's attacks. However, these Dark-types have to be wary of Will-O-Wisp on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt from the likes of Mienfoo completely shuts Yamask down, preventing it from supporting its team and forcing it to either resort to its weak attacks or switch out, giving the opponent momentum. Almost all Taunt users are also faster than Yamask due to its low Speed, but they can be played around by switching to a teammate that isn't crippled as much by Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Yamask is weak to Knock Off, and strong users of the move such as Pawniard and Vullaby can remove its Eviolite and deal heavy damage to it in one fell swoop. Trick or Switcheroo users such as Buneary and Gothita can neuter Yamask by giving it a Choice item while taking its Eviolite.</p> <p><strong>Defiant Users</strong>: Pawniard and the rarer Mankey can take advantage of Yamask's Memento, gaining a huge Attack boost from it. Pawniard in particular is a huge threat to Yamask, as it has access to priority Sucker Punch, STAB Knock Off, and Swords Dance. Competitive users can also take advantage of Memento in this way, but there are no viable ones in LC.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Will-O-Wisp from Ponyta and Larvesta, Stealth Rock from Ferroseed and Drilbur, and chip damage from various attacks can quickly wear Yamask down due to its lack of reliable recovery; however, a Wish user can help mitigate this issue.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: While Gastly can't switch in because of its inability to OHKO Yamask, it can still deal irreparable damage to Yamask with Shadow Ball and isn't crippled too much by Will-O-Wisp or Pain Split due to its being a special attacker and having low HP. Pumpkaboo is able to take a weakened Yamask down with priority Shadow Sneak, but it has to be wary of Shadow Ball, Will-O-Wisp, and Pain Split.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers that can take a hit from Yamask, such as Chinchou and Spritzee, can switch in and dent Yamask by hitting its weaker Special Defense. Chinchou can cure its team of Will-O-Wisp burns using Heal Bell and pivot out of its switch-in with Volt Switch, while Spritzee can do the same with Aromatherapy and heal off the damage dealt using Wish.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes lets Yamask support Pokemon that use Hex or stall enemies out. Yamask is able to block attempts to Rapid Spin away Toxic Spikes. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers and is easily spread throughout the opposing team thanks to Yamask's good bulk. Knock Off can be used to support the team by removing opposing Pokemon's Eviolite, Berry Juice, Life Orb, or Choice Scarf. Hex synergizes well with Will-O-Wisp and Toxic Spikes but is weak when the target is not statused. Memento allows Yamask to sacrifice itself and let a teammate set up more easily by lowering the foe's offenses. Pain Split works well with Yamask's low HP stat, healing it somewhat reliably while damaging the foe.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Mummy cripples Pokemon that rely on their ability and make contact, such as Mienfoo. Eviolite is chosen over Berry Juice to give Yamask even more bulk and to let it take Knock Off better. Maximum Defense investment is used to capitalize on Yamask's solid Defense stat, while 76 Special Defense EVs and a Sassy nature hit an Eviolite number to give Yamask maximum bulk. The remaining EVs boost Yamask's HP and Attack by one point each. If Knock Off is not used, an EV spread of 52 HP / 236 Def / 156 SpD / 36 Spe with a Calm nature is preferred.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Set up Toxic Spikes once grounded Poison-types that can absorb it are removed. Spread burns throughout the opposing team to cushion the blows of physical attackers and wear down walls. Remember that you can't burn Fire-types and that you will give some, such as Houndour, a potentially lethal Flash Fire boost by using Will-O-Wisp on the switch; in these situations, predict the opponent's switch to the Flash Fire user and either double switch to an appropriate counter or use a different move. Yamask should switch into physical attackers that don't carry Knock Off and proceed to cripple them with Will-O-Wisp and Mummy, as it can easily wall them; keep it away from Pokemon such as Pawniard that can Knock Off its Eviolite, though. Don't switch Yamask into special or mixed attackers, which prey on its weaker Special Defense, can usually outspeed it, and aren't crippled too much by Will-O-Wisp. Memento should be used mid- or late-game when Yamask is no longer needed to let a partner switch in and set up on the weakened foe. Keep in mind, however, that it can only be used once and that it sacrifices Yamask, so there must be a Pokemon on your team that can take advantage of it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Partners such as Lickitung, Pawniard, and Tirtouga appreciate Yamask's immunity to Fighting-type attacks, which they are weak to. Lickitung provides Wish support and is a specially bulky Pokemon to fall back on if a special attacker proves troublesome for Yamask; Pawniard handles threatening Ghost-types such as Gastly with Knock Off; and Tirtouga can set up on a foe crippled by Yamask's Memento, Will-O-Wisp, and Mummy. Other Wish users, such as Spritzee, Knock Off users, such as Vullaby, and specially defensive Pokemon, such as Munchlax, can be good partners as well. Pokemon that can absorb Knock Off, such as Mienfoo and Trubbish, make for good partners. Mienfoo can also take on Dark-types for Yamask, while Trubbish provides Spikes and Toxic Spikes support, which synergizes well with Hex but can interfere with Yamask's burn spreading. Finally, entry hazard removers such as Archen and Staryu, in addition to Heal Bell or Aromatherapy users such as Chinchou, can help keep Yamask from being worn down.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Trubbish's defensive qualities are very valuable in a metagame filled with Fighting-types and Knock Off, both of which it can deal with thanks to its pure Poison typing and Sticky Hold ability. Because of this, Trubbish is often able to get free turns to set up Spikes or heal with the Recycle + Berry Juice combo, which pairs excellently with Sticky Hold. Despite Trubbish's low offensive presence, it has taken a undisputed advantage from Misdreavus's ban.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic Spikes is a viable alternative to Spikes, but is absorbed by Poison-types. Trubbish can use special attacks such as Sludge Bomb, Dark Pulse, or Hidden Power Fighting alongside Spikes and Recycle; though weaker than their physical alternatives, they aren't affected by burns. Eviolite gives Trubbish more bulk, but it loses its reliable recovery in Recycle paired with Berry Juice. Rock Blast offers coverage against Dwebble and Archen, while Seed Bomb is Trubbish's only way to deal with Ground-types. Clear Smog helps Trubbish prevent setup, but is blocked by Substitute. Finally, Explosion lets Trubbish act as a suicide lead.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Even with Thief or Payback, Ghost-types such as Gastly will not be easy to stop from switching in. Without Dark-type coverage, Trubbish can hardly damage Ghost-types at all.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types can easily KO Trubbish. Diglett has Arena Trap to trap and KO Trubbish. Drilbur has access to Rapid Spin, which removes Trubbish's entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Rapid Spin / Defog</strong>: These remove hazards, and Trubbish has no way to stop this on its own. Archen can switch in repeatedly on Trubbish and remove its entry hazards or threaten a KO with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Abra can OHKO Trubbish with ease if given a free switch, while Slowpoke takes little damage from Gunk Shot and can paralyze or KO Trubbish.</p> <p><strong>Setup</strong>: Pokemon Trubbish is usually called upon to wall, such as Scraggy or Croagunk, can take advantage of its low offensive presence to set up on it if they carry a boosting move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Setting up entry hazards reliably is Trubbish's main draw, so Spikes is the most important move on this set. Recycle allows Trubbish to repeatedly use Berry Juice to heal to full HP after losing half of its health, giving Trubbish great staying power. Gunk Shot is the most powerful STAB move available to Trubbish, and it hits decently hard against neutral targets despite Trubbish's low base Attack. Drain Punch is mainly for Pawniard, which Trubbish checks, but also hits other Steel-types that are immune to Gunk Shot super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and a Jolly nature give Trubbish 17 Speed, enough to Speed tie with Mienfoo and outspeed non-Choice Scarf Pawniard. The rest of the EVs are mainly put into Defense in order to tank Knock Offs better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Trubbish can easily switch in on most Fighting- and Fairy-types or Knock Off users and set up a layer of Spikes, however, be wary of Taunt users when doing so. Trubbish is weak to the most common trapping Pokemon, Diglett and Gothita, so be extra cautious when sending it in against teams with those.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Pawniard and Porygon appreciate Trubbish's ability to wall the Fighting-types that threaten them. Pawniard also provides a way to discourage the use of Defog to remove entry hazards, as it receives a +2 Attack boost from it thanks to Defiant. Late-game cleaners such as Scraggy and Carvanha can sweep easier with Spikes support and therefore enjoy having Trubbish as a teammate. A Ghost-type to block Rapid Spin is a good choice, as Drilbur otherwise has no trouble removing Trubbish's Spikes.</p>"

  "Zorua": {
    "overview": "<p>Zorua is a unique Pokemon in LC thanks to its ability, Illusion, which can trick the opponent into thinking it's another Pokemon, allowing it to avoid getting hit by super effective moves. Zorua also has decent Attack and Special Attack stats, and with access to both Swords Dance and Nasty Plot, it can boost its stats to hit even harder. It also has a high Speed stat, which allows it to hit 17 Speed and outspeed Pokemon such as Pawniard. However, Zorua is very frail, and its Dark typing makes it weak to the many Fighting-types in LC. Its shallow movepool leaves it walled by Fairy-type Pokemon, which means it needs a lot of team support to help deal with these threats. However, thanks to Illusion, Zorua can avoid Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks if it copies a Poison-type Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Swords Dance set with Knock Off, Sucker Punch, and U-turn can also be used. Agility is an option to double Zorua's Speed, but Zorua lacks the raw power to sweep without boosts in its Attack or Special Attack stat, and it also has access to priority in Sucker Punch. Zorua can use Taunt, but most of its counters don't really have a problem with being Taunted, as they usually choose to attack and target Zorua's low defenses. Memento can be used to give the opportunity for a setup sweeper to come in and set up safely. Pursuit is also an option to trap Pokemon such as Gastly while disguised as a Pokemon that threatens the foe. Zorua can also use a Choice Scarf set with Trick.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types can deal with Zorua unless it has Extrasensory. Priority Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave from Timburr and Croagunk, respectively, deal a lot of damage to Zorua. Scraggy is also a nice counter as it's immune to Extrasensory.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull can wall Zorua and take it down with Moonblast and Play Rough, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Zorua cannot beat Dark-type Pokemon such as Vullaby that can tank its attacks. Pawniard also deals with Zorua as long as it doesn't carry Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users and Faster Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf users can easily revenge kill Zorua because of its low defenses; faster Pokemon can also play the same role but some such as Gastly must be wary of Sucker Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Zorua's otherwise mediocre Special Attack, allowing it to sweep through teams if its counters have been worn down. Knock Off can be used instead of Nasty Plot to remove items, as Zorua won't always have the opportunity to set up. Dark Pulse is Zorua's main STAB move, though Night Daze can be used too, as it has a 40% chance to lower the opponent's accuracy. Extrasensory is Zorua's only option to to hurt Fighting-types that would otherwise wall Zorua. U-turn is also another option to hurt Dark-types and gain offensive momentum, while Hidden Power Fighting can be used to deal with Dark-types, notably Pawniard, that might be a problem.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set uses Life Orb to help Zorua deal more damage, and with maximum investment and positive nature, it hits 17 Speed, which allows it to outspeed Pokemon such as Pawniard. 0 HP IVs are used to make Life Orb recoil deal only one HP. If using Hidden Power Fighting, the EV spread should be changed to 40 Def / 200 SpA / 240 Spe to account for the drop in IVs.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Zorua uses Illusion to keep super effective moves away; it mainly disguises itself as a Poison-type to keep Fairy-, Fighting-, and Bug-type attacks away and trick the opponent into using Psychic-type attacks. If Zorua is using Nasty Plot, it's preferable to not set up with Zorua until its checks and counters have been removed so that it can sweep without the fear of being revenge killed. Instead, try to set up when a Pokemon is forced out by whatever Zorua is disguised by. Also, it's preferred that Zorua is at full health, as a difference in HP between it and the Pokemon it's copying might let the opponent know that it's actually Zorua.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Dwebble and Tirtouga can assist Zorua in sweeping. Another great example is Trubbish, as it's able to set up Spikes and also deal with Fairy- and Fighting-types; in return, Zorua deals with Psychic-types that threaten Trubbish. Hazard removers such as Drilbur and Archen are also important, as the damage received from entry hazards might ruin Illusion. Fletchling and other Flying-type Pokemon are also great teammates, as they help take down Fighting-types. Pokemon that can take down Fairy-types that Zorua cannot deal with are also necessary; examples include Magnemite, Pawniard, Trubbish, and Gastly.</p>"

  "Minccino": {
    "overview": "<p>Minccino's access to both Tail Slap and Skill Link makes it a very capable sweeper. The Knock Off buff gave Minccino a reliable way to hit Ghost-types and with Misdreavus's ban, 18 Speed is a comfortable speed tier. These factors allow Minccino to be a prominent late-game threat, applying pressure to the opponent, all while being able to pivot out with a well-timed U-turn. Unfortunately, Minccino only has one move that utilizes Skill Link, Tail Slap, and is rather frail, making it weak to priority attacks. Its Normal-typing also leaves it weak to the common Fighting-type moves that run rampant in Little Cup. Aipom usually outshines Minccino due to its superior bulk, Speed, and movepool, but it does lack Tail Slap which has a higher accuracy then Aipom's Skill Link moves. However, its positives do outshine the negatives and Minccino can be a brutal sweeper with proper team support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute is a decent option, as it does allow Minccino to avoid Sucker Punch, but Minccino's coverage moves are usually much more beneficial. Minccino can take advantage of its colorful support movepool, with options like Thunder Wave and Tickle, but lacks the bulk to reliably harass the opponent throughout the game. King's Rock is a rather annoying possibility, but is generally inferior to Life Orb due to its inconsistency. Protect can be used to block Fake Out and scout opposing movesets, but Minccino's inability to give up a moveslot generally doesn't allow for this. Aqua Tail has a higher Base Power than Wake-Up Slap, but doesn't hit Steel-type Pokemon and otherwise provides redundant coverage. Encore can be a great way to stunt set up sweepers and provide a free turn for Minccino to deal some damage and cripple opposing Pokemon with Knock Off. Eviolite gives Minccino some bulk but sacrifices the Attack and Speed boosts of Life Orb and Choice Scarf, respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types make good counters to Minccino, but usually don't enjoy getting hit by Wake-Up Slap. Ferroseed in particular is an excellent means of dealing with Minccino, as it rips off a large portion of Minccino's health simply by switching into Tail Slap, due to Iron Barbs.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Priority users, such as Pawniard, Timburr, and Croagunk, can override Minccino's Speed and maim it with their priority moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Choice Scarf Pokemon and Pokemon that reach 19 Speed, such as Ponyta, can outspeed Minccino and capitalize on its frailty.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types, such as Dwebble, Tyrunt, and Tirtouga, can switch in and set up on Minccino, but must be wary of Knock Off, Wake-Up Slap, and Seed Bomb, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fast Ghost-types</strong>: Fast Ghost-types such as Gastly can switch in on Tail Slap and set up a Substitute or hit Minccino with a Sludge Bomb, but must take care to avoid Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Common Fighting-type Pokemon can survive a Tail Slap and hit Minccino with a super effective STAB move.</p>",

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tail Slap is Minccino's main STAB attack, smashing most of the metagame for good damage in tandem with Skill Link. Knock Off is an excellent coverage move, hitting Ghost-types which would otherwise wall Minccino. U-turn allows Minccino to escape unfavorable matchups and still deal decent damage. Wake-Up Slap provides Minccino with a means to hit Steel-types, such as Pawniard, that would otherwise survive a Tail Slap or Knock Off. Seed Bomb can be chosen instead to hit Omanyte and Tirtouga, which otherwise survive a Wake-Up Slap and proceed to Shell Smash.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb boosts the damage Minccino deals and causes Tail Slap to become quite powerful thanks to Little Cup's unique damage rolls. The EVs maximize Attack and Speed, with the remainder invested in Defense and Special Defense to slightly increase Minccino's bulk. Jolly is the preferred nature, as it allows Minccino to outspeed Jolly Mienfoo, Drilbur, and Archen and also Speed tie with Pokemon such as Gastly, Stunky, and Doduo.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Minccino is rather frail, so switching into a strong attack will severely hamper its longevity; however, if Minccino can switch in safely, it can be a dangerous threat. Knock Off can be a nice way to soften up strong physical walls and remove their item, and can punish an opponent attempting to switch their Ghost-type into a predicted Tail Slap. U-turn is to switch out of unfavorable match-ups as well as pivot out of a predicted switch-in. Wake-Up Slap is to hit Steel-types, most notably Pawniard, and Seed Bomb is to neuter mainly Omanyte and Tirtouga, along with uncommon Rock / Ground-types.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because this set functions primarily as a wallbreaker and secondary sweeper, set up sweepers, such as Scraggy and Tirtouga, make good teammates as they appreciate the removal of bulkier opponents. Larvesta and Spritzee are also good partners with their resistances to Fighting-type attacks. Entry hazard support, particularly Stealth Rock, is helpful for netting KOs; as such, Dwebble and Drilbur make good teammates, the latter being able to Rapid Spin hazards your opponent might have set. Sticky Web can be useful to outspeed some Choice Scarf Pokemon and 19 Speed Pokemon, but its usually not necessary. Bulky pivots are helpful, as they can take strong priority attacks that would otherwise harm Minccino.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tail Slap is the STAB attack of choice due to its fantastic combination with Skill Link and the unique damage rolls of Little Cup. Knock Off hits Ghost-type Pokemon, and U-turn is Minccino's escape route from unfavorable match-ups, as well as a scouting tool. Wake-Up Slap hits Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon, most notably Pawniard, and Seed Bomb is to hit Omanyte and Tirtouga.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs allow Minccino to capitalize on its good Speed and Attack stats and outpace a large portion of the tier. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Minccino's maxed out 17 Speed skyrockets up to an impressive 25, outspeeding every unboosted Pokemon in the tier, as well as more than a few Choice Scarf Pokemon. Jolly is useful for outspeeding +2 Modest Omanyte, Modest Bellsprout under the sun, and a couple of other Shell Smashers; however, Adamant can be used for a larger damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This moveset functions well as both a late-game cleaner and a revenge killer. Knock Off and U-turn are the most useful early-game moves, weakening opponents and making it easier for both Minccino and its teammates to clean up later in the match. Removing opposing Normal-type immunities and resists should be a top priority, so predicting and KOing incoming Ghost-, Steel-, and Rock-type switch-ins is incredibly helpful.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates that can remove Steel-, Rock-, and Ghost-type Pokemon are essential. Drilbur makes a fantastic teammate with its access to Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin, and Mold Breaker Earthquake, the latter being able to hit Gastly as well as Steel- and Rock-types for super effective damage. Mienfoo can switch into both Rock- and Steel-types and forms a nice U-turn core with Minccino. Stunky and Pawniard both make decent teammates with their ability to trap and KO opposing Ghost-types with Pursuit. Magnemite is also a useful teammate, as it can trap and defeat opposing Steel-types with Hidden Power Fire, Fighting, or Ground, depending on what Pokemon threaten your team the most.</p>"

Sadly, Solosis has average bulk and is weak to Knock Off, which hinders its durability. Solosis is also outclassed by Abra outside of Trick Room teams, as Solosis needs Trick Room to function well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb can be used in conjunction with Magic Guard to hit even harder, although Solosis won't be able to take attacks very well without Eviolite. Overcoat may be used so that Solosis can switch into Foongus's Spore and threaten it, but this is rarely necessary. Substitute may replace Shadow Ball so that Solosis can avoid Pawniard's Sucker Punch and KO it with Hidden Power Fighting. Thunder can replace Shadow Ball or Hidden Power Fighting in order to hit Vullaby and other Flying-types, although its lack of accuracy makes it unreliable. Solosis can use Recover over Shadow Ball to have a more reliable form of recovery than Regenerator, but Solosis doesn't have the time to recover its health while Trick Room is active, and Regenerator is usually sufficient recovery. Thunder Wave can replace Trick Room so that Solosis can cripple, outspeed, and possibly KO its checks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stunky</strong>: Stunky is immune to Psychic, resists Shadow Ball, and is neutral to Hidden Power Fighting. Stunky can trap Solosis with Pursuit or KO it with Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off removes Solosis's Eviolite and thus its bulk, and after that, most attacks will be able to finish Solosis off.</p> <p><strong>Pawniard</strong>: Pawniard can KO Solosis with Sucker Punch 81.3% of the time after Stealth Rock damage, unless Solosis is carrying Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Vullaby</strong>: Vullaby can take any of Solosis's attacks except Thunder, then use Roost to recover any health lost and KO Solosis with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Normal-types</strong>: Bulky Normal-types such as Porygon and Lickitung, are able to take Hidden Power Fighting and Psychic and regain their health with Recover and Wish, respectively. Munchlax is able to Pursuit trap Solosis without taking too much damage from Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Protect stalls out Trick Room turns, which is very disadvantageous for Solosis.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out</strong>: Fake Out also stalls out Trick Room turns and wears Solosis down as well.</p>",

Shadow Ball offers coverage against Ghost-types, such as Gastly, as well as opposing Psychic-types such as Abra. Hidden Power Fighting can OHKO Pawniard and hit some other Dark-type Pokemon. It also hits Steel-type Pokemon such as Magnemite.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The spread's purpose is to maximize Special Attack, putting Solosis at 22 Special Attack. The rest of the EVs go into bulk, allowing a healthy Solosis to survive one Shadow Ball from Gastly or one Sucker Punch from Pawniard when its holding Eviolite. 1 Attack IV is used so that Solosis's Hidden Power type is Fighting, while also minimizing damage from Foul Play and confusion. 0 Speed IVs ensure that Solosis is slower than the opponent, which is crucial for it to function effectively under Trick Room. Regenerator allows Solosis to regain some of its health in order to prolong its longevity. Magic Guard can be used to avoid all passive damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>After Solosis has set up Trick Room, it can either start denting the opponent's team or switch out to regain some health if its ability is Regenerator. Solosis should not get hit by Knock Off, which will take away its Eviolite-granted bulk. It's also recommended that Solosis doesn't get hit by super effective attacks until it's ready to sweep, so that Regenerator can restore most of the health loss and Solosis can switch back in and set up Trick Room more often. If Solosis is using Regenerator as its ability, it can be used as a bulky pivot early- or mid-game to set up Trick Room for its teammates while it recovers its health when switching out. If Solosis is using Magic Guard as its ability, it can be used to take status, such as burn and poison, without the fear of being worn down. Solosis can also use Life Orb as its item when it has Magic Guard as its ability, as Magic Guard prevents Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mienfoo and Timburr can use Knock Off to remove Eviolite from opposing Pokemon and take down Pawniard and Porygon, which are common switch-ins to Solosis. Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull can KO Vullaby, which is able to take all of Solosis's attacks. Steel-types usually give Solosis a hard time, which makes Magnemite, which can trap and KO them, a great partner. Slow sweepers such as Azurill, Bunnelby, Cubone, and Trapinch benefit from Solosis's wallbreaking capabilities and ability to set up Trick Room.</p>"

It also has access to the newly buffed Knock Off, giving it a great coverage and utility move that hits Ghost-types super effectively and gets rid of Eviolite and Berry Juice held by opposing Pokemon. Both of these great moves are backed by a very good base 75 Attack stat, which reaches 18 with an Adamant nature and max investment. Another great boon for Karrablast is its access to Swords Dance, meaning it can easily double its already decent Attack stat. Last but not least, Karrablast's Bug typing means it resists the prevalent Fighting-type moves in LC.</p> <p>While Karrablast's Bug typing gives it an amazing resistance to Fighting-type moves, it also gives it weaknesses to Fletchling's Acrobatics and the ever-present Stealth Rock. Another problem is that while Karrablast resists Fighting-type moves, it has trouble taking down bulky Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr, which resist both Megahorn and Knock Off. Another problem with Karrablast is that its decent 16 Speed stat means a lot of prominent threats outspeed it if it doesn't hold a Choice Scarf, such as Abra, fast Mienfoo, Archen, and Timid Chinchou.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aerial Ace is a good option for taking on Fighting-types, but it doesn't offer much else in terms of coverage, and bulky Fighting-types such as Mienfoo can heal back the damage with Drain Punch and Regenerator. Choice Band or Life Orb can be used over Choice Scarf; however, Karrablast's problem is its Speed stat and not its power. Double-Edge and Return are powerful, but provide no coverage. Shed Skin can get rid of a stray burn, but No Guard is the superior ability because it allows Karrablast to continue spamming Megahorn. X-Scissor can be used in conjunction with Shed Skin, but Megahorn's raw power is superior.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Croagunk, and Timburr can all take on Karrablast, as they resist its STAB move and Karrablast tends not to run coverage for Fighting-types. Mienfoo can overpower Karrablast with a full-power Acrobatics or use U-turn to switch out to something that can reliably take out Karrablast. Croagunk 4x resists Megahorn and can hit back with a STAB Sludge Bomb or Gunk Shot. Timburr can set up in front of Karrablast and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Fletchling is a huge problem for Karrablast, as Gale Wings Acrobatics outprioritizes even the Choice Scarf set, and the Eviolite set doesn't tend to run coverage for Fletchling and still dies to an unboosted Acrobatics. Vullaby is another problem, as it can OHKO Karrablast with Brave Bird while avoiding the 2HKO from Karrablast's Megahorn if it is at full health.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Intimidate Snubbull completely neuters Karrablast, as its resistance to Megahorn and the Attack drop mean Karrablast cannot overpower Snubbull. Spritzee is also bulky enough to take a hit and can easily set up Calm Minds in front of Karrablast.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Ponyta is a thorn in Karrablast's side, as not only does it resist Megahorn, it also has Flame Body to potentially cripple Karrablast with a burn. Intimidate Growlithe is like Snubbull in that it resists Megahorn and neuters Karrablast with the Attack drop.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Rock-types</strong>: Tirtouga and Archen can easily take a Megahorn and threaten Karrablast with a Rock-type STAB move. Archen can potentially have a Flying-type STAB move as well.</p> <p><strong>Walls</strong>: Porygon and Hippopotas can stall out Choice Scarf Karrablast's Megahorn if they haven't lost their Eviolites through Knock Off, as they both can avoid the 2HKO.</p>",

Drill Run is super effective against other types that resist Megahorn, such as Poison-, Fire-, and Steel-types, as well as hitting Rock- and Electric-types. Poison Jab is another move that hits Fairy-types, which resist Megahorn.

The rest of the EVs are dumped into Defense, allowing Karrablast to take physical priority moves more easily. No Guard is a great ability for Karrablast, allowing it to not have to worry about missing Megahorn or Drill Run. A Jolly nature is preferred, as it allows Karrablast to Speed tie with Jolly Choice Scarf Cranidos, Jolly Choice Scarf Bunnelby, +1 Jolly Carvanha, and Timid Choice Scarf Chinchou.

This set can also force switches, as a 120 Base Power STAB move is going to take a chunk out of anything that doesn't resist it and/or isn't very bulky.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Archen is an amazing partner for Karrablast, as it takes care of the Fighting- and Flying-types that resist Karrablast's Megahorn and gets rid of Fletchling, Karrablast's main issue. Archen is also a great entry hazard setter and remover, with Stealth Rock and Defog in its arsenal. Bulky Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr can get rid of Steel-types that stop Karrablast from spamming Megahorn. Poison-types such as Foongus and Croagunk are great partners as well, as they can take down the Fairy-types that resist Megahorn. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Dwebble, Trubbish, and Ferroseed is necessary for Karrablast, securing some crucial 2HKOs and OHKOs and allowing Karrablast to continue spamming Megahorn. Tirtouga is especially helpful in this role, as it resists Flying and Fire, two of Karrablast's weaknesses, and can provide Stealth Rock support. Larvesta is a good partner, as it has a slow U-turn which can bring Karrablast in safely, and they weaken each other's counters. Due to Larvesta's ability, Flame Body, it can also take on Fighting-types a lot more easily than Karrablast can. Entry hazard removal is also necessary, as Karrablast is susceptible to all types of entry hazards. Thus, Pokemon such as Drilbur, Archen, Staryu, Tentacool, and Stunky are recommended to spin or Defog away entry hazards so that Karrablast can reliably perform its role as a revenge killer.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance is a great boosting move, doubling Karrablast's great Attack stat. Megahorn is used as the STAB move because it doesn't miss thanks to No Guard. Drill Run is a great coverage move to hit Poison-, Steel-, and Fire-types, which resist Megahorn. Knock Off acts as a great support move to get rid of the foe's item; it also hits the Ghost-types that resist Megahorn for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Attack EVs and nature get Karrablast to 18 Attack. The Defense and Special Defense EVs allow Karrablast to hit Eviolite numbers. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Speed to give Karrablast 14 Speed, which lets it outspeed every unboosted Pokemon after Sticky Web. Eviolite allows Karrablast to take hits while setting up Swords Dance. With Stealth Rock up, +2 Karrablast is able to OHKO Fletchling and offensive Archen, as well as defensive Chinchou and Cottonee. Karrablast can also run an Impish nature with the given EVs to survive Fletchling's Acrobatics and take it down at +2 after Stealth Rock damage. Swarm can be used in place of No Guard to make Megahorn even stronger, but Karrablast has to be really weakened for Swarm to be truly effective, and a 100% accurate Megahorn is usually better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Karrablast may have a hard time setting up, so try to only set up on crippled Pokemon, such as a burned physical attacker or a sleeping Pokemon. Pivoting moves, such as U-turn and Volt Switch, can give Karrablast a free switch in. Even if you cannot set up, Karrablast is still powerful enough to straight-up attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Archen, Chinchou, and Magnemite are good Pokemon that can not only provide a somewhat slow Volt Switch or U-turn, but also take out Fletchling, which is a huge problem for Karrablast. Fire-types such as Houndour and Vulpix are good partners to absorb Will-O-Wisp and spread burns throughout the opposing team. Sticky Web is an essential entry hazard, as it allows Karrablast to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame; thus, Pokemon such as Surskit and Spinarak are helpful teammates. Other entry hazard support is nice as well, and Pokemon such as Dwebble and Archen can provide easy hazard support. Drilbur and Archen are good Pokemon in general and can provide entry hazard removal via Rapid Spin and Defog, respectively.</p>"

  "Frillish": {
    "overview": "<p>Frillish is one of the only Pokemon that has access to both Water Spout and Trick, meaning that it can Trick its Choice Scarf onto a bulky Pokemon that it can't break through to cripple them. On the offensive side, Frillish has a good coverage in Ice Beam and Energy Ball. Defensively, Frillish has a great typing and ability to spinblock. It is also one of only two Pokemon in LC to receive Cursed Body as an ability, meaning it has a chance to disable its foe's strongest attack. Frillish has access to Recover which allows it to spinblock numerous time throughout the match. Frillish gets access to Will-O-Wisp, which allows it to check both Staryu and Drilbur, the two most common spinners in LC. On top of all this, Frillish even has a fairly high Special Attack stat, so it can hit foes hard, even on the defensive set. However, Knock Off runs rampant in LC, which hinders Frillish's ability to check Pokemon with access to this move, especially Fighting-types. It competes for a team slot with other fast Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mienfoo, Choice Scarf Chinchou, and Fletchling, which are often preferred to Frillish.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs can be used on the Choice Scarf set, but the set lacks the Speed to be effective and generally should not be used. Dazzling Gleam is a good option for hitting Scraggy and other Dark-types that would otherwise cause a lot of trouble for Frillish. Psychic is an option for dealing with Skrelp and Croagunk, as Frillish's Water-type moves will actually heal it due to Dry Skin. However, Psychic won't provide a great deal of usefulness outside of that. Taunt can be used to prevent the foe from using status moves, but Frillish is a bit slow to use it effectively, and Taunt generally isn't as good of a choice as Will-O-Wisp or Recover, as they are much more useful. Toxic can be used on the defensive set to outstall Pokemon with recovery such as Porygon, but Will-O-Wisp will be better most of the time because of the Attack drop. Trick Room can be set up effectively by Frillish if your team needs or requires it, but there are generally better Pokemon to do so such as Porygon, Pumpkaboo, and Spritzee.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Normal-types</strong>: Porygon makes a great check to Frillish because it can Trace Water Absorb to be healed Frillish's Water-type moves and is already immune to Shadow Ball. Munchlax can also check and PP stall Frillish with its great special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Croagunk</strong>: Croagunk absorbs Water Spout and takes 43 percent from Shadow Ball at most while hitting Frillish with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Chinchou</strong>: Chinchou is bulky enough to not care too much about Shadow Ball or Energy Ball and can use any Electric-type attack to deal major damage to Frillish.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Ferroseed, Foongus, Cottonee, and Snivy resist Water Spout and can hit Frillish with their super effective STAB moves. Cottonee can also Taunt or Encore the defensive set and force out Frillish. However, all of them, barring Ferroseed, dislike Ice Beam. Pumpkaboo-S gets hurt by Shadow Ball too much, even if it is able to deal enough damage to check the Choice Scarf set.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf users can outspeed Frillish and attack it hard, which greatly weakens its Water Spout. Gastly, Pawniard, and Scraggy are all notable because they can OHKO Frillish with their STAB moves. In particular, Choice Scarf Magnemite can outspeed Frillish, KOing it before it can take Magnemite out.</p> <p><strong>Timburr</strong>: Timburr cannot be neutralized by Will-O-Wisp, as it is actually strengthened due to Guts, and it can deal big damage back with Knock Off. If it runs another ability instead of Guts, the burn will weaken it, but most run Guts, so this is of minimal importance.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: While Frillish has Scald or Water Spout, it has to outspeed and KO Dark-types because it will generally not survive a STAB Dark-type attack. Dark-types with Pursuit, such as Pawniard and Stunky, also give Frillish a great deal of trouble. However, most Dark-types do not enjoy being burned, so that is a plus for Frillish against them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With a Choice Scarf, Frillish outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame and can use a massively strong Water Spout to put a dent in foes. Shadow Ball is a safe option to use if you want to hit most Pokemon for neutral damage. It also provides good coverage by hitting Ghost-types such as Gastly and Psychic-types such as Slowpoke for super effective damage. Surf can be used as a back-up Water-type move over Shadow Ball if Frillish gets low on health and Water Spout is greatly weakened. Frillish doesn't mind losing Shadow Ball too much because it only hits most targets for neutral damage. Hydro Pump can also be used as a back-up move with greater power, but it has lower accuracy. Ice Beam hits the Grass-types that resist Water Spout, such as Cottonee and Foongus. Energy Ball hits the Water-types that resist Water Spout, such as Chinchou and Staryu. Giga Drain does the same thing, but it can heal Frillish in return for slightly less power. Power is really important on this set because Frillish doesn't want to be missing KOs, but the healing does mitigate this somewhat. Trick allows Frillish to cripple opposing walls that try to switch in by giving them a Choice Scarf and locking them into a useless move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Speed EVs allow Frillish to reach 14 Speed and outspeed the entire unboosted metagame with its Choice Scarf. 236 Special Attack EVs are used to maximize damage, with the remaining 76 EVs being tossed into HP. Water Absorb allows Frillish to switch into Water-type moves without taking damage, which can increase the power of Water Spout. Cursed Body can be a nice option in order not to be resisted completely by Porygon, which otherwise would get Water Absorb thanks to Trace and therefore would be immune to Water Spout.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Frillish can be used two ways. It can be sent in early-on for revenge killing and breaking down the opponent, or it can be saved until the end-game and clean up the opponent's team after its counters have been weakened or KOed. Either way you decide to play it, you need to watch out for entry hazards. If you know your opponent has an entry hazard setter, try to use Frillish before their entry hazard setter sets up so that its Water Spout isn't weakened. If you have a way to remove them, do it preferably quickly, then Frillish can be saved for later in the match instead.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Even with Energy Ball, Frillish has trouble denting bulky Water-types, especially Chinchou, so Pokemon that are immune to its Electric-type attacks such as Hippopotas are good partners for Frillish. While Frillish is unaffected by Fighting-type attacks, it is severely damaged by Knock Off, which most Fighting-type Pokemon also carry. Pokemon such as Trubbish and Fletchling are good partners for Frillish, as they can handle these Fighting-type threats. Frillish strongly dislikes entry hazards, as they slowly chip away at its health and weaken its strongest attack, Water Spout. Pokemon such as Drilbur and Vullaby are great teammates. However, Frillish enjoys having the entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field so it is easier to KO the foe without having to take a hit back. Ferroseed can set up hazards for Frillish's team.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Frillish's main STAB attack and is useful for checking Pokemon such as Mienfoo while also nailing Fire-types that might be switching into a predicted Will-O-Wisp, with the added bonus of potentially burning the foe. Shadow ball provides good coverage, hitting Pokemon that resist Scald such as Slowpoke hard. Hex can be used over Shadow Ball if your team utilizes status moves often, and Frillish itself can use Will-O-Wisp. Recover gives Frillish longevity to take multiple hits throughout a match. Will-O-Wisp supports the team by halving the foe's Attack while slowly chipping away at their health. It also allows Frillish to beat Pokemon that cannot break Frillish with Knock Off such as Mienfoo.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread given and a Bold nature maximize bulk with even numbers for Eviolite. With a Bold nature, Frillish reaches 21 Defense and 24 Special Defense after the Eviolite boost. The rest are invested in Special Attack to increase damage output. Cursed Body is generally the best ability for Frillish. Most Pokemon only have one move that is able to 2HKO Frillish, so if it gets disabled Frillish can stay in and be able to potentially beat the Pokemon it is checking. Water Absorb is an acceptable ability as well, as it gives an immunity to Water-type moves and it provides Frillish with a form of healing. This allows Frillish to switch into predicted Water-type attacks and be able to take an extra hit. However, most Pokemon with Water-type moves, such as Chinchou, Carvanha, and Shell Smash Tirtouga, can hit Frillish extremely hard, and it can be difficult to stay in on them.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Frillish is best used as a check for certain Fire- and Normal-types, such as Aipom, Larvesta, Ponyta, and even Choice-locked Fighting-types, as it can burn them to weaken them or hit them with super effective moves. It also works alright as a check to other physical attackers as well. However, you must be careful with Fighting-types because they almost always carry Knock Off. As a result, it is usually best to use Frillish as a check to most Pokemon as opposed to a counter, as it has trouble switching in on predicted attacks, but has no trouble forcing Pokemon out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Frillish can barely dent Pokemon such as Chinchou on the switch, so any Pokemon immune to Volt Switch such as Drilbur would make a good teammate for Frillish. While Frillish can absorb Fighting-type attacks, it cannot effectively take a Knock Off from the Fighting-types that carry it. With this in mind, Pokemon that don't mind taking a Knock Off and losing their item such as Mienfoo, Trubbish, and Fletchling are good teammates for Frillish. Frillish has no way to handle Dark-types, so a Fighting-type teammate that can handle them such as Timburr is much-appreciated. Entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed and Trubbish really appreciate Frillish as a teammate because it is one of the best spinblockers in Little Cup.</p>"

  "Joltik": {
    "overview": "<p>Joltik is a bit of a mixed bag; on one hand, it has a good STAB move combination, only two weaknesses, and access to a speedy Volt Switch. On the other hand, it finds itself outclassed as an Electric-type by Chinchou and Magnemite. It does have a few redeeming qualities, however, such as its resistance to Fighting-type attacks, neutrality to Ground-type attacks, and ability to punish Chinchou with Giga Drain. No other Electric-type in Little Cup shares this unique combination of traits, which gives Joltik a small niche in Little Cup.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fighting can be used to KO Pawniard, a Pokemon that Joltik otherwise has trouble dealing with. Hidden Power Ground is an option to OHKO Magnemite if its Sturdy has been broken, while still dealing respectable damage to Chinchou. Joltik can run an Agility set with Life Orb, but its overall frailty and susceptibility to priority prevents it from being a consistent sweeper. A bulky set with Eviolite or Berry Juice with support options like Thunder Wave is feasible, but Joltik is better suited to an offensive role. Energy Ball can be used over Giga Drain, but Giga Drain's healing effect is much more useful than a slight increase in damage output, especially because Energy Ball doesn't gain any notable OHKOs that Giga Drain would otherwise miss. Charge Beam is a method of boosting Joltik's Special Attack, but is unreliable. Joltik has access to Sucker Punch for priority, allowing it to OHKO Gastly, but lack of STAB on Sucker Punch and Joltik's low Attack stat means it won't be doing any significant damage. Joltik gets many physical options, such as Wild Charge, X-Scissor, and Poison Jab, but again, Joltik's Attack stat is too low to effectively pull off a physical or mixed set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Munchlax</strong>: Munchlax stands out as the best counter to Joltik, as it can sponge any attack Joltik throws at it and can deal heavy damage with Body Slam or OHKO it with Fire Punch.</p> <p><strong>Magnemite</strong>: Magnemite resists all moves commonly carried by Joltik and can wall it with Recycle and Berry Juice.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta can easily switch in on Bug Buzz and Giga Drain and threaten Joltik with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon can switch into Joltik with ease, especially because Joltik isn't overwhelmingly powerful.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Joltik struggles against strong priority users such as Pawniard, which can take away around 80% of its health with a Sucker Punch. Fletchling can revenge kill Joltik with Acrobatics and a bit of prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Sturdy + Berry Juice</strong>: If there are no entry hazards on the field, Tirtouga and Dwebble can come in and render Joltik setup fodder. Dwebble is particularly good at this, as Rock Blast can beat the Substitute + 3 Attacks set with ease.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is Joltik's strongest Electric-type STAB move and is a good tool to use for revenge killing. Bug Buzz is an equally powerful secondary STAB move that hits Grass-types and through Substitute. Volt Switch allows Joltik to scout early- and mid-game. Finally, Giga Drain provides important coverage against opposing Ground-types and Chinchou, which could otherwise switch into Joltik with ease.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread maximizes Special Attack and Speed. As Joltik is already very fast with Choice Scarf, a Modest nature is preferred to maximize its damage output; however, a Timid nature can be used to ensure you outspeed threats such as +2 Jolly Tirtouga and Jolly Choice Scarf Pawniard. The chosen ability is Swarm, as Joltik lacks moves that can take advantage of Compound Eyes, and Unnerve is almost completely useless, as it doesn't prevent Berry Juice consumption. Swarm, while situational, is the best option, as it can power up Bug Buzz when Joltik is significantly weakened.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be careful when scouting with Joltik. Don't click Volt Switch right away if your opponent still has Chinchou or a Ground-type, as this could potentially lose a lot of momentum for your team. Instead, consider using Giga Drain or a tactful double switch. As a Choice Scarf user, Joltik can be used to scout early-game, then brought in for revenge killing throughout the game. It can switch into resisted hits if needed, but you must be wary of what Joltik is switching into, as strong neutral hits can KO it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Joltik works best in a VoltTurn core to keep momentum flowing and the opponent at a disadvantage. Mienfoo makes for a great partner thanks to its resistance to Rock and ability to hit special walls on their weaker physical side. Mienfoo is able to heavily damage Magnemite and Munchlax, two Pokemon that wall Joltik. Having an entry hazard remover is critical because Joltik is weak to Stealth Rock and switches in and out a lot. Archen can also form a VoltTurn core with Joltik and keep entry hazards away with Defog, but one must keep in mind that the two Pokemon share a weakness to Rock. Several Rapid Spin users pair very nicely with Joltik. Staryu can take on Fire-, Rock-, and Ground-types with ease, while Joltik resists Staryu's weaknesses to Electric- and Grass-types. Drilbur and Tentacool also pair well with Joltik due to their abilities to take on Fire- and Rock-types. Finally, teammates that can set up entry hazards are useful, as this takes advantage of the switches Joltik forces and can net it KOs that it would otherwise miss.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute can ease prediction and allows Joltik to scout powerful attacks and shield itself from status. Thunderbolt and Bug Buzz are Joltik's strongest STAB moves and are quite powerful when backed by Life Orb. Bug Buzz allows Joltik to hit Grass-types hard, and Giga Drain allows Joltik to hit Ground-types and Chinchou for a lot of damage while recovering health lost from Substitute and Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread maximizes Joltik's Special Attack and Speed, with the remaining EVs put into HP. A Timid nature is preferred, as it allows Joltik to hit 17 Speed and outspeed the common Pokemon with 16 Speed. Life Orb provides Joltik with more power than Choice Scarf, but Berry Juice is a decent alternative because it gives Joltik more longevity and works well alongside Substitute.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Joltik can use its decent Speed to scout the foe's moves with Substitute and then proceed to hit the foe hard with Thunderbolt or Bug Buzz. If the opponent switches in a Pokemon meant to absorb an Electric-type move, such as Chinchou, it'll get smacked by Giga Drain and Joltik will regain the HP it lost from setting up the Substitute. Substitute can also be used to dodge Sucker Punch from Sucker Punch users such as Pawniard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Damage piles up quickly on Joltik due to its vulnerability to Stealth Rock, Life Orb recoil, and use of Substitute, so teammates that can remove hazards with Rapid Spin or Defog, such as Staryu, Archen, and Drilbur, help immensely. As a special attacker, Joltik struggles getting past special walls, so teammates with high Attack and access to Knock Off, such as Pawniard, Timburr, and Mienfoo, can help wear them down. Finally, a teammate that can set up Stealth Rock or Spikes is useful for taking advantage of the opponent's switching and can net Joltik some extra KOs.</p>"

Elgyem also sports solid 55 / 55 / 55 defenses and access to reliable recovery, which gives it good longevity with Eviolite. Its main flaw lies in its defensive typing; it doesn't have many opportunities to switch in due to it only having two resistances, and it has unfortunate weaknesses to the moves Knock Off, Pursuit, and U-turn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psyshock is an option over Psychic to hit Pokemon with lower physical bulk, but Psychic is usually the superior choice. Hidden Power Fire can be used to OHKO Ferroseed as it switches in. Calm Mind can be used to boost Elgyem's Special Attack and Special Defense to attempt a sweep, but this is arguably done better by Spritzee due to its higher bulk and better typing. Dark Pulse or Shadow Ball can be used for better coverage versus Pumpkaboo-XL and Honedge, but aren't too useful otherwise. Elgyem is certainly slow enough to act as a Trick Room setter or sweeper, but this is counterproductive with Analytic, and there are bulkier and more powerful Pokemon to make use of the move, such as Porygon, Spritzee, Slowpoke, and Solosis. Toxic can be used to wear down opposing walls. Elgyem can provide dual screens support, giving a teammate an easier time setting up. Elgyem has a few other boosting options up its sleeve, such as Nasty Plot, Barrier, and Cosmic Power. Magic Coat is an option to bounce back entry hazards among other effects. Trick can be utilized alongside Choice Specs to hit incredibly hard and potentially cripple a wall with a Choice item. Synchronize is an option over Analytic to punish opposing status users, but Analytic is a much better ability overall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Pawniard, Houndour, and Stunky heavily threaten Elgyem with their STAB moves and can trap it with Pursuit. Stunky is a particularly good answer to Elgyem, as it is only hit neutrally by Hidden Power Fighting, unlike Pawniard and Houndour.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: While they won't enjoy switching into an Analytic-boosted Psychic, Ghost-types such as Gastly can KO Elgyem with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off Users</strong>: Elgyem is severely crippled by Knock Off because it is weak to Dark and loses its Eviolite if hit by the move, which it needs to best perform its role as a bulky attacker.</p> <p><strong>U-turn Users</strong>: U-turn users such as Larvesta, Mienfoo, and Fletchling can hit Elgyem super effectively and switch out to a partner better equipped to handle Elgyem.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as RestTalk Munchlax and Heal Bell Lickitung can sponge any of Elgyem's attacks and aren't particularly bothered by Thunder Wave. However, they will lose if Elgyem is carrying Calm Mind.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is Elgyem's most powerful STAB move, heavily damaging any faster targets that don't resist it and easily OHKOing the many bulky Fighting-types of the metagame. Recover keeps Elgyem healthy, as it will almost certainly be taking hits before it moves. Hidden Power Fighting smacks Dark-types that may try to switch into Psychic such as Pawniard, Scraggy, and Houndour. Thunderbolt hits Flying- and Water-types, such as Archen, Vullaby, and Slowpoke hard. Energy Ball can be used for better coverage versus Ground-types such as Drilbur and Hippopotas, as well as OHKOing Berry Juice Chinchou and Eviolite Tirtouga after Stealth Rock damage. Thunder Wave is another option which cripples opposing setup sweepers and faster Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread and nature let Elgyem hit 14 in each defensive stat with the rest put into Special Attack to increase its damage output while accounting for Hidden Power Fighting's IV drop. Eviolite boosts Elgyem's bulk; it won't need Berry Juice, as it has access to reliable recovery. Analytic pairs nicely with Elgyem's low Speed, giving it added power versus both faster foes and foes that switch into its attacks. An alternate spread of 76 HP / 160 Def / 80 SpA / 160 SpD allows Elgyem to heal more HP with Recover but comes at the cost of some power. Lowering Elgyem's Speed IVs and using a Quiet nature is an option to underspeed more Pokemon to further take advantage of Analytic. However, Elgyem does enjoy being faster than certain Pokemon, such as defensive Tirtouga and Foongus, so that it can hit them with Energy Ball and Psychic, respectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Recover should be used well in advance due to Elgyem's low Speed, ensuring it can keep tanking hits and attacking. Otherwise, it risks being revenge killed by a faster Pokemon. While Elgyem packs a useful resistance to Fighting-type moves, keep in mind that it is weak to Knock Off, a common coverage move for most Fighting-types, as well as Mienfoo's U-turn. If your opponent has a Dark-type such as Pawniard or Houndour, Hidden Power Fighting can be used to hit them hard on a predicted switch-in. If using Thunder Wave, keep in mind that while it's useful for crippling certain setup sweepers, this will likely cause Elgyem to lose out on an Analytic boost the next turn due to the foe becoming much slower.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Pancham can break through bulky Steel- and Normal-types that Elgyem can't beat, defeat the Dark-types that threaten it, and provide helpful Knock Off support. Dark-types such as Vullaby and Houndour can help deal with Ghost-types such as Gastly for Elgyem. As Elgyem is weak to Dark, a Knock Off absorber such as Trubbish or Mienfoo is useful to tank Knock Offs aimed at Elgyem.</p>"

However, Litwick is significantly hampered by its poor defensive typing, which leaves it quite vulnerable to Pokemon it can't OHKO. In addition, it's weak to Stealth Rock and susceptible to all entry hazards, further exacerbating its frailty. These factors, coupled with its low Speed, make it a poor choice outside of Trick Room teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple Pawniard and Stunky, which could otherwise revenge kill Litwick with Sucker Punch. It can also cripple physical attackers that Litwick can't KO, such as Munchlax. Substitute is an option to let Litwick play around Sucker Punch. Flamethrower is a more accurate option over Fire Blast, but Litwick generally needs all the power it can get. Psychic can be used to deal slightly more damage to Fighting-types. Trick can be utilized alongside Choice Specs to potentially cripple a wall. Litwick could run Eviolite or Berry Juice to increase its longevity, but it'll miss out on the power Life Orb provides. Litwick gets plenty of support options, such as Taunt, Toxic, Haze, Pain Split, and Clear Smog, but its terrible defensive typing means it should stick to offensive sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Munchlax</strong>: Munchlax resists Fire Blast thanks to Thick Fat, is immune to Shadow Ball, and has plenty of bulk to tank an Energy Ball. Munchlax threatens to retaliate with Earthquake and Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: Porygon is immune to Shadow Ball and is also immune to Fire Blast if it traces Flash Fire. It can heal off any damage done with Recover and eventually wear Litwick down.</p> <p><strong>Houndour</strong>: Houndour can come in on anything except Hidden Power Ground and trap Litwick with Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Aqua Jet users such as Carvanha and Corphish can easily revenge kill Litwick. Sucker Punch users like Pawniard and Stunky can also revenge kill Litwick, only fearing the rare Will-O-Wisp and Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with high special bulk, such as Lickitung and Mantyke, can tank hits from Litwick and stall out Trick Room turns, eventually wearing it down enough to KO it.</p>",

      "Trick Room Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is the most powerful move on the set when backed by STAB and Life Orb. Shadow Ball gives Litwick good coverage alongside Fire Blast and is boosted by STAB. Trick Room can be set up on Pokemon that don't threaten Litwick, such as Ferroseed. Energy Ball rounds out Litwick's coverage, hitting the Water- and Rock-types that resist Fire Blast for super effective damage. Hidden Power Ground is an option to hit Houndour on the switch while still doing reasonable damage to Chinchou. Memento allows Litwick to heavily cripple something if it's about to go down or Trick Room is about to end, allowing another Trick Room setter or a setup sweeper to come in and set up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Litwick's Special Attack is maximized so that it hits as hard as possible. The rest of the EVs give Litwick some bulk. 0 Speed IVs and a Quiet nature minimize Litwick's Speed, which is ideal for a Trick Room sweeper. If using Hidden Power Ground, the IV spread must be changed to 31 / 31 / 31 / 30 / 30 / 1 and the EV spread to 116 HP / 76 Def / 240 SpA to account for the drop in IVs. Life Orb gives Litwick's moves much-needed power. Flash Fire gives Litwick more switch-in opportunities and powers up its Fire Blast when it's hit by a Fire-type move. Infiltrator can also be used to hit through Substitute and ensure Litwick isn't walled by Trace Porygon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Litwick should generally only set up Trick Room on Pokemon that don't threaten it, such as Ferroseed and Spritzee. Use Fire Blast against anything that doesn't resist it. However, be careful if you see a potential Flash Fire user on the opposing team. Be cautious of opposing Sucker Punch users, as it still has priority in Trick Room and can hit Litwick for massive damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Litwick goes well with bulky teammates that can set up Trick Room, such as Porygon, Slowpoke, and Spritzee. Teammates that can set up entry hazards help Litwick get KOs it otherwise wouldn't. Ferroseed makes a particularly good partner, as it covers many of Litwick's weaknesses and can bait Fire-type attacks that Litwick can take advantage of. Since Litwick is weak to Stealth Rock and vulnerable to all hazards, Rapid Spin or Defog support from the likes of Drilbur, Vullaby, and Archen is appreciated. Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo pair well with Litwick since they can break through many of Litwick's checks and counters, such as Houndour, Munchlax, Pawniard, and Porygon. Finally, trappers such as Trapinch and Diglett are good teammates, as they can trap and beat Pokemon such as Ponyta and Houndour for Litwick. Trapinch functions better under Trick Room, while Diglett works well without Trick Room.</p>"

  "Axew": {
    "overview": "<p>Like all Dragon-types, Axew has suffered from the introduction of the Fairy-type this generation. Fairy-types are now another obstacle that the once mighty Dragon-types will have to deal with, but that does not mean they are no longer viable. With a great Attack, decent Speed, and access to Dragon Dance, Axew has all the necessary tools needed to sweep through teams.</p> <p>Despite this, Axew does have some notable downsides. First, our little dragon suffers from subpar defenses, even with the Eviolite boost. Second, unlike its older brother Haxorus, Axew does not have access to Earthquake to reliably take down Steel-types, another obstacle in the life of a Dragon-type. With all advantages and disadvantages taken into account, Axew is still a fearsome threat when given the chance to set up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb can be used to add some extra power, but this makes Axew easier to be taken down since the Eviolite bulk is quite important. Substitute is also an option to avoid Will-O-Wisp, Spore, and Sucker Punch. All of these hinder sweeping potential, so preventing them from happening can be useful. Lastly, Axew has the option of utilizing Dual Chop with Choice Scarf to break opposing Substitutes and Focus Sashes.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types are immune to Axew's STAB Dragon-type moves and can survive an unboosted Poison Jab, sometimes even Iron Tail. Snubbull even carries Intimidate to weaken Axew. Most Fairy-type STAB attacks will OHKO Axew as well.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types resist Axew's STAB Dragon-type moves and are really only wary of Superpower. A Pokemon like Honedge is also immune to Superpower, rendering Axew useless against it. Also, since dealing with Steel-types requires the use of Superpower, Axew will be weakened afterwards due to its Attack and Defense drops.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves</strong>: Since many Pokemon with Ice-type moves are not necessarily Ice-type, Axew cannot simply use Superpower. Bulky Water-types like Chinchou can be problematic with Ice Beam, and Protean Froakie is another example of a non Ice-type getting an Ice-type move.</p> <p><strong>Faster Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Since Axew does miss out on extra bulk on the Choice set, faster Choice Scarf users do pose a threat to Axew and can usually take it out with ease.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Axew does have to watch for Prankster status moves so it will not be crippled, and it also takes good damage from strong Sucker Punch users, so they can be problematic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>As this set's main selling point is Dragon Dance, it will obviously take the first move slot. After a boost or two, Axew becomes a strong sweeper that can be hard to take down. Outrage is the ideal powerful Dragon-type STAB; even when unboosted, the damage output is quite strong. The downside to Outrage would be the confusion afterwards. Due to this, Dragon Claw becomes a feasible alternative as it has no drawbacks. Although Axew does not have Earthquake to deal with all Steel-types, it does have a way to get rid of troublesome Fairy-types thanks to Poison Jab and Iron Tail. If Cottonee has been problematic, run Poison Jab as it will be a clean OHKO. Otherwise, stick with Iron Tail for dealing with other Fairy-types. The last slot must be saved for Superpower as it functions as a reliable way to deal with many Steel-types that would otherwise wall Axew.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Due to Axew's mediocre defenses, Eviolite is pretty much a necessity in order to increase its bulk as well as the possibility of a sweep. The EV spread speaks for itself here as it is quite standard for a sweeper of this sort. Maximum Speed and Attack will allow Axew to make the most out of its power, and after a Dragon Dance, this power will just be further increased. While the Adamant nature gives Axew some added power and lets it reach 22 Speed at +1, it will make Axew vulnerable to some crucial threats that a +1 Jolly Axew would be able to outspeed, namely Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Chinchou, Mienfoo, and Magnemite.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As a setup sweeper, Axew is usually saved until later in the match or at least until its checks and counters are out of the way. Also, be wary when using Superpower, as using it too early can stop the chances of sweeping due to the Attack and Defense drops. Do not get greedy when setting up; Dragon Dance should only be used when there is an extremely high chance Axew will be able to survive a hit, or as a last resort attempt. If a risky choice is made and it goes in favor of the opponent, it could cost the win. In addition, you do not want Axew to be locked into Outrage when there is a Steel-type on the other team as it wastes turns and will end up confusing Axew anyway without much damage being done. On the other hand, Fairy-types will just block Outrage, allowing Axew to use Poison Jab after Outrage is nullified.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Axew's lack of bulk, bulky teammates that are able to sponge super effective hits for Axew are recommended. A few examples of these Pokemon are Chinchou to take Ice-type moves and Trubbish to take Fairy-type moves. Axew also benefits from having teammates that can take care of these checks and counters. Drilbur is a good example of a Pokemon that can take care of these by being able to defeat Steel-types with Earthquake and Fairy-types with Poison Jab. As with all sweepers, Axew benefits from having teammates with Knock Off. This will make Axew's job easier when it comes to sweeping as Eviolite will be out of the way. Another thing that Axew benefits from is having entry hazards out. This will mean that Axew needs to deal less damage in order to secure a KO and will increase the possibility of a sweep.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set is identical to the last except that Dragon Claw is in the first slot. Dragon Claw is more of a necessity on this set as opposed to an option because Axew, by virtue of holding a choice item, will be locked into Outrage even after the first round. Dragon Claw is spammable on a Choice set without the confusion drawback that Outrage comes with. Outrage does still get its own slot, however, as it is more powerful and can secure a late-game sweep. Superpower is once again used as a coverage move to hit Steel- and Ice-types super effectively, while Iron Tail and Poison Jab are the coverage move for Fairy-types. The warning does still exist for Superpower, though, as using it too early could cost you and ruin the sweep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Scarf will make Axew a fast sweeper and revenge killer, while a Choice Band will give Axew some more power. Generally, Choice Scarf is the better option for Axew as it can outspeed other Choice Scarf threats and OHKO them. Some of these include Snover and Amaura, but be careful of priority Ice Shard. The same spread from the last set applies to this set. A Jolly nature will give Axew the chance to outspeed certain Pokemon. For example, Jolly Choice Scarf Axew can outspeed +1 Tirtuoga and OHKOes the standard Shell Smash set when at -1 Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>A lot from the last set applies to this one. Firstly, Axew functions better when its checks and counters are out of the picture. Secondly, using Superpower too early can prevent a sweep from happening, and the same goes for Outrage, thus the option of Dragon Claw early on. Remember, Choice Scarf Axew will outspeed Pokemon that it normally would not, so pay attention to what it can and cannot outspeed if using Choice Scarf. Lastly, when the end-game comes around, go for that win with Outrage!</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Once again, many of the same concepts from the Dragon Dance set can be used here since they are both sweeper-oriented sets. As with all sweepers, Pokemon that clear threats or obstacles that could stop a sweep need to be taken care of. In Axew's case, Drilbur can deal with Steel-types, and Pawniard can take care of Fairy-types as well as Ice-types. Since this set will be switching more often than the Dragon Dance set, Rapid Spin users are more useful here as Axew can be worn down from just switching in and out. In addition, having hazards on the opponent's side of the field makes sweeping and cleaning up easier. Once again, teammates with Knock Off make life easier for Axew since Berry Juice and Eviolite will be out of the way.</p>"

  "Shelmet": {
    "overview": "<p>Shelmet is very bulky by Little Cup's standards, boasting impressive 50 / 85 / 65 defenses. This, along with its access to Recover, makes Shelmet a fantastic user of Spikes, as they will allow it to reliably set up several layers of the entry hazard. Although its typing leaves it weak to common Flying-, Fire-, and Rock-type moves, it has resistances to Fighting-, Grass-, and Ground-type moves which allow it to set up on many common Pokemon, particularly Foongus. In addition, due to its ability, Overcoat, Shelmet is immune to Spore. However, Shelmet's low Speed and limited offensive capabilities can lead to it becoming setup bait itself and being an easy target for opposing Taunt users. Shelmet is also outclassed by Ferroseed in many instances as an entry hazard setter, as Ferroseed has better defenses and can set up on Foongus more easily; however, Ferroseed lacks reliable recovery and cannot set up as easily on Fighting-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shelmet can run an effective Baton Pass set with Acid Armor, Substitute, or Curse; however, Shelmet is easy to Taunt and will have to take two attacks before being able to pass its boost. Baton Pass can also be used to preserve momentum or get a teammate in safely, as Shelmet's Speed means it will generally move second. As far as attacking options go, Bug Buzz hits harder than Infestation, but it doesn't trap the opponent or inflict passive damage. However, it hits through Substitute, preventing Shelmet from becoming setup bait. Energy Ball can be used to hit Pokemon such as Tirtouga and Chinchou, while Sludge Bomb can be used to hit Fairy-types; however, it's hard justifying giving a slot to those options over Infestation. Acid Armor could also be used on the usual set to prevent Fletchling and Bulk Up Timburr from gaining an advantage, although Shelmet will have to catch the former on the switch. Shell Armor can be useful for protecting Shelmet from critical hits, which can ruin a Baton Pass chain, but having an immunity to Spore and weather damage is generally preferred. Yawn is an effective option over Toxic to force switches, but this leaves Shelmet unable to take on nearly anything with any form of recovery. Encore can help versus Pokemon that would otherwise set up on Shelmet, but its low Speed prevents this strategy from being effective.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Fletchling, Taillow, Vullaby, and Archen are capable of dealing a lot of damage to Shelmet with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta take negligible damage from Infestation and can wipe Shelmet out with a Flare Blitz after just a little prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Most Rock-types are bulky enough to take little damage from any of Shelmet's attacks, and Pokemon such as Tirtouga, Archen, Dwebble, and Onix can all 2HKO Shelmet with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Mienfoo and Onix can leave Shelmet unable to set up Spikes or use Recover. Shelmet is quite slow and therefore susceptible to Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Although most Poison-types are easy setup bait for Shelmet, they are unaffected by Toxic, making them difficult to wear down.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes is an effective entry hazard, as it wears down the opposing team every time a Pokemon switches in, and Shelmet's bulk and access to Recover make it a particularly reliable user of the move. Infestation is a weak attack, but it traps the opponent and deals passive damage, allowing Shelmet to set up on Pokemon that can't do anything to it, such as Foongus and Spritzee. Toxic is another way for Shelmet to inflict damage on top of Infestation. Although Toxic is generally considered less reliable than other forms of passive damage in Little Cup, the damage it and Infestation inflicts can add up very quickly. Toxic is also useful for crippling bulky switch-ins that try to remove entry hazards, such as Vullaby and Drilbur. Recover is the key to Shelmet's amazing bulk and longevity; it can stall many Pokemon out when combined with Toxic and Infestation.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The HP, Defense, and Special Defense EVs chosen give Shelmet 23 / 27 / 24 bulk, which is extremely bulky in Little Cup. Overcoat allows Shelmet to come in freely on Foongus, which it can proceed to trap and set up on.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Shelmet is best used as a switch-in to Fighting-types and Pokemon such as Foongus. From there, it can proceed to set up Spikes. However, Pokemon like Bulk Up Timburr can set up quite easily on Shelmet. Shelmet's bulk along with Recover enables it to stall out opponents with a combination of Infestation and Toxic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chinchou and Tirtouga make for great partners, as they resist Flying-type attacks from Pokemon such as Fletchling and can come in on Fire-type attacks from the likes of Ponyta and Larvesta, all of which are massive threats to Shelmet. A spinblocker such as Pumpkaboo can help keep Shelmet's entry hazards up. Pawniard can discourage opposing Defoggers in addition to having good type synergy with Shelmet; it can beat the Flying- and Rock-types that trouble Shelmet, while Shelmet can take on the Fighting-types that beat Pawniard. Pokemon with U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Mienfoo and Magnemite, are great at forcing enemies out and causing them to take entry hazard damage. Shelmet works well on stall teams, as they benefit from entry hazard support; however, Ferroseed usually fits better on those teams.</p>"

Its unique typing grants it immunities to Electric-, Normal-, and Fighting-type moves. It can set Stealth Rock and block Rapid Spin at the same time, which is unique to it. There are a few downsides to using Golett, however. Despite a high HP stat, it has fairly low Defense and Special Defense stats. It is also very slow, which hinders its attacking abilities. It also has no physical Ghost-type STAB move, as Shadow Punch is illegal at level 5. Even though its unique typing grants Golett three immunities, it also unfortunately leaves Golett with several glaring weaknesses to Dark-, Ghost-, Water-, and Grass-type moves, which are pretty common.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Golett has a very wide movepool, but none of the moves it learns are as useful as the ones on its main set. It has access to several good special attacks, but it has a really bad Special Attack stat. Golett can learn Superpower, which is a heavy damage dealing move to hit Dark-types. Fire Punch can be used to hit Ferroseed, as well as other Grass-types, super effectively. Meanwhile, Thunder Punch can be used to hit Flying-types and Water-types. Golett can learn Thief, so a set with Berry Juice could be useful. Rock Polish can be used to raise Golett's Speed to high levels, boosting its attacking capabilities. Rock Tomb can be used to lower opponents' Speed and hit incoming switches. Similarly, Bulldoze can be used as a STAB option that lowers the opponent's' Speed, but it is generally worse than Earthquake.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Knock Off is super effective against Golett and removes its item, which could prove to be fatal. In general, Golett does not appreciate Dark-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: As Ghost-types hit Golett super effectively with their STAB moves and Golett has no means of retaliation, it will surely be taken down or forced out by the likes of Frillish, Gastly, and Pumpkaboo.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Chinchou, Slowpoke, and Staryu can all threaten Golett out with a Water-type STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Cottonee, Bellsprout, and Foongus pose threats to Golett with their offensive and defensive type advantages.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Hippopotas and Spritzee take minimal damage from Golett, can recover health back, and proceed to wear Golett down.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Golett has several good options with its great movepool. Drain Punch is a reliable source of damage and recovery that is boosted by Iron Fist. Earthquake provides a STAB move with a relatively high Base Power, hitting Rock-, Steel-, and Fire-types reliably. Stealth Rock is a useful move to have on any team. Finally, Ice Punch rounds off Golett's coverage by hitting Flying-, Grass-, Ground-, and Dragon-types, all while being boosted by Iron Fist.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Golett's EVs and nature aim to maximize its bulk and Attack. 164 Attack EVs allow it to always OHKO certain Pokemon, such as Pawniard. With 44 HP and 196 Defense EVs, Golett has better chances of surviving attacks from some of the bigger physical threats in the tier. It has a high chance of surviving a Knock Off from Choice Scarf Pawniard, and it can take two Earthquakes from Drilbur and 2HKO in return. To round off the EVs, 76 Speed is used to outspeed other 10 Speed Pokemon, such as Porygon. Eviolite increases both of Golett's defenses and dramatically increases its overall bulk. Iron Fist increases the power of Golett's coverage moves, Drain Punch and Ice Punch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When using Golett, there are a few things to keep in mind. Drain Punch is always the main move to use against most targets, as it provides good coverage, as well as recovery. When in doubt, Earthquake is Golett's largest source of damage. Always resort to that as a last option. If your team doesn't already have a Pokemon running Stealth Rock, run it; it's amazingly useful. Set up Stealth Rock against support Pokemon such as Spritzee or Pokemon that Golett can tank hits from, such as Fire- and Electric-types.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Several Pokemon complement Golett well. Normal-types are immune to Ghost-type moves, so Bunnelby makes a decent teammate. As Golett blocks Rapid Spin, the only other means of removing Stealth Rock is Defog, which Pawniard would love to have hit it, so together they form a great entry hazards removal blocking duo. Any Dark-types that can tank a Knock Off and deal with Ghost-types, including Houndour, Scraggy, and Vullaby, help out Golett with its weakness. Vullaby and Houndour can also beat Grass-types that can threaten Golett. Dark-types also threaten Slowpoke, which can be a problem for Golett. Grass-types such as Foongus and Bellsprout help beat Golett's weakness to Water-types. Pokemon that can deal with Fighting-types well, such as Snubbull, Spritzee, and Trubbish, can aid in beating them for Golett. Additionally, Spritzee provides Wish support for Golett, while Trubbish provides hazard support with Spikes. Lastly, Golett works very well on Sticky Web teams, so either Surskit or Spinarak would make a good team option.</p>"

It's no slouch defensively, either, thanks to its 70 / 50 / 50 defenses and access to reliable recovery in Roost. Furthermore, its access to Superpower lets it hit Steel- and Rock-types hard, something most Flying-types struggle with. While Rufflet does boast incredible power with Hustle, the ability's downside is 80% accuracy on its physical moves, which can be frustrating, especially if you're trying to gain momentum with U-turn. In addition, Rufflet faces competition from Fletchling, Archen, and Doduo as an offensive Flying-type, and Vullaby as a defensive Flying-type, but it's able to effectively stand out from the flock thanks to its large raw power, bulk, and access to good coverage moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rufflet can run a support set, but is outclassed by the bulkier Vullaby. Rock Slide and Steel Wing are coverage options that can be used to hit Archen, but are usually not worth the moveslot. Hone Claws could be used over Bulk Up if you really hate missing due to Hustle, but the Defense boosts are usually too good to pass up, and Rufflet's access to Aerial Ace somewhat mitigates its accuracy issue. As the only user of Sky Drop in LC, Rufflet can be a surprisingly effective staller with Sky Drop and Toxic Spikes support. Tailwind can be used to boost the Speed of Rufflet and its teammates, but Rufflet doesn't really have the available moveslots to be using it. Sheer Force can be used over Hustle if 80% accuracy really troubles you, but it's inferior to Hustle as the boost is smaller and only applies to specific moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Chinchou, Elekid, and Magnemite all threaten Rufflet with their STAB moves, although they'll need to be cautious switching into Rufflet's Hustle-boosted attacks.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Tirtouga, Onix, and Archen in can come in on Rufflet Choice-locked into Return or Aerial Ace and threaten Rufflet back with their STAB moves, or use it as setup bait. Archen in particular is only hit neutrally by Superpower, only fearing the rare Rock Slide or Steel Wing.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Pawniard can come in on Rufflet Choice-locked into Return or Aerial Ace.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bulk Up boosts Rufflet's Attack and Defense, making it quite the tank after a boost. Aerial Ace is an ideal STAB move, as it retains perfect accuracy with Hustle, unlike Rufflet's other physical moves. Superpower provides coverage against Steel-types such as Ferroseed, Pawniard, and Magnemite. Return can be used as a powerful STAB attack, hitting very hard with Hustle and Bulk Up boosts. However, it doesn't provide very good coverage alongside Aerial Ace, unlike Superpower. Roost gives Rufflet reliable recovery, allowing it to heal off damage it may take from Stealth Rock or while it sets up. Substitute allows Rufflet to avoid status, which could otherwise cripple it and hamper its sweeping ability.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This EV spread gives Rufflet good overall bulk and hits Eviolite numbers, giving it more setup opportunities. Hustle gives Rufflet 1.5x Attack at the cost of some accuracy, though Aerial Ace has perfect accuracy. The choice between Eviolite and Berry Juice depends on the move in the fourth slot. If using Roost, Eviolite should be used for the added bulk. If Substitute is used, Berry Juice is preferred so Rufflet has a form of recovery while it sets up. An alternate EV spread of 36 HP / 12 Atk / 36 Def / 196 SpD / 196 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used, trading some bulk for Speed and allowing it to outspeed would-be checks such as Chinchou.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rufflet should set up Bulk Up on Pokemon that can't 2HKO it, such as Spritzee, bulky Fighting-types, and various other walls. If running Substitute, set up Substitute on suspected status inducers like Ferroseed and use Bulk Up behind the Substitute. Once Rufflet obtains a boost or two, start attacking the foe with Rufflet's powerful Hustle-boosted attacks, healing off damage as needed. If Rufflet's checks are still healthy, be sure to keep Rufflet as healthy as possible with Roost or cleric support should it get forced out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Diglett is a great partner, as it can trap and remove Electric-, Steel-, and Rock-types, all of which threaten Rufflet. This is especially important if Rufflet isn't running Superpower. Cleric support from Pokemon such as Spritzee and Chinchou can rid Rufflet of status. Spritzee can also provide Rufflet with Wish support, and Chinchou provides a safe switch-in to Electric-types. Magnemite makes for a good partner, as it resists all of Rufflet's weaknesses, while Rufflet is immune to Ground attacks and can take on bulky Fighting-types for Magnemite. Because Rufflet is weak to Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin or Defog support helps ensure Rufflet enters the battle at full health and has more opportunities to set up with Bulk Up. Archen and Vullaby can be used for Defog support, while Drilbur and Staryu can be used for Rapid Spin support.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is a powerful STAB move, hitting anything that doesn't resist it very hard. Aerial Ace is the weaker STAB move, but has perfect accuracy and hits Fighting- and Grass-types super effectively. Superpower provides great coverage against the Steel- and Rock-types that resist Rufflet's STAB combination. U-turn allows Rufflet to dent a potential counter and switch out into a teammate and is useful for scouting in general.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With a Jolly nature and Choice Scarf, Rufflet hits 24 Speed, enough to outpace the entire unboosted metagame and several boosted threats, such as +1 Scraggy. The 1.5x Attack boost from Hustle along with 252 EVs in Attack lets Rufflet hit very hard. The leftover EVs give Rufflet a point in Defense so it can tank priority moves better. An alternate EV spread of 36 HP / 252 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SpD / 116 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used to increase Rufflet's damage output and bulk at the cost of some Speed. Rufflet hits 21 Speed with this spread, which is still enough to outpace the entire unboosted metagame. Do keep in mind that this spread can only switch into Stealth Rock three times, as opposed to the main spread, which can switch in four times.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rufflet can be used as needed for revenge killing, scouting, and potentially a late-game sweep if its checks and counters are removed. While Superpower is indeed useful for hitting Rock- and Steel-types, it has the nasty side effect of leaving Rufflet with -1 Attack and Defense afterward, which loses a lot of momentum for your team and can render Rufflet setup bait. If your opponent has a Ghost-type, such as Gastly, locking Rufflet into Superpower is not a good idea. When in doubt, especially early-game, use U-turn. Hustle coupled with Rufflet's high Attack means that its U-turns do a good chunk of damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rufflet is weak to Stealth Rock and will be doing a good bit of switching in and out, so Rapid Spin or Defog support is appreciated. Archen and Vullaby are good Defog users, while Drilbur and Staryu are good Rapid Spin users. Knock Off support from the likes of Pawniard or Mienfoo allows Rufflet a better shot at sweeping late-game. Hazard setters such as Onix or Dwebble can ensure Rufflet gets certain KOs, such as the OHKO on Mienfoo. Diglett is a very useful partner, removing Electric-, Steel-, and Rock-types, all of which threaten Rufflet. This gives Rufflet a much better shot at sweeping late-game. Drilbur also has good offensive synergy with Rufflet, threatening Electric-, Steel-, and Rock-types with Earthquake. With a Choice Scarf and U-turn, Rufflet works well in a VoltTurn team, so it can pair with Volt Switch users such as Chinchou and Magnemite or other U-turn users such as Mienfoo. Rufflet can also be paired up with other birds such as Fletchling and Doduo to form a Flying-type, or \"birdspam,\" core. They'll can wear down each other's checks through sheer offensive pressure, allowing one of them to eventually sweep.</p>"

It also has a decent Attack stat, but a poor Speed stat, which forces it to run a Choice Scarf. The only reason to use Deino is Hustle, but it is quite unreliable. With its small niche in Little Cup, Deino just barely manages to be useful on teams as a revenge killer and a late-game cleaner.</p>",

A bulky Eviolite set can be used with Thunder Wave and Dragon Tail, but other Eviolite users such as Lickitung generally work better. Lastly, a Rest and Sleep Talk set with Dragon Tail can be used, but isn't recommended.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Snubbull, Cottonee, and Spritzee can all take a hit and KO with either Play Rough, Dazzling Gleam, or Moonblast, respectively. They can all come in on a Choice-locked Outrage and finish Deino off.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Mienfoo, Timburr, and Scraggy are all really good Pokemon that deal with Deino.

They can also recover any health they lost in the process with their recovery moves.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Deino is especially weak to status, as burns halve its Attack, paralysis slows it down, and poison whittles its health down and limits its switch-ins.</p>",

    "overview": "<p>Fennekin has an interesting niche with its ability Magician, which allows it to steal items from foes when it attacks. It can take advantage of this ability by utilizing Power Herb in conjunction with Solar Beam, which essentially gives it a 120 Base Power Grass-type move that steals the foe's item and doesn't need a charge turn. Typical answers to Fire-types hate switching into Fennekin, as not only is Solar Beam super effective on all three types that have an offensive advantage against Fire, but they also have their item taken in the process. However, outside of Magician, Fennekin doesn't have much to differentiate itself from other Fire-types. For instance, it's quite outclassed by SunnyBeam Ponyta, even if Ponyta can't steal items, and other Fire-types such as Vulpix and Larvesta, which have more raw power, reliable recovery, and can provide better team support than Fennekin can.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hypnosis is an option to put the opposing Pokemon to sleep, but its low accuracy makes it unreliable. Magic Coat is an interesting option, allowing Fennekin to bounce back entry hazards and other status effects. Fennekin can opt to run the more accurate Flamethrower over Fire Blast, but Fennekin is already rather weak and needs all the power it can get. Psyshock is an option over Psychic, but Psychic is usually better because most of the metagame's Fighting-types have lower Special Defense. Finally, Fennekin could potentially run a boosting item such as Life Orb, but using any set that doesn't take advantage of Magician leaves it thoroughly outclassed by the likes of Ponyta, Vulpix, and several other Fire-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Shellos</strong>: Shellos is Fennekin's biggest counter, as it can tank a Solar Beam from Fennekin and can't have its item removed due to Sticky Hold. Shellos can heal off the damage with Recover and take Fennekin down with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Pokemon such as Porygon can wear Fennekin down slowly, even though they dislike losing their item. Porygon in particular can steal its Eviolite back from Fennekin thanks to Trace.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fennekin can't do much to opposing Fire-types besides steal their item, and it is eventually worn down due to its lack of reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Though they are heavily damaged and lose their item if they switch directly into Solar Beam, Water-types such as Staryu can easily threaten Fennekin out with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: They won't enjoy switching into Solar Beam or losing their item, but otherwise, Rock-types such as Archen check Fennekin quite easily with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon in general such as Drilbur, Abra, and Gastly can revenge kill Fennekin due to its middling Speed and bulk.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Powerful priority users such as Fletchling can revenge kill Fennekin, but generally won't want to switch directly into its moves.</p>",

      "Magician": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is the strongest move on the set and is Fennekin's best option for a STAB move. Solar Beam coupled with Power Herb is what gives Fennekin a niche; it can hit foes hard with a one-turn Solar Beam while simultaneously stealing their item with Magician. It easily OHKOes Omanyte and can OHKO Tirtouga if Sturdy has been broken. Psychic hits Fighting-types harder than Fennekin's other moves, 2HKOing bulky Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo while also having a chance to OHKO itemless Mienfoo. It also hits Trubbish for massive damage, and Fennekin won't be able to steal its item anyway due to Sticky Hold. Hidden Power Ground ensures Fennekin isn't entirely useless versus Houndour and other Fire-types, and it provides Fennekin with a way of hitting Chinchou after Power Herb is used up. Will-O-Wisp allows Fennekin to cripple tanky physical attackers such as Munchlax and Mienfoo.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread coupled with a Timid nature lets Fennekin hit 16 Speed. 184 EVs are then invested into Special Attack, with the remaining EVs put into Defense. Power Herb allows Fennekin to use Solar Beam without requiring a turn to charge. The ability, Magician, is what prevents Fennekin from being entirely outclassed by other Fire-types, as it allows Fennekin to steal the foe's item upon using Solar Beam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Fennekin is most threatening when its Power Herb is still intact, and it is quite difficult to switch into because it has a nearly guaranteed item theft with Magician and Solar Beam. Take advantage of this to steal useful items such as Berry Juice and Eviolite from opposing Pokemon. Stealing consumable items such as Berry Juice is optimal for Fennekin, as it can use the item for itself and continue to steal more items. Remember that Fennekin isn't very bulky without Eviolite and isn't very powerful without a boosting item like Life Orb, so use Solar Beam as soon as possible to obtain a useful item. Also keep in mind that Fennekin shouldn't be switched into non-resisted hits due to its middling bulk; it should be brought in after a teammate has fainted or via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fennekin will likely be forced out by Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types after it has used up Solar Beam, so a bulky Grass-type such as Foongus or Ferroseed makes for a good teammate to handle these Pokemon for Fennekin. Entry hazard setters are important teammates for Fennekin, as entry hazards ensure Fennekin can OHKO Pokemon with Sturdy such as Tirtouga and Onix. Ferroseed, Tirtouga, and Dwebble are good examples of Pokemon that can set entry hazards. Given that Fennekin is weak to Stealth Rock and vulnerable to all entry hazards, Rapid Spin support from the likes of Drilbur and Staryu is appreciated. Rapid Spin is preferred over Defog, as Fennekin prefers having entry hazards on the opponent's side. Vulpix can provide sun support to power up Fennekin's Fire Blast while also allowing it to use Solar Beam without Power Herb. However, they don't have good defensive synergy with each other. Finally, considering that Fennekin softens the opposition by removing items like Eviolite and Berry Juice, setup sweepers that can take advantage of this such as Fletchling and Scraggy make for good teammates.</p>"

  "Froakie": {
    "overview": "<p>Froakie's niche lies in its ability, Protean, which changes Froakie's type to match that of the move it is using. While this in itself may not seem interesting, it also provides Froakie with a STAB boost on every single attack it uses. Coupled with a usable base 62 Special Attack stat and Life Orb, Froakie hits fairly hard. To take advantage of this, Froakie has a wide array of both physical and special attacks that let it hit most targets for fairly good damage. Froakie's good Speed stat lets it hit 17 Speed, allowing it to outspeed a good portion of the metagame. However, Froakie's poor defenses force it to rely on OHKOing foes before taking any damage, which makes it very susceptible to priority, namely Fletchling's Acrobatics. Furthermore, Froakie's Speed stat, while good, still leaves it outsped by common threats such as Diglett and Gastly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Froakie doesn't have many other notable options, it has some that can be used to a good extent. Toxic is a move that stands out, as it allows Froakie to cripple walls, such as Spritzee. Froakie has a wide physical movepool that include Rock Slide and Waterfall, but these moves have significantly lower Base Power than any special move Froakie uses and because of this, these moves are generally outclassed. Froakie has access to the combination of Toxic Spikes and Taunt, which lets it force out opposing leads and get a free layer of Toxic Spikes. However, Froakie will miss out on coverage, and its frailness makes it even riskier to use these moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Most faster threats, such as Ponyta and Taillow, can easily outspeed Froakie and hit it hard.</p> <p><strong>Heavy Hitters</strong>: Froakie has pathetic defenses, and almost any decently powered attack will KO it.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Because Froakie is frail and lacks access to priority moves outside of Quick Attack, it struggles against opposing priority users. Froakie is particularly prone after it has just used Ice Beam, as it can be easily revenge killed by Timburr and Croagunk with their super effective priority moves, namely Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave. Fletchling can't switch into Froakie's attacks, but it can easily revenge kill Froakie as long as it's not behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Tentacool</strong>: Tentacool can tank anything Froakie throws at it, including Hidden Power Ground and 110 Base Power Acrobatics, and heal up with Berry Juice. It can then retaliate with Scald, which will OHKO Froakie if it has just used Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with high Special Defense stats, namely Munchlax and Lickitung, can tank any special hit that Froakie has to offer and easily retaliate. Both Munchlax and Lickilicky also take pitiful damage from physical attacks.</p>",

Ice Beam provides much-needed coverage against Grass- and Flying-types, such as Cottonee and Vullaby, respectively. The third slot is dedicated to whatever coverage move is needed. Hidden Power Grass is an option against opposing Water-types. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ground can be used to hit Magnemite, which would otherwise OHKO Froakie. Both options hit Chinchou, but Hidden Power Ground is generally better because using it changes Froakie into a Ground-type, giving it an immunity to Volt Switch. U-turn is used to provide momentum and to scout.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Special Attack and Speed EVs maximize Froakie's special damage output and let it hit its maximum possible Speed. A Naive nature boosts Froakie's Speed even further, while 68 Attack EVs slightly boost U-turn's power. The remaining EVs are put into Defense to let Froakie take physical priority attacks better. The IVs are chosen for the Hidden Powers; for example, an IV spread of 0 HP / 30 SpA lets Froakie have Hidden Power Grass, while a spread of 0 HP / 30 SpA / 30 SpD lets Froakie have Hidden Power Ground. Protean is the given ability to give Froakie STAB on all of its attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Froakie should function as a cleaner that can pick off most weakened foes, as if it attempts to KO a foe at full health and fails, it risks being KOed in return. Froakie also should come in via either a slow U-turn or Volt Switch or after a teammate has fainted, as Froakie cannot take any sort of hit. Froakie should also pick up momentum with U-turn when needed. Lastly, Ice Beam should be the most used attack, as it has perfect accuracy, unlike Hydro Pump.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slower Pokemon that have access to Volt Switch or U-turn make for great partners, as they can bring Froakie in safely without risking it being hit; Pokemon such as Chinchou and slow Mienfoo do this job well. Entry hazard setters, such as Ferroseed and Dwebble, are almost a must for Froakie, as they help it score more KOs. Defog support from the likes of Vullaby is also good, as Froakie will be worn down between Life Orb and switching out with U-turn. Priority sponges are also good, as Froakie's defenses are very low and priority moves will likely KO it. Larvesta resists Mach Punch and can potentially burn the attacker with Flame Body. Mienfoo is a good partner for absorbing Sucker Punch, while Archen and Chinchou can take Fletchling's Acrobatics.</p>"

Protean is the chosen ability, as it is one of the only reasons Froakie has a niche and provides STAB on all of its attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Froakie can function very well as a revenge killer against threats that have already set up, namely +2 Adamant Tirtouga, and slower Choice Scarf users such as Chinchou and Mienfoo. Early-game, Froakie functions best as a momentum grabber with U-turn, while mid- to late-game, it functions best as a revenge killer. Froakie, at all times during the match, is a great momentum grabber due to the switches it forces, which grants it late-game utility outside of revenge killing.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Froakie will often find itself grabbing momentum with U-turn, teammates that can form fast VoltTurn cores with it, such as Elekid and Chinchou, are appreciated. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Dwebble and Ferroseed also makes it easier for Froakie to score more KOs, as it aims to deal damage late-game while not taking much itself. Teammates that can take priority attacks are also very good, as such attacks can easily KO Froakie; Larvesta resists Mach Punch and can form a momentum core with Froakie, Mienfoo can take a Sucker Punch, and Archen, Chinchou, and Pawniard resist Fletchling's Acrobatics.</p>"

No item at all is an option to have immediate power with Acrobatics and should be used when Froakie runs U-turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to the amount of switches Froakie forces, Substitute is best used on a switch. However, if the foe doesn't switch, Froakie can stall with Substitute, activate Berry Juice, and retaliate with a STAB-boosted Acrobatics.

Priority sponges, such as Larvesta or Spritzee, are great partners, as they absorb Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, and the former can even use its ability, Flame Body, to burn foes and halve their Attack stat upon contact. Pokemon such as Mienfoo can absorb Sucker Punch, while Archen and Pawniard can absorb Fletchling's Acrobatics.

The EV spread maximizes Bunnelby's offensive capabilities, with the remaining EVs invested into Defense to better handle priority moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bunnelby's primary use in the early parts of the game is to revenge kill and wear down its own checks. Once priority users and checks, such as Pawniard or Ferroseed, have been removed, Bunnelby is able to sweep. It's especially important to remove priority move users because many of them can KO Bunnelby after minimal damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit support from Pokemon such as Pawniard and Stunky helps greatly in allowing Bunnelby to clean late-game with Return. Diglett helps remove foes resistant to Return as well because of its ability to trap and KO many Rock- and Steel-types. A check to Fighting-types is very important when using Bunnelby, with Spritzee being an excellent choice. Any Pokemon that can beat common priority move users, especially Pawniard and Fletchling, is very helpful. Ponyta is able to beat both of them, provided Stealth Rock is not on your side of the field. Entry hazards enable Bunnelby to KO Pokemon that rely on Sturdy and provide enough chip damage to obtain important 2HKOs.</p>"

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is Bunnelby's best STAB option and hits incredibly hard. Quick Attack is vital for revenge killing many frail Pokemon such as Carvanha and Fletchling. Earthquake has great coverage in conjunction with Return, as it heavily damages or KOes Rock- and Steel-types. Stone Edge punishes Archen and Dwebble, which are otherwise good checks to Bunnelby, and is a great move for hitting Ghost-types such as Gastly and Pumpkaboo, both of which could completely wall Bunnelby otherwise. Thief is specifically for hitting Ghost-types, notably Pumpkaboo-XL and Frillish.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize Bunnelby's offensive capabilities and the remainder is put into Defense to better take on priority moves. Reduced HP IVs ensure Bunnelby takes minimal Life Orb recoil, due to the recoil rounding down. Life Orb transforms Bunnelby into a threatening wallbreaker and a tough Pokemon to switch into. An Adamant nature helps Bunnelby hit as hard as possible, though a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed all Magnemite and Speed tie with Pawniard.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avoid switching Bunnelby directly into battle due to its low bulk, absence of resistances, and tendency to be worn down by Life Orb. Bring Bunnelby in safely as much as possible with the use of slow pivot move users. If Bunnelby ever gets hit by a Knock Off or another item-removing move, Thief can be used to take an item.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Life Orb Bunnelby goes exceptionally well with Sticky Web because it lacks the Speed to handle faster threats. Surskit is considered the most viable option for Sticky Web, but Spinarak may be used to switch into the Fighting-types that threaten Bunnelby. Bulky pivots such as Mienfoo and Chinchou provide Bunnelby with opportunities to come into battle. Depending on Bunnelby's coverage move, a teammate to handle Archen or bulky Ghost-types may be necessary. Pawniard nicely handles Archen, and Pursuit traps Ghost-types.</p>"

  "Litleo": {
    "overview": "<p>As the only Fire / Normal type in Little Cup, Litleo has a unique set of resistances and immunities. It has good Speed and Special Attack, as well as great dual STAB coverage. However, its rather useless abilities and weakness to the Fighting-type attacks commonly seen in Little Cup hinder it greatly. Litleo's Fire typing also limits its ability to switch in due to the prevalence of Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rivalry is an option, boosting Litleo's offensive stats versus opponents of the same gender. However, this ability is extremely matchup reliant and also drops Litleo's offensive stats versus opponents of the opposite gender. Flame Charge, although weak, can be used to finish off a weakened foe and allows Litleo to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, which can be very valuable when cleaning up teams that carry faster Pokemon. Dark Pulse and Snarl both provide Litleo with a means of hitting Ghost-types super effectively. Dark Pulse is the stronger of the two and has a chance to flinch, while Snarl, although weaker, lowers the Special Attack of the foe. Taunt makes use of Litleo's above average Speed stat to stop entry hazards and status. Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit Archen, which otherwise switches into Litleo with little fear. Litleo has access to the ability Moxie, allowing it to increase its low Attack to tolerable levels after one boost. With a decent physical movepool and access to Flame Charge, Moxie Litleo has the potential to sweep an unsuspecting opponent. However, due to the amount of setup required to accomplish this, the Special Attacker set is usually more effective. Litleo's decent Speed stat can also warrant the use of a Choice Scarf, allowing Litleo to outspeed the common 16 Speed Choice Scarf Pokemon that roam around Little Cup.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types resist both of Litleo's STAB moves and can hit Litleo with super effective STAB moves. Sturdy + Berry Juice Rock-types, such as Onix and Tirtouga, can also stay in against Litleo with little fear of getting KOed by Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types can destroy Litleo with their super effective STAB moves. Timburr, in particular, is a huge threat as it does not care about Will-O-Wisp, which boosts its Attack stat thanks to Guts.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Litleo relies on Hidden Power Grass and Hyper Voice to hit Water-types; as such, bulkier Water-types will be able to switch in and threaten Litleo with their super effective STAB moves. Staryu is especially threatening, as it can outspeed Litleo and take any of its moves, using Recover to restore its health and repeatedly bother Litleo. Carvanha can revenge kill Litleo very easily with access to both Speed Boost and Aqua Jet; however, it generally cannot switch into Will-O-Wisp, Hyper Voice, and Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types can easily dispatch Litleo with their super effective STAB moves; however, Litleo can still hit Ground-types hard with its Fire-type STAB moves, limiting their ability to switch in. Even so, Litleo is outsped by Diglett, and risks a Speed tie with Drilbur.</p>",

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is Litleo's primary STAB attack and its most powerful move. Flamethrower can be used instead for more consistent accuracy, but it lacks the raw power of Fire Blast. Hyper Voice is the secondary STAB move on the set, granting Litleo nice neutral coverage on everything but Rock-types. Hidden Power Grass is Litleo's main means of hitting Rock-types, such as Tirtouga, Onix, and Omanyte; however, due to the IV drop, its use causes Litleo to only have 16 Special Attack instead of 17. Will-O-Wisp nabs the final slot, providing Litleo with a nifty support move to cripple opposing physical attackers, mainly the Fighting-types that cause Litleo trouble.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Speed EVs and Timid nature allow Litleo to reach 17 Speed, a very important Speed tier in Little Cup. 176 Special Attack EVs allow to Litleo to hit 16 Special Attack, and the rest of the EVs are distributed to bolster Litleo's bulk. Life Orb is the preferred item to boost Litleo's offensive capabilities. Unnerve is Litleo's only ability actually worth using, as Moxie is useless for a special set and Rivalry is unreliable for boosts.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Litleo is useful for dealing with Steel-types, such as Ferroseed and Pawniard, which it can outspeed and KO; however, Litleo does not enjoy taking Thunder Waves or Knock Offs, respectively. Litleo can also easily KO Grass-types, but it is vulnerable to Foongus's Spore and some of the various coverage moves that common Grass-types run. Ghost-types cannot hit Litleo with their STAB moves, making Litleo a decent check to these Pokemon. Litleo can also effectively lure in Water- and Fighting-types and burn them with Will-O-Wisp, effectively diminishing their offensive presence if they are physical attackers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Litleo's weakness to entry hazards, entry hazard removers such as Drilbur and Vullaby, are very helpful. Foongus makes a decent partner thanks to its handy resistances to Fighting- and Water-type moves and its ability to handle Rock- and Ground-type Pokemon. Water-types aid in defeating Rock- and Ground-type Pokemon, and Staryu in particular can provide Rapid Spin support for Litleo. Fighting-types can deal with Rock-types and appreciate Litleo's ability to soak up Will-O-Wisp, especially from Ghost-types. Pokemon that can handle Timburr, such as Fletchling and Doduo, are incredibly helpful as Timburr can safely switch into a Will-O-Wisp and threaten Litleo with a super effective Mach Punch. Spritzee can take Fighting-type moves and provide cleric support for Litleo, which can handle Steel-type Pokemon in return. Snubbull fulfills a similar role and can spread paralysis with Thunder Wave. Both of the aforementioned Fairy-type Pokemon can also check Carvanha, which otherwise threatens Litleo with Waterfall and Aqua Jet.</p>"

This means that Flabebe does not need to run Rest and Sleep Talk or Wish and Protect, granting it another moveslot to use for coverage. Flabebe has an excellent typing for taking on Fighting-types, but its lackluster physical bulk and useless ability hold it back. Flabebe also has a weak offensive presence and often requires Calm Mind boosts to do significant damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flabebe can act as a cleric with Aromatherapy, but such a set is outclassed by Spritzee. Hidden Power Fighting can be used to KO Pawniard if using a Modest nature. Flabebe can fit on sun teams with a set consisting of Sunny Day, Solar Beam, and Synthesis, which is boosted by the sun, but it lacks the offensive presence necessary to be effective on them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: The very common Pawniard outspeeds Flabebe and OHKOes it with its super effective Steel-type attacks. Sturdy Magnemite can KO it with Flash Cannon and avoids the KO from Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Skrelp resists Moonblast and KOes Flabebe with its Adaptability-boosted Poison-type STAB moves. Foongus takes little damage from Hidden Power Ground, while Croagunk threatens it with Sludge Bomb or Gunk Shot.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Ponyta, Growlithe, and Vulpix (though it sets sun and boosts Synthesis) resist Moonblast and can easily switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers, particularly setup sweepers such as Tirtouga and Shellder, can exploit Flabebe's mediocre Defense and deal heavy damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off Users</strong>: Without Eviolite, Flabebe struggles to set up and is much more easily dealt with.</p> <p><strong>Rain, Hail, and Sand Setters</strong>: Snover and Hippopotas can set hail and sand, respectively, and lower Flabebe's healing from Synthesis.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Calm Mind, Flabebe can set up and increase its Special Attack and Special Defense to high levels. Synthesis is vital, as it provides one-turn recovery, which is one of Flabebe's only niches over other Fairy-types; however, be aware that Synthesis is dependent on weather and has low PP. Moonblast is a solid STAB attack that can deal heavy damage to Fighting- and Dark-types. Psychic is a powerful coverage option to hit many Poison-types such as Gastly and Croagunk hard, while Hidden Power Fire heavily damages Steel- and Grass-types such as Ferroseed, Pawniard, and Foongus. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ground can be used to hit Poison-, Steel-, Fire-, and Electric-types super effectively; it notably OHKOes or heavily damages Magnemite, Skrelp, and Ponyta.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite is used to increase Flabebe's bulk so that it can set up Calm Mind as consistently as possible. A Bold nature is generally preferred, though a Modest one can boost Flabebe's Special Attack enough to guarantee some OHKOs, such as on Trubbish with a +1 Psychic. The EVs and nature make Flabebe as bulky as possible while still allowing it to OHKO Eviolite-lacking Foongus after Stealth Rock damage when boosted. Flabebe hits 11 Speed with 20 Speed EVs, which enables it to outspeed Timburr, Skrelp, and slow variants of Croagunk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Beware of weather conditions such as rain and sandstorm, as they halve Flabebe's healing from Synthesis. Even though Flabebe can be used to counter Fighting-types, sweeping becomes much more difficult if they Knock Off its Eviolite. Try to weaken or KO Flabebe's checks and counters before setting up with Calm Mind.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-types such as Vulpix and Ponyta can deal with Steel-types such as Pawniard.; Vulpix also boosts Flabebe's healing from Synthesis with its ability Drought. Ground-types like Drilbur and Diglett threaten Steel-, Poison-, and Ground-types that might impede Flabebe from sweeping. Flabebe can take on Fighting-types and thus allow Normal-types such as Porygon to flourish. Pokemon that can switch into Knock Off, such as Trubbish, Shellos, and Mienfoo, can help Flabebe retain its bulk and allow it to sweep more easily. Fighting-types such as the aforementioned Mienfoo can also check Pawniard and weaken Poison-types like Foongus with Knock Off.</p>"

  "Skiddo": {
    "overview": "<p>Skiddo is the only Pokemon in Little Cup with access to both Milk Drink and Horn Leech. Its decent bulk and offensive stats allow it to run a Bulk Up set rather effectively. Although Chespin can also run Bulk Up, Skiddo's access to Horn Leech, higher Special Defense, and Milk Drink allow it to perform better as a Grass-type Bulk Up user. However, Skiddo has difficulty dealing with many top-tier threats, especially Fletchling, without any Bulk Up boosts, and its pure Grass typing leaves it with few resistances and some common weaknesses. Even though it has a small movepool and a mediocre Speed stat, Skiddo can still power through teams once it gains enough boosts.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leaf Blade is more powerful than Horn Leech and can be used if one is running Milk Drink. Payback can be used to OHKO Gastly; however, Gastly has little trouble dealing with Skiddo anyways, as it can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp or hit it with a super effective STAB Sludge Bomb. Wild Charge allows Skiddo to hit Flying-types, but it overlaps coverage with Skiddo's Grass-type STAB attacks. A special set is feasible, but Skiddo lacks a good special movepool, only having access to Grass-, Normal-, and Water-type special attacks. A fully offensive set can also be utilized; however, Skiddo lacks the Speed and Attack stats to effectively pressure the opponent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Doduo and Fletchling can outspeed and deal massive damage to Skiddo with Brave Bird and Acrobatics, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Dwebble and Larvesta can beat Skiddo with their Bug-type STAB attacks and, in Larvesta's case, Fire-type STAB attacks; however, neither enjoy being hit by a Rock Slide on the switch, especially Larvesta, which is easily KOed.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Ponyta and Growlithe can easily switch into Skiddo's Grass-type attacks, but they must be wary of Rock Slide and Bulldoze.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Foongus resists Skiddo's STAB attacks, is hit neutrally by all of its coverage moves, and can easily deal with it. Trubbish and Koffing do not fear Horn Leech or Rock Slide; however, Trubbish doesn't enjoy taking a boosted Bulldoze.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Skiddo has trouble dealing with Grass-types, as it has to rely on weaker coverage moves to hit them. Phantump and Pumpkaboo can prove to be very troublesome, as they can burn Skiddo, crippling and effectively walling it. Cottonee can easily switch into Skiddo and Encore Bulk Up, rendering Skiddo rather useless.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferroseed fears nothing from Skiddo. Even a super effective Brick Break does little damage to it, and it can cripple Skiddo with Thunder Wave or just set up hazards on it.</p> <p><strong>Bulk Up Users</strong>: Bulk Up Skiddo loses to opposing Bulk Up sweepers, such as Timburr, which are able to outlast and outdamage Skiddo.</p>",

Rock Slide allows Skiddo to hit Flying-types for super effective damage, and Return is a great move for neutral coverage. Brick Break hits Steel-types, notably Pawniard, which can otherwise take any of Skiddo's other moves, super effectively. Bulldoze is a unique coverage move, hitting Fire-, Poison-, and Steel-types; however, be wary of Pawniard, which can gain an Attack boost via Defiant after its Speed is dropped by Bulldoze. Milk Drink is a great recovery move that can be used if Horn Leech doesn't suffice; it also allows Skiddo to recover health when Horn Leech would be ineffective.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>180 Speed EVs allow Skiddo to reach 14 Speed, allowing Skiddo to outspeed the standard bulky Larvesta and OHKO it with a +1 Rock Slide. The Defense EVs hit an Eviolite number, and the Special Defense EVs allow SKiddo to avoid the 2HKO from physically defensive Chinchou's Ice Beam. The remaining EVs are put into Attack to boost Skiddo's damage output. A spread of 236 Atk / 52 Def / 220 SpD could be used to boost more easily, especially in tandem with Milk Drink.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It's usually best to save Skiddo until Pokemon that resist Grass-type moves have been removed or weakened, as it can then recover health with Horn Leech. Skiddo can also set up on opposing walls, such as Spritzee, and can quickly heal off Moonblast damage with Horn Leech or Milk Drink. Skiddo can check physically defensive Chinchou, but an invested Ice Beam can 2HKO Skiddo, so switching in can be challenging. Also, Skiddo doesn't appreciate being burned.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chinchou can beat many of the Flying- and Fire-types that threaten Skiddo, and in return, Skiddo can take Grass- and Ground-type moves for Chinchou. Flying- and Fire-types can deal with Bug- and Grass-types that trouble Skiddo, and they appreciate Skiddo's ability to force out Chinchou. Ground-types such as Drilbur can deal with Poison-types such as Trubbish, which can otherwise set up on Skiddo, and appreciate Skiddo's capability to deal with Water-types. Although it is weak to Fire-type moves, Magnemite can handle Flying-types with ease and is immune to Poison-type attacks. Tentacool shares great synergy with Skiddo, as it can take Fire-, Bug-, and Poison-type attacks, while Skiddo can take the Ground-type attacks aimed at Tentacool. Rock-types also pair well with Skiddo, as they can handle Flying-types such as Fletchling, which can otherwise hit Skiddo with a super effective STAB move or proceed to boost.</p>"

Pancham also has three good abilities: Mold Breaker, which allows it to remove items from Sticky Hold Pokemon using Knock Off; Iron Fist, which increases the power of Drain Punch; and Scrappy, which grants Pancham the ability to hit Ghost-types with its STAB moves. With its signature move, Parting Shot, Pancham can function as an extraordinary pivot; however, it can forgo its ability to pivot in order to become a great wallbreaker with Swords Dance.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be utilized to take full advantage of Parting Shot. It hits 14 Speed without a Jolly nature, allowing Pancham to maintain its wonderful 18 Attack. The remaining EVs should go in Defense and Special Defense, and the moveset should be Parting Shot, Storm Throw / Drain Punch, Knock Off, and Gunk Shot / Zen Headbutt. An all-out attacking set with Drain Punch, Knock Off, Zen Headbutt, and Gunk Shot allows Pancham to surprise both Fairy- and Poison-type switch-ins. A Bulk Up set can be used, but it is outclassed by Timburr, which has the same bulk as Pancham, the ability Guts, and access to priority in Mach Punch. However, because Pancham has a slot to use Gunk Shot, it can remove Fairy-types more easily than Timburr can because Timburr does not have a moveslot for Poison Jab. A Substitute + Focus Punch set could be used, but it is easily taken advantage of, and Pancham would rather act as a pivot with Parting Shot or even use Knock Off on switches it forces than set up a Substitute. Pancham can use a RestTalk set with Circle Throw, Bulk Up, and the ability Scrappy, but the sets listed are much better. Circle Throw can be used on any set if your team is stacking entry hazards in order to rack up damage. Pancham has other STAB options such as Power-Up Punch and Storm Throw, but the former is too weak to take advantage of, and Storm Throw, while being much more powerful than Drain Punch, does not recover Pancham's HP, which hinders its longevity. Superpower is also another STAB option, but it should not be used because it makes taking advantage of Pancham much easier. Pancham has a wide offensive movepool, which includes the elemental punches, Stone Edge, Dual Chop, and Iron Head, but these moves generally provide less coverage than the moves already listed on its main sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Croagunk, Trubbish, and Koffing can switch into Pancham's STAB moves, but none of them like taking a Zen Headbutt or Knock Off. Koffing can also burn Pancham with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Spritzee, Cottonee, and Snubbull resist Pancham's STAB moves, but they must be wary of Gunk Shot and Knock Off. Gunk Shot easily KOes all three of these threats, while Knock Off discourages them from switching in as easily. Cottonee can Encore Pancham into one of its STAB moves or Knock Off and proceed to switch out to let a Pokemon such as Fletchling set up.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Doduo, Fletchling, Archen, and Vullaby can all come in and threaten Pancham with their STAB moves. They all outspeed Pancham as well, so this can limit Pancham's ability to do its job.</p> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: As Pancham is an offensive, physically oriented Pokemon, Will-O-Wisp easily puts a damper on its ability to function properly. Pumpkaboo, Ponyta, and Larvesta are all good status spreaders against Pancham.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Abra, Gothita, and Slowpoke all have STAB moves that hit Pancham for super effective damage. Gothita is especially notable for having the ability to trap and KO weakened Pancham.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: While Pancham is quite bulky, faster Pokemon can wear Pancham down throughout the battle, and, if it is weakened, easily revenge kill it.</p>",

      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Parting Shot allows Pancham to function as a pivot and provide its teammates opportunities to set up. Drain Punch is the STAB move of choice because it allows Pancham to recover some of its HP and stay alive longer to pivot throughout the battle. Knock Off removes foes' items and provides great utility to Pancham's teammates. Gunk Shot hits Fairy-types very hard, even 2HKOing Spritzee, while Zen Headbutt allows Pancham to KO Poison- and Fighting-types much more easily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>180 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature maximize Pancham's Attack. 100 Defense and 212 Special Defense EVs give Pancham Eviolite numbers and good bulk to survive many hits while pivoting, even Focus Sash Abra's Psychic. The 12 Speed EVs give Pancham 11 Speed, allowing it to outspeed Spritzee, Snubbull, and Timburr. Mold Breaker allows Pancham to remove the items of Pokemon that have the ability Sticky Hold with Knock Off, which means Pancham can beat Trubbish without having to use Zen Headbutt. This also means Pancham can bypass Sturdy and KO Pokemon that rely on the SturdyJuice strategy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Pancham into Pokemon it can capitalize on, such as Pawniard, Ferroseed, Omanyte, and Tirtouga. KO weaker threats, and dent the switch-ins. Using Parting Shot on a predicted switch grabs momentum and can help a teammate set up. Pancham is slow and it lacks access to priority moves, unlike Croagunk and Timburr, so switching into Pawniard is not always safe, as Pawniard can outspeed and KO Pancham. Pawniard can also come in on a Parting Shot and grab Attack boosts thanks to Defiant.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can use Volt Switch or U-turn are great teammates for Pancham; Mienfoo, Chinchou, Fletchling, and Archen are good examples. Sweepers that appreciate Parting Shot and can capitalize on its use, such as Swords Dance Fletchling, Swords Dance Pawniard, Shell Smash Tirtouga, Omanyte, and Shellder, pair well with Pancham. Pokemon that can remove Fairy- or Poison-types can be beneficial, such as Pawniard, Ferroseed, and Foongus for the former, and Abra, Archen, Drilbur, and Diglett for the latter. Gothita can be a useful teammate, as Pancham helps get Gothita in for free due to its low Speed and Parting Shot, and Gothita removes Pokemon Pancham doesn't like, such as Croagunk. Spritzee can use Aromatherapy while Lickitung can use Heal Bell, and both can use Wish in order to keep Pancham healthy throughout the battle.</p>"

Drain Punch gives Pancham means of recovery while wallbreaking and is also a great move in general. Knock Off removes items and allows Pancham and its teammates to sweep. Gunk Shot removes common Fairy-type switch-ins from play, and Zen Headbutt KOes common Poison-type switch-ins and opposing Fighting-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>180 EVs and an Adamant nature maximize Pancham's Attack. 12 Speed EVs allows Pancham to hit 11 Speed, which allows it to outspeed Skrelp, Timburr, and Snubbull. 100 Defense and 212 Special Defense EVs allow Pancham to survive a variety of hits, most notably Focus Sash Abra's Psychic and +2 Tirtouga's Waterfall. Mold Breaker allows Pancham to Knock Off the items of Pokemon that have the ability Sticky Hold, allowing Pancham to KO Trubbish without using Zen Headbutt. Pancham also bypasses Sturdy, allowing it to KO Pokemon that rely on the SturdyJuice strategy. Pancham can also run a set with 252 Speed EVs, which allows it to outspeed many walls such as Pumpkaboo and Vullaby. However, doing so reduces its bulk, so keep that in mind.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Pancham into Pokemon it forces out, such as Pawniard or Tirtouga. After Pancham has successfully switched in, use Knock Off early-game to remove Pancham's checks' items. During the late-game, use Swords Dance on the switches Pancham forces, and then proceed to remove walls to clear the way for your sweeper.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Other Pokemon that can use Knock Off, such as Fighting-types and Pawniard, help support Pancham. Pokemon that can pivot into Pancham, such as Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Foongus, are also a big help to get Pancham in freely. Entry hazards help weaken walls that Pancham wants to break through, so entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed, Archen, and Tirtouga help Pancham do its job. Pokemon that deal with Flying-types help; Tirtouga, Chinchou, and Archen are good options to deal with these threats. Gothita can be a useful partner to remove Poison-types, opposing Fighting-types, and items from walls with Trick. Cottonee, Stunky, and Diglett can be useful partners, as they all learn Memento and help Pancham set up easily. Also, Diglett traps Poison-types, while Stunky traps Psychic-types. Again, Pancham appreciates the support of Spritzee and Lickitung; Spritzee has Aromatherapy while Lickitung has Heal Bell, and they both can heal it with Wish. Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Fletchling, Swords Dance Pawniard, and the Shell Smash users appreciate Pancham's ability to break through a wide array of walls.</p>"

  "Honedge": {
    "overview": "<p>Honedge <em>carves</em> itself a niche in Little Cup thanks to its fantastic Steel / Ghost typing that lets it check or Pursuit trap major threats such as Abra, Porygon, and Fletchling. Honedge's typing is complemented by its high physical stats and good movepool, containing STAB priority in Shadow Sneak and coverage options such as Sacred Sword and Rock Slide to hit its counters. However, Honedge is slow and can be either extremely useful or complete deadweight depending on team matchup. A lack of recovery outside of Berry Juice combined with a Knock Off weakness makes it easy to wear down. In addition, it can barely make use of No Guard offensively and is left unable to dodge low-accuracy moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic makes Honedge a much better Porygon counter, but Honedge struggles to find a moveslot for it. Autotomize is an alternative boosting option that synergizes well with Destiny Bond, but Honedge is usually too weak to sweep and is still relatively slow after a boost. Shadow Claw deals with certain Pokemon such as Pumpkaboo-XL and Shellder better than anything else Honedge uses. Honedge has a number of other potentially viable options including Magnet Rise and Reflect; it is too slow to make these consistently effective, however.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Honedge lacks a way to do much damage to Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr, allowing them to switch into Honedge safely and force it out with the threat of a super effective Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta can easily force out Honedge with the threat of a burn or a super effective STAB Flare Blitz. They must watch out for Rock Slide, however.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Honedge cannot do much damage to Water-types, while they can force Honedge out with the threat of a crippling Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Honedge cannot 2HKO common Ground-types such as Drilbur and Hippopotas and is forced out by the threat of a super effective STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Pawniard and Vullaby can threaten Honedge with a super effective STAB Knock Off. Honedge can hit them on the switch with either Sacred Sword or Rock Slide, depending on the Pokemon.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Iron Head is Honedge's strongest STAB attack and hits Fairy-types such as Spritzee super effectively. Shadow Sneak provides Honedge with STAB priority, letting it pick off threats that have been sufficiently weakened. Pursuit puts frailer Pokemon such as Fletchling and Abra into a checkmate position, weakening them significantly and making them easier to check later in the match. Alternatively, Swords Dance can be used to give Honedge much more offensive presence. Sacred Sword OHKOes Pawniard and 2HKOes Porygon after Stealth Rock damage. Rock Slide is a viable alternative that can catch would-be counters such as Vullaby and Fire-types on the switch, 2HKOing them after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread with a Careful nature allows Honedge to survive many powerful super effective special attacks, including Fletchling's Overheat, Abra's Shadow Ball, and Download Porygon's Hidden Power Fire. The Attack and Speed investment lets Honedge hit a jump point in Attack and outspeed Spritzee, respectively, with the remaining EVs put into Defense to increase overall bulk. Berry Juice is Honedge's only form of recovery and gives it increased longevity, while Eviolite significantly increases its bulk. An alternate EV spread of 196 Atk / 36 Def / 220 SpD / 52 Spe with an Adamant nature is also viable; this spread works well with Swords Dance and allows Honedge to always 2HKO offensive Porygon, but it makes Honedge noticeably less bulky.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Honedge as a switch-in to powerful special attackers such as Porygon and Abra, Fairy-types such as Spritzee, and certain physical attackers such as Fletchling and Shellder. Pursuit is useful to guarantee that opposing Abra's Focus Sashes will be broken and leave opposing Fletchling at very low health if Stealth Rock is up. Use Shadow Sneak to pick off threats that are weak to Ghost, such as Gastly. The combination of Pursuit and Shadow Sneak can force mind games with threats such as Gastly; however, Honedge must be careful around these Pokemon, as a misprediction can leave it crippled or KOed. Honedge is severely crippled by burns and cannot dodge Will-O-Wisp, so try to avoid users of Will-O-Wisp and Scald. When using Honedge, be careful to avoid Knock Off users if its Berry Juice has not been consumed, as they can easily cripple or KO Honedge by removing its only form of recovery. However, if its Berry Juice has been consumed, Honedge can serve as a decent Pawniard lure, as it is not OHKOed by any of Pawniard's Dark-type STAB attacks while Pawniard is OHKOed by Sacred Sword in return.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr make excellent teammates for Honedge, as they greatly appreciate Honedge's ability to deal with Fletchling, Abra, and Fairy-types and can absorb Knock Offs for it. Fairy-types are also useful for switching into Knock Offs. Spritzee can keep Honedge healthy with Wish support, while Snubbull is a better Knock off absorber and can provide Speed control with Thunder Wave. Bulky Water-types such as Chinchou work well with Honedge, as they beat Fire-types, some of Honedge's most potent counters. Honedge works well on sun teams because it can trap and eliminate Abra and Fletchling, two of the biggest threats to the playstyle. Entry hazard support from the likes of Drilbur helps Honedge get additional KOs, most notably against opposing Porygon and Fletchling.</p>"

  "Spritzee": {
    "overview": "<p>Spritzee's great bulk and typing allow it to check several of the metagame's most prominent Fighting- and Dark-types and support its team with Wish and Aromatherapy. These traits make Spritzee invaluable to defensive, balanced, and even some offensive teams, as it has great defensive synergy with numerous Pokemon and faces very little competition for a teamslot as a Wish user. Aroma Veil enhances Spritzee's support capabilities even further by granting it an immunity to Taunt and Encore. In addition to being a great support Pokemon, Spritzee can also function as an effective late-game sweeper by using Calm Mind and its amazing bulk. Despite the offensive and defensive usefulness of Spritzee's Fairy typing, it can be a hindrance at times, as it is easily walled by common Poison- and Steel-types, including Foongus, Magnemite, and Ferroseed. This is a serious issue for Calm Mind Spritzee, as it will have trouble sweeping or even posing as an offensive threat until these foes are removed or heavily weakened. Furthermore, Spritzee tends to rely on Moonblast as its sole attacking move, and its offensive presence is unreliable without Calm Mind boosts, which can make it rather predictable and easy to switch into as a result. Because Spritzee is frequently used to handle Fighting-types, its Eviolite is often removed by Knock Off during the match, which can impede Spritzee's late-game sweeping capabilities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Spritzee can function as a reliable Trick Room setter thanks to its natural bulk, recovery, and immunity to Taunt, but Trick Room is an underwhelming strategy in the LC metagame. Covet is also a viable option, allowing Spritzee to consistently check Fighting-types and switch into Knock Off with ease. Draining Kiss can be used over Moonblast to provide some immediate recovery, but Moonblast's power allows Spritzee to land key KOs that Draining Kiss misses out on. Hidden Power Fighting and Hidden Power Fire can be used to take care of Pawniard and Ferroseed, respectively. Spritzee has plenty of other coverage options, such as Thunderbolt, Flash Cannon, and Psychic, but generally doesn't have room on its moveset for coverage moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Spritzee will be hard-pressed to handle Steel-types given their resistance to Moonblast. Magnemite's Flash Cannon and Pawniard's Iron Head will easily 2HKO Spritzee, and Ferroseed can set up entry hazards and wear down Spritzee with Leech Seed and Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Gastly, Foongus, Skrelp, and several other Poison-types can tank a Moonblast and threaten Spritzee with their super effective STAB moves. Foongus in particular can run Clear Smog to remove boosts from Calm Mind Spritzee, preventing it from sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Ponyta, Vulpix, and Larvesta resist Moonblast and can power through Spritzee with their strong Fire-type attacks.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish provides Spritzee with a form of recovery and can be used to heal its teammates. Protect ensures Spritzee can heal itself with Wish, and it can provide other situational uses, such as scouting opposing Choice item users and avoiding damage from Fake Out. Calm Mind allows Spritzee to set up late-game and attempt a sweep. Spritzee can also run Aromatherapy in this slot, trading the ability to set up for the ability to remove status effects from itself and its teammates. Moonblast is Spritzee's best STAB move, scoring a super effective hit on the Fighting-types that Spritzee checks while also providing good neutral coverage on a large portion of the metagame, which is ideal for sweeping.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Defense alongside a Bold nature allow Spritzee to check physical attackers as effectively as possible. Maximum investment in HP is also useful for passing the largest possible Wishes to Spritzee's teammates. The remaining EVs give Spritzee another point in Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed, while Eviolite is used to enhance Spritzee's bulk even further. Aroma Veil gives Spritzee an immunity to Taunt and Encore, which is invaluable for a supporting Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Spritzee should mainly be switching in on Fighting-types beside Croagunk and Pancham and Dark-types beside Pawniard. Once Spritzee is in safely, it can use Wish to heal itself or its teammates and can also clear its team of status effects if it runs Aromatherapy. If Spritzee is carrying Calm Mind, bring it in late-game once its checks and counters are weakened enough to begin setting up. Spritzee's Eviolite should be preserved if attempting a late-game sweep, as this maximizes Spritzee's potential setup opportunities. Be cognizant of the mechanics of Wish and Protect, as being too reliant on Protect can sometimes allow the opponent to switch in a dangerous offensive Pokemon late-game and use Spritzee as setup bait; always consider the possibility of switching to a teammate or predicting a switch-in with Moonblast after using Wish.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>If Spritzee carries Calm Mind, its best partners are Pokemon that can defeat Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-types, giving Spritzee a much better shot at sweeping late-game. Porygon has excellent synergy with Spritzee; together, the two can check a huge portion of the metagame and provide a defensive backbone for several team archetypes. Porygon can run an offensive set with Download to lure in and KO opposing Steel-types; Hidden Power Fire KOes Ferroseed after Tri Attack and Hidden Power Fighting OHKOes Pawniard. Diglett and Gothita can trap numerous threats to Spritzee and KO them. Diglett can trap most Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types, but misses out on Foongus and Ferroseed. Gothita can trap Foongus and Ferroseed as well as Poison-types, but has more difficulty trapping several Fire- and Steel-types. Fire-types such as Ponyta and Numel can defeat several of Spritzee's checks, notably Steel-types and Foongus, with ease. Ponyta and Numel can also break through Poison-types such as Gastly and Croagunk, as these Pokemon cannot tank strong Fire-type attacks. Numel can also handle opposing Fire-types thanks to Earth Power, which Ponyta struggles to do. However, Ponyta can be used as a check to Fighting-types so that Spritzee doesn't have to risk switching into a Knock Off.</p> <p>Spritzee can form defensive cores with a large number of Pokemon in the metagame, courtesy of its typing and great bulk. Normal-types such as Munchlax and Lickitung have good synergy with Spritzee; Munchlax is able to handle opposing Steel-types with Fire Punch or Earthquake, while Lickitung can form an incredibly bulky double Wish core with Spritzee. In return, Spritzee will be able to take on the Fighting-types that trouble these Normal-type partners. Hippopotas and Ferroseed also synergize well with Spritzee, providing residual damage on the opposing team with entry hazards, and in Hippopotas's case, Sand Stream. Hippopotas provides an answer to Fire-types and grounded Poison-types, although it dislikes being burned or poisoned. Ferroseed handles Foongus and Skrelp that lack Hidden Power Fire and can also check opposing Shell Smash users and offensive Water-types that may threaten to sweep the team. In return, Spritzee offers these partners valuable Wish support. Thanks to Bulletproof, Chespin can easily handle Foongus, Bellsprout, and Gastly. Bulky Pokemon that are being worn down and Pokemon that hate status effects will appreciate Spritzee's cleric support. Mienfoo, Pancham, Chinchou, Skrelp, and Timburr are all great examples of Pokemon that can benefit from having Spritzee as a teammate.</p>"

  "Inkay": {
    "overview": "<p>Inkay's ability Contrary in tandem with Superpower allows it to be a unique sweeper; rather than lowering Inkay's Attack and Defense stats, Superpower raises them, essentially being a 120 Base Power Bulk Up. Inkay's STAB moves Knock Off and Psycho Cut have perfect coverage alongside Superpower, meaning Inkay is free to run one of its useful utility options, such as Switcheroo, Trick Room, or Destiny Bond. Inkay's stats, while respectable, are somewhat of a letdown considering that it has no resistances aside from an immunity to the uncommon Psychic-type and is weak to Fairy. Inkay also suffers from a 4x weakness to Bug-type attacks, so common U-turn users will have an easy time forcing Inkay out. This can be an issue, as Inkay's lack of recovery means that constantly being switched out will cause entry hazard damage to quickly accumulate. This can be considered a worthwhile trade-off, however, as Choice Scarf Inkay is a fantastic revenge killer and is able to sweep teams with its perfect coverage and decent Attack stat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Destiny Bond could help Inkay grab a final KO if it is low on health, especially on the Trick Room set, as it can outspeed almost all Pokemon when Trick Room is active. Topsy-Turvy might be useful for reversing the work of opposing setup sweepers, but it's very niche and Inkay's low Speed makes it difficult to justify giving Topsy-Turvy a moveslot. Rock Slide can score a surprise KO on a weakened Larvesta; however, Jolly Inkay can only OHKO it 6.3% of the time. Hypnosis is usable, but its accuracy is too poor for it to be consistently effective. Taunt can be used, but Inkay doesn't have the Speed stat to utilize it effectively, much like most of Inkay's support options. Inkay has decent special attacking options, but its poor Special Attack stat and no way of boosting it make them unviable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Spritzee and Snubbull both resist Knock Off and Superpower and are able to OHKO Choice Scarf Inkay with their STAB moves after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>U-turn Users</strong>: Inkay's 4x weakness to Bug-type moves mean that common users of U-turn such as Mienfoo and Larvesta can heavily damage Inkay, even after a Defense boost from Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Inkay's lack of recovery means that entry hazards and other forms of passive damage will wear it down very quickly, meaning it can be picked off even by a weak priority move.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Hippopotas, Pancham, and Timburr are bulky enough to take any move from Inkay. However, these Pokemon can often become setup bait if they switch into a Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: The Choice Scarf set is particularly troubled by Ghost-types such as Gastly and Pumpkaboo; if Inkay locks itself into Superpower, they can switch in for free. However, they must remain wary of Inkay's other attacks, particularly Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Trubbish</strong>: Although it must remain wary of Psycho Cut, Trubbish can easily come in on Inkay when it is locked into Knock Off or Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Common Taunt users, particularly Cottonee as it is not weak to any of Inkay's moves, can prevent Inkay from setting up Trick Room.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is a Dark-type STAB move that removes items from foes, allowing Inkay to cripple its counters, and can therefore be very effective early-game. Superpower's side effect is reversed by Contrary, meaning that it boosts Inkay's Attack and Defense stats instead, enabling Inkay to clean up teams that lack Pokemon that resist Fighting. Psycho Cut is a STAB move that hits Fighting-types for super effective damage while also giving Inkay neutral coverage against Fairy-type foes. Switcheroo allows a severely weakened Inkay to give its Choice Scarf to a foe before it goes down; however, it can be used any time to cripple walls such as Spritzee and Larvesta.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Contrary reverses the side effect of Superpower, turning Inkay into a vicious sweeper once its checks are removed. 236 Speed EVs with a Choice Scarf allow Inkay to outspeed the entire unboosted tier, as well as 14 Speed Choice Scarf users and +1 Corphish if Inkay is using a Jolly nature. An Adamant nature can be used for securing some KOs that Inkay misses with a Jolly nature, such as Archen after Stealth Rock, at the cost of Speed tying with the above foes. 244 EVs in Attack make Inkay strong enough for its attacks to hit hard, and the remaining EVs are invested into HP and Defense to make Inkay marginally bulkier.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use caution when using Superpower and Psycho Cut; if your opponent has a Ghost-type such as Gastly or Pumpkaboo, it can come in for free on a Superpower, whereas Psycho Cut will let Pawniard and Vullaby come in for free. Early-game, Knock Off is the best option, as it removes items from Inkay's counters, softening them up for Inkay's teammates or Inkay to sweep more easily late-game. Inkay can wreak havoc at nearly any point in the game. If it gets an opening early- or mid-game, it can repeatedly use Superpower in order to break walls. It's also a fantastic revenge killer, able to take down weakened foes such as Mienfoo, Pawniard, Timburr, Gothita, and Ferroseed. If Inkay is within KO range of the foe's attack, offloading its Choice Scarf onto an enemy might give a teammate an opportunity to set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Inkay's weakness to Fairy-types requires that one of its teammates, such as a Steel-type such as Pawniard or Ferroseed or a Fire-type such as Larvesta or Ponyta, can check them. They are also able to manage most of the tier's users of the most common Bug-type attack: U-turn. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Drilbur softens up foes for Inkay, making it easier to sweep. Entry hazards also break Sturdy, enabling Inkay to run through Pokemon such as Magnemite and Tirtouga. Ghost-type Pokemon have an easy time switching into Inkay, as the move it most commonly locks itself into is Superpower. Thus, a Pursuit trapper such as Stunky, Pawniard, or Houndour can remove Ghost-types, allowing Inkay to use Superpower without fear of giving foes such as Gastly and Pumpkaboo a free switch.</p>"

      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room lets Inkay utilize its naturally low Speed to set up and sweep; it's one of the only Trick Room setters that can do so. Knock Off is Inkay's most powerful STAB move and removes foes' items, allowing Inkay to cripple its counters. Superpower allows Inkay to acquire Attack and Defense boosts while crushing foes such as Ferroseed and Pawniard. Psycho Cut hits threats such as Timburr, Mienfoo, Trubbish, and Spritzee, KOing them after a few boosts.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With 0 Speed IVs and a Brave nature, Inkay reaches 8 Speed and is able to outspeed almost every Pokemon in the tier under Trick Room. The aforementioned Brave nature and 244 Attack EVs maximize Inkay's offensive potential, enabling it to sweep after it receives a few boosts from Superpower. The remainder of the EVs are invested in Inkay's bulk, the majority in Special Defense, as Inkay is able to bolster its Defense with Superpower. Berry Juice is Inkay's means of recovery, allowing it to shrug off small hits as it boosts with Superpower.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Inkay can set up Trick Room for its teammates on a Trick Room team or for itself to sweep teams late-game, particularly once opposing Fairy-types are beaten. It should generally avoid setting up on anything that might have Taunt or U-turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Inkay works well on Trick Room teams, but the fact that it can set up and sweep independently means it has use outside of full Trick Room teams. If Inkay is not being used on a full Trick Room team, then Pursuit trappers for beating opposing Ghost-types, entry hazard setters, and Pokemon that resist Fairy-type moves are good teammates. Teammates that can support Inkay on a Trick Room team include Spritzee, Porygon, and Pumpkaboo, as they are bulky enough to take the attacks directed at Inkay. Other slow, hard-hitting Pokemon such as Cubone, Clamperl, and Cranidos can help Inkay demolish teams with Trick Room up.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With access to the unique combination of Tough Claws and Shell Smash, Binacle is a very capable sweeper. When given a Choice Scarf or Choice Band, it can also perform as a revenge killer or wallbreaker, respectively. Along with these great assets, Binacle has a number of powerful STAB moves that add to its offensive potential. However, a Water / Rock typing leaves Binacle weak to several common attacking types and forms of priority. In some ways, it is outclassed as a Shell Smash sweeper by Tirtouga, and it lacks power when running a Choice Scarf. Despite these problems, Binacle remains a powerful threat that earns itself a place on many teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sniper could be used over Tough Claws on a gimmicky Scope Lens set for a Stone Edge that always lands a critical hit, but the boost in power that Tough Claws gives is generally preferred. X-Scissor could be used to hit Slowpoke, but even at +2 Attack it will never OHKO, and it is useless outside of this. Shadow Claw also hits Slowpoke hard, but likewise has little other use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Most Fighting-types are bulky enough to tank unboosted hits from Binacle and can KO it back with their strong STAB attacks. Timburr and Croagunk both have access to priority, making them even more threatening.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Foongus and Ferroseed can tank a Razor Shell and KO Binacle with a STAB Grass-type attack. Ferroseed completely walls the Choice Scarf set, but it will be OHKOed by a +2 Cross Chop from the Shell Smash set.</p> <p><strong>Status Inflicters</strong>: Being a physical attacker, Binacle is rendered useless by burns, so be careful against foes with Flame Body or Will-O-Wisp. Cottonee can lock Binacle into Shell Smash and OHKO with Giga Drain. Slowpoke can cripple Binacle with Thunder Wave and wear it down with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Mach Punch and Aqua Jet can take out the Shell Smash and Choice Scarf sets, especially if Binacle is weakened or at -1 defenses.</p> <p><strong>Fast Attackers</strong>: The Choice Band set has terrible speed. It is easily outsped, and often just a fast attacker can take Binacle down.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash boosts Binacle's power to sky-high levels. Razor Shell is the main move, hitting like a truck after Tough Claws and Shell Smash boosts. Cross Chop sets Binacle apart from Tirtouga by helping it get past Ferroseed, something that Tirtouga cannot do. Earthquake hits Croagunk, which could impede Binacle otherwise. Stone Edge is a good secondary STAB that can be used over Earthquake. Poison Jab can be used if Fairy-types such as Cottonee present a serious threat to your team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize Binacle's sweeping potential and allow it to hit 30 Attack and 28 Speed after a Shell Smash, while also slightly increasing its bulk. An Adamant nature maximizes Attack while still allowing Binacle to outspeed everything necessary. Eviolite lets Binacle survive Croagunk's Vacuum Wave at -1; if carrying Earthquake, Binacle would be able to KO back easily as well. Berry Juice gives Binacle a means of recovering HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avoid setting up too early. Binacle functions best in the mid- to late-game, when its major checks have been KOed or weakened considerably. Binacle has ample setup opportunities on Pokemon such as Vullaby, Trubbish, and Fletchling, and is best brought in after either a teammate goes down or on a weak or resisted hit. After setting up, spam Razor Shell to smash through the opposing team, since it is the most reliable of Binacle's moves. If a Pokemon that resists Razor Shell is brought in, simply use the appropriate coverage move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>First and foremost, Pokemon that can give Binacle chances to set up are the most important teammates. Cottonee in particular is a fantastic teammate, as it has incredible synergy with Binacle as well as access to moves such as Encore and Memento, which grant ample setup opportunities. Gothita is another excellent teammate for Binacle because of its ability to trap and KO Fighting-types and Foongus. Fighting-types can support Binacle with Knock Off while also luring out Trubbish and Fletchling, providing Binacle with good setup opportunities. Powerful Flying-type attackers, such as Fletchling and Taillow, are useful teammates since they can beat Croagunk, Binacle's best counter. Entry hazards are important to ensure certain KOs on Pokemon; as such, Trubbish, Dwebble, and Drilbur make good partners as well. Larvesta is good for checking Fighting- and Grass-type Pokemon, which easily KO Binacle with their powerful STAB attacks. Tirtouga makes a surprisingly good partner, as it appreciates how Binacle can break through Ferroseed and weaken the rest of the opposing team.</p>"

      "Switcheroo": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Switcheroo is a fantastic move as it allows Binacle to cripple common switch-ins such as Foongus while also stealing their item. To utilize Switcheroo to its full potential, it's best for Binacle to come in on Pokemon it naturally scares out, such as Fletchling or Vullaby. Razor Shell's chance to drop the opponent's Defense is amazing, as it often helps Binacle get past bulkier foes. Stone Edge provides a solid secondary STAB that hits hard. Corphish is able to run a very similar set, however Binacle is able to run coverage moves such as Earthquake and Cross Chop. Earthquake gives Binacle the ability to break through Croagunk, which would otherwise completely wall it, while Cross Chop provides Binacle with a better means of dealing with Ferroseed. Poison Jab could be used to hit Cottonee, but it hits little else.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs maximize Binacle's Attack and Speed, while also slightly increasing its bulk. If using a Choice Band, Adamant is the recommended nature to hit as hard as possible. With a Choice Scarf and a Jolly nature, Binacle hits 22 Speed, letting it outpace the entire unboosted metagame.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switcheroo is Binacle's biggest niche and is the main reason for using it. Binacle's item decides its role on the team. Choice Band Binacle functions as a wallbreaker, while Choice Scarf Binacle acts as a revenge killer. Without Eviolite, Binacle's defensive capabilities are incredibly underwhelming. As such, switching it in on predicted switches, weak resisted hits, or after one of your Pokemon has fainted is important.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Binacle appreciates teammates that can deal with Fighting-types; in this regard, Taillow, Croagunk, and Fletchling are all good partners. Fighting-types also make good teammates, as they can help beat the Steel-types that can wall Binacle. Mienfoo in particular is incredibly useful, as removing items such as Eviolite with Knock Off helps Binacle clean up late-game. Entry hazard setters such as Drilbur, Dwebble, Trubbish, and Ferroseed help net KOs, with Trubbish having the best synergy with Binacle. Sweepers such as Scraggy, Carvanha, and Tirtouga appreciate the support Binacle provides. Spritzee has decent synergy with Binacle and can keep it healthy with Wish + Aromatherapy support. Ponyta and Larvesta can spread burns to weaken opponents and also beat the Grass-types that cause Binacle so much trouble.</p>"

  "Skrelp": {
    "overview": "<p>Skrelp's STAB moves have good coverage and are resisted by few Pokemon, making it a great offensive Pokemon. Its decent bulk and typing, which gives it eight resistances, allow it to survive many hits with ease. Also, its ability Adaptability lets it hit harder. However, Skrelp is weak to common types, such as Ground and Electric; it also has a low Speed stat and a small movepool. Furthermore, its only form of recovery is the unreliable Rest, making it reliant on Wish support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb can be used on the offensive set for more power, but causes Skrelp to take recoil damage. Choice Specs can also be used on the offensive set for more power without recoil, but at the cost of being Choice-locked into one move. Thunderbolt can also be used to hit opposing Skrelp, Frillish, and Tentacool, which otherwise wall Skrelp, for super effective damage. A physical set with Waterfall and Gunk Shot can also be considered to hit special walls.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Diglett and Drilbur can easily KO Skrelp; Diglett can trap it, but it can be forced out by the threat of a Water-type STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Chinchou, Magnemite and Elekid threaten Skrelp with their Electric-type STAB moves, though the RestTalk set has enough bulk to survive their hits.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Abra and Gothita can damage Skrelp with any of their STAB moves, and Gothita can trap it, though Skrelp's powerful STAB moves might prove to be problematic.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon with a high Special Defense stat, such as Munchlax and Mantyke, can take Skrelp's hits with much ease.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Skrelp's STAB Moves</strong>: As long as Skrelp doesn't carry Hidden Power Fire, Ferroseed counters it. Croagunk also counters Skrelp, though Hidden Power Psychic is problematic for it. Skrelp checks itself, as it is resistant to its STAB moves, though it fears Hidden Power Psychic. Bulky Water-types can survive hits from Skrelp with much ease; examples include Frillish, which is immune to Water-type moves thanks to Water Absorb, and Tentacool, which, thanks to its typing, resists both of Skrelp's STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sludge Wave is the main STAB move, as it is very powerful and boosted by Adaptability. Sludge Bomb is also a viable alternative to Sludge Wave; however, while Sludge Bomb has a higher chance to inflict poison, it is often not worth using, because it cannot hit Chespin and might poison a Pokemon that would be crippled more by a burn. Hydro Pump, the most powerful STAB move on the set, is also boosted by Adaptability. Hidden Power Fire allows Skrelp to heavily damage Steel-types, which are immune to Poison-type moves; it is primarily used to KO Ferroseed, which resists both of Skrelp's STAB moves. Having Hidden Power Psychic allows Skrelp to OHKO Croagunk, which would otherwise counter Skrelp; it also hits other Skrelp for super effective damage. Scald is another 100% accurate STAB move, can be used when Hydro Pump's accuracy is not reliable, and has a 30% chance to burn the foe. Toxic Spikes can be used instead of Scald to provide chip damage that is useful for breaking Focus Sashes and Sturdy, wearing down walls, and putting a timer on opposing sweepers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread maximizes Skrelp's damage output while hitting Eviolite numbers. Adaptability boosts the power of Skrelp's STAB moves, and a Modest nature increases Skrelp's Special Attack. The Speed EVs allow Skrelp to outspeed Pokemon such as Spritzee and Hippopotas.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Skrelp can easily switch into moves that it resists, thanks to its bulk. Scald should be used early-game to burn and wear down Skrelp's checks. Ferroseed and Croagunk should be hit on the switch, as they are not always OHKOed by any of Skrelp's moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sticky Web support lets Skrelp outspeed and KO Pokemon that would usually be faster than it. Hazard support can be useful to allow Skrelp to attain KOes more easily. Skrelp has good synergy with Fighting-types, such as Mienfoo and Timburr, as it can easily KO Fairy- and Poison-types, which are troublesome for them. Skrelp works well with Drilbur too, as Drilbur is immune to Electric-type moves, which Skrelp is weak to, can set Stealth Rock up, and can easily KO Croagunk, Skrelp's main counter. Pokemon that can deal with Abra, such as Stunky and Pawniard, are also good partners to Skrelp. Pokemon that are immune to Ground-type moves, such as Archen and Vullaby, and Pokemon that resist or are immune to Electric-type moves, such as Drilbur and Pumpkaboo, also make for good partners. Support Pokemon such as Spritzee, which has access to Wish and Aromatherapy, are also useful to allow Skrelp to stay healthy.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rest is Skrelp's only form of recovery; it cures it of status and fully restores its health. Sleep Talk allows Skrelp to attack while asleep. Scald is boosted by Adaptability and has a high chance to burn the foe. Though Sludge Bomb can be used in place of it, Sludge Wave is used, as it has a lower chance of poisoning a foe that would be crippled more by a burn and is able to hit Chespin.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Adaptability boosts the power of Skrelp's STAB moves. The HP and defensive investment in conjunction with Eviolite allow Skrelp to take many hits with ease. The Speed EVs increase Skrelp's Speed stat by one, allowing it to outspeed Spritzee and Hippopotas, and a Bold nature allows it to take physical moves better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Skrelp can be used as a status absorber thanks to Rest. It is a good mixed wall and can deal with Fighting- and Fairy-types, common Pokemon in LC, thanks to Adaptability.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Thanks to its ability to KO Fairy-types with ease, Skrelp is a great partner to Fighting-types, such as Mienfoo and Timburr. Drilbur makes for a good partner thanks to its immunity to Electric-type moves and ability to set up Stealth Rock, as well as its ability to KO Croagunk, Skrelp's main counter. Pokemon that can easily take on Abra, such as Stunky and Pawniard, also make for good partners to Skrelp. Pokemon that are immune to Ground-type moves, such as Archen and Vullaby, are good partners; in particular, Vullaby is immune to two of Skrelp's weaknesses, Psychic and Ground, while Skrelp resists two of Vullaby's weaknesses, Fairy and Ice. Pokemon that resist or are immune to Electric-type moves, such as Drilbur and Pumpkaboo, are also good partners.</p>"

  "Clauncher": {
    "overview": "<p>Clauncher has solid bulk across the board that works well alongside U-turn, making for a bulky Water-type pivot. Although Clauncher has low Speed, it also has STAB priority in Aqua Jet, something that not many other Water-types are able to boast. However, Clauncher still struggles immensely to stand out in a tier packed with other Water-types, including Chinchou, Tirtouga, and Omanyte. Chinchou is Clauncher's greatest competition, as it fills the role of a bulky Water-type pivot arguably better than Clauncher does. Mega Launcher seems neat, but Clauncher lacks the moves its evolution has, most notably Aura Sphere and Dark Pulse. Though Clauncher has Aqua Jet, it's not very powerful and Clauncher's low Speed can still be easily exploited. Furthermore, Clauncher's offenses are quite lacking, and its lower Special Defense stat makes it easier for foes to prey upon both of its weaknesses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Clauncher has access to coverage moves ranging from Rock Slide and Flash Cannon to various Hidden Powers, all of which have their uses. Generally, though, it's often best to stick to the coverage on the listed set because it achieves the maximum coverage possible. However, Hidden Power Fire is of notable mention because it can blast past Ferroseed. Hidden Power Grass is also an option to hit Chinchou, but Chinchou usually avoids the 2HKO, making it not worthwhile. While it might seem odd, running Hidden Power Psychic is viable to hit Croagunk. Solely physical or solely special sets could be used, but Clauncher is mainly outclassed by Carvanha, Tirtouga, and Corphish as a physical attacker and by Chinchou, Staryu, Clamperl, and Omanyte as a special attacker. Sludge Wave muscles past Chespin, but Ice Beam hits it regardless and Poison-type moves have poor coverage. Mixed sets with more investment in Speed EVs or a Choice Scarf equipped are options but once again, Clauncher is outclassed by Omanyte and other Water-types in these roles: Clauncher's edge as a pivot lies in its bulk, which it must forfeit if it invests in Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Special attacks from the likes of Abra and Gastly take advantage of Clauncher's low Special Defense. However, both of these Pokemon must watch out for Aqua Jet and dislike switching directly into Clauncher. It's also important to note that because Clauncher has access to U-turn, it can usually pivot out of its counters.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Chinchou can beat Clauncher quite easily because of its Electric-type STAB moves and ability to take all of Clauncher's attacks. The only move it has to worry about is the very uncommon Hidden Power Grass, but even that is stomached by bulkier sets. Magnemite is also a counter because it easily KOes Clauncher with its Electric-type attacks and doesn't mind Clauncher's attacks much.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types resist Clauncher's STAB moves and can KO it in return with their own STAB attacks: Foongus shrugs off Ice Beam and keeps itself healthy via Regenerator, while Ferroseed punishes U-turn with Iron Barbs.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Clauncher is very prone to being worn down by entry hazards, status, and various attacks because of its lack of recovery. Clauncher is susceptible to all entry hazards and statuses as well, so it really has to be careful.</p> <p><strong>Bulkier Pokemon</strong>: Bulkier Pokemon, often carrying Eviolite, are able to stomach Clauncher's hits quite easily. These Pokemon include Porygon and Spritzee, which can comfortably take all of Clauncher's attacks and recover health via Recover and Wish, respectively. Croagunk shrugs off all of Clauncher's attacks and recovers health when switching into its Water-type STAB moves thanks to Dry Skin. However, not all of these Pokemon can actually do a lot to Clauncher in return other than take advantage of its lack of recovery to slowly wear it down, and Clauncher can just use U-turn to pivot out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is a useful move because it punishes switch-ins with its high burn chance backed by decent power. Alternatively, Water Pulse receives a boost from Mega Launcher, which amplifies its power to the same strength as Surf, and has an added chance of confusion. Aqua Jet is a decent STAB priority move with the ability to pick off weakened foes and somewhat mitigate Clauncher's low Speed. Ice Beam hits frailer Grass-types and is able to OHKO Fletchling after Stealth Rock. Sludge Bomb is an option to hit Grass-types and Fairy-types, most notably Cottonee, as well, but the coverage against Flying-types that Ice Beam provides is much more useful to Clauncher. U-turn allows Clauncher to pivot out of its counters; it's not used primarily for its power or coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With the given EV spread and Eviolite, Clauncher's bulk is boosted to a solid spread of 21 / 24 / 21. This bulk can only be achieved with Eviolite; thus, Berry Juice is not advised. A Relaxed nature lowers Clauncher's Speed to ensure that its U-turn to pivot into foes is slower and thus almost always a safe move. 100 Defense EVs and 172 Special Defense EVs alongside a Sassy nature could be used to let Clauncher take on special attackers, but Clauncher should focus on taking on physical attacks because its weaknesses are primarily special. 132 Special Attack EVs give Clauncher a two-point boost to its Special Attack, making its attacks stronger.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Clauncher should be used as a pivot to come in, take hits, and then use U-turn to switch into a counter to the opposing Pokemon. U-turn should be played smartly, as a well-timed U-turn can easily get Clauncher out of a risky situation; this is most effective when used on predicted switches. Scald should be your main attack, as thanks to its high chance to burn it dissuades physical attackers. Because Clauncher lacks reliable recovery and is susceptible to all forms of entry hazards, be careful about switching Clauncher in and out too much because it will get worn down very quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Removing entry hazards is crucial to Clauncher's success; Drilbur, Staryu, Archen, and Vullaby are able to do so effectively. This is because Clauncher switches a lot and will thus get worn down extremely quickly if entry hazards are up. Forming a VoltTurn core with Clauncher is a good idea because as a Water-type, it naturally fits into these cores. Larvesta and Mienfoo also have U-turn, while Magnemite has Volt Switch. Chinchou stands out as a partner because it fits well in a VoltTurn core and provides Heal Bell support, along with having decent synergy with Clauncher. Cleric support from the likes of Spritzee and Lickitung is appreciated because Clauncher lacks reliable recovery and is worn down quickly by status, entry hazards, and just generally switching into attacks. Partners that can take on Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon for Clauncher, such as Foongus and Magnemite, are helpful. Frailer sweepers, such as Abra and Gastly, appreciate Clauncher's ability to stomach hits for them and pivot into them with a slow U-turn.</p>"

  "Helioptile": {
    "overview": "<p>Being an Electric-type in LC means two things: you'll have to compete with Chinchou, and you're more or less bothered by all the Ground-types. At first, Helioptile looks like it's a massively inferior Chinchou that hits less hard, but underneath you'll see a paralyzing move in Glare, which can hit Ground-types and just about anything else as long as they aren't an Electric-type or have Limber. You'll also see a great momentum move in U-turn, which allows it to get past being trapped by Ground-types. Lastly, it's immune to Water-type moves, making it an excellent switch-in on Water-types akin to Croagunk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Helioptile still has Volt Switch in its arsenal and can run it along side Hidden Power Ground and Surf to catch all problems. However, you miss out on escaping. Dual Screens would be a fantastic defensive application because it can also can use U-turn to get out of unfavorable situations, but Helioptile's longevity is an issue. Quick Attack alongside Surf is able to break Sash Diglett as well as net a few extra priority-based KOs. Other special attacking moves include Dark Pulse, which would do well against Ghost-types, yet Thunderbolt outdamages it; while Signal Beam which would help versus Dark-, and Grass-types. However the more common Grass-types that have a secondary typing in LC resist Bug so it's not the best attacking option. Other item options include Life Orb to supplement Helioptile's damage and Berry Juice to help Helioptile survive more than a few hits.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Chinchou and Magnemite not only resist Helioptile's STAB, but they are both immune to being paralyzed by Glare; however, they both fear Hidden Power Ground to an extent.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Though Diglett and Drilbur are both heavily damaged by Surf, the former outspeeds while the latter ties with Helioptile and can OHKO it with Earthquake. However, on the switch in, they can be paralyzed and left for a better equipped teammate.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Mienfoo and Timburr are somewhat resilient to Helioptile's meager attacks and can deal massive damage back with Drain Punch. While the former is bothered by paralysis, the latter would love to receive an attack boost from Glare thanks to Guts.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Dual-typed Grass-types such as Cottonee, Pumpkaboo, Ferroseed, and Foongus all resist Helioptile's common move choices.</p> <p><strong>Clerics</strong>: Fairy-type clerics such as Snubbull and Spritzee do not mind Helioptile's attacks so much and can also eliminate the paralysis that it's spreading.</p>",

      "Paralysis Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set allows for all of Helioptile's good qualities to shine all at once. Glare sets things in motion, providing paralysis support and statusing almost everything in sight. U-turn is used to simply escape Ground-types and other Electric-types to switch in an appropriate check. Thunderbolt hits somewhat comfortably off of Helioptile's meager Special Attack. Surf and Hidden Power Ground are both present to aim for Helioptile's common switch-ins. Surf hits Ground-types and covers Rock- and Fire-types while Hidden Power Ground hits Electric-types such as Chinchou and Magnemite.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs are to raise Helioptile's defenses to 12 to help it take an unresisted hit a bit better than if it was uninvested. Max Speed allows it to tie with a majority of the metagame. Timid nature may lower Attack, but U-turn isn't on this set to deal damage, it's to serve the purpose of helping you deal with Ground-types. There's minimal investment in HP to bump it up to 21. And lastly, the rest is dumped into Special Attack to give a little kick to Helioptile's attacks. Note that the EVs shouldn't change when using Hidden Power Ground.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Helioptile should come in on Water-type attacks and then punish the opposition with Glare or Thunderbolt. Surf and U-turn can be used to punish an opposing Ground-type switching in. Otherwise, if it's something you're not able to handle, U-turn into an appropriate check or counter.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Being partly a Normal-type, Helioptile cannot deal with the pressure from Fighting-types. A Fairy-type such as Snubbull can act as your liaison, soaking up hits, and healing statuses Helioptile might receive, and in return Helioptile's able to slow down more annoying threats and help Snubbull break them down. As a VoltTurn Pokemon, Helioptile greatly appreciates some entry hazard control to keep it with as much health as possible and to wear down threats. Drilbur and Archen can both rid the field of entry hazards and set their own as well as deal hefty amounts of damage if needed. Next, enemy Electric-types usually get free damage and a free switch-in if you're utilizing Glare too much. A Ground-type such Diglett can trap and KO them and open the pathway to a more manageable battle. Finally, VoltTurn partners can help shift the momentum in your favor. Bring out Mienfoo to handle bulky walls that need Knocked Off or utilize Fletchling to break apart Grass-types. Chinchou can act as a cleric while Larvesta can bother an annoying Fighting-type.</p>"

  "Tyrunt": {
    "overview": "<p>Tyrunt's unique Rock / Dragon typing makes it an interesting choice in Little Cup. It has the right tools and stats to be an annoyance to the opposing team or a dangerous sweeper with access to Dragon Dance and powerful STAB moves. Additionally, its ability Sturdy is particularly useful in Little Cup in tandem with Berry Juice. Tyrunt also counters some of Little Cup's most dangerous Pokemon in Flying-types. Sadly, common types such as Ground, Fighting, and Fairy pose a major hindrance to Tyrunt. Also, Tyrunt faces competition as a Stealth Rock setter from Archen and defensive Tirtouga, whereas Shell Smash users such as Tirtouga normally outclass it as a sweeper. However, Tyrunt's great movepool and typing allow it to be a threat when given the right support, and it notably has access to many coverage moves such as Iron Tail and Superpower to deal with its own checks or open holes in the opposing team for other sweepers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf Tyrunt can be used to revenge kill a large portion of the metagame with Outrage and Stone Edge, although it isn't highly recommended, as Tyrunt gets its major perks from its wide coverage, and it wouldn't benefit much from holding a Choice item. Rock Polish is a worse option than Dragon Dance, as Tyrunt doesn't need all that Speed, whereas it does need the Attack boost. A defensive set with Rest and Sleep Talk can increase Tyrunt's longevity, although it loses many coverage options. There are many good EV spreads for this set that hit Eviolite numbers, such as 212 HP / 220 Def / 76 SpD, 52 HP / 220 Def / 36 SpD, and 212 HP / 60 Def / 236 SpD; all of them should be used in conjunction with an Impish nature. These spreads are interchangeable and aim to maximize Tyrunt's overall bulk. Iron Head and Iron Tail hit Fairy-types, with the former being more accurate but slightly weaker. Roar is an alternative to Dragon Tail that can phaze Fairy-types, but it doesn't deal damage. Ice Fang can be used to threaten Drilbur with super effective damage, but it doesn't give great coverage besides that. Thunder Fang can be used alongside Strong Jaw to hit specific Water-types such as Staryu and Shellder for super effective damage. Substitute can be used on the Dragon Dance set to absorb status moves aimed at Tyrunt, although it causes the loss of a coverage move. Lum Berry can be used as a one-time safety net against status moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull threaten Tyrunt with their super effective STAB moves while being immune to Tyrunt's Dragon STAB moves. Cottonee in particular can be troublesome, as it can make Tyrunt setup bait with Encore and Memento. While Fairy-types should watch out for Iron Tail, this move still doesn't always pick up a 2HKO on Snubbull and Spritzee.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Hippopotas and Drilbur deal heavy damage to Tyrunt with super effective STAB moves and possess the bulk necessary to threaten both sets. Drilbur can hit through Sturdy thanks to Mold Breaker and remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin; other bulky Ground-types, such as Hippopotas, can tank a few hits and retaliate with STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Strong Fighting-types such as Timburr, Mienfoo, Pancham, and Scraggy all give Tyrunt major trouble. They can easily check the Dragon Dance set if it lacks Zen Headbutt by damaging and healing at the same time with a super effective Drain Punch or removing Tyrunt's item with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: While it should be wary of Earthquake, Magnemite with Sturdy can switch in on anything as long as it has not taken any prior damage, and it can threaten Tyrunt with Flash Cannon. Pawniard threatens the Stealth Rock set if it lacks Brick Break, and Choice Scarf variants outspeed +1 Tyrunt and can remove its item or heavily damage it with Knock Off and Iron Head. Lastly, Ferroseed only has to watch out for a Strong Jaw set with Fire Fang, as it's able to take any other attack, punish Outrage thanks to Iron Barbs, and neuter Tyrunt's Speed with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Pokemon such as Porygon, Foongus, and Pumpkaboo can all survive a hit from +1 Tyrunt and retaliate with an annoying status move. Porygon can slow it down with Thunder Wave, whereas Foongus has access to both Spore and Stun Spore. Pumpkaboo can cripple Tyrunt with Will-O-Wisp, making it much weaker.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance allows Tyrunt to outspeed the whole unboosted metagame after a boost, as well as increasing its Attack to a more threatening level. Stone Edge is a very powerful STAB move able to hit Flying-types super effectively and deal heavy damage to any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, although its accuracy is certainly a downfall. Rock Slide is a more accurate alternative for this slot, also featuring a nice 30% flinch chance. Outrage is the strongest STAB move Tyrunt has access to, although it doesn't add much coverage. Earthquake is particularly useful on this set, as it hits Steel-types such as Pawniard and Magnemite super effectively, complementing Tyrunt's coverage. Zen Headbutt can be used to hit bulky Fighting-types, such as Mienfoo and Timburr, super effectively, but those should have already been weakened before you attempt to set up. Dragon Claw can be used over Outrage in order not to lock Tyrunt into the same move, though it's very weak and underwhelming. Another coverage move such as Fire Fang, which deals with Ferroseed; Superpower, which deals with both Porygon and Pawniard; or Iron Tail for Fairy-types can be used as well based on team's needs.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread alongside a Jolly nature allows Tyrunt to reach 15 Speed while still maximizing its Attack. A Jolly nature is preferred in order to outspeed 14 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Gothita and Modest Magnemite after a Dragon Dance. The remaining EVs are put into Special Defense to increase Tyrunt's overall bulk. Sturdy is particularly useful to have Tyrunt survive at least one hit if at full health, granting the chance to get a +1 boost. Strong Jaw helps in case Tyrunt carries biting moves. Berry Juice works well in tandem with Sturdy, as it restores 20 HP, thus getting advantage of Sturdy once again. 23 HP IVs lower Tyrunt's HP stat to 21 in order to completely heal after the activation of Berry Juice. Eviolite can be used to better check Flying-types like Fletchling as well as set up much more easily versus some bulky attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tyrunt should be brought into the field only after a Pokemon gets KOed; it shouldn't be directly switched into attacks, except particular scenarios in which it doesn't get weakened that much, because Sturdy getting broken notably reduces its longevity. Entry hazards should be removed as well before attempting to sweep because they would break Sturdy as well. It is recommended, unless Tyrunt carries any particular coverage move, not to set up until its counters have been KOed or at least weakened with item removal. Tyrunt must be wary of status moves, as burn and poison break Sturdy, and paralysis prevents it from sweeping the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gothita is a great partner, as it can eliminate opposing Fighting-types, such as Mienfoo and Timburr, that would otherwise resist Tyrunt's attacks and retaliate with a powerful STAB move. Gothita also helps weaken bulky Pokemon by Tricking them a useless Choice Scarf. Unexpected lures, such as Fighting-types with Poison Jab and Sludge Bomb Diglett, are particularly helpful to shut down Fairy-types. Entry hazard support, especially Spikes from the likes of Dwebble, Ferroseed, Trubbish, and Drilbur, is greatly appreciated, as it shuts down opposing Sturdy + Berry Juice combinations and breaks Focus Sashes, as well as weakening switch-ins. Entry hazard removers, such as Drilbur and Staryu, allow Tyrunt to switch in without taking any damage that would break Sturdy.</p>"

      "Stealth Rock Phazer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thanks to its typing and ability, Tyrunt is a good setter of Stealth Rock. Dragon Tail is a STAB move used to punish switch-ins; it works especially well with Stealth Rock to get chip damage on whatever Pokemon is sent in. Stone Edge is one of Tyrunt's strongest STAB moves; alternatively, Rock Tomb provides a useful Speed drop, so it might be a reliable alternative in some cases. Rock Slide can also be used for more accuracy and a 30% flinch chance. Earthquake provides coverage against Steel-types and Croagunk, whereas Brick Break can be used to deal with Pawniard. Fire Fang can be used to hit Ferroseed super effectively, while Zen Headbutt can be used to weaken Fighting-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread alongside a Jolly nature provides 12 Speed, which is helpful to outpace Pokemon with 17 Speed, such as Mienfoo and Drilbur, after Rock Tomb. The remaining EVs are put into HP, Special Defense, and Defense to maximize Tyrunt's bulk. Sturdy allows Tyrunt to survive any hit if it is at full health, ensuring Stealth Rock will be on the opposing side of the field. Strong Jaw is a good alternative as well if used in conjunction with Fire Fang. Berry Juice works well in tandem with Sturdy, as it restores 20 HP after Tyrunt is heavily damaged, thus restoring Sturdy. For this purpose, Tyrunt's HP IVs are lowered to 23 in order to get exactly 21 HP. Eviolite can be used to better check Flying-types such as Fletchling and Doduo and other attackers such as Aipom; in this case you don't need to lower Tyrunt's HP IVs. A faster EV spread of 204 Atk / 76 SpD / 212 Spe alongside a Jolly nature can be used as well if you prefer investing into Speed rather than bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tyrunt has very high physical bulk, so it should be used to wall Normal- or Flying-types and take that opportunity to set up Stealth Rock or shuffle the opposing team with Dragon Tail if it's already up. Tyrunt can be used as a lead thanks to its Sturdy + Berry Juice combination, although it must be wary of opposing leads, such as Mold Breaker Drilbur, that can easily beat it. Tyrunt lacks a reliable form of recovery, except for the single-use Berry Juice, so it should be played carefully in case it needs to switch in multiple times throughout the match to keep Stealth Rock up. Try to keep Tyrunt free from status ailments because they would further hinder its longevity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spritzee is the obvious partner for bulky Tyrunt, as it can switch into Fighting-type attacks and Knock Off, keep Tyrunt alive with Wish throughout the match, and eliminate status thanks to Aromatherapy. Tyrunt also resists Poison-type attacks aimed at Spritzee; however, they both need to be wary of Steel-types. Magnemite and Ferroseed can tank the Steel- and Fairy-type attacks aimed at Tyrunt, while Tyrunt can absorb Fire-type attacks for them. Pawniard can deter Defoggers from removing entry hazards. Pumpkaboo-XL is immune to Fighting-type moves and resist Ground-type moves while also being able to spinblock and keep Stealth Rock up against Drilbur and Staryu. Ferroseed and Dwebble can effectively set up Spikes, whereas Skrelp has access to Toxic Spikes. Foongus punishes Fairy-, Ground-, and Water-types, all of which heavily threaten Tyrunt, and can use Spore to put annoying switch-ins to sleep. In return, Tyrunt can switch into Flying- and Fire-type moves aimed at Foongus. Pokemon that really benefit from entry hazards and can deal with Fighting-types in return, such as Abra and Gastly, are great teammates.</p>"

  "Goomy": {
    "overview": "<p>Goomy has a good Special Defense stat and is the only Pokemon in Little Cup with access to Gooey; this is an especially nice ability in Little Cup due to an increased emphasis on Speed tiers. Goomy also has access to Sap Sipper, which lets it take on threats such as Snivy and Bellsprout with ease. It is also one of the very few defensive Dragon-type Pokemon in Little Cup, granting it key resistances to Fire, Water, and Grass. However, poor overall base stats keep Goomy from really shining, and its lackluster Defense holds it back from making full use of Gooey. Goomy is unable to hit very hard off of its poor base 55 Special Attack and thus grants many sweepers the opportunity to set up against it. Goomy also lacks any reliable recovery moves, forcing it to rely on Rest to consistently perform well defensively. Finally, the presence of powerful Fairy-types such as Spritzee on many teams often makes Goomy a liability.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Goomy also has access to Sap Sipper, which can be used in place of Gooey if your team is weak to Pokemon such as Snivy; however, this removes Goomy's most important niche. Goomy can use Hidden Power Fire to lure Ferroseed, but it will not OHKO, and that moveslot is better filled by the two options already presented. With access to Hydration and Rain Dance, Goomy can forgo Sleep Talk to work as a manual rain setter on a rain team. Goomy has a decent Attack stat and can make use of physical attacks such as Outrage and Iron Tail in conjunction with Sap Sipper, but it is heavily outclassed by other more powerful attackers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Even with Sludge Wave for coverage, Goomy struggles to deal with bulky Fairies, such as Spritzee and Snubbull, that can hit it hard with super effective STAB attacks. Note, however, that Sludge Wave is a guaranteed OHKO on Cottonee if Stealth Rock is up.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types have little difficulty coming in on Goomy even if it runs Hidden Power Fighting. Pawniard is especially threatening, as its ability, Defiant, actually grants it an Attack boost when Gooey activates.</p> <p><strong>Regenerator</strong>: Goomy's damage output is pretty low; as such, Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Foongus can easily take a Draco Meteor then switch out and heal off the damage via Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Once again, Goomy lacks the power to break through bulky Pokemon such as Porygon that easily stomach anything Goomy can hit them with.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Goomy's low damage output lets it down once again, leaving it as setup bait for many notable setup sweepers, such as Shell Smash Omanyte and Swords Dance Fletchling.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Goomy's Draco Meteor is so powerful that two Draco Meteors will always outdamage two Dragon Pulses, even with the Special Attack drop. However, Dragon Pulse can be used over it if you foresee staying in on foes for more than two attacks. The second slot is up to you, and is selected based on what you don't want to switch in on Goomy: Sludge Wave hits incoming Fairy-types, whereas Hidden Power Fighting hits Steel-types such as Pawniard. Rest provides the recovery necessary to prolong Goomy's defensive utility. Sleep Talk keeps Goomy from being total setup bait during the two turns of sleep from Rest. However, Goomy is still setup bait for the most part due to its weak attacks and its reliance on picking the correct attacking option to do any meaningful damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed EV spread and a Bold nature maximize Goomy's Defense and bolster its Special Defense, giving it a spread of 22 / 14 / 16 before Eviolite. The extra EVs are put into Speed, as it is the only remaining stat that can be raised with 36 EVs. However, if you choose to use Hidden Power Fighting, you will have to forgo the Speed EVs with a spread of 76 HP / 240 Def / 160 SpD to maintain the same defensive stats. Eviolite raises Goomy's defenses and is preferred over Berry Juice, as Goomy both needs the increased defenses Eviolite provides to check threats such as Chinchou and already has access to Rest. It is possible to move the 76 HP EVs into Special Attack, then notably scoring a 2HKO on Spritzee with Sludge Wave. However, Goomy is then 3HKOed by attacks such as Timburr's Drain Punch and can no longer beat Snivy without Sap Sipper.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Goomy needs to be at high health to consistently stomach the physical attacks it needs to take to activate Gooey. This entails using Rest often. Goomy can also check special attackers such as Chinchou to an extent due to its naturally high Special Defense and its Dragon typing. It is usually enough for Goomy to switch in, attack once, Rest, and then switch out. Gooey is its main niche and should be used in a pivoting fashion to benefit other slower, more powerful attackers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>It's a good idea to pair Goomy with a bulky physical wall to pivot into after activating Gooey. Ponyta works well in this role, and it can help get around the Fairy-, Steel-, and Ice-types that trouble Goomy. Slow, bulky attackers such as Pancham and Skrelp appreciate the Gooey support Goomy provides; Pancham has the added benefit of beating Steel-types and luring Fairy-types with Gunk Shot, whereas Skrelp beats Fairy-types and lures Steel-types with Hidden Power Fire. Steel-types cover all of Goomy's weaknesses, whereas Goomy does well against Fire- and Fighting-type Pokemon. Magnemite is particularly good in tandem with Goomy, as it can trap and remove Steel-type Pokemon via Magnet Pull, allowing Goomy to run Sludge Wave without issue.</p>"

  "Phantump": {
    "overview": "<p>Phantump is one of only two Pokemon in the Little Cup tier with access to the ability Harvest. With this ability, Phantump has a 50% chance of recycling a used Berry, which means that Phantump can utilize Oran Berry to heal itself repeatedly. It has a wide movepool for breaking down walls, including Will-O-Wisp and Leech Seed, and its Ghost / Grass typing resists four common attacking types as well as being immune to Normal-type, Fighting-type, and powder-based moves. Unfortunately, Phantump faces a crippling weakness to Knock Off, which not only hits it for super effective damage but also removes Phantump's Berry permanently. Carrying a Berry also hampers its mediocre defenses, giving it limited opportunities to set up a Substitute due to weaknesses to five common attacking types. Its offensive options are also fairly limited, so an offensive set is difficult to use.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wood Hammer is a stronger STAB option than Horn Leech, but taking recoil is really unwelcome on both sets. Phantump can be a decent Trick Room setter, as its low Speed and high Attack make it a good user of the strategy. Other physical options such as Poison Jab and Bulldoze can be used for Fairy- and Steel-types, but they are fairly weak and don't really offer much additional coverage. Other Berries can be utilized with Harvest, such as a Lum Berry with Rest or a stat-boosting berry, however, Lum Berry is less consistent than Natural Cure and stat-boosting berries are risky as they only activate once Phantump is below half of its full health.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Knock Off Users</strong>: Pawniard, Mienfoo, and Timburr disrupt Phantump's Harvest ability by permanently removing a Berry with Knock Off. It also hits for super effective damage and can KO Phantump without Eviolite most of the time.</p> <p><strong>Pawniard</strong>: Pawniard is faster than Phantump and can KO any variant without Eviolite with Knock Off. Horn Leech and Shadow Claw barely leave a scratch on it. Eviolite Phantump is KOed by Knock Off most of the time and cannot do anything significant in return.</p> <p><strong>Timburr</strong>: Timburr doesn't fear burns thanks to its ability Guts, isn't bothered by any of Phantump's attacks, and can hit back with Knock Off or Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Cottonee and Purrloin can leave Phantump useless without its support moves by using Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Growlithe and Ponyta can heal off Leech Seed damage all day long with Morning Sun and smash Phantump with Flare Blitz, all while being immune to Will-o-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Archen and Fletchling are powerful enough to outspeed and OHKO Phantump variants without Eviolite.</p> <p><strong>Infiltrator and Sound-Based Moves</strong>: Although rare in Little Cup, Pokemon with the Infiltrator ability or a sound-based move can hit Phantump through its Substitute.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute is necessary for Phantump to avoid heavy hits and being crippled by status and Knock Off while allowing it to attack or cripple foes in safety. It also can lower Phantump's HP to a range where Oran Berry will activate. Leech Seed is useful for wearing down bulky foes while providing Phantump with recovery. Will-O-Wisp also helps wear down walls, and it also cripples physical attackers, which helps Phantump stand up to hits its mediocre Defense otherwise wouldn't. Horn Leech or Shadow Claw can be chosen as Phantump's physical attack. Horn Leech hurts Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type foes, notably Drilbur and Tirtouga, as well as providing Phantump with even more recovery, while Shadow Claw ensures it isn't walled by Grass- or Fire-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Phantump relies on using an Oran Berry alongside Harvest to heal itself and recycle the Berry. It chooses to run 196 Special Defense EVs are used with a Careful nature in order to maximize its special bulk and take hits more comfortably. 132 Defense EVs give it reasonable physical bulk and the remaining EVs are placed in HP so that it can tank some hits.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Phantump is good at wearing down walls such as Lickitung or Munchlax, that don't appreciate being seeded or burned. It can also set up a Substitute on things slower than it and proceed to whittle down their health with Leech Seed while healing itself. Phantump is also a decent spinblocker, able to hit common Rapid Spinners in the tier such as Drilbur and Staryu quite hard with Horn Leech. Phantump is frail, however, and should never stay in on a foe with Knock Off unless it is behind a Substitute, as Knock Off will remove Phantump's Berry and hit for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vulpix is a decent teammate for Phantump, as it sets up sun which makes Harvest trigger every turn. It can also fire off a sun-boosted Fire Blast to deal with foes Phantump has trouble pushing past, particularly Ferroseed. Houndour resists four of Phantump's five weaknesses and has an easier time taking out foes Phantump has weakened with Leech Seed or Will-O-Wisp. Phantump also appreciates Pokemon such as Magnemite or Chinchou to remove Flying-type foes such as Fletchling and Doduo. Archen can also take out Flying-types while also being able to set up Stealth Rock.</p>"

      "Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Horn Leech is useful for hitting foes such as Drilbur, Tirtouga, Diglett, and Chinchou for super effective damage. It also heals Phantump, which is welcome, considering it doesn't carry Leech Seed on this set. Shadow Claw is Phantump's other STAB move and is capable of OHKOing Misdreavus without Eviolite after Stealth Rock damage. Rock Slide is great defeating for Flying- and Bug-type foes, particularly Fletchling, which resists Phantump's STAB options. Substitute is a useful option for activating Oran Berry as well as giving Phantump an opening to attack behind the safety of a Substitute.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite and Natural Cure are Phantump's preferred choices on this set as Phantump hates status, so the ability to cure it by switching out is convenient. Eviolite allows Phantump with 132 Defense EVs to take a 110 Base Power Acrobatics from Adamant Fletchling, and also allows it to take a Shadow Ball from Timid Misdreavus when running 116 Special Defense EVs. 196 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature ensure Phantump's attacks hit as hard as possible. The remaining EVs are placed in HP and Speed to increase survivability and allow it to outspeed some slower foes. Oran Berry and Harvest can be used if healing is needed, but Phantump generally prefers the bulk afforded by Eviolite.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Phantump can break walls that have had their items removed and can finish off weakened foes after they've taken damage from entry hazards. It is also quite good at preserving entry hazards as it can spinblock and hit spinners such as Drilbur and Staryu for good damage with Horn Leech. However, Phantump is still frail even with Eviolite, so it should not used carelessly, especially against foes with Knock Off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Phantump appreciates an ally with Knock Off, such as Pawniard or Mienfoo, as it removes items that trouble Phantump, such as Eviolite and Berry Juice. It also really enjoys an entry hazard setter such as Tirtouga or Trubbish to soften some bulkier foes. Phantump can even benefit from Sticky Web, which enables it to outspeed some faster foes. A Baton Passer such as Torchic can also help Phantump overcome its Speed issues by passing it one or two Speed boosts. Mienfoo with Stone Edge is a great lure for Flying-types as well as being able to handle the Dark- and Steel-types Phantump can't take on. Archen is also a useful Flying-type check with access to Stealth Rock.</p>"
