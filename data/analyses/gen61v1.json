    "overview": "<p>Greninja’s great offensive Water / Dark typing, exceptional abilities in Protean and Torrent, and blistering Speed make it a great pick in the metagame, allowing it to overwhelm popular threats such as Mega Slowbro, Mega Metagross, and Heatran. This is bolstered by its large movepool, circumventing normally good checks like Mega Venusaur, Genesect, and Ferrothorn. A Substitute + Torrent set adds onto its unpredictability, empowering its offensive capabilities against Pokemon like specially defensive Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Metagross. Moreover, the benefits of not being Choice-locked allow it to deter previous checks via Taunt and Toxic, the most notable mentions being Chansey and Reflect Type Mega Latias. However, Greninja’s lackluster bulk leaves much to be desired, easily causing it to be taken out from super effective attacks and strong neutral attacks like Kyurem-B’s Outrage, Mega Gyarados’s Outrage, and Choice Specs Hoopa-U's Thunderbolt. While Greninja has impressive Speed, offensive Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf users like Kyurem-B, Genesect, and Victini outspeed it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thanks to its ability Protean, Greninja has a diverse amount of sets at its disposal. Greninja can opt to run a Choice Band set with Low Kick for Kyurem-B, Rock Tomb for Mega Charizard Y, and Gunk Shot for Fairy-types like Mega Gardevoir. However, its other sets are more useful and cover the metagame better. A set with Modest nature and a Choice Scarf can handle other Choice Scarf Pokemon like Garchomp, Genesect, Victini. Despite this, the power drop is enormous and is very niche apart from handling these Pokemon. Hidden Power Ground can defeat Magnezone but is useless apart from this. A Life Orb set can be run to have more leverage, as it is no longer Choice-locked, but it loses power compared to other sets. If using Life Orb, then Shadow Sneak can be run to avoid being hit by Hyper Beam and Close Combat from Choice-item Porygon-Z and Sawk respectively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Greninja is vulnerable to powerful STAB moves and super effective moves from faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users such as Mega Lopunny, Kyurem-B, and Victini.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon: Despite Greninja’s unpredictability, there are some Pokemon that even both of its sets struggle against like specially defensive Mega Mawile, Mega Venusaur, Hoopa-U, Chansey, and Registeel, although it should be mentioned that even Mega Venusaur struggles against the possibility of Greninja running Extrasensory.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy: Sturdy users like Golem and Crustle are especially problematic for Greninja due to their ability to tank a hit and retaliate using their strong STAB moves.</p> ",

Grass Knot can handle Mega Slowbro and Mega Swampert. Extrasensory lets Greninja deal respectable damage against Mega Venusaur and Choice Band Sawk. Dark Pulse deals with Psychic- and Ghost-types like Mega Metagross, Mega Latias, and Aegislash. Ice Beam gives Greninja amazing coverage, nailing Dragon- and Ground-types like Mega Altaria, Dragonite, Choice Band Garchomp, and Landorus-T. Hidden Power Fire is Greninja’s best option against non-Choice Scarf Genesect, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. Hidden Power Electric is effective against Mega Gyarados, being able to OHKO prior to Mega Evolving.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs allow Greninja to hit as strong and fast as possible. A Timid nature ensures Greninja can outspeed Pokemon like Mega Diancie, Terrakion, and Mega Latias. Protean gives Greninja STAB on any move, giving it extra power against the foe.</p> <h1>Strategy &amp; Support</h1> <p>Choice Specs Greninja is simple to use, as Hydro Cannon is powerful and hits most Pokemon that don’t resist it. This variant of Greninja has trouble dealing with Pokemon that can live Hydro Cannon like Kyurem-B, specially defensive Mega Charizard X, and Mega Gardevoir; because of this, you should try to avoid these Pokemon. Use Hidden Power Fire and Grass Knot on targets that usually defeat Greninja like Ferrothorn and Mega Swampert, respectively, which might be lured in. Due to its frailty, it should also avoid Choice Scarf Pokemon like Kyurem-B, Porygon-Z, Genesect, and Victini. Mega Mawile and Mega Metagross are great offensive partners that benefit from Greninja drawing in and handling bulky Water- and Fire-types such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Slowbro, and non-Endure Heatran. In return, they can handle Sturdy Pokemon like Crustle and Fighting-types such as Mega Lopunny and Sawk, as well as special walls like Chansey. A solid answer to specially defensive Mega Charizard X is appreciated, as Greninja doesn’t have sufficient firepower to handle it. Air Balloon Heatran and Crustle are all capable of taking hits from Mega Charizard X and revenge killing it. In return, Greninja can handle bulky Water-types like Mega Slowbro and Mega Swampert. Choice Band Kyurem-B is a great offensive partner, as it helps Greninja deal with unfavorable matchups such as against bulky Meloetta, Magnezone, and Hoopa-U. In return, Kyurem-B benefits from Greninja taking care of Steel-types like Air Balloon Heatran, Choice Specs Genesect, and Ferrothorn.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute is the flagship of this set, allowing Greninja to reliably defeat Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y by using it until Torrent and Petaya Berry are activated. Hydro Cannon is indispensable for this set, using its immense 150-Base Power on top of STAB, boosted by Torrent and Petaya Berry, to deal tremendous amounts of damage against non-resistant foes. Haze allows Greninja to have a favorable matchup against Flame Charge and Dragon Dance variants of Mega Charizard X as well as Calm Mind Mega Latias when utilized with Toxic. Toxic is useful against non-Rest variants of Mega Slowbro and Mega Latias. Taunt is useful for pinning down stall Pokemon like Mew and Jumpluff.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>160 Defense EVs are crucial so that Greninja can survive a Flame Charge from Mega Charizard X while using Substitute. 160 Speed EVs with a Timid nature let Greninja outspeed Mega Metagross, Mega Diancie and Jumpluff. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack to let Greninja hit as hard as possible. Petaya Berry allows Greninja to continuously use Substitute until Torrent is activated, letting it fire off a potent Hydro Cannon.</p> <h1>Strategy &amp; Support</h1> <p>Focus on Pokemon slower than Greninja that don’t resist Hydro Cannon and stall Pokemon that are weak to Taunt like Mew and Jumpluff. When against Mega Charizard X, first use Substitute so you don’t get OHKOed by Outrage; if the opposing Pokemon uses Flame Charge, proceed to use Haze to get rid of the Speed boost so you are always faster than it, and use the same method as followed until you reach 25% health, as Petaya Berry and Torrent will have activated and you can OHKO it with Hydro Cannon. Avoid Pokemon that can bypass Substitute like Mega Gardevoir, Meloetta, and Mega Altaria. Make sure not to Haze away your Petaya Berry boost, as the power drop is significant without it. This set is reliant on setting up with Substitute, so ideally having Pokemon that can deal with faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users like Mega Lopunny, Kyurem-B, and Porygon-Z make excellent partners. Therefore, Pokemon like Mega Metagross, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Heracross pair up well. In return, Greninja can deter Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y from being sent out against them. Mega Metagross in particular has excellent synergy with Greninja, as it deals with Pokemon that can bypass Substitute like Mega Gardevoir, Meloetta, and Mega Altaria. Pokemon that can handle bulky Water-types like Mega Gyarados, Rest Mega Slowbro, and Mega Blastoise complement Greninja well. Examples include Choice Band Kyurem-B, Mega Venusaur, and Serperior. In return, Greninja deals with Fire-types like Victini and Kee Berry Volcarona.</p> "

  "Dragonite": {
    "overview": "<p>With its high Attack stat and powerful STAB Outrage, Dragonite is a great choice for a physical attacker in ORAS 1v1. Its ability Multiscale supports its already great power, giving it an edge over other Dragon-types in 1v1 like Garchomp and Latios, while its typing and bulk allow it to withstand hits from some of the strongest Pokemon in the metagame like Mega Charizard Y, Porygon-Z, and Meloetta. Furthermore, thanks to its great arsenal of coverage moves, it can be tailored to take on commonly used Pokemon, including bulky Pokemon such as Heatran, Mega Tyranitar, and Diancie. Dragonite's ability to run either a Choice Band or Choice Scarf coupled with the unpredictability of its set in Team Preview lets it lure and KO all-out attackers like Greninja, Mega Lopunny, and Manaphy. However, Dragonite can be easily exploitable mainly due to being vulnerable to status effects from Pokemon like Mega Gardevoir and Mega Sableye, while others capitalize on Fake Out strategies like Mega Medicham and Mega Blastoise, which breaks Multiscale. Moreover, despite Dragonite's Attack stat being very high, it still ends up struggling against stall Pokemon like Mega Sableye, Mega Slowbro, and Kee Berry Mew as well as wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B and Mega Mawile.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Weakness Policy set can be run with 252 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature to almost always defeat Mega Metagross; it should be noted that you should use Earthquake into Extreme Speed to reliably beat it. However, this is generally useless apart from this matchup, which is why its other sets are preferred. Protect can be run with Weakness Policy to help Dragonite with Fake Out users like Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, Mega Blastoise, and Ambipom. A Choice Specs set with Hurricane, Fire Blast, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt can be run to handle physical walls like Mega Venusaur and Mega Slowbro. However, it isn't as useful as the other sets, which cover a variety of Pokemon and more significant threats. Fly can be run in order to handle Mega Heracross but is generally useless apart from this matchup.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Broken Multiscale: The main reason for using Dragonite is its ability Multiscale, and without it, Dragonite would be weaker to attacks. Pokemon that ignore Multiscale such as Mega Gyarados, Kyurem-B, and Haxorus, as well as Fake Out users like Mega Medicham and Mega Blastoise, can handle it effectively. Status inflictions can also be a good way of breaking Multiscale, with Pokemon like bulky Will-O-Wisp Mega Charizard X and Mega Gardevoir crippling it and defeating it as a result.</p> <p><strong>Stall: Stall Pokemon like Mega Sableye, Mega Slowbro, Mew, and Registeel all have enough bulk to live Dragonite's attacks and set up on it to mitigate or lower its offense capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types like Mega Mawile, Mega Altaria, and Togekiss can all tank Dragonite's attacks and cripple it with their respective moves.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy: Pokemon like Crustle, Golem, and Sawk are able to survive a hit thanks to their ability Sturdy and counteract with Counter.</p> ",

Earthquake rounds out Dragonite's coverage well, hitting most Dragon-resistant Pokemon such as Aegislash and Magnezone. Fire Punch is useful for beating Pokemon that are neutral to Earthquake like Genesect, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. Superpower is an option to reliably beat Heatran and Mega Tyranitar. Extreme Speed allows Dragonite to handle frail Pokemon like Choice Scarf Togekiss, non-Choice Specs Greninja, Jumpluff, and Smeargle. Iron Head can be used to beat Mega Diancie and stall Mega Altaria.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The key to this set is taking advantage of Dragonite's sheer power with Choice Band to break through bulky Pokemon. 216 HP EVs and 84 Defense EVs allow Dragonite to tank Choice Band Garchomp, while the HP EVs allow Dragonite to survive Choice Specs Draco Meteor from Latios and Ice Beam from Choice Specs Genesect. Multiscale is an integral part, allowing Dragonite to shine by withstanding most attacks from full HP unless against Mold Breaker users and Pokemon with substantially high super effective attacks.</p> <p>Alternatively, Dragonite can run a spread of 112 HP / 64 Atk / 248 SpD / 84 Spe with an Adamant nature to tank Choice Specs Greninja's Ice Beam and outspeed Heracross and bulky Meloetta or a spread of 168 HP / 108 Atk / 240 Def with an Adamant nature if you want to defeat Mega Lopunny.</p> <h1>Strategy &amp; Support</h1> <p>Choice Band Dragonite should mainly focus on Pokemon that lack reliable recovery and Pokemon without Intimidate such as Mega Charizard Y, Porygon-Z, Heatran, and Genesect. Ideally, it should be chosen against Pokemon such as Choice Specs Latios, Choice Band Garchomp, Meloetta, and Mega Tyranitar to withstand their strong hits with Multiscale. When against Choice Scarf Togekiss, rather than using Iron Head, it's best to use Extreme Speed, as it removes the chances of getting flinched by Air Slash. One of the biggest issues for Dragonite is Mega Gyarados, and as a result, Pokemon such as bulky Will-O-Wisp Mega Charizard Y, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Gardevoir pair well. In return, Dragonite can deal with strong special wallbreakers like Porygon-Z and Meloetta. Powerful special wallbreakers like specially defensive Mega Mawile and Choice Specs Hoopa-U synergize with Dragonite quite well thanks to their ability to handle physically defensive Pokemon like Mega Sableye and Mega Blastoise, which Dragonite struggles against. In return, Dragonite can take on specially defensive Pokemon like Diancie. As Sturdy and Counter users like Crustle, Donphan, and Golem can all take hits from Dragonite and knock it out with Counter, Mega Gyarados, while being one of Dragonite's biggest issues, can also be its greatest ally, handling them and shutting down Pokemon like Mega Slowbro, Kee Berry Mew, and Registeel with Taunt. As a result, Taunt Mega Gyarados synergizes well with Dragonite, with the latter being able to handle bulky Mega Charizard X, Ferrothorn, and Genesect. Mega Metagross can deal with problematic Dragon-, Fairy-, and Poison-types like Kyurem-B, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Venusaur and appreciates Dragonite's effectiveness against Fire-types like Heatran and Victini.</p> "

Against Greninja, if running an Adamant nature, it is better to use Outrage instead of Superpower, as it doesn't risk the possibility of Greninja running Shadow Sneak, and Outrage OHKOes Greninja anyways. On the other hand, running a Jolly nature makes Superpower the optimal choice, as Outrage isn't a reliable win condition due to the significant power drop. Keep in mind that Dragonite's bulk is considerably low and can get overwhelmed by stall and Counter Pokemon like Mega Sableye, Mew, and Crustle. Mega Gyarados is an excellent partner for Dragonite, as it can combat these threats as well as Sturdy Pokemon like Crustle and Golem for it. Mega Gyarados appreciates Dragonite's ability to handle Mega Charizard Y and Genesect. Weakness Policy Victini offensively synergizes well with Dragonite due to its ability to handle Steel-types like Mega Mawile, Mega Metagross, and Mega Aggron.

Iron Head gives Mawile an easier time against Fairy- and Poison-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Mega Venusaur while also being safer against Nasty Plot Porygon-Z. Play Rough is Mega Mawile's strongest move and is used to take down Dark- and Dragon-types such as Mega Sableye, Mega Gyarados, and Kyurem-B. Taunt is used to shut down stall Pokemon such as Jumpluff, Whimsicott, Chansey, and Charm Mega Venusaur if Mega Mawile has Iron Head. Sucker Punch makes up for Mega Mawile's terrible Speed and allows it to finish foes off that it barely can't OHKO, like Meloetta and Sturdy users like Crustle and Sawk, although Crustle and Sawk can OHKO Mega Mawile with Counter if it uses a powerful attack turn one.

Water-types like Mega Blastoise, Greninja, and Mega Gyarados pair well with Mega Mawile, since they can deal with Ground- and Fire-types as well as Mega Metagross. Fire-types such as Will-O-Wisp Mega Charizard X and Heatran can beat Magnezone, Mega Aggron, and Mega Metagross. Mega Mawile can also partner with special attackers, namely the aforementioned Greninja and Porygon-Z, since they can deal with physically defensive Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro and Mew, while Mega Mawile can threaten specially defensive Pokemon like Mega Sableye, Chansey, and Mega Tyranitar.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Garchomp's sky-high Attack stat after a Choice Band boost combined with its strong movepool and nice Speed tier makes it a premier offensive presence in the metagame. Its Speed stat allows it to just barely outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon like Mega Gardevoir, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y, which makes running Choice Scarf not much of a necessity. A useful Dragon / Ground typing that it and only a few other Pokemon possess gives it a powerful STAB Outrage and Earthquake able to take down common metagame threats like Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, non-Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, non-Metal Burst Mega Mawile, and Aegislash. This Dragon / Ground typing also has its cons, though, mainly being that Ice-type coverage is not rare in this metagame, and Garchomp can be OHKOed by most Pokemon with Ice-type moves. Though having a powerful offensive presence, there's much to be desired for with Garchomp's defensive capabilities. Almost any Pokemon holding a Choice Scarf can outspeed and KO it with ease, like Porygon-Z, Kyurem-B, Genesect, and Dragonite. It also has a hard time against threats that naturally outspeed it like Mega Lopunny and Greninja.

Earthquake provides great coverage against Steel-types such as non-Metal Burst Mega Mawile and Mega Metagross, Fire-types like Victini and Volcanion, and Rock-types like Mega Tyranitar, Diancie, and Terrakion. Poison Jab covers weak Fairy-types like Mega Gardevoir and Whimsicott. Fling in tandem Earthquake allows you to lure in and take down Air Balloon Heatran, since otherwise you'd be stuck with using an ineffective move against it. It can also help against Custap Berry Magnezone because they'd usually expect you to use Earthquake turn one. Alternatively, Fire Fang can be ran to beat Steel-types that Earthquake doesn't like Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Choice Specs Genesect. Stone Edge can also be used to catch bulky Counter Mega Charizard X off guard, since it usually stays in its base forme. An alternative to Poison Jab is Iron Tail, which can solidify the matchup against bulky Sylveon and still take on Mega Gardevoir, but it has the downside of a miss chance and loses out on the Whimsicott matchup. Rough Skin is the preferred ability, since if both Pokemon are KOed on the same turn, the Garchomp user would win, which makes it much harder for physical Pokemon to EV for Garchomp and allows it to more reliably take down Mega Charizard X, non-Metal Burst Mega Mawile, and Mega Metagross, as well as FEAR Pokemon like Aron. Choice Band maximizes Garchomp's power due to its already high Speed tier.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>252 Attack EVs maximize Garchomp's KOing capabilities. 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature let Garchomp outspeed up to base 101 Speed non-Choice Scarf Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Mega Medicham, Mega Gardevoir, Volcarona, Genesect, and Landorus-I.</p> <p>An alternative spread of 176 Atk / 80 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature can be ran to always take a Hidden Power Ice from maximum Special Attack Heatran and non-Choice Specs Magnezone, so run this when running Fling to beat all Heatran variants. This does have its downfalls, though; your reliability against Mega Mawile and bulky Mega Charizard X lessens because now you can't always OHKO them.</p> <h1>Strategy &amp; Support</h1> <p>Garchomp generally has very straightforward matchups, but avoid sending it in if you know the opponent is going to choose Mega Mawile or Mega Aggron, as though you have a type advantage, these both can take a hit and KO back with Metal Burst. Though mostly outclassed by its regular forme, watch out for Protect Mega Diancie, as it can outspeed and KO you, whereas normally you'd be able to OHKO with Earthquake. Using Fire Fang over Outrage against Crustle can give you a better chance to win against Counter variants due to the Rough Skin damage you give them. Garchomp appreciates bulky offensive teammates that can take hits from and beat hyper offensive Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Choice Specs Greninja, and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, which outspeed Garchomp and KO it with ease. This means that teammates like specially defensive Mega Charizard X and Manaphy make good teammates. In return, Garchomp can take down Occa Berry Whimsicott, offensive Mega Mawile, and Heatran. Garchomp also appreciates Steel-type teammates like Heatran, Mega Metagross, and Magnezone due to their ability to take down threatening Fairy-types that Garchomp can't already cover with its Poison-type coverage like Metal Burst Mega Mawile, Mega Altaria, and Sylveon.

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Terrakion can use a Choice Scarf for reliability versus Mega Lopunny, Mega Diancie, Greninja, Archeops, and the mirror, but the drop in attacking power without Choice Band is usually too much to justify. Choice Scarf Terrakion does not need to survive Outrage from Kyurem-B, and so it runs maximum Attack and Speed instead.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Close Combat and Stone Edge are central to Terrakion's role in ORAS 1v1. Close Combat OHKOes Kyurem-B, Porygon-Z, Heatran, and many other top Pokemon. Stone Edge OHKOes most Charizard sets, with even a slight chance to OHKO Mega Charizard X with near-maximum Defense investment. It is also useful versus Togekiss and Volcanion. Iron Head OHKOes Diancie and most Mega Gardevoir variants. To round out the set, Terrakion has several options, including Giga Impact for Mega Medicham, Aerial Ace for Mega Heracross, Poison Jab to OHKO Whimsicott, and Double Kick, which OHKOes Aggron and has a chance to OHKO Magnezone.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>With 12 HP and 36 Defense EVs, Terrakion survives Outrage from Choice Scarf Kyurem-B and OHKOes it in return. Maximum Speed is for the mirror matchup and to outspeed Pokemon with base 100 Speed, such as Charizard and Victini, as well as Greninja without a Speed-boosting nature.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Usually, Terrakion is quite straightforward to use. However, against Mega Gyarados, it must predict whether or not the opponent will choose to Mega Evolve, with Stone Edge KOing Gyarados if it does not Mega Evolve and Close Combat KOing it if it does.</p> "
