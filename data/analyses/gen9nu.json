Tera Blast lets Tera Fairy Magneton threaten Dark- and Dragon-types that check it such as Umbreon and Appletun, or it hits Ground-types that cause Magneton trouble like Whiscash and Sandaconda if it is Tera Grass.

Magneton can struggle against special walls such as Eelektross, Chansey, and Appletun, so Magneton appreciates teammates that can break these Pokemon, such as Passimian, Bruxish, and Mabosstiff. Magneton is liable to be chipped down over time by entry hazards due to its lack of recovery, so it appreciates Defoggers such as Drifblim, Lurantis, and Scyther. Additionally, Magneton does not like its Eviolite being removed by Knock Off, which makes Pokemon such as Umbreon and Qwilfish that can absorb Knock Off great partners. Magneton can also struggle versus Ground-types not threatened by Flash Cannon, like Camerupt and Whiscash, so Water- and Grass-types such as Vaporeon and Appletun make for helpful teammates.</p> "

Drain Punch hits Steel-types such as Copperajah and Terastallized Appletun that would otherwise wall Muk. Haze stops setup sweepers such as Vivillon and Calm Mind Vaporeon from setting up.

Tera Ghost is able to increase Haunter's cleaning potential by powering up Shadow Ball. Tera Fighting can be used to assist Haunter versus Pokemon such as Cacturne and Lycanroc by granting resistances to Sucker Punch and Accelerock, and it also powers up Focus Blast. Haunter has horrible bulk and cannot take even resisted hits well, so it is advised that you pair it with pivots such as Eelektross, Passimian, and Scyther.

Alternatively, Tera Ghost lets it spinblock Cryogonal and Avalugg. 56 Speed EVs allow Hisuian Qwilfish to outspeed maximum Speed Cacturne as well as neutral-nature Abomasnow and Farigiraf; Jolly allows Hisuian Qwilfish to always outspeed the latter two.</p> <p>Wallbreakers like Tauros and Mesprit benefit from Spikes weakening checks like Sandaconda and Hisuian Qwilfish that are somewhat easy to put in 2HKO range. To maximize the effect of Spikes and keep them up as long as possible, Hisuian Qwilfish appreciates help from Rotom, Cryogonal, and Articuno, which all put pressure onto Defog users like Braviary and Lurantis. Without Terastallizing, Hisuian Qwilfish folds to Sandaconda and other strong physical attackers that can switch into it like Toxicroak, Hisuian Sneasel, and both Tauros formes. To help solve this issue, Pokemon such as your own Sandaconda, Hattrem, and Drifblim can pivot into their attacks and threaten them with paralysis or burn. Hisuian Qwilfish is hindered by losing its Eviolite via Knock Off or Trick; pair it with Pokemon that can afford to lose their item such as Sandaconda, Sableye, and Sticky Hold Muk.</p> "

For the Pokemon Hisuian Sneasel can't consistently defeat like Tera Ghost Sandaconda, Qwilfish, and Sableye, Switcheroo provides a good means of limiting their defensive capabilities. Picking its Tera type is fairly arbitrary, though Tera Fighting lets Choice Band Hisuian Sneasel 2HKO Sandaconda with Close Combat and Choice Scarf Hisuian Sneasel 2HKO Toxicroak after Stealth Rock; alternatively, Tera Dark provides defensive utility against Mesprit, ensures Night Slash OHKOes Rotom after Stealth Rock, and denies Sableye's Prankster Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Despite Choice Scarf and Choice Band Hisuian Sneasel being somewhat different in function, their teammates are pretty similar. Both benefit from teammates like Clawitzer, Rotom, and Mesprit that can take advantage of Sandaconda so they feel less inclined to Terastallize and deal with it themselves. Where they differ is that Choice Scarf Sneasel is far more suited as a late-game cleaner and, as a result, is more reliant on wallbreakers like Guts Ursaring, Magneton, and offensive Appletun to weaken its checks.

Tera Ghost allows Pyroar to turn the tables against common Fighting-types such as Toxicroak, Medicham, and Hisuian Sneasel that would usually destroy it. Alternatively, Tera Grass allows Pyroar to tank powerful Water- and Ground-type attacks from Bruxish, Floatzel, and Sandaconda.</p> <p>Pyroar can't reliably defeat walls such as Blissey, Umbreon, and Appletun; it best pairs with physical wallbreakers like Toxicroak, Scyther, and Samurott that can deal with these threats.

Grass-types like Cacturne, Appletun, and Lurantis appreciate Pyroar for checking threats such as Scyther, Avalugg, and Vivillon; in return, they check Water-types like Bruxish, Clawitzer, and Samurott. Fighting-types like Hisuian Sneasel and Choice Scarf Medicham can threaten out Pyroar, so it pairs best with Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Mesprit, Bruxish, and Drifblim.</p> "

Veluza is an excellent choice for hyper offense teams, where it acts as a deadly wallbreaker and late-game cleaner. Veluza can easily find setup opportunities against passive foes, such as Vaporeon, and Choice-locked foes, such as a Passimian that just used Close Combat. Although Veluza is extremely powerful after setting up, it may not always get the chance to do so due to its frailty. Veluza's defensive typing is also relatively poor; it is weak to common attacks, including pivoting moves like U-turn from Scyther and Volt Switch from Rotom. Furthermore, Veluza's speed and firepower are rather mediocre prior to setup.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tera Ground enables Veluza to turn the tables on a Jolteon or Rotom trying to grab momentum with Volt Switch. Tera Electric is another option that lets Veluza avoid paralysis from Chansey and Sandaconda while also turning its Electric weakness into a resistance.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure: Veluza's mediocre bulk and need to sacrifice half of its health to set up means that sufficient offensive pressure can prevent it from taking over a game.</p> <p><strong>U-turn and Volt Switch</strong>: Veluza's poor defensive typing renders it weak to both U-turn and Volt Switch, which means that foes such as Jolteon and Scyther can easily gain momentum on or KO it.</p> <p><strong>Cacturne: Cacturne is immune to Psycho Cut and Aqua Cutter, enabling it to completely wall any Veluza not running Tera Fairy Tera Blast.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Fillet Away is one of the best setup moves in the game, doubling Veluza's Speed and power at the cost of half its health. Aqua Cutter and Psycho Cut are both boosted by Sharpness, and after a Fillet Away will OHKO many neutral targets, such as Rotom, Mabosstiff, and Clawitzer. For Veluza's last move, Substitute can be used to ease prediction, facilitate setup, and avoid Sucker Punch. Aqua Jet can also be used to revenge kill weakened foes and, after setup, outprioritize other priority moves such as Lycanroc's Accelerock. Tera Blast is an option with Tera Fairy to blast past Cacturne, which otherwise completely walls it. Otherwise, Tera Water is good choice to further boost the power of Veluza's Aqua Cutter, giving it a guaranteed OHKO on specially defensive Umbreon after Stealth Rock. Sitrus Berry helps Veluza set up sucessfully, and 4 HP EVs ensure that it will activate after a Fillet Away. An Adamant nature is preferred to maximize Veluza's damage output, but a Jolly nature enables Veluza to outspeed Timid Farigiraf prior to setup and Choice Scarf Zoroark post-setup.</p> <p>Veluza's incredible Speed and power after setup make it an excellent choice for hyper offense teams. Entry hazard support from Lycanroc and Qwilfish can help chip Veluza's checks into range of its attacks. Bulk Up Paldean Tauros is a great partner for Veluza, as it can easily switch into and set up against Pokemon that give Veluza trouble, such as Cacturne. In return, Veluza can set up on Pokemon used to revenge kill or force out Paldean Tauros, like a Choice Scarf Indeedee-F locked into Psychic or Psyshock. Paldean Tauros also helps Veluza break past shared walls in Vaporeon and Tera Water Sandaconda, enabling one of them to sweep late-game. Other good offensive partners to pair with Veluza include Jolteon and Quiver Dance Vivillon. Jolteon provides an Electric immunity for the team while also giving Veluza points of entry through Volt Switch. Vivillon threatens Cacturne, and its Sleep Powder may cripple one of Veluza's checks, allowing it to sweep. Indeedee-F is another good teammate for Veluza, as Psychic Terrain shields Veluza from priority attacks, such as Sucker Punch, while boosting the power of Psycho Cut to absurd levels.</p> "

  "Farigiraf": {
    "overview": "<p>Farigiraf is one of the most threatening Stored Power users in the tier. It has more durability than Veluza and can boost Speed unlike Mesprit and Blissey, giving it more flexibility in how it approaches a sweep. Farigiraf's Cud Chew can grant it unique setup opportunities, as Sitrus Berry turns many 2HKOs into 3HKOs. However, Farigiraf usually needs at least 2 turns to start posing a serious threat; Knock Off from Bombirdier, Haze from Cryogonal and Articuno, and Encore from Sableye can easily disrupt its setup, while simple overwhelming offensive pressure can stop it from getting out of hand.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Farigiraf usually wants to use Agility first followed by its other boosting move before it starts outputting damage. Sitrus Berry and Cud Chew allow Farigiraf to shrug off a majority of neutral attacks in the tier, greatly improving its survivability to grant Farigiraf the two turns of setup that it needs. The other alternative to Sitrus Berry is Cud Chew + Lum Berry, giving Farigiraf status immunity for 2 turns, which could allow Farigiraf to set up on the likes of Glare Sandaconda and Toxic or Thunder Wave Qwilfish. The Speed EVs let Farigiraf outspeed neutral-natured Clawitzer &amp; positive Speed-natured Cacturne and Ursaring at +0 while outrunning Choice Scarf Bruxish after an Agility, with the rest of the EVs being invested into Special Attack for maximum damage output. Dazzling Gleam is often preferred over Tera Blast for the ability to hit Dark-types without needing to Terastallize. Tera Fairy is very useful for its Dragon Tail immunity against Eelektross and Appletun, and turns Farigiraf's weaknesses to Dark and Bug into resistances, and also boosts Dazzling Gleam. Sap Sipper can also complement Tera Fairy to completely blank Appletun's dual STAB combination, with Cacturne and Lurantis being bonus setup targets. Armor Tail can be considered to stop priority moves from Pokemon such as Toxicroak and Bruxish while turning Sableye into setup fodder. Farigiraf can also use Calm Mind and a bulkier spread to set up more reliably on weaker special attackers such as Abomasnow, Raichu, and non-Trick Rotom. With Tera Steel, Farigiraf is able to better take on common Haze users like Articuno, Cryogonal, and Hisuian Qwilfish, hitting the former two super effectively with Tera Blast and gaining an immunity to the latter's Poison-type attacks.</p> <p>Farigiraf's low Speed often mandates using Agility first and also means it generally cannot threaten the opponent until turn 3, as it takes two turns to set up Agility followed by Nasty Plot. Strong teammates that can apply quick and immediate pressure on the opponent make for good partners, such as Tauros, Hisuian Sneasel, and Rotom. Pokemon that can also handle Farigiraf's checks and counters, namely Dark-types and Haze users, are especially appreciated. Nasty Plot + Taunt Houndoom and Trick Rotom or Haunter can bait out defensive responses such as Umbreon, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Blissey in order to cripple them. A double Psychic core involving Farigiraf and either Bruxish or Mesprit can also work to wear down their shared checks and prevent them from answering one or the other. Rest Sandaconda can shrug off attacks from Umbreon and Hisuian Qwilfish while even smacking the latter with Earthquake. Hisuian Sneasel and Toxicroak can threaten Umbreon and Hisuian Qwilfish, whereas Magneton, Pyroar, Houndoom, and Perrserker can switch into Haze Cryogonal and Articuno to apply offensive pressure. Scyther, Bombirdier, Magneton, and Perrserker can force out the opponent's less defensive Pokemon and pivot to give Farigiraf a window of opportunity to set up, with Bombirdier being particularly notable due to its access to Parting Shot and Memento. Abomasnow can provide Aurora Veil support for Farigiraf to make setting up easier.</p> "
