Poison Touch and Poison Jab let Muk effortlessly spread poison, even on Pokemon immune to Toxic Spikes such as Drifblim and Eelektross. Drain Punch hits Steel-types such as Copperajah and Terastallized Appletun that would otherwise wall Muk. Haze stops setup sweepers such as Vivillon and Calm Mind Vaporeon from setting up. Toxic Spikes lets Muk take advantage of free turns and cripple the opposing team with poison. Tera Dark allows Muk to beat threats like Bruxish and Zoroark after baiting them into their powerful Dark- and Psychic-type attacks and retaliate back while also being able to use Haze against boosted Stored Power users like Veluza and Farigiraf. Alternatively, Tera Water provides an overall better defensive typing, more specifically easing the matchup against offensive Water-types like Calm Mind Vaporeon and Choice Specs Clawitzer. Muk struggles with Pokemon such as Sandaconda, which does not fear its poison due to Shed Skin and can threaten it back with Earthquake. As a result, Muk appreciates teammates such as Rotom, Eelektross, and Cacturne, which can switch into Sandaconda and force it out. Muk is physically frail, making physical walls such as Sandaconda and Drifblim great partners, with the latter also getting rid of entry hazards, which chip Muk down throughout a game.</p> "

Waterfall is used over Liquidation to potentially cause flinching, which works wonders in conjunction with Toxic, although Surf can be used for a 2HKO on Sandaconda and more damage on other physically bulky Pokemon like Drifblim and Klawf. Despite Intimidate being such a high-value ability, Qwilfish typically prefers Poison Point to punish U-turn from the likes of Passimian and Scyther while not activating Passimian's Defiant in the process. Protect can be used with Leftovers for some extra recovery and also to scout moves from Choice item users like Rotom, Bruxish, and Zoroark. Upon scouting these Pokemon, Qwilfish can invert its weakness to Electric- or Psychic-type moves with a timely Terastallization to a respective Ground or Dark typing, letting it spread more poison and set more Spikes. Umbreon is a great defensive partner, sponging general special attacks while boasting an immunity to Psychic. In return, Qwilfish heavily punishes Fighting-type attacks and U-turn, while also resisting Fairy.
