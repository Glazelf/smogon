Trick incapacitates checks such as Blissey and Tinkaton, limiting their usefulness long-term. Tera Ghost further boosts the power of Shadow Ball, allowing it to muscle past walls like Tinkaton, Hippowdon, and most importantly Gastrodon. Tera Fairy is an alternative that gives Gengar a valuable Dark resistance, assisting against Sucker Punch users like Bisharp and Lokix as well as other Dark-types like Iron Jugulis.</p> <p>Gengar is a good fit on bulky offense teams by virtue of its excellent wallbreaking power, synergizing well with pivots that can bring it in safely; these include the likes of Sandy Shocks, Scizor, and Talonflame, all of which give it free entry against Pokemon like Tsareena, Salamence, and Wo-Chien. Sandy Shocks also provides Spikes support, putting more pressure on Covert Cloak Gastrodon and Tyranitar. Slowbro can provide Future Sight support, making it harder for Grafaiai and Gastrodon to switch in. Tinkaton is able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots or Covert Cloak from Gastrodon, one of Gengar's better checks, making it a solid partner. Physical wallbreakers like Pawmot and Slither Wing put pressure on special walls like Gastrodon and Tyranitar and can also weaken Hippowdon, making it easier for Gengar itself to wallbreak. The aforementioned physical attackers also threaten Wo-Chien, which takes advantage of Gengar being locked into Shadow Ball. Gengar is easily revenge killed by threats like Noivern, Scizor, and Choice Scarf Pawmot, so checks to them such as Hippowdon and Talonflame are appreciated.</p> "

It can outspeed boosted threats like Polteageist, Toxtricity, Salamence, and opposing Choice Scarf users like Sandy Shocks, Pawmot, and Staraptor. Energy Ball blows away Gastrodon and Sandy Shocks while doing servicable damage to Tyranitar and Hippowdon. On the other hand, Focus Blast hits Grafaiai and Dark-types like Tyranitar and Bisharp, and it lets Gengar revenge kill foes like Tera Normal Lucario and Lycanroc-D, although Gengar likes the ability to immediately KO Gastrodon. Thunderbolt allows Gengar to nail Dragon Dance Gyarados and Booster Energy Iron Jugulis super effectively. Trick improves its matchup against defensive teams by crippling switch-ins like Tinkaton, Hippowdon, and Tera Poison Wo-Chien, as well as shutting down bulky setup sweepers like Oricorio-E. Tera Ghost amplifies Shadow Ball damage, notably 2HKOing Quagsire and OHKOing Gallade, Gardevoir, and Slowbro, while still maintaining Gengar's immunity to Lucario's Extreme Speed. Tera Fairy is a more defensive option to take on Bisharp and Lokix's Sucker Punch as well as Bite from Maushold, one of the few Pokemon that can outspeed Gengar at +1.</p> <p>Gengar finds a place on bulky offense and offense teams. Early-game wallbreakers like Scizor, Slither Wing, Tyranitar, and Bisharp can severely weaken or overwhelm Tinkaton, Hippowdon, and Dark-types for Gengar to clean up late-game. Tyranitar and Bisharp also provide a solid defensive backbone against opposing Choice Scarf Gengar to avoid risking Speed ties, with the latter switching into Lokix and opposing Bisharp's Sucker Punch as well. In return, Gengar matches up well against offensive threats like Pawmot, Lucario, and Choice Scarf Gallade that would pose a threat to them. Offensive pivots like Sandy Shocks, Tsareena, and the aforementioned Scizor and Slither Wing can bring Gengar in safely on foes such as opposing Tsareena, Talonflame, Paldean Tauros-W, and Scream Tail, respectively. Moreover, Sandy Shocks provides entry hazards to chip down Gengar's checks, while Tsareena threatens bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon and Gastrodon, the latter of which is especially problematic since its Sticky Hold prevents Gengar's Trick.</p> "

Toxic puts many notable Pokemon in the tier on a timer such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon. Quagsire ideally wants Spikes over Stealth Rock to force more chip damage on potential switch-ins; however, Stealth Rock is fine as an alternative if none of its other teammates can afford to fit it into their moveset. Alternatively, Ice Beam with a Relaxed nature allows Quagsire to 2HKO Hawlucha after Stealth Rock and lets it beat Substitute + Dragon Dance Tera Flying Tyranitars. The passive recovery of Leftovers allows Quagsire to check Choice Band Tyranitar and Mimikyu more easily; however, if the team can not fit entry hazard removal, Heavy-Duty Boots is much more appealing. Quagsire only uses Terastallization defensively to check certain dangerous offensive threats. Tera Poison grants Quagsire a perfectly accurate Toxic and a poison immunity while also allowing it to handle Grass-types and offensive threats that use Grass-type moves such as Tsareena, Trailblaze Scizor, and Seed Bomb Pawmot. Tera Ghost allows Quagsire to beat Maushold by becoming immune to Population Bomb as well as check Slither Wing and Lucario more easily. Tera Ghost also has the added benefit of letting Quagsire serve as a spinblocker against spinners such as Tsareena.</p> <p>Quagsire primarily fits on balance, stall, and bulky offense teams as a defensive glue that holds these teams together. Common teammates for Quagsire include Stealth Rock setters such as Tinkaton and Tyranitar, which can allow Quagsire to run Spikes. Both can check Gengar, special Salamence, and Iron Jugulis, which pose a threat to Quagsire. Tinkaton can also use Knock Off on Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Sticky Hold Gastrodon, Scream Tail, and Wo-Chien to rack up more damage from Quagsire's Spikes. Scream Tail is another Pokemon that complements Quagsire, as it is able to handle special Salamence as well as Gallade, while Quagsire is able to keep Bisharp and non-Trailblaze Scizor in check. Talonflame is another ideal partner for Quagsire as it can check Tsareena and Giga Drain variants of Wo-Chien. Blissey on stall teams is also a strong partner for Quagsire by virtue of walling almost every special attacker in the tier such as Iron Jugulis, Noivern, and Sandy Shocks.</p> "

Its solid natural bulk further boosted by sand grants it plenty of opportunities to enter the field and wallbreak, such as in the face of offensive threats like Gengar, Noivern, Iron Jugulis, and special Salamence. Offensively, the sand helps further chip down defensive foes like Wo-Chien, Tera Fairy Slowking, and Scream Tail, and it diminishes Tsareena and Florges's Synthesis. Earthquake hits Pokemon like Tinkaton, Bisharp, Pawmot, and opposing Tyranitar super effectively. Ice Punch threatens Ground-types like Hippowdon and Donphan as well as various Pokemon like Salamence, Noivern, and Wo-Chien without risking a Stone Edge miss. Tera Flying allows Tera Blast to OHKO would-be checks like defensive Slither Wing and Paldean Tauros-W, and it gets rid of most of Tyranitar's weaknesses, allowing it to sit on Hippowdon and Quagsire and take on potential revenge killers like Scizor, Slither Wing, Lucario, and Gyarados. Aside from maintaining the sand boost, Tera Rock further skyrockets Stone Edge's power, granting significant odds to OHKO Scream Tail after Stealth Rock and 2HKOing physically defensive Wo-Chien. Tera Blast can still be run for a more reliable Rock-type attack when Stone Edge's power isn't necessary, such as against Talonflame and Iron Jugulis.</p> <p>Tyranitar is perfectly suited for offense and bulky offense teams. Pivots like Slowking, Talonflame, and Noivern can bring Tyranitar in safely on the field to wreak absolute havoc, especially as they tend to invite in Pokemon such as opposing Slowking and Slowbro. Additionally, Slowking’s Future Sight enhances Tyranitar's wallbreaking, while Noivern can overwhelm a shared check in Tinkaton; both of which pressure the likes of Paldean Tauros-W, Slither Wing, Quagsire, and Donphan for it. Slowking and Talonflame also switch into offensive threats that beat Tyranitar, such as Slither Wing, Lucario, and Tinkaton, with Slowking handling Paldean Tauros-W as well. Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Tinkaton and Sandy Shocks take advantage of Tyranitar's forced switches and chip down its checks easily. Setup sweepers like Salamence, Lucario, and Gyarados enjoy Tyranitar wallbreaking early-game; it helps pressure Talonflame and Slowbro and overwhelm shared checks like Quagsire, Hippowdon, and Scream Tail for them to sweep more easily.</p> "

Rock Blast is an alternative to Stone Edge that breaks Mimikyu's Disguise and opposing Tyranitar's Substitute, but it is overall less powerful. Earthquake hits would-be switch-ins such as Tinkaton and Bisharp. Dragon Tail can be used over Earthquake to phaze setup sweepers like Oricorio-E and Polteageist, though Tyranitar loses against the aforementioned Earthquake targets. Tera Ground provides an Electric immunity, which is particularly useful against Sandy Shocks; the given Ground typing also provides a stronger Earthquake and allows it to beat opposing Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Tera Flying provides an emergency Ground immunity and a Fighting resistance, both of which help against Pawmot, opposing Tyranitar, and Slither Wing. The Stealth Rock weakness given by Tera Flying also makes Heavy-Duty Boots worth considering; this lets it avoid otherwise crippling entry hazard damage and stay heatlhy longer. Tera Fairy gives Tyranitar a crucial resistance to Fighting, letting it bait the aforementioned foes and shedding its Ground weakness. It also helps Tyranitar to survive Ground-type coverage from faster foes like Haxorus and Salamence. However, Tera Fairy and Flying remove the Special Defense boost given by sand, as well as Tyranitar's immunity to its own sand, making Tyranitar worse against threats such as Gengar, Maushold, and Prankster Grafaiai, so it must be careful when Terastallizing.</p> <p>Tyranitar's excellent defensive utility makes it fit well on bulky offense and balance teams. Tyranitar's weakness to strong physical attackers like Slither Wing and Pawmot makes checks to them like Salamence and Quagsire great teammates; the latter can also form an entry hazard-stacking core with Tyranitar, making it easier to wear down foes like Tinkaton and Wo-Chien. Salamence provides a safer switch-in into Talonflame, preventing it from taking a burn or U-turn chip. Scream Tail appreciates Tyranitar checking Gengar and taking pressure off of it as a check to certain special attackers like Salamence and Iron Jugulis. It can also check the aforementioned physical attackers alongside others like Gallade, and it can provide Wish support to keep Tyranitar healthy as well. Tinkaton can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Talonflame, Slowking, and Sandy Shocks, making Stealth Rock more effective in wearing down the opposition, especially if Tyranitar is paired with a Spikes setter like Sandy Shocks. Tyranitar being checked by bulky Ground-types like Quagsire, Hippowdon, and Donphan makes the likes of Tsareena and Wo-Chien desirable as teammates; Tsareena in particular also gives Tyranitar free entry against Noivern and Gengar via U-turn.</p> "

Heavy-Duty Boots removes Salamence's Stealth Rock weakness, which allows it to switch in more freely against threats it needs to check. Terastallizing is primarily used defensively to improve its matchups against common offensive Pokemon. Tera Water allows Salamence to resist Bullet Punch from Scizor and still retain a Water-type resistance against Floatzel. Tera Steel improves the matchup against Tinkaton, turns Salamence into a decent Staraptor and Maushold check, and provides a resist to many forms of priority in the tier such as Accelerock from Lycanroc-D and Bullet Punch from Scizor.

Earthquake provides perfect coverage to deal with Tyranitar, Tinkaton, and Bisharp. Dual Wingbeat helps break through Scream Tail better and can pick off weakened Flying-types like Noivern and Iron Jugulis without locking into Outrage. Roost is an alternative that provides longevity against Pokemon like Slither Wing and Lokix. It is best used alongside Intimidate on bulkier teams that need the defensive utility of Salamence's typing. Otherwise, Moxie is preferred, as it can easily let Salamence snowball through a team.

Stealth Rock should only be used as Gastrodon's hazard of choice if it cannot be fit onto another team member. Sludge Bomb and Ice Beam both help to take care of Grass-types like Wo-Chien and Tsareena. Sludge Bomb poisons hinders Alomomola and Slowbro, while Ice Beam also serves as an effective way of hitting Dragon-types like Salamence, Noivern, and Haxorus. Surf can be used as an alternative to hit Hippowdon harder and force Talonflame out more reliably. Storm Drain allows Gastrodon to counter rain by absorbing on Water-type attacks from Floatzel and Barraskewda as well as from other threats like Paldean Tauros-W and Tatsugiri while giving a boost to Gastrodon's attacks, though Gastrodon must Terastallize in order to handle the Paldean Tauros-W's Close Combat.

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its high Speed, unique typing, and powerful Electric-type STAB move in Double Shock, Pawmot sets itself apart as one of the premier wallbreakers in UU. Seed Bomb allows Pawmot to lure common checks such as Quagsire and Gastrodon and OHKO them handily. Alternatively, Ice Punch provides a solid middle ground against Ground- and Flying-types, in cases where losing Pawmot's Electric typing via Double Shock is not ideal, as well as allowing Pawmot to hit Brambleghast effectively, although this does require backup for Gastrodon and Quagsire. Natural Cure allows it to not worry about Talonflame's Flame Body and use Rest to improve its longevity, offsetting the damage from Life Orb and entry hazards. Tera Electric allows for Pawmot to continuously use Double Shock without switching out as well as increasing its power, making it even more difficult to handle. This also helps Pawmot's defensive matchup against threats such as Gardevoir, Noivern, and Brave Bird Talonflame; although, one should still be aware of losing important resistances to strong priority attacks such as Slither Wing's First Impression or Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Heavy-Duty Boots is also an option over Life Orb to preserve Pawmot's longevity.</p> <p>Pawmot fits well on teams that benefit from its ability to handle common threats such as Tinkaton, Slowking, and Tyranitar by breaking through them with raw power, as well as offensive teams that appreciate its excellent Speed. Reliable hazard setters such as Tinkaton and Sandy Shocks are worth considering, as the chip damage they provide makes it even easier for Pawmot to break through defensive threats, with the former also boasting Encore to help generate free turns. Grass-types, such as Wo-Chien, Brambleghast, or Tsareena are also appreciated to handle Gastrodon and Quagsire, especially if Pawmot chooses Ice punch, with the latter two also offering reliable hazard removal. Rock-types such as Tyranitar or Lycanroc-D that handle Talonflame as well as other Flying-types such as Iron Jugulis and Noivern are also appreciated. Scream Tail is also a teammate worth considering, as it has access to Stealth Rock and Encore, as well as Wish to keep Pawmot healthy and Thunder Wave to cripple fast threats like Grafaiai and Gengar while also having a strong matchup against revenge killers such as Noivern and Iron Jugulis. Pawmot also appreciates teammates with pivoting moves, such as Scizor, Tsareena, Noivern, and Grafaiai, to allow it to come in safely, especially against targets such as Tinkaton or Slowking.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Wo-Chien is a stalwart defensive option that checks offensive threats such as Sandy Shocks and Polteageist, and it takes advantage of some defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon. Knock Off is crucial to hinder the longevity of checks such as Talonflame and Salamence. Leech Seed and Protect are useful to quickly rack up residual damage against foes such as Tinkaton, and Protect scouts Choice-locked Pokemon like Iron Jugulis. The fourth moveslot is variable; Ruination is the most consistent option to quickly drop the health of enemies such as Salamence, forcing them to spend PP to recover health. Giga Drain helps Wo-Chien immediately pressure Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Tyranitar while providing more recovery. With Substitute, Wo-Chien has plenty of opportunities to set it up against Pokemon like Slowking and Brambleghast. It forces offensive checks such as Pawmot and Gallade to break the Substitute, giving Wo-Chien more opportunities to drain their health with Leech Seed + Protect. Foul Play is also an option in that moveslot for teams that struggle against Dragon Dance Gyarados or Tyranitar, though it requires Defense investment on Wo-Chien to be reliable, especially against a Tyranitar that hasn't Terastallized. Leftovers keeps Wo-Chien intact in longer games and helps mitigate its lack of reliable recovery. Maximum Special Defense investment is necessary to check threats like Tatsugiri and survive attacks from foes like Gengar and Noivern, punishing them with Knock Off. Tera Poison is common to block Quagsire's Toxic and counter Gengar, but Wo-Chien does become weak to Sandy Shocks's Earth Power. Tera Ghost lets Wo-Chien surprise foes like Toxtricity and Slither Wing, becoming resistant to their powerful attacks, and spinblock Tatsugiri and Brambleghast. However, it does become weak to threats like Choice Band Tyranitar and Polteageist. Tera Fairy patches Wo-Chien's weakness to Iron Jugulis and retains Poison's resistance to Fighting, but it lacks any other meaningful application.</p> <p>Wo-Chien fits primarily on bulky offense, balance, and stall teams, which take advantage of it making progress with Knock Off and reliably wearing down foes such as Noivern and Tinkaton. Entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Tinkaton work to increase Wo-Chien's passive damage. They also check foes like Pawmot, Gengar, and Noivern. Toxic Spikes Gengar is also effective to leave offensive teams less room to overwhelm Wo-Chien, as it puts Pokemon like Lokix and Mimikyu on a timer, especially in conjunction with Leech Seed. Gengar also heavily appreciates Wo-Chien taking advantage of Hippowdon and Tyranitar. Talonflame is a crucial partner to Wo-Chien, as it revenge kills many of its common threats like Slither Wing, Paldean Tauros-B, and Scizor. Grafaiai is a solid check to Gengar that appreciates Wo-Chien reliably wearing down Tinkaton. Grafaiai can also mess with the offensive teams that Wo-Chien can struggle against, locking down setup threats like Salamence with Encore and lowering their threat potential with Parting Shot. It further pivots Wo-Chien into Quagsire, making sure it doesn't risk taking Toxic on the switch. Scream Tail is effective at checking foes like Pawmot and Iron Jugulis while providing Wish support. Scream Tail also appreciates Leech Seed support replenishing its health, making it better at switching into them repeatedly.</p> "
