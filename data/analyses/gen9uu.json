Tyranitar's ability to remove items with a strong Knock Off and pressure entry hazard removers like Mandibuzz and Excadrill from switching in safely make it an effective Stealth Rock setter. Thunder Wave allows Tyranitar to punish switch-ins like Keldeo, Tinkaton, and Kommo-o. It can also be used to cripple Tera Steel Latios and Double Dance Iron Crown to help other teammates deal with them better. Earthquake can be used to do heavy damage to Tinkaton, Excadrill, and Cobalion, but without Attack investment, it does not threaten much else. Ice Punch is an option if Tyranitar is paired with Excadrill to lure in and remove a weakened Hydrapple to help it sweep more easily. Leftovers is the preferred item choice to provide Tyranitar with passive recovery. Smooth Rock can be used to provide Sand Rush Excadrill with more sand turns but is far from necessary. Heavy-Duty Boots can help offset entry hazard damage. Chople Berry is a situational item that allows Tyranitar to check Nasty Plot Tornadus-T and Aura Sphere Latios. The given Speed EVs allow Tyranitar to outpace Skeledirge and hit it hard before potentially being punished by Will-O-Wisp. Tera Fairy removes Tyranitar's glaring weaknesses, particularly to Fighting, allowing it to punish Pokemon like Kommo-o. It also allows Tyranitar to deal with a boosted Draco Meteor from Latios and KO it back while improving its matchup against Lokix. Tera Ghost can be used for a similar reason to remove Tyranitar's weaknesses while also potentially preventing Excadrill from being able to remove its Stealth Rock. Tera Water is another option to improve the matchup into Greninja and Choice-locked Keldeo; however, under sand, Tyranitar can take a boosted Surf from them anyway. Tera on Tyranitar should be used in emergencies, as removing its Rock typing takes away the boost to its Special Defense under sand and causes it to take damage from sand as well.</p> <p>Tyranitar fits best on offensive structures that can force progress, as it is susceptible to being worn down quickly. Excadrill is a great partner that can remove entry hazards for Tyranitar, as well as capitalize on the sand with Sand Rush to turn it into a deadly cleaner. Tinkaton pairs nicely with Tyranitar to act as a secondary check to Latios and Tornadus-T, as both are capable of chipping away at Tyranitar or potentially KOing it with Fighting-type coverage. Tinkaton also helps against other threatening wallbreakers like Ogerpon formes and Lokix; pickpocket Tinkaton variants are able to steal their Heavy-Duty Boots, causing them to slowly get whittled down by Tyranitar's Stealth Rock and sand. Other U-turn punishers like Rocky Helmet Kommo-o and Zapdos can also support Tyranitar well. Slowking and Tornadus-T can help deal with Kommo-o, Cobalion, and Keldeo. Tornadus-T can also remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Zapdos, allowing Tyranitar to get meaningful damage on it with Stealth Rock throughout a battle. Toxapex and Hydrapple do not mind having their item removed thanks to Regenerator, so partners like Zapdos, Iron Crown, and Mamoswine can help threaten them.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Hippowdon makes for a great mixed wall by virtue of its bulk, typing, and access to reliable recovery. Its superb bulk enables it to check some of the metagame’s most dangerous threats in Pawmot, Salamence, Tyranitar, and Sandy Shocks. It also provides value through Sand Stream to help combat rain teams if given momentum to get in freely, as it can't hard switch into Water-types. Stone Edge enables Hippowdon to pressure Flying-types like Iron Jugulis and Salamence, in addition to being able to beat Taunt Dragon Dance Tyranitar even after it Terastallizes. Roar is also an option, as it allows Hippowdon to phaze setup sweepers like Polteageist in a pinch and synergizes well with entry hazards. Leftovers is the preferred item, as its residual healing improves Hippowdon's overall longevity and preserves Slack Off's PP. The given spread with an Impish nature and Leftovers avoids a 2HKO from Life Orb Pawmot and prevents Hippowdon from being KOed by Hurricane into Draco Meteor from Salamence after Stealth Rock while avoiding a 2HKO from Sandy Shocks without Stealth Rock. Rocky Helmet is also an option to punish physical attackers, primarily U-turn users and Maushold. A specially defensive spread is an option to handle Gengar if Pawmot is less of a concern. Tera Rock pairs well with its sand, as the Special Defense boost it receives gives it a strong matchup versus special attackers like Gengar, Salamence, and Noivern. Additionally, Tera Rock boosts Hippowdon’s Stone Edge to put more pressure on targets like Salamence. After Hippowdon has Terastallized, it is threatened by Pawmot, Sandy Shocks, and Tyranitar, so be careful when Terastallizing. Tera Ghost is an option that makes Hippowdon a strong response versus Slither Wing, Lucario, and Maushold and lets it spinblock against Donphan. Tera Fairy is an option that grants Hippowdon a generally good defensive typing, including a Fighting resistance, and makes it less vulnerable to Greninja. After becoming a Fairy- or a Ghost-type, Hippowdon is unable to check Gengar, and in the case of the latter, Tyranitar sets running Crunch as well. Tera Dragon makes Hippowdon an effective answer to rain teams through the useful Water-type resistance it provides.</p> <p>Hippowdon most commonly fits on bulky offense or balance teams for its walling capabilities. Talonflame and Noivern make for good partners, as they are capable of grabbing momentum with U-turn off of opposing Decidueye and Wo-Chien swapping in to exploit Hippowdon. Hippowdon can in return easily absorb Knock Off from the likes of Tinkaton in order to preserve the Heavy-Duty Boots they both depend on. Wo-Chien is also a solid pick for a partner as a nice fit on most balance teams, as well as an answer to bulky Water-types that may attempt to annoy Hippowdon. In particular, Wo-Chien’s RestTalk set is capable of swapping in on Quagsire easily, as it is able to shrug off Toxic. Wo-Chien can also relieve pressure from Hippowdon, as it can take on Sandy Shocks. Tinkaton also makes for a good partner, as it is able to take a lot of the pressure off of Hippowdon by taking hits from Gengar and specially offensive Flying-types such as Iron Jugulis, Noivern, and Salamence. Tinkaton is also capable of providing useful Knock Off support by removing opposing Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots to enable Hippowdon’s Stealth Rock and sandstorm damage to stick. In return, Hippowdon being able to carry Stealth Rock means that Tinkaton does not need to run it itself and can fit a more useful option. Assault Vest Cyclizar is able to check Greninja and Wo-Chien for Hippowdon and keep Spikes or Toxic Spikes off the field from the former.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Rotom-W thrives as a pivot within the tier thanks to its unique typing, solid bulk in tandem with access to Pain Split, and access to a great ability in Levitate. Hydro Pump gives Rotom-W an excellent STAB option and makes the life of Ground-types wishing to block Volt Switch such as Rhyperior and Excadrill hard. Volt Switch lets Rotom-W generate momentum on Pokemon that would easily take a Hydro Pump such as Azumarill, Tornadus-T, and Slowking. Will-O-Wisp helps Rotom-W cripple physically offensive threats that dislike being burnt such as Ogerpon, Kommo-o, and Excadrill while slowly chipping down any burnt Pokemon. Thunder Wave, on the other hand, punishes Iron Crown, Tornadus-T, and Latios by slowing them down while helping teammates take advantage of the Speed cut as well as the chance of paralysis. Pain Split in tandem with Rotom-W's naturally low HP stat allows it to recover a significant amount of health on foes like Hydrapple and Slowking, keeping itself healthy throughout the game. Leftovers is used to increase Rotom-W's longevity over the course of the match, letting it passively recover its health. Rotom-W is able to run two distinct EV spreads, both of which maximize its HP while allowing it to outspeed Adamant Scizor and Tyranitar. Investment into Rotom-W's Defense with a Bold nature lets it handle Sand Rush Excadrill and Metagross while living a Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine Head Smash. Rotom-W with a Calm nature and EVs in Special Defense make it a solid check to Greninja, Tornadus-T, and Zapdos. Tera Steel combined with Levitate removes the Ground weakness it would otherwise gain while gifting Rotom-W a spectacular defensive typing, letting it check Ogerpon-C and Latios better.</p> <p>Rotom-W's traits fit best on bulky offense teams that love its ability to cripple opposing Pokemon while pivoting on and off the field. Wallbreakers such as Ogerpon-C and Metagross fit excellently with it, being able to take advantage of Latios, Hydrapple, and Zapdos, which may want to switch into Rotom-W to block its shenanigans, with Metagross also functioning as a solid Latios check. Other pivots that synergize well with Rotom-W such as Lokix, Scizor, and Tornadus-T are excellent teammates, with Lokix and Scizor forming a strong VoltTurn core while handling Ogerpon, Hydrapple, and Latios for Rotom-W, while Assault Vest Tornadus-T can pivot into special Kommo-o, Latios, and Keldeo for it. Ogerpon specifically both functions as a pivot and a way of punishing setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Kommo-o, Calm Mind Latios, and Booster Energy Iron Crown with Encore thanks to Rotom-W's Volt Switch giving it free entry. Entry hazard setters like Tinkaton and Kommo-o are fantastic partners for Rotom-W that support it with their strong defensive profiles. Kommo-o in particular is an excellent option, as it manages to beat Mold Breaker Excadrill, one of Rotom-W's main annoyances. Hydrapple is an even stronger check to Excadrill as well as Dragon Dance Kommo-o that appreciates Rotom-W's ability to handle Flying- and Ice-type types like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Mamoswine. Hisuian Arcanine functions excellently with Rotom-W, being able to maximize its offensive potential thanks to Rotom-W baiting in the likes of Hydrapple and Tinkaton for it, with Will-O-Wisp chipping down opposing checks like Kommo-o and Mamoswine and Thunder Wave allowing Hisuian Arcanine to outspeed Pokemon like Latios and Keldeo.</p>"

        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Kommo-o's fantastic defensive profile to handle prominent threats such as Ogerpon-C, Arcanine-H, and Tyranitar. Kommo-o is a very flexible Pokemon and can accommodate a team's needs by being an effective entry hazard setter with Stealth Rock or a bulky setup sweeper with options like Iron Defense and Bulk Up. Body Press off Kommo-o's high Defense allows it to be quite threatening, especially to neutral targets such as Tinkaton. Iron Defense should only be used alongside Body Press, as Kommo-o can boost alongside dangerous foes like Scizor and Ursaluna and KO them with an empowered Body Press. It notably also allows Kommo-o to beat Mandibuzz, and with Tera Steel, Kommo-o can avoid Toxic from it as well as beat other Pokemon like Metagross and Hydrapple. Bulk Up can also be used alongside Body Press, as it bolsters Defense alongside Attack to strengthen Kommo-o's other coverage options; however, it is slower, so it should ideally be used with Drain Punch, which provides Kommo-o with much more longevity. Poison Jab allows Kommo-o to punish Azumarill and is also its best means to punish defensive switch-ins like Slowking, Latios, and Zapdos with poison, though Zapdos can punish it with Static. Thunder Punch is another option that, if used alongside Bulk Up and Tera Electric, can let Kommo-o muscle through its defensive answers more easily and avoid being punished by Static. Taunt prevents defensive Pokemon like Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Mandibuzz from using their recovery or status moves, allowing Kommo-o to beat them or keep them weakened. Dragon Tail is used to force out setup Pokemon like Sinistcha, opposing Kommo-o, and, with Tera Steel, Calm Mind Iron Crown and Latios. Leftovers is preferred to provide Kommo-o with longevity. Rocky Helmet is an alternative to punish Scizor and Lokix at the cost of cutting into Kommo-o's staying power, so it should be used alongside Drain Punch. Soundproof allows Kommo-o to answer special Clangorous Soul Kommo-o and prevent Psychic Noise from Iron Crown. It also stops Skeledirge from using Torch Song, which is especially useful if Kommo-o has Terastallized into the Steel typing, though without Taunt, Kommo-o cannot easily punish it. Bulletproof is an alternative to deal with Pecharunt and Sinistcha more easily, and when used alongside Tera Steel, Kommo-o can answer Focus Blast Iron Crown and Aura Sphere variants of Latios. The EV spread lets Kommo-o outspeed Bisharp and Volcanion, with the rest invested in bulk.</p> <p>Tinkaton is a fantastic partner, as it switches into Latios and Hydrapple, two dangerous wallbreakers that Kommo-o can give free turns. Tinkaton is also able to act as a secondary check to Ogerpon-C and Lokix, which is appreciated, as the former can potentially carry Play Rough, and with Pickpocket, Tinkaton can steal Heavy-Duty Boots from Lokix, allowing entry hazards and potential Rocky Helmet chip damage from Kommo-o to wear it down. Alternatively, Tinkaton can run Stealth Rock itself to allow Kommo-o to utilize other options like Bulk Up and Iron Defense. Other Stealth Rock setters like Tyranitar and Arcanine-H can also do this while having the ability to better check and threaten common answers to Kommo-o such as Zapdos, Skeledirge, and Tornadus-T. Overcoat can be considered when partnered with Tyranitar to avoid sand wearing Kommo-o down or canceling out its Leftovers recovery. Zapdos can pressure common Kommo-o answers like Toxapex, Azumarill, and Okidogi as well as bring Kommo-o in with Volt Switch against Tyranitar and Ogerpon-C to find opportunities to boost or set hazards. Speed control users in the form of Scizor, Lokix, and Tera Ogerpon make for great partners to take pressure off Kommo-o, preventing it from losing too much health when combating threats such as Ogerpon-C and Greninja. Ogerpon can also alleviate the pressure of Kommo-o having to take on the role of a phazer, having access to a fast Encore to lock Pokemon like Iron Crown into Calm Mind.</p>"

Tinted Lens prevents foes from playing around Lokix with defensive Terastallization, meaning they will all be hit for neutral damage at best. Knock Off punishes common switch-ins like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Kommo-o. Sucker Punch is additional priority that allows Lokix to pick off foes like Assault Vest Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock and First Impression damage. Tera Bug is used to blow past Excadrill and Azumarill, letting Lokix KO the latter after Belly Drum if Stealth Rock is up. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Lokix to dash in and out of the field easily. Silver Powder puts an additional kick into First Impression, OHKOing Choice Scarf Mienshao, Assault Vest Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock, and Excadrill with a layer of Spikes after Tera Bug at the cost of Lokix taking entry hazard damage, limiting the amount of entry points in a game. On such sets, Leech Life can be used over Knock Off to retain longevity, at the cost of forgoing the ability to punish common switch-ins. Adamant should be used most often for maximum damage output, but Jolly allows Lokix to nail Hisuian Arcanine before it uses Extreme Speed and pivot out freely on Excadrill.</p> <p>Lokix fits best on bulky offense and balance teams, acting as a potent revenge killer to offensive threats. Offensive partners like Latios and Ogerpon-C appreciate Lokix's U-turn freely bringing them in on Kommo-o and Zapdos. Removing Zapdos in particular is very important to let Lokix more freely pivot around without worry about Static. Slowking forms an excellent pivoting core with Lokix, as slow Chilly Reception can bring Lokix in safely on Pokemon that threaten Slowking such as Greninja and Ogerpon and it can handle the likes of Toxapex and mixed Kommo-o. Slowking's Future Sight support can also dissuade Toxapex and defensive Kommo-o from wanting to switch into Lokix in the first place. Other pivots like Zapdos and Thunder Wave Rotom-W can handle Tornadus-T through paralysis, giving Lokix more room to pivot in and out. Lokix greatly appreciates entry hazard support to more easily revenge kill Excadrill. Tinkaton and defensive Kommo-o appreciate Lokix's Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots for Stealth Rock while in return handling Rock-types like Ogerpon-C and Hisuian Arcanine. Spikes setters such as Sandy Shocks and Ogerpon can take on Zapdos and Hippowdon. Excadrill is a fantastic partner for Silver Powder sets especially, as it removes entry hazards for Lokix to freely pivot around and helps overwhelm Zapdos and Tornadus-T. In return, Lokix nails Hydrapple and can give Excadrill safe entry against Rotom-W and Toxapex. Slower wallbreakers such as Azumarill, Hisuian Arcanine, and Mamoswine appreciate having faster checks like Ogerpon and Sand Rush Excadrill dealt with.</p>"

Knock Off allows Ogerpon to punish many of the Pokemon attempting to switch into it such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Skeledirge. U-turn allows Ogerpon to pivot out of matchups that are unfavorable for it such as Tinkaton, Okidogi, and Skeledirge while doing solid damage to Hydrapple that may want to switch in, and thanks to Heavy-Duty Boots, it is able to remain healthy throughout the match and easily pivot in and out of the field. Encore gives it the ability to take advantage of slower Pokemon that have locked themselves into an awkward move so it can go for a free move the turn after, such as Zapdos using Roost or Mandibuzz clicking Defog, which, when paired with Defiant, gives Ogerpon a free Attack boost. On the other hand, Ogerpon is able to use the pressure it creates as opportunities to set up Spikes for its team, helping its teammates and itself by slowly chipping down the opposing team's checks. Ogerpon's Tera type is locked into Grass, but with Embody Aspect, it is given a boost to its Speed on top of the additional boost to its STAB moves, letting it OHKO Slowking and have a chance to 2HKO Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock. This means that Ogerpon can act not only as a powerful breaker with Tera, but also as an emergency speed control option that can outrun every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, as well as a number of boosted Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mienshao and Excadrill after Rapid Spin. Ogerpon's Speed boost also allows it to have unique interactions with Encore, switching in on faster Pokemon to lock them into set up moves such as Calm Mind Latios or Dragon Dance Kommo-o.</p> <p>Ogerpon's pivoting and utility options are best suited on bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to disrupt foes while bringing in their own threats. Wallbreakers such as Azumarill, Hisuian Arcanine, and Mamoswine love Ogerpon's ability to pivot them in safely, weaken their checks, and potentially set up Spikes for them to break more easily; In return, they are able to deal with some of Ogerpon's checks such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Hydrapple. Pivots that are able to synergize well with Ogerpon such as Slowking, Tornadus-T, and Zapdos make for excellent partners, being able to form a strong core while relieving Ogerpon of the pressure of taking on threats like Latios, Iron Crown, Excadrill, and Lokix. Stealth Rock setters such as Tinkaton and Kommo-o mesh well with Ogerpon that opt for Spikes by maximizing the entry hazard stacking potential, with Tinkaton able to fit Encore instead while taking on Greninja and Zapdos, while Kommo-o can effectively deal with Excadrill and Lokix for it. Sandy Shocks is an excellent teammate for Ogerpon, being able to take on the Flying-types that it's afraid of, creating a VoltTurn core with it, and being able to set up Stealth Rock for it while Ogerpon handles the Water- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Sandy Shocks well while beating its key checks like Azumarill and Rotom-Wash.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Ogerpon-C is a terrifying powerhouse, with very few defensive Pokemon able to resist its STAB combination or stand up to its sheer power after a Swords Dance. Ivy Cudgel is the STAB move of choice, capable of nailing even checks like Tinkaton and mixed Kommo-o with a 2HKO after boosting. Power Whip, while inconsistent due to poor accuracy, is also notably stronger, allowing Ogerpon-C to OHKO offensive threats like Keldeo and Azumarill and have a chance at OHKOing Excadrill without boosting. Alternatively, while less immediately powerful, Horn Leech's healing can help Ogerpon-C to survive revenge killing attempts, and in some cases, even allow for multiple uses of Sturdy. However, while it does obtain OHKOs and 2HKOs on most notable targets, especially after a Swords Dance, the drastically lower power can cause Ogerpon-C to miss important OHKOs on targets like Slowking and Tyranitar, especially if unboosted. Ogerpon-C's last moveslot is immensely customizable thanks to its near perfect STAB combination; Knock Off allows Ogerpon-C an intersection of additional coverage and utility, notably helping against threats like Metagross and Iron Crown, although one must be wary of Weakness Policy and Booster Energy variants of the latter. Meanwhile, Spiky Shield helps to prevent being revenge killed by Lokix's First Impression and can allow Ogerpon-C to avoid being hit by Tinkaton's Gigaton Hammer entirely. Sturdy allows Ogerpon-C to be significantly more aggressive, with the ability to live any one hit from full HP allowing it to pose much more of a threat against Pokemon like Latios and Excadrill. Embody Aspect also gives Ogerpon-C unique defensive properties through Terastallization, with the Defense boost helping to improve the odds of living attacks like Scizor's Bullet Punch, and shedding Ogerpon-C's Grass typing can be handy against opposing Lokix, especially if it is not carrying Spiky Shield.</p> <p>Ogerpon-C fits on a wide variety of teams thanks to its high firepower, as well as its access to Sturdy allowing it to serve as an emergency check to certain threats. Entry hazard setters like Tinkaton and Sandy Shocks are valued teammates, with the chip damage they provide helping Ogerpon-C to have an even easier time securing kills. These Pokemon are also capable of helping to manage foes that may annoy Ogerpon-C such as Latios or Tornadus-T. Pivots such as Slowking and Tornadus-T are also valuable for their ability to get Ogerpon-C in safely. Methods of speed control, such as Sticky Web from Araquanid, or Pokemon that can spread paralysis such as Zapdos, Tinkaton, Slowking, and Rotom-W, are also appreciated to help Ogerpon-C get the jump on faster foes. Choice Specs Latios makes a strong partner, as it can help Ogerpon-C to deal with Kommo-o, and the two can whittle down shared checks like Tinkaton and Scizor. Excadrill also greatly appreciates Ogerpon-C's ability to smash pesky Flying-types, especially Zapdos, and Ogerpon-C greatly benefits from Excadrill's hazard removal allowing it to keep Sturdy intact, as well as the extra support against Iron Crown, which threatens it even through Sturdy thanks to Tachyon Cutter. Powerful revenge killers, such as Lokix, are also appreciated for their ability to deal with Iron Crown and to pick off weakened Pokemon that Ogerpon-C may not be able to finish off.</p>"
