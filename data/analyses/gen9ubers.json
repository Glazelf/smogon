        "description": "<ul> <li>Mewtwo is a niche wallbreaker by courtesy of its access to Nasty Plot and usable Speed stat letting it outspeed Pokemon like Arceus and most Eternatus variants. Its ability to dismantle common defensive Pokemon, like most Arceus formes, and discourage Pokemon like Zacian-C from switching in, makes it a very hard Pokemon to deal with defensively.</li> <li>However, Mewtwo's Speed stat leaves it outsped by common Pokemon like Zacian-C, Koraidon, Miraidon, and Flutter Mane, all of which can heavily damage, if not outright OHKO, it.</li> <li>Grass Knot hits Mewtwo's biggest roadblock in Ting-Lu for massive damage.</li> <li>Flamethrower retains the hit on Zacian-C and Tera Steel Clodsire for big damage while also damaging other Tera Steel Pokemon like Giratina-O.</li> <li>Taunt allows Mewtwo to stop Defog attempts from the likes of Giratina-O and Corviknight while also denying recovery attempts from Skeledirge and Arceus formes. Moreover, Taunt also permits Mewtwo to antilead Ribombee and deny its Sticky Web, being one of the few Pokemon that can accomplish this without losing an important chunk of HP in the process.</li> <li>Earth Power can be used instead to greatly damage Zacian-C, Skeledirge, and tera Steel Pokemon like Clodsire.</li> <li>Tera Steel allows Mewtwo to resist both of Zacian-C's STAB moves while also resisting Extreme Killer Arceus's Extreme Speed, which is particularly important, as Extreme Killer Arceus is a very common offensive answer to Mewtwo.</li> <li>Heavy-Duty Boots allows Mewtwo to ignore entry hazards like Spikes and, most importantly, Toxic Spikes. Leftovers can be used instead as Mewtwo's only form of recovery. Lastly, Life Orb can be used to greatly increase Mewtwo's damage output, allowing it to have a favorable chance of OHKOing Ting-Lu after a Nasty Plot. A Modest nature can be used to ensure Mewtwo OHKOes Ting-Lu and Extreme Killer Arceus at +2 and works best on Sticky Web teams, as on them Mewtwo doesn't mind the loss in Speed and can break holes in teams more easily.</li> <li>It is advised to get Mewtwo on the field via smart double switches or U-turn from teammates like Koraidon, as per its underwhelming defensive typing, it doesn't get many opportunities to freely switch in. Once in the field, Mewtwo should dish out as much damage as possible or use Nasty Plot to break important Pokemon, like Calm Mind Arceus formes. Against faster foes without pivoting moves like Zacian-C, Mewtwo can freely Terastallize into a Steel-type to resist both of its STAB moves and hit back hard with an Earth Power or Flamethrower.</li> <li>Mewtwo struggles against faster foes, like Zacian-C, Koraidon, and Flutter Mane. Because of this, Pokemon like Landorus-T, Skeledirge, and Clodsire make for good partners. Landorus-T and Clodsire in particular help Mewtwo by spreading entry hazards, allowing it to net some KOs that it would normally miss, such as against Arceus-Steel, a Pokemon that now gets OHKOed by a +2 Flamethrower after a single layer of Spikes.</li> </ul>"

It also helps against Calm Mind Arceus, especially Tera Poison variants.</li> <li>Ice Beam hits Pokemon like Giratina-O and Tera Flying users like Zacian-C. Mewtwo can use Tera Fire to resist Tera Flying Zacian-C's STAB moves and OHKO it with Ice Beam after minimal chip damage.</li> <li>Flamethrower hits Zacian-C and Tera Steel users. Koraidon's sun can ensure the OHKO on Zacian-C as well as 2HKO on max HP Arceus.</li> <li>Grass Knot is mainly used for hitting Mewtwo's worst enemy, Ting-Lu. It also hits Arceus-Ground, Kyogre, and Groudon much harder than Ice Beam, potentially scoring OHKOes if they run more offensive spreads.</li> <li>Tera Fire gives Mewtwo useful resistances against common revenge killing options like Koraidon's Flare Blitz and Zacian-C's STAB moves. If sun is active, Tera Fire Flamethrower can 2HKO bulky foes such as Clodsire and Koraidon.</li> <li>Choice Specs Mewtwo's most important partner is Koraidon, usually with Choice Scarf.

  "Kyogre": {
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Choice Scarf Kyogre is a solid form of speed control found on bulky offense teams. Its ability to outspeed Zacian-C and pressure common Pokemon found on bulky archetypes, like Ting-Lu, Corviknight, Skeledirge, and Groudon, gives it a decent offensive presence. Choice Scarf Kyogre can also pressure hyper offense teams because those teams don't run Pokemon naturally faster than it. However, Choice Scarf Kyogre is prediction reliant, as there are a lot of Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks in Ubers, mainly metagame staples like Koraidon, Miraidon, and other defensive Pokemon like Water Absorb Clodsire and Eternatus. Choice Scarf Kyogre is also relatively weak, which means that it'll often be forced to use Tera to power up its attacks; even then, Pokemon like Eternatus and Clodsire will still wall Kyogre.</li> <li>Koraidon is the biggest threat to Kyogre, as it commonly switches into it, takes little damage from its Water-type attacks, and sets sun. Catching Koraidon with Ice Beam is extremely important, as it can make the difference between Kyogre sweeping in the late-game or not. This makes Choice Scarf Kyogre extremely prediction reliant, as one single bad move can mean the entire momentum of the battle is lost.</li> <li>Tera Water boosts Kyogre's Water-type moves to insane levels. For instance, Water Spout now OHKOes max HP Arceus formes that are neutral to Water and 2HKOes Arceus formes that resist Water. It also has a good chance to OHKO Groudon even if sun is active.</li> <li>Kyogre should be brought onto the field via pivoting moves like U-turn from the likes of Koraidon, Miraidon, and Landorus-T. Unless there are Water Absorb Pokemon on the enemy team, Water Spout is a relatively free move to spam; however, hitting Koraidon on the switch with a well-timed Ice Beam can be game-changing.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Kyogre appreciates Pokemon that can wallbreak by themselves. A good teammate for this reason is Miraidon, which shares a common check in Clodsire. Taunt Miraidon in particular can shut down Clodsire completely, as Clodsire will be at half HP after switching into Draco Meteor. Miraidon can also bring Kyogre onto the field via U-turn. Arceus-Ground is another great teammate for Kyogre, as it can keep Pokemon like Eternatus, Clodsire, and Miraidon in check.</li> <li>Pokemon that can check Koraidon, like Arceus-Fairy, Groudon, and Skeledirge, are a must, as Koraidon is one of the most annoying Pokemon in Ubers for Kyogre to deal with: it replaces rain with sun, weakening Kyogre's main attacking moves. They can also set entry hazards and, in Landorus-T's case, bring Kyogre onto the field with U-turn.</li> <li>Entry hazard removers like Giratina-O and Corviknight are appreciated, as Kyogre loses a lot of power when its HP is lowered. Both Pokemon also check threats like Extreme Killer Arceus, which can revenge kill Kyogre with Extreme Speed.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Choice Specs Kyogre is a devastating wallbreaker that can OHKO or 2HKO the entire metagame. However, the ever-present sun set by Koraidon and its relatively low Speed make it harder to use than it may appear, even with its incredible power.</li> <li>Water Spout gives Kyogre the power to OHKO even resistant Pokemon such as Miraidon and Eternatus when paired with Tera Water, and it lets Kyogre claim KOs with ease early on. Ice Beam lets Kyogre hit Koraidon and Clodsire super effectively, cleanly OHKOing the former lacking bulk EVs and 2HKOing the latter. Thunder is Kyogre's strongest option for breaking through bulky Water-types such as Toxapex, Arceus-Water, and opposing Kyogre.</li> <li>Tera Water lets Kyogre perform feats such as OHKOing Miraidon, Toxapex, Arceus-Water, and Eternatus with Water Spout or Origin Pulse with a layer of Spikes up.</li> <li>An alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 Def can be used to take on Arceus formes and switch into defensive Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Landorus-T better.</li> <li>Kyogre fits well on bulky offense. It has trouble getting onto the field and loses a significant part of its power if it takes a hit, so it should be paired with pivots such as Koraidon, Miraidon, and Landorus-T. They can bring Kyogre in on their incoming checks such as Arceus-Fairy and Skeledirge, Arceus-Ground, and Ting-Lu, respectively.</li> <li>Kyogre also greatly appreciates entry hazard removal, such as Defog support from Giratina-O and Corviknight, which keeps Water Spout at full power. Speed control options help Kyogre to wallbreak to its fullest, as it tends to have to take a hit before attacking thanks to its lower Speed, such as Thunder Wave from Arceus, Miraidon, Giratina-O, and Groudon, and Sticky Web from Masquerain.</li> <li>Entry hazards support from Ting-Lu and Clodsire is also appreciated to make sure Kyogre's attacks can cleanly OHKO most of their switch-ins. The aforementioned two Pokemon are also able to check Miraidon and Eternatus, both of which can come in on Kyogre and revenge-kill it. Koraidon can force Kyogre out and can switch into its Water-type attacks, so checks to Koraidon such as Skeledirge, Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Arceus-Fairy are also appreciated. That said, Kyogre can also predict Koraidon coming in and catch it with an Ice Beam, which is a clean OHKO on all Koraidon without bulk EVs.</li> <li>Kyogre can also be used as a solid offensive check to Arceus formes, as it can pivot into a Taunt or a Calm Mind and force them out with a strong Origin Pulse or Water Spout. Kyogre can also pivot into opposing Calm Mind Kyogre, forcing it out with Thunder.</li> </ul>"

Ice Beam lets Kyogre hit Miraidon, Koraidon, Eternatus, and Clodsire super effectively, which would otherwise freely switch into Kyogre. Tera Blast can be used if paired with Tera Ground to break through Clodsire, regardless of whether it has used Tera.</li> <li>Substitute can be used to set up on Clodsire, which cannot break it with Earthquake, and avoid status in general. Rest lets Kyogre repeatedly come in and absorb status, though it must be wary of Miraidon's Hadron Engine setting Electric Terrain.</li> <li>Tera Fairy flips Kyogre's matchup against Eternatus and Koraidon, letting Kyogre freely come in on Dragon-type moves and resist Koraidon's STAB attacks. Tera Ground lets Kyogre set up on Miraidon's Electro Drift, although it cannot take Draco Meteor well without previously having set up. Tera Poison is another option for becoming immune to Toxic from Clodsire, Toxapex, and Eternatus while also resisting Koraidon's Fighting-type attacks.</li> <li>Leftovers provides Kyogre with a form of recovery and gives it more chances to enter the field.</li> <li>The given EV spread lets Kyogre take on physical attackers like Groudon and Koraidon better while outspeeding some paralyzed +1 Arceus formes and paralyzed Zacian-C.</li> <li>Kyogre fits best on balance and bulky offense teams thanks to the defensive utility it provides as well as being a solid late-game wincon.</li> <li>Miraidon is a great partner for non-Rest variants of Kyogre, as it can break through Taunt and Calm Mind Arceus formes and pressure bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Arceus-Water. Miraidon can also use U-turn to bring Kyogre in on Ground-types that it can set up on, such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire. Ting-Lu and Groudon are solid partners for Kyogre, since they can set up Spikes to weaken Kyogre's checks, while also being able to switch into Electric-type attacks that threaten Kyogre. Physical attackers such as Groudon, Arceus-Ground, Chien-Pao, and Koraidon pair well with Kyogre, as they can use Kyogre's checks as an entry for them to start breaking, and Kyogre pressures all of their checks apart from Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Kyogre needs Koraidon eliminated before it can start setting up, as Kyogre is generally forced out by it and its STAB moves are weakened. As such, defensive Pokemon such as Skeledirge, Great Tusk, and Arceus-Fairy are solid partners that check Koraidon effectively. Finally, Kyogre has trouble coming in against faster offense teams, so partners that can pressure these teams such as Choice Scarf Koraidon and Miraidon, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Zacian-C are preferred.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Offensive Calm Mind Kyogre is a decent setup sweeper on offensive and balance teams for its ability to punch big holes in defensive cores for its team to exploit.</li> <li>Ice Beam allows Kyogre to threaten Dragon-types like Koraidon, Miraidon, and Eternatus, which can withstand Kyogre's STAB attacks. Koraidon is a noteworthy target, because it can otherwise easily oppose Kyogre’s rain with its sun. Ice Beam also hits Clodsire, which otherwise completely walls this Kyogre set without Tera Ground Tera Blast.</li> <li>Kyogre can easily spread paralysis with Thunder Wave thanks to it naturally forcing out Ground-types, which is appreciated by slower teams.</li> <li>Thunder lets Kyogre smack defensive Water-types that resist Surf and Ice Beam, like Toxapex and Dondozo, as well as lays waste to opposing Kyogre. It also hits Pokemon that may Terastallize into a Water-type, like Eternatus and Zacian-C.</li> <li>With Tera Ground, Tera Blast can 2HKO Clodsire without setting up, even if it is Terastallized into a Steel-type, while also hitting Toxapex. However, it has very little practical use outside of this.</li> <li>Kyogre has no reliable recovery, so Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred item so it doesn’t get worn down by entry hazards. Leftovers can be used on teams that have reliably hazard control like Giratina-O.</li> <li>Tera Fairy gives Kyogre a Fighting resistance and Dragon immunity, making it impossible for Koraidon to threaten Kyogre in rain.</li> <li>Tera Poison gives Kyogre a Fighting resistance and immunity to Toxic, and also allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes from Eternatus, Toxapex, and Clodsire.</li> <li>Tera Ground gives Kyogre an Electric immunity, letting it avoid Electro Drift from Miraidon and Thunder from opposing Kyogre.</li> <li>Tera Grass, on the other hand, gives Kyogre Ground and Electric resistances, letting it set up on Pokemon it otherwise cannot, like Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Miraidon.</li> <li>This Kyogre set is a good fit on balance teams that struggle against defensive teams, as it is a bulky setup sweeper that can take advantage of common defensive Pokemon like Skeledirge and Ting-Lu to spread paralysis with Thunder Wave.</li> <li>Zacian-C is a fantastic partner, able to threaten many Pokemon commonly used to threaten Kyogre without a Substitute, like Koraidon and Miraidon. Zacian-C also loves Kyogre’s rain neutering its Fire weakness.</li> <li>Koraidon can pivot into Kyogre with U-turn while taking attacks used against Kyogre, like opposing Koraidon’s Flare Blitz when Kyogre is Terastallized and Miraidon’s Electro Drift. Koraidon also loves Kyogre threatening physical checks like Skeledirge, Toxapex, and Groudon.</li> <li>Clodsire lures like Choice Specs Miraidon are great for Kyogre, as Kyogre is completely walled by Clodsire that has Terastallized into a Steel-type if it doesn't have Tera Ground Tera Blast.</li> </ul>"

It is generally not worth using with Life Orb because the combination cuts too much into Rayquaza's already awful longevity.</li> <li>Draco Meteor allows Rayquaza to beat Skeledirge and the rare Dondozo solo without Terastallizing. However, it has little practical use outside of this.</li> <li>A Naive nature should only ever be run when Rayquaza runs Draco Meteor. Jolly is the preferred nature in all other scenarios.</li> <li>Dragon Dance Rayquaza is best used on hyper offense teams that love its ability to punch big holes into bulky teams for its teammates to exploit late-game. Rayquaza is not much of a defensive presence, but it can be used to check dangerous Ground-types like Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground without sacrificing offensive output.</li> <li>Zacian-C forces out or baits Terastallization from Fairy- and Dragon-types that threaten Rayquaza, like Koraidon, Miraidon, and Arceus-Fairy, while being a ferocious offensive threat in its own right. Thus, it is an invaluable partner for Rayquaza.</li> <li>As Dragon Dance Rayquaza fits mainly on hyper offense teams, it should be paired with hyper offense leads like Glimmora and Meowscarada.</li> <li>Physical attackers that appreciate Rayquaza's ability to punch great holes into their checks are good partners for it, as they are made more dangerous late-game with their checks weakened. These include Extreme Killer Arceus, Scale Shot Koraidon, and Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Swords Dance Rayquaza functions as a strong wallbreaker and a potential revenge killer or late-game cleaner thanks to Extreme Speed. Dragon Ascent is Rayquaza's go-to move with which it can 2HKO Skeledirge, Giratina-O, and most Arceus formes.</li> <li>Earthquake is a valuable coverage move that allows Rayquaza to hit Flying-resistant foes like Zacian-C and Miraidon for massive damage.</li> <li>Swords Dance allows Rayquaza to turn the aforementioned 2HKOs into OHKOs and 2HKO Corviknight with Dragon Ascent.</li> <li>Extreme Speed allows Rayquaza to pick off weakened targets or even sweep with the combination of Tera Normal and Swords Dance. After a Swords Dance, Tera Normal Extreme Speed can OHKO even Koraidon and Miraidon.</li> <li>Life Orb is crucial for this set because it gives Rayquaza the necessary power boost to score OHKOs and 2HKOs that it needs to.</li> <li>Jolly is necessary because it allows Rayquaza to get the jump on foes like the plethora of base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Kyogre as well as suicide leads such as Glimmora. On Sticky Web teams it's even more important because Adamant Rayquaza can't outrun -1 Speed Zacian-C.</li> <li>Swords Dance Rayquaza fits on more offensive teams where it can switch in on defensive Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire. Rayquaza pairs exceptionally well with Sticky Web setters such as Ribombee, as they let it outspeed Zacian-C, previously faster Arceus formes, and non-Choice Scarf Koraidon and Miraidon, which can all be OHKOed after a Swords Dance.</li> <li>Rayquaza also pairs well with Extreme Killer Arceus and Kingambit because together they form a priority core that gives their team a very reliable safety net against common sweepers like Koraidon and Miraidon. Rayquaza also appreciates Taunt users like Miraidon and Arceus because they can prevent foes from setting up hazards or healing to try to stay out of range of Rayquaza's attacks.</li> </ul>"

      "Suicide Lead": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Rayquaza has a niche as a suicide lead over other Pokemon like Glimmora thanks to its base 150 Attack and Special Attack stats. This allows it to beat other common leads like the aforementioned Glimmora, as Draco Meteor ignores Toxic Debris, and Ribombee while also threatening other Pokemon, mainly physically bulky Pokemon like Landorus-T that are annoying to its teammates.</li> <li>Unfortunately for Rayquaza, the prevalence of Taunt Arceus hinders its ability to consistently lay down entry hazards. Furthermore, Scale Shot Koraidon is very common and is an effective anti-lead that beats Rayquaza. Other Pokemon like Zacian-C also take advantage of Rayquaza not being able to hit it with a super effective move and heavily threaten the opposing team. Lastly, Calm Mind variants of Arceus are bulky enough to utilize Rayquaza as setup fodder and freely boost themselves without much threat.</li> <li>Draco Meteor with maximum Special Attack investment allows Rayquaza to lure in and 2HKO common physical walls, such as Landorus-T, Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Groudon.</li> <li>Tera Fairy allows Rayquaza to be immune to Dragon-type attacks, with the most notable example being Scale Shot from Koraidon; this gives Rayquaza an opportunity to deal huge damage on Koraidon without sacrificing HP or abilities on important teammates like Zacian-C's Intrepid Sword. However, it's not entirely advised to Terastallize immediately, as it must be saved as an emergency option only.</li> <li>Rayquaza is a suicide lead that must prioritize setting entry hazards while dealing damage if the situation presents it. Other common hyper offense leads, like Ribombee and Glimmora, lose the one-on-one against Rayquaza, which means that only dedicated teams with Pokemon like Taunt Arceus and dual screens Grimmsnarl can beat and annoy Rayquaza.</li> <li>Rayquaza fits best on hyper offense teams with teammates that appreciate Stealth Rock being set and physically bulky Pokemon being heavily damaged. As a result, Koraidon, Zacian-C, and physical Arceus formes are good teammates. Zacian-C in particular helps Rayquaza against Scale Shot Koraidon, one Pokemon that can outright OHKO Rayquaza even through Focus Sash. Flutter Mane is another Fairy-type Pokemon that can help with Scale Shot Koraidon while also dealing with the Taunt Arceus formes that annoy Rayquaza and its team. Rayquaza cannot prevent Pokemon like Ribombee and Glimmora from getting their own entry hazards up; therefore, Pokemon that can remove them, like Great Tusk and Iron Treads, are good partners.</li> </ul>"

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Gliscor is a great pivot in Ubers thanks to its many positive traits. Poison Heal grants it excellent passive recovery and a status immunity, meaning that it can sit on Pokemon like non-Ice Beam Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground, Groudon, Clodsire, Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Ting-Lu, after its Toxic Orb has been activated. Its excellent bulk lets it tank hits from and trade hits with metagame beasts like Zacian-C and Koraidon, with Protect giving Gliscor the ability to scout moves and stay healthy throughout the game. Lastly, its very useful Ground immunity lets it annoy common Ground-type Pokemon like Groudon and Landorus-T while also being Spikes-immune.</li> <li>Unfortunately for Gliscor, its low base Special Defense means it gets exploited and forced out by many common special attackers, namely Kyogre, Miraidon, Flutter Mane, and Calm Mind Arceus formes. The aforementioned Zacian-C and Koraidon can also overwhelm Gliscor after a Swords Dance, forcing it to Terastallize to not succumb to their attacks. Lastly, Gliscor's offenses are mediocre, meaning that Taunt Pokemon like Arceus formes and Koraidon can effectively shut it down, as they take very little damage from Earthquake.</li> <li>Gliscor is a good user of Spikes, as it commonly annoys most Defog and Rapid Spin Pokemon, such as Giratina-O and Great Tusk, with Toxic. Corviknight stands out as the only Pokemon that is immune to Toxic, is immune to Earthquake, and can stall out Spikes with Defog and Pressure.</li> <li>Knock Off can be used instead to cripple Pokemon like Landorus-T, Kyogre, and Ting-Lu, as well as opposing Gliscor if it doesn't use Protect before its Toxic Orb has been activated. Knock Off can also cripple Heavy-Duty Boots Pokemon like Eternatus, and it is best used with Pokemon that can lay Spikes, like Ting-Lu and Clodsire, both of which appreciate Gliscor's ability to cripple and wear down hazard removal Pokemon like Giratina-O. However, with Arceus formes everywhere in the tier, which can absorb Knock Off without losing their items, Knock Off is usually unable to cripple most Pokemon. Nonetheless, said Arceus formes still fear Toxic from Gliscor.</li> <li>Lastly, Taunt is also an option for Gliscor to deny entry hazard attempts from slower Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, opposing uninvested Gliscor, and Clodsire while also denying recovery from Arceus formes and Clodsire on the switch.</li> <li>The given spread lets Gliscor outspeed uninvested base 100 Speed Pokemon. The remaining EVs maximize bulk, allowing Gliscor to avoid the 2HKO and OHKO from Zacian-C's +1 and +3 Behemoth Blade, respectively.</li> <li>Another possible EV spread is 244 HP / 80 Def / 140 SpD / 44 Spe with a Careful nature. This makes Gliscor able to survive an unboosted Ice Beam from support Arceus formes from full, letting it use Toxic on them. This can come in handy, as support Arceus formes can be an annoyance to the teams Gliscor usually sees play in. However, this spread leaves Gliscor 2HKOed and OHKOed by a +1 and +3 Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C, respectively, and OHKOed by +2 Scale Shot from Koraidon.</li> <li>Tera Water lets Gliscor resist the Water- and Ice-type attacks that are commonly thrown at it such as Ice Beam from Arceus-Ground, Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I, and Kyogre's moves. Tera Water also allows it to resist Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade and Koraidon's Flare Blitz, which is equally important. However, Terastallizing leaves Gliscor unable to switch into Ground-type Pokemon like Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground. Furthermore, it makes Gliscor become affected by Spikes and take super effective damage from Miraidon's Electro Drift instead of being immune to it.</li> <li>Gliscor wants to activate its Toxic Orb as soon as possible in order to continuously be able to check and switch in on threats, so it is advised to quickly get it in the field and use Protect to ensure it gets poisoned. Gliscor is an annoyance for teams that have multiple physical attackers like Koraidon and Zacian-C, so its HP should be preserved in order to comfortably tank their hits. However, Gliscor should not be the only switch-in to the aforementioned Pokemon, as it can get overwhelmed fairly easily, due to them commonly running Swords Dance.</li> <li>Gliscor's Special Defense is on the lower side, with Pokemon like Calm Mind Arceus formes, Miraidon, Kyogre, and Eternatus taking advantage of this to wreak havoc with powerful attacks or, in Eternatus's case, threaten to set Toxic Spikes. Because of this, Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Water Absorb Clodsire are recommended teammates. Pokemon like Arceus-Water and Kyogre can take on the Ice-type attacks that OHKO Gliscor while also helping it not get potentially overwhelmed by Koraidon and Zacian-C.</li> </ul>"

Levitate grants it an invaluable immunity to the ever-present Spikes, allowing it to work as a wallbreaker that demands other kind of counterplay, like the less common Stealth Rock.</li> <li>However, Giratina-O gets outsped by the entirety of the offensive metagame. While strong, Giratina-O doesn't achieve any notable OHKOs, thus many common Pokemon like Landorus-T, Zacian-C, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Koraidon can pivot around it with relative ease. Giratina-O might also be forced to Terastallize to perform its role as a utility Pokemon due to the relevance of Toxic Pokemon like Clodsire and Gliscor, as well as the existence of faster threats like Zacian-C, Koraidon, Miraidon, and Flutter Mane. Terastallizing is a huge commitment, and Giratina-O more often than not is doing it to be able to perform consistently. Lastly, Giratina-O has a big longevity issue, which can make it struggle in checking the Pokemon it's supposed to, making it fit only on certain styles of teams that can make up for its non-existent recovery with teammates like Wish Alomomola.</li> <li>Thunder Wave can help Giratina-O spread paralysis for itself and its teammates, giving it a form of speed control. With the given EV spread, Giratina-O can take a hit from Zacian-C and potentially paralyze it, which is game-changing. However, it's not a common occurrence, as Giratina-O must be at full HP to accomplish this. Thunder Wave is also unable to paralyze common switch-ins to Giratina-O like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T. As a result, another option to run is Will-O-Wisp, which completely ruins Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, and Clodsire, while also annoying other switch-ins, namely Arceus formes like Fairy.</li> <li>Shadow Sneak gives Giratina-O a tool to revenge kill Flutter Mane, Tera Ghost Pokemon like Koraidon, and low HP targets like Zacian-C. If this is not needed, however, Giratina-O can effectively run Defog thanks to its positive matchup against common entry hazard setters.</li> <li>The given EV spread permits Giratina-O to live one Play Rough from +1 Zacian-C from full HP. It also gives Giratina-O very favorable chances to avoid the 2HKO from Ice Beam from non-Choice Specs Kyogre. The Speed allows Giratina-O to outspeed uninvested Gliscor, and the remaining EVs are slotted into Attack so that Giratina-O always 2HKOes Zacian-C with Poltergeist.</li> <li>Tera Steel allows Giratina-O to check Pokemon like Koraidon, Miraidon, Zacian-C, and Flutter Mane. It also lets Giratina-O annoy Arceus-Fairy one-on-one and beat Calm Mind Arceus-Ground while making it immune to Toxic from the likes of Gliscor and Clodsire. Tera Poison can be used instead, as it still gives Giratina-O a Fairy-type resistance and poison immunity, but it also gives a new resistance to Fighting that can let it take on Koraidon. This, however, leaves Giratina-O unable to check Zacian-C and resist Dragon-type attacks.</li> <li>Giratina-O fits best on bulky offense teams that need a way to deal with Ground-type Pokemon like Arceus-Ground and Groudon and can't afford to run passive checks to them like Corviknight. Once on the field, Giratina-O can make use of its powerful STAB moves to hit everything in the tier at least for neutral damage; however, be aware that Poltergeist has only 8 PP, meaning that while it's Giratina-O's main way of dealing damage, it should not be used recklessly, as it can get PP stalled with smart pivoting, especially by teams that have Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Extreme Killer Arceus.</li> <li>Giratina-O is forced out by common Pokemon like Zacian-C, Koraidon, and Miraidon. It can also be overwhelmed by very strong Ice-type attacks from the likes of Calyrex-I and Choice Specs Kyogre. Pokemon like Kyogre can help Giratina-O against Calyrex-I and Koraidon, while the likes of Clodsire can help against Miraidon. Other Pokemon like Skeledirge and Arceus-Fairy can help Giratina-O against Zacian-C and Koraidon, respectively. Lastly, Pokemon that can help against Ting-Lu, like Arceus-Fairy and Gliscor, are also good teammates, as Ting-Lu's Ruination threatens to put a severe dent in Giratina-O's HP, and Ting-Lu can freely use Spikes against Giratina-O.</li> </ul>"

Giratina-O's Ground immunity gives it excellent opportunities to switch in on the ever-present Spikes, which allows it to act as somewhat of a wallbreaker that also happens to give Defog support, as most defensive teams will only have said Spikes as way of dealing with wallbreakers, which Giratina-O is immune to.</li> <li>However, Giratina-O's strongest attack is Draco Meteor; this makes Giratina-O prone to be taken advantage by setup sweepers like Tera Fairy Miraidon, Zacian-C, Kyogre, and Flutter Mane. Hex is also a very weak move if the foe is not statused, meaning that Giratina-O will not be attacking for the majority of the early- to mid-game and instead, it'll be spreading status conditions and using Defog. Lastly, Giratina-O's poor Speed leaves it outsped by the likes of Koraidon and Arceus formes.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp spreads status to empower Hex and annoy Pokemon like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and most Arceus formes that will regularly be switching into Giratina-O.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Giratina-O to avoid being 2HKOed by any of Kyogre's attacks without Stealth Rock while outspeeding 0 Speed Gliscor. The remaining EVs maximize Special Attack for Giratina-O to hit as hard as possible.</li> <li>Tera Steel allows Giratina-O to check Pokemon like Flutter Mane. It also lets Giratina-O annoy Calm Mind Arceus formes while making it immune to Toxic from the likes of Gliscor and Clodsire. Tera Fairy can be used instead for Giratina-O to become immune to the Dragon-type attacks that will be aimed at it from Koraidon, Miraidon, and opposing Giratina-O.</li> <li>Giratina-O fits best on bulky offense teams that need a way to battle Ground-type Pokemon like Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground and Groudon, and also need a hazard removal Pokemon. If using Defog is not needed, Giratina-O can instead spread status with Will-O-Wisp and launch Draco Meteors to dent Pokemon like Ting-Lu.</li> <li>Giratina-O wants to be paired with physical attackers like Koraidon, Zacian-C, Arceus-Ground, and Calyrex-I that can deal with the walls that annoy it. In return, Giratina-O can deal with the physically bulky Pokemon, like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Landorus-T, that annoy them. Clodsire and Ting-Lu are good teammates as well, as they take on Pokemon that Giratina-O can't, like Miraidon and Choice Specs Kyogre in Clodsire's case.</li> </ul>"

However, the loss of bulk is very noticeable.</li> <li>Tera Water allows Arceus-Fairy to have a better matchup against not only Fire-type moves like Flare Blitz from Tera Fire Koraidon, but also Ice-type Pokemon like Calyrex-Ice and Chien-Pao. It also turns Arceus-Fairy's Steel-type weakness into a resistance, which can come in handy against Zacian-C, especially if Arceus-Fairy is running a status move.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy will be regularly switching in, as thanks to its good typing and stats it can, at the very minimum, soft check Pokemon like Koraidon. Koraidon needs to use Tera Fire in order to beat Arceus-Fairy one-on-one, which in general is a positive trade for Arceus-Fairy's team.</li> <li>That being said, Arceus-Fairy appreciates teammates like Skeledirge, Groudon, and Toxapex, as they also check Koraidon and can help Arceus-Fairy against other threats like Zacian-C. Groudon in particular is a good teammate, as it forms an hazard-stacking combination with Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Pokemon with access to Taunt like Miraidon and Koraidon are also good teammates for Arceus-Fairy, as they can, combine with it to shut down walls like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Toxapex and win the entry hazard game.</li> <li>Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Clodsire can also provide entry hazard support for Arceus-Fairy while checking Pokemon that can overwhelm it like Miraidon, and, in Clodsire's case, Flutter Mane and Eternatus.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Arceus-Fairy is one of the best setup sweepers in the tier thanks to its very good bulk, typing, access to utility moves like Will-O-Wisp that discourage common Arceus-Fairy checks like Zacian-C from switching into it, and STAB move that nothing is immune to. What differentiates Arceus-Fairy from other Calm Mind Arceus formes is its Dragon immunity, which grants it an invaluable defensive niche against some of the metagame's top threats, like Koraidon, and its Judgment being at least a neutral hit on the vast majority of the metagame, as Pokemon that resist Fairy are scarce.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Arceus-Fairy to outspeed Adamant Rayquaza while maximizing bulk. This allows Arceus-Fairy to avoid the 2HKO from Pokemon like Choice Scarf Koraidon and Jolly Life Orb Rayquaza.</li> <li>Tera Poison is essential to prevent Clodsire and Eternatus from poisoning Arceus-Fairy with Toxic; it also allows Arceus-Fairy to absorb Toxic Spikes. It also retains Arceus-Fairy's ability to check Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Koraidon in a pinch, which can be useful for pivoting. In conjunction with Will-O-Wisp, Tera Poison Arceus-Fairy can potentially take on Zacian-C one-on-one if it has enough Calm Mind boosts.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy should be spreading Will-O-Wisp before attempting to sweep, as Pokemon like Clodsire and Zacian-C can stop Arceus-Fairy on its tracks before it accomplishes anything. Arceus-Fairy can be overwhelmed fairly easily by strong powerhouses like Tera Fire Koraidon and Choice Specs Miraidon, so taking care of them first before attempting to sweep is advised.</li> <li>Skeledirge is the best counter to Arceus-Fairy, as it ignores Calm Mind boosts with Unaware, can break through it with Torch Song, and is naturally immune to Will-O-Wisp. Because of this, Pokemon like Eternatus, Kyogre, Miraidon, and Clodsire are good teammates, as they can comfortably sit on Skeledirge and force it out.</li> <li>Pokemon like Skeledirge can check Zacian-C and Koraidon for Arceus-Fairy and spread burns with Will-O-Wisp; the combination of Skeledirge + Arceus-Fairy checks Koraidon pretty well. Similarly, Landorus-T can act as a soft check to Koraidon and Zacian-C that can also provide both entry hazard and Taunt support. Pokemon that can check special attackers for Arceus-Fairy, like Ting-Lu and Clodsire, are recommended, as they also can set up entry hazards on the field for Arceus-Fairy to have an easier time sweeping late-game.</li> </ul>"

This includes Ice-type attacks such as Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I and Ice Beam from specially offensive Arceus formes, as well as Fairy- and Dragon-type attacks from Arceus-Fairy, Miraidon, and Koraidon.</li> <li>Swords Dance combined with Intrepid Sword skyrockets Zacian-C's Attack, allowing it to OHKO most Pokemon in the tier that don't resist its STAB attacks. Substitute is an option that should be used exclusively on hyper offense teams, allowing Zacian-C to generate momentum on a predicted switch into a check like Skeledirge.</li> <li>While Intrepid Sword allows Zacian-C to threaten to KO many staples in the tier such as Arceus-Fairy, Kyogre, and Eternatus, Intrepid Sword only working once per battle means that one should think twice before sending Zacian-C onto the field, as wasting its ability makes for massive loss in damage output.</li> <li>Tera Blast can be used in conjunction with Tera Ground or Tera Water as a way to 2HKO Skeledirge. Wild Charge can be used instead to deal with Toxapex, Corviknight, defensive Kyogre, and Arceus-Water. Tera Electric strengthens Wild Charge even more, allowing Zacian-C to break through Dondozo, while OHKOing Kyogre at +2. It also lets Zacian-C survive a Behemoth Blade from opposing Zacian-C at +3.</li> <li>Crunch offers more flexibility, as it hits Skeledirge for super effective damage without relying on Terastallization. A Defense drop on the switch can also force it out. Tera Dark can be used in combination with Crunch, as it then 2HKOes Skeledirge.</li> <li>Tera Fire allows Zacian-C to take on Skeledirge and Arceus-Fairy more comfortably, making it immune to Will-O-Wisp and giving it a resistance to Fire.</li> <li>Tera Flying is another great tool to take Ground-types that would otherwise offensively check Zacian-C, like Groudon and Arceus-Ground, by surprise, transforming its weakness into an immunity and allowing Zacian-C to have a crucial free turn to beat its would-be checks.</li> <li>Tera Ground and Tera Water let Zacian-C 2HKO Skeledirge on the switch with Tera Blast and allow it to survive previously super effective moves like Groudon's Precipice Blades, Arceus-Ground's Judgment at +1, and Arceus's Earthquake at +2.</li> <li>Zacian-C's excellent traits make it one of the best choices for bulky offense and hyper offense teams. Its blistering Speed lets it revenge kill many unboosted tier staples such as Koraidon, Miraidon, Arceus, and Eternatus. Its excellent Fairy typing also lets it check Choice Scarf Miraidon and Koraidon locked into a Dragon-type attack, and its high physical firepower makes it one of the best wallbreakers at forcing Calm Mind Arceus variants out.</li> <li>Zacian-C has trouble breaking through physical walls like Groudon, Skeledirge, Corviknight, and Toxapex, which makes Miraidon a good teammate, as it threatens to OHKO them with its powerful STAB moves. Hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Groudon also make for good partners, as they help to put Zacian-C's targets into OHKO range. Ting-Lu can also check Miraidon sets, while Groudon is a good check to most Koraidon sets.</li> <li>Kyogre makes for a good teammate, as it sets rain that reduces the damage Zacian-C takes from Fire-type attacks while also boosting Tera Blast Water, allowing Zacian-C to 2HKO Tera Fairy Skeledirge.</li> <li>Choice Band Koraidon is a particularly strong partner for Zacian-C, as it can force Skeledirge to commit to using Tera Fairy due to Dragon Claw being able to 2HKO it otherwise, letting Zacian-C pressure it heavily with Behemoth Blade. In return, if Zacian-C forces Skeledirge to commit to using Tera Fairy, Choice Band Koraidon can then threaten to OHKO it with a Tera Fire- and Orichalcum Pulse-boosted Flare Blitz. Choice Scarf Outrage Koraidon can also accomplish this while providing speed control against opposing Zacian-C, Choice Scarf Kyogre, and Dragon Dance Arceus.</li> </ul>"

Toxic Spikes can be useful to pressure the opposing team, especially with smart double switches. In either case, the loss of Flamethrower leaves Eternatus more passive generally.</li> <li>Sludge Bomb is much less reliable at setting poison than Toxic is; however, it allows Eternatus to have a chance against Calm Mind Tera Fairy Kyogre sets, which may otherwise use Substitute to block Toxic.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Eternatus to outspeed base 120 Speed Pokemon like Arceus and Palkia-O, with the rest of the EVs dumped into bulk.</li> <li>Heavy-Duty Boots is optimal on teams lacking entry hazard removal, while Leftovers works better when Eternatus is paired with Giratina-O or Corviknight.</li> <li>Tera Fairy is used, as its Dragon-type immunity is useful against Koraidon and Miraidon, and it provides a neutrality to Ice. Tera Water provides Eternatus with a resistance to Ice, making it much more reliable against Kyogre sets lacking Thunder, and a resistance to Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade.</li> <li>Eternatus is very difficult to switch into generally, since it has strong neutral coverage and can poison most switch-ins. Its most reliable checks are Clodsire, Blissey, and Arceus-Poison, all of which don't care about being poisoned and can use Eternatus as a free setup opportunity. Exerting enough offensive pressure helps deal with these threats.</li> <li>Eternatus works well as a third or fourth pokemon on defensive cores, since it absorbs Toxic Spikes and takes on the aforementioned Arceus formes and Kyogre. Ting-Lu makes for a fantastic partner as a result.</li> <li>On teams lacking entry hazard removal, Skeledirge is a great partner, since both Pokemon can use Heavy-Duty Boots and have reliable recovery.</li> <li>Switch-ins to Ground-types are much appreciated such as Corviknight, Giratina-O, and Landorus-T.

Caution should be taken when using it, because while it is able to KO Koraidon from full health, it is not guaranteed to KO Miraidon and it doesn't even have a chance to do so against opposing Eternatus. That is why Draco Meteor can be used as a secondary option.</li> <li>Sludge Bomb functions similarly to Dynamax Cannon, except that it can be used to hit Arceus-Fairy and Tera Fairy users super effectively.</li> <li>Fire moves are used to hit Steel-types that resist both of Eternatus's STAB moves. Fire Blast can OHKO Zacian-C in sun, and it does much more damage than Flamethrower in general. However, Flamethrower's accuracy makes it more consistent.</li> <li>Toxic can be used to put non-immune checks on a timer, such as Ting-Lu and many Arceus formes.</li> <li>Modest is preferred to heavily increase Eternatus's odds to OHKO Zacian-C with a sun-boosted Flamethrower and guarantee an OHKO on Miraidon with Dynamax Cannon. Timid can be used for the greater consistency against Dragon Dance Arceus and ability to Speed tie other Choice Scarf Eternatus.</li> <li>Tera Ghost is used for the Extreme Speed immunity and turning all of Eternatus's weaknesses into neutralities, which helps when facing off against Choice Scarf Koraidon or Miraidon.</li> <li>Tera Fairy can be used to gain a Dragon-type immunity, which can preserve all of its health in the face of opposing Dragon-type attacks, probably thrown out by Choice Scarf Koraidon.</li> <li>Tera Dragon provides a boost to Eternatus's Dragon-type moves. To use this boost as effectively as possible, Tera Dragon should be used with both Dynamax Cannon and Draco Meteor in Eternatus's moveset.</li> <li>Tera Steel can provide a resistance to Zacian-C's STAB moves, Extreme Speed, and Dragon-type attacks; however, this leaves Eternatus extremely vulnerable to Choice Scarf Koraidon.</li> <li>Terastallization with Eternatus should be avoided early-game, as Eternatus loses its ability to absorb Toxic Spikes.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Eternatus can fit well on any type of team in need of a Toxic Spikes absorber and speed control in a single team slot, although it is generally a better fit on offensive teams.</li> </ul>"

Hex pairs very well with Will-O-Wisp, becoming a 130-Base Power STAB move.

Ting-Lu and Iron Treads both help with Miraidon, and Pokemon like Great Tusk, Scream Tail, and Skeledirge can provide defensive solidity against Koraidon.</li> <li>This Palafin set functions best with a sturdy defensive backbone alongside it, to mitigate the impact of Zero to Hero.

Stealth Rock is usually preferred for limiting Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Iron Bundle, but Spikes can be used if your team already has a Stealth Rock setter.

This is coupled with its access to Swords Dance, which not only enhances its already strong late-game but also gives it a tool to break holes in the opposing team during the early- and mid-game without needing teammates to faint. Kingambit's typing also allows it to be, at the very minimum, a one-time switch-in to very threatening Pokemon to the offensive teams it usually sees play in, like Flutter Mane.</li> <li>Unfortunately, the prevalence of Tera Fairy in the metagame means that Sucker Punch will, most of the time, be resisted. This, coupled with the fast-paced nature of the metagame, makes Kingambit a relatively slow and ineffective revenge killer when unboosted. Koraidon and Zacian-C are top-tier threats that resist Kingambit's Dark-type STAB attacks and can OHKO or heavily dent it. Lastly, Intimidate Landorus-T helps opposing offensive teams pivot into Kingambit more easily, especially if Kingambit is not running Leftovers, as it will not passively heal the damage it takes from foes pivoting out</li> <li>The listed EV spread allows Kingambit to outspeed Skeledirge while maximizing its offensive prowess. The HP EVs help Kingambit tank hits from Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Calm Mind Arceus a little better, giving it a favorable chance to avoid the 2HKO from Judgment and Earth Power from Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Low Kick hits Koraidon hard while also allowing Kingambit to hit Pokemon like Tera Steel Giratina-O and Extreme Killer Arceus supereffectively. However, this leaves Kingambit hopelessly walled by Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Tera Dark empowers Kingambit's Dark-type STAB attacks to absurd levels, giving it a chance to OHKO Koraidon with 5 fainted allies after a Swords Dance. Tera Dark also removes Kingambit's Ground-type weakness, allowing it to boost itself or hit Pokemon like Landorus-T more comfortably. Tera Flying is another option that makes Kingambit immune to Ground-type attacks, giving it the opportunity to freely set up or hit Pokemon like non-Whirlwind Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, Groudon, and Gliscor, while also giving it a resistance to Koraidon's Fighting-type attacks and a neutrality to its Flare Blitz. Tera Fire gives Kingambit a resistance to both of Zacian-C's STAB types and an immunity to burn from Pokemon like Groudon, Alomomola, and Skeledirge, the last of which can also leverage Tera Fairy to resist Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave.</li> <li>Kingambit fits best on offensive teams, as they can weaken opposing Pokemon to the point where Kingambit sweeping is likely. Teammates like Koraidon, Zacian-C, Miraidon, Flutter Mane, and Arceus can help Kingambit by weakening its checks and breaking holes. Kingambit can revenge kill and potentially sweep through the broken holes in return. Spikes from Pokemon like Groudon and Meowscarada can weaken Zacian-C and Koraidon for Kingambit. Lastly, Pokemon that can switch in on Landorus-T, like Calm Mind Arceus formes, are also good partners, as Kingambit doesn't appreciate taking Rocky Helmet damage.</li> </ul>"

Earthquake may be used as the Ground-type STAB move to avoid defensive drops, but it is a weaker move, and it can't secure important OHKOs and 2HKOs at +1 Attack against some physical walls such as Toxapex, Scream Tail, and Alomomola.</li> <li>A Jolly nature is used to outspeed all viable unboosted Pokemon after one Rapid Spin. An Adamant nature makes Great Tusk stronger while still letting it outspeed unboosted Iron Bundle at +1 Speed, but it misses out on outspeeding maximum Speed Gholdengo and tying Jolly Great Tusk.</li> <li>Terastallizing into the Ground typing boosts Headlong Rush and guarantees some additional OHKOs and 2HKOs on foes like Toxapex and Scream Tail. Additionally, getting rid of the Fighting typing lets Great Tusk survive Fairy-type attacks such as Dazzling Gleam from Miraidon and Moonblast from Flutter Mane without Life Orb or Choice Specs, and it facilitates taking Dazzling Gleam and Play Rough from Scream Tail and Alomomola.</li> <li>Alternatively, using Tera Steel gives Great Tusk resistances to Fairy-type attacks, Ice-type attacks from Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle, and Draco Meteor from Miraidon, allowing it to surprise them with a strong attack.</li> <li>Koraidon is a solid partner because its sun activates Great Tusk's Protosynthesis, making its attacks even stronger.

Great Tusk also pairs well with Miraidon, as non-Heavy-Duty Boots Miraidon appreciates it removing entry hazards and taking on Clodsire, Iron Treads, and Ting-Lu.

Both Flutter Mane and Koraidon also wear down Arceus-Fairy and Toxapex for each other, making them a very potent core. Flutter Mane also pairs well with Kyogre, as they both pressure a similar subset of checks in Eternatus, Koraidon, Clodsire, and Toxapex. Kyogre can also switch into Choice Scarf Koraidon's Flare Blitz if Flutter Mane doesn't want to risk a Speed tie. Since Flutter Mane is such a potent wallbreaker, it appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Groudon. Groudon in particular is a very potent partner for checking the physical attackers that can take advantage of Flutter Mane while also setting sun for it. Miraidon and Eternatus are other good partners for appreciating Flutter Mane potentially breaking through Ting-Lu and Clodsire.</li> <li>Flutter Mane primarily has issues entering the field versus physical attackers such as Zacian-C, Arceus formes, and Kingambit. As a result, Pokemon such as Groudon, Skeledirge, Toxapex, and Landorus-T pair well with it by checking the aforementioned Pokemon.

Its most notable use is to scout for enemy Tera types.</li> <li>Mystical Fire nails Steel-types like Zacian-C and Corviknight, which otherwise wall Flutter Mane. Mystical Fire notably has a chance to OHKO Zacian-C at +1 in the sun.</li> <li>Psyshock obliterates Clodsire, which otherwise walls this set. Additionally, it comes in handy against Calm Mind Arceus formes that may Terastallize into the Poison typing to resist a predicted Moonblast.</li> <li>Tera Fairy powers up Flutter Mane's strongest attack in Moonblast, letting it OHKO Ting-Lu after a Calm Mind.</li> <li>Koraidon is a near necessity as a teammate, setting the sun to activate Protosynthesis. Choice Scarf Koraidon in particular is a great teammate, as it can bring Flutter Mane in easily on common switch-ins such as Skeledirge and Landorus-T. Koraidon also helps break down shared checks such as Arceus formes and Kyogre.</li> <li>Additional special attackers such as Miraidon and Kyogre can assist in overwhelming common specially bulky Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Arceus formes, making them good teammates.</li> <li>Despite its pathetic Defense stat and Life Orb recoil, Flutter Mane offers legitimate defensive utility for teams thanks to its myriad of immunities as well as its decent Special Defense. It features as a prominent Dragon-type switch-in on teams that forgo Zacian-C or Arceus-Fairy, which is especially helpful for Miraidon. Its Normal- and Fighting-type immunities come in handy for both Koraidon and Extreme Killer Arceus. It should be noted, however, that switching into these is very high-risk, high-reward, as while Flutter Mane can take great advantage of its immunities, a wrong prediction will result in an easy OHKO for the opponent.</li> <li>Flutter Mane's extremely threatening nature and low defenses mean that it often forces a reactionary Tera from the opponent, often Tera Fire from Koraidon or Zacian-C or Tera Poison from Arceus formes. Care should be taken to not risk Flutter Mane in such situations when it isn't needed.</li> </ul>"

The remaining 36 Special Defense EVs improve Roaring Moon's chances to survive Iron Bundle's Ice Beam after Stealth Rock while giving it a chance to survive Overheat in sun from Modest Choice Specs Chi-Yu.</li> <li>Tera Dark strengthens Roaring Moon's Crunch to the point where it always 2HKOs physically defensive Corviknight and always 3HKOs Dondozo while easing predictions with Earthquake against Garganacl.</li> <li>Tera Steel lets Roaring Moon resist otherwise super effective Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Iron Bundle, Flutter Mane, Koraidon, and Miraidon. Tera Steel also powers up Roaring Moon's Iron Head.</li> <li>Tera Fairy allows Roaring Moon to resist Fighting-type attacks while becoming immune to Dragon-type attacks, letting it defeat Koraidon and Iron Valiant, both of which outspeed and threaten to OHKO Roaring Moon otherwise.</li> <li>Roaring Moon loves the support of Koraidon, as it activates Roaring Moon's Protosynthesis via Orichalcum Pulse and reliably threatens Pokemon such as Koraidon, Miraidon, and Ice-types like Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle. In return, Roaring Moon threatens non-Terastallized Skeledirge.</li> <li>Koraidon and Roaring Moon both struggle with defensive Great Tusk, so they can team up with Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao, which threaten all Great Tusk sets. Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao also threaten Koraidon and Miraidon, with Iron Bundle naturally outspeeding non-Choice Scarf variants and Chien-Pao threatening them with priority Ice Shard.</li> <li>Defensive Great Tusk and Ting-Lu also work well with Roaring Moon, as they can set up entry hazards for Roaring Moon's team and check Koraidon and Miraidon, respectively. Great Tusk in particular can use Rapid Spin, giving Roaring Moon more opportunities to switch in, while Ting-Lu can phaze threatening boosters like Espathra with Whirlwind and set up Spikes.</li> <li>Specially defensive Corviknight can check Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle, both of which outspeed and threaten Roaring Moon, and can Defog hazards away, giving Roaring Moon more opportunities to switch in.</li> <li>Roaring Moon can easily pivot into Chi-Yu, which takes advantage of the sun set by Koraidon and threatens walls like Great Tusk, Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Terastallized Skeledirge.</li> <li>Gholdengo also makes for a decent partner, as not only does it have perfect defensive synergy with Roaring Moon, but it can also reliably block all common forms of hazard removal.

This can force it to use Tera Fairy, which Zacian-C can take advantage of.</li> <li>U-turn allows Koraidon to take advantage of predictable switches to Skeledirge or Groudon and bring in dangerous wallbreakers, such as Flutter Mane, Chi-Yu, Walking Wake, or Kyogre. Be careful not to use U-turn too much when facing Rocky Helmet users like Toxapex.</li> <li>Flare Blitz hits targets like Arceus-Fairy hard, especially when boosted by Tera Fire. Tera Fire also prevents burns from Skeledirge or Giratina-O and gives Koraidon a useful Fairy resistance.</li> <li>Tera Steel is a good option for the myriad of resistances it brings, most notably Normal for E-Killer Arceus, Dragon for opposing Koraidon or Miraidon, and Fairy against Arceus-Fairy or Zacian-C.</li> <li>As a revenge killer, Koraidon provides numerous advantages compared to others, such as having high Defense and Fighting-type STAB moves to take on E-Killer Arceus, and attacking physically lets it heavily damage Calm Mind Arceus formes.</li> <li>It's nigh on impossible for this Koraidon to break past Skeledirge, Toxapex, or Dondozo reliably, so pairing Koraidon with strong wallbreakers that can take advantage of U-turn is a must.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy takes on Koraidon well and doesn't mind U-turn, so checks to Arceus-Fairy such as Skeledirge, Zacian-C, and Clodsire are good partners.</li> <li>Flare Blitz recoil, Rocky Helmet damage, and entry hazards can quickly pile up damage on this Koraidon, so having a solid defensive core is recommended so you don't have to rely on Koraidon's revenge killing as much.</li> </ul>"

      "Scale Shot": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Koraidon is the single best sweeper in the tier thanks to its incredible coverage and naturally high Attack thanks to Orichalcum Pulse. Bulk Up is an alternative to Swords Dance that negates Scale Shot's Defense drop, albeit weaker. Scale Shot is a powerful Dragon-type attack, especially when paired with Loaded Dice, that gives Koraidon a way to outspeed Zacian-C while having good odds to 2HKO Skeledirge and Toxapex. Flare Blitz, when boosted by Koraidon's sun, can break through Arceus-Fairy, Zacian-C, and Flutter Mane. Low Kick threatens Arceus while providing strong neutral coverage.</li> <li>Tera Ghost offsets Koraidon's Defense stat drop, letting it avoid being revenge killed by Arceus. Tera Fire, however, allows Koraidon to flip the matchup on Arceus-Fairy and Zacian-C while increasing Flare Blitz's power and making it immune to Will-O-Wisp.</li> <li>Koraidon fits best on offense teams, where it can leverage its incredible wallbreaking power to support its other teammates. Koraidon can pressure physical walls such as Landorus-T, Skeledirge, and Toxapex, so Pokemon that can take advantage of this, such as Zacian-C and Arceus, are good partners. Flutter Mane is another good partner for cleaning up after Koraidon breaks through defensive Arceus formes and Zacian-C. Koraidon's Scale Shot creates situations where Fairy-type Pokemon such as Zacian-C, Arceus-Fairy, and Flutter Mane may switch into it directly; therefore, predicting when these pivots come in opens up Koraidon late-game.</li> <li>Try to bait out Terastallization before using Koraidon, as Tera Fairy Pokemon such as Kyogre can limit Koraidon from sweeping and force it out. Kyogre in particular is also a temporary check to Koraidon thanks to Drizzle deactivating Koraidon’s ability. Scale Shot's Defense drop makes Koraidon vulnerable to priority such as Arceus's Extreme Speed and Kingambit's Sucker Punch, so teammates that can pivot into these attacks, like Landorus-T and Zacian-C, are appreciated. Since Scale Shot draws in Fairy-types such as Zacian-C, Arceus-Fairy, and Flutter Mane, checks to them such as Landorus-T and Zacian-C, respectively, are appreciated.</li> </ul>"

Close Combat is the preferred Fighting-type STAB move when running Tera Fighting, as it has a chance to 2HKO both Toxapex, which takes little from Low Kick, and most Arceus-Fairy sets outright.</li> <li>Dragon Claw usually 2HKOes Skeledirge and is a reliable Dragon-type STAB move, so it tends to be preferred over Outrage. Outrage does sport overwhelming power and can 2HKO Toxapex and Alomomola, which Dragon Claw cannot do without entry hazard support. This is particularly notable for Tera Steel sets, which may otherwise lack enough breaking power.</li> <li>Flare Blitz is a very strong move under the sun and becomes incredibly powerful when boosted by Tera Fire, to the point that it even 2HKOes Fire-resistant Pokemon like Skeledirge and Toxapex. Tera Fire has the additional benefit of granting a Fairy resistance and a burn immunity.</li> <li>While not providing any boost in offensive power, Tera Steel offers several useful resistances to Fairy, Ice, and Dragon, which can help Koraidon take on Pokemon like Zacian-C, Miraidon, Arceus-Fairy, and Chien-Pao.</li> <li>Choice Band Koraidon is an insanely powerful wallbreaker that can break past all of its normal checks and switch-ins. However, it tends to be worn down easily due to being vulnerable to all entry hazards and often taking Rocky Helmet damage and Flare Blitz recoil. Thus, it pairs best with teammates like Zacian-C, which can clean up after Koraidon has broken down the main defensive core. Koraidon's breaking power allows Zacian-C the flexibility to run coverage options outside of Tera Blast such as Crunch and Wild Charge, and Zacian-C provides the team with a revenge killer as well, making the two a particularly good pair.</li> <li>Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy sets also work well with Choice Band Koraidon, as Arceus-Fairy can sweep much easier once Skeledirge and Toxapex are taken out of the picture.</li> <li>Koraidon provides excellent utility for teams that are looking for a way to force out Calm Mind Arceus formes, Calm Mind Kyogre, and Calm Mind Cresselia, as its higher Speed and overwhelming physical power can easily break past the aforementioned foes.</li> <li>Koraidon tends to be revenge killed by Zacian-C, opposing Choice Scarf Koraidon, and Choice Scarf Miraidon. As such, sporting a solid defensive core with Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Skeledirge, Groudon, and Toxapex is critical for Koraidon's success.</li> </ul>"

Groudon, Toxapex, any Arceus forme, Landorus-T, Kyogre, and others can be knocked out in a single hit, even if they adapt fully defensive EV spreads.</li> <li>Low Kick is a powerful STAB move that takes advantage of the heavy weight of most Pokemon in the metagame. This is better than Close Combat, as it doesn't drop Koraidon's defenses while still having 120 Base Power against crucial targets.</li> <li>Stomping Tantrum allows Koraidon to 2HKO Toxapex and Skeledirge without power boosts. However, if the prior move failed, Stomping Tantrum will do double damage and OHKO Skeledirge. This is triggered when Skeledirge switches into Low Kick, for instance.</li> <li>Swords Dance is one of the most important moves in Koraidon's arsenal, allowing it to get OHKOs on anything that doesn't have the Unaware ability, as long as Koraidon has the right moves for the situation.</li> <li>Flame Charge is the key to Koraidon's sweeping abilities because of the Speed boost it provides in addition to the Fire-type coverage with no recoil. Usually, Flame Charge needs the boost from Tera Fire to fix its low Base Power and allow Koraidon to pick up KOs on healthier targets.</li> <li>Flare Blitz is a more powerful alternative to Flame Charge, which makes Koraidon significantly less reliant on Terastallization to score KOs on the opponent's defensive Pokemon like Arceus-Fairy after Swords Dance. This can open up opportunities for its fellow sweeping teammates.</li> <li>Dragon Claw fixes Koraidon's issues with Rayquaza and Giratina; however, it does make Koraidon much less threatening against Skeledirge and Toxapex, as it can no longer 2HKO either.</li> <li>Life Orb is the key to Koraidon's functioning. Life Orb is absolutely necessary, as the power boost and recoil differentiate how this Koraidon is used compared to its other sets.</li> <li>Tera Fire is necessary, as it gives Koraidon an immunity to Will-O-Wisp, resistances to Fairy and Steel, and a huge power boost to Koraidon's Fire-type attacks. This is especially efficient with Flame Charge and is often key to enabling Koraidon to sweep.</li> <li>Life Orb Koraidon fits well on any remotely offensively-minded team because it has the ability to lure in defensive Pokemon and beat them due to its unexpected Life Orb-boosted power. This can be used to open up teammates like Swords Dance, Dragon Dance, or offensive Calm Mind Arceus formes, Zacian-C, and Double Dance Miraidon.</li> </ul>"

Overheat nails Iron Treads and can also hit Ting-Lu or Clodsire, which often use Tera Steel on Miraidon's Draco Meteor, and it can also be used as a neutral hit to prevent switching between Ground- and Fairy-types to stall out Electric Terrain turns.

        "description": "<ul> <li>Walking Wake is one of the most dangerous sun wallbreakers in Ubers, capable of 2HKOing even the bulkiest of Water resists and special walls alike.</li> <li>Hydro Steam is Walking Wake's most spammable move; in sun, it 2HKOes Koraidon, OHKOes Flutter Mane, and 2HKOes Toxapex, making it very hard for teams to have a consistent switch-in to it.</li> <li>Dragon Pulse, albeit weaker than Draco Meteor, doesn't come with any drawbacks, making it a much better move to spam if lowering Walking Wake's Special Attack is not desired.</li> <li>Tera Water turns Walking Wake into an unwallable Pokemon, 2HKOing defensive walls like Blissey and OHKOing offensive pivots like Assault Vest Flutter Mane in sun. Tera Fairy can be used instead, as it gives Walking Wake useful resistances to Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao and Kingambit while also making it immune to Dragon-type attacks from Koraidon and Miraidon. Lastly, Tera Steel gives Walking Wake a resistance to Iron Bundle's Ice-type attacks, mainly Freeze Dry.</li> <li>A Modest nature lets Walking Wake wallbreak with extreme ease, allowing for Draco Meteor to 2HKO Clodsire in sun. Alternatively, a Timid nature gets the jump on Timid Chi-Yu and opposing Modest Walking Wake, although the difference in power is very noticeable.</li> <li>Walking Wake is best suited for offensive sun teams and should be used as such, making use of its unique typing to switch into Pokemon like Chi-Yu and counterattack with a nuclear Hydro Steam.</li> <li>Walking Wake is somewhat slow for Ubers standards, so fast partners like Choice Scarf Koraidon and Flutter Mane are a must to compensate for its Speed stat. Koraidon's sun also greatly powers up Walking Wake's attacks.</li> <li>Secondary wallbreakers such as Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu are also recommended, as Walking Wake's Speed hinders its performance as a standalone wallbreaker. Defensive teammates like Clodsire and Great Tusk are also helpful, as they check Miraidon, Flutter Mane, and Koraidon, respectively.</li> </ul>"
