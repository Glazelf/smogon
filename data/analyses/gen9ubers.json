Its ability to outspeed Zacian-C and pressure common Pokemon found on bulky archetypes, like Ting-Lu, Corviknight, Skeledirge, and Groudon, gives it a decent offensive presence. Choice Scarf Kyogre can also pressure hyper offense teams because those teams don't run Pokemon naturally faster than it. However, Choice Scarf Kyogre is prediction reliant, as there are a lot of Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks in Ubers, mainly metagame staples like Koraidon, Miraidon, and other defensive Pokemon like Water Absorb Clodsire and Eternatus. Choice Scarf Kyogre is also relatively weak, which means that it'll often be forced to use Tera to power up its attacks; even then, Pokemon like Eternatus and Clodsire will still wall Kyogre.</li> <li>Koraidon is the biggest threat to Kyogre, as it commonly switches into it, takes little damage from its Water-type attacks, and sets sun. Catching Koraidon with Ice Beam is extremely important, as it can make the difference between Kyogre sweeping in the late game or not. This makes Choice Scarf Kyogre extremely prediction reliant, as one single bad move can mean the entire momentum of the battle is lost.</li> <li>Tera Water boosts Kyogre's Water-type moves to insane levels. For instance, Water Spout now OHKOes max HP Arceus formes that are neutral to Water and 2HKOes Arceus formes that resist Water. It also has a good chance to OHKO Groudon even if sun is active.</li> <li>Kyogre should be brought onto the field via pivoting moves like U-turn from the likes of Koraidon, Miraidon, and Landorus-T. Unless there are Water Absorb Pokemon on the enemy team, Water Spout is a relatively free move to spam; however, hitting Koraidon on the switch with a well-timed Ice Beam can be game-changing.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Kyogre appreciates Pokemon that can wallbreak by themselves. A good teammate for this reason is Miraidon, which shares a common check in Clodsire. Taunt Miraidon in particular can shut down Clodsire completely, as Clodsire will be at half HP after switching into Draco Meteor. Miraidon can also bring Kyogre onto the field via U-turn. Arceus-Ground is another great teammate for Kyogre, as it can keep Pokemon like Eternatus, Clodsire, and Miraidon in check.</li> <li>Pokemon that can check Koraidon, like Arceus-Fairy, Groudon, and Skeledirge, are a must, as Koraidon is one of the most annoying Pokemon in Ubers for Kyogre to deal with: it replaces rain with sun, weakening Kyogre's main attacking moves. They can also set entry hazards and, in Landorus-T's case, bring Kyogre onto the field with U-turn.</li> <li>Entry hazard removers like Giratina-O and Corviknight are appreciated, as Kyogre loses a lot of power when its HP is lowered. Both Pokemon also check threats like Extreme Killer Arceus, which can revenge kill Kyogre with Extreme Speed.</li> </ul> "

What differentiates Arceus-Fairy from other Calm Mind Arceus formes is its Dragon immunity, which grants it an invaluable defensive niche against some of the metagame's top threats, like Koraidon, and its Judgment being at least a neutral hit on the vast majority of the metagame, as Pokemon that resist Fairy are scarce.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Arceus-Fairy to outspeed Adamant Rayquaza while maximizing bulk. This allows Arceus-Fairy to avoid the 2HKO from Pokemon like Choice Scarf Koraidon and Jolly Life Orb Rayquaza.</li> <li>Tera Poison is essential to prevent Clodsire and Eternatus from poisoning Arceus-Fairy with Toxic; it also allows Arceus-Fairy to absorb Toxic Spikes. It also retains Arceus-Fairy's ability to check Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Koraidon in a pinch, which can be useful for pivoting. In conjunction with Will-O-Wisp, Tera Poison Arceus-Fairy can potentially take on Zacian-C one-on-one if it has enough Calm Mind boosts.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy should be spreading Will-O-Wisp before attempting to sweep, as Pokemon like Clodsire and Zacian-C can stop Arceus-Fairy on its tracks before it accomplishes anything. Arceus-Fairy can be overwhelmed fairly easily by strong powerhouses like Tera Fire Koraidon and Choice Specs Miraidon, so taking care of them first before attempting to sweep is advised.</li> <li>Skeledirge is the best counter to Arceus-Fairy, as it ignores Calm Mind boosts with Unaware, can break through it with Torch Song, and is naturally immune to Will-O-Wisp. Because of this, Pokemon like Eternatus, Kyogre, Miraidon, and Clodsire are good teammates, as they can comfortably sit on Skeledirge and force it out.</li> <li>Pokemon like Skeledirge can check Zacian-C and Koraidon for Arceus-Fairy and spread burns with Will-O-Wisp; the combination of Skeledirge + Arceus-Fairy checks Koraidon pretty well. Similarly, Landorus-T can act as a soft check to Koraidon and Zacian-C that can also provide both entry hazard and Taunt support. Pokemon that can check special attackers for Arceus-Fairy, like Ting-Lu and Clodsire, are recommended, as they also can set up entry hazards on the field for Arceus-Fairy to have an easier time sweeping late-game.</li> </ul> "

Tera Flying gives Skeledirge an immunity to Ground-type moves, which can be helpful against Arceus-Ground and Stomping Tantrum Koraidon. Tera Water provides a good all-around neutral defensive type to use which maintains an Ice-type resistance for Chien-Pao and Calyrex-I.</li> <li>Skeledirge offers a great deal of role compression to teams thanks to its ability to reliably check so many offensive threats.</li> <li>Skeledirge's main flaw is that it can be passive and vulnerable to double switches, U-turn, and Taunt.</li> <li>Koraidon can often take advantage of the predictable switch to Skeledirge to bring in deadly offensive threats such as Chi-Yu, Walking Wake, and Kyogre with U-turn. As a result, it may be advantageous to anticipate U-turn in these scenarios.</li> <li>Taunt is often employed as a method to bypass Skeledirge's Will-O-Wisp, especially by Koraidon and E-Killer Arceus. If you expect the foe to use Taunt, taking advantage of the situation and gaining Special Attack boosts with Torch Song is a great way to limit their ability to wallbreak.</li> <li>Ting-Lu and Clodsire are excellent teammates for Skeledirge, as they cover most of the special attackers that come in on it, especially Miraidon, while Skeledirge can in turn handle most physical threats. Together they form a solid defensive backbone.</li> <li>Skeledirge is unable to take on Ground-type physical attackers like Arceus-Ground, Tera Ground Zacian-C, and Groudon without using Tera itself. As a result, Pokemon that resist or are immune to Ground like Corviknight, Giratina-O, Landorus-T, and Arceus-Grass make for good partners. Corviknight has the additional benefit of solidifying the matchup against E-Killer Arceus.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy is useful as a backup check to Koraidon, and it makes it much more difficult for Koraidon to get easy momentum with U-turn.</li> </ul> "

Furthermore, it gives Maushold an Ice resistance, making it less vulnerable to being revenge killed by Chien-Pao's Ice Shard, and a Fighting neutrality, allowing it to possibly survive previously super effective Fighting-type moves such as Great Tusk's Body Press and Koraidon's Collision Course.</li> <li>On the other hand, Tera Normal boosts the power of Population Bomb, allowing Maushold to OHKO Great Tusk and Kingambit and 2HKO physically defensive Corviknight at +1. Another notable upside is that the residual damage of Rocky Helmet is reduced due to Population Bomb needing less hits to KO foes.</li> <li>Tera Grass provides Maushold with a resistance to Ground and STAB on Bullet Seed, allowing it to bypass Rocky Helmet on Great Tusk, Slowking, and Toxapex. Despite this upside, it also gives Maushold an Ice weakness, allowing Chien-Pao to more easily revenge kill it with Ice Shard.</li> <li>Great partners for Maushold are Pokemon that give it more longevity and easier entry, as it has poor bulk and is threatened by most attacks. Grimmsnarl offers screens support, while Koraidon and Miraidon can bring Maushold in with U-turn. In addition, Knock Off support from Great Tusk and Iron Treads helps Maushold by removing Great Tusk and Corviknight's Rocky Helmet, allowing for freer use of Population Bomb.</li> <li>Other great partners are Pokemon that are either weak to entry hazards or appreciate the extra HP, since Maushold can relieve pressure and provide its teammates with easier setup opportunities.

A specific example is Miraidon needing two rounds of Stealth Rock damage for a +2 Tera Ghost Adamant Shadow Sneak to OHKO it, while Jolly would need three rounds of Stealth Rock damage. Jolly's power drop is too significant and the extra Speed it gives doesn't make a worthwhile difference.</li> <li>Tera Fairy improves Ceruledge's defensive profile even more, as it is now immune to Koraidon's Dragon-type STAB moves.

However, the power drop is very noticeable, as it can often come up short in the scenarios you would rely on it to score a KO, for example it now can't OHKO Flutter Mane with Shadow Sneak.</li> <li>Koraidon is an amazing partner, as they can double up on shared checks and wallbreak for the other one to clean late-game.

Koraidon can also help to dance around Chi-Yu, as it can take Dark Pulse aimed at Ceruledge.</li> <li>Great Tusk can also fit alongside the two, as it can clear entry hazards for Ceruledge and help break Dondozo thanks to its immense power. It can also act as a backup Koraidon check.</li> <li>Flutter Mane can often threaten out the Pokemon used for countering Ceruledge, while Ceruledge can threaten out Flutter Mane's checks. They can synergistically break through teams together.</li> <li>Chien-Pao and Ceruledge often act similarly, as they are both tough wallbreakers with good priority that often share checks.

Remember, base Palafin needs to be used very early in a game to transform into its Hero Form.</li> <li>Pelipper is a great partner for Palafin, as it checks Koraidon decently and replaces its sun with rain, strengthening Palafin's powerful Water-type attacks.</li> <li>Koraidon sets up sun and resists Water-type attacks Palafin throws at it, so Palafin appreciates teammates that threaten Koraidon, like Iron Bundle and Flutter Mane. Also, Palafin is weakened by the sun Koraidon sets up, so it is best not to pair Palafin and Koraidon together.</li> <li>Miraidon is a good partner, as it destroys Alomomola, a great counter to Palafin, and can safely bring Palafin onto the field with either U-turn or Volt Switch.

Ting-Lu and Iron Treads both help with Miraidon, and Pokemon like Great Tusk, Scream Tail, and Skeledirge can provide defensive solidity against Koraidon.</li> <li>This Palafin set functions best with a sturdy defensive backbone alongside it, to mitigate the impact of Zero to Hero.

Additionally, getting rid of the Fighting typing lets Great Tusk survive Fairy-type attacks such as Dazzling Gleam from Miraidon and Moonblast from Flutter Mane without Life Orb or Choice Specs, and it facilitates taking Dazzling Gleam and Play Rough from Scream Tail and Alomomola.</li> <li>Alternatively, using Tera Steel gives Great Tusk resistances to Fairy-type attacks, Ice-type attacks from Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle, and Draco Meteor from Miraidon, allowing it to surprise them with a strong attack.</li> <li>Koraidon is a solid partner because its sun activates Great Tusk's Protosynthesis, making its attacks even stronger. In return, Great Tusk can break through or strongly dent common Koraidon checks like Scream Tail, Alomomola, and Skeledirge, which allows Koraidon to clean more easily. Miraidon is also an excellent teammate, since Great Tusk can easily hard switch into its common checks and either threaten them with its attacks or set up on them.</li> <li>Special attackers like Miraidon, Flutter Mane, and Iron Bundle hugely threaten Great Tusk, so it is recommended to pair it with appropriate special walls like Blissey, Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Clodsire. Gothitelle is a less popular pick but it helps eliminate bulky checks like Dondozo and Pelipper, allowing Great Tusk to sweep more easily.</li> </ul> "

Knock Off can be used to take on Air Balloon Gholdengo and wear down foes that want to switch into Great Tusk such as Corviknight and Annihilape, but it is generally outclassed by the sheer utility of Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock. The combination of Knock Off and Body Press can be used to pressure Corviknight switch-ins.</li> <li>Bulk Up is an option to boost alongside opposing Great Tusk and Swords Dance Kingambit and Koraidon.</li> <li>Great Tusk can Terastallize into the Fairy typing to take on physical attackers such as Koraidon, Chien-Pao, and Palafin in sun. However, be wary of Terastallizing against Koraidon that can still Terastallize themselves, as Choice Band Tera Fire Koraidon can take on Great Tusk one-on-one. Great Tusk can also Terastallize into the Ground typing or the Water typing, with both options removing its weakness to Fairy. The former also lets it fire off stronger Earthquakes as well, while the latter provides useful resistances to Fire moves from Koraidon as well as Ice- and Water-type moves, barring Freeze-Dry, from Iron Bundle.</li> <li>Great Tusk fits on most teams as a bulky Stealth Rock setter and Koraidon check. Great Tusk can utilize Rocky Helmet to punish the use of U-turn, though this hurts its longevity, as it then loses Leftovers's passive recovery.</li> <li>Great Tusk pairs well with defensive Scream Tail and Blissey, both of which can take on Iron Bundle while also providing Wish support for Great Tusk. Blissey can also take on Chi-Yu and Miraidon, while Scream Tail can take on Iron Valiant.</li> <li>Great Tusk also pairs well with Gholdengo, as it appreciates Great Tusk forcing out Koraidon while preventing hazard removal in exchange. Choice Scarf Chi-Yu is a good partner due to its ability to pressure faster special attackers that trouble Great Tusk such as Iron Bundle and Flutter Mane. Great Tusk also pairs well with Miraidon, as non-Heavy-Duty Boots Miraidon appreciates it removing entry hazards and taking on Clodsire, Iron Treads, and Ting-Lu. Finally, Koraidon is a good partner, as it can set up sun, pivot into Great Tusk, and force out most hazard removal options besides opposing defensive Great Tusk.</li> </ul> "

It also checks threatening, almost unwallable Pokemon in the metagame, like Kingambit and Chien-Pao. However, Iron Hands is prone to getting revenge killed by common special attackers in the tier like Flutter Mane, Miraidon, Chi-Yu, and even Skeledirge, due to its nonexistent Special Defense stat; furthermore, it's also extremely slow, meaning Iron Hands is pretty much always moving last, making it a deadweight against more offensive teams.</li> <li>Wild Charge is an option over Thunder Punch that allows Iron Hands to have favorable chances of 2HKOing Skeledirge in Electric Terrain. However, the damage recoil can be unappetizing.</li> <li>Earthquake 2HKOes Clodsire, a Pokemon that would otherwise check Iron Hands. It also cleanly 2HKOes Skeledirge and, in combination with Wild Charge, lets Iron Hands to always KO Skeledirge if Electric Terrain is up.</li> <li>The given Defense EVs let Iron Hands always survive a +2 Icicle Crash from Life Orb Chien-Pao. It also has a favorable chance to avoid the 2HKO from a Choice Band-boosted Icicle Crash from Chien-Pao. The Speed EVs allow Iron Hands to outspeed Corviknight.</li> <li>Tera Flying turns Iron Hands's Ground-type weakness into an immunity, allowing it to use Pokemon like Iron Treads, Great Tusk, and non-Whirlwind Ting-Lu as setup fodder.</li> <li>Leftovers is Iron Hands's only form of passive recovery. Punching Glove is an alternative that lets Iron Hands ignore all contact Items and moves; this means that Toxapex can't poison it with Baneful Bunker and Rocky Helmet Pokemon like Corviknight and the aforementioned Toxapex can't punish its attacks. However, Iron Hands will greatly miss Leftovers's passive recovery, as it will getting worn down very easily without it.</li> <li>Iron Hands is good at breaking holes against bulky teams thanks to its stellar offensive typing and access to Swords Dance; it should always be sent into Pokemon like Corviknight and Kingambit and either use Swords Dance to immediately threaten something as they switch out or hit them with a super effective attack. Proper prediction is necessary, however, as Iron Hands can get pivoted around easily.</li> <li>Iron Hands is best used on balance teams that are in need for a wallbreaker that can also check Chien-Pao and Kingambit.</li> <li>Miraidon is Iron Hands's best teammate, as it sets Electric Terrain, allowing for Iron Hands to better break the bulky teams its supposed to. It also can bring Iron Hands safely to the field with U-turn and check the physical walls that annoy Iron Hands, like Encore Scream Tail. Iron Hands in return deals with Pokemon like Iron Treads, Ting-Lu, and Blissey for Miraidon.</li> <li>Pokemon that can check Koraidon, such as Great Tusk and Toxapex, also make for good partners, as Koraidon defeats Iron Hands one-on-one and is a threat for the teams Iron Hands is usually on.</li> <li>Entry hazard control is also recommended, as Iron Hands can't do a good job at checking Pokemon it's supposed to, like Chien-Pao and Kingambit, with Stealth Rock or Spikes up on the field. As such, spinners like Great Tusk and Iron Treads, as well as Magic Bounce Pokemon like Hatterene, make for excellent partners.</li> <li>Specially defensive walls, such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire, are recommended, as they can set Spikes for Iron Hands and check Pokemon like Miraidon and, in Clodsire's case, Flutter Mane.</li> </ul> "

The remaining 36 Special Defense EVs improve Roaring Moon's chances to survive Iron Bundle's Ice Beam after Stealth Rock while giving it a chance to survive Overheat in sun from Modest Choice Specs Chi-Yu.</li> <li>Tera Dark strengthens Roaring Moon's Crunch to the point where it always 2HKOs physically defensive Corviknight and always 3HKOs Dondozo while easing predictions with Earthquake against Garganacl.</li> <li>Tera Steel lets Roaring Moon resist otherwise super effective Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Iron Bundle, Flutter Mane, Koraidon, and Miraidon.

In return, Roaring Moon threatens non-Terastallized Skeledirge.</li> <li>Koraidon and Roaring Moon both struggle with defensive Great Tusk, so they can team up with Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao, which threaten all Great Tusk sets. Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao also threaten Koraidon and Miraidon, with Iron Bundle naturally outspeeding non-Choice Scarf variants and Chien-Pao threatening them with priority Ice Shard.</li> <li>Defensive Great Tusk and Ting-Lu also work well with Roaring Moon, as they can set up entry hazards for Roaring Moon's team and check Koraidon and Miraidon, respectively. Great Tusk in particular can use Rapid Spin, giving Roaring Moon more opportunities to switch in, while Ting-Lu can phaze threatening boosters like Espathra with Whirlwind and set up Spikes.</li> <li>Specially defensive Corviknight can check Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle, both of which outspeed and threaten Roaring Moon, and can Defog hazards away, giving Roaring Moon more opportunities to switch in.</li> <li>Roaring Moon can easily pivot into Chi-Yu, which takes advantage of the sun set by Koraidon and threatens walls like Great Tusk, Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Terastallized Skeledirge.</li> <li>Gholdengo also makes for a decent partner, as not only does it have perfect defensive synergy with Roaring Moon, but it can also reliably block all common forms of hazard removal. This allows Roaring Moon’s team to keep up hazards, in particular Spikes, for it to eventually break down walls.</li> </ul> "

Close Combat is the preferred Fighting-type STAB move when running Tera Fighting, as it has a chance to 2HKO both Toxapex, which takes little from Low Kick, and most Arceus-Fairy sets outright.</li> <li>Dragon Claw usually 2HKOes Skeledirge and is a reliable Dragon-type STAB move, so it tends to be preferred over Outrage. Outrage does sport overwhelming power and can 2HKO Toxapex and Alomomola, which Dragon Claw cannot do without entry hazard support. This is particularly notable for Tera Steel sets, which may otherwise lack enough breaking power.</li> <li>Flare Blitz is a very strong move under the sun and becomes incredibly powerful when boosted by Tera Fire, to the point that it even 2HKOes Fire-resistant Pokemon like Skeledirge and Toxapex. Tera Fire has the additional benefit of granting a Fairy resistance and a burn immunity.</li> <li>While not providing any boost in offensive power, Tera Steel offers several useful resistances to Fairy, Ice, and Dragon, which can help Koraidon take on Pokemon like Zacian-C, Miraidon, Arceus-Fairy, and Chien-Pao.</li> <li>Choice Band Koraidon is an insanely powerful wallbreaker that can break past all of its normal checks and switch-ins. However, it tends to be worn down easily due to being vulnerable to all entry hazards and often taking Rocky Helmet damage and Flare Blitz recoil. Thus, it pairs best with teammates like Zacian-C, which can clean up after Koraidon has broken down the main defensive core.

Groudon, Toxapex, any Arceus forme, Landorus-T, Kyogre, and others can be knocked out in a single hit, even if they adapt fully defensive EV spreads.</li> <li>Low Kick is a powerful STAB move that takes advantage of the heavy weight of most Pokemon in the metagame. This is better than Close Combat, as it doesn't drop Koraidon's defenses while still having 120 Base Power against crucial targets.</li> <li>Stomping Tantrum allows Koraidon to 2HKO Toxapex and Skeledirge without power boosts. However, if the prior move failed, Stomping Tantrum will do double damage and OHKO Skeledirge. This is triggered when Skeledirge switches into Low Kick, for instance.</li> <li>Swords Dance is one of the most important moves in Koraidon's arsenal, allowing it to get OHKOs on anything that doesn't have the Unaware ability, as long as Koraidon has the right moves for the situation.</li> <li>Flame Charge is the key to Koraidon's sweeping abilities because of the Speed boost it provides in addition to the Fire-type coverage with no recoil. Usually, Flame Charge needs the boost from Tera Fire to fix its low Base Power and allow Koraidon to pick up KOs on healthier targets.</li> <li>Flare Blitz is a more powerful alternative to Flame Charge, which makes Koraidon significantly less reliant on Terastallization to score KOs on the opponent's defensive Pokemon like Arceus-Fairy after Swords Dance. This can open up opportunities for its fellow sweeping teammates.</li> <li>Dragon Claw fixes Koraidon's issues with Rayquaza and Giratina; however, it does make Koraidon much less threatening against Skeledirge and Toxapex, as it can no longer 2HKO either.</li> <li>Life Orb is the key to Koraidon's functioning. Life Orb is absolutely necessary, as the power boost and recoil differentiate how this Koraidon is used compared to its other sets.</li> <li>Tera Fire is necessary, as it gives Koraidon an immunity to Will-O-Wisp, resistances to Fairy and Steel, and a huge power boost to Koraidon's Fire-type attacks.

Baiting out Terastallization earlier in the game massively helps out Koraidon, as that ensures it can no longer be revenge killed by a defensive Tera Fairy when going for a sweep.</li> <li>Kyogre setting up rain hurts Koraidon, as rain removes Koraidon’s Orichalcum Pulse boost and weakens Flame Charge, making it much easier to play around.

It can also stop setup from the likes of Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy, Calm Mind or Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground, and Dragon Dance Arceus.</li> <li>Miraidon is required to run 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature or it runs the risk of underspeeding Eternatus, Arceus, and Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Miraidon from taking unnecessary chip damage from hazards, which are set most of the time due to the lack of reliable hazard removal in the tier. This gives pivot Miraidon more longevity compared to boosting items and allows it to bring in its teammates for longer.</li> <li>Tera Dragon and Tera Electric give Miraidon's STAB moves a power boost, allowing it to 2HKO Ting-Lu with Draco Meteor and to 2HKO specially defensive Arceus-Fairy with Electro Drift, respectively.</li> <li>Miraidon is best used alongside setup threats such as the aforementioned Arceus formes, Swords Dance Koraidon, and Swords Dance Zacian-C to deny opposing walls entry hazards and recoveryand chip them with its powerful Electric- and Dragon-type STAB moves.</li> <li>It can struggle to deal with Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and bulky Arceus formes due to lacking power compared to Choice Specs sets, so it appreciates teammates such as Koraidon, Zacian-C and Flutter Mane that can reliably come in on them after it uses U-turn.</li> <li>Pivot Miraidon can form a strong momentum core with other pivots such as Landorus-T and Koraidon to provide chip damage for other teammates to clean.</li> <li>Teams with it do require some form of alternative speed control such as Zacian-C, Choice Scarf Koraidon, and Flutter Mane, as Miraidon is unable to outpace other threats itself.</li> </ul> "

        "description": "<p>Agility makes Miraidon a lethal late-game sweeper, taking advantage of its natural good Speed to outspeed every Pokemon on the metagame at +2 without major Speed investment, allowing for more bulk investment to live hits it normally wouldn't be able to. Roseli Berry helps Miraidon take a Play Rough from Zacian-C or Judgement from Arceus-Fairy, allowing it to set up against them more easily. Electric Seed provides a +1 Defense boost, allowing it to have easier setup opportunities against physical attackers. Parabolic Charge allows Miraidon to recover health while also doing consistent damage. On the other hand, Electro Drift is a stronger move that OHKOes Zacian after one layer of Spikes. Dragon Pulse can be used with Tera Dragon, while Dazzling Gleam is used exclusively on Tera Fairy Tera Fairy is an amazing defensive typing that turns its weaknesses into neutralities and grants it a Dragon-type immunity, letting it 2HKO Ting-Lu after one layer of Spikes and OHKO opposing Miraidon and Koraidon with STAB Dazzling Gleam. However, this set is completely walled by Clodsire. Tera Dragon powers up Dragon Pulse, which allows Miraidon to 2HKO Ting-Lu and Clodsire with a 2 HKO at +1 after Spikes damage and pick up KOs from higher ranges of health on other neutral targets like Arceus-Ground. This set should be considered on either balance offense teams as a cleaner or hyper offense sweeper that can break open the opposing team. Partners in hyper Offense teams such as dual screens Grimmsnarl allow it to easily set up and sweep. On the other hand, leads such as Meowscarada and Froslass can aid Miraidon's sweep by setting up Spikes to weaken opposing Pokemon into range of Miraidon's attacks. Miraidon benefits from partners that can allow it to break its checks much more easily such as Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Ground, Kyogre. and Koraidon. It also benefits from other teammates such as Eternatus that weaken their shared checks such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire for it.</p> "

Tera Fairy can be used instead, as it gives Walking Wake useful resistances to Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao and Kingambit while also making it immune to Dragon-type attacks from Koraidon and Miraidon. Lastly, Tera Steel gives Walking Wake a resistance to Iron Bundle's Ice-type attacks, mainly Freeze Dry.</li> <li>A Modest nature lets Walking Wake wallbreak with extreme ease, allowing for Draco Meteor to 2HKO Clodsire in sun. Alternatively, a Timid nature gets the jump on Timid Chi-Yu and opposing Modest Walking Wake, although the difference in power is very noticeable.</li> <li>Walking Wake is best suited for offensive sun teams and should be used as such, making use of its unique typing to switch into Pokemon like Chi-Yu and counterattack with a nuclear Hydro Steam.</li> <li>Walking Wake is somewhat slow for Ubers standards, so fast partners like Choice Scarf Koraidon and Flutter Mane are a must to compensate for its Speed stat. Koraidon's sun also greatly powers up Walking Wake's attacks.</li> <li>Secondary wallbreakers such as Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu are also recommended, as Walking Wake's Speed hinders its performance as a standalone wallbreaker. Defensive teammates like Clodsire and Great Tusk are also helpful, as they check Miraidon, Flutter Mane, and Koraidon, respectively.</li> </ul> "

        "description": "<ul> <li>Iron Leaves is a consistent wallbreaker in Electric Terrain thanks to its immense power and unique type combination. It can force out most walls and has a plethora of switch-in opportunities against the common Ground-types in the tier, such as Great Tusk and Ting-Lu.</li> <li>Wild Charge is an important coverage option that allows it to hit Corviknight, which resists Iron Leaves's STAB moves. It also OHKOes Pelipper.</li> <li>Close Combat hits the Steel-types that resist Iron Leaves's STAB moves, like Kingambit and Tera Steel users. Close Combat is also crucial for OHKOing Chi-Yu and Chien-Pao on the switch in.</li> <li>Swords Dance is an alternative option that can be used over one of the coverage moves to punish foes trying to stall out Electric Terrain turns by predicting Protect or a switch.</li> <li>Leftovers mitigates passive damage from hazards, Rocky Helmet, poison from Baneful Banker, and recoil from Wild Charge, providing Iron Leaves with some staying power. Iron Leaves with Leftovers and four attacks is best used as an early- to mid-game attacker that aims to create opportunities for teammates to sweep.</li> <li>Life Orb gives an immense power boost but reduces Iron Leaves's longevity. It will be worn down severely by the time it manages to beat its check, which allows it less opportunities to attack afterwards. Notably, Life Orb allows Psyblade to OHKO Miraidon and 2HKO Skeledirge in Electric Terrain. Life Orb is best in combination with Swords Dance to minimize recoil. Using Iron Leaves this way is most potent mid- to late-game.</li> <li>A Jolly nature is necessary to be able to outspeed Timid Chi-Yu and max Speed Palafin.</li> <li>Tera Psychic is the main option to increase Psyblade damage, remove Ice and Fire weaknesses, and actually be able to take a U-turn in a pinch. Tera Psychic allows Iron Leaves to OHKO Koraidon without Electric Terrain, OHKO defensive Great Tusk and Miraidon in Electric Terrain, and guarantee a 2HKO on Skeledirge and Terastallized Alomomola. It's meant to be utilized with four attacks.</li> <li>Tera Steel can be used to face off better against Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, and Kingambit. It also has the benefit of a Poison immunity, which can allow Iron Leaves to not get worn down by Baneful Bunker from Toxapex, and a U-turn resistance that can be used to catch the opponent off guard. This is a riskier Tera to commit to, as it makes Iron Leaves weak to both of Great Tusk's STAB moves instead of resisting them. Tera Steel is meant to be utilized with four attacks.</li> <li>Tera Fighting gives Iron Leaves a Close Combat that OHKOes physically defensive Corviknight after a Swords Dance without Electric Terrain. Tera Fighting's defensive contributions are useful against the aforementioned Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao, and especially Kingambit. This Tera type is meant to be utilized with Swords Dance and Close Combat.</li> <li>Tera Electric can be used to power up Wild Charge, which is useful against Corviknight and Tera Flying users like Kingambit, and it also gives Iron Leaves neutrality to all of its weaknesses. This Tera type is meant to be used with Swords Dance and Wild Charge to deal with Pokemon that resist Iron Leaves's STAB moves but are neutral to Electric. Tera Electric is the most risky, as you're investing your Terastallization for a Pokemon that's likely to KO itself quickly.</li> <li>The biggest downside to Iron Leaves is how dependent it is on Electric Terrain to function properly. It can still be used to force out Great Tusk and Ting-Lu without Electric Terrain, but it's underwhelming compared to when Electric Terrain is active.</li> <li>Miraidon is invaluable as a partner to Iron Leaves because it provides Electric Terrain and lures in Ground-types to U-turn on, which gives Iron Leaves a free switch. Specifically, Choice Scarf Miraidon is the best for the job, as it can provide Speed control and function as a late-game cleaner to take advantage of the holes Iron Leaves leaves behind.</li> <li>Specially defensive Corviknight is a great partner, as it can also provide U-turn support to get Iron Leaves in, as well as make up for the Iron Bundle weakness Miraidon and Iron Leaves share. Corviknight can provide hazard control with Defog, but an additional Rapid Spinner like Great Tusk or Iron Treads is also advisable.</li> <li>Iron Leaves fits best on bulky offense and balance teams, which also makes defensive pivots that are used in the archetype, like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Skeledirge, good partners.</li> </ul> "
