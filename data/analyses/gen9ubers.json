Tera Dragon is used with Overheat, powering up Draco Meteor when Tera Blast isn't run.</li> <li>Pivot Miraidon should be used aggressively, taking advantage of its high Special Attack to force out foes and use U-turn, wearing down its most common checks like Ting-Lu.</li> <li>When a team is sufficiently worn down, Miraidon can use Electro Drift and Tera Blast or Draco Meteor to clean thanks to its high Speed.</li> <li>Entry hazard setters are greatly appreciated, especially Spikes setters, to help wear down Ground-types for Miraidon.
