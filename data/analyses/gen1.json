      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. Venusaur is generally considered less viable in the current metagame, but its most up to date moveset is the following.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Venusaur has a few interesting moves available to it, though most are not especially useful. Hyper Beam is arguably its best alternative, being used over Toxic to hit a few targets for extra damage and finish off foes like Hypno a bit earlier. Rather impressively, it does well over 60% to Kadabra. Just note that dropping Toxic leaves Venusaur much more susceptible to partial-trapping.</p> <p>A Swords Dance set is possible, but it doesn't exactly take advantage of Venusaur's strengths, and other Pokemon like Tentacruel and Pinsir run the move with more consistency.</p> <p>Leech Seed is a possible alternative to Toxic to deal with partial-trapping while also giving Venusaur some health back; it gives roughly as much as Wrap takes away. The move does have higher accuracy than Toxic, but the effect isn't permanent, and it deals much less damage. Leech Seed also has the advantage of affecting Tentacruel, though it is unable to hit Tangela. The move can also be used in tandem with Toxic to continuously escalate Leech Seed's drained health, but setting this up in a real match is much easier said than done.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Haunter: If Venusaur has already used Sleep Powder on something else, Haunter is a pretty big issue. Venusaur's only option is Razor Leaf, which is 5HKO or worse. Haunter can 3HKO it if it's carrying Psychic or 4HKO with Night Shade.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Venusaur's Body Slam isn't particularly strong, so most Flying-type Pokemon can easily scare it away. Dragonite and Articuno take very little damage from any of Venusaur's moves and can 2HKO with Blizzard, though it is only guaranteed for the latter. Dodrio can set up Agility fairly freely in front of Venusaur, as Drill Peck is a 2HKO and Body Slam can't paralyze it. While rare, Moltres performs almost identically to Articuno against Venusaur.</p> <p><strong>Psychic Users: Kadabra is the scariest foe that can exploit Venusaur's weakness to Psychic, as it outpaces Venusaur and 2HKOes it. Due to the risk of a critical hit, Venusaur will almost always switch out, assuming Kadabra is healthy. Note that Hyper Beam is a legitimate threat to a paralyzed Kadabra, however. Hypno also 2HKOes but is slower, so it only really acts as a check if it is paralyzed or if one of its teammates is already asleep. Electabuzz is very likely to 3HKO Venusaur if it has Psychic, though Razor Leaf is also a 3HKO. Interestingly, the uncommon Venomoth is a premier Venusaur check. It effortlessly shrugs off Razor Leaf, outspeeds, carries Sleep Powder and Stun Spore, and 3HKOes with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves: Fortunately for Venusaur, it is faster than most users of Ice-type moves, so it is much less afraid of them than its rival Tangela. Nonetheless, there are a few Pokemon that can outspeed and threaten Venusaur. Tentacruel is the most prominent, as it can use Wrap and score a KO as early as 63.9%. Gyarados doesn't take Razor Leaf very well, but it barely outspeeds and threatens a likely 2HKO with Blizzard. If Venusaur is paralyzed, it becomes a lot more afraid of Pokemon like Vaporeon, Omastar, and especially Dewgong.</p> ",

          "description": "<hr /> <h1>Overview</h1> <p>For a while, Venusaur was close to obsolete in UU because Victreebel, which was an already fairly uncommon pick, largely outclassed it. However, Victreebel eventually exited the tier for OU, opening a power vacuum Venusaur was happy to occupy. Thanks to this and a few significant metagame shifts, Venusaur has become a permanent resident of RBY UU.</p> <p>Despite its humble origins, Venusaur is a powerful threat. Sleep is deadly in RBY and Venusaur boasts the second-fastest reliable sleep move in UU, behind only Venomoth. While Venusaur is much slower than tier staples like Tentacruel and Kadabra, its Speed tier is still a cut above several bulky Pokemon, like Hypno and Vaporeon, and happens to be shared with Dragonite. It is in these matchups where Venusaur most often thrives, as it can either use Sleep Powder uncontested or fire off its surprisingly powerful Razor Leaf. Venusaur is a threat that can bully Pokemon with Sleep Powder early-game and continue to exert some offensive pressure once a foe is asleep.</p> <p>Like Victreebel before it, Venusaur is notably restricted by its typing; while Poison does grant an immunity to Toxic, it isn't good for much else. It leaves Venusaur quite vulnerable to Psychic from common Pokemon like Hypno, Kadabra, and Electabuzz while making Earthquake deal neutral damage. Combine this with an Ice weakness and you get a Pokemon with numerous troublesome matchups and some difficulty switching in.</p> "

          "name": "Sleeper",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Razor Leaf will virtually always land a critical hit, so it provides Venusaur with a reliable and powerful STAB move that gives it a key advantage over Tangela. Its base damage is higher than Raichu's Thunderbolt and even with Tentacruel's Surf. Razor Leaf will always OHKO Dugtrio and Omastar and deal well over 50% to Water-type Pokemon like Poliwrath and Dewgong. The move will also 2HKO Vaporeon 78.6% of the time, making Venusaur the only Pokemon in UU to do so reliably. Some neutral targets take hefty damage as well, with Kangaskhan and Kadabra dropping to two and three hits, respectively. Additionally, Razor Leaf's critical hits make it a very good move for taking out rare Amnesia users like Poliwrath and Golduck. Because Venusaur was unfortunately denied access to Stun Spore, it makes use of Body Slam to try to spread paralysis. This is helpful against common switch-ins like Dragonite, Tentacruel, Articuno, and Kadabra. The move is also Venusaur's best option for hitting some targets that resist Razor Leaf. Toxic prevents Dragonite from using Wrap effectively. It also happens to be Venusaur's best move against Tangela, notably shutting down variants that run Bind. Other, less common users of partial-trapping moves, like Pinsir and Moltres, also prefer to avoid Toxic, though they are more capable of fighting off Venusaur in general.</p> <p>Sleep Powder is Venusaur's most significant move. Working Venusaur into battle against slower foes so it can use Sleep Powder is essential to using it effectively. Most often, Venusaur will try to somehow get in against Hypno. Most simply, Venusaur can just switch in whenever the opponent is likely to switch in a healthy Hypno. Special attackers, especially Kadabra, are quite good at baiting in Hypno; note that this can be done as early as turn 1 by leading with Kadabra. Venusaur can also come in after Hypno, or really any Pokemon, has used Rest and use Sleep Powder to catch a switch-in or put the Rest user right back to sleep. While exploiting Hypno and resting Pokemon is Venusaur's main route to success, it isn't its only one. For example, it can switch well into Dugtrio despite not quite walling it, as it can threaten an OHKO with Razor Leaf in addition to sleep. Venusaur also punishes Substitute Dugtrio exceptionally well, as Sleep Powder breaches the Substitute. Venusaur is also pretty good against Electric-type Pokemon, especially Raichu, but the threat of paralysis makes the matchup a little less desirable. It is important not to paralyze many Pokemon before Venusaur has used Sleep Powder, as many Pokemon can easily wall it once they are paralyzed. Once Venusaur has used Sleep Powder, it will usually will transition right away to using Body Slam to try to paralyze a switch-in. After that, it can serve as an answer to sleeping Water-type Pokemon or an auxiliary check to Dugtrio in the endgame. Venusaur is also fairly common sleep fodder.</p> <p>Venusaur's traits make it a good teammate for several key Pokemon in the UU metagame. Leads like Kadabra and Electabuzz that goad Pokemon like Hypno and Dugtrio to switch in work very well with Venusaur, as they allow it to use Sleep Powder early on before paralysis is spread. Articuno is uniquely suited to partner with Venusaur. It appreciates Venusaur's ability to effortlessly thwart Water-type Pokemon as well as its Sleep Powder, which can make setting up Agility much easier. Articuno, in turn, does well against a lot of Pokemon that can scare or bully Venusaur, like Dragonite, Dodrio, and Tangela. Other wallbreakers and sweepers like Kangaskhan, Persian, Dodrio, and Dragonite appreciate Venusaur for similar reasons.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Venusaur used to be used more often in earlier RBY OU metagames, but it fell out of favor due to the amount of Psychic- and Ice-type moves, as well as paralysis, thrown around. Still, it stands out as a Swords Dance wallbreaker that isn't hindered by Rhydon, and it can cleave through bulky Water-types like Starmie, Cloyster, and Slowbro thanks to Razor Leaf: Razor Leaf is one of the most consistent ways to dispatch Slowbro in the tier, and deceptively few teams are actually prepared for it. Venusaur is one of faster viable sleepers in the tier, only being outsped by Jynx and Gengar. It can act as a soft check to Snorlax, which is unlikely to 3HKO Venusaur and may be forced into a Rest loop by Razor Leaf, letting Venusaur set up. Venusaur often can be a two-for-one with sleep as one \"KO\", and Swords Dance + Hyper Beam picking up the second.</p> <p>However, a horrible defensive typing makes Venusaur harder to use effectively. It takes super effective damage from the very common Psychic and Blizzard, which will often deal heavy damage or force it out. Because of this, Venusaur adds very little defensive synergy to a team. Secondly, Venusaur's coverage is limited to Grass and Normal, allowing Gengar to hard wall it. Finally, it has competition with Victreebel. Victreebel also has STAB Razor Leaf, gets Wrap and Stun Spore, and has a higher Attack stat. It, however, has lower Defense and Speed than Venusaur. This means that, although Venusaur is less prone to being revenge killed by Tauros and never has to worry about Cloyster speed ties, it lacks the surprise factor and misses out on a few important damage ranges when compared to Victreebel, further narrowing its niche.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Sleep Powder allows Venusaur to keep a Pokemon out of play for up to the entirety of the game. Combined with Venusaur's Speed, you should be able to find an opportunity to land sleep in most games. Razor Leaf is Venusaur's best STAB option, landing a critical hit 99.6% of the time. Razor Leaf's primary target will be Water-types such as Starmie and Slowbro in addition to Rhydon. However, Razor Leaf also notably can 2HKO Tauros after just a little chip damage, while Tauros is unable to 2HKO Venusaur back. Swords Dance allows Venusaur to wallbreak and sweep when paired with Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Venusaur primarily uses sleep from itself or a teammate to set up Swords Dance. One of the best times to set up is immediately after sleeping a Pokemon, which gives a free turn whether it switches or stays in. Another good time is when an opposing Pokemon such as Snorlax or Slowbro is about to use Rest; you can also use Razor Leaf instead to deal damage to a switch-in or force Snorlax into a Rest loop. Before setting up, you also should deal with key threats that outspeed Venusaur and threaten it with high damage or paralysis—especially Gengar, which hard walls it—and avoid any damage or status unless Venusaur absolutely has to take it. After one Swords Dance, Venusaur has a 74.4% chance to OHKO Alakazam and OHKOes Chansey with a bit of initial damage; after a second Swords Dance, it has an 84.6% to KO Starmie with a single Hyper Beam. At +6 Attack, a majority of Pokemon that do not resist Hyper Beam will be OHKOed. Even if Venusaur fails to sweep an entire team, you likely got sleep off and took out at least one fast Pokemon on the opponent's team, possibly Tauros. This lets Venusaur enable Rhydon due to Tauros being one of the main obstacles for Rhydon. Rhydon also pairs nicely with Venusaur because it handles threats such as Zapdos and Pin Missile Jolteon that threaten Venusaur.</p> <p>When using Venusaur, you should not put it in the lead spot. Its Speed does not allow it to do well against any of the common leads, and leading off puts Venusaur in the face of danger early, which can weaken its offensive potential. Waiting to deploy Venusaur lets it get sleep off without risking any Speed ties with Exeggutor. If you paralyze the common leads—Starmie, Alakazam, and Jynx—before getting sleep, they often cannot switch in comfortably anyway. Starmie will be threatened by Razor Leaf, and Alakazam and Jynx will usually fall to a +2 Hyper Beam. Body Slam may look enticing for its paralysis chance and lack of recharging, but it is not strong enough to make as much use out of Swords Dance as Hyper Beam.</p> "

Possessing the coveted combination of 100 base Speed and Fire Spin, Charizard is not only one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, but also an effective pivot and lead, making it difficult to pin down. It also has many offensive options to choose from, including but not limited to STAB Fire Blast, Earthquake, Slash, and Body Slam, giving it unpredictable coverage that makes it difficult to switch into; additionally, it can use Swords Dance to further boost its wallbreaking capabilities. Charizard's Flying typing also comes in handy, letting it switch in on Earthquake from the likes of Nidoking, Golem, or the rare Sandslash to gain momentum with Fire Spin thereafter; in Nidoking's case, it can even deal big damage with its own Earthquake.</p> <p>Despite its highs, Charizard has trouble breaking past Water-types without already having a boost due to its weaknesses to Water and Ice, often forcing it to use Fire Spin and pivot to a teammate. Similarly, its weakness to Rock Slide makes Ground-types like Golem and Nidoking noteworthy adversaries, and Fire Spin's inaccuracy can make it unsafe to attempt pivoting out against them. Finally, Charizard is incapacitated by paralysis, losing almost all of its offensive presence.

Because viable Pokemon that Speed tie or outspeed Charizard are limited to Electrode, Fearow, Ninetales, Rapidash, and itself, in many scenarios, Fire Spin is limited only by its own inconsistency. STAB Fire Blast hits extremely hard, guaranteeing an OHKO on Exeggcute and Pinsir while dealing massive damage to anything else. For example, it 2HKOes Fearow and Sandslash, and even a single turn of burn or critical hit can greatly extend this range to Pokemon like Mr. Mime and Nidoking. Earthquake covers most opposing Fire-types, Nidoking, Kabutops, and Golem, 3HKOing most and being boosted by Swords Dance.</p> <p>While the aforementioned moves define the set, Charizard's last moveslot defines its role. Slash allows Charizard to be a consistent revenge killer, providing unresisted coverage alongside Earthquake by hitting Moltres and opposing Charizard for neutral damage. It also deals more damage to neutral targets than Earthquake, such as Seadra. Swords Dance boosts Earthquake's damage enough that it can 2HKO Golem and Mr. Mime, as well as sometimes OHKOing Ninetales. Finally, Toxic has Charizard function as a check to opposing wrappers, such as Dragonair, Rapidash, and Ninetales, as well as making it easier to chip down walls like Golem and Blastoise with Fire Spin. Checking wrappers bolsters its lead viability given the presence of opposing Fire Spin leads like Rapidash and Ninetales.</p> <p>This set can run Counter to be more effective against Body Slam users, as well as providing a point of entry against a predicted Hyper Beam to KO the foe next turn. Furthermore, it does massive damage against opposing Slash Charizard. This can give you massive momentum, as your Counter Charizard is poised to win the matchup thereafter. Body Slam is also viable over Slash to let Charizard support its teammates with paralysis while gaining a more solid midground option, but the damage leaves much to be desired.</p> <p>Fire Spin Charizard can be used on a wide variety of offensive teams thanks to its incredible coverage and Speed. It's an effective lead, possessing the coverage and fast Fire Spin necessary to ensure early-game momentum against other leads like Poliwhirl and Mr. Mime. However, Rapidash can be problematic and compete for the lead slot due to being faster with its own Fire Spin. Charizard's better long-term presence means the two are about equally good leads. If not used as a lead, Charizard is best brought in aggressively, such as against weakened Pokemon or a predicted Earthquake. Charizard's Fire Spin can be used to apply pressure through chip damage against the opposing team, especially if a Pokemon has been poisoned, allowing Charizard to swiftly whittle them down and KO with its powerful coverage. If using Swords Dance, Charizard should only set up if a sweep is assured or if it helps break down a Pokemon asleep from Rest like Blastoise. It is also valid to use Swords Dance if both Charizard and an opposing Pokemon are paralyzed, as it reapplies the foe's Speed drop and may let Charizard win out, but these situations are rare and ideally avoided.</p> "

Thanks to these traits, it's best to use Swords Dance Charizard on aggressive teams featuring sleepers like Venomoth, as well as Fire Spin pivots such as Rapidash or Ninetales, which can help Charizard find opportunities to set up and sweep. Pairing it with a Water-type attacker like Seadra is also helpful, providing a two-pronged physical and special offense. Plus, Seadra ensures Pokemon like Golem—which fare well against this set—can't come in for free. Seadra and Blastoise can reliably get opposing Blastoise to use Rest in prolonged interactions, which opens up its team to Charizard's setup.</p> "

Additionally, STAB Fire Blast lets it immediately threaten teams featuring Grass-types like Tangela and Venusaur, which normally perform admirably against teams using staple Normal-types like Persian and Kangaskhan.

In Tentacruel's case, Charizard can potentially win the Speed tie if it stays in, but Surf often causes it to lose if it hasn't set up prior. Because Charizard is reliant on its Speed to succeed, it is also ruined by paralysis, and the threat of this frequently forces it out before it can deal any significant damage.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Charizard has a very wide movepool. Replacing Fire Blast or its fourth moveslot is feasible, though it loses its near-unresisted coverage in the process. This can end up hurting Charizard's matchups against either Grass-types like Tangela and Venusaur or Gyarados and Dragonite, both of which are hard to work around.</p> <p>Charizard can use Fire Spin to pivot out against its checks, making it more versatile and supplementing its offense. This can improve its Dragonite matchup, letting it pivot out to a Pokemon with Toxic, such as Persian. However, the punishment for missing with Charizard can be paralysis, which it can't afford with its wallbreaking role. Worse still, Fire Spin often ends up inviting in checks like Tentacruel, Gyarados, and Vaporeon, which take minimal damage while forcing Charizard out. Other Pokemon tend to make better use of Fire Spin, most notably Moltres, which has higher Special, and Rapidash, which has higher Speed, notably outpacing Tentacruel. Both have access to Agility as well, letting them use the aggressive AgiliSpin combination.</p> <p>Counter is a fringe option for Persian, Kangaskhan, and Dodrio, all of which have powerful Normal-type STAB moves. Counter is useful if Charizard survives a Hyper Beam to fire back during the recharge turn, which indirectly gives Charizard a switch-in opportunity. Charizard can also use Hyper Beam itself, which is an incredibly strong finisher if one decides to use an even more aggressive set. In fact, Charizard can even 2HKO Vaporeon with +2 Earthquake followed by Hyper Beam. However, this further increases Charizard's reliance on Swords Dance and leaves it without a midground option. Mega Kick is also a valid option for 2HKOing Vaporeon half the time, though its utility outside of this is questionable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Paralysis: Charizard cannot deal with paralysis at all, often being forced out by the threat of it. Without its Speed, Charizard loses its valuable Speed tie against Tentacruel and can be chipped down by Wrap and dispatched with Surf. Kadabra and Electabuzz outspeed Charizard while threatening it with Thunder Wave,making them common switch-ins to Swords Dance attempts. Electabuzz is particularly notable for having STAB Thunderbolt, which 2HKOes Charizard. Thus, these Pokemon must be paralyzed—or ideally, removed—if Charizard is to attempt a sweep. Charizard can situationally win if they're paralyzed, as +2 Earthquake OHKOes Electabuzz and has a small chance to OHKO Kadabra. Furthermore, Body Slam paralyzing them on the switch can completely turn the tables on them. Tangela, while being 2HKOed by Fire Blast and disliking burns, can paralyze Charizard with Stun Spore, meaning it should be chipped into KO range. Body Slam users such as Dodrio, Kangaskhan, Gyarados, Dragonite, and Vaporeon are also minor ways for Charizard to be paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite: Without Toxic, Fire Spin, or a lucky Fire Blast burn, Charizard can't hinder AgiliWrap Dragonite, thus letting it switch in, set up, and take over the game from there. Furthermore, even non-AgiliWrap variants can threaten Charizard directly with a 2HKO from Blizzard or paralysis from Body Slam, as well as a 2HKO from Thunderbolt with minor chip damage prior.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Without switching in on a predicted Rest and setting up, Charizard fails to make an impact against the Water-types of the tier. Gyarados is notable for being immune to Earthquake, only being remotely threatened with a 3HKO from +2 Body Slam, and KOing Charizard with Hydro Pump if it's taken even minor damage. Vaporeon and Dewgong can survive a 2HKO from +2 Earthquake while threatening back with their STAB moves, dealing massive damage. Omastar can OHKO Charizard a quarter of the time with Hydro Pump but takes significant damage from +2 Earthquake. Tentacruel can shut Charizard down with Wrap and deals massive damage with Surf, but +2 Earthquake OHKOes it half the time, making this a matchup it can't really afford to play into due to its high value. Generally, if any Water-type uses Rest and Charizard switches in, it can make use of those free turns to win, but it must KO them by the turn they wake up to not lose momentum.</p> <p><strong>Aerodactyl: Aerodactyl is the only Pokemon in the entire game to resist the combination of Fire, Normal, and Ground, which makes it effective at revenge killing Charizard. While it can't afford to take a burn, Aerodactyl shrugs off any attack Charizard throws at it while threatening a 3HKO with two Double-Edge uses followed by Hyper Beam. Aerodactyl can also use Toxic on rare Fire Spin variants to cause Charizard to take more damage than Fire Spin deals.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Coverage</strong>: Dugtrio and Kangaskhan can't switch in on Fire Blast by threat of a burn, but both 2HKO Charizard with Rock Slide. Dugtrio is of particular note for excellently revenge killing Charizard, as it outspeeds it. However, Dugtrio cannot switch in on Body Slam, which may incapacitate it with paralysis. Additionally, if Dugtrio or Kangaskhan has taken damage, Charizard is likely to come out on top with Fire Blast, which has a strong probability to 2HKO both. Golem, while rare, can OHKO Charizard with Rock Slide, but it is threatened with a 2HKO from +2 Earthquake, and Fire Blast burns ruin its valuable Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Articuno: While outsped and 2HKOed by Fire Blast, Articuno can OHKO Charizard with Blizzard half the time, so Charizard can only really afford to fight Articuno if it has already taken damage. Articuno has ample opportunity to switch in on Earthquake as well, which forces Charizard to either gamble on a critical hit or switch out. In the event Charizard uses Fire Spin, it can chip Articuno down to Fire Blast range, but this will take around seven turns at minimum without critical hits, all of which risk a miss or low Fire Spin duration.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Swords Dance is essential for Charizard to do any significant damage to many foes, as its Attack is initially quite mediocre. Fire Blast is very powerful, 2HKOing Articuno, Venusaur, and Tangela. The burn chance is also highly beneficial for incapacitating resistant Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Tentacruel, and some Dragonite and Gyarados variants. However, it arguably benefits Persian, which can no longer be paralyzed—and Slash bypasses the Attack drop. Earthquake is Charizard's best chance at beating Tentacruel during the Speed ties. At +2, it OHKOes Electabuzz, Raichu, and Haunter, as well as Tentacruel half the time; it also 2HKOes Omastar. Charizard's last moveslot is largely based on its team, but one of the two choices is crucial for providing near-unresisted coverage alongside Earthquake. Body Slam is a solid fourth move for its paralysis chance, giving Charizard a midground option and having much higher damage output when boosted with Swords Dance. On the other hand, Slash is a near-guaranteed critical hit, making it almost equal to Hyper Beam and thus giving Charizard immediate power; however, it ignores boosts and thus lacks synergy with Swords Dance.</p> <p>Charizard succeeds as a wallbreaker and is thus an effective punishment for Pokemon using Rest. Most notably, it can switch in on a predicted Rest from Hypno, set up Swords Dance, and threaten up to 51.2% damage with Earthquake. This forces Hypno to either attempt to Rest stall or switch out, both of which are less than ideal situations. Similarly, Pokemon like Omastar fail to wall Charizard if it switches in on their Rests. Despite this, Charizard should not set up without prior scouting, as the mere risk of it setting up often prompts an immediate switch-in from the opponent, which can be anything from a counter to a paralysis spreader, the latter of which makes it little more than death fodder. Charizard is very capable of sweeping late-game once such checks are removed.</p> <p>Charizard is best used on teams that struggle against those featuring Venusaur and Tangela, which often employ Articuno to set up against a sleeping Pokemon and sweep. Persian makes another excellent partner, being faster than Tentacruel while profiting heavily from the openings Charizard can provide against common defensive cores. Like many Pokemon, Charizard benefits significantly from Hypno, which grants it significant openings with its longevity, paralysis, and sleep. Teams using Charizard should account for its lack of defensive utility: the most it can offer is double switching into Earthquake. Bulky Water-types like Omastar and Dewgong cover its weaknesses very well, being resistant to Ice and Water at once; Omastar particularly benefits thanks to Charizard's immunity to Earthquake. Pokemon immune to Electric also very helpful, coming with the added bonus of limiting the spread of Thunder Wave paralysis. Dugtrio works particularly well, as its Speed and power ensure it keeps momentum after absorbing Thunder Wave. Charizard also tends to draw in Grass- or Water-types that try to check it, allowing Dugtrio to force damage onto them; however, other Pokemon like Aerodactyl and Gyarados can also perform this task admirably. Because Charizard cannot normally deal with Dragonite without a Fire Blast burn, Dragonite checks such as the ubiquitous Tentacruel, Gyarados, Articuno, and Toxic users such as Aerodactyl, Persian, Dugtrio, and Kangaskhan are all viable teammates.</p> "

    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Mr. Mime and Clefable define RBY NU, but Blastoise is the glue that holds it together. Blastoise is the catch-all check to Fire- and Water-types and the main line of defense against an early Charizard sweep. It's also one of the few Pokemon able to take a hit from Golem, forcing it out immediately with Surf. Blastoise's offense cannot be discounted due to the lack of recovery in NU; even checks like Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Electrode hate taking a Surf as they enter, and many switch-ins fear Body Slam paralysis too. Blastoise often ends up serving as a check to itself, since switching in against it is so difficult. Nothing but Electrode can 2HKO Blastoise without a critical hit, allowing it to trade hits effectively with almost any foe, and the threat of Counter makes it difficult for foes to unleash Hyper Beam with impunity, lest Blastoise switch in and punish them.</p> <p>Blastoise's biggest flaw is its mediocre Speed, which leaves it open to Venomoth entering to put it to sleep. Blastoise is so critical that allowing this is often game-losing, but switching out gives Venomoth even more momentum; this interaction makes it extremely hard to use Blastoise early-game. Even with sleep off the table, Mr. Mime, Nidoking, and Kabutops all outspeed it and will invariably damage it heavily should it stay and fight. Blastoise also struggles to check Kingler and Kabutops; while it easily weakens both into KO range of allies like Charizard or Mr. Mime, losing Blastoise early in the process can make Charizard or Moltres a major threat. Also, once Blastoise has lost roughly 45% of its HP, it's no longer an effective switch-in to unparalyzed Charizard, which can use Swords Dance as it enters and OHKO it with Hyper Beam from this range. Further, Blastoise usually draws opposing Blastoise in, and they tend to trade with each other. Blastoise thus only gets one or two switch-in opportunities per game, but the opponent will pay a price to remove it for their sweepers.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Blastoise has a plethora of niche options that can substitute for Counter or its fourth move. Toxic is a potential response to Charizard's or Moltres's Fire Spin and can also help to defeat opposing Blastoise without risking Counter. Rest allows Blastoise to eternally wall Ninetales and Seadra and can assist in Toxic stalling opposing Blastoise, but using it allows Mr. Mime and Swords Dance users free entry. Rest is best used to secure endgames against foes lacking setup, rather than as a mid-game defensive play. Blastoise may also consider Hydro Pump, sacrificing accuracy for power. It 2HKOes Moltres, possibly 2HKOes Kabutops, and 3HKOes Clefable. Ice Beam over Blizzard guarantees a 2HKO against Exeggcute without risking a miss chance, but it gives worse damage against other targets. Earthquake is Blastoise's strongest attack versus Electrode and the extremely rare Gastly, 2HKOing the former and having a 59% chance to OHKO the latter. Finally, Bubble Beam can drop the Speed of Nidoking or Charizard, and it doesn't forfeit the 2HKO if Surf follows it up, potentially allowing Blastoise to fish for an even better situation with no downside. In an emergency, it may stop Charizard from setting up and sweeping late-game.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Users: Nearly all teams contain a Mr. Mime, which outspeeds Blastoise and 3HKOes it with Thunderbolt if it can switch in safely. Clefable, while slower, has superior bulk, switches safely into Body Slam, and threatens a Thunderbolt 3HKO or Thunder Wave. Electrode's STAB Thunderbolt is a 2HKO with a high critical hit rate, forcing Blastoise out. However, Mr. Mime and Electrode fear Body Slam paralysis and are generally frail, so they're usually only able to revenge kill.</p> <p><strong>Venomoth</strong>: Venomoth outspeeds Blastoise and can easily enter after a KO or switch into Surf. Blastoise is often a team's defensive centerpiece and cannot afford to take sleep early-game, which gives Venomoth a free sleep attempt as Blastoise switches out, compensating for Sleep Powder's shaky accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Blastoise</strong>: Blastoise will often trade hits with its opposing counterpart, which is often a team's only reliable Blastoise switch-in, resulting in one Blastoise being KOed and the other being severely weakened in most cases. Smart prediction with Counter may result in one Blastoise still having significant health left, but in most cases the winning Blastoise can be revenge killed by nearly any foe.</p> <p><strong>Kingler and Kabutops</strong>: Both Water-type Swords Dance users are middling checks to Blastoise, removing it but ensuring their own demise shortly after. However, a trade often suits them, as Blastoise is usually more valuable. Kingler is just bulky enough to use Swords Dance in front of Blastoise and KO or severely weaken it, often leaving a team with no further check to Charizard. Similarly, Kabutops can win the one-on-one fight or weaken Blastoise into KO range of other threats.</p> ",

Seismic Toss enables Blastoise to duel opposing Blastoise and Seadra, 4HKOing both. Counter plays off of this interaction and deals 55.4% to opposing Blastoise after a Seismic Toss. It also lets Blastoise send back Charizard's or Kabutops's Slash twice over, heavily punishing anything they switch into, and Counter can return massive damage after switching into Hyper Beam from Kingler, Raticate, or Clefable. Raticate also must fear a Counter on Super Fang, usually forcing it to use Thunderbolt instead. Blastoise's final moveslot is more flexible. Body Slam can potentially hobble Mr. Mime or Electrode as they switch in, or it can gain an advantage versus opposing Blastoise without risking a massive Counter. Blizzard is also a possibility, notably 2HKOing Exeggcute and the occasional Fearow while potentially freezing other foes.</p> <p>Blastoise is a mainstay of every viable NU team, often forcing opposing Blastoise to trade for it, as few Pokemon can switch into it well. It can function well alongside other Water-types like Kabutops and Kingler, which can assist in fending off opposing Blastoise and Charizard. Golem is a notably good teammate for Blastoise, as it safely switches into Electric-type attacks, can exploit paralysis spread by Body Slam, and helps Blastoise check Charizard. Alternatively, Exeggcute can check Electrode and Mr. Mime after they force Blastoise out, utilizing the opportunity to land Sleep Powder. Electrode can pair surprisingly well with Blastoise, allowing it to play more aggressively, as Electrode can stop opposing Blastoise and Charizard late-game.</p> <p>Blastoise should only be sparsely used early-game, as opponents can easily send in Venomoth to get a free sleep attempt against it. Once Sleep Clause is in effect, it can come in to stop Fire-types and Golem in their tracks and force a response. This will usually lead to a Blastoise mirror match that removes both from the game or leaves them too weakened to check anything; should the opponent send in Mr. Mime or Clefable instead, Blastoise can happily hit them with Surf on entry, and then it can switch out to blockade Charizard later. If Blastoise gets in on a Slash from Charizard, the opponent also must consider the risk of a massive Counter against their switch-in. If Blastoise remains healthy late-game, it can stop an attempted sweep by Charizard, Moltres, or Seadra and secure victory.</p> "

Raticate baits switches due to its reliance on KOing with Hyper Beam, meaning Body Slam and Super Fang can punish pivots.

Raticate is ideally used on highly offensive teams that seek to leave the opposing team weakened and open to a fast attacker, whether that's Raticate itself or a teammate such as Mr. Mime or Charizard. Helpful teammates for Raticate include Golem, which can switch into Thunder Wave and help check Charizard, and paralysis spreaders like Mr. Mime and Clefable, which let Raticate defeat bulky foes such as Blastoise and opposing Clefable.</p> "

However, Raticate has a distinct niche thanks to its exclusive access to Super Fang. RBY OU is a metagame where KO ranges are a crucial factor for players to keep in mind, as nothing wants to be in range of an enemy Tauros. Super Fang's consistent damage is incredible for getting foes to these KO ranges and is guaranteed to leave a dent in anything that attempts to switch in; most importantly, Super Fang ignores type immunity against Gengar, which is one of Raticate's major strengths over Persian, as it limits the number of times that Gengar can switch in safely. Against frailer or weakened targets, Raticate can also threaten them with a Hyper Beam afterwards to KO; additionally, with its great base 97 Speed, it outpaces many Pokemon in the metagame, such as Jynx, Cloyster, and Articuno, and threatens them with massive damage.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it's not all cheddar and fruit for this humble rodent. Raticate is incredibly frail, making it difficult to switch in and repeatedly wear down foes. This, combined with Super Fang's 89.5% accuracy and 16 PP, can allow faster foes like Starmie and Alakazam with reliable one-turn recovery moves to stall out Raticate's Super Fangs until it misses or runs out of PP. Raticate isn't just frail, either: its defensive profile is decidedly mediocre, meaning it can't afford to trade blows often and thus often loses a flat one-on-one fight; Super Fang's imperfect accuracy also means that missing an attack will force Raticate to take a potentially fatal blow in return, something it cannot afford. Finally, Raticate's attacking stats are very average, which often prevents it from KOing bulkier foes even after a Super Fang. As a result of these flaws, Raticate is heavily reliant on good prediction to be effective in its role, and as such, it is not recommended for most RBY OU teams because Tauros is normally all that's necessary. Even if a \"second Tauros\" is desirable, Persian is usually the better choice.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Raticate should be used exclusively mid- to late-game when faster foes such as Starmie have been paralyzed or as an emergency Snorlax switch-in. Super Fang is obligatory, as it is Raticate's only notable niche in OU and allows it to consistently deal significant damage; notably, it's able to wear down Snorlax, one of the premier defensive Pokemon in RBY. Hyper Beam is Raticate's strongest follow-up after a Super Fang, KOing non-Reflect Chansey and Alakazam as well as Victreebel most of the time. Body Slam is spammable and allows Raticate to fish for paralysis on common switch-ins like Starmie. It's also useful after Super Fang as a way to fish for paralysis as Alakazam or Starmie uses Recover. Bubble Beam is Raticate's preferred coverage move because it is very likely to KO Rhydon after Super Fang, which is likely to switch in anticipating a Body Slam or Hyper Beam.</p> <p>While Raticate's first three moves are too important to drop, its last moveslot is more flexible; though, it should be noted that with the exception of Blizzard, replacing Bubble Beam will significantly compromise the Rhydon matchup. Thunderbolt can be used to hit Cloyster, potentially taking it out with a critical hit after a Super Fang. Tail Whip is an option that can be used to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, allowing a paralyzed Raticate to once again outspeed opposing paralyzed Pokemon while also putting foes in range for Raticate's attacks. Blizzard has a useful freeze chance and is Raticate's strongest option against Gengar and Dragonite, but it has a lower chance to KO Rhydon after a Super Fang than Bubble Beam. Finally, Quick Attack can be used to chip a faster foe such as Tauros before Raticate goes down, but it's very situational and Raticate struggles to find much room for it.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Raticate is a bit of a mixed bag. Its unique access to Super Fang allows it to weaken a Pokemon for threats like Dodrio to clean up later or outright KO foes itself with Hyper Beam. Not only that, Raticate also has an interesting special movepool that it can tap into akin to Persian, making it possible to fine-tune for a team. Raticate is also in a very unique Speed tier, being just above Haunter, and is immune to Body Slam paralysis thanks to being a Normal-type. Raticate's 18.97% critical hit rate adds significant volatility to many matchups as well, making it difficult to switch into when also considering Super Fang. These factors often let Raticate score at least one Super Fang before it goes down, which is more than enough for its teammates to break through and wreak havoc. All of these factors enable Raticate to fulfil a supportive role for its team while remaining a decent sweeper in its own right.</p> <p>However, Raticate faces some stiff competition from Kangaskhan and Persian, which possess much better stats, coverage, and general offensive potential. In addition, Raticate has poor special bulk, with attacks like Tentacruel's Surf being a guaranteed 2HKO. This makes it a nightmare to bring in without heavy support or one-for-one trades. Furthermore, Raticate relies heavily on its Speed to make progress, making paralysis a death sentence due to its fragility. Overall, this makes Raticate a high-risk, high-reward Pokemon.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Bubble Beam can replace Blizzard to 2HKO Golem or KO after a Super Fang on the switch. In addition, Bubble Beam's chance to lower Speed can let Raticate beat normally faster Pokemon that switch in expecting a Blizzard, such as Tentacruel. Without Blizzard, though, Raticate doesn't have a convincing way of stopping Dragonite from paralyzing it with Thunder Wave. Thunder can be used for a better matchup against Gyarados, possessing a guaranteed KO after Super Fang. It has little use outside of this, however, as Omastar and Vaporeon are only 2HKOed after Super Fang and will always win prolonged interactions. It is possible for Raticate to run two special moves at once—usually Blizzard and either Thunder or Bubble Beam—though this comes at the cost of Body Slam's consistency and potentially game-changing paralysis chance.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Haunter: Raticate can still halve Haunter's HP with Super Fang, but Blizzard does extremely poor damage. On the other hand, Haunter can 3HKO Raticate with Thunderbolt or put it to sleep with Hypnosis. Raticate will sometimes win one-on-one thanks to its Speed and Super Fang, but this is not consistent enough to recommend.</p> <p><strong>Omastar</strong>: Omastar resists Raticate's STAB moves, doesn't get OHKOed after a Super Fang, and easily 2HKOes Raticate with Hydro Pump. Omastar can switch in on a Hyper Beam, forcing Raticate out after it recharges and inflicting significant damage in the process. Raticate can use Thunder to try and get a better matchup, but Omastar takes no more than 36.1%, thus still winning one-on-one unless paralysis or critical hits are involved.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Raticate's best qualities are its Speed and access to Super Fang, which forces slower threats to take significant damage before they can land a hit. Ergo, paralysis is a massive threat to its success, and Raticate should avoid chipping threats that can paralyze it. Paralysis's Speed drop exposes Raticate's extreme fragility while further reducing the consistency of Super Fang, making it effectively dead weight in many situations. Threats like Hypno, Tangela, Dragonite, and Electabuzz that can paralyze Raticate force it out unless they're chipped already. Once Raticate has scored a KO, opponents often bring these Pokemon in, causing the Raticate user to lose a significant amount of momentum. It should be noted that Hypno and paralyzed Electabuzz can't switch into Raticate, as Super Fang + Hyper Beam has a favorable chance to KO them outright. Dragonite also can't switch into Raticate, as Blizzard will KO it after Super Fang.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types like Tentacruel and Vaporeon possess very effective ways to force out Raticate. Tentacruel can switch in on Super Fang if it isn't paralyzed and subsequently scare Raticate out with a 2HKO from Surf. However, Tentacruel is threatened with an outright KO from Super Fang + Hyper Beam. Vaporeon, on the other hand, survives Hyper Beam after a Super Fang and can still 2HKO Raticate with Surf.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: Golem's Rock typing lets it easily switch in on Raticate's Hyper Beam and 2HKO it with Earthquake. Should Raticate lack a super effective move against Golem, it is very likely to lose the matchup. However, after a Super Fang, Raticate has a 41% chance to KO Golem with Blizzard and KOes it outright with Bubble Beam.</p> ",

Raticate is best switched in on passive foes that won't damage it, such as those immobilized by Wrap or about to use Recover or Rest. Smart double switching is also a good way to bring it in. However, bringing in Raticate to revenge kill a threat isn't out of the question either, especially if that threat is a faster Pokemon that has been bogged down with paralysis. Raticate should be playing hit-and-run first and foremost, as not only is it frail, but landing a Super Fang is more than enough to leave foes open to exploitation by Raticate's teammates anyway.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Fearow’s combination of high Attack, Normal-type STAB, and excellent Speed make it one of the most dangerous physical attackers in the tier. It is a deadly offensive threat throughout the game, blasting opponents with powerful attacks in the early- and mid-game and single-handedly cleaning up a weakened team. It can also be used effectively as a lead, dishing out heavy damage from the first turn. Since the only relevant threat that outspeeds Fearow is Rapidash, anything that switches in will most likely be taking two attacks, making it extremely difficult to switch into safely. Fearow's high critical hit ratio of 19.53% means that an otherwise-safe switch-in can potentially be put in a dangerous situation. However, Fearow is quite frail, and although its Flying typing offers a nice immunity to Ground-type moves, it doesn’t have any other notable resistances and is weak to common moves such as Blizzard and Thunderbolt. Double-Edge's recoil also hinders its longevity. Fearow is very reliant on its Speed since it can’t afford to take many hits, which also makes it afraid of paralysis, though its Normal typing prevents paralysis from Body Slam. Fearow is also afraid of being burned by Fire Blast. Fearow is completely walled by Graveler and to a lesser extent Omanyte. Both Rock-types resist Fearow’s STAB combination and are capable of hitting it back with super effective damage, so it requires some team support to deal with them before it can achieve its destructive potential.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>All four moves in Fearow's standard set are very important, so other options are generally not recommended for Fearow. If you do want to use another option, you should replace Agility since Double-Edge, Drill Peck, and Hyper Beam are much more important. Mirror Move can be used to punish Nidoqueen’s Blizzard by copying the move and hitting it back with super effective damage, but Fearow’s low Special means it actually does less damage than Hyper Beam, and Nidoqueen can use the safer but weaker Thunderbolt or just switch out to render Mirror Move useless. Mirror Move can also be used to let Fearow switch into Nidoqueen and even Graveler’s Earthquakes, then hit them super effectively with Earthquake the next turn. Toxic can be used on a predicted Graveler or Omanyte switch-in to wear it down over the course of a game, making it easier for Fearow to break through. However, the damage from poison is very low, and a wrong prediction could accidentally make an opposing Pokemon immune to paralysis. Lastly, Substitute can be used to ease prediction and punish switches, but Fearow can still be paralyzed while behind a Substitute.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Paralysis: Fearow hates being paralyzed since high Speed is one of its most important assets. Because of this, Fearow has to run from Pokemon it would otherwise easily beat, such as Porygon, Dragonair, Drowzee, Staryu, and the rare Slowpoke. Dragonair and Porygon in particular can 2HKO Fearow with Blizzard. However, since most paralysis spreaders are frail, Fearow can KO them with Hyper Beam if they’ve taken a bit of chip damage, and a critical hit Hyper Beam OHKOes every Thunder Wave user outright.</p> <p><strong>Fire-Types: Although Rapidash cannot switch into Fearow since it is unlikely to survive Double-Edge followed up by Hyper Beam, it is able to outspeed Fearow and has a 36.3% chance to 2HKO with Fire Blast; this becomes guaranteed after factoring in Double-Edge recoil. Fire Blast can also burn Fearow, effectively rendering it useless. Arcanine is slower than Fearow but is bulky enough to always survive a Double-Edge followed up by Hyper Beam and does the same amount of damage as Rapidash.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Graveler and Omanyte can switch into Fearow and take its hits well. Graveler takes a maximum of 17.2% from Double-Edge, while Omanyte takes a maximum of 21.9%. Graveler’s Rock Slide and Omanyte’s Blizzard both do massive damage to Fearow, 2HKOing it.</p> <p><strong>Nidoqueen</strong>: Nidoqueen is able to survive a Double-Edge followed by Hyper Beam and hit Fearow super effectively with Blizzard. Although it loses to Fearow one-on-one if it switches in, Blizzard will do enough damage for a teammate to finish Fearow off.</p> <p><strong>Sandslash:</strong> Although rare, Sandslash is able to survive two of Fearow's Double-Edges followed up by Hyper Beam, and it 2HKOes with Rock Slide after factoring in Double-Edge recoil.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Double-Edge and Drill Peck are Fearow’s STAB options. Double-Edge is the more powerful of the two, but reckless use will quickly rack up heavy recoil damage. Drill Peck is slightly weaker, but it lacks recoil and hits Pinsir and Machamp super effectively, which is useful since they are two of the most physically bulky Pokemon in the tier. Drill Peck also cleanly 2HKOes Gastly, which would otherwise wall Fearow. Fearow’s Hyper Beam is extremely powerful, dealing a minimum of 73.3% to Drowzee and 81.7% to Staryu, making it an excellent Pokemon to finish off these physically frail foes after minimal chip damage. Hyper Beam also does a lot against bulkier Pokemon, dealing a minimum of 42.8% to Nidoqueen and a minimum of 53.9% to Seaking. Two Double-Edges followed by Hyper Beam is guaranteed to KO every non-resistant Pokemon in the tier aside from the rare Sandslash, and more physically-frail Pokemon are put into Hyper Beam range after just one Double-Edge. A critical hit Double-Edge puts almost every Pokemon into Hyper Beam KO range, and a critical hit Hyper Beam will OHKO most of the tier outright, making switching into a predicted Hyper Beam very risky. Agility allows Fearow to outspeed Rapidash and negates Speed drop from paralysis. Agility is most useful late-game when Fearow is ready to sweep a weakened team.</p> <p>Seaking and Staryu are both excellent teammates for Fearow, since they are able to switch into Rapidash, Arcanine, Graveler, and Omanyte and force them out, although they both fear paralysis from Body Slam. Seaking is a better switch-in than Staryu though, as it is bulkier and doesn't mind Body Slam paralysis as much thanks to Agility. The Water-types can also switch into Nidoqueen’s Blizzard in dire situations, with a healthy Staryu even beating Nidoqueen one-on-one after switching into Blizzard. Porygon is a fantastic teammate thanks to its ability to switch in to Graveler and Omanyte. Pinsir and Rapidash are also excellent teammates that can use Bind and Fire Spin to get opposing Pokemon into Fearow’s Hyper Beam range and give Fearow a free switch, which is extremely helpful considering Fearow's frailty. They also help Fearow wear down shared checks in Graveler and Omanyte. Pinsir’s Submission does a decent amount of damage to the Rock-types, while Rapidash can potentially burn them with Fire Blast. Additionally, Machamp is able to comfortably switch into Graveler's Rock Slide and threaten both Rock-types with a powerful Earthquake or Submission. Ironically, Omanyte is also a good teammate thanks to its ability to switch into a Rapidash or Arcanine that tries to revenge kill Fearow. Although they are hard to fit on a team, Vileplume and Weepinbell threaten both Graveler and Omanyte with 4x super effective damage, making them great checks to Fearow’s main walls. They can also try to paralyze a Rapidash or Arcanine that switches into them with Stun Spore, making them much easier for Fearow to handle later.</p> "

Pokemon that can force damage on Golem and Kabutops, which are hard checks to Fearow, also make for great teammates. Super Fang Raticate, that carry either Blizzard or Bubble Beam for Golem and Thunderbolt for Kabutops can very effectively weaken the respective check for Fearow, making it a perfect teammate. Swords Dance Earthquake Charizard can also take huge chunks of HP off these Rock-types. Having these additional faster Pokemon often means the opponent's speed control beyond paralysis can easily be overwhelmed. In matchups without opposing Rock-types, Fearow's unresisted STAB moves can be used to its heart's content, 2HKOing other metagame staples like Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Venomoth and opening up holes in defensive Pokemon like Kingler and Blastoise, although it must be wary of Counter from the latter.

It's then able to outspeed them and pivot out with Wrap, allowing a teammate more suitable for the matchup to come in while they're immobilized. Earthquake lets Arbok threaten Pokemon that resist its Normal-type attacks, such as Haunter, Omastar, and Golem, as well as ensuring Tentacruel can't switch in for free. Hyper Beam is Arbok's strongest attack, notably KOing Kadabra at 65% and Dugtrio at 54%. This makes it an excellent move for finishing off foes that have been repeatedly chipped down by Arbok's Wrap. Alternatively, Rock Slide grants Arbok unresisted coverage alongside Earthquake, as well as giving it a much better matchup versus Flying-types such as Aerodactyl, Articuno, and Gyarados.</p> <p>Arbok has a very peculiar place on Wrap spam teams that feature additional Wrappers like Dragonite or Pinsir, as it's able to block Toxic from foes such as Persian and Aerodactyl, then threaten them with Glare thereafter. In general, Arbok and Dragonite pair well with each other, as Dragonite also checks Dugtrio, which threatens Arbok with its mighty STAB Earthquake. Arbok also appreciates a Pokemon that checks Psychic-types, so Kadabra and the ubiquitous Hypno pair with it well. Arbok is best used mid-game, spreading paralysis to support endgame sweeps and pivoting into its teammates as needed.</p> <p>Arbok does not have very many other options, as they generally sacrifice consistency and it doesn't have the stats to take advantage of them well. Body Slam allows Arbok to threaten both paralysis and damage at the same time, deterring switch-ins, but the damage is miniscule due to a lack of STAB and the paralysis chance is low compared to Glare. Acid is Arbok's best STAB move, doing more damage to Tangela than Earthquake or Rock Slide while having a high chance to drop Defense, which allows Arbok to deal further damage, encourage predictable switching, and reapply paralysis Speed drops.</p> "

Despite its defensive typing letting it pivot into Toxic, which cripples other wrappers, it is abysmal overall: Arbok not only fails to resist notable offensive types, but is also quite vulnerable to a multitude of popular Ground- and Psychic-types like Golem, Exeggcute, and Mr. Mime. Although Arbok boasts higher Speed, Defense, and Attack than Dragonair, the latter’s Agility, Thunder Wave, and superior typing mean it will usually be the better choice.

      "overview": "<p>Raichu has a niche in UU as an Electric-type that can threaten Ground-types like Golem thanks to its access to Surf. The combination of Surf and STAB Thunderbolt gives it excellent coverage and sweeping potential that can be difficult for many teams to handle. In addition, Raichu's Speed allows it to tie with the ever-present Tentacruel, as well as Dodrio. On top of that, the 19.53% critical hit rate its base Speed provides makes it surprisingly powerful offensively. It can further increase this Speed while invalidating the Speed drop from paralysis thanks to Agility, which comes with the added bonus of outspeeding Dugtrio. Furthermore, Raichu is quite customizable, possessing a wide movepool with moves like Body Slam and Seismic Toss to make use of.</p> <p>However, Raichu is physically frail, taking significant damage from threats like Dodrio, Persian, and Kangaskhan. In fact, it's not uncommon to see Raichu get KOed by their STAB Hyper Beams from around 80%. This fragility notably comes into play against Dugtrio, which can KO it consistently with Earthquake if it's taken even a minute amount of damage. It's not stellar on the Special end either, with threats like Tentacruel, Vaporeon, Hypno, and Kadabra all claiming 3HKOs on it with their STAB attacks. This has a negative effect on its offenses as well, with its Thunderbolt only 3HKOing Vaporeon and occasionally missing the OHKO on Gyarados. Raichu also competes heavily with Electabuzz for a place on teams, which has higher Speed than tier-king Tentacruel without the need to boost.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Raichu's customizable nature gives it a fair amount of room to explore alternative options without much opportunity cost. However, Thunderbolt and Surf should never be dropped, as they are what allow it to perform well in the tier. If using Agility, Hyper Beam is quite desirable for closing out games against Pokemon like Hypno and Kadabra, which may come in to try and stop a sweep. It serves as Raichu's single best option against opposing Electric- and Grass-types, dealing surprisingly high damage to them and enabling it to break through. Seismic Toss is another appealing option, allowing Raichu to fight Grass-types like Tangela and Venusaur and Electric-types like Electabuzz and opposing Raichu. Surf tends to deal more damage to other Pokemon, though, making Seismic Toss a bit more specific in utility. Thunder has a significant enough damage difference to net Raichu near-guaranteed 2HKOs on Persian, Kangaskhan, Tentacruel, and Vaporeon and an OHKO against Dodrio, but the inconsistency makes it difficult to recommend, especially considering Raichu's fragility. Substitute can be used to give Raichu an opportunity to scout and spread paralysis without needing to predict. It has the added benefit of letting Raichu safely fish for critical hits and full paralysis. It also makes Raichu an even better Dugtrio lure, letting it fish for a critical hit from Surf to OHKO it or paralysis from Body Slam without taking massive damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Tangela is one of the few Pokemon in the tier that resists Raichu's Thunderbolt + Surf combination, and, as a result, Raichu can't do much to it. The only way for Raichu to win is through Seismic Toss, but even then, Tangela's Stun Spore will paralyze Raichu and put it into an awkward position. Tangela will usually use Raichu as setup fodder thereafter, picking up Growth boosts or using it to pivot out with Bind. While less common, Venusaur is also a large threat to Raichu's success, resisting everything thrown at it while threatening with Sleep Powder or a 3HKO with Razor Leaf. In addition, it's only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss, which is, unfortunately, Raichu's best bet at trying to win.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Raichu is extremely frail on the physical side, and there are threats in RBY UU that are well equipped to exploit this. Kangaskhan and Dodrio can KO Raichu from well above half HP with Hyper Beam, meaning all Raichu can do is threaten them with Thunder Wave if it's at full HP. Furthermore, Persian can revenge kill Raichu from half HP with Slash if it hasn't set up Agility. On the flip side, Raichu can fight back hard against all of these threats; none of them want to switch into Thunder Wave, Dodrio falls to Thunderbolt if it's taken any amount of damage, and Kangaskhan takes heavy damage from any special hit. As a result, while Raichu is very threatened by these Pokemon, they really don't want to switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite can shrug off Thunder Wave with its own Agility and KO Raichu with Hyper Beam from 68.7% onwards. This can be facilitated through Wrap, which gradually chips Raichu into KO range; at minimum, it takes five Wrap uses for Raichu to be placed in Hyper Beam range. Raichu can't deal much damage to Dragonite at all, with Thunderbolt dealing less than 30%. As a result, Raichu is forced out.</p> <p><strong>Hypno</strong>: Hypno can take Raichu's attacks quite well by virtue of its excellent special bulk. This, combined with Thunder Wave and the power of Psychic, enables it to check Raichu well. However, it can only check Raichu from full HP, as, otherwise, it's very possible for Raichu to break through with critical hits. Alternatively, Raichu can use Hypno as setup fodder for Agility if it has used Rest, especially if brought in on the turn Hypno uses it, but it needs multiple critical hits to break through in this scenario. Furthermore, it risks paralysis and heavy damage in the process.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raichu tends to struggle against opposing Electric-types, as they take mediocre damage from Surf while resisting Thunderbolt. Electabuzz tends to win one-on-one with Seismic Toss while being faster and threatening with paralysis. Opposing Raichu may also be equipped to win against your own depending on the set, with moves such as Seismic Toss and Hyper Beam further complicating matters for the electric rodent.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Raichu can't stomach Dugtrio's Earthquake if it's taken any amount of damage, and Dugtrio's 23.4% critical hit rate makes it an even more decisive matchup. However, if Raichu has set up Agility or if Dugtrio is switching in, Dugtrio has to risk getting hit with Surf, which 2HKOes it. This also means that Dugtrio has a lot of trouble beating Raichu if it's been paralyzed prior to the interaction. Body Slam is also a risk for Dugtrio, potentially paralyzing it and allowing Raichu to take it out if it's taken damage prior.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Thunderbolt and Surf provide Raichu with nigh-unresisted coverage, making it challenging to counter once it's in safely. Thunder Wave gives Raichu ample opportunity to spread paralysis for its teammates, which can be helpful for forcing out faster threats like Persian and Tentacruel. Agility enables Raichu to double its Speed, making it difficult to revenge kill or pin down with Wrap. This is very important, as, in RBY, boosting Speed allows Raichu to ignore the Speed drop from paralysis. However, Body Slam can be used instead to paralyze threats like Dugtrio switching in and beat physically frail Pokemon like Kadabra.</p> <p>Raichu wants to set up Agility to sweep through weakened teams, and it should be kept healthy so Dugtrio cannot KO it after surviving Surf. As such, Raichu does best mid- or late-game. While setting up can be difficult in RBY UU at times, Raichu has a decent amount of freedom to set up Agility, as it can afford to take a hit if Dugtrio is absent or unable to survive Surf. Forcing out Pokemon like Omastar, which can't handle Raichu's coverage, can also allow Raichu to set up. Sleeping Pokemon can be fairly useful for Raichu to set up against; however, bulkier Pokemon like Hypno may be difficult if the sleep was induced by Rest, as Raichu can't KO it before it wakes up.</p> <p>Raichu tends to find points of entry through Wrap pivots like Tentacruel, ensuring safety from physical attacks. However, it can switch into weaker special attackers if necessary, as well as more passive Pokemon using recovery moves. Thanks to its Speed and coverage, it also makes a good revenge killer, especially after an Explosion, which usually softens up a threat for Raichu to consistently threaten the KO. On the flip side, Raichu's Speed can let it switch in on opposing Wrap, though with repeated switches it may take enough chip damage to enter KO range for strong physical attacks. This only gets worse if the Wrap user pivots out to a counter. Ergo, switching into Wrap even a few times severely limits Raichu's ability to take hits and check threats, so this risk should only be taken if heavy-hitting physical attackers like Dugtrio have been accounted for or removed, or if Raichu can reliably threaten to KO the Wrap user. Raichu finds itself on teams that benefit from its ability to check Rock- and Ground-types that threaten teammates like Dodrio and Persian, making them effective lures for said Rock- and Ground-types.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Sandslash is often overlooked in RBY OU, but it realizes a dangerous niche with its unique combination of typing, movepool, and Speed tier. After a Swords Dance, Sandslash can 2HKO every Pokemon in the tier, and it is just fast enough to outpace many crucial threats, including Rhydon, Chansey, and Exeggutor. It is frail in comparison to Rhydon and Golem and hits less hard, making it a poor pivot. However, it is faster, can sweep with Swords Dance, and beats the two one-on-one by virtue of its Ground neutrality. Its winning matchup against Rhydon, Electric immunity, and consistent STAB Earthquake make up for its lower offensive stats. In particular, its Thunder Wave immunity provides both a consistent entry point and a partial safeguard against sweep-ending paralysis, a weakness that plagues all other viable Swords Dance users. Unfortunately, Sandslash's lack of Normal and Flying resistances means it can't be a primary physical tank or a firm Zapdos answer, unlike Rhydon and Golem. It has low Speed, low Special, a plethora of weaknesses, and less Attack before setup, leaving it easily forced out and picked off. Most notably, Starmie can harry it in all stages of a battle. Unlike all other viable Swords Dance users, it misses the crucial OHKO on Chansey after a boost. Still, with paralysis support or against slower teams, Sandslash can be a potent offensive weapon while checking Rhydon, Zapdos, Jolteon, and Golem in emergencies.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sandslash has other moves that seem appealing, but all of the legitimate options have already been discussed. Rest could theoretically help it defensively, but it's too slow and burdened by weaknesses. A traditional physical tank set would be outclassed by Rhydon, Kabutops, or even Snorlax. Slash is a good move, but Kabutops uses it better, and it has poor synergy with Swords Dance. Seismic Toss is simply too weak to use, even before setting up. Toxic discourages partial trapping and forces out Reflect users, but it's too fringe and has many better users. Sand Attack can fish for safe turns to survive attacks or set up, but it's an inconsistent gimmick to spend a moveslot on.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ice-types: All OU Ice-types can easily OHKO Sandslash. Cloyster is particularly threatening, as it outspeeds Sandslash and tanks its hits for easy momentum, though Blizzard only has about a 60% chance to OHKO from full health considering its accuracy. Further, Cloyster can get overburdened as a check to many threats, and lure options like Thunderbolt Tauros and Self-Destruct Snorlax can remove it. Lapras has less physical bulk and is outsped, making it vulnerable if worn down, but it can comfortably survive a +2 hit and always OHKO with Blizzard. Articuno and Jynx fold to boosted Rock Slide and Earthquake, respectively, but they outspeed and safely revenge kill Sandslash.</p> <p><strong>Starmie: Although it requires the rare Hydro Pump to OHKO Sandlash without a critical hit, Starmie is nonetheless the most common impediment to a Sandslash sweep. Great Speed, high Special, and Recover all help Starmie check Sandslash consistently. It can have some difficulty switching in, though, as it detests being paralyzed by Body Slam and takes a solid chunk from Earthquake. Starmie also takes upwards of 74% from a +2 Earthquake, meaning Sandslash can often power through if Starmie is worn down or paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros tends to stop Sandslash dead in its tracks late-game by 2HKOing with Blizzard, serving as one of its biggest obstacles. However, it takes more than 60% from a +2 Earthquake, which can let the opposing Tauros easily win the vital mirror matchup. Oddball sets lacking Blizzard have a more difficult time, as Sandslash can sometimes survive two Body Slams into Hyper Beam. If Sandslash can boost to +4 Attack, it has good odds to OHKO Tauros with Earthquake or Submission, a feat that can often be game-deciding.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Although its improved matchup against Exeggutor is a major advantage of Sandslash over other Ground-types, it is far from guaranteed to win one-on-one. Hyper Beam misses, full paralysis from Stun Spore, and Mega Drain recovery can potentially let Exeggutor win. Even when Sandslash KOes Exeggutor, it often ends up paralyzed by Stun Spore or in Tauros's KO range. Exeggutor can, however, end up worn down throughout a match, letting Sandslash get past it more safely. In a pinch, +2 Body Slam into Hyper Beam will KO Exeggutor 84% of the time assuming both moves connect, while Earthquake or Rock Slide instead of Body Slam drops the odds to ~45% without the possibility of paralysis. If Exeggutor manages to switch into an unboosted Sandslash without taking heavy damage, the matchup shifts dramatically in Exeggutor's favor. Explosion and Mega Drain can also allow Exeggutor to force a direct trade. Beyond Exeggutor, Sandslash is completely vulnerable to Victreebel and Venusaur, being outsped and usually OHKOed while failing to OHKO either at +2, though neither enjoys switching in considering their neutrality to Earthquake and dislike of paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Fast Special Attackers: Alakazam can easily revenge kill weakened Sandslash, halting a sweep. Its prevalance in the lead matchup means it is often paralyzed, though, allowing Sandslash to OHKO it risk-free when set up. Jynx has a similar dynamic. Sandslash can try to set up on them late-game if they are paralyzed, especially with Substitute, but this is risky.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Sandslash is a shaky counter to Zapdos. It can't 2HKO Zapdos unboosted unless it runs Rock Slide, and it doesn't resist Drill Peck, making it significantly more vulnerable when switching in and after setting up. Other Flying-types have even better matchups, as Moltres threatens a burn and 2HKO with Fire Blast, while Articuno OHKOes Sandslash with just Ice Beam. Dragonite performs the best, as it is rarely OHKOed at +2 without the inferior Rock Slide, and Sandslash is both susceptible to Wrap and easily 2HKOed by Surf or Blizzard. Even niche Flying-types such as Dodrio and Gyarados can give Sandslash quite a bit of trouble. Rock Slide can substantially threaten these Pokemon, especially Moltres and Articuno, but neither are standard.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Sandslash is immune to Thunder Wave but still vulnerable to Body Slam paralysis and Exeggutor's Stun Spore, both of which heavily diminish its effectiveness. Swords Dance can somewhat compensate for this if the foe is also paralyzed, as boosting will reapply the paralysis Speed drop, rendering the foe slower. That being said, losing its already-middling Speed tier is a death sentence with Sandslash's vulnerability to special attacks, especially considering the prevalence of Ice Beam and Blizzard on slow Pokemon like Chansey, Lapras, and even Snorlax. Even independent of the Speed drop, any full paralysis turns are particularly devastating for a sweeper.</p> ",

          "name": "Swords Dance",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Swords Dance is obligatory for Sandslash's niche. STAB Earthquake provides great neutral coverage and heavily chunks the majority of the metagame after a boost. If running Body Slam, Sandslash can use Body Slam + Hyper Beam for the best odds to 2HKO Exeggutor at +2—one of its most valuable advantages over Rhydon and Golem. Body Slam also allows Sandslash to fish for paralysis on its common switch-ins, which can help it or Tauros sweep late-game. Alternatively, Rock Slide can cover Flying-types and the rare Pinsir, but it's no stronger than Earthquake against Pokemon like Cloyster, Lapras, and Exeggutor. Furthermore, Body Slam into Hyper Beam still 2HKOes Zapdos at +2. Despite its poor accuracy, Submission allows Sandslash to OHKO on Tauros at +4 and can occasionally OHKO Chansey at +2 and Snorlax at +4. Tauros often spells the end of a Sandslash sweep, so Submission is a valuable option to consider. Substitute can be used over a coverage move, as it can afford Sandslash a free turn against a paralyzed foe, though it can be difficult to set up. Substitute further amplifies Sandslash's unique ability among Swords Dance users to defeat Zapdos, as Drill Peck only breaks it around 30% of the time, which may let Sandslash set up safely and sweep.</p> <p>Sandslash can effectively check most Rock- or Electric-types, but—with the exception of Jolteon—doing so will usually prevent it from sweeping late-game. Therefore, you must determine whether a trade or the potential for a sweep is more valuable. To stay healthy to sweep, Sandslash is best brought in on Thunder Wave, partial trapping pivots, or double switches rather than directly into attacks. It greatly benefits from being hidden until late-game when it is in a position to sweep. If Sandslash is forced onto the field before a sweep is likely, it should generally lead with Body Slam to chip and potentially paralyze its checks, as using Swords Dance is rarely useful before the opponent's team has been fully scouted. When saved until late-game, Sandslash can greatly benefit from an opportunity to boost to +4, which allows Earthquake to secure OHKOs on Chansey and Starmie and OHKO Tauros a majority of the time. Additionally, +4 Hyper Beam OHKOes Zapdos about 60% of the time and Exeggutor about 40% of the time, limiting their ability to impede a sweep. Be aware that calculations for +4 Hyper Beam assume it hits and doesn't critically hit, a combined 78.09% chance, so it's riskier in practice.</p> <p>Sandslash is at its most dangerous with paralysis support, and it has good synergy with many paralysis spreaders, including Zapdos, Starmie, Snorlax, and Chansey. The offensive prowess of Zapdos and Starmie in particular often forces paralysis on the opponent's team, either neutralizing foes like Jynx, Alakazam, and opposing Starmie or providing setup opportunities against slower foes like Chansey, Snorlax, and Exeggutor. Sandslash will then greatly enjoy coming in on these foes. In return, Sandslash can set up on and threaten the slow special tanks that limit them offensively, as well as effectively checking the Rock- and Electric- types that threaten them if a sweep seems infeasible. Its reduced physical tanking capabilities versus Rhydon and Golem and its Ice weakness make Cloyster an ideal defensive partner, and Sandslash feasts on the Thunderbolts Cloyster draws in. Additionally, Sandslash shares many switch-ins with Tauros, including Cloyster, Exeggutor, Slowbro, Snorlax, and Starmie, so it often clears the way for a Tauros endgame even if it cannot sweep. Lastly, Sandslash is prone to being hamstrung by Body Slam paralysis, so Reflect Snorlax can also be effective to block that paralysis and generally help with physical tanking, despite its lower immediate physical bulk. In return, Sandslash threatens an immediate OHKO on Gengar and heavily pressures Rhydon and Golem, which can give mono-Normal Snorlax issues. Snorlax is also invaluable for drawing in, pressuring, and paralyzing Cloyster throughout a match, which is essential to Sandslash's success.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Sandslash is able to carve out a small niche in NU as the only fully evolved Ground-type that possesses Swords Dance and a neutrality to Earthquake. Thanks to its immunity to Thunder Wave, Sandslash can switch in more easily than other Swords Dance users, like Kingler and Pinsir, by predicting Thunder Wave from Pokemon like Electrode, Drowzee, and Mr. Mime. It further benefits from the coveted Earthquake + Rock Slide combination, alongside other key offensive moves like Substitute and Body Slam. Its Speed tier is also serviceable enough to outspeed key staples like Golem, Clefable, and Porygon. Lastly, Sandslash possesses good physical bulk, allowing it to combat physical attackers like Golem effectively. With paralysis support from Pokemon like Mr. Mime and Clefable, Sandslash can ravage the opposing team late-game.</p> <p>However, while having some use, Sandslash's Speed tier is still poor: the relevant Water-types of the tier, such as Kingler, Blastoise, Seadra, and Kabutops, will outspeed it, threatening significant damage before it can set up with Swords Dance. Ergo, they must be removed, severely weakened, or crippled for Sandslash to be effective. This usually causes it to rely on paralysis support, which many teams cannot afford to easily provide. Although Sandslash is immune to Thunder Wave, paralysis from Body Slam, Stun Spore, or Glare cripples its chances to sweep late-game, exposing its poor special bulk and cutting into what Speed it does have. Lastly, it faces heavy competition as a Ground-type from Nidoking and Golem: the former has a much more flexible movepool, better Speed, and a Toxic immunity, while the latter has access to STAB Rock Slide, an important resistance to Fire, more immediate power, and Explosion.</p> ",

At +2, it can threaten OHKOs on Pokemon like Electrode, Mr. Mime, and Nidoking with Earthquake. Rock Slide complements Earthquake, providing unresisted coverage and securing OHKOs on Charizard and Moltres after a boost; it also hits Pinsir and Fearow hard. Body Slam discourages switch-ins from Poliwhirl and Blastoise, potentially paralyzing them. Alternatively, Substitute can exploit predicted switches and grants Sandslash more opportunities to set up, especially given its immunity to Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Sandslash has a surprisingly interesting movepool, making it quite customizable. Slash gives Sandslash immediate power and tears through Pokemon relying on Reflect, such as Abra and rare variants of Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Wigglytuff. Toxic prevents partial trappers like AgiliWrap Dragonair, Charizard, Moltres, and Rapidash from pinning it down. Submission is its best option against Clefable, Porygon, and Wigglytuff; however, the recoil, shaky accuracy, and lower damage than Earthquake against neutral targets make it a niche option at best. Hyper Beam is Sandslash's best move against Exeggcute and matches Earthquake’s power but fails to notably hit other targets.</p> <p>As a result of its typing and good physical bulk, Sandslash can pivot in against Electrode and Golem as well as Pokemon running Rest, such as Moltres and Blastoise, which let it also break holes in the opposition with Swords Dance.

Pokemon carrying Thunderbolt, like Clefable, that can deter Water-types like Seadra and Blastoise from staying in allows Sandslash to set up more easily. Chip damage from Fire Spin users like Moltres, Rapidash, and Charizard, as well as Wrap from Dragonair, is also appreciated to help secure OHKOs after a Swords Dance, which makes Sandslash more difficult to deal with over the course of a game. Lastly, paralysis support from the likes of Electrode and Mr. Mime allows Sandslash to not only have more setup opportunities, but also to fish for full paralysis with Substitute and become even more lethal.</p> "

      "overview": "<p><strong>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. Nidoqueen is generally considered unviable in the current metagame.</strong></p> <p>Nidoqueen has access to some of the best coverage in the game, including moves like STAB Earthquake, Thunderbolt, and Blizzard. This makes it a difficult Pokemon to switch into, often forcing super effective damage onto opposing teams. Furthermore, its Ground typing provides it with ample points of entry through predicted Thunderbolts and Thunder Waves. It can also avoid the OHKO from Dewgong's Blizzard, Kadabra's Psychic, and—most notably—Tentacruel's Surf, all while striking back fiercely in return. This, theoretically, makes Nidoqueen work well as a late-game threat.</p> <p>Nidoqueen's benefits largely end there, though. While it can stomach the strong aforementioned attacks, it's not fast and can't OHKO their users back, so it just gets outsped and KOed one-on-one. This means that Nidoqueen mandates ample paralysis support from teammates like Hypno to be effective, which not every team can afford. Worse still, it has common weaknesses to Surf, Blizzard, and Psychic, all of which often lead to it getting forced out after a KO by the threat of being revenge killed. Nidoqueen also struggles mightily to break Hypno, a common sight on RBY UU teams, which can threaten it with sleep or a 2HKO from Psychic in return. Even though Nidoqueen has the bulk to avoid some KOs Nidoking cannot, like the 2HKO from Kangaskhan's Earthquake, Nidoking is often superior due to it outspeeding and severely damaging Gyarados and Dragonite. Overall, despite not being horrendous, Nidoqueen is rarely used in high-level play.</p> ",

Rock Slide can be used to 2HKO Articuno, which is otherwise only 4HKOed by Thunderbolt and uses Nidoqueen as setup fodder. However, it's ineffective elsewhere, making Nidoqueen more matchup reliant. Counter is a valid choice for checking Normal-types like Persian and Kangaskhan, notably allowing Nidoqueen to switch into a Hyper Beam from the latter and subsequently OHKO it. Fire Blast can be used to fish for burns against Tentacruel switching in, which cripples its Wrap, but it's otherwise difficult to recommend due to the omnipresence of Pokemon that resist Fire-type attacks.</p> "

  "Nidoking": {
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Nidoking is the most diverse threat in RBY NU and boasts several key strengths that differentiate it from other mid-game attackers. Nidoking has the best coverage in the tier and boasts super effective coverage for nearly every foe, as well as STAB Earthquake for powerful neutral damage. Its Electric immunity grants it entry against opposing Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt users, blessing Nidoking with a variety of effective entry points. For example, one's own Mr. Mime or Clefable often baits in and paralyzes their opposing counterpart, after which Nidoking can switch into the predicted Thunder Wave and threaten them heavily. This immunity additionally makes Nidoking a hard counter to Electrode, helping to protect teams from a surprise sweep and exploiting Electrode for free turns. Nidoking can clean up endgames against the tier's various Water-types and Golem due to its superior Speed, 2HKOing Kingler, Kabutops, and Golem before they are able to 2HKO back.</p> <p>Despite these advantages, Nidoking's typing is a double-edged sword and its Speed leaves it vulnerable to Mr. Mime and Venomoth. Nidoking's Poison typing adds weaknesses to Psychic and Earthquake, making nearly all of Nidoking's matchups risky for both sides, as every top Pokemon in NU has at least one super effective attack against it. Nidoking competes with Golem for a teamslot, in particular missing out on Golem's superior typing. Golem's Rock typing grants it useful Normal and Fire resistances as well as STAB on Rock Slide, whereas Nidoking misses the OHKO against Charizard. Also, Nidoking will leave even victorious fights at low HP, and this is where its imperfect Speed becomes noticeable, as Mr. Mime, Venomoth, and all Fire-types can revenge kill it with ease. Venomoth especially punishes an early Nidoking entry, as it is only 3HKOed by Earthquake, allowing it to switch in, gain massive momentum with Sleep Powder, and then threaten Stun Spore on the switch.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Nidoking's other options all end up surprisingly lacking. Substitute initially looks appealing, but Nidoking's lower bulk means that after using Substitute twice, it is in OHKO range of most of the tier, unlike Golem. Body Slam can potentially paralyze, but this is unreliable and it deals poor damage compared to every other option. Thunder's power allows it to rarely secure 2HKOs that Thunderbolt misses, but the odds are extremely low; its best feat is a 42% chance to 2HKO Seadra after considering accuracy. Overall, the loss in consistency often leaves Nidoking in a far worse position than simply using Thunderbolt. Fire Blast seems like it could cover Venomoth, but it only has a 40% chance to 2HKO and otherwise provides very little. Finally, Submission to hit Clefable is useless, as it has only slightly more power than Earthquake with far worse accuracy. Any of these options create exploitable holes in Nidoking's coverage and should not be considered.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Venomoth: Venomoth is perhaps the premier Nidoking check, easily landing sleep in retaliation if Nidoking secures an early-game KO. Venomoth also outspeeds and 3HKOes Nidoking while being one of the few Pokemon to be only 3HKOed back, allowing Venomoth to stop Nidoking even late-game. Nidoking also essentially cannot switch into Venomoth, as Stun Spore leaves it ineffective and Double-Edge often leaves it in range of a Psychic 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Mr. Mime</strong>: Mr. Mime outspeeds and 2HKOes Nidoking, which can't OHKO back. Mr. Mime cannot switch in, but unparalyzed Mr. Mime easily revenge kills Nidoking and is difficult to switch into itself, shifting the momentum from Nidoking's team with a successful entry. Nidoking should not revenge kill early-game due to the threat of Mr. Mime revenge killing it, even when facing Venomoth-less teams.</p> <p><strong>Clefable</strong>: Clefable is slower than Nidoking, but Blizzard 2HKOes and Nidoking can only 3HKO. Also, Body Slam can paralyze Nidoking as it tries to enter, hamstringing it permanently.</p> <p><strong>Seadra and Blastoise</strong>: Both Seadra and Blastoise are 3HKOed by Thunderbolt while 2HKOing in return. Seadra notably Speed ties Nidoking and can set up Agility to ensure it can use another attack after KOing Nidoking. Blastoise can check Nidoking in a pinch, though its utility as a check to other Pokemon means it will rarely want to take this fight. It also cannot switch in and win, as it is slower than Nidoking.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: A number of fast Pokemon can check Nidoking given its propensity for taking heavy damage when trading hits. Charizard and Moltres can switch into Earthquake and outspeed Nidoking, with Moltres even 2HKOing it with Fire Blast. Charizard normally needs mild chip damage or a critical hit in order to win one-on-one, but it can also win with a Fire Spin or two, though this is an uncommon set. Raticate has a 51% chance to 2HKO with Super Fang + Hyper Beam, while Nidoking only has a 23.5% chance to 2HKO with Earthquake, and after a mere 8% chip damage, the 2HKO becomes guaranteed. Ninetales and Fearow can defeat Nidoking after approximately 15-20% chip damage as well.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Earthquake is Nidoking's strongest move, particularly against Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Kabutops, as well as an effective midground option to cover most switches. Thunderbolt covers the Water-types of the tier, 3HKOing Blastoise and Seadra and 2HKOing the others, while also dealing decent damage to Charizard or Moltres. Blizzard 2HKOes Golem and Exeggcute while also covering Flying-type switches, acting as a generally safe midground option. Rock Slide provides a 2HKO against Charizard and Moltres, both of which are too bulky for Blizzard or Thunderbolt to 2HKO; Charizard is KOed by either Blizzard or Thunderbolt followed by Rock Slide, while Moltres generally requires two Rock Slides to 2HKO. While the overlapping coverage may seem like overkill, Nidoking can at worst 3HKO every single Pokemon in NU with this set, and the overlapping coverage usually makes it near-impossible to safely switch into Nidoking.</p> <p>Utilizing Nidoking effectively requires an awareness of how and when to get it into battle, as well as knowing how to utilize midground options to cover switches without giving up KOs. Nidoking can effectively enter battle when opposing Mr. Mime or Clefable is likely to use Thunder Wave or Thunderbolt. As these Pokemon often trade hits with their opposing counterparts, only to be revenge killed after, it is important to set up mismatched situations: for example, getting your own Mr. Mime in on Blastoise to incentivize the opponent to switch their Mr. Mime or Clefable into paralysis. This allows you to switch Nidoking into their retaliatory Thunder Wave. Nidoking can also enter to revenge kill targets such as Water-types, Golem, and Clefable regardless of whether they're paralyzed, especially later in the game when sleep is no longer a concern. Once Nidoking enters battle, the opponent is pressured to either sacrifice their current Pokemon to chip Nidoking or to try to find a relatively safe switch, such as getting Mr. Mime in against a special attack or Charizard in against Earthquake. For example, Nidoking can 2HKO Kabutops with either two Earthquakes or Thunderbolt + Earthquake; the former provides safe entry to Charizard, while Thunderbolt allows Mr. Mime in to force Nidoking out. Knowing Nidoking's KO ranges and the opponent's switch options allows it to heavily punish desperate switches while still securing KOs if the foe stays in.</p> <p>Nidoking partners well with Mr. Mime, as mentioned, and other paralysis spreaders such as Clefable and Venomoth work the same way. Besides baiting opposing Thunder Wave, they also slow foes down for Nidoking. Exeggcute can also create mismatches by checking Mr. Mime, and it may even paralyze an additional foe as Mr. Mime switches out or use Explosion to grant Nidoking a perfect entry point. It also pairs well with Water-types such as the ubiquitous Blastoise, which baits Electric-type moves late-game and helps to chip down bulkier foes, such as Blastoise and Charizard, for Nidoking to later remove; in return, Nidoking helps to insulate Water-types from a potential Electrode sweep and finish KOs for them. Blastoise and Kingler also often find opportunities to catch switches with Body Slam, potentially paralyzing more opponents.</p> "

With its impeccable coverage, Electric immunity, and well-rounded stats, one would even question why it isn't dominating. Once the opposing team is weakened, Nidoking becomes very threatening, as it hits nearly everything for neutral damage and can be very difficult to switch into. Moreover, it can freely pivot into an incoming Toxic, as well as Electric-type attacks like Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt from Electabuzz and Haunter, giving it some decent defensive utility. With adequate paralysis support from Pokemon like Hypno and careful play, Nidoking can feasibly work.</p> <p>However, Nidoking comes with an egregious problem: its typing. Poison and Ground are among the worst possible defensive types in the game, making it weak to the many Water-, Ice-, Ground-, and Psychic-type attacks in the tier, and its Speed only worsens this situation. Therefore, despite its seemingly powerful offensive presence, it can hardly ever switch in because it struggles with so many metagame staples, namely Tentacruel, Hypno, Dragonite, Gyarados, and Articuno. Nidoking also struggles with damage output at many points, causing it to fail to even OHKO Dragonite with Blizzard.

In addition, Nidoking has a solid Speed tier that enables it to outpace everything up to Articuno. Its typing isn't entirely without merit, either, as it walls Jolteon and grants it an important immunity to Thunder Wave, a trait that is unique among viable Focus Energy users.</p> <p>Nidoking has its drawbacks, though. Its horrid defensive typing burdens it with weaknesses to Psychic, Ice, and Ground and leaves it without a resistance to Flying, making it a shakier Zapdos check than Rhydon and Golem. To make matters worse, it's outsped by metagame staples such as Alakazam, Starmie, and Tauros, all of which 2HKO Nidoking. This fragility makes paralysis support a necessity to get the most out of Nidoking. On that note, while Nidoking itself is immune to Thunder Wave, it still hates paralysis and can be crippled by Body Slam or Stun Spore. Additionally, Nidoking is unreliable, as it requires setup and, even after setting up, scoring a critical hit is inconsistent.

          "description": "<p>Focus Energy significantly boosts Nidoking's critical hit rate, making it very difficult to switch into. Earthquake is Nidoking's most powerful attack; it needs just one critical hit to OHKO Alakazam and 2HKO Starmie and Chansey. Nidoking 2HKOes Tauros and Snorlax as well if it scores two critical hits, but it only has a 38.4% chance to do so. Blizzard is necessary in the third moveslot, as it gives Nidoking the best shot at muscling through Rest Exeggutor before it can retaliate. It has other uses besides this; a critical hit is guaranteed to OHKO Rhydon and Golem and will usually let Nidoking 2HKO Zapdos, and it has a small freeze chance, letting it KO Pokemon it normally would not be able to as a last resort. Finally, with a single critical hit, Thunderbolt 2HKOes Slowbro and OHKOes the rare Cloyster after a little chip damage.</p> <p>For Nidoking to fulfill its role effectively, it should be kept away from damage and status whenever possible, and faster Pokemon such as Alakazam and Starmie should be paralyzed before it attempts to set up for a sweep. This is easier said than done due to Team Preview, meaning your opponent will know that you have Nidoking on your team and will try to keep these Pokemon as healthy as is feasible so they can keep it in check. Getting Nidoking on the field is not a simple task either due to its horrific defensive typing allowing it to be hit for super effective damage by most metagame staples, but it still has some decent opportunities to switch in and set up with Focus Energy. The most obvious would be the aforementioned Jolteon, which is unable to do anything meaningful to it. Once again, though, your opponent will be aware of Nidoking and will be able to prepare for it by switching out. Another good chance to switch in is on a predicted Rest from Pokemon like Exeggutor. There is also an element of risk here, as most Rest users can predict the switch and deal major damage with their coverage moves, preventing Nidoking from setting up.</p> <p>Slowbro and Starmie are good partners for Nidoking, as they resist Ice, Psychic, and Water and provide paralysis support for it. Slowbro in particular is adept at drawing in enemy Starmie to paralyze it. In return, Nidoking can protect them from Electric-type moves. Exeggutor is another Pokemon that can spread paralysis, but it differentiates itself from Slowbro and Starmie with a handy resistance to Ground that can make the Rhydon matchup easier.</p> <p>Thanks to its immense movepool, Nidoking has plenty of room for customization. Substitute can be used in order to protect it from status and critical hits, but it can be difficult to set up alongside Focus Energy, and it puts Nidoking in OHKO range of Rhydon, Alakazam, and Exeggutor. Ice Beam is a more accurate alternative to Blizzard, but it requires an additional critical hit to 2HKO Exeggutor and almost never OHKOes Rhydon and Golem even with a critical hit. Thunder has poor accuracy, but it can be used instead of Thunderbolt; the greater power allows a critical hit to OHKO Cloyster and KO Starmie and Slowbro after minimal chip damage. Body Slam can paralyze switch-ins like Starmie. Rock Slide OHKOes the rare Articuno and Moltres with a critical hit, but Nidoking is OHKOed and 2HKOed by their Blizzard and Fire Blast and requires paralysis support to reliably outspeed them. Surf reliably KOes Rhydon and Golem without needing a critical hit if they are not at full health and has perfect accuracy, but it is inferior to Blizzard otherwise.</p> "

Diverse coverage including Thunderbolt, Blizzard, and Hyper Beam makes Clefable difficult to switch into and allows it to break through both high-Special foes like Mr. Mime and physical walls like Golem.

Sing allows Clefable to utilize its bulk to attempt to put a foe to sleep; however, with no reliable recovery, this is a risky way to compress roles and free a slot for another Pokemon and may result in losing Clefable for little to no value. Due to Clefable’s low Speed and Sing’s poor accuracy, it will often get paralyzed and struggle to land sleep moves. Psychic is an interesting option, 3HKOing Venomoth and allowing Clefable to reapply paralysis Speed drops against it and opposing Clefable, but this covers fewer matchups than most other options. Counter allows Clefable to improve its matchup against opposing Clefable, Raticate, and Wigglytuff, but opposing Clefable can use Blizzard for nearly equivalent damage while avoiding retaliation; it can also be used to switch into a Hyper Beam from Charizard or Kingler before returning lethal damage. Fire Blast 2HKOes Venomoth and Pinsir, but this is extremely niche due to Fire Blast's poor accuracy and Pinsir's rarity.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Clefable: The most typical check to Clefable is one's own Clefable, as it is a difficult foe to switch into for most of the tier. Barring multiple full paralysis turns or critical hits, the typical outcome of this scenario is that one Clefable is KOed while the other is left low enough to be revenge killed by most foes.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Although Clefable is bulky, it is quite vulnerable to being whittled down by Fire Spin. Pokemon like Moltres, Charizard, and Ninetales can take on Clefable well, with Moltres nearly 2HKOing Clefable with Fire Blast. However, none of the Fire-types enjoy getting paralyzed themselves and may not wish to risk the matchup.</p> <p><strong>Sleep: Venomoth outspeeds Clefable and can easily enter after a KO, forcing the Clefable player to give up a Pokemon in retaliation. Clefable rarely wants to take sleep moves, and switching is even less ideal, forcing hard decisions.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Wigglytuff can reliably trade with Clefable, leaving one's own Clefable healthy to check other threats. It can also use Counter to return massive damage should Clefable hit it with Body Slam or Hyper Beam. Raticate falls just short of 2HKOing with Super Fang + Hyper Beam, with only a 20% chance to succeed, but still trades well with Clefable or can use Super Fang before allowing a teammate to finish it off.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Hyper Beam Clefable often leaves itself open to one of Kabutops or Golem by dropping either Thunderbolt or Blizzard, allowing these foes to freely set up or attack as it is forced out.</p> ",

      "overview": "<p><strong>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. Clefable is generally considered less viable in the current metagame.</strong></p> <p>Clefable succeeds in RBY UU as a strong early-game offensive threat with great unpredictability and versatility, possessing an incredible movepool with Thunder Wave, STAB Body Slam, Thunderbolt, Blizzard, Counter, Sing, and more. With respectable bulk in tow, Clefable will incapacitate many Pokemon in some form before it goes down; this bulk also helps it take Wrap decently well, letting it stay in and punish misses with Thunder Wave in a tight spot. Furthermore, Clefable has coverage for every Pokemon in the tier, letting it fine-tune itself for a team and punish switch-ins if they get paralyzed prior; still, it won't have the right move for every situation at once.</p> <p>However, because of its low Speed, Clefable often finds itself getting easily worn down by wrappers like Tentacruel and Dragonite. Additionally, it is near-effortless to revenge kill with strong attackers that aren't normally even fast enough to revenge kill, such as Hypno, and critical hits don't help. This is compounded by a lack of recovery and resistances, causing it to sometimes struggle as a defensive team piece. Because Clefable provides inconsistent defensive utility and not quite elite offensive pressure, it is often outcompeted by other early-game wallbreakers like Kangaskhan. Regardless of this, Clefable pairs well alongside many Pokemon in the tier—particularly other Normal-types, Kadabra, and Articuno—for its support movepool, which backs its offensive pressure extremely well.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Clefable has among the most customizable movesets in the game. Generally, Clefable should always use Body Slam and usually Thunder Wave so it can incapacitate any one foe, but the rest of its moveset is fair game to alter.</p> <p>Counter is the most notable choice, as Clefable can easily switch in on Persian's Slash and force it out with the threat of Thunder Wave, thereby allowing Counter to massively damage the switch-in. This situation can similarly be applied to Body Slam uses from Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Dodrio. Additionally, switching in on a predicted Hyper Beam can allow Counter Clefable to deal massive damage. Counter is easily played around once revealed, but it only needs to succeed once for Clefable to do its job.</p> <p>Mega Kick deals more damage than Body Slam and doesn't require a recharge turn like Hyper Beam, allowing Clefable to 2HKO Tentacruel and Hypno, but the accuracy can lead to Clefable taking extra damage that it can't always afford. Sing is a fair surprise option that lets Clefable compress roles on a team, but repeated misses allow foes to wear it down quickly. Rest lets Clefable attempt to stay healthy throughout a game, and the abundance of Wrap can let it burn sleep turns. However, due to a complete lack of resistances, it is difficult to safely wake up against anything but Wrap, often making Clefable less consistent. Furthermore, a sleeping Clefable is ripe for exploitation from the likes of Tentacruel and Dugtrio. Reflect can be used to take minimal chip damage from Dragonite's Wrap, even PP stalling it when combined with Rest. It can also make Clefable more effective against the powerful Kangaskhan and Dodrio. However, it's ineffective against Pokemon that use Slash, such as Persian and Pinsir, and Tentacruel can 3HKO Clefable with Surf, so it can be difficult to fit into sets. Light Screen lets Thunderbolt Clefable muscle past Articuno, cutting off the monumental power of Articuno's Blizzard.</p> <p>Clefable has a surfeit of additional coverage options that can be situationally justified. Fire Blast 3HKOes Articuno and potentially incapacitates Kangaskhan and Dragonite switch-ins with burns. It can also 2HKO the rare Pinsir, which otherwise has an amazing matchup against Clefable. Thunder or Ice Beam can be used over Thunderbolt and Blizzard, but Thunder doesn't improve Clefable's KO ranges by much and Ice Beam's PP increase fails to make up for its damage output. Submission allows Clefable to 3HKO Persian and is its best option against opposing Clefable, but it has little use outside of this; Dewgong and Kangaskhan are damaged more by Thunderbolt and Blizzard, respectively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Partial Trapping: Wrappers like Dragonite, Tentacruel, and Pinsir wear Clefable down, exploiting its vulnerability to sustained offensive pressure, before switching to a Pokemon that can KO it like Kangaskhan. Dragonite is particularly effective, as its Wrap deals up to 5% per turn. If AgiliWrap Dragonite sets up prior to fighting Clefable, Clefable struggles mightily to stop it, as it fails to OHKO with Blizzard and usually has to resort to Thunder Wave. Tentacruel can gradually choke it out with Wrap before KOing it with Surf. However, Clefable's bulk increases the chance of an eventual miss—and taking crippling paralysis in return. On the other hand, Swords Dance or repeated critical hits can drastically quicken the process. While rare, Pinsir has Swords Dance + Bind, which lets it swiftly bring Clefable down and KO it from around 85% with +2 Hyper Beam; it can also use +2 Submission after even less damage. The similarly rare Moltres chips Clefable down quickly with Fire Spin while dealing massive damage with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Faster Sleepers: Clefable is slow and used early-game, so it often risks taking sleep. Common faster Pokemon like Venusaur, Haunter, and Hypnosis Hypno often force it to sacrifice itself or switch out. Clefable can't consistently trade with them either; Venusaur is not likely to be 2HKOed by Blizzard, Haunter is only remotely scared by Psychic, and Hypno has enough bulk and special attacking prowess to make the matchup inconsistent at best.</p> <p><strong>Articuno: Articuno outspeeds and 3HKOes Clefable with its nuclear Blizzard, while Clefable needs Fire Blast or Light Screen to stand a realistic chance in a flat one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Omastar switches into Blizzard Clefable, while Golem handles Thunderbolt variants, and both deal heavy damage with STAB moves. While Aerodactyl is Rock-type and shrugs off Clefable without either move, it loses to Blizzard and Thunderbolt alike, making it a non-issue for most Clefable sets. All Rock-types are excellent Hyper Beam absorbers as well.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Vaporeon and Dewgong outspeed Clefable and threaten it with 3HKOs. However, both take massive damage from Thunderbolt in the process, and they become dicey answers if paralyzed. Notably, Dewgong is 3HKOed by Clefable's Thunderbolt itself, and Hyper Beam Clefable can KO Vaporeon after two Thunderbolt uses first. Poliwrath is faster and can put Clefable to sleep with Hypnosis; it also possesses Submission to 2HKO Clefable.</p> <p><strong>Counter Users: Because Clefable excels when it's using its Normal-type STAB moves, it can take mortal damage from the rare Counter. Pokemon such as Poliwrath, opposing Clefable, Kangaskhan, and Hypno are sometimes seen using the move. A notable way to trap Clefable is by switching one of these Pokemon in on Hyper Beam and using Counter as Clefable recharges.</p> ",

          "name": "Offensive Utility",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set lets Clefable succeed as a strong early-game attacker, providing ample paralysis support while trading with common early-game Psychic-types like Kadabra and Hypno. Because of Clefable's bulk and Thunder Wave, it will typically incapacitate foes in a one-on-one fight. Staying in against repeated Wrap uses before crippling the opposing Pokemon with Thunder Wave is a viable—albeit risky—strategy, as its physical bulk makes it take minimal chip damage. STAB Body Slam deals sizable damage and threatens to paralyze any would-be switch-in. Hyper Beam is very powerful, KOing Pokemon like Tentacruel, Electabuzz, Persian, and even Hypno from around half HP; a critical hit Body Slam prior can often put these Pokemon in range for Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Clefable's special coverage move should be chosen based on what the team is lacking. Thunderbolt covers Water-types, 3HKOing Poliwrath, Dewgong, and Omastar as well as 2HKOing Gyarados. Blizzard 2HKOes Dodrio, Dragonite, Tangela, and Golem; it is also Clefable's best option for Kangaskhan and Venusaur. Psychic is the best against Haunter, 3HKOing it, though Special drops can improve this. Additionally, it can 3HKO Tentacruel with a Special drop, though Thunderbolt is comparably effective against it.</p> <p>Clefable can be a difficult Pokemon to bring in, primarily due to its low Speed causing it to get worn down quickly. It's best brought in through Wrap or double switching on Kadabra or Electabuzz, common sights for their Speed and special offense; Kadabra is a particularly big target, as Clefable 2HKOes it with Body Slam. Because they lack the firepower to break past Clefable and it threatens them with paralysis in return, it's easy for Clefable to gain momentum. These Pokemon can be easily drawn in through early-game use of Tentacruel; for instance, leading with Wrap Tentacruel regularly draws Kadabra in right away and gives Clefable a free switch. Clefable can heavily punish Pokemon by predicting Rest—particularly from Tentacruel and Hypno—as it can easily 3HKO both with Body Slam twice followed by Hyper Beam. In respect to Hypno, Clefable is very capable of switching in via Wrap pivoting and denting it enough to the point that it can be traded with. Kadabra, Tentacruel, and, to a lesser extent, Electabuzz are all extremely common early-game Pokemon that can be regularly lured in through your own Kadabra, Tentacruel, or Hypno; Kadabra and Hypno can force Tentacruel to use Rest through paralysis and super effective damage, while Hypno is forced in through prolonged mirror matches. Dugtrio is also a good opportunity for Clefable to come in, as it fails to 3HKO without critical hits and gets threatened with Body Slam paralysis or severe damage from Blizzard. Dugtrio regularly switches in on predicted Thunder Wave uses, so consider double switching to Clefable from a damaged Kadabra, Electabuzz, Dragonite, or Hypno.</p> <p>Clefable can be used as a lead, as it forces Tentacruel to pivot with Wrap by the threat of Thunder Wave, threatens non-Hypnosis Hypno, and shrugs off Kadabra's Thunder Wave. In the event the opponent is using a slower team, such as one featuring Tangela or multiple bulky Water-types like Omastar, lead Kadabra may even switch out. However, Clefable can often be more threatening outside of the lead slot because of its ability to pummel paralyzed Pokemon, and Pokemon like Tentacruel, Electabuzz, and Kadabra often perform more favorably as leads. Because of Clefable's low Speed, paralysis inducers such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, and the omnipresent Hypno are excellent partners for making it a late-game threat. They also become much more threatening once Clefable has beaten or traded with an opposing Psychic-type. Clefable also strongly benefits special attackers like Articuno, as it normally dents specially bulky Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Kadabra; Articuno can finish them off while taking out physically bulky Pokemon like Kangaskhan. Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Dragonite appreciate Clefable's paralysis support, which makes up for their lower Speed, while being able to wallbreak alongside it. Thunderbolt Clefable is also helpful for Dragonite in particular, as it hits the Water-types that frequently run Blizzard.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Although Ninetales is an uncommon lead in RBY NU, it crucially outspeeds Mr. Mime and keeps Venomoth out of the battle. Along with its straightforward assets in Speed and STAB Fire Blast, it has Confuse Ray to harass most other leads and Fire Spin to pivot or chip away at slower Pokemon in a pinch. Its special bulk allows it to go toe-to-toe with Mr. Mime, Clefable, and the rare Electrode, and the threat of Body Slam paralysis makes it difficult for these foes to switch out. Ninetales lacks Charizard's dreaded weaknesses to Thunderbolt and Blizzard, allowing it to better face special attackers and ensuring its lead advantage against Mr. Mime. Using Blastoise to check Ninetales will quickly leave it too worn down to check other threats, and it may even be subject to Fire Spin if burned.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Ninetales is held back by a variety of weaknesses. Though pure Fire is a type with advantages, it leaves Ninetales weak to Charizard's Earthquake. Ninetales lacks a consistent way to stop Charizard and Kabutops from setting up, being forced to switch or fish for paralysis and confusion against deadly foes that can easily KO it or set up with Swords Dance. As Charizard is a common lead, leading Ninetales can immediately put a team on the back foot. Kabutops, Blastoise, and Seadra are capable of switching into Ninetales, albeit at risk of burn or paralysis, and Ninetales's poor coverage leaves it helpless once they do. Confuse Ray and Fire Spin are unreliable at best; they may fully prevent a foe from acting or do absolutely nothing, and they become borderline useless when Ninetales is paralyzed. Ninetales's reliance on luck is baked into all its options, but even moderate luck allows it to frustrate opponents and spread enough damage to enable its teammates.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ninetales's other options are limited in utility. Hyper Beam can provide the extra bit of damage needed to finish off Charizard and Blastoise but does little in most matchups. Toxic can replace Body Slam for use in conjunction with Fire Spin, but this is worsened by Ninetales's inability to consistently trap Charizard and may end up simply blocking more impactful status conditions. Rest looks appealing at first, potentially using parafusion as a chance to heal, but it provides free setup turns for Swords Dance users and free entry for threats like Golem and Nidoking. Substitute may also look interesting to take advantage of Confuse Ray, but Ninetales simply cannot afford the moveslot, and Substitute fails to block Thunder Wave anyway.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Charizard: Charizard Speed ties and 2HKOes Ninetales with Earthquake 15% of the time even before accounting for its high critical hit rate. While Charizard fears paralysis, Ninetales's Body Slam is an unreliable way to inflict it and risks losing the game to a Swords Dance set.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Kabutops is practically immune to Ninetales's attacks—Fire Blast is an 8HKO—and burns do almost nothing to hinder it, forcing Ninetales to switch out or gamble on Fire Spin and Confuse Ray. Golem fears receiving a burn, but it is only 4HKOed by Fire Blast and can nearly OHKO in return if not burned.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Aside from Kingler, which risks a 3HKO from Fire Blast, all Water-types serve as effective Ninetales checks. Blastoise is only 5HKOed by Fire Blast and can 2HKO in return with Surf or make a safe prediction with Body Slam or Seismic Toss due to its bulk. Seadra, similarly, is almost never 4HKOed by Fire Blast, 2HKOing with Surf in return.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: A paralyzed Ninetales finds itself outsped and heavily damaged by most foes and unable to use Confuse Ray and Fire Spin effectively. Fire Blast becomes even less accurate, leaving Ninetales with little to do but hope to land one or two more hits before being KOed.</p> ",

Ninetales seeks to chip down and inflict status onto multiple foes if possible, creating opportunities for teammates such as Charizard, Mr. Mime, and Swords Dance users to sweep later. Good teammates for Ninetales include Water-type Swords Dance users such as Kingler and Kabutops to help check the ubiquitous Blastoise. Ninetales also benefits from status spreaders disabling checks and enabling parafusion. Venomoth can put Water-types to sleep and fish for paralysis as the opponent switches, while Mr. Mime and Clefable can spread paralysis with Thunder Wave. If Ninetales survives the early game, it can return later to take advantage of paralyzed foes or even sweep with Fire Blast.

Defensively, Parasect has resistances to Ground, Water, and Electric, meaning it can situationally switch in on Pokemon like Machamp, Seaking, and Staryu. Parasect is also generally unfazed by paralysis, making it a decent early-game status absorber. With these strengths, combined with RBY's brutal sleep mechanics, one would be forgiven for thinking Parasect can work in RBY PU.</p> <p>However, Parasect is entirely outclassed by other sleepers such as Gastly, which has some Speed to back up its Hypnosis, or Drowzee, which has a better typing. This combined with many teams choosing not to use a sleeper at all makes Parasect not worth using. In addition, Parasect's stats are all-around mediocre; its Speed is tied for the lowest among all fully evolved Pokemon. Its terrible typing also makes it very easy to OHKO. This especially applies in RBY PU, a tier filled with powerful Fire-types, such as Rapidash and Arcanine, to prey on its 4x Fire weakness, and other Pokemon like Fearow and Nidoqueen feast on its poor defensive typing as well. Unfortunately, Parasect's positive traits aren't nearly enough to give it a niche in the tier; it should not see use on any serious competitive team.</p> ",

Hyper Beam is surprisingly powerful at +2, OHKOing Drowzee and Staryu; it can also KO Dragonair, Fearow, and Porygon if they have taken even slight chip damage.

STAB Mega Drain lets Parasect 2HKO Omanyte and Graveler while regaining some HP, but its utility outside of this is questionable. Toxic can be used over Stun Spore to incapacitate partial trapping users such as Dragonair and Rapidash, but whether Parasect gets the opportunity to do this without being KOed or forced out the next turn is another matter.</p> "

It can quickly remove one foe from play with Sleep Powder, which also forces the opponent to switch into Stun Spore, generating a massive early advantage. Venomoth single-handedly prevents early-game usage of slower Pokemon, as critical threats like Blastoise and Clefable cannot afford to be put to sleep. Venomoth can function as a lead, but it more often serves to punish opponents for over-utilizing slower Pokemon before Sleep Clause takes effect. Its Speed tier also allows it to trade hits with Nidoking or Mr. Mime after it lands its status moves, and while its Psychic is not particularly strong, it can still dent foes heavily with a critical hit or Special drop.</p> <p>Venomoth's biggest weakness is its sheer lack of offense—it has no STAB options and relies heavily on Special drops to deal passable damage, so it struggles to break through paralyzed foes—which it cannot put to sleep—and especially flounders against Fire-types. Double-Edge helps to cover Mr. Mime, but it deals just a bit less damage than needed to truly give Venomoth a chance one-on-one.Venomoth's mediocre typing and bulk limit it defensively, as the tier's various Fire-types, Mr. Mime, and Fearow all outspeed or Speed tie it and force it out; Golem's Rock Slide is also a major threat. However, the sheer power of sleep and paralysis ensure a strong niche for Venomoth.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hyper Beam can be used to finish off Mr. Mime at the cost of either Psychic’s coverage or the ability to combat a healthy Mr. Mime. In particular, Mr. Mime always falls to Hyper Beam after two Seismic Tosses, whereas Double-Edge has a mere 23% chance to KO here. Thus, Hyper Beam is an option for insurance on teams leading Mr. Mime. Hyper Beam also deals more damage than Psychic to most foes, allowing Venomoth to sometimes secure a surprise KO on Clefable, Blastoise, or even Charizard after wearing them down.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Venomoth is outsped and 2HKOed by Charizard and Ninetales, both of which also have a high chance to critically hit it. Moltres only Speed ties Venomoth, but its nuclear Fire Blast OHKOes Venomoth, which deals piddling amounts of damage back. All Fire-types are also effective sleep blockers when paralyzed, forcing Venomoth to slowly wear them down before it can land sleep.</p> <p><strong>Mr. Mime: While Mr. Mime fears sleep, it 2HKOes Venomoth and has a high critical hit chance, giving it multiple paths to victory. Paralyzed Mr. Mime blocks sleep moderately effectively, as Double-Edge is only a 4HKO.</p> <p><strong>Fearow</strong>: Fearow is a rare sight, but it outspeeds and 2HKOes Venomoth, just like the Fire-types. It is significantly easier to wear down with Psychic, but it can potentially set up Agility in front of Venomoth and deal heavy damage as it switches out.</p> <p><strong>Exeggcute</strong>: Once Sleep Clause is in effect, Exeggcute easily stops Venomoth. It takes very little damage from Venomoth's attacks and does not mind paralysis, retaliating with Psychic for a 30% likely 2HKO. Exeggcute can easily fish for sleep or paralysis against Venomoth or switch-ins as well.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: Golem's Rock Slide deals upward of 70% to Venomoth, and Body Slam followed by Rock Slide has a high chance to KO, making it risky for Venomoth to switch in. Mega Drain Venomoth can deal heavy damage to Golem, but it still loses one-on-one unless Golem has been chipped. Golem can also use Explosion to even up a losing matchup.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Venomoth's main use is to land sleep, then fish for paralysis as the opponent inevitably switches out, since keeping a slower Pokemon in to try to wake up achieves nothing. Stun Spore helps to keep out dangerous threats like Charizard, Moltres, and Fearow, usually forcing the foe to switch in Clefable or Mr. Mime after Sleep Powder lands, accepting paralysis. Psychic is Venomoth's best attack against most foes, scoring a 3HKO on Nidoking and opposing Venomoth, and it threatens repeated Special drops against Water-types and other switch-ins. Double-Edge is primarily for Mr. Mime, either to fight it directly after landing paralysis, or to punish an already-paralyzed Mr. Mime switching in to block sleep. Double-Edge deals about as much damage as Psychic against most switch-ins, though, so it can also be used as a midground option. As an alternative to Double-Edge, Mega Drain nearly 2HKOes both Golem and Kabutops, only needing slight chip damage to guarantee it. However, it is useless versus everything else.</p> <p>Venomoth can act as a lead, matching up well versus any slower lead and having decent odds to put Mr. Mime to sleep, but is forced out by Charizard or Ninetales due to the risk of a critical hit or Sleep Powder miss. In most games, it will instead switch in after a few turns to take advantage of a slower foe like Blastoise. Once in, it lands sleep and follows up with Stun Spore until something is paralyzed; if there is a preexisting paralyzed foe, Venomoth may opt to simply attack in case said foe switches in, returning later to land sleep. After landing sleep and paralysis, Venomoth can either stay in and trade hits until it drops or switch out after paralyzing the foe. Trading hits is advisable if the opponent uses Clefable to absorb Stun Spore, as Venomoth can often weaken it severely with Psychic before going down. Venomoth can also be saved to fight Rock-types with Mega Drain, to sacrifice to sleep later, or to prevent the opponent from ever sacrificing their slept Pokemon—this would let Venomoth land a second sleep. Venomoth pairs well with allies that bait in Water-types, as these are its easiest entry point; for example, leading Charizard or Ninetales often forces Blastoise in, as does using Golem early. Slower allies such as Kingler and Golem particularly appreciate Venomoth's paralysis support, as does Nidoking. Mega Drain Venomoth also works well with allies that normally falter in front of Rock-types, such as Moltres and Ninetales.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Agility + Partial Trapping and Sleep-inducing moves, as well as Lapras becoming legal. The most up to date moveset for Dugtrio is the following.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Generally, Dugtrio doesn't need any moves outside of its main set. Body Slam can be nice to paralyze checks such as the relatively uncommon Aerodactyl, but the only Pokemon you will commonly see that Dugtrio doesn't naturally outspeed is opposing Dugtrio. Even worse, Body Slam is only useful against opposing Dugtrio on the switch, as either Dugtrio can 2HKO the other with Earthquake one-on-one. Another severe downside of using Body Slam is its damage output in comparison to Slash: whereas Slash can do 30% to Gyarados, Body Slam does half that. Where Slash lets Dugtrio 4HKO Tangela and potentially catch it at half health while it switches in, Body Slam can't even reliably 6HKO Tangela. Sand Attack could be used to pray for misses in desperate scenarios, like when Dodrio is about to set up and run over your team or Dugtrio is your last Pokemon left and needs to land multiple critical hits. It can also stop Dragonite from setting up Agility and sweeping through your team with Wrap, but it's less reliable than Toxic and has its effect nullified by switching. It can technically be used to severely reduce Tentacruel's Wrap accuracy, though the only time Dugtrio should be facing Tentacruel is if it is in Earthquake KO range anyway.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Paralysis: Dugtrio relies heavily on its Speed to stop foes from capitalizing on its weak defenses, which makes paralysis so deadly for it. Dugtrio is immune to Thunder Wave, but Stun Spore—used commonly by Tangela and the rare Venomoth—and Body Slam—from attackers like Kangaskhan, Gyarados, and opposing Dugtrio—can cripple Dugtrio for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attacks: In general, Dugtrio is unable to take more than one attack without fainting, so any strong attack—such as Kangaskhan's Body Slam and Hypno or Kadabra's Psychic—hitting it should enable any other Pokemon to pick it off. Even worse, many common special attacks, such as Articuno's Blizzard and Surf from Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar, are super effective and will OHKO Dugtrio.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Flying-types are most teams' main defensive answers to Dugtrio, as they can switch into its Earthquake and threaten it out with heavy damage, if not an outright OHKO. Dragonite is best at dealing with Dugtrio, as the threat Dragonite poses with Agility and Wrap is so significant that Dugtrio often has to stay in and use Toxic, which can come at the cost of Dugtrio taking a Blizzard and being put at 20% health or lower. Gyarados is similar in its ability to answer Dugtrio, and while it lacks the threat of Agility + Wrap to keep Dugtrio from switching out, it is much harder for Dugtrio's teammates to force out due to its superior defensive typing. Aerodactyl can switch in on Dugtrio's Earthquake with impunity and 2HKO it, but it struggles to switch in on Rock Slide. Dodrio and Articuno are the last two common Flying-types that teams use to check Dugtrio. While they are significantly frailer than Dragonite and Gyarados, respectively 3HKOed and 2HKOed by Rock Slide, they can both OHKO Dugtrio with their STAB attacks and threaten to run through its team after an Agility boost.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Poliwrath, and the rare Dewgong can take Earthquake multiple times while KOing Dugtrio with their STAB Surf and using Rest to remain healthy and answer Dugtrio over the course of a match. However, Dugtrio's critical hit rate can allow it to bypass these answers if they are below 75% health, and Dewgong can't repeatedly switch into Rock Slide without being forced to use Rest.</p> <p><strong>Tangela and Venusaur: Tangela is one of the best Dugtrio answers in RBY UU, taking almost no damage from Earthquake and threatening Dugtrio in return with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore. Tangela can also heal off any chip damage it sustains on the way in with Mega Drain, and it can potentially use Dugtrio as an opportunity to begin accumulating boosts with Growth. Venusaur is similar in this regard, coming in on Earthquake and threatening to put Dugtrio or a teammate to sleep with Sleep Powder or OHKO Dugtrio with Razor Leaf. However, Venusaur is worse at checking Dugtrio than Tangela due to its worse bulk and Ground neutrality.</p> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: If Kangaskhan is healthy, it can switch into Dugtrio's Earthquake and threaten to cripple or KO Dugtrio with its STAB Body Slam or Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Persian and Hypno</strong>: While they can't switch in, Hypno and Persian can win the one-on-one matchup with Dugtrio from full health if it doesn't land a critical hit.</p> ",

Dugtrio's fantastic speed tier, perfect coverage, and Thunder Wave immunity give it the perfect combination of traits to fulfill these roles extremely effectively. Regardless of its health, Dugtrio can very easily close games with its powerful STAB Earthquake, especially considering it boasts an enormous 23.44% critical hit rate. As such, keeping Pokemon out of range of Dugtrio is a key aspect of mastering RBY UU; even tier king Tentacruel must be cautious, as it can drop to an Earthquake as early as 79.3%. This offensive prowess forces the majority of competitive teams to include several checks to it.</p> <p>While Dugtrio is incredibly strong, it is not without its flaws. While its typing provides it with good utility, it also opens it up to numerous weaknesses to common attacks such as Surf, Blizzard, and Razor Leaf. This, combined with its extreme frailty, causes it to crumble when confronted with any sort of offensive pressure. In addition to this, several Pokemon are either immune or resistant to its Earthquake, most notably Dragonite, Gyarados, Aerodactyl, and Tangela. This culminates into Dugtrio having a much more polarized matchup spread than other notable revenge killers, such as Persian or Kadabra. Regardless, Dugtrio remains one of the common and potent threats in the tier for which every team must prepare.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>STAB Earthquake is excellent given Tentacruel's prominence, both 2HKOing it and supporting your own Tentacruel by 2HKOing all of its counters save Persian. Many of these targets can be put in KO range with a small amount of chip damage or a critical hit. Dugtrio also outspeeds all threats to Tentacruel besides opposing Dugtrio, which lets it worry less about its frailty. Earthquake's high power combined with Dugtrio's high critical hit chance makes Dugtrio an effective wallbreaker and general attacker. Through Rock Slide, Dugtrio can hit all Flying-types for super effective damage, further limiting how often the opponent can let Dugtrio come on the field before they start losing Pokemon. The next move is commonly Slash, which stops Tangela from completely walling Dugtrio and can act as a safe midground option to avoid reading whether opponents will switch to a Flying-type or not. Substitute is another option for Dugtrio's third move to make it an even more effective late-game sweeper. Dugtrio can set up a Substitute while the opponent switches to sacrifice a team member at low health, and it can then close out the game against a weakened team that can't break the Substitute and force Dugtrio out. The last moveslot is dedicated to Toxic, as it prevents Dragonite from freely coming in on Earthquake and setting up Agility safely.</p> <p>Dugtrio acts as a late-game sweeper and a potent offensive threat. Using Dugtrio optimally is a delicate balancing act of making the most of its limited opportunities to come onto the field while also keeping it as healthy as possible, a balance that often separates novice players from veterans. Partial-trapping moves—most commonly Wrap—are one of the primary ways Dugtrio can be brought onto the field safely, since they both provide the chip damage needed to bring targets into OHKO range and allow Dugtrio to switch in while the opposing Pokemon is unable to attack. Therefore, Wrap users such as Dragonite and especially Tentacruel make for excellent Dugtrio partners. Tentacruel is the best Dugtrio partner in the game; not only does it provide Wrap support and benefit from Dugtrio KOing primary answers to it after minor chip damage, such as opposing Tentacruel, Kadabra, Electabuzz, and Raichu, but it takes very little damage from Blizzard and Surf aimed at Dugtrio. The opponent's Tentacruel using Wrap is another common way Dugtrio can get onto the battlefield safely, as Dugtrio takes relatively little chip damage from Wrap while outspeeding and KOing the opposing Tentacruel if it is sufficiently weakened. A teammate using Explosion or fainting is another common entrance point for Dugtrio, as its high Speed and damage output allow it to act as an effective revenge killer. Other good opportunities for Dugtrio to enter the battlefield include sleeping Pokemon, a predicted switch, a recovery move that doesn't let the foe escape Dugtrio's KO range, and Electric-type moves such as Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt. Frequently, Dugtrio will be able to clean up teams that have been weakened to the point where it can OHKO every remaining Pokemon; this is a relatively common win condition in RBY UU that should always be kept in mind over the course of the game. Learning to capitalize on opportunities to set up this endgame while simultaneously hindering an opponent carrying Dugtrio from doing the same is an important skill for UU players to learn.</p> "

Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to the current RBY UU metagame.</p> <hr /> <h1>Overview</h1> <p>Persian's Speed and access to STAB Slash help make it a premier revenge killer and late-game sweeper in RBY UU. Outrunning every relevant Pokemon except Dugtrio, Persian can almost always make use of its high damage output from Slash. In addition, this high Speed makes Persian effective against Wrap users, most notably Tentacruel, allowing it to switch in and threaten to damage them with Slash or cripple them with Toxic. Persian will usually KO at least one Pokemon during a game thanks to the sheer power of Slash. Persian's bulk is also appealing, surpassing that of other fast threats like Kadabra and Dugtrio, allowing it to function much more effectively late-game. This bulk also makes it more viable to switch in on moves like Body Slam, which can't paralyze it thanks to Persian being Normal-type. All things considered, Persian is a UU staple.</p> <p>However, Persian's attacking stats are a bit middling, making Slash its main form of damage. To make matters worse, Persian is particularly lacking in physical coverage, with only Hyper Beam available as a second viable option. As a result, Persian relies on its middling special movepool to cover for Pokemon that resist Normal-type moves, making it relatively easy for Pokemon like Haunter to come in and threaten it. Persian is also crippled by paralysis in a big way, as it relies heavily on its Speed to sweep and threaten Wrap users, so it can be forced out by paralysis inducers if it can't KO them first.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Persian can utilize Body Slam over Toxic to assist teams poor at distributing paralysis. However, its damage is a far cry from Slash or Hyper Beam, relying heavily on Persian's innately high critical hit rate. However, Thunderbolt can be removed instead at the price of coverage should a team not require either of them. Screech can be used alongside Hyper Beam to KO sooner than Slash + Hyper Beam, though the foe can switch out to try and force a recharge, thus leaving Persian at risk of being paralyzed or even KOed. As a result, this option is very risky. Bubble Beam lets Persian fight Golem, and the Speed drop can allow it to knock out Dugtrio, but it doesn't help in many other matchups.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Haunter: Haunter is the only viable RBY UU Pokemon that's immune to Slash, which makes it an excellent counter to Persian, preventing it from making any progress until Haunter is KOed. As such, it's best to keep Persian hidden until Haunter has been removed. Persian's Thunderbolt is only a possible 6HKO, while Haunter can 4HKO using its own Thunderbolt or threaten sleep from Hypnosis. So long as Haunter is active, focus on KOing it or baiting it into exploding.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis Inducers</strong>: Electabuzz, Kadabra, and Raichu all threaten to end Persian's run using Thunder Wave, which makes it noticeably less threatening overall. However, should they be in KO range, Persian is capable of shutting them down before they get the chance to do so. As a result, these are only checks if they are at full HP. Hypno is also notable for being among the only paralysis inducers not 2HKOed by Slash, though Hyper Beam can KO it from half health, and Persian is excellent at exploiting it as it uses Rest. Tangela can utilize Mega Drain to save itself from a Slash 3HKO and paralyze Persian with Stun Spore. Dragonite is also notable for its bulk, easily taking a Slash and paralyzing Persian in return. While Persian can use Toxic to outdamage Wrap from Dragonite, it's still problematic for the cat due to its significant damage aside from Wrap.</p> <p><strong>Kangaskhan: Kangaskhan 2HKOes Persian with Body Slam + Hyper Beam. If Kangaskhan is already in a tight spot, such as in 2HKO range from Slash, it can still use Hyper Beam to deal at least 65% damage to Persian, putting it in range for Dugtrio to revenge kill it. In addition, Kangaskhan has access to Counter, which allows it to situationally hit Persian or a switch-in for massive damage. This makes it a fair absorber of Hyper Beam as well; the subsequent Counter outright OHKOes Persian if it hits a high damage roll.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Articuno can use Agility to outspeed Persian and 2HKO it with its nuclear Blizzard. This makes it a fine check. In addition, it's only 3HKOed by Persian's Slash 57.2% of the time, allowing the opponent to take risks if needed. However, a critical hit from Thunderbolt puts Articuno in range of Hyper Beam. Furthermore, consecutive critical hits from Thunderbolt can 2HKO it should Hyper Beam not be used.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Omastar resists Persian's Slash and can 2HKO it in return with Hydro Pump. Persian can try using Thunderbolt, but it's only a 4HKO, so a critical hit is needed to outdamage Rest's healing. Alternatively, Poliwrath makes a decent check, coming in on Slash to use STAB Submission and put Persian in KO range of a subsequent attack. However, Persian's Slash is still a very favorable 3HKO, so Poliwrath isn’t necessarily consistent.</p> <p><strong>Golem: If Persian lacks Bubble Beam, Golem stonewalls it while possessing a very favorable 2HKO with Earthquake. Furthermore, Golem is an excellent counter to Hyper Beam sets, being able to comfortably absorb the hit and deal significant damage in return. Plus, it doesn't fear Bubble Beam from full health unless Persian lands a critical hit. However, Golem can't necessarily switch in on Persian if its moveset hasn't been revealed, as it risks losing half its health from Bubble Beam.</p> ",

Thunderbolt allows Persian to hit bulky Water-types—especially Gyarados—for better damage with a paralysis chance as a bonus. Toxic most notably allows Persian to poison Dragonite using Agility, making a Dragonite Wrap sweep near impossible; however, Dragonite's offensive presence outside of this remains significant. Alternatively, Hyper Beam can be used over Toxic for a slight boost in power, which can be crucial when taking down Pokemon like Electabuzz and Kadabra, which threaten it with paralysis. The KO ranges for Hyper Beam aren't much larger than Slash, though, so it should only be used if you want Persian to be a sweeper.</p> <p>Persian's playstyle is fairly straightforward; it is a cleaner that revenge kills when possible.

Persian's other likely point of entry is your own Tentacruel's Wrap, which gives Persian an excellent shot at KOing foes outright with little to no opposition.

Persian's great Speed also allows it to outrun Tauros and tie with Starmie, which makes it an effective revenge killer. When paired with the tier-king Tauros, Persian can form a powerful sweeping core that can be very difficult to stop late-game.</p> <p>However, Persian should never be considered a replacement for the rampaging bull, and this is partly why it's never seen true OU prominence. Persian is very reliant on its Speed and, ergo, very weak to paralysis—moreso than Tauros—exposing its meager bulk and making revenge killing very difficult. Due to this weakness, Persian is often forced out by Thunder Wave users like Alakazam. As a result, Persian regularly mandates multiple Pokemon to fall back on while offering little to no defensive utility in return. Additionally, Persian is reliant on Slash to a fault, dealing middling damage using anything else. Because of these factors, Persian is by no means a standard in RBY OU, but it is nonetheless a viable pick for more offensive teams.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Persian's fourth moveslot is fairly expendable, but its movepool is far from impressive. Body Slam allows Persian to scout while spreading paralysis for its teammates, though the damage isn't impressive. However, it's more consistent than Hyper Beam while dealing significantly more damage than Slash if it lands a critical hit, making Persian more effective at getting past Reflect Snorlax. Alternatively, Screech can be used alongside Hyper Beam to OHKO Pokemon like Starmie, creating mind games to encourage switches. It also gives Persian a very helpful way of checking for Counter from Chansey and Snorlax, potentially getting it off for free. Thunder 2HKOes Cloyster and deals more damage to Starmie, but its consistency leaves much to be desired.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Gengar: Persian can't fight Gengar at all, possessing only its special coverage to have even a hope in doing so. Even Thunder only has a vague chance to 5HKO it, so Persian is often forced out while giving Gengar free rein to use an uncontested Hypnosis or force damage onto your team. Ideally, Gengar should be accounted for and dispatched before even revealing Persian.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Persian can't handle paralysis, which makes its bulk much more apparent and easier to exploit. Worse still, being paralyzed completely diminishes Persian's potential to revenge kill, making it little more than food for opposing Snorlax and Tauros. Many Pokemon, like Exeggutor and Lapras, possess strong attacks that can even 2HKO it with little consequence when it's paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Starmie: Starmie is capable of stomaching Slash + Hyper Beam while Speed tying Persian, which, on top of its access to Thunder Wave, makes it very capable of downing the cat. Persian is capable of winning against a paralyzed Starmie, but it will often rely on full paralysis to win from full HP.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax is capable of 2HKOing Persian with Body Slam if it's taken any prior damage, and Snorlax possesses the bulk necessary to stomach three hits of Slash. However, if Snorlax isn't healthy or is using Rest, Persian can use Snorlax as an opportunity to switch in and threaten to deal serious damage. If Reflect Snorlax attempts to stall Persian with continued uses of Rest, Persian does have a 6.5% chance to 3HKO with Slash, which can be realized in continued interactions.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: With its fantastic bulk, Exeggutor can win against Persian one-on-one, threatening with Sleep Powder, Stun Spore, or a 2HKO from Psychic. However, it will take massive damage in the process, often being forced to use Explosion much sooner than usual.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: While 2HKOed by Bubble Beam, Rhydon is capable of threatening Persian, as it can 2HKO Persian with Earthquake while resisting Slash. Due to it effectively forcing Persian to use Bubble Beam, it can pivot to a specially bulky Pokemon like Alakazam to switch in with relative impunity unless a Speed drop occurs. Ergo, defeating Rhydon with Bubble Beam can actually be quite difficult, so Bubble Beam should be seen as a way to encourage it to switch out and force Slash damage onto the opposing team.</p> ",

Thunderbolt gives Persian a fighting chance against Slowbro and Cloyster, 3HKOing them.

However, Persian should never be revealed until Gengar is accounted for, so as to not give it an opportunity to switch in and fire off an uncontested Hypnosis. Remember that Persian is faster than Tauros, which gives it the potential to duel the king of RBY OU. In a similar vein, Persian is also an excellent late-game cleaner when the opposing team has been paralyzed and most Pokemon will ideally be in Slash range.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Persian profits immensely from the Substitute mechanics in Stadium OU, which give it a degree of safety against the threat of Thunder Wave. With the strongest Slash in the game in addition to special coverage in Bubble Beam and Thunderbolt, Persian is well-equipped for dealing with Pokemon like weakened Tauros, Cloyster, Rhydon, and Reflect Chansey. Persian is also extremely fast, outrunning Tauros and boasting a 19% critical hit rate, giving it strong revenge killing utility and notable volatility. Because of this, when paired with Tauros, Persian forms a strong Normal-type attacking core that can be difficult for teams to stop.</p> <p>However, Persian should never be used over Tauros—only alongside it—and for good reason: its power is simply inferior. While Slash itself is very strong, Persian itself isn't, making it still struggle against bulkier Pokemon like Snorlax. Persian's special coverage deals middling damage to most targets, meaning it is very reliant on Slash; Tauros possesses Earthquake and Blizzard, allowing it to muscle past Gengar and Exeggutor, respectively. In fact, seeing Gengar in Team Preview often makes Persian dead weight for a majority of the game, forcing its teammates to remove it before it can make any progress. Like many fast Pokemon in the tier, Persian is ruined by paralysis as well, leading to it being forced out if it can't KO Thunder Wave users before they paralyze it. Paralysis also exposes its awful fragilty: critical hits from tier staples like Tauros, Alakazam, and Rhydon can outright OHKO it. Persian also competes with Kangaskhan as a \"second Tauros\", the latter possessing 101 HP Substitutes and superior bulk to better contest Chansey and Snorlax, as well as Earthquake to fight Gengar. However, Persian's Speed and Slash access give it much better qualities as a revenge killer, providing it with a strong niche in the metagame.</p> ",

Bubble Beam allows Persian to 2HKO Rhydon, which otherwise counters it. Common switch-ins to Bubble Beam—such as Alakazam and Starmie—can also have their Speed dropped switching in, which can potentially let Persian threaten them head-on. Thunderbolt lets Persian attempt to 3HKO Cloyster and Slowbro, the latter of which is also particularly vulnerable to critical hits if it tries to set up Amnesia. However, it should be noted that Thunderbolt deals less damage to Starmie than Slash without a critical hit. Finally, Substitute can be used against resting Pokemon like Exeggutor and Slowbro for free, guarding against status and poising Persian to get serious damage in. It can similarly be used against paralyzed Alakazam, Chansey, or Starmie to fish for full paralysis—especially on predicted Recover uses—foes which Persian can muscle past from there.</p> <p>Persian performs best as an expendable mid-game revenge killer, but thanks to Substitute, it can also be a successful late-game cleaner. Once a Pokemon is forced to use Recover, use Rest, or otherwise end up in KO range, Persian can usually come in and profit immensely so long as its checks have been removed. Late-game Persian also has a minor advantage against Substitute Tauros, which put themselves into Slash 2HKO range when using it, so there is value in holding it back to the point where a Tauros mirror would otherwise be appropriate. In terms of other moveset options, Body Slam can be used to let Persian scout while spreading paralysis, though giving up either Bubble Beam or Thunderbolt is often necessary, making Persian more easily checked. Thunder can be used instead of Thunderbolt for a guaranteed 2HKO on Cloyster, as well as dealing more damage to Starmie than Slash, but its consistency gives Persian its own trouble. While Hyper Beam can be used to squeeze 2HKOs on Chansey and Starmie alongside Slash, the forced recharge makes it a far cry from regular RBY and thus generally not recommended.</p> "

Amnesia also assists Golduck defensively, making it very difficult for conventional Water-types to KO and allowing it to PP stall them using Rest.

The main problem is that its good coverage falls flat in RBY UU due to the many bulky Water-types such as Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Dewgong, all of which stonewall Golduck. Furthermore, Tentacruel makes actually getting mileage out of Golduck a nightmare, outspeeding it to delay its setup and chip it down with Wrap until it's placed in KO range. Golduck is fairly vulnerable to physical attackers like Kangaskhan that love to punish its Rest, blowing past it with their STAB moves.

Body Slam's paralysis chance is often not enough to justify using a Pokemon that deals little damage to common bulky threats like Nidoqueen and Machamp. Its Speed, while fast, fails against the omnipresent Rapidash and Fearow.

Low Kick can flinch past some bulky threats when combined with paralysis support, but this strategy is very inconsistent and Low Kick has little use otherwise.

However, Rapidash must watch out for a Body Slam paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Bulky threats</strong>: Machamp is only 4HKOed by Submission and takes less than 40% from Hyper Beam, and it can 3HKO Primeape with its Submission or Earthquake.

Perhaps most importantly, its great Speed stat allows it to outspeed notable fast Pokemon such as Moltres and Mr. Mime. The attached 18.55% critical hit rate further boosts its offensive potency.

Body Slam grants Primeape some measure of self-sufficiency by spreading paralysis to support it. It also acts as a way to discourage switch-ins, as Pokemon like Charizard and Nidoking hate paralysis; Charizard is also liable to be KOed by Rock Slide thereafter. Rock Slide also lets Primeape punish the plethora of other viable Fire-types, 2HKOing Moltres as well as Ninetales, Arcanine, and Rapidash after some chip damage. Hyper Beam is Primeape's strongest attack, allowing it to revenge kill from high percentages. In addition, Hyper Beam prevents Rest Exeggcute from walling Primeape, with two Body Slams into critical hit Hyper Beam being a guaranteed KO. Alternatively, Thunderbolt is Primeape's strongest option against Blastoise, Seadra, and Kingler, 2HKOing the latter 91.5% of the time.</p> <p>Primeape is decently customizable due to its sizeable movepool. Thunder is a guaranteed 3HKO on Blastoise and Seadra, while with Thunderbolt this is only a chance. However, Thunder's poor accuracy leaves it as a niche option. Low Kick is a decent alternative to Submission, forgoing power for a chance to flinch the foe. This allows it to occasionally brute force through foes at high health without taking damage in the process. Counter can be used to heavily damage physical attackers such as Pinsir and Raticate, but it requires some level of prediction in order to be effective. Primeape can use Toxic to check AgiliWrap Dragonair and Fire Spin users, as they will take more damage from Toxic than it will deal with Wrap. Finally, Mega Kick deals high damage to some of Primeape's most notable checks, pairing with Hyper Beam to secure KOs on Nidoking, Mr. Mime, and Exeggcute.

Once Mr. Mime is sizably chipped, Primeape can outspeed and revenge kill it, removing one of its biggest roadblocks in the process. Notable Mr. Mime checks include Clefable, Exeggcute, Drowzee, and even your own Mr. Mime. Primeape is most successful when used as a mid-game wallbreaker, as most of its coveted targets like Clefable, Moltres, and Kingler come into play then.

Without Venusaur as a reliable target for it to switch into, as well as Moltres becoming less favored, Arcanine's regular lines of play have diminished. As a defensive Fire-type, it also has issues distinguishing itself from Rest Moltres outside of its admittedly crucial Body Slam access; while Moltres lacks it, it has more overall bulk, Fire Spin access, and generally inconsequential weaknesses, notably not being hit by Earthquake. Furthermore, while Arcanine's Charizard matchup is functional, it's just that: even minor chip damage, which it will sustain, can drastically worsen it.

However, with its limited coverage, setting the stage for Agility Arcanine can be difficult, and not having Fire Spin means it needs foes to be put in KO range for it to be consistent.</p> <p>Toxic can be used on lead Arcanine sets to poison potential Fire Spin leads, particularly Charizard and Ninetales, as well as give it something to catch Kabutops and Golem switching in. However, Charizard and Ninetales perform this role better due to their higher Speed and access to Fire Spin. Reflect can be used to further this role and mitigate Arcanine's Earthquake weakness, but the abundance of Swords Dance and Slash users that ignore this makes the utility limited. Leer can be used on paralysis-intensive teams to drop Defense while reapplying the foe's paralysis Speed drop, often forcing the opponent to switch it out, but this is especially niche.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types: Arcanine has nothing to contest Rock-types outside of hoping for a Fire Blast burn, leaving it countered by Golem and Kabutops, which 2HKO it with Earthquake and Surf, respectively. Kabutops is also excellent at making use of a resting Arcanine, as it often uses Swords Dance to threaten a sweep.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Arcanine takes massive damage from Water-type attacks, which all 2HKO Arcanine, making Pokemon like Blastoise, Seadra, and Kingler threatening. Kingler strongly dislikes taking paralysis from Body Slam or burn from Fire Blast but can still 2HKO Arcanine.</p> <p><strong>Charizard: Charizard can 3HKO Arcanine with Earthquake, which becomes a 2HKO if it's taken even minor damage. Swords Dance allows Charizard to exploit Arcanine if it uses Rest; in fact, Charizard coming in on a predicted Rest can end the game on the spot. A healthy Arcanine can mortally threaten Charizard with Body Slam paralysis, though, so this matchup can be volatile.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Once Arcanine uses Rest, it's left vulnerable to exploitation, and most setup sweepers have super effective coverage against it. Kingler, Kabutops, Sandslash, and Seadra are all capable of 2HKOing Arcanine after setting up.</p> ",

Backed by Hyper Beam, Arcanine can 2HKO Mr. Mime if it's taken minimal damage and quickly finish off Fire-resistant Pokemon. Rest should rarely be used but bolsters Arcanine's defensive role, ensuring it can reliably stonewall Moltres, which can't outspeed and chip it down with Toxic + Fire Spin without Agility, and also gives Arcanine a chance to potentially recover in front of a paralyzed foe. However, waking it up can be difficult outside of switching into Fire Spin or weak attackers like Venomoth.</p> <p>Arcanine can be used as an anti-lead, possessing just enough Speed and power to function. Critical hit Fire Blast OHKOes Venomoth, and Body Slam paralysis against any of Charizard, Mr. Mime, and even rare sights like Primeape can be game-defining. Arcanine's bulk allows it to duel lead Charizard quite well, as usage of Earthquake potentially means taking a hit it can't afford so early into a game. It should be remembered that Arcanine is not 2HKOed by Earthquake. However, Arcanine doesn't always need to be a lead, as it can be a strong mid-game presence thanks to the reliability that its bulk, power, and Body Slam access provide. Its Speed is just right for a revenge killer role as well, crucially outrunning base 90 Speed Pokemon like Mr. Mime that are otherwise quite difficult to bring down when they have the advantage. Teams that use Arcanine primarily use it alongside Blastoise, providing a useful defensive backbone against Charizard. Offensively, Arcanine can potentially allow Mr. Mime to flourish by fending off opposing Mr. Mime and Clefable. Using Arcanine takes up a valuable team slot for a second Fire-type, however; there is very little reason to drop Charizard for Arcanine, and thus teams must find ways to check Water- and Rock-types in spite of this increased weakness.</p> "

The choice between Hydro Pump and Surf is a matter of power versus consistency; Poliwag is already reliant on a very inaccurate move, further complicating this choice. While both Surf and Hydro Pump 2HKO most neutral targets, like Pinsir, some threats that are 2HKOed by a +2 Hydro Pump, such as Machamp and Porygon, either avoid or have extremely low odds to be 2HKOed by a +2 Surf. Additionally, a +2 Surf is incapable of OHKOing Nidoqueen and Arcanine and has extremely low odds of OHKOing Rapidash, while +2 Hydro Pump has high odds to OHKO the former pair and will always OHKO the latter. Psychic is Poliwag's best attack against Water-types, like Staryu and Seaking; while Hydro Pump does similar amounts of damage, Psychic's higher accuracy and chance for a Special drop give it solid odds to 2HKO the former and 3HKO the latter at +2. It also helps against Grass-types, as after an Amnesia boost it has decent odds to 2HKO Vileplume, and it will always 2HKO Weepinbell.</p> <p>Poliwag is an effective lead due to its high Speed and access to a sleep-inducing move, though it can also be used as an endgame cleaner.

Paralysis is a great way to handle these faster threats, so Poliwag also appreciates support from Thunder Wave users like Dragonair and Porygon. Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine themselves make great partners, as they can trade hits with each other and eliminate the status spreaders that give Poliwag trouble.</p> "

Unlike Amnesia users such as Slowbro and Snorlax, Poliwrath lacks the stats and typing to become unbreakable, but its Speed gives it a niche over them. Poliwrath outspeeds Exeggutor and can nail it with Blizzard after some chip damage, rather than having to fear Sleep Powder and Explosion like the other Amnesia users in the tier. It also possesses immediate threats against Chansey in the form of Hypnosis and Submission, which OHKOes with a critical hit.</p> <p>However, while Poliwrath possesses these advantages over Slowbro, it suffers from all of Slowbro's flaws and more. It needs a lot of setup to break past Starmie and Chansey, which often threaten it with Thunderbolt, and it is vulnerable to Psychic, making Pokemon like Alakazam and Jynx much more problematic than they are for Slowbro. Like Slowbro, even after setting up, Poliwrath needs to watch for enemy Explosions that can stop the party before it even starts. Perhaps most importantly of all, Slowbro is able to heal itself throughout the game and provide utility thanks to superior defensive stats paired with Thunder Wave, while Poliwrath does not possess the bulk nor the movepool to be anything other than a one-time breaker.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Poliwrath's Hydro Pumps deal incredible damage after only a few turns of Amnesia, which it can often find against paralyzed or sleeping foes, and it is capable of taking down multiple Pokemon in a single game if its primary checks, usually Starmie and Chansey, are either KOed by teammates or statused and weakened enough to be handled by Poliwrath itself.

Other Pokemon that may attempt to finish off a weakened or crippled Poliwrath are also significantly easier to take down with Hydro Pump than with Surf: Snorlax is OHKOed by +6 Hydro Pump but always stomachs a +6 Surf, while +4 is enough to drop Tauros. While the prospects of Hydro Pump's accuracy and PP will understandably scare players off, the favorable ranges this move reaches are simply too important.</p> <p>In the third slot, a tool against Exeggutor is highly recommended: Blizzard will hit for over half its HP after a single Amnesia, but if the team has no plans to put any other foes to sleep, then Hypnosis is also a valid way of threatening it, while also doubling as a way for Poliwrath to give itself free turns. For the last slot, many options are viable: Submission provides an immediate critical hit OHKO threat on Chansey, though the accuracy and recoil make it fairly inconsistent, while Surf's accuracy can be appreciated in specific scenarios where the extra damage from Hydro Pump is not required. Other options such as Body Slam, Counter, Psychic, and Rest can also have merits in very specific scenarios but are strongly discouraged, as they do not contribute to Poliwrath's primary purpose as a wallbreaker.</p> "

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Poliwrath has a genuinely massive movepool consisting of many interesting niche options. Psychic is somewhat useful on either set, as only Hypno and Kadabra resist it. It also happens to be Poliwrath’s strongest option against opposing Poliwrath and the rare Venomoth. However, Poliwrath’s relatively low Special stat makes the move underwhelming, even if it hits the target for super effective damage; Tentacruel is only 4HKOed. Surf can be used on the bulky sleeper set but suffers from the same problems as Psychic. The move fails to OHKO Dugtrio and is outclassed by Earthquake when hitting neutral targets like Hypno and Kadabra. It is mainly useful for hitting Persian and Kangaskhan, but Hydro Pump and Submission are typically stronger though less reliable options. Hyper Beam is a strong option for finishing off neutral targets, especially those with a low Defense stat. It is Poliwrath’s strongest move against Hypno, Kadabra, Articuno, Gyarados, and Vaporeon. Seismic Toss gives Poliwrath a consistent option for damage against every Pokemon, scoring a 4HKO or better against every major threat, aside from Vaporeon and Kangaskhan. It is seldom the strongest option for any Pokemon, but it reliably hits anything that could switch in. Counter is an interesting option for Persian, Kangaskhan, Vaporeon, and Omastar,which are quite likely to use a Normal-type move when facing Poliwrath, but it's difficult to fit into conventional sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Hypno and Kadabra: Hypno and Kadabra can easily 2HKO Poliwrath with Psychic. Aside from Hypnosis and Amnesia-boosted attacks, Poliwrath can only 4HKO or attempt to freeze Hypno. While Kadabra is much easier to KO, it outspeeds Poliwrath, which makes Poliwrath largely unable to threaten it. Kadabra’s high critical hit rate is also frightening for Poliwrath, as a critical hit Psychic will always OHKO, even after Amnesia boosts.</p> <p><strong>Gyarados</strong>: Unboosted Poliwrath lacks any tools to meaningfully threaten Gyarados outside of Hypnosis. Gyarados, meanwhile, outspeeds Poliwrath and will 2HKO it with Thunderbolt about one third of the time. Gyarados can even come in for free if it can correctly predict Earthquake. Additionally, Gyarados's impressive Attack allows it to pressure Poliwrath even after Amnesia.</p> <p><strong>Venusaur</strong>: Venusaur outspeeds Poliwrath and can deal massive damage with Razor Leaf. Thanks to the move's near-guaranteed critical hit, it will virtually always 2HKO Poliwrath even if it has used Amnesia. Additionally, Venusaur has a faster and more accurate sleep move than Poliwrath, giving it ample ability to pressure Poliwrath even at full health. Poliwrath can threaten Venusaur with a 3HKO from Blizzard, however.</p> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Users</strong>: Poliwrath's mediocre Special and Water typing leave it highly susceptible to Thunderbolt users. Electabuzz, Raichu, and Electrode are guaranteed to 2HKO Poliwrath and have high critical hit rates. Weaker and less common Thunderbolt users like Gyarados, Dragonite, Persian, Clefable, and Raticate also can deal pretty hefty damage to Poliwrath.</p> <p><strong>Dodrio: Dodrio's powerful Drill Peck is extremely likely to 2HKO Poliwrath. While Dodrio does fear Blizzard, it can potentially come in on Earthquake or Body Slam and still take out Poliwrath before Blizzard can KO it. Additionally, Dodrio can punish Rest very harshly, potentially setting up with Agility on top of getting the KO.</p> <p><strong>Partial-trapping Moves</strong>: Because Poliwrath has many exploitable weaknesses and is relatively slow, it is not overly difficult to whittle down with Wrap or Bind and pivot to a strong attacker that can finish it off. While Poliwrath has the potential to 2HKO all notable partial-trappers, Tentacruel, Dragonite, and Pinsir are still frequently used to handle Poliwrath. Additionally, if Dragonite hasn't sustained any damage, it is guaranteed to survive Blizzard, meaning it can set up with Agility unless Poliwrath happens to carry Toxic or land Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-type Pokemon: Bulky Water-type Pokemon, most notably Vaporeon, take little damage from all of Poliwrath's moves. Dewgong functions similarly, but is quite weak to Submission. Bulky Water-type Pokemon can't do too much in return outside of paralysis from Body Slam, however. Interestingly, Poliwrath is actually a solid check to itself once Sleep Clause is in effect, as no move aside from Psychic can 3HKO it.</p> ",

          "description": "<hr /> <h1>Outdated Analysis</h1> <h1>Overview</h1> <p>Poliwrath has very steep competition as one of many significant Water-type Pokemon in RBY UU. It does not have the speed of Tentacruel, the bulk of Vaporeon, the typing of Omastar, or the powerful STAB Ice-type moves of Dewgong. What Poliwrath does have, though, is one of the most diverse and interesting movepools of any Pokemon in the tier. For starters, it's the only legal fully evolved Water-type Pokemon with a sleep-inducing move, that being Hypnosis. While Hypnosis has underwhelming accuracy, it is a unique tool that threatens slower foes such as Hypno and deters quicker foes such as Tentacruel from switching in. Offensively, Poliwrath has options such as Body Slam, Earthquake, Submission, and Psychic on top of the staples Surf and Blizzard. While it can’t run all of these moves, Poliwrath can be tricky to play around and require scouting. To make it even more dynamic, Poliwrath also has Amnesia as a niche option that improves its offensive prowess and longevity. On top of all these options, Poliwrath can still serve as a traditional bulky Water-type Pokemon, being a soft check to Articuno and physical attackers like Dugtrio.</p> <p>Despite its impressive advantages, Poliwrath is just short of truly being a staple in RBY UU. The most obvious weakness is its typing; while having a powered-up Submission and resisting Rock Slide are good traits, being weak to Psychic and Flying far outweighs the positives. Hypno and Kadabra are incredibly common and enormously threatening, giving Poliwrath a major disadvantage not faced by other slow Water-type Pokemon. While Dodrio is less common, it too can easily knock out Poliwrath. Aside from this, Poliwrath has truly mediocre stats, lacking even one base stat with three digits. Physically, Poliwrath shines a little bit, as it has marginally more bulk than Vaporeon and Dewgong and hits as hard as Articuno. However, it is still outdone defensively by Omastar and offensively by most dedicated physical attackers. Specially, Poliwrath is very exploitable, being less bulky than even Dewgong by a fairly large margin. Its offensive options are similarly underwhelming; notably, Poliwrath’s Blizzard will always fail to OHKO Dragonite without a critical hit, meaning it can't reliably prevent AgiliWrap like other Water-type Pokemon. Poliwrath is a niche option with several unfortunate shortcomings, fitting best on teams that need a bulky Water-type Pokemon and a sleeper in one Pokemon.</p> "

          "name": "Bulky Sleeper",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Hypnosis is Poliwrath’s biggest selling point over conventional Water-type Pokemon. The move can be used in a number of ways to get an advantage, especially early-game. If Poliwrath can get in against the slower Hypno, it's usually free to induce sleep. This can be accomplished by switching in as Hypno wakes up from Rest, or by using a Pokemon like Kadabra or Electabuzz to bait it in. Poliwrath also happens to be faster than Vaporeon and Omastar while Speed tying with Dewgong, meaning it can easily threaten them with Hypnosis as well. Unlike Hypno, these Pokemon struggle to punish Poliwrath if it misses. While it is typically used early-game, Hypnosis is a decent tool throughout the entire match, as it gives Poliwrath an option to stymie dangerous sweepers like Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Articuno. Blizzard hits many key targets in the metagame for respectable damage. Blizzard 2HKOes Dugtrio, Dragonite, and Aerodactyl and 3HKOes Tangela and Venusaur. The damage on Dragonite is especially important, as Poliwrath has limited tools to stop AgiliWrap, especially if it has already hit something with Hypnosis. Poliwrath will typically make use of a physical move, as its decent Attack allows it to deal solid damage to Water-type Pokemon, especially Tentacruel and Omastar. Earthquake is a common choice because it can 2HKO Tentacruel over half the time. Tentacruel is fairly hesitant to engage with Poliwrath, as Earthquake can deal immense damage on the switch or if Wrap misses. Earthquake is also notable for 2HKOing Haunter, Electabuzz, and Raichu and almost certainly 3HKOing Omastar.</p> <p>Poliwrath’s final moveslot is usually dedicated to additional coverage or Rest. Body Slam is much weaker than Earthquake, but the chance for paralysis is very helpful for stymieing partial-trappers like Dragonite and offensive checks like Gyarados, Kadabra, and Electric-type Pokemon. Submission is another strong option that applies a lot of pressure to Normal-type Pokemon while also giving Poliwrath more options for Rock- and Ice-type Pokemon. Submission always 2HKOes Persian and can 2HKO Kangaskhan, Clefable, and Dewgong. Despite these advantages, Submission is not an overly common choice due to its low accuracy and dreadful recoil, which limit a Pokemon that is already not very bulky. Hydro Pump is Poliwrath’s strongest move against neutral targets like Hypno. The move is guaranteed to OHKO Dugtrio and Golem. Additionally, Hydro Pump 4HKOes Hypno and is Poliwrath's best option for hitting Kangaskhan and Persian after Submission. Lastly, Rest helps extend Poliwrath’s usefulness throughout the game. The move is most useful when Poliwrath is expected to take a more defensive role, such as checking Dugtrio or Articuno. However, Poliwrath’s numerous weaknesses leave it very vulnerable while it is asleep.</p> <p>Poliwrath is best suited for teams that appreciate the offensive advantages of sleep and the defensive advantages of a bulky Water-type Pokemon. Because of its somewhat quick Hypnosis, Pokemon that can bait in Hypno, Tangela, and bulky Water-type Pokemon tend to be good partners. These include Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Kangaskhan. Wrappers like Tentacruel and Dragonite are also helpful for pivoting so Poliwrath can get in more safely. Poliwrath's ability to soft check Articuno and physical attackers like Dugtrio and Kangaskhan means it works quite well with Flying-, Ground-, and Electric-type Pokemon. Flying-type Pokemon are additionally good partners thanks to Poliwrath's resistance to Rock. This means Poliwrath can get in rather safely against Dugtrio if it needs to. Due to its Psychic weakness, Poliwrath typically requires the support of multiple Psychic-type Pokemon, making both Hypno and Kadabra standard partners. Pokemon like Tangela, Dragonite, Dugtrio, and Golem are also good for patching up weak spots that Poliwrath might bring to a team. Agility sweepers like Articuno, Dodrio, and Dragonite appreciate Hypnosis incapacitating a key Pokemon or providing them with an opportunity to set up.</p> "

          "name": "Amnesia",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>After Hypnosis, Amnesia is the next most interesting option available to Poliwrath. Successfully setting up with Amnesia is fairly difficult in RBY UU, primarily due to the abundant use of Wrap. While Poliwrath doesn’t suffer a ton of damage from Wrap, it is not uncommon for a Pokemon such as Tentacruel to switch in as Poliwrath first uses Amnesia, use Wrap to chip it, and pivot out to something that can pick Poliwrath off. This issue is worsened by the fact that Amnesia does nothing for Poliwrath’s weakness to Drill Peck, meaning Dodrio can always knock out Poliwrath once its health drops below 50%. Additionally, Poliwrath competes with the already uncommon Golduck in this role, which has superior typing and Speed for an easier time when setting up. However, Amnesia still demands a lot of respect to deal with, meaning that it can drive very predictable switches that can be exploited. For example, if the opponent relies on Tentacruel to pressure Amnesia Poliwrath, mixing in Hypnosis or Earthquake can harshly punish the switch-in.</p> <p>If the opponent lacks strong options to finish off a weakened Poliwrath, like Kadabra or Dodrio, Amnesia becomes a lot more practical. Even if Wrap is still on the table, Poliwrath’s above-average physical bulk enables it to stomach a few hits as it waits for misses, during which it can boost, attack, or heal with Rest. If Wrap isn’t present, Poliwrath really only fears critical and being frozen, meaning it can set up in front of a surprisingly large number of Pokemon, most notably Articuno and bulky Water-type Pokemon. Surf is generally the special move of choice due to STAB and its high PP. At +4 Special, Surf will 2HKO every neutral target in the tier. At +6, Surf can 3HKO even the mighty Vaporeon, meaning nothing can Rest stall Poliwrath. Blizzard is often used alongside Surf for perfect coverage against everything but Water-type Pokemon. It also allows Poliwrath to threaten Dragonite, Venusaur, and Tangela without boosting. Earthquake and Hypnosis can alternatively be used to punish common switch-ins to Amnesia Poliwrath, most notably Tentacruel. Hypnosis can also potentially net Poliwrath a free turn to set up, which can be crucial for extra damage or bulk.</p> <p>Amnesia Poliwrath requires a lot of support to function properly, as a number of things can go wrong. Dodrio and Venusaur are entirely unfazed by Poliwrath’s boosting and can reliably KO it once it drops below 50%, so Pokemon that can handle them are quite helpful; these include Rock-, Ice-, and Flying-type Pokemon. Pokemon like Dugtrio, Kadabra, and Kangaskhan can pressure common Poliwrath switch-ins like Tentacruel, Electabuzz, Hypno, and Kadabra, which can often come in for free when the opponent expects Poliwrath to use Amnesia. This makes Pokemon like Dugtrio, Kanagaskhan, and Kadabra notable partners. If Poliwrath is not running Hypnosis, sleepers like Haunter, Venusaur, and Tangela are good choices, as they help it find free turns to set up or quickly dispatch a key threat. Paralysis spreaders make it hard for physical attackers like Persian and Kangaskhan to punish Poliwrath while it is asleep from Rest.</p> "

It's also one of the fastest users of Thunder Wave in the tier, often forcing out fast threats like Charizard and Electrode that dislike paralysis.</p> <p>However, Abra is comically frail, being 2HKOed or OHKOed by nearly every physical move in the tier, even from coverage moves like Blastoise's Body Slam and Charizard's Earthquake. It also lacks a reliable recovery option to compensate for this, making it very hard to switch in, even against the Pokemon that it's supposed to threaten. Its coverage is also limited to Seismic Toss, so it struggles versus Psychic-types like Exeggcute and the ubiquitous Mr. Mime. Mr. Mime also mostly outclasses Abra, having better coverage as well as physical bulk, with only a slightly weaker Psychic.</p> ",

  "Kadabra": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Even though Kadabra isn't fully evolved, it is one of the premier choices in RBY UU due to its base 105 Speed and base 120 Special. These stats give it a high volatility factor, with a 20.5% critical hit rate combined with the 33.2% chance of a Special drop from an already powerful Psychic. It outspeeds many other Pokemon in the tier and can either hit them hard or cripple them with paralysis. This includes the ever-present Tentacruel, which is outsped and takes massive damage from the strongest Psychic in the tier or loses a lot of its effectiveness if paralyzed. This makes Kadabra an effective anti-lead choice, as Tentacruel is perhaps the most common lead in UU. Due to Kadabra's high Special stat, it can also switch in and tank special attacks surprisingly well.</p> <p>However, Kadabra is not quite in the conversation for being the best Pokemon in the tier. It is walled hard by Hypno, arguably the second-best Pokemon in RBY UU behind Tentacruel. It's almost a given that when your Kadabra is in, your opponent's Hypno will not be far behind, as Kadabra can only really chip it with Seismic Toss or fish for a Special drop with Psychic. In addition, Kadabra is pitifully frail on the physical side, with only base 40 HP and 30 Defense. It has to watch out for Persian especially, which outspeeds it and hits it hard with STAB Slash. Many other physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Dodrio can 2HKO or even OHKO Kadabra, meaning that you need to tread carefully, especially if Kadabra is paralyzed. That said, its positives as a strong and fast Psychic-type far outweigh its negatives, and it can find a place on most RBY UU teams.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>If you're replacing any move, Seismic Toss is the one to replace. Counter can surprise physical attackers and net some surprise KOs, especially in the niche scenario where you use Explosion with Haunter or Golem and then bring Kadabra in and Counter your own Explosion. Counter can also force Hypno to have to use Rest sooner if it is spamming Seismic Toss. However, your own Seismic Toss is generally a better and more consistent damage dealer, especially to opposing Psychic-types. Reflect can be used to increase survivability, but even with this Defense boost, Kadabra is still pretty frail; it still takes over 50% on Hyper Beams from some of the stronger physical attackers in the tier, such as Kangaskhan and Dodrio. Again, Seismic Toss is almost always the better choice here.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Hypno: Hypno is easily the best check to Kadabra, as it's on the vast majority of RBY UU teams anyway and stonewalls everything that Kadabra tries to do. If you bring in Kadabra to attempt a revenge kill, you can be sure that your opponent will bring in Hypno to negate your plans with ease. Hypno can easily tank Psychic and is only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss, meaning that it can recover off any damage Kadabra deals and rid itself of Thunder Wave paralysis with Rest. Therefore, outside of getting lucky with Special drops from Psychic or full paralysis, you probably won't be KOing Hypno with Kadabra, and Kadabra will most likely need to use Recover and switch out. Worse still, Hypno can paralyze Kadabra with Thunder Wave, hampering its usefulness for the rest of the game, or even put it to sleep with Hypnosis, which is normally a death sentence in any RBY tier.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Kadabra</strong>: Kadabra also does a decent job at checking itself. If the opponent's Kadabra is already paralyzed, it can switch in to absorb a Thunder Wave from your Kadabra. From there, it can threaten with its own Thunder Wave. Most Kadabra versus Kadabra matchups start with them paralyzing each other, and then it becomes a battle of Seismic Toss and Recover until one switches out or faints.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio gets a special mention as a check because it can switch in on a Thunder Wave for free and threaten a KO on Kadabra if it is at 70% health or below. Dugtrio is one of the few Pokemon that can outspeed Kadabra and 2HKO it; unless Kadabra scores a critical hit with Psychic, Dugtrio wins the head-to-head matchup from full health. Furthermore, since Kadabra is the best Tentacruel check in the entire tier, it often comes in on Wrap to wait out the attack and then scare out Tentacruel once it ends, but since Wrap immobilizes Kadabra and does chip damage, Tentacruel can whittle Kadabra down just enough so that Dugtrio can switch in while Kadabra is unable to attack and is in the range of Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Due to Kadabra's low HP and Defense, many strong physical attackers threaten it. To start, Persian outspeeds Kadabra and easily 2HKOes with Slash, meaning, much like Dugtrio, it wins the one-on-one from full health unless Psychic lands a critical hit. Dodrio and Kangaskhan are both outsped by Kadabra and don't like being paralyzed, but they have a guaranteed OHKO on Kadabra with Hyper Beam, making them scary to face. Raticate also can OHKO Kadabra 74.4% of the time with Hyper Beam, putting it in a similar category to the aforementioned Normal-types. Other physical attackers that can OHKO Kadabra with Hyper Beam include Dragonite and Gyarados. Though these attackers have much lower chances to OHKO, they are still scary in their own right with Body Slam. Finally, Aerodactyl has proven its worth in RBY UU and can outspeed and KO Kadabra from 74.9-88.3% health with Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Articuno: Articuno, though not as common of a selection as some previously mentioned Pokemon, is similar to Hypno as a check because it can sponge hits and heal off damage and paralysis with Rest. Both Psychic and Seismic Toss are only 4HKOs on Articuno, meaning that it should be able to survive most encounters. Articuno can also use Agility to shrug off the paralysis Speed drop and become akin to a Hustle sweeper in later generations with a 75% chance to move. What makes Articuno an especially good check, however, is that it can 2HKO Kadabra over 80% of the time with two Blizzards, or always 2HKO with Blizzard into Hyper Beam. Add in the threat of freeze with Blizzard or Ice Beam, and Articuno is a check that can send Kadabra running.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This is the bread-and-butter set that you'll see virtually every Kadabra run, and for good reason. As mentioned before, Kadabra has the strongest Psychic in the tier and will hit pretty much everything except Hypno and opposing Kadabra for consistent damage. Thunder Wave is used to paralyze foes, most notably dangerous Wrap users like Tentacruel and Dragonite. After paralysis, Wrap only connects about 66% of the time, which severely hampers the Wrap user's effectiveness. Seismic Toss is Kadabra's go-to damage option against Hypno and opposing Kadabra, and Recover increases Kadabra's longevity, especially over the course of long games where you may need to PP stall opposing Psychic-types. For example, against Hypno that may opt for Hypnosis over Seismic Toss, Kadabra will have the upper hand.</p> <p>Using Kadabra is an exercise in how well you can spread damage with Psychic and paralysis with Thunder Wave while avoiding it taking physical attacks and paralysis yourself. This can mean having to predict your opponent's switches, which is not always an easy task. This is why Kadabra appreciates Wrap users like Tentacruel and Dragonite on its side to get a free switch-in. Once switched in, Kadabra's job is made a little easier because just by using Psychic, it can get good luck with its naturally high 20.5% critical hit rate and 33.2% chance to drop the other Pokemon's Special. That said, relying on that volatility can put Kadabra in a bad spot against Pokemon that can exploit its physical frailty. Clever switching or a Thunder Wave to catch and paralyze such an attacker may be what is needed to turn the tide of battle in your favor. Just keep in mind that your opponent could have Dugtrio lurking to absorb paralysis, and then your Kadabra could be in trouble, as Dugtrio outspeeds Kadabra and KOes it with Earthquake if it is at about 70% health.</p> <p>Kadabra is certainly not dead weight when it's paralyzed, as paralysis actually allows it to switch in against sleep users, such as Hypno and Haunter, with little fear. However, it does become harder to use and much easier to revenge kill. Thus, pairing it with a Ground-type that can absorb opposing Thunder Waves like Dugtrio or Golem is a good choice. Just be sure that your Ground-type has enough health to deal with the Thunder Wave user it is switching into. In addition, Flying-types such as Dragonite, Articuno, and Dodrio can help deal with the aforementioned Dugtrio problem by switching in for free on an Earthquake. Haunter is also a good partner for Kadabra given the prevalence of strong Normal-type moves in RBY. Haunter is immune to these moves that can KO Kadabra easily, as well as Wrap. Bulky Water-types such as Omastar and Vaporeon can also check these strong physical attackers. Haunter and Omastar notably form the strongest anti-Wrap core in RBY UU; this is a godsend for a physically frail Pokemon like Kadabra. They pair well with Kadabra because wasting sleep turns against Wrap users to wake Kadabra up is not ideal, as Kadabra takes 6-7% from Tentacruel and 9.1-10.9% from Dragonite on each hit.</p> "

  "Alakazam": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>In a generation where Psychic-type attacks are only resisted by the same type, and because its only weakness may as well not exist, it's not surprising that Alakazam is an incredible threat in RBY OU. Alakazam is most commonly seen in the lead slot due to possessing excellent Speed and access to Thunder Wave; it outspeeds every Pokemon that has access to a sleep move, allowing it to immediately cripple them with paralysis. It also has the strongest Psychic in OU by virtue of its excellent Special and as such can heavily pressure its most common checks. This Special stat also makes it a decent sponge for opposing moves like Psychic, though its HP limits this slightly. It is also good at absorbing sleep, since it resists Exeggutor's Psychic. Unlike Starmie, Alakazam doesn't have a weakness to Thunderbolt, which can come in handy for absorbing sleep from the likes of Gengar and Lapras. Alakazam can also prove to be very effective outside the lead slot, maintaining excellent utility against various threats and potentially turning into a dangerous sweeper if its most common checks have been removed. However, it can be difficult to consistently keep Alakazam safe from paralysis; if paralyzed, Alakazam often finds its low Defense being exploited by strong physical attackers such as Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros. It's also very reliant on its Psychic, which means it is difficult to break past Chansey. Overall, Alakazam is a regular presence in RBY OU and one of the best Psychic-types available, but its extreme vulnerability to strong physical attacks and paralysis keeps it firmly below the top of the pyramid.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder Wave, Psychic, and Recover should never be dropped. Though the last move is somewhat flexible, Alakazam's movepool is very shallow, so it should generally stick to the options mentioned. Counter has some utility when forcing out threats after the opponent KOed one of your Pokemon with a hard-hitting Normal-type attack from high health, such as Explosion, Self-Destruct, or Hyper Beam. This can be used to force damage against whatever switches in or even outright KO it. It also has situational use in Alakazam mirrors, as countering Seismic Toss can leave the opposing Alakazam severely weakened.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon can hit Alakazam through its weak Defense and KO it, especially if it's paralyzed. They should try to switch in on Recover, though, as Psychic will do a big chunk of damage to all of them. Snorlax deserves a special mention for early-game, as it's crippled way less by paralysis and Psychic damage than the other Pokemon mentioned. Rhydon can also switch in on Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Almost all Psychic-types can check Alakazam, although most of them can be broken through with paralysis and Special drops. Although it generally should not come out early-game, Slowbro is particularly dangerous, as it can set up on Alakazam safely and heal its paralysis with Rest. Starmie and opposing Alakazam can also take Alakazam's Psychic and Seismic Toss and threaten it in return with their own attacks and paralysis, but these matchups can swing either way with repeated full paralysis or Special drops from either side. Surf variants of Starmie are especially dangerous, as they can deal heavy damage to Alakazam. Jynx can be used to check Alakazam in an emergency, but it is passive when doing so, vulnerable to critical hits, and better used for other tasks.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Alakazam is a special attacker, and like all special attackers, Chansey makes a decent check. Chansey can attempt to paralyze Alakazam and pressure with Seismic Toss and to a lesser extent Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. This can force Alakazam to heal with Recover, allowing the opponent to switch into a physical threat. However, due to Psychic's secondary effect, paralysis, and Alakazam's high critical hit rate, Chansey will eventually be forced to either use Soft-Boiled or switch out. Should it get unlucky with full paralysis when trying to use Soft-Boiled, it can even be KOed. It's common to see Chansey switch in on a lead Alakazam and take a Thunder Wave to block sleep later. It can then attempt to put Alakazam to sleep with Sing on the next turn. Chansey can also attempt to fish for a freeze with Ice Beam if Alakazam isn't paralyzed, though this is risky.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor can switch into Alakazam on Turn 1 to immediately try to put it to sleep. However, the opponent would need to be content taking paralysis and getting hit by at least one Seismic Toss, which reduces the longevity of Exeggutor. This makes it much worse at checking Rhydon later in the game. If you try to prevent Alakazam from being paralyzed by switching to Chansey, the opponent gains a huge advantage, as Exeggutor can outspeed Chansey and put it to sleep. In general, though, Exeggutor checks Alakazam well. However, it struggles to pressure Alakazam enough before getting worn down by Seismic Toss, often forcing it to use Explosion.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Alakazam is one of the best leads in RBY OU. Since it's the fastest lead that regularly sees use, it's almost guaranteed to be able to immediately cripple something from the start of the game, be it through paralysis or serious damage with Psychic. This means Alakazam is great for pressuring opposing leads. Against other Alakazam, one generally wants to paralyze it and try to get a physical attacker like Snorlax in on a predicted Recover. However, be careful to not leave the field too damaged, as Exeggutor can have Double-Edge or Hyper Beam to pressure Alakazam. Generally, you don't want to switch out at less than 80% in order for Alakazam to avoid the 2HKO from Exeggutor's Double-Edge most of the time. Gengar leads generally switch out against Alakazam due to the threat of a 2HKO from Psychic as well as an OHKO with a critical hit. Starmie should generally be approached the same way as an opposing Alakazam. However, one must be wary of Chansey when using Thunder Wave early on; its extreme bulk turns it into a phenomenal sleep blocker when paralyzed. As a result, it becomes very difficult to put anything to sleep until the now-paralyzed Chansey is KOed.</p> <p>A lead Alakazam's role, besides crippling the opposing lead, is mostly to absorb sleep. If used in this fashion, Alakazam should absolutely be running Seismic Toss. This allows Alakazam to hit Starmie and Exeggutor rather than waste Psychic's PP. Lead Alakazam can also be used to absorb paralysis from those who propagate it, such as Chansey, Starmie, and other Alakazam. This especially goes for Chansey without Seismic Toss. It's also effective against Starmie without Surf or Psychic, the latter of which can force Alakazam out after a few Special drops. Alakazam also tends to attract physical attackers like Snorlax, Tauros, and Rhydon on a forced Recover turn. If you can correctly predict the switch, you might be able to sneak in a Thunder Wave or Psychic on them. Moreover, due to Alakazam being one of the few pure special attackers that can force Chansey out, it is also an efficient paralysis spreader that can be used as such throughout the course of the battle.</p> <p>In some situations, you might still resort to using non-lead Alakazam as if it were in the lead slot to check or pressure opposing Pokemon such as Chansey and Starmie. It can also be used to function as a sweeper late-game. This strategy revolves around keeping Alakazam hidden, then attempting to clean up once its checks have been removed. Reflect can be used on sweeper Alakazam to give it a much-needed Defense boost, but it also means Alakazam will only have Psychic to attack with. In addition, Reflect Alakazam can still be taken care of through paralysis, critical hits from Tauros and Zapdos, and Explosion. Explosion is especially pressing if paralyzed, as even if Reflect Alakazam survives, it's still easily revenge killed by threats such as Tauros. However, Seismic Toss remains very usable in this context for beating Starmie and other Psychic-types more consistently.</p> <p>When using Alakazam as a sweeper, the rest of the team should work on removing Alakazam's checks before it's revealed. These checks include special sponges such as Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey. Pokemon that resist Psychic, such as Slowbro and Exeggutor, are also important to remove. For maintaining maximum sweeping potential, Alakazam should also try to avoid paralysis as much as possible, as its Speed is the reason it's able to compete with other late-game sweepers for a team slot. Ideally, Tauros should also be put in range of Psychic to avoid its high critical hit rate and Body Slam's paralysis chance. Fortunately, that can easily be accomplished through a Tauros mirror, a common scenario in RBY OU battles, since two Body Slams will leave the opponent's Tauros in said range.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Alakazam's great typing and stellar base stats give it the most threatening Psychic in the tier and more Speed than every viable Pokemon bar Jolteon. Even with Stadium's changes, it maintains a 19.1% critical hit rate; in conjunction with paralysis and Special drops, this allows Psychic to eventually break through even Chansey and Psychic-resistant foes. Alakazam has exceptional moves in Thunder Wave and Recover, granting it considerable utility against most threats. Alakazam can serve as a status spreader, special wall, and potential sweeper; its Speed allows it to use Substitute to block Thunder Waves and preserve its sweeping potential. It can also function well when paralyzed, as it becomes a reasonable status absorber. A paralyzed Alakazam has its limits, however—physical threats like Snorlax and Tauros can outspeed and 2HKO it or set up Substitute to thwart its Thunder Wave.  Alakazam faces another obstacle in the pervasive Rest Exeggutor, which can stall out its Seismic Toss and threaten it with Stun Spore and Double-Edge. Nevertheless, Alakazam is an extremely common sight thanks to its versatility and support capability.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Reflect is a shaky alternative to Substitute; its benefits are outweighed by the fact it doesn't protect Alakazam from critical hits or status. Counter theoretically allows Alakazam to surprise physical attackers, but mechanics changes in Stadium reduce its utility. Alakazam's low HP also means it will rarely OHKO attackers and risks Body Slam paralysis, neutering it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Once Alakazam is paralyzed, Snorlax, Tauros, Rhydon, Persian, Kangaskhan, and other physically potent threats can switch in on Recover and threaten Alakazam. None of these like taking Psychics, though, and most despise Thunder Wave. However, attempting to paralyze physical Pokemon is risky once they are already in, as they can potentially block it with Substitute and become even more difficult to stop.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Exeggutor and Slowbro both check Alakazam; Exeggutor can threaten it with Double-Edge and Stun Spore, while Slowbro can set up Amnesia freely. Both also carry Rest to thwart Thunder Wave and heal off Seismic Toss. Despite this, Seismic Toss will eventually force them to use Rest, providing opportunities to pressure them with other attackers. Starmie and opposing Alakazam can also hamstring Alakazam with Thunder Wave, stall it with Recover, or force it to Recover and switch to a physical attacker, potentially catching Alakazam as it fully paralyzes. However, this comes at a cost, as Starmie and Alakazam will almost certainly be paralyzed in the process.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey's special bulk and access to instant recovery in Soft-Boiled allows it to sponge multiple Psychics from Alakazam, giving it room to use Thunder Wave or inflict chip damage so a physical teammate can switch in on its Recover. With some luck, though, Alakazam can break through paralyzed Chansey, particularly if it is already chipped prior to switching in. Chansey especially has trouble against Substitute Alakazam if it lacks Seismic Toss, as none of its other moves are capable of breaking Substitute in one hit.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Psychic is a threat to any non-resistant Pokemon—even Chansey cannot withstand extended exposure if it is paralyzed. Thunder Wave is irreplacable, as paralysis is what allows Alakazam to break down Chansey and opposing Psychic-types. Unlike in RBY, however, Substitute blocks Thunder Wave, making it a risky move if Alakazam is paralyzed itself—fast physical users like Tauros, Persian, and Kangaskhan become much more threatening if given the opportunity to set it up. Recover lets Alakazam heal off damage, but can invite in physical attackers if Alakazam is paralyzed. Seismic Toss is strongly recommended, as it allows Alakazam to pressure opposing Psychic-types effectively while saving Psychic PP, but Substitute can be used instead to protect Alakazam from status moves and critical hits, making it an effective late-game sweeper if opposing Psychic-types are removed. Chansey cannot break Substitute in one hit without Seismic Toss, so Alakazam can pressure BoltBeam Chansey safely. Furthermore, Substitute can help Alakazam PP stall some foes more effectively, as Alakazam won't be vulnerable to secondary effects from damaging moves when using it. Unfortunately, Substitute Alakazam itself is much easier to PP stall by switching between Psychic-types and Chansey to waste PP.</p> <p>Alakazam is better used in the back, but as a lead it sports fair matchups against Chansey and the rare Jynx, as it can paralyze them with Thunder Wave and then proceed to pressure them with Psychic or Seismic Toss. Unfortunately, Exeggutor is the most common lead and fares well against it, as Exeggutor can scout for Substitute with Double-Edge and hamstring it with Stun Spore when it is forced to use Recover. Snorlax performs well against Alakazam too; Body Slam 2HKOes and threatens paralysis simultaneously. Alakazam can choose to take paralysis and become a decent status absorber, providing an avenue to protect teammates like Reflect Chansey from paralysis so it can switch into and wall Snorlax for Alakazam. However, this forfeits its excellent Speed. Unparalyzed Alakazam can revenge kill fast offensive threats like Tauros, Zapdos, and the rare Persian, threaten them with Thunder Wave, and act as a sweeper.</p> <p>Psychic's ability to break past paralyzed Chansey can provide an opportunity for Alakazam to paralyze a Pokemon when Chansey switches out or use Seismic Toss to pressure paralyzed Psychic-types as they enter. In an Alakazam mirror match, the typical strategy is to paralyze the opposing Alakazam, use Seismic Toss to chip it down, and switch out to a physical attacker when it is expected to use Recover. Unlike in RBY, Special drops from Psychic no longer reapply the paralysis Speed penalty, so there is little reason to waste Psychic PP in the mirror match. The threat of Thunder Wave puts pressure on fast Pokemon, such as Starmie and Tauros, to switch out to a paralyzed teammate or Chansey to absorb it. While this means Alakazam will rarely paralyze multiple Pokemon, it can use Psychic or Seismic Toss instead to pressure and potentially overwhelm these status absorbers as they come in, or it can switch out to a physical threat that can deal significantly higher immediate damage to them, like Snorlax.</p> <p>Alakazam works well with teammates that can deal with other Psychic-types and Chansey. Zapdos' STAB moves 2HKO Starmie, Slowbro, and the omnipresent Exeggutor; Zapdos also 3HKOes Chansey and opposing Alakazam. In return, Alakazam can threaten Rhydon and take Psychic and Ice-type moves for Zapdos. Tauros and Persian can threaten most of Alakazam's walls, though care must be taken with them, as they despise being paralyzed. Notably, Persian 3HKOes Exeggutor with Slash, allowing it to switch in on its Rest and KO it or force it out. Alakazam returns the favor by providing valuable paralysis support and dealing with Gengar. Alakazam also appreciates teammates that can switch into physical attackers. Cloyster walls Snorlax and Tauros lacking Thunderbolt, 2HKOes Exeggutor with Blizzard, and leaves Starmie in OHKO range with Explosion. Gengar is another excellent partner, as it can wall Snorlax and Tauros should they lack Earthquake. Offensively, it carries a strong Thunderbolt to hit Starmie and Slowbro, and its Explosion can be used to deal significant damage to Chansey.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Machamp's solid bulk and powerful offenses make it the premier check to Nidoqueen, avoiding a 3HKO from any of its attacks while 2HKOing back with Earthquake. Its multitude of offensive options, such as Earthquake, Body Slam, and Hyper Beam, make it difficult for Fighting-resistant foes, like Gastly and Abra, to check it. Machamp's bulk allows it to reliably avoid 2HKOs from threats like Pinsir and Seaking, making it a good blanket check to most of PU. Lastly, Machamp's Speed, while poor, has some merit, outpacing defensive stalwarts like Omanyte, Porygon, and Graveler.</p> <p>However, Machamp suffers from its low Speed and poor defensive utility barring raw bulk; it requires paralysis support while fearing paralysis itself, and it is vulnerable to being worn down quickly. A paralyzed Machamp becomes quite simple to revenge kill, exposing its weak defensive profile to slower attackers. Weaknesses to Flying- and Psychic-type attacks from Fearow, Abra, Drowzee, and Gastly don't help it either. Other physical attackers like Pinsir and Seaking also give it significant competition, offering higher Speed and additional utility as wallbreakers.</p> ",

      "overview": "<p>With STAB Fighting-type haymakers at its disposal, Machamp can look enticing to the average player. Being as fast as Exeggutor ensures it edges out and 2HKOes Chansey with even Low Kick, which many Pokemon simply cannot achieve. Similarly, Machamp has the potential to give Tauros and Snorlax trouble, albeit to a lesser extent due to a deathly fear of paralysis. It's also got some fair physical bulk and a handy resistance to Rock Slide, allowing it to switch into and threaten Rhydon. This boils down to solidifying Machamp as a straightforward attacker that benefits strongly from paralysis support.</p> <p>Machamp's main problem is that while nearly every team includes the \"Big 3\" Normal-types — which Machamp can excel against in a flat one-on-one — a Psychic-type usually isn't far behind them. Machamp simply can't deal with Psychic-types, often failing to muster even a 2HKO on most and taking massive damage in return. Ergo, while Machamp hits like a freight train, it offers little defensive utility, which often opens gaping holes in its team. Additionally, Machamp despises paralysis, as what little Speed it has is what ensures it can threaten the Normal-types it wants to go after. When looking for a Pokemon to pummel paralyzed teams, Rhydon is often a better choice, possessing much greater defensive utility, immunity to Thunder Wave, and generally superior STAB moves. Machamp is thus a rare sight in RBY OU and generally isn't recommended.</p> ",

Thanks to this, Machamp can potentially 2HKO a paralyzed Chansey — a very common sight in RBY OU — before it can muster a response. Alternatively, Submission can be used for more power, allowing Machamp to 2HKO Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros, albeit at the cost of significant recoil. Body Slam lets Machamp be a little more self-sufficient, paralyzing potential switch-ins to turn the tables on them. Hyper Beam is Machamp's strongest Normal-type attack, allowing it to KO Pokemon that otherwise shrug off its STAB move. Alakazam is a noteworthy target, as it can end up being 2HKOed switching in if it's paralyzed by Body Slam first. Finally, Earthquake ensures Machamp isn't completely helpless against Gengar, 2HKOing it and Jolteon.</p> <p>Machamp has a wide offensive movepool, allowing it to fine-tune itself to fit a team. Using both Submission and Low Kick can let Machamp 2HKO Tauros, allowing it to more cleanly win a one-on-one interaction. Fire Blast deals up to 34.6% to Exeggutor with a high burn rate that can ruin its Explosion. Counter can be effective with Machamp's stat line, allowing it to switch in on a Hyper Beam and score a guaranteed OHKO on Pokemon like Tauros and Snorlax. This also applies when switching into Snorlax's Body Slam and Chansey's Seismic Toss; both Pokemon will often switch out in response, allowing Machamp to severely damage the switch-in. Since Machamp struggles a bit against Reflect Chansey, Karate Chop can be a serviceable option, being what's effectively a 100-Base Power Normal-type move that ignores Reflect thanks to its near-guaranteed critical hit rate. Unfortunately, Machamp's Speed leaves Karate Chop short of the 99.6% cap, making it a tad inconsistent. Finally, Rock Slide can be used for better matchups against Articuno and Zapdos, but it falls short of 2HKOing the latter, which makes it questionable.</p> "

This is bolstered by its near-perfect coverage with options such as Rock Slide and Earthquake and STAB Fighting-type moves to threaten Rock- and Normal-type Pokemon, such as Golem and Clefable. This lets it perform well with paralysis support, especially with Low Kick, letting it outspeed a good portion of the tier. It also has some niche defensive utility, as its Rock resistance gives it synergy with Fire-types such as Charizard and Moltres.</p> <p>However, while Machamp does hit quite hard, it lacks broad defensive utility due to its few resistances and a devastating Psychic weakness. Machamp’s poor Special stat leaves it vulnerable to special attackers like Poliwhirl, Moltres, the elusive Abra, and the ubiquitous Mr. Mime. In addition to this, its poor Speed requires major paralysis support as to not get overwhelmed by the aforementioned special attackers. The Speed issue means Machamp is equally afraid of being paralyzed, as it needs to be able to outspeed opposing Pokemon to pose a threat. All partial trappers in the tier also outspeed and take advantage of it. As if this wasn’t enough, Machamp faces stiff competition with Primeape and Golem, the former boasting Thunderbolt and a much higher Speed tier, and the latter having STAB on Machamp’s coverage options and making better use of the paralysis support needed for Machamp to work. Overall, Machamp is a very high-risk Pokemon with moderate reward, so it's not recommended for use on most competitive teams; physical attackers such as Golem, Pinsir, and Kingler take better advantage of the support Machamp needs.</p> ",

Its awful Fire, Flying, Psychic, and Ice weaknesses mean it gets demolished by common threats like Rapidash, Arcanine, Fearow, Gastly, and Nidoqueen. Its poor Speed adds to its woes, usually leaving it outsped and forced to take a hit before doing anything. To make matters worse, while its Razor Leaf destroys threats weak to it, it doesn't do enough damage to save it against neutral targets like Nidoqueen, and it struggles to deal notable damage to Grass-resistant Pokemon like Rapidash, Pinsir, Gastly, and Fearow.</p> <p>Weepinbell also has heavy competition from other status spreaders. Drowzee may be slower, but its Thunder Wave is more reliable and its Psychic-typing grants it both a better offensive and defensive presence. While Vileplume is even less offensively threatening than Weepinbell, its enormous bulk lets it spread status more effectively.

      "overview": "<p>Victreebel got lucky in RBY OU. It lacks obvious strengths, having just decent offensive capabilities, mediocre bulk, and a lousy typing. However, Victreebel has several useful tools that allow it to exploit certain metagame trends. Thanks to its average Speed and access to Wrap and Sleep Powder, Victreebel is able to keep itself safe while bullying the tier's slowest staples, like Exeggutor, Chansey, and Snorlax. Likewise, anything paralyzed is liable to fall victim to Victreebel's repetitive Wraps. Victreebel also has a powerful Razor Leaf that can deal hefty damage to several key Pokemon, like Starmie, Slowbro, Lapras, and Rhydon, the last of which it will always OHKO. Victreebel has plenty of other toys to play with as well, such as Stun Spore and Swords Dance. These traits make Victreebel a menace against slower teams and teams that have mismanaged paralysis. It is undoubtedly one of the best Pokemon for closing games against weakened teams.</p> <p>Victreebel, however, has numerous flaws that have reduced it to more of a niche threat than a tier staple in recent times. In the modern metagame, teams are typically much faster than they were in the past and leads like Starmie, Alakazam, and Jynx are more inclined to switch early on and dodge paralysis. While Chansey is very likely to become paralyzed over the course of the game, Victreebel may find it difficult to pressure anything else, and its mere presence is often an invitation for fast Psychic-type Pokemon. Additionally, the slight decrease in Exeggutor usage has been to Victreebel's detriment. Although the two compete as sleepers, Exeggutor's reduced role in the metagame has contributed to faster teams and reduced the presence of a prime Pokemon Victreebel can dominate with Sleep Powder or Wrap. Other more general issues include Victreebel's horrendous weaknesses to Ice and Psychic, vulnerability to paralysis, inability to threaten Gengar, and poor consistency, due to the imperfect accuracy of virtually every move it uses, most notably Wrap. Finally, while its defensive stats are somewhat workable, its mediocre Speed, poor typing, and lack of recovery make it deceptively frail; Tauros will typically KO Victreebel with a Blizzard followed by a Hyper Beam, for example.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Body Slam is Victreebel’s most notable alternative option for either set. The decent Base Power and paralysis chance allow Victreebel to punish switch-ins without committing to moves like Stun Spore and Sleep Powder, which can potentially be blocked by a statused Pokemon or just miss. However, the middling payoff and rather high value of Victreebel’s moveslots make it a rare sight. Double-Edge can potentially be run on the Swords Dance set for additional power without risking a Hyper Beam recharge turn, but it is generally outclassed by the utility moves that give Victreebel its niche. Toxic is another possible option on the standard set because it pairs well with Wrap, causing damage to accumulate much more quickly. Once again, however, Victreebel seldom has room to run a move like this.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Victreebel is incapacitated by paralysis. With all of its healthy foes faster than it, Victreebel will no longer be able to use Wrap to pressure slower targets and pivot. Additionally, Wrap will hit only a mere 66% of the time once Victreebel is paralyzed, making it an inconsistent option even against paralyzed targets. Likewise, the imperfect accuracies of Razor Leaf, Hyper Beam, Sleep Powder, and Stun Spore are exacerbated by the chance for full paralysis. Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie will typically try to use Thunder Wave to dispatch Victreebel as fast as possible, and slower Pokemon like Chansey and Exeggutor will be happy to punish any Wrap misses with Thunder Wave and Stun Spore, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Gengar: Gengar is a hard counter to Victreebel. Aside from status moves, Victreebel is incapable of threatening Gengar at all, as it takes no damage from Wrap or Hyper Beam and very little from Razor Leaf. Gengar, on the other hand, can put Victreebel to sleep or quickly KO it with Night Shade or the occasional Psychic. Wrap still immobilizes Gengar despite not doing any damage, allowing Victreebel to pivot to a teammate, so Gengar can’t switch in entirely for free.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Flying-type Pokemon tend to be strong answers to Victreebel. Zapdos is by far the most common and can easily dispatch Victreebel with Thunder Wave or 2HKO it with Drill Peck. Unless Victreebel is partnered with Rhydon or Golem, Zapdos is very likely to claim a KO if it gets the chance to face Victreebel. Articuno and Moltres also outspeed and can 2HKO Victreebel with Blizzard and Fire Blast, respectively. All three Pokemon also have impressive bulk, so they can survive even a +2 Hyper Beam if necessary. Dragonite is also a rather sturdy check, as it shrugs off most of Victreebel’s moves and can inhibit it with Thunder Wave or its own Wrap.</p> <p><strong>Psychic and Ice-type Moves: Psychic and Ice-type moves deal hefty damage to Victreebel, typically scoring a 2HKO. Alakazam, Starmie, and Jynx all outspeed Victreebel and can 2HKO it with Psychic or Blizzard. Slower Pokemon can also harshly punish misses and poor switches from Victreebel. Exeggutor and Lapras both score 2HKOs with their super effective STAB moves, though the latter takes a lot from Razor Leaf. Chansey can also get a 3HKO with Ice Beam. Cloyster is an incredibly awkward matchup, as the two Speed tie and 2HKO each other with their STAB moves, with Victreebel potentially getting the KO outright if Cloyster has sustained even the slightest chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Victreebel has difficulty threatening Pokemon faster than it, as it typically cannot stay in and use Wrap safely. Essentially every common Pokemon faster than Victreebel has the potential to simply wait out Victreebel’s Wrap turns, provided it doesn't switch out, and eventually punish it with a super effective attack or paralysis. Victreebel can typically weaken these Pokemon before going down, such as hitting Starmie with Razor Leaf or Tauros with Stun Spore, but these matchup are generally losing for Victreebel overall.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Thanks to its middling Speed, Victreebel can threaten about half of the tier with Sleep Powder. In general, Victreebel is most effective as a sleeper when it can get in against a slower foe with minimal risk. For example, when Chansey is likely to use Soft-Boiled or Snorlax is about to wake up from Rest, Victreebel can usually sneak in and use Sleep Powder. Likewise, if a Pokemon such as Exeggutor or Slowbro is likely to come in, Victreebel can usually find an entry point. From there, Victreebel can pivot with Wrap or pressure slower Pokemon like Snorlax with Razor Leaf and Wrap. While going for sleep early on is a viable strategy, Victreebel frequently shines late-game, as revealing it too early may make paralyzing some of your opponent's faster Pokemon more difficult. Therefore, Sleep Powder is often an endgame tool that it can use to threaten Tauros and other common endgame Pokemon. Wrap makes Victreebel a capable pivot and occasional sweeper; it can use the move to quickly get its teammates great matchups with little risk. For example, using Wrap against Chansey can provide entrance for Snorlax and using it against Exeggutor can provide entrance for Cloyster. Faster Pokemon are also vulnerable; if a foe like Alakazam, Starmie, or Zapdos tries to switch into Wrap and threaten paralysis, then a teammate like Snorlax, Jolteon, or Rhydon can come in for free. Finally, if the opposing team is made entirely slower than Victreebel, either by KOing or paralyzing every faster Pokemon, Victreebel can gradually chip away the team's health with Wrap until it can pick foes off with its attacks or swap out to a sweeper like Tauros to finish the job. Razor Leaf is Victreebel's strongest STAB move and primary attacking move. Water- and Rock-type Pokemon typically fold after just a hit or two, allowing Victreebel to reliably force switches when facing Pokemon like paralyzed Starmie, paralyzed or Resting Cloyster, Slowbro, and Rhydon. In the case of Slowbro, Razor Leaf's near-guaranteed critical hit enables Victreebel to deal hefty damage regardless of how many times it has used Amnesia. Victreebel's ability to pressure both Starmie and Rhydon is fairly unique and one of the key traits that allowed it to rise to OU. Victreebel's last move is its least important and most flexible. Stun Spore improves Victreebel's utility with Wrap and gives it the ability to pressure faster Pokemon even after Sleep Clause has taken effect. This is especially potent when the opponent's only Pokemon faster than Victreebel is Tauros. Hyper Beam makes Victreebel a more effective sweeper in late-game scenarios, picking up early KOs on Pokemon like Chansey and Alakazam.</p> <p>Depending on how Victreebel is played, it has a number of strong potential teammates. Starmie and Rhydon are typical partners, as they create a potent offensive core. Starmie can stymie Pokemon that threaten Victreebel like Alakazam, Jynx, Cloyster, and Articuno, while Victreebel can take advantage of Starmie’s ability to spread paralysis by using Wrap and applying pressure to Starmie’s strongest check, Chansey. Rhydon rounds out the core by handling Electric-type Pokemon, particularly Zapdos, which heavily threaten both Starmie and Victreebel. Rhydon also benefits from paralysis spread by these allies. Electric-type Pokemon also tend to work well with Victreebel on offensive teams, as Wrap can be a valuable tool for allowing them to switch in safely; Zapdos and Jolteon are quite good at finishing off a team that has been chipped by Wrap. Victreebel can also punish the switches to Rhydon or Golem that Electric-type Pokemon tend to encourage. Victreebel is also a fixture of Wrap teams. While a less common strategy in competitive play, Victreebel can be paired with Pokemon such as Cloyster and Dragonite to easily maintain momentum and annihilate paralyzed teams. Due to the many free switches generated by Wrap, such teams often feature multiple fast offensive Pokemon such as Tauros, Zapdos, Jolteon, and Alakazam.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>While Victreebel often gets the most value from a utility set based around pivoting and spreading status, it can make use of a Swords Dance set. Victreebel boasts an above-average Attack stat and can secure many important KOs after a Swords Dance. Frailer Pokemon such as Alakazam and Jynx drop to a single +2 Hyper Beam and Chansey will drop from full health about 17.9% of the time. Thanks to its decent Speed tier, Victreebel can severely weaken or outright sweep a team with Swords Dance after only a little chip damage and paralysis. Razor Leaf complements Hyper Beam quite well, as it threatens many of the most physically bulky Pokemon in the tier, such as Rhydon, Cloyster, and Slowbro. The final move on the set largely comes down to team structure and personal preference. Wrap remains useful as a pseudo-pivot move and can help Victreebel get a little more chip damage on a Pokemon to bring it into range of Hyper Beam or Razor Leaf. Sleep Powder helps Victreebel find turns to set up with Swords Dance and punish Pokemon that might be brought in to stop a sweep, like Tauros or Electric-type Pokemon. Stun Spore acts similarly, heavily punishing common late-game switch-ins. While paralysis is generally weaker than sleep, Stun Spore has a case over Sleep Powder, as it is not inhibited by Sleep Clause and can be used at any point in the match. Moreover, because Victreebel is often best at switching in and setting up on Pokemon that are already asleep, Sleep Powder may be redundant.</p> <p>While Victreebel can succeed with this set, it has several notable limitations. Victreebel’s poor typing, underwhelming bulk, and vulnerability to paralysis make setting up quite difficult, forcing Victreebel to rely on free turns from sleep and risky double switches. Victreebel needs a lot of support to not only set up with Swords Dance, but also to weaken the opposing team enough that Victreebel can do real damage. This generally means all Psychic-type Pokemon on the opposing team need to be paralyzed and hard walls like Gengar need to be eliminated. Finally, while Victreebel is arguably the best user of Swords Dance in the tier, it is not necessarily the best fit for every team. Pokemon like Sandslash, Kingler, Venusaur, Pinsir, and Kabutops all offer a variety of positive traits and give Victreebel pretty stiff competition for an already niche role.</p> "

    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Tentacruel is unquestionably the defining threat of RBY UU, shaping every facet of the tier and dictating the viability of many Pokemon. Access to Wrap combined with its incredible base 100 Speed gives it nigh-unmatched utility in nearly every game. Tentacruel's Wrap shapes the identity of RBY UU, defining offensive and defensive play in the tier. Wrap wears down foes and gains momentum by pivoting while they're immobilized, and Tentacruel's many strengths accentuate these positives. Its high Speed and Wrap give it the advantage in most one-on-one interactions: against any slower foe, Tentacruel can just use Wrap and switch as the move expires, giving its team free chip damage and a free switch. This strategy has no good short-term counterplay: switching a faster Pokemon or Haunter into Wrap won't let it punish Tentacruel, making it very hard to punish and gain momentum against Tentacruel. Tentacruel also easily switches in on the tier's many Surfs and Blizzards from threats like Vaporeon, Dewgong, and Articuno. With all these switch-in chances, Tentacruel gets on the field often, and since most Pokemon are slower and thus completely shut down by Wrap, Tentacruel is hard to force out too. This longevity and pressure is made even more potent if Tentacruel chooses to run Rest to stick around even longer and avoid getting worn down. All this field presence, chip damage, momentum, and safe pivoting for offensive teammates lets Tentacruel immensely pressure defensive Pokemon. Finally, not only does Wrap prevent defensive Pokemon from healing during its duration, but Tentacruel can run Swords Dance to emphasize this pressure even more.</p> <p>Tentacruel's many positive attributes support its Wrap, but they also have their own critical applications. With its base 120 Special, which is tied for the second-highest in the tier, STAB Surf or Hydro Pump, and good coverage with Blizzard, Tentacruel is an offensive behemoth. Its STAB moves deal significant damage to Kangaskhan, Omastar, Haunter, and Kadabra, while Blizzard hits Dodrio, Dragonite, Venusaur, Victreebel, and Tangela hard, if it doesn't just OHKO them outright. This wide coverage with Tentacruel's high Speed allows it to act as a revenge killer, a sweeper, and a wallbreaker. If it chooses to run Swords Dance, Tentacruel becomes a nigh-unwallable late-game sweeper, demolishing slower teams with Wrap, Hyper Beam, and Surf with near impunity. Meanwhile, with Rest and the fantastic Water typing, Tentacruel becomes a key defensive piece. It checks Articuno, one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the tier, and answers the myriad of Surfs and Blizzards from the tier's many Water-types, such as Vaporeon, Gyarados, Omastar, Dewgong, and itself, giving it a defensive niche as well as an entry opportunity. Further, all the above niches and Wrap synergize with each other. Wrap chip damage bolsters Tentacruel's offensive pressure, and whenever Tentacruel comes in to exploit a positive offensive or defensive matchup, it gains another chance to use Wrap.</p> <p>Despite all these positives, Tentacruel does have some very notable flaws. Its Poison typing, while making it immune to Toxic, gives it a glaring weakness to Psychic and Earthquake. These weaknesses make it hard to switch Tentacruel into Pokemon like Hypno and Kangaskhan, and they prevent it from staying in against Kadabra and Dugtrio, both of which outspeed Tentacruel and heavily damage it with their STAB moves. Another notable weakness of Tentacruel is its physical frailty, which can allow threats such as Persian and Aerodactyl to force Tentacruel out as well. Tentacruel is also severely crippled by paralysis, as the Speed drop and chance for full paralysis mid-Wrap heavily impact its utility. Lastly, Tentacruel's reliance on Rest to heal itself can be heavily punished by Psychic-types such as Kadabra and Hypno, Electric-types such as Raichu and Electabuzz, and physical attackers such as Kangaskhan, Dodrio, Persian, and Dugtrio. However, even with these flaws, Tentacruel is the tier's apex predator, with its utility and power making it a mandatory pick for competitive teams.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Tentacruel has a variety of other options, they are generally discouraged due to them either being very situational or making Tentacruel less consistent, which many team compositions cannot afford. Hydro Pump's increased power can be very appealing, as it achieves a guaranteed 3HKO on Hypno, a near-guaranteed 3HKO on Articuno, a guaranteed 2HKO on Persian, and a 2HKO against Kadabra 49.8% of the time; however, the worse accuracy and PP are very noticeable in prolonged games and make Tentacruel a much less consistent threat.</p> <p>Hyper Beam can be a nice option on the Wrap Pivot set, allowing Tentacruel to pick off opposing Kadabra switching into it at 60% health, as well as hitting opposing Tentacruel for around 33% and opposing Dewgong and Vaporeon for roughly 27%. All of the latter three can be tough for Tentacruel to break past on its own. However, outside of those damage rolls, Hyper Beam doesn’t do that much for Tentacruel, making it hard to justify running over one of its standard moves.</p> <p>Ice Beam grants Tentacruel more PP for freeze wars, increasing its chances of winning them. However, its drop in damage output from Blizzard is drastic, notably failing to OHKO Dragonite. Barrier can make Tentacruel take less damage from the wide array of physical moves, dodging the 2HKO from Kangaskhan's and Dugtrio's Earthquakes and allowing it to win those matchups; however, Barrier fails to assist it against Persian, which can ignore it with Slash and is one of the most popular physical attackers in the tier. Bubble Beam's 33.2% chance to drop Speed can come in handy against opposing Tentacruel and Persian, but in the vast majority of cases, Surf's higher damage is preferred. Mega Drain can be nice to hit Omastar or Golem with, as it allows Tentacruel to gain a significant amount of health back, but it otherwise has middling damage and hurts other matchups more than it helps.</p> <p>On the Swords Dance set, Tentacruel can opt to run Blizzard over Surf to guarantee an OHKO on Dragonite and deal more damage to Grass-types, but this comes at the cost of a guaranteed OHKO on Dugtrio and a probable 2HKO on Persian and Kangaskhan, damage rolls that are often too valuable for Swords Dance Tentacruel to pass up on.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fast Paralysis Inducers: Any paralysis inducer that outspeeds Tentacruel, such as Kadabra, Raichu, Electabuzz, or the rare Electrode, can be a very pressing issue for it. The chance of full paralysis leaves Tentacruel with a 63.57% chance to connect Wrap, sharply harming its pivoting and sweeping. The Speed drop further hinders its pivoting and leaves it vulnerable to slower threats like Hypno and Gyarados. Kadabra and Electabuzz, which avoid a 2HKO from Surf, can switch into Tentacruel directly and threaten it with Thunder Wave. They can create significant momentum if they switch into Tentacruel as Wrap misses. Even if Wrap hits, they can wait out the Wrap turns and threaten 2HKOs with their STAB moves. That being said, all these checks fear a critical hit Surf, which will deal at least 70%, letting another attack or a teammate KO them. Kadabra mitigates that risk with Recover, but using Recover lets its checks such as Hypno switch in. You can reduce the threat of Surf by switching a Water-resistant Pokemon into Tentacruel first, baiting it to lock into Wrap. This creates a switch-in opportunity for paralysis inducers, which can wait out the Wrap turns and threaten to cripple or break through Tentacruel.</p> <p><strong>Haunter: Haunter has enough bulk to avoid a 2HKO from Tentacruel's attacks and won't take chip damage from Wrap, although it is still immobilized. Due to its strong Thunderbolt, Haunter can force Tentacruel out and make it waste Wrap PP, usually winning the matchup when Tentacruel is below 73%, as Thunderbolt will 2HKO Tentacruel from there. However, if Haunter has already been damaged, it may be forced to use Explosion instead. It should be noted that a Thunderbolt and subsequent Explosion from Haunter usually, but not always, will KO Tentacruel from full health. Critical hits from Surf can deal severe damage to Haunter, in addition, likely forcing it to use Explosion regardless of Tentacruel's health.</p> <p><strong>Fast Physical Attackers</strong>: Fast physical attackers such as Dugtrio, Persian, and Dodrio are all reliable checks to Tentacruel, beating or matching its Speed and exploiting its mediocre physical bulk to KO it from very high health. Dugtrio can 2HKO Tentacruel with Earthquake, but its fragility makes Surf a guaranteed OHKO, so Dugtrio is limited to a revenge killing role. Tentacruel is pressured to stay at 80% HP or more, out of Earthquake's OHKO range, but this is a tall order in many situations. Dugtrio's Speed and strong Earthquake also let it halt the Wrap momentum of a chipped Tentacruel, coming in on Wrap and waiting it out before KOing the Tentacruel with Earthquake; however, this is usually a last resort option, as many common threats can heavily punish Dugtrio's frailty if they are reasonably healthy. Persian can threaten a reliable 2HKO with Slash against a Tentacruel at 90% or below. Unlike Dugtrio, however, Persian has enough bulk to survive a Surf—and fairly often two—making it more flexible than Dugtrio in threatening and/or chipping Tentacruel without getting KOed. While both Dodrio and Aerodactyl are reliably 2HKOed by Tentacruel's Surf and Blizzard, they both match or exceed Tentacruel’s Speed and can significantly damage it with Hyper Beam, allowing them to consistently threaten a KO against a a sufficiently weakened Tentacruel below 62% while at high health. Dodrio significantly improve the matchup if it manages to paralyze Tentacruel with a Body Slam or use Agility before Tentacruel comes onto the field, as a Body Slam followed by a Hyper Beam is guaranteed to KO Tentacruel.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Without Swords Dance, Tentacruel often struggles to break through opposing Water-types, such as Vaporeon, Gyarados, Dewgong, or opposing Tentacruel, on its own. It has to rely on landing multiple Wraps in a row to feasibly break through them or get a lucky freeze from Blizzard, which won't even work for Dewgong, all while risking getting paralyzed by Body Slam, frozen by Blizzard, or eating a strong Thunderbolt or Hyper Beam from Gyarados.</p> <p><strong>Tangela, Victreebel, and Dragonite</strong>: While neither switch into Tentacruel's Surf very well, when at high health, Tangela, Victreebel, and Dragonite, can be difficult for Tentacruel to break past with their good special bulk. Tentacruel has to land multiple Wraps in a row to break past these three, while they are able to cripple it immediately with Stun Spore or Thunder Wave if it misses. While Tentacruel outspeeds them and 2HKOes and OHKOes them with Blizzard, respectively, both of these Pokemon are very good at luring in Tentacruel and paralyzing it as it switches in, which can cripple Tentacruel for the rest of the game. In addition, because these two Pokemon are slower than Tentacruel, they can act after it wakes up from Rest, paralyzing it before it can retaliate and then pivoting to a more aggressive teammate with Bind or Wrap.</p> ",

          "name": "Wrap Pivot",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This is Tentacruel's defining set, capable of extracting nigh-unmatched amounts of value at every stage of the game. With its strong Blizzard and STAB Surf, Tentacruel is a consistent offensive threat, capable of 2HKOing Kangaskhan, Tangela, Venusaur, Dodrio, and Persian while OHKOing Aerodactyl, Dugtrio, and Dragonite. Even specially bulky targets like Hypno and Articuno lose roughly 30% of their health to Surf, possibly forcing an early Rest from Hypno—which a teammate like Kangaskhan, Dugtrio, Dodrio, Persian, or Dragonite can exploit—or chipping Articuno enough to stop it from sweeping. Tentacruel's fast Wrap accentuates this damage, allowing it to immobilize and chip away at slower targets, preventing them from retaliating or healing any damage they may have incurred. Additionally, Wrap allows even more offensively-threatening teammates, such as Dugtrio, Articuno, Persian, and Kangaskhan, a safe entry point to exploit the damage dealt by Tentacruel. Tentacruel's last move is Rest for two main reasons; firstly, Rest gives it general longevity in the face of damage and status, allowing it to remain an active presence throughout the game. Secondly, by running Rest, Tentacruel can better leverage its respectable special bulk and resistances to Water and Ice, switching into the likes of Articuno, Vaporeon, Omastar, and opposing Tentacruel throughout a game. The improved matchup against opposing Tentacruel is especially important in end-games, as a Tentacruel without Rest is typically at a significant disadvantage in the mirror matchup, as is the improved matchup against Articuno, since it can be very difficult to check Articuno if you do not have Rest on Tentacruel or a secondary Water-type that can handle Articuno, such as Dewgong, Omastar, or Vaporeon.</p> <p>Tentacruel is a very versatile and flexible Pokemon; it can be an offensive weapon and revenge killer with its Speed and consistent damage output, a defensive piece with its respectable special bulk, resistances, and Rest, and it can be a pivot with Wrap to bring in its teammates. Getting Tentacruel onto the field safely as often as possible is vital to making the most of it, as is properly identifying whether using Wrap to chip foes and pivot is worth risking a miss, or if Tentacruel should fire off strong Surfs and Blizzards to break down the opposing team's defensive core instead. However, you have to balance this pivoting and offense with keeping Tentacruel healthy as an answer to Articuno and Water-types such as Vaporeon, Dewgong, and opposing Tentacruel as well. Flying- and Grass-types switching in to answer Dugtrio are two great opportunities to bring Tentacruel into play, as Tentacruel threatens to OHKO or 2HKO many of them with Blizzard. Another good entry opportunity is while opposing slow wallbreakers, such as Kangaskhan and Articuno, switch into a Hypno or Vaporeon asleep from Rest, as Tentacruel can regain momentum with Wrap before they can retaliate. Tentacruel can also make good use of sleeping foes, such as Hypno and Omastar, attempting to burn sleep turns, as it can deal significant damage with Surf while they are asleep before starting Wrap as they wake up, preventing them from retaliating or healing off damage sustained during Rest.</p> <p>Given how versatile a threat Tentacruel is, it synergizes very well with many common threats in the tier. Sweepers and wallbreakers like Dugtrio, Kangaskhan, Gyarados, and Persian enjoy Tentacruel's Wrap allowing them to switch in safely, preserving their health and avoiding getting paralyzed by Thunder Wave, which in turn lets them come in later for another round of attacks. In return, they threaten to 2HKO common Tentacruel answers like Kadabra and Electabuzz. Dugtrio is particularly noteworthy, as it is immune to Thunder Wave intended to cripple Tentacruel, punishing the opposition heavily for trying with its STAB Earthquake, good coverage in Rock Slide and Slash, threat of Substitute catching a switch from the opponent, and high critical hit rate. One especially good place to pivot Dugtrio in with Wrap is against opposing Tentacruel, as it can KO Tentacruel extremely early with Earthquake. In return, Tentacruel outspeeds and threatens common Dugtrio answers like Tangela, Venusaur, Dragonite, and Kangaskhan, with Wrap immobilizing them and wearing them down into Surf or Blizzard range. Hypno is another fantastic teammate for Tentacruel, coming into common Tentacruel answers like Kadabra and Electabuzz and forcing them to switch out, lest they get paralyzed by Thunder Wave or put to sleep by Hypnosis. Either status makes them easy pickings for slower physical attackers like Kangaskhan, Gyarados, and Dragonite, as well as prevents them from checking Tentacruel thereafter. Hypno, when healthy, also can soft check other common Tentacruel answers like Persian and Aerodactyl with its strong Psychic and Thunder Wave. In exchange, Hypno benefits immensely from Tentacruel's ability to answer Pokemon that heavily punish a resting Hypno, such as Kangaskhan, Gyarados, Venusaur, Tangela, and Dragonite. Furthermore, Tentacruel's fast Wrap benefits Hypno immensely by baiting in Pokemon that Hypno checks, such as Electabuzz and Kadabra, before, crucially, letting Hypno switch into them without taking chip damage or paralysis on the way in.</p> <p>Bulky Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Gyarados, Vaporeon, Dragonite, and Dewgong also make for effective Tentacruel teammates. While healthy, they can switch into some of Tentacruel's common checks such as Persian and Dugtrio, ideally while they are immobilized by Tentacruel's Wrap, and threaten the opposing team with strong attacks and the threat of paralysis from either Body Slam or Thunder Wave in the case of Dragonite. They are also very adept at exploiting sleeping Rest users, such as Hypno, Vaporeon, Omastar, and Dewgong, that switch into Wrap to burn sleep turns while taking relatively little damage from Tentacruel's Wrap. Dewgong also grants the Tentacruel user an additional Articuno counter, as do Omastar and Vaporeon, which allows Tentacruel to play more aggressively without as much risk of Articuno getting out of hand. Dewgong further has a freeze immunity, which allows Tentacruel to avoid taking as many Blizzards from an opposing Tentacruel and reduces the chances that it gets frozen. Tangela, Victreebel, and Venusaur also make for very effective Tentacruel partners, as, while healthy, they answer Dugtrio, Persian, and Electabuzz, using the entry point to land a crippling Sleep Powder before providing additional value with their other utility moves. Meanwhile, Tentacruel acts as a decent answer to any Flying-types, such as Articuno, Dragonite, and Gyarados, that try to exploit Tangela, Victreebel, and Venusaur's lack of coverage moves.</p> <p>Lastly, Flying-type teammates such as the aforementioned Gyarados and Dragonite, but also Aerodactyl, Articuno, and Dodrio, can benefit Tentacruel by checking Dugtrio with their immunity to Earthquake and strong attacks. Gyarados and Dragonite can switch into Dugtrio's Rock Slide two times, barring an untimely critical hit, before Dugtrio can threaten to 2HKO them as they switch in. Aerodactyl and Dodrio are less sturdy answers to Dugtrio, only taking a single Rock Slide before Dugtrio can 2HKO them; however, they can threaten Kadabra fairly well when it is chipped. Aerodactyl's high Speed stat is particularly noteworthy because, excluding the uncommon Electrode, it is the only Pokemon that can reliably revenge kill an unparalyzed Dugtrio without taking an attack in the process. Its Normal resistance is also useful when facing Dugtrio, as Dugtrio commonly uses Slash as an early-game midground option when scouting its opponent's team, and Aerodactyl takes Slash very comfortably. Articuno is unable to switch into Dugtrio's Rock Slide safely at all, being 2HKOed from full health by it, but, when above 58% health, it can force Dugtrio to switch out with its Blizzard if it can come in safely—such as on an Earthquake or from Tentacruel's Wrap—and if Dugtrio is not behind a Substitute.</p> <p>Tentacruel’s good Speed tier and access to Wrap make it a common lead in RBY UU, outspeeding and locking down any slower lead, including Hypno, Haunter, and Venusaur. Wrap allows a safe pivot to a teammate to capitalize on the immobilized lead, or any teammates that the opposing player switches to, whenever the Tentacruel user dictates. For example, if your opponent switches to Clefable or Hypno and attempts to PP stall Wrap or fish for a miss to paralyze Tentacruel, you can pivot to a teammate such as Venusaur or Haunter and put a foe to sleep. As another example, if your opponent leads Haunter and stays in to fish for a Wrap miss and put Tentacruel to sleep with Hypnosis, you can go to Dugtrio and threaten to OHKO Haunter with Earthquake. This ability to pivot with Wrap puts the Tentacruel user at a significant advantage, as they have the initiative and control the pace of the game, which allows them to pick the best moment to switch while chipping down the opposing team. This advantage creates an intricate mind game. Opponents commonly respond to this advantage by switching to a Pokemon with paralysis that outspeeds or Speed ties Tentacruel such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, or Electrode. These paralysis users pressure Tentacruel to quickly switch to a teammate, usually Hypno but possibly Dugtrio, before Wrap ends and the foe regains the initiative by freely threatening Tentacruel. If it hasn't started Wrap yet, Tentacruel may even hard switch instead of Wrap pivoting to avoid the risk of a Wrap miss. If Tentacruel hard switches, though, the opponent may predict this and, instead of bringing in a paralysis user, bring in their own Tentacruel to handle the incoming Hypno or Dugtrio. With the other Tentacruel possibly in play, the above mind game starts again. The original Tentacruel user may predict the opponent bringing in their opposing Tentacruel, causing the original user to bring in their own paralysis inducer, but the opponent may respond with their own Hypno or Dugtrio to beat the paralysis user, and so on.</p> <p>When facing fast paralysis-inducing leads, such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Electrode, Tentacruel will be forced to switch to a teammate to avoid getting paralyzed, thereby giving the opposing player a chance to paralyze some Pokemon with Thunder Wave or predict the switch and bring in a sleep inducer such as Haunter or Venusaur. Note that the same pressure to switch and cede initiative occurs if Tentacruel misses a Wrap against the fast paralysis inducer as it switches in, or if Wrap connects but the Tentacruel doesn't switch out before it ends. Against opposing Tentacruel leads, Tentacruel can go for a freeze with Blizzard while dealing some minor chip damage, use Surf to maximize chip damage to more quickly bring the opposing Tentacruel into KO range for Dugtrio or Persian, or use Wrap and pivot into a fast paralysis-inducing teammate. While Tentacruel is likely to win the matchup against lead Dodrio by using Blizzard, it only wins while avoiding paralysis about half the time, and it is almost always significantly weakened from the interaction, which can be very costly given how valuable Tentacruel is. It is better to switch to another teammate that checks Dodrio, such as Omastar or Aerodactyl. The matchup against Persian is similar; Tentacruel is statistically more likely to win the one-on-one but will be significantly weakened in the process, which is undesirable in many circumstances. When leading with Tentacruel, it can be beneficial to have a second Water-type in the back, ensuring you can take opposing Water- and Ice-type attacks in case Tentacruel gets chipped or compromised by status early on.</p> "

        {
          "name": "Swords Dance",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Swords Dance Tentacruel is a surprising and effective late-game sweeper that can effectively break past bulkier Pokemon that expect to comfortably check it. These include Vaporeon, Hypno, and opposing Tentacruel, with Swords Dance Tentacruel punishing them using Rest especially hard. This Tentacruel set also can be a mid-game pivot, but since it cannot afford to run Rest, a Wrap miss is often devastating, making mid-game pivoting risky. After one Swords Dance, Tentacruel's Wrap deals around 6% per turn to bulky targets such as Hypno, Gyarados, Kangaskhan, and Vaporeon, transforming from a pivoting move that deals chip damage to a potent wallbreaking tool that completely decimates paralyzed teams. Boosted Wrap quickly wears foes down into KO range of either Surf or Tentacruel's boosted Hyper Beam, which are reliable KO options against slower and bulkier Pokemon once they are slightly below half health, while leaving them unable to retaliate. This process normally forces the opponent to rely on Pokemon that outspeed Tentacruel to force it out, such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Persian. However, none of these Pokemon can reliably switch into Tentacruel, as Tentacruel's boosted Hyper Beam can KO all of them after only a small amount of chip damage, or, in the case of Kadabra, no chip damage at all. When using Swords Dance to attempt a sweep, ensure that Tentacruel sets up against targets that are unable to status it or significantly harm it, such as sleeping targets looking to burn some sleep turns against Wrap, slower Pokemon looking to use a recovery move, or opposing Tentacruel looking to get a lucky freeze with Blizzard;&amp;mdashthis mirror interaction is especially noteworthy in end-game positions, where Swords Dance Tentacruel dominates if it is reasonably healthy. It is important to recognize that these setup opportunities stem from opponents expecting Tentacruel to run its standard, less offensive set; take advantage whenever opponents make that wrong prediction and think they can tolerate being passive towards Tentacruel. Due to this set's increased vulnerability to status, it can be more difficult to bring in than the standard Wrap pivot set, often relying on resisted attacks, teammate Wrappers like Dragonite, and good double switching to come onto the field safely. Another notable, albeit uncommon, way of utilizing Swords Dance Tentacruel is as a mid-game wallbreaker, boosting its Attack against an opposing Tentacruel or Vaporeon that's burning Rest sleep turns to punch a large hole in the opposing team.</p> <p>Swords Dance Tentacruel can be a challenging sweeper to use, often relying on its teammates to force the opponent into positions where it can safely use Swords Dance, as well as needing them to paralyze or KO any Pokemon that could stop its sweep. As mentioned before, sleeping Pokemon looking to burn a turn or two of sleep make excellent setup fodder; hence, Swords Dance Tentacruel pairs well with sleep inducers such as Haunter, Hypno, Venusaur, Victreebel, and Tangela. These five Pokemon also have defensive utility against foes that may stop Tentacruel's sweep as well, with Haunter walling opposing Persian, Venusaur, Victreebel, Tangela checking opposing Dugtrio, Raichu, Electabuzz, and Persian, Hypno crippling Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Persian with Thunder Wave—allowing Tentacruel to sweep with Swords Dance-boosted Wrap unopposed. Seismic Toss Hypno is also an effective teammate for Swords Dance Tentacruel, as it can reliably force an opposing Hypno to use Rest, most commonly at around half health, which gifts Tentacruel an excellent opportunity to switch in and use Swords Dance. Dugtrio and Persian are two excellent teammates for Swords Dance Tentacruel, as they can exploit opposing Kadabra, Electabuzz, and Raichu attempting to stop Tentacruel's sweep, as well as clean up any remaining foes after Swords Dance Tentacruel's assault. Kangaskhan and Dragonite are two more solid partners for Swords Dance Tentacruel that can paralyze or KO Persian and Kadabra attempting to check Tentacruel. Another issue teams with this set often face is dealing with Articuno and opposing Tentacruel, as Swords Dance Tentacruel cannot reliably switch into them throughout the match due to its lack of Rest. Teammates such as Vaporeon, Omastar, and Dewgong can switch into Articuno and Tentacruel throughout the game.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Tumbling down from its peak as an OU staple, Golem finds a solid role in NU as one of the bulkiest and hardest-hitting attackers. QuakeSlide coming off an incredible base 110 Attack threatens the entire tier, deters omnipresent threats like Charizard, Mr. Mime, and Venomoth, and makes Golem painful to switch into, even for bulky checks like Blastoise. In fact, Golem outright OHKOes both Charizard and Moltres, a feat no other Pokemon can manage without a critical hit. Explosion makes it a persistent threat, as even checks like Blastoise and Clefable barely survive it. Perhaps even more notable is its defensive profile—Electric immunity grants it opportunities to switch in against Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Electrode, while its Rock typing allows it to catch careless foes using Hyper Beam and retaliate for massive damage. Its absurd base 130 Defense lets it shrug off Charizard's Earthquake before rocking its world in return; even a +4 Earthquake fails to OHKO Golem, letting it stonewall even the most unstoppable sweep. Even better is the Electrode matchup—Golem fully invalidates it.</p> <p>Golem's 4x Water weakness erodes its formidable defenses, though, as every single Water-type in the tier outspeeds and OHKOes it. Its poor Speed makes it difficult to use against most unparalyzed foes—if it takes a critical hit on entry from Mr. Mime or Charizard, it is almost certainly doomed. Coverage moves from Clefable, Raticate, and Nidoking 2HKO it, limiting its chances to switch in. One would think Golem could at least switch into Fire-types safely, but a burn reduces Rock Slide to an avalanche of pebbles; worse yet, Swords Dance reapplies the Attack drop, granting Charizard free setup. This rocky matchup spread limits Golem to mostly switching into Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Golem lacks viable options outside of the above set. Toxic can prevent opposing Fire Spin users from chipping it down, but Golem already OHKOes the most relevant ones should they miss a single time. Fire Blast 2HKOes Exeggcute but has very little utility otherwise. Counter is an extremely niche option; Golem can use this to OHKO Raticate if it uses Super Fang, but this plan is extremely dangerous, since Raticate is likely to have Bubble Beam. Golem can also come in after Charizard KOes its ally with a Normal-type attack, using Counter as Charizard switches out, but this is only notable when using Counter against a critical hit—primarily from Slash—or a +2 Hyper Beam.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Every single Water-type outspeeds and OHKOes Golem. Golem's only recourse is to paralyze them with Body Slam as they switch in or wear them down; none of them can repeatedly switch into its powerful Earthquake, and paralyzed Water-types lose after a little chip damage, since Earthquake can 2HKO them from about 70%. Kabutops is a worse check than the other Water-types and is unable to switch into Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Burn: A burned Golem is almost worse than useless; opposing Swords Dance users can reapply its burn while setting up, and it becomes easy to switch into even for frail foes. In particular, Charizard exploits it heavily, setting up a game-ending sweep against the hapless boulder. Moltres can similarly use Agility to reduce Rock Slide to a paltry 25% damage, then retaliate with Fire Spin to wear Golem down. Explosion deals minimal damage after a reapplied burn, so Golem is often better off switching out if this happens; it can be saved to chip down a paralyzed Mr. Mime, Clefable, or Venomoth later or used as a sacrifice for momentum.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Golem loses against just about any Pokemon that packs a Water- or Ice-type coverage move, unless it is paralyzed. Clefable outspeeds and 2HKOes Golem with Blizzard, and it is only 3HKOed in return. Golem can fish for full paralysis with Substitute against a paralyzed Clefable, or it can use Explosion to remove it, which is usually a beneficial trade for the Golem user given Clefable's value, but the risk of a Blizzard critical hit makes this dubious. Raticate 2HKOes Golem with Bubble Beam and easily covers any switch-in with Super Fang. Thus, Golem cannot beat it one-on-one, cannot switch into it, and opens up a teammate to heavy damage by switching out. Golem does 2HKO with Earthquake, so a paralyzed Raticate is far less of an issue; Golem can defeat it and then land Explosion on something else later. Nidoking cannot switch into Golem, since they mutually 2HKO, but Nidoking wins one-on-one with Blizzard handily.</p> <p><strong>Venomoth: While Venomoth fears both Earthquake and Rock Slide, it easily comes in after a KO or as Golem sets up Substitute and threatens to put it to sleep. Venomoth can also run Mega Drain, which just barely misses the 2HKO but heavily wears Golem down. Golem cannot switch in well even after Sleep Clause takes effect, as Stun Spore and Psychic remain threatening.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Earthquake deals immense damage against most foes, 3HKOing at worst, and it 2HKOes Mr. Mime, Nidoking, Raticate, Kabutops, and Ninetales. Rock Slide OHKOes Charizard and Moltres and comes just short of OHKOing Venomoth. Explosion OHKOes frail Pokemon like Mr. Mime and Raticate, and it deals massive damage to Clefable and Blastoise, KOing them after mild chip damage. Substitute eases prediction and allows Golem to fish for full paralysis against paralyzed foes; it can easily set up Substitute in front of Electrode or Fearow. Alternatively, Body Slam can paralyze Water-type switch-ins; since Golem's Earthquake 3HKOes them all, they cannot switch in again later if paralyzed, since Golem will outspeed and finish them off. Golem's primary advantages over its main competitor, Nidoking, include its vastly superior typing and bulk, which make it a far more effective check to Charizard, Mr. Mime, and Venomoth. However, its lower Speed and 4x Water weakness make Nidoking the superior choice against Clefable, Exeggcute, and every Water-type. This Speed gap makes Golem far more reliant on paralysis, and it needs allies that can switch into Ice- and Water-type attacks, such as Blastoise and Seadra; Nidoking operates far more independently but brings little defensive value.</p> <p>Golem can seek out lopsided matchups and find entry against Thunder Wave users mid-game, or it can be saved to revenge kill paralyzed targets and threaten Explosion. Golem desperately does not want to take damage on entry; a lot of theoretically-good matchups become quite poor with a critical hit or Special drop. For example, Mr. Mime only 3HKOes Golem normally, but with its nearly 50% odds of a critical hit or Special drop, it has a fair chance to 2HKO instead. Similarly, taking a Fire Blast on entry is essentially a 30% chance to turn Golem into a paperweight, and a Charizard Earthquake might deal over 60% if it critically hits. Therefore, Golem benefits from teams that spread paralysis and, most importantly, force the opponent to switch into paralysis-inflicting moves. For example, Blastoise can use Body Slam against Charizard, potentially catching it switching out and paralyzing an incoming Blastoise or Mr. Mime, and Venomoth forces the opponent to switch into Stun Spore after it puts something to sleep. Exeggcute, for example, checks Mr. Mime, spreads paralysis, and enables allied Mr. Mime to spread paralysis and bait Thunder Wave. When the opponent's hapless Thunder Wave user tries to retaliate, Golem comes in to block Thunder Wave and fire off powerful attacks. This is notably far less effective against Clefable unless it is chipped significantly; Clefable's bulk allows it to take hits from Golem, and Blizzard 2HKOes normally but also has about a 20% chance to critically hit or freeze.</p> <p>Alternatively, Golem can work as a late-game cleaner on fast teams with many paralysis options; Venomoth and Body Slam Charizard, for example, can help spread enough paralysis for Golem to tear through the enemy team and finish the game. Water-types make good teammates as well; Golem covers their Electric weaknesses, and in return they help to check opposing Water-types and solidify the matchup against Fire-types. In particular, Blastoise and Kingler can use Body Slam to hamstring targets for Golem and force the opponent into guessing games when they'd like to use Thunderbolt. If the opponent predicts incorrectly, they will often end up losing a Pokemon for minimal gain; Kingler is especially dangerous, as a single mistake may allow it to set up Swords Dance and inflict incredible damage. Golem does struggle late-game against many foes often saved for a sweep, like Kingler, Nidoking, and Seadra, so using it in this role requires careful scouting and team support.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Golem stands out in RBY Ubers as a Ground-type with access to Explosion. This gives it a significant niche over Rhydon, letting it deal up to 80% to tier king Mewtwo. With unresisted QuakeSlide coverage, it's not just an Explosion that it offers; its coverage helps immensely against Rhydon, Zapdos, Gengar, and Jolteon. With adequate paralysis support, Golem can deal massive damage and blow up on a high-value Pokemon, providing its teammates with incredible momentum. Golem's typing also gives it a valuable Normal resistance and an Electric immunity, helping to check threats like Tauros and Snorlax and soundly beating Zapdos and Jolteon.</p> <p>However, Golem is only favored over Rhydon on offensive teams that look to overwhelm the opponent with Explosion. Rhydon fits on more team styles and offers added consistency that Golem simply can’t muster. Self-Destruct Snorlax and Explosion Mew, while great partners on offensive teams, are also capable of compressing Golem's role while having potential surprise value and allowing for more consistent team options; notably, Snorlax also possesses a stronger self-KO move thanks to STAB. Ergo, the bulkier and harder-hitting Rhydon can often fill Golem's place just fine, 3HKOing Mewtwo with Earthquake, while Golem can only do so inconsistently. Additionally, Rhydon is capable of walling non-Earthquake Mew sets and making 103 HP Substitutes, which can absorb a Seismic Toss from Chansey. Thus, Rhydon is often recommended if Golem's Explosion isn't required. Furthermore, Golem shares all of Rhydon's flaws: it's slow, specially frail, and has common weaknesses to Ice and Water. Without paralysis support, Golem struggles to win consistently in one-on-one battles, which can't always be afforded in the harsh world of RBY Ubers.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>When customizing Golem's set, it's best to replace Rock Slide, Substitute, or Body Slam, but these come with caveats. Removing Rock Slide makes it difficult for Golem to damage Exeggutor and Zapdos, removing Substitute makes it impossible for Golem to set up in front of paralyzed foes, and removing Body Slam leaves Golem without a midground option while becoming more reliant on its team for paralysis. With this in mind, attempts to customize Golem are not recommended.</p> <p>If you must customize Golem, using Defense Curl or Harden isn't terrible, as these allow Golem to consistently wall non-Earthquake Snorlax variants. In the long run, however, this doesn't pan out, as most non-Earthquake Snorlax variants use Reflect + Rest or Amnesia, which overwhelm Golem through sheer longevity and firepower, respectively. Against the latter, Golem is likely to use Explosion anyway, as Amnesia Snorlax threatens severe damage to its team. Outside of this, Fire Blast is plausible for hitting Exeggutor slightly harder when it switches in and potentially burning it, removing the threat of its Explosion, but the risk of thawing a Pokemon and lack of utility outside of this makes it hard to justify.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mewtwo: While Mewtwo does not appreciate taking Explosion—which is a guaranteed KO after a single Earthquake—unboosted Psychic 2HKOes Golem and can force Explosion much earlier than desired. If Mewtwo has used Amnesia even once, it must be paralyzed for Golem to do anything. Ice Beam variants completely incapacitate Golem; high damage rolls do enough to even let Zapdos win out. While rare, an unboosted Blizzard from Mewtwo OHKOes Golem half the time. If Mewtwo is paralyzed, however, a single full paralysis lets Golem attempt to 3HKO it with Earthquake, which works a quarter of the time but otherwise leaves Mewtwo easily revenge killed. Furthermore, Thunderbolt + Submission Mewtwo sets actually struggle against Golem, failing to 3HKO it and getting 2HKOed in return by Earthquake + Explosion; thus, it is forced to repeatedly use Recover or switch out. Finally, Barrier Mewtwo completely stops Golem in its tracks, as after a single Defense boost, Earthquake becomes a 6HKO at best, while Explosion deals less than 40%. However, both aforementioned Mewtwo sets are rare.</p> <p><strong>Reflect Users</strong>: Reflect throws a spanner in the works for Golem, swiftly taking a Pokemon out of Explosion KO range; faster Pokemon using Reflect as Golem uses Explosion is particularly depressing. Mew isn't completely incapacitated by an Explosion if it's at full HP and walls Golem if using Reflect sets. If using Earthquake, Mew 3HKOes Golem consistently without having to boost. Golem cannot 3HKO non-Reflect Mew without prior chip damage. Thus, Golem is largely limited to using Explosion and hoping Mew doesn't switch out. Chansey isn't always OHKOed by Explosion, and if it's running Reflect Golem has no hope of winning outside of luck. Moreover, if Chansey is using Ice Beam, it can 2HKO Golem, and this is sometimes run on the same set. Reflect Snorlax is a similarly unfeasible matchup for Golem unless it gets extreme luck, especially if Snorlax is using Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor: Exeggutor can switch in on Golem without much fear and put it to sleep. In the event sleep isn't an option, Exeggutor still 2HKOes Golem with Psychic a quarter of the time. However, Exeggutor can't repeatedly switch in on Rock Slide, as it tends to lose out against Seismic Toss users such as Chansey later or otherwise get forced into using Explosion sooner. If Exeggutor is paralyzed and at around half HP, Golem can win with Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Slowbro and the rarer Starmie and Lapras can all OHKO Golem with Surf. However, Slowbro dislikes having Golem switch in on a predicted Rest, as it forces it to Rest stall with repeated Earthquakes by threat of a 4HKO; a single critical hit can mean it loses outright. If Slowbro has set up prior, Earthquake + Explosion is a viable route to dispatch it.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage: If Golem takes a super effective hit, it is normally forced into Explosion, which is a less than ideal situation. Mega Drain Exeggutor adores any opportunity to use it against Golem, recovering a minimum of 37.6%. Blizzard users such as Tauros, Jynx, Cloyster, and the rare Dragonite and Articuno also mortally threaten Golem, with the latter even OHKOing it. Tauros can switch in on Golem's Body Slam and threaten a 2HKO with Blizzard. Snorlax may use Blizzard alongside Amnesia to try to sweep, which OHKOes Golem at +2. The rare Victreebel can OHKO Golem with Razor Leaf or put it to sleep with Sleep Powder. While it's not likely to win the interaction, Jolteon's Double Kick deals up to 19.8% each time, which can wear Golem down and force an early Explosion.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>The combination of Earthquake and Rock Slide gives Golem unresisted physical coverage; when factoring in the threat of Explosion, this makes Golem very difficult to switch into. Golem's Earthquake may OHKO Gengar and Jolteon and 2HKOes Alakazam and—rarely—Chansey. It also serves as Golem's best option against Mewtwo and Mew, 3HKOing Mewtwo about a quarter of the time and 3HKOing Mew if it's taken minor damage prior. Furthermore, just a single Earthquake puts Mewtwo in range for Explosion. Golem has a fair shot at wearing down any non-Ice Beam Mewtwo if it's paralyzed, though it's also 2HKOed by Psychic. Rock Slide potentially OHKOes Jynx and 2HKOes Zapdos, ensuring the latter can be consistently dealt with. It is also Golem's best option against Exeggutor, which likes to switch in on it and threaten with sleep. Substitute can allow Golem to place itself in a favorable position if it can set up against paralyzed foes, such as Mewtwo and Chansey. Alternatively, Body Slam allows Golem to be more self-sufficient in spreading paralysis, which can let it turn the tables on switch-ins.</p> <p>Explosion is Golem's claim to fame and should not be taken lightly. It OHKOes non-Reflect Chansey, Jynx, and Alakazam, as well as Starmie 38% of the time. It also deals up to 80% to Mewtwo and up to 75.9% to Mew. Golem itself holds little value once the opposing team's Electric-type has been removed, so using Explosion to incapacitate Mewtwo or Mew is very desirable. In practice, however, this is very difficult, as the threat of Explosion can be enough to force out Mewtwo and Mew if they're in range. Snorlax and Mew often succeed with their self-KO moves because of their set variety, allowing for more effective bluffs, which Golem cannot afford. Another ideal situation for Explosion is when threatened with an Amnesia Snorlax or Slowbro sweep, as it's one of the only consistent ways to prevent them from sweeping once they set up. Landing Explosion on Chansey can enable Mewtwo, and removing Snorlax can be similarly useful for preventing its powerful early-game offense, but this isn't ideal, as it may leave Golem’s team vulnerable to opposing Electric-types late-game. It's recommended to account for opposing Gengar, Rock-types, and frozen or sleeping Pokemon that can switch in to absorb Explosion. Thus, it may be appropriate to keep Golem unrevealed for extended periods of time, whereas Mew and Snorlax generally don't imply their self-KO moves until they actually use them. As a rule of thumb, using Explosion should be a game of trades; understanding the value that each Pokemon holds to the opposing team is pivotal to succeeding.</p> <p>Golem is best played on offensive teams with multiple self-KO move users, such as Self-Destruct Snorlax, Explosion Mew, and Exeggutor; while prediction-heavy and thus inconsistent, these teams are capable of closing out games very quickly. In other cases, Rhydon tends to outclass Golem and should be looked to first. Golem also pairs well with Water-types like Slowbro and the rarer Starmie and Lapras, which appreciate its Electric immunity. Slowbro notably punishes non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo, and the combination of Slowbro and Golem is capable of muscling past it without compromising your own Mewtwo. However, both are painfully slow, which can be problematic on a poorly built team. Paralysis support is paramount so that the opposition doesn't recover out of KO range, so Pokemon like Chansey, Starmie, Stun Spore Exeggutor, and the aforementioned Slowbro are recommended. Golem tends to hold little value to a team due to its disposable nature, so sacrificing it against sleepers like Exeggutor and Sing Chansey isn't unusual. In fact, against Chansey, it's plausible to cut your losses and have Golem use Explosion in response to a missed Sing, potentially OHKOing it and enabling Mewtwo.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Golem's Rock / Ground typing makes it a strong attacker that crucially hard counters Zapdos and Jolteon while resisting Normal-type attacks. Its QuakeSlide coverage is completely unresisted and able to 2HKO Pokemon like Rhydon, Zapdos, and Alakazam. This makes Golem excellent at bullying paralyzed Pokemon, but what tops this all off is Explosion. Golem's Explosion, while just shy of Snorlax's Self-Destruct's strength, is terrifyingly strong, even having a chance to OHKO Starmie. Explosion Golem is likely to break even (at worst) against most Pokemon, and this has kept it relevant for decades.</p> <p>However, Golem is very slow and has devastating weaknesses to most common special attacks; it has to run from Blizzard, Surf, Razor Leaf, and whatnot. Even neutral special attacks such as Psychic will deal significant damage to Golem. Further, being so slow means Golem gets forced to use Explosion in many one-on-one fights. Due to these two setbacks, Golem is very reliant on enemy teams being riddled with paralysis before it gets going. Plus, while Explosion can theoretically compensate for Golem's Speed and let it break even frequently, Golem generally shouldn't use Explosion until the opponent's Zapdos or Jolteon is accounted for, lest its team crumble to them. Therefore, decision-making with Explosion is difficult until Zapdos or Jolteon is paralyzed or KOed, after which it can be deployed more freely and actually exert offensive pressure. This can make its role seem a little paradoxical to the uninitiated.</p> <p>Golem famously fell from RBY OU in 2019, ending a long-standing battle between it and Rhydon for places on competitive teams. Understanding this is important, as while many teams can use Golem adequately, they tend to be better off with Rhydon instead. This is because Rhydon has a higher Attack stat, which allows it to achieve damage thresholds like 2HKOing Chansey and rarely 2HKOing Starmie. It's also capable of sometimes 3HKOing Slowbro, defusing a key threat if it switches in on Rest. The extra damage output against Exeggutor, Rhydon's and Golem's biggest counter and most common switch-in, is also a key advantage; Exeggutor cannot safely switch in as much as it would like against the rocky rhino. Additionally, Rhydon is bulkier thanks to its higher HP, which also enables 104 HP Substitutes to stomach Seismic Toss or Night Shade. This quirk helps Rhydon reliably run and use Substitute in general; it can fish for Substitute in situations where Golem is forced to use Explosion, making it even harder for Golem to justify itself on teams. Regardless, Golem's strong perks over Rhydon remain recognized: possessing the second-strongest self-KO move and outrunning Rhydon allow it to indisputably succeed over Rhydon on highly specific teams.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Customizing Golem usually involves looking at what it has over Rhydon, but this tends to be a fool's errand when looking beyond Explosion. If you must customize Golem, Body Slam is the most replaceable option, but note that this means its team will need at least one more reliable paralysis-spreading Pokemon to be effective.</p> <p>Golem can run Substitute to try and be like its brother Rhydon, but at that point, it's usually better to bite the bullet and use the stony superior. The utility of having both Substitute and Explosion is typically just not enough. Fire Blast can burn Exeggutor switching in, effectively ruining its Explosion, but it deals just barely more damage than Rock Slide, and Golem is usually forced out thereafter anyway. Defense Curl or Harden can let Golem consistently wall Snorlax and reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, but these perks are dubious at best in respect to what Golem wants to do.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Exeggutor: Exeggutor can switch into Golem's Earthquake and threaten it with Sleep Powder or Psychic, forcing it out and granting Exeggutor's team significant momentum. Mega Drain variants are particularly soul-crushing, almost OHKOing Golem while letting Exeggutor recover almost half its HP. Once Exeggutor is at half HP and paralyzed, however, it's in Rock Slide's 2HKO range and cannot switch in.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: It's hard to name a Pokemon in RBY OU that doesn't have a super effective move against Golem. Any Pokemon with Surf or Razor Leaf, such as Starmie, Venusaur, or Victreebel, can OHKO Golem outright. Blizzard or Ice Beam users like Starmie, Chansey, Articuno, Tauros, and Amnesia Snorlax can also deal significant-to-heavy damage to Golem. Even Rhydon's Earthquake 2HKOes. Golem can usually take non-STAB Blizzard from full HP though, so keep this in mind for when a risky trade is necessary.</p> <p><strong>Reflect Normal-types: Reflect Snorlax doesn't care about anything Golem can throw at it, effortlessly trading blows with it. If it has Ice Beam, the matchup becomes completely unwinnable. The best Golem can offer in the matchup is using Explosion before Snorlax can use Reflect, after Reflect has already been revealed, but this should only be done in desperate situations. Reflect Chansey can perform similar feats, being just fast enough to use Reflect before Golem can use Explosion by default, but it should be at least a little afraid if paralyzed and without Reflect set up.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: While it's afraid of Body Slam paralysis, Starmie normally runs at least one super effective move against Golem, namely Surf or Blizzard. Surf OHKOes Golem outright, while Blizzard deals up to 79.8%. Unlike Rhydon, Golem can't 2HKO Starmie without a very lucky critical hit or Explosion. While Golem does like to use Explosion against Starmie, it's only 38.5% to OHKO, so the matchup remains a bad situation for it in a vacuum. Golem can only outright win this matchup if Starmie has taken prior damage or paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: You know it's bad when Clamp deals over half a Pokemon's HP. While Cloyster greatly fears Rock Slide, especially if paralyzed, it can use Blizzard to potentially OHKO Golem in return, or Clamp—liberally—to scout for its switch-in.</p> ",

Rock Slide potentially OHKOes Articuno, Moltres, and Jynx; it also 2HKOes Zapdos and sometimes Dragonite. Earthquake is Golem's strongest attack without drawbacks and should be used liberally; it can OHKO Gengar and Jolteon and 2HKO Alakazam and Rhydon. Body Slam lets Golem be more self-sufficient in the paralysis-spreading effort, and it's useful to potentially incapacitate checks like Starmie and Exeggutor.</p> <p>What defines Golem, however, is Explosion. The dream of a Golem player is to beat out Zapdos or Jolteon late-game, then use Explosion on the opponent's last healthy Pokemon. This is a difficult dream to attain, but not impossible. Golem should ideally use Explosion very late into a game; usually, this is when the trade is clearly game-winning and the potential Electric-type threat has been accounted for. If Golem uses Explosion before Zapdos or Jolteon is revealed, its team may fall apart. Knowing common team structures and strategies involving these Pokemon is essential to predict if Explosion is safe prior to the last Pokemon being revealed. Tauros, Snorlax, and Chansey are omnipresent, so this can alleviate prediction by a chunk. Golem should ideally use Explosion against Starmie, which normally threatens Golem's partners with its sublime coverage and Speed. Starmie should ideally be ever-so-slightly chipped or paralyzed before doing this, as an OHKO isn't guaranteed. If Starmie lacks Surf, Golem can add the chip damage itself, as Blizzard deals 79.3% at most without a critical hit. If Starmie isn't present, Golem can also use Explosion on Chansey or Snorlax to pave the way for Tauros. Outside of this, Explosion can be a handy contingency plan in the event Slowbro snowballs out of control.</p> <p>Golem is frequently pushed out by Rhydon on teams, as its Explosion and favorable matchup against its rocky friend are typically unnecessary. Parties that require these traits typically use Pokemon like Moltres, which appreciate a better matchup against Rhydon- and Zapdos-centric teams. Teams that can't afford to compress the self-KO role onto Snorlax with Self-Destruct, or that wish to use an Explosion user alongside it, can also utilize Golem over Rhydon. Teams that feature many Explosion users—\"Boom Offense\"—will sometimes include Golem, but its low defensive utility makes it a tough fit even then.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Though Golem is a less used Pokemon in the RBY UU metagame, it certainly has its merits as a wallbreaker for a few reasons, with the biggest being Explosion. An Explosion coming from Golem is actually the strongest attack in the tier, having the power to put a massive dent in defensive stalwart Vaporeon or even OHKO Hypno. A properly timed Explosion can turn the tide of battle in your favor, but that's not all Golem has to offer. With proper paralysis support and good prediction, it can punch holes in enemy teams using STAB moves Earthquake and Rock Slide. Golem can do all this while also having good defensive utility due to its Rock / Ground typing, which gives it a resistance to Normal-type moves and an immunity to Electric-type moves. Wrap is a defining element of RBY UU, and Golem can be a useful part of an anti-Wrap core due to its resistance to the move. In addition, it can switch in on Dodrio or on another Pokemon's predicted Hyper Beam and punish both with impunity. Finally, its Electric immunity makes it easier to switch in on a predicted Thunder Wave or Thunderbolt, especially when paired with one of UU's many strong Water-types, such as Tentacruel.</p> <p>Golem's most glaring weakness is its Speed. Golem is outsped by pretty much every Pokemon that sees play in UU, even Pokemon known for being slow like Omastar and Tangela. Not only does Golem have little special bulk, it also has a host of weaknesses. This means that it can be OHKOed by UU's aforementioned Water types, as well as by Pokemon like Articuno with Blizzard and even Raichu with Surf. Therefore, Golem is heavily reliant on support from its teammates and good predictions in order to make an impact.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Golem's most useful alternative move is Rest, which is used over Substitute or Body Slam as a way to keep Golem healthy. When Golem gets low on health, it can go for Rest as the opponent switches in a sleeping Pokemon to take the Explosion. As mentioned before, it can also burn off the sleep turns by coming in on Wrap and Hyper Beam, or on another sleeping Pokemon. Fire Blast is a possible offensive option that does more damage to Tangela than any of Golem's other moves. It also has the potential to burn foes, which is especially useful against partial-trappers like Dragonite. Finally, Counter can be used after switching into Hyper Beam and or Body Slam, either hitting the recharging foe or punishing an Explosion switch-in.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Due to Golem’s low Special, low Speed, and 4x weakness to Water, any Water-type can OHKO it. Vaporeon can tank anything Golem throws at it, even Explosion from full health. Gyarados can switch in on Earthquake for no damage and OHKO Golem, though it does need to watch out if Golem predicts the switch and uses Rock Slide. Omastar also outspeeds and OHKOes Golem, though Golem does over half of Omastar's health in damage with Earthquake. Tentacruel also takes huge damage from Earthquake and can even be OHKOed by Explosion, but it still maintains the upper hand, as it can OHKO Golem or halt its plans to use Explosion with Wrap. While Golem can be used with another Pokemon like Haunter or Omastar to form an anti-Wrap PP stalling core, it still needs to watch out for Tentacruel's Surf.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: The two notable Grass-types in the tier, Tangela and Venusaur, are both solid checks to Golem. Tangela’s high Defense, resistance to Earthquake, and access to STAB Mega Drain make it an excellent check to Golem. Note that Mega Drain does not OHKO until Tangela has a Growth under its belt, meaning Tangela is still susceptible to taking massive damage from Explosion. In addition, if the Golem player predicts a Tangela switch-in, they can opt for Rock Slide, which Tangela has a harder time shrugging off since it hits for neutral damage. Venusaur is a little worse at switching into Golem, as it does not resist Earthquake and is 3HKOed. However, it easily outspeeds Golem and OHKOes it with Razor Leaf, unlike Tangela, meaning the Golem player has fewer options. In either case, both Tangela and Venusaur force Golem to switch out, meaning they can spread status to Golem's teammates.</p> <p><strong>Articuno: As a Flying-type, Articuno is able to switch in on Earthquake and take out Golem easily with STAB Blizzard. However, good prediction on the Golem user’s end can spell disaster for Articuno, as it is OHKOed by Rock Slide. Articuno also will be sent running if Golem uses Substitute or paralyzes it with Body Slam on the switch. While it is a risky play, Golem can even switch into a paralyzed Articuno while it attempts to use Agility. If full paralysis triggers either turn, Golem wins the interaction with Rock Slide. Finally, if Articuno gets unlucky and Blizzard misses while Rock Slide does not, it is KOed.</p> <p><strong>Raichu</strong>: Raichu has a hard time switching into Golem's attacks due to Earthquake hitting for super effective damage and Body Slam potentially paralyzing it. However, if it switches in on Rock Slide, Golem is in trouble. Raichu outspeeds it and OHKOes with Surf, forcing Golem out.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Earthquake and Rock Slide are Golem's go-to moves early in the game, weaker than Explosion but packing a big punch coming off its base 110 Attack. Due to its powerful STAB moves and Explosion, Golem can be used effectively as a wallbreaker, especially for punishing Pokemon that have just used Rest. For its final moveslot, Substitute is used to help scout moves and Pokemon as well as providing a layer of defense so Golem can get off an Explosion without being KOed first. However, Body Slam can be used over Substitute to help hinder your opponent's team through paralysis, meaning Golem doesn't need to rely on its teammates for paralysis support as much.</p> <p>Explosion is used to deal extraordinary damage to every Pokemon in the tier, with a few exceptions such as Omastar and Haunter. Some notable calculations include a guaranteed OHKO on Persian and possible OHKOs on Tentacruel and Hypno. It is against your opponent's bulky Pokemon that Explosion really shines, taking out hard-to-KO team members or at least putting a huge dent in them so they can be revenge killed. A good example target is Kangaskhan, which Golem switches into and easily tanks a Body Slam from—barely minding potential paralysis due to its Speed—before dealing 72.8-85.7% damage with Explosion to set up a revenge kill. Deciding when to use Explosion can be hard, though, since your opponent can predict it and switch in a Pokemon that is already low on health or that resists it. Anticipate this counterplay and use a different move, such as a STAB move for instant damage, Substitute to scout, or Body Slam for a chance to spread paralysis. It is recommended to use Explosion when Golem is around half health or when you think you can catch Hypno on the switch, either OHKOing this top threat or priming it for a revenge killer like Dugtrio to follow up on.</p> <p>Despite its flaws, Golem still manages to find a few different points of entry into the game. For instance, bringing in Golem is a great way to stop a Dodrio sweep, as Rock Slide deals super effective damage and Golem hard walls Dodrio. It is especially adept at switching into Hyper Beam and punishing Dodrio and Articuno with Rock Slide or Kangaskhan and Persian with Explosion. Golem can also be used as sleep fodder, since its defensive typing means it can freely switch in often on Normal-, Electric-, and Rock-type moves, allowing for easy pivoting. It can even wake up from short sleeps if switched in on Wrap or Hyper Beam enough times.</p> <p>Golem can form an excellent immunity core with Gyarados, as it covers Gyarados's Electric weakness and Gyarados covers its Ground weakness, so both can be effective mid- or late-game by coming in freely on double switches. Pairing Golem with another effective anti-Wrap Pokemon such as Haunter or Omastar is also a valid strategy, as they can work together to PP stall Wrap without sustaining too much damage. Golem works especially well with either because Haunter's Thunderbolt handles its Water-type counters and Omastar's Blizzard dispatches its Grass-type counters. Especially if Golem doesn't run Body Slam, it appreciates paralysis-spreading teammates. A great example is Kadabra, which shrugs off special attacks surprisingly well for it with Recover, revenge kills threats to Golem, and appreciates it taking Normal-type attacks and the crippling Thunder Wave in return. Finally, Dugtrio takes advantage of Golem weakening or KOing an opponent's Ground-type checks to have a much easier time revenge killing or sweeping.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>While in heavy competition with Rhydon for a spot on a team, Golem has merit for its access to Explosion, letting it blow holes in opposing teams for its allies to exploit. Golem's higher Speed compared to Rhydon also pays dividends in Stadium, giving it a 12% critical hit rate that helps it break through opposing Reflect Snorlax and Chansey. These traits make Golem a fair pick on teams weak to Rhydon that need a consistent way to beat bulkier Pokemon like the aforementioned Normal-types, as well as Slowbro and Rest Exeggutor. When provided with paralysis support, Golem is a serious threat, dealing massive damage with its STAB moves while still maintaining the threat of Explosion, often securing the late-game for its team as a result.</p> <p>However, Golem's Explosion and Speed are all it has over Rhydon. Rhydon has superior overall bulk, 103 HP Substitutes to consistently beat Seismic Toss Chansey, and a better Attack stat that gives it more consistent KO ranges. Because of this, on top of Snorlax having a superior self-KO move in STAB Self-Destruct, Golem is very hard to fit onto teams. Golem still has Rhydon's flaws as well: it's very slow and specially frail, making it take mortal damage against special attackers like Starmie, Alakazam, and Lapras, forcing it to use Explosion earlier than one would expect. Its slowness also causes it to lose one-on-one matchups surprisingly frequently, such as against Tauros and Exeggutor. Like Rhydon’s, while Golem's defensive typing does provide a useful Electric immunity for combatting Zapdos and Jolteon, it also gives massive weaknesses to Ice- and Water-type coverage from Pokemon like Chansey and Snorlax, making it very difficult for Golem to successfully enter battle and do its job. These problems make Golem a rare sight in Stadium OU, but it’s still a serviceable pick for teams that need a better Rhydon matchup in addition to an Explosion user.</p> ",

Rock Slide particularly hits Exeggutor for neutral damage, ensuring it can't repeatedly switch in, lest it be forced to use Rest early. It also hits Flying-types like Articuno and Zapdos for heavy damage, forcing them out and letting Golem scout with Body Slam. Earthquake has the potential to OHKO Gengar and Jolteon while serving as its strongest attack without a drawback. Body Slam serves as a midground option, letting Golem spread paralysis for itself while punishing potential switch-ins. Explosion allows Golem to trade with an important Pokemon; note, however, that it doesn't let Golem survive breaking a Substitute, unlike in regular RBY. This means that scouting the target for Substitute or paralyzing it is recommended.</p> <p>Stadium's Team Preview benefits Golem’s Explosion, as you will always know whether the opponent has a Zapdos, Jolteon, or Gengar on their team. If Zapdos or Jolteon is present, it's best to hold back the Explosion until late-game, where Golem can check them more effectively. Still, remember that Golem struggles to actually get in to check them, as it can be somewhat predictable. Similarly, in Gengar's case, saving Explosion until it’s used its own Explosion or otherwise been crippled is recommended, or it can be used to nullify Explosion completely. Rhydon poses a risk for similar reasons, but it struggles to switch in due to the threat of Earthquake, though it's notable regardless. If none of these Pokemon are present, Explosion can be used much earlier to KO important mid-game Pokemon like Snorlax and Chansey. It's also perfectly viable to use it as an emergency check to Slowbro if it's picked up too many Amnesia boosts.</p> <p>Golem has room for customization to further differentiate itself from Rhydon, but this is often a misguided effort, as it has to drop Body Slam or Rock Slide, opening it up to exploitation. Defense Curl or Harden can be used to make Golem more consistently check Snorlax, but this still loses to Amnesia variants. Fire Blast is a somewhat viable option for hitting Exeggutor and burning switch-ins, but this can backfire against Pokemon that prefer being burned, such as Starmie and Chansey. Substitute can potentially be used to guard against status and get more hits in, but Rhydon does this better by a long shot and it makes Golem inclined to use Explosion earlier, so it's not recommended.</p> "

Thunder Wave allows Slowpoke to outspeed and cripple Pokemon that can threaten it.</p> <p>Slowpoke has a very solid movepool, leaving a good amount of options to choose from. Psychic can be used over Surf, as, even though it is weaker against neutral targets, it sports a 30% special drop rate.

Blizzard allows Slowpoke to hit Exeggcute super effectively, as well as still hitting Moltres and Charizard. It also allows Slowpoke to fish for a freeze, which can be useful in a pinch. Ice Beam, although weaker than Blizzard, is more reliable. Fire Blast can deal good damage to Grass- and Bug-types, having a 28.2% chance of OHKOing the likes of Pinsir after an Amnesia.

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Amnesia Slowbro has gone down in history as one of the most famous and well-known sets in the world of competitive Pokemon. Generally known as TobyBro, Amnesia Slowbro is a moveset that combines both simplicity and efficiency. The RBY version of Amnesia is arguably the best stat-boosting move of all time, raising the Special stat by two stages. It quickly powers up Slowbro's Special moves, while covering its main defensive weakness: Electric-type attacks. Having one of the best physical defense stats in the game and learning Thunder Wave to make up for its awful Speed greatly helps make Slowbro more threatening as well.</p> <p>However, Slowbro is also a bit of an all-or-nothing Pokemon and requires some luck, which are the main reasons why it's often an overlooked Pokemon. Without setting up, Slowbro is basically a useless Pokemon; it can't Recover to work as a wall for a long time, and offensively, it lacks Explosion or a sleep move, unlike other specially based Pokemon. On the other hand, if Slowbro sets up, it's meant never to switch out, so the user is inevitably taking some risks; Electric-type moves fail to get past a +6 Slowbro normally, but with a critical hit, a non-STAB Thunderbolt will nearly OHKO Slowbro while a STAB Thunderbolt will OHKO outright. With critical hit rates being much higher in RBY than in later generations, it's not really \"bad luck\" when Slowbro ultimately ends up falling to a critical hit Thunderbolt. To a lesser extent, this can also be applied to the physical side, potentially turning 4HKOs into 3HKOs, letting a physical sweeper get past Rest. However, while it's true that Slowbro depends on quite a bit on luck, it also requires a good deal of skill, and Slowbro can be one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the first generation, being the best Amnesia user in RBY after Mewtwo.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ice Beam is another attacking move Slowbro can use. Its biggest upside is hitting Grass-types and Zapdos for super effective damage, including Exeggutor and Victreebel. Ice Beam will often surprise Exeggutor, OHKOing it at +6. At the very least, it will force Exeggutor to use Explosion earlier, making it more predictable. Meanwhile, Zapdos is 2HKOed by a +2 Ice Beam and OHKOed when Slowbro is at +6. Ice Beam's freeze chance might also save you in a pinch and could make a difference against another Slowbro or Amnesia Snorlax. Ice Beam, however, should only be used over Thunder Wave, because the STAB move is necessary to 2HKO Chansey and Starmie. Withdraw has the same goal as Reflect, with the difference that it can maximize Slowbro's Defense, but requires two turns to reach Reflect's potential. Reflect will generally turn out to be more useful and safer. Withdraw's high PP will let Slowbro outstall other Slowbro, however. Counter can surprise common Slowbro switch-ins like Starmie if you switch into a Body Slam from a physical attacker and scare it out, or if you predict a Hyper Beam. Counter has hardly any other uses other than these though because Slowbro generally only takes physical attacks when it's asleep, excluding Explosion. Disable is a funny option that can prevent some Pokemon from Thunderbolting Slowbro for some time, but it's very unreliable and shouldn't really be used.</p> <p>Slowbro can also be used as a lead with a set of Thunder Wave, Amnesia, Surf, and Fire Blast or Blizzard. This set is incredibly vulnerable to sleep leads such as Jynx, Exeggutor, Gengar, and Sing Chansey; however, when it finds itself against other Thunder Wave leads, namely Alakazam and Starmie, its ability to boost up with Amnesia and pump out damage with +2 coverage moves is remarkable. It still struggles in doing significant damage if the opponent has Thunderbolt Chansey or Starmie anywhere on their team, and due to its lack of recovery it is incredibly easy to wear down and incredibly vulnerable to full paralysis, so this set is not recommended.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type coverage: The higher the user's critical hit ratio and the number of turns it can resist Slowbro's Surf, the better. Starmie is a good choice, having a very high Speed and thus a high critical hit ratio, while also resisting all of Slowbro's moves. It's not a surefire counter though, and in case Starmie prevails, it won't like having to eat a Thunder Wave. Gengar makes a good choice too, having a high critical hit ratio and being able to Explode for around 50% damage when it's about to be KOed. However, it doesn't resist Surf and is weak to Psychic. Zapdos and Jolteon have the luxury of getting STAB in their Electric-type attacks; even when Slowbro is at +6, their Thunderbolts will still do significant damage. They also have a high critical hit ratio, but like Gengar, they don't resist Surf, and, unlike Gengar, can't Explode.</p> <p><strong>Explosion users: Explosion makes a very viable choice for taking Slowbro down when you have no other option. No user can OHKO a healthy Slowbro, but many put it in the KO range of Tauros's Hyper Beam or Rhydon's Earthquake. Pokemon with Explosion or Self-Destruct include Exeggutor, Snorlax, Golem, Cloyster, and Gengar, although Gengar's Explosion is weaker. A Resting Slowbro that gets Exploded on is pretty much a dead Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Amnesia Snorlax will often defeat Slowbro, as its Body Slam is an almost guaranteed 4HKO while Slowbro's Surf only manages a 5HKO when both are at +6. Due to the Speed tie, a 4HKO could turn into a 3HKO, depending on who goes first the turn Slowbro uses Rest. If Snorlax is packing Thunderbolt instead, it will fare even better, 3HKOing Slowbro after both have set up. As far as the physical side goes, Rhydon makes a surprisingly viable option, although risky as well; it has to switch in when Slowbro uses Rest, and then try to 3HKO it with its STAB Earthquake, which will happen around 75-80% of the time. Tauros needs a critical hit Body Slam to get the chance to 3HKO it after finishing it off with a Hyper Beam. If Tauros gets paralyzed, though, you can pretty much forget about beating Slowbro. Snorlax's critical hit ratio is much smaller than Tauros's, but its Body Slam is almost a guaranteed 4HKO, and has an easier chance if Body Slam paralyzes Slowbro. For instance, if Snorlax moves first while Slowbro tries to use Rest, but moves last on the previous turn that Slowbro Rested, Snorlax beats Slowbro with only Body Slam. Both Tauros and physical Snorlax should really be careful when trying to counter Slowbro and should generally only be sent in when Slowbro is sleeping because they will otherwise fall to previously-boosted Surfs more often than not. If Slowbro's set contains Reflect, though, trying to counter it with physical attacks becomes impractical unless you are willing to sacrifice at least two Exploders. In this case, however, any unparalyzed Thunderbolt user becomes a much more effective check, including the slow ones, such as Chansey and Lapras, which, despite their low critical hit rate, will get more chances to fish for it, as it's much more likely that Slowbro is forced to Rest more often. Chansey and especially Starmie will get the chance to keep using their recovery move until Slowbro gets fully paralyzed, which is when they get the chance to use Thunderbolt. Starmie is much better at doing this because Recover outlasts Surf in terms of PP.</p> <p><strong>Razor Leaf users: Victreebel and Venusaur are known for having a guaranteed critical hit in their STAB signature move, Razor Leaf. They won't like switching into a Thunder Wave, and could be surprised and OHKOed by a boosted STAB Psychic, but, otherwise, either of the Grass-types can KO Slowbro when it is below 70% or 2HKO it while it is Resting.</p> <p><strong>Light Screen users: Starmie or Chansey packing Light Screen will completely counter Slowbro unless they get really unlucky with full paralysis. Light Screen is never seen on them, however, as it has no use outside of walling Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: It's worth noting that Slowbro, as a Rest user, is one of those Pokemon that should be attacked whenever given the chance, because when it's Resting, you can apply a much higher and more effective variety of tactics to try to take it down. Exeggutor's Mega Drain and Alakazam and Jynx's Seismic Toss, for instance, may not do enough to kill Slowbro, but will cause some decent damage on it before being forced to switch out, which will force it to Rest earlier than desired.</p> ",

When playing Slowbro, it's really useful to know some significant damage rolls or otherwise have a damage calculator handy. As said, Slowbro has a good chance of 2HKOing Chansey but must be at +6. The same can be said about Starmie, although a 999 Special STAB Surf is a guaranteed 2HKO. On the other hand, Starmie is much more of a problem for Slowbro due to having a much higher critical hit ratio. Beating Tauros is about using Amnesia once and then 2HKOing it with Surf, although a +4 Slowbro stands a good chance of OHKOing Tauros. Snorlax, however, requires Slowbro to use Amnesia twice to get the 2HKO; a +6 Surf almost never OHKOes Snorlax. Zapdos also requires two Amnesia boosts, while Jolteon, like Tauros, is 2HKOed by a +2 Surf. Gengar will fall to two +2 Surfs half of the time, so it's generally advised to only use Amnesia once. Exeggutor and Lapras are 3HKOed by a +6 Surf; boosting either twice or three times is the way to go. All these calculations have been made considering that the opposition is at full health, so they may vary depending on the health of the opponent as well as on the situation of the battle itself.</p> <p>Having said that, using Thunder Wave first is almost always a good idea. Slowbro is tied with Snorlax as the slowest Pokemon in the game, so paralyzing Snorlax is also a good idea to guarantee Slowbro is faster than it or to fish for full paralysis. Against common Slowbro switch-ins, such as Starmie, Gengar, or Electric-types, Thunder Wave will have to be used as they switch in, so that you can get a boost before they are able to attack. However, it's generally advised to switch Slowbro back after paralyzing the switch-in to get the chance to move two consecutive times the next time they switch in. This way, you can maximize your chances of KOing said check before they are able to score a deadly critical hit Thunderbolt. Even if Starmie or Chansey paralyze Slowbro back in order to outspeed again, using Thunder Wave yourself first was the best move, because the chances of beating an unparalyzed Chansey and especially Starmie are slim, as they can just keep using Recover or Soft-Boiled until Slowbro gets fully paralyzed and they get a chance to use Thunderbolt. An unparalyzed Starmie can also attempt to PP stall Slowbro out of Surfs as well.</p> <p>Rest is perfectly suited for Slowbro. During the setup, Slowbro generally takes some residual damage and gets paralyzed, but Rest can keep Slowbro healthy and free of status. After maximizing its Special, no special attack can get past Slowbro's Rest without a critical hit, and due to Slowbro's great Defense and lack of exploitable physical weaknesses, it's going to be hard to beat Slowbro from the physical side without Explosion. Tauros, for example, needs a critical hit Body Slam and Hyper Beam to 3HKO Slowbro, which is the only way it has to get past Rest; furthermore, if Tauros gets paralyzed, its chances of beating Slowbro become very small. Snorlax, meanwhile, will generally have to resort to Self-Destruct to take Slowbro down. Rhydon has the luxury of being able to 3HKO Slowbro with its powerful STAB Earthquake most of the time, but will have to switch into the predicted Rest and is OHKOed by even a +0 Surf. As said, Explosion makes a good way to eliminate Slowbro, but an Explosion might not even guarantee that a full health Slowbro goes down or gets revenge killed easily due to Slowbro's already mentioned great Defense. Exeggutor's Explosion, for instance, will only hit Slowbro for around 60%. Lowering Slowbro to around 80% or forcing it to Rest first is the safest way to ensure that one Explosion is enough to let a physical attacker, such as Tauros, Golem, Rhydon, or Persian, to revenge kill it safely.</p> <p>Psychic is a STAB alternative to Surf, and trades 5 extra power for a 30% chance of scoring a Special fall. As far as type effectiveness is concerned, Psychic gains a neutral hit against Lapras and Cloyster and a super effective hit against Gengar and Victreebel, three of which are effective Slowbro checks, but loses the neutral hit against Alakazam as well as the ability to OHKO Golem and Rhydon at +0, needing two Amnesia boosts to OHKO them. Seismic Toss Alakazam, in particular, will have the opportunity to force you to Rest before Slowbro is able to get past it. Psychic's lower PP could also be a problem against users of recovery moves, especially considering that, without Surf, Alakazam will also require more time to take down. It could also be an issue if your opponent keeps using Recover or Soft-Boiled and gets lucky with full paralysis. Having 8 fewer PP could also be significant in an odd Slowbro war.</p> <p>Reflect is a possible alternative to Thunder Wave, as it doesn't change the general concept of the set, but changes the way it works in some way and some of its counters. The first thing to notice is the loss of Thunder Wave, which will be problematic in several match-ups. Unless you can paralyze Starmie with another Pokemon, it will hard counter Slowbro. Other specially based Pokemon, such as Chansey, Lapras, Gengar, and Electric-types will also become more problematic if you can't paralyze them; they will have a higher chance of scoring a critical hit Thunderbolt, as they will move first and avoid possible full paralysis. Lastly, Victreebel and Venusaur will have nothing to worry about a Slowbro lacking Thunder Wave unless its attacking move is Psychic. Letting Victreebel in for free could get especially problematic if it's packing Wrap.</p> <p>The reward of using Reflect comes from the physical side. It almost ensures that none of Snorlax, Golem, and Rhydon will have a chance to take Slowbro down due to their low critical hit rate. Tauros will have a lot of difficulties too, needing two critical hit Body Slams to beat Slowbro while it Rests. Reflect is also great for weakening Explosions, which is one of the most common and \"safe\" ways of getting rid of Slowbro; even Snorlax's Self-Destruct will only manage around 40% damage. Reflect makes double Explosions necessary to lower Slowbro to the point where it can be revenge killed, which, for the opponent, involves sacrificing at least two Pokemon.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>In a time where Mewtwo ravaged the RBY Ubers landscape and players desperately searched for a good check to it, Slowbro came to answer the call. Slowbro's Amnesia set, known as \"TobyBro\" and first created by Wintermute in the early 2000s, is the best check to non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo in the tier while being a very strong Pokemon in its own right. Amnesia, along with a great typing and excellent bulk, gives Slowbro immense sweeping potential. A boosted Surf is capable of OHKOing or 2HKOing almost everything in the tier, and even resistant foes are 3HKOed. Amnesia also helps Slowbro patch up its Electric weakness, since Special is used for both offense and defense. Slowbro can even use Thunder Wave to fix its miserable Speed, and it can also reapply the foe's Speed drops from paralysis by using Amnesia.</p> <p>However, Slowbro will take very heavy damage from a critical hit Thunderbolt regardless of boosts, forcing it to use Rest earlier, and many Electric-type Pokemon have very high critical hit rates courtesy of their high Speed. Slowbro's abysmal Speed, while mitigated by Thunder Wave, can give it trouble as it tries to boost against faster threats while also necessitating some amount of paralysis support from teammates. Slowbro is also very one-dimensional and predictable; however, it will always be one of the most dangerous sweepers, no matter how much the opponent might know it is coming.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Slowbro has the option of forgoing Thunder Wave to run any one of the following options. Withdraw is a very strong option to bolster Slowbro's Defense and allow it to take Explosions, removing a prime option for dealing with it. Withdraw also allows Slowbro to reapply paralysis Speed drops more easily. Its massive 61 PP, combined with Rest, allows Slowbro to PP stall almost any Pokemon it needs to, such as opposing Thunder Wave Slowbro. The Defense boost also lets Slowbro counter Snorlax and Mew, which would otherwise be able to hit Slowbro for decent damage. However, Withdraw Slowbro can be very passive, and teams can take advantage of that with faster threats that Slowbro cannot outspeed without Thunder Wave. Reflect is also an option, as an instant +2 in Defense can be crucial in certain situations, such as Snorlax and Tauros needing instant walling as opposed to permitting multiple turns of setup. However, lower PP, an inability to reapply Speed drops, and an inability to boost past +2 make Reflect less desirable.</p> <p>Slowbro can also run two attacks, Surf and either Ice Beam or Psychic. Ice Beam prevents Exeggutor from checking Slowbro and can freeze Mewtwo, Chansey, and opposing Slowbro. On the other hand, Psychic allows Slowbro to hit Lapras and pressure Mewtwo, Starmie, and Light Screen Chansey with Special drops. However, running two attacks makes Slowbro more reliant on paralysis support from teammates to be able to outspeed and threaten certain Pokemon like Tauros and Mew. Two attacks Slowbro also gets PP stalled by Thunder Wave Slowbro. Toxic is a niche option to win mirrors against Withdraw Slowbro, since using Rest does not reset the bad poison timer. Also, Toxic can allow Slowbro to effectively pressure and even remove Light Screen Chansey, which otherwise walls it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Zapdos, Jolteon, and Electrode all carry Thunderbolt, which can stop Slowbro from setting up easily. All three of these Pokemon also have good critical hit rates, and a critical hit Thunderbolt from any of them will OHKO Slowbro outright. However, none of them can switch into a boosted attack, and all three are devastated by paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type coverage: Non-Electric types like Starmie, Gengar, and Mewtwo can all run Thunderbolt to pressure Slowbro. All three have good critical hit rates, and a critical Thunderbolt can ruin Slowbro. Chansey can also run Thunderbolt, but it is less common; it also has a mediocre critical hit rate, meaning it struggles to pressure Slowbro after it has set up.</p> <p><strong>Water-resistant Pokemon: Exeggutor and Lapras avoid the 2HKO from +6 Surf and can put Slowbro to sleep with Sleep Powder and Sing, respectively. Lapras also carries Thunderbolt and can deal heavy damage with a critical hit. However, +6 Ice Beam OHKOes Exeggutor, while +2 Ice Beam 2HKOes it, and +4 Psychic 2HKOes Lapras, meaning you must scout for these moves before using these Pokemon to check Slowbro. In a similar vein, Victreebel and Cloyster avoid the OHKO from +6 Surf and can remove Slowbro with Wrap + Razor Leaf or Clamp + Explosion, respectively. However, a single miss of their partial trapping moves can spell doom for either.</p> <p><strong>Light Screen Chansey: Slowbro cannot 3HKO Chansey after Light Screen with +6 Surf, and it will eventually PP stall Slowbro. However, Slowbro can win the interaction if it gets lucky with a few paralysis turns. Slowbro carrying Toxic also does not fear Light Screen Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Depending on the set, Slowbro can be checked by its other sets. Thunder Wave beats two attacks sets, Withdraw beats any set besides Toxic, and Toxic always beats every other set.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Surf is very strong after a few Amnesia boosts, achieving things like a high chance to 2HKO Chansey at +6 and 2HKOs on Mew, Mewtwo, and Snorlax at +4. Amnesia is what makes this set threatening, letting Slowbro become very bulky and very powerful. Thunder Wave allows Slowbro to patch up its awful Speed and more effectively threaten faster Pokemon. This is amplified by the threat of Amnesia reapplying paralysis Speed drops. Slowbro can also use paralysis to have a chance at beating its checks, like Light Screen Chansey and Starmie. Rest allows Slowbro to stick around for much longer and ensures that a single critical hit cannot end its sweep. It also protects Slowbro from chip damage, which is likely to accumulate while switching in and boosting with Amnesia. However, a sleeping Slowbro is very easy to take advantage of, and many opponents will use it as a chance to switch in their Explosion user or Thunderbolt Mewtwo.</p> <p>When using Slowbro, it is very important to scout your opponent's team for Electric-type coverage, especially Thunderbolt on Chansey or Mewtwo. However, Chansey very rarely uses Thunderbolt in Ubers, meaning it is usually safe to set up against. Slowbro is very good at setting up against and paralyzing Mewtwo, as it takes very little damage from Mewtwo's attacks even after it has boosted, unless Mewtwo reveals Thunderbolt or gets a critical hit. Either can force Slowbro to repeatedly use Rest and allow Mewtwo to win the interaction with some luck. Slowbro itself is a very good paralysis absorber, since its pitiful Speed means it is not affected much by it. Amnesia reapplying paralysis Speed drops means even a paralyzed Slowbro can outspeed most foes after a few uses of the move. The most common way to remove Slowbro is with Explosion, so users such as Snorlax, Golem, Mew, Exeggutor, and Gengar should be watched carefully. Slowbro should be used with a good absorber of the move, such as Jynx, Rhydon, or your own Golem or Gengar. Absorbing Explosion with these Pokemon requires good prediction on when the foe is about to use the move to switch them in at the right time. Predicting wrong can result in Slowbro getting KOed or the opponent gaining momentum. Alternatively, you can choose to not reveal your Slowbro until later in the game, after the rest of your team has already dealt with opposing Explosion users.</p> <p>Slowbro especially appreciates Rhydon and Golem as Explosion absorbers, since they are immune to the Electric-type moves that give Slowbro so much trouble. However, Rhydon and Slowbro are both very slow, so using them together requires extra care. If your chosen strategy is to deal with Explosion users before revealing Slowbro, other Pokemon that attract the move such as Chansey, Mew, and Mewtwo can be used. Slowbro can struggle to beat certain checks such as Exeggutor and Lapras, so Pokemon that can deal with them, such as BoltBeam Chansey, are appreciated.</p> "

These qualities make Dodrio a solid revenge killer and late-game sweeper on offensive teams.</p> <p>However, Dodrio's defenses are extremely poor, making it take heavy damage from even neutral hits and easy to OHKO. Worse still, it lacks coverage moves, leaving it stonewalled by Rock-types like Golem and Omastar. Dodrio is a common target for paralysis due to its Speed and fragility too, making it very easy to neuter. As a result, getting Dodrio into the fray can be a difficult task without support from Wrap or smart double-switching.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Body Slam allows Dodrio to spread paralysis while hitting quite hard, 2HKOing fragile threats like Dugtrio and Kadabra. Drill Peck complements this excellently, 2HKOing Haunter, Tangela, and Venusaur, though in Tangela's case Dodrio may have to take Stun Spore to KO it. Dodrio's Hyper Beam is extremely strong, KOing even bulkier threats like Tentacruel and Hypno after a Body Slam on the switch. Finally, Agility is put in the last slot to allow Dodrio to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Should it be forced to take paralysis, Dodrio can also use Agility to ignore the Speed drop from it.</p> <p>Dodrio, as mentioned before, is extremely frail and dislikes paralysis, so it shouldn't be brought into a game early except as a lead. Lead Dodrio can be used to threaten Tentacruel and Kadabra right out of the gate, usually putting them into range for Dugtrio to KO them after Dodrio goes down. This can be huge, as Pokemon like Tentacruel and Hypno otherwise put immense pressure on teams throughout a game. However, this often means sacrificing Dodrio, which may not be favorable in the long-term. Generally, outside of the lead slot, Dodrio should play a hit-and-run playstyle before cleaning up late-game. Dodrio's two main points of entry are opposing Earthquakes and revenge killing. Its Hyper Beam is notably likely to finish off threats dented by a teammate's Explosion. Dodrio's immunity to Earthquake is especially helpful for double-switching out to Electric-types, reducing risk, and maintaining momentum. This immunity can also be utilized alongside Haunter, with its immunity to Normal-type attacks forming a small immunity core. However, repeatedly switching between them can lead to an early KO with a good prediction from the opponent. Dodrio is also good for taking advantage of threats in a passive state, such as foes using Rest, where it can set up with Agility, outspeed every Pokemon in the tier, and tear the opposing team apart with its immediate offensive presence. Furthermore, Dodrio can set up against Dugtrio or weakened physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Persian, as it forces them out with its powerful offensive capabilities. On top of that, forcing these attackers out isn't even required, as Dodrio will gladly take a hit if it means KOing the opposing Pokemon and potentially ending the game outright.</p> "

Its offensive prowess is no joke, with Body Slam + Hyper Beam 2HKOing many Pokemon in the tier, including Chansey and Starmie. With STAB Drill Peck under its belt, Dodrio has the potential to even OHKO Exeggutor with a critical hit, as well as play around Counter users like Chansey. When used alongside Tauros, Dodrio is very capable of tearing holes in the opposing team that can leave it ripe for exploitation from its teammates.</p> <p>However, Dodrio is by no means a standard, and there are many reasons why. For starters, it is extremely frail, struggling to even stomach neutral hits and being OHKOed by Zapdos, Articuno, and even Cloyster. This fragility, combined with paralysis incapacitating it, makes it very difficult to utilize outside of late-game scenarios, which many teams will struggle to facilitate. Furthermore, similar to Zapdos, Dodrio is completely hopeless against Rhydon, getting effortlessly stonewalled. Finally, like many Normal-type attackers, Dodrio is strictly outclassed by Tauros, which possesses superior coverage and Speed; ergo, Dodrio must be used alongside it. Overall, while it has merit, Dodrio's flaws make it difficult to recommend for conventional RBY OU teams.</p> ",

Drill Peck allows Dodrio to duel Gengar and Exeggutor far more effectively; it also does not enable Counter, which lets Dodrio scout users like Chansey while not losing any offensive pressure. Hyper Beam can potentially OHKO Jynx and Alakazam, as well as secure 2HKOs on Chansey and Starmie in tandem with Body Slam. With critical hit Hyper Beam, Dodrio can 2HKO any Pokemon in the tier barring Rhydon after a Body Slam. Finally, Agility allows Dodrio to outrun the entire unboosted metagame, giving it a more secure late-game sweep, while bypassing the Speed drop from paralysis.</p> <p>Dodrio's movepool is quite barren, but it has some niche options worth exploring. While it doesn't protect from status in RBY, Substitute is a viable choice to scout for free turns, such as the opponent switching or full paralysis, allowing Dodrio to stomach harder hits than it otherwise could. However, Substitute's HP cost makes Dodrio much easier to revenge kill later, cutting into its already poor bulk. Mimic is a serviceable option, giving Dodrio a potential coverage move like Earthquake to better handle Rhydon, but is extremely unreliable.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>NOTE - The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. Dewgong is generally considered unviable in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <h1>Overview</h1> <p>Dewgong’s main role in RBY UU is being the third-best purely bulky Water-type Pokemon. In terms of raw bulk, Vaporeon is simply the strongest choice. The second most prominent purely bulky Water-type Pokemon is Omastar, which holds on to relevance thanks to a resistance to Normal-type moves. Additionally, other Water-types with more diverse movepools, like Tentacruel and Poliwrath, also give Dewgong some competition.</p> <p>The two main features that make Dewgong notable are its Ice typing and superior Speed relative to other Water-type Pokemon. Being an Ice-type gifts Dewgong an impressively strong STAB-boosted Blizzard. Despite Dewgong having lower Special than its closest competitors, its Blizzard tends to deal more damage than anything they can throw out. Just a few significant calculations include a possible 3HKO against Hypno, a very likely 3HKO against Gyarados, a 2HKO on Kangaskhan, and a guaranteed OHKO against Dodrio and Dragonite. The Ice type also improves some of Dewgong’s specific matchups. Most notably, Dewgong is the hardest Articuno counter available, as it is uniquely 4x resistant to Blizzard, cannot be frozen, and forces Articuno to take heavy recoil damage over time from using Double-Edge. Dewgong’s Speed is a relevant advantage primarily because Dewgong is able to outspeed and pressure Hypno, which other Water-type Pokemon may struggle with. The Speed and freeze immunity also help Dewgong when it faces other bulky Water-type Pokemon, namely Vaporeon.</p> <p>Despite these advantages, Dewgong is held back simply because its bulk is not as good as that of Vaporeon and Omastar. Poliwrath also largely surpasses it in physical bulk. Dewgong’s matchups against stronger attackers, both physical and special, simply do not compare to its competitors. As an example, Electabuzz will always 2HKO Dewgong with Thunderbolt but can only 3HKO Vaporeon. Dewgong does not have the longevity it needs; thus, it exists mainly as a niche pick, filling slots only on teams that truly demand its particular blend of strengths and can afford its shortcomings.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dewgong lacks significant other options. It has other physical options like Headbutt and Hyper Beam, the former of which may be useful on teams focused on spreading paralysis, but it lacks the offensive presence to take full advantage of these moves. Other Pokemon, like Poliwrath, have much better physical attacks at their disposal and the Attack stat to back them up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Thunderbolt: While every major Thunderbolt user in the tier is 3HKOed or better by Blizzard, Dewgong would prefer to avoid the interaction if it can. Electabuzz and Raichu claim 2HKOs with Thunderbolt and boast high critical hit ratios to make the move even scarier. Gyarados and Haunter can consistently 3HKO Dewgong, allowing them to easily revenge kill Dewgong or KO it while it is asleep. While it has no business switching in, Dragonite can also finish off a weakened Dewgong with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Rock- and Fighting-type Moves: Dewgong’s weakness to Rock-type moves is a small but noticeable disadvantage when comparing it to other Water-type Pokemon. While neither is likely to win a clean head-to-head interaction with Dewgong, Kangaskhan and Golem claim a possible 3HKO and guaranteed 2HKO, respectively, with Rock Slide. Dewgong also has more trouble switching into Dugtrio, as both Earthquake and Rock Slide deal significant damage. Fighting-type Pokemon and moves are very rare in RBY UU, but they still can give Dewgong some trouble when they appear. Poliwrath that carry Submission are the most notable threat, as they have an 87.1% chance to 2HKO Dewgong while taking very little from all of Dewgong’s moves.</p> <p><strong>Partial-trapping Damage: Due to its largely inferior bulk, Dewgong does not stomach chip damage, especially from Wrap, very well. Tentacruel and even Dragonite can use Wrap to gradually whittle down Dewgong’s health and quickly put it into range of most fast attackers. Dewgong is worse at taking Wrap and hoping for a miss than Vaporeon and especially Omastar. While Fire Spin is not particularly common, it is worth noting that Dewgong does not resist it and is thus not a reliable check to Fire-type Pokemon like Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Venusaur: Venusaur outspeeds Dewgong and can deal over 60% damage with Razor Leaf or put it to sleep with Sleep Powder. Blizzard is obviously a frightening prospect for Venusaur, but Venusaur is the best Dewgong revenge killer in the tier and can win one-on-one if necessary.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>STAB Blizzard is one of the main reasons to use Dewgong. It is Dewgong’s strongest attack and deals remarkable damage to most non-resistant targets. Surf can hit a small pool of Pokemon harder than Blizzard and has near-perfect accuracy, which makes it a wise choice to finish off weakened targets. Ice Beam may seem redundant with Blizzard, but it can be useful in matchups against other Water-type Pokemon, for it gives Dewgong the potential to freeze them without wasting precious Blizzard PP. Body Slam is used to help spread paralysis; paralyzing common switch-ins like Tentacruel and Vaporeon can be quite useful long-term. Thanks to Dewgong's slightly higher Attack, its Body Slam also does more damage than that of Vaporeon and Omastar. For reference, the move is likely to 3HKO Kadabra. Finally, Dewgong carries Rest to improve its longevity. While not quite as defensive as others, Dewgong can still attempt to use Rest and subsequently wake up in front of Water- and Ice-type Pokemon. Switching in amidst Wrap turns is another good option to potentially burn sleep turns.</p> <p>Dewgong’s primary role is as a defensive piece. It can work as a mixed wall in a similar fashion to Vaporeon, albeit a frailer one, that can slow down offensive momentum from strong attackers like Dodrio, Persian, Kangaskhan, and, of course, Articuno. Dewgong has some offensive prowess as well. Dewgong is surprisingly good at breaking Hypno, as it outspeeds and can 3HKO with Blizzard. Likewise, most major attackers simply do not want to take STAB Blizzard. Generally, Dewgong is most valuable mid- to late-game. This way, Dewgong’s best matchup can be identified and it can be deployed accordingly. For example, it may be useful to determine if your opponent has an Articuno before you let Dewgong take on a physical attacker or attempt to freeze an opposing Water-type Pokemon.</p> "

To make matters worse, it is dominated by Gastly, which is only 4HKOed by Fire Blast and is immune to Explosion.

Thunderbolt hits Water-types and Fearow for super effective damage, notably letting Muk beat Omanyte. Fire Blast 2HKOes Pinsir while threatening Grass-types such as Vileplume and potentially burning physical attackers. It is also Muk's strongest attack against Gastly. Alternatively, Hyper Beam lets Muk OHKO Abra, meaning it need not use Explosion to KO Abra. Explosion is Muk's most powerful attack, OHKOing common threats like Fearow and Rapidash, and it deals a minimum of 72% to Nidoqueen. It also has an 84.6% chance to OHKO Porygon, which is important, since Porygon otherwise stonewalls Muk. However, it must be used carefully, as opposing Gastly, Omanyte, and Graveler can easily switch in and sponge the attack. Alternatively, the opposing player can sacrifice a weakened foe, which stops Muk from removing a crucial piece of their team.</p> <p>Mega Drain is an option to threaten Graveler, though it only 2HKOing 40.7% of the time means Muk still risks losing one-on-one. It also lets Muk beat Omanyte if it forgoes Thunderbolt. Acid Armor can let Muk survive more hits from physical attackers, especially if it uses it while they switch in, though Fearow can easily bypass Muk's boosts with its high critical hit rate, and Pinsir's Slash will always do so.</p> <p>Given that it can switch into all of Muk's moves, even Explosion, Gastly is Muk's worst enemy. Thus, Abra and Drowzee are recommended partners. Drowzee has the added benefit of checking opposing Abra, which also gives Muk a considerable amount of trouble. Graveler doesn't fear anything from Muk besides Mega Drain, so Porygon is a good partner. Earthquake users in Machamp and Nidoqueen can outspeed and 2HKO Muk, so checks to them, like Fearow for the former and one's own Machamp for the latter, can be good to handle these threats for Muk.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Cloyster is a Pokemon with coverage limited to STAB moves and Normal-type attacks, yet despite this, it has access to one of the most diverse toolsets in RBY OU. Through the use of Clamp, Cloyster can provide free switches to its teammates while also walling some of the most prominent physical threats, such as Snorlax, particularly those running Reflect, and Tauros. It possesses a reasonably powerful Blizzard, with the ability to threaten freeze on special walls, and has the option of using Explosion on Starmie to set up a Rhydon or Tauros sweep. Its part-Ice typing gives it immunity to freeze and STAB on Blizzard, at the expense of being weaker to Rock Slide. However, Cloyster has some drawbacks that stop it from being one of the top threats of RBY OU. Firstly, not being a Normal-type means it can be paralyzed by Body Slam, unlike Chansey or Snorlax. Secondly, Clamp's subpar accuracy could prove deadly to Cloyster's pretensions, especially if it's paralyzed. Lastly, it needs to rely on Rest as means of recovery, which means it's going to remain completely passive for three turns whenever it wants to recover HP.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The options listed give Cloyster the best tools to perform its roles effectively, so other options should generally not be considered. Reflect could be used in place of Clamp or Explosion to wall Normal-types even more reliably, but Cloyster loses on one of its key supporting roles when doing so and the extra bulk is generally not needed. Ice Beam is an option, though the drop in power is noticeable; most notably, Snorlax is 4HKOed instead of 3HKOed with Blizzard, but the added PP can come in handy in longer games where neither player manages to break the opponent. Toxic, when combined with Clamp, can allow Cloyster to wear down the special walls that usually threaten it with higher degrees of efficiency; however, it's difficult to justify making space for it when all of Cloyster's default moves are so valuable. Paralysis is generally very efficient at enabling Clamp chains and already present on virtually every RBY team anyway.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Starmie is the premier Cloyster counter; it takes virtually no damage from Clamp or Blizzard and is able to Recover any damage done effortlessly. It can also cripple Cloyster with Thunder Wave or do heavy damage to it with Thunderbolt or Psychic. However, it must watch out for Explosion, as it can be KOed if not at full health. Lapras or an opposing Cloyster can also completely shrug off Cloyster's attacks, and the former can threaten a powerful Thunderbolt or even Sing. It should be noted that if these Water-types are paralyzed they struggle considerably more, as Cloyster will now be faster, allowing it to use Clamp and switch out safely, with the only danger being the unlikely case of a Clamp miss coupled with lack of full paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Chansey and Alakazam can also shrug off Blizzard relatively easily thanks to their high Special bulk and easy, accessible recovery; however, if they are paralyzed, Cloyster has the option to partial trap them with Clamp to deny their recovery and switch out freely. They are also very vulnerable to Explosion, meaning that they have to tread carefully when attempting to take on Cloyster.</p> <p><strong>Electric types: Electric-types such as Jolteon and Zapdos outspeed and 2HKO Cloyster, with the latter having a small chance to OHKO. They must be wary of switching in, though, as Blizzard threatens significant damage, especially to Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro: Slowbro can switch in on Cloyster with impunity, cripple it with Thunder Wave, and start setting up on it. If it's carrying Reflect, it's even worse, as Cloyster does a measly 30% to it with Explosion after Reflect has been set up. Slowbro is even more dangerous for Cloyster if it's packing Psychic; a +4 Psychic is already more than 50% likely to OHKO Cloyster. Thus, Cloyster is forced to use Clamp and then switch out as soon as Slowbro enters the field. This is risky and predictable due to the low accuracy and imminent threat that Slowbro poses.</p> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Tauros</strong>: If Tauros chooses to run the rare Thunderbolt instead of the standard Earthquake, it can lure in Cloyster and seriously cripple it, especially if Cloyster is already caught in Rest cycles or suffers a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Victreebel</strong>: Victreebel Speed ties with Cloyster and can do at least 85% damage with Razor Leaf. However, it's a shaky check at best, as it's also 2HKOed by Cloyster's Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Though it does not particularly enjoy switching into Blizzards, Gengar does not suffer Clamp much, outspeeds Cloyster, and threatens a 2HKO with Thunderbolt. It is also able to completely nullify Explosion, though this is reliant on prediction.</p> <p><strong>Jynx</strong>: Jynx enjoys switching into Cloyster's attacks and threatening it with Psychic. It is faster, making it a good switch-in to Clamp, and can use Cloyster's weaker attacks to its advantage to wake up after a Rest.</p> ",

It also does respectable amounts of damage due to having a higher Base Power than similar moves such as Wrap as well as being boosted by STAB. Blizzard is Cloyster's best attacking option, a powerful STAB move that only Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Starmie and Lapras or special walls such as Chansey and Alakazam can handle; it also has a possibility of scoring a freeze. Explosion allows Cloyster to act as a wallbreaker once its support capabilities are no longer needed, blowing up on a Pokemon such as Starmie or Chansey and allowing a sweeper to perform its job more easily. For the third move, Rest is the the most common option by far, as it allows Cloyster to perform its walling duties much more easily. However, Hyper Beam can also be used if the team favors the possibility of doing extra damage to Chansey. It is also the best option on dedicated Wrap teams, since they can't afford to lose any momentum, but those teams tend to be inconsistent and are thus rarely seen.</p> <p>Cloyster provides unique utility to RBY teams in that it provides the user with a sturdy Tauros answer, something that very few other Pokemon in the tier can do. Therefore, despite being an excellent Pokemon to lure in and KO walls like Starmie and Chansey through Explosion, it is often best to preserve Cloyster for the later stages, until the opposing Tauros has been crippled enough for Cloyster's defensive prowess to be superfluous. However, Cloyster is not simply a late-game Tauros answer; its positive matchup against Snorlax also gives it plenty of positional utility in the early stages, especially when combined with Clamp to gain free and safe switches. Managing Cloyster's health demands making many tricky decisions: switching in on Snorlax or using Explosion on Chansey early on may seem like great propositions, but they will weaken your team against the opponent's Tauros, so it is necessary to think about your long-term plans whenever you expose Cloyster to danger.</p> "

These traits make Gastly a fantastic lead, since it can put most opposing leads to sleep and then threaten switch-ins with powerful attacks. Gastly can also switch into Normal-type moves, such as Rapidash's Hyper Beam and most of Pinsir's attacks, without taking damage, something no other Pokemon in the tier can do. However, despite its unique defensive utility, Gastly's defensive profile is quite poor due to its stats and Poison typing. Its terrible physical bulk allows most neutral physical attacks such as Fearow's Drill Peck to 2HKO it, while Gastly's low HP leaves it very vulnerable to fixed-damage moves such as Pinsir's Seismic Toss. Additionally, its terrible Ground- and Psychic-type weaknesses leave it OHKOed and 2HKOed, respectively, by every common Earthquake and Psychic in the tier. These issues are compounded by Gastly's reliance on the inaccurate Hypnosis, as a miss could mean Gastly faints without doing anything.</p> ",

Gastly's combination of high Special and immunity to Body Slam makes it the best switch-in to Omanyte, making it a great partner to Rapidash and Fearow.</p> <p>Gastly can be used as a lead, as no Pokemon can both outspeed and reliably OHKO it, almost always giving it at least one opportunity to use Hypnosis. However, given Hypnosis's poor accuracy, it prefers to switch out against leads that can outspeed and 2HKO it, such as Fearow and Abra. Gastly can also be used in the back to pivot into common Normal-type attacks such as Rapidash's Hyper Beam and Pinsir's Slash thanks to its Ghost typing. Once on the field, it can attempt to put its target to sleep with Hypnosis or pick it off if it's weakened. Gastly's typing also lets it absorb Explosions.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Gastly is one of the strongest pivots in the metagame due to its typing granting it complete immunity to numerous valuable offensive tools such as Body Slam, Hyper Beam, Slash, and Toxic. It's also one of the faster users of a sleep-inducing move in Hypnosis, which is incredibly important due to nearly every competitive team trying to spread sleep in some form. Its Ghost typing is also completely unique in the tier, allowing it to check Pinsir and Raticate; PP stall Wrap and Bind users such as Dragonair, Pinsir, and the niche Weepinbell; and pivot around the various Body Slams of the tier from the likes of Blastoise and Clefable.</p> <p>However, Gastly has some flaws that make it struggle to succeed consistently in the meta. Its typing faces issues defensively, being weak to common moves such as Psychic and Earthquake and giving it poor matchups versus numerous top-tier threats like Charizard, Nidoking, and the ubiquitous Mr. Mime. Gastly's Speed is also just not enough, leaving it outsped by all of the aforementioned threats, as well as the more notable sleepers in Venomoth and Poliwhirl. Finally, its bulk is generally quite poor, leaving it obliterated by key offensive threats like Charizard, Rapidash, and Mr. Mime once it has taken mild chip damage.</p> ",

Thunderbolt is Gastly's main attacking move, wielding chances to 3HKO or 2HKO notable Water- and Flying-types like Kabutops, Blastoise, Seadra, and Charizard. Mega Drain is Gastly's strongest move versus Golem and Kabutops, with chances to 2HKO both and recovering health in the process. Night Shade is used for consistent damage, though Psychic can be used over it or Mega Drain as a midground option that threatens Special drops and a 2HKO on Nidoking.</p> <p>Gastly's pitifully small movepool leaves little else to utilize. Explosion is the most enticing option, allowing Gastly to bring in teammates safely while dealing decent damage towards neutral threats, potentially KOing Mr. Mime after a singular Night Shade. Thunder is Gastly's strongest attack versus Blastoise, Seadra, Charizard, and Poliwhirl, 2HKOing all of them. However, its poor accuracy makes it an inconsistent option. Toxic is Gastly's most consistent check to Fire Spin users, most notably Rapidash, Charizard, and Moltres. Confuse Ray can achieve similar results as Toxic, but Toxic is a much more permanent solution to the issue and leaves Confuse Ray mostly outclassed.</p> <p>Gastly's weakness to Psychic make checks to Mr. Mime a necessity, so pairing it with Pokemon like Clefable, Porygon, and your own Mr. Mime is important. Its ability to deal good damage versus Water- and Rock-types such as Blastoise, Kabutops, and Golem makes Fire-types like Charizard, Moltres, and Rapidash potentially solid teammates, as they appreciate the support. Charizard is an especially good teammate, as it is a soft check to Nidoking and obliterates Exeggcute, both of which Gastly can struggle with. In addition to this, Gastly is a fantastic partner for Pokemon that fear paralysis from Body Slam such as Pinsir and Kingler. Gastly's access to Hypnosis also creates openings for Agility users like Dragonair and Moltres to make use of AgiliWrap strategies.</p> <p>Gastly comes in for free on opposing Poison- and Normal-type moves, most notably Toxic, Body Slam, Slash, and Wrap. This makes it one of the more effective switch-ins for Kabutops and Blastoise, as it is only 3HKOed by the former's Hydro Pump and is immune to its Slash, while the latter typically wields either Toxic or Body Slam and fails to 3HKO Gastly with Surf. This makes it an effective mid-game pivot, as its role as one of the safest switch-ins towards these Pokemon allows you to safely bring in Pokemon like Electrode that would normally fear Body Slam or force the opposing foe out with threat of a powerful coverage move or Hypnosis.</p> "

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Psychic is sometimes used for easing prediction and hitting other Poison-types like opposing Haunter. Outside of that, though, Night Shade and Thunderbolt cover the other threats it would hit. However, the Special drop can be useful for prolonged Tentacruel interactions. Should Thunderbolt's damage not be sufficient, Thunder will usually 2HKO Tentacruel and OHKO Gyarados. Mega Drain can be used to 2HKO Golem attempting to switch in on Explosion, and its recovery gives Haunter a significantly better Omastar matchup. Rest is another interesting option worth using, as it allows Haunter to work as a Dragonite check, burning sleep turns under Wrap and stalling even more Wrap PP.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dugtrio: Dugtrio is faster than Haunter, immune to Thunderbolt, and OHKOes with Earthquake, making it a premier counter to Haunter. However, it can't switch into Night Shade repeatedly and greatly fears Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Kadabra is a serious threat to Haunter, especially in lead situations. While it's 3HKOed by Night Shade and even OHKOed by Explosion, Haunter is outsped by it and 2HKOed by its Psychic. Generally, the only way Haunter can win is by landing Hypnosis or Explosion. Hypno can 2HKO Haunter using Psychic while taking very little from any move Haunter can throw at it. The only way Haunter can KO Hypno is by using two Night Shades on the switch and then Explosion. It should be noted that Kadabra and Hypno always run Thunder Wave as well, which will cripple Haunter for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Golem: Golem is immune to Thunderbolt, Haunter's main attacking move, and can very easily absorb its Explosion. To make matters worse, Golem's Earthquake is a clean OHKO. However, should Haunter choose to carry Mega Drain, it 2HKOes Golem on the switch while recovering over 70% of its HP.</p> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: While utilizing Haunter's Normal immunity to check Kangaskhan sounds enticing, Kangaskhan’s Earthquake is a 2HKO. Haunter can't win one-on-one, but Kangaskhan dislikes Hypnosis, critical hits, and repeated hits as it switches in, the latter two exploiting its mediocre special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Electabuzz</strong>: Electabuzz often carries Psychic, and, since it takes minimal damage from Thunderbolt, it can safely win the interaction. Should battling Haunter head-on be unfavorable, Electabuzz can paralyze it with Thunder Wave at minimum. However, Haunter can trade with Explosion.</p> ",

          "description": "<hr /> <h1>Outdated Analysis</h1> <h1>Overview</h1> <p>Haunter is the sole viable Ghost-type in RBY UU and has some fairly unique traits that make it a solid threat in the tier. For starters, Haunter is the fastest sleep inducer in the tier, which lets it work as a lead or early-game threat and gives it ample opportunity to disable a threat for what could be the rest of the game. This Speed also allows it to outrun threats like Articuno and Gyarados while leaving sizable dents in their bulk. Its immunity to Normal-type attacks makes it a solid Persian check and decent counterplay to Wrap in the form of PP stall. PP stalling Wrap works especially well if Haunter is paired with Pokemon like Omastar and Golem, as they resist it. Haunter's Poison typing also comes into play here, as being immune to Toxic means it can't take poison damage during Wrap chains from threats like Dragonite. In addition to this, its Poison typing grants it a valuable role as a check to Venusaur and Tangela, being merely 5HKOed by Razor Leaf and taking minimal damage from Mega Drain. Haunter has a workable special movepool as well, with options such as Thunderbolt and Psychic making it fairly flexible. The prized Thunderbolt is of particular note, allowing Haunter to act as a pseudo-Electric-type for a team, breaking through the powerful bulky Water-types of the tier. Overall, Haunter works well as a defensive pivot but can go on the offense just fine as well.</p> <p>However, Haunter is extremely frail on the physical side, which can be heavily exploited through its weakness to Earthquake. Prominent physical attackers such as Dugtrio and Kangaskhan carry Earthquake frequently, which can make switching in significantly less safe. In addition, Haunter's Speed is a bit below what's desirable, leaving it slower than the ever-present Tentacruel. Haunter's Speed is further compromised by paralysis, which causes it to be outsped by threats like Kangaskhan and reduces its consistency with Hypnosis.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Hypnosis lets Haunter put foes to sleep right out of the gate, which can essentially be a KO should the right threat be hit. Night Shade 3HKOes Dugtrio, Kadabra, and opposing Haunter, which makes it a bit more difficult for them to switch in and check Haunter repeatedly. Thunderbolt 3HKOes common Water-types like Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar. Once Haunter has taken too much damage or has been paralyzed, it can use Explosion to try and take a Pokemon down with it, which notably OHKOes Kadabra and potentially Dugtrio.</p> <p>Haunter can work early-game, sleeping a threat and likely taking out another Pokemon with Thunderbolt or Explosion. Once Haunter has entered the game, it should put a foe to sleep as soon as possible, disabling a part of the opposing team for what could be the rest of the game. However, Haunter isn't strictly relegated to early-game duties, especially because it stops Persian and checks Tentacruel and Agility + Wrap Dragonite. Even though Haunter takes no damage from Wrap against Pokemon like Tentacruel and Dragonite, it is still immobilized. This gives the opponent an opportunity to switch into a strong physical attacker like Dugtrio, which forces Haunter to switch out or get KOed, putting a large amount of strain on the team's defensive integrity. Being immobilized by Wrap isn't inherently bad, though, as the foe loses PP, can't make concrete progress, and gives you an opportunity to predict their switch-in with one of your own. Pairing Haunter with Flying-types like Articuno can create a solid immunity core; Haunter can pivot into Normal-type attacks, and it can switch back to the Flying-type partner if it is threatened by Earthquake, keeping momentum. Once a threat is at around half HP, Explosion can usually take it out, which should be considered when Haunter is on its last sliver of health. Even if Explosion fails to KO, a heavy dent can let threats like Persian and Articuno push the advantage.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>At first glance, Gengar appears to be a dangerous special sweeper thanks to its high Special Attack and Speed. However, Gengar's main role is to directly switch into Normal-type attacks like Body Slam, Hyper Beam, and Explosion as well as hard wall Wrap users and Persian because of its rare Ghost typing. It is also the fastest sleep inducer in the game with Hypnosis and can hit everything in the metagame for neutral damage thanks to Night Shade. From there, it can chip the foe with consistent damage or dent defensive switch-ins with Explosion. While all of these attributes are extremely appealing, keep in mind that Gengar has its fair share of shortcomings. For example, Hypnosis has shaky accuracy, so if it misses, it leaves Gengar open to attacks or being afflicted with status itself. Despite its great Ghost typing making it immune to Normal-type attacks, Gengar's secondary Poison typing leaves it weak to common coverage moves like Earthquake and Psychic, which most Pokemon in OU carry. Its rather weak defenses and defensive typing on top of Hypnosis's shaky accuracy cause Gengar to compete with Exeggutor and Jynx as a sleep inducer, but Gengar is much faster than both of them and not as vulnerable to Blizzard and Explosion.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Drain can be used to 2HKO Rhydon and Golem after Gengar puts them to sleep. Keep in mind that this only works if Gengar lands a Hypnosis or on a predicted switch, as Earthquake from these two will OHKO Gengar, and Mega Drain has little utility outside of this role. Confuse Ray can make Gengar more annoying to deal with, especially against paralyzed foes like Alakazam. Counter seems like an odd choice, since Gengar is already immune to Normal-type attacks. However, if Gengar comes in after your opponent uses Explosion, and if you can predict the opponent bringing something in that Gengar forces out, Counter will heavily dent something on the switch. Submission can be used to deal more damage to Chansey, especially after it has been put to sleep. Seismic Toss is an alternative to Night Shade, as it has 8 more PP at the cost of leaving Gengar susceptible to Counter. Hyper Beam is a decent option to pressure a paralyzed Alakazam or Jynx, as Gengar can really only use Explosion successfully on these Pokemon. Psychic can be used to get Special drops to reduce the Speed of paralyzed foes even further and allow paralyzed Pokemon of yours to outspeed them. It could also be decent against Rest variants of Snorlax trying to stall Gengar. In both instances, however, Thunderbolt usually does enough damage to these Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon: Alakazam is one of the best ways to stop Gengar, as it is faster, can cripple Gengar with Thunder Wave, and can use Psychic to always 2HKO Gengar. Alakazam does have to be cautious if Gengar uses Explosion, as it has a chance to OHKO Alakazam. Exeggutor can thwart Gengar thanks to its own Sleep Powder and Psychic. Jynx can also be an issue; Gengar does outspeed it, but Jynx can inflict heavy damage if Gengar misses Hypnosis, meaning it may need to use Explosion to do anything to Jynx.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey can force Gengar out because it usually carries Thunder Wave to paralyze it and can take any attack from Gengar barring Explosion on a critical hit. A healthy Chansey does have to be cautious of Hypnosis, however.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon and Golem</strong>: Rhydon and Golem threaten Gengar because they are immune to Thunderbolt, resist Explosion, and can OHKO it with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Even though it's immune to Body Slam, Gengar absolutely does not want to be paralyzed by Thunder Wave. Starmie, Zapdos, and Jolteon are some of the Pokemon that can carry the move.</p> <p><strong>Tauros: Tauros Speed ties with Gengar and can 2HKO it with Earthquake. However, Tauros has no form of recovery and generally doesn't like switching into attacks.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax takes very little damage from Gengar's Thunderbolt, and Earthquake threatens to 2HKO in return.</p> ",

Night Shade hits every single Pokemon in the metagame for 100 damage, providing important chip damage on Pokemon like Exeggutor, Rhydon, and Chansey. Thunderbolt is used mainly to hit Water-types such as Starmie, Slowbro, and Lapras for a decent amount of damage while doing the most damage to Snorlax and Tauros outside of Explosion. Explosion should primarily be used against Pokemon that Gengar can have issues beating, such as Alakazam and Chansey.

Gengar can also directly switch into and counter Wrap users such as Victreebel and Dragonite without Thunder Wave, making them much less annoying. Once a foe is asleep, Gengar can switch out to a teammate that can better handle the sleeping threat, or it can proceed to chip the foe down with Night Shade. Gengar should try to stay healthy throughout the match so it can take on Normal-types much more easily. If Gengar's health is low, it can be a good idea to use Explosion, as this move does considerable damage to anything that doesn't resist it and has a chance to OHKO Alakazam. Explosion can also severely dent a threat that Gengar's team may struggle with, making it much easier to deal with. Gengar can also function as a solo sweeper, as Thunderbolt has decent neutral coverage and can break certain sleep absorbers such as Starmie.

This way, another sleeper in the back won't have to worry about a paralyzed foe blocking their sleep-inducing move.</p> <p>Gengar can fit on a myriad of teams thanks to its unique attributes, but that doesn't mean that it can sweep entire teams without support.

      "overview": "<p>Gengar possesses the best Speed of any sleeper in the game, a unique Normal immunity, and the coveted Explosion. It outpaces relevant threats like Jynx, Mew, and Zapdos, allowing it to cripple them with Hypnosis before they can threaten it in return. Gengar's Normal immunity carries substantial utility, letting it absorb the plentiful Explosions in the metagame for free and walling Mew and Snorlax sets carrying only Normal-type moves. Additionally, it can come in handy against Persian and Wrap users like Dragonite and Victreebel, though these Pokemon do not see much use. Gengar can use its own Explosion, armed with a fearsome 21.47% critical hit rate, to significantly damage anything that is not Rock- or Ghost-type, making problematic foes simpler to dispatch and enabling offensive teammates like Mewtwo to make progress. Aside from this, Gengar packs Night Shade to do decent, consistent damage to all Pokemon and a powerful Thunderbolt to threaten Water-types like Slowbro.</p> <p>Gengar is hindered by its inconsistency—it has to rely on Hypnosis's low accuracy, and this is exacerbated by its poor physical bulk and unfortunate weaknesses to Psychic and Ground. Moreover, while Gengar is immune to Body Slam and thus its paralysis chance, other moves like Thunder Wave and Stun Spore can still cripple it, preventing it from outpacing naturally slower Pokemon and paralyzed Mewtwo and threatening them with Explosion. After Gengar gets off sleep, it can't do much to Rhydon and Golem unless it decides to drop a move for the otherwise useless Mega Drain, and it needs Explosion to threaten many other relevant Pokemon like Exeggutor, Chansey, Mew, and Mewtwo. These flaws do not outweigh Gengar's unique utilities, however, and it is a solid pick on an RBY Ubers team.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Gengar's other moves are all niche at best. Mega Drain 2HKOes Rhydon and Golem and restores some of its HP, but this move has no use otherwise, and they OHKO it with their Earthquakes, so it needs to hit them on a predicted switch-in. Confuse Ray might seem like an appealing option for paralyzed Mew and Mewtwo, as it further reduces their chances of threatening Gengar or healing off damage. Unfortunately, confusion is unreliable, it wears off after a few turns, and it can be removed by switching out. Moreover, Mew and Mewtwo can deal major damage to Gengar or cripple it with paralysis if they manage to hit it regardless. Seismic Toss has greater PP than Night Shade, but it isn't preferable, as it is subject to Counter and Gengar's lack of recovery means its PP advantage will not realistically matter.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Paralysis: Paralysis prevents Gengar from outspeeding naturally slower Pokemon and, importantly, paralyzed Mewtwo, making it more difficult to threaten with Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam and Exeggutor</strong>: Alakazam and Exeggutor threaten 2HKOs on Gengar with Psychic, and they can cripple it with their status moves. Alakazam, particularly, is faster than Gengar, has Recover to shrug off Night Shade and Thunderbolt, and is fine with being sacked to Hypnosis. Exeggutor generally does not run a recovery move, and, although Night Shade only 4HKOes it, it doesn't appreciate the damage regardless, as it pressures it into using Explosion sooner.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon and Golem</strong>: These Pokemon both OHKO Gengar and take little damage from all of its moves, aside from the niche Mega Drain. Rhydon's Substitutes survive a Night Shade, so it can set up on it. On the other hand, they would prefer not to take damage if it is not necessary, as their only option for recovery is Rest, and Golem is pressured into using Explosion earlier.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros shares its Speed with Gengar and 2HKOes it with Earthquake, with a solid critical hit rate backing it up. The two usually interact as leads, so Gengar can try to nullify it as a threat with Hypnosis, but this is dangerous, and Tauros doesn't mind taking sleep for its teammates. If sleeping Tauros is not possible, Gengar's next best option for it is Thunderbolt, which only 4HKOes.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Like Tauros, Snorlax 2HKOes Gengar with its Earthquake, but Gengar's Thunderbolt only 5HKOes it. However, Snorlax does not want to take its Explosion or be put to sleep by Hypnosis, or take chip damage in the event it is not running Rest.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew can use any of Earthquake, Thunder Wave, and Psychic to threaten Gengar, but it's outsped and it despises Hypnosis. Explosion is a major threat for it, too, as a critical hit can OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo outpaces Gengar and OHKOes it with Psychic after an Amnesia boost or with a critical hit. Mewtwo must keep away from Hypnosis at all costs, though, and it wants to avoid Gengar if it is paralyzed: Explosion will more likely than not OHKO it on a critical hit, and a regular hit is still liable to leave Mewtwo in range for other Pokemon to finish it off.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Hypnosis renders a foe almost useless. Night Shade deals consistent damage, and it's Gengar's best option against Exeggutor and Jolteon. Thunderbolt 2HKOes Starmie, Cloyster, and Slowbro. If Slowbro has boosted its Special, Gengar can switch in on its Rest and fish for a critical hit OHKO with it. Thunderbolt deals more damage to Tauros and Snorlax than Night Shade can, and a critical hit also deals more damage to Mew. Explosion lets Gengar remain relevant after it lands sleep, threatening sizable damage, preventing the victim from recovering if it is slower, and allowing one of its teammates to switch in for free and finish the victim off. A critical hit can notably OHKO Mewtwo, Mew, and Snorlax.</p> <p>Gengar is usually used as a lead, possessing favorable matchups against Exeggutor and the rare Jynx. However, Gengar stands to take severe damage from their super effective STAB Psychics or get crippled with status itself if it misses Hypnosis. It can avoid this risk against Jynx specifically by trading for it with Explosion. If paired with a backup sleeper, this can give Gengar's team room to get sleep off on a more valuable target. Explosion is generally not preferable over putting Jynx to sleep, though, as it means the team can't wall Mew or Snorlax carrying only Normal-type moves and absorb Explosions, and it can leave a more valuable teammate at risk of taking sleep itself. Gengar has worse prospects against other leads—Tauros is the most common in the metagame, and, although they share the same Speed, Tauros always carries Earthquake, which 2HKOes Gengar, or OHKOes it in the significantly likely event of a critical hit. Faster paralysis leads like Starmie and Alakazam scare Gengar out with the threat of Thunder Wave or a critical hit Psychic. If Gengar gets off Hypnosis, it can apply pressure with Night Shade or switch to a teammate that can scare the sleeping foe out. Sacking Gengar to sleep when facing a sleeper can be a wise choice—it can still take advantage of its Normal immunity asleep, and its good Speed means it is more likely to be useful if it wakes up later in the game. It should be noted that Gengar's presence on a team can dissuade opponents from using moves like Body Slam and Explosion. This can make predicting these moves and switching it in risky, as many Pokemon using these moves also have the coverage moves necessary to hit it for severe damage.</p> <p>Gengar's Explosion can help its partners make progress against the opposing team, but there a few points to consider before using it. First of all, the opponent's movesets on Mew and Snorlax should be scouted beforehand; if they carry only Normal-type moves, sacrificing Gengar makes them much more threatening. It is also important to check for any Ghost- or Rock-types such as other Gengar, Rhydon, and Golem, as they can render Explosion useless by switching in on it. Even if these Pokemon aren't present, sleeping or frozen Pokemon are often used to take Explosion, as they are not likely to be useful otherwise.</p> <p>Gengar appreciates backup sleepers to compensate for its unreliability. Exeggutor pairs well with it thanks to its resistances to Ground and Psychic and fair bulk. It can switch into Earthquake from lead Tauros and land sleep in Gengar's stead, while Gengar can break through certain threats Exeggutor has trouble with, like Slowbro and Starmie. Sing Chansey and Jynx take little damage from Psychic and can block sleep moves from the opposing team if they get paralyzed on the switch. In addition, they have Ice-type coverage to hit the Pokemon that wall Gengar. Chansey has instant recovery and Thunder Wave, letting it remain useful throughout the game, while Jynx is the next fastest sleeper after Gengar. They benefit from Gengar's immunity to Normal, especially Jynx, as its reliance on Rest for recovery can lure in physical threats like Mew and Snorlax. Offensive threats often work well alongside Gengar. Slowbro is another Pokemon that resists Psychic, and it OHKOes Rhydon and Golem with its unboosted Surf. It profits nicely from having Gengar as a teammate, as it tends to draw in Explosions and has difficulties dealing with other Water-types. Articuno and Zapdos are immune to Ground, and Gengar's immunity to Body Slam gives them room to come in safely through double switching. Articuno blasts through Rhydon and Golem, while Zapdos performs better against Chansey and has Thunder Wave to paralyze Pokemon that switch into it, like Mewtwo. Tauros can clean up foes that are put to sleep by Hypnosis and threaten anything that walls Gengar. In return, Gengar's Explosion can put Pokemon in its KO range and provide it an opportunity to switch in.</p> "

Having an Attack stat lower than Oddish means that Onix does pitiful damage and struggles to break through anything, even targets that are weak to its STAB moves. Bind is already an unreliable option due to its terrible accuracy, but it suffers further due to Onix's mediocre Speed, which notably leaves it outsped by Nidoqueen. Onix's huge Defense is held back by its atrocious base HP and weakness to Earthquake, which makes it lose to most physical attackers regardless. Its special bulk fares even worse, as its low HP, even worse Special, and weaknesses to Water, Grass, and Ice make it lose to nearly every special attacker in the tier. Notably, Nidoqueen's Blizzard OHKOes it 97.4% of the time.

      "overview": "<p>Hypno has the best typing in RBY, serviceable base stats, and the uncommon ability to spread both sleep and paralysis through Hypnosis and Thunder Wave. While these qualities are good in a vacuum, Hypno is unfortunately outclassed by the most dominant Psychic-types in the tier; Starmie and Alakazam have Recover, while Exeggutor has Explosion, giving all three great options to play out of potentially difficult situations. Hypno, meanwhile, is stuck with Rest as its only recovery option and no way to match or break through its Psychic-type cousins in most scenarios. This means that Hypno struggles both defensively and offensively in practice, failing to find real defensive niches and to threaten much more than Thunder Wave on its Psychic-type foes.</p> <p>Hypno's niche mostly exists alongside these superior Psychic-types, rather than in their place, offering unusual options its competitors lack or struggle to combine. For example, one may use their Exeggutor to lure a paralyzed target into blocking its Sleep Powder, KO it with Explosion, and then follow up with Hypno's Hypnosis for easy sleep. However, there are two use cases for Hypno as a primary Psychic-type that are worth mentioning. Hypno is better than either Jynx or Exeggutor at sleeping a foe, spreading paralysis, and later absorbing sleep thanks to its decent Defense, which allows it to run Rest without being overwhelmingly punished, thus potentially healing its own paralysis so that it may absorb sleep at a later point. Jynx struggles with using Rest due to its terrible Defense, while Exeggutor struggles because of Ice-type moves breaking its Rest cycles. Hypno's diverse toolkit also includes oddball moves such as Submission, which allows for more pressure on Chansey than the other Psychic-types can usually offer, and it can lead to some extremely favorable scenarios with some lucky paralysis and critical hits. These advantages are incredibly specific and marginal, though, so Hypno is nothing more than a fringe pick in RBY OU.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hypno can run a moveset of Hypnosis / Thunder Wave / Reflect / Rest, preferably as a lead. It allows Hypno to land Hypnosis, then paralyze any potential switch-ins, and then simply sit in place with Reflect and Rest until the opponent gives in and puts it to sleep, activating Sleep Clause to keep all its teammates safe. However, should this plan not come to fruition, this set can become entirely useless. Other Reflect + Rest sets can also exist, as these moves make Hypno generally hard to take down, but it will generally struggle with making progress due to Hypno's lackluster offense.</p> <p>Submission allows Hypno to break through Chansey with some luck between full paralysis and critical hits. However, it is pretty much useless otherwise, and the recoil will leave Hypno significantly weakened even if it cripples or KOes Chansey. Nevertheless, due to Chansey's omnipresence, it can be viable to lure it in and break through it with some consistency.</p> <p>Hypno has access to Meditate, Body Slam, and Hyper Beam, which can theoretically help it break through its Psychic-type walls, but in practice it takes far too long to set up and will usually get KOed before dealing any significant damage. If it elects to run just Meditate + Body Slam or Hyper Beam + Reflect + Rest, then it won't be KOed too quickly, but it also won't be able to break through a vast number of foes, including Gengar, Rhydon, and Reflect Snorlax. Headbutt's 30% flinch chance can give Hypno odds to break through foes in the long run, but it comes at the cost of Base Power.</p> <p>Hypno can use Toxic in conjunction with Rest to try and defeat its Psychic-type walls through extremely passive stalling, something that standard Hypno cannot achieve by any other means. However, Toxic has proven to be a generally unsuccessful strategy at high level play, with only occasional appearances and no results to write home about.</p> <p>Counter can be used to try and catch Snorlax and Tauros, but Hypno already struggles for moveslots, and spending one for Counter generally leaves it much less useful in the long term, banking almost its entire utility on the ability to land one Counter.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types with Recover: Starmie and Alakazam are unthreatened by Hypno's entire movepool bar Hypnosis. Hypno is able to cripple them with Thunder Wave, but it is pretty much forced to switch out immediately after, as it has no prospects in a one-on-one matchup without an extremely unlikely run of Psychic Special drops.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types with Rest: While they do not handle Hypno quite as comfortably as Psychic-types with Recover, Rest Jynx, Slowbro, and Exeggutor can generally stop it from making progress, especially if Hypno lacks Seismic Toss. Because Hypno will force them into passivity for a few turns, they are not quite as efficient as other checks. Slowbro deserves a special mention due to its ability to set up with Amnesia against Hypno.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: While it has to respect the potential for Submission, Chansey is entirely happy against any other Hypno set, and even when Hypno is running Submission, misses and recoil can often lead to its demise.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: While not as frail as other Psychic-types, Hypno is still not physically bulky enough to shrug off attacks from the likes of Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros, unless it is running the rare Reflect. All of these Pokemon can trade hits favorably against Hypno, especially if it ever attempts to use Rest.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Hypno's main draw is Hypnosis, as it incapacitates a Pokemon in a single turn, possibly making one would-be counter into nothing more than a momentum sink. The second best option against these counters is Thunder Wave; this won't help Hypno break through them much, but it will at least enable its teammates to do so. A number of options contest the fourth moveslot: Seismic Toss is the most common and appealing, as it is Hypno's best bet at pressuring Psychic-types. Rest allows it to stick around for longer, shrugging off weaker attacks from many special attackers, though it can be difficult for Hypno to wake up in the presence of strong physical attackers such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon.</p> <p>Hypno's toothlessness against Alakazam and Starmie can most easily be addressed by an Explosion teammate that can lure and remove them—Exeggutor being by far the most reliable, though Gengar can also lure in the former. Once either is removed, Hypno's sleep and paralysis can actually significantly improve one's odds in the endgame. Endgames are usually left for Pokemon that are very dangerous but also very fragile, such as tier icon Tauros, for which Thunder Wave is often a death sentence. Alternatively, if one really needs to cripple Alakazam, Starmie, or Chansey for a teammate, Hypno's strong Psychic will most often force players to expose one of those three targets to its Thunder Wave, which can be very useful for specific teammates trying to break through them. Ultimately, though, this is no different from Alakazam's ability to force Thunder Wave onto special sponges, and Alakazam outclasses Hypno in most scenarios, so make sure you have further reasons to select Hypno—such as Hypnosis—if your primary goal is to paralyze special sponges.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. The most up to date moveset for Hypno is the following.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hypno has a boundless movepool that grants it numerous alternative options; the problem is fitting them onto its stacked moveset. Oftentimes, Seismic Toss or Rest is dropped, but this leaves gaping holes in its matchups, so players should take care when reviewing them. Thunder Wave can also be dropped on the Hypnosis set to run Seismic Toss without dropping Psychic, though this greatly limits how well Hypno can spread status through the opposing team and leaves it helpless against Dragonite if Sleep Clause Mod is active.</p> <p>Counter is a viable move choice, as Hypno has a variety of targets where it can be effective: opposing Kadabra and Hypno especially, which commonly try to trade Seismic Tosses with it. For example, your Hypno can use Seismic Toss against Kadabra initially, and then use Counter as it uses its own for a guaranteed KO, not compromising your own at all. Counter also allows Hypno to deal significant damage to Pokemon like Dodrio, Persian, Kangaskhan, Gyarados, and the odd Clefable. It's also somewhat viable to switch Hypno in on a predicted Hyper Beam to KO the user next turn.</p> <p>Body Slam is also vaguely viable over Seismic Toss to try and paralyze Kadabra while still 3HKOing it, but it loses the 4HKO against opposing Hypno, making it quite polarizing. Experimental players may look at Meditate and attempt to run physical attacking sets with Body Slam, but these are often a fool's errand, as setting up viably is difficult and dropping another move is simply not affordable. Reflect is a somewhat viable choice for improving Hypno's matchups against Dodrio, Dugtrio, and Kangaskhan, but it fails to help at all against Persian, which can use Slash to ignore it. It also often leaves Hypno's matchups against Kadabra and opposing Hypno significantly worse.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Hypno and Kadabra: Hypno's Psychic is a very difficult attack to switch into. However, Kadabra and opposing Hypno can take that hit while doing enough damage with Seismic Toss to force it to use Rest. This grants both foes an opportunity to switch into a strong attacker or a faster Wrap user such as Tentacruel, Dragonite, Kangaskhan, or Persian. Of the two, Hypno is better as an answer, since it can absorb paralysis and fulfill its roles without issue, while Kadabra needs to avoid paralysis to remain a consistent answer to Tentacruel. However, Hypnosis can heavily exploit both Psychic-types by catching them on the switch. If Hypno is not using Seismic Toss, then Kadabra completely shuts it down, since it takes virtually nothing from Psychic while forcing Hypno to use Rest with repeated Seismic Tosses. It is worth noting, however, that Kadabra is in KO range of Persian's Slash after taking a Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Faster Wrap Users: Due to its poor Speed tier, Hypno has terrible matchups against Wrap users that are faster than it such as Tentacruel and Dragonite. It is unable to heal off damage while taking Wrap and gets chipped down into KO range either for the Wrap user itself or for one of its teammates, which can come in while Hypno is immobilized by Wrap. However, neither Dragonite nor Tentacruel switches into Hypno easily, since Hypno can catch them on the switch with Thunder Wave to turn the tides.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: While Hypno is hard to wear down, its weaker Defense stat can be exploited by heavy damage dealers such as Dugtrio, Kangaskhan, Persian, Gyarados, Dodrio, Clefable, Golem, and Dragonite. However, none of them enjoy eating a Thunder Wave—barring Dugtrio, Golem, and the occasional Clefable—or a STAB Psychic, so these attackers are best in tandem with a Psychic-type to force the Hypno to use Rest, allowing the physical attacker to come in safely and threaten to KO Hypno.</p> <p><strong>Articuno and Dewgong: Articuno can deal heavy damage to Hypno and 3HKO with its absurdly powerful Blizzard; however, it does not enjoy eating a Thunder Wave and generally needs a Psychic-type to force Hypno to use Rest so it can come in safely. Dewgong can also do threaten with Blizzard but only nets a 3HKO half the time.</p> <p><strong>Faster Users of Sleep Moves</strong>: Faster sleep users such as Haunter, Venusaur, Poliwrath, and the odd Venomoth can come in on a predicted double switch or while Hypno is asleep and threaten to put it to sleep. However, all of them are weak to Psychic and cannot switch into Hypno safely, thus requiring a Psychic-type teammate to handle Hypno defensively.</p> ",

          "description": "<hr /> <p>Hypno is a defensive centerpiece of RBY UU that warps how offensive play is executed in the tier; it's a near-automatic addition to most teams. With its great stats, phenomenal typing, and good movepool, Hypno can not only check threats, but also claw back momentum with startling efficiency. Hypno supports its team through spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave, which, due to the threat of Tentacruel locking down slower teams with Wrap, can decide games if it hits the right targets. It's also an offensive threat in its own right, with few Pokemon besides itself that can withstand its mighty STAB Psychic without taking significant damage. Furthermore, it's an effective lead that may put a Pokemon to sleep or spread paralysis. Being an effective check to both Kadabra and opposing Hypno is huge as well, ensuring teams don't crumble to their shared offensive pressure. Because of the variety of roles it fills and how well it can fill those roles, any viable team must have some plan to deal with Hypno.</p> <p>Unfortunately, due to its subpar Speed, Hypno can be easily pivoted around by common Wrap users such as Dragonite and Tentacruel, which also prevent it from healing. Additionally, Hypno's reliance on Rest for recovery can let strong attackers such as Kangaskhan, Tentacruel, Persian, Articuno, and Dugtrio exploit it, as they can come in on the turn Hypno uses Rest and begin inflicting heavy damage. Hypno's physical bulk isn't stellar either, with Dodrio, Kangaskhan, and Persian all posing a serious threat if it's caught asleep.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Hypno's Psychic is one of the hardest special attacks to switch into in RBY UU, and with Hypno's high natural bulk, it's quite difficult to do similar damage in return. This makes Hypno incredible at trading blows, and it's thus an effective early-game progress-maker. Seismic Toss reliably forces opposing Hypno to use Rest while also dealing good damage to opposing Kadabra and the few Pokemon that boost their Special stat, such as Growth Tangela. Forcing opposing Hypno to use Rest is a critical part of making progress in RBY UU, as it lets your Hypno's teammates come in and wreak havoc. Thunder Wave makes switching into Hypno an even more daunting task; the drop in Speed from paralysis is game changing in the fast-paced environment of RBY UU, as not having anything to outspeed Tentacruel can end the game on the spot. Rest gives Hypno the ability to recover health and remain a defensive piece throughout the game, especially important against enemy Hypno, and Hypno has plentiful opportunities to come in and burn sleep turns. For example, it can burn sleep turns by coming into a Tentacruel or Dragonite locked into Wrap and thus unable to do any significant damage. In addition, thanks to Hypno's high bulk, it usually only needs to burn a single turn to have enough health to wake up. Rest removing paralysis is also helpful, though it does prevent Hypno from blocking opposing sleep-inducing moves.</p> <p>Hypno effectively absorbs and spreads paralysis, acts as a key defensive piece, and deals significant damage for nearly any teammates. It's a flexible check to many threats such as Persian and Dugtrio and stifles most common special attackers in the tier, such as Kadabra, opposing Hypno, Electabuzz, Haunter, and the rare Raichu. This defensive utility in conjunction with Thunder Wave makes it the best status spreader in the tier, as it gets on the field more often than other status spreaders. Offensively, Hypno can exert immense pressure on the opposing team, as little else outside of Kadabra, opposing Hypno, Vaporeon, and Articuno can take more than a few hits without being KOed. Even Wrap users like Tentacruel and Dragonite feel uncomfortable staying in on Hypno for too long, fearing taking a Psychic or Thunder Wave if they miss.</p> "

Whatever move it drops for Hypnosis will stop Hypno from doing everything at once, but the immense value of landing sleep is enough to make this set a very viable and successful build.</p> <p>Hypnosis Hypno is primarily used as a lead to immediately put a foe to sleep, giving your team the initiative thanks to its positive matchups against other leads, such as Electabuzz and Kadabra, particularly if running Rest in the latter case. However, it does have a shaky matchup against Tentacruel, as its low Speed cedes the initiative to the Tentacruel user and makes it harder to force in and sleep enemy Hypno, though the benefit of paralyzing an enemy Tentacruel if it misses Wrap is significant. It can be used outside of the lead slot for shock value, however, which can outright win simplified game states.</p> <p>Psychic ensures Hypno remains an offensive threat, making use of its remarkable Special while gaining offensive momentum with Special drops; this guarantees a better matchup against Normal-types like Kangaskhan and allows for significant damage against Tentacruel. Seismic Toss, while less common on this set, is Hypno's best bet against Kadabra and opposing Hypno, allowing it to trade blows well and have more defined early-game progress routes. It should be noted that dropping Psychic will make Hypno much easier to switch in on, especially for Vaporeon and the uncommon Golem, which aren't concerned about Thunder Wave. Rest allows for more mileage throughout a game, but it can be dropped to run both offensive options instead, wherein Hypno takes the more active role of trading with opposing Psychic-types. This aggressive playstyle does come at the loss of much defensive utility, however, and should be kept to hyper offensive teams that want to keep up momentum.</p> "

At +2, Hyper Beam can OHKO much of the tier, including threats like Mr. Mime, Raticate, and Venomoth, and nearly KO anything except Rock-types. Additionally, Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam will KO any Normal-neutral foe at +2. Rock-types are washed away by Crabhammer, a powerful STAB move that will almost always score a critical hit. It easily OHKOes Golem and 2HKOes Kabutops, coming just short of OHKOing Charizard and Ninetales. Kingler also has decent physical bulk, avoiding 2HKOs from some strong physical attacks such as Golem's Earthquake and opposing +2 Kingler's Body Slam. Due to its power and bulk, Kingler often forces switches and can fish for paralysis with Body Slam as opponents react to a potential Swords Dance sweep.</p> <p>However, Kingler is very slow for RBY NU, outsped by a myriad of prominent offensive threats.

Also, even neutral special attacks such as Mr. Mime's Psychic 2HKO it.

Body Slam is a very powerful attack after a boost and threatens switch-ins with paralysis, which helps Kingler sweep and support its team. Hyper Beam is an outstanding finishing move, dealing massive damage to almost anything and outright OHKOing frailer foes at +2. Crabhammer hits Rock-types, complementing Kingler's physical damage output, and removes Fire-types after mild chip or Body Slam.</p> <p>Kingler's low Speed means it highly appreciates paralysis support from teammates such as Mr. Mime and Clefable. Kingler also appreciates teammates that can switch into Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt, such as Golem and Nidoking. Early-game, Kingler can wallbreak with Crabhammer and spread paralysis with Body Slam. It appreciates opportunities to enter the field against Charizard, Golem, and Blastoise, preferably as a revenge killer rather than switching into attacks, then using Body Slam, Crabhammer, or Swords Dance to remove one or two major threats, paving the way for its allies to sweep. If Kingler is saved for late-game, when the opponent's team is weakened and paralyzed, and sent in to revenge kill a foe lacking paralysis, it can easily use Swords Dance to sweep. Whether wallbreaking or sweeping, Kingler will want to stay and fight until it drops unless it has a safe switch and is still healthy. Kingler users should note the state of the opponent's team and whether significant checks like Mr. Mime remain healthy to decide whether to set up or use its raw power.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Kingler should generally not run any other moves than the four listed in the set. Stomp is much weaker than Body Slam and makes Kingler even more reliant on its team to spread paralysis. Blizzard only hits the relatively niche Exeggcute effectively, 2HKOing it but giving up far more relevant moves. Similarly, Surf's accuracy may sound appealing, as it still OHKOes Golem, but this makes Kingler unable to stop Fire-types and Kabutops. Substitute is held back by Kingler's bad Special, and does not address Kingler's weakness to Thunder Wave.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Attacks: Electrode, Nidoking, and Mr. Mime outspeed Kingler and can 2HKO it with Thunderbolt, with Electrode even having a chance to OHKO bolstered by its high critical hit rate. Clefable is slower than Kingler and takes heavy damage from boosted Body Slam, but it can paralyze and 2HKO Kingler and does not fear Body Slam paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Thunder Wave users such as Clefable and Mr. Mime can dash any chance of Kingler sweeping late-game. Getting paralyzed means Kingler can no longer outspeed some of the slowest Pokemon in RBY NU or outspeed faster paralyzed foes.</p> <p><strong>Faster Special Attackers</strong>: Kingler's poor Special means even moderately strong special attacks like Mr. Mime's Psychic 2HKO it. Even Moltres's Fire Blast, which Kingler resists, will always 3HKO it. Its low Speed exacerbates this issue, as it can't outspeed most of the threats that threaten to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Burn: Kingler, as a Water-type, may eventually need to switch into Fire Blast, which has a 30.1% chance to burn. A burned Kingler must use Swords Dance to negate the Attack drop but can at least use Crabhammer unhindered.</p> "

This gives Kingler cataclysmic wallbreaking potential, outright OHKOing Chansey given the chance. It also has exclusive access to Crabhammer, which will nearly always land a critical hit, largely making up for its mediocre Special. Kingler isn't exactly slow relative to RBY OU either, being just above Cloyster and Victreebel. This means it isn't completely reliant on paralysis support and is very capable of mowing down teams without it. Overall, while an uncommon threat, Kingler is very capable of running over weakened teams if given a mere turn to set up. Even if it doesn't get a full sweep, the holes Kingler can tear in a team can be more than enough for its teammates to finish the job.</p> <p>So why isn't Kingler often seen on the big stage, fighting tooth and nail with Kanto's finest? Kingler's sweeping prospects are swiftly put down by paralysis, and this weakness often forces it out, causing it to forfeit any Swords Dance boosts it may have gained beforehand. Kingler's special bulk is also a pressing issue, with even neutral hits like Alakazam's Psychic 2HKOing it. Furthermore, its weakness to Electric-type attacks makes Pokemon like Starmie a royal pain, often causing it to be KOed even at around 75%. These factors make it deceptively difficult to find an opening for Kingler to sweep, and it therefore requires an experienced player to be successful.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Generally, Kingler should never drop any move other than Body Slam, and even this is very difficult to justify.

Furthermore, Gengar has ample opportunity to switch in on Kingler's Normal-type attacks and force sleep on the player's team, as it's immune to them.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos can switch into Hyper Beam or Crabhammer and subsequently OHKO Kingler with Thunderbolt; for Kingler to win, Zapdos has to have been chipped and paralyzed prior, and even then, it requires a +2 Hyper Beam. Much of the same applies to Jolteon, although it is OHKOed by a +2 Hyper Beam and takes very high damage from Body Slam. Furthermore, if Jolteon is asleep, it is nothing more than setup fodder for Kingler.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Kingler is thoroughly debilitated by paralysis, as it can no longer mow down paralyzed teams and its poor special bulk becomes much more apparent. The threat of paralysis can make setting up with Kingler quite difficult, as it's very possible for Kingler to be paralyzed on the turn that it attempts Swords Dance. Pokemon like Exeggutor and Zapdos can easily switch in and threaten it with their paralysis-inducing moves, forcing Kingler out if it can't KO them first. Paralysis from Body Slam can be a particularly depressing experience for any Kingler player, especially when attempting to wrestle down Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros, so this warrants consideration in prolonged interactions. Pokemon like Lapras and Victreebel become much better Kingler checks if it's paralyzed, as they can outspeed and KO it with super effective hits without fear of Hyper Beam. Reflect Chansey can also be problematic, as it effectively invalidates Kingler's Swords Dance boost and threatens it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Faster Special Attackers: Kingler is extremely frail specially, which makes many special attackers suitable Kingler checks, especially when attempting to revenge kill it. Switching these Pokemon in on a Swords Dance can put Kingler into a fairly awkward position as well. Alakazam and Starmie can paralyze Kingler while threatening it with 2HKOs from their strong special attacks. In fact, even Tauros and Chansey can adapt with Thunderbolt to 2HKO Kingler. However, few of these Pokemon want to actually be attacked by Kingler themselves; if they are paralyzed and Kingler has set up, with the exception of Tauros and sometimes Starmie, these Pokemon can be OHKOed by +2 Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Foes: While a +2 Hyper Beam from Kingler is strong, there are Pokemon that can handle it surprisingly well while paralyzing it in return. Slowbro can switch in and paralyze Kingler and doesn't mind stomaching a +2 Hyper Beam if it means stopping a sweep. However, a +2 Body Slam followed up by Hyper Beam has good odds to KO Slowbro. Lapras can easily take a Hyper Beam from Kingler while threatening with Thunderbolt afterward. Exeggutor can also take most hits Kingler can throw at it and threaten with status or a 2HKO from Psychic, though it can take massive damage in the process—or even get KOed if it has taken prior damage—if Kingler has boosted with Swords Dance. Finally, if push comes to shove, Cloyster can switch in and use Explosion, though it can't do anything else lest it become setup fodder.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Swords Dance is Kingler's claim to fame, allowing it to boost its Attack and wreak havoc. Using it also allows Kingler to reapply a foe's Speed drop from paralysis, which helps if Kingler has been paralyzed itself. +2 Hyper Beam can OHKO Chansey, Jynx, Jolteon, and Alakazam. It can also OHKO Starmie and Victreebel 30.8% and 56.4% of the time, respectively. The rest of the tier isn't far behind, with foes often crumbling if even a third of their HP has been chipped off. Body Slam lets Kingler deny switch-ins by the threat of paralysis, allowing it to be more self-sufficient rather than mandating team support; if a Pokemon is paralyzed on the switch after Kingler has boosted, a +2 Hyper Beam will likely follow for the KO. Crabhammer allows Kingler to OHKO Rhydon and 3HKO Gengar, the latter of which is immune to Kingler's other attacks, making Crabhammer valuable to prevent it from repeatedly switching in. It also allows Kingler to 3HKO Snorlax 87.2% of the time, allowing it to muscle past Reflect sets. It should be noted that Crabhammer isn't just some better Slash, though; it has some very unfortunate accuracy issues, and a single miss will most likely be Kingler's undoing.</p> <p>Kingler should be kept until late-game when the opposing team has been weakened or riddled with paralysis. This gives it the best chance of setting up successfully and serving as a wincon. If an entire team has been paralyzed, Kingler will happily take a hit if it means blowing the opposition away. Finding an opportunity to set up can be difficult, though; the best way is to punish a Pokemon using Rest, such as Snorlax or Jolteon. However, simply exploiting weakened, paralyzed Pokemon also gives a worthy payoff. Kingler should ideally be paired with an Electric-type like Zapdos or Jolteon, as they can beat Kingler's primary counters in opposing Electric-types, Starmie, and Slowbro. More offensively, an Electric-type is also a perfect way to lure Rhydon in for Kingler to either set up on or cleave through, which can instantly mean a win with its Electric-type ally in the back.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>With a cataclysmic Attack stat that can be boosted by Swords Dance, Kingler can function as a serviceable late-game sweeper that bullies paralyzed Pokemon. With the exclusive STAB Crabhammer, its mediocre Special is largely made up for and gives it unresisted coverage, meaning Kingler is capable of dealing with common obstacles to its sweep such as Rhydon and Gengar. Furthermore, Kingler's Speed is just high enough to pose an offensive threat, being faster than defensive presences like Cloyster, Chansey, and Snorlax. Thus, stopping Kingler from steamrolling or breaking holes in a team can be quite difficult if the stage is set.</p> <p>However, Kingler is only barely viable in Stadium OU. Hyper Beam is massively nerfed in Stadium, so its offensive capabilities are noticeably worse. Furthermore, its low Special and middling Speed mean that any strong special attacker like Alakazam or Starmie can 2HKO and revenge kill it with ease; this also makes it very difficult to switch in. A somewhat related weakness is that Kingler's frailty and Speed reliance mean it cannot afford to be paralyzed at all. Its weakness to the abundant Thunderbolt only worsens this; many users can outright OHKO it. Kingler is monumentally reliant on paralysis support, which is very hard to provide. Due to these factors, finding opportunities for Kingler to succeed is very difficult; ergo, it is generally not recommended on conventional teams.</p> ",

Crabhammer backs this up with unresisted coverage, preventing Gengar from repeatedly switching in and threatening a 3HKO. It also OHKOes Rhydon and is Kingler's best option against Tauros even at +2; it also has a high chance to 3HKO Snorlax, meaning Reflect variants can't consistently Rest stall it. Kingler's final moveslot defines its role. Double-Edge acts as a potent finishing tool, as recoil is not sustained when it KOes in Stadium, including breaking Substitutes. Thus, Double-Edge makes Kingler more of a wallbreaker that can pressure Substitute users like Chansey. +2 Double-Edge also has a chance to OHKO Alakazam and 2HKO Exeggutor, which makes it a good opportunity to punish Rest. Alternatively, Substitute can be used to give Kingler safety against status and exploit resting Pokemon like Snorlax and Exeggutor.</p> <p>Kingler has a terrible movepool, but there is room for customization; usually, the fourth moveslot is the most replaceable. Stomp is the most compelling, letting Kingler fish for flinches on paralyzed Pokemon while using its strong Attack stat. Hyper Beam is technically usable at +2 for OHKOs on Alakazam, Chansey, Jolteon, and sometimes Starmie, but its forced recharge turn can completely ruin any chance of sweeping, defeating the purpose of using it.</p> <p>Kingler should be used on teams that can provide ample paralysis support, which can be a bit difficult given status protection being available in Stadium. Ideally, partners like Alakazam, Exeggutor, Jolteon, and Starmie should be used to consistently get uncontested paralysis. Jolteon is of particular note for luring in Rhydon very consistently while resisting Electric-type hits itself, thus giving it a decent Zapdos matchup. Special sponges like the ubiquitous Chansey make up for Kingler's terrible weakness to special attacks; Chansey also has access to Thunder Wave. Kingler should ideally be used when an opposing Pokemon is at its most vulnerable; paralyzed Pokemon using Recover, resting Pokemon, and those using Substitute are ample opportunities to bring it in. Generally, most of the opposing team should be paralyzed for it to be successful.</p> "

Electrode 2HKOes every single Water- and Flying- type except Moltres, and its absurd 27.34% critical hit rate allows it to often 2HKO Moltres and neutral targets like Mr. Mime and Clefable. This combined with Thunder Wave and Explosion makes it an extreme pain for many NU teams, as the most common team structures contain Charizard, Blastoise, and often a third Electric-weak Pokemon like Kabutops or Kingler. Players are forced to run Ground-types to avoid an Electrode sweep. While Electrode can have incredible matchups, others are horrendous; Electrode is walled by Ground-types and has difficulty breaking past the uncommon Exeggcute. It also becomes near-useless once paralyzed, as it loses its defining Speed advantage and has its frailty exposed. Electrode is usually limited to late-game cleanup due to its poor bulk and need to have Ground-types addressed. Electrode can create some of the most polarizing and difficult matchups in NU, either destroying the opposition with critical hit Thunderbolt or getting stopped in its tracks by a Ground-type.</p> ",

Explosion deals heavy damage to many foes, falling just short of OHKOing frail Pokemon like Mr. Mime and Raticate and respectably hitting bulky foes like Clefable and Nidoking for half or more of their HP. A critical hit Explosion is near-guaranteed to KO these Pokemon and create holes for Electrode's teammates. Electrode can choose from Thunder or Screech.

Raticate and Charizard are powerful wallbreakers that often force Golem in earlier than the opponent would like. Since so few Pokemon want to switch into Electrode, you can double switch to a Water-type to take advantage of typical answers, like Ground-types and Ninetales. Once the opponent's team has been revealed, Electrode can serve as a targeted assassin, taking out a key target like Mr. Mime to enable its allies, or it can be reserved to sweep weakened, unprepared teams lacking Ground-types.

      "overview": "<p>Electrode holds a highly specific niche in the RBY UU metagame. As the game's fastest Pokemon, Electrode is nearly guaranteed to attack before fainting if it enters the battle safely, even if it doesn't have the most diverse attacks. This Speed most notably allows Electrode to pressure quick tier mainstays like Tentacruel and Dugtrio. Its high Speed also blesses it with a 27.3% critical hit chance, which can elevate its weak attacks to extreme heights; for example, a critical hit Explosion will always OHKO Hypno. Its Speed and Thunder Wave make it an above average switch into Wrap users as well. These attributes also enable Electrode to be used as a lead or even a sweeper in some cases.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Electrode’s flaws are abundant and quite detrimental. Outside of Explosion, Electrode has very few distinctive moves for an Electric-type Pokemon. Without Body Slam or Double-Edge, let alone any diverse coverage move, Electrode is forced to use moves like Take Down just to damage Ground-type Pokemon. Electrode's offenses are also inferior to those of its main competitors, Electabuzz and Raichu. These flaws culminate into Electrode being relatively easy to wall and KO. As such, using Electrode often boils down to attacking once or twice and then trying to get lucky with Explosion. It is a high-risk Pokemon that requires accurate predictions and a little bit of luck to reap a proportionate reward.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder is an option open to every Electric-type Pokemon so they can hit a little harder at the cost of some accuracy. Two notable benchmarks for Electrode's Thunder include a possible 2HKO against Vaporeon and a guaranteed 2HKO against Tentacruel, which Thunderbolt misses and only has a 5.4% chance to do, respectively.</p> <p>Electrode has a number of defensive options such as Light Screen and Rest. These can be used to improve a few particular matchups, such as against other Electric-types. Rest is notable for curing Electrode of paralysis, which is usually fatal for it. Overall, offensive options tend to be a lot more useful.</p> <p>Substitute can be helpful on such a prediction-reliant Pokemon. For example, it can serve as a nice midground play in situations like the Dugtrio matchup. If Dugtrio switches, Electrode can attack more freely on the next turn, and if Dugtrio attacks, Electrode will suffer a smaller penalty. However, like the defensive options, it is difficult to find a spot for Substitute.</p> <p>Flash can be somewhat useful at motivating the foe to switch and can hinder Wrap users. However, Screech and Thunder Wave tend to accomplish these goals better and have superior accuracy.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-type Pokemon are pretty tricky for Electrode because they pressure it to use a weak Normal-type move or Explosion. Golem is Electrode’s worst nightmare because it takes roughly 20% from Explosion. Golem can switch into Electrode freely and repeatedly, and then fire off a free STAB attack or set up a Substitute. Electrode can threaten Dugtrio with Explosion, but Dugtrio can survive the attack two-thirds of the time and is relatively unafraid of a paralyzed Electrode.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Paralysis is a death sentence for Electrode. Electrode is incredibly reliant on its Speed, so taking that away exposes its middling defenses. Paralyzed Electrode can be easily KOed by wallbreakers and sweepers like Dugtrio, Kangaskhan, Persian, Articuno, and so on. Additionally, the 25% chance of full paralysis may also keep a weakened Electrode from using Explosion before it is KOed.</p> <p><strong>Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon: While not quite as bad as Ground-type Pokemon, Grass-type Pokemon also wall Electrode. Thunderbolt deals very little damage to Pokemon like Tangela and Venusaur, so they can goad it into using Explosion. Additionally, status moves like Sleep Powder and Stun Spore will hamper Electrode’s usefulness. Electric-type Pokemon similarly resist Thunderbolt and can paralyze Electrode. While neither really wants to take Thunder Wave, Electabuzz and Raichu have better coverage moves than Electrode, so they will generally win one-on-one or force Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Explosion: Aside from Golem, most common Rock- and Ghost-type Pokemon do not want to switch into Electrode. However, having them on a team can still make Electrode hesitate to use Explosion, into which they switch fairly comfortably.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is pretty much Electrode's only reliable source of damage. Electrode isn't the strongest user of Thunderbolt, but it can still hit common Pokemon like Tentacruel, Dodrio, and bulky Water-type Pokemon for good damage, especially if it scores a critical hit. Assuming the opponent lacks a Ground-type Pokemon, Electrode can reliably paralyze any foe thanks to its high Speed. This is particularly useful for slowing down Agility sweepers like Articuno and Dragonite. Electrode's reliance on Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave encourages Ground-type Pokemon to switch in, so it is wise to run Pokemon that can capitalize on this, such as Gyarados, Poliwrath, and Tangela. Hypno is also likely to switch in against Electrode, making fast sleep users such as Venusaur good partners as well.</p> <p>Explosion is Electrode’s main selling point. While Electrode’s base Attack stat of 50 is underwhelming, Explosion is still quite strong, especially if it happens to be a critical hit. Explosion has many desirable targets, such as Dugtrio, Hypno, Tentacruel, and Kadabra, the last of which will always be KOed. However, there are also many Pokemon that Electrode doesn’t want to hit, such as Rock-type Pokemon, sleeping and frozen Pokemon, and, worst of all, Haunter. Electrode is thus a very prediction-heavy Pokemon. As an example, suppose Electrode is face-to-face with Dugtrio. Explosion can OHKO Dugtrio, especially if Dugtrio took a little chip damage. Dugtrio will deal a minimum of 73% to Electrode with Earthquake. This creates a 50/50 situation of whether Dugtrio will switch out in fear of Explosion or stay in and hope Electrode overpredicts by using something else. Electrode creates situations like this a lot, especially if it is played in the mid- or late-game. Using Electrode effectively often means making some bold (or lucky) predictions or spending a lot of effort so these predictions aren’t necessary. This volatility can help Electrode take down some important targets with little issue but also risks it fainting for naught. If Electrode does hit its desired target, it establishes a better position for its teammates. For example, blowing up on Tentacruel or Hypno might help Articuno sweep, while hitting Dugtrio should keep Pokemon like Kadabra and Raichu safe.</p> <p>Screech helps Electrode get the most out of its Explosion. While the move may suffer from an unimpressive accuracy of 84.4%, over half the Pokemon prominent in the RBY UU metagame may or will faint to Electrode's Explosion after Screech. Not only will key offensive Pokemon like Tentacruel, Dugtrio, and Persian be guaranteed to faint, but bulkier Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Vaporeon, and Gyarados have a chance as well. This threat incentivizes foes to switch without actually forcing Electrode to blow up, allowing it to potentially use Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave uncontested or bring in a teammate more safely. Screech is also remarkably useful in situations where the foe is unwilling or unable to switch, like after it has used a stat-boosting move or when it is the last Pokemon remaining. In these cases, Electrode can be more confident that it will be able to deal large amounts of damage to its desired target.</p> <p>Despite Screech's benefits, it is still viable to run an arbitrary Normal-type attack just so Electrode can hit Ground-type foes without KOing itself. Take Down can be fairly strong with a critical hit, but it is otherwise a painfully mediocre move with low accuracy as well as recoil, and Hyper Beam, while powerful, can leave Electrode susceptible to being paralyzed or KOed if it fails to KO the foe first.</p> <p>Finally, it is worth noting that Electrode can serve as a lead. This is partially because Electrode has much trouble switching into most Pokemon. While not as consistent as more traditional choices, Electrode can break a few holes earlier in the match and help its teammates arrange a sweep by mixing up options like fast Thunder Wave, STAB Thunderbolt, and powerful Explosion. Conversely, Electrode's high Speed makes it a decent late-game sweeper as well. However, its poor coverage tends to make Pokemon like Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Agility users superior options for the role.</p> "

Its resistance to Mr. Mime's, Electrode's, and Venomoth's primary attacks makes it good support for teams otherwise vulnerable to these foes, and it minds paralysis less than most Pokemon. It also packs Explosion to heavily damage a foe on the way out and grant free entry to a deadly attacker or setup sweeper, allowing for clever positioning to set up a nice endgame sweep.</p> <p>Exeggcute's typing does, however, make it extremely vulnerable to the plentiful Fire- and Ice-type attacks in the tier. Even though it resists Earthquake, its very low Speed and lack of Grass-type STAB moves make it a mediocre Golem check, and its low Special and Ice weakness make it an extremely unreliable switch-in to Nidoking. Its physical bulk, while passable, is insufficient to avoid OHKOs from Kingler's and Pinsir's +2 Hyper Beams, leaving it unable to stop their sweeps with Stun Spore. Additionally, its low offensive stats leave it rather passive after it spreads status, and it will almost certainly get paralyzed as it tries to put something to sleep, which leaves it with an inconsistent 56% chance to actually land its status moves thereafter.

However, due to its low bulk and common weaknesses, it invites sweepers like Nidoking and Raticate and Swords Dance users like Kingler and Kabutops in, letting them throw out devastating attacks while it is asleep. It also must fear repeated Special drops from Mr. Mime, which will eventually force a switch. Double-Edge could be used to pressure Mr. Mime slightly more heavily than Psychic; however, it only threatens a 5HKO with Exeggcute's dismal Attack stat, and the move weakens Exeggcute with recoil damage. Alternatively, Egg Bomb avoids recoil damage at the cost of a poor 74.7% accuracy. Solar Beam is Exeggcute's only Grass-type attack—it threatens Kingler, Kabutops, and Golem with an OHKO and inflicts massive damage on Blastoise and Seadra. However, since the opponent can simply switch out during its charge turn, Solar Beam is only possibly useful late-game, when they might lack healthy Grass-resistant Pokemon to tank it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Blastoise and Seadra are faster than Exeggcute, aren't threatened much by its Psychic or Explosion, aren't affected heavily by paralysis, and shred Exeggcute with Ice-type attacks.

Stun Spore on the switch takes their greatest asset away, though.</p> <p><strong>Clefable and Wigglytuff</strong>: Both Clefable and Wigglytuff outspeed and 2HKO Exeggcute with Blizzard, and if they don't have that, they can 3HKO with two Body Slams followed by Hyper Beam. They are already slower than most of the tier and thus aren't harmed much by paralysis, and Psychic only 5HKOes them, letting them bully Exeggcute once Sleep Powder isn't an option.</p> <p><strong>Fearow, Raticate, and Nidoking</strong>: In a pinch, these fast offensive Pokemon 2HKO Exeggcute to win one-on-one, but all are severely hampered by paralysis, and Nidoking especially does not take Psychic well.

Psychic is Exeggcute's best attacking option and hits most Pokemon in the tier for neutral damage. Psychic's 33.2% chance of reducing Special helps Exeggcute to overcome its passiveness, breaking down even bulky foes when combined with paralysis. A Special drop also provides defensive benefits, such as preventing Blastoise and Seadra from 2HKOing Exeggcute with Blizzard and reducing even Moltres's nuclear Fire Blast to a 2HKO, giving a healthy Exeggcute the option to boldly stay in on Fire-types and debilitate them with status. Explosion allows Exeggcute to take out over two-thirds of Mr. Mime's HP, leaving it in KO range for most allies, or to deal around 50% to most foes while granting an ally free entry.

A combination of defensive utility and wallbreaking power earns Exeggutor a spot on many RBY teams; however, teams that already feature other sleepers may find it redundant, and its inability to recover damage can make it undesirable to some teams.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Exeggutor has a large movepool that can allow it to fill different roles, but none of the following options has seen high-level success in in any combination. Exeggutor can use Rest to get consistent value out of its strong Psychic and Stun Spore, as well as consistently check opposing Exeggutor, Rhydon, Alakazam, Jolteon without Pin Missile, and Blizzard-less Starmie variants throughout a game. However, this often invites in offensive behemoths like Tauros for free, which makes it very difficult to justify over conventional, standard sets. Alternatively, Egg Bomb hits as hard as Double-Edge and has no recoil, but its low accuracy makes it a generally inferior choice. Finally, Exeggutor has access to decent defensive and utility moves such as Reflect, Toxic, Leech Seed, and even Mimic, but these are often seen as strictly suboptimal.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Starmie, Alakazam, and Jynx: These Pokemon are often on the receiving end of a turn 1 Thunder Wave, which makes them solid switch-ins to Sleep Powder, although they must watch out for aggressive predictions from the Exeggutor user. Although they are not fully reliable in all situations, they are often the best available option to safely switch in on Exeggutor, and should be able to threaten it with Thunder Wave or Blizzard while keeping themselves healthy to answer it repeatedly thanks to Recover or Rest.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Exeggutor simply has no ways to consistently get through Chansey outside of Sleep Powder and Explosion, which come with their obvious limitations. A paralyzed Chansey leaves Exeggutor with no options other than to Explode, pray for multiple full paralysis + Special drops with Psychic, or switch out.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor can't really harm each other much, and unless one of the Exeggutor is able to land Sleep Powder on the other, this one-on-one matchup most often ends with one of the Exeggutor Exploding on the other to trade evenly.</p> <p><strong>Lapras and Zapdos</strong>: Although they are by no means switch-ins, Lapras and Zapdos threaten a 2HKO with Blizzard and Drill Peck respectively, while Lapras also outspeeds Exeggutor and is able to threaten it with Sing, which means that either of these Pokemon find themselves in a one-on-one against Exeggutor they are generally favored.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Sleep Powder is an extremely threatening move, as incredibly dangerous Pokemon such as Tauros can switch on a sleeping Pokemon with little risk and cause havoc; counterplay to Exeggutor is often centered around absorbing it and containing its effects. Psychic is a powerful attack that threatens significant damage to anything other than special sponges, and is Exeggutor's main weapon against threats such as Snorlax. Explosion is an incredibly useful move that allows Exeggutor to bring something down with it and can create incredibly favorable situations if used correctly; however, the user must be careful of its Explosion being too predictable, as there are a number of ways to neutralize it, such as with Rock- or Ghost-type Pokemon, or sacrificing a Pokemon already affected by a strong status condition such as sleep or freeze. The fourth slot is the most contentious, as none of the four moves listed clearly outshine the other options. Double-Edge is a strong attack capable of breaking down paralyzed Jynx or Alakazam with minimal previous damage, an excellent tool to have at your disposal because both of these Pokemon commonly switch in on Exeggutor to absorb its Sleep Powder. Stun Spore allows Exeggutor to continue to cripple potential answers even after Sleep Clause is activated; this is especially useful when facing teams with multiple special sponges. Despite Mega Drain's pitiful Base Power, it ends up being Exeggutor's best tool against Starmie, and while the move is otherwise relatively useless, Starmie is another very common answer to Exeggutor, so Mega Drain has its merits. Finally, Hyper Beam is capable of sniping Starmie, Alakazam, Jynx, and even Chansey if they have taken sufficient damage before attempting to switch in into Exeggutor, but it is entirely useless if they have not, and it can have terrible drawbacks if predicted correctly by the opponent; nevertheless, its utility against every common special sponge should not be underestimated.</p> <p>Thanks to this set, Exeggutor is able to answer tier titans such as Chansey and Snorlax and apply huge amounts of pressure on the opponent's team. While its lack of recovery and susceptibility to status makes it a fairly difficult piece to maneuver with, the options in its toolbox make it a difficult threat to answer. Exeggutor players should try to damage or KO paralyzed opposing Pokemon that are able to block Sleep Powder in order to clear the way for it, as landing a Sleep Powder is often game-changing. The easiest and most common ways to find opportunities to send Exeggutor out on the field are on a predicted Chansey using Soft-Boiled or Snorlax using Rest; the former will have to respect the Sleep Powder threat and switch out, while the latter is not only scared of the sleep threat, but also vulnerable to Psychic itself. Once Exeggutor is on the field, the threat that Sleep Powder poses generates strong momentum for the player using it, but it must be followed up by strong predictions to progress the game favorably; using Sleep Powder on an incoming paralyzed Pokemon is simply a wasted turn, but so is Double-Edge on a Snorlax. The stress of prediction can be eased by sending Exeggutor on the field before paralyzing any foes, such as by leading with it. Although landing Sleep Powder this way is much easier, it is also less rewarding due to having to absorb early pressure, status, or damage on Exeggutor.</p> <p>The last detail to touch on is the usage of Explosion. Although most players are tempted to keep Explosion as a tool to get value out of a low health Exeggutor, one should try to recognize when such a line of play might be too greedy. For example, in situations where Exeggutor would not be able to make much progress at all even with a full health bar, it can be advantageous to use Explosion earlier on, when it is harder to predict and therefore more likely to hit the intended target. However, you should be careful of your matchup against Rhydon when choosing to get rid of your Exeggutor early, as it can be very dangerous to get rid of your sturdiest defensive answer to it. It's also possible to use Explosion to get rid of a Sleep Powder answer for a secondary sleeper on your team, most commonly Lapras, but this is a last resort option only in most cases.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Exeggutor is arguably the most reliable sleeper in RBY Ubers. Its relatively accurate Sleep Powder and good stats mean it will almost always manage to put a foe to sleep. This, alongside Stun Spore, allows Exeggutor to provide incredible team support that facilitates strong sweepers like Slowbro and Mewtwo. Exeggutor also has access to Explosion, meaning it will always pose a threat even after it has finished spreading its status, effectively making it a two-for-one in an ideal scenario. Exeggutor's stats are very well-rounded, boasting excellent bulk that allows it to check threats such as Snorlax, Tauros, and Mew under the right conditions. It can even check Mewtwo not carrying an Ice-type move. Moreover, Exeggutor's niche is unique, as no other Pokemon has the combination of a sleep move, a paralysis move, and Explosion. Exeggutor also hits very hard and can effectively pressure foes such as paralyzed Pokemon, Snorlax, and Chansey with Special drops from Psychic.</p> <p>However, Exeggutor does have a few flaws. It is forced out by strong Ice-type attackers such as Jynx, Cloyster, Articuno, and Lapras, as well as Mewtwo if it is carrying Ice Beam or Blizzard. Exeggutor's lack of coverage means it is reliant on Psychic and Explosion to deal damage, causing it to struggle to damage other Psychic-types and Chansey without using Explosion. Exeggutor is also very slow for Ubers, and it will usually take a hit before it can do anything, often forcing it to use Explosion earlier than it would like to. Also, Exeggutor lacks any kind of recovery, and players must be aware of the risks of switching Exeggutor in against attacks like Tauros's Body Slam.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stun Spore can be replaced by a number of options. Double-Edge can damage Psychic-types like Jynx and Alakazam more reliably. However, Double-Edge's recoil causes Exeggutor to be chipped down even faster, meaning it will likely use Explosion earlier than desired. Mega Drain is an option to 2HKO Rhydon and Golem while also healing Exeggutor a little bit. However, Exeggutor already has a favorable matchup against the two, and Psychic is usually sufficient to handle them. Mega Drain also makes Exeggutor a good Starmie check, especially if Starmie lacks Blizzard. Even if Starmie uses Blizzard, Mega Drain can stop a paralyzed Starmie from absorbing Sleep Powder and prevents Starmie from staying in after it is put to sleep. Hyper Beam is useful for certain ranges where foes might take another Psychic but aren't worth using Explosion on. However, using Hyper Beam requires good prediction and calculations, as failing to KO will result in Exeggutor being forced out or revenge killed. Rest may seem good to provide Exeggutor with semi-reliable recovery; however, it is very easy to pressure a sleeping Exeggutor with strong attacks, and finding opportunities to wake up is a difficult prospect. Being asleep also makes it more likely that Exeggutor will faint before it has a chance to use Explosion. Furthermore, a sleeping Exeggutor is a prime opportunity for setup sweepers such as Mewtwo and Slowbro to come in and wreak havoc.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ice-type attacks: Exeggutor's weakness to Ice means it is afraid of the common moves Ice Beam and Blizzard, especially STAB Blizzard from Jynx, Articuno, Lapras, and Cloyster, as well as coverage moves from Chansey, Mewtwo, and Starmie. Any of these Pokemon can force Exeggutor to switch out or take massive damage. Notably, any critical hit STAB Blizzard will OHKO Exeggutor.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Exeggutor's lack of coverage options means it often cannot do much to Psychic-types after it has statused them. Against Alakazam, Slowbro, Jynx, Mew, Mewtwo, or opposing Exeggutor, Exeggutor will be forced to switch out or use Explosion earlier than it would like to. Alakazam also has Seismic Toss to quickly rack up damage, which usually cannot be recovered. Moreover, these Pokemon make fantastic sleep blockers if they are paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Pressure: Because it uses its great bulk to switch in often, Exeggutor is very prone to getting worn down by chip damage to the point where it can no longer switch in. Exeggutor's low Speed compounds this issue, as it will usually be forced to take two hits before it can attack whenever it switches in.</p> <p><strong>Ice Beam Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo carrying Ice Beam or Blizzard can lure in Exeggutor and OHKO it with +4 Ice Beam or +2 Blizzard. For this reason, scouting Mewtwo's set beforehand is very important.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey reliably switches into Exeggutor and threatens it in a variety of ways in return. However, Chansey is likely to be OHKOed by Explosion and does not want to be put to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos outspeeds Exeggutor and can outright OHKO with a critical hit from Drill Peck. However, Zapdos hates being statused, and takes sizable damage from Psychic, so it cannot switch in safely.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Sleep Powder allows Exeggutor to disable a foe for a large portion of the game, creating opportunities for its teammates, particularly the tier king Mewtwo. Stun Spore allows Exeggutor and slower teammates to make more progress against faster foes such as Mew, Tauros, and Zapdos. Psychic hits Pokemon like Tauros, Rhydon, and Snorlax for solid damage, which can quickly turn into 2HKOs or 3HKOs with Special drops. Explosion makes sure Exeggutor will be useful at every stage of the game, always applying immense pressure even if Exeggutor is at low HP or paralyzed. Explosion can be used to remove Chansey and Alakazam and deal heavy damage to Mewtwo, allowing a teammate to come in and revenge kill.</p> <p>Exeggutor should be paired with teammates that appreciate the status it spreads. Setup sweepers like Amnesia Mewtwo, Amnesia Slowbro, and Swords Dance Mew can take full advantage of a sleeping foe. Slow, powerful attackers such as Rhydon, Snorlax, Golem, Slowbro, and, to some extent, Articuno enjoy having faster foes paralyzed by Stun Spore. Rhydon, in particular, greatly appreciates having its foes paralyzed, as this can sometimes allow it to use Substitute for free. Exeggutor can also paralyze and use Explosion against Mewtwo, opening an easy path for a teammate such as Snorlax or Tauros to KO it. This will make it much easier for your own Mewtwo to sweep with Amnesia later on. Zapdos is a particularly good teammate with Exeggutor, which handles Rhydon very well and induces sleep uncontested. Note that Exeggutor's generally good matchup against Rhydon is no longer safe after taking two Rock Slides while switching in.</p> <p>Exeggutor makes a decent lead because it can consistently put a foe to sleep on turn 1. Lead Exeggutor has a particularly good matchup against lead Tauros, as it can tank any hit from Tauros and easily put it to sleep. Against lead Gengar, Exeggutor can be used as sleep fodder; and against lead Jynx, it can simply use Explosion to remove it so long as Jynx misses Lovely Kiss. However, sacrificing Exeggutor too early could cause troubles later in the game when Mewtwo or another threat may need checking. Lead Exeggutor also has a poor matchup against other sleep leads. When using Exeggutor, it is important to not mindlessly use Thunder Wave or Stun Spore early game, as skilled opponents will switch in their Exeggutor check to absorb the paralysis, creating a sleep blocker. Exeggutor's lack of recovery means it should be on the lookout for safe ways to switch in, such as against the various users of Rest and Recover on the turns they heal. Such users include Snorlax, Mewtwo, and Alakazam. Exeggutor can also switch in against moves it resists, such as Psychic and Rhydon's and Tauros's Earthquake. Exeggutor should always be looking for opportunities to safely use Explosion and scouting for anything that could prevent it from doing so. Experienced players will be able to predict Explosion the majority of the time and will switch in their Rock-type, Gengar, or other fodder to absorb it. If Exeggutor faints before using Explosion, much of its utility and potential momentum is wasted. This mandates scouting for Ice Beam or Blizzard on opposing Mewtwo.</p> "

Exeggutor's access to Explosion also provides it with wallbreaking utility.</p> <p>Exeggutor is saddled with a weakness to the common Ice-type moves in the metagame, most of which will reliably 3HKO it. Its subpar Speed generally forces it to take a hit before it is able to move, allowing it to be worn down more easily.

Stun Spore cripples threats, but note that it is blocked by Substitute. Double-Edge is an incredibly useful move that can pressure Chansey, Alakazam, and their Substitutes, which is ideal, as its recoil damage doesn't apply when it scores a KO or breaks a Substitute. Breaking their Substitutes prevents them from setting up Substitute again and gives Exeggutor an opportunity to land Stun Spore when they're forced to recover. Furthermore, Double-Edge also deals more damage to enemy Exeggutor than Psychic can, allowing it to wear it down and force its Rest more quickly. Pressuring other Exeggutor and Chansey into using their recovery moves lets you switch out to a teammate that can threaten them. Explosion can be run over Double-Edge to let Exeggutor trade for a Pokemon on the opposing team and allow a teammate to switch in. However, it is risky, because Rhydon is common and takes little damage from it, and Explosion KOes Exeggutor when it hits a Substitute in Stadium. Finally, Rest heals Exeggutor and wipes off paralysis and the Speed loss that comes with it, keeping enemy Exeggutor, Alakazam, Rhydon, Jolteon, Snorlax, and others in check long term. Be aware that using Rest gives offensive threats like Starmie, Zapdos, and Snorlax an opportunity to switch in and apply pressure.</p> <p>Exeggutor makes a potent lead choice in Stadium OU to status common leads like other Exeggutor, Chansey, and Snorlax and scout for Substitute on Alakazam with Double-Edge. In addition, leads that can threaten Exeggutor like Jynx are rare in Stadium OU. Later on, care should be taken if Exeggutor is paralyzed; though it can remove the status with Rest, Pokemon like Snorlax and Rhydon have an easier time putting pressure on Exeggutor, especially if they are behind a Substitute, as it will then not be able to paralyze them. Exeggutor should generally stick to the moves listed above, but it does have other options. Sleep Powder puts a foe to sleep, but it's a shadow of its former self in Stadium; it cannot hit Pokemon behind a Substitute, sleep is limited to 0-3 turns, and Rest is counted under Sleep Clause, making it useless if one of the opponent's Pokemon is sleeping from Rest. Mega Drain hits Starmie, Slowbro, and Rhydon while letting Exeggutor recover some HP in the process. Unfortunately, it is blocked by Substitute and does little damage to most other Pokemon. Egg Bomb is an alternative to Double-Edge that never causes recoil damage, but it's held back by its shaky accuracy. Hyper Beam has a surprise factor and will KO Chansey at 40%, but it's undesirable, as Exeggutor will always have to recharge after using it in Stadium.</p> "

Teammates such as Porygon, Staryu, and Dragonair can be very useful as they can spread status without much trouble.</p> "}],

Its Poison typing grants weaknesses to common Ground- and Psychic-type attacks and lacks useful resistances. Its low Speed and average attacking stats make it very easy to overwhelm, often forcing it to use Explosion early. While its Explosion is difficult to switch into, it's severely held back by Weezing's inability to threaten Gastly or Graveler, which can effortlessly switch in and absorb any of Weezing's attacks. To make matters worse, Weezing is largely outclassed by Muk. Weezing's higher physical bulk and Speed are generally less useful than Muk's higher Attack, which allows it to threaten KOs against more foes. Notably, Muk's Explosion is guaranteed to OHKO Fearow and Dragonair, while Weezing's is just a range; Muk also has higher odds to OHKO Porygon and Rapidash.

  "Rhydon": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Rhydon possesses a very important place in RBY OU thanks to a fairly unique typing and formidable Attack stat; moreover, its Earthquake is the most powerful physical attack in the game without a drawback. Rhydon's typing gives it a good amount of defensive utility, such as switching in to force and punish Hyper Beam recharges, taking Explosions, staving off Thunder Wave, and stonewalling Zapdos and Jolteon. Thanks to its immense Attack stat, Rhydon can hit very high damage ranges, most notably a guaranteed 2HKO on Chansey. It's also capable of KOing Tauros after two Body Slams from your own Tauros. This power makes it very difficult to switch into, with would-be checks such as Exeggutor taking surprising damage. While initially slow, Rhydon is also very scary for paralyzed teams to fight—they often fold to it outright. Naturally, this means it appreciates paralysis support from teammates such as Chansey. It can still outspeed Slowbro and Snorlax, however, to force damage if they lack Reflect.</p> <p>Golem has competed with Rhydon for a teamslot for many years. Golem has the strongest Explosion in the game, only beaten by Snorlax's Self-Destruct, along with slightly higher Speed to win against Rhydon specifically. However, because Golem's niche hinges on Explosion, it often has to eschew Substitute. The lower damage output also causes Golem to lose out on some very valuable ranges, notably losing to Reflect Chansey more often than not, which Rhydon excels against. Due to these factors, Rhydon is generally favored over Golem in the metagame.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Out of all of Rhydon's moves, the most replaceable would be Rock Slide. This is because its coverage is rather specific, while the other listed moves add key utility. When dropping Rock Slide, be wary of the lower damage output, such as only 4HKOing Cloyster and 3HKOing Lapras with Earthquake, as well as the loss of coverage against Articuno and Moltres. Should these qualities be useful, Body Slam can be dropped instead. In this case, though, Rhydon can't set up paralysis for itself, making it much more reliant on teammates and matchups against threats such as Starmie noticeably worse.</p> <p>Rest can be used to give Rhydon more longevity, but it's hard to wake up due to being 2HKOed by Tauros. Rest is generally used on more defensive teams to better handle Zapdos and Jolteon throughout a game, but it's also extremely helpful against Reflect Chansey, enabling Rhydon to be more aggressive and freely burn Rest turns behind Substitute. It also helps against Snorlax without coverage, as Rhydon despises being paralyzed by Snorlax on the switch. Another option is Leer to beat Reflect Chansey much more reliably and potentially get past Reflect Snorlax. However, these Pokemon can switch out to get rid of the Defense drops. Using Leer also lets faster Pokemon switch in while taking no damage, which can give the opponent opportunities to play around Rhydon's usual sweeping. In contrast, when spamming Earthquake, a critical hit still ruins Reflect Chansey and Snorlax, and switch-ins will likely take damage. Counter can be used to more heavily punish Hyper Beam and Explosion—bringing in Rhydon after a foe's Explosion and using Counter after forcing their switch-in out can usually lead to a free KO. While gimmicky, Bubble Beam could be used for other Rhydon or Golem; if it drops Speed, it guarantees a KO with Earthquake. It can also allow Rhydon to move first against Exeggutor switch-ins, allowing it to situationally win the interaction should Exeggutor be worn down.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Exeggutor: Exeggutor is the best check for Rhydon in the game. It resists Earthquake and is only 4HKOed by Rock Slide. However, it must watch out for Body Slam. In fact, Rhydon will usually use Body Slam expecting an Exeggutor switch-in if it's still healthy. A paralyzed Exeggutor won't be able to reliably check Rhydon anymore, as two Rock Slides will deal upwards of 55% of damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros is only 3HKOed by Earthquake and can 2HKO Rhydon with Blizzard in return, which, when combined with Tauros's absurdly high critical hit rate and the chance of freeze, means that Rhydon is almost always forced out. Even if it doesn't switch out, there's a respectable chance that it does absolutely nothing in return. However, Tauros doesn't appreciate being damaged, especially if the Tauros on Rhydon's team is still at full HP. After Rhydon KOes a Pokemon, Tauros can usually force it out and start exerting its sweeping prowess.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster is only 4HKOed by Earthquake and 3HKOed by Rock Slide, and it can OHKO a third of the time in return with Blizzard. It even packs Clamp for denying a free move to Rhydon behind a Substitute, as Clamp will break the Substitute and render Rhydon immobile in the process.</p> <p><strong>Starmie and Chansey</strong>: These two Pokemon are able to switch in on Rhydon and duel it, but only if they are not paralyzed, and Chansey requires Reflect. Chansey is 2HKOed by Earthquake, and Starmie, while very rarely 2HKOed by Earthquake, can be paralyzed by Body Slam on the switch or on a predicted Recover, turning the tides in Rhydon's favor. The paralysis factor makes these matchups extremely variable.</p> <p><strong>Victreebel</strong>: Victreebel outspeeds and OHKOes Rhydon with Razor Leaf. However, it takes a huge chunk of damage from Earthquake, which is a likely 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro threatens to OHKO Rhydon with Surf, and with Reflect, it can effortlessly set up Amnesia against it. It can also use Thunder Wave when predicting a switch to worsen the situation. However, it does take significant damage coming in, making it a check at best.</p> <p><strong>Lapras and Jynx</strong>: These Pokemon can OHKO Rhydon with their Ice-type moves, but they struggle to switch in because of the threat of Rock Slide, as it will almost always 2HKO Lapras and always OHKO Jynx. Paralyzing them also turns them into prey for Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: Golem outspeeds Rhydon and 2HKOes it with Earthquake. However, Rhydon also 2HKOes Golem with its own Earthquake, meaning Golem cannot switch in at all.</p> <p><strong>Reflect Snorlax</strong>: While Rhydon is only 3HKOed by Earthquake and Ice Beam, it struggles heavily to actually KO Snorlax without critical hits if Reflect is active. Earthquake can deal up to 38% before Reflect goes up, but after that, the damage is negligible at best. Reflect Snorlax does give Rhydon a good number of opportunities to fish for critical hits, so this matchup can be quite volatile. Snorlax also has issues switching in, making it a check at best.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Rhydon's Earthquake is the strongest physical move in the game with no drawbacks, hitting anything that doesn't resist it extremely hard. Rock Slide covers Zapdos and hits Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Cloyster, and Lapras harder. Body Slam is extremely valuable, allowing Rhydon to generate its own paralysis support against the likes of Exeggutor, Starmie, Alakazam, and Lapras. Rhydon's Substitute is hard for inexperienced players to understand the true potential of, but it can single-handedly win games. Its Substitute tanking one Seismic Toss gives Rhydon the edge one-on-one against Chansey, though Ice Beam still stings. Also, Rhydon can create Substitutes versus Pokemon that can't significantly damage it, such as Zapdos and Jolteon, giving it a free hit against whatever comes in afterwards. This can instantly win the game or impart a huge chunk of damage to a replacement like Tauros. Substitute is also extremely helpful against paralyzed Starmie, letting Rhydon fish for full paralysis to stay in. Rhydon can then go for the uncommon 2HKO with Earthquake or even a possible OHKO with a critical hit.</p> <p>Despite being slow, Rhydon is very hard to switch into if you lack Exeggutor, making it one of the key reasons for Exeggutor's success in RBY OU. It's an absolute nightmare for paralyzed teams, easily rampaging through them. It's very viable to build a team around Rhydon, providing it the paralysis support it needs to clean up. Its key immunity to Electric-type moves, namely Thunder Wave, means it's very hard to reliably paralyze and gives it switch-in opportunities on Pokemon such as Alakazam and Chansey. It is also the premier counter to Zapdos and Jolteon, two Pokemon that can be very dangerous in its absence—especially Zapdos—due to the few Electric-resistant Pokemon in RBY OU. Rhydon also resists Normal, which means it can switch into a predicted Explosion or Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Despite all of the advantages, Rhydon is heavily reliant on opposing Pokemon being paralyzed to get in safely. It has very poor Special; this and its typing can make it easy prey for almost every special attacker in the tier. As a result, Rhydon tends to struggle one-on-one against non-paralyzed threats, notably Tauros, Starmie, and Exeggutor.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Rhydon’s massive Attack, STAB Earthquake, 103 HP Substitutes, and Electric immunity give it a powerful role within the Stadium OU metagame. Like in RBY OU, it blanks Zapdos and Jolteon, but it gains more depth in its ability to handle other threats with paralysis support from its team. Its Substitutes can survive a Seismic Toss, which Chansey commonly runs due to its 32 PP and ability to break weaker Substitutes. Additionally, Stadium's Substitute offers Rhydon added utility, most notably blocking Exeggutor’s Stun Spore, and while allowing it to throw off strong attacks or attempt a Body Slam paralysis with little to no drawbacks. Rest is also used by many Pokemon in Stadium, including, Exeggutor, Snorlax, Slowbro, and Cloyster; this further helps Rhydon get on the field and get up a Substitute without risking damage or a status ailment. Rhydon’s defensive typing—while not great—allows it to also be a Thunder Wave and Explosion absorber.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Rhydon is slower than all OU Pokemon besides Snorlax and Slowbro. Despite its Normal resistance, its poor defensive typing and Special allow common Pokemon such as Chansey, Tauros, and Starmie to outspeed and 2HKO with Ice Beam or Blizzard, which they very commonly carry. This means Rhydon absolutely requires paralysis support to be effective, and while this may seem high-maintenance, with proper team support Rhydon is capable of busting massive holes mid-game or cleaning up late-game.</p> <p>Rhydon also competes with Golem, which has access to Explosion—and is slightly faster than Rhydon, at base 45—meaning it wins one-on-one with its own Earthquake. However, what Golem lacks is the ability to create Substitutes that survive Seismic Toss. This makes Golem’s gameplan very prediction reliant because wallbreaking and cleaning up is much less safe. Rhydon also has the edge offensively, as its higher Attack allows it to meet better KO ranges against common Pokemon in the metagame. Finally, while Golem does outspeed Rhydon, they effectively share the same Speed tier, being outsped by Chansey and thus both requiring paralysis support. For these reasons, Rhydon is preferred on most competitive teams.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Rhydon looks to capitalize on its opportunities and massive Attack stat with its standard Substitute set. Its Earthquake is the strongest physical attack in the game with no drawbacks. It can easily enter the field against Zapdos and Jolteon, as these threats fail to threaten Rhydon with significant damage or status, with it taking less than 20% from the super effective Double Kick seen on Jolteon. If Chansey is revealed to only have Seismic Toss for attacks, it can also act as a point of entry. However, it's still best to not switch into Seismic Toss, as you can switch in on a predicted Thunder Wave or Soft-Boiled for free, keeping Rhydon healthy to create Subsitutes and stay out of range of Starmie’s and Tauros’s Blizzard. Once it gets in, it can get a Substitute up for free—usually forcing a switch—to attack accordingly. Common checks in Starmie and Exeggutor risk Body Slam paralysis as they break your Substitute, which can help tremendously long term, although Exeggutor commonly runs Rest and can remove the paralysis if it manages to get it off. Not only does your team appreciate these checks being paralyzed, but next time they will be unable to beat Rhydon behind a Substitute one-on-one, as Body Slam chip damage means Earthquake 2HKOes Starmie and Rock Slide 3HKOes Exeggutor.</p> <p>It’s important to note just how devastatingly strong Rhydon is. For reference, with Earthquake it OHKOes Jolteon and the rare Gengar, 2HKOes Alakazam, Chansey, Rhydon, and the uncommon Persian and Golem, has a small chance to 2HKO Starmie, and 3HKOes Tauros and Snorlax. It’s also worth noting These are some of the most common Pokemon in the metagame. Also, if Tauros uses Substitute it will be in 2HKO range, meaning it can no longer switch into Rhydon behind a Substitute. With Rock Slide, it OHKOes Jynx and Articuno, 2HKOes Zapdos, and 3HKOes Cloyster. However, it still loses to all the threats listed above in a one-on-one situation where Rhydon doesn’t have a Substitute and the opposing Pokemon isn’t paralyzed, aside from Zapdos, Jolteon, and Gengar. Additionally, these Pokemon potentially 2HKOing or even OHKOing Rhydon means you must be very careful, as a stray critical hit or mistake is enough to put Rhydon down.</p> <p>Stadium's Team Preview is a double-edged sword for Rhydon. Knowing if your opponent has Zapdos or Jolteon is important to using Rhydon’s defensive utility most effectively. However, your opponent can plan around Rhydon, meaning a “free switch” can turn bad if your opponent double switches to a Rhydon check such as Starmie or Exeggutor.</p> <p>Rhydon is capable of fitting Rest, and it is no gimmick. With so many Pokemon often using Rest themselves or paralyzed, Rhydon can usually find a time to use Rest. It also completely walls Seismic Toss Chansey and Snorlax if it lacks Ice Beam, Blizzard, or Earthquake, using Rest to stay healthy in the face of these threats. If Rhydon happens to be behind a Substitute, you gain an extra turn at the minimum to wake up. If you do decide to run Rest, it will most likely be over Rock Slide, but Body Slam is also an option. Replacing Rock Slide gives Rhydon a worse Exeggutor matchup, as it only 5HKOes with Body Slam. However, Earthquake hits enough of your key targets, and Body Slam paralysis is very valuable to punish switch-ins and gain better one-on-one matchups. Leer and Tail Whip are plausible to negate Reflect, which Snorlax and Chansey often use. This isn’t reliable or necessary, as you’d drop a more consistent option in Body Slam, Rock Slide, or Rest.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Chansey is a staple in the RBY metagame, present on nearly 100% of competitive teams. The reason for its extreme popularity mostly lies in its gargantuan special bulk neutralizing Psychic-types, an otherwise incredibly difficult task without using Psychic-types of your own, as well as its ability to completely wall other special attackers like Lapras. It does not perform as well against physical attackers, however; strong hits from the likes of Snorlax and Rhydon can threaten an easy 2HKO, so Chansey must be wary of these threats whenever entering the field, although it does possess tools to ease these matchups despite its generally innocuous offensive presence. Nonetheless, Chansey is somewhat of a requirement in any RBY team due to the risks you would take against Psychic-types without it.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While it is generally recommended to stick to the above combinations, Chansey is free to mix and match its options, with the only mandatory move being Soft-Boiled. Sets such as Counter + Sing or Thunder Wave + Seismic Toss, Reflect + Ice Beam + Thunderbolt, and Seismic Toss + Ice Beam + Thunder Wave can all perform admirably on the right team, so if you want to rebalance certain matchups for your team, feel free to explore different, less conventional ways to combine Chansey's best moves.</p> <p>Defense Curl is an option over Reflect in the typical Reflect set. Boosting Chansey's Defense past +2 usually makes little difference, but its 64 PP allow you to win PP wars against opposing Reflect Chansey and Snorlax handily as well as significantly increase Chansey's odds in a PP stall against Alakazam and Starmie, which is a useful advantage in its own right; however, Reflect's one-turn setup is significantly better when Chansey switches in on Snorlax, so it's generally preferred.</p> <p>Toxic is another curveball that synergizes well with partial trappers such as Cloyster, Moltres, or Victreebel, as the damage quickly stacks up on targets that would otherwise be able to endure their hits, such as opposing Chansey; also, a Chansey carrying Toxic should beat any Chansey that isn't carrying Ice Beam in the long run due to the damage from the poison.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Snorlax: Snorlax's Body Slam 3HKOes Chansey, forcing it to keep using Soft-Boiled in most situations; as Body Slam's 24 PP outlasts Soft-Boiled's 16, Chansey cannot afford to outstall the attacks, especially when you also factor in the odds of critical hits as well as the potential Hyper Beam from Snorlax. Even when Chansey is carrying Reflect, a Snorlax with Rest is often not even forced to switch out, as it has really good odds of breaking through eventually between critical hits and PP count. The best option for Chansey is to force Snorlax to use Rest and then switch out to something that can threaten it while it's sleeping. While this is not an awful short-term scenario for the Chansey player, as the Snorlax will need some free turns to wake up, Snorlax can easily find those turns whenever Chansey hits the field again, putting it in yet another situation where it is bound to lose if it doesn't switch out. If the Snorlax carries Ice Beam, it can also attempt to freeze Chansey, and in the worst case for Snorlax, it can trade with Chansey by using Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam and Starmie</strong>: Chansey has no way to significantly damage Alakazam, and while it won't be doing much damage back, it can win the PP war thanks to Recover's massive 32 PP unless it gets fully paralyzed several times in a row. Alakazam can also simply fire off Psychic until Chansey's Special drops low enough that it's forced to switch out, but Psychic's limited 16 PP means this can generally only happen two or three times per game. Starmie functions very similarly, as long as the Chansey doesn't have Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Sleepers</strong>: Chansey will be healing up a lot throughout the game. If you can send a sleep move user such as Exeggutor out on a predicted Soft-Boiled, Chansey will have to respect the threat of Sleep Powder and switch out.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Depending on the sets, Chansey can be an excellent Chansey counter. Ice Beam threatens to freeze any unparalyzed Chansey, while a paralyzed Reflect Chansey is going to PP stall most other Chansey with ease. Sing Chansey can also surprise the opponent's Chansey and land a sleep on it, and even if it misses, Sing will remain threatening and have to be respected with a switch.</p> <p><strong>Explosion Lures</strong>: Exeggutor, Cloyster, and Gengar can usually manage to get Chansey on the field to sponge one of their powerful special attacks and catch it with an Explosion to take it out. This is especially viable for teams running a Pokemon such as Lapras or Psychic-less Starmie, which are otherwise completely walled by Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon: While Rhydon has to respect the Ice Beam threat, its Earthquake achieves a guaranteed 2HKO, so it can sometimes accept taking the Ice Beam damage in exchange for a KO on Chansey. It's even better against Chansey sets that don't run Ice Beam, as it can create Substitutes with enough HP to tank two Seismic Tosses and use Earthquake freely. Both of these situations only really favor Rhydon if the Chansey is paralyzed, however, so make sure to set up its status properly before attempting to win with Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: If Chansey is not running Thunderbolt, Slowbro can freely get Amnesia boosts on it, periodically heal any damage with Rest, and eventually KO via the STAB move of choice as soon as Chansey gets fully paralyzed. Chansey should generally switch out of Slowbro whenever possible, as it can get very threatening very quickly otherwise.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon</strong>: If Jolteon carries Rest, it is able to repeatedly shrug off Chansey's attempts at damage until Double Kick critical hits and paralysis manages to take Chansey down. This leaves Jolteon very vulnerable during its Rest turns, so you should be careful when attempting this.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: If all else fails, Tauros can come in on a paralyzed Chansey and take it out with Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam, but Tauros really hates being paralyzed, so you should only use this option as a last resort.</p> ",

Soft-Boiled is a necessity to allow Chansey to check threats and stay healthy throughout the game. Thunder Wave is necessary to punish any Tauros that may attempt to ruin your fun by negating Reflect with a critical hit; it's also generally strong utility and one of the most threatening tools in Chansey's arsenal. Seismic Toss is the preferred move to deal damage, as it hits for a consistent 100 HP, but Ice Beam, while resisted by many Pokemon, still threatens a deadly freeze on everything other than Ice-types. If you choose to rely on Ice Beam as your only attacking move, you will have to be careful not to paralyze Pokemon such as Starmie, as Chansey loses all offensive pressure against it without the possibility to freeze it.</p> <p>Reflect Chansey is one of the best early- and mid-game pivots, while also retaining good enough one-on-one matchups to remain a threat in the later stages of the game. This set's biggest selling point is the ability to switch into Snorlax's Body Slam without having to fear paralysis, allowing it to always set up Reflect, heal off all the damage with Soft-Boiled, and then safely chip away at the opposition via Seismic Toss. An important decision is going to present itself often when playing Reflect Chansey: letting it take a Thunder Wave will make it immune to freezes, allowing it to take on Ice Beam Chansey and win the PP war as well as making it a reliable answer to Exeggutor since it won't have to fear Sleep Powder anymore; however, this will make Chansey much less effective at switching in on Snorlax, and other threats such as Rhydon will also have a much better time against it. Managing the status of your Reflect Chansey is extremely important, and making the right decisions can often swing the tides of the game in your favor. It should be mentioned that a paralyzed Reflect Chansey will also have much more trouble facing Psychic-types due to the 30% chance of dropping its Special via Psychic; it is relatively easy for one of them to accumulate two or more drops and force it to switch out, thus removing Reflect and significantly weakening its effectiveness against physical threats for the rest of the game, unless it is given the free turns to set it up again.</p> "

Soft-Boiled is necessary to remain healthy throughout the game, and Thunder Wave is Chansey's main weapon to cripple threats like Tauros and hinder anything else that tries to beat Chansey one-on-one.</p> <p>BoltBeam Chansey will always have to be careful maneuvering around Snorlax, as it doesn't have the tools to face Snorlax one-on-one; this is especially true for Snorlax that carry Rest. BoltBeam Chansey often wants to get paralyzed so it can avoid freezes and sleep, but this makes the Snorlax matchup even worse, and since it's such a threatening Pokemon to begin with, you may want to be careful with accepting Thunder Wave on your Chansey. Another tough matchup is Alakazam, which can easily sponge all of Chansey's attacks and retaliate with repeated Psychic that will eventually cause multiple Special drops and force Chansey off the field; even if Alakazam runs out of Psychic PP, it can often win an all-out PP stall. However, BoltBeam Chansey has a much happier time against the other common Psychic users due to super effective coverage on both Starmie and Exeggutor. Ice Beam also allows Chansey to win against non-Ice Beam Chansey thanks to the freeze chance, so long as the opposing Chansey isn't paralyzed — when it is, this matchup turns around, as Ice Beam's relatively low 16 PP will usually cause BoltBeam Chansey to lose the PP war.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Sing is one of the premier Chansey sets. Although the high risk of missing may appear dangerous, Chansey is unlikely to take much punishment in return from any special attacker, so it is a common and successful strategy to simply switch Sing Chansey on a Pokemon like Starmie very early on and put it to sleep immediately. As Soft-Boiled is mandatory, using Sing leaves two moveslots open, usually to be filled with one attacking move and one utility move. The most common attacking move is Ice Beam, as the freeze threat is quite potent against most special attackers, which cannot harm Chansey all that much. However, running Ice Beam as your only damaging move leaves Chansey entirely toothless against Ice-types such as Jynx, Cloyster, and Lapras, so you may want to opt for Seismic Toss instead. As for the utility move, Thunder Wave is handy to cripple various threats, most notably physical attackers that pose an urgent threat to Chansey but really dislike being paralyzed, such as Tauros. Counter, on the other hand, is a specific tool to take care of Snorlax. Due to Chansey's gigantic HP stat, it will OHKO Snorlax after taking a single Body Slam, which is Snorlax's go-to STAB move and main way to damage Chansey. Once Counter is revealed, Snorlax can use moves that Counter can't reply to, such as Earthquake and Ice Beam, and then switch out to a more appropriate check; this means that it is of vital importance for Chansey to land its Counter the first time it uses it, as getting any mileage out of it in the rest of the game is going to be quite unlikely.</p> <p>Sing Chansey's dream scenario is to switch in on a Turn 1 Thunder Wave, allowing it to neutralize incoming sleep moves for the rest of the game, and immediately firing off Sing to achieve what is essentially a full Pokemon advantage due to RBY's notorious sleep mechanics. This threat means Sing Chansey is a strong antimeta pick, as it is commonplace for leads such as Starmie and Alakazam to want to use Thunder Wave in the first turn of the game. However, this strategy is very well known, especially at higher levels of play, so expecting opponents to use Thunder Wave on the first turn may result in heartbreak. Should these types of mindgames not appeal to you, it is also possible to hide Chansey's Sing until later in the game, attempting to bluff a different set and catch a more valuable target than you otherwise would have; however, this is largely reliant on hitting your very first Sing, which is only a 55% chance, as the surprise factor will be blown afterwards.</p> <p>It should be mentioned that Sing Chansey can also function as a lead; although its matchup against faster sleepers such as Gengar, Jynx, and Exeggutor is abysmal, it is able to comfortably land a Sing when facing common leads such as Alakazam and Starmie.</p> "

    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>NOTE - The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. Tangela is generally considered unviable in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <h1>Overview</h1> <p>Upon first glance, it may be difficult to ascertain why any player would even consider using Tangela in a competitive match. It has very little offensive presence, a limited movepool, and a Speed lower than even Vaporeon. It is also quite vulnerable to Wrap users and Ice-type moves, both of which are rather common in the tier. It makes sense that Tangela was first perceived as little more than a gimmick.</p> <p>While Tangela is still far from a staple, it has begun to establish itself in the tier because it compresses a precise combination of desirable traits. For starters, the pure Grass typing makes Tangela a strong check to Earthquake users like Dugtrio and Golem without picking up a weakness to Rock Slide. It similarly prepares Tangela to check Electric-types like Electabuzz and Raichu. Sleep Powder is a blessing in a tier where the few other sleep inducers largely rely on the rather inaccurate Hypnosis, making Tangela more reliable and freeing up Hypnosis users to explore alternative sets and play more aggressively. Additionally, Tangela's access to Stun Spore lets it stymie opposing sweepers and Wrap users, such as Dugtrio and Tentacruel, while also enabling friendly sweepers and Wrap users. Stun Spore is also notable for being the only move that can paralyze Dugtrio behind a Substitute. Finally, while it is not on the level of defensive staples like Vaporeon and Omastar, Tangela can be a makeshift check to a lot of common sweepers when at full health. Normal-type Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Persian usually win the matchup but tend to fear paralysis. Tangela does not fit on every team by any means, but its unique combination of defensive and supportive traits can make it the perfect choice on a select few, rather potent teams.</p> <p>Even with all of these positives, Tangela still has many flaws and can be easily exploited by many Pokemon. Tangela's extremely low Speed makes it easy to chip down with Wrap and revenge kill. Its Grass typing also leaves it vulnerable to Ice-type moves from the likes of Articuno and the tier’s many Water-type Pokemon, as well as Dodrio’s Drill Peck. Poor offensive options also leave it nearly unable to touch some Pokemon, including Dragonite, Haunter, and other Grass-type Pokemon. Finally, Sleep Powder's and Stun Spore's imperfect accuracy can occasionally mean the difference between a win and a loss. Thus, Tangela should only be used when its unique role compression cannot be replicated by other team members.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>By far the most enticing option in Tangela’s toolkit is a Swords Dance set with Body Slam, Hyper Beam, or both. However, boosting is really difficult in RBY UU, especially when neither Speed nor a defensive stat is rising. Moreover, Tangela’s Attack stat and physical movepool are dismal, making such a set underwhelming even in ideal conditions.</p> <p>When experimenting with different sets for Tangela, generally refrain from removing Tangela's status moves, especially Sleep Powder. This keeps it from being outclassed by other defensive Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Once Tangela uses Stun Spore against Haunter, it is virtually incapable of further threatening it. Haunter resists or is immune to every single move Tangela can learn. Even if Tangela somehow maximizes its Special with Growth, Mega Drain can only sometimes score a 4HKO. Haunter, on the other hand, scores an easy 4HKO with Night Shade or a 5HKO or better with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: All of the tier’s prominent Flying-type Pokemon threaten Tangela. Much like Haunter, Dragonite is simply not afraid of any move that Tangela can throw at it. Dragonite can use its superior Speed to work Tangela’s health down with Wrap and easily put it away with Blizzard or any powerful physical attack, possibly even leaving the entire exchange unscathed. Articuno similarly fears none any of Tangela’s attacks, and its incredibly strong Blizzard boasts an impressive 51.3% chance to simply OHKO Tangela. The rare Moltres functions nearly identically and takes even less from Mega Drain. Dodrio does fear paralysis and doesn't have Wrap to avoid getting hit like Dragonite, but it can easily revenge kill Tangela, as Drill Peck is a clean 2HKO. Gyarados has the least desirable matchup of the Flying-type Pokemon but can still 2HKO with Blizzard provided Tangela doesn’t reclaim too much health with Mega Drain.</p> <p><strong>Grass-, Bug-, and Fire-type Pokemon: While these Pokemon are a fair deal less common than the Pokemon discussed above, they still check Tangela thoroughly. While it admittedly can’t do much in return, Venusaur shrugs off virtually any hit Tangela can throw at it. Venomoth likewise takes very little damage from Tangela and can threaten paralysis or possibly 5HKO with Psychic. Yet again, Pinsir is unafraid of Tangela’s moves and can pivot out with Bind, set up with Swords Dance, or 3HKO it outright with Slash. Fire-types, while exceedingly uncommon, will check Tangela and claim 2HKOs or OHKOs with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves: Outside of Articuno and Dragonite, Tangela can beat most users of Ice-type moves with status or Mega Drain. However, every major user of Blizzard or Ice Beam aside from Omastar is faster than Tangela and thus can pressure it, especially if it has taken a few hits or hasn't used Growth yet. So long as these Pokemon aren't paralyzed, they are capable of revenge killing Tangela or even winning one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel: While Tentacruel would prefer not to risk getting paralyzed, it is more than capable of handling Tangela. Like Dragonite, Tentacruel can easily whittle Tangela down with Wrap and finish it off with a powerful Blizzard.</p> ",

        {
          "name": "Defensive Pivot",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set allows Tangela to function as a pivot. Sleep Powder and Stun Spore are more or less essential to any variant of Tangela. These two moves give it a significant amount of utility, allowing it to punish switch ins and enable its teammates to sweep. Even with Bind, Tangela is largely outclassed by other prominent Dugtrio checks like Dragonite and Gyarados if it chooses not to run both status moves. Bind functions just like Wrap, albeit with slightly lower accuracy, dealing chip damage and generating safe switches. Due to Tangela's low speed, Bind is most useful against paralyzed targets, though Tangela can usually afford to take a hit before using Bind if it must. Body Slam is very weak from Tangela, but it hits most targets neutrally and threatens paralysis. Mega Drain is similarly weak, but can hit a few targets for super effective damage and get Tangela a little health back in the process. Omastar and Golem are particularly fearful of Mega Drain, which is likely to 2HKO both. Rest serves to make Tangela a more complete wall but makes it even less offensively threatening. Due to Tangela having essentially no offensive presence with Rest, it may be worth running Body Slam or Mega Drain over Bind.</p> "
        },
        {"name": "Defensive Growth", "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set is a slightly more offensive take on the traditionally defensive Pokemon. Growth slowly boosts both Tangela's offensive and defensive prowess. While some Pokemon like Dragonite and Haunter are still not fazed by Tangela’s offenses, this set can bully some defensive Pokemon. Examples include Hypno and Vaporeon, especially if they have been paralyzed; unless they can land a critical hit, Tangela is relatively free to boost with Growth while both dealing damage and regaining health with Mega Drain. The threat of Stun Spore crippling a teammate pressures these Pokemon from switching out. Sleep Powder is always a useful move and allows Tangela to accomplish something even when it can’t quite get going with Growth. Moreover, after successfully using Sleep Powder, Tangela can use Stun Spore to potentially punish a switch-in looking to keep Tangela from setting up with Growth.</p> "}

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. The most up to date moveset for Kangaskhan is the following.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute is notable, as Kangaskhan's 103 HP Substitutes can tank Night Shade from Haunter, as well as Seismic Toss from Hypno and Kadabra, while easing prediction. However, they will normally default to other moves, such as Thunder Wave or Hypnosis, making the option largely moot. Surf allows Kangaskhan to 2HKO Golem and 3HKO Aerodactyl but has no utility otherwise. Kangaskhan can amp up its damage output with Double-Edge to 3HKO Hypno—or even Mega Kick to 3HKO Vaporeon—but whatever move gets replaced will often be sorely missed; replacing Body Slam makes Kangaskhan far more reliant on paralysis support, and eschewing coverage is generally not advised.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Paralysis: Paralysis is the main obstacle to Kangaskhan's success, as it aims to take advantage of slower Pokemon like Vaporeon, as well as paralyzed Pokemon, and tear them down. Paralysis not only makes such interactions impossible but also exposes Kangaskhan's awful special bulk. Pokemon like Articuno, Gyarados, Omastar, Vaporeon, and Venusaur blow paralyzed Kangaskhan away with their strong STAB moves. As such, paralysis inducers such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, and Hypno are to be avoided unless Kangaskhan is in a position where it can KO them first. There will be many times where Kangaskhan will KO something mid-game and subsequently be forced out by one of these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel: Tentacruel outspeeds Kangaskhan and has an 82% chance to 2HKO it with Surf. Furthermore, Tentacruel is capable of chipping Kangaskhan into 2HKO range with just one Wrap use, which is what makes the Speed factor so dangerous; while Kangaskhan is absolutely capable of using Earthquake to 2HKO Tentacruel, it cannot do so quickly enough without Tentacruel being paralyzed first or happening to miss Wrap. Even then, Tentacruel may simply go for the Surf 2HKO, as the odds aren't terrible with even a little chip damage. It should be noted that Kangaskhan's Hyper Beam deals more damage than Earthquake, and can KO Tentacruel from 56.4% or less.</p> <p><strong>Tangela</strong>: Tangela isn't afraid of switching into Kangaskhan, not even fearing a critical hit Hyper Beam. Not only does it shrug off these generally nuclear blows, but it can also threaten with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore in return, both of which put an end to Kangaskhan's rampage. Furthermore, if Kangaskhan has been put to sleep, Tangela sets up Growth with impunity, making its Mega Drain noticeably more threatening. Finally, with Bind, Tangela can exploit paralyzed Kangaskhan relatively well, chipping it into KO range and pivoting to its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: If Kangaskhan lacks Rock Slide, Articuno is a very deadly threat to its success. Even Ice Beam from Articuno can 2HKO it, and Blizzard makes it impossible to switch Kangaskhan into anything later. If Kangaskhan does have Rock Slide, Articuno is threatened with a 2HKO, though Kangaskhan will be damaged heavily by Blizzard in the process. Without Rock Slide, Kangaskhan can only win with a critical hit Body Slam followed up by Hyper Beam. If Articuno has set up Agility and hasn't been damaged, even Rock Slide Kangaskhan cannot win without getting extremely lucky.</p> <p><strong>Counter Users</strong>: Kangaskhan's wallbreaking prowess comes back to bite it with Counter's existence. There will be many points where a Kangaskhan user has to check for Counter by using Earthquake to force it to fail. Pokemon like opposing Kangaskhan, Hypno, and Poliwrath are occasionally seen using the move. Should Kangaskhan trigger Counter, it will take significant damage. There is also the risk of a Pokemon switching in on Hyper Beam and countering the damage the next turn, which may deal fatal damage.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite: While it fears Blizzard, Rock Slide, and Body Slam paralysis, Dragonite can switch into Kangaskhan's STAB moves comfortably. In return, it can threaten with Thunder Wave or a 3HKO from its own Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Aerodactyl</strong>: Aerodactyl is the only Pokemon in the game to resist the combination of Normal- and Ground-type coverage; if Kangaskhan's fourth move doesn't cover it, it becomes a serviceable check. Aerodactyl can use Fire Blast to attempt to burn Kangaskhan in this situation, which is a death sentence if it works. The damage isn't small either; it's a guaranteed 4HKO. However, if Kangaskhan does cover Aerodactyl with Blizzard or Rock Slide, it's generally fine. The risk of Body Slam paralysis is very large for Aerodactyl, which makes it very risky to check Kangaskhan with it.</p> ",

          "name": "Kangaskhan",
          "description": "<hr /> <h1>Outdated Analysis</h1> <h1>Overview</h1> <p>Kangaskhan is one of the strongest Normal-type attackers in RBY UU, featuring a wide arsenal of attacking options that help it excel as the tier's most terrifying wallbreaker. Fitting on many offensive teams, it can blow past any Pokemon with Hyper Beam from around 60% HP. It has great coverage too: even the dreaded Articuno, which it outspeeds, is 2HKOed by Rock Slide. The damage that Kangaskhan dishes out is enough to knock many Pokemon into KO range for revenge killers like Dugtrio—if it doesn't just KO them outright—making defensive threats like Vaporeon and Hypno very wary. It is an extremely difficult Pokemon to switch into, arguably having no counters. Not only that, Kangaskhan has incredible physical bulk, allowing it to take minimal damage from Wrap and serve as a minor check to Dugtrio. Kangaskhan is quite customizable for teams as well, possessing interesting options such as Counter.</p> <p>Despite these incredible positives, Kangaskhan isn't an automatic addition to teams. Its special bulk is simply horrific, leaving it at least possibly 2HKOed by many of the strong special attacks thrown around in the tier, such as Articuno's Blizzard and Tentacruel's Surf. Worse still, it falls short in Speed, being slower than tier-king Tentacruel; factoring in its special fragility, this leaves it easily revenge killed. These factors make Kangaskhan sweeping on its own quite rare, so it will often be reserved to exploiting slower, sleeping, or paralyzed Pokemon.</p> "
        },

          "name": "Wallbreaker",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>The combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam will KO Electabuzz, Persian, and Dugtrio. Furthermore, Hyper Beam alone will OHKO Kadabra, and it has a minute chance to OHKO Dugtrio. Body Slam is crucial for Kangaskhan's success outside of damage, as paralyzing a switch-in will often lead to Kangaskhan beating it outright. Earthquake covers Haunter and Omastar, which are 2HKOed and 3HKOed. It further covers Electric-types like Electabuzz and Raichu as well, which are also 2HKOed. Lastly, Earthquake makes it much easier for Kangaskhan to scout for Counter users like opposing Kangaskhan and Poliwrath, which can be the difference between winning or losing the game.</p> <p>Kangaskhan's fourth move is largely dependent on its team and what threats the player wants it to cover. No option is truly better than the other. Rock Slide will 3HKO Gyarados and Aerodactyl as well as 2HKO Articuno, the latter of which otherwise wins consistently due to its nuclear Blizzard. Counter enables Kangaskhan to use its high HP to check Normal-type attackers, heavily deterring the use of moves like Body Slam, Hyper Beam, and Slash. It also gives Kangaskhan some extra utility, as switching into Hyper Beam and countering during the recharge can be a very strong tactic. Blizzard acts as coverage for Dragonite, 2HKOing it; however, Kangaskhan should be wary of taking a Thunder Wave if attempting this. Blizzard also 3HKOes Aerodactyl, Tangela, and Golem, the latter of which takes more damage than it would from Earthquake. It should not be used against Venusaur or Victreebel, as they take more damage from Body Slam.</p> <p>Kangaskhan is a wallbreaker at heart and should mostly be kept to this role. Kangaskhan is one of the best ways to punish Rest in the tier, and taking advantage of this is often key to its success: it's capable of 3HKOing even Hypno with two Body Slam uses followed up by Hyper Beam. Alternatively, Body Slam can 3HKO it a third of the time anyway. Similarly, a paralyzed Kadabra attempting to use Recover provides Kangaskhan with the perfect opportunity to switch in for free and threaten to OHKO it with Hyper Beam. Switching in on Seismic Toss against paralyzed Hypno or Kadabra is also valid, as they're forced to take a heavy hit from Kangaskhan. Kangaskhan is excellent at punishing greedy setup as well, switching in on Pokemon like Dodrio as they use Agility to completely reverse the game's momentum. It can also punish players looking to use Hyper Beam to finish Pokemon off early; Kangaskhan's amazing physical bulk allows it to switch in and punish the recharge with massive damage, even if it lacks Counter. It's good to switch Kangaskhan in after having a partner use Rest too, as players attempting to exploit the Rest will often switch in Pokemon like Persian and Dugtrio, which Kangaskhan excels against. The damage Kangaskhan can deal to a team is immense, so determining when it's appropriate to glean value from it early- to mid-game while avoiding paralysis is an important fundamental for players to learn.</p> <p>Kangaskhan appreciates paralysis support, as well as a reliable sleeper, though neither of these is necessarily required. Consequently, paralysis inducers such as Hypno, Dragonite, Kadabra, and Electabuzz are good partners. Kangaskhan pairs well with other sweepers—particularly those that are stonewalled by a particular Pokemon, including Articuno, Dugtrio, Dodrio, and Persian. Kangaskhan is very capable of overwhelming Pokemon like Haunter, Omastar, and Vaporeon, which typically stand in the way of at least one of these examples. Always remember to fine-tune teams in response to Kangaskhan's fourth move; for example, pairing Counter Kangaskhan with users of Explosion, such as Golem and Haunter, lets you smash a KOed Pokemon's replacement by countering your own Explosion. Haunter particularly pairs well, as it and Kangaskhan together can minimize Wrap's damage to a team by PP stalling it. Haunter also provides the aforementioned sleep support to shut down a potential check, such as Hypno or Kadabra. It can also lure in Pokemon that really don't want to fight Kangaskhan, like Dugtrio. Tangela is a suitable partner for its ease of spreading paralysis, good Dugtrio matchup, and amazing bulk allowing Kangaskhan to be significantly more aggressive. This role compression often gives space for more powerful Kangaskhan partners, such as Articuno and Dugtrio. Venusaur can act similarly to Tangela while further appreciating Kangaskhan's presence, as double switching to Kangaskhan punishes its usual Psychic-type switch-ins hard.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Kangaskhan is often labelled as a \"second Tauros\", and while Tauros is usually a better Normal-type attacker, Kangaskhan is not unusable and this label belies how differently it can act in practice. Kangaskhan is much more expendable during a game, fulfilling tasks that are normally too risky for the king of RBY OU. When compared with Tauros, Kangaskhan has some unique moves that make it more effective for this role as well, although they can be difficult to fit onto a set. For instance, Counter helps it oppose Normal-type attackers, and Mega Kick 2HKOes Chansey. Furthermore, Kangaskhan has formidable defensive bulk, which makes it more effective at switching into Body Slam, which cannot paralyze it.</p> <p>However, Kangakhan's hefty Normal-type competition does make it redundant on most teams. It has awful Special, completely failing to take strong neutral hits from Pokemon like Alakazam, Starmie, and Zapdos. Consequently, it's very challenging to switch Kangaskhan in against a lot of the tier, as one wrong move can mean significant damage; it often requires a double switch. Worse still, its Speed is just below what would be desirable to sweep, which makes it very reliant on extensive paralysis support to face these strong, fast special attackers. Overall, while Kangaskhan is not a replacement for Tauros by any stretch of the imagination, it retains a small niche when used alongside it, forming a strong wallbreaking core.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Kangaskhan's fourth moveslot is the most flexible, and it has a movepool to make use of it. Substitute is an interesting option to relieve prediction because Kangaskhan's HP gives it 103 HP Substitutes, just like Rhydon. This makes Kangaskhan a difficult adversary for Chansey, forcing it to use Seismic Toss twice to break its Substitute. However, Kangaskhan is vulnerable to paralysis throughout these interactions due to Substitute not blocking status in RBY, so it should only be attempted if Chansey is already paralyzed as well. Mega Kick is a valid option for 2HKOing Chansey, Starmie, and Tauros, but it can be difficult to fit into a set, and a miss often leads to Kangaskhan's demise. Rock Slide is another tempting option, allowing Kangaskhan to 2HKO Articuno and Jynx as well as 3HKO Zapdos 47.1% of the time, but it is very matchup-reliant. Thunderbolt is another valid option strictly for beating Cloyster, with two hits putting it in KO range for Hyper Beam. Alternatively, Thunder can 2HKO it after Body Slam.</p> <p>Kangaskhan is capable of using Counter to check Snorlax and Tauros, making them liable to KO themselves if they use Body Slam. Counter also lets Kangaskhan switch in on Hyper Beam, take it very well, and KO the user while it recharges. However, Kangaskhan's exploitable Special makes it deceptively difficult to find situations where Counter can be used. For instance, Kangaskhan is one of the few Pokemon where it's optimal for Tauros to use Blizzard instead of Body Slam before using Hyper Beam. Kangaskhan even takes relatively high damage from Ice Beam Snorlax. With the two most relevant targets for Kangaskhan's Counter being fully capable of scouting for it, it requires patience to pull off.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Strong Special Attacks: The main reason Kangaskhan doesn't see much high-level usage is because of how awful its Special is. Many Pokemon in RBY OU, including Cloyster, Exeggutor, Starmie, Alakazam, and more, will 2HKO it with their STAB moves. However, few of these Pokemon appreciate switching into Body Slam, as getting paralyzed or critically hit could let Kangaskhan subsequently blast them away with Hyper Beam. Bulkier special attackers like Slowbro and Lapras don't mind Hyper Beam much, though, and can often muscle past Kangaskhan with their STAB moves. Zapdos deserves a special mention for being immune to Earthquake and threatening a 2HKO with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: While Kangaskhan loves facing paralyzed Pokemon, this also means it wants to avoid paralysis itself. Ergo, Kangaskhan will often find itself being forced out by paralysis inducers like Jolteon, Zapdos, Alakazam, and Chansey, at least if it can't KO them first. If Kangaskhan is paralyzed, it becomes significantly more vulnerable to 2HKOs from special attackers like Exeggutor and Lapras. Ideally, Kangaskhan should only get paralyzed if it's a do-or-die situation.</p> <p><strong>Tauros Checks: Due to the dominance of Tauros in RBY OU, the tier is already well-equipped for dealing with Kangaskhan. Cloyster has amazing physical bulk, which makes it difficult for Kangaskhan to break past. Even Thunder is only a 3HKO, while Cloyster has an 84.7% chance to 2HKO in return with Blizzard and can recover the damage with Rest. However, Cloyster dislikes switching into Body Slam due to the potential paralysis making it difficult for it to utilize Clamp later on. To Kangaskhan's credit, it's capable of breaking past Cloyster with Thunderbolt or Thunder, although this isn't reliable. Slowbro possesses the physical bulk to trade blows with Kangaskhan, effortlessly paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and get Amnesia boosts on it. However, a Hyper Beam from Kangaskhan will KO it from 44.2% on a maximum damage roll, so it can be a high-variance matchup. Reflect Snorlax is another thorn in Kangaskhan's side, shrugging off anything thrown at it and forcing Kangaskhan out. Kangaskhan can try to use Counter on Body Slam, but this is somewhat predictable. Exeggutor can stomach most attacks from Kangaskhan and 2HKO with Psychic in return. Finally, Starmie is faster than Kangaskhan, can paralyze it, and 2HKOes with its special move of choice.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Body Slam is Kangaskhan's main STAB move, spreading paralysis and ensuring that nothing can switch in for free. A STAB Hyper Beam from Kangaskhan should never be underestimated, KOing most Pokemon from around 65%, including Chansey and Jolteon. Plus, it can KO Alakazam if it's taken minimal chip damage. Earthquake 2HKOes Gengar and Jolteon, but it also helps with scouting for Counter users like Chansey and Snorlax. Surf prevents Rhydon from walling Kangaskhan, 2HKOing it. It should be noted that Kangaskhan takes middling damage from Rhydon's Body Slam and can't be paralyzed by it, making it a very valuable point of entry.</p> <p>Despite Kangaskhan's \"second Tauros\" title, it should not be forgotten that it is both a mid-game utility attacker—think Snorlax—and a capable revenge killer, particularly against paralyzed teams. Once Kangaskhan has safely entered the field, it's challenging to switch into due to its coverage and the threat of paralysis from Body Slam, so scouting with the latter should be its main aim. Kangaskhan is very capable of scouting for Counter users thanks to its coverage, so it's good to be patient and settle for Earthquake against Pokemon that carry it, such as Chansey. Remember that Kangaskhan is extremely specially frail, so it should ideally only fight special attackers if they are paralyzed. Even then, it will rely heavily on being eased in through double switches, sleeping Pokemon, and Explosions.</p> "

Seadra's high Special and combination of Water- and Ice-type coverage, while not unique, let it batter teams when coupled with Agility. Seadra isn't just a solid offensive pick either: it can form a great defensive core with Pokemon like Blastoise as well, guarding against the myriad of Fire-types in the tier, most notably Charizard, thanks to their mixed bulk. Thus, Seadra fits very well on teams that demand a late-game sweeper that doubles as a defensive pivot.</p> <p>However, while Seadra is a good defensive Water-type, it is also checked excellently by them, struggling to break past Pokemon like Blastoise and Poliwhirl because of its shallow offensive movepool. Seadra's Speed, while it can boosted by Agility, is a bit mediocre, surpassed by common Pokemon such as Fire Spin users like Charizard, Rapidash, and Ninetales. Ergo, while it can stop Fire Spin users in their tracks, it can't do much about them pivoting into a check like Electrode.</p> ",

Hydro Pump can be used over Surf to score a 2HKO on Moltres and sometimes Mr. Mime, though inconsistency can be its downfall. Rest or Toxic can be used to improve matchups against wrappers, especially if running Hydro Pump; Rest gives Seadra a great matchup against Fire Spin users in combination with Agility and gives it significant longevity, while Toxic can more definitively stop wrappers like Dragonair, Moltres, and Charizard. However, Hydro Pump can be used here instead to close out the aforementioned 2HKOs while keeping Surf's reliability. Finally, Agility lets Seadra sweep late-game and remove the Speed drop from paralysis.</p> <p>Despite having a very shallow movepool, Seadra can be customized a bit. Hyper Beam can KO Mr. Mime from a minimum of 38.1%, dealing more damage than Surf, while also dealing more damage to Water-types than Hydro Pump. However, its utility outside of this is questionable at best and Hydro Pump tends to be more effective in practice. Double-Edge can be used for these targets and lacks a recharge turn, but it deals less damage than Hydro Pump against Water-types, so it isn't recommended. Ice Beam can be used alongside Rest to fish for a freeze, though Pokemon like Blastoise often do this more effectively. Seadra's unique access to Smokescreen as a Water-type is arguably useful to combat AgiliWrap Dragonair and AgiliSpin Moltres or Rapidash, but Toxic is often superior for putting a permanent, consistent stop to their antics.</p> <p>Seadra is best used on teams that appreciate multiple Water-types; thus, Pokemon like Blastoise and Kabutops make good partners. It also appreciates Exeggcute as a partner for walling Mr. Mime and having Sleep Powder, the latter of which helps Seadra more easily set up Agility. Additionally, Exeggcute appreciates Seadra's presence for combatting Fire-types like Moltres that severely threaten it. Similarly, Nidoking struggles against Charizard while helping Seadra's Electric weakness. Seadra can be used mid- and late-game as either a defensive pivot or a cleaner, gating off the tier's Fire-types and eventually swinging for victory. It's best to set up Agility as late as possible once its checks and counters have been removed, as Seadra is otherwise easily walled by a Water-type switch-in.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Seaking’s high attacking stats and access to STAB Surf make it one of the most fearsome mixed attackers in the tier. It can function as a mid-game wallbreaker as well as use Agility to become a deadly late-game cleaner. Seaking's bulk is also fantastic; it can comfortably avoid 2HKOs from Nidoqueen, Pinsir, and Fearow. Seaking’s Water typing gives it very few weaknesses, only really having to worry about non-STAB Thunderbolt from Nidoqueen, Dragonair, Staryu, Porygon, and Gastly. However, Seaking is almost completely walled by an unparalyzed Staryu, which resists Surf, can paralyze Seaking with Thunder Wave, and can use Recover to heal off the damage from Seaking’s Normal-type moves while wearing it down. Seaking also faces similar issues versus Porygon, although its lack of a Water resistance means Seaking can beat Porygon if it gets a critical hit. Although Staryu doesn't outclass Seaking, which still boasts better attacking stats and bulk, it is generally seen as the preferred Water-type thanks to its higher Speed and better movepool. Seaking is quite slow, requiring Agility to outspeed key threats such as Nidoqueen, Rapidash, Pinsir, and Fearow, while Staryu outspeeds Nidoqueen naturally. Although Seaking is bulky, it lacks reliable recovery, meaning it can be overwhelmed by the strong physical attackers in the tier. Despite these weaknesses, Seaking is still a formidable Pokemon, and its fearsome offensive presence should not be ignored when building a team.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Blizzard is able to secure a 2HKO on Fearow, Dragonair, and the rare Grass-types, which Seaking’s standard set is unable to do. However Surf hits everything else harder, and Blizzard generally isn't preferred over Seaking's Normal-type moves. The remainder of Seaking's options are much more niche. Rest is an option to give Seaking longevity, but the offensive nature of the tier makes it very difficult for Seaking to find an opportunity to wake up, and Staryu’s access to Recover makes it a much better Water-type for this role. Tail Whip and Mimic can be used as anti-Staryu options. Two Tail Whips get Staryu into Hyper Beam OHKO range, and Mimic can potentially copy Thunder Wave, Recover, or a coverage move from Staryu. However, both of these options are inconsistent and are generally not recommended.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Staryu: Staryu is without a doubt Seaking’s biggest counter. An unparalyzed Staryu can switch into Seaking then use Recover until it KOes itself from Double-Edge recoil. If Seaking uses Hyper Beam or Agility, Staryu can then paralyze it safely and continue to use Recover until it fully paralyzes.</p> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: Porygon is able to switch into all of Seaking's attacks and threaten paralysis while using Recover to heal off any damage it takes. Porygon does have to watch out for critical hits though, as a critical hit Surf into Hyper Beam is guaranteed to KO Porygon.</p> <p><strong>Dragonair</strong>: Seaking without Blizzard is helpless against Dragonair, and even if Seaking is running Blizzard it’s still outsped and can be wrapped. Dragonair is also one of the few Thunderbolt users in the tier, which Seaking does not appreciate.</p> <p><strong>Fearow and Pinsir:</strong> Although neither can switch into Seaking, Pinsir and Fearow both beat Seaking one-on-one; Fearow does, however, usually lose against Blizzard Seaking. Even if they lose the one-on-one fight, they’ll have chipped Seaking enough that something else can revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Seaking</strong>: Seaking is able to switch into itself well, and the face-off will typically result in the winning Seaking being at low enough HP that something can revenge kill it, although it will probably be able to fire off one more attack before being KOed if it set up Agility.</p> <p><strong>Slowpoke</strong>: Although rare, Slowpoke is able to switch into Seaking and paralyze it, which generally forces it out. Slowpoke is also able to hit it neutrally with Psychic and reapply the paralysis Speed drop with Amnesia.</p> <p><strong>Vileplume and Weepinbell:</strong> The rare Vileplume and Weepinbell are able to switch into a Seaking lacking Blizzard and inflict it with either paralysis or sleep. Weepinbell also has Razor Leaf, which 2HKOes Seaking.</p> ",

Surf importantly 2HKOes Nidoqueen, the best Pokemon in the tier, and it also puts nearly every Pokemon into KO range for either Fearow’s Hyper Beam or Drill Peck; the few exceptions such as Pinsir and Machamp are not good switch-ins to Seaking. Double-Edge comes off a respectable base 92 Attack stat, and it gives Seaking perfect neutral coverage along with doing more damage than Surf against physically frail Pokemon, such as Abra and Drowzee. Hyper Beam lets Seaking finish off foes, impressively KOing Drowzee from 49.5% and Staryu from 55.1%. Agility gives Seaking a form of speed control, allowing it to outspeed faster threats such as Nidoqueen and Rapidash, and it lets Seaking clean up a weakened team late-game.</p> <p>Seaking’s best teammate is Fearow, since Seaking is able to punish Fearow’s two biggest checks—Graveler and Omanyte—with a strong Surf. In return, Fearow heavily threatens Staryu, outspeeding it and 2HKOing with Double-Edge or OHKOing with Hyper Beam after the slightest bit of chip damage. Pinsir also appreciates Seaking breaking through the Rock-types, which enables it to wreak havoc with Slash. Seaking is also able to check Rapidash and Arcanine, Pokemon that Pinsir heavily struggles against. Ironically, Staryu and Porygon are also great teammates for Seaking, since they can trade paralysis with opposing Staryu and Porygon and potentially chip them to make them easier for Seaking to deal with. Dragonair is a notable teammate that can switch into Thunderbolt as well as spread paralysis, easing the burden of Seaking’s low Speed. Lastly, Graveler is a great teammate for Seaking to fall back on if it’s being overwhelmed by Fearow and Pinsir, while Seaking can help Graveler fend off Rapidash and Arcanine.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>With the addition of Swords Dance into its movepool, Seaking manages to function as a competent setup sweeper. With STAB Surf as an added bonus, it also blasts through common Hyper Beam switch-ins, such as Rhydon. Agility distinguishes Seaking from its competing Swords Dance users, as, even when paralyzed, it still poses a threat to sweep if the opposing team has been damaged. Once set up, Seaking can be a difficult Pokemon to stop, KOing frailer Pokemon such as Persian and Jolteon from over 75% HP with Hyper Beam. Seaking is decently sturdy as well, surviving two hits from Starmie's Thunderbolt and Alakazam's Thunder Punch a significant majority of the time, giving it more opportunities to set up than Kingler.</p> <p>However, Seaking has to use both Swords Dance and Agility to pose any threat to the opposition. With only Surf and a single physical attack in its attacking moveset due to this—most likely Hyper Beam or the middling Double-Edge—Seaking is not surpassingly rewarding either, struggling to break through bulky Pokemon like Reflect Chansey. It's also completely incapable of breaking through the common Gengar and is struck with Thunderbolt in return; the improved coverage of staples like Thunder Punch for Alakazam and Hypno does not help its case either. Seaking is rarely seen in Tradebacks OU by account of its committal nature and unexceptional reward, normally finding itself competing with Kingler, which, while lacking Agility, has far better damage output for the effort put in.</p> ",

A +2 Hyper Beam can also KO Pokemon such as Persian, Rapidash, Chansey, Jolteon, and Hypno if around 20% damage has been dealt prior. At +4, Seaking can OHKO Chansey, Hypno, Starmie, and even Tauros a third of the time. Surf covers Rock-types such as Rhydon, as well as dealing around 25% to Gengar, while also serving as an attack without a drawback.</p> <p>Seaking's movepool is barren but does have other options worth exploring; generally, it should always use a Double Dance set, or it's outclassed by Pokemon like Kingler. Blizzard is a plausible alternative to Surf for the freeze chance and 3HKOing Exeggutor and Zapdos, but the damage is otherwise unimpressive and it fails to OHKO Rhydon. Double-Edge, while having less drawback than Hyper Beam, is weak enough to largely diminish Seaking's threat level once set up. Hydro Pump may seem enticing, but it isn't compatible with the event-only Swords Dance, defeating its purpose.</p> <p>Seaking should commit to boosting only when it is possible to sweep. +4 Attack is needed to OHKO most Pokemon in the tier, and +2 Speed is needed to avoid being revenge killed by faster unparalyzed Pokemon. This amount of setup is daunting, but achievable. Seaking's bulk can withstand two hits from almost everything besides Razor Leaf or very strong Thunderbolts. Taking paralysis is also normally inconsequential in the process; thanks to its setup-heavy nature, Seaking is efficient as reapplying foes' Speed drops from paralysis if an opposing team has been riddled with it. Once Gengar, Electric-types, and Razor Leaf users are eliminated or confirmed to be absent, and extra-bulky Pokemon like Snorlax have taken a little damage, a single free turn can be all the opening Seaking needs to complete the three turns of setup needed to sweep. Against slower teams, Swords Dance can be all that's necessary to break through slower, bulkier Pokemon in Hypno, Chansey, and non-Reflect Snorlax variants. To achieve optimal conditions for a sweep, Seaking should be paired with consistent sleepers such as Jynx and Exeggutor, and Reflect Snorlax to check opposing Snorlax. Seaking is overwhelmed by Gengar, Zapdos, Jolteon, and Electabuzz, so Jolteon can be a helpful partner to safely switch into their attacks, while Seaking in turn can check Ground-types like Rhydon in a pinch for Jolteon. Rhydon, Chansey, and Alakazam can also check these Pokemon by comfortably switching into Thunderbolt, though, depending on the coverage of those Seaking checks, these partners might struggle to consistently switch in.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Starmie is one of the most common Pokemon in RBY OU thanks to its Psychic typing and access to Recover and Thunder Wave. Starmie's physical bulk allows it to be a defensive check to virtually every Pokemon lacking an Electric-type attack and take two hits from almost any physical attacker. Additionally, its access to many special attacks such as Blizzard, Psychic, and Thunderbolt turns it into an offensive threat versus anything without instant recovery. Although Starmie naturally outspeeds many common Pokemon, most notably Tauros, oftentimes a paralyzed Starmie functions well in its defensive role due to its ability to block sleep-inducing moves from almost anything, while the ability to paralyze any non-Ground-type Pokemon via Thunder Wave makes it difficult to pressure offensively even then. Among the Recover and Soft-Boiled users in OU, Starmie also possesses a special defensive utility, as it's the only one of them to not be forced out immediately by Snorlax when paralyzed and is able to fight back against it offensively as well when running a STAB move. Those traits make Starmie usable in pretty much any state of the game, turning it into a very flexible Pokemon and easy addition to most RBY OU teams.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ice Beam is an option over Blizzard for the increased PP if Starmie tries to fish for freezes on opposing Alakazam or Chansey lacking Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Hyper Beam is an option to surprise weakened Chansey or Alakazam, but Starmie loses a lot of potential if you drop a move for it. Hydro Pump is an option on a late-game Starmie, as it can 2HKO Tauros and generally do decent damage to anything that does not resist it, especially with a critical hit.</p> <p>Hydro Pump can be used for strong STAB hits, and can be especially powerful when combined with Special drops from Psychic, but running the two moves in combination severely limits Starmie's coverage options and leaves it struggling to hit Pokemon such as Exeggutor or an opposing Starmie.</p> <p>Starmie also has access to Reflect and the rare Light Screen. However, it will struggle to fit those moves onto its moveset most of the time.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey is the number one counter to Starmie, as Starmie realistically cannot beat it with any of its movesets, especially when Chansey is paralyzed. In return, Chansey beats Starmie by paralyzing it and beating it down with Thunderbolt, which Starmie will almost certainly fail to outstall with Recover due to full paralysis and critical hit chance. Alternatively, a Chansey lacking Thunderbolt can attempt to freeze an unparalyzed Starmie, as it runs little risk of losing by doing that. However, in order for Chansey to reliably beat a paralyzed Starmie, it needs to run Thunderbolt, since Seismic Toss's PP does not surpass Recover's massive 32 PP, meaning Starmie can outstall variants without Thunderbolt. It's also worth noting that an unparalyzed Chansey runs the risk of getting frozen by Starmie's Ice-type attacks, especially if it cannot threaten with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam</strong>: Alakazam has little to fear from Starmie as well. Although it does not possess any super effective move to hit Starmie with, its higher Speed and Special mean Alakazam can trade paralysis against Starmie and proceed to damage it with Seismic Toss or go for Special drops with its own, vastly stronger Psychic. The best Starmie can do is try to freeze an unparalyzed Alakazam or paralyze it and go for Special drops of its own in order to gain the Speed advantage and make Blizzard do more damage. Recover's massive PP leaves Starmie outstalled relatively quickly with that approach, though, since Alakazam can switch out to something like Chansey to relieve the Special drops. Additionally, while Surf can help Starmie in the Alakazam matchup, it usually still is not enough to beat it, since it only 4HKOes. The possibility of critical hits combined with multiple full paralysis turns on Alakazam, however, does give Starmie a fighting chance.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Even though Starmie is relatively bulky for a Pokemon with instant recovery, it still takes a good chunk from Snorlax's Body Slam. Alongside Starmie's relative trouble to deal great damage to Snorlax plus Snorlax frequently running Rest to heal damage and sometimes carrying Hyper Beam, this makes it a solid check to Starmie. If nothing else, Snorlax's Body Slam is another tool to paralyze Starmie, which generally makes it easier to handle. However, Snorlax has to be careful versus Starmie carrying a STAB move, especially Psychic, since one Special drop means it can no longer reliably Rest stall even a paralyzed Starmie. Another tool Snorlax has to dispose of Starmie is Amnesia. Since Amnesia Snorlax frequently only carries Blizzard and Body Slam as attacking moves, it still does not reliably beat Starmie, but outspeeding Starmie thanks to the additional Speed drop caused by using Amnesia when both are paralyzed surely helps break it with Body Slam. However, Amnesia does not protect Snorlax from Starmie's high critical hit chance, meaning Starmie can even break through Amnesia Snorlax with two consecutive Psychic critical hits or a potential freeze from an Ice-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Zapdos</strong>: Starmie struggles to stay in against Electric-type STAB moves from Jolteon and Zapdos or trade a Thunder Wave with them, since it cannot attempt to Recover off the damage they inflict piece by piece. Jolteon is definitely the best offensive check to Starmie. It does not like paralysis very much, but since it is one of the rare Pokemon that naturally outspeed Starmie, it can afford to take Starmie on even when paralyzed. Starmie can at best 4HKO Jolteon with Psychic, while Jolteon outspeeds and 2HKOes it. Zapdos does not fare as brilliantly against Starmie as Jolteon does due to being weak to Blizzard and not naturally outspeeding it, but it still does beat Starmie one-on-one, though it greatly appreciates it being paralyzed beforehand. Note that both Zapdos and Jolteon have a high critical hit rate thanks to their high Speed. One critical hit Thunderbolt from them will easily OHKO Starmie.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Attacks</strong>: Razor Leaf from Victreebel does upwards of 73% to Starmie, meaning that Victreebel does not need to hit many Wraps to put a paralyzed Starmie in range of being KOed by Razor Leaf. If Sleep Clause is already active, Starmie absolutely needs to be paralyzed for Victreebel to beat it, though, since Starmie 2HKOes Victreebel with either Psychic or Blizzard. Mega Drain on Exeggutor is another option to pressure paralyzed Starmie trying to block Sleep Powder, since it 3HKOes Starmie and 2HKOes it after a Special drop from Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Attacks: Other non-STAB Electric-type attacks coming from the likes of Gengar, Lapras, and opposing Starmie will put enormous pressure on Starmie, potentially taking it down with a single untimely full paralysis or critical hit.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Recover and Thunder Wave alongside Starmie's incredible Speed turn Starmie into a very sturdy Pokemon that possesses the ability to paralyze the foe and outspeed it after, even when paralyzed itself, and proceed to recover its health, since most attacks do not deal 50% to it. This makes Starmie tough to break and is why this move combination allows Starmie, despite its high Speed, to take paralysis even early on in the game and avoid being crippled by it as much as most other Pokemon. In fact, a paralyzed Starmie is very good at blocking sleep-inducing moves from common sleepers like Exeggutor and Sing Chansey lacking Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Starmie's traits do not end at its defensive role, however. In its last two moveslots, Starmie is able to run a variety of powerful special attacks, which can be chosen to hit almost every Pokemon in the tier except Chansey super effectively or at least decently hard. In that context it is worth noting that, due to its high Speed, Starmie has a very high chance of 22.46% to score a critical hit, which frequently enables Starmie to successfully knock out opposing Pokemon by shooting for critical hits.</p> <p>Blizzard most notably hits Exeggutor, Zapdos, and Rhydon, as well as Victreebel and Dragonite. It is chosen over Ice Beam due to having more power while only being 10% less accurate. In addition to the coverage Blizzard provides, another reason to use it lies in its chance to score a freeze on opposing Pokemon such as Chansey and Alakazam or just about any Pokemon if you're desperate. Moves that typically go alongside Blizzard are Psychic and Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Psychic is Starmie's best option to hit Pokemon like Gengar and the Normal-types, thanks to gaining STAB. This is especially important against Snorlax, as a Starmie without STAB moves struggles quite a bit to really hurt it. Another important feature of Psychic is the chance to score Special drops, which can help force switches and thus spread paralysis on the opposing team. This is especially noteworthy against Chansey, especially those running Reflect, since enough Special drops can force it out even when it has already set up a Reflect, which Starmie will otherwise fail to achieve. It can be useful against Alakazam as well, albeit not as consistently, since Alakazam itself can cause Starmie's Special to drop. It is worth mentioning however, that the Blizzard + Psychic set does have some issues with running out of PP rather quickly against opposing Recover users and will not be able to hurt opposing Starmie and Slowbro.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is used to hit opposing Water-types super effectively, including Lapras, Cloyster, and especially opposing Starmie and Slowbro. Being able to threaten other Starmie, especially when they lack Thunderbolt themselves, and beating Slowbro with a critical hit are the biggest selling points for Thunderbolt. Additionally, Thunderbolt is Starmie's only super effective move against Articuno, which itself doesn't really threaten Starmie much but can be annoying to actually knock out. If Thunderbolt is chosen alongside Blizzard, it should be noted that Starmie will struggle to properly threaten Gengar and Snorlax, as the latter can usually Rest stall Starmie, especially if it is paralyzed.</p> <p>Either move can be run alongside Blizzard whether or not Starmie is used as a lead, though as a lead Starmie usually prefers Psychic, as it's usually more useful for early-game purposes; Thunderbolt's coverage alongside Blizzard is appreciated if Starmie is kept for late-game, when opposing Pokemon like Chansey and Snorlax are taken care of otherwise.</p> <p>Psychic and Thunderbolt can be used on the same set if you want to retain the power versus Starmie and Slowbro and the ability to threaten Snorlax, which can be very dangerous for teams that have to rely on either of those Pokemon to fend off Starmie if Chansey is taken out already. Not being able to do much versus Exeggutor, especially when facing it as a lead, plus being unable to hit Rhydon super effectively can be annoying, but neither of them really likes going up against Starmie, since Psychic still does a lot to Rhydon, and Exeggutor usually cannot do much back if it lacks Mega Drain and Starmie cannot be put to sleep anymore. Exeggutor will be paralyzed and receive permanent chip damage in the process of trying to beat Starmie. However, Starmie cannot beat it without giving it multiple chances to fish for Special drops, which might force Starmie out and give Exeggutor the opportunity to put a switch-in to sleep. Additionally, Exeggutor has plenty of time to go for its Explosion, meaning Starmie will likely only trade with Exeggutor. Furthermore, not running Blizzard means you miss out on hitting especially the rare Dragonite super effectively, which then does not have to fear being outright KOed by Starmie and may be able to try its luck with setting up Agility on a weakened team.</p> <p>Another STAB option Starmie has is Surf. However, Water-type moves do not provide much in terms of coverage in the RBY OU metagame, since Fire-types are basically nonexistent and will be unable to beat Starmie anyway, and the ones you might meet such as Moltres are already hit super effectively by Blizzard. Nevertheless, Surf is used to OHKO Rhydon, hitting it by surprise, and it's Starmie's best option against Alakazam and Jynx, giving it a chance to take them down with some luck. It is worth noting that even with Surf, Starmie does not necessarily beat Alakazam; it will force it to Recover more frequently, though, and thus create turns to gain momentum by switching in a physical attacker on a Recover. Like Psychic, Surf also serves as a stronger STAB move against neutral targets such as Snorlax. The lack of a Special drop chance, however, makes it the inferior choice for that purpose. Usually the move to go alongside Surf is Thunderbolt, since Blizzard and Psychic are somewhat redundant with Surf. Since Surf and Thunderbolt both have 24 PP, this Starmie set is best suited for drawn-out games that include PP stalling. It must be noted that with Thunderbolt and Surf, Starmie is walled by Victreebel and Exeggutor, the latter of which has a good chance to force Starmie out due to its high Special and Psychic dropping Starmie's Special, giving Exeggutor opportunities to use Sleep Powder on a switch-in. Additionally, Starmie can no longer hurt opposing Zapdos and Dragonite. Pairing Surf with Blizzard is possible to avoid these issues, but the inability to hit opposing Water-types makes this less desirable.</p> "

  "Mr. Mime": {
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Mr. Mime is the most dominant Pokemon in RBY NU, functioning as the tier's premier special attacker, with its great typing, high Speed, and unresisted coverage making it versatile and hard to consistently check. Said high Speed lets it take advantage of its coverage extremely effectively, outspeeding or Speed tying every threat that it hits super effectively besides Charizard, Fearow, and the niche Primeape. Thunderbolt lets Mr. Mime check key Water-types like Seadra, Kabutops, and especially Blastoise, an incredibly valuable role. It is also one of the fastest paralysis spreaders in the tier, forcing out numerous offensive threats such as Electrode and Fearow and crippling Fire Spin users for missing. Nearly every competitive team uses Mr. Mime, partially because it is one of the few reliable checks to itself.</p> <p>While Mr. Mime is an incredibly good Pokemon, its terrible Defense makes it decently frail, being 2HKOed by some of the Pokemon it's supposed to threaten offensively, such as Moltres and Kabutops. Due to this, it's incredibly reliant on its Speed stat to stay relevant throughout the battle. This means Thunder Wave users such as Clefable and Porygon usually force it out. In addition, it comes out incapacitated from the Mr. Mime mirror match and is forced out by other Psychic-types like Exeggcute and Drowzee. Its Speed, while impressive, still leaves it susceptible to notable Fire Spin users like Charizard, Rapidash, and Ninetales. While it doesn't take heavy damage from Fire Spin, it usually lacks recovery to mitigate the chip damage. Also, outspeeding Mr. Mime lets the Fire Spin users pivot to a revenge killer that can exploit its poor Defense like Fearow. It especially struggles with Rapidash, Ninetales, and Moltres, being unable to deal notable damage without Psychic Special drops and taking hefty damage from Fire Blast.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mr. Mime has few truly relevant other options, as its main set is the most consistent across the board and leaves little room for other moves. Rest is the most common option; it can be used over Seismic Toss to grant Mr. Mime more longevity against Psychic-types and Clefable. It is especially relevant versus Exeggcute, which becomes unable to threaten it outside of Explosion. While Mr. Mime's frailty gives it few chances to wake up normally, the high frequency of Fire Spin users and opposing Mr. Mime allows it to come in and burn sleep turns somewhat reliably. Barrier allows Mr. Mime to somewhat mitigate its frailty, turning normally threatening moves like Kingler's Body Slam from a guaranteed 3HKO to a possible 5HKO. It also gives it a safety net against +2 Hyper Beam from Pokemon like Pinsir, Kingler, and Kabutops, which otherwise threaten Mr. Mime with a potential OHKO. Counter can deal heavy damage to a physical attacker such as Raticate or Pinsir given Mr. Mime's physical frailty. Notably, Mr. Mime will likely force out Raticate right away with the threat of paralysis, allowing Counter to deal massive damage to the switch-in. Solar Beam is Mr. Mime's strongest attack versus Golem, but the charge turn leaves it open to exploitation. Flash could be used to inconsistently drop accuracy, but the move is mostly outclassed by Thunder Wave, which effectively achieves the same thing except against Ground-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Exeggcute is one of the best dedicated checks to Mr. Mime, resisting both Psychic and Thunderbolt while threatening it in return with paralysis or sleep. However, unless Exeggcute is running the rare Double-Edge or sacrifices itself with Explosion, it can struggle to damage Mr. Mime, only inflicting a possible 7HKO with Psychic. Drowzee, while rare, threatens Mr. Mime with Thunder Wave, Hypnosis, or a 3HKO from Seismic Toss. Mr. Mime's Seismic Toss only 4HKOes, leaving Drowzee relatively safe.</p> <p><strong>Clefable: Clefable is only 4HKOed by Mr. Mime's Psychic. It can also retaliate with paralysis, sleep, and heavy damage, with Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam KOing after minor chip damage. However, a Special drop from Psychic leaves Clefable KOed by Psychic, vastly worsening the matchup.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Mr. Mime's frailty means faster offensive threats often force it out, most of which are Fire-types. Arcanine and Ninetales are only 4HKOed by Psychic while threatening 2HKOs back with Fire Blast and Hyper Beam. While Moltres does not outspeed Mr. Mime, it is only 3HKOed by Thunderbolt 47.1% of the time, granting it an opportunity to set up Agility while threatening a 2HKO with Fire Blast in return. While it cannot switch in due to paralysis, Charizard is a notable example, outspeeding Mr. Mime to use Fire Spin effectively and threatening a 3HKO with both Fire Blast and Slash. While they also typically cannot switch in due to the threat of paralysis, other revenge killers such as Fearow, Electrode, and Raticate also outspeed Mr. Mime and threaten it with severe damage or paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Paralysis removes one of Mr. Mime's primary strengths in its Speed. This lets Pokemon it normally forces out like Nidoking and Blastoise overrun it with heavy damage. Paralysis from opposing Mr. Mime also makes navigating the mirror matchup tricky. A paralyzed Mr. Mime can make late-game scenarios much more inconsistent, such as not having fast Electric-type coverage to threaten a Kabutops that is standing in the way of Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Golem: Golem threatens a 2HKO with Earthquake, as well as Earthquake following Body Slam. Its ability to avoid a Psychic 2HKO and safely come in on attempted Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt from Mr. Mime accentuates this danger.</p> ",

Thunderbolt is Mr. Mime's strongest option against NU's many Water- and Flying-types, including Blastoise, Seadra, Poliwhirl, Charizard, Moltres, and Kabutops, 2HKOing or 3HKOing all of them. Thunder Wave cripples Wrap users, revenge killers like Charizard and Arcanine, and other Mr. Mime, making Mr. Mime a check to itself; you should think carefully before trading paralysis with the opponent's Mr. Mime, however. Seismic Toss is Mr. Mime's best attack against Psychic-types like Exeggcute, Drowzee, Abra, and itself.</p> <p>Threatening Water-types makes Mr. Mime suited to partner with Fire-types like Ninetales and Rapidash. Thunder Wave lets it support sweepers like Golem and Nidoking, crippling roadblocks like Poliwhirl and Seadra. Mr. Mime also appreciates these Ground-types for switching into opposing Mr. Mime's Thunder Wave. Mr. Mime also appreciates dedicated checks to itself like Clefable and Exeggcute, as opposing Mr. Mime is one of its greatest roadblocks.

Additionally, its terrible typing and low Special allow the tier's many Fire-types to often OHKO it outright, while its BoltBeam weakness dooms it against common threats like Nidoqueen and Dragonair. Despite its lower Speed, Pinsir is preferred as a Bug-type attacker due to its better coverage, while Fearow better fills the role of a speedy physical attacker.

Slash bypasses Pokemon relying on Reflect, such as Abra and some Clefable variants, while Swords Dance and Hyper Beam make it tough for Normal-neutral Pokemon to switch into. Scyther is also one of the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the metagame; it ties for the second-fastest Pokemon in the tier with Rapidash and has a superb critical hit ratio of 20.5%. Its already terrific Speed can be bolstered with Agility, meaning it cannot be pinned down by partial trappers and opposing Agility users like Dragonair and Moltres either. With adequate paralysis support and good prediction, Scyther can theoretically be used as a powerful late-game cleaner.</p> <p>However, Scyther has too many flaws to warrant a spot on most teams. Its low bulk and horrid defensive typing render many attackers able to 2HKO or even OHKO it. These include notable Pokemon such as Blastoise, Nidoking, Golem, and Kingler. Scyther's reliance on Speed means that even with Agility, it is severely debilitated by paralysis compared to other sweepers. It also has a barren movepool: besides the miserably weak Wing Attack, it only possesses Normal-type attacks, meaning Rock-types like Golem and Kabutops can easily switch in and make progress against it. Other fast sweepers, such as Mr. Mime and Electrode, can provide more offensive presence throughout matches, as they sport better coverage moves and provide utility with status moves like Thunder Wave. While Scyther can be used to lure its counters and grant switch-in opportunities for its teammates like Blastoise and Kingler, this tends to be prediction-reliant and inconsistent.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Swords Dance makes Scyther's Hyper Beam one of the most threatening moves in the tier, always or possibly OHKOing Pokemon like Mr. Mime, Electrode, and Rapidash at +2. Agility allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, notably including Electrode and Rapidash, which usually threaten it out with super effective moves. If Scyther is paralyzed, Agility can also remove the Speed drop. Slash is its primary attacking move, almost always scoring a critical hit and punishing foes for switching into predicted Swords Dance, 3HKOing foes like Charizard, Poliwhirl, and Ninetales. Unfortunately, it does not get a power boost with Swords Dance.</p> <p>Scyther's shallow movepool leaves it with few other options. Agility is the most replaceable, as Scyther is already fast and does not need the additional Speed most of the time. Toxic discourages AgiliWrap Dragonair and Fire Spin users like Moltres, Charizard, and Rapidash from setting up on it. Unlike Slash, Double-Edge gets the power boost from Swords Dance and can be utilized if Slash's immediate power is not desired. Wing Attack can be used to damage Gastly, but not only is Gastly rare, Wing Attack also has lower damage than Slash even against super effective targets. Substitute can be used to ease prediction, rack up poison and burn damage, and fish for full paralysis and misses, such as against Fire-types like Charizard, Ninetales, and Moltres.</p> <p>As Scyther struggles to make headway against Rock-types like Kabutops and Golem, Grass-types like Exeggcute and Weepinbell are useful teammates. Scyther is also vulnerable to Fire-types like Ninetales, Rapidash, and Moltres, so Water-types like Kabutops and Blastoise to withstand Fire- and Rock-type attacks are also appreciated. Scyther can function as a lure for Rock-type Pokemon, which makes it easier for its partners like Blastoise and Kingler to predict an attack. Sleep inducers such as Poliwhirl and Venomoth can cripple Scyther’s counters and can facilitate setup opportunities.

  "Jynx": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Jynx has a lot of unique features that differentiate it from other Psychic-types such as Alakazam and Starmie. For one, Jynx is the second fastest sleep inducer after the unreliable Gengar, making it a fantastic potential lead option that can incapacitate its checks by making them fall asleep. STAB Blizzard also allows Jynx to win the matchup versus Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Rhydon, and Zapdos. This is all in addition to the standard expectations of a fantastic Psychic-type: access to the powerful STAB Psychic and a high Special stat. Jynx also has its faults, though. Despite its key resistances to Ice- and Psychic-type attacks, Jynx can become easily trampled over by physical attacks, namely from Normal-types such as Tauros and Snorlax, due to its pitiful HP and Defense stats. While its key resistances to Blizzard and Psychic may say otherwise, the main way Jynx provides defensive utility is being the switch-in for predicted sleep-inducing moves. Additionally, nearly all teams run at least two solid checks to Jynx between Chansey and either Starmie or Alakazam, sometimes both. Due to the omnipresence of these checks, their access to Thunder Wave and reliable recovery, and Jynx's susceptibility to paralysis and being worn down over time, Jynx's role is undermined. Jynx can use Rest to restore its health and alleviate its paralysis, burning off sleep turns against Pokemon that can't do much back to it like a paralyzed BoltBeam Starmie. However, doing so opens itself up to a slew of physical attackers such as Tauros and Snorlax that can freely switch into it while it's asleep.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>As previously stated, Jynx's most useless move is Rest, and therefore if one wishes to use one of these other options, it should usually replace Rest. Ice Beam can be used over Blizzard to give Jynx more PP on its Ice-type STAB option. Running Ice Beam can also come in handy in long, drawn-out games to secure a freeze against one of the opponent's Pokemon, although the drop in power is noticeable. A healthy Jynx can use Counter to improve its matchup against Tauros and Snorlax; it is situational, and Jynx has to be at a sizable amount of health for this strategy to be pulled off, although it can also be used after taking damage from a previous turn and the foe switching out. Mimic can be utilized to potentially copy an important utility or coverage move such as Thunder Wave, Soft-Boiled, Recover, or Thunderbolt from one of Jynx's switch-ins such as Chansey or Starmie. However, forfeiting Rest for only a chance to copy a useful coverage move is somewhat risky and still leaves Jynx prone to being paralyzed. Body Slam can be utilized to fish for paralysis against incoming switch-ins like Alakazam, although it is not guaranteed, cannot paralyze Chansey and Snorlax, and is fired off of Jynx's exceedingly below-average Attack stat.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Gengar: While Gengar cannot switch in safely on Jynx whatsoever, it can put Jynx out of commission from the very beginning of the game with Hypnosis. Gengar is also faster than Jynx and can threaten to use Explosion at any time.</p> <p><strong>Starmie, Chansey, and Alakazam</strong>: Starmie, Chansey, and Alakazam can sponge all of Jynx's attacks, paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and restore their health with Soft-Boiled or Recover, acting as some of the most consistent Jynx checks after one of their teammates has been put to sleep. Although they are all susceptible to being frozen with Blizzard, they can whittle Jynx down and force it to use Rest early, limiting the number of chances Jynx has of freezing something.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Tauros and Snorlax can take advantage of Jynx's low HP and Defense and love switching into it after it uses Rest, forcing in a teammate to take the incoming Body Slam. Tauros can also pick up the KO against Jynx with Hyper Beam with a little prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Slowbro, like Starmie, resists Jynx's dual STAB combination of Ice and Psychic and can use Jynx as a setup opportunity to boost with Amnesia and Rest off all the damage it has taken. Lapras is another great example of an offensive check to Jynx despite its lack of reliable recovery due to its 4x resistance to Blizzard and access to Body Slam, although one of its teammates will need to have already been put to sleep. The Jynx user may also decide to trade damage off against Lapras with the end goal of revenge killing it later with another teammate such as Tauros or Alakazam. Getting too much damage off on these Pokemon after Jynx puts something to sleep will often lead to the defensive core of a team crumbling.</p> ",

Blizzard is Jynx's strongest STAB option against certain Psychic-types such as Alakazam and nails Pokemon such as Zapdos and Exeggutor. It can also be used to fish for a potential freeze while scouting which of the opponent's Pokemon has a sleep-inducing move. Psychic rounds out Jynx's coverage, receives STAB, and hits Pokemon such as Gengar and Lapras. It also has the potential to lower a foe's Special stat, which can come in handy to more convincingly win matchups versus special attackers, notably an opposing paralyzed Chansey. Rest provides Jynx with a way of restoring its health and alleviating paralysis. While Jynx doesn't have too many opportunities to use Rest due to its lackluster physical bulk, it can use Rest and burn sleep turns on more passive foes such as Chansey, Alakazam, and Exeggutor lacking Double-Edge. Burning off sleep turns is not always easy, however, as generally speaking most teams pack anywhere from two to three solid checks to Jynx, leaving it liable to exploitation. Jynx is primarily used as a lead due to its above-average Speed tier and access to a fairly accurate sleep-inducing move. However, Jynx can also be used mid-game due to its high Special and fantastic offensive dual STAB combination of Blizzard and Psychic. Note that removing statused Pokemon such as paralyzed Alakazam and Chansey from play allows for Jynx to more freely use Lovely Kiss. The ideal way to utilize Jynx is to put one check to sleep with Lovely Kiss, potentially freeze one of Jynx's remaining checks, and then switch it into potential sleep inducers.</p> "

Jynx has decent Speed and a decent Special stat to back up its Lovely Kiss and strong STAB moves. Being an Ice-type even allows it to pivot into and wall Ice Beam Chansey, Mewtwo, and Slowbro before they set up with Amnesia.</p> <p>However, Jynx has very low Defense, taking heavy damage from most physical attacks. It is slower than several notable Pokemon such as Tauros, Gengar, Zapdos, and Mew. Jynx can also end up as setup bait for Slowbro, Mew, and the dangerous Mewtwo after it has put something to sleep and gotten its freeze, requiring very careful use after landing both statuses. Overall, Jynx finds its role as a strong sleep- and freeze-inducing lead with good matchups against standard Psychic-type leads.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Jynx’s last moveslot has a few options available to it. One option is Ice Beam, which has more PP and therefore more opportunities to freeze than Blizzard alone. Another option is Seismic Toss, which allows Jynx to pressure threats it wouldn't otherwise be able to deal with, like Slowbro and Mewtwo after Amnesia. Body Slam can spread paralysis, but its inconsistency and Jynx's very low Attack stat make this mostly not worth it. Mimic is a gimmick that can give Jynx useful moves such as Recover, Thunder Wave, and Amnesia but is very matchup- and luck-based. Jynx has the option of dropping Psychic to run two other moves and potentially catch something off guard at the cost of not being able to pressure Chansey. An interesting option is running 7 DVs in Defense to OHKO Tauros with Counter after getting hit by Body Slam. However, this significantly hurts Jynx, as it already somewhat lacks longevity, and it can also be useless if the opponent is careful and uses Earthquake.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Slowbro: Slowbro sets up on Jynx, takes minimal damage from Psychic and Blizzard, can heal Seismic Toss damage, and doesn’t care about Body Slam paralysis. However, it does fear a freeze. A Slowbro that is asleep from Rest can be chipped by Seismic Toss into the range of a teammate’s Explosion. Keep in mind that Slowbro with only Ice Beam must be at +6 to even 3HKO Jynx.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: While less common, Starmie always walls Jynx's coverage and heals the little damage it may take. It can also effectively absorb Jynx's Lovely Kiss and use Thunder Wave to cripple Jynx. However, too many Psychic Special drops can force it out.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is a very common lead, is faster than Jynx, and carries Hypnosis. It can also use Explosion to OHKO Jynx, which can put Jynx's team at a big disadvantage if there is no backup sleeper. However, Hypnosis's chance to miss means Gengar should fear possibly being put to sleep itself or taking big damage from Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Pokemon that can use Thunder Wave such as Mew, Jolteon, and Alakazam can severely cripple Jynx, as it has very little use without the option of a fast Lovely Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey takes minimal damage from any of Jynx's moves and forces it out with Seismic Toss. It can also put Jynx to sleep with Sing or paralyze it with Thunder Wave. However, Jynx can freeze Chansey or drop its Special, forcing it out. Also, if Ice Beam is Chansey's only attacking move, Jynx can wall it and use Rest to heal damage.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo sets up on Jynx as long as it does not get frozen. Mewtwo can also use Thunder Wave to cripple Jynx. However, Jynx has a chance to beat Mewtwo if it gets fully paralyzed for a few turns before it sets up, or if Jynx lands some critical hits.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Lead Tauros versus lead Jynx is a gamble for both sides. Tauros is able to fish for Body Slam paralysis, a critical hit Body Slam that OHKOes 66% of the time, or Stomp flinches. On the other hand, if Tauros fails to get any of those, Jynx can try to put it to sleep, use Counter, or use Blizzard for heavy damage. However, Tauros can also use Earthquake on the first turn to avoid Counter and guarantee a KO with Hyper Beam on the next turn. Also, Tauros is able to come in later in the game and finish off a weakened Jynx with little issues.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Lovely Kiss is Jynx's best move, allowing it to likely disable one of the opponent's Pokemon for most of the game. Blizzard and Psychic hit the majority of the tier for solid damage. Psychic also has a chance to lower the foe's Special, helping Jynx deal a little bit more damage with subsequent attacks. Counter allows Jynx to fire off massive damage after taking a Normal-type move, usually Body Slam from Tauros, Snorlax, or Mew. However, it is very prediction reliant, as all three run Earthquake and can use it to avoid damage from Counter. Rest helps Jynx stall Chansey, eliminating an obstacle for your own Mewtwo, as well as increasing Jynx's overall longevity. One must be aware that many physical attackers and setup sweepers can take advantage of a sleeping Jynx, so Rest must be used carefully.</p> <p>Jynx sometimes gets an early-game freeze before it can try to freeze Mewtwo, so Light Screen Chansey is a premier teammate, as it provides one of the tier’s best checks to Mewtwo. Light Screen allows Chansey to avoid the 3HKO from Mewtwo's Psychic and paralyze it with Thunder Wave. Another good option is Flash Chansey to PP stall opposing Mewtwo if Jynx is running Rest. Jynx is great both with and against Explosion. Teammates with Explosion such as Gengar, Mew, and Exeggutor, or Snorlax with Self-Destruct, appreciate Jynx chipping the opposing team into their range. Also, Jynx should be used to take Explosion or as sleep fodder after it has inflicted its status effects to prevent Mewtwo and Slowbro from using it as setup fodder.</p> <p>Teammates that can check Mew are very helpful, as Mew can come in against Jynx and set up for free with Swords Dance, especially if Jynx has used Rest. The best check to Mew is Mew itself; Transform Mew is a very solid counter to opposing Swords Dance Mew, as it can easily turn the opponent's strategy against them. Gengar is another good teammate that completely counters mono-Body Slam Mew. Rhydon and Golem are other good checks to mono-Normal Mew and can support Jynx by absorbing other Normal- and Electric-type attacks, both of which can be problematic for it. Rhydon is stronger and bulkier than Golem and can help pressure the opposing team more immediately. However, both Jynx and Rhydon are somewhat slow for the Ubers metagame, and Amnesia users can use them as setup fodder. Golem, while weaker and frailer than Rhydon, is slightly faster and has Explosion as a one-time nuke, which can take out almost anything on the opposing team and applies immense constant pressure.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. The most up to date moveset for Electabuzz is the following.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Electabuzz has an incredible movepool, fine-tuning it is often a misguided attempt that makes it easier to counter than it should be. Changing its listed coverage can be very difficult to justify, as it covers every Pokemon in the tier. Mega Kick can replace Seismic Toss, as it 2HKOes Kadabra while doing more damage to Hypno and opposing Electabuzz. However, it does less damage to Tangela and has only 74.6% accuracy. Hyper Beam performs similarly and has higher accuracy, which may make it more enticing, but Raichu often runs it more effectively thanks to its superior Attack stat. Substitute can scout an attack or an opponent's switch-in without needing to predict, and Electabuzz can use it to fish for full paralysis and a free chance to attack. However, Electabuzz can only take advantage of Substitute late-game when Pokemon that spread status like Hypno and Kadabra are either KOed or able to be KOed with one attack. Submission may seem enticing to damage Normal-types and Golem, but Thunderbolt or Psychic, respectively, damages them more consistently as a result of better accuracy, making it difficult to recommend. Counter can sneak an OHKO on Persian using Slash, but in this situation, Electabuzz should be going for Thunder Wave paralysis.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types are immune to Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt while dealing massive damage back with STAB Earthquake. Dugtrio outspeeds Electabuzz and can OHKO with a critical hit Earthquake, and without a critical hit if Electabuzz has taken even slight damage. Alternatively, Dugtrio can predict Electabuzz switching out to set up a Substitute. However, Dugtrio fears Body Slam's paralysis and doesn't like taking chip damage, so it struggles to switch in. Meanwhile, Golem is only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss and Psychic, so it can come in fairly safely and force Electabuzz out. Golem then has the opportunity to set up a Substitute, use Explosion, scout with Body Slam, or just get off decent damage with a STAB move. However, it can't repeatedly switch in should Electabuzz predict correctly, which can force it to use Explosion noticeably earlier, and Special drops can make Psychic a 3HKO.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Electabuzz struggles to damage Grass-types and hates getting statused, making Tangela and Venusaur great checks. Tangela carries Stun Spore in addition to Sleep Powder and isn't weak to any of Electabuzz's attacks, making it generally a better check. However, Venusaur does have more offensive power—Razor Leaf is a clean 3HKO—and may do more for a team overall.</p> <p><strong>Hypno: Hypno is the best Electabuzz check that does not resist Thunderbolt. It can paralyze Electabuzz or put it to sleep while not worrying about Electabuzz's own Thunder Wave. Hypno sometimes even prefers being paralyzed so that it cannot be put to sleep later on. Hypno also has good bulk, only being 4HKOed by Seismic Toss and sometimes Thunderbolt. Meanwhile, it can 3HKO Electabuzz with Psychic, and any drop to Electabuzz's underwhelming Special is a very bad situation for it. However, if Hypno is caught using Rest, Electabuzz can be very dangerous, as a single critical hit can force Hypno to use Rest again; this opens it up for wallbreakers like Kangaskhan to switch in and finish the job.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Electabuzz relies on its Speed, so paralyzing it greatly cripples its effectiveness, exposing its decidedly mediocre bulk. Therefore, the mere possibility of getting paralyzed often forces it out, giving momentum to Thunder Wave and Body Slam users like Clefable, Kadabra, Hypno, Kangaskhan, and even some Dragonite variants. However, many Body Slam users, such as Vaporeon and Omastar, greatly fear Electabuzz's STAB Thunderbolt. In a pinch, though, they can fight back and hope for a Body Slam paralysis, especially in Vaporeon's case, since Thunderbolt only 3HKOes it. Non-Seismic Toss variants of Electabuzz will struggle to punish a Tangela switch-in, allowing it to get off Stun Spore with impunity.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: While Electabuzz has fantastic coverage, it tends to struggle with opposing Electric-types. Opposing Electabuzz, Raichu, and Electrode may trade Thunder Wave with it while resisting Thunderbolt. Raichu also notably outdamages Electabuzz, possessing a higher Special stat, Surf, and Hyper Beam. Electrode doesn't entirely mind paralysis, as possessing Explosion means it always has some kind of value; however, it may become forced to use Explosion against Electabuzz in some scenarios, which may not be a favorable trade, as there are vastly better targets like Hypno and Tentacruel. Overall, if Electabuzz needs to be slowed down, going for a paralysis trade with your own Electric-type is absolutely fine.</p> ",

          "description": "<hr /> <h1>Outdated analysis</h1> <h1>Overview</h1> <p>Electabuzz is the premier Electric-type in RBY UU thanks to its base 105 Speed, which lets it outspeed tier-king Tentacruel and force it out with Thunder Wave. Its Speed also grants it an impressive 20.51% critical hit rate, making it difficult to consistently wall. Additionally, Electabuzz is blessed with good coverage in Psychic and Body Slam, which gives it a variety of ways to check threats like Dugtrio, Tangela, and Venusaur. Naturally, this also makes Electabuzz effective late-game, making Pokemon like Articuno and Dodrio think twice before going for a sweep. With its strong hit-and-run playstyle, proactive gameplay is key to being successful with Electabuzz.</p> <p>However, Electabuzz can be inconsistent, which makes it a bit difficult to use on teams. It struggles while paralyzed, so it cannot typically stay in against common Thunder Wave users such as Kadabra and Hypno and struggles against Body Slam users like Gyarados, Vaporeon, and Omastar that it otherwise matches well against. Its Special is unimpressive against neutral- or high-Special targets, with its Thunderbolt only 3HKOing Tentacruel and Vaporeon and dealing less damage than Seismic Toss on average against Hypno. Furthermore, Electabuzz lacks reliable recovery—unlike Kadabra, which operates similarly—while being 2HKOed and 3HKOed by most physical and special attackers, respectively, making it very easy to wear down. The massive presence of Dugtrio is very problematic for Electabuzz as well, with it constantly switching in on Thunderbolt and threatening a KO from Earthquake with minimal prior damage. Electabuzz also competes with Raichu, which has Surf, Agility, and higher Attack and Special; however, outrunning Tentacruel and having Psychic usually makes Electabuzz the better choice, especially as a lead.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>A fast Thunder Wave is Electabuzz's claim to fame and forms its main role in tandem with Thunderbolt: paralyzing fast Pokemon and breaking through bulky Water- and Flying-types such as Gyarados and Dodrio. This paves the way for sweepers like Dugtrio and Articuno while also making wrappers like Tentacruel and Dragonite more devastating, providing massive momentum in the long run and often choking the opponent out of options late-game. Electabuzz's Thunderbolt is quite threatening, being one of few moves to have a reasonable chance to OHKO Gyarados, 76.9%; it also 2HKOes Dodrio, Dewgong, and Omastar. Being faster than Tentacruel and having Thunder Wave also makes Electabuzz incredible at forcing the opponent into predictable switches, particularly to Dugtrio, Hypno, and Tangela; those switches are ripe for exploitation, making a well-played Electabuzz a massive late-game threat, especially when factoring in being faster than Tentacruel.</p> <p>Body Slam gives Electabuzz an effective midground option, notably letting it paralyze Dugtrio switching in. It also does decent damage to physically frail Pokemon like Kadabra, especially with Electabuzz's good critical hit rate. When one is unsure about using Thunder Wave, Body Slam is normally the best option. Psychic provides another midground option that covers Haunter and Tentacruel more effectively; getting a Special drop can make Thunderbolt significantly more threatening as well, giving a near-guaranteed KO on Tentacruel after Psychic damage. It's also helpful for hitting Venusaur and Haunter super effectively, which are common problems for most Electric-types. Another less appreciated boon is that if you use Electabuzz to trade paralysis, Psychic Special drops reapply the foe's paralysis Speed drop; this allows Electabuzz to muscle past with Thunderbolt thereafter. Seismic Toss can be used over either Body Slam or Psychic to deal more damage to Golem, Hypno, and Tangela on average.</p> <p>Electabuzz should ideally play hit-and-run because of its distaste for paralysis, but it can also trade paralysis if the team doesn't rely on its offensive prowess and speed control. However, a late-game sweep should never be counted out, as Electabuzz is excellent in simplified game states, gradually picking off limping Pokemon. It is ideal to bring Electabuzz in through a teammate's Wrap or on an opposing Pokemon using Rest, as it's frail and generally wants to stay healthy for late-game. Predicting an opponent's switch to Tentacruel or Gyarados can also be effective; Articuno and Dugtrio are good Pokemon to use for baiting these in. Electabuzz should generally use Thunder Wave whenever you are confident that a fast Pokemon, like Tentacruel or Persian, will stay in to attack. Finding these opportunities is important because Hypno often switches into Electabuzz, stealing momentum and using paralysis sustained from Thunder Wave to block further status.</p> <p>Electabuzz can be used as a lead; this is primarily for the common Tentacruel matchup. Because it outspeeds and paralyzes Tentacruel, Tentacruel is forced out immediately, giving Electabuzz an uncontested Thunder Wave, switch, or damage opportunity. In this situation, Body Slam is the most appropriate as a midground option, covering their switch while dealing decent damage with a chance of paralysis. Thunder Wave is also useful to status sleep leads like Haunter and Venusaur, as well as rarer leads like Dodrio. Lead Electabuzz tends to be less valuable, so sacrificing it to sleep is often the appropriate option, sparing more valuable common teammates like Tentacruel, Hypno, and Kadabra. On teams where Electabuzz is okay with being paralyzed, it can trade paralysis with Kadabra and attempt to break through it with Seismic Toss as well, though Electabuzz is at a disadvantage due to a lack of recovery, so switching to a paralysis absorber like Hypno or Vaporeon is recommended instead. Against Hypno, sacking Electabuzz for sleep or trading Thunder Wave is valid because, in the prior case, it can be woken up through Tentacruel's Wrap with relative ease later on, and for the latter case, it is capable of muscling past paralyzed Hypno through critical hits. However, while it may seem enticing to use Thunder Wave against Hypno right away, this often invites Dugtrio in, so using Body Slam is usually more reliable.</p> <p>Electabuzz is best used on teams that are already efficient at checking Dugtrio while having a strong offensive backbone. The best way to facilitate this situation is with Flying-types like Aerodactyl, Articuno, Dragonite, and Gyarados—and, to a lesser extent, Tangela—which check Dugtrio by forcing it to think twice before it uses Earthquake. These Pokemon also invite Tentacruel in, which Electabuzz feasts on. Articuno is particularly valuable, as Electabuzz breaking through Water- and Grass-types is instrumental in allowing it to sweep late-game, making the pair a strong offensive core. Wallbreakers such as Dodrio, Kangaskhan, and Persian take advantage of Hypno using Rest, a key part of gaining momentum in RBY UU, and Electabuzz spreads paralysis for them. Dodrio also has a great matchup against Grass-types like Venusaur and Tangela, as well as an immunity to Earthquake to set up on Dugtrio, making it among the best Normal-type Electabuzz partners. Kangaskhan is also helpful against Dugtrio thanks to its high physical bulk and appreciates Electabuzz paralyzing its checks for it to wallbreak later on. While used on almost every team, Tentacruel can bait opposing Tentacruel in very frequently, and its Wrap support is instrumental in allowing Electabuzz to enter the game safely, making it an especially perfect partner. While similar to Electabuzz, Kadabra is also a great partner, forming a strong special attacking core that can overwhelm common Hypno + Kadabra cores; trading Electabuzz with one of them lets Kadabra and Hypno teammates wreak havoc. Finally, Venusaur performs excellently alongside Electabuzz, being a fine Pokemon to double switch into when predicting the opponent will go to Hypno or Dugtrio, getting a free sleep move off as to enable Electabuzz to switch in later; this can be done as early as turn 1 one with lead Electabuzz.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Magmar stands out as an interesting Fire-type in RBY NU, trading the typical access to Fire Spin for an incredible movepool. With a multitude of fantastic attacks like Psychic, Submission, and Fire Blast, as well as many useful utility moves such as Body Slam and Counter, Magmar has a potential move to fit nearly every situation. This large movepool also makes it hard to predict, with the opponent forced to make tough decisions if not every move has been revealed. Its typing grants it some defensive utility versus the other Fire-types such as Moltres and Ninetales, as well as being fantastic offensively versus Grass- and Bug-types like Exeggcute, Venomoth, and Pinsir.</p> <p>However, Magmar is one of many Fire-types in the tier and is unfortunately mostly outclassed by more popular picks such as Arcanine, Charizard, and Ninetales. Lacking Fire Spin is unfavorable, as it's incredibly useful to freely pivot out from checks like Blastoise and maintain momentum. Arcanine also lacks Fire Spin, but it features much more favorable bulk. Magmar's movepool grants it better matchups versus the likes of Kabutops, but its middling stats still hold it back, and it often can't fit everything it needs to function consistently. Magmar is also physically frail, making Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon like Nidoking and Golem especially frightening foes to face.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Fire Blast is Magmar's strongest STAB move and has a useful 30.1% chance to burn, making potential checks like Kabutops less inclined to switch in. Seismic Toss is a decent neutral option, dealing consistent 4HKOes to bulky Pokemon such as Blastoise and Moltres. Submission most notably 3HKOes Kabutops, a Pokemon that many Fire-types like Arcanine can struggle with, while also 2HKOing Raticate and 3HKOing Clefable and Porygon. Psychic is able to 3HKO Nidoking and the rare Nidoqueen, which can be improved by Special drops. It also grants it a potential role as an effective Moltres check, threatening Special drops while taking little damage from Fire Blast. In addition to this, if Kabutops and Nidoking take a singular Special drop, Magmar can win the interaction cleanly. Body Slam makes use of Magmar's surprisingly decent Attack and can threaten paralysis against Pokemon like Mr. Mime, and Submission and Psychic nail resistant Pokemon like Golem.</p> <p>Magmar's wide movepool makes it pretty customizable. Counter can heavily punish Raticate, Clefable, and Pinsir for using their primary attacking moves, as well as any Pokemon using Body Slam as coverage. Hyper Beam is a viable alternative to Body Slam, letting Magmar more convincingly beat physically frail Pokemon—like Mr. Mime from a minimum of 48.4%. However, against some bulky threats like Blastoise and Moltres, it doesn't deal vastly more damage than Seismic Toss. Toxic firmly prevents Dragonair from sweeping with AgiliWrap if it attempts to use Magmar as setup fodder, as well as checking other wrappers such as Rapidash and Ninetales. Toxic can also be used to support wrapper teammates, increasing their net damage output when using their partial-trapping moves. Finally, Smokescreen possibly allows Magmar to beat Pokemon it otherwise would not, such as AgiliWrap sweepers. In addition to this, Smokescreen can reapply the foe's Speed drops from paralysis.</p> <p>Magmar is best used on teams that want the offensive threat of a second Fire-type alongside Charizard, but don't want the inconsistency versus Kabutops that Fire-types like Arcanine and Moltres can cause. Having multiple Fire-types can cause the team to struggle offensively versus other Water-types like Seadra and Blastoise, so checks to these such as your own Blastoise, Mr. Mime, and Electrode are appreciated. Blastoise is an especially good choice, as it also helps versus Golem, which Magmar can merely 4HKO with Seismic Toss and Psychic—while being OHKOed by Earthquake in return.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Pinsir's gargantuan base Attack and access to Slash make it a top-tier threat. Slash 2HKOes or 3HKOes all foes aside from Ghost- and Rock-types. Unlike most other offensive Pokemon, such as Seaking and Rapidash, Pinsir lacks true walls. Its access to Submission and Seismic Toss means that Pinsir can break through the Pokemon that don't mind its Slash, namely Rock-types and Gastly. Pinsir's Speed is also quite good, as it is only outsped by Rapidash, Arcanine, Fearow, and Abra—it ties with Staryu and outspeeds every other tier staple, notably including Nidoqueen and Seaking. However, Pinsir's weaknesses to Fire and Flying make it lose badly to Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow. While its Ground resistance does allow it to pivot into certain threats, it's often moot since most Earthquake users, including Nidoqueen, possess super effective coverage against Pinsir. Pinsir's reliance on weak moves to make progress against Pokemon that resist or are immune to Slash is another issue, as it makes it easy to switch in faster threats or Gastly, which can put it to sleep. Pinsir's excellence in the metagame is undeniable when the best Pokemon in the tier, Nidoqueen, runs Fire Blast solely for it, but the fact that the tier prepares for it means that Pinsir needs team support to unleash its full potential.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Body Slam can be used to spread paralysis, but Pinsir generally makes more progress using its standard set. Swords Dance is an enticing option, as the sheer power of a boosted Hyper Beam can OHKO nearly every non-Rock- or Ghost-type. Additionally, a +2 Hyper Beam has a 71.8% chance to OHKO Porygon, and a +2 Submission will always do so. However, using Swords Dance and Hyper Beam means Pinsir must give up Bind and one of its coverage moves, leaving it unable to threaten certain foes.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire Blast Users: Rapidash and Arcanine outspeed Pinsir and have a 79.5% chance to OHKO it with Fire Blast, while it can only rarely 2HKO Rapidash with Slash and always 3HKOes Arcanine. Nidoqueen and Machamp 2HKO Pinsir with Fire Blast, and it can only 3HKO them in return, but Pinsir outspeeds them and can win if they're chipped.</p> <p><strong>Fearow: Fearow outspeeds Pinsir and has a 96.8% chance to 2HKO with Drill Peck, while Slash only has a 30.7% chance to 2HKO back. However, it is a tenuous check since it can generally only switch into Pinsir once.</p> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: Seismic Toss only 3HKOes Gastly and it is immune to all of Pinsir's other moves, so it can effortlessly switch in and put Pinsir to sleep with Hypnosis. However, once Sleep Clause is active, Gastly loses one-on-one and will usually need to pivot into in a faster threat.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Pinsir's Submission only 3HKOes Graveler, and its Rock Slide has an 87.6% chance to 2HKO back, which becomes 100% after Submission's recoil. Omanyte loses one-on-one, but it can easily force Pinsir to use Submission or Seismic Toss, allowing it to pivot in a faster threat.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Once paralyzed by threats such as Staryu and Drowzee, Pinsir is easy to overwhelm. Threats that normally lose due to being outsped, such as Seaking and Omanyte, now easily beat Pinsir. Dragonair can easily use Wrap to bring Pinsir into KO range.

Submission is Pinsir's strongest attack against Rock- and Normal-types, 2HKOing Omanyte and Porygon and 3HKOing Graveler. Seismic Toss hits Gastly, which is immune to all of Pinsir's other attacks.

      "overview": "<p>Pinsir is the sole viable Bug-type in RBY OU thanks to an amazing Attack stat that can be further boosted by Swords Dance, allowing it to let loose nuclear Hyper Beams while trapping with Bind. A +2 Pinsir is nothing to be trifled with, capable of beating Snorlax outright with Submission and possessing a Hyper Beam that can OHKO the physically frailer Pokemon in the tier, including Jolteon, Chansey, Jynx, Alakazam, and Victreebel. Additionally, Pinsir has the strongest non-STAB Slash in the game, hitting nearly as hard as Persian right out of the gate. This makes it one of the few physical attackers that can contest Reflect users like Snorlax and Chansey, the latter of which it can 2HKO. Pinsir's typing gives it surprising defensive utility as well, resisting Earthquake and not being hit super effectively by Thunderbolt, giving it use over other Swords Dance users like Kingler. Pinsir is by no means slow relative to OU either, outpacing Victreebel and Cloyster, and, with paralysis support, it can absolutely mow down even the faster Pokemon in the tier, acting as a surprisingly strong late-game sweeper.</p> <p>However, like all RBY Bug-types, Pinsir suffers from some severe downsides. While powerful, Pinsir cannot hit Gengar without Seismic Toss, possessing strictly Normal- and Fighting-type attacks in its offensive movepool. Ergo, Gengar can effortlessly switch in and let out a completely uncontested Hypnosis while Pinsir is forced to switch out or pivot out with Bind. Pinsir also suffers from a bit of four moveslot syndrome, demanding Swords Dance and Hyper Beam while having to pick between Slash, Submission, and Bind for its last two slots, all of which can significantly affect its matchups. Worse still, Pinsir is very reliant on its Speed to sweep, as being outsped exposes its noticeably mediocre special bulk, leading to it getting forced out by paralysis inducers such as Alakazam, Starmie, and full HP Chansey. These flaws make Pinsir a rare sight in RBY OU, but a serviceable pick nonetheless.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While a highly contested slot, Pinsir's fourth moveslot is the most flexible. If a team absolutely needs another Pokemon to hit Gengar, Seismic Toss is a suitable option, allowing Pinsir to punish its attempts to switch in. After two strikes, Gengar often becomes much more inclined to Explode, making it a bit more predictable. However, fitting Seismic Toss always brings severe opportunity cost, causing Pinsir to lose out on Submission's fantastic damage against Normal-types or Bind's utility.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Gengar: Pinsir can't even touch Gengar without Seismic Toss, possessing no alternatives to hit it. Worse still, Gengar's Thunderbolt is a guaranteed 3HKO, dealing up to 41.4% per hit, or it can fire off a completely uncontested Hypnosis. However, Bind can immobilize Gengar while allowing Pinsir to bring in a teammate such as Alakazam for free, which does add a degree of risk.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Paralysis rains on Pinsir's parade, exposing its severely lacking special bulk and making it near-incapable of running over the opposing team. There is counterplay if Pinsir's foe is paralyzed as well, though, as Pinsir can attempt to use Swords Dance to reapply the Speed drop and continue whaling on them. Pokemon like Exeggutor and Lapras become much more threatening when Pinsir is paralyzed, utilizing their powerful special attacks to 2HKO it. As a result, Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie will often force Pinsir out by the threat of paralysis alone unless it's in a situation where paralysis doesn't matter. This also makes Body Slam paralysis from Pokemon like Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon particularly annoying, as Pinsir can't often stomach more than two hits from any given Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Pinsir's special bulk of 65/55 is awful; even Jolteon's Thunderbolt and Starmie's Surf have a high chance to 2HKO it. As a result, Pinsir is very frequently forced out by special attackers unless it can KO them first, such as if they're paralyzed or chipped. However, Pinsir does often have the chance to attack them once, which can situationally be all it needs in endgame scenarios.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Foes: Pokemon like Rhydon, Cloyster, and Slowbro put large amounts of pressure on Pinsir—especially if it's paralyzed—while being able to stomach its hefty physical blows. These Pokemon can also strike back with equally devastating attacks; in Rhydon's case, Rock Slide can deal upwards of 80% in a single hit, which can be a KO if Pinsir even tries to respond with Submission.</p> <p><strong>Counter Users: If Pinsir can't KO Chansey outright, Counter Chansey will OHKO Pinsir if it uses any of its offensive attacks bar Bind. This can also apply to more niche Counter users, such as Snorlax, Alakazam, and Kangaskhan. However, if Pinsir has Bind, it has a solid way to counter-play the strategy, immobilizing the Counter users and chipping them into Hyper Beam range.</p> ",

It should be noted that Swords Dance reapplies the paralysis Speed drop to paralyzed foes, so if Pinsir itself is paralyzed, it isn't game over just yet. This effect also applies to paralyzed Pokemon attempting to switch in, making doing so extremely risky.</p> <p>Pinsir's last two moveslots largely depend on what its user wants. For the third moveslot, Slash gives Pinsir immediate power and provides a better matchup against Reflect users, while Body Slam lets Pinsir spread its own paralysis, making it more self-sufficient. For the fourth slot, Submission, while unreliable and giving Pinsir significant blowback for its use, is an amazing way to dispatch Cloyster, Chansey, and Snorlax at +2, dealing well over 50% to each of them. In fact, after two boosts, Pinsir can outright OHKO non-Reflect Snorlax. Alternatively, Bind can occupy either the third or fourth moveslot, letting Pinsir pivot into its teammates to gain a better position while also dealing serious chip damage. This works especially well against paralyzed teams, forcing them to switch around to PP stall it while often taking around 7% each time if Pinsir has picked up even a single boost, which rapidly adds up over the course of the move.</p> <p>While this is all well and good on paper, using Pinsir in practice is fairly difficult. It's best to keep it to endgame scenarios, when the opposing team has likely been thoroughly paralyzed. However, it's perfectly fair to switch it in on a Chansey's Soft-Boiled turn or a Snorlax's Rest or Earthquake, both options that Pinsir doesn't really care about. Similarly, Recover turns from paralyzed Alakazam and Starmie are good opportunities for Pinsir to sneak in and force damage on the opposing team; if either of these Pokemon experience full paralysis when attempting to respond, they could absolutely be KOed the following turn. Fellow partial trapping pivots and Explosions are other good switch-in chances. Picking up a boost with Pinsir is also quite difficult, though Pinsir is not against taking a hit to set up if it means winning the game there and then. Punishing a Snorlax Rest with Pinsir is among the best ways to get a boost with impunity, often forcing Snorlax out lest it is KOed from there. Pinsir works best on teams that have multiple paralysis inducers, one of which will likely be the ubiquitous Chansey. Jolteon synergizes very well with Pinsir, appreciating Pinsir's Ground resistance and ability to 2HKO Rhydon with +2 Submission.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Pinsir has a unique place in RBY UU thanks to its access to Bind, decent Speed, and potentially massive damage output by virtue of Slash and Swords Dance. Its Bug typing provides it with a resistance to Earthquake; this makes it work well alongside Tentacruel and Electric-types like Electabuzz and Raichu, especially when checking Dugtrio for them. Pinsir's biggest selling point, however, is its sheer threat level should it boost with Swords Dance, which allows it to flatten paralyzed teams. Few Pokemon can switch into Pinsir's +2 Hyper Beam; some standout calculations include a 41% chance to OHKO Tentacruel and a 2.6% chance to OHKO Hypno. This makes Pinsir a particularly brutal punishment for Pokemon that are often forced to use Rest, such as Vaporeon and Hypno. While not perfect, Pinsir's Speed lets it outpace Dragonite and Hypno, which makes it great at revenge killing them. Further, having a partial trapping move faster than Dragonite can be crucial in many situations, allowing Pinsir to keep Dragonite from setting up with Agility and switch to a counter, such as Tentacruel, for free. Bind allows Pinsir to form a partial trapping core alongside Tentacruel and Dragonite as well, providing teams with significant momentum, especially if the opposing team is stricken with paralysis.</p> <p>As with almost any Bug-type in RBY, though, Pinsir is held back by some severe flaws. Pinsir has no STAB attacks to speak of and is forced to rely only on Normal- and Fighting-type moves. It thus competes with the Normal-type attackers of the metagame—Persian, Dodrio, and Kangaskhan—for a place on teams. Pinsir's Normal and Fighting reliance also makes it completely invalidated by Haunter, which forces it to switch or pivot out with Bind. It also struggles with Rock-types if it lacks Submission, and its weakness to Rock Slide doesn't help there. While Pinsir's Speed helps in some minor ways, it just isn't good enough: Pinsir is outpaced by common threats like Tentacruel, Dodrio and Kadabra, which are very capable of threatening it due to its mediocre typing or low Special. As a result, Pinsir relies heavily on teams that spread paralysis efficiently, making it somewhat dependent on the player's Hypno to function well. These flaws are only worsened by it being debilitated by paralysis and mandating setup, which can be very difficult to accomplish in the Wrap-infested format. Paralysis isn't the only status to give Pinsir trouble either, as Toxic—a substantially common way to deal with Dragonite—puts a firm cap on Pinsir's use of Bind, causing it to take more damage than it would normally deal, which is only made worse by Bind's inherent inconsistency. Overall, Pinsir has some very strong points in its favor, but it's a high-risk pick that necessitates a team built around it as well as a competent player.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Body Slam can allow Pinsir to be more self-sufficient in the paralysis department while denying switches in from faster threats. However, Slash's damage is sorely missed in this case, causing Pinsir to miss out on many potential KOs and become more reliant on Swords Dance. Seismic Toss can be utilized, as it's Pinsir's sole option to hit Haunter, but it does little to help the matchup; switching out or pivoting with Bind is really all Pinsir can do. Toxic can be helpful for dealing with Dragonite, which otherwise uses Pinsir as setup fodder. However, Pinsir doesn't necessarily need Toxic, as it can use Bind to safely bring in a counter, such as Tentacruel.</p> <p>Bind can be cut for moveslot flexibility, but this causes Pinsir to be a severe momentum sink mid-game. Should the opponent reveal Haunter or a Rock-type, Pinsir is forced out and has to have a teammate take a hit for it, which can let the opponent open holes. Switching out with Bind ensures momentum isn't lost, as foes are unable to move, even Haunter. However, with Bind cut, Pinsir becomes more consistent late-game, as it's less reliant on Bind's shaky accuracy.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Haunter: Pinsir can't touch Haunter at all without the largely undesirable Seismic Toss. To make matters worse, Haunter is faster and gets a near-guaranteed 3HKO with Thunderbolt. As such, Pinsir is normally forced to switch out through a manual switch or Bind. It should be noted that Bind still immobilizes Haunter, allowing Pinsir to safely bring in a counter like Dugtrio, so using Bind to catch Haunter switching in is viable counterplay.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: If Pinsir doesn't run Submission, it's forced out by Rock-types. However, if it does, it usually 2HKOes them at +2, albeit with significant recoil damage and questionable reliability. Golem is adept at coming in on Hyper Beam and outright 2HKOes Pinsir with Rock Slide, meaning it wins in this situation even if Pinsir has boosted. Omastar deals up to 72% with Hydro Pump, which can be followed up with Blizzard to dispatch Pinsir. In addition, considering Submission recoil, Omastar can easily 2HKO Pinsir with Surf. Aerodactyl is another particularly solid counter, only facing a near-guaranteed 4HKO from Submission while 2HKOing in return with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Pinsir's special bulk is very poor, so threats like Articuno and Kadabra 2HKO it with their STAB moves. However, these matchups are volatile if Pinsir is at full health. Pinsir Speed ties with Articuno and therefore can potentially win if it's boosted; Slash + Hyper Beam will 2HKO Articuno quite frequently. Against Kadabra, Pinsir can deal up to 91% with Slash alone, and +2 Hyper Beam will always OHKO it unless there's an unfortunate miss. As such, Kadabra is restricted to revenge killing Pinsir, which can be stifled by teammates like Hypno, though Pinsir being forced out isn't necessarily ideal. While they are very rare, Fire-type Pokemon like Moltres greatly threaten Pinsir with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel: Tentacruel is faster than Pinsir, can pivot out of bothersome situations through Wrap, and heals paralysis with Rest. It's very difficult for Pinsir to set up in games due to the existence of Tentacruel's Wrap, constantly delaying it while chipping Pinsir into KO range. On top of this, Tentacruel is near-guaranteed to 2HKO Pinsir with Surf. However, Pinsir is very capable of exploiting paralyzed Tentacruel, possessing a potential OHKO with +2 Hyper Beam. If Pinsir paralyzes Tentacruel with Body Slam on the switch, Tentacruel is liable to outright lose. Overall, though, this matchup is very unfavorable and using Pinsir against a healthy Tentacruel is strongly discouraged.</p> <p><strong>Dodrio</strong>: Dodrio can revenge kill Pinsir with Drill Peck, 2HKOing it. It can't switch in to save its life though, taking massive damage from Slash, which has a small but notable chance to 2HKO; alternatively, Slash + Hyper Beam is a guaranteed 2HKO. Furthermore, if Pinsir has boosted, it can OHKO Dodrio with Hyper Beam 89.7% of the time. Dodrio can't fight Pinsir at all if it's paralyzed.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>The premise of the set is simple: set up with Swords Dance and put 'em away. Hyper Beam is Pinsir's claim to fame, KOing Pokemon from around half HP even without setup and becoming an OHKO machine if boosted. Slash gives Pinsir immediate and significant power, but Submission—albeit somewhat inconsistently—allows Pinsir to beat Rock-types that try to switch in on Hyper Beam, as well as deal massive damage to Persian and Kangaskhan. Finally, Bind allows Pinsir to provide its team with momentum while chipping threats into Hyper Beam KO range, which becomes near-effortless against paralyzed teams. When boosted by Swords Dance, Bind can be surprisingly powerful; for example, it can deal up to 10.4% to Hypno per hit, quickly bringing it into KO range.</p> <p>Pinsir can be a fairly unwieldy Pokemon to use, relying on a paralyzed team to sweep reliably. However, it has multiple points of entry, particularly Dugtrio, which it can beat outright, 2HKOing it with Slash and only being 3HKOed by Rock Slide 0.1% of the time. Outside of this, Pinsir can punish paralyzed Pokemon heavily, be it by revenge killing them or switching in on their physical attacks, which is made safer by the potential for full paralysis. Paralysis further benefits Pinsir's Bind, giving it a safety net for its more frequent misses than Wrap. Pinsir is capable of exploiting Pokemon using Rest quite well with Swords Dance, which can potentially mean an outright win depending on the game state. Pinsir fits on teams that appreciate its Ground resistance and physical attacking prowess. This particularly applies to those looking to get the most mileage out of Tentacruel and Electric-types, so long as the team is capable of providing extensive paralysis support in return.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Pinsir is a frightening Swords Dance sweeper in RBY NU, possessing one of the highest power levels in the tier in the tier alongside Bind and Slash. Once set up, Pinsir goes on a rampage, quickly chipping down Pokemon with Bind before letting loose one of the strongest Hyper Beams in the game. Pokemon like Mr. Mime, Dragonair, Venomoth, Exeggcute, and Poliwhirl are even threatened with outright OHKOs at +2, while Blastoise and Clefable need minimal Bind chip damage to OHKO as well. Pinsir is by no means slow either, tying Nidoking and Seadra and getting the jump on Blastoise and Kabutops. When forming a core with wrappers such as Rapidash, Moltres, and Charizard, Pinsir can add some much-needed physical attacking prowess. With paralysis support from the likes of Mr. Mime, Venomoth, and Porygon, Pinsir can also sweep past otherwise faster checks like Charizard and Moltres.</p> <p>However, Pinsir's movepool is extremely shallow, making it linear and open to very simple counterplay, such as switching in Golem or even just having Counter. With the high viability of Fire-types in RBY NU, Pinsir's low Special also comes back to haunt it, leaving it OHKOed by even Charizard's Fire Blast and limiting setup opportunities against special attackers like Seadra. This special frailty means Pinsir is best used on teams populated by Water-types such as Blastoise and Kabutops, the latter with which actually competes heavily with it. That competition further extends to Kingler, which possesses similar qualities to Pinsir while having reliable counterplay to Rock-types in Crabhammer, as well as other Pokemon like Sandslash. However, it fares well alongside these Swords Dance users, and Bind can be enough for it to distinguish itself over them. Worse still, Pinsir's Speed, while good, is still not quite desirable; Fire-types revenge kill it, as do Venomoth, Fearow, and tier-king Mr. Mime. Its suboptimal Speed also makes paralysis even worse, exposing its fragility and making it very difficult to clean up even paralyzed teams. Regardless, Pinsir functions as an effective wallbreaker or sweeper, supporting top-tier Pokemon like Charizard very well in the metagame.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Pinsir can drop Bind for more offensive flexibility, but this makes it more of a momentum sink, forcing Pinsir to manually switch out against slower Pokemon if threatened with paralysis or heavy damage. Ergo, many teams have to use a deliberate game plan centered around strictly late-game usage for these sets to work. However, sets like Swords Dance / Hyper Beam / Body Slam / Submission provide Pinsir with alternative midground options once successfully switched in, more effectively contesting common switch-ins like Golem and Charizard.</p> <p>In terms of niche move choices, Pinsir has few that are justifiable because of its terrible movepool. Toxic is feasible for incapacitating Fire Spin users as they switch in, such as Charizard, Ninetales, and Moltres, but Body Slam is normally enough of a deterrent. However, it does come with the added bonus of piling chip damage on Rock-types when used alongside Bind. Seismic Toss is all Pinsir can muster for the very rare Gastly, but Bind can at least secure a safe pivot, and Seismic Toss is rarely helpful.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: All Fire-types in RBY NU, with the exception of Flareon, outspeed and mortally threaten Pinsir with Fire Blast and Fire Spin, namely Charizard, Ninetales, Rapidash, Arcanine, Moltres, and the rare Magmar. Even if Pinsir survives a Fire Blast from Rapidash or Magmar, it is still at risk of being burned and instantly fainting. However, if the Fire-types are paralyzed, Pinsir poses a serious threat, as a +2 Hyper Beam will KO any of them if they have taken minor damage prior.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: If Pinsir lacks Submission, it can hardly scratch Rock-types like Golem and Kabutops, immediately losing momentum and having to pivot with Bind. If it does have Submission, however, Pinsir is capable of dealing massive damage, 2HKOing them at +2.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Pinsir needs foe paralysis to outspeed the faster threats of RBY NU and therefore despises taking it itself; ergo, faster paralysis users such as tier-king Mr. MIme, Venomoth, Electrode, and the rare Abra can force Pinsir out after it gets a KO. Clefable, Wigglytuff, and Porygon are also capable of absorbing hits from an unboosted Pinsir and paralyzing it in return. Body Slam is also common on a myriad of Pokemon, most commonly Clefable, Wigglytuff, Kingler, and some Blastoise variants, which can pose further risk. While Pinsir can threaten Clefable and Wigglytuff with Submission, it will take high recoil damage in the process, with the latter costing around a third of its health at +2. While Swords Dance can reapply the paralysis Speed drop on foes to help if Pinsir has been paralyzed, this is unreliable and leaves it open to attack.</p> <p><strong>Counter Users: Pinsir is the sole fully-evolved Pokemon that has no damaging moves that can circumvent Counter. This means that Pokemon such as Charizard, Blastoise, Poliwhirl, Clefable, and Wigglytuff can all pose a mortal risk to Pinsir by existing. This also makes Hyper Beam use somewhat risky, as a Counter user can switch in, stomach the hit, and hit Pinsir with Counter next turn for the KO. Pinsir can use Bind to bring Counter users down to Hyper Beam range and KO them, but this isn't always mathematically probable. Using Swords Dance to bait out an early Counter and KO the following turn is also possible, but very risky, especially against paralysis users Clefable and Wigglytuff. Consequently, Pinsir teams must scout for Counter early into a game.</p> <p><strong>Gastly: While rare, Gastly completely walls Pinsir. To even damage it, Pinsir requires Seismic Toss, which it cannot afford, and the only other attack that has any effect is Bind, which doesn't damage it but allows Pinsir to pivot into a check safely. In turn, Gastly can use Hypnosis uncontested or 4HKO Pinsir with Thunderbolt.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Swords Dance is Pinsir's claim to fame, allowing it to rapidly chip down teams with Bind before blasting them away with Hyper Beam. Swords Dance also ensures paralysis doesn't immediately ruin Pinsir, allowing it to reapply a foe's paralysis Speed drop and keep the momentum in its favor. For example, against a paralyzed Mr. Mime—a common sight after Mr. Mime have a mirror match—Pinsir can enter and set up, remaining faster despite Thunder Wave, and OHKO Mr. Mime with Hyper Beam the next turn. Pinsir's third moveslot is flexible; Slash provides immediate power for safer revenge killing than Hyper Beam, while the weaker Body Slam makes Pinsir more self-sufficient, spreading paralysis and being boosted by Swords Dance. Body Slam also strongly deters Fire Spin users such as Ninetales and Charizard, which otherwise switch in on Pinsir easily. Finally, Submission OHKOes Porygon and 2HKOes Kabutops and Golem at +2, which Pinsir otherwise struggles to break through, although the steep drop in consistency is a pain for it to deal with.</p> <p>Pinsir functions best late-game when it's not at risk of being paralyzed during its sweep. It's also strongly recommended to paralyze Fire-types like Charizard, Ninetales, and Moltres with teammates like Mr. Mime and Clefable; otherwise, Pinsir is easily revenge killed. Kabutops checks Charizard and can KO it outright while quadruply resisting Fire Spin, and it forms a strong physical attacking core with Pinsir that has decent defensive integrity. If not running Submission, Golem and Kabutops should also be removed, with Water-types like Blastoise being great against the former, as Pinsir has issues breaking through them. Pinsir can find switch-in opportunities against Rest users like Blastoise with Rest giving free turns for Pinsir to set up. Outside of this, Pinsir is a great switch-in to Earthquake from the likes of Pokemon like Nidoking; in this case, it can Speed tie Nidoking and either deal serious damage with Slash or gain momentum with Bind. Pinsir works well with fellow wrappers such as Charizard, sometimes alongside other Fire-types like Ninetales, as Pinsir can threaten Golem with Submission while having a wrapping move itself and a Ground resistance for pivoting.</p> "

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Tauros is the most iconic Pokemon in RBY OU, and its presence has been shaping the tier for as long as it has existed. Tauros is undoubtedly the strongest offensive threat in the tier, thanks to its powerful Body Slams and Hyper Beams paired with the coverage moves to hit any Pokemon that resists its STABs. This is further enhanced by its high Speed, and therefore high critical hit rate, as well as serviceable bulk. This makes switching into Tauros a very arduous prospect for most teams, as potential checks like Starmie have to fear a sizable chance of paralysis or critical hit from Body Slam. Other Pokemon with the theoretical physical bulk, such as Snorlax, Cloyster, or Slowbro, can only shrug off Tauros's hits via Rest, leaving them in an exploitable state. Overall, although some special attackers can trade blows advantageously with Tauros, and it has to be very wary of paralysis, its sheer offensive prowess makes it an automatic inclusion on a vast majority of RBY teams.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunderbolt and Thunder can be used to damage Cloyster, which is one of the sturdiest Tauros switch-ins available. Thunder manages to 2HKO it but has to deal with much lower accuracy, while Thunderbolt misses out on that damage range but is generally far more reliable, and is therefore the preferred option a vast majority of the time.</p> <p>Given the generally low usage of Gengar and Counter Chansey, it is reasonable to cut Earthquake in favor of Fire Blast; while this move does not hit any targets for extra damage, it does carry a 30.1% burn chance that can give Tauros an upper hand in a one-on-one matchup with opposing Tauros.</p> <p>Stomp has a 30.1% flinch chance, and while definitely unreliable, it can be used to bring opposing Pokemon into KO range with no damage traded back with some luck. This is an especially appealing option if the enemy Pokemon is already paralyzed, which further increases the chances of it not managing to attack.</p> <p>Double-Edge's 100 Base Power can be used to safely snipe out KOs that Body Slam cannot reach while not having to rely on Hyper Beam; the recoil is a generally unpleasant side effect, but it can be used to your advantage, as whenever a Pokemon faints from recoil the turn ends immediately. This mechanic can occasionally be used to damage an opponent and prevent them from healing back up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Status: Tauros's below average bulk is difficult to exploit because it is usually faster and strong enough to KO the foe before they can strike back. Paralysis and sleep are both very common in the RBY metagame, and they can shut down this element of Tauros's gameplay, making it much easier to deal with.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: While Exeggutor lacks recovery, and therefore cannot repeatedly switch in on Tauros, simply having Exeggutor in the back will often dissuade Tauros players from clicking Hyper Beam, as Exeggutor could switch in, tank the Hyper Beam, and land a Sleep Powder or a Stun Spore on Tauros during the recharge turn, effectively putting it out of commission for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Starmie is the only Pokemon with access to Recover that can survive a Body Slam followed by a Hyper Beam, which makes it an obvious candidate for a reliable switch-in on Tauros throughout the game; however, Body Slam can ruin its day with decent frequency due to the chance of paralysis. Regardless, Starmie outspeeds Tauros and can even threaten it with Thunder Wave, which makes a healthy Starmie one of the best Tauros answers available.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster and Lapras</strong>: These Pokemon possess great bulk and access to a powerful Blizzard that is generally enough to scare Tauros away. Lapras's Blizzard is stronger and has a chance to 2HKO, while Cloyster takes Body Slams better and more commonly runs Rest to heal the damage back up. As a side note, Articuno also possesses 2HKO potential via Blizzard, but it's significantly frailer and generally less viable than both Cloyster and Lapras.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro: Slowbro is part of the small list of Pokemon that are guaranteed to survive a critical hit Hyper Beam from full HP, making it an appealing option to switch in on a predicted Hyper Beam in order to guarantee landing a Thunder Wave on the recharge turn. It does not mind a Body Slam either, but it can be hard for it to use Rest and wake up unpunished.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Tauros's much slower and bulkier counterpart is a good asset when trying to answer an opposing Tauros, as its natural bulk will often at least guarantee that some damage gets traded back, and if it carries Self-Destruct, it can somewhat reliably trade one-for-one if your opponent chooses to leave Tauros on the field.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Although mauled by Earthquake, Gengar can switch in on Normal-type attacks from Tauros at no cost and threaten it with Hypnosis. Although the exchange is somewhat likely to end very poorly, between Hypnosis's miss chance and Earthquake's critical chance, the Tauros user is generally expected to keep it away from danger if possible, which means Gengar can somewhat reliably be used to prevent Tauros from making any progress as long as it doesn't get hit with an Earthquake on a predicted switch in. Gengar is also the best check to Tauros without Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Alakazam</strong>: Although they definitely do not want to pick a full one-on-one against Tauros or ever switch in on it, Alakazam and Jolteon deserve a mention as they can outspeed and revenge kill a weakened Tauros, which is a fairly rare quality.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Tauros's combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam makes it an incredibly difficult threat to switch into, as a majority of Pokemon only need to receive minimal chip damage before being unable to tank a Body Slam followed by a Hyper Beam, and some are KOed by this sequence even from full health. Body Slam's paralysis chance on some of the most common Tauros switch-ins such as Starmie and Exeggutor is yet another addition to Tauros's already threatening arsenal. Blizzard is Tauros's best attack to threaten Rhydon and Golem, the two OU-viable Rock-types that would otherwise be able to switch in on its Body Slam, and force them to face the threat of being 2HKOed (or being OHKOed on a critical hit). Earthquake is the preferred move in the last slot, as it gives Tauros a tool to hit Gengar, which otherwise walls it, as well as a way to play around Counter Chansey, although Tauros still risks taking a Thunder Wave in a direct one-on-one situation. Additionally, it can finish off a weakened Rhydon or Golem with greater accuracy than Blizzard. Earthquake also gives Tauros a safe move to hit both Chansey and Rock-types, which eliminates the need to predict a switch with Body Slam or Blizzard in certain situations.</p> <p>Tauros is such a potent tool to break the opposition down that it is generally preferred to keep it as healthy as possible throughout the game while also trying to get it on the field as often as possible; this is a tricky balance to achieve that often sets apart new players from experienced ones. Great opportunities to switch it in can be found against Pokemon that are asleep, on a predicted switch, or on a recovery move that will leave the opponent's active Pokemon in KO range for Tauros. Quite frequently, Tauros will be able to clean up teams that have appropriately been crippled with status or weakened beforehand thanks to its extremely strong Hyper Beam; this is one of the most common win conditions in RBY, and as such, your game plan should generally account for the possibility of an end-game Tauros sweep. This means you should capitalize on opportunities to set up a Tauros sweep while trying to reduce your opponent's chances to do the same thing. The biggest obstacle in these plans is often the fact that both Tauros are kept as healthy as possible and always able to try a last-resort mirror, even when the rest of the team has fallen apart; this is one of the many reasons for keeping your own Tauros safe.</p> "

However, Tauros has to avoid status at all costs to remain a threat. The reduced viability of Hyper Beam compared to standard RBY does it no favors either, as it now has more difficulty breaking through staples like Snorlax, Exeggutor, and Chansey, as well as knocking out status inducers before they can cripple it.

          "description": "<p>Body Slam is Tauros's main attacking option; its paralysis chance on most Pokemon makes switching into it difficult. Blizzard 2HKOes Rhydon and Golem and has a 32.1% chance to 3HKO Exeggutor. It also carries a small freeze chance, which gives Tauros the option to fish for an effective KO in a desperate situation. Substitute protects Tauros from status and critical hits and is a useful tool for sweeping. Double-Edge can be used instead; it is guaranteed to 2HKO Alakazam, and its greater power than Body Slam gives Tauros more room to finish off foes before they can threaten it. It comes at the cost of recoil damage, although this can be avoided if Tauros scores a KO or destroys a Substitute. There are a few moves that can fit in the last moveslot. Stomp's flinch chance allows Tauros to put threats in range of its other moves without taking damage. It is especially effective against paralyzed foes, as they will only have a 52.5% chance to move, and it is also safer if Tauros is behind a Substitute, as it won't risk paralysis or damage. Earthquake usually KOes Jolteon after a Body Slam and 2HKOes the rare Gengar, which walls Tauros otherwise. Furthermore, it hits Rhydon and the uncommon Golem and Kabutops for super effective damage while dealing decent damage to Chansey, should it switch in predicting Blizzard. Tauros can use it to avoid Counter from Chansey, though Counter sees little use. Alternatively, Thunderbolt 3HKOes Starmie, Slowbro, and the uncommon Cloyster and Kabutops. Cloyster is notably able to wall Tauros if it lacks Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Tauros wants to avoid damage and status whenever it can to best use its offensive abilities and avoid being disadvantaged in a potential mirror matchup. Thus, using Tauros means having it active whenever possible while keeping it as healthy as possible. A good way to get mileage out of it while keeping it safe is to switch it in on sleeping or frozen Pokemon, a predicted Rest, or a predicted switch. Another, slightly riskier option is to switch into a predicted Recover or Soft-Boiled from a paralyzed Pokemon; if they get paralyzed when trying to recover, Tauros can finish them off. Substitute should generally be saved for the late-game, as using it once puts Tauros in 2HKO range of common threats like Rhydon, Exeggutor, Jolteon, Zapdos, Alakazam, and Starmie. Besides the listed options, very few other moves are worth considering on Tauros. Hyper Beam is still incredibly powerful and will allow it to reliably break through Chansey and Exeggutor, but it's much less appealing because it always forces a recharge turn, even if it misses. However, it can work if Tauros is behind a Substitute to protect it from paralysis on the following turn. Fire Blast has a high burn chance, which can be useful against enemy Tauros and Snorlax, but it's a weaker choice in Stadium, as the latter can wipe off the Attack loss with Rest.</p> "

  "Gyarados": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Gyarados is among the strongest tanks and wallbreakers in RBY UU. Thanks to an impressive base stat total and deep movepool, Gyarados can comfortably stomach powerful attacks and threaten just about the entire tier with a super effective special move or strong physical move. It is equipped to handle many premier defensive and support Pokemon; Blizzard 2HKOes Venusaur and Tangela and can potentially OHKO Dragonite, Thunderbolt puts pressure on Water-type Pokemon like Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar, and the combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam is more than enough to break through Kadabra and Hypno. Gyarados is no slouch against offensive Pokemon as well, boasting a Hydro Pump that can OHKO Dugtrio and 2HKO Kangaskhan and Persian. It is thus a highly customizable Pokemon that can fit on a wide variety of teams.</p> <p>Gyarados is also one of the strongest checks to Dugtrio in the tier. With an immunity to Earthquake and several moves that can OHKO or 2HKO it, Gyarados can switch in against Dugtrio and quickly force it out, sometimes several times in the same game. A healthy Gyarados can confidently prevent a Dugtrio sweep and heavily punish switch-ins with strong moves like Body Slam. Gyarados is also the only Dugtrio check that isn’t weak to Ice, meaning it doesn’t exacerbate a team's weakness to Pokemon like Articuno and Tentacruel nearly as much as other options like Dragonite, Aerodactyl, and Tangela. Versus its closest competitor, Dragonite, Gyarados has an additional point of Speed and STAB Water-type moves. Gyarados can thus reliably revenge kill Dragonite and Venusaur and deal more damage to Pokemon such as Kangaskhan and Haunter.</p> <p>While Gyarados may be able to shake off Blizzard, Thunderbolt absolutely terrifies it. Electabuzz and Raichu are very likely to OHKO Gyarados with the move and Persian, even with its underwhelming Special stat, scores a clean 2HKO. Gyarados’s weakness to Rock can be similarly exploited; while Gyarados is a strong answer to Dugtrio, Rock Slide can deal some hefty damage, especially with a critical hit. Finally, while Gyarados is rather bulky, it lacks any form of reliable recovery, and it isn’t particularly quick. This means that it can be worn down over the course of a match when used too liberally.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Gyarados will most often run Body Slam and Blizzard, it can potentially drop one to run all of Hyper Beam, Thunderbolt, and Hydro Pump. Body Slam is tough to drop because it is a very consistent midground option, but the additional coverage may be desirable if, for example, Gyarados is being used as more of a revenge killer than a defensive piece. Dropping Blizzard leaves Gyarados unequipped to handle Dragonite, as well as Grass-type Pokemon like Venusaur and Tangela.</p> <p>Fire Blast is Gyarados’s strongest move against Articuno, scoring a guaranteed 3HKO. It lacks the same coverage as Blizzard, failing to handle Dragonite and Dugtrio, but it reliably handles Grass-type Pokemon and the occasional Bug-type Pokemon like Pinsir or Venomoth. The move also carries a dangerous burn chance, which can severely cripple wrappers like Tentacruel and Dragonite and physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Dodrio. Thunder is another potential special attack, notably scoring an OHKO on opposing Gyarados, possible 2HKO on Omastar and Dewgong, and a guaranteed 3HKO on Vaporeon and Articuno. However, its poor accuracy keeps it from being commonplace.</p> <p>Because of its bulk and array of strong matchups, Gyarados can run Rest to improve its longevity. The move can make Gyarados a more persistent check to Pokemon like Dugtrio, Dragonite, and bulky Water-type Pokemon. Gyarados can potentially burn sleep turns in front of these Pokemon or during Tentacruel’s Wrap. Rest remains a fairly niche option, however, as many Pokemon can switch in and OHKO or 2HKO Gyarados and it costs Gyarados a valuable coverage move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Moves: Electabuzz, Raichu, and the rare Electrode all outspeed Gyarados and have a chance to OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Unless they are paralyzed, these Pokemon will virtually always KO Gyarados or force it to switch. Haunter is another dangerous Pokemon as, in addition to outspeeding and 2HKOing Gyarados with Thunderbolt, it can come in for free on Body Slam and Hyper Beam. Haunter’s high Special also guarantees that it will survive two Hydro Pumps. Persian also outspeeds and 2HKOes Gyarados, but it is more afraid of its special moves. Clefable is also guaranteed to 2HKO Gyarados and Raticate has good odds to do so as well. Persian, Clefable, and Raticate also have the benefit of being immune to Body Slam paralysis, meaning they can switch in more confidently than most Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Articuno: Gyarados's Thunderbolt has a 47.1% chance to 3HKO Articuno, and Fire Blast and Thunder guarantee the 3HKO. Articuno, on the other hand, outspeeds Gyarados and 3HKOes with Blizzard. Outside of a Body Slam paralysis or critical hit, Gyarados generally cannot pressure Articuno, meaning Articuno is often free to take it out or set up with Agility and sweep. Without a super effective move, Gyarados struggles to even 3HKO.</p> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Kangaskhan outpaces Gyarados and can potentially 3HKO it with either two Body Slams and a Hyper Beam or three Rock Slides. This means Kangaskhan will reliably defeat Gyarados unless it is carrying Hydro Pump; even with Hydro Pump, the matchup is inconsistent due to its mediocre accuracy and the risk of paralysis from Body Slam. Kangaskhan can even potentially switch in against Gyarados, as it can't be paralyzed by Body Slam and has a chance to survive two Blizzards afterward.</p> <p><strong>Rock Slide</strong>: While Gyarados switches into Dugtrio's Earthquake without fear, it must be cautious of Rock Slide. Repeated chip damage from Rock Slide makes Gyarados much less effective as a tank. Moreover, if Dugtrio lands a critical hit, Rock Slide will cost Gyarados over half of its health. Likewise, Golem has little business staying in against Gyarados, but if it predicts the switch or is behind a Substitute, it can hit with Rock Slide and take away over half of Gyarados’s health.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions: While Gyarados handles status effects better than other Dugtrio checks like Dragonite and Tangela, it still prefers to avoid them. Being poisoned greatly reduces Gyarados's ability to repeatedly switch in and makes it easier to KO; for example, Dugtrio can 3HKO a poisoned Gyarados with Rock Slide. Moreover, Gyarados becomes incapable of stalling partial-trapping moves like Tentacruel's Wrap and Pinsir's Bind. While Fire Blast is not otherwise threatening to Gyarados, being burned similarly reduces its defensive utility and ability to hit and run. Moreover, it cripples Gyarados's offensive presence; a burned Gyarados can't even 2HKO Kadabra. Lastly, paralysis shortens the list of Pokemon that Gyarados can reliably threaten. Pokemon that Gyarados often preys on, like Hypno, Vaporeon, Omastar, and paralyzed Kadabra, handle Gyarados much better when it is paralyzed. Additionally, most of Gyarados's moves have imperfect accuracy, meaning it may have trouble dealing damage when paralyzed. Hydro Pump, for example, has a dismal 59.8% chance to hit if Gyarados is paralyzed. Dugtrio in particular exploits this accuracy problem, as it often carries Substitute and can thus fish for misses or full paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Tentacruel is the strongest Water-type check, as it can outspeed and immobilize Gyarados with Wrap; considering Gyarados doesn’t handle chip damage very well, this will usually force it to switch. Without Thunderbolt, Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Omastar, and Dewgong can be tricky, as they can repeatedly use Rest and gradually chip down Gyarados with Body Slam or Blizzard. Opposing Gyarados also become an issue, as Thunderbolt is a clean 2HKO. With Thunderbolt, these matchups are decidedly favorable, but they may result in Gyarados losing some health or being paralyzed, which may inhibit its ability to check Dugtrio.</p> ",

          "name": "All-out Attacker",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Body Slam is Gyarados’s primary attack and a great way to spread paralysis; many Pokemon that look to switch into Gyarados, like Electabuzz and Tentacruel, loathe getting paralyzed. This makes it a great option when it comes face to face with Dugtrio and other Pokemon that are likely to switch out. The move is also just generally quite strong thanks to Gyarados’s base 125 Attack stat, which ties Pinsir for the third-highest in the tier. Blizzard is a great deterrent when facing Dragonite that also helps against Pokemon like Venusaur, Tangela, Dodrio, and Aerodactyl. If Gyarados isn’t running Hydro Pump, Blizzard is its best option against Pokemon with poor Special like Dugtrio and Kangaskhan. Hyper Beam is extremely strong and can eliminate many prominent threats pretty early. Tentacruel and Hypno drop to the move when they are just below 50% health and Kadabra can even be OHKOed by it, though it is unlikely. The move is thus a very strong tool for revenge killing, especially against paralyzed targets. Hyper Beam is also great for taking out common switch-ins when they are at low health or as a last-ditch hit. Thunderbolt is a powerful tool against the many bulky Water-type Pokemon in UU, 3HKOing Omastar and Dewgong while 4HKOing Vaporeon. While these Pokemon somewhat threaten Gyarados, especially via Body Slam paralysis, Gyarados can reliably break through them if needed. This is a key advantage Gyarados holds over every other notable Dugtrio check. Funnily enough, Thunderbolt also prevents Gyarados from being walled by opposing Gyarados. Lastly, Hydro Pump is Gyarados’s strongest move, narrowly beating out Hyper Beam. Hydro Pump makes quick work of most weak and neutral targets, notably OHKOing Dugtrio, Golem, and Aerodactyl, 2HKOing Persian and Kangaskhan, and 3HKOing Kadabra, Haunter, and sometimes Hypno. It is also a decent option against Articuno and Omastar if Gyarados isn’t packing Thunderbolt. Selecting Gyarados’s last two moves often comes down to team composition.</p> <p>Using Gyarados successfully often comes down to getting it in safely, letting it deal as much damage as possible, without worrying too much about its middling speed and lack of recovery. Keeping Gyarados healthy is essential for consistently checking Dugtrio; after taking a mere 16%, Rock Slide will always 3HKO, meaning Gyarados may lose to Dugtrio on the switch if it can't OHKO it. Encouraging Pokemon like Dugtrio, Golem, and Kangaskhan to use Earthquake is a very good way to get Gyarados in, as it will take no damage and force out the first two Pokemon rather consistently. Gyarados can pressure Kangaskhan, especially if it has Hydro Pump, but Kangaskhan may choose to stay in as it can win the matchup with two Body Slams and a Hyper Beam or three Rock Slides. Once Gyarados is revealed, it becomes a very strong deterrent to using Earthquake; for example, Dugtrio is very likely to use Slash or Rock Slide instead, which makes it much easier to manage.</p> <p>Gyarados is typically reserved for checking Dugtrio before anything else. However, if Dugtrio dealt with or absent from the opponent’s team, Gyarados becomes a lot more flexible. It is quite good at breaking through many common defensive Pokemon and shrugging off their hits; it effortlessly comes in against Surf, which helps it bully Water-type Pokemon like Vaporeon and Omastar late-game. It can also withstand a few Wrap hits from Tentacruel and wait for a miss if it must. Gyarados can prevent every Water-type Pokemon from repeatedly using Rest without really fearing any of their moves. It also comes in quite comfortably against offensively weaker Pokemon like Tangela and Aerodactyl, especially if it can come in on Mega Drain and Fire Blast, respectively. Gyarados also works well as a revenge killer thanks to the power of Hyper Beam and Hydro Pump. It can reasonably KO most slower Pokemon after some damage, but Hypno and paralyzed Kadabra are two particularly common targets, as Gyarados can switch in when they use their recovery moves.</p> <p>Gyarados partners best with Pokemon that appreciate a reliable switch-in for Dugtrio, like Tentacruel, Haunter, Electabuzz, and Raichu. They are also all quite good at baiting Dugtrio to use Earthquake, which helps Gyarados get in safely and repeatedly. Electabuzz and Raichu are also good switch-ins against opposing Electric-type Pokemon, with which Gyarados struggles. Persian is another good partner, as Gyarados matches up fairly well against most of its checks and answers: Dugtrio, Omastar, Golem, and Aerodactyl. Aside from Dugtrio, these Pokemon are quite likely to switch into Persian, giving Gyarados an opportunity to come in on a double switch. Articuno, Dragonite, and Dodrio appreciate Gyarados as is a solid answer for the bulky Water-type Pokemon that wall them. These Pokemon also help Gyarados check Dugtrio, allowing it to play more flexibly. Grass-type Pokemon like Venusaur and Tangela switch in comfortably against the Thunderbolts that often target Gyarados, and they too take some pressure off of Gyarados as a dedicated Dugtrio check. Fast sweepers like Dugtrio and Aerodactyl are really good at cleaning up teams after Gyarados has mounted a lot of chip damage by pivoting in against opposing Dugtrio and other Pokemon it threatens. Dugtrio also does a good job at punishing Electric-type Pokemon, Haunter, and Persian, which can threaten Gyarados.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Gyarados clings to RBY OU relevance thanks to a combination of massively inflated stats, expansive coverage in moves like Thunderbolt and Blizzard, and a unique typing that makes it the only Water-type immune to Ground, letting it switch in on a predicted Earthquake with impunity. That typing lets it synergize with Pokemon like Chansey, Gengar, and Jolteon, which not only appreciate this immunity, but also help patch up its own Thunderbolt weakness. Gyarados's attacking stats are extremely high, allowing it to achieve feats such as 2HKOing Tauros and 3HKOing Snorlax with Hydro Pump, letting it win against them one-on-one. Plus, it's bulky to the point that even a Thunderbolt from Starmie fails to OHKO it without a critical hit. It's not exactly slow relative to RBY OU either, outrunning Pokemon like Cloyster, Dragonite, and Victreebel while threatening them with its coverage. Overall, Gyarados can be seen as a battering ram that blows past paralyzed teams.</p> <p>However, while it may have been a big threat in the early days of the generation, Gyarados fell out of favor due to its typing giving it some horrendous weaknesses. While its Ground immunity looks enticing to switch in on Rhydon, it also takes huge damage from Rock Slide: its bulk isn't as good as it looks. It also gets a quadruple weakness to Thunderbolt and neutrality to Blizzard and Psychic, making it hard for Gyarados to get in against the special attackers of the tier and forcing teams to make up for it. If paralyzed, this gets even worse, as Gyarados's lack of reliable recovery makes it very easy to wear down as is. Even offensively, because of a criminal lack of physical STAB moves, Gyarados struggles to damage specially bulky Pokemon like Chansey and Gengar. Finally, Gyarados has issues distinguishing itself from Lapras outside of its typing and superior Attack, which has the same coverage and higher overall bulk. As a result of these flaws, Gyarados is a very rare sight in RBY OU, often requiring extensive support from a dedicated team to function properly, but it remains a serviceable pick in the hands of an experienced player.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Surf can be used if Hydro Pump's consistency is problematic, but this reduces Gyarados's immediate threat level. Worse still, it's not that much better than Blizzard in practice damage-wise, making it largely redundant. Thunder is a serviceable option to 2HKO Starmie and Slowbro, but its criminally low accuracy and lack of benefit outside of this make it mostly suboptimal.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Gengar: Gengar can switch in on Gyarados and KO it with Thunderbolt if it's taken even a modicum of damage. However, it can't repeatedly switch into Hydro Pump, lest it get 3HKOed in the process.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can effortlessly take Gyarados's special coverage; Reflect sets are also depressing to fight against. Additionally, Chansey's access to Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave makes it very risky for Gyarados to contest unless its moveset has already been successfully scouted. However, Gyarados can KO Chansey with Hyper Beam from 49.3% onwards if Reflect isn't active—even above 75% with Body Slam + Hyper Beam—which makes a paralyzed Chansey very possible to beat.</p> <p><strong>Starmie and Lapras</strong>: While it gets Thunderbolt, Gyarados struggles to deal with Starmie and Lapras due to their Hydro Pump resistance and ability to simply outdamage Gyarados with their own coverage. Starmie is of particular note because of its access to Thunder Wave, which firmly shuts down Gyarados. However, it has to risk Body Slam paralysis when switching in, which can potentially incapacitate it for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type coverage</strong>: Any Pokemon with Thunderbolt is automatically a Gyarados check. Jolteon and Zapdos cleanly OHKO Gyarados with their STAB Thunderbolts. If Tauros and Persian run Thunderbolt, they can 2HKO Gyarados off the bat, the latter of which is arguably more threatening because of its high critical hit rate. However, all of these Pokemon would rather avoid taking direct damage, as they have mediocre bulk; they win one-on-one, but they are not reliable defensive answers by any means.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor: If not running Blizzard, Exeggutor resists both of Gyarados's special coverage options and threatens with massive damage or sleep in return. Even with Blizzard in the equation, a Special drop from Psychic can instantly ruin any chance of Gyarados actually winning. However, Exeggutor doesn't want to take a Blizzard, as it often wants to save its bulk for more pressing matchups, particularly Rhydon and Snorlax.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Gyarados's Hydro Pump is no joke, letting it potentially 3HKO Snorlax and 2HKO Tauros, winning against them one-on-one. However, it should be remembered that Hydro Pump's inconsistency can and will lead to wasted turns. Additionally, Thunderbolt Tauros can tear Gyarados apart anyway, so it must be scouted for first. Thunderbolt gives Gyarados a fighting chance against all Water-types, most importantly Starmie, Cloyster, Slowbro, and Lapras. However, Blizzard can be used to 3HKO Exeggutor instead, which Gyarados otherwise struggles against. Body Slam allows Gyarados to scout for switch-ins while threatening with paralysis, making use of its great Attack stat in the process; this also prevents Starmie, Alakazam, and Jolteon from switching in safely, and it allows Gyarados to pressure Chansey with significant damage on a critical hit. To top it off, Hyper Beam blows past non-Reflect Chansey and Alakazam, KOing them from 58% and 63.5% onwards, respectively, which Body Slam can set it up for.</p> <p>Gyarados functions as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker that forces the opponent into making predictable decisions. It can be brought in early on a predicted Rest from Snorlax—a common sight in the early-game in RBY—then threaten it with Hydro Pump from there to force damage onto the opposing team. Gyarados's high Special and Water resistance make it one of the best Clamp absorbers in the game too, so it's very capable of switching in on a predicted one from Cloyster. Outside of this though, due to its typing, Gyarados's switch-in opportunities are quite limited, mostly being reserved to generic methods like pivoting with partial trapping, gambling on full paralysis, and Explosion. However, Gyarados's typing makes it well-equipped for double switching against Earthquake, allowing it to ease in Pokemon like Jolteon and Chansey if the situation calls for it.</p> "

While it faces strong competition from other Pokemon with similar coverage, such as Starmie, its combination of power and bulk, as well as access to Sing, gives Lapras a unique set of qualities that give it an important niche in the metagame. Access to STAB Blizzard, as well as Thunderbolt, enables it to hit almost every Pokemon in the game for at least neutral damage, making it quite difficult to switch into. Its Speed is just enough to get by Chansey as well, allowing it to potentially put it to sleep one-on-one.

Lapras's typing leaves it with a weakness to Thunderbolt and neutrality to Psychic, which often makes it easy to wear down with Pokemon like Starmie and Alakazam running around. It also struggles mightily against Chansey if it can't put it to sleep, which stonewalls it with its incredible bulk. Regardless, Lapras holds a niche in RBY OU, and it sees success on quite a few teams.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ice Beam is an alternative STAB option to use in place of Blizzard, but the lack of power is really noticeable and generally not worth the extra accuracy and PP. Rest and Reflect can be used in conjunction to give Lapras much appreciated survivability to answer threats such as Tauros more reliably throughout the game, but the set is easy to pressure via powerful special attacks, particularly Psychic- or Electric-type ones, and the lack of offensive pressure makes it a risky and generally undesirable pick.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Lapras struggles immensely in attempting to break through Chansey. It can easily Soft-Boiled away any damage taken and force Lapras out with the threat of Thunder Wave. Lapras may attempt to put it to sleep with Sing, but the move is inaccurate, somewhat predictable, and completely useless against a paralyzed Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos and Jolteon</strong>: While Lapras's Blizzard respectively 2HKOes and 3HKOes these Pokemon, team structures that include Lapras generally leave themselves very vulnerable to Electric-type attacks, which Zapdos and Jolteon can easily exploit and punish with powerful Thunderbolts. It may even be preferable to sacrifice Lapras in a one-on-one scenario just to get some chip damage on Zapdos in particular, but the same cannot be said for Jolteon, which should nearly always have the upper hand against Lapras and only fears a potential Body Slam paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Starmie and Alakazam</strong>: If they are not paralyzed, these two Pokemon can tank any hit Lapras throws at them and Recover off the damage easily while threatening it with Thunder Wave. All Lapras needs to turn the tides on them is paralysis and some correct predictions.</p> <p><strong>Amnesia Snorlax</strong>: Although it takes a while to get going and has to worry about Sing, Snorlax doesn't take much damage from any of Lapras's attacks after one or two Amnesia boosts and can retaliate with Body Slam. Although it is unlikely Amnesia Snorlax would be used as a switch-in, it dominates one-on-one.</p> ",

Thunderbolt allows Lapras to hit Water-types, giving it the ability to muscle through paralyzed Starmie, which would otherwise be a poor matchup. In the third slot, Hyper Beam is Lapras's best bet to finish off Pokemon with a high Special but low Defense, such as Chansey and Alakazam, which are otherwise good answers to Lapras; however, Body Slam may be preferred, as it gives Lapras the ability to somewhat reliably paralyze opposing Starmie. The last slot is usually Sing, a move that provides great utility and scares off Pokemon that would otherwise function as great Lapras answers, with Chansey usually being the main target. Its low accuracy can be unfortunate, as Lapras doesn't have easy ways to shrug off any status or damage that may come its way, so misses can be particularly devastating. If the sleep move is not necessary, you may opt to run Confuse Ray instead, which is Lapras's best shot at powering through paralyzed special walls.</p> <p>When using Lapras, you should first figure out a plan to take care of Chansey, as it can shrug off Blizzard quite easily. Snorlax's Self-Destruct and Exeggutor's Explosion are usually the best ways to achieve this, as your opponent should be able to preserve their Chansey quite easily by simply switching out if you try to defeat it via repeated Ice Beams, PP stalling, or strong physical attacks. However, it is still possible for Lapras to pressure Chansey via Sing, so if you cannot find an opportunity to threaten it via Explosion, you can still rely on Sing to get the job done. Non-paralyzed Starmie and Alakazam are both answers to Lapras as well, threatening to shut it down with Thunder Wave, as they are simply able to use Recover until Lapras is fully paralyzed. If running Body Slam, you should attempt to predict their entrance and hit them with it; should you manage to paralyze them, Lapras will outspeed them and be much harder to stop. Lapras has great potential to create significant advantages between access to Sing and strong matchups against very popular Pokemon such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon, but its checks must be taken care of before it can have any impact on the game.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>NOTE - The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. Vaporeon is generally considered unviable in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <h1>Overview</h1> <p>Vaporeon stands out as the best among the many bulky Water-types in RBY UU, providing teams with a backbone against offensive behemoths like Tentacruel and Articuno. It often takes multiple Pokemon to KO Vaporeon, and because of its monstrous Special stat, they will also have to take very strong STAB Surfs in the process. Even many super effective attacks, such as Electabuzz's Thunderbolt, will fail to 2HKO it. Vaporeon is capable of dueling and checking mighty physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Dugtrio as well. Vaporeon isn't too concerned about paralysis either, making it one of the best absorbers of the status in the tier. Checking Normal-types, Articuno, Dugtrio, and even Tentacruel all in one, Vaporeon blends offense and defense perfectly, making it a very appreciated addition to many successful RBY UU teams.</p> <p>Still, though, Vaporeon is very slow, which can leave it vulnerable to Wrap from Dragonite or Tentacruel. Worse still, if Vaporeon is low on HP, this Wrap use will deny it from healing off damage with Rest. Vaporeon's reliance on Rest will also let heavy-hitting Pokemon like Persian, Kangaskhan, and Dugtrio safely switch in on the turn Rest is used, putting Vaporeon in a very precarious position. Being outrun by every sleeper in the tier, bar Tangela, can also make Vaporeon easy to put to sleep again after Rest if Sleep Clause isn't active. Finally, Vaporeon lacks coverage for opposing Water-types, though its higher damage output does tend to let it win prolonged interactions.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is an immensely strong option that allows Vaporeon to 2HKO almost any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, with some standout calculations being 2HKOs on Electabuzz, Persian, and Kangaskhan. However, its accuracy and PP leave much to be desired, making what should be the team's anchor very inconsistent. This also makes it easier for opposing Rest users to PP stall Vaporeon. Acid Armor lets Vaporeon wall physical attackers like Dodrio and Kangaskhan as well as take much less chip damage from Wrap, which can define late-game scenarios when its checks are removed. However, since it doesn't help against Persian or special attackers, which are just as common, it's difficult to justify.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Gyarados: Gyarados resists Surf and takes 27.7% maximum from Blizzard, all while possessing coverage in Thunderbolt to 4HKO Vaporeon, which can be turned into a 3HKO with Hyper Beam. Vaporeon simply can't risk contending with a healthy Gyarados and will be forced out by it frequently. Furthermore, the best counterplay to Vaporeon is to switch in on a predicted Rest to give it what for, and Gyarados is among the best punishes to a resting Vaporeon in the tier thanks to its offensive prowess.</p> <p><strong>Venusaur</strong>: Venusaur outspeeds Vaporeon and threatens it with either an uncontested Sleep Powder or a 2HKO from Razor Leaf. Venusaur is a particularly heavy punish to a resting Vaporeon as a result. The punish especially hurts if it's running Swords Dance, allowing it to set up and still get the 2HKO before Vaporeon can act. However, Venusaur really doesn't want to switch into Blizzard, which deals up to 60%, adding a degree of risk to the prediction game.</p> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Haunter is capable of switching in on Vaporeon's Body Slam and can 3HKO with Thunderbolt about half the time. Additionally, if necessary, Explosion KOes Vaporeon from half HP. Since it's faster, Haunter can also threaten Vaporeon with Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Normal-type Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers, like the tier's resident Normal-types, are great at switching in on and punishing Vaporeon's Rest. Persian is the most reliable method of dispatching Vaporeon, 3HKOing it with Slash. While less consistent overall, Dodrio and Kangaskhan can KO Vaporeon after two Body Slams followed by Hyper Beam. However, none of these Pokemon want to contest Vaporeon's nuclear attacks, especially if it runs Hydro Pump, which 2HKOes all of them. Even without Hydro Pump, Surf and Blizzard alike have odds to 2HKO them as well.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electabuzz, Raichu, and the rare Electrode can switch in on Rest and 3HKO Vaporeon with STAB Thunderbolt. Plus, thanks to their high Speed stats, a critical hit from any of them is reasonably likely and can be difficult for Vaporeon to recover from later. In a tight spot, Electrode also guarantees a 2HKO using Thunderbolt + Explosion. However, they all take significant damage from Surf, which they can't afford in the long run. In fact, if they switch in on Surf, they're liable to lose the one-on-one, making them deceptively shaky checks.</p> <p><strong>Swords Dance Tentacruel: If using a Swords Dance set, Tentacruel can swiftly chip Vaporeon down through Wrap damage and KO it from half HP with a +2 Hyper Beam. However, Tentacruel can't afford to switch into Body Slam, lest it gets forced into Rest much earlier than usual, and the Swords Dance set rarely runs Rest anyway. If Tentacruel doesn't have Swords Dance, however, Vaporeon can absolutely fish for a Wrap miss to either try for Body Slam paralysis or use Rest to PP stall. Ergo, standard Tentacruel sets should not be considered reliable Vaporeon checks.</p> <p><strong>Dewgong</strong>: If using Ice Beam, Dewgong can engage in a freeze war with Vaporeon which, given it exhausts all its PP, has an 81.98% chance of succeeding. Since its Ice typing makes it immune to being frozen itself, and its Water typing lets it resist Vaporeon's STAB moves, Dewgong is a serviceable answer to Vaporeon. However, Dewgong is less bulky than Vaporeon, making it more difficult to wake up from Rest in the long run. This also causes it to fail to outdamage Vaporeon in prolonged interactions.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>The combination of Surf and Blizzard is resisted only by Water-types and allows Vaporeon to deal significant damage to teams thanks to its incredible Special. STAB Surf is very powerful, 3HKOing Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Kadabra, and Persian. Crucially, it also lets Vaporeon consistently OHKO Dugtrio, making it a very important check. Blizzard 2HKOes Venusaur and Dodrio, as well as possibly OHKOing Dragonite. Body Slam enables Vaporeon to hit Water-types and thus the entire tier for neutral damage and scout for switch-ins, critically Tentacruel, which can flip the situation on its head if they get paralyzed. Tentacruel becomes much more manageable if it gets paralyzed, because it has to use Rest much earlier, so Body Slam denies it free entry. Rest gives Vaporeon significant longevity while removing the paralysis it will likely absorb early-game. Vaporeon's combined great offensive pressure and bulk warps the opponent's offensive play as well; this should be exploited to force out their key offensive Pokemon while getting free turns to scout with Body Slam.</p> <p>Vaporeon fits on a variety of teams. Pairing Vaporeon with almost any Flying-type Pokemon, like Dodrio or Aerodactyl, is a good choice thanks to its Ice resistance allowing it to check Articuno for them. Dragonite works particularly well, providing Vaporeon with an Electric neutrality and Grass resistance to fall back on. The two also offer each other essential paralysis support, as Vaporeon can use Body Slam against targets such as Tentacruel and Kadabra, while Dragonite can use Thunder Wave against offensive Normal-type Pokemon. Moreover, Vaporeon paired with any Flying-type Pokemon is a particularly good way to keep Dugtrio wavering between Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Slash. Oftentimes, Dugtrio is forced to use Slash, which is far easier to play around, at least compared to its nuclear Earthquake. Other Ice-weak Pokemon, such as Venusaur and Dugtrio, also appreciate Vaporeon's presence for similar reasons. Vaporeon makes a particularly potent defensive core alongside the ubiquitous Hypno as well; Vaporeon handles Dugtrio and Normal-types, while Hypno handles Electric-types and Venusaur.</p> <p>Teams that struggle against Wrap, particularly those with frailer Pokemon like Kadabra, will also benefit greatly from Vaporeon's presence, since it can take a massive amount of chip damage before it's in KO range for anything. Vaporeon can also be used alongside other bulky Water-types, such as Tentacruel, Gyarados, and Omastar, to make teams even more resilient to Wrap and offensive pressure. During Rest, remember that being trapped by Wrap still depletes sleep turns, which makes Vaporeon deceptively easy to wake up and therefore very effective for these types of teams. Vaporeon's HP must be carefully managed when against Wrap users, however.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Jolteon's high Speed and Special stats and critical hit rate make its Thunderbolt a big threat. Because of this, Jolteon is able to outpace the whole metagame and is one of the few Pokemon that can revenge kill a weakened Tauros. It is also a good lead because of its ability to force a lead Starmie to switch out with Thunderbolt and paralyze other leads like Alakazam, Exeggutor, and Jynx with Thunder Wave. Jolteon also has an important defensive niche that allows it to be one of the few Pokemon to take on Zapdos comfortably due to resisting both of its STAB options as well as put pressure on Water-types like Slowbro and Cloyster with Thunderbolt. While Pokemon like Chansey, Exeggutor, and Alakazam can take Jolteon's Thunderbolt, it can cripple these Pokemon with Thunder Wave. However, outside of its STAB move, Jolteon does not have any other good attacking moves, as it only has two good options in Pin Missile and Double Kick, which fail to do major damage outside of a potential critical hit even on super effective targets like Exeggutor and Chansey due to Jolteon's low Attack stat. Furthermore, Jolteon is unable to deal with Ground-types like Rhydon and Golem, as it cannot do any good damage to them with any of its attacks and gets OHKOed by Earthquake.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Jolteon can run Agility to get its Speed back if it gets paralyzed; however, it will have to give up Rest or Pin Missile in order to run it, which makes it lose the ability to hit Exeggutor more effectively or get HP back on passive Pokemon. Thunder is a more powerful move that allows Jolteon to OHKO Cloyster and Tauros on a critical hit; however, the miss chance and lower PP make it hard to justify using it over Thunderbolt or over Rest or Pin Missile. Body Slam can be run over Rest or Pin Missile to try to paralyze Rhydon and Golem as they switch in; however, it is redundant otherwise, as Thunder Wave is able to paralyze Pokemon like Alakazam and Exeggutor as is.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rhydon and Golem: Both Rhydon and Golem wall Jolteon, as they're immune to Thunderbolt and Double Kick fails to do any major damage to them, while they OHKO it back with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Though it needs to be wary of potential critical Thunderbolts, Snorlax is relatively happy to switch into Thunder Wave, can tank a Thunderbolt, and threatens Jolteon immensely with any of Body Slam, Earthquake, or Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor and Victreebel</strong>: Without Pin Missile, Jolteon cannot take care of Grass-types, as Thunderbolt fails to do a lot of damage to them.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Without Rest, Jolteon cannot get rid of paralysis, which hinders it from sweeping late-game and makes it easy for any offensive Pokemon to take care of it by exposing its frailty. Jolteon wins a full one-on-one against Thunder Wave users such as Chansey, Starmie, and Zapdos, but they can simply paralyze it and switch out; Alakazam can even attempt to beat Jolteon by itself.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Thunder Wave allows Jolteon to cripple its defensive checks such as Alakazam, Chansey, and Exeggutor that commonly come in on its Thunderbolt. It is also good to use against Tauros, as it is no longer a threat once it's paralyzed. Thunderbolt takes care of Water-types like Starmie and Slowbro and can do a lot of damage to Pokemon that don't resist it if Jolteon lands a critical hit. Double Kick scares out Chansey because it is 2HKOed on a critical hit. Double Kick also allows Jolteon to have a way to get damage on Ground-types like Rhydon and Golem as a last resort, though Jolteon should switch out if it predicts them to switch in to help keep damage off of itself and its teammates. Rest allows Jolteon to get HP back and cure itself of paralysis, which is useful against Pokemon like Chansey, Starmie, and Zapdos; however, outside of these Pokemon, Jolteon will find it hard to use Rest, as the move is more useful late-game, and putting Jolteon to sleep allows Tauros to come in safety. Pin Missile gives Jolteon a way to deal with Grass-types such as Exeggutor, as it will deal major damage if it lands a critical hit on them. If Jolteon is being used as a lead, the best move to start the game is Thunder Wave in order to slow down opposing leads like Jynx, Exeggutor, and Alakazam; however, Jolteon must be careful, as this can lead to it being put to sleep with Lovely Kiss or Sleep Powder or paralyzed from Thunder Wave or Stun Spore. Because of its poor bulk, the best way to have Jolteon come in safely is against Pokemon like Chansey, on a predicted switch, or when a Pokemon faints. Jolteon should be saved to use late-game because of its Speed, as it can pick off most weakened Pokemon with Thunderbolt. Jolteon will need Pokemon like Exeggutor and Starmie on the team because it struggles against common Ground-types like Rhydon and Golem. Pokemon that can also help with Snorlax and Tauros like Cloyster and Exeggutor are needed.</p> "

Flareon's bad base 65 Speed, meanwhile, leaves it outsped by most of the metagame, including key threats like Nidoqueen. Even if it can still win against foes like Abra and Pinsir, having to take an extra hit means it gets worn down quickly and revenge killed by faster threats. Flareon often fails to outdamage faster Fire-types, as their higher Speed lets them launch more attacks against the opposing team. They also have traits that offer more game-to-game utility than Flareon's sheer damage. Rapidash outspeeds Fearow, Arcanine has excellent bulk, and Magmar can threaten Omanyte, something no other Fire-type can do.</p> <p>Thus, you can only justify using Flareon alongside another Fire-type and heavy paralysis support. With proper support Flareon is a usable wallbreaker, as besides Omanyte, no Pokemon can safely switch into all of its attacks. Notably, it's among the few Pokemon that can reliably 2HKO Porygon.

Once boosted, Flareon becomes extremely threatening, with even Fire-resistant Pokemon like Slowbro and Starmie taking over 40% if Fire Blast lands a critical hit thereafter. It's not just a strong special attacker either; Flareon has a solid base 130 Attack stat to support it against Pokemon like Chansey, which it can 2HKO with consecutive critical hit Body Slams.

In fact, even Rhydon can take up to 60% while being outsped, though that KO is extremely risky to go for. The burn chance is also very helpful, crippling Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros while also aiding in KO ranges; however, landing a burn against Pokemon like Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey can make it significantly harder to beat them in the long run. Body Slam complements Fire Blast well, making Flareon more self-sufficient with paralysis while 2HKOing Chansey and Starmie with consecutive critical hits; however, it's recommended to use Substitute first in this scenario to avoid paralysis. A single critical hit can also put Alakazam into sub-25% range, meaning it cannot use Substitute thereafter; this also puts it in range for Quick Attack to KO. Quick Attack can be used to pick off Pokemon that barely survive Flareon's attacks, or that alternatively have used Substitute to the point they're left with 1 HP. However, Flareon can use Substitute itself for additional safety against paralysis users like Chansey and Exeggutor. It's worth attempting to set up Substitute against paralyzed Pokemon to try and get it for free with full paralysis. However, this is inconsistent, as setting up both Substitute and Focus Energy naturally means giving the opponent free turns, meaning the turns spent can be for naught.</p> <p>Flareon has minor potential to be customized further; generally, the fourth moveslot is used. Double-Edge is a valid option, providing a good option to finish off limping Pokemon or pressure Substitute users while avoiding recoil.

Flamethrower is also a fair option as an accurate Fire Blast alternative with far more PP, but the drop in damage is significant. While Hyper Beam's downsides are poor, a critical hit can OHKO Chansey, Jolteon, and Alakazam while KOing Starmie if it's taken even minute damage, though the recharge turn usually leads to Flareon taking paralysis right after.</p> <p>Flareon is best used late-game when the opposing team has likely been paralyzed, though it can also be used to punish a Snorlax or Exeggutor asleep from Rest, which are decently common sights in the Stadium OU metagame. From there, Flareon can set up Focus Energy with impunity and start firing off potentially nuclear blows at the opposing team. While its consistency is poor, the reward often means removing crucial parts of the opposing team, which Flareon's teammates should greatly appreciate. Flareon works best alongside Pokemon that can consistently land paralysis on the opposing team, such as Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey. Because it struggles to break past Slowbro, Starmie, and the rare Kabutops, it's recommended to use it alongside consistent checks to them, such as Thunderbolt Chansey alongside Exeggutor.</p> "

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Porygon is a small fish in a big pond. Its stats are typical of an unevolved Pokemon, making it much slower and weaker than just about everything. Despite this issue, Porygon's access to Recover and immunity to paralysis from Body Slam give it just enough to be a surprisingly viable pick in OU. These two traits make Porygon an impeccable switch-in to one of the most important Pokemon in OU, Snorlax. Porygon has just enough Speed and physical bulk to switch in against Snorlax and stall out its 24 Body Slam PP with its 32 Recover PP. Most variants of Snorlax will struggle to make any progress against Porygon, meaning Porygon can consistently force it to switch out, as it is almost never worth using Snorlax's Self-Destruct against such a low-value Pokemon. Porygon should always be used with Chansey to create a defensive core; Chansey can handle special attackers like Alakazam and Starmie, while Porygon can handle Snorlax and paralyzed physical attackers.</p> <p>While its matchup against Snorlax is its main selling point, Porygon can wall some other Pokemon in a pinch. Pokemon that are unable to reliably status Porygon will usually struggle to defeat it in a head-to-head matchup. Especially if they are paralyzed, Porygon is relatively comfortable against Tauros and Gengar, for example. However, Porygon has some consistency issues in even its best matchups. Critical hits and strong attacks can expose its poor defensive stats, Ice Beam and Blizzard can freeze it, Special drops from Psychic can overwhelm it, and paralysis can render it unable to wall Snorlax securely. Perhaps worst of all, Porygon can be easily overpowered by Amnesia Snorlax, meaning it will have almost nothing to do against teams with that set.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Porygon has a very deep movepool to play with, both offensively and defensively. Psychic is likely the most valuable alternative coverage move. Psychic comes with a useful chance to drop the foe's Special, but Thunderbolt or a Normal-type move tends to be superior because of the many Psychic-type Pokemon that can come in and scare Porygon out. Psywave is mildly useful as a universal coverage option that can deal up to 150 damage. However, its low accuracy and heavy randomness make it less than reliable.</p> <p>Reflect can make Porygon even more consistent against Snorlax and Tauros. However, it can be difficult to find an opportunity to use it, as Porygon will generally want to heal or use Thunder Wave first in most cases. Flash is another move for bullying Snorlax and common switch-ins. While the move has poor accuracy itself, it can help Porygon keep up some momentum, as most Pokemon will want to switch out after sustaining the accuracy drop. Sharpen can slowly but surely boost Porygon’s Attack so it can deal hefty damage with Tri Attack or Hyper Beam. Setting up with Sharpen is often quite difficult because Porygon is easy to scare off with paralysis, but it can potentially succeed against a weakened or paralyzed team. Recover also makes Porygon unique among other boosting Pokemon, as it can heal and doesn’t necessarily need to commit to attacking once it starts setting up.</p> <p>Conversion is a mildly interesting option that Porygon can use to combat certain special attackers like Alakazam, Jynx, Cloyster, and Jolteon. Realistically, however, Conversion will only be useful if Snorlax is already dealt with, as most special attackers have a way to paralyze Porygon—negating its primary purpose in handling Snorlax—or can simply overwhelm it with strong attacks. Toxic allows Porygon to deal passive damage to Snorlax while it repeatedly uses Recover, thus forcing Snorlax to use Rest sooner, even if it is carrying Amnesia. However, a number of Pokemon that are likely to switch into Porygon, like Chansey, Alakazam, and Starmie, generally don't mind Toxic, as it allows them to dodge more dangerous status effects like sleep, freeze, and paralysis. Finally, Mimic is a decent option on Porygon. The main purpose of Mimic is to pick up Amnesia from Amnesia Snorlax, which otherwise completely bulldozes Porygon. At a mere 25% chance, though, this is not a reliable option, unfortunately.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Status Moves: Paralysis completely ruins Porygon, so Pokemon with Thunder Wave or Stun Spore can consistently force it to switch. This means many Pokemon are very capable of threatening it, including Chansey, Alakazam, Starmie, Zapdos, Jolteon, Slowbro, and some variants of Exeggutor and Victreebel. Unless Porygon has an opportunity to KO these Pokemon, it must almost always switch out into a teammate that can absorb paralysis. Sleep and freeze also quickly deal with Porygon, and it is quite vulnerable to the former due to its low Speed. However, because Porygon has relatively low value, it is often good for Porygon to take sleep or freeze so nothing else on the team must. While rare, confusion also inhibits Porygon a lot, as Porygon isn’t bulky enough to risk hitting itself and giving up a free turn to the opponent.</p> <p><strong>Stat Alteration: Because Porygon has mediocre defensive stats, it becomes easy to exploit if the foe begins to boost their stats or lower Porygon’s stats. Amnesia users like Snorlax and Slowbro can boost largely unfettered against Porygon and begin doing a lot of damage. Slowbro in particular only needs to get to +4 before it has a chance to OHKO Porygon. Swords Dance users, while not particularly common, also can set up rather comfortably in front of Porygon and overwhelm it. Special drops from Psychic also threaten Porygon quite a lot. Exeggutor, for example, is guaranteed to 2HKO Porygon with Psychic if the first hit drops its Special. Other users like Alakazam and Starmie also have no issue breaking through Porygon after a Special drop.</p> <p><strong>Critical Hits</strong>: Porygon often has trouble with faster foes even if they can’t paralyze it as critical hits imperil Porygon quickly. Tauros, even if it is paralyzed, can potentially break through Porygon if it gets multiple consecutive critical hits. If Snorlax gets a critical hit, it often places Porygon on the backfoot, as it will lose more health than it can recoup with Recover in a single turn. Moreover, a desperate Hyper Beam will cleanly OHKO Porygon if Snorlax manages to score a critical hit. Heavy hitters like Exeggutor, Jolteon, and Zapdos will also make short work of Porygon if they can get a critical hit or two.</p> <p><strong>Partial Trapping</strong>: Porygon’s poor Speed leaves it vulnerable to partial trappers like Cloyster, Victreebel, and Dragonite. Partial trappers can accumulate significant damage on Porygon and pivot to a hard counter, all before Porygon has a chance to heal.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Recover is one of the most important moves in RBY and the primary reason Porygon has a niche. The move is mandatory for Porygon to wall and stall Snorlax. Given Recover's 32 PP, Porygon can easily absorb all 24 Snorlax Body Slam hits and then some. Unless Snorlax is carrying Amnesia, it lacks any solid option to break through Porygon. Outside of a freeze from Ice Beam or multiple consecutive critical hits, Snorlax can only feasibly beat a healthy Porygon with Self-Destruct. Considering this is generally a poor trade for the Snorlax user, they will often be forced to switch it out. This gives the Porygon user the opportunity to double switch or attack to maintain some momentum. Porygon can prevent Snorlax from getting offensive momentum while keeping Pokemon that often answer Snorlax, like Chansey, Starmie, and one's own Snorlax, safe and available to fill other roles. Porygon is a rather frail Pokemon, so it should use Recover very liberally. It should avoid switching out until it is at or near full health, as it would otherwise risk falling to a heavier hit from Snorlax, like Hyper Beam or any critical hit.</p> <p>Thunder Wave is also essentially required. Paralysis is critical for mitigating Snorlax: full paralysis generates free turns for Porygon, enabling it to attack instead of simply using Recover on most every turn. Paralysis also makes other physical attackers much more manageable. While Tauros is very unlikely to stay in against a healthy Porygon, if it must do so in a desperate endgame, Porygon can rather safely win the one-on-one by using Thunder Wave, using Recover, and waiting for full paralyses to attack and eventually KO Tauros. Similarly, Thunder Wave is a good way to pressure Pokemon like Gengar and Exeggutor. Additionally, because Porygon pretty consistently forces Snorlax to switch, Porygon can potentially paralyze the Pokemon that commonly switch in like Chansey, Starmie, and Alakazam. However, doing this may prevent Porygon from reaching full health before it switches out, as Porygon will have to switch out in fear of paralysis.</p> <p>While Porygon may have dismal offensive stats, it has a large and diverse offensive movepool. Ice Beam is the most common attack on Porygon primarily due to its ability to freeze foes. While Porygon generally defeats Snorlax via a war of attrition regardless, it is more than happy to cut the war short with a freeze. Ice Beam allows Porygon to participate in freeze wars and keep higher value Pokemon, like Chansey and one’s own Snorlax, safe from bad luck. Ice Beam is also a reasonable coverage move with a potential 2HKO on Rhydon and likely 4HKOs on Exeggutor and Zapdos. Being able to chip or even potentially freeze switch-ins like Chansey, Starmie, and Alakazam is also significant. Porygon’s final move extends its coverage. Thunderbolt is the most common choice, as it complements Ice Beam famously well. It notably enables Porygon to bully or finish off Water-type Pokemon like Starmie, Slowbro, Cloyster, and Lapras, especially if they are paralyzed. It also has a fair amount of PP to improve Porygon's ability to stall. Tri Attack is a fairly strong option that can pressure Pokemon with more special bulk, like Chansey, Alakazam, and Jynx. Finally, Hyper Beam is an option that can catch switch-ins and paralyzed foes by surprise. It can reliably pick off Chansey below 45% health and Alakazam below 60%. The choice for Porygon’s second offensive move often comes down to its teammates and player preference.</p> <p>Porygon has a very straightforward gameplan. Generally, it needs to do two things to stay successful. First, Porygon should try to stay as healthy as possible. Porygon should aim to switch out with as much health as possible so it can consistently answer Pokemon like Snorlax. It should generally only attack when it is close to or at full health. Two important benchmarks to keep in mind are 76.5% and 84.6% HP; Porygon must be at or above these points to survive a Hyper Beam and a critical hit Body Slam, respectively, and thus feel comfortable attacking instead of healing. It is imperative that Porygon ends every turn above both of these benchmarks, especially before it is switched out. In general, Porygon should prioritize Recover and Thunder Wave over attacking. Second, Porygon should avoid paralysis. Paralysis is often a death sentence for Porygon, as it will become slower than Snorlax and very easy to exploit on turns when it is fully paralyzed. Unless it can KO them immediately, Porygon should generally switch out when faced with paralysis inducers like Chansey, Starmie, Alakazam, Slowbro, Jolteon, Zapdos, and Stun Spore Exeggutor. The bigger-picture purpose of using Porygon often comes down to getting more out of one’s Snorlax and Chansey, as neither should need to deal with the opponent’s Snorlax when Porygon can do so. Snorlax is more free to forgo Reflect and explore more offensive options thanks to Porygon’s assistance. Additionally, if Porygon loses a freeze war against Snorlax, one’s own Snorlax can engage in a freeze war with no fear. Chansey works similarly, as it can focus on checking special attackers and be more difficult to exploit.</p> "

Porygon is generally considered unviable in the current metagame.</strong></p> <p>Porygon may be the most enigmatic Pokemon in RBY. While it has genuinely awful base stats, it has a wide Special movepool, an immunity to Body Slam paralysis, and two excellent moves in Thunder Wave and Recover. These traits allow it to muster a niche in OU and play a big role in NU. In UU, however, Porygon struggles to find a purpose and has no influence. It is only notable for its ability to bully Pokemon that are unable to either outspeed and 2HKO it or paralyze it, repeatedly using Recover and slowly chipping away at their health. This makes it a decent answer to paralyzed Normal-type attackers, like Kangaskhan, and bulky Water-type Pokemon, like Vaporeon and Omastar. Porygon is only a shaky check, however, as critical hits from Normal-type Pokemon can quickly put it into range of a Hyper Beam and Blizzards from Water-type Pokemon can potentially freeze it. Additionally, some teams simply do not use any of these Pokemon, leaving Porygon entirely without a purpose. Wrappers like Tentacruel, Dragonite, and even Tangela outspeed it, quickly whittle it down with Wrap or Bind, and can pivot out freely to a strong attacker to finish it off. Likewise, paralysis is a surefire way to shut down Porygon, as it will be unable to stall effectively with Recover and will drop quickly if it is fully paralyzed. Because other Pokemon perform Porygon's jobs more consistently while carrying a greater offensive presence, like Clefable, Electabuzz, Venusaur, Gyarados, and most bulky Water-type Pokemon, it is generally not seen in RBY UU.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Because Porygon enjoys facing bulky Water-type Pokemon, Thunderbolt is mandatory so it can actually apply some pressure to them. Thunderbolt has a good chance to 3HKO Omastar and Dewgong and will 4HKO Vaporeon. This means Porygon can usually force these Pokemon to switch or use Rest, thus helping its teammates switch in more comfortably. Additionally, Thunderbolt will 2HKO Gyarados, 3HKO Aerodactyl, and 4HKO Tentacruel, making them somewhat hesitant to switch in. Both Ice Beam and Psychic help Porygon match up better against Pokemon that can’t threaten it with paralysis. Ice Beam allows Porygon to potentially beat Dugtrio and Dragonite that aren't carrying Thunder Wave. Ice Beam can also be used in desperate situations to potentially freeze something before it is paralyzed or KOed. Psychic covers Haunter and can more easily pressure Normal-type Pokemon, Tentacruel, and Vaporeon if it happens to get a Special drop. Special drops also reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, which can make paralyzed Porygon somewhat more useful. Both moves also help Porygon against Venusaur. Thunder Wave is a necessity because of Porygon’s downright horrendous Speed. If Porygon is going to stall any Pokemon at all, the Pokemon absolutely needs to be paralyzed, as Porygon must be faster to use Recover successfully and requires free turns from full paralysis to chip it down. Thunder Wave can also potentially catch switch-ins like Tentacruel, Hypno, Kadabra, and Electabuzz. Recover allows Porygon to be a nuisance throughout the entire game. Because of its pitiful defenses, Porygon needs to be at full health to reliably switch into the majority of attacks, meaning it will be using Recover a lot, especially if it plans on switching out soon. Porygon has a few other interesting moves, like Tri Attack, Sharpen, and Agility, but it struggles to make room for or get use out of any of them.</p> <p>Porygon is nearly incapable of making any offensive progress against most teams. If a Pokemon is unable to break through Porygon, it is quite likely to switch to something that can quickly scare it out. Porygon is virtually useless once it is paralyzed, so Pokemon like Hypno are quite likely to switch in. The only Pokemon that pair well with Porygon are those that appreciate its ability to force switches, spread paralysis, and force Water-type Pokemon to use Rest. Thus, possible partners include Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, Kangaskhan, and Articuno.</p> "

As Rapidash and Fearow are incredibly common offensive threats, Omanyte will almost always have several opportunities to stop a powerful progress-maker in its tracks and then make its own progress. Few Pokemon enjoy switching into Omanyte's decently powerful Surf and Blizzard or risking Body Slam paralysis. However, Omanyte's offensive presence has flaws, as choosing the wrong move for its switch-in—such as Surf for Seaking or Body Slam for Gastly—leaves it in a bad position. Omanyte's terrible Speed makes it loses the one-on-one to a variety of metagame threats, such as Nidoqueen and Drowzee, which can force a powerful attack or status condition on one of Omanyte's teammate as it's forced out. Omanyte's low HP also leaves it extremely vulnerable to fixed-damage moves, which 3HKO it. Additionally, its switch-ins are very predictable, making it exploitable with double switching. Pokemon checked by Omanyte have ways to mitigate its effectiveness, as Fearow's sheer power and critical hit rate can quickly wear it down, while Rapidash can use Fire Spin to switch out if its team lacks a decent Omanyte switch-in. Effective use of Omanyte requires a team that can handle its shortcomings and careful management of its HP, but when played optimally, it can turn dangerous offensive threats into non-issues.</p> ",

Hydro Pump's extra damage against Drowzee leaves it always in range of Machamp's Hyper Beam or two Seismic Tosses, and it gives Rapidash's Hyper Beam and Pinsir's Slash favorable odds to KO Drowzee as well. However, Hydro Pump's poor accuracy makes it quite unreliable, with Surf usually being preferred over its inconsistent counterpart.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: While they all dislike paralysis, none of Omanyte's attacks do significant damage to any of the tier's Water-types, whereas they can easily overwhelm it with their STAB moves in return.

      "overview": "<p>NOTE - The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. Omastar is generally considered less viable in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <h1>Overview</h1> <p>Omastar first appeared on the RBY UU stage because it was thought to be a strong counter to the then recently-released legendary birds, Articuno and Moltres, as well as the Wrap-happy Dragonite to a lesser extent. However, as the metagame progressed, other significant Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Vaporeon proved more than capable of keeping the birds at bay. As Articuno became less potent and Moltres fell into obscurity, Omastar began to find itself somewhat unemployed. As such, Omastar dwells near the bottom of the RBY UU metagame. It competes quite closely with Vaporeon, which is widely regarded as the tier’s premier bulky Water-type. Despite stiff competition, Omastar has a few attributes that set it apart from Vaporeon and other defensively-oriented Pokemon.</p> <p>Omastar’s most notable trait is its Rock typing, which makes it a much more specialized defensive unit compared to Vaporeon and the like. It matches up well against Pokemon that rely primarily or exclusively on Normal-, Flying-, or Fire-type moves such as Persian, Dodrio, and Moltres. Omastar is also rivaled only by Haunter and Golem at handling Wrap damage and Explosion. On the negative side, Omastar shares many of the same weaknesses held by other defensive Water-types, such as against Electric-type moves, while acquiring some additional ones. These include a new weakness to Ground-type moves, a worsened weakness to Grass-type moves, and the inability to resist the many Water-type attacks in the tier. Finally, Omastar is remarkably slow, being outpaced by every major Pokemon in the tier aside from Golem. This renders it highly susceptible to being revenge killed.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aside from its Rock typing, Seismic Toss is pretty much Omastar's only unique advantage over Vaporeon. It can be fairly useful for its consistent damage against any target. However, most Pokemon are simply hit harder by Omastar’s other moves or more threatened by the chance of paralysis from Body Slam, so the move isn’t overly common or useful. It is strongly advised to stick to the suggested set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Omastar’s archrival Vaporeon is also one of its most consistent checks. Vaporeon takes very little from all of Omastar’s moves and is relatively unfazed by paralysis. Vaporeon also uses Omastar’s Rock typing against it by scoring a 4HKO with Surf or a 3HKO with Hydro Pump. Poliwrath is in a similar boat, as it shrugs off Omastar’s attacks quite easily and can retaliate with a super effective move like Earthquake or Submission. Finally, while it fears paralysis, Tentacruel easily emerges victorious against Omastar thanks to its access to the strongest unboosted Surf in the tier.</p> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Users: Electabuzz and Raichu are two of the scariest Pokemon for Omastar to face. While Hydro Pump does quite a lot to both, both dispatch Omastar with relatively uncontested 2HKOs. While it lacks STAB on the move, Gyarados is also more than capable of winning the matchup, even if it switches in. Other users such as Haunter and Persian can't reliably switch in, but they can use their superior Speed to threaten Omastar in a pinch, especially if Omastar has taken a few hits or is asleep.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake Users: While Omastar is well-equipped to handle Normal- and Flying-type moves, its Rock typing leaves it exposed to Earthquake. Omastar is capable of beating every Earthquake user aside from Poliwrath one-on-one, but the move limits Omastar’s ability to switch in. Earthquake users can also revenge kill Omastar without much damage or paralysis support due to its low Speed. A sleeping Omastar can be exploited rather easily for this same reason. The wrong situation can make Pokemon that Omastar usually matches up well against, like Kangaskhan, Dugtrio, and Golem, suddenly threatening.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: While rare, Grass-type Pokemon truly threaten Omastar. Venusaur is especially scary, for it outspeeds and claims a clean OHKO with Razor Leaf. Tangela that choose to use Mega Drain can easily 2HKO Omastar while recovering enough health to not be too fearful of Omastar’s Blizzard. Additionally, its Mega Drain begins to enter OHKO territory after just two uses of Growth.</p> ",

It strongly resembles the set most often employed by Vaporeon and seeks to accomplish many of the same goals. Surf or Hydro Pump is its all-purpose STAB move. Both moves hit neutral and weak targets quite effectively thanks to Omastar’s rather high Special stat. Hydro Pump's extra damage is notable for a few targets, such as scoring a 3HKO against Hypno and a guaranteed 2HKO against Kangaskhan and Persian. Surf misses some benchmarks but has higher accuracy and PP. Blizzard grants Omastar coverage resisted only by Water-types. It is also notable for being extremely likely to OHKO Dragonite. It also outperforms Surf and Hydro Pump against a few targets such as Dodrio, Gyarados, and the handful of Grass-types that lurk in the tier. Body Slam is mainly for hitting opposing Water-types. Its most notable target is Tentacruel; should Body Slam paralyze it, it will likely be forced to use Rest and thus become much easier to exploit. Rest is, of course, to keep Omastar healthy, especially against less offensive teams. Successfully using Rest and waking up is quite difficult in the RBY UU environment, but Omastar can occasionally use Rest in front of the Pokemon it can wall and attempt to wake up amidst the many turns of Wrap likely to occur as the match continues.</p> <p>Omastar is quite good at slowing down your opponent’s offensive momentum. Its Rock typing can be very helpful for pivoting into the many Normal-type moves thrown around in the tier. Omastar can come in rather freely against Persian and Kangaskhan, provided they are using a Normal-type move, and threaten a 2HKO in return. Omastar becomes especially potent if switched in against a Hyper Beam, as it essentially has a free turn to use a powerful special attack. It should be noted that a revealed Omastar is a fairly good deterrent to reckless use of Hyper Beam and Explosion. Additionally, Omastar completely walls Dodrio and Articuno, only fearing the latter freezing it. While it is hardly worth mentioning in the modern metagame because they are so uncommon, Omastar is exceptional at walling Fire-type Pokemon.</p> <p>Omastar also has interesting interactions with Wrap. It resists the attack, so it is quite good at either PP stalling the attacker or simply taking the hits and hoping to punish a miss. When paired with other Pokemon that take little or no damage from Wrap, like Haunter and Golem, Omastar can feasibly force Tentacruel or Dragonite to exhaust all of their Wrap PP by simply switching in and out with the other Pokemon. Such a strategy can still be exploited by many potential Omastar switch-ins, such as Dugtrio, Electabuzz, and Raichu. This can be overcome with proper prediction; you can pivot into a Pokemon that matches up well against common switch-ins to Omastar. And in end-games where many of these attackers are KOed, Omastar can help secure victories against Pokemon that are dependent on Wrap for damage, such as some variants of Dragonite.</p> <p>As the tier’s premier Articuno check, Omastar is quite useful on teams that struggle with the legendary bird. Teammates such as Dugtrio, Tangela, and Venusaur most appreciate Omastar's combination of attributes. These three Pokemon also happen to handle Electric-type Pokemon quite well, which threaten Omastar. Flying-type Pokemon like Gyarados, Dragonite, and Dodrio similarly appreciate Omastar’s resistance to Ice while also switching into the Earthquakes that Omastar frequently baits in; these Earthquakes can also help Dodrio safely set up with Agility. While Omastar is a decidedly defensive Pokemon, it is quite good at enabling its offensive teammates, either by giving them a partner into which they can pivot or by spreading paralysis via Body Slam.</p> "

It provides it with useful resistances to Normal and Ice, which allow it to punish Hyper Beam and Explosion, and let it check Snorlax and Tauros lacking Earthquake. This is backed up by its solid bulk and good Special, which enables it to do significant damage with Hydro Pump. Its movepool contains decent utility and coverage options such as Ice Beam, Seismic Toss, Submission, and Body Slam.</p> <p>Omastar is not recommended for most OU teams, though, as it is plagued by several crippling flaws that outweigh these qualities. It is walled by the omnipresent Chansey and the common Starmie. Slowbro also has little trouble walling it and can use it as an opportunity to set up with Amnesia. Omastar's typing is a double-edged sword that gives it weaknesses to Earthquake and Thunderbolt, which are both common in the metagame. Even if it avoids both, Omastar has to rely on Rest for recovery, which renders it useless for two turns, giving offensive threats such as Tauros and Zapdos opportunities to switch into it and wreak havoc.</p> ",

Hydro Pump also 3HKOes most other Pokemon that are not named Chansey and do not resist Water. This includes Snorlax, so, even if it is carrying Earthquake, Omastar can still force it out if it switches in on a predicted Snorlax Rest. If Hydro Pump's low PP and 79.7% accuracy are a concern, Surf can be used instead at the cost of a noticeable reduction in power. Ice Beam 3HKOes Exeggutor and Zapdos, and it can also be used to fish for a freeze. Body Slam is used specifically to fish for paralysis on switch-ins like Starmie, though it cannot paralyze Chansey, which also likes to switch into Omastar. Seismic Toss is an alternative option to do consistent damage to Starmie, Slowbro, and Cloyster. Rest restores Omastar to full HP and removes any status it had beforehand. With it, Omastar can loop the rare Amnesia Snorlax that runs Ice Beam as its only move. Unfortunately, Snorlax more commonly runs Blizzard when using Amnesia and 3HKOes Omastar with it at +6.</p> <p>Omastar has some other options. Blizzard is usable because it 2HKOes Victreebel and requires less prior chip damage than Ice Beam to 2HKO Exeggutor and Zapdos. However, Victreebel is rare, and Blizzard has less PP and accuracy than Ice Beam. Submission 3HKOes Chansey, but it has little other use, causes recoil damage, and only has 79.7% accuracy. Substitute protects Omastar from Ice Beam freezes and paralysis from Body Slam and allows it to burn a Rest turn for free. Reflect and Withdraw boost Omastar's Defense so it can check Snorlax carrying Earthquake, but they do nothing to stop Chansey, Starmie, and Slowbro from walling it. Mimic is unreliable but can get Omastar solid moves from its switch-ins like Thunderbolt, Thunder Wave, and Sing.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Kabutops is a potent offensive Pokemon in RBY NU, featuring both Slash and Swords Dance to supplement its already strong Attack stat. The latter gives Kabutops the feared Swords Dance + Hyper Beam combination, allowing it to force its way through defensive staples like Arcanine and Blastoise, notably outspeeding the latter. With STAB Surf or Hydro Pump to supplement this, similarly to Kingler, Kabutops isn't hindered by Rock-type switch-ins. Unlike Kingler, however, Kabutops exchanges raw power for an excellent typing that leaves it undeterred by moves like Fire Spin, Fire Blast, Hyper Beam, and Explosion, giving it ample switch-in opportunities. This typing also opens the way for defensive sets, giving teams a much-needed backbone against the powerful offensive threats of the tier without squandering its own offensive potential.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Kabutops's typing comes back to bite it against Electric- and Ground-type attacks, which are reasonably common in RBY NU. This leaves it severely threatened by Mr. Mime, Electrode, and Nidoking and even reasonably checked by Earthquake Charizard and Golem. Kabutops's Speed is also just a bit below what would be desirable, letting offensive titan Nidoking outspeed it; this Speed also leaves it easily worn down alongside chip damage from Toxic. Its Special is also below average, worsening its Electric weakness and leaving its own special attacks noticeably weaker than those of its Water-type brethren. Naturally, this gives it fierce competition with other Water-types like Blastoise, Kingler, Seadra, and Poliwhirl.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Swords Dance Kabutops functions as a strong wallbreaker and late-game sweeper, exploiting Rest users in the tier like Blastoise, Arcanine, and Seadra with ease in combination with Hyper Beam. Its +2 Hyper Beam is very strong, OHKOing Mr. Mime and Raticate, as well as giving chances to OHKO Dragonair, Venomoth, Fearow, Electrode, Rapidash, and Porygon. Furthermore, +2 Hyper Beam can deal over 65% to Blastoise, one of the most important defensive Pokemon in the tier. If coming in on a predicted Rest, Kabutops is poised to either get a free Swords Dance boost or attack a potential switch-in with Body Slam or Slash. Between the two, Body Slam spreads paralysis while being boosted by Swords Dance, while Slash reduces reliance on Swords Dance but isn't boosted by it. Surf OHKOes Golem, 2HKOes Nidoking, and 3HKOes the rare Gastly, ensuring that foes don't exploit its Normal-type attacks.</p> <p>Kabutops shouldn't use Swords Dance immediately; it's best to score damage from Body Slam or Slash first and only use Swords Dance to close out the game, or if breaking through a wall is imperative at the time. Despite being a Swords Dance user, Kabutops can be useful throughout the game primarily thanks to its typing, as it exploits early-game Fire Spin from Pokemon like Charizard, Rapidash, Moltres, and Ninetales well. It often forces these Pokemon out, especially if they lack Toxic or Earthquake, which they need to hope to make progress against it. It's worth noting that Kabutops isn't too afraid of being burned, as Swords Dance boosts negate the Attack drop and Slash outright ignores them thanks to RBY critical hit mechanics; this resilience, coupled with its typing, makes it one of the best blockades against teams featuring multiple Fire-types. However, the passive damage does leave Kabutops easily worn down, especially because its mediocre Speed makes it susceptible to Fire Spin users.</p> <p>Outside of the given moves, Kabutops can be diversified a bit. Blizzard deals only a bit less damage than Surf but covers Exeggcute and Fearow, the former of which can sometimes be an obstacle to a sweep. However, losing super effective coverage for Fire-types and worsening the damage on Golem often makes it a less-than-stellar option. Submission is plausible coverage for Clefable, Wigglytuff, Porygon, and Raticate, but without recovery, the recoil damage often leaves Kabutops easily worn down. Conversion Porygon notably walls Kabutops if it lacks Submission, so the move can be justified on teams weak to it. Hydro Pump gives Kabutops a shot at 2HKOing Moltres and has higher damage across the board, but this utility rarely merits the accuracy drop.</p> <p>Swords Dance Kabutops fits best on teams that need a wallbreaker but can't afford the loss in defensive integrity that other users like Kingler, Pinsir, and Sandslash may cause. Fellow Water-type Pokemon like Blastoise, Seadra, and Poliwhirl appreciate the openings Kabutops can bring by removing opposing Water-types, making them very strong partners. Pinsir also appreciates the openings Kabutops can present while resisting Earthquake, giving the two strong offensive synergy. Nidoking makes a fine partner, switching in on Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Thunderbolt for free while not losing momentum, all moves that mortally threaten Kabutops.</p> "

Slash is particularly notable for this set, as it 3HKOes defensive behemoth Blastoise over a third of the time, forcing it to try and Rest stall or switch out. Surf provides the coverage to OHKO Golem and 2HKO Nidoking and Sandslash, all of which otherwise threaten Rest Kabutops.</p> <p>This variant sees more liberal use throughout the game than Swords Dance Kabutops, as Rest means it can heal off any damage accrued through sources like Fire Spin, Toxic, and switching in on resisted attacks. Furthermore, this set isn't opposed to taking paralysis, as it can often use Rest and successfully wake up multiple times a game. This resilience, especially given the abundance of Fire-type Pokemon and Normal-type attacks in RBY NU, makes it more of a defensive pivot for some teams. If running Body Slam, it should be used frequently, as its high paralysis chance makes switching into Kabutops very difficult; if it paralyzes a switch-in, Kabutops will frequently win the interaction outright.</p> <p>Rest Kabutops works best on teams that lack a defensive backbone, especially thriving against opposing Kabutops and teams spamming Fire-types. Ergo, it can work well alongside Venomoth, a Pokemon normally countered by lead Fire-types such as Charizard and Ninetales. Moltres also appreciates the presence of Rest Kabutops, providing pivoting potential and defensive synergy in return given its Ground immunity and high Special. Nidoking is a strong offensive partner, as it can switch in on Electric-type attacks and Toxic while threatening most of the tier with its own super effective damage thereafter.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Kabutops is a very dangerous Pokemon and among the best Swords Dance users in OU. First of all, its base 115 Attack stat is very respectable, and it sports the best high critical hit rate move in the game—Slash. While this may seem counterproductive for Swords Dance, since in RBY critical hits ignore stat boosts, it means Kabutops can pose an immediate threat without having to raise its Attack. Slash also gives it wallbreaking potential, mostly because critical hits also ignore Reflect. Because Kabutops can switch in on recovery moves such as Rest and Recover and immediately pose a threat, it commonly forces the opponent to switch in a check that lacks recovery, like Exeggutor or Tauros, to force it out. This means Kabutops will do permanent damage. Its typing grants it a valuable resistance to Normal and Ice. This means it can freely set up against Pokemon such as Cloyster, sometimes against Chansey without Thunderbolt (depending on circumstance, the threat of Thunder Wave may pose a problem) and on any variant of Snorlax not packing Earthquake—or the very rare Thunderbolt.</p> <p>However, while Kabutops's typing is certainly one of its key assets, it also leaves it with very unfortunate weaknesses to Electric and Ground. This means it can't switch in as much as it would want against Rhydon despite its Surf and good Defense. Also, Kabutops is easy to force out with Thunderbolt users such as Jolteon, Zapdos, Gengar, Starmie, and Lapras—the first four outspeed it, and Lapras easily survives a +2 Hyper Beam. Kabutops can struggle to discourage them from switching in, giving them great momentum. Surf is weak enough against them to almost give a free switch. A Hyper Beam use can be punished by Gengar, while Swords Dance usually gives free entry to Thunderbolt users. Every move besides Slash is fairly easy to punish—and Gengar even ignores that, countering Kabutops outright. Slash is still a great move and helps deter these threats, but again its critical hits ignore Swords Dance boosts. Therefore, if these threats can pressure Kabutops into using Slash often, they reduce its threat ceiling in practice. Also, Hyper Beam's 10.4% miss chance or Kabutops's 15.6% critical hit rate can just ruin its sweep, a likely scenario if Kabutops is expected to KO several Pokemon consecutively.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Body Slam can be used to paralyze switch-ins, potentially paralyzing a Pokemon such as Starmie or Exeggutor and thus facilitating a sweeper like Rhydon, but it is difficult to drop one of the listed moves. Dropping Surf means losing to Rhydon and not being able to damage Gengar at all. Dropping Slash makes Kabutops's job of wallbreaking much harder, with it unable to reliably get past Reflect Snorlax and Chansey or hit switch-ins hard, and dropping Swords Dance or Hyper Beam severely hinders its sweeping capabilities. Blizzard may also seem a good choice, but missing out on the OHKO on Rhydon is very detrimental, and Slash hits Exeggutor and Zapdos harder.</p> <p>For a completely different approach, a more defensive set using Rest, Slash, Surf, and either Reflect or Body Slam could be used. It makes use of Kabutops's key resistances to Normal and Ice, with Slash allowing it to not forfeit momentum. However, Reflect is generally only useful against Earthquake from Tauros and Snorlax, the former having a very high critical hit rate anyway and the latter often forgoing Earthquake for overall more useful moves, giving Reflect fringe utility at best. However, Body Slam is fringe too: it moves Kabutops away from purer defense towards a sort of offensive support role, a less unique role that other Pokemon such as Snorlax and Rhydon fulfill better. They don't need to sacrifice as much of their offensive presence—remember that this Kabutops set drops Swords Dance and Hyper Beam—to be physical walls or lure in and paralyze certain threats.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Gengar: Gengar is undoubtedly the best Kabutops counter, since it can easily come in on any of Kabutops's moves and threaten it directly with Thunderbolt. It easily takes Kabutops down, even while paralyzed, since Surf is a 5HKO. If Sleep Clause is not in effect and no statused Pokemon can safely switch in, Gengar can also safely go for Hypnosis to punish the switch-in.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos outspeeds Kabutops and has a 61.5% chance to OHKO with Thunderbolt. If Zapdos is paralyzed, it's a check at best though, because Slash and +2 Hyper Beam is a guaranteed KO. Jolteon only has a 2.4% chance to OHKO with Thunderbolt, but its critical hit rate is very high and should be kept in mind. However, if Jolteon is paralyzed or asleep from Rest, it can no longer switch in either, because both Slash + Hyper Beam and +2 Hyper Beam are almost always a KO.</p> <p><strong>Starmie: Starmie is never OHKOed by Slash + Hyper Beam or +2 Hyper Beam, which means it can easily come in and threaten Kabutops with Thunder Wave, Thunderbolt, or to a lesser extent even Surf and Psychic. However, if it's paralyzed, it has to watch out.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor needs Mega Drain to counter Kabutops, since it is almost always KOed by Slash and +2 Hyper Beam. Otherwise, sets without it can come in once and threaten with a status move—or even heavy damage with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Victreebel</strong>: Razor Leaf OHKOes Kabutops, and Kabutops cannot realistically expect to KO Victreebel even if it switches in, since a +2 Hyper Beam only has a 1 in 39 chance to OHKO. Much like Gengar, it can somewhat safely go for Sleep Powder if circumstances allow for it.</p> <p><strong>Lapras</strong>: Lapras checks Kabutops in a similar way to Exeggutor, with the notable difference that it can generally switch in twice instead of once, and Thunderbolt is a guaranteed 2HKO. It can also use Sing similarly to Gengar.</p> ",

          "name": "Standard",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set makes Kabutops a very menacing threat in OU, although the reasons why may not be immediately apparent. While Slash does not benefit from Swords Dance boosts, it comes off of a very high 115 base Attack stat, which allows it to immediately threaten a paralyzed Alakazam or Chansey (and Starmie to a lesser extent), as well as Rest Snorlax. If the former two have full paralysis on a recovering turn or Kabutops comes in on Rest from the latter, the opponent will be forced to switch them out, most likely to a Pokemon such as Exeggutor or Tauros that takes permanent damage. Slash is not a 3HKO on Snorlax, but Snorlax cannot just stall Kabutops with Rest because it is too easy to predict the Rest and use Swords Dance. Once Kabutops is at +2, two Slashes and a Hyper Beam KO Snorlax after Rest before it can attack, forcing Snorlax to switch or risk fainting. Even if Snorlax uses Reflect, it offers little protection because Kabutops has plenty of opportunities to boost to +4. Alternatively, Kabutops can fish for a critical hit with Surf while Snorlax is asleep—a viable strategy considering Kabutops's respectable critical hit rate.</p> <p>The benefits of Slash don't end here, though. Slash with +2 Hyper Beam is enough to KO Zapdos and Tauros 100% of the time, as well as Exeggutor 95.4% of the time. If Chansey is at 88.6% health, Slash + Hyper Beam becomes a guaranteed KO. At 84.4%, Slash becomes a guaranteed 2HKO too, so a little bit of chip damage comes a long way in breaking through Chansey.</p> <p>Kabutops also packs a big, big punch as a late-game sweeper. +4 Hyper Beam is a guaranteed KO on Exeggutor and anything more frail than it. With a bit of chip damage, +2 Hyper Beam KOes Starmie and Chansey. Kabutops is not very hard to find setup opportunities with, either: any sleeping Pokemon such as Rest Cloyster, Snorlax, or Jolteon (provided it comes in on the latter's Rest turn) will do. Sleep fodder your opponent is trying to sack, a Rhydon switching out fearing Surf, and an untimely full paralysis are other possible setup windows.</p> <p>Kabutops also distinguishes itself from other setup sweepers because paralysis does not end its usability in the game. While its late-game sweeping abilities are hindered, its respectable Speed means it's still very capable of beating several Pokemon such as Chansey, Snorlax, Cloyster, and paralyzed Alakazam, using Swords Dance to reapply the latter's paralysis Speed drop and outspeed it. Paralyzed Kabutops also still does significant damage with Slash to potential switch-ins.</p> <p>Kabutops's typing plays a key role in the Tauros matchup, and typing is perhaps the main asset it has over Sandslash and Kingler. Kabutops's Rock typing means that Tauros will generally resort to Earthquake to beat it, or the much rarer Thunderbolt. Not only does Earthquake have a mere 2.2% chance to 2HKO, it will also never OHKO a full health Kabutops with a critical hit. Sandslash is always 2HKOed by Tauros's Blizzard and OHKOed if it's a critical hit, while Kingler taking on Tauros is likely to find itself paralyzed by a neutral Body Slam, severely hindering its ability to continue the sweep. Earthquake also comes without a freeze or paralysis chance, which gives Kabutops much better odds at late-game sweeping. Unboosted Kabutops can even beat Tauros one-on-one in some situations, usually winning if Tauros is damaged by Slash beforehand or switches in on it. Kabutops also has the most reliable way of disposing of Rhydon and Golem with Surf, since Kingler's Crabhammer has unreliable accuracy, and Sandslash must be at +4 to always OHKO with Earthquake, but this comes the expense of being worse against Gengar.</p> <p>Lastly, Kabutops also has good synergy with Electric-types such as Zapdos. They can seriously threaten each other's counters, and most players will switch Rhydon in without second thought upon sight of Zapdos, allowing for a double switch to Kabutops and subsequent threat of a setup sweep.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Agility + Partial Trapping and Sleep-inducing moves, as well as Lapras becoming legal. Aerodactyl is generally considered less viable in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <h1>Overview</h1> <p>Aerodactyl is able to find a niche on anti-Wrap cores thanks to its exceptionally high Speed, which allows it to check and revenge kill even some of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, like Dugtrio and Persian. This Speed gives it an incredible 25.39% critical hit rate while also making it difficult to pin down with Wrap. Aerodactyl also has an amazing defensive typing that provides it with immunity to Earthquake and resistance to Normal-type attacks, granting it great synergy with physically frail Pokemon like Electabuzz and Raichu. Finally, Aerodactyl's Normal resistance allows it to PP stall Wrap, dissuade Explosion, and force recharges from Hyper Beam.</p> <p>However, Aerodactyl comes with a slew of problems. It's hindered severely by a lack of STAB options, with its sole semi-functional one being the mediocre Sky Attack. This extends to the rest of its offensive movepool, often leading Aerodactyl to use Fire Blast. Overall, these movepool issues limit Aerodactyl's damage output by quite a bit. Furthermore, its reliance on Double-Edge forces it to take heavy recoil and leaves it susceptible to knocking itself into KO range, severely limiting its defensive use throughout a game. Defensively, Aerodactyl is very frail specially, taking massive damage from Surf and Blizzard, both very common attacks in the tier. As a result, it will struggle against threats like its extinct brethren Omastar and often get forced out. Aerodactyl is extremely reliant on its Speed as well, making paralysis a near-death sentence, once again forcing it out if it can't KO the user before it gets paralyzed. This is further amplified by the risk of Body Slam paralyzing it, which makes what would otherwise be a switch-in opportunity a dangerous game to play.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aerodactyl's fourth move slot is the most expendable, and while its movepool is very limited, this isn't to say there aren't options. Rest is the most relevant option, allowing Aerodactyl to serve a more defensive role while removing paralysis, ensuring it can maintain a defensive presence throughout a game. Considering Wrap deducts sleep turns, Rest plays well into Aerodactyl's playstyle. However, Rest also makes it easy setup fodder for Dragonite. Alternatively, Sky Attack can be used to hit Haunter and OHKO Kadabra, which isn't unfeasible if it's charged during a Recover turn in Kadabra's case, but its two-turn nature and shaky accuracy make it unreliable and specific.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types: Aerodactyl can't scratch Rock-types at all—especially Omastar and Golem—and is weak to almost every attack they commonly use. As a result, Aerodactyl invites these threats in just by existing and will be subsequently forced out.</p> <p><strong>Haunter: Haunter is immune to Aerodactyl's main attacking options and takes minimal damage from Fire Blast. As if this weren't enough, it 2HKOes Aerodactyl with Thunderbolt. The best Aerodactyl can offer against it is a potential burn, which makes its Explosion pitifully weak. However, Haunter must be wary of Sky Attack.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Aerodactyl takes heavy damage from any viable Water-type's STAB Surf. While it can survive Surf from Vaporeon at full HP, Double-Edge's recoil means it will almost never be in a situation where it can make use of it. This also makes Tentacruel's 28.2% chance to OHKO Aerodactyl with Surf much more imposing. Gyarados can 2HKO Aerodactyl with Surf or Thunderbolt or even OHKO it with Hydro Pump 89.7% of the time. However, Aerodactyl is very capable of revenge killing Water-types not named Omastar through Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Aerodactyl's main strength in RBY UU is its Speed, so paralysis is the bane of its existence. It will force Aerodactyl to use Agility to remain in control, assuming it is running it, which can be very difficult to set up reliably and leaves it open to exploitation from Pokemon like Dragonite. Unless Aerodactyl can take out opposing paralysis inducers like Electabuzz and Hypno, it's forced to switch out. It should be noted that they're KOed by Hyper Beam from 47.1% and 37.5% onwards, respectively. Raichu can notably use Agility to outspeed Aerodactyl and 2HKO it with Thunderbolt. Electrode can do the same, and its naturally higher Speed makes matters worse. Body Slam's paralysis chance can also make checking Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Dodrio much riskier than it should be, making what would normally be a valid point of entry a potential death sentence.</p> <p><strong>Articuno: Articuno takes middling damage from Aerodactyl's options outside of Fire Blast, can boost itself to become faster than it through Agility, and OHKOes it with Blizzard. If Articuno has used Agility, Aerodactyl can't do anything.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: While a Toxic or even burn from Aerodactyl will completely stuff its chances of a Wrap sweep, Dragonite is more than capable of beating Aerodactyl. It can use Agility to outspeed and 2HKO Aerodactyl with Blizzard or Thunderbolt, and it doesn't take much damage from its attacks. It also has access to Thunder Wave, which incapacitates Aerodactyl and makes it much more vulnerable to Wrap.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Double-Edge acts as Aerodactyl's main attacking move, allowing it to deal significant damage to physically weak Pokemon. Double-Edge notably 2HKOes Kadabra and puts Dugtrio into range for Hyper Beam. Hyper Beam allows Aerodactyl to revenge kill opposing Pokemon very effectively, KOing Tentacruel from 40.2% onwards. Fire Blast is most useful for the significant burn chance, which can incapacitate physical attackers and cause Wrap users to take more damage than they can deal when using it. Toxic can be used to prevent a Wrap sweep from Agility + Wrap Dragonite, but Agility is helpful for ignoring the Speed drop from paralysis. Fire Blast works well with Toxic, as burning Haunter and Tentacruel—which are immune to it—allows your own Tentacruel to further chip them using Wrap.</p> <p>Aerodactyl's main purpose during a game is to revenge kill Pokemon and prevent Wrap cores from making progress, all while providing defensive support through its typing. This is best facilitated by the use of partners that, like Aerodactyl, take minimal damage from Wrap, such as Haunter, Omastar, and Vaporeon. Alternatively, Aerodactyl can be fit onto teams with offensive Pokemon that can give it openings to sweep like Persian, Kangaskhan, and Dragonite. Overall, this culminates into a hit-and-run playstyle that makes it work well, be it early- or late-game.</p> <p>Aerodactyl's resistance to Normal-type attacks and high Speed mean it can switch in on Wrap with near-impunity, taking minimal damage while guaranteeing damage on the opposing Wrap user should Aerodactyl stay in. Aerodactyl also happens to switch in well against Pokemon that use their teammate's Wrap to switch in freely, such as Dugtrio and Persian. This makes it a good response to these switch-ins with good prediction, especially if it comes in the same turn as them. Overall, Aerodactyl serves as very effective means to check these fast threats, dictating the game state efficiently by denying the opposing team momentum.</p> <p>Aerodactyl's Ground immunity makes it well equipped for double switching, allowing it to ease in Electric-types like Electabuzz, as well as Haunter and Tentacruel, through deterring the use of Earthquake. This makes Aerodactyl suitable for teams that lead with Electabuzz, as Dugtrio is fairly likely to switch in immediately, and Aerodactyl can KO Dugtrio with Double-Edge + Hyper Beam. Since Aerodactyl is thoroughly debilitated by paralysis, it appreciates having a Ground-type teammate like Dugtrio or Golem to switch in on Thunder Wave and maintain momentum.</p> "

  "Snorlax": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Snorlax is a centerpiece of the RBY OU metagame. It is present on almost every team due to its incredible strength, bulk, and versatility, in spite of its terrible Speed. Thanks to Reflect, Snorlax can upgrade its physical bulk to truly remarkable levels and begin firing powerful Body Slams with little concern about incoming hits. Defensive answers to its Body Slam do exist, but Snorlax has access to a plethora of options to threaten them, such as Earthquake to get around Gengar and Counter users, or Ice Beam to freeze Pokemon which try to fight Snorlax's Reflect with their own. Furthermore, Snorlax can even opt to give up a traditional Reflect set and catch opponents off-guard by using less common moves such as Amnesia or Counter, which can allow it to bypass some common answers, and it even has access to the strongest Self-Destruct in the game, giving it the ability to eliminate almost any Pokemon if necessary, with only Gengar and Rhydon being able to comfortably absorb it.</p> <p>Despite all these positive qualities, Snorlax comes with two inherent flaws: the lowest Speed in the metagame, only tied with Slowbro, and a lack of recovery outside of Rest. This means that once Snorlax is put to sleep it is possible for many special attackers in the tier to threaten it with their STAB moves: Psychic from the likes of Exeggutor, Starmie, Alakazam, and even Jynx can rapidly snowball out of control due to the high chance of Special drops, and other strong attacks such as STAB Thunderbolt from Zapdos or STAB Blizzard from any of the Ice-types in the tier can also ensure Snorlax is punished for its Rest turns. Nevertheless, Snorlax is one of the biggest offensive threats and one of the hardest Pokemon to KO at the same time, and its set can be tailored to cover any desirable match ups effectively, which means it's usually hard to find reasons not to run Snorlax on your team.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Snorlax can drop Body Slam entirely to run an Ice Beam / Reflect / Amnesia / Rest set that simply aims to soak up damage and spam Ice Beam until it manages to freeze a foe, but it generally needs to be on very specific types of teams to function, is completely helpless against Ice-types, and needs some luck to break through paralyzed Starmie and Chansey, as Ice Beam's limited PP means so Snorlax cannot fish for consecutive paralysis for long.</p> <p>Surf is the best option available to Snorlax to hit Rhydon and Golem, but given that most Snorlax sets run either Reflect or an Ice-type attack, if not both, the situations where Surf is useful are rare.</p> <p>Harden is sometimes preferred over Reflect for the higher PP count and ability to reapply the Speed drop on paralyzed foes, but it is considerably weaker at answering physical attackers, which is usually the primary duty of Reflect Snorlax.</p> <p>Another unusual set is Body Slam / Amnesia / Thunderbolt / Self-Destruct or Rest: given that Starmie and Cloyster are common switch-ins once Amnesia is revealed and that Thunderbolt is a very, very uncommon attack on Snorlax, this set can attempt to lure them in and cripple them with a strong super-effective attack. Self-Destruct is preferred in the final slot as an emergency option that allows Snorlax to bail out of unsuccessful lure attempts with an even trade, but it is possible to use Rest instead in an attempt to preserve Snorlax as a long-term defensive answer. On this set, it is also possible to use Blizzard instead of Body Slam to avoid being completely walled by Rhydon, though it makes Snorlax much weaker against Chansey and Alakazam, so it is usually not preferred.</p> <p>Body Slam / Reflect / Rest sets can afford a few more options in the fourth moveslot. Toxic can allow partial trappers such as Cloyster, Moltres, Victreebel, and Dragonite to be significantly more dangerous, as any poisoned Pokemon attempting to stall out their PP will run out of HP much more quickly, and Snorlax is particularly good at luring in optimal Toxic targets such as Reflect Chansey. Another move that can fill that slot is Amnesia, making Snorlax incredibly difficult to threaten via special attacks alone but ultimately leaving it relatively powerless, with Body Slam as its only attack. Counter is also viable, as after Reflect has been revealed, opponents will most likely stop playing around Counter, giving you some opportunities to net surprise KOs with it.</p> <p>Other Normal-type attacks such as Mega Kick and Double-Edge are rarely seen due to their drawbacks and overall lack of usefulness when Body Slam is such a reliable move and Hyper Beam is a much stronger one, but the ability to repeatedly hit with a greater Base Power can occasionally come in handy.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Reflect Users: Reflect users, particularly Chansey and opposing Snorlax, can switch in on Body Slam and neutralize the damage output from Snorlax fairly efficiently. They are by far the most reliable defensive answers to Snorlax, and a vast majority of RBY teams are forced to include one of the two, if not both, to check it.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar deserves a special mention due to its unique Ghost typing, which allows it to wall all Snorlax sets that lack Earthquake and use Snorlax as an opportunity to threaten either status with Hypnosis or damage with Thunderbolt. It is especially useful against Snorlax sets that only run Normal-type attacks, but it also performs well against any set that lacks Earthquake or Amnesia (unless Snorlax gets a lucky freeze with Ice Beam).</p> <p><strong>Cloyster and Slowbro</strong>: Cloyster and Slowbro are the next best options to switch into Body Slam. Their high defensive stats allow them to come out of the one-on-one matchup on top, but their reliance on Rest to stay healthy and failure to pose a significant immediate threat mean they aren't always the most reliable answers to Snorlax. Slowbro is especially notable, as it can use a sleeping Snorlax as a golden opportunity to set up Amnesia; however, Cloyster has better physical bulk, allowing it to avoid a 4HKO from Body Slam, as well as the ability to use Explosion in case things start to go wrong after paralysis from Body Slam.</p> <p><strong>Other Special Attackers</strong>: Although there aren't many special attackers that enjoy taking a Body Slam to the face, many of them are powerful enough to 3HKO Snorlax, which means they can exert a lot of pressure over it, especially when it's forced to use Rest and sit still for a few turns. Starmie, Lapras, Exeggutor, and Zapdos are some good examples of Pokemon that can force Snorlax out with their strong STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Porygon: Although Porygon's base stats are pitiful, it has access to a very specific set of qualities that make it just good enough to handle Snorlax: it is faster, it is immune to Body Slam's paralysis due to its typing, and Recover's 32 PP allow it to outstall Body Slam's 24 PP. Snorlax's only hopes of breaking down Porygon usually rest on the possibility of landing either a critical hit with Body Slam or a freeze with Ice Beam; however, Porygon is very weak, and it is incredibly easy for the Snorlax player to simply switch out.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types Carrying Rest</strong>: Another very specific countermeasure, Rock-types carrying Rest are generally able to outstall any Snorlax variant that isn't carrying the specific coverage for them. As long as the Rock-type has Rest to stall out repeated Body Slams, there are quite a few of them that can win the one-on-one matchup: non-Earthquake Snorlax will be unable to break through Omastar and Kabutops, non-Ice Beam Snorlax will struggle to wear down Aerodactyl, and even Rhydon can beat a Snorlax in the long run if Snorlax is only carrying Normal-type moves.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Snorlax's Body Slam is one of the most difficult attacks to switch into in the tier due to its sheer power, its paralysis chance, and the relative lack of Normal-type switch-ins in the tier. Reflect allows Snorlax to take on physical attackers, most importantly opposing Snorlax, much more comfortably. Rest gives Snorlax the ability to remain healthy throughout the game. A lot of moves can fit in the last moveslot. The most common one is Ice Beam, as it allows Snorlax to potentially freeze opposing Reflect users, which can otherwise neutralize its Body Slam; however, this leaves Snorlax unable to threaten large amounts of damage in one turn, which means its matchup against many important Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Zapdos, Cloyster, and Lapras goes from bad to worse, and even its ability to power through a paralyzed Starmie or Chansey goes down significantly. Self-Destruct allows Snorlax to function as a wallbreaker if needed, as well as a defensive piece thanks to Reflect and Rest if preferred, while Hyper Beam provides some of Self-Destruct's wallbreaking power without you having to sacrifice your Snorlax for it; however, a Snorlax that is only carrying Normal-type attacks will struggle against Rock-types and will be entirely unable to damage Ghost-types. Lastly, although Earthquake doesn't provide the freeze threat of Ice Beam or the immediate power of the other moves, it allows Snorlax to beat Gengar and Counter Chansey, two Pokemon that, albeit rare, are usually specifically devised to beat it.</p> <p>Using Reflect Snorlax is particularly nuanced due to having to balance Snorlax as both an offensive and defensive tool. If used too aggressively, it might take a KO but subsequently struggle to find turns to heal back up with Rest, making it a trade that is not always worth taking. On the other hand, if used too passively, it will invite too much offensive pressure and eventually collapse without achieving much of anything. Optimal usage of Reflect Snorlax requires careful analysis of the game state as well as appropriate prediction, but when properly managed, it is incredibly potent, as the special attackers that can threaten it lack either recovery or physical bulk, meaning that teams will generally resort to various stalling tactics to force Snorlax to use Rest first and then pressure it during its sleep turns. Reflect Snorlax is at its best early-game when the opponent has one or more paralyzed Pokemon to take advantage of, most commonly Alakazam and Chansey, and when its teammates can offer the necessary defensive cover against special attackers, but it is no slouch late-game either, as it can trade one-for-one with most Pokemon and has an important positive matchup against Tauros.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This moveset is fairly straightforward: maximize offensive prowess to wallbreak as well as possible. Body Slam is the go-to attack to inflict damage, and combined with Hyper Beam, it makes Snorlax particularly dangerous and hard to switch into, especially for paralyzed foes. Self-Destruct is an incredibly potent move to take down an extra Pokemon with Snorlax's last breath or even to take opposing Pokemon by surprise earlier on if the situation calls for it. The last moveslot is a toss-up: Earthquake allows Snorlax to play around Counter Chansey much more comfortably, as well as hitting Gengar and threatening Rhydon, but it can be dropped in favor of Counter, a tool that allows this Snorlax set to muscle through an opponent's Reflect Snorlax with correct prediction. Counter may also be used in conjunction with Earthquake and in place of Hyper Beam; the lack of Hyper Beam is quite noticeable, as it makes Snorlax much less threatening as a wallbreaker, but Earthquake offers unique coverage that could be worth keeping for specific matchups.</p> <p>The absence of recovery on this Snorlax set makes it far riskier to utilize, as it can only take a few hits before being forced to use Self-Destruct. Therefore, this Snorlax set needs to be considered as a tool to accelerate the game and little else, as its defensive capabilities are very limited. This often just means using an early-game Self-Destruct on the opponent's Reflect user to remove them from the situation before they get a chance to set up Reflect. It must be noted that this is a one-for-one trade, which is not always advantageous, but it is often the best that can be achieved with this set, as it is often endlessly walled by Reflect users otherwise; recognizing when to be greedy and when to accept a simple Self-Destruct trade is key to achieving good results with this Snorlax set.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Body Slam is the main attack to create pressure on the opposition and hopefully bait in Reflect Snorlax, which this set can take advantage of thanks to the combination of Amnesia and Blizzard. The last move defines the type of game you want to play with this set: Self-Destruct means hard and fast wallbreaking, as Snorlax simply doesn't have the durability to set up Amnesia multiple times throughout the game, while Rest gives Snorlax those opportunities to set up but leaves it notably vulnerable to Tauros. Ice Beam is an option over Blizzard for the higher PP, which is especially relevant on Rest sets, but Blizzard's considerably greater damage output is generally preferred.</p> <p>This set is quite dangerous to play against due to how difficult it is to answer if your Chansey is paralyzed. Nearly every other common Pokemon is threatened by either Body Slam or a boosted Blizzard, with Water-types like Starmie and Lapras being the best answers defensively but struggling to deal significant damage in return thanks to the Special boost. However, a healthy Chansey usually has no issues switching in and walling this Snorlax variant until it's forced to use Rest, which, in turn, leaves it vulnerable against Tauros. The conditions for this set to excel are difficult to set up, but when they are achieved, this Snorlax set can decide games on its own.</p> "

  "Articuno": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>NOTE - The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. Articuno is generally considered less viable in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <h1>Overview</h1> <p>With an incredible Special stat, the strongest unboosted special attack in the generation, and access to Agility, it's easy to see why Articuno is one of the most dangerous sweepers in RBY UU. The raw power of Articuno's Blizzard is enough to 2HKO nearly two-thirds of the metagame, frequently 2HKOing specially bulky Pokemon like Kadabra and Haunter and always 2HKOing offensive titans like Kangaskhan and Persian; for many Pokemon, just switching into Articuno and surviving is a herculean task. Articuno's incredible bulk also surpasses that of many tier staples, like Tentacruel, Hypno, Kangaskhan, and Tangela. It is only surpassed in physical bulk by Omastar and Golem, and in special bulk by Vaporeon. This fantastic bulk allows Articuno to set up against many targets without fear of being taken out quickly, as well as making it even harder to stop once it begins sweeping. It can also check physical attackers such as Persian, Dodrio, Kangaskhan, and Dugtrio, a trait appreciated by many teams.</p> <p>However, Articuno's Blizzard is a significant reason why bulky Water-types like Tentacruel and Vaporeon are so dominant, as they can shrug off the hit with relative ease; Articuno must rely on its mediocre physical movepool to break past them. Articuno's middling Speed tier is another notable weakness, as being slower than Tentacruel makes it vulnerable to Wrap and leaves it open to being revenge killed by Dugtrio, Persian, and Kangaskhan, unless it finds an opportunity to use Agility. Nonetheless, Articuno's raw power makes it a staple pick on many successful offensive teams.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>On the vast majority of teams, Articuno is best off using its standard set; however, it does have some options which can prove useful. Ice Beam can be used over Double-Edge, giving Articuno another Ice-type attack with better accuracy and more PP than Blizzard to pick off targets such as Dugtrio without worrying about Blizzard's accuracy. Ice Beam also improves Articuno's ability to fish for a freeze as a desperation play. However, Double-Edge is preferred due to its better damage output against Water-types. Rest enables it to consistently take hits and pressure the opponent throughout the game, but it is hard to justify using Rest over Articuno's other moves, as this severely cuts into its sweeping prowess. In a similar vein, Articuno can run Reflect to bolster its defensive prowess, but justifying it over other moves is difficult. Also, critical hits ignore Reflect’s Defense boost, rendering it completely useless against Pokemon with Slash such as Persian.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Many bulky Water-types in RBY UU can switch into Articuno's Blizzard and defeat it. Tentacruel is the most common and can wear it down with Wrap while keeping it from attacking. Worse still, it can use Rest to heal off any damage it may take. However, if Tentacruel takes some chip damage beforehand and Articuno uses Agility on the switch, then Tentacruel becomes a far worse check, as Articuno only needs one Double-Edge critical hit to bring it into Hyper Beam KO range. Vaporeon is another strong answer to Articuno, taking very little damage from Blizzard or Double-Edge while threatening reasonable damage in return with Surf and healing off the damage it does take with Rest. Dewgong and Omastar in particular are hard walls for Articuno, as both take very little damage from Double-Edge or Blizzard and can use Rest if they are at low health. Outside of a timely freeze against Omastar, Articuno needs two consecutive critical hits with Double-Edge or Blizzard against Dewgong and Omastar, respectively, to subsequently break through them on its own. Poliwrath can take a couple of Blizzards before going down, but it is unable to threaten Articuno outside of Hypnosis or Body Slam paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Hypno and Kadabra: While Hypno and Kadabra are by no means reliable answers or even good switch-ins to Articuno, they can act as soft checks in some scenarios. If Hypno is at full health and not asleep, it can take two Blizzards while paralyzing Articuno in return and potentially doing some damage with Psychic or burning limited Blizzard PP with Rest. Kadabra can also take a Blizzard or Double-Edge from full health, and paralyze Articuno in return, before healing off any damage it takes with Recover and praying for full paralysis. However, Articuno can use Agility to remove the Speed drop and then fish for a Double-Edge or Blizzard critical hit fairly safely, finishing Kadabra off with Hyper Beam once it does land the critical hit. Still, though, Double-Edge's recoil damage can add up over repeated uses, and repeated Recovers can stall out Blizzard’s low PP.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Dugtrio, Persian, Electabuzz, and Raichu can all threaten to KO Articuno if it has taken chip damage and has not yet used Agility. However, none of these Pokemon can switch into Articuno's Blizzard without suffering severe damage, if not being KOed outright.</p> <p><strong>Rock Slide Users: Golem, Kangaskhan, and Dugtrio can deal significant damage to Articuno due to its severe Rock weakness. Golem and Dugtrio are OHKOed by Blizzard, which limits them to hitting Articuno as it switches in or revenge killing a weakened Articuno, especially in the case of Dugtrio. If Kangaskhan chooses to run Rock Slide, it becomes a true Articuno check, because it outspeeds and 2HKOes Articuno with Rock Slide while surviving its Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: While Agility does let it ignore the Speed drop, Articuno doesn't handle paralysis all that gracefully, considering its two best moves only have 89.45% accuracy. This means a paralyzed Articuno is dealing damage a mere 67.09% of the time. Paralysis also makes less consistent checks, like Tentacruel, significantly more reliable.</p> ",
      "sets": [
        {
          "name": "Agility Sweeper",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Articuno's Blizzard is the strongest special attack in the generation and its primary attacking move, capable of KOing most Pokemon in only two or three hits. Double-Edge and Hyper Beam help Articuno combat Water-types and Kadabra attempting to stop it from running over teams, with Double-Edge having additional utility as a finishing move with better accuracy and more PP than Blizzard or Hyper Beam. Agility lets Articuno outspeed the unboosted metagame, making it harder to pin down with Wrap and allowing it to bypass the Speed drop from paralysis.</p> <p>Articuno usually operates in one of two distinct ways: as a late-game sweeper or as a tank. In the former role, Articuno generally stays in the back for most of the game, waiting for its answers to either be KOed or weakened to the point where they cannot contest its sweep, from there it begins to look for opportunities to come onto the field and use Agility. From there, the game is usually over, as Articuno will be able to summarily mop up the opposition, barring a couple of untimely Blizzard misses. The biggest obstacles to Articuno's sweeping are Tentacruel, Omastar, Vaporeon, and Dewgong, and it usually falls on Articuno's teammates to remove these Pokemon. However, Articuno can help in this process by coming onto the field safely, such as by double switching into a target that can be OHKOed by Blizzard like Dragonite or Dugtrio, and then attacking the predicted Water-type switch-in. This can be especially effective against a chipped Vaporeon or Dewgong, since a Double-Edge followed by a Hyper Beam will KO both of them from half health as they switch into Articuno to stop an Agility sweep. The other obstacle Articuno faces when operating as a sweeper is finding a turn to safely use Agility. Some examples of good opportunities for Articuno to come onto the field are sleeping targets, attacks it takes easily like Venusaur's Razor Leaf and Dugtrio's Earthquake, and predicted switches to a Normal-type attacker such as Kangaskhan, Persian, or Dodrio. Opponents are likely to play more cautiously with their Articuno checks if it is revealed, so they may be easier to remove if Articuno is revealed only once it is prepared to sweep.</p> <p>On the other hand, Articuno can perform the role of a tank admirably. With its incredible natural bulk and nuclear damage output, Articuno can aid its teammates by taking on some of the most dangerous physical attackers in the tier. From full health, Articuno can switch into and usually KO Kangaskhan and Dodrio. It can also beat Persian, Gyarados, and Dugtrio in a one-on-one matchup if it is reasonably healthy, barring critical hits. In general, Articuno can handle Normal-type attackers that otherwise greatly pressure frailer offensive teams. Furthermore, because of how strong Articuno's Blizzard is, it can help break past defensive Pokemon such as Hypno using Rest, Venusaur, and Tangela to enable teammates like Dugtrio, Persian, Electabuzz, and Kadabra. This way of using Articuno primarily works when facing offense structures that do not run multiple Water-types, as they often lack a good answer to a well-played Articuno outside of their Tentacruel.</p> <p>As mentioned before, Articuno despises bulky Water-types and thus appreciates teammates that can deal with them. Persian, Kangaskhan, Gyarados, and Dugtrio are fantastic Articuno partners, breaking through Articuno checks such as Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar. They can also weaken any other potential roadblocks to Articuno's sweep. In return, they appreciate Articuno's ability to deal with their common answers such as Kangaskhan, Tangela, Dragonite, opposing Dugtrio, and Aerodactyl. Electric-type Pokemon such as Electabuzz and Raichu can aid Articuno in breaking through Water-types as well, given their STAB Thunderbolts and high Speed stats. They can also spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, which Articuno appreciates. In return, Articuno helps answer checks to Electric-types such as Dugtrio, Venusaur, and Tangela. Sleepers such as Tangela, Venusaur, and Haunter let Articuno easily set up or start dealing damage when facing a sleeping foe. In addition, their super effective Grass- and Electric-type attacks can help break through the pesky Water-types that Articuno hates. In return, Articuno helps deal with some of their common checks, such as Flying- and Grass-types—especially Dragonite and Dodrio—in the case of Venusaur and Tangela, and Dugtrio in the case of Haunter—albeit to a lesser extent because of Dugtrio's Rock Slide. Venusaur and Tangela come with the added benefit of checking Dugtrio and Electric-types, which can revenge kill or paralyze Articuno. This lets Articuno focus on dealing with other threats and avoid the risk of Dugtrio landing a critical hit with its Rock Slide. Lastly, Water-type Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Vaporeon can be valuable Articuno partners, as their defensive utility helps keep Articuno from overextending and lets it opt out of playing the mirror match.</p> "

Articuno specializes in tearing huge holes in opposing teams, achieving things like 3HKOs on Mew and Snorlax, 2HKOs on Tauros, Exeggutor, and Zapdos, and clean OHKOs on Rhydon and Golem. Blizzard is very easy to spam, as even resistant Pokemon usually take noticeable damage. The move also comes with a nice chance to freeze and disable a foe for the rest of the game. Articuno also is decently bulky and can take a few strong attacks. For example, Tauros's Body Slam usually takes less than a quarter of its health, assuming it does not get a critical hit.</p> <p>However, Articuno's movepool is abysmal, with almost exclusively Ice- and Normal-type moves to choose from. The latter come off of its mediocre Attack stat, leaving it unable to deal with certain bulky Pokemon like Cloyster and Starmie. Articuno is also rather slow, requiring paralysis support or an Agility in order to function effectively against faster Pokemon. Articuno's low Speed also prevents it from functioning as a good lead, as it is outsped by common leads like Gengar, Jynx, and Starmie. These weaknesses can make Articuno hard to fit on teams at times. Still, Articuno's devastating Blizzard will reward you handsomely for the compensation it needs.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Articuno’s barren movepool leaves it with very few other options to choose from. Sky Attack is a decent option, being Articuno’s only Flying-type STAB move and very powerful in its own right. It can be used over Articuno’s Normal-type coverage, dealing huge damage to Chansey and more damage to Mewtwo. However, its two-turn nature makes it less reliable and harder to use than other moves, and Blizzard does more damage to Mewtwo over two turns. Another option is Ice Beam to save precious Blizzard PP in certain situations. Alongside Rest, it can be used to fish for a freeze, with about an 85% chance to get one with all of its PP used. However, Ice Beam Articuno is completely walled by Jynx and Chansey, since it must drop its Normal-type coverage.</p> <p>Articuno can also utilize Reflect, alongside Rest, to become a good tank that easily staves off hits from Tauros, Mew, and Snorlax. Reflect Articuno's main goal is to freeze a foe, so it should run Ice Beam to maximize that chance. If Articuno uses Reflect, it will likely forgo Agility. This means that, while not completely ruined by paralysis, Reflect Articuno is threatened more by it, since it is forced to use Rest and switch out to negate the Speed drop.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ice-resistant Pokemon: Cloyster completely walls Articuno, since it is 4x resistant to Ice, can't be frozen, and has huge Defense to make Hyper Beam deal next to no damage. Similarly, Lapras takes almost zero damage from Blizzard, can't be frozen, and threatens Articuno with Thunderbolt; however, it must watch out for Hyper Beam if it's at low health. Slowbro can easily set up Amnesia on Articuno but fears a stray freeze or critical hits from Blizzard. Starmie can hit Articuno hard with Thunderbolt and heal from Blizzard damage with Recover, but it too must be wary of a freeze.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: While Chansey must be somewhat healthy to switch in on Articuno carrying Hyper Beam, it takes relatively little damage from Blizzard and can scare Articuno away with Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave + Seismic Toss. However, Chansey must be cautious to not be frozen in the process. Although rare, Articuno can use Sky Attack on a predicted switch to do massive damage the next turn; however, Chansey will likely just heal the damage off.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Zapdos</strong>: Jolteon outspeeds Articuno and will almost always 2HKO with Thunderbolt. Articuno also barely misses the 2HKO with Blizzard, meaning it needs a critical hit or a freeze to win one-on-one. Zapdos, albeit weak to Ice, outspeeds Articuno and threatens to 2HKO it with Thunderbolt while narrowly surviving one Blizzard. Jolteon and Zapdos can also paralyze an Agility-boosted Articuno with Thunder Wave to negate its Speed boost.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: None of Articuno’s attacks hit Mewtwo very hard after it has used Amnesia, except a critical hit Blizzard, and Mewtwo has Recover to heal off any damage it does take. Even unorthodox Mewtwo sets can take at least two Blizzards, allowing Mewtwo to use Thunder Wave on Articuno followed by heavy-hitting moves like Psychic, Thunderbolt, and Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: Mew, Gengar, and Snorlax, among others, can finish off a weakened Articuno with their powerful Explosions even after Articuno has set up with Agility. However, an Articuno using Reflect does not fear them.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Blizzard will hit most everything harder than any other move in the game can, so Articuno will use it the most by far. Hyper Beam gives Articuno better odds to defeat Chansey, as Blizzard + Hyper Beam deals a minimum of 59% of damage to it, while also dealing massive damage to Jynx. Double-Edge can be used if Articuno wants to avoid Hyper Beam recharge mind games, but the recoil damage can easily put it into KO range of other threats. Rest allows Articuno to stick around for much longer and fire off more Blizzards. Agility lets Articuno outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and ignore the Speed drop from paralysis. It also makes Articuno less reliant on team paralysis support.</p> <p>Articuno is best used early-game to rip holes into the opposing team with the sheer power of Blizzard, as even Water-types are afraid of switching into Blizzard because of its freeze chance. Switch Articuno in against weaker attacks, such as Chansey's attacks bar Thunderbolt, or on a predicted Earthquake from opposing Mew, Snorlax, or Tauros. It can also switch in against Earthquake from Rhydon or Golem, but it must be very careful, as Rock Slide from either can OHKO Articuno. However, if it manages to come in on their Earthquakes, Articuno will either OHKO them or force them out and do massive damage to something else. Articuno can also be used to absorb paralysis, since it can use Rest later to heal itself or use Agility to negate the Speed drop. Once Articuno is on the field, it should use Blizzard as often as it can and do as much damage to opposing teams as possible.</p> <p>Articuno greatly appreciates paralysis support from teammates such as Exeggutor, Mew, and Zapdos. This allows it to be less reliant on Agility, letting it start doing damage faster and more consistently. However, one must be careful when using Thunder Wave, as a Water-type switching into it becomes immune to freeze, meaning Articuno cannot threaten it at all. Tauros can capitalize on holes Articuno makes in the opponent’s team while supporting it by dealing with opposing Chansey, Starmie, and Jynx. It can also spread paralysis with Body Slam to assist Articuno. Articuno appreciates teammates that can deal with Slowbro, which it is helpless against most of the time. Zapdos, Jolteon, and Thunderbolt Mewtwo can use critical Thunderbolts to bypass Amnesia boosts and do huge damage to Slowbro, while Cloyster, Starmie, Lapras, and Light Screen Chansey wall Slowbro even after it has gained boosts. Light Screen Chansey can also check Amnesia Mewtwo, which Articuno struggles to damage after it has set up. Teams with Articuno tend to be weak to Electric-types, so a check to them like Rhydon, Golem, or Jolteon is appreciated.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Boasting one of the highest Special stats in the game along with the most powerful special move in OU, Blizzard, there's no denying that Articuno is a powerhouse. OHKOing Golem and Rhydon and 2HKOing Exeggutor are feats few Pokemon can muster, but Blizzard allows Articuno to do just that. It can force switches and deal heavy damage throughout the match, softening up your opponent's team and possibly causing a freeze. It can even make for a very nice end-game sweeper by boosting its mediocre base 85 Speed with Agility and blasting away with its STAB Blizzard, potentially getting a freeze in the process.</p> <p>Why isn't Articuno more common, then? Again, its Speed stat is frustratingly low, as it is not able to outspeed Pokemon like Tauros and Alakazam without a boost, while both are capable of paralyzing Articuno. It is walled to kingdom come by the many OU Pokemon that resist Blizzard, namely Lapras, Starmie, Cloyster, and to an extent, Slowbro, as well as Chansey with its massive 250/105 Special bulk. Its movepool is shallow as well, as it leaves Articuno relying on mediocre Ice / Normal coverage, the latter of which runs off its so-so Attack stat. Other Ice-types such as Lapras and Cloyster are generally preferred, due to access to helpful moves such as Thunderbolt and Explosion respectively. However, they can never dream of matching the raw power of Articuno's Blizzard. All-in-all, if you are looking to unleash a nasty surprise on your opponent, don't overlook Articuno.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With Articuno's barren yet focused movepool, there are very few other options it can run. Mimic is probably the best unlisted option, as if Articuno gets lucky enough to copy Thunderbolt from Starmie, it will always 2HKO back. Reflect is another option to help Articuno absorb Body Slam from Snorlax and even Rock Slide from Golem and Rhydon should it find itself paralyzed against them. It also helps Articuno win against Tauros, which needs Body Slam critical hits to win. However, it is typically only useful when your opponent's special walls are gone, as they don't care at all whether Reflect is up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Although Articuno's Blizzard is a frosty nuke and no Pokemon enjoys a freeze, there are quite a few solid counters to it. Lapras and Cloyster are some of the best Articuno counters, as they 4x resist Blizzard and can wear it down with any of their attacks. Starmie has to worry about the freeze chance, but can otherwise shrug off all of Articuno's attacks with Recover and threaten it back with any attack of its choosing. Cloyster also 4x resists Blizzard and has a ton of physical bulk, allowing it to absorb any physical attacks that Articuno might be running, then threaten either Articuno or a switch-in with Clamp, Blizzard, or Explosion. Slowbro is also a decent Pokemon to send out against Articuno one-on-one because it can paralyze it with Thunder Wave, but switching in is not recommended because it takes about 50% from two Blizzards before it even has a chance to move.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Chansey is as good a special wall as ever, shrugging off attacks with Soft-Boiled and firing back with Thunderbolt or Seismic Toss. It also takes 37.9 - 44.6% from Hyper Beam, so it has little hope in getting the chance to use Soft-Boiled if its health is low. Alakazam can also use Thunder Wave, Recover off any damage, and spam Psychic until Articuno eventually faints, but it is 3HKOed by Blizzard, meaning it needs to be weary of switching in if paralyzed or weakened.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Though they are far from solid defensive checks to Articuno, Zapdos and Jolteon naturally outspeed it and can 2HKO it with Thunderbolt, which makes them effective offensive options to take it down if no more defensive options are available.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>The best way to get Articuno on the field is to switch it in when you predict that your opponent will switch in Exeggutor; if it has lost over 33% of its health already, Blizzard is a guaranteed KO. It can also switch in on a predicted Earthquake from Snorlax or Tauros, dealing heavy damage with Blizzard and hopefully causing a freeze. Rhydon and Golem are a bit harder to switch in on, as Rock Slide will KO Articuno, but if you are fortunate enough to switch in on Earthquake, Blizzard will OHKO either. Double-Edge does chip damage to Lapras, who laughs at a 4x resisted Blizzard, as well as Starmie. Don't use Double-Edge against Chansey though, as it only does 5% more than Blizzard, causes recoil, and does not have a freeze chance. Don't use Agility until the late-game, when the remains of your opponent's team are within KO range. Finally, Hyper Beam is there to finish off weakened Chansey and Alakazam.</p> <p>Ice Beam is a viable alternative over Double-Edge for a 99.6% accurate STAB, but it is significantly weaker than Blizzard and further weakens Articuno against Lapras and Starmie. Rest is great for recovering from status, allowing Articuno to act as a status sponge throughout the battle until you need it again. Another interesting option Articuno has is Sky Attack, which is its most powerful physical attack, possessing a huge 210 Base Power after STAB. With a critical hit, it is guaranteed to OHKO Chansey and has a 52% chance to OHKO Starmie; without a critical hit, it has a 46% chance to OHKO Alakazam, who would normally be 3HKOed by Blizzard. However, it forces you to lose an entire turn and is difficult to find a slot for.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Articuno possesses the most powerful unboosted special attack in the game in its Blizzard, giving it offensive prowess rivaled only by the less consistent Moltres. This alone grants Articuno a strong niche in the tier, outspeeding and 2HKOing the mighty Exeggutor. This offense is backed by a reasonable 15% critical hit rate, with critical hit Blizzard OHKOing even Tauros. With Agility, Articuno can function as a late-game sweeper that is very difficult to stop when the stage is set. This is because it isn't just a strong offensive threat: it's also quite bulky, winning against Tauros one-on-one, or even Zapdos if at +2 Speed. Because of the increased presence of Rest Exeggutor, there are many opportunities for Articuno to switch in and turn the game on its head with nuclear damage output.</p> <p>However, Articuno has some deep pitfalls that make it difficult to use in Stadium OU. Team Preview is a massive hit to its viability, removing all surprise factor that helps set up for a sweep in cartridge play. Articuno only has Normal-type coverage and a poor Attack stat to use it with, so Pokemon like Chansey and Starmie, as well as the rarer Lapras and Cloyster, tend to wall it out. Additionally, its valuable Speed, while high relative to OU, means paralysis inducers force it out, which is worsened by Agility not negating the paralysis Speed drop, unlike standard play. It can use Rest to get rid of it, but this isn't ideal. Due to these flaws, Articuno can be seen as very linear, but its immense power is nothing to sneeze at.</p> ",

The freeze chance also cannot be ignored, giving Articuno a degree of volatility that means even consistent checks like Chansey aren't safe. Double-Edge allows Articuno to consistently pressure Substitute without losing valuable PP against users such as Chansey and Alakazam. It also pressures Blizzard-resistant Pokemon like Starmie and Lapras. Rest is crucial for allowing Articuno to make use of its bulk, giving it staying power against Snorlax and Tauros while removing the Speed drop from paralysis.</p> <p>The third moveslot defines how Articuno will act for its team. Ice Beam acts as a weaker alternative to Blizzard with more PP while still finishing off Exeggutor, ensuring a sustained assault; it can also let Articuno fish for a freeze against big targets like Chansey. Reflect is a viable third option for a bulky approach, stonewalling Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros without much effort; they require two critical hit Body Slams to stop it from repeatedly using Rest if Reflect is active. Reflect doesn't protect Articuno from Persian, though, and it's threatened with a 3HKO from Slash. Agility lets Articuno take a late-game sweeping approach, which, combined with Rest, can be difficult for weakened teams to stop.</p> <p>Articuno cannot break through bulky Water-types, so it's best to cut your losses and have its teammates deal with them. Articuno is often used alongside Thunderbolt Chansey, Zapdos, or Jolteon, forming a two-pronged special offense that can be difficult for teams to counter; Jolteon also appreciates Articuno's Ground immunity. Additionally, Pokemon like Tauros and the ubiquitous Snorlax, which can muscle past physically frail Pokemon like Alakazam, are also of great assistance; Self-Destruct Snorlax also tends to help against Pokemon like Slowbro. Rhydon warrants consideration for reducing the holes opened up by Articuno's weaknesses to Electric and Rock. Gengar shuts down Persian offensively, has good Speed, and has access to Thunderbolt, all of which highly benefit Articuno; Gengar's Explosion also puts Chansey in KO range for Articuno's Double-Edge. Articuno functions best late-game when its bulky Water-type checks have been removed, though Team Preview often makes the opponent less inclined to use them, which frequently means aggressive double switching is necessary to force them in earlier than usual. Articuno can function as a mid-game tank if the opponent lacks a good check. If using Agility and intending to sweep, it's best to bring Articuno in upon a forced Rest from Pokemon like Exeggutor, letting it set up and attempt to muscle past. Articuno can arguably run Hyper Beam alongside Double-Edge despite the drawbacks, namely to finish off Starmie and Chansey from a minimum of 33.4% and 37.9%, respectively. However, it is somewhat difficult to fit into its moveset and comes at severe opportunity cost outside of these matchups.</p> "

While they do take slight chip damage from Drill Peck, they can't be hit by any of Zapdos's other moves and must be dealt with by the rest of the team. Due to this, Zapdos generally requires minor support to work effectively in all matchups, keeping it from being considered one of the best Pokemon in the metagame.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rest is an option for Zapdos to get some HP back, but you'll rarely ever get the chance to use it. Generally, Zapdos should be attacking or use Thunder Wave anyway; there's not a lot of room to put it on the set, as you lose out on either a pivotal attack, the ability to consistently paralyze opposing Pokemon, or the ability to pull off a late-game sweep. Thunder is usable to OHKO Starmie and to 2HKO Tauros and Slowbro, but it is not as used due to its poor accuracy. Toxic is a nice option in order to pressure the Rock-types, but this is generally not worth using over other moves. Final options for Zapdos are Reflect and Light Screen. Generally you would choose one over the other and replace Agility. Having Reflect or Light Screen up mid-game can be incredibly useful; however, due to Zapdos's lack of recovery without Rest, which is already noted to be unreliable, this option is generally not favored. The combination of Rest and Reflect can also be good at letting Zapdos check the Rock-type Pokemon that it usually loses to, but it risks taking a potential critical hit from Rock Slide.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: The Ground-types of the metagame, Rhydon and Golem, are Zapdos's biggest threats to deal with. They soak up any attack Zapdos has to offer, which forces you to play around them before Zapdos can be effective. One can scout early-game for these Pokemon, but if you spend the whole game trying to play around them, you may find yourself in a pickle by late-game.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types like Jolteon can also make good checks to Zapdos, although unlike the above Ground-types, they are susceptible to Thunder Wave. Jolteon would preferably use Rest to better check Zapdos, but ones without Rest work as well. Zapdos itself gets a special mention because it can come in on a Drill Peck to create an even matchup. Despite this, it is still worse than Jolteon as a check, as it is neutral to Thunderbolt damage which should be noted is unable to paralyze Electric-types making it a bit harder for Zapdos to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey can act as a good check to Zapdos thanks to its high Special Defense and access to Reflect, but it is generally unfavorable as a check due to the tendency of Drill Peck landing a critical hit.</p> ",

Zapdos hits most targets for strong damage, comfortably 3HKOing Tauros and threatening 3HKOs on Snorlax and Alakazam. However, it should be noted that Thunderbolt cannot paralyze other Electric-types. Drill Peck hits two of the main Pokemon that tank Thunderbolt, Exeggutor and Chansey. Exeggutor is sometimes 2HKOed by Drill Peck, and while Chansey can take two Drill Pecks comfortably, it tends to lose to repeated Drill Pecks, as it can't hit Zapdos very hard, and a single critical hit or full paralysis tends to end the fight in Zapdos's favor. However, Chansey does have access to Reflect to increase its chances of winning the matchup. Thunder Wave is used to paralyze Pokemon such as Tauros and Chansey to give openings for Zapdos to sweep late-game or get a chance to prevent recovery to get an extra turn of damage. Agility can be used on a free turn to allow Zapdos to outspeed faster threats like Alakazam and Tauros. It can also be used to remove the Speed drop from paralysis, which can allow Zapdos to sweep through Pokemon that would otherwise revenge kill it.</p> <p>In general, you want to keep Zapdos as healthy as possible throughout the match in order to give it sweeping potential. However, this doesn't mean that you should keep it in the back the whole game, as it has a lot of potential to be useful in the early- and mid-game stages. For example, Zapdos can take advantage of sleeping Pokemon such as Snorlax as long as it comes in on the turn the Pokemon uses Rest. One should try to use Zapdos to spread status through Thunder Wave. This is especially helpful to do on a Pokemon like Chansey, which can be prevented from recovering through status, allowing Zapdos to potentially 3HKO with Drill Peck. Early-game, be sure to scout for the Ground-types of the tier, Rhydon and Golem. Do this with Pokemon like Exeggutor, Tauros, Cloyster, and Lapras, which can pressure them through super effective or status moves. Tauros is probably the best example there, as it has a great matchup versus Exeggutor, Snorlax, Chansey, and Tauros, as well as being a great late-game cleaner on top of that. You could also lure them out with Zapdos itself, which can be done fairly early on, putting you at an information advantage. Whether or not you manage to find a Rock-type, though, you should keep Rock-type checks like Exeggutor and Lapras healthy so they better check them if they come out later in the match. Don't use Agility unless most Pokemon on the opposing team are weakened enough for Zapdos to sweep. To give a reference frame, you should probably wait until Pokemon like Snorlax and Chansey have about a third of their health left. However, if they Rest, you can take advantage of them earlier.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Moltres is a fearsome threat in RBY NU, with significant bulk, the tier's most powerful special attack in Fire Blast, and a decent Speed tier that ties Mr. Mime, Poliwhirl, and Venomoth. Moltres 2HKOes notable threats such as Mr. Mime and Nidoking, OHKOes Venomoth 74% of the time, and OHKOes Exeggcute, and it deals a significant chunk to most resistant switch-ins such as Golem and Water-types—barring Kabutops—while threatening to burn them. Fire Spin allows Moltres to chip down and pivot around its checks, Hyper Beam finishes off Fire-resistant threats, and various utility moves such as Reflect, Toxic, and Agility enable it to take on different roles, walling certain threats or sweeping late-game. Defensively, it brings Earthquake immunity and enough bulk to avoid a 3HKO from neutral attacks; even Charizard's Slash is a 4HKO, leaving Swords Dance-less sets unable to break Moltres.</p> <p>Despite its legendary status, Moltres suffers from the ubiquity of the pedestrian Fire / Flying type in Charizard, which can set up on standard Moltres freely. It's also hindered by the prevalence of teams stacking Fire- and Water-types, which leave it with few opportunities to truly unleash its Fire Blast. Fire / Flying is a flawed type combination, suffering greatly against Rock Slide and carrying common weakness; even if Moltres often avoids 2HKOs from Blizzard, Thunderbolt, and Surf, it'd rather not be weak to them at all. Fire Blast and Hyper Beam are Moltres's only real, strong attack options; both are just inaccurate enough to make it inconsistent and punishable. Utilizing Moltres means running a second Fire / Flying type alongside Charizard in a metagame full of Water- and Rock-types, and one where super effective moves abound. Despite this, its sheer stat total gives it a place on many teams as a terrifying damage dealer, bulky roadblock, or endgame sweeper.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Moltres generally lacks other move options. Although Fire Blast can't be dropped, one can combine its other moves in varying ways to meet different threats, such as running Hyper Beam on a Rest set. Double-Edge is an option, providing far more PP than Fire Blast or Hyper Beam, but fails to outdamage Fire Blast even on Fire-resistant targets, while Sky Attack's charge time is easy to maneuver around.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Charizard</strong>: Charizard outspeeds Moltres and sets up Swords Dance freely, taking little from Fire Blast or Hyper Beam while 4HKOing with Slash or boosting up and KOing with +6 Hyper Beam. Moltres has counterplay in the form of Toxic + Reflect, which allows it to tank any Charizard set. Toxic whittles Charizard down, but running Toxic sacrifices valuable utility elsewhere and renders Charizard immune to paralysis, allowing it to simply switch out and return later.</p> <p><strong>Kabutops</strong>: Fire Blast might as well be Ember to Kabutops, and it resists Hyper Beam too, rendering Moltres entirely ineffective. It threatens to set up Swords Dance or retaliate with a number of 3HKO options, including Surf, Blizzard, Slash, and Hyper Beam, and it essentially ignores burn. While Moltres outspeeds it and can use Fire Spin to pivot out, a miss will be punished to the tune of 30-40% of Moltres's HP.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: Golem takes Fire Blast easily, only having a 14% chance to be 3HKOed, and threatens to OHKO in return with Rock Slide 92% of the time. However, a burn significantly hampers Golem, so it must carefully consider the risk, especially if other options such as Water-types are available. If Moltres manages to apply burn, it can even freely set up Agility to reapply the burn Attack drop, making Golem's Rock Slide barely 4HKO.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Blastoise takes Fire Blast well; Moltres needs to land three Fire Blasts and Hyper Beam to 4HKO, potentially missing in the process, while Blastoise is able to 3HKO with Surf. Less specially bulky options like Seadra and Kingler can check Moltres in a pinch, being 4HKOed and 3HKOed by Fire Blast while 2HKOing with their STAB options in return. However, they want to come in against a weakened Moltres due to their lower Speed and relative frailty. Poliwhirl takes quite a bit from Fire Blast normally, being 3HKOed like most other Water-types, but threatens the moves Hypnosis and Amnesia; this allows it to barricade Moltres almost as well as Kabutops while threatening significantly more damage in return, dealing minimum 77% with Hydro Pump at +2. Moltres gains little from winning the Speed tie.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: A paralyzed Moltres becomes much easier to handle, outsped by its checks and less likely to land already inconsistent moves such as Fire Blast. Paralysis also creates many revenge killers such as Nidoking, Clefable, and Mr. Mime. While Moltres often runs Agility and can counteract the Speed loss, this does not prevent full paralysis from inhibiting its reliability.</p> <p><strong>Arcanine: While uncommon in the modern metagame, Arcanine is uniquely able to wall Moltres. Not only does it outrun Moltres, but it also shrugs off any move and can retaliate with Body Slam and Hyper Beam, targeting Moltres's weaker Defense and threatening paralysis. However, Rest Moltres sets can engage in a stall war with Arcanine, and Toxic sets often win in the long term as well.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set leans on Moltres's huge damage output. Because NU tends to be fast-paced and lacking in recovery, nothing but Kabutops switches fearlessly into Fire Blast. A single hit leaves a number of foes in precarious positions. It puts Mr. Mime in KO range for Charizard's Hyper Beam and usually its Fire Blast, leaves Golem unable to safely switch into Charizard's Earthquake or Mr. Mime's Psychic, and leaves Poliwhirl in range of Mr. Mime's Thunderbolt, to name a few examples. Hyper Beam lets Moltres finish off Water-types after repeatedly taking Fire Blast, notably dealing 42% minimum to Poliwhirl and 35% minimum to Seadra; this damage can add consistency in securing KOs and allows a 3HKO on Seadra if Fire Blast burns. Fire Spin lets Moltres pivot out of threats such as Golem and Water-types and can provide crucial chip damage on a foe that is just out of Fire Blast range.</p> <p>The final moveslot allows Moltres to either threaten a sweep and shrug off paralysis via Agility, or create a headache for Charizard with Toxic; it can use Toxic plus Fire Spin to force Charizard to switch out rather than setting up, though this combination has dubious accuracy. Agility Moltres can also easily be saved for a late-game sweep, with teammates removing threats that can trade with or beat Moltres such as Water-types and Charizard. Then, Moltres can set up and potentially end the game, utilizing Fire Spin if necessary to earn crucial chip damage, though this is always risky.</p> <p>Moltres benefits from teammates that can cover its weaknesses; Blastoise matches up well against Fire- and Water-types, and Golem comes in on Fire-types that would otherwise exploit Moltres's poor coverage. Electrode is an offbeat option to exploit Water-types but leaves the team especially Golem-weak. Moltres also benefits from Mr. Mime and Clefable, which should be on every team, as both can typically remove key threats such as themselves or Kabutops.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Defensive Moltres can annoy and weaken various threats that handle its offensive set well. Toxic wears down foes hoping to set up such as Charizard and Kabutops, especially in combination with Fire Spin, which wastes their turns as Toxic damage ramps up. However, remember that Toxic has 84.4% accuracy and Fire Spin has a horrid 69.5% accuracy, and this fast-paced metagame heavily punishes misses. Even without Toxic, Fire Spin still allows Moltres to harass burned foes or pivot out of threats. If running Toxic, Reflect is an option to stall out Charizard; Slash is only a 4HKO, and Hyper Beam does not 2HKO until Charizard boosts to +6. This means that Charizard has to spend several turns setting up followed by several turns to KO, usually forcing Charizard to switch out instead. This does not work against Kabutops, as Surf is a guaranteed 3HKO. Reflect additionally has utility in slowing down Nidoking and Raticate if set up in advance, though Nidoking can still 3HKO with Blizzard and Raticate can break through with Super Fang and critical hit Body Slam or Hyper Beam. Rest, of course, provides Moltres with recovery, though it is hard to wake Moltres up against most of the tier; it can attempt to do so against Charizard without Swords Dance, Clefable without Blizzard, Venomoth, Moltres, and the occasional Ninetales and Porygon, and it can switch in on Charizard's Earthquake, Fire Spin, and various Thunder Wave users.</p> <p>Moltres can enable double switches to catch foes as they attempt to switch into its Rest, getting Kabutops or Blastoise against Golem or Charizard. Reflect sets additionally benefit from setting up a Moltres versus Charizard endgame, surprising the opponent with an unexpectedly bulky Moltres as Toxic racks up damage; to this end, allies that are effective at trading one-for-one such as Nidoking, Golem, and Blastoise are beneficial.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Moltres stands out as the strongest special attacker in RBY OU, tied with Articuno. It shares a lot of strengths and weaknesses with the other legendary bird: Moltres can also 2HKO Tauros and threaten Snorlax significantly while nailing Exeggutor and having Agility to clean up late-game. However, it too has a hard time breaking through very common special walls such as Starmie and Chansey, which holds it back tremendously. Should these walls be incapacitated or removed, Moltres can wreak havoc and make great use of its titanic Special stat.</p> <p>Due to these shared traits with Articuno, it is worth analyzing where they differ to understand which fits your team best. Moltres has access to Fire Spin in tandem with higher Attack, giving it a stronger Hyper Beam. These two qualities allow Moltres to muscle through checks like Starmie and Chansey more effectively than Articuno, especially when these Pokemon have been paralyzed and chipped beforehand. Moltres also possesses no hard walls: while Articuno really struggles against Lapras and Cloyster, there aren't any Pokemon that shut down Moltres quite so hard. However, Moltres's lower physical bulk and a weakness to Ice make it considerably easier to take down. Additionally, the type chart is unkind to Fire-type attacks in RBY, making Moltres considerably weaker in various matchups compared to Articuno, such as Zapdos and especially Rhydon. Furthermore, Fire Spin's accuracy makes it very unreliable; Fire Blast also suffers from this problem to a lesser degree. Overall, Moltres is a phenomenal late-game threat, despite being niche overall, as the ability to beat Tauros one-on-one is of crucial importance; while supporting it can be difficult, this Pokemon remains a sweeping threat that can tear down passive builds.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Moltres possesses a few other viable moves, but they are all hard to justify in most cases. Double-Edge gives it a strong move to hit Chansey on the switch, and to a lesser extent Starmie, which might make its job of taking down these checks a little easier, though you will usually be content to source your extra damage from an additional Fire Spin. Sky Attack hits for over 50% on both Starmie and Chansey, threatening to OHKO on a critical hit, but it requires good prediction to get away with the charge turn. Toxic allows Moltres to functionally empower its own Fire Spin without needing to land a Fire Blast burn, which helps with working around Chansey as long as Moltres can chain enough Fire Spins without missing.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Starmie and Slowbro stop Moltres dead in its tracks thanks to their great special bulk and lack of concern for burns, which allows them to switch into Fire Blast frequently. Starmie is particularly brutal, being faster and threatening hefty damage with any of Blizzard, Thunderbolt, or Surf, or even paralysis from Thunder Wave. Slowbro can use Moltres as setup fodder after paralyzing it, usually forcing it to try and pivot out with Fire Spin as to not give it a free Amnesia boost, though it needs to be wary when burned, as Fire Spin chains can rapidly rack up sufficient residual damage for Moltres to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey can put a hard stop to Moltres thanks to its gargantuan Special bulk; however, Moltres outspeeds it and can therefore stop it from recovering with Fire Spin. Therefore, it can muscle through Chansey with some luck, especially with a Fire Blast burn alongside Fire Spin, as Hyper Beam hits for over 40%. However, this can be quite risky for Moltres, as a miss lets Chansey cripple its late-game with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Zapdos</strong>: While neither is particularly willing to take a Fire Blast, both Jolteon and Zapdos outspeed Moltres while 2HKOing it with STAB Thunderbolt. However, Moltres can beat a chipped or resting Jolteon, having a good shot at 2HKOing it with Fire Blast + Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: While it looks enticing to switch Rhydon in on Fire Blast, its pathetic Special makes it take surprisingly high damage; there is even a chance of a 3HKO. Additionally, being burned is an utter death sentence for Rhydon, making it little more than fodder in the long run. However, Rhydon is otherwise one of the better Moltres checks, absorbing Hyper Beam well and PP stalling Fire Spin better than most OU staples, all while having an OHKO against it in Rock Slide; if it drops Rock Slide in favor of Rest, it gives up the OHKO, but it gains the ability to heal off the burns and can stall Moltres out of Fire Blasts, which is just as good.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Fire Blast is the main draw to Moltres. It threatens significant damage to a majority of the tier, including notable 2HKOs on Tauros, Exeggutor, and Cloyster, and has a nice 30.1% burn chance that forces sturdier physical attackers such as Snorlax and Rhydon to tread very carefully around Moltres. However, much like most special attackers in RBY OU, it must contend with the existence of Chansey and Starmie. These two Pokemon can comfortably heal off all damage taken by Fire Blast, and due to Fire Blast only having 8 PP, Moltres usually doesn't want to waste any on Pokemon that can just shrug it off; furthermore, landing a burn on these Pokemon can sometimes be counterproductive, as it removes the option of paralyzing them. Moltres packs a relatively powerful Hyper Beam to help it deal with special walls, thankfully; in tandem with a Fire Blast, it can hit both Chansey and Starmie for over 60% of their HP over two turns, meaning that, if such walls have been weakened, it stands a good chance of finishing the job. Agility is extremely helpful to ignore the Speed drop from paralysis and gain the upper hand on other fast late-game Pokemon such as Tauros and Zapdos; it is especially powerful in combination with Fire Spin, as a fast partial trapping move completely shuts down the opponent's ability to attack as long as it doesn't miss. Fire Spin excels when the opposition has been statused; it has great synergy with paralysis, which enables Moltres to move faster than any foe even without setting up Agility, and with burn, as repeatedly stopping the foe from moving racks up burn damage.</p> <p>Moltres's specialty is cleanup. If you are running Moltres, you ought to spend the early-game trying to cripple, chip, and potentially even remove the opposing Chansey and Starmie. Moltres is very unconventional in that it doesn't synergize particularly well with the two most powerful statuses in RBY, freeze and sleep. Fire Blast will thaw frozen opponents, and Fire Spin provides sleeping enemies with opportunities to wake while only taking minimal damage per turn. This means Moltres needs a very deliberate plan early-game and beyond to weaken checks and make your opponent play into your hand, especially against Starmie. Many teams are willing to let Starmie absorb sleep early-game, which is great for other Pokemon that struggle with it, like Articuno and Slowbro, but Moltres's resisted Fire Spin is the perfect opportunity for Starmie to burn sleep turns. You might want to try luring your opponent into letting you sleep a different Pokemon, even forgoing sleep altogether if you are feeling creative, or hoping sleeping Starmie falls victim to players' willingness to sacrifice sleeping Pokemon. Similarly, it won't be much use gambling your early-game trying to freeze a Chansey.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Agility + Partial Trapping. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to the current RBY UU metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Moltres is an unusual Pokemon in RBY UU. It has downright incredible base stats, boasting the second-highest total of any Pokemon outside of Ubers. Its Fire Blast is enormously strong, unsurpassed by any other unboosted special move in the game. Because of these traits, Moltres spent much of its history banned and was considered a top choice once it was finally released to the tier. Given its behemoth offensive prowess and the success its sibling Articuno had, one would be forgiven for assuming Moltres would be a staple in the tier.</p> <p>Moltres, however, is not a staple in RBY UU by any account. The tier is infested with Water-type Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Omastar, and UU king Tentacruel, which creates a very hostile environment for Moltres. Another major flaw is how heavily Articuno outclasses it. As a special attacker, Moltres is nearly strictly worse than Articuno, as several prominent Pokemon in the tier resist Fire but not Ice; thus, the true strength of Moltres's nuclear Fire Blast is seldom realized. Examples include Dragonite, Gyarados, Aerodactyl, and Golem. Somewhat humorously, the only major Pokemon that Moltres has an edge against relative to Articuno is Articuno itself. Being a Fire-type Pokemon isn’t doing Moltres any defensive favors either. Articuno has a much better chance at muscling through Water-type checks, as it can endure their attacks while it hunts for a critical hit or freeze. Moltres, on the other hand, will likely get 2HKOed by Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar, meaning it is afforded no extra turns to try to get lucky. Failing to resist Ice also leaves it more vulnerable to attackers like Gyarados. Considering the ubiquity of Water-type Pokemon and how everything that checks Articuno also checks Moltres, basically every well composed RBY UU team is incidentally prepared to face Moltres.</p> <p>Moltres is just barely able to scrounge a niche in RBY UU, being able to do one of two things for a team. Firstly, it can be a supplement to Articuno to create a strong special attacking core. Against neutral targets, Moltres's Fire Blast boasts impressive damage output, 2HKOing most neutral targets. Alternatively, Moltres can try to slowly rack up damage and possibly even sweep with AgiliSpin, much like Dragonite with Wrap. While both approaches to Moltres are viable, they have their issues. A Moltres and Articuno core still needs a lot of support, as the two share many checks. Fire Spin Moltres is a suboptimal partial trapper relative to staples like Dragonite due to the move's lower accuracy, PP, and damage output.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Moltres is generally best used as an offensive Pokemon, its impressive bulk can allow it to check a few Pokemon, like the tier’s Normal-type attackers. This means Moltres can run defensive options like Rest and Reflect. Toxic gives Moltres a more reliable option for Dragonite and synergizes well with Fire Spin.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Unless they happen to be in KO range of Hyper Beam or Double-Edge, Moltres is almost completely helpless against Water-type Pokemon. Tentacruel outspeeds Moltres and can use Wrap to weaken it or just cleanly 2HKO it with Surf. Vaporeon is slower but can take Moltres’s attacks more comfortably while still scoring a 2HKO. Poliwrath behaves similarly, but it can only potentially 2HKO Moltres if it has Hydro Pump. Thanks to its typing, Omastar is the best counter to Moltres; even if Moltres scores a critical hit with every attack, Omastar can safely use Rest and wall it indefinitely. Omastar will always 2HKO Moltres with Surf as well. Gyarados can take Moltres’s hits fairly comfortably and score a 2HKO with Hydro Pump or a 3HKO with Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Golem takes relatively little from Moltres’s moves. It is very likely to OHKO Moltres with Rock Slide, making Moltres very hesitant to pivot out with Fire Spin; this essentially gives Golem a free turn to use a powerful STAB attack or Substitute. Golem also punishes Hyper Beam exceptionally well, scoring a virtually guaranteed OHKO in response. Aerodactyl doesn’t have many good offensive options for Moltres, but it can take a few hits and apply pressure with Double-Edge, especially if it can land a few critical hits. Neither Golem nor Aerodactyl handles a burn well, however.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite: Moltres can, at best, 4HKO Dragonite, but it will likely require even more turns to KO it. Dragonite, on the other hand, can 3HKO with Blizzard, stymie Moltres's offensive ability with Thunder Wave, or attempt to use Agility and sweep with Wrap. Dragonite's ability to sweep is threatened by Fire Blast's burn chance, but Dragonite is still very likely to win the matchup thanks to its wide array of strong special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio has no business switching into Moltres and despises burn, but it survives a Fire Blast and can 2HKO Moltres with Rock Slide. Thanks to its high critical hit rate, Dugtrio is liable to OHKO Moltres as well, making Moltres fearful even if it is at full health and has used Agility.</p> ",

          "name": "Special Sweeper",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Moltres’s Fire Blast ties with Articuno’s Blizzard as the strongest unboosted special move in the tier. While more Pokemon resist Fire Blast than Blizzard, the move still deals massive damage to the right targets; it 3HKOes Hypno and 2HKOes Kangaskhan, Persian, Dodrio, Dugtrio, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Venusaur. Fire Blast actually outperforms Blizzard against a select few — albeit uncommon — Pokemon as well, including Dewgong, Pinsir, and Venomoth. It also comes with a nasty 30.1% chance to burn, which keeps some would-be checks, like Tentacruel and Dragonite, somewhat hesitant to face Moltres. While not quite as lethal as a freeze, a burn can completely incapacitate pretty much every physical attacker outside of Persian. A burn on a partial trapper like Tentacruel can force it to use Rest much earlier than usual, as the passive damage will build up if it tries to use Wrap or Bind. However, due to Fire Blast's poor accuracy and UU's many Water-types, running out of PP is a genuine possibility. Additionally, a single miss can ruin Moltres, as it leaves it vulnerable to being paralyzed or KOed. As such, Moltres must use it wisely.</p> <p>Moltres's surprisingly high Attack stat makes its Hyper Beam and Double-Edge remarkably strong. Because of the extra damage output from its physical attacks, Moltres can use Agility and attempt to sweep even sooner than Articuno in some cases. For example, Tentacruel and Kadabra must be at or below 35% and 65% health, respectively, for Articuno to secure a sweep with Hyper Beam. For Moltres, these Pokemon can be at 38.5% and 72% health. The difference is minor, but it can be important in a metagame where many Pokemon lose health in increments of roughly 3% to Tentacruel’s Wrap.</p> <p>Fire Spin is more versatile than Double-Edge, enabling it to chip weakened foes into KO range of Fire Blast or Hyper Beam. The move can also immobilize, slowly whittle down, and potentially sweep the opposing team, especially if Moltres has managed to use Agility. Fire Spin also gives Moltres an option against Dragonite; it can use the move and switch out to something that can prevent Dragonite from setting up its potentially game-ending Agility. Compared to Dragonite's Wrap, Moltres's Fire Spin has lower accuracy and PP but has the benefit of damaging Haunter. Alternatively, Double-Edge provides Moltres with a consistent attack with perfect accuracy, a lot of PP, and few drawbacks. This greatly aids in Moltres’s sweeping, allowing it to take out weakened targets with little risk. Note that Articuno almost completely outclasses Moltres running Double-Edge, so Articuno should generally be run alongside Moltres if this set is chosen. Essentially, Fire Spin is for sweeping sooner, while Double-Edge is for sweeping reliably. Agility makes Moltres faster than the entire unboosted metagame and therefore less fearful of Pokemon like Tentacruel, Kadabra, Electabuzz, and Raichu while letting it attempt to sweep or wallbreak.</p> <p>Moltres requires quite a lot of support to function. Pokemon that can apply pressure to Water-type Pokemon, such as Electabuzz, Raichu, and Venusaur, are good partners. Physical attackers like Persian and Kangaskhan can also work with Moltres on hyper offense builds. Together, they can form mixed attacking cores that few teams can handle. Users of sleep inducing moves like Hypno, Tangela, and the aforementioned Venusaur provide Moltres with a setup opportunity. If Moltres is being used alongside Articuno, much of the same support is required, though to an even greater extent. Fast Pokemon like Kadabra and Dugtrio are also good partners, as the core is relatively slow and liable to be smothered by Tentacruel.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Agility + Partial Trapping and Sleep-inducing moves, as well as Lapras becoming legal. The most up to date moveset for Dragonite is the following.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragonite has a diverse array of coverage moves to play with if it wants to cover certain targets. While it misses out on hitting Grass-type Pokemon, Surf is a more accurate alternative to Blizzard that does more to Golem and Omastar while still 2HKOing Dugtrio. Fire Blast is an interesting option that can burn foes. Burn synergizes well with Dragonite’s Wrap and can incapacitate opposing users of partial trapping moves and physical attackers like Tentacruel and Kangaskhan. The move also happens to be Dragonite’s strongest option against Articuno and Pinsir, netting a 3HKO and a 2HKO, respectively. Thunder is a somewhat viable alternative to Thunderbolt; while it sacrifices accuracy, the move garners a possible 2HKO against Omastar and Dewgong and a guaranteed 3HKO against Vaporeon.</p> <p>Dragonite also comes equipped with some notable defensive options. Rest is the most notable of the bunch, as Dragonite is quite difficult to 3HKO. In addition to Wrap turns, Dragonite can attempt to wake up on Pokemon such as Venusaur, Tangela, Aerodactyl, and Electabuzz. The move can still be exploited by Blizzard users and Agility users—most notably Articuno and opposing Dragonite—however. Reflect is potentially interesting for helping against physical attackers, but it fails to protect Dragonite from the many prominent special attackers and Persian's and Pinsir's Slash. Toxic is a fairly useful move for taking advantage of Wrap, but it doesn’t help much against faster Pokemon and has no effect on Tentacruel.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Blizzard Users: Pokemon with Blizzard greatly threaten Dragonite and can force it out rather consistently. Tentacruel, Articuno, and Dewgong are guaranteed to OHKO Dragonite with Blizzard, so it is very likely to switch out when faced with any of them. Articuno is particularly scary, as not only does it outspeed Dragonite, but it can also potentially set up with Agility and sweep regardless of what Dragonite does. Omastar and Vaporeon are also very likely to OHKO, which encourages Dragonite to switch out, although it may elect to take the risk if it has Wrap. Gyarados outspeeds and can OHKO Dragonite 38.5% of the time, making it a fairly strong answer as well. Poliwrath will never OHKO Dragonite, but it is still a fairly reliable answer to sets without Thunderbolt, though Dragonite may risk using Agility in front of it, especially if the situation is dire.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage: Because most Dragonite variants rely on Wrap for damage and pivoting, passive damage does a great job at punishing them. Toxic is the most common form of passive damage and is frequently run by Dugtrio, Persian, Kangaskhan, Dodrio, Venusaur, and Aerodactyl. The damage causes Dragonite to take more damage than it can deal with Wrap, thus limiting its ability to pivot and shutting down the AgiliWrap combo almost entirely. Other, less common, forms of passive damage, such as burn and Leech Seed, will work much the same. Aerodactyl and Moltres are the most likely Pokemon to burn Dragonite, as they regularly carry Fire Blast. The Attack drop makes Wrap, Body Slam, and Hyper Beam, much less effective. Venusaur is the only notable user of Leech Seed; though the effect is not permanent, it may choose to run the move over Toxic because of the higher accuracy and HP recovery. All forms of passive damage also limit Dragonite's defensive capabilities, regardless of the set. For example, Dugtrio and Kangaskhan become much more likely to get 3HKOs if Dragonite is poisoned. Additionally, after just a single turn of Toxic damage, Vaporeon will always OHKO Dragonite with Blizzard and Gyarados will OHKO over 80% of the time.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: If Dragonite is paralyzed, it only has about a 63% chance of connecting Wrap. Like passive damage, paralysis greatly reduces the reliability of Wrap for pivoting and sweeping. Moreover, being paralyzed leaves Dragonite much less equipped to handle slow users of Blizzard like Vaporeon, Omastar, and Dewgong.</p> <p><strong>Normal-resistant Pokemon</strong>: While it is still immobilized by Wrap, Haunter takes no damage from the move. Haunter can rather effectively stall Dragonite out of Wrap PP, meaning that setting up AgiliWrap is close to unviable so long as Haunter is healthy. Outside of Wrap, Dragonite still needs to be wary of Haunter’s very fast Hypnosis and Explosion. Much like Haunter, Rock-type Pokemon like Omastar, Aerodactyl, and Golem can potentially PP stall Dragonite’s Wrap, especially if they are paired with each other or Haunter. Aerodactyl is especially notable, as it outspeeds Dragonite, meaning it can switch in and use Toxic or KO it if it happens to be in range. Finally, Rock-type Pokemon can switch in and punish Hyper Beam effectively with prediction.</p> <p><strong>Faster Partial-trappers: Partial-trapping moves allow Pokemon like Pinsir and Moltres to stop an AgiliWrap sweep without dedicating a moveslot to Toxic. Both Pokemon can then easily pivot to Pokemon like Tentacruel and Articuno. However, if Dragonite has already used Agility, partial-trapping moves cannot punish a miss, unlike Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Blizzard. Moltres is the only exception, being able to use Agility itself after a miss to outspeed the boosted Dragonite and chip it down with Fire Spin.</p> ",

          "description": "<hr /> <h1>Outdated Analysis</h1> <h1>Overview</h1> <p>Thanks to an unrivaled base stat total and enormous movepool, Dragonite is easily the most versatile Pokemon in RBY UU and a major influence on what Pokemon and moves are popular. Dragonite is most infamous for its lethal Agility and Wrap combo, which enables it to slowly chip down foes and potentially sweep entire teams. The pair of moves is so powerful that virtually every Pokemon is forced to carry a move that can dispatch or incapacitate Dragonite before it can set up. In addition to being the most potent sweeper in the tier, Dragonite has numerous defensive and supportive traits that make it very easy to justify including on most teams. Its typing and enormous bulk allow it to take on tier staples such as Dugtrio, Persian, Kangaskhan, Venusaur, and Tangela. Furthermore, Wrap and Thunder Wave allow Dragonite to act as a pivot and provide essential support for its teammates. Finally, Dragonite has an incredibly diverse pool of offensive options including Blizzard, Thunderbolt, Body Slam, and the strongest non-STAB Hyper Beam, making it unpredictable and difficult to check. Its typing and versatility also make it an excellent partner to many key Pokemon; those that fear Dugtrio and other physical attackers, like Electabuzz, Haunter, and Persian, appreciate it, as do those that benefit from paralysis spreading, like Articuno, Kangaskhan, and Golem.</p> <p>Dragonite's most obvious shortcoming is its Ice weakness, which gives many prominent Blizzard users, including Tentacruel, Articuno, Vaporeon, Omastar, Dewgong, and Gyarados, the potential to OHKO it. For Tentacruel, Articuno, and Dewgong, this KO is guaranteed. All of them can force Dragonite out if they come in at the same time as it or through a Wrap pivot. They can also severely punish Dragonite if it misses with Wrap. Dragonite is also quite vulnerable to status effects, as they weaken strategies involving Wrap, either by damaging Dragonite during Wrap turns or making it less likely to connect the move. While Dragonite is not particularly slow, it is outpaced by several prominent Pokemon, most notably Tentacruel, so Dragonite is likely to be revenge killed once it has sustained a fair amount of damage. Lastly, while AgiliWrap is Dragonite's claim to fame, it is not totally reliable. Due to Wrap's mediocre 84.4% accuracy, it's not uncommon for Dragonite to set up Agility, miss with Wrap early, and faint to Blizzard.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This is Dragonite’s most common set, and arguably its most dangerous. After using Agility, Dragonite outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame and can immobilize and chip any Pokemon but Haunter. Considering Dragonite’s unrivaled Attack stat, Wrap can deal massive damage to the opposing team and occasionally even sweep outright after Agility. However, the healthier the opposing team is, the less likely this strategy is to work; Dragonite will need some luck to connect Wrap that many times. Because Wrap is sometimes dealt with through repeated switching, the Dragonite user can also potentially gain a lot of information about the opposing team quite early in the game. Unlike other sweepers and Agility users, Dragonite can set up at virtually any point in the game; Wrap can severely weaken a team even if it doesn’t actually KO any of its members. From there, fast sweepers like Dugtrio, Persian, and Electabuzz can quickly finish the job. Aside from Haunter and Rock-type Pokemon like Omastar, Aerodactyl, and Golem—which do not take much damage from Wrap—there aren’t really any Pokemon that need to be dealt with before Dragonite can comfortably set up. Another key aspect of AgiliWrap is just how threatening it is; Dragonite very strongly discourages Pokemon from switching out, as doing so could net Dragonite the free turn it needs to use Agility and do a lot of damage. Because of this pressure, Dragonite can often force key damage on slow Pokemon like Hypno and Vaporeon with Wrap, which could potentially force an earlier use of Rest, which Dragonite and its teammates could later exploit. Additionally, if Dragonite is in a position to accept poison or paralysis, it can get enormous damage on or paralyze a powerful Pokemon like Dugtrio, Persian, or Kangaskhan.</p> <p>The key to this Dragonite set is finding the right opportunity to set up. The most obvious way is in front of sleeping or frozen foes. If they do not switch out from Dragonite's teammates immediately, they risk inviting Dragonite in to potentially close the game right there. Moreover, AgiliWrap Dragonite is one of the best, if not the best, Pokemon at punishing Rest. Dragonite creates many 50/50 situations by punishing Rest, most notably threatening to come in against a Hypno that was brought to about half health by Kadabra or opposing Hypno. Alternatively, Dragonite may face a Pokemon that lacks a move to immediately dispatch it; these Pokemon are also prime setup fodder. Preventing Dragonite from successfully sweeping with Wrap generally involves using Toxic, a move that can induce paralysis, or Blizzard, provided the user can OHKO Dragonite. Pokemon without any of these options are fairly rare, but not unseen. Offensive Normal-type Pokemon, such as Kangakhan, Persian, and Dodrio, regularly drop Toxic, making them good targets to set up, especially after some scouting. Finally, while poison and paralysis do greatly hinder any shot of sweeping with Wrap, statused Dragonite is not dead weight, still being good at dealing some damage before it goes down. In the case of paralysis, Dragonite still maintains its defensive abilities, such as checking Dugtrio, Venusaur, and Tangela. Additionally, because Agility clears the Speed drop from paralysis, Dragonite can still attempt to use AgiliWrap. The consistency is significantly lower, but Dragonite still has the potential to deal a lot of damage, and the occasional full paralysis can actually make PP stalling Dragonite a bit trickier, as Rock-type Pokemon looking to switch in on Wrap may end up at risk of taking Blizzard or Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Besides AgiliWrap, Dragonite's most notable attribute is reliably checking Dugtrio and Grass-type Pokemon like Venusaur and Tangela. Because of this role, Blizzard is an obvious choice on the set to hit them hard. Thanks to Dragonite’s above average Special, the move is a good option for weakening offensive Pokemon or finishing off foes during a sweep attempt. It also happens to be Dragonite's best tool for hitting Haunter, being a 4HKO. Additionally, if Dragonite is desperate, it can fish for a freeze to set up with Agility. Dragonite’s final moveslot is its most flexible, generally being used to suit what the team needs. Despite limiting Dragonite to just one consistent source of damage, Thunder Wave is a good option, as it can slow down offensive Normal-type Pokemon that will likely stay in against Dragonite and use Toxic. It can also incapacitate opposing Wrap Dragonite and catch faster Pokemon that often switch in, like Tentacruel and Gyarados. Furthermore, if you are afraid of missing Wrap and willing to sacrifice Dragonite, settling for paralysis on a key Pokemon is often a worthwhile trade. Dragonite boasts the strongest non-STAB Hyper Beam in the game, making it an excellent move for finishing off foes that have been chipped by Wrap. The move can KO Tentacruel and Hypno from around half health and even has a 30.8% chance to OHKO Kadabra. Body Slam functions much the same as Hyper Beam, albeit being notably weaker. The superior accuracy, paralysis chance, and lack of a recharge turn make the move a lot more reliable during sweeps, however. Finally, Thunderbolt is the best option for Omastar, which otherwise is relatively unafraid of Dragonite. The move is also notable for dealing heavy damage to Vaporeon, Dewgong, and especially Gyarados.</p> <p>AgiliWrap Dragonite can fit on the majority of teams, considering the larger number of Pokemon it can check and how universally threatening AgiliWrap is. Many key Pokemon in the tier are very afraid of Dugtrio, so Dragonite’s ability to come in on Earthquake and swiftly punish it with Blizzard is appreciated. While Pokemon such as Gyarados also accomplish this role, Dragonite is generally unbothered by Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon, making it a strong choice on teams with multiple Water-type Pokemon already. Dragonite can form very strong defensive cores with most Water-type Pokemon, especially Vaporeon. Vaporeon is very good at dealing with Ice-type moves and can improve the effectiveness of Wrap by spreading paralysis with Body Slam. The pair also makes Dugtrio struggle to gain momentum, as the opponent will have to constantly choose between using Earthquake and Rock Slide to net the most damage. Electric-type Pokemon, such as Electabuzz and Raichu, can pressure bulky Water-type Pokemon that can bully Dragonite. Raichu also has Surf to OHKO Golem, which takes Wrap chip damage very comfortably. Kadabra is another immensely good teammate for Dragonite. In addition to being quite good at spreading paralysis, Kadabra handles Toxic better than any other Pokemon thanks to Recover. This means it is a strong switch-in when Dragonite faces a Pokemon that must use Toxic to prevent AgiliWrap. Similarly, Poison-type Pokemon like Tentacruel, Venusaur, and Venomoth can also switch into predicted Toxic. Finally, users of sleep-inducing moves, like Haunter, Venusaur, Tangela, Poliwrath, and Hypnosis Hypno, give Dragonite an additional target to potentially set up on.</p> "

          "name": "Wrap Pivot",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This Dragonite set is more of a defensive pivot and takes advantage of its wide movepool to improve many common matchups and reduce the danger of Toxic. While Dragonite is far from the fastest Pokemon in the tier, it is still quick enough to pressure Pokemon like Hypno, Tangela, and bulky Water-type Pokemon with Wrap. Additionally, Wrap can enable one of Dragonite's teammates to come in safely. Most often a strong offensive Pokemon, like Kangaskhan, Persian, Dodrio, Gyarados, or Articuno, will take advantage of this opportunity to take out a weakened foe. This strategy is especially effective against slower foes because Dragonite is not pressured to switch out immediately, meaning it can be difficult to predict when it will pivot to a stronger attacker. Wrap is less effective against faster foes, but still feasible if a Pokemon like Tentacruel tries to switch into Dragonite. In a case like this, Dragonite can then very easily pivot to something even faster, like Kadabra or Electabuzz, to threaten Tentacruel in return. Even without a boost from Agility, Wrap is very good for maintaining momentum.</p> <p>This set becomes very powerful with paralysis support, as it allows Dragonite to deal a lot of damage and pivot effectively against more Pokemon. Fast Pokemon that can threaten Dragonite like Kadabra and Electabuzz become almost trivial to manage after paralysis. This means Dragonite can be a strong choice late-game and avoid taking damage even without Agility. Thus, this set frequently makes use of Thunder Wave. Dragonite is one of the only Pokemon with Thunder Wave that can take a few hits from Normal-type attackers. It is a surprisingly strong check to Kangaskhan, Persian, and Dodrio, as it can switch in and pacify them with Thunder Wave. Thunder Wave can also nail some key Pokemon that are likely to switch in against Dragonite. As an example, Dugtrio is very likely to use Toxic against Dragonite and then switch out to something that can stomach a Blizzard. Common situations like this one allow Dragonite to paralyze important Pokemon like Vaporeon, Omastar, and even Tentacruel.</p> <p>Aside from Wrap and possibly Thunder Wave, the remaining moveslots are usually dedicated to some combination of offensive moves. Blizzard is the most common because it helps against Dugtrio, which is generally the Pokemon that encourages players to use Dragonite in the first place. It’s also the best option against the Normal-type Pokemon this set often seeks to face. Body Slam and Hyper Beam are strong options for picking off Hypno and frailer Pokemon like Kadabra, especially if they are paralyzed. Body Slam in particular is also notable for threatening to paralyze Dugtrio and fast Pokemon that are likely to switch in, much like Thunder Wave. Thunderbolt is the best option for the numerous Water-type Pokemon in the tier. A key advantage of this set is that, once the first three moves are used, most players will anticipate that its last move will be Agility; this lets it regularly catch Pokemon like Hypno and Omastar by surprise with a powerful attack.</p> <p>This set works best with Pokemon that can spread or benefit from paralysis. Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Dodrio, Gyarados, and Vaporeon fit in both categories, as they use Body Slam and become more dangerous against paralyzed foes. Hypno, Kadabra, and Electabuzz are common partners for their ability to spread paralysis. Conversely, Pokemon like Tentacruel, Articuno, and Golem appreciate Dragonite’s ability to paralyze Water-type Pokemon and pressure them with Wrap. Pokemon with a severe weakness to Dugtrio or the Normal-type Pokemon, like Haunter or Electabuzz, greatly benefit from this Dragonite set. Dugtrio itself is also a good partner, as it matches up well against Pokemon that take little or nothing from Wrap, like Omastar and Haunter, while also scaring off Tentacruel, which is often quite difficult to paralyze.</p> "

          "name": "PhysNite (Offensive)",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This offensive set allows uses Dragonite's large stats and movepool to break down walls and block certain Pokemon from making progress. In many ways, it performs similarly to Gyarados, being a solid check to Dugtrio that can pressure frail or slow Pokemon like Kadabra and Hypno. Specifically, PhysNite functions as a tank, shutting down Pokemon unable to immediately threaten it and firing off some of the most powerful attacks in the game and the crippling Thunder Wave. It is also a potent revenge killer, able to pressure Dugtrio and pretty much everything slower than it. The main trade-off in using Dragonite over Gyarados is the selection of Pokemon that each one checks. While Gyarados holds up better against bulky Water-type Pokemon, Tentacruel, Articuno, and opposing Dragonite, Dragonite matches up more comfortably against Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon. Essentially, this set is best on teams that need Gyarados’s set of attributes but may fear certain matchups.</p> <p>This set benefits a lot from how players conventionally react when facing Dragonite. Lacking Wrap, this set handles paralysis and poison better than any other. In fact, considering Dragonite has such a good matchup against Venusaur and Tangela, it is remarkably good at preventing them from putting something to sleep if it has been paralyzed. Handling status fairly well makes PhysNite quite comfortable taking on certain threats, like Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Tangela, that other Dragonite are likely to avoid out of fear of paralysis. Dragonite’s wide pool of offensive moves and access to paralysis gives it many strong head-to-head matchups, allowing it to fairly comfortably trade with several common Pokemon. Teams that struggle with just one specific Pokemon, like Dugtrio, a Grass-type Pokemon, or an Electric-type Pokemon, tend to be the best fit for this Dragonite set.</p> "

          "name": "Agility Sweeper",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This is Dragonite’s least common set, but it is still fairly effective. It forgoes Wrap and frames Dragonite as a more conventional Agility sweeper, like Articuno and Dodrio. While they can generally sweep much sooner than Dragonite thanks to having STAB moves, Dragonite maintains a few minor advantages over them that make it worth using. Firstly, Dragonite enjoys a generally superior defensive typing, meaning it can still act as a check to Pokemon like Dugtrio in a pinch. Secondly, Dragonite is a strong mixed attacker, which allows it secure endgames against a wider variety of Pokemon than other sweepers. Lastly, and most importantly, the mere sight of Dragonite strongly encourages certain foes to use Toxic. Unlike Wrap sets, this set is largely unfazed by Toxic. This means, unlike other Agility users, Dragonite can guarantee itself an almost free turn to set up against certain foes. If the opposing team is weak enough, Dragonite can quickly clean up with its impressive offenses and wide coverage.</p> <p>This set requires quite a fair deal more support to function than most sets. Bulkier Pokemon like Omastar, Vaporeon, and Articuno need to be brought into KO range of Thunderbolt or Hyper Beam before this set has any chance of succeeding. As such, this set tends to fit better on more offensive teams that can consistently damage foes and keep them from using Rest. Fast Pokemon like Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Electabuzz are thus among the best partners. Having a solid answer to Articuno is also advisable, as it is bulky enough to easily set up with Agility and then KO Dragonite, even if Dragonite has already set up itself. Also unlike the other sets, this Dragonite set has limited utility early-game and relies fairly heavily on surprise factor, making it most useful towards the very end of the game.</p> "

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragonite makes good use of Thunderbolt to hit Cloyster hard and dish out decent damage against Lapras on the switch in, both of which can scare Dragonite out with the threat of an OHKO with Blizzard. Thunder Wave can be useful against switch-ins that are typically difficult to paralyze, such as Gengar and Starmie, that Dragonite is bound to see. Body Slam blends damage with paralysis chance if you don't want to give up an attacking move for paralysis. Double-Edge is slightly stronger than Body Slam at the cost of not being able to paralyze and causing recoil damage. As finisher moves, both options have an advantage over Hyper Beam by not having to recharge if the opposing Pokemon is not KOed; the lower Base Power makes these moves unfavorable choices, however.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gengar is the chief check as it's immune to Wrap and takes a pittance from any of Dragonite's other options. It doesn't really accomplish much against Dragonite, though, but will generally outlast non-Blizzard Dragonite one-on-one in a battle between unSTAB-boosted special attacks. Powerful Blizzard users, such as Lapras, Cloyster, Articuno, and, to an extent, Jynx, can all scare Dragonite out with the threat of an OHKO. The former three are very physically bulky and will be able to take several hits before dying, which makes it all the more likely that Wrap will miss at some point. Exeggutor and especially Slowbro are also very bulky and can threaten Dragonite with paralysis, but apart from that, they won't generally be able to handle Dragonite on their own. Chansey and Starmie are resilient with their instant recovery and usually carry Ice moves that can 2HKO Dragonite. These two can also paralyze Dragonite with Thunder Wave and force it to risk full paralysis in addition to Wrap misses. Note that Dragonite can use Agility again to completely ignore the Speed reduction from paralysis and resume being faster than all of your Pokemon. On the other hand, however, as full paralysis can also occur in the middle of a Wrap sequence, paralysis will severely limit Dragonite's potential. Its often even advised to go for the guaranteed paralysis with Thunder Wave instead of using an unSTAB-boosted Ice-type attack that will not OHKO.</p> <p>Any Pokemon that has enough health to take Dragonite's Hyper Beam can switch in to this predicted finishing move to cripple or KO Dragonite. When the opposing Pokemon is in KO range from Hyper Beam, the Dragonite user is likely to use it instead of Wrap, to avoid the possibility of an untimely Wrap miss. Punishing a predicted Hyper Beam could give you the possibility of paralyzing or KOing Dragonite. However, proper prediction is required as Dragonite could continue using Wrap, which by itself still has a high success rate against the weakened opponent. Pokemon that resist Normal-type moves, such as Golem and Rhydon, might even be surprised by Surf, which will OHKO them.</p> <p>It's important to note that, if given the chance, using the turn Dragonite uses Agility to cripple it is crucial. Even if you can only land one move that won't do much to Dragonite, such as Body Slam or Psychic, it may still be very rewarding later on, as it will increase the chances of any Ice-type move OHKOing Dragonite. In addition, Body Slam might also score paralysis, which will often ruins Dragonite's ability to effectively sweep.</p> <p>If all else fails, you can try to stall it out of Wrap PP if you can count carefully to 32. Wrap is very weak and locks Dragonite into Wrap if it chooses to stay in, regardless of whether you choose to switch or stay in yourself. Thus, you can repeatedly switch out to force Dragonite to use more turns which read \"Dragonite used Wrap!\" and that therefore cost PP as opposed to the \"Its attack continues!\" turns that do not use PP. However, if you miscount and switch out after Dragonite has used its last Wrap PP, Dragonite will still be forced to use Wrap PP, but instead of forcing Dragonite to use Struggle, RBY glitches and rolls Wrap's PP counter up to 63 to allow it to use Wrap again, thereby rendering your stall for naught. This strategy works much more effectively if you have Golem or Rhydon on your team, as otherwise you will have to sacrifice at least one Pokemon before Wrap runs out of PP.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>The following analysis was produced in 2012. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to the current RBY OU metagame.</p> <hr /> <h1>Overview</h1> <p>It's got a wide attacking movepool. It's tied with Mew for the second-highest Base Stat Total in the game. It's the only fully-evolved Dragon-type in RBY, a type that sounds legendary on its own and that resists the STAB attacks of all three starter Pokemon. It's the final Pokemon used by Lance, the fourth member of the Elite Four. Clearly, Dragonite was intended to be some sort of legendary behemoth, the boss Pokemon to end all boss Pokemon, at least until the player found Mewtwo. However, in competitive usage, Dragonite is more likely to elicit groans and grimaces of irritation rather than the intended screams and wide eyes of terror. This is because Dragonite's power in OU does not derive from Hyper Beam, its massive base 134 Attack, its typing, or its diverse Special movepool. Rather, it's because of an annoying little move that its lowly first-stage evolution, Dratini, knows from the start: Wrap.</p> <p>Wrap's mechanics differ drastically in RBY compared to later generations; the move has a mere 15 Base Power, but it prevents the opposing Pokemon from making a move while the Wrap user is locked into this move for 2-5 turns. Furthermore, the immobilized opponent cannot attack even during the turn the Wrap user switches out, providing a safe entry for another Pokemon. However, unlike in other generations, the opponent might switch out the Pokemon that is incapacitated by Wrap. Dragonite is the best Wrap user in RBY because it, unlike any other RBY Wrapper, also has access to Agility to make it faster than any other Pokemon in the game. If Dragonite gets lucky and hits all of its Wraps, it can totally sweep a team without the opponent even being able to move. However, Dragonite will always miss a Wrap or two, leaving it vulnerable to getting paralyzed or shellacked by an Ice-type move. It is this unreliability that prevents Dragonite from being considered a staple of RBY OU when Wrap is allowed. When Wrap is not allowed, Dragonite is barely worth mentioning in OU due to its lack of STAB, mediocre Speed, and disastrous 4x weakness to the ubiquitous Ice Beam and Blizzard.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Here it is, possibly the most annoying set in all of Pokemon history. It's more than just annoying, however; it's absolutely deadly if luck is on your side. Agility boosts Dragonite's Speed above that of any unboosted Pokemon in the game. It then proceeds to take advantage of Wrap's debilitating mechanics by repeatedly using the move to render any switch-in unable to move, while slowly whittling away at the opposing Pokemon's health. Wrap can even be used to immobilize Gengar, which is immune to Normal-type moves, although Gengar is unlike other Wrap victims in that it does not take damage while incapacitated by Wrap. It is, however, not easy to find a good moment to use Agility, due to the prevalence of Ice-type and paralysis-inducing moves in RBY. Switching into the occasional sleeping or frozen Pokemon lets Dragonite set up Agility safely, however. Otherwise, slow Pokemon such as Golem, Rhydon, Snorlax, and Exeggutor that lack Stun Spore are good options to switch in and set up on. Taking a hit from them, however, means that Dragonite is now OHKOed by unSTAB-boosted Ice-type attacks.</p> <p>Once the opponent's Pokemon has been worn down to low enough health, Dragonite can use one of its other two attacking moves to secure the KO. Hyper Beam is generally the best option, as it is the strongest attack in Dragonite's movepool. Dragonite will usually be able to avoid Hyper Beam's incapacitating side effect as Wrap is meant to first put Pokemon in Hyper Beam's OHKO range. It lacks STAB, but comes from a base 134 Attack stat. Surf is the preferred option in the last slot as it guarantees an OHKO on the Rock / Ground types Golem and Rhydon. Blizzard can be used in its place to heavily damage Golem and Rhydon, but also to give Dragonite its best direct attack to use against Gengar. It also works as an alternative finishing move for Pokemon such as Zapdos and Exeggutor and, unlike Hyper Beam, does not force Dragonite to recharge if it does not OHKO.</p> <p>Dragonite is generally saved for a sweep and, as such, appreciates support from teammates that can spread paralysis directly. Not only does paralysis make Dragonite faster than the opponent without it having to use Agility, but a full paralysis might also save Dragonite if Wrap misses. Alakazam, Chansey, Starmie, Exeggutor, Slowbro, and Zapdos are all Pokemon that can perform that role excellently. The former options can tank hits from many threats as well, while the latter two provide more offensive pressure. The choices should depend on how offensive you want your team to be, although it should be noted that Alakazam and Slowbro are generally the best options to spread paralysis.</p> <p>In addition, Dragonite is able to do more than merely sweep with Wrap; if it gets in on a predicted switch to a slow Pokemon, such as Exeggutor, Snorlax, or Chansey, or on a predicted Earthquake from Rhydon or Golem, it can use Wrap against whatever your opponent might decide to switch in. Dragonite can then switch out to a counter, which is guaranteed to take no damage from the switch-in thanks to Wrap's immobilization effect. Dragonite's ability to act as a pivot makes it a decent mid-game partner for heavy-hitters such as Snorlax and Rhydon to let them switch in on paralyzed foes with impunity. Moreover, as Wrap can still immobilize Gengar, hard-hitters such as Snorlax, Rhydon, Golem, and Tauros also synergize well with Dragonite in this regard. If Gengar switches into Wrap, you can immediately go to a powerful sweeper without taking damage thanks to Wrap's mechanics. Earthquake will generally scare Gengar out, giving Dragonite the possibility of punishing whatever your opponent switches in.</p> "

    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Feast your eyes on the most destructive Pokemon in any tier in history. Not one stat Mewtwo has can be called bad or even average, including the highest Special in the game and a tie with Aerodactyl and Jolteon for second-highest Speed. It's not just an offensive juggernaut: Mewtwo's bulk is absolutely titanic, stomaching even blows from the mighty Snorlax and Tauros. Its Psychic typing comes into this as well, giving it effectively no type-based weaknesses to exploit. Because of these qualities, taking Mewtwo down often requires a concentrated effort from multiple Pokemon. As if that wasn't enough, it has a plethora of fantastic moves, such as Amnesia, Recover, STAB Psychic, Self-Destruct, and more. If given even a single turn of breathing room, Mewtwo can immediately take over a game. There is no true way to defeat Mewtwo head-on other than sending in your own, statusing it, or getting plain lucky. Thus, many RBY Ubers games are decided by a Mewtwo mirror match. Mewtwo was designed to be the world's strongest Pokemon, and Game Freak certainly succeeded: Mewtwo has zero inarguable flaws and is an automatic pick on any RBY Ubers team that aims to win.</p> <p>Mewtwo's only arguable flaws stem from it being quite literally too powerful for a Game Boy to process. A maximum DV and EV Mewtwo can end up overflowing its Special if it's boosted to +4 or higher and subsequently sustains a Special drop, minimizing its Special and leaving it effortless to KO. Similarly, Mewtwo's Speed gives it a very high critical hit rate—25.39%—which, combined with the fact that critical hits ignore the attacker's offensive boosts, means that +3 or higher Mewtwo will sometimes deal less damage than expected. Finally, while Mewtwo is incredible, it will always have some check it has trouble beating outside of brute force, as it often only has two moveslots available after Amnesia and Recover. However, brute force remains a fine option in a tight spot because Mewtwo is an utter juggernaut.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>To prevent Mewtwo's Special from overflowing, 8 EVs and 13 DVs in Special can make the stat 341 on any given Mewtwo set, which amounts to 1023 at +4, albeit capped at 999 in practice. This is known as the \"SafeTwo\" spread, pioneered by Enigami. Doing this, however, severely cuts into Mewtwo's bulk, making critical hits from special attacks deal noticeably higher damage. Thus, using this spread depends on whether your Mewtwo set aims for short-term reward or maximum mileage throughout a game.</p> <p>If a move is good in RBY, there is a good chance that Mewtwo learns it. Customizing Mewtwo usually consists of patching up offensive holes in a team while ensuring it doesn't leave itself open to its checks; in other words, without compromising its power level or making it more situational. Generally, Mewtwo's only free moveslot is one of its two attacking ones, as Amnesia and Recover are pivotal to its success.</p> <p>Rest is an interesting choice over Recover, especially on Barrier + Amnesia sets, which generally aim to last as long as possible, as it stalls for three turns at the cost of 1 PP, effectively amounting to 48 PP. It also comes with erasing the Speed drop from paralysis when switching out, though this can make Mewtwo somewhat difficult to wake up later if it hasn't woken up prior to switching; this is because Mewtwo regularly attracts self-KO move users like Snorlax and Golem, which it can't contest when asleep. Even worse, Swords Dance Mew can often set up and break through Mewtwo right away if not chipped or paralyzed, so it's recommended to incapacitate it with a teammate first. Rest also notably removes Mewtwo's paralysis, and paralysis arguably helps with PP stalling more, as it ensures it doesn't remain passive for extended periods of time.</p> <p>Mewtwo can potentially make use of the strong elemental attacks of RBY—Fire Blast, Blizzard, and Thunder—but they come with significant PP issues. Mewtwo mirrors often result in both losing a very large amount of PP, and putting your own at such a deficit right away frequently results in a loss. Additionally, each comes with its own disadvantage from a status perspective: Fire Blast's burn chance means it can thaw frozen Pokemon, while Blizzard and Thunder have less overall chance to inflict status because of their lower PP. Because Mewtwo often needs the superior status chances, the increased damage output is often just not worth it. This is to say nothing of the accuracy issues, which decrease the consistency of the one Pokemon that you can't afford to be inconsistent. However, the increased damage still leaves them situationally acceptable on teams able to PP stall Mewtwo without using their own Mewtwo; for example, +2 Blizzard or Fire Blast can OHKO Exeggutor, and an unboosted Thunder KOes Cloyster with even minor chip damage.</p> <p>Mewtwo's Attack is very usable, which makes Body Slam and Hyper Beam seem enticing. Body Slam can allow Mewtwo to spread paralysis while dealing physical damage, but compared to everything else Mewtwo can dish out, it's generally unimpressive. Hyper Beam is particularly interesting, as Mewtwo can then KO Chansey from a minimum of 44.6%. Against Mewtwo, a critical hit deals slightly more damage than Self-Destruct. Thus, it can be used as a substitute for BooM2 sets to try and get opposing Mewtwo in range for a critical hit or regular Hyper Beam instead of Self-Destruct. However, against any non-Psychic resistant Pokemon, including Chansey, the damage dealt is almost the same as +4 Psychic. Further, Psychic comes with the bonuses of not requiring a recharge, Special drops to further increase damage, and more attacking PP. Ergo, the only non-opposing Mewtwo reason to use Hyper Beam is for a better Light Screen Chansey matchup, which, while common, isn't omnipresent. If you're looking for a physical option, Submission is often the superior choice for hitting Chansey harder than Hyper Beam and having a significant PP advantage for Mewtwo.</p> <p>Mewtwo has fantastic physical bulk, making Counter appear viable. However, Counter is often best placed on Chansey, a Pokemon with higher potential damage that often draws physical attackers like Snorlax in more consistently. Mewtwo has little opportunity to use the attack, as it's often faced with opposing Mewtwo or Chansey before it even gets the chance to use it. Ergo, should these matchups come down to PP stalling, there is a very high chance that Counter will be revealed by force, ruining the gimmick entirely.</p> <p>BooM2 sets can arguably run Seismic Toss to make KOing opposing Mewtwo with Self-Destruct easier, making it a much more effective lure. However, fitting this into the set is extremely difficult and worsens its matchups against essentially anything other than Mewtwo, which it can't often afford. It's also possible to drop Amnesia entirely on these types of sets to add more coverage options or secure a slot for Recover, but this has seen little success.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mewtwo: Mewtwo is arguably the best check to itself. The combination of Amnesia and Recover means your standard Amnesia set has a lot of trouble breaking through, requiring three critical hits in a row with Thunderbolt or Ice Beam to get the KO. Using Self-Destruct is one way to attempt to break through an opposing Mewtwo, but this requires sacrificing your own, and even then you only OHKO with a critical hit. This means even using Self-Destruct requires you to have the team support and setup necessary to finish Mewtwo off. Another option is having enough PP to successfully stall Mewtwo out; Submission is a great way to accomplish this, thanks to the 48 PP it offers. However, it oftentimes simply comes down to which Mewtwo will be frozen first, as getting a freeze often leaves nothing left to handle a boosted Mewtwo.</p> <p><strong>Freezing</strong>: Thanks to freeze being the virtual equivalent of a KO, freezing Mewtwo is often the best way to deal with it. Common Pokemon like Jynx, Starmie, Slowbro, and Chansey run Ice Beam or Blizzard, which both carry a 10.1% freeze chance. Additionally, these Pokemon are typically able to take a hit from even a boosted Mewtwo, meaning every turn spent against them carries a degree of risk. Managing to freeze the opponent's Mewtwo is a way to gain massive momentum, freeing up your own Mewtwo or Slowbro to wreak havoc with their biggest check out of the way.</p> <p><strong>Light Screen Chansey: As a testament to just how powerful Mewtwo is, the phenomenal special wall Chansey must run Light Screen to truly be a check. However, it's one of the most consistent Mewtwo checks in the game. A Mewtwo boosted to the 999 cap only possesses a 17.4% chance to 4HKO with Psychic through Light Screen. With Ice Beam and Thunderbolt, it's only a possible 6HKO. Chansey is one of the most consistent methods of overflowing a +6 Mewtwo's Special as well, using Psychic's Special drop chance and subsequently forcing a switch. Additionally, Chansey often has a significant PP advantage. This means Chansey can wall Mewtwo and force it to burn precious PP while healing off the damage it deals. However, even Chansey isn't safe. Psychic's 33.2% Special drop can degrade Light Screen and make Chansey much more vulnerable, making it arguably a temporary solution. Submission also 2HKOes it 86.7% of the time, making for a great anti-Chansey measure. Chansey is also a magnet for freeze attempts, which can be either a sigh of relief for your own Mewtwo or a catastrophic situation depending on your team's defensive integrity and Mewtwo set.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew has some interesting tricks that can allow it to check, set up on, or otherwise handle Mewtwo. With paralysis support and Swords Dance, it can set up to +4 Attack and then 2HKO with Earthquake while virtually never being 3HKOed in return by 999 Special Ice Beam or Thunderbolt. At +6, Mew is capable of OHKOing Mewtwo with Hyper Beam. Alternatively, some Mew variants simply opt to use Swords Dance and then Explosion to erase Mewtwo from the battle without any doubt. Defensively, Mew can use Transform to copy Mewtwo's stats and moves. Transform leaves Mew vulnerable for a turn, but the player gains crucial information about the opposing Mewtwo's set, walls it completely, and gains 5 PP for each move it holds. This 5 PP resets each time Mew uses Transform, meaning it is able to PP stall the opposing Mewtwo. It's not like Transform Mew only has the opposing Mewtwo's attacks either, as it can run other options to cripple it prior. These include Thunder Wave, Explosion to take a big chunk out of its health, Reflect to increase defensive integrity while transformed, and Soft-Boiled to stay healthy. Unless Mewtwo lands multiple critical hits or inflicts status, Mew is able to come in and check it somewhat consistently. However, Mew is far from an ironclad Mewtwo check; without paralysis support, Mewtwo is able to muscle through Mew on most occasions through brute force, as well as often ruining it completely with an untimely freeze.</p> <p><strong>PP Stall</strong>: Stalling Mewtwo out of PP is another way to deal with it, usually attempted with your own Mewtwo or Light Screen Chansey. Once it runs out of attacking PP, it's little more than a status absorber. However, accomplishing this is much easier said than done. With its monstrous Special, critical hit rate, and coverage, PP stall can sometimes be in vain, as crucial team members can fall to a freeze or massive damage. If Mewtwo lacks Thunderbolt, Slowbro is able to stand in its way, stalling PP while setting up its own brutal sweep. Thanks to its own Amnesia and Rest, Slowbro has a good chance to win one-on-one as well.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralyzing Mewtwo can open opportunities for powerful Pokemon such as Snorlax, Tauros, Mew, Golem, and Rhydon. Getting in on a paralyzed Mewtwo and being able to fire off big hits or threaten Explosion or Self-Destruct often forces it out. However, paralyzing Mewtwo can actually benefit it, as it can now no longer be frozen or put to sleep, and skipping turns with paralysis lets Mewtwo PP stall more effectively. Generally, Mewtwo despises being paralyzed early on, as it loses momentum against Mew, Snorlax, and Mewtwo specifically tailored to break through opposing Mewtwo. However, later on, when Mew and Snorlax have likely been taken out, Mewtwo tends to appreciate paralysis more. If you have the tools on your team to take advantage of a paralyzed Mewtwo early on, then it is absolutely worth it, as finding a way to break the opposing Mewtwo without risking your own is a key way to win consistently in RBY Ubers.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro: Slowbro is a fairly notorious check to non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo, being able to set up freely or even PP stall it if all goes well. The only risk to Slowbro in this scenario is a freeze from Ice Beam, which can be somewhat made up for with Rest preventing further status. Slowbro can also muscle past non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo through Thunder Wave and +6 Surf, which will eventually 4HKO a +6 Mewtwo and deal mortal damage otherwise. However, if Mewtwo has Thunderbolt, Slowbro will be 3HKOed even at +6 if Mewtwo is also at +6.</p> <p><strong>Self-KO Moves</strong>: The sheer power of Self-Destruct and Explosion makes them common methods of dispatching Mewtwo, primarily because it's often the highest-value Pokemon on its team and normally the most threatening. These strategies are at their most potent when Mewtwo is paralyzed, as it ends up becoming slower than the strongest users of self-KO moves in the game, namely Snorlax and Golem. While not even a STAB Self-Destruct from Snorlax will OHKO Mewtwo, it will often leave it in a position to be revenge killed by Pokemon like Tauros. Snorlax can also use Body Slam and then Self-Destruct, which is a guaranteed KO. Self-Destruct Mewtwo sets are often expressly made to trade against opposing Mewtwo too, and it's often paired with deadly sweepers like Slowbro, which become significantly more threatening with Mewtwo off the table. While their Explosions are quite weak, Gengar and Electrode also tend to Explode against Mewtwo, coming very close to OHKOing it on a critical hit.</p> ",

          "name": "Standard",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Mewtwo's defining set makes full use of the incredible Amnesia. With its astronomical Special, Amnesia leaves it almost impossible to switch into until it's scouted and just as hard to KO with special moves. A Mewtwo boosted up to the maximum of 999 Special can only fall to three or more critical hit special attacks. This tremendous bulk and Recover allow Mewtwo to stay healthy while hammering away. However, after these two mandatory moves, Mewtwo's coverage is impressive and has multiple viable options, making it a multifaceted threat able to plow through just about everything. The coverage options you choose will largely decide what your Mewtwo's primary role is.</p> <p>Mewtwo's STAB Psychic is one of the scariest no-drawback moves in the game. A 33.2% chance to drop Special as an added bonus can allow Mewtwo to muscle through something like Light Screen Chansey. The Special drops can also be used to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, allowing paralyzed Mewtwo to outspeed an opposing paralyzed Mewtwo or incapacitate it for something else to handle; because of this, a paralyzed Mewtwo isn't out of the game just yet. Finally, Psychic has a significant benefit in causing an opposing +4 Mewtwo's Special to overflow if it doesn't have a \"SafeTwo\" stat spread, which consists of 13 DVs and 8 EVs in Special to ensure it starts at 341. Unfortunately, with the bevy of Psychic-types in Ubers, Mewtwo's targets are often resistant and thus take Psychic decently before striking back. Common examples include Exeggutor, Slowbro, Mew, and opposing Mewtwo.</p> <p>Slotting in Thunderbolt gives Mewtwo some unique coverage possibilities while bringing its PP up to 104. Mewtwo is now able to easily beat Slowbro; if both boost to the 999 cap, Mewtwo still 3HKOes with Thunderbolt, and that's to say nothing of its 25.39% chance to OHKO with a critical hit. Thunderbolt also gives Mewtwo access to paralysis. While the odds are slim, this can help Mewtwo and teammates immensely against opposing Mewtwo and Chansey. You're statistically likely to get at least one instance of paralysis from Thunderbolt's full PP, so it's fair to fish for it. On the downside, using it in the third moveslot means Mewtwo lets Exeggutor in for free, as it's only 3HKOed by a 999 Special Psychic from full HP; it can then use this opportunity to spread status or use Explosion. You also lose out on the potential to freeze by forgoing Ice Beam, which can really hurt against Chansey, Mew, and opposing Mewtwo. Also, paralyzed Mewtwo can inadvertently allow Rhydon a free switch should it use Thunderbolt or Recover, which puts it in a very difficult spot, as Rhydon can fish for Substitute on full paralysis and 3HKO with Earthquake from there.</p> <p>Ice Beam slots in nicely alongside Psychic, and the biggest reason is the 10.1% freeze chance. While the coverage is nice to help deal with Exeggutor, Ice Beam's primary draw is to freeze opposing Mewtwo, or less ideally, one of its major checks, like Chansey. This can open up the entire game and oftentimes win it outright. However, Slowbro is able to soak up this set's hits and use Amnesia, Thunder Wave, and Rest to have a good chance to beat Mewtwo head-on. Additionally, while Starmie doesn't pose much of a threat offensively, it can also paralyze Mewtwo or attempt to freeze it; it can take at least one hit from a Mewtwo with this coverage boosted up to 999. Opponents must be careful though, as +4 Psychic will 2HKO Starmie. Another drawback to this set is the mere 96 total PP, which can often become crucial when battling against other Mewtwo and trying to break down Chansey. This makes freezing the wrong Pokemon possibly quite deadly, as opposing Mewtwo tend to win from there through PP stall. When using Psychic + Ice Beam, it's best to avoid paralyzing the opposing Mewtwo in favor of winning by PP stall or freezing it.</p> <p>Even without a STAB option, Mewtwo still threatens the entire metagame with BoltBeam coverage. Instead of using its STAB Psychic, it can combine the coverage and benefits of Ice Beam and Thunderbolt while reaching 104 PP. While lacking Psychic means it no longer KOes the powerful and Self-Destruct-using Snorlax after some chip damage, the coverage allows Mewtwo to deal with almost everything else. It gains the advantage against both Slowbro and Exeggutor while bearing a 10.1% freeze chance for opposing Mewtwo, Mew, or Chansey. Since it handles almost the entire metagame besides these three Pokemon and Snorlax, it can blow the game wide open by freezing one of them. One drawback to this set is that, if your opponent has both Chansey and Mewtwo active, it will only be able to take out one while being walled by the other because of relying on a freeze. However, you can use Thunderbolt to attempt paralysis, meaning Mewtwo isn't completely shut down and can still help its team against these threats. Boosted up to 999, Mewtwo is able to OHKO Slowbro, Exeggutor, Tauros, and Starmie to name a few, making this combination a Swiss Army knife that is very difficult to deal with.</p> <p>A unique option that Mewtwo can run is Submission. First, Submission holds a whopping 48 PP, bringing the total to 128 if using Ice Beam, or 136 if using Thunderbolt. This lets Mewtwo win PP wars against opposing Mewtwo consistently while having the advantage against Chansey. One must be careful of getting frozen though. Submission destroys Light Screen Chansey, one of Mewtwo's most common adversaries, without risking PP stall. Submission Mewtwo has an 86.7% chance to 2HKO, and with its high critical hit ratio it has a decent chance to OHKO. The primary drawback of this set is only running one special coverage option. Running Thunderbolt is the most common, as this allows Mewtwo to beat all of its most common checks, these being Chansey via Submission, Slowbro via Thunderbolt, and opposing Mewtwo via PP stall. However, this set struggles against Exeggutor and Rhydon, often allowing Explosion or status from the former and giving a free switch in to the latter. Ice Beam can be chosen over Thunderbolt to alleviate this, making the set weak to Slowbro but gaining the advantage against Exeggutor and Rhydon. Having a freeze chance is never bad either. Psychic, on the other hand, should not be chosen here; alongside Submission, it simply leaves Mewtwo vulnerable against too many common Psychic-types.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>By bluffing the standard set with Amnesia and your chosen coverage option, this Mewtwo can lure in the opposing Mewtwo, occasionally paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and then use Self-Destruct after some chip damage. Self-Destruct also comes with the bonus of beating set-up Slowbro, which is otherwise a common check to the set.</p> <p>Self-Destruct will KO opposing Mewtwo from 52.2% minimum, which means two uses of +2 Thunderbolt will set it up. It's recommended to run Thunderbolt, as well as paralysis support, to make it harder for the opposing Mewtwo to heal its way out of Self-Destruct range with Recover. Other options tend to only make this set worse, as matching up worse against Slowbro usually forces Mewtwo to use Self-Destruct. The normally ubiquitous Recover can be dropped for Thunder Wave, which guarantees that Mewtwo can use Self-Destruct before the opposing one can heal out of KO range. Naturally, this also means Mewtwo itself should avoid getting paralyzed whenever possible, or it becomes very difficult to succeed.</p> <p>This set carries inherent risks, as Self-Destruct is naturally inconsistent: it being absorbed by Gengar or Rhydon can be a game loss, and less common Mewtwo sets using Flash or even Barrier match up extremely well against it. However, it remains viable for the sheer reward the trade can provide. If supported by Seismic Toss Chansey, the set can be more consistent at securing trades, as two uses of Seismic Toss can also put opposing Mewtwo in KO range.</p> "

          "name": "Staller",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Mewtwo can focus on stalling, which can be approached in two ways: Flash or Barrier. While they play differently in practice, the aim is very similar, that being stonewalling opposing Mewtwo. Because of the long-term role of these sets, the \"SafeTwo\" Special stat is highly recommended; the given spread gives Mewtwo a Special stat of 341, which ensures that it hits 1023 Special at +4, meaning that a Special drop does not trigger an overflow. Mewtwo's attacking option on this type of set largely depends on the rest of the team, and it only has one, so care should be taken. Thunderbolt hits Mew and Slowbro while giving Mewtwo the best PP advantage; however, Rhydon becomes extremely threatening, especially if running Flash. Alternatively, Ice Beam lets Mewtwo muscle past Exeggutor and Rhydon, as well as providing the option of freezing the opposing Mewtwo, possibly cutting off the Flash interaction early. STAB Psychic can serve as a generic option on Barrier sets, being the strongest attack Mewtwo has and also giving it the best shot of beating Snorlax before it paralyzes with Body Slam or uses Self-Destruct.</p> <p>The Flash approach aims to gain the most advantage in the Mewtwo mirror match without making a trade, so it should be kept in waiting until that opportunity arises. It works most effectively against Ice Beam Mewtwo, as Flash can decrease the opposing Mewtwo's chance of freezing your own while also giving a PP advantage against all standard sets, totaling to 112 PP with Psychic or Ice Beam, or 120 if running Thunderbolt. This forces the opponent to either switch out and risk losing a Pokemon or stay in and inevitably lose if enough accuracy drops set in. Attacking the opposing Mewtwo is generally unnecessary; stalling its attacking PP is all you need, leaving yourself with a fully boosted Mewtwo to wreak havoc thereafter. This set isn't wholly opposed to being paralyzed—skipping turns is arguably beneficial once the accuracy drops have piled on, though paralysis does drastically decrease its consistency prior to that.</p> <p>The combination of Barrier and Amnesia can be used instead to turn Mewtwo into a sweeper that also has a large PP advantage against opposing Mewtwo, which can be 112 PP with Recover added on, not factoring in offensive options. This alone is enough to PP stall any standard Mewtwo set, allowing you to end up with a fully boosted Mewtwo by the time they run out. It is strongly recommended to get this Mewtwo paralyzed as soon as possible, as this further improves its PP stalling capabilities and ensures it cannot get frozen later. With the assistance of Barrier, exploding on Mewtwo becomes an impossibility without something like Swords Dance + Explosion Mew, which forces the opposing team to PP stall it themselves. Even the mighty Snorlax, with the strongest physical move in STAB Self-Destruct, rarely hits for even a quarter of +6 Barrier Mewtwo's health. This set works especially well against Self-Destruct Mewtwo sets, as they cannot afford a PP war and lose the ability to KO it from half HP due to the Defense boost. While still vulnerable to critical hits, Mewtwo is very difficult to KO after boosting both Defense and Special, often surviving for astonishing periods of time.</p> <p>The main drawback to stall-centric Mewtwo sets is that they often require some momentum to function; Flash usually takes multiple hits to begin making your own Mewtwo difficult to hit, and Barrier sets add more turns of setup time. Ergo, any unfortunate luck during these sequences is often devastating, and making your own Mewtwo less consistent must be for good reason. Additionally, because of the aforementioned lack of coverage and specialized nature, stall-centric Mewtwo sets often end up being weaker to Pokemon other than opposing Mewtwo. Depending on the offensive option of choice, Mewtwo can become weak to any of Chansey, Exeggutor, Slowbro, and Transform Mew. Slowbro is the most notable if not running Thunderbolt, being able to accumulate a sizable PP advantage through Rest while having high enough damage output to muscle past with repeated full paralysis. If running Thunderbolt, though, Light Screen Chansey becomes a big threat if not paralyzed, possessing a PP advantage and enough bulk to shrug off what Mewtwo throws at it. Regardless of offensive option and Mewtwo's sheer power, though, Barrier Mewtwo often has limited attacking PP to punish switch stalling, which is worsened when paralyzed. Ergo, teams using this set should make up for its shortcomings. Explosion Mew, Golem, and Self-Destruct Snorlax make fine choices, often making it easier to break through Chansey and Slowbro. Zapdos or Jolteon can also be effective—especially the latter, which tends to have a more consistent Chansey matchup and has a high critical hit rate to break through Slowbro. Slowbro is also an excellent partner, profiting greatly from a Thunderbolt Mewtwo being incapacitated to set up and sweep later.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Mew is recommended to feature on all of your RBY Ubers teams and is one of only two Uber Pokemon—Pokemon banned from standard first generation play dating back to the earliest Nintendo sponsored tournaments. The mythical Pokemon may learn every TM, but it is uncommon in high-level play to see it without Swords Dance. Mew is the tier's premier physical sweeper; its base 100 stats all around let it outspeed Jynx and Speed tie with Zapdos, have an unboosted Attack stat equivalent to Tauros, and have bulk rivaling Snorlax's. Additionally, Soft-Boiled can capitalize on Mew's impressive bulk and Reflect can enhance it, which also makes Mew one of the top physical walls in the tier; conversely, it can sacrifice itself with Explosion to hopefully take another high-value Pokemon down with it. As a Special sweeper, it is outclassed by its clone, Mewtwo, which has Amnesia and a far superior Special stat, as well as by Amnesia Slowbro. Also, Mew's wallbreaking tool, STAB Psychic, is weaker than Alakazam's and Exeggutor's Psychics due to their higher Special stats.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Kick and Double-Edge are single-turn attacks more powerful than Body Slam, but, in addition to their respective poor accuracy and recoil, they lack Body Slam's paralysis chance. Ice Beam or Blizzard used with Reflect threatens to freeze opposing Mew, and both inflict more damage onto Exeggutor, Golem, Rhydon, and Zapdos before Swords Dance boosts, but both force Mew to give up offensive potential.</p> <p>A couple of consecutive Seismic Toss used without reply can get paralyzed Mew not behind Reflect in Explosion's KO range.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Status: Since Mew has to set up before inflicting heavy damage, even Pokemon with somewhat weak defenses can paralyze it with Thunder Wave before switching out the following turn. Like any Pokemon, Mew doesn't appreciate the sleep status either.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Mew</strong>: Any Mew set with both Reflect and Soft-Boiled is a good Mew answer. Thunder Wave paralyzes Mew, and Swords Dance combined with Explosion can take both Mew out of the picture. Swords Dance-boosted attacks also attempt to KO the other Mew.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Mew without Earthquake generally lacks the means to deal any damage to Gengar, usually firing off a Thunder Wave at most.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Reflect Snorlax is particularly effective against Mew lacking Earthquake, as +6 Body Slam is only a 4HKO against Snorlax behind Reflect. Snorlax can use Rest to recover health and is immune to Body Slam paralysis. It can paralyze Mew with its own Body Slam, though, and can deal at least 74% damage with Self-Destruct—assuming Mew doesn't have Reflect's boost.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon and Golem</strong>: Both Rhydon and Golem can exploit Mew lacking Earthquake. Rhydon's Substitutes aren't broken by even a +6 Body Slam most of the time. In return, Rhydon is extremely likely to 3HKO with Earthquake, assuming Mew doesn't have Reflect up. Golem lacks the same power and bulk as Rhydon but can threaten with a 64% or more damage Explosion. Explosion's usage can be predictable though, and Golem finds Reflect Mew extremely tough to break down. Rhydon manages to dismantle Body Slam variants with Leer or stall with Substitute and Rest.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Although considered to have low viability, Articuno makes for a solid check to the typical Mew; it is immune to Earthquake, and unboosted Body Slam from Mew isn't even a guaranteed 6HKO. Blizzard 3HKOes Mew in return. Articuno can also run Reflect; unlike Snorlax, it isn't immune to Body Slam paralysis, though.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster functions similarly to Articuno, except for it not being immune to Earthquake. It notably suffers from a less-powerful Blizzard but instead has an improved Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Mew is only a match for Reflect Zapdos when fully boosted. In the meantime, Zapdos can deal a minimum of 30% damage with Thunderbolt, forcing Mew to recover, while threatening possible critical hits. Mew recovering, especially from critical hits, gives extra opportunities for Thunderbolt's 10.2% chance of inflicting paralysis—assuming Mew isn't already paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor is resistant to Earthquake and is usually only 6HKOed by Mew's Body Slam without boosts. It threatens Mew out with potential Stun Spore and Sleep Powder. It can also do 58% damage minimum to Mew with Explosion if Reflect is not up.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro can paralyze Mew with Thunder Wave or set up Reflect or Withdraw with paralysis support. Slowbro's Surf has a small chance of 2HKOing at +2 Special.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros, which is faster than Mew when not paralyzed, can take it out with enough critical hits or full paralysis triggerings. Tauros benefits from its immunity to Body Slam paralysis, though the matchup slowly reverses as Swords Dance Mew gains its Attack boosts.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: If necessary, Mewtwo can 2HKO Mew on average at +2 Special. Mew, on the other hand, only 3HKOes at +2 Attack unless it possesses Hyper Beam.</p> ",

Earthquake is generally Mew's most damaging attack, OHKOing Gengar and 2HKOing Golem and Rhydon at +2 Attack. Body Slam hits Zapdos and Exeggutor neutrally, albeit being initially weak; it also aims to paralyze targets including opposing Mew, using paralysis and damage to pressure it to recover or use Explosion. At +6 Attack, Body Slam has guaranteed 2HKOs on every Pokemon that isn't Cloyster, behind Reflect or Defense boosts, or a Rock- or Ghost-type. Hyper Beam provides a more powerful move to finish off targets besides Golem, Rhydon, or Gengar, but additional paralysis support and care to avoid being exploited by Transform Mew are advised. Another downside of Hyper Beam is the risk that +4 or +6 Attack Hyper Beam is weakened by one of Mew's 19.5% likely critical hits, which can cost it the KO and force Mew to recharge.

Body Slam is the slightly preferred choice due to it hitting Exeggutor and Zapdos, which are collectively considered more viable than Gengar and Rhydon. It also has 8 more PP, and Gengar and Rhydon can be baited into weakening themselves fighting Mew's teammates prior to revealing the set.
