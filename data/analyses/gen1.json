    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>For a while, Venusaur was close to obsolete in UU because Victreebel, which was an already fairly uncommon pick, largely outclassed it. However, Victreebel eventually exited the tier for OU, opening a power vacuum Venusaur was happy to occupy. Thanks to this and a few significant metagame shifts, Venusaur has become a permanent resident of RBY UU.</p> <p>Despite its humble origins, Venusaur is a powerful threat. Sleep is deadly in RBY and Venusaur boasts the second-fastest reliable sleep move in UU, behind only Venomoth. While Venusaur is much slower than tier staples like Tentacruel and Kadabra, its Speed tier is still a cut above several bulky Pokemon, like Hypno and Vaporeon, and happens to be shared with Dragonite. It is in these matchups where Venusaur most often thrives, as it can either use Sleep Powder uncontested or fire off its surprisingly powerful Razor Leaf. Venusaur is a threat that can bully Pokemon with Sleep Powder early-game and continue to exert some offensive pressure once a foe is asleep.</p> <p>Like Victreebel before it, Venusaur is notably restricted by its typing; while Poison does grant an immunity to Toxic, it isn't good for much else. It leaves Venusaur quite vulnerable to Psychic from common Pokemon like Hypno, Kadabra, and Electabuzz while making Earthquake deal neutral damage. Combine this with an Ice weakness and you get a Pokemon with numerous troublesome matchups and some difficulty switching in.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Venusaur has a few interesting moves available to it, though most are not especially useful. Hyper Beam is arguably its best alternative, being used over Toxic to hit a few targets for extra damage and finish off foes like Hypno a bit earlier. Rather impressively, it does well over 60% to Kadabra. Just note that dropping Toxic leaves Venusaur much more susceptible to partial-trapping.</p> <p>A Swords Dance set is possible, but it doesn't exactly take advantage of Venusaur's strengths, and other Pokemon like Tentacruel and Pinsir run the move with more consistency.</p> <p>Leech Seed is a possible alternative to Toxic to deal with partial-trapping while also giving Venusaur some health back; it gives roughly as much as Wrap takes away. The move does have higher accuracy than Toxic, but the effect isn't permanent, and it deals much less damage. Leech Seed also has the advantage of affecting Tentacruel, though it is unable to hit Tangela. The move can also be used in tandem with Toxic to continuously escalate Leech Seed's drained health, but setting this up in a real match is much easier said than done.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Haunter: If Venusaur has already used Sleep Powder on something else, Haunter is a pretty big issue. Venusaur's only option is Razor Leaf, which is 5HKO or worse. Haunter can 3HKO it if it's carrying Psychic or 4HKO with Night Shade.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Venusaur's Body Slam isn't particularly strong, so most Flying-type Pokemon can easily scare it away. Dragonite and Articuno take very little damage from any of Venusaur's moves and can 2HKO with Blizzard, though it is only guaranteed for the latter. Dodrio can set up Agility fairly freely in front of Venusaur, as Drill Peck is a 2HKO and Body Slam can't paralyze it. While rare, Moltres performs almost identically to Articuno against Venusaur.</p> <p><strong>Psychic Users: Kadabra is the scariest foe that can exploit Venusaur's weakness to Psychic, as it outpaces Venusaur and 2HKOes it. Due to the risk of a critical hit, Venusaur will almost always switch out, assuming Kadabra is healthy. Note that Hyper Beam is a legitimate threat to a paralyzed Kadabra, however. Hypno also 2HKOes but is slower, so it only really acts as a check if it is paralyzed or if one of its teammates is already asleep. Electabuzz is very likely to 3HKO Venusaur if it has Psychic, though Razor Leaf is also a 3HKO. Interestingly, the uncommon Venomoth is a premier Venusaur check. It effortlessly shrugs off Razor Leaf, outspeeds, carries Sleep Powder and Stun Spore, and 3HKOes with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves: Fortunately for Venusaur, it is faster than most users of Ice-type moves, so it is much less afraid of them than its rival Tangela. Nonetheless, there are a few Pokemon that can outspeed and threaten Venusaur. Tentacruel is the most prominent, as it can use Wrap and score a KO as early as 63.9%. Gyarados doesn't take Razor Leaf very well, but it barely outspeeds and threatens a likely 2HKO with Blizzard. If Venusaur is paralyzed, it becomes a lot more afraid of Pokemon like Vaporeon, Omastar, and especially Dewgong.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Razor Leaf will virtually always land a critical hit, so it provides Venusaur with a reliable and powerful STAB move that gives it a key advantage over Tangela. Its base damage is higher than Raichu's Thunderbolt and even with Tentacruel's Surf. Razor Leaf will always OHKO Dugtrio and Omastar and deal well over 50% to Water-type Pokemon like Poliwrath and Dewgong. The move will also 2HKO Vaporeon 78.6% of the time, making Venusaur the only Pokemon in UU to do so reliably. Some neutral targets take hefty damage as well, with Kangaskhan and Kadabra dropping to two and three hits, respectively. Additionally, Razor Leaf's critical hits make it a very good move for taking out rare Amnesia users like Poliwrath and Golduck. Because Venusaur was unfortunately denied access to Stun Spore, it makes use of Body Slam to try to spread paralysis. This is helpful against common switch-ins like Dragonite, Tentacruel, Articuno, and Kadabra. The move is also Venusaur's best option for hitting some targets that resist Razor Leaf. Toxic reliably prevents Dragonite from setting up Agility + Wrap. It also happens to be Venusaur's best move against Tangela, notably shutting down variants that run Bind. Other, less common users of partial-trapping moves, like Pinsir and Moltres, also prefer to avoid Toxic, though they are more capable of fighting off Venusaur in general.</p> <p>Sleep Powder is Venusaur's most significant move. Working Venusaur into battle against slower foes so it can use Sleep Powder is essential to using it effectively. Most often, Venusaur will try to somehow get in against Hypno. Most simply, Venusaur can just switch in whenever the opponent is likely to switch in a healthy Hypno. Special attackers, especially Kadabra, are quite good at baiting in Hypno; note that this can be done as early as turn 1 by leading with Kadabra. Venusaur can also come in after Hypno, or really any Pokemon, has used Rest and use Sleep Powder to catch a switch-in or put the Rest user right back to sleep. While exploiting Hypno and resting Pokemon is Venusaur's main route to success, it isn't its only one. For example, it can switch well into Dugtrio despite not quite walling it, as it can threaten an OHKO with Razor Leaf in addition to sleep. Venusaur also punishes Substitute Dugtrio exceptionally well, as Sleep Powder breaches the Substitute. Venusaur is also pretty good against Electric-type Pokemon, especially Raichu, but the threat of paralysis makes the matchup a little less desirable. It is important not to paralyze many Pokemon before Venusaur has used Sleep Powder, as many Pokemon can easily wall it once they are paralyzed. Once Venusaur has used Sleep Powder, it will usually will transition right away to using Body Slam to try to paralyze a switch-in. After that, it can serve as an answer to sleeping Water-type Pokemon or an auxiliary check to Dugtrio in the endgame. Venusaur is also fairly common sleep fodder.</p> <p>Venusaur's traits make it a good teammate for several key Pokemon in the UU metagame. Leads like Kadabra and Electabuzz that goad Pokemon like Hypno and Dugtrio to switch in work very well with Venusaur, as they allow it to use Sleep Powder early on before paralysis is spread. Articuno is uniquely suited to partner with Venusaur. It appreciates Venusaur's ability to effortlessly thwart Water-type Pokemon as well as its Sleep Powder, which can make setting up Agility much easier. Articuno, in turn, does well against a lot of Pokemon that can scare or bully Venusaur, like Dragonite, Dodrio, and Tangela. Other wallbreakers and Agility sweepers like Kangaskhan, Persian, Dodrio, and Dragonite appreciate Venusaur for similar reasons.</p> "

Growth works in conjunction with Mega Drain, but it's not really recommended.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gengar, Exeggutor, Zapdos, Moltres, and Articuno are the best counters, as Venusaur really can't do much to them at all and is forced to switch out. Gengar and Exeggutor are especially good counters since Gengar is either resistant or immune to anything Venusaur will use and Exeggutor doesn't mind paralysis too much, and will fire back with a very powerful Psychic. The legendary birds, once in, will be able to scare off Venusaur, but do not want to be switched into a paralyzing Body Slam. Alakazam and Jynx can switch in on a predicted Razor Leaf, but must be slightly more careful of Hyper Beam or Body Slam.

It certainly has access to some great moves with Earthquake and Slash, but it struggles heavily to make an impact in the metagame. This is mostly because of its Fire typing generally not being suitable for UU, since Tentacruel has such a stranglehold on the metagame. To add to this, Charizard's typing makes it weak to the most common types in the tier in Water, Rock, Electric, and, because Fire doesn't resist it in RBY, even Ice. Charizard's main niches are having a speed tie with Tentacruel, immunity to Dugtrio's powerful Earthquake, access to Swords Dance, and a really strong STAB Fire Blast that can land a game-winning burn on Tentacruel or Dugtrio. However, in addition to its other flaws, Charizard suffers greatly from Wrap; faster Wrap users like Agility-boosted Dragonite shut it down, and slower ones force it to choose between switching out and losing Swords Dance or being worn down. In Tentacruel's case, Charizard still has to hope it wins the Speed tie even if it stays in. Overall, Charizard has decent and unique perks that make it a decent late-game cleaner, but it's usually just too difficult to make use of and clear the way for.</p> ",

Swords Dance is essential for it to do any significant damage to many foes, Slash is a near-guaranteed critical hit with Charizard’s Speed, and Earthquake is your best chance for beating Tentacruel with the Speed tie. If you manage to pull off Swords Dance, this set can clean through teams late-game very efficiently. Body Slam is a solid option for its paralysis chance, which could give Charizard a setup opportunity and sweep. This set is extremely fragile, so keeping up the momentum from Swords Dance will be quite the challenge against insufficiently weakened teams.</p> <p>Counter can be used as a fringe option against Persian and Kangaskhan. In the event Charizard can force something out after an Explosion, it can counter said Explosion as they switch, providing massive damage and possibly scoring a knockout. Counter is also useful if you survive a Hyper Beam to fire back during the recharge turn, but this is gimmicky. Toxic is also a nice niche option to check the infamous Agility + Wrap Dragonite, and Hyper Beam is an incredibly strong finisher if one decides to use an even more aggressive set.</p> <p>Charizard gains the ability to pivot with Fire Spin, which is stronger than Wrap thanks to STAB. However, there are better options for this role, most notably Moltres, which has a higher Special stat and access to Agility, and Rapidash, with its better base Speed and access to Agility as well.</p> "

Its unique access to Super Fang allows it to weaken a Pokemon for threats like Dodrio to clean up later or outright KO foes itself with Hyper Beam. Not only that, Raticate also has an interesting special movepool that it can tap into akin to Persian, making it possible to fine-tune for a team. Raticate is also in a very unique Speed tier, being just above Haunter, and is immune to Body Slam paralysis thanks to being a Normal-type. Raticate's 18.97% critical hit rate adds significant volatility to many matchups as well, making it difficult to switch into when also considering Super Fang.

In addition, Raticate has poor special bulk, with attacks like Tentacruel's Surf being a guaranteed 2HKO. This makes it a nightmare to bring in without heavy support or one-for-one trades. Furthermore, Raticate relies heavily on its Speed to make progress, making paralysis a death sentence due to its fragility. Overall, this makes Raticate a high-risk, high-reward Pokemon.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Bubble Beam can replace Blizzard to 2HKO Golem or KO after a Super Fang on the switch. In addition, Bubble Beam's chance to lower Speed can let Raticate beat normally faster Pokemon that switch in expecting a Blizzard, such as Tentacruel. Without Blizzard, though, Raticate doesn't have a good way of stopping Dragonite from setting up, so consider running Toxic over Body Slam if you use Bubble Beam. Thunder can be used for a better matchup against Gyarados, possessing a guaranteed KO after Super Fang. It has little use outside of this, however, as Omastar and Vaporeon are only 2HKOed after Super Fang and will always win prolonged interactions. In addition, replacing Blizzard with Thunder comes at the cost of losing against Dragonite unless Toxic is used. However, it is possible for Raticate to run two special moves at once—usually Blizzard and either Thunder or Bubble Beam—though this comes at the cost of Body Slam's consistency and potentially game-changing paralysis chance.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Haunter: Raticate can still halve Haunter's HP with Super Fang, but Blizzard does extremely poor damage. On the other hand, Haunter can 3HKO Raticate with Thunderbolt or put it to sleep with Hypnosis. Raticate will sometimes win one-on-one thanks to its Speed and Super Fang, but this is not consistent enough to recommend.</p> <p><strong>Omastar</strong>: Omastar resists Raticate's STAB moves, doesn't get OHKOed after a Super Fang, and easily 2HKOes Raticate with Hydro Pump. Omastar can switch in on a Hyper Beam, forcing Raticate out after it recharges and inflicting significant damage in the process. Raticate can use Thunder to try and get a better matchup, but Omastar takes no more than 36.1%, thus still winning one-on-one unless paralysis or critical hits are involved.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Raticate's best qualities are its Speed and access to Super Fang, which forces slower threats to take significant damage before they can land a hit. Ergo, paralysis is a massive threat to its success, and Raticate should avoid chipping threats that can paralyze it. Paralysis's Speed drop exposes Raticate's extreme fragility while further reducing the consistency of Super Fang, making it effectively dead weight in many situations. Threats like Hypno, Tangela, Dragonite, and Electabuzz that can paralyze Raticate force it out unless they're chipped already. Once Raticate has scored a KO, opponents often bring these Pokemon in, causing the Raticate user to lose a significant amount of momentum. It should be noted that Hypno and paralyzed Electabuzz can't switch into Raticate, as Super Fang + Hyper Beam has a favorable chance to KO them outright. Dragonite also can't switch into Raticate, as Blizzard will KO it after Super Fang.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types like Tentacruel and Vaporeon possess very effective ways to force out Raticate. Tentacruel can switch in on Super Fang if it isn't paralyzed and subsequently scare Raticate out with a 2HKO from Surf. However, Tentacruel is threatened with an outright KO from Super Fang + Hyper Beam. Vaporeon, on the other hand, survives Hyper Beam after a Super Fang and can still 2HKO Raticate with Surf.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: Golem's Rock typing lets it easily switch in on Raticate's Hyper Beam and 2HKO it with Earthquake. Should Raticate lack a super effective move against Golem, it is very likely to lose the matchup. However, after a Super Fang, Raticate has a 41% chance to KO Golem with Blizzard and KOes it outright with Bubble Beam.</p> ",

Raticate is best used mid- or late-game, though, where Super Fang is most likely to help its teammates. Raticate is best switched in on passive foes that won't damage it, such as those immobilized by Wrap or about to use Recover or Rest. Smart double switching is also a good way to bring it in. However, bringing in Raticate to revenge kill a threat isn't out of the question either, especially if that threat is a faster Pokemon that has been bogged down with paralysis. Raticate should be playing hit-and-run first and foremost, as not only is it frail, but landing a Super Fang is more than enough to leave foes open to exploitation by Raticate's teammates anyway.</p> "

  "Raichu": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Raichu has a niche in UU as an Electric-type that can threaten Ground-types like Golem thanks to its access to Surf. The combination of Surf and STAB Thunderbolt gives it excellent coverage and sweeping potential that can be difficult for many teams to handle. In addition, Raichu's Speed allows it to tie with the ever-present Tentacruel, as well as Dodrio. On top of that, the 19.53% critical hit rate its base Speed provides makes it surprisingly powerful offensively. It can further increase this Speed while invalidating the Speed drop from paralysis thanks to Agility, which comes with the added bonus of outspeeding Dugtrio. Furthermore, Raichu is quite customizable, possessing a wide movepool with moves like Body Slam and Seismic Toss to make use of.</p> <p>However, Raichu is physically frail, taking significant damage from threats like Dodrio, Persian, and Kangaskhan. In fact, it's not uncommon to see Raichu get KOed by their STAB Hyper Beams from around 80%. This fragility notably comes into play against Dugtrio, which can KO it consistently with Earthquake if it's taken even a minute amount of damage. It's not stellar on the Special end either, with threats like Tentacruel, Vaporeon, Hypno, and Kadabra all claiming 3HKOs on it with their STAB attacks. This has a negative effect on its offenses as well, with its Thunderbolt only 3HKOing Vaporeon and occasionally missing the OHKO on Gyarados. Raichu also competes heavily with Electabuzz for a place on teams, which has higher Speed than tier-king Tentacruel without the need to boost.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Raichu's customizable nature gives it a fair amount of room to explore alternative options without much opportunity cost. However, Thunderbolt and Surf should never be dropped, as they are what allow it to perform well in the tier. If using Agility, Hyper Beam is quite desirable for closing out games against Pokemon like Hypno and Kadabra, which may come in to try and stop a sweep. It serves as Raichu's single best option against opposing Electric- and Grass-types, dealing surprisingly high damage to them and enabling it to break through. Seismic Toss is another appealing option, allowing Raichu to fight Grass-types like Tangela and Venusaur and Electric-types like Electabuzz and opposing Raichu. Surf tends to deal more damage to other Pokemon, though, making Seismic Toss a bit more specific in utility. Thunder has a significant enough damage difference to net Raichu near-guaranteed 2HKOs on Persian, Kangaskhan, Tentacruel, and Vaporeon and an OHKO against Dodrio, but the inconsistency makes it difficult to recommend, especially considering Raichu's fragility. Substitute can be used to give Raichu an opportunity to scout and spread paralysis without needing to predict. It has the added benefit of letting Raichu safely fish for critical hits and full paralysis. It also makes Raichu an even better Dugtrio lure, letting it fish for a critical hit from Surf to OHKO it or paralysis from Body Slam without taking massive damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Tangela is one of the few Pokemon in the tier that resists Raichu's Thunderbolt + Surf combination, and, as a result, Raichu can't do much to it. The only way for Raichu to win is through Seismic Toss, but even then, Tangela's Stun Spore will paralyze Raichu and put it into an awkward position. Tangela will usually use Raichu as setup fodder thereafter, picking up Growth boosts or using it to pivot out with Bind. While less common, Venusaur is also a large threat to Raichu's success, resisting everything thrown at it while threatening with Sleep Powder or a 3HKO with Razor Leaf. In addition, it's only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss, which is, unfortunately, Raichu's best bet at trying to win.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Raichu is extremely frail on the physical side, and there are threats in RBY UU that are well equipped to exploit this. Kangaskhan and Dodrio can KO Raichu from well above half HP with Hyper Beam, meaning all Raichu can do is threaten them with Thunder Wave if it's at full HP. Furthermore, Persian can revenge kill Raichu from half HP with Slash if it hasn't set up Agility. On the flip side, Raichu can fight back hard against all of these threats; none of them want to switch into Thunder Wave, Dodrio falls to Thunderbolt if it's taken any amount of damage, and Kangaskhan takes heavy damage from any special hit. As a result, while Raichu is very threatened by these Pokemon, they really don't want to switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite can shrug off Thunder Wave with its own Agility and KO Raichu with Hyper Beam from 68.7% onwards. This can be facilitated through Wrap, which gradually chips Raichu into KO range; at minimum, it takes five Wrap uses for Raichu to be placed in Hyper Beam range. Raichu can't deal much damage to Dragonite at all, with Thunderbolt dealing less than 30%. As a result, Raichu is forced out.</p> <p><strong>Hypno</strong>: Hypno can take Raichu's attacks quite well by virtue of its excellent special bulk. This, combined with Thunder Wave and the power of Psychic, enables it to check Raichu well. However, it can only check Raichu from full HP, as, otherwise, it's very possible for Raichu to break through with critical hits. Alternatively, Raichu can use Hypno as setup fodder for Agility if it has used Rest, especially if brought in on the turn Hypno uses it, but it needs multiple critical hits to break through in this scenario. Furthermore, it risks paralysis and heavy damage in the process.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raichu tends to struggle against opposing Electric-types, as they take mediocre damage from Surf while resisting Thunderbolt. Electabuzz tends to win one-on-one with Seismic Toss while being faster and threatening with paralysis. Opposing Raichu may also be equipped to win against your own depending on the set, with moves such as Seismic Toss and Hyper Beam further complicating matters for the electric rodent.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Raichu can't stomach Dugtrio's Earthquake if it's taken any amount of damage, and Dugtrio's 23.4% critical hit rate makes it an even more decisive matchup. However, if Raichu has set up Agility or if Dugtrio is switching in, Dugtrio has to risk getting hit with Surf, which 2HKOes it. This also means that Dugtrio has a lot of trouble beating Raichu if it's been paralyzed prior to the interaction. Body Slam is also a risk for Dugtrio, potentially paralyzing it and allowing Raichu to take it out if it's taken damage prior.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Thunderbolt and Surf provide Raichu with nigh-unresisted coverage, making it challenging to counter once it's in safely. Thunder Wave gives Raichu ample opportunity to spread paralysis for its teammates, which can be helpful for forcing out faster threats like Persian and Tentacruel. Agility enables Raichu to double its Speed, making it difficult to revenge kill or pin down with Wrap. This is very important, as, in RBY, boosting Speed allows Raichu to ignore the Speed drop from paralysis. However, Body Slam can be used instead to paralyze threats like Dugtrio switching in and beat physically frail Pokemon like Kadabra.</p> <p>Raichu wants to set up Agility to sweep through weakened teams, and it should be kept healthy so Dugtrio cannot KO it after surviving Surf. As such, Raichu does best mid- or late-game. While setting up can be difficult in RBY UU at times, Raichu has a decent amount of freedom to set up Agility, as it can afford to take a hit if Dugtrio is absent or unable to survive Surf. Forcing out Pokemon like Omastar, which can't handle Raichu's coverage, can also allow Raichu to set up. Sleeping Pokemon can be fairly useful for Raichu to set up against; however, bulkier Pokemon like Hypno may be difficult if the sleep was induced by Rest, as Raichu can't KO it before it wakes up.</p> <p>Raichu tends to find points of entry through Wrap pivots like Tentacruel, ensuring safety from physical attacks. However, it can switch into weaker special attackers if necessary, as well as more passive Pokemon using recovery moves. Thanks to its Speed and coverage, it also makes a good revenge killer, especially after an Explosion, which usually softens up a threat for Raichu to consistently threaten the KO. On the flip side, Raichu's Speed can let it switch in on opposing Wrap, though with repeated switches it may take enough chip damage to enter KO range for strong physical attacks. This only gets worse if the Wrap user pivots out to a counter. Ergo, switching into Wrap even a few times severely limits Raichu's ability to take hits and check threats, so this risk should only be taken if heavy-hitting physical attackers like Dugtrio have been accounted for or removed, or if Raichu can reliably threaten to KO the Wrap user. Raichu finds itself on teams that benefit from its ability to check Rock- and Ground-types that threaten teammates like Dodrio and Persian, making them effective lures for said Rock- and Ground-types.</p> "

This, theoretically, makes Nidoqueen work well as a late-game threat.</p> <p>Nidoqueen's benefits largely end there, though. While it can stomach the strong aforementioned attacks, it's not fast and can't OHKO their users back, so it just gets outsped and KOed one-on-one.

Worse still, it has common weaknesses to Surf, Blizzard, and Psychic, all of which often lead to it getting forced out after a KO by the threat of being revenge killed. Nidoqueen also struggles mightily to break Hypno, a common sight on RBY UU teams, which can threaten it with sleep or a 2HKO from Psychic in return. Even though Nidoqueen has the bulk to avoid some KOs Nidoking cannot, like the 2HKO from Kangaskhan's Earthquake, Nidoking is often superior due to it outspeeding and severely damaging Gyarados and Dragonite.

Furthermore, it has Stun Spore, which lets it keep supporting the team after sleeping a foe and notably cripple Dugtrio. Venomoth compressing both moves saves teammates like Hypno and Haunter from using a moveslot on the less reliable Hypnosis. Its solid base 90 Speed lets it effectively pressure slower threats like Articuno and Dragonite, and it can freely switch in on Toxic to protect its Wrap-using teammates like Dragonite and then threaten the Toxic user with status.</p> <p>However, that niche is largely the extent of its defensive capabilities due to its poor typing and middling stats; the ubiquitous Tentacruel does this anyway while also providing the threat of Wrap. Worse still, Venomoth's typing gives it a weakness to Psychic and no STAB moves to speak of, which, alongside its middling Special, makes its damage output average at best without Special drops from Psychic; Mega Drain doesn't even 2HKO Golem reliably. As if this wasn't enough, Venomoth is physically frail, with Dodrio's Drill Peck nearly OHKOing it and many other physical attackers, like Persian, dealing severe damage with their STAB moves. It competes with Tangela, which possesses more bulk in addition to Bind and a better typing, as a Sleep Powder + Stun Spore user. Overall, Venomoth is strictly used for its utility, and while it does its job well, its niche is fairly specific; there will be times where it's little more than KO fodder.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Generally, the most replaceable move Venomoth has is Mega Drain due to mediocre damage outside of specific targets. Toxic has good utility, as Venomoth can use it when Dragonite attempts to use Agility to negate predicted Stun Spore. This ruins Dragonite's chances of a Wrap sweep, as it would take more damage than it deals. Outside of this, however, Venomoth doesn't have many viable options. Substitute can allow Venomoth to take more hits than usual, giving more opportunities for Psychic Special drops, but since it doesn't block status in RBY, it's a weak choice. Double-Edge can be used to try and hit low-Defense Pokemon, but it falls just short of 3HKOing even Kadabra. On the flip side, with a critical hit, it can deal significant damage and force a Recover, which is a good spot for Venomoth to be in thanks to the threat of Stun Spore.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Kadabra and Hypno: Venomoth has a lot of trouble against threats that resist its Psychic while threatening it, and Kadabra and Hypno are perfectly suited for this, especially if Sleep Clause isn't active. Both can 2HKO Venomoth with Psychic, or even OHKO with a critical hit, which Kadabra has a high 20.5% chance to land. Kadabra is better suited to revenge killing Venomoth, though, as it dislikes getting paralyzed. In most situations, Venomoth can only attempt to cripple either with status and switch out. However, in a lead situation, Venomoth can effortlessly put Hypno to sleep using Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Dodrio</strong>: If Venomoth has taken any amount of damage, it is very likely KOed by Drill Peck. However, Venomoth can at least paralyze Dodrio to diminish its offensive presence; this makes it less inclined to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Normal-type attackers</strong>: Venomoth's physical bulk is poor, which makes Normal-type attackers very threatening. Persian can 2HKO Venomoth with Slash 74.2% of the time and always KO after Slash with Hyper Beam. Kangaskhan can also 2HKO with Body Slam followed up by Hyper Beam. Raticate is capable of using Super Fang to put Venomoth in KO range for its own Hyper Beam. However, none of these Pokemon appreciate being paralyzed, which makes trying to KO Venomoth from full HP very risky.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio: Dugtrio is adept at revenge killing Venomoth, having a guaranteed 3HKO with Earthquake, or a 2HKO with a critical hit involved. While it can use Rock Slide, it deals only .3% more with less accuracy, making Earthquake optimal. Venomoth outright loses the interaction, failing to even 3HKO Dugtrio with Psychic or Mega Drain. The best Venomoth can do is attempt to heal out of 3HKO range using Mega Drain, but it can't recover fast enough to take another hit from the faster Dugtrio. Note that Venomoth can paralyze Dugtrio with Stun Spore, so Dugtrio needs to be warybefore going for the KO. If Dugtrio is paralyzed, it loses virtually all of its utility for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: Golem cleanly 2HKOes Venomoth with Rock Slide. Golem strongly dislikes Mega Drain, which deals significant damage and can potentially allow Venomoth to recover its way out of KO range, but this scenario is rare, as it can only recover a maximum of 26.8%.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>The existence of Sleep Clause makes a second status move in Stun Spore complement Sleep Powder well. Psychic is Venomoth's strongest viable move, hitting for mostly neutral coverage while potentially allowing for more damage with its 30.1% chance for a Special drop and Venomoth's own decent 17.5% critical hit rate. It can 3HKO Tentacruel and, with Special drops, becomes noticeably more threatening across the board, turning 3HKOs into 2HKOs. Mega Drain acts as coverage for Golem and Omastar, the latter of which tends to try and PP stall Venomoth's Wrap-using teammates, while giving Venomoth some staying power in the process.</p> <p>Venomoth is best used early in the game to sleep a foe as quickly as possible, but not as a lead, as its lead matchups are poor outside of Hypno. Tentacruel makes a good lead teammate, using Wrap to bring Venomoth in early if the conditions are favorable. Venomoth can later status threats for Tentacruel and switch into Toxic for other partial trapping move users like Dragonite and Pinsir. Kadabra and Electabuzz are also effective, as they can switch to Venomoth turn 1 to punish their common switch-ins in Hypno and Dugtrio, respectively. Putting a foe to sleep successfully creates a 50-50 situation where Venomoth can either paralyze a switch-in or pressure with Psychic should the foe try to burn sleep turns. After Venomoth has done its job, it should focus on using Psychic to get damage in, no matter how middling, and spreading paralysis when possible. Venomoth mainly finds points of entry against threats with good Special like Dewgong and Vaporeon, as they fail to 2HKO Venomoth and allow it to threaten with Sleep Powder thereafter. It's not reserved to these either, as Gyarados, for example, fails to KO Venomoth with Hyper Beam even after Body Slam, forcing the opponent to sacrifice a Pokemon to sleep. Generally, Venomoth works best on teams with Pokemon that profit from its role compression like Kangaskhan, Dragonite, and Articuno, making use of the holes opened in teams through its reliable sleep. However, what it provides is rather specific, which makes it deceptively difficult to utilize effectively.</p> "

    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Dugtrio succeeds as RBY UU’s most influential revenge killer and sweeper. Dugtrio's fantastic speed tier, perfect coverage, and Thunder Wave immunity give it the perfect combination of traits to fulfill these roles extremely effectively. Regardless of its health, Dugtrio can very easily close games with its powerful STAB Earthquake, especially considering it boasts an enormous 23.44% critical hit rate. As such, keeping Pokemon out of range of Dugtrio is a key aspect of mastering RBY UU; even tier king Tentacruel must be cautious, as it can drop to an Earthquake as early as 79.3%. This offensive prowess forces the majority of competitive teams to include several checks to it.</p> <p>While Dugtrio is incredibly strong, it is not without its flaws. While its typing provides it with good utility, it also opens it up to numerous weaknesses to common attacks such as Surf, Blizzard, and Razor Leaf. This, combined with its extreme frailty, causes it to crumble when confronted with any sort of offensive pressure. In addition to this, several Pokemon are either immune or resistant to its Earthquake, most notably Dragonite, Gyarados, Aerodactyl, and Tangela. This culminates into Dugtrio having a much more polarized matchup spread than other notable revenge killers, such as Persian or Kadabra. Regardless, Dugtrio remains one of the common and potent threats in the tier for which every team must prepare.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Generally, Dugtrio doesn't need any moves outside of its main set. Body Slam can be nice to paralyze checks such as the relatively uncommon Aerodactyl, but the only Pokemon you will commonly see that Dugtrio doesn't naturally outspeed is opposing Dugtrio. Even worse, Body Slam is only useful against opposing Dugtrio on the switch, as either Dugtrio can 2HKO the other with Earthquake one-on-one. Another severe downside of using Body Slam is its damage output in comparison to Slash: whereas Slash can do 30% to Gyarados, Body Slam does half that. Where Slash lets Dugtrio 4HKO Tangela and potentially catch it at half health while it switches in, Body Slam can't even reliably 6HKO Tangela. Sand Attack could be used to pray for misses in desperate scenarios, like when Dodrio is about to set up and run over your team or Dugtrio is your last Pokemon left and needs to land multiple critical hits. It can also stop Dragonite from setting up Agility and sweeping through your team with Wrap, but it's less reliable than Toxic and has its effect nullified by switching. It can technically be used to severely reduce Tentacruel's Wrap accuracy, though the only time Dugtrio should be facing Tentacruel is if it is in Earthquake KO range anyway.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Paralysis: Dugtrio relies heavily on its Speed to stop foes from capitalizing on its weak defenses, which makes paralysis so deadly for it. Dugtrio is immune to Thunder Wave, but Stun Spore—used commonly by Tangela and the rare Venomoth—and Body Slam—from attackers like Kangaskhan, Gyarados, and opposing Dugtrio—can cripple Dugtrio for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attacks: In general, Dugtrio is unable to take more than one attack without fainting, so any strong attack—such as Kangaskhan's Body Slam and Hypno or Kadabra's Psychic—hitting it should enable any other Pokemon to pick it off. Even worse, many common special attacks, such as Articuno's Blizzard and Surf from Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar, are super effective and will OHKO Dugtrio.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Flying-types are most teams' main defensive answers to Dugtrio, as they can switch into its Earthquake and threaten it out with heavy damage, if not an outright OHKO. Dragonite is best at dealing with Dugtrio, as the threat Dragonite poses with Agility and Wrap is so significant that Dugtrio often has to stay in and use Toxic, which can come at the cost of Dugtrio taking a Blizzard and being put at 20% health or lower. Gyarados is similar in its ability to answer Dugtrio, and while it lacks the threat of Agility + Wrap to keep Dugtrio from switching out, it is much harder for Dugtrio's teammates to force out due to its superior defensive typing. Aerodactyl can switch in on Dugtrio's Earthquake with impunity and 2HKO it, but it struggles to switch in on Rock Slide. Dodrio and Articuno are the last two common Flying-types that teams use to check Dugtrio. While they are significantly frailer than Dragonite and Gyarados, respectively 3HKOed and 2HKOed by Rock Slide, they can both OHKO Dugtrio with their STAB attacks and threaten to run through its team after an Agility boost.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Poliwrath, and the rare Dewgong can take Earthquake multiple times while KOing Dugtrio with their STAB Surf and using Rest to remain healthy and answer Dugtrio over the course of a match. However, Dugtrio's critical hit rate can allow it to bypass these answers if they are below 75% health, and Dewgong can't repeatedly switch into Rock Slide without being forced to use Rest.</p> <p><strong>Tangela and Venusaur: Tangela is one of the best Dugtrio answers in RBY UU, taking almost no damage from Earthquake and threatening Dugtrio in return with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore. Tangela can also heal off any chip damage it sustains on the way in with Mega Drain, and it can potentially use Dugtrio as an opportunity to begin accumulating boosts with Growth. Venusaur is similar in this regard, coming in on Earthquake and threatening to put Dugtrio or a teammate to sleep with Sleep Powder or OHKO Dugtrio with Razor Leaf. However, Venusaur is worse at checking Dugtrio than Tangela due to its worse bulk and Ground neutrality.</p> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: If Kangaskhan is healthy, it can switch into Dugtrio's Earthquake and threaten to cripple or KO Dugtrio with its STAB Body Slam or Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Persian and Hypno</strong>: While they can't switch in, Hypno and Persian can win the one-on-one matchup with Dugtrio from full health if it doesn't land a critical hit.</p> ",

Many of these targets can be put in KO range with a small amount of chip damage or a critical hit. Dugtrio also outspeeds all threats to Tentacruel besides opposing Dugtrio, which lets it worry less about its frailty. Earthquake's high power combined with Dugtrio's high critical hit chance makes Dugtrio an effective wallbreaker and general attacker. Through Rock Slide, Dugtrio can hit all Flying-types for super effective damage, further limiting how often the opponent can let Dugtrio come on the field before they start losing Pokemon. The next move is commonly Slash, which stops Tangela from completely walling Dugtrio and can act as a safe midground option to avoid reading whether opponents will switch to a Flying-type or not. Substitute is another option for Dugtrio's third move to make it an even more effective late-game sweeper. Dugtrio can set up a Substitute while the opponent switches to sacrifice a team member at low health, and it can then close out the game against a weakened team that can't break the Substitute and force Dugtrio out. The last moveslot is dedicated to Toxic, as it prevents Dragonite from freely coming in on Earthquake and setting up Agility safely.</p> <p>Dugtrio acts as a late-game sweeper and a potent offensive threat. Using Dugtrio optimally is a delicate balancing act of making the most of its limited opportunities to come onto the field while also keeping it as healthy as possible, a balance that often separates novice players from veterans. Partial-trapping moves—most commonly Wrap—are one of the primary ways Dugtrio can be brought onto the field safely, since they both provide the chip damage needed to bring targets into OHKO range and allow Dugtrio to switch in while the opposing Pokemon is unable to attack. Therefore, Wrap users such as Dragonite and especially Tentacruel make for excellent Dugtrio partners. Tentacruel is the best Dugtrio partner in the game; not only does it provide Wrap support and benefit from Dugtrio KOing primary answers to it after minor chip damage, such as opposing Tentacruel, Kadabra, Electabuzz, and Raichu, but it takes very little damage from Blizzard and Surf aimed at Dugtrio. The opponent's Tentacruel using Wrap is another common way Dugtrio can get onto the battlefield safely, as Dugtrio takes relatively little chip damage from Wrap while outspeeding and KOing the opposing Tentacruel if it is sufficiently weakened. A teammate using Explosion or fainting is another common entrance point for Dugtrio, as its high Speed and damage output allow it to act as an effective revenge killer. Other good opportunities for Dugtrio to enter the battlefield include sleeping Pokemon, a predicted switch, a recovery move that doesn't let the foe escape Dugtrio's KO range, and Electric-type moves such as Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt. Frequently, Dugtrio will be able to clean up teams that have been weakened to the point where it can OHKO every remaining Pokemon; this is a relatively common win condition in RBY UU that should always be kept in mind over the course of the game. Learning to capitalize on opportunities to set up this endgame while simultaneously hindering an opponent carrying Dugtrio from doing the same is an important skill for UU players to learn.</p> "

    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Persian's Speed and access to STAB Slash help make it a premier revenge killer and late-game sweeper in RBY UU. Outrunning every relevant Pokemon except Dugtrio, Persian can almost always make use of its high damage output from Slash. In addition, this high Speed makes Persian effective against Wrap users, most notably Tentacruel, allowing it to switch in and threaten to damage them with Slash or cripple them with Toxic. Persian will usually KO at least one Pokemon during a game thanks to the sheer power of Slash. Persian's bulk is also appealing, surpassing that of other fast threats like Kadabra and Dugtrio, allowing it to function much more effectively late-game. This bulk also makes it more viable to switch in on moves like Body Slam, which can't paralyze it thanks to Persian being Normal-type. All things considered, Persian is a UU staple.</p> <p>However, Persian's attacking stats are a bit middling, making Slash its main form of damage. To make matters worse, Persian is particularly lacking in physical coverage, with only Hyper Beam available as a second viable option. As a result, Persian relies on its middling special movepool to cover for Pokemon that resist Normal-type moves, making it relatively easy for Pokemon like Haunter to come in and threaten it. Persian is also crippled by paralysis in a big way, as it relies heavily on its Speed to sweep and threaten Wrap users, so it can be forced out by paralysis inducers if it can't KO them first.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Persian can utilize Body Slam over Toxic to assist teams poor at distributing paralysis. However, its damage is a far cry from Slash or Hyper Beam, relying heavily on Persian's innately high critical hit rate. However, Thunderbolt can be removed instead at the price of coverage should a team not require either of them. Screech can be used alongside Hyper Beam to KO sooner than Slash + Hyper Beam, though the foe can switch out to try and force a recharge, thus leaving Persian at risk of being paralyzed or even KOed. As a result, this option is very risky. Bubble Beam lets Persian fight Golem, and the Speed drop can allow it to knock out Dugtrio, but it doesn't help in many other matchups.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Haunter: Haunter is the only viable RBY UU Pokemon that's immune to Slash, which makes it an excellent counter to Persian, preventing it from making any progress until Haunter is KOed. As such, it's best to keep Persian hidden until Haunter has been removed. Persian's Thunderbolt is only a possible 6HKO, while Haunter can 4HKO using its own Thunderbolt or threaten sleep from Hypnosis. So long as Haunter is active, focus on KOing it or baiting it into exploding.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis Inducers</strong>: Electabuzz, Kadabra, and Raichu all threaten to end Persian's run using Thunder Wave, which makes it noticeably less threatening overall. However, should they be in KO range, Persian is capable of shutting them down before they get the chance to do so. As a result, these are only checks if they are at full HP. Hypno is also notable for being among the only paralysis inducers not 2HKOed by Slash, though Hyper Beam can KO it from half health, and Persian is excellent at exploiting it as it uses Rest. Tangela can utilize Mega Drain to save itself from a Slash 3HKO and paralyze Persian with Stun Spore. Dragonite is also notable for its bulk, easily taking a Slash and paralyzing Persian in return. While Persian can use Toxic to outdamage Wrap from Dragonite, it's still problematic for the cat due to its significant damage aside from Wrap.</p> <p><strong>Kangaskhan: Kangaskhan 2HKOes Persian with Body Slam + Hyper Beam. If Kangaskhan is already in a tight spot, such as in 2HKO range from Slash, it can still use Hyper Beam to deal at least 65% damage to Persian, putting it in range for Dugtrio to revenge kill it. In addition, Kangaskhan has access to Counter, which allows it to situationally hit Persian or a switch-in for massive damage. This makes it a fair absorber of Hyper Beam as well; the subsequent Counter outright OHKOes Persian if it hits a high damage roll.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Articuno can use Agility to outspeed Persian and 2HKO it with its nuclear Blizzard. This makes it a fine check. In addition, it's only 3HKOed by Persian's Slash 57.2% of the time, allowing the opponent to take risks if needed. However, a critical hit from Thunderbolt puts Articuno in range of Hyper Beam. Furthermore, consecutive critical hits from Thunderbolt can 2HKO it should Hyper Beam not be used.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Omastar resists Persian's Slash and can 2HKO it in return with Hydro Pump. Persian can try using Thunderbolt, but it's only a 4HKO, so a critical hit is needed to outdamage Rest's healing. Alternatively, Poliwrath makes a decent check, coming in on Slash to use STAB Submission and put Persian in KO range of a subsequent attack. However, Persian's Slash is still a very favorable 3HKO, so Poliwrath isn’t necessarily consistent.</p> <p><strong>Golem: If Persian lacks Bubble Beam, Golem stonewalls it while possessing a very favorable 2HKO with Earthquake. Furthermore, Golem is an excellent counter to Hyper Beam sets, being able to comfortably absorb the hit and deal significant damage in return. Plus, it doesn't fear Bubble Beam from full health unless Persian lands a critical hit. However, Golem can't necessarily switch in on Persian if its moveset hasn't been revealed, as it risks losing half its health from Bubble Beam.</p> ",

Thunderbolt allows Persian to hit bulky Water-types—especially Gyarados—for better damage with a paralysis chance as a bonus. Toxic most notably allows Persian to poison Dragonite using Agility, making a Dragonite Wrap sweep near impossible; however, Dragonite's offensive presence outside of this remains significant. Alternatively, Hyper Beam can be used over Toxic for a slight boost in power, which can be crucial when taking down Pokemon like Electabuzz and Kadabra, which threaten it with paralysis. The KO ranges for Hyper Beam aren't much larger than Slash, though, so it should only be used if you want Persian to be a sweeper.</p> <p>Persian's playstyle is fairly straightforward; it is a cleaner that revenge kills when possible. Generally, Persian should be used once Pokemon that can paralyze it or resist Slash have either been KOed or put into KO range. Persian can often switch into weakened Tentacruel attempting to use Wrap, as Persian forces it out by the threat of a KO. Persian's other likely point of entry is your own Tentacruel's Wrap, which gives Persian an excellent shot at KOing foes outright with little to no opposition. Persian is also excellent at coming in on Pokemon using Rest, 3HKOing even bulkier threats like Vaporeon and Hypno.</p> "

It's not limited to just Slash either; Persian's special coverage, bolstered by its 22.46% critical hit rate, means that it isn't simply countered by typical Normal-type answers like Rhydon and Cloyster. This lets it pressure cores reliant on Snorlax and Cloyster as their physical checks. Persian's great Speed also allows it to outrun Tauros and tie with Starmie, which makes it an effective revenge killer. When paired with the tier-king Tauros, Persian can form a powerful sweeping core that can be very difficult to stop late-game.</p> <p>However, Persian should never be considered a replacement for the rampaging bull, and this is partly why it's never seen true OU prominence. Persian is very reliant on its Speed and, ergo, very weak to paralysis—moreso than Tauros—exposing its meager bulk and making revenge killing very difficult. Due to this weakness, Persian is often forced out by Thunder Wave users like Alakazam. As a result, Persian regularly mandates multiple Pokemon to fall back on while offering little to no defensive utility in return. Additionally, Persian is reliant on Slash to a fault, dealing middling damage using anything else. Because of these factors, Persian is by no means a standard in RBY OU, but it is nonetheless a viable pick for more offensive teams.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Persian's fourth moveslot is fairly expendable, but its movepool is far from impressive. Body Slam allows Persian to scout while spreading paralysis for its teammates, though the damage isn't impressive. However, it's more consistent than Hyper Beam while dealing significantly more damage than Slash if it lands a critical hit, making Persian more effective at getting past Reflect Snorlax. Alternatively, Screech can be used alongside Hyper Beam to OHKO Pokemon like Starmie, creating mind games to encourage switches. It also gives Persian a very helpful way of checking for Counter from Chansey and Snorlax, potentially getting it off for free. Thunder 2HKOes Cloyster and deals more damage to Starmie, but its consistency leaves much to be desired.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Gengar: Persian can't fight Gengar at all, possessing only its special coverage to have even a hope in doing so. Even Thunder only has a vague chance to 5HKO it, so Persian is often forced out while giving Gengar free rein to use an uncontested Hypnosis or force damage onto your team. Ideally, Gengar should be accounted for and dispatched before even revealing Persian.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Persian can't handle paralysis, which makes its bulk much more apparent and easier to exploit. Worse still, being paralyzed completely diminishes Persian's potential to revenge kill, making it little more than food for opposing Snorlax and Tauros. Many Pokemon, like Exeggutor and Lapras, possess strong attacks that can even 2HKO it with little consequence when it's paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Starmie: Starmie is capable of stomaching Slash + Hyper Beam while Speed tying Persian, which, on top of its access to Thunder Wave, makes it very capable of downing the cat. Persian is capable of winning against a paralyzed Starmie, but it will often rely on full paralysis to win from full HP.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax is capable of 2HKOing Persian with Body Slam if it's taken any prior damage, and Snorlax possesses the bulk necessary to stomach three hits of Slash. However, if Snorlax isn't healthy or is using Rest, Persian can use Snorlax as an opportunity to switch in and threaten to deal serious damage. If Reflect Snorlax attempts to stall Persian with continued uses of Rest, Persian does have a 6.5% chance to 3HKO with Slash, which can be realized in continued interactions.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: With its fantastic bulk, Exeggutor can win against Persian one-on-one, threatening with Sleep Powder, Stun Spore, or a 2HKO from Psychic. However, it will take massive damage in the process, often being forced to use Explosion much sooner than usual.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: While 2HKOed by Bubble Beam, Rhydon is capable of threatening Persian, as it can 2HKO Persian with Earthquake while resisting Slash. Due to it effectively forcing Persian to use Bubble Beam, it can pivot to a specially bulky Pokemon like Alakazam to switch in with relative impunity unless a Speed drop occurs. Ergo, defeating Rhydon with Bubble Beam can actually be quite difficult, so Bubble Beam should be seen as a way to encourage it to switch out and force Slash damage onto the opposing team.</p> ",

Amnesia also assists Golduck defensively, making it very difficult for conventional Water-types to KO and allowing it to PP stall them using Rest. Golduck's Speed is also fairly decent—tying it with Articuno and Pinsir—which lets it get the jump on Dragonite before it can set up Agility.</p> <p>However, Golduck has a myriad of issues that prevent it from seeing play. The main problem is that its good coverage falls flat in RBY UU due to the many bulky Water-types such as Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Dewgong, all of which stonewall Golduck. Furthermore, Tentacruel makes actually getting mileage out of Golduck a nightmare, outspeeding it to delay its setup and chip it down with Wrap until it's placed in KO range. Golduck is fairly vulnerable to physical attackers like Kangaskhan that love to punish its Rest, blowing past it with their STAB moves.

Rounding out the set is STAB Fire Blast, which hits reasonably hard and has a relatively high chance of burning the opponent on hit, which can totally ruin an opposing Tentacruel, Dugtrio, or Kangaskhan.

Seismic Toss can help with Starmie, Alakazam, and other Psychic-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Starmie is probably the best counter, as it resists Poliwrath's attacks and so can easily stall it out until it scores a critical hit with Thunderbolt. Alakazam takes off almost half of its HP with Psychic, even after one Amnesia, and it can also use Thunder Wave or Seismic Toss. Jolteon and Zapdos have the powerful STAB Thunderbolt and will critical hit Poliwrath quite frequently; Jolteon especially may critical hit immediately, and Zapdos has Drill Peck to take off a little under half Poliwrath's health (but doesn't like Blizzard). Dodrio also employs Drill Peck to easily 2HKO Poliwrath, and may score a critical hit on the first use. Venusaur and Victreebel will do major damage with Razor Leaf, though Poliwrath ties with the latter in Speed and does major damage to each with Blizzard.

Fighting-types are weak to Psychic and Flying, but an Amnesia on the switch helps with its weakness to Psychic, and not many Pokemon have Flying-type moves. Its amazing physical defenses almost rival Slowbro's, and Slowbro can't score a sleep or outspeed many Pokemon that attempt to explode on it without paralyzing them first. One overlooked option on Poliwrath is to use Rest, which can work out really well when your opponent expects you to use another move in its stead. If you get up a couple of Amnesias first, your opponent will be hard-pressed to KO Poliwrath if you have it.</p> "

        {"name": "Amnesia", "description": "<p>Ideally you should take care of Starmie or Alakazam before you try to play this, since it's very unlikely that Poliwrath will beat those, unless it can sleep them. To set this up, try to Amnesia on the switch from the Pokemon you just slept with Hypnosis; Poliwrath is faster than Exeggutor, Chansey, Golem, and Rhydon, and has a move that will do major damage to each of those, so it's not too difficult to pull that off. Use Blizzard if you fear Dodrio, Zapdos, or Razor Leaf users; after Amnesia, it can OHKO Dodrio and 2HKO Zapdos, Venusaur, and Victreebel. Submission will 3HKO Snorlax and 2HKO all the other Normal-type standards. Just watch out for Counter!</p> "}

    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Even though Kadabra isn't fully evolved, it is one of the premier choices in RBY UU due to its base 105 Speed and base 120 Special. These stats give it a high volatility factor, with a 20.5% critical hit rate combined with the 33.2% chance of a Special drop from an already powerful Psychic. It outspeeds many other Pokemon in the tier and can either hit them hard or cripple them with paralysis. This includes the ever-present Tentacruel, which is outsped and takes massive damage from the strongest Psychic in the tier or loses a lot of its effectiveness if paralyzed. This makes Kadabra an effective anti-lead choice, as Tentacruel is perhaps the most common lead in UU. Due to Kadabra's high Special stat, it can also switch in and tank special attacks surprisingly well.</p> <p>However, Kadabra is not quite in the conversation for being the best Pokemon in the tier. It is walled hard by Hypno, arguably the second-best Pokemon in RBY UU behind Tentacruel. It's almost a given that when your Kadabra is in, your opponent's Hypno will not be far behind, as Kadabra can only really chip it with Seismic Toss or fish for a Special drop with Psychic. In addition, Kadabra is pitifully frail on the physical side, with only base 40 HP and 30 Defense. It has to watch out for Persian especially, which outspeeds it and hits it hard with STAB Slash. Many other physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Dodrio can 2HKO or even OHKO Kadabra, meaning that you need to tread carefully, especially if Kadabra is paralyzed. That said, its positives as a strong and fast Psychic-type far outweigh its negatives, and it can find a place on most RBY UU teams.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>If you're replacing any move, Seismic Toss is the one to replace. Counter can surprise physical attackers and net some surprise KOs, especially in the niche scenario where you use Explosion with Haunter or Golem and then bring Kadabra in and Counter your own Explosion. Counter can also force Hypno to have to use Rest sooner if it is spamming Seismic Toss. However, your own Seismic Toss is generally a better and more consistent damage dealer, especially to opposing Psychic-types. Reflect can be used to increase survivability, but even with this Defense boost, Kadabra is still pretty frail; it still takes over 50% on Hyper Beams from some of the stronger physical attackers in the tier, such as Kangaskhan and Dodrio. Again, Seismic Toss is almost always the better choice here.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Hypno: Hypno is easily the best check to Kadabra, as it's on the vast majority of RBY UU teams anyway and stonewalls everything that Kadabra tries to do. If you bring in Kadabra to attempt a revenge kill, you can be sure that your opponent will bring in Hypno to negate your plans with ease. Hypno can easily tank Psychic and is only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss, meaning that it can recover off any damage Kadabra deals and rid itself of Thunder Wave paralysis with Rest. Therefore, outside of getting lucky with Special drops from Psychic or full paralysis, you probably won't be KOing Hypno with Kadabra, and Kadabra will most likely need to use Recover and switch out. Worse still, Hypno can paralyze Kadabra with Thunder Wave, hampering its usefulness for the rest of the game, or even put it to sleep with Hypnosis, which is normally a death sentence in any RBY tier.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Kadabra</strong>: Kadabra also does a decent job at checking itself. If the opponent's Kadabra is already paralyzed, it can switch in to absorb a Thunder Wave from your Kadabra. From there, it can threaten with its own Thunder Wave. Most Kadabra versus Kadabra matchups start with them paralyzing each other, and then it becomes a battle of Seismic Toss and Recover until one switches out or faints.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio gets a special mention as a check because it can switch in on a Thunder Wave for free and threaten a KO on Kadabra if it is at 70% health or below. Dugtrio is one of the few Pokemon that can outspeed Kadabra and 2HKO it; unless Kadabra scores a critical hit with Psychic, Dugtrio wins the head-to-head matchup from full health. Furthermore, since Kadabra is the best Tentacruel check in the entire tier, it often comes in on Wrap to wait out the attack and then scare out Tentacruel once it ends, but since Wrap immobilizes Kadabra and does chip damage, Tentacruel can whittle Kadabra down just enough so that Dugtrio can switch in while Kadabra is unable to attack and is in the range of Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Due to Kadabra's low HP and Defense, many strong physical attackers threaten it. To start, Persian outspeeds Kadabra and easily 2HKOes with Slash, meaning, much like Dugtrio, it wins the one-on-one from full health unless Psychic lands a critical hit. Dodrio and Kangaskhan are both outsped by Kadabra and don't like being paralyzed, but they have a guaranteed OHKO on Kadabra with Hyper Beam, making them scary to face. Raticate also can OHKO Kadabra 74.4% of the time with Hyper Beam, putting it in a similar category to the aforementioned Normal-types. Other physical attackers that can OHKO Kadabra with Hyper Beam include Dragonite and Gyarados. Though these attackers have much lower chances to OHKO, they are still scary in their own right with Body Slam. Finally, Aerodactyl has proven its worth in RBY UU and can outspeed and KO Kadabra from 74.9-88.3% health with Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Articuno: Articuno, though not as common of a selection as some previously mentioned Pokemon, is similar to Hypno as a check because it can sponge hits and heal off damage and paralysis with Rest. Both Psychic and Seismic Toss are only 4HKOs on Articuno, meaning that it should be able to survive most encounters. Articuno can also use Agility to shrug off the paralysis Speed drop and become akin to a Hustle sweeper in later generations with a 75% chance to move. What makes Articuno an especially good check, however, is that it can 2HKO Kadabra over 80% of the time with two Blizzards, or always 2HKO with Blizzard into Hyper Beam. Add in the threat of freeze with Blizzard or Ice Beam, and Articuno is a check that can send Kadabra running.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This is the bread-and-butter set that you'll see virtually every Kadabra run, and for good reason. As mentioned before, Kadabra has the strongest Psychic in the tier and will hit pretty much everything except Hypno and opposing Kadabra for consistent damage. Thunder Wave is used to paralyze foes, most notably dangerous Wrap users like Tentacruel and Dragonite. After paralysis, Wrap only connects about 66% of the time, which severely hampers the Wrap user's effectiveness. Seismic Toss is Kadabra's go-to damage option against Hypno and opposing Kadabra, and Recover increases Kadabra's longevity, especially over the course of long games where you may need to PP stall opposing Psychic-types. For example, against Hypno that may opt for Hypnosis over Seismic Toss, Kadabra will have the upper hand.</p> <p>Using Kadabra is an exercise in how well you can spread damage with Psychic and paralysis with Thunder Wave while avoiding it taking physical attacks and paralysis yourself. This can mean having to predict your opponent's switches, which is not always an easy task. This is why Kadabra appreciates Wrap users like Tentacruel and Dragonite on its side to get a free switch-in. Once switched in, Kadabra's job is made a little easier because just by using Psychic, it can get good luck with its naturally high 20.5% critical hit rate and 33.2% chance to drop the other Pokemon's Special. That said, relying on that volatility can put Kadabra in a bad spot against Pokemon that can exploit its physical frailty. Clever switching or a Thunder Wave to catch and paralyze such an attacker may be what is needed to turn the tide of battle in your favor. Just keep in mind that your opponent could have Dugtrio lurking to absorb paralysis, and then your Kadabra could be in trouble, as Dugtrio outspeeds Kadabra and KOes it with Earthquake if it is at about 70% health.</p> <p>Kadabra is certainly not dead weight when it's paralyzed, as paralysis actually allows it to switch in against sleep users, such as Hypno and Haunter, with little fear. However, it does become harder to use and much easier to revenge kill. Thus, pairing it with a Ground-type that can absorb opposing Thunder Waves like Dugtrio or Golem is a good choice. Just be sure that your Ground-type has enough health to deal with the Thunder Wave user it is switching into. In addition, Flying-types such as Dragonite, Articuno, and Dodrio can help deal with the aforementioned Dugtrio problem by switching in for free on an Earthquake. Haunter is also a good partner for Kadabra given the prevalence of strong Normal-type moves in RBY. Haunter is immune to these moves that can KO Kadabra easily, as well as Wrap. Bulky Water-types such as Omastar and Vaporeon can also check these strong physical attackers. Haunter and Omastar notably form the strongest anti-Wrap core in RBY UU; this is a godsend for a physically frail Pokemon like Kadabra. They pair well with Kadabra because wasting sleep turns against Wrap users to wake Kadabra up is not ideal, as Kadabra takes 6-7% from Tentacruel and 9.1-10.9% from Dragonite on each hit.</p> "

  "Alakazam": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>In a generation where Psychic-type attacks are only resisted by the same type, and because its only weakness may as well not exist, it's not surprising that Alakazam is an incredible threat in RBY OU. Alakazam is most commonly seen in the lead slot due to possessing excellent Speed and access to Thunder Wave; it outspeeds every Pokemon that has access to a sleep move, allowing it to immediately cripple them with paralysis. It also has the strongest Psychic in OU by virtue of its excellent Special and as such can heavily pressure its most common checks. This Special stat also makes it a decent sponge for opposing moves like Psychic, though its HP limits this slightly. It is also good at absorbing sleep, since it resists Exeggutor's Psychic. Unlike Starmie, Alakazam doesn't have a weakness to Thunderbolt, which can come in handy for absorbing sleep from the likes of Gengar and Lapras. Alakazam can also prove to be very effective outside the lead slot, maintaining excellent utility against various threats and potentially turning into a dangerous sweeper if its most common checks have been removed. However, it can be difficult to consistently keep Alakazam safe from paralysis; if paralyzed, Alakazam often finds its low Defense being exploited by strong physical attackers such as Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros. It's also very reliant on its Psychic, which means it is difficult to break past Chansey. Overall, Alakazam is a regular presence in RBY OU and one of the best Psychic-types available, but its extreme vulnerability to strong physical attacks and paralysis keeps it firmly below the top of the pyramid.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder Wave, Psychic, and Recover should never be dropped. Though the last move is somewhat flexible, Alakazam's movepool is very shallow, so it should generally stick to the options mentioned. Counter has some utility when forcing out threats after the opponent KOed one of your Pokemon with a hard-hitting Normal-type attack from high health, such as Explosion, Self-Destruct, or Hyper Beam. This can be used to force damage against whatever switches in or even outright KO it. It also has situational use in Alakazam mirrors, as countering Seismic Toss can leave the opposing Alakazam severely weakened.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon can hit Alakazam through its weak Defense and KO it, especially if it's paralyzed. They should try to switch in on Recover, though, as Psychic will do a big chunk of damage to all of them. Snorlax deserves a special mention for early-game, as it's crippled way less by paralysis and Psychic damage than the other Pokemon mentioned. Rhydon can also switch in on Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Almost all Psychic-types can check Alakazam, although most of them can be broken through with paralysis and Special drops. Although it generally should not come out early-game, Slowbro is particularly dangerous, as it can set up on Alakazam safely and heal its paralysis with Rest. Starmie and opposing Alakazam can also take Alakazam's Psychic and Seismic Toss and threaten it in return with their own attacks and paralysis, but these matchups can swing either way with repeated full paralysis or Special drops from either side. Surf variants of Starmie are especially dangerous, as they can deal heavy damage to Alakazam. Jynx can be used to check Alakazam in an emergency, but it is passive when doing so, vulnerable to critical hits, and better used for other tasks.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Alakazam is a special attacker, and like all special attackers, Chansey makes a decent check. Chansey can attempt to paralyze Alakazam and pressure with Seismic Toss and to a lesser extent Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. This can force Alakazam to heal with Recover, allowing the opponent to switch into a physical threat. However, due to Psychic's secondary effect, paralysis, and Alakazam's high critical hit rate, Chansey will eventually be forced to either use Soft-Boiled or switch out. Should it get unlucky with full paralysis when trying to use Soft-Boiled, it can even be KOed. It's common to see Chansey switch in on a lead Alakazam and take a Thunder Wave to block sleep later. It can then attempt to put Alakazam to sleep with Sing on the next turn. Chansey can also attempt to fish for a freeze with Ice Beam if Alakazam isn't paralyzed, though this is risky.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor can switch into Alakazam on Turn 1 to immediately try to put it to sleep. However, the opponent would need to be content taking paralysis and getting hit by at least one Seismic Toss, which reduces the longevity of Exeggutor. This makes it much worse at checking Rhydon later in the game. If you try to prevent Alakazam from being paralyzed by switching to Chansey, the opponent gains a huge advantage, as Exeggutor can outspeed Chansey and put it to sleep. In general, though, Exeggutor checks Alakazam well. However, it struggles to pressure Alakazam enough before getting worn down by Seismic Toss, often forcing it to use Explosion.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Alakazam is one of the best leads in RBY OU. Since it's the fastest lead that regularly sees use, it's almost guaranteed to be able to immediately cripple something from the start of the game, be it through paralysis or serious damage with Psychic. This means Alakazam is great for pressuring opposing leads. Against other Alakazam, one generally wants to paralyze it and try to get a physical attacker like Snorlax in on a predicted Recover. However, be careful to not leave the field too damaged, as Exeggutor can have Double-Edge or Hyper Beam to pressure Alakazam. Generally, you don't want to switch out at less than 80% in order for Alakazam to avoid the 2HKO from Exeggutor's Double-Edge most of the time. Gengar leads generally switch out against Alakazam due to the threat of a 2HKO from Psychic as well as an OHKO with a critical hit. Starmie should generally be approached the same way as an opposing Alakazam. However, one must be wary of Chansey when using Thunder Wave early on; its extreme bulk turns it into a phenomenal sleep blocker when paralyzed. As a result, it becomes very difficult to put anything to sleep until the now-paralyzed Chansey is KOed.</p> <p>A lead Alakazam's role, besides crippling the opposing lead, is mostly to absorb sleep. If used in this fashion, Alakazam should absolutely be running Seismic Toss. This allows Alakazam to hit Starmie and Exeggutor rather than waste Psychic's PP. Lead Alakazam can also be used to absorb paralysis from those who propagate it, such as Chansey, Starmie, and other Alakazam. This especially goes for Chansey without Seismic Toss. It's also effective against Starmie without Surf or Psychic, the latter of which can force Alakazam out after a few Special drops. Alakazam also tends to attract physical attackers like Snorlax, Tauros, and Rhydon on a forced Recover turn. If you can correctly predict the switch, you might be able to sneak in a Thunder Wave or Psychic on them. Moreover, due to Alakazam being one of the few pure special attackers that can force Chansey out, it is also an efficient paralysis spreader that can be used as such throughout the course of the battle.</p> <p>In some situations, you might still resort to using non-lead Alakazam as if it were in the lead slot to check or pressure opposing Pokemon such as Chansey and Starmie. It can also be used to function as a sweeper late-game. This strategy revolves around keeping Alakazam hidden, then attempting to clean up once its checks have been removed. Reflect can be used on sweeper Alakazam to give it a much-needed Defense boost, but it also means Alakazam will only have Psychic to attack with. In addition, Reflect Alakazam can still be taken care of through paralysis, critical hits from Tauros and Zapdos, and Explosion. Explosion is especially pressing if paralyzed, as even if Reflect Alakazam survives, it's still easily revenge killed by threats such as Tauros. However, Seismic Toss remains very usable in this context for beating Starmie and other Psychic-types more consistently.</p> <p>When using Alakazam as a sweeper, the rest of the team should work on removing Alakazam's checks before it's revealed. These checks include special sponges such as Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey. Pokemon that resist Psychic, such as Slowbro and Exeggutor, are also important to remove. For maintaining maximum sweeping potential, Alakazam should also try to avoid paralysis as much as possible, as its Speed is the reason it's able to compete with other late-game sweepers for a team slot. Ideally, Tauros should also be put in range of Psychic to avoid its high critical hit rate and Body Slam's paralysis chance. Fortunately, that can easily be accomplished through a Tauros mirror, a common scenario in RBY OU battles, since two Body Slams will leave the opponent's Tauros in said range.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>With STAB Fighting-type haymakers at its disposal, Machamp can look enticing to the average player. Being as fast as Exeggutor ensures it edges out and 2HKOes Chansey with even Low Kick, which many Pokemon simply cannot achieve. Similarly, Machamp has the potential to give Tauros and Snorlax trouble, albeit to a lesser extent due to a deathly fear of paralysis. It's also got some fair physical bulk and a handy resistance to Rock Slide, allowing it to switch into and threaten Rhydon. This boils down to solidifying Machamp as a straightforward attacker that benefits strongly from paralysis support.</p> <p>Machamp's main problem is that while nearly every team includes the \"Big 3\" Normal-types — which Machamp can excel against in a flat one-on-one — a Psychic-type usually isn't far behind them. Machamp simply can't deal with Psychic-types, often failing to muster even a 2HKO on most and taking massive damage in return. Ergo, while Machamp hits like a freight train, it offers little defensive utility, which often opens gaping holes in its team. Additionally, Machamp despises paralysis, as what little Speed it has is what ensures it can threaten the Normal-types it wants to go after. When looking for a Pokemon to pummel paralyzed teams, Rhydon is often a better choice, possessing much greater defensive utility, immunity to Thunder Wave, and generally superior STAB moves. Machamp is thus a rare sight in RBY OU and generally isn't recommended.</p> ",

Thanks to this, Machamp can potentially 2HKO a paralyzed Chansey — a very common sight in RBY OU — before it can muster a response. Alternatively, Submission can be used for more power, allowing Machamp to 2HKO Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros, albeit at the cost of significant recoil. Body Slam lets Machamp be a little more self-sufficient, paralyzing potential switch-ins to turn the tables on them. Hyper Beam is Machamp's strongest Normal-type attack, allowing it to KO Pokemon that otherwise shrug off its STAB move. Alakazam is a noteworthy target, as it can end up being 2HKOed switching in if it's paralyzed by Body Slam first. Finally, Earthquake ensures Machamp isn't completely helpless against Gengar, 2HKOing it and Jolteon.</p> <p>Machamp has a wide offensive movepool, allowing it to fine-tune itself to fit a team. Using both Submission and Low Kick can let Machamp 2HKO Tauros, allowing it to more cleanly win a one-on-one interaction. Fire Blast deals up to 34.6% to Exeggutor with a high burn rate that can ruin its Explosion. Counter can be effective with Machamp's stat line, allowing it to switch in on a Hyper Beam and score a guaranteed OHKO on Pokemon like Tauros and Snorlax. This also applies when switching into Snorlax's Body Slam and Chansey's Seismic Toss; both Pokemon will often switch out in response, allowing Machamp to severely damage the switch-in. Since Machamp struggles a bit against Reflect Chansey, Karate Chop can be a serviceable option, being what's effectively a 100-Base Power Normal-type move that ignores Reflect thanks to its near-guaranteed critical hit rate. Unfortunately, Machamp's Speed leaves Karate Chop short of the 99.6% cap, making it a tad inconsistent. Finally, Rock Slide can be used for better matchups against Articuno and Zapdos, but it falls short of 2HKOing the latter, which makes it questionable.</p> "

However, teams that fixate only on spreading paralysis are quite flawed, and other slow powerhouses such as Golem tend to fit on them better than Machamp. The low Speed means it also cannot deal with any of the partial-trapping move users in UU, even getting Bind locked by Tangela. This slowness is compounded by its Psychic weakness and mediocre Special bulk, meaning threats like Hypno, Kadabra, and even Electabuzz can exploit it.

Earthquake OHKOes Haunter and 2HKOes Kadabra and Tentacruel while being a decently strong neutral hit on most foes when Submission's recoil is undesired. Rock Slide allows Machamp to hit Dodrio and Articuno hard, and it can KO the latter from 80% HP and below. Note that Rock Slide cannot 2HKO Dragonite, meaning Machamp usually still ends up as setup fodder for it. Body Slam lets Machamp attempt to spread paralysis while scouting for switch-ins, allowing it to outspeed them the next turn. Alternatively, Hyper Beam is a devastatingly strong attack that can finish off many paralyzed and slightly weakened threats, giving Machamp some late-game sweeping potential.</p> <p>Toxic can be used to cripple partial trapping move users like Dragonite, Tangela, and the rare Pinsir, causing them to take more damage than they deal when using them. This notably helps against AgiliWrap Dragonite, which can otherwise cause a game-ending scenario. Alternatively, Fire Blast can attempt to burn Tentacruel, which is immune to Toxic, as well as cripple Dragonite, though it is much less reliable than Toxic in the latter case. Fire Blast also 3HKOes both Venusaur and Tangela and can cripple physical attackers that switch in such as Dodrio and Gyarados. Counter is another solid option, as Machamp's high HP is well suited for use of this move. It can switch into Hyper Beams and deal back massive damage while the foe is recharging, and it can also OHKO Persian using Slash. However, if the opponent is aware of Counter, they can easily play around it, causing it to lose most of its value. Low Kick is a niche alternative to Submission that trades power for accuracy, no recoil, and a flinch chance. Low Kick opens up paraflinch strategies that can surprise opponents. For example, Machamp can use Low Kick to chip a paralyzed Dodrio or Gyarados into range of its Rock Slide and have a better chance of defeating them than relying on paralysis alone. However, Low Kick misses crucial 2HKOs on Dewgong and Kangaskhan from full HP. Machamp necessitates paralysis support to be effective, so it enjoys the company of Hypno, Electabuzz, and Kadabra. These Pokemon also make up for Machamp's weaknesses, as Hypno and Kadabra resist Psychic while Electabuzz resists Flying. Body Slam users such as Dodrio and Kangaskhan can also assist in spreading paralysis to help enable Machamp.</p> "

It can also Speed tie Cloyster while outpacing Chansey, Snorlax, and Rhydon.</p> <p>However, Psychic and Blizzard are extremely common moves in the metagame, and most staples that use either will 2HKO Victreebel at minimum. This, in addition to its middling Speed, makes Victreebel a difficult Pokemon to get mileage out of. It mandates paralysis support to reach its full potential while providing little to no defensive utility in return. Its mediocre Speed also makes paralysis particularly devastating, almost completely erasing its threat potential. Victreebel is also walled by Gengar, as its coverage is almost completely restricted to Normal- and Grass-type attacks. Overall, despite being solid on paper, Victreebel tends to struggle in practice.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Victreebel can use Swords Dance alongside Hyper Beam as a surprise set to become an even more threatening late-game sweeper. Victreebel's +2 Hyper Beam is nothing to scoff at; it OHKOes Alakazam on the switch in and even has a small chance to OHKO Chansey. Such power often forces a foe out, which can allow Victreebel to sneak in some status. Swords Dance can, alternatively, be used on the Wrap set to boost its net damage output, but it is very hard to justify over the conventional options. On the whole, Swords Dance is very difficult to fit on a set, since losing Wrap or a powder move makes Victreebel very specialized and more reliant on the opponent losing to it on the spot. Body Slam can be used to give Victreebel an option to threaten both sleeping and unstatused Pokemon at the same time, alleviating the burden of prediction, but the opportunity cost of running it above other moves is generally too high to be worth it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Victreebel has major issues dealing with faster threats due to its poor defensive typing and stats. Many of the fast threats in RBY OU, such as Alakazam and Jynx, deal serious damage to it, and Victreebel can't do much back on its own. Faster threats will try to absorb the hits from Wrap, wait for it to end, and then force Victreebel out with their powerful STAB moves. Situationally, however, such matchups can sway in Victreebel's favor. For instance, Starmie can try to paralyze Victreebel and get OHKOed by Razor Leaf in return. Tauros can attempt to wait out Wrap, but Stun Spore will leave it seriously crippled and unable to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Gengar: Gengar is immune to Hyper Beam as well as Wrap's damage, and it resists Razor Leaf, leaving Victreebel with little in the way of options for defeating it. To make matters worse, Gengar threatens to put it to sleep with Hypnosis, which can end up dooming Victreebel due to its fragility. All Victreebel can do is status it or switch out. Wrap can be used to immobilize it on the switch in, though, allowing Victreebel to switch out to another Pokemon safely.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis almost completely nullifies Victreebel's potential. All foes suddenly become faster than it, which means it can no longer use Wrap safely. Full paralysis is very dangerous as well, putting the odds of hitting Wrap in the first place around a mere 66%. Many fast threats, such as Alakazam and Starmie, threaten to paralyze Victreebel before it can even move. Even slower threats, such as Chansey, can paralyze Victreebel if Wrap ever misses.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>The rare Sleep Powder gives Victreebel among the most consistent sleep options in the game, putting a potential counter out of commission for what's likely the rest of the game. Wrap's extreme power in RBY OU should be emphasized, especially because Victreebel is among its best users; it prevents foes from attacking, wears down teams, and lets its user uniquely pivot out of any check for free by immobilizing it for a turn. Its imperfect accuracy, though, means Victreebel is always vulnerable to a counterattack after an unfortunate miss. Razor Leaf acts as a very strong STAB attack that not all teams are necessarily prepared for. Stun Spore lets Victreebel spread its own paralysis without support from teammates, which can be crucial when a faster Pokemon such as Zapdos attempts to switch in. It can also be used should Tauros come in after Victreebel lands a KO, but this risks immense damage or even Body Slam paralysis. Given the threat level of Tauros, though, it can be worth the risk. Hyper Beam can be used instead of Stun Spore to finish off foes more quickly to minimize the cumulative risk of Wrap misses.</p> <p>It should be noted that bringing in Victreebel is quite difficult, as almost every threat in the metagame has a move that hits it for super effective damage, and if they don't, they likely have a way to paralyze it. Due to this, Victreebel is generally restricted to coming in on passive Pokemon, such as those that have used Rest. However, smart double switching is also a good way to get Victreebel into the game early. It's best to use Victreebel after the most natural Wrap answers, mainly common fast Pokemon such as Alakazam, Jolteon, and Zapdos, have been crippled with paralysis. This makes it very difficult for the opponent to fight back against Wrap without a smart switch-in or an unfortunate miss. Wrap can also be used to punish paralyzed foes trying to switch in on Sleep Powder; this can even lead to the paralyzed Pokemon being KOed outright. However, bulkier foes that aren't threatened too much by Razor Leaf can absorb Wrap and subsequently pivot into a faster threat, such as Starmie. This strategy keeps Victreebel from actually KOing a paralyzed Pokemon or putting a non-paralyzed one to sleep unless it is used with excellent prediction.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Tentacruel is a centralizing force in RBY UU and is often claimed to be the face of the tier. With Speed rivaled only by a few threats, such as Dodrio, Tentacruel puts immense pressure on teams throughout a game, sometimes even right out of the gate as a lead. With near-perfect coverage in Surf and Blizzard, amazing Special, and the incredible utility of Wrap, it's capable of forcing out even bulkier threats that could otherwise check it. In addition, being Poison-type, Toxic will fail against it, removing vital counterplay to Wrap. Due to the sheer utility of its fast Wrap, Tentacruel is seen on virtually every RBY UU team, as it can dominate anything slower than it such as Articuno or Hypno.</p> <p>However, despite its imposing presence in RBY UU, Tentacruel's part-Poison typing gives it glaring weaknesses to Psychic- and Ground-type attacks, which can lead to it taking immense damage if it switches in poorly. Tentacruel really dislikes paralysis too, which almost completely diminishes its Wrap utility, and accounting for this is pivotal to its success.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance can be utilized, sometimes alongside Hyper Beam, to make Tentacruel more of a sweeper. It can work excellently alongside Wrap, boosting its chip damage and KOing Pokemon earlier from the sheer damage of a boosted Hyper Beam. Swords Dance is most helpful when both players only have their own Tentacruel to answer the other's, giving yours the opportunity to win the mirror. However, outside of this situation, Rest is usually the better option. Hydro Pump can be used for more damage, but the accuracy and drop in PP are very noticeable in prolonged games.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Paralysis Inducers</strong>: Tentacruel is severely crippled by paralysis, and any fast threat that can inflict it, such as Kadabra, Raichu, or Electabuzz, can be a very pressing issue for it. The chance of full paralysis coupled with Wrap's accuracy leaves Tentacruel with a roughly 66% chance to connect Wrap, which makes the risk-reward factor less than favorable when Wrap pivoting out of bad matchups instead of just switching out. The Speed drop combined with this causes Tentacruel to be a significantly less effective Wrap user and leaves it vulnerable to slower threats like Hypno and Gyarados; Gyarados makes it much more difficult for Tentacruel to use Rest to heal up. Kadabra and Electabuzz, being faster than Tentacruel and possessing enough bulk to avoid a 2HKO from Surf, are capable of switching into Tentacruel directly and threatening it with Thunder Wave. However, it is often safer for the Kadabra or Electabuzz user to send in a Water-resistant Pokemon to bait Wrap and then switch either Pokemon into the locked-in move. Since Kadabra and Electabuzz are faster than Tentacruel, they can wait out the Wrap turns and threaten 2HKOs with their STAB moves. It should be noted, however, that a critical hit from Surf severely hurts Kadabra, forcing it to use Recover and letting the Tentacruel user switch to something like Hypno to maintain momentum and potentially spread status. Electabuzz and Raichu, on the other hand, still threaten to take Tentacruel down after a critical hit from Surf.</p> <p><strong>Haunter: Haunter has enough bulk to avoid a 2HKO from Tentacruel's STAB moves and won't take chip damage from Wrap, although it is still immobilized. Due to its strong Thunderbolt, Haunter can force Tentacruel out and make it waste Wrap PP. However, if Haunter has already been damaged, it may be forced to use Explosion instead. It should be noted that a Thunderbolt and subsequent Explosion from Haunter can KO Tentacruel, but low rolls from Thunderbolt can let it survive. If this happens, the next attempt to revenge kill Tentacruel should force it to switch out. Critical hits from Surf can deal severe damage to Haunter, however, likely forcing it to use Explosion regardless.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio is the fastest threat in the tier and can 2HKO Tentacruel with Earthquake. However, its fragility makes Surf a guaranteed OHKO, so Dugtrio is limited to a revenge killing role. Tentacruel should attempt to stay out of OHKO range, ideally being at 80% HP or more, but this is a tall order in many situations.</p> <p><strong>Persian</strong>: Persian is faster than Tentacruel and can 2HKO it with Slash if it has taken any prior damage. As a result, if Persian switches in, this often forces Tentacruel out. However, Persian should be wary of a critical hit Surf, which has a 25.6% chance to OHKO it. Furthermore, if Persian has taken any prior damage—such as from repeated Wrap uses—it is knocked into 2HKO range for Surf.</p> ",

Rest provides Tentacruel with additional staying power and gives it a way to alleviate paralysis should it switch out after using the move. Tentacruel's bulk and typing are usually enough to let it wake up; it can often burn sleep turns by switching into opposing Wrap. If paralyzed, however, it's usually unable to use Rest against Wrap users. In this case, using Rest against Vaporeon, Omastar, or resting Hypno is a viable strategy, as switching out after will remove the Speed drop from paralysis.</p> <p>Tentacruel can be used as a lead thanks to the utility of Wrap, providing immediate momentum as the game opens. This is most effective against sleep leads like Hypno and Haunter that are slower than it. Note that while Wrap won't deal damage to Haunter, it will still be immobilized. However, faster threats such as Kadabra and Electabuzz can threaten Tentacruel with paralysis or heavy damage from their STAB moves. Tentacruel remains effective outside of the lead slot, being a solid mid-game threat due to the momentum Wrap provides and its ability to force out many Pokemon that can't handle its coverage. It can also perform admirably as a late-game sweeper, utilizing Wrap after the opposing team has been paralyzed and weakened.</p> "

In the current metagame, the decision goes over to Rhydon with its higher damage output and a better matchup against Chansey, as Rhydon has a guaranteed 2HKO against Chansey without a Reflect up, while Golem is unlikely to 2HKO. Rhydon also has 103 HP Substitutes, which means it has a good chance to beat a paralyzed Reflect + Seismic Toss Chansey, whereas Golem does not. Golem, however, still manages to carve itself a niche with its access to Explosion, which is the second strongest attack in the game behind Snorlax's Self-Destruct. Explosion does massive amounts of damage to the majority of the metagame, and Golem has Earthquake for the Pokemon that resist it. This makes Golem likely to be able to trade with threats or at least severely weaken them to the point of being easily revenged killed. Golem's ability to outpace Rhydon gives it an advantage against teams using Rhydon, as it has a good matchup against them, and Golem can find its way in against Rhydon if you can predict a Rock Slide. This can be risky, however, as Rhydon 2HKOes Golem with Earthquake. Golem, just like Rhydon, offers a hard counter to the two most common Electric-types in the tier, Zapdos and Jolteon, as they do not have any coverage that touches Golem.</p> ",

It also will cure any frozen target it hits from freeze. Substitute can make prediction easier and can help fish for paralysis, but Golem has trouble fitting it in on its moveset, and it is done better by Rhydon due to it having 404 HP, which will prevent its Substitutes from being broken with one Seismic Toss.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Exeggutor: Exeggutor can switch in and survive any move Golem can muster and retaliate with a powerful Psychic or a 4x super effective Mega Drain.

      "overview": "<p>Though Golem is a less used Pokemon in the RBY UU metagame, it certainly has its merits as a wallbreaker for a few reasons, with the biggest being Explosion. An Explosion coming from Golem is actually the strongest attack in the tier, having the power to put a massive dent in defensive stalwart Vaporeon or even OHKO Hypno. A properly timed Explosion can turn the tide of battle in your favor, but that's not all Golem has to offer. With proper paralysis support and good prediction, it can punch holes in enemy teams using STAB moves Earthquake and Rock Slide. Golem can do all this while also having good defensive utility due to its Rock / Ground typing, which gives it a resistance to Normal-type moves and an immunity to Electric-type moves. Wrap is a defining element of RBY UU, and Golem can be a useful part of an anti-Wrap core due to its resistance to the move. In addition, it can switch in on Dodrio or on another Pokemon's predicted Hyper Beam and punish both with impunity. Finally, its Electric immunity makes it easier to switch in on a predicted Thunder Wave or Thunderbolt, especially when paired with one of UU's many strong Water-types, such as Tentacruel.</p> <p>Golem's most glaring weakness is its Speed. Golem is outsped by pretty much every Pokemon that sees play in UU, even Pokemon known for being slow like Omastar and Tangela. Not only does Golem have little special bulk, it also has a host of weaknesses. This means that it can be OHKOed by UU's aforementioned Water types, as well as by Pokemon like Articuno with Blizzard and even Raichu with Surf. Therefore, Golem is heavily reliant on support from its teammates and good predictions in order to make an impact.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Golem's most useful alternative move is Toxic, which thwarts Dragonite's attempts to set up Agility and sweep with Wrap because it will take more damage from poison every turn than is worth dealing with Wrap. However, this comes at the cost of dropping Body Slam or Substitute. Since Golem is now unable to spread paralysis on its own or soak up damage with a Substitute, it will need paralysis support more from its teammates in order to get off its attacks, especially Explosion. Toxic isn't needed to deal with Dragonite anyway, as Golem can still help PP stall Wrap.</p> <p>Rest can also work over Substitute or Body Slam as a way to keep Golem healthy. When Golem gets low on health, it can go for Rest as the opponent switches in a sleeping Pokemon to take the Explosion. As mentioned before, it can also burn off the sleep turns by coming in on Wrap and Hyper Beam, or on another sleeping Pokemon. Finally, Counter can be used after switching into Hyper Beam and or Body Slam, either hitting the recharging foe or punishing an Explosion switch-in.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Due to Golem’s low Special, low Speed, and 4x weakness to Water, any Water-type can OHKO it. Vaporeon can tank anything Golem throws at it, even Explosion from full health. Gyarados can switch in on Earthquake for no damage and OHKO Golem, though it does need to watch out if Golem predicts the switch and uses Rock Slide. Omastar also outspeeds and OHKOes Golem, though Golem does over half of Omastar's health in damage with Earthquake. Tentacruel also takes huge damage from Earthquake and can even be OHKOed by Explosion, but it still maintains the upper hand, as it can OHKO Golem or halt its plans to use Explosion with Wrap. While Golem can be used with another Pokemon like Haunter or Omastar to form an anti-Wrap PP stalling core, it still needs to watch out for Tentacruel's Surf.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: The two notable Grass-types in the tier, Tangela and Venusaur, are both solid checks to Golem. Tangela’s high Defense, resistance to Earthquake, and access to STAB Mega Drain make it an excellent check to Golem. Note that Mega Drain does not OHKO until Tangela has a Growth under its belt, meaning Tangela is still susceptible to taking massive damage from Explosion. In addition, if the Golem player predicts a Tangela switch-in, they can opt for Rock Slide, which Tangela has a harder time shrugging off since it hits for neutral damage. Venusaur is a little worse at switching into Golem, as it does not resist Earthquake and is 3HKOed. However, it easily outspeeds Golem and OHKOes it with Razor Leaf, unlike Tangela, meaning the Golem player has fewer options. In either case, both Tangela and Venusaur force Golem to switch out, meaning they can spread status to Golem's teammates.</p> <p><strong>Articuno: As a Flying-type, Articuno is able to switch in on Earthquake and take out Golem easily with STAB Blizzard. However, good prediction on the Golem user’s end can spell disaster for Articuno, as it is OHKOed by Rock Slide. Articuno also will be sent running if Golem uses Substitute or paralyzes it with Body Slam on the switch. While it is a risky play, Golem can even switch into a paralyzed Articuno while it attempts to use Agility. If full paralysis triggers either turn, Golem wins the interaction with Rock Slide. Finally, if Articuno gets unlucky and Blizzard misses while Rock Slide does not, it is KOed.</p> <p><strong>Raichu</strong>: Raichu has a hard time switching into Golem's attacks due to Earthquake hitting for super effective damage and Body Slam potentially paralyzing it. However, if it switches in on Rock Slide, Golem is in trouble. Raichu outspeeds it and OHKOes with Surf, forcing Golem out.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Earthquake and Rock Slide are Golem's go-to moves early in the game, weaker than Explosion but packing a big punch coming off its base 110 Attack. Due to its powerful STAB moves and Explosion, Golem can be used effectively as a wallbreaker, especially for punishing Pokemon that have just used Rest. For its final moveslot, Substitute is used to help scout moves and Pokemon as well as providing a layer of defense so Golem can get off an Explosion without being KOed first. However, Body Slam can be used over Substitute to help hinder your opponent's team through paralysis, meaning Golem doesn't need to rely on its teammates for paralysis support as much.</p> <p>Explosion is used to deal extraordinary damage to every Pokemon in the tier, with a few exceptions such as Omastar and Haunter. Some notable calculations include a guaranteed OHKO on Persian and possible OHKOs on Tentacruel and Hypno. It is against your opponent's bulky Pokemon that Explosion really shines, taking out hard-to-KO team members or at least putting a huge dent in them so they can be revenge killed. A good example target is Kangaskhan, which Golem switches into and easily tanks a Body Slam from—barely minding potential paralysis due to its Speed—before dealing 72.8-85.7% damage with Explosion to set up a revenge kill. Deciding when to use Explosion can be hard, though, since your opponent can predict it and switch in a Pokemon that is already low on health or that resists it. Anticipate this counterplay and use a different move, such as a STAB move for instant damage, Substitute to scout, or Body Slam for a chance to spread paralysis. It is recommended to use Explosion when Golem is around half health or when you think you can catch Hypno on the switch, either OHKOing this top threat or priming it for a revenge killer like Dugtrio to follow up on.</p> <p>Despite its flaws, Golem still manages to find a few different points of entry into the game. For instance, bringing in Golem is a great way to stop a Dodrio sweep, as Rock Slide deals super effective damage and Golem hard walls Dodrio. It is especially adept at switching into Hyper Beam and punishing Dodrio and Articuno with Rock Slide or Kangaskhan and Persian with Explosion. Golem can also be used as sleep fodder, since its defensive typing means it can freely switch in often on Normal-, Electric-, and Rock-type moves, allowing for easy pivoting. It can even wake up from short sleeps if switched in on Wrap or Hyper Beam enough times.</p> <p>Golem can form an excellent immunity core with Gyarados, as it covers Gyarados's Electric weakness and Gyarados covers its Ground weakness, so both can be effective mid- or late-game by coming in freely on double switches. Pairing Golem with another effective anti-Wrap Pokemon such as Haunter or Omastar is also a valid strategy, as they can work together to PP stall Wrap without sustaining too much damage. Golem works especially well with either because Haunter's Thunderbolt handles its Water-type counters and Omastar's Blizzard dispatches its Grass-type counters. Especially if Golem doesn't run Body Slam, it appreciates paralysis-spreading teammates. A great example is Kadabra, which shrugs off special attacks surprisingly well for it with Recover, revenge kills threats to Golem, and appreciates it taking Normal-type attacks and the crippling Thunder Wave in return. Finally, Dugtrio takes advantage of Golem weakening or KOing an opponent's Ground-type checks to have a much easier time revenge killing or sweeping.</p> "

It also allows Rapidash to have an uncontested Fire Spin, which further enhances its ability to clean late game. However, it is hard for Rapidash to set up against a majority of the tier, and it faces competition from Moltres in this role. Stomp can be used alongside Body Slam for a solid combo of paralysis and flinch. Rapidash likes to have counterplay to Water- and Rock- types like Blastoise and Golem, which can easily stonewall it, making Pokemon like Blastoise, Electrode, and Mr. Mime solid teammates.</p> "

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Amnesia Slowbro has gone down in history as one of the most famous and well-known sets in the world of competitive Pokemon. Generally known as Tobybro, Amnesia Slowbro is a moveset that combines both simplicity and efficiency. The RBY version of Amnesia is arguably the best stat-boosting move of all time, raising the Special stat by two stages. It quickly powers up Slowbro's Special moves, while covering its main defensive weakness: Electric-type attacks. Having one of the best physical defense stats in the game and learning Thunder Wave to make up for its awful Speed greatly helps make Slowbro more threatening as well.</p> <p>However, Slowbro is also a bit of an all-or-nothing Pokemon and requires some luck, which are the main reasons why it's often an overlooked Pokemon. Without setting up, Slowbro is basically a useless Pokemon; it can't Recover to work as a wall for a long time, and offensively, it lacks Explosion or a sleep move, unlike other specially based Pokemon. On the other hand, if Slowbro sets up, it's meant never to switch out, so the user is inevitably taking some risks; Electric-type moves fail to get past a +6 Slowbro normally, but with a critical hit, a non-STAB Thunderbolt will nearly OHKO Slowbro while a STAB Thunderbolt will OHKO outright. With critical hit rates being much higher in RBY than in later generations, it's not really \"bad luck\" when Slowbro ultimately ends up falling to a critical hit Thunderbolt. To a lesser extent, this can also be applied to the physical side, potentially turning 4HKOs into 3HKOs, letting a physical sweeper get past Rest. However, while it's true that Slowbro depends on quite a bit on luck, it also requires a good deal of skill, and Slowbro can be one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the first generation, being the best Amnesia user in RBY after Mewtwo.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ice Beam is another attacking move Slowbro can use. Its biggest upside is hitting Grass-types and Zapdos for super effective damage, including Exeggutor and Victreebel. Ice Beam will often surprise Exeggutor, OHKOing it at +6. At the very least, it will force Exeggutor to use Explosion earlier, making it more predictable. Meanwhile, Zapdos is 2HKOed by a +2 Ice Beam and OHKOed when Slowbro is at +6. Ice Beam's freeze chance might also save you in a pinch and could make a difference against another Slowbro or Amnesia Snorlax. Ice Beam, however, should only be used over Thunder Wave, because the STAB move is necessary to 2HKO Chansey and Starmie. Withdraw has the same goal as Reflect, with the difference that it can maximize Slowbro's Defense, but requires two turns to reach Reflect's potential. Reflect will generally turn out to be more useful and safer. Withdraw's high PP will let Slowbro outstall other Slowbro, however. Counter can surprise common Slowbro switch-ins like Starmie if you switch into a Body Slam from a physical attacker and scare it out, or if you predict a Hyper Beam. Counter has hardly any other uses other than these though because Slowbro generally only takes physical attacks when it's asleep, excluding Explosion. Disable is a funny option that can prevent some Pokemon from Thunderbolting Slowbro for some time, but it's very unreliable and shouldn't really be used.</p> <p>Slowbro can also be used as a lead with a set of Thunder Wave, Amnesia, Surf, and Fire Blast or Blizzard. This set is incredibly vulnerable to sleep leads such as Jynx, Exeggutor, Gengar, and Sing Chansey; however, when it finds itself against other Thunder Wave leads, namely Alakazam and Starmie, its ability to boost up with Amnesia and pump out damage with +2 coverage moves is remarkable. It still struggles in doing significant damage if the opponent has Thunderbolt Chansey or Starmie anywhere on their team, and due to its lack of recovery it is incredibly easy to wear down and incredibly vulnerable to full paralysis, so this set is not recommended.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type coverage: The higher the user's critical hit ratio and the number of turns it can resist Slowbro's Surf, the better. Starmie is a good choice, having a very high Speed and thus a high critical hit ratio, while also resisting all of Slowbro's moves. It's not a surefire counter though, and in case Starmie prevails, it won't like having to eat a Thunder Wave. Gengar makes a good choice too, having a high critical hit ratio and being able to Explode for around 50% damage when it's about to be KOed. However, it doesn't resist Surf and is weak to Psychic. Zapdos and Jolteon have the luxury of getting STAB in their Electric-type attacks; even when Slowbro is at +6, their Thunderbolts will still do significant damage. They also have a high critical hit ratio, but like Gengar, they don't resist Surf, and, unlike Gengar, can't Explode.</p> <p><strong>Explosion users: Explosion makes a very viable choice for taking Slowbro down when you have no other option. No user can OHKO a healthy Slowbro, but many put it in the KO range of Tauros's Hyper Beam or Rhydon's Earthquake. Pokemon with Explosion or Self-Destruct include Exeggutor, Snorlax, Golem, Cloyster, and Gengar, although Gengar's Explosion is weaker. A Resting Slowbro that gets Exploded on is pretty much a dead Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Amnesia Snorlax will often defeat Slowbro, as its Body Slam is an almost guaranteed 4HKO while Slowbro's Surf only manages a 5HKO when both are at +6. Due to the Speed tie, a 4HKO could turn into a 3HKO, depending on who goes first the turn Slowbro uses Rest. If Snorlax is packing Thunderbolt instead, it will fare even better, 3HKOing Slowbro after both have set up. As far as the physical side goes, Rhydon makes a surprisingly viable option, although risky as well; it has to switch in when Slowbro uses Rest, and then try to 3HKO it with its STAB Earthquake, which will happen around 75-80% of the time. Tauros needs a critical hit Body Slam to get the chance to 3HKO it after finishing it off with a Hyper Beam. If Tauros gets paralyzed, though, you can pretty much forget about beating Slowbro. Snorlax's critical hit ratio is much smaller than Tauros's, but its Body Slam is almost a guaranteed 4HKO, and has an easier chance if Body Slam paralyzes Slowbro. For instance, if Snorlax moves first while Slowbro tries to use Rest, but moves last on the previous turn that Slowbro Rested, Snorlax beats Slowbro with only Body Slam. Both Tauros and physical Snorlax should really be careful when trying to counter Slowbro and should generally only be sent in when Slowbro is sleeping because they will otherwise fall to previously-boosted Surfs more often than not. If Slowbro's set contains Reflect, though, trying to counter it with physical attacks becomes impractical unless you are willing to sacrifice at least two Exploders. In this case, however, any unparalyzed Thunderbolt user becomes a much more effective check, including the slow ones, such as Chansey and Lapras, which, despite their low critical hit rate, will get more chances to fish for it, as it's much more likely that Slowbro is forced to Rest more often. Chansey and especially Starmie will get the chance to keep using their recovery move until Slowbro gets fully paralyzed, which is when they get the chance to use Thunderbolt. Starmie is much better at doing this because Recover outlasts Surf in terms of PP.</p> <p><strong>Razor Leaf users: Victreebel and Venusaur are known for having a guaranteed critical hit in their STAB signature move, Razor Leaf. They won't like switching into a Thunder Wave, and could be surprised and OHKOed by a boosted STAB Psychic, but, otherwise, either of the Grass-types can KO Slowbro when it is below 70% or 2HKO it while it is Resting.</p> <p><strong>Light Screen users: Starmie or Chansey packing Light Screen will completely counter Slowbro unless they get really unlucky with full paralysis. Light Screen is never seen on them, however, as it has no use outside of walling Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: It's worth noting that Slowbro, as a Rest user, is one of those Pokemon that should be attacked whenever given the chance, because when it's Resting, you can apply a much higher and more effective variety of tactics to try to take it down. Exeggutor's Mega Drain and Alakazam and Jynx's Seismic Toss, for instance, may not do enough to kill Slowbro, but will cause some decent damage on it before being forced to switch out, which will force it to Rest earlier than desired.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Everybody knows the set, but this doesn't make it less dangerous. Amnesia boosts Slowbro's decent Special, being able to reach the maximum 999 after three Amnesia boosts, letting Slowbro 2HKO Chansey with its STAB Surf at +6. Amnesia, like all boosting moves, also has the great side effect of further reducing the speed of paralyzed enemies, allowing Slowbro to muscle through paralyzed would-be walls a lot more easily. When playing Slowbro, it's really useful to know some significant damage rolls or otherwise have a damage calculator handy. As said, Slowbro has a good chance of 2HKOing Chansey but must be at +6. The same can be said about Starmie, although a base 999 Special STAB Surf is a guaranteed 2HKO. On the other hand, Starmie is much more of a problem for Slowbro due to having a much higher critical hit ratio. Beating Tauros is about using Amnesia once and then 2HKOing it with Surf, although a +4 Slowbro stands a good chance of OHKOing Tauros. Snorlax, however, requires Slowbro to use Amnesia twice to get the 2HKO; a +6 Surf almost never OHKOes Snorlax. Zapdos also requires two Amnesia boosts, while Jolteon, like Tauros, is 2HKOed by a +2 Surf. Gengar will fall to two +2 Surfs half of the time, so it's generally advised to only use Amnesia once. Exeggutor and Lapras are 3HKOed by a +6 Surf; boosting either twice or three times is the way to go. All these calculations have been made considering that the opposition is at full health, so they may vary depending on the health of the opponent as well as on the situation of the battle itself.</p> <p>Having said that, using Thunder Wave first is almost always a good idea. Slowbro is tied with Snorlax as the slowest Pokemon in the game, so paralyzing Snorlax is also a good idea to guarantee Slowbro is faster than it or to fish for full paralysis. Against common Slowbro switch-ins, such as Starmie, Gengar, or Electric-types, Thunder Wave will have to be used as they switch in, so that you can get a boost before they are able to attack. However, it's generally advised to switch Slowbro back after paralyzing the switch-in to get the chance to move two consecutive times the next time they switch in. This way, you can maximize your chances of KOing said check before they are able to score a deadly critical hit Thunderbolt. Even if Starmie or Chansey paralyze Slowbro back in order to outspeed again, using Thunder Wave yourself first was the best move, because the chances of beating an unparalyzed Chansey and especially Starmie are slim, as they can just keep using Recover or Soft-Boiled until Slowbro gets fully paralyzed and they get a chance to use Thunderbolt. An unparalyzed Starmie can also attempt to PP stall Slowbro out of Surfs as well.</p> <p>Rest is perfectly suited for Slowbro. During the setup, Slowbro generally takes some residual damage and gets paralyzed, but Rest can keep Slowbro healthy and free of status. After maximizing its Special, no special attack can get past Slowbro's Rest without a critical hit, and due to Slowbro's great Defense and lack of exploitable physical weaknesses, it's going to be hard to beat Slowbro from the physical side without Explosion. Tauros, for example, needs a critical hit Body Slam and Hyper Beam to 3HKO Slowbro, which is the only way it has to get past Rest; furthermore, if Tauros gets paralyzed, its chances of beating Slowbro become very small. Snorlax, meanwhile, will generally have to resort to Self-Destruct to take Slowbro down. Rhydon has the luxury of being able to 3HKO Slowbro with its powerful STAB Earthquake most of the time, but will have to switch into the predicted Rest and is OHKOed by even a +0 Surf. As said, Explosion makes a good way to eliminate Slowbro, but an Explosion might not even guarantee that a full health Slowbro goes down or gets revenge killed easily due to Slowbro's already mentioned great Defense. Exeggutor's Explosion, for instance, will only hit Slowbro for around 60%. Lowering Slowbro to around 80% or forcing it to Rest first is the safest way to ensure that one Explosion is enough to let a physical attacker, such as Tauros, Golem, Rhydon, or Persian, to revenge kill it safely.</p> <p>Psychic is a STAB alternative to Surf, and trades 5 extra power for a 30% chance of scoring a Special fall. As far as type effectiveness is concerned, Psychic gains a neutral hit against Lapras and Cloyster and a super effective hit against Gengar and Victreebel, three of which are effective Slowbro checks, but loses the neutral hit against Alakazam as well as the ability to OHKO Golem and Rhydon at +0, needing two Amnesia boosts to OHKO them. Seismic Toss Alakazam, in particular, will have the opportunity to force you to Rest before Slowbro is able to get past it. Psychic's lower PP could also be a problem against users of recovery moves, especially considering that, without Surf, Alakazam will also require more time to take down. It could also be an issue if your opponent keeps using Recover or Soft-Boiled and gets lucky with full paralysis. Having 8 fewer PP could also be significant in an odd Slowbro war.</p> <p>Reflect is a possible alternative to Thunder Wave, as it doesn't change the general concept of the set, but changes the way it works in some way and some of its counters. The first thing to notice is the loss of Thunder Wave, which will be problematic in several match-ups. Unless you can paralyze Starmie with another Pokemon, it will hard counter Slowbro. Other specially based Pokemon, such as Chansey, Lapras, Gengar, and Electric-types will also become more problematic if you can't paralyze them; they will have a higher chance of scoring a critical hit Thunderbolt, as they will move first and avoid possible full paralysis. Lastly, Victreebel and Venusaur will have nothing to worry about a Slowbro lacking Thunder Wave unless its attacking move is Psychic. Letting Victreebel in for free could get especially problematic if it's packing Wrap.</p> <p>The reward of using Reflect comes from the physical side. It almost ensures that none of Snorlax, Golem, and Rhydon will have a chance to take Slowbro down due to their low critical hit rate. Tauros will have a lot of difficulties too, needing two critical hit Body Slams to beat Slowbro while it Rests. Reflect is also great for weakening Explosions, which is one of the most common and \"safe\" ways of getting rid of Slowbro; even Snorlax's Self-Destruct will only manage around 40% damage. Reflect makes double Explosions necessary to lower Slowbro to the point where it can be revenge killed, which, for the opponent, involves sacrificing at least two Pokemon.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>In a time where Mewtwo ravaged the RBY Ubers landscape and players desperately searched for a good check to it, Slowbro came to answer the call. Slowbro's Amnesia set, known as \"TobyBro\" and first created by Wintermute in the early 2000s, is the best check to non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo in the tier while being a very strong Pokemon in its own right. Amnesia, along with a great typing and excellent bulk, gives Slowbro immense sweeping potential. A boosted Surf is capable of OHKOing or 2HKOing almost everything in the tier, and even resistant foes are 3HKOed. Amnesia also helps Slowbro patch up its Electric weakness, since Special is used for both offense and defense. Slowbro can even use Thunder Wave to fix its miserable Speed, and it can also reapply the foe's Speed drops from paralysis by using Amnesia.</p> <p>However, Slowbro will take very heavy damage from a critical hit Thunderbolt regardless of boosts, forcing it to use Rest earlier, and many Electric-type Pokemon have very high critical hit rates courtesy of their high Speed. Slowbro's abysmal Speed, while mitigated by Thunder Wave, can give it trouble as it tries to boost against faster threats while also necessitating some amount of paralysis support from teammates. Slowbro is also very one-dimensional and predictable; however, it will always be one of the most dangerous sweepers, no matter how much the opponent might know it is coming.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Slowbro has the option of forgoing Thunder Wave to run any one of the following options. Withdraw is a very strong option to bolster Slowbro's Defense and allow it to take Explosions, removing a prime option for dealing with it. Withdraw also allows Slowbro to reapply paralysis Speed drops more easily. Its massive 61 PP, combined with Rest, allows Slowbro to PP stall almost any Pokemon it needs to, such as opposing Thunder Wave Slowbro. The Defense boost also lets Slowbro counter Snorlax and Mew, which would otherwise be able to hit Slowbro for decent damage. However, Withdraw Slowbro can be very passive, and teams can take advantage of that with faster threats that Slowbro cannot outspeed without Thunder Wave. Reflect is also an option, as an instant +2 in Defense can be crucial in certain situations, such as Snorlax and Tauros needing instant walling as opposed to permitting multiple turns of setup. However, lower PP, an inability to reapply Speed drops, and an inability to boost past +2 make Reflect less desirable.</p> <p>Slowbro can also run two attacks, Surf and either Ice Beam or Psychic. Ice Beam prevents Exeggutor from checking Slowbro and can freeze Mewtwo, Chansey, and opposing Slowbro. On the other hand, Psychic allows Slowbro to hit Lapras and pressure Mewtwo, Starmie, and Light Screen Chansey with Special drops. However, running two attacks makes Slowbro more reliant on paralysis support from teammates to be able to outspeed and threaten certain Pokemon like Tauros and Mew. Two attacks Slowbro also gets PP stalled by Thunder Wave Slowbro. Toxic is a niche option to win mirrors against Withdraw Slowbro, since using Rest does not reset the bad poison timer. Also, Toxic can allow Slowbro to effectively pressure and even remove Light Screen Chansey, which otherwise walls it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Zapdos, Jolteon, and Electrode all carry Thunderbolt, which can stop Slowbro from setting up easily. All three of these Pokemon also have good critical hit rates, and a critical hit Thunderbolt from any of them will OHKO Slowbro outright. However, none of them can switch into a boosted attack, and all three are devastated by paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type coverage: Non-Electric types like Starmie, Gengar, and Mewtwo can all run Thunderbolt to pressure Slowbro. All three have good critical hit rates, and a critical Thunderbolt can ruin Slowbro. Chansey can also run Thunderbolt, but it is less common; it also has a mediocre critical hit rate, meaning it struggles to pressure Slowbro after it has set up.</p> <p><strong>Water-resistant Pokemon: Exeggutor and Lapras avoid the 2HKO from +6 Surf and can put Slowbro to sleep with Sleep Powder and Sing, respectively. Lapras also carries Thunderbolt and can deal heavy damage with a critical hit. However, +6 Ice Beam OHKOes Exeggutor, while +2 Ice Beam 2HKOes it, and +4 Psychic 2HKOes Lapras, meaning you must scout for these moves before using these Pokemon to check Slowbro. In a similar vein, Victreebel and Cloyster avoid the OHKO from +6 Surf and can remove Slowbro with Wrap + Razor Leaf or Clamp + Explosion, respectively. However, a single miss of their partial trapping moves can spell doom for either.</p> <p><strong>Light Screen Chansey: Slowbro cannot 3HKO Chansey after Light Screen with +6 Surf, and it will eventually PP stall Slowbro. However, Slowbro can win the interaction if it gets lucky with a few paralysis turns. Slowbro carrying Toxic also does not fear Light Screen Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Depending on the set, Slowbro can be checked by its other sets. Thunder Wave beats two attacks sets, Withdraw beats any set besides Toxic, and Toxic always beats every other set.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Surf is very strong after a few Amnesia boosts, achieving things like a high chance to 2HKO Chansey at +6 and 2HKOs on Mew, Mewtwo, and Snorlax at +4. Amnesia is what makes this set threatening, letting Slowbro become very bulky and very powerful. Thunder Wave allows Slowbro to patch up its awful Speed and more effectively threaten faster Pokemon. This is amplified by the threat of Amnesia reapplying paralysis Speed drops. Slowbro can also use paralysis to have a chance at beating its checks, like Light Screen Chansey and Starmie. Rest allows Slowbro to stick around for much longer and ensures that a single critical hit cannot end its sweep. It also protects Slowbro from chip damage, which is likely to accumulate while switching in and boosting with Amnesia. However, a sleeping Slowbro is very easy to take advantage of, and many opponents will use it as a chance to switch in their Explosion user or Thunderbolt Mewtwo.</p> <p>When using Slowbro, it is very important to scout your opponent's team for Electric-type coverage, especially Thunderbolt on Chansey or Mewtwo. However, Chansey very rarely uses Thunderbolt in Ubers, meaning it is usually safe to set up against. Slowbro is very good at setting up against and paralyzing Mewtwo, as it takes very little damage from Mewtwo's attacks even after it has boosted, unless Mewtwo reveals Thunderbolt or gets a critical hit. Either can force Slowbro to repeatedly use Rest and allow Mewtwo to win the interaction with some luck. Slowbro itself is a very good paralysis absorber, since its pitiful Speed means it is not affected much by it. Amnesia reapplying paralysis Speed drops means even a paralyzed Slowbro can outspeed most foes after a few uses of the move. The most common way to remove Slowbro is with Explosion, so users such as Snorlax, Golem, Mew, Exeggutor, and Gengar should be watched carefully. Slowbro should be used with a good absorber of the move, such as Jynx, Rhydon, or your own Golem or Gengar. Absorbing Explosion with these Pokemon requires good prediction on when the foe is about to use the move to switch them in at the right time. Predicting wrong can result in Slowbro getting KOed or the opponent gaining momentum. Alternatively, you can choose to not reveal your Slowbro until later in the game, after the rest of your team has already dealt with opposing Explosion users.</p> <p>Slowbro especially appreciates Rhydon and Golem as Explosion absorbers, since they are immune to the Electric-type moves that give Slowbro so much trouble. However, Rhydon and Slowbro are both very slow, so using them together requires extra care. If your chosen strategy is to deal with Explosion users before revealing Slowbro, other Pokemon that attract the move such as Chansey, Mew, and Mewtwo can be used. Slowbro can struggle to beat certain checks such as Exeggutor and Lapras, so Pokemon that can deal with them, such as BoltBeam Chansey, are appreciated.</p> "

In addition, Thunder Wave lets it cripple the offensive potential of major offensive threats such as Mr. Mime and Arcanine.

These traits and its amazing Attack stat make for powerful and frequent critical hits; the resulting 19.53% chance makes it a very volatile threat that's difficult for most Pokemon to switch into consistently. Dodrio can further boost its Speed and make up for Speed drops from paralysis through Agility, which has the added bonus of making it more difficult to pin down with Wrap. Its typing is also notable for its immunity to Earthquake and paralysis from Body Slam. These qualities make Dodrio a solid revenge killer and late-game sweeper on offensive teams.</p> <p>However, Dodrio's defenses are extremely poor, making it take heavy damage from even neutral hits and easy to OHKO. Worse still, it lacks coverage moves, leaving it stonewalled by Rock-types like Golem and Omastar. Dodrio is a common target for paralysis due to its Speed and fragility too, making it very easy to neuter. As a result, getting Dodrio into the fray can be a difficult task without support from Wrap or smart double-switching.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dodrio's movepool doesn't leave much in the way of options. Substitute can allow Dodrio to take a bigger hit than it should, but it is limited in utility, as it doesn't block status in RBY. It also doesn't play to the hit-and-run playstyle Dodrio should be employing, fails to stop it from being forced out by Rock-types that resist its STAB moves, and makes it easier to revenge kill due to the move's HP cost.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Dodrio gets completely walled by Golem and Omastar, as it lacks any attack that can deal even neutral damage. In return, they 2HKO Dodrio with Rock Slide and Blizzard, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Articuno: Articuno's bulk tends to allow it to take enough hits from Dodrio before it OHKOes with Blizzard. In addition, if Articuno uses Agility, Dodrio can't touch it at all unless Blizzard misses.</p> <p><strong>Dewgong and Vaporeon</strong>: Both of these Pokemon beat Dodrio one-on-one but take heavy damage in the process. Dewgong can outright OHKO Dodrio with Blizzard, and Vaporeon can survive a Body Slam and subsequent Hyper Beam to KO Dodrio with Blizzard if it has taken any prior damage, dealing a maximum of 92.2%.</p> <p><strong>Electabuzz and Raichu</strong>: Both of these threats can either paralyze Dodrio or 2HKO it with Thunderbolt; should Dodrio have taken any chip damage, it will be KOed outright. However, neither can switch in safely due to Body Slam's power and paralysis chance. Plus, even if they switch in on Drill Peck, Hyper Beam has a good chance to KO afterwards. Raichu tends to have even more trouble switching in than Electabuzz because it only Speed ties Dodrio, making the matchup very inconsistent.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite takes Body Slam and Drill Peck very well at full health, unless Dodrio lands a critical hit, and can then paralyze it with Thunder Wave.

Drill Peck complements this excellently, 2HKOing Haunter, Tangela, and Venusaur, though in Tangela's case Dodrio may have to take Stun Spore to KO it. Dodrio's Hyper Beam is extremely strong, KOing even bulkier threats like Tentacruel and Hypno after a Body Slam on the switch. Finally, Agility is put in the last slot to allow Dodrio to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Should it be forced to take paralysis, Dodrio can also use Agility to ignore the Speed drop from it. Toxic is a notable alternate option for threatening Dragonite, forcing it to take more damage than it deals with Wrap. However, using it can be difficult, as it leaves Dodrio open to a potential hit, which can be risky given its fragile nature. As such, using it when anticipating a switch is recommended.</p> <p>Dodrio, as mentioned before, is extremely frail and dislikes paralysis, so it shouldn't be brought into a game early except as a lead. Lead Dodrio can be used to threaten Tentacruel and Kadabra right out of the gate, usually putting them into range for Dugtrio to KO them after Dodrio goes down. This can be huge, as Pokemon like Tentacruel and Hypno otherwise put immense pressure on teams throughout a game. However, this often means sacrificing Dodrio, which may not be favorable in the long-term. Generally, outside of the lead slot, Dodrio should play a hit-and-run playstyle before cleaning up late-game. Dodrio's two main points of entry are opposing Earthquakes and revenge killing. Its Hyper Beam is notably likely to finish off threats dented by a teammate's Explosion. Dodrio's immunity to Earthquake is especially helpful for double-switching out to Electric-types, reducing risk, and maintaining momentum. This immunity can also be utilized alongside Haunter, with its immunity to Normal-type attacks forming a small immunity core. However, repeatedly switching between them can lead to an early KO with a good prediction from the opponent. Dodrio is also good for taking advantage of threats in a passive state, such as foes using Rest, where it can set up with Agility, outspeed every Pokemon in the tier, and tear the opposing team apart with its immediate offensive presence. Furthermore, Dodrio can set up against Dugtrio or weakened physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Persian, as it forces them out with its powerful offensive capabilities. On top of that, forcing these attackers out isn't even required, as Dodrio will gladly take a hit if it means KOing the opposing Pokemon and potentially ending the game outright.</p> "

With STAB Drill Peck under its belt, Dodrio has the potential to even OHKO Exeggutor with a critical hit, as well as play around Counter users like Chansey.

This fragility, combined with paralysis incapacitating it, makes it very difficult to utilize outside of late-game scenarios, which many teams will struggle to facilitate. Furthermore, similar to Zapdos, Dodrio is completely hopeless against Rhydon, getting effortlessly stonewalled. Finally, like many Normal-type attackers, Dodrio is strictly outclassed by Tauros, which possesses superior coverage and Speed; ergo, Dodrio must be used alongside it.

Drill Peck allows Dodrio to duel Gengar and Exeggutor far more effectively; it also does not enable Counter, which lets Dodrio scout users like Chansey while not losing any offensive pressure.

    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Dewgong’s main role in RBY UU is being the third-best purely bulky Water-type Pokemon. In terms of raw bulk, Vaporeon is simply the strongest choice. The second most prominent purely bulky Water-type Pokemon is Omastar, which holds on to relevance thanks to a resistance to Normal-type moves. Additionally, other Water-types with more diverse movepools, like Tentacruel and Poliwrath, also give Dewgong some competition.</p> <p>The two main features that make Dewgong notable are its Ice typing and superior Speed relative to other Water-type Pokemon. Being an Ice-type gifts Dewgong an impressively strong STAB-boosted Blizzard. Despite Dewgong having a lower Special than its closest competitors, its Blizzard tends to deal more damage than anything they can throw out. Just a few significant calculations include a possible 3HKO against Hypno, a very likely 3HKO against Gyarados, a 2HKO on Kangaskhan, and a guaranteed OHKO against Dodrio and Dragonite. The Ice type also improves some of Dewgong’s specific matchups. Most notably, Dewgong is the hardest Articuno counter available, as it is uniquely 4x resistant to Blizzard, cannot be frozen, and forces Articuno to take heavy recoil damage over time from using Double-Edge. Dewgong’s Speed is a relevant advantage primarily because Dewgong is able to outspeed and pressure Hypno, which other Water-type Pokemon may struggle with. The Speed and freeze immunity also help Dewgong when it faces other bulky Water-type Pokemon, namely Vaporeon.</p> <p>Despite these advantages, Dewgong is held back simply because its bulk is not as good as that of Vaporeon and Omastar. Poliwrath also largely surpasses it in physical bulk. Dewgong’s matchups against stronger attackers, both physical and special, simply do not compare to its competitors. As an example, Electabuzz will always 2HKO Dewgong with Thunderbolt but can only 3HKO Vaporeon. Dewgong does not have the longevity it needs; thus, it exists mainly as a niche pick, filling slots only on teams that truly demand its particular blend of strengths and can afford its shortcomings.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dewgong lacks significant other options. It has other physical options like Headbutt and Hyper Beam, the former of which may be useful on teams focused on spreading paralysis, but it lacks the offensive presence to take full advantage of these moves. Other Pokemon, like Poliwrath, have much better physical attacks at their disposal and the Attack stat to back them up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Thunderbolt: While every major Thunderbolt user in the tier is 3HKOed or better by Blizzard, Dewgong would prefer to avoid the interaction if it can. Electabuzz and Raichu claim 2HKOs with Thunderbolt and boast high critical hit ratios to make the move even scarier. Gyarados and Haunter can consistently 3HKO Dewgong, allowing them to easily revenge kill Dewgong or KO it while it is asleep. While it has no business switching in, Dragonite can also finish off a weakened Dewgong with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Rock- and Fighting-type Moves: Dewgong’s weakness to Rock-type moves is a small but noticeable disadvantage when comparing it to other Water-type Pokemon. While neither is likely to win a clean head-to-head interaction with Dewgong, Kangaskhan and Golem claim a possible 3HKO and guaranteed 2HKO, respectively, with Rock Slide. Dewgong also has more trouble switching into Dugtrio, as both Earthquake and Rock Slide deal significant damage. Fighting-type Pokemon and moves are very rare in RBY UU, but they still can give Dewgong some trouble when they appear. Poliwrath that carry Submission are the most notable threat, as they have an 87.1% chance to 2HKO Dewgong while taking very little from all of Dewgong’s moves.</p> <p><strong>Partial-trapping Damage: Due to its largely inferior bulk, Dewgong does not stomach chip damage, especially from Wrap, very well. Tentacruel and even Dragonite can use Wrap to gradually whittle down Dewgong’s health and quickly put it into range of most fast attackers. Dewgong is worse at taking Wrap and hoping for a miss than Vaporeon and especially Omastar. While Fire Spin is not particularly common, it is worth noting that Dewgong does not resist it and is thus not a reliable check to Fire-type Pokemon like Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Venusaur: Venusaur outspeeds Dewgong and can deal over 60% damage with Razor Leaf or put it to sleep with Sleep Powder. Blizzard is obviously a frightening prospect for Venusaur, but Venusaur is the best Dewgong revenge killer in the tier and can win one-on-one if necessary.</p> ",

It is Dewgong’s strongest attack and deals remarkable damage to most non-resistant targets. Surf can hit a small pool of Pokemon harder than Blizzard and has near-perfect accuracy, which makes it a wise choice to finish off weakened targets. Ice Beam may seem redundant with Blizzard, but it can be useful in matchups against other Water-type Pokemon, for it gives Dewgong the potential to freeze them without wasting precious Blizzard PP. Body Slam is used to help spread paralysis; paralyzing common switch-ins like Tentacruel and Vaporeon can be quite useful long-term. Thanks to Dewgong's slightly higher Attack, its Body Slam also does more damage than that of Vaporeon and Omastar. For reference, the move is likely to 3HKO Kadabra. Finally, Dewgong carries Rest to improve its longevity. While not quite as defensive as others, Dewgong can still attempt to use Rest and subsequently wake up in front of Water- and Ice-type Pokemon. Switching in amidst Wrap turns is another good option to potentially burn sleep turns.</p> <p>Dewgong’s primary role is as a defensive piece. It can work as a mixed wall in a similar fashion to Vaporeon, albeit a frailer one, that can slow down offensive momentum from strong attackers like Dodrio, Persian, Kangaskhan, and, of course, Articuno. Dewgong has some offensive prowess as well. Dewgong is surprisingly good at breaking Hypno, as it outspeeds and can 3HKO with Blizzard. Likewise, most major attackers simply do not want to take STAB Blizzard. Generally, Dewgong is most valuable mid- to late-game. This way, Dewgong’s best matchup can be identified and it can be deployed accordingly. For example, it may be useful to determine if your opponent has an Articuno before you let Dewgong take on a physical attacker or attempt to freeze an opposing Water-type Pokemon.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Cloyster is a Pokemon with coverage limited to STAB moves and Normal-type attacks, yet despite this, it has access to one of the most diverse toolsets in RBY OU. Through the use of Clamp, Cloyster can provide free switches to its teammates while also walling some of the most prominent physical threats, such as Snorlax, particularly those running Reflect, and Tauros. It possesses a reasonably powerful Blizzard, with the ability to threaten freeze on special walls, and has the option of using Explosion on Starmie to set up a Rhydon or Tauros sweep. Its part-Ice typing gives it immunity to freeze and STAB on Blizzard, at the expense of being weaker to Rock Slide. However, Cloyster has some drawbacks that stop it from being one of the top threats of RBY OU. Firstly, not being a Normal-type means it can be paralyzed by Body Slam, unlike Chansey or Snorlax. Secondly, Clamp's subpar accuracy could prove deadly to Cloyster's pretensions, especially if it's paralyzed. Lastly, it needs to rely on Rest as means of recovery, which means it's going to remain completely passive for three turns whenever it wants to recover HP.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The options listed give Cloyster the best tools to perform its roles effectively, so other options should generally not be considered. Reflect could be used in place of Clamp or Explosion to wall Normal-types even more reliably, but Cloyster loses on one of its key supporting roles when doing so and the extra bulk is generally not needed. Ice Beam is an option, though the drop in power is noticeable; most notably, Snorlax is 4HKOed instead of 3HKOed with Blizzard, but the added PP can come in handy in longer games where neither player manages to break the opponent. Toxic, when combined with Clamp, can allow Cloyster to wear down the special walls that usually threaten it with higher degrees of efficiency; however, it's difficult to justify making space for it when all of Cloyster's default moves are so valuable. Paralysis is generally very efficient at enabling Clamp chains and already present on virtually every RBY team anyway.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Starmie is the premier Cloyster counter; it takes virtually no damage from Clamp or Blizzard and is able to Recover any damage done effortlessly. It can also cripple Cloyster with Thunder Wave or do heavy damage to it with Thunderbolt or Psychic. However, it must watch out for Explosion, as it can be KOed if not at full health. Lapras or an opposing Cloyster can also completely shrug off Cloyster's attacks, and the former can threaten a powerful Thunderbolt or even Sing. It should be noted that if these Water-types are paralyzed they struggle considerably more, as Cloyster will now be faster, allowing it to use Clamp and switch out safely, with the only danger being the unlikely case of a Clamp miss coupled with lack of full paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Chansey and Alakazam can also shrug off Blizzard relatively easily thanks to their high Special bulk and easy, accessible recovery; however, if they are paralyzed, Cloyster has the option to partial trap them with Clamp to deny their recovery and switch out freely. They are also very vulnerable to Explosion, meaning that they have to tread carefully when attempting to take on Cloyster.</p> <p><strong>Electric types: Electric-types such as Jolteon and Zapdos outspeed and 2HKO Cloyster. They must be wary of switching in, though, as Blizzard threatens significant damage, especially to Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro: Slowbro can switch in on Cloyster with impunity, cripple it with Thunder Wave, and start setting up on it. If it's carrying Reflect, it's even worse, as Cloyster does a measly 30% to it with Explosion after Reflect has been set up. Slowbro is even more dangerous for Cloyster if it's packing Psychic; a +4 Psychic is already more than 50% likely to OHKO Cloyster. Thus, Cloyster is forced to use Clamp and then switch out as soon as Slowbro enters the field. This is risky and predictable due to the low accuracy and imminent threat that Slowbro poses.</p> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Tauros</strong>: If Tauros chooses to run the rare Thunderbolt instead of the standard Earthquake, it can lure in Cloyster and seriously cripple it, especially if Cloyster is already caught in Rest cycles or suffers a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Victreebel</strong>: Victreebel Speed ties with Cloyster and can do at least 85% damage with Razor Leaf. However, it's a shaky check at best, as it's also 2HKOed by Cloyster's Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Though it does not particularly enjoy switching into Blizzards, Gengar does not suffer Clamp much, outspeeds Cloyster, and threatens a 2HKO with Thunderbolt. It is also able to completely nullify Explosion, though this is reliant on prediction.</p> <p><strong>Jynx</strong>: Jynx enjoys switching into Cloyster's attacks and threatening it with Psychic. It is faster, making it a good switch-in to Clamp, and can use Cloyster's weaker attacks to its advantage to wake up after a Rest.</p> ",

It also does respectable amounts of damage due to having a higher Base Power than similar moves such as Wrap as well as being boosted by STAB. Blizzard is Cloyster's best attacking option, a powerful STAB move that only Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Starmie and Lapras or special walls such as Chansey and Alakazam can handle; it also has a possibility of scoring a freeze. Explosion allows Cloyster to act as a wallbreaker once its support capabilities are no longer needed, blowing up on a Pokemon such as Starmie or Chansey and allowing a sweeper to perform its job more easily. For the third move, Rest is the the most common option by far, as it allows Cloyster to perform its walling duties much more easily. However, Hyper Beam can also be used if the team favors the possibility of doing extra damage to Chansey. It is also the best option on dedicated Wrap teams, since they can't afford to lose any momentum, but those teams tend to be inconsistent and are thus rarely seen.</p> <p>Cloyster provides unique utility to RBY teams in that it provides the user with a sturdy Tauros answer, something that very few other Pokemon in the tier can do. Therefore, despite being an excellent Pokemon to lure in and KO walls like Starmie and Chansey through Explosion, it is often best to preserve Cloyster for the later stages, until the opposing Tauros has been crippled enough for Cloyster's defensive prowess to be superfluous. However, Cloyster is not simply a late-game Tauros answer; its positive matchup against Snorlax also gives it plenty of positional utility in the early stages, especially when combined with Clamp to gain free and safe switches. Managing Cloyster's health demands making many tricky decisions: switching in on Snorlax or using Explosion on Chansey early on may seem like great propositions, but they will weaken your team against the opponent's Tauros, so it is necessary to think about your long-term plans whenever you expose Cloyster to danger.</p> "

  "Haunter": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Haunter is the sole viable Ghost-type in RBY UU and has some fairly unique traits that make it a solid threat in the tier. For starters, Haunter is the fastest sleep inducer in the tier, which lets it work as a lead or early-game threat and gives it ample opportunity to disable a threat for what could be the rest of the game. This Speed also allows it to outrun threats like Articuno and Gyarados while leaving sizable dents in their bulk. Its immunity to Normal-type attacks makes it a solid Persian check and decent counterplay to Wrap in the form of PP stall. PP stalling Wrap works especially well if Haunter is paired with Pokemon like Omastar and Golem, as they resist it. Haunter's Poison typing also comes into play here, as being immune to Toxic means it can't take poison damage during Wrap chains from threats like Dragonite. Haunter has a workable special movepool as well, with options such as Thunderbolt and Psychic making it fairly flexible. The prized Thunderbolt is of particular note, allowing Haunter to act as a pseudo-Electric-type for a team, breaking through the powerful bulky Water-types of the tier. Overall, Haunter works well as a defensive pivot but can go on the offense just fine as well.</p> <p>However, Haunter is extremely frail on the physical side, which can be heavily exploited through its weakness to Earthquake. Prominent physical attackers such as Dugtrio and Kangaskhan carry Earthquake frequently, which can make switching in significantly less safe. In addition, Haunter's Speed is a bit below what's desirable, leaving it slower than the ever-present Tentacruel. Haunter's Speed is further compromised by paralysis, which causes it to be outsped by threats like Kangaskhan and reduces its consistency with Hypnosis.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Psychic is sometimes used for easing prediction and hitting other Poison-types like opposing Haunter. Outside of that, though, Night Shade and Thunderbolt cover the other threats it would hit. However, the Special drop can be useful for prolonged Tentacruel interactions. Should Thunderbolt's damage not be sufficient, Thunder will usually 2HKO Tentacruel and OHKO Gyarados. Mega Drain can be used to 2HKO Golem attempting to switch in on Explosion, and its recovery gives Haunter a significantly better Omastar matchup. Rest is another interesting option worth using, as it allows Haunter to work as a Dragonite check, burning sleep turns under Wrap and stalling even more Wrap PP.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dugtrio: Dugtrio is faster than Haunter, immune to Thunderbolt, and OHKOes with Earthquake, making it a premier counter to Haunter. However, it can't switch into Night Shade repeatedly and greatly fears Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Kadabra is a serious threat to Haunter, especially in lead situations. While it's 3HKOed by Night Shade and even OHKOed by Explosion, Haunter is outsped by it and 2HKOed by its Psychic. Generally, the only way Haunter can win is by landing Hypnosis or Explosion. Hypno can 2HKO Haunter using Psychic while taking very little from any move Haunter can throw at it. The only way Haunter can KO Hypno is by using two Night Shades on the switch and then Explosion. It should be noted that Kadabra and Hypno always run Thunder Wave as well, which will cripple Haunter for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Golem: Golem is immune to Thunderbolt, Haunter's main attacking move, and can very easily absorb its Explosion. To make matters worse, Golem's Earthquake is a clean OHKO. However, should Haunter choose to carry Mega Drain, it 2HKOes Golem on the switch while recovering over 70% of its HP.</p> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: While utilizing Haunter's Normal immunity to check Kangaskhan sounds enticing, Kangaskhan’s Earthquake is a 2HKO. Haunter can't win one-on-one, but Kangaskhan dislikes Hypnosis, critical hits, and repeated hits as it switches in, the latter two exploiting its mediocre special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Electabuzz</strong>: Electabuzz often carries Psychic, and, since it takes minimal damage from Thunderbolt, it can safely win the interaction. Should battling Haunter head-on be unfavorable, Electabuzz can paralyze it with Thunder Wave at minimum. However, Haunter can trade with Explosion.</p> ",

Night Shade 3HKOes Dugtrio, Kadabra, and opposing Haunter, which makes it a bit more difficult for them to switch in and check Haunter repeatedly. Thunderbolt 3HKOes common Water-types like Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar. Once Haunter has taken too much damage or has been paralyzed, it can use Explosion to try and take a Pokemon down with it, which notably OHKOes Kadabra and potentially Dugtrio.</p> <p>Haunter can work early-game, sleeping a threat and likely taking out another Pokemon with Thunderbolt or Explosion. Once Haunter has entered the game, it should put a foe to sleep as soon as possible, disabling a part of the opposing team for what could be the rest of the game. However, Haunter isn't strictly relegated to early-game duties, especially because it stops Persian and checks Tentacruel and Agility + Wrap Dragonite. Even though Haunter takes no damage from Wrap against Pokemon like Tentacruel and Dragonite, it is still immobilized. This gives the opponent an opportunity to switch into a strong physical attacker like Dugtrio, which forces Haunter to switch out or get KOed, putting a large amount of strain on the team's defensive integrity. Being immobilized by Wrap isn't inherently bad, though, as the foe loses PP, can't make concrete progress, and gives you an opportunity to predict their switch-in with one of your own. Pairing Haunter with Flying-types like Articuno can create a solid immunity core; Haunter can pivot into Normal-type attacks, and it can switch back to the Flying-type partner if it is threatened by Earthquake, keeping momentum. Once a threat is at around half HP, Explosion can usually take it out, which should be considered when Haunter is on its last sliver of health. Even if Explosion fails to KO, a heavy dent can let threats like Persian and Articuno push the advantage.</p> "

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>At first glance, Gengar appears to be a dangerous special sweeper thanks to its high Special Attack and Speed. However, Gengar's main role is to directly switch into Normal-type attacks like Body Slam, Hyper Beam, and Explosion as well as hard wall Wrap users and Persian because of its rare Ghost typing. It is also the fastest sleep inducer in the game with Hypnosis and can hit everything in the metagame for neutral damage thanks to Night Shade. From there, it can chip the foe with consistent damage or dent defensive switch-ins with Explosion. While all of these attributes are extremely appealing, keep in mind that Gengar has its fair share of shortcomings. For example, Hypnosis has shaky accuracy, so if it misses, it leaves Gengar open to attacks or being afflicted with status itself. Despite its great Ghost typing making it immune to Normal-type attacks, Gengar's secondary Poison typing leaves it weak to common coverage moves like Earthquake and Psychic, which most Pokemon in OU carry. Gengar also lacks a useful STAB move to nail Pokemon it should be able to hit for super effective damage such as Alakazam, Exeggutor, and Jynx. Its rather weak defenses and defensive typing on top of Hypnosis's shaky accuracy force Gengar to have slight competition with Exeggutor and Jynx as a sleep inducer, but Gengar is much faster than both of them and not as vulnerable to Blizzard and Explosion.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Drain can be used to 2HKO Rhydon and Golem after Gengar puts them to sleep. Keep in mind that this only works if Gengar lands a Hypnosis or on a predicted switch, as Earthquake from these two will OHKO Gengar, and Mega Drain has little utility outside of this role. Confuse Ray can make Gengar more annoying to deal with, especially against paralyzed foes like Alakazam. Counter seems like an odd choice, since Gengar is already immune to Normal-type attacks. However, if Gengar comes in after your opponent uses Explosion, and if you can predict the opponent bringing something in that Gengar forces out, Counter will heavily dent something on the switch. Submission can be used to deal more damage to Chansey, especially after it has been put to sleep. Seismic Toss is an alternative to Night Shade, as it has 8 more PP at the cost of leaving Gengar susceptible to Counter. Hyper Beam is a decent option to pressure a paralyzed Alakazam or Jynx, as Gengar can really only use Explosion successfully on these Pokemon. Psychic can be used to get Special drops to reduce the Speed of paralyzed foes even further and allow paralyzed Pokemon of yours to outspeed them. It could also be decent against Rest variants of Snorlax trying to stall Gengar. In both instances, however, Thunderbolt usually does enough damage to these Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon: Alakazam is one of the best ways to stop Gengar, as it is faster, can cripple Gengar with Thunder Wave, and can use Psychic to always 2HKO Gengar. Alakazam does have to be cautious if Gengar uses Explosion, as it has a chance to OHKO Alakazam. Exeggutor can thwart Gengar thanks to its own Sleep Powder and Psychic. Jynx can also be an issue; Gengar does outspeed it, but Jynx can inflict heavy damage if Gengar misses Hypnosis, meaning it may need to use Explosion to do anything to Jynx.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey can force Gengar out because it usually carries Thunder Wave to paralyze it and can take any attack from Gengar barring Explosion on a critical hit. A healthy Chansey does have to be cautious of Hypnosis, however.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon and Golem</strong>: Rhydon and Golem threaten Gengar because they are immune to Thunderbolt, resist Explosion, and can OHKO it with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Even though it's immune to Body Slam, Gengar absolutely does not want to be paralyzed by Thunder Wave. Starmie, Zapdos, and Jolteon are some of the Pokemon that can carry the move.</p> <p><strong>Tauros: Tauros Speed ties with Gengar and can 2HKO it with Earthquake. However, Tauros has no form of recovery and generally doesn't like switching into attacks.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax takes very little damage from Gengar's Thunderbolt, and Earthquake threatens to 2HKO in return.</p> ",

Night Shade hits every single Pokemon in the metagame for 100 damage, providing important chip damage on Pokemon like Exeggutor, Rhydon, and Chansey. Thunderbolt is used mainly to hit Water-types such as Starmie, Slowbro, and Lapras for a decent amount of damage while doing the most damage to Snorlax and Tauros outside of Explosion. Explosion should primarily be used against Pokemon that Gengar can have issues beating, such as Alakazam and Chansey. It also can dent Exeggutor, Snorlax, and Tauros.</p> <p>Gengar can be used as a lead for its positive matchup against the relatively uncommon slower sleepers such as Jynx, Exeggutor, and Chansey, but it does have shaky matchups against faster Thunder Wave leads like Alakazam and Starmie, as it really dislikes being paralyzed. Gengar can also directly switch into and counter Wrap users such as Victreebel and Dragonite without Thunder Wave, making them much less annoying. Once a foe is asleep, Gengar can switch out to a teammate that can better handle the sleeping threat, or it can proceed to chip the foe down with Night Shade. Gengar should try to stay healthy throughout the match so it can take on Normal-types much more easily. If Gengar's health is low, it can be a good idea to use Explosion, as this move does considerable damage to anything that doesn't resist it and has a chance to OHKO Alakazam. Explosion can also severely dent a threat that Gengar's team may struggle with, making it much easier to deal with. Gengar can also function as a solo sweeper, as Thunderbolt has decent neutral coverage and can break certain sleep absorbers such as Starmie. Gengar's Hypnosis will bait paralyzed Alakazam and Chansey in, so using Explosion is a good way to get rid of them. This way, another sleeper in the back won't have to worry about a paralyzed foe blocking their sleep-inducing move.</p> <p>Gengar can fit on a myriad of teams thanks to its unique attributes, but that doesn't mean that it can sweep entire teams without support. Running an extra sleep inducer such as Exeggutor or Jynx is unorthodox, but it can be beneficial. Exeggutor can also help stomach incoming Earthquake, and both of them can take Psychic aimed at Gengar.</p> "

With its great stats, phenomenal typing, and good movepool, Hypno acts as the main defensive piece of the tier, being capable of stifling the momentum of the opponent. Hypno supports its team through spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave, which, due to the threat of Tentacruel locking down slower teams with Wrap, can decide games if it hits the right targets. It's also an offensive threat in its own right, with only one direct answer besides itself that can withstand its mighty STAB Psychic without taking significant damage.</p> <p>Unfortunately, due to its subpar Speed, Hypno can be easily pivoted around by common Wrap users such as Dragonite and Tentacruel, which also prevent it from healing. Additionally, Hypno's reliance on Rest for recovery can be exploited by strong attackers such as Kangaskhan, Tentacruel, Persian, Articuno, and Dugtrio, as they can come in on the turn Hypno uses Rest and begin inflicting large amounts of damage.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Counter can be used over Seismic Toss or Hypnosis to help Hypno significantly against strong physical threats such as Dodrio, Kangaskhan, and Gyarados, though it does cause difficulties when facing opposing Hypnosis Hypno and Kadabra. Reflect could also be used to help with these matchups and helps Hypno wake up from Rest. Unfortunately, Reflect makes the matchups against opposing Hypno and Kadabra even worse.</p> <p>While Seismic Toss is usually the move to drop, Hypno can drop Psychic to run Hypnosis and Seismic Toss, which leaves you better equipped to handle opposing Hypno and Kadabra. It also has a side benefit of making your opponent less likely to suspect you are carrying Hypnosis, as Hypnosis + Seismic Toss is uncommon. Though, this does reduce the damage output of Hypno significantly, allowing strong physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Golem to safely come in and deal heavy damage with their STAB attacks. Rest can be dropped on some teams to allow Hypno to use Thunder Wave and Hypnosis and play much more aggressively; however, this comes at the cost of Hypno's immense defensive utility, which usually is to the team's detriment. Thunder Wave can also be dropped to run Hypnosis and Seismic Toss without dropping Psychic, though this greatly limits how well Hypno can spread status throughout the opposing team and leaves you helpless against Dragonite if Sleep Clause is active.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Hypno and Kadabra: Hypno's Psychic is a very difficult attack to switch into. However, Kadabra and opposing Hypno can take that hit while doing enough damage with Seismic Toss to force it to use Rest. This grants an opportunity to switch into a strong attacker or a faster Wrap user such as Tentacruel, Dragonite, Golem, Kangaskhan, or Persian. Of the two, Hypno is better as an answer, since it can absorb paralysis and fulfill its roles without issue, while Kadabra needs to avoid paralysis to remain as an answer to Tentacruel. Though, this switch can be heavily exploited by using Hypnosis to catch the incoming Psychic-type Pokemon. If Hypno is not using Seismic Toss, then it gets completely shut down by Kadabra, since it takes virtually nothing from Psychic while forcing Hypno to use Rest with repeated Seismic Tosses.</p> <p><strong>Faster Wrap Users: Due to its poor Speed tier, Hypno has terrible matchups against Wrap users that are faster than it such as Tentacruel and Dragonite. It is unable to heal off damage while it is being Wrapped and gets chipped down into KO range either for the Wrap user itself or for one of its teammates, which can come in while Hypno is immobilized by Wrap. However, neither Dragonite nor Tentacruel switches into Hypno without some difficulty, since Hypno can catch them on the switch with Thunder Wave to turn the tides.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: While Hypno is hard to wear down, its weaker Defense stat can be exploited by heavy damage dealers such as Dugtrio, Kangaskhan, Persian, Golem, Gyarados, Dodrio, and Dragonite. However, none of them enjoy eating a Thunder Wave—barring Golem and Dugtrio—or a STAB Psychic, so they are best utilized in tandem with a Psychic-type to force the Hypno to Rest, allowing the physical attacker to come in safely and threaten to KO Hypno.</p> <p><strong>Articuno: Articuno can deal heavy amounts of damage to Hypno with its absurdly powerful Blizzards to 3HKO Hypno; however, it does not enjoy eating a Thunder Wave and generally needs a Psychic-type to force Hypno to use Rest so it can come in safely.</p> <p><strong>Faster Users of Sleep-Inducing Moves</strong>: Faster sleep users such as Haunter, Poliwrath, Venusaur, and Venomoth can come in on a predicted double switch or while Hypno is asleep and threaten to put it to sleep. However, all of them are weak to Psychic and cannot switch into Hypno safely, thus requiring Psychic-type of your own to handle Hypno defensively.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Hypno's Psychic is one of the hardest special attacks to switch into in RBY UU, and with Hypno's high natural bulk, it's quite difficult to do similar damage in return. Thunder Wave makes switching into Hypno an even more daunting task; the drop in Speed from paralysis is game changing in the fast-paced environment of RBY UU, as not having anything to outspeed Tentacruel can end the game on the spot. Rest gives Hypno the ability to recover health and remain a defensive piece throughout the game, and Hypno has plentiful opportunities to come in and burn sleep turns. For example, it can burn sleep turns by coming into a Tentacruel or Dragonite while it is locked into Wrap and unable to do any significant damage. In addition, thanks to Hypno's high bulk, it usually only needs to burn a single turn to have enough health to wake up. Rest removing paralysis is also helpful, though it does prevent Hypno from blocking opposing Pokemon using sleep-inducing moves. The last move on Hypno is intended as a means of dealing with enemy Hypno. One common last move on Hypno is Seismic Toss due to how reliably it forces opposing Hypno to use Rest while also dealing good damage to opposing Kadabra and the few Pokemon that boost their Special stat. Another more potent, albeit riskier, option for dealing with opposing Hypno is Hypnosis. The upside of putting an enemy Hypno to sleep cannot be overstated, and it can be key to the success of many teams. However, its shaky accuracy and the little use it has once something is put to sleep can deter its usage on some teams.</p> <p>Hypno fills a variety of roles in teams. It effectively absorbs paralysis and spreads paralysis, acts as a key defensive piece, and can deal significant damage to the opposition. Defensively, it acts as a blanket check to many threats such as Persian and Dugtrio and stifles most common special attackers in the tier such as Kadabra, opposing Hypno, Electabuzz, Haunter, and Raichu. This defensive utility in conjunction with Hypno's access to Hypnosis and Thunder Wave makes it the best status spreader in the tier, as it gets on the field more often than other status spreaders. Offensively, Hypno can exert immense pressure on the opposing team, as little else outside of Kadabra, opposing Hypno, Vaporeon, and Tangela after a few Growths can take more than a few hits without being KOed. Even Wrap users like Tentacruel and Dragonite feel uncomfortable staying in on Hypno for too long out of fear of taking a Psychic or Thunder Wave if they miss. Hypno can be used as a lead to put something to sleep with Hypnosis at the start of the game and give your team the initiative due to its positive matchups against other leads such as Electabuzz and Kadabra. However, it does have a shaky matchup against Tentacruel, which is one of the most common leads in the tier, as its low Speed cedes the initiative to the Tentacruel user and makes it harder to put the enemy Hypno to sleep, though the benefit of paralyzing an enemy Tentacruel if it misses Wrap is significant. Because of the variety of roles it fills and how well it can fill those roles, Hypno will be on virtually every RBY UU team you play against, and any viable team must have some plan to deal with it.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Kingler is the strongest Pokemon with access to the combination of Swords Dance and Hyper Beam, possessing a dizzying base 130 Attack. This gives Kingler cataclysmic wallbreaking potential, outright OHKOing Chansey given the chance. It also has exclusive access to Crabhammer, which will nearly always land a critical hit, largely making up for its mediocre Special. Kingler isn't exactly slow relative to RBY OU either, being just above Cloyster and Victreebel. This means it isn't completely reliant on paralysis support and is very capable of mowing down teams without it. Overall, while an uncommon threat, Kingler is very capable of running over weakened teams if given a mere turn to set up. Even if it doesn't get a full sweep, the holes Kingler can tear in a team can be more than enough for its teammates to finish the job.</p> <p>So why isn't Kingler often seen on the big stage, fighting tooth and nail with Kanto's finest? Kingler's sweeping prospects are swiftly put down by paralysis, and this weakness often forces it out, causing it to forfeit any Swords Dance boosts it may have gained beforehand. Kingler's special bulk is also a pressing issue, with even neutral hits like Alakazam's Psychic 2HKOing it. Furthermore, its weakness to Electric-type attacks makes Pokemon like Starmie a royal pain, often causing it to be KOed even at around 75%. These factors make it deceptively difficult to find an opening for Kingler to sweep, and it therefore requires an experienced player to be successful.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Generally, Kingler should never drop any move other than Body Slam, and even this is very difficult to justify. Stomp is a potential choice, allowing Kingler to take a paraflinch approach, but it mandates far more team support to work, which teams can't always afford.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: While Kingler can deal sizable chip to Gengar with Crabhammer to prevent it from repeatedly switching in, Gengar KOes Kingler with Thunderbolt if it has taken any amount of damage. Furthermore, Gengar has ample opportunity to switch in on Kingler's Normal-type attacks and force sleep on the player's team, as it's immune to them.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos can switch into Hyper Beam or Crabhammer and subsequently OHKO Kingler with Thunderbolt; for Kingler to win, Zapdos has to have been chipped and paralyzed prior, and even then, it requires a +2 Hyper Beam. Much of the same applies to Jolteon, although it is OHKOed by a +2 Hyper Beam and takes very high damage from Body Slam. Furthermore, if Jolteon is asleep, it is nothing more than setup fodder for Kingler.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Kingler is thoroughly debilitated by paralysis, as it can no longer mow down paralyzed teams and its poor special bulk becomes much more apparent. The threat of paralysis can make setting up with Kingler quite difficult, as it's very possible for Kingler to be paralyzed on the turn that it attempts Swords Dance. Pokemon like Exeggutor and Zapdos can easily switch in and threaten it with their paralysis-inducing moves, forcing Kingler out if it can't KO them first. Paralysis from Body Slam can be a particularly depressing experience for any Kingler player, especially when attempting to wrestle down Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros, so this warrants consideration in prolonged interactions. Pokemon like Lapras and Victreebel become much better Kingler checks if it's paralyzed, as they can outspeed and KO it with super effective hits without fear of Hyper Beam. Reflect Chansey can also be problematic, as it effectively invalidates Kingler's Swords Dance boost and threatens it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Faster Special Attackers: Kingler is extremely frail specially, which makes many special attackers suitable Kingler checks, especially when attempting to revenge kill it. Switching these Pokemon in on a Swords Dance can put Kingler into a fairly awkward position as well. Alakazam and Starmie can paralyze Kingler while threatening it with 2HKOs from their strong special attacks. In fact, even Tauros and Chansey can adapt with Thunderbolt to 2HKO Kingler. However, few of these Pokemon want to actually be attacked by Kingler themselves; if they are paralyzed and Kingler has set up, with the exception of Tauros and sometimes Starmie, these Pokemon can be OHKOed by +2 Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Foes: While a +2 Hyper Beam from Kingler is strong, there are Pokemon that can handle it surprisingly well while paralyzing it in return. Slowbro can switch in and paralyze Kingler and doesn't mind stomaching a +2 Hyper Beam if it means stopping a sweep. However, a +2 Body Slam followed up by Hyper Beam has good odds to KO Slowbro. Lapras can easily take a Hyper Beam from Kingler while threatening with Thunderbolt afterward. Exeggutor can also take most hits Kingler can throw at it and threaten with status or a 2HKO from Psychic, though it can take massive damage in the process—or even get KOed if it has taken prior damage—if Kingler has boosted with Swords Dance. Finally, if push comes to shove, Cloyster can switch in and use Explosion, though it can't do anything else lest it become setup fodder.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Swords Dance is Kingler's claim to fame, allowing it to boost its Attack and wreak havoc. Using it also allows Kingler to reapply a foe's Speed drop from paralysis, which helps if Kingler has been paralyzed itself. +2 Hyper Beam can OHKO Chansey, Jynx, Jolteon, and Alakazam. It can also OHKO Starmie and Victreebel 30.8% and 56.4% of the time, respectively. The rest of the tier isn't far behind, with foes often crumbling if even a third of their HP has been chipped off. Body Slam lets Kingler deny switch-ins by the threat of paralysis, allowing it to be more self-sufficient rather than mandating team support; if a Pokemon is paralyzed on the switch after Kingler has boosted, a +2 Hyper Beam will likely follow for the KO. Crabhammer allows Kingler to OHKO Rhydon and 3HKO Gengar, the latter of which is immune to Kingler's other attacks, making Crabhammer valuable to prevent it from repeatedly switching in. It also allows Kingler to 3HKO Snorlax 87.2% of the time, allowing it to muscle past Reflect sets. It should be noted that Crabhammer isn't just some better Slash, though; it has some very unfortunate accuracy issues, and a single miss will most likely be Kingler's undoing.</p> <p>Kingler should be kept until late-game when the opposing team has been weakened or riddled with paralysis. This gives it the best chance of setting up successfully and serving as a wincon. If an entire team has been paralyzed, Kingler will happily take a hit if it means blowing the opposition away. Finding an opportunity to set up can be difficult, though; the best way is to punish a Pokemon using Rest, such as Snorlax or Jolteon. However, simply exploiting weakened, paralyzed Pokemon also gives a worthy payoff. Kingler should ideally be paired with an Electric-type like Zapdos or Jolteon, as they can beat Kingler's primary counters in opposing Electric-types, Starmie, and Slowbro. More offensively, an Electric-type is also a perfect way to lure Rhydon in for Kingler to either set up on or cleave through, which can instantly mean a win with its Electric-type ally in the back.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Electrode holds a highly specific niche in the RBY UU metagame. As the game's fastest Pokemon, Electrode is nearly guaranteed to attack before fainting if it enters the battle safely, even if it doesn't have the most diverse attacks. This Speed most notably allows Electrode to pressure quick tier mainstays like Tentacruel and Dugtrio. Its high Speed also blesses it with a 27.3% critical hit chance, which can elevate its weak attacks to extreme heights; for example, a critical hit Explosion will always OHKO Hypno. Its Speed and Thunder Wave make it an above average switch into Wrap users as well. These attributes also enable Electrode to be used as a lead or even a sweeper in some cases.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Electrode’s flaws are abundant and quite detrimental. Outside of Explosion, Electrode has very few distinctive moves for an Electric-type Pokemon. Without Body Slam or Double-Edge, let alone any diverse coverage move, Electrode is forced to use moves like Take Down just to damage Ground-type Pokemon. Electrode's offenses are also inferior to those of its main competitors, Electabuzz and Raichu. These flaws culminate into Electrode being relatively easy to wall and KO. As such, using Electrode often boils down to attacking once or twice and then trying to get lucky with Explosion. It is a high-risk Pokemon that requires accurate predictions and a little bit of luck to reap a proportionate reward.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder is an option open to every Electric-type Pokemon so they can hit a little harder at the cost of some accuracy. Two notable benchmarks for Electrode's Thunder include a possible 2HKO against Vaporeon and a guaranteed 2HKO against Tentacruel, which Thunderbolt misses and only has a 5.4% chance to do, respectively.</p> <p>Electrode has a number of defensive options such as Light Screen and Rest. These can be used to improve a few particular matchups, such as against other Electric-types. Rest is notable for curing Electrode of paralysis, which is usually fatal for it. Overall, offensive options tend to be a lot more useful.</p> <p>Substitute can be helpful on such a prediction-reliant Pokemon. For example, it can serve as a nice midground play in situations like the Dugtrio matchup. If Dugtrio switches, Electrode can attack more freely on the next turn, and if Dugtrio attacks, Electrode will suffer a smaller penalty. However, like the defensive options, it is difficult to find a spot for Substitute.</p> <p>Flash can be somewhat useful at motivating the foe to switch and can hinder Wrap users. However, Screech and Thunder Wave tend to accomplish these goals better and have superior accuracy.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-type Pokemon are pretty tricky for Electrode because they pressure it to use a weak Normal-type move or Explosion. Golem is Electrode’s worst nightmare because it takes roughly 20% from Explosion. Golem can switch into Electrode freely and repeatedly, and then fire off a free STAB attack or set up a Substitute. Electrode can threaten Dugtrio with Explosion, but Dugtrio can survive the attack two-thirds of the time and is relatively unafraid of a paralyzed Electrode.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Paralysis is a death sentence for Electrode. Electrode is incredibly reliant on its Speed, so taking that away exposes its middling defenses. Paralyzed Electrode can be easily KOed by wallbreakers and sweepers like Dugtrio, Kangaskhan, Persian, Articuno, and so on. Additionally, the 25% chance of full paralysis may also keep a weakened Electrode from using Explosion before it is KOed.</p> <p><strong>Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon: While not quite as bad as Ground-type Pokemon, Grass-type Pokemon also wall Electrode. Thunderbolt deals very little damage to Pokemon like Tangela and Venusaur, so they can goad it into using Explosion. Additionally, status moves like Sleep Powder and Stun Spore will hamper Electrode’s usefulness. Electric-type Pokemon similarly resist Thunderbolt and can paralyze Electrode. While neither really wants to take Thunder Wave, Electabuzz and Raichu have better coverage moves than Electrode, so they will generally win one-on-one or force Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Explosion: Aside from Golem, most common Rock- and Ghost-type Pokemon do not want to switch into Electrode. However, having them on a team can still make Electrode hesitate to use Explosion, into which they switch fairly comfortably.</p> ",

          "name": "Fast Attacker",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is pretty much Electrode's only reliable source of damage. Electrode isn't the strongest user of Thunderbolt, but it can still hit common Pokemon like Tentacruel, Dodrio, and bulky Water-type Pokemon for good damage, especially if it scores a critical hit. Assuming the opponent lacks a Ground-type Pokemon, Electrode can reliably paralyze any foe thanks to its high Speed. This is particularly useful for slowing down Agility sweepers like Articuno and Dragonite. Electrode's reliance on Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave encourages Ground-type Pokemon to switch in, so it is wise to run Pokemon that can capitalize on this, such as Gyarados, Poliwrath, and Tangela. Hypno is also likely to switch in against Electrode, making fast sleep users such as Venusaur good partners as well.</p> <p>Explosion is Electrode’s main selling point. While Electrode’s base Attack stat of 50 is underwhelming, Explosion is still quite strong, especially if it happens to be a critical hit. Explosion has many desirable targets, such as Dugtrio, Hypno, Tentacruel, and Kadabra, the last of which will always be KOed. However, there are also many Pokemon that Electrode doesn’t want to hit, such as Rock-type Pokemon, sleeping and frozen Pokemon, and, worst of all, Haunter. Electrode is thus a very prediction-heavy Pokemon. As an example, suppose Electrode is face-to-face with Dugtrio. Explosion can OHKO Dugtrio, especially if Dugtrio took a little chip damage. Dugtrio will deal a minimum of 73% to Electrode with Earthquake. This creates a 50/50 situation of whether Dugtrio will switch out in fear of Explosion or stay in and hope Electrode overpredicts by using something else. Electrode creates situations like this a lot, especially if it is played in the mid- or late-game. Using Electrode effectively often means making some bold (or lucky) predictions or spending a lot of effort so these predictions aren’t necessary. This volatility can help Electrode take down some important targets with little issue but also risks it fainting for naught. If Electrode does hit its desired target, it establishes a better position for its teammates. For example, blowing up on Tentacruel or Hypno might help Articuno sweep, while hitting Dugtrio should keep Pokemon like Kadabra and Raichu safe.</p> <p>Screech helps Electrode get the most out of its Explosion. While the move may suffer from an unimpressive accuracy of 84.4%, over half the Pokemon prominent in the RBY UU metagame may or will faint to Electrode's Explosion after Screech. Not only will key offensive Pokemon like Tentacruel, Dugtrio, and Persian be guaranteed to faint, but bulkier Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Vaporeon, and Gyarados have a chance as well. This threat incentivizes foes to switch without actually forcing Electrode to blow up, allowing it to potentially use Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave uncontested or bring in a teammate more safely. Screech is also remarkably useful in situations where the foe is unwilling or unable to switch, like after it has used a stat-boosting move or when it is the last Pokemon remaining. In these cases, Electrode can be more confident that it will be able to deal large amounts of damage to its desired target.</p> <p>Despite Screech's benefits, it is still viable to run an arbitrary Normal-type attack just so Electrode can hit Ground-type foes without KOing itself. Take Down can be fairly strong with a critical hit, but it is otherwise a painfully mediocre move with low accuracy as well as recoil, and Hyper Beam, while powerful, can leave Electrode susceptible to being paralyzed or KOed if it fails to KO the foe first.</p> <p>Finally, it is worth noting that Electrode can serve as a lead. This is partially because Electrode has much trouble switching into most Pokemon. While not as consistent as more traditional choices, Electrode can break a few holes earlier in the match and help its teammates arrange a sweep by mixing up options like fast Thunder Wave, STAB Thunderbolt, and powerful Explosion. Conversely, Electrode's high Speed makes it a decent late-game sweeper as well. However, its poor coverage tends to make Pokemon like Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Agility users superior options for the role.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Once widely considered to be the fourth best Pokemon in the RBY metagame as well as the best sleeper available, Exeggutor has recently suffered a drop in reputation and viability, though it remains a popular choice. A combination of Explosion, Sleep Powder, and Psychic, in addition to unique typing and solid base stats, makes it an easy pick for a large number of RBY teams. Despite the unfortunate Ice weakness, its resistance to Ground-type attacks makes it one of the most reliable Rhydon switch-ins; it is also the most reliable answer to the uncommon but threatening Slowbro. A combination of defensive utility and wallbreaking power earns Exeggutor a spot on many RBY teams; however, teams that already feature other sleepers may find it redundant, and its inability to recover damage can make it undesirable to some teams.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Exeggutor has a large movepool that can allow it to fill different roles, but none of the following options has seen high-level success in in any combination. Exeggutor can use Rest to get consistent value out of its strong Psychic and Stun Spore, as well as consistently check opposing Exeggutor, Rhydon, Alakazam, Jolteon without Pin Missile, and Blizzard-less Starmie variants throughout a game. However, this often invites in offensive behemoths like Tauros for free, which makes it very difficult to justify over conventional, standard sets. Alternatively, Egg Bomb hits as hard as Double-Edge and has no recoil, but its low accuracy makes it a generally inferior choice. Finally, Exeggutor has access to decent defensive and utility moves such as Reflect, Toxic, Leech Seed, and even Mimic, but these are often seen as strictly suboptimal.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Starmie, Alakazam, and Jynx: These Pokemon are often on the receiving end of a turn 1 Thunder Wave, which makes them solid switch-ins to Sleep Powder, although they must watch out for aggressive predictions from the Exeggutor user. Although they are not fully reliable in all situations, they are often the best available option to safely switch in on Exeggutor, and should be able to threaten it with Thunder Wave or Blizzard while keeping themselves healthy to answer it repeatedly thanks to Recover or Rest.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Exeggutor simply has no ways to consistently get through Chansey outside of Sleep Powder and Explosion, which come with their obvious limitations. A paralyzed Chansey leaves Exeggutor with no options other than to Explode, pray for multiple full paralysis + Special drops with Psychic, or switch out.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor can't really harm each other much, and unless one of the Exeggutor is able to land Sleep Powder on the other, this one-on-one matchup most often ends with one of the Exeggutor Exploding on the other to trade evenly.</p> <p><strong>Lapras and Zapdos</strong>: Although they are by no means switch-ins, Lapras and Zapdos threaten a 2HKO with Blizzard and Drill Peck respectively, while Lapras also outspeeds Exeggutor and is able to threaten it with Sing, which means that either of these Pokemon find themselves in a one-on-one against Exeggutor they are generally favored.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Sleep Powder is an extremely threatening move, as incredibly dangerous Pokemon such as Tauros can switch on a sleeping Pokemon with little risk and cause havoc; counterplay to Exeggutor is often centered around absorbing it and containing its effects. Psychic is a powerful attack that threatens significant damage to anything other than special sponges, and is Exeggutor's main weapon against threats such as Snorlax. Explosion is an incredibly useful move that allows Exeggutor to bring something down with it and can create incredibly favorable situations if used correctly; however, the user must be careful of its Explosion being too predictable, as there are a number of ways to neutralize it, such as with Rock- or Ghost-type Pokemon, or sacrificing a Pokemon already affected by a strong status condition such as sleep or freeze. The fourth slot is the most contentious, as none of the four moves listed clearly outshine the other options. Double-Edge is a strong attack capable of breaking down paralyzed Jynx or Alakazam with minimal previous damage, an excellent tool to have at your disposal because both of these Pokemon commonly switch in on Exeggutor to absorb its Sleep Powder. Stun Spore allows Exeggutor to continue to cripple potential answers even after Sleep Clause is activated; this is especially useful when facing teams with multiple special sponges. Despite Mega Drain's pitiful Base Power, it ends up being Exeggutor's best tool against Starmie, and while the move is otherwise relatively useless, Starmie is another very common answer to Exeggutor, so Mega Drain has its merits. Finally, Hyper Beam is capable of sniping Starmie, Alakazam, Jynx, and even Chansey if they have taken sufficient damage before attempting to switch in into Exeggutor, but it is entirely useless if they have not, and it can have terrible drawbacks if predicted correctly by the opponent; nevertheless, its utility against every common special sponge should not be underestimated.</p> <p>Thanks to this set, Exeggutor is able to answer tier titans such as Chansey and Snorlax and apply huge amounts of pressure on the opponent's team. While its lack of recovery and susceptibility to status makes it a fairly difficult piece to maneuver with, the options in its toolbox make it a difficult threat to answer. Exeggutor players should try to damage or KO paralyzed opposing Pokemon that are able to block Sleep Powder in order to clear the way for it, as landing a Sleep Powder is often game-changing. The easiest and most common ways to find opportunities to send Exeggutor out on the field are on a predicted Chansey using Soft-Boiled or Snorlax using Rest; the former will have to respect the Sleep Powder threat and switch out, while the latter is not only scared of the sleep threat, but also vulnerable to Psychic itself. Once Exeggutor is on the field, the threat that Sleep Powder poses generates strong momentum for the player using it, but it must be followed up by strong predictions to progress the game favorably; using Sleep Powder on an incoming paralyzed Pokemon is simply a wasted turn, but so is Double-Edge on a Snorlax. The stress of prediction can be eased by sending Exeggutor on the field before paralyzing any foes, such as by leading with it. Although landing Sleep Powder this way is much easier, it is also less rewarding due to having to absorb early pressure, status, or damage on Exeggutor.</p> <p>The last detail to touch on is the usage of Explosion. Although most players are tempted to keep Explosion as a tool to get value out of a low health Exeggutor, one should try to recognize when such a line of play might be too greedy. For example, in situations where Exeggutor would not be able to make much progress at all even with a full health bar, it can be advantageous to use Explosion earlier on, when it is harder to predict and therefore more likely to hit the intended target. However, you should be careful of your matchup against Rhydon when choosing to get rid of your Exeggutor early, as it can be very dangerous to get rid of your sturdiest defensive answer to it. It's also possible to use Explosion to get rid of a Sleep Powder answer for a secondary sleeper on your team, most commonly Lapras, but this is a last resort option only in most cases.</p> "

Lickitung can use Body Slam repeatedly in order to spread its own paralysis, but it's still walled effectively by most bulky Pokemon if it doesn't manage to get a paralysis off, and it can be removed incredibly easily by most special attackers due to its pitiful Special stat.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>At first glance, you wouldn't expect a Pokemon like Weezing to be so underwhelming. When you factor in its great bulk—as well as a solid offensive movepool featuring moves like Thunderbolt, Fire Blast, and Explosion—it does initially look quite serviceable. It's even one of only two Pokemon in the game with access to Sludge, giving it a decent Poison-type STAB move that lets it spread poison efficiently. Sludge can cripple a variety of wrappers such as Dragonair, Rapidash, and Pinsir, the latter of which is hit super effectively. Its Poison typing also helps guard your team against this, letting it switch in on Toxic to protect your own wrappers.</p> <p>However, that's all the good things one can say about Weezing. Weezing's Speed and typing are awful; this means that most, if not all, of the metagame's big threats such as Mr. Mime, Nidoking, and Golem can answer it, possessing super effective coverage to invalidate its bulk while often being able to switch in comfortably. Ergo, Weezing is often a momentum sink. To add on to this, better Poison-types like Venomoth, Nidoking, and even Muk make it very hard for Weezing to find a spot on any competitive RBY NU team.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>This is the best Weezing can muster; its movepool is deceptively shallow. Weezing has among the strongest Explosions in the tier, only being beaten out by Muk and Golem, allowing it to OHKO Mr. Mime, Rapidash, and Electrode, though the latter two aren't guaranteed. The combination of Fire Blast and Thunderbolt lets Weezing hit almost the entire tier for at least neutral damage; Fire Blast is of particular note for giving Weezing an answer to Exeggcute, while Thunderbolt 2HKOes Poliwhirl and Flying-types like Fearow and Aerodactyl. The last moveslot is largely subjective; Hyper Beam KOes Mr. Mime and Raticate from around half HP, while Sludge is more reliable while coming with a very high poison chance.</p> <p>While its movepool is tiny, Weezing can be customized to some degree. Thunder can be used for a boost in power at the cost of consistency, letting Weezing 2HKO Blastoise, Charizard, Kabutops, and Seadra. While Weezing is efficient at spreading status thanks to Fire Blast and Sludge, Toxic is a valid option to consistently prevent wrappers like Dragonair, Rapidash, and Charizard from taking over games. Finally, Rest can theoretically give more bang for your buck with Weezing's bulk, but its defensive typing makes it difficult to actually wake up. Weezing is best used on offensive teams that can benefit from the holes its Explosion tears in teams; thus, Pokemon like Moltres and Kingler make good partners. Additionally, a Pokemon that can remove Golem such as Blastoise or Seadra can help; otherwise, Weezing tends to let it in for free. Even when Weezing benefits teams, Muk is often superior for its access to Body Slam and a stronger Explosion.</p> "

  "Rhydon": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Rhydon possesses a very important place in RBY OU thanks to a fairly unique typing and formidable Attack stat; moreover, its Earthquake is the most powerful physical attack in the game without a drawback. Rhydon's typing gives it a good amount of defensive utility, such as switching in to force and punish Hyper Beam recharges, taking Explosions, staving off Thunder Wave, and stonewalling Zapdos and Jolteon. Thanks to the immense Attack stat it has, Rhydon can hit very high damage ranges, the most notable one being a guaranteed 2HKO on Chansey. It's also capable of KOing Tauros after two Body Slams from other Tauros. This power makes it very difficult to switch into, with would-be checks such as Exeggutor taking surprising damage. While initially slow, Rhydon is also a very scary foe for paralyzed teams to fight, often folding to it outright by virtue of its immense power. Naturally, this also means it appreciates paralysis support from teammates such as Chansey. It can still outspeed Slowbro and Snorlax, however, allowing it to force damage on non-Reflect variants of the two.</p> <p>Golem has competed with Rhydon for a place on teams for many years. This is primarily due to the fact that it has the second strongest Explosion in the game, only beaten by Snorlax, along with higher Speed to win against Rhydon specifically. However, its low HP leaves it without access to 101-HP Substitutes. This makes it significantly worse against Chansey, as they will break against its Seismic Toss. It also has little reward for the increased Speed, only gaining the ability to outrun Rhydon. The lower damage output also causes Golem to lose out on some very valuable ranges, notably losing to the aforementioned Reflect Chansey more often than not, which Rhydon excels against. Due to these factors, Rhydon is generally favored over Golem in the metagame.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Out of all of Rhydon's moves, the most replaceable would be Rock Slide. This is because the coverage provided by it is rather specific, while the other moves add key utility that is pivotal to Rhydon's success. When dropping Rock Slide, be wary of the fact that Earthquake is a 4HKO on Cloyster and a 3HKO on Lapras, and you'll have a much harder time versus Moltres and Articuno, though the two legendary birds are not that common. Should these qualities be useful, however, Body Slam can be dropped instead. In this case, though, Rhydon can't set up paralysis for itself, causing it to become much more reliant on teammates. This makes matchups against threats such as Starmie noticeably worse.</p> <p>Rest can be used to give Rhydon more longevity, but it's hard to wake up due to being 2HKOed by Tauros. It's generally used on more defensive teams to better handle Zapdos and Jolteon throughout a game, but it does have uses outside of this. Rest can be extremely helpful against Reflect Chansey, enabling Rhydon to be more aggressive and burn free Rest turns behind Substitute. It also helps against Snorlax without coverage, as Rhydon despises being paralyzed by Snorlax on switch-in. Another option to consider is Leer; this allows Rhydon to beat Reflect Chansey much more reliably and gives it a way to get past Reflect Snorlax. However, these Pokemon can switch out to get rid of the Defense drops. This also gives faster Pokemon the opportunity to switch in on the Leer while taking no damage, which can give the opponent opportunities to play around Rhydon's usual sweeping. When spamming Earthquake, on the other hand, a critical hit would ruin Reflect Chansey and Snorlax, and switching out would still likely force damage on whatever comes in. Counter can be used to more heavily punish Hyper Beam and Explosion usage, flipping the situation on the opponent. Bringing in Rhydon after an opponent's Explosion and using Counter after forcing their switch-in out can usually lead to a free KO. While gimmicky, Bubble Beam could be used for other Rhydon or Golem, which can lead to a Speed drop, guaranteeing a KO with Earthquake. It can also allow Rhydon to move first against Exeggutor on switch-in, which can allow Rhydon to situationally win the interaction should it be worn down.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Exeggutor: Exeggutor is the best check for Rhydon in the game. It resists Earthquake and doesn't take much damage from Rock Slide, which is only a 4HKO. However, it must watch out for Body Slam. In fact, most variants of Rhydon will use Body Slam expecting an Exeggutor switch-in if it's still healthy. A paralyzed Exeggutor won't be able to reliably check Rhydon anymore, as two Rock Slides will deal upwards of 55% of damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros is only 3HKOed by Earthquake and can 2HKO Rhydon with Blizzard in return, which, when combined with Tauros's absurdly high critical hit rate and the chance of freeze, means that Rhydon is almost always forced out, and even if it doesn't switch out, there's a respectable chance that it does absolutely nothing in return. However, Tauros doesn't appreciate being damaged, especially if the Tauros on Rhydon's team is still at full HP. Rhydon will usually be forced out after KOing a Pokemon due to this, which gives Tauros ample opportunity to start exerting its sweeping prowess.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster is only 4HKOed by Earthquake and 3HKOed by Rock Slide, and it can OHKO a third of the time in return with Blizzard. It even packs Clamp for denying a free move to Rhydon when it's staying behind a Substitute, as Clamp will always break the Substitute and render Rhydon immobile in the process.</p> <p><strong>Starmie and Chansey</strong>: These two Pokemon are able to switch in on Rhydon and duel it, but only if they are not paralyzed, and Chansey requires Reflect. Chansey is 2HKOed by Earthquake, and Starmie, while very rarely 2HKOed by Earthquake, can be paralyzed by Body Slam on the switch or on a predicted Recover, turning the tides in Rhydon's favor. The paralysis factor makes these matchups extremely variable.</p> <p><strong>Victreebel</strong>: Victreebel outspeeds and OHKOes Rhydon with Razor Leaf. However, it takes a huge chunk of damage from Earthquake, with a likely roll to 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro threatens to OHKO Rhydon with Surf, and with Reflect, it can effortlessly set up Amnesia against it. Thunder Wave can also be used on a switch prediction to worsen the situation. However, it does take significant damage coming in, making it a check at best.</p> <p><strong>Lapras and Jynx</strong>: These Pokemon can OHKO Rhydon with their Ice-type moves, but they struggle to switch in because of the threat of Rock Slide, as it will almost always 2HKO Lapras and always OHKO Jynx. Paralyzing them also turns these two Ice-type Pokemon into prey for Rhydon to feast on.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: Golem outspeeds Rhydon and 2HKOes it with Earthquake. However, Rhydon also 2HKOes Golem with its own Earthquake, meaning Golem cannot switch in at all.</p> <p><strong>Reflect Snorlax</strong>: While Rhydon is only 3HKOed by Earthquake and Ice Beam, it struggles heavily when actually KOing Snorlax without critical hits if Reflect is active. Earthquake can deal up to 38% before Reflect goes up, but after that, the damage is negligible at best. Reflect Snorlax does give Rhydon a good amount of opportunities to fish for critical hits, so this matchup can be quite volatile. Snorlax also has issues switching in, making it a check at best.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This is the set one should expect when seeing Rhydon. Rhydon's Earthquake is the strongest physical move in the game with no drawbacks, hitting anything that doesn't resist it extremely hard. Rock Slide is mostly used for Zapdos and hitting Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Cloyster, and Lapras harder. Body Slam is extremely valuable for Rhydon's success, as it allows Rhydon to generate its own paralysis support against the likes of Exeggutor, Starmie, Alakazam, and Lapras. Substitute is a complex move on Rhydon's moveset and one that is generally hard for inexperienced players to understand the true potential of, but it can single-handedly win games; its ability to create a 103-HP Substitute means that they can't be broken by Seismic Toss Chansey, which gives Rhydon the edge in the one-on-one against it. This also means that Rhydon can create Substitutes versus Pokemon that can't significantly damage it, such as Zapdos and Jolteon, giving it a free hit against whatever comes in afterwards, which can either instantly mean a win for the Rhydon user or dealing a huge chunk of damage to a replacement like Tauros. Substitute is also extremely helpful against paralyzed Starmie, giving Rhydon time to fish for full paralysis to stay in. Rhydon can then go for the uncommon 2HKO with Earthquake or even a possible OHKO with a critical hit. Should Starmie be paralyzed by Body Slam switching in, Rhydon is in a very good position to go for this.</p> <p>Despite being slow, it's very hard to switch into Rhydon if you lack Exeggutor, making it one of the key reasons for Exeggutor's success in RBY OU. It's an absolute nightmare for players to deal with Rhydon if they have a paralyzed team, as Rhydon will easily rampage through it. It's a very viable strategy in RBY OU to build a team around Rhydon, providing it with the paralysis support it needs to clean up the mess. Its key immunity to Electric-type moves, namely Thunder Wave, means that it's very hard to reliably paralyze Rhydon and also gives it switch-in opportunities on Pokemon such as Alakazam and Chansey. It is also the premier counter to Zapdos and Jolteon, two Pokemon that can be very dangerous in its absence—especially Zapdos—due to the few Electric-resistant Pokemon in RBY OU. Rhydon also resists Normal-type moves, which means it can switch into a predicted Explosion or Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Despite all of the advantages, Rhydon is heavily reliant on opposing Pokemon being paralyzed to get in safely. It has very poor Special; this and its typing can make it easy prey for almost every special attacker in the tier. As a result, Rhydon tends to struggle one-on-one against non-paralyzed threats, notably Tauros, Starmie, and Exeggutor.</p> "

  "Chansey": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Chansey is a staple in the RBY metagame, present on nearly 100% of competitive teams. The reason for its extreme popularity mostly lies in its gargantuan special bulk neutralizing Psychic-types, an otherwise incredibly difficult task without using Psychic-types of your own, as well as its ability to completely wall other special attackers like Lapras. It does not perform as well against physical attackers, however; strong hits from the likes of Snorlax and Rhydon can threaten an easy 2HKO, so Chansey must be wary of these threats whenever entering the field, although it does possess tools to ease these matchups despite its generally innocuous offensive presence. Nonetheless, Chansey is somewhat of a requirement in any RBY team due to the risks you would take against Psychic-types without it.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While it is generally recommended to stick to the above combinations, Chansey is free to mix and match its options, with the only mandatory move being Soft-Boiled. Sets such as Counter + Sing or Thunder Wave + Seismic Toss, Reflect + Ice Beam + Thunderbolt, and Seismic Toss + Ice Beam + Thunder Wave can all perform admirably on the right team, so if you want to rebalance certain matchups for your team, feel free to explore different, less conventional ways to combine Chansey's best moves.</p> <p>Defense Curl is an option over Reflect in the typical Reflect set. Boosting Chansey's Defense past +2 usually makes little difference, but its 64 PP allow you to win PP wars against opposing Reflect Chansey and Snorlax handily as well as significantly increase Chansey's odds in a PP stall against Alakazam and Starmie, which is a useful advantage in its own right; however, Reflect's one-turn setup is significantly better when Chansey switches in on Snorlax, so it's generally preferred.</p> <p>Toxic is another curveball that synergizes well with partial trappers such as Cloyster, Moltres, or Victreebel, as the damage quickly stacks up on targets that would otherwise be able to endure their hits, such as opposing Chansey; also, a Chansey carrying Toxic should beat any Chansey that isn't carrying Ice Beam in the long run due to the damage from the poison.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Snorlax: Snorlax's Body Slam 3HKOes Chansey, forcing it to keep using Soft-Boiled in most situations; as Body Slam's 24 PP outlasts Soft-Boiled's 16, Chansey cannot afford to outstall the attacks, especially when you also factor in the odds of critical hits as well as the potential Hyper Beam from Snorlax. Even when Chansey is carrying Reflect, a Snorlax with Rest is often not even forced to switch out, as it has really good odds of breaking through eventually between critical hits and PP count. The best option for Chansey is to force Snorlax to use Rest and then switch out to something that can threaten it while it's sleeping. While this is not an awful short-term scenario for the Chansey player, as the Snorlax will need some free turns to wake up, Snorlax can easily find those turns whenever Chansey hits the field again, putting it in yet another situation where it is bound to lose if it doesn't switch out. If the Snorlax carries Ice Beam, it can also attempt to freeze Chansey, and in the worst case for Snorlax, it can trade with Chansey by using Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam and Starmie</strong>: Chansey has no way to significantly damage Alakazam, and while it won't be doing much damage back, it can win the PP war thanks to Recover's massive 32 PP unless it gets fully paralyzed several times in a row. Alakazam can also simply fire off Psychic until Chansey's Special drops low enough that it's forced to switch out, but Psychic's limited 16 PP means this can generally only happen two or three times per game. Starmie functions very similarly, as long as the Chansey doesn't have Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Sleepers</strong>: Chansey will be healing up a lot throughout the game. If you can send a sleep move user such as Exeggutor out on a predicted Soft-Boiled, Chansey will have to respect the threat of Sleep Powder and switch out.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Depending on the sets, Chansey can be an excellent Chansey counter. Ice Beam threatens to freeze any unparalyzed Chansey, while a paralyzed Reflect Chansey is going to PP stall most other Chansey with ease. Sing Chansey can also surprise the opponent's Chansey and land a sleep on it, and even if it misses, Sing will remain threatening and have to be respected with a switch.</p> <p><strong>Explosion Lures</strong>: Exeggutor, Cloyster, and Gengar can usually manage to get Chansey on the field to sponge one of their powerful special attacks and catch it with an Explosion to take it out. This is especially viable for teams running a Pokemon such as Lapras or Psychic-less Starmie, which are otherwise completely walled by Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon: While Rhydon has to respect the Ice Beam threat, its Earthquake achieves a guaranteed 2HKO, so it can sometimes accept taking the Ice Beam damage in exchange for a KO on Chansey. It's even better against Chansey sets that don't run Ice Beam, as it can create Substitutes with enough HP to tank two Seismic Tosses and use Earthquake freely. Both of these situations only really favor Rhydon if the Chansey is paralyzed, however, so make sure to set up its status properly before attempting to win with Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: If Chansey is not running Thunderbolt, Slowbro can freely get Amnesia boosts on it, periodically heal any damage with Rest, and eventually KO via the STAB move of choice as soon as Chansey gets fully paralyzed. Chansey should generally switch out of Slowbro whenever possible, as it can get very threatening very quickly otherwise.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon</strong>: If Jolteon carries Rest, it is able to repeatedly shrug off Chansey's attempts at damage until Double Kick critical hits and paralysis manages to take Chansey down. This leaves Jolteon very vulnerable during its Rest turns, so you should be careful when attempting this.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: If all else fails, Tauros can come in on a paralyzed Chansey and take it out with Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam, but Tauros really hates being paralyzed, so you should only use this option as a last resort.</p> ",

          "name": "Reflect",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Reflect halves the damage received from physical attacks, patching up Chansey's biggest weakness. Soft-Boiled is a necessity to allow Chansey to check threats and stay healthy throughout the game. Thunder Wave is necessary to punish any Tauros that may attempt to ruin your fun by negating Reflect with a critical hit; it's also generally strong utility and one of the most threatening tools in Chansey's arsenal. Seismic Toss is the preferred move to deal damage, as it hits for a consistent 100 HP, but Ice Beam, while resisted by many Pokemon, still threatens a deadly freeze on everything other than Ice-types. If you choose to rely on Ice Beam as your only attacking move, you will have to be careful not to paralyze Pokemon such as Starmie, as Chansey loses all offensive pressure against it without the possibility to freeze it.</p> <p>Reflect Chansey is one of the best early- and mid-game pivots, while also retaining good enough one-on-one matchups to remain a threat in the later stages of the game. This set's biggest selling point is the ability to switch into Snorlax's Body Slam without having to fear paralysis, allowing it to always set up Reflect, heal off all the damage with Soft-Boiled, and then safely chip away at the opposition via Seismic Toss. An important decision is going to present itself often when playing Reflect Chansey: letting it take a Thunder Wave will make it immune to freezes, allowing it to take on Ice Beam Chansey and win the PP war as well as making it a reliable answer to Exeggutor since it won't have to fear Sleep Powder anymore; however, this will make Chansey much less effective at switching in on Snorlax, and other threats such as Rhydon will also have a much better time against it. Managing the status of your Reflect Chansey is extremely important, and making the right decisions can often swing the tides of the game in your favor. It should be mentioned that a paralyzed Reflect Chansey will also have much more trouble facing Psychic-types due to the 30% chance of dropping its Special via Psychic; it is relatively easy for one of them to accumulate two or more drops and force it to switch out, thus removing Reflect and significantly weakening its effectiveness against physical threats for the rest of the game, unless it is given the free turns to set it up again.</p> "

          "name": "BoltBeam",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>BoltBeam coverage allows Chansey to put pressure on a large part of the metagame. Thunderbolt threatens Water-type Pokemon such as Starmie and Lapras, while Ice Beam threatens to freeze opposing Chansey and deals heavy damage to other common threats such as Rhydon, Exeggutor, and Zapdos. Soft-Boiled is necessary to remain healthy throughout the game, and Thunder Wave is Chansey's main weapon to cripple threats like Tauros and hinder anything else that tries to beat Chansey one-on-one.</p> <p>BoltBeam Chansey will always have to be careful maneuvering around Snorlax, as it doesn't have the tools to face Snorlax one-on-one; this is especially true for Snorlax that carry Rest. BoltBeam Chansey often wants to get paralyzed so it can avoid freezes and sleep, but this makes the Snorlax matchup even worse, and since it's such a threatening Pokemon to begin with, you may want to be careful with accepting Thunder Wave on your Chansey. Another tough matchup is Alakazam, which can easily sponge all of Chansey's attacks and retaliate with repeated Psychic that will eventually cause multiple Special drops and force Chansey off the field; even if Alakazam runs out of Psychic PP, it can often win an all-out PP stall. However, BoltBeam Chansey has a much happier time against the other common Psychic users due to super effective coverage on both Starmie and Exeggutor. Ice Beam also allows Chansey to win against non-Ice Beam Chansey thanks to the freeze chance, so long as the opposing Chansey isn't paralyzed — when it is, this matchup turns around, as Ice Beam's relatively low 16 PP will usually cause BoltBeam Chansey to lose the PP war.</p> "

          "name": "Sing",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Sing is one of the premier Chansey sets. Although the high risk of missing may appear dangerous, Chansey is unlikely to take much punishment in return from any special attacker, so it is a common and successful strategy to simply switch Sing Chansey on a Pokemon like Starmie very early on and put it to sleep immediately. As Soft-Boiled is mandatory, using Sing leaves two moveslots open, usually to be filled with one attacking move and one utility move. The most common attacking move is Ice Beam, as the freeze threat is quite potent against most special attackers, which cannot harm Chansey all that much. However, running Ice Beam as your only damaging move leaves Chansey entirely toothless against Ice-types such as Jynx, Cloyster, and Lapras, so you may want to opt for Seismic Toss instead. As for the utility move, Thunder Wave is handy to cripple various threats, most notably physical attackers that pose an urgent threat to Chansey but really dislike being paralyzed, such as Tauros. Counter, on the other hand, is a specific tool to take care of Snorlax. Due to Chansey's gigantic HP stat, it will OHKO Snorlax after taking a single Body Slam, which is Snorlax's go-to STAB move and main way to damage Chansey. Once Counter is revealed, Snorlax can use moves that Counter can't reply to, such as Earthquake and Ice Beam, and then switch out to a more appropriate check; this means that it is of vital importance for Chansey to land its Counter the first time it uses it, as getting any mileage out of it in the rest of the game is going to be quite unlikely.</p> <p>Sing Chansey's dream scenario is to switch in on a Turn 1 Thunder Wave, allowing it to neutralize incoming sleep moves for the rest of the game, and immediately firing off Sing to achieve what is essentially a full Pokemon advantage due to RBY's notorious sleep mechanics. This threat means Sing Chansey is a strong antimeta pick, as it is commonplace for leads such as Starmie and Alakazam to want to use Thunder Wave in the first turn of the game. However, this strategy is very well known, especially at higher levels of play, so expecting opponents to use Thunder Wave on the first turn may result in heartbreak. Should these types of mindgames not appeal to you, it is also possible to hide Chansey's Sing until later in the game, attempting to bluff a different set and catch a more valuable target than you otherwise would have; however, this is largely reliant on hitting your very first Sing, which is only a 55% chance, as the surprise factor will be blown afterwards.</p> <p>It should be mentioned that Sing Chansey can also function as a lead; although its matchup against faster sleepers such as Gengar, Jynx, and Exeggutor is abysmal, it is able to comfortably land a Sing when facing common leads such as Alakazam and Starmie.</p> "

    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Upon first glance, it may be difficult to ascertain why any player would even consider using Tangela in a competitive match. It has very little offensive presence, a limited movepool, and a Speed lower than even Vaporeon. It is also quite vulnerable to Wrap users and Ice-type moves, both of which are rather common in the tier. It makes sense that Tangela was first perceived as little more than a gimmick.</p> <p>While Tangela is still far from a staple, it has begun to establish itself in the tier because it compresses a precise combination of desirable traits. For starters, the pure Grass typing makes Tangela a strong check to Earthquake users like Dugtrio and Golem without picking up a weakness to Rock Slide. It similarly prepares Tangela to check Electric-types like Electabuzz and Raichu. Sleep Powder is a blessing in a tier where the few other sleep inducers largely rely on the rather inaccurate Hypnosis, making Tangela more reliable and freeing up Hypnosis users to explore alternative sets and play more aggressively. Additionally, Tangela's access to Stun Spore lets it stymie opposing sweepers and Wrap users, such as Dugtrio and Tentacruel, while also enabling friendly sweepers and Wrap users. Stun Spore is also notable for being the only move that can paralyze Dugtrio behind a Substitute. Finally, while it is not on the level of defensive staples like Vaporeon and Omastar, Tangela can be a makeshift check to a lot of common sweepers when at full health. Normal-type Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Persian usually win the matchup but tend to fear paralysis. Tangela does not fit on every team by any means, but its unique combination of defensive and supportive traits can make it the perfect choice on a select few, rather potent teams.</p> <p>Even with all of these positives, Tangela still has many flaws and can be easily exploited by many Pokemon. Tangela's extremely low Speed makes it easy to chip down with Wrap and revenge kill. Its Grass typing also leaves it vulnerable to Ice-type moves from the likes of Articuno and the tier’s many Water-type Pokemon, as well as Dodrio’s Drill Peck. Poor offensive options also leave it nearly unable to touch some Pokemon, including Dragonite, Haunter, and other Grass-type Pokemon. Finally, Sleep Powder's and Stun Spore's imperfect accuracy can occasionally mean the difference between a win and a loss. Thus, Tangela should only be used when its unique role compression cannot be replicated by other team members.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>By far the most enticing option in Tangela’s toolkit is a Swords Dance set with Body Slam, Hyper Beam, or both. However, boosting is really difficult in RBY UU, especially when neither Speed nor a defensive stat is rising. Moreover, Tangela’s Attack stat and physical movepool are dismal, making such a set underwhelming even in ideal conditions.</p> <p>When experimenting with different sets for Tangela, generally refrain from removing Tangela's status moves, especially Sleep Powder. This keeps it from being outclassed by other defensive Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Once Tangela uses Stun Spore against Haunter, it is virtually incapable of further threatening it. Haunter resists or is immune to every single move Tangela can learn. Even if Tangela somehow maximizes its Special with Growth, Mega Drain can only sometimes score a 4HKO. Haunter, on the other hand, scores an easy 4HKO with Night Shade or a 5HKO or better with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: All of the tier’s prominent Flying-type Pokemon threaten Tangela. Much like Haunter, Dragonite is simply not afraid of any move that Tangela can throw at it. Dragonite can use its superior Speed to work Tangela’s health down with Wrap and easily put it away with Blizzard or any powerful physical attack, possibly even leaving the entire exchange unscathed. Articuno similarly fears none any of Tangela’s attacks, and its incredibly strong Blizzard boasts an impressive 51.3% chance to simply OHKO Tangela. The rare Moltres functions nearly identically and takes even less from Mega Drain. Dodrio does fear paralysis and doesn't have Wrap to avoid getting hit like Dragonite, but it can easily revenge kill Tangela, as Drill Peck is a clean 2HKO. Gyarados has the least desirable matchup of the Flying-type Pokemon but can still 2HKO with Blizzard provided Tangela doesn’t reclaim too much health with Mega Drain.</p> <p><strong>Grass-, Bug-, and Fire-type Pokemon: While these Pokemon are a fair deal less common than the Pokemon discussed above, they still check Tangela thoroughly. While it admittedly can’t do much in return, Venusaur shrugs off virtually any hit Tangela can throw at it. Venomoth likewise takes very little damage from Tangela and can threaten paralysis or possibly 5HKO with Psychic. Yet again, Pinsir is unafraid of Tangela’s moves and can pivot out with Bind, set up with Swords Dance, or 3HKO it outright with Slash. Fire-types, while exceedingly uncommon, will check Tangela and claim 2HKOs or OHKOs with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves: Outside of Articuno and Dragonite, Tangela can beat most users of Ice-type moves with status or Mega Drain. However, every major user of Blizzard or Ice Beam aside from Omastar is faster than Tangela and thus can pressure it, especially if it has taken a few hits or hasn't used Growth yet. So long as these Pokemon aren't paralyzed, they are capable of revenge killing Tangela or even winning one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel: While Tentacruel would prefer not to risk getting paralyzed, it is more than capable of handling Tangela. Like Dragonite, Tentacruel can easily whittle Tangela down with Wrap and finish it off with a powerful Blizzard.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set allows Tangela to function as a pivot. Sleep Powder and Stun Spore are more or less essential to any variant of Tangela. These two moves give it a significant amount of utility, allowing it to punish switch ins and enable its teammates to sweep. Even with Bind, Tangela is largely outclassed by other prominent Dugtrio checks like Dragonite and Gyarados if it chooses not to run both status moves. Bind functions just like Wrap, albeit with slightly lower accuracy, dealing chip damage and generating safe switches. Due to Tangela's low speed, Bind is most useful against paralyzed targets, though Tangela can usually afford to take a hit before using Bind if it must. Body Slam is very weak from Tangela, but it hits most targets neutrally and threatens paralysis. Mega Drain is similarly weak, but can hit a few targets for super effective damage and get Tangela a little health back in the process. Omastar and Golem are particularly fearful of Mega Drain, which is likely to 2HKO both. Rest serves to make Tangela a more complete wall but makes it even less offensively threatening. Due to Tangela having essentially no offensive presence with Rest, it may be worth running Body Slam or Mega Drain over Bind.</p> "

Growth slowly boosts both Tangela's offensive and defensive prowess. While some Pokemon like Dragonite and Haunter are still not fazed by Tangela’s offenses, this set can bully some defensive Pokemon. Examples include Hypno and Vaporeon, especially if they have been paralyzed; unless they can land a critical hit, Tangela is relatively free to boost with Growth while both dealing damage and regaining health with Mega Drain. The threat of Stun Spore crippling a teammate pressures these Pokemon from switching out. Sleep Powder is always a useful move and allows Tangela to accomplish something even when it can’t quite get going with Growth. Moreover, after successfully using Sleep Powder, Tangela can use Stun Spore to potentially punish a switch-in looking to keep Tangela from setting up with Growth.</p> "}

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Kangaskhan is one of the strongest Normal-type attackers in RBY UU, featuring a wide arsenal of attacking options that help it excel as the tier's most terrifying wallbreaker. Fitting on many offensive teams, it can blow past any Pokemon with Hyper Beam from around 60% HP. It has great coverage too: even the dreaded Articuno, which it outspeeds, is 2HKOed by Rock Slide. The damage that Kangaskhan dishes out is enough to knock many Pokemon into KO range for revenge killers like Dugtrio—if it doesn't just KO them outright—making defensive threats like Vaporeon and Hypno very wary. It is an extremely difficult Pokemon to switch into, arguably having no counters. Not only that, Kangaskhan has incredible physical bulk, allowing it to take minimal damage from Wrap and serve as a minor check to Dugtrio. Kangaskhan is quite customizable for teams as well, possessing interesting options such as Counter.</p> <p>Despite these incredible positives, Kangaskhan isn't an automatic addition to teams. Its special bulk is simply horrific, leaving it at least possibly 2HKOed by many of the strong special attacks thrown around in the tier, such as Articuno's Blizzard and Tentacruel's Surf. Worse still, it falls short in Speed, being slower than tier-king Tentacruel; factoring in its special fragility, this leaves it easily revenge killed. These factors make Kangaskhan sweeping on its own quite rare, so it will often be reserved to exploiting slower, sleeping, or paralyzed Pokemon.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute is notable, as Kangaskhan's 103 HP Substitutes can tank Night Shade from Haunter, as well as Seismic Toss from Hypno and Kadabra, while easing prediction. However, they will normally default to other moves, such as Thunder Wave or Hypnosis, making the option largely moot. Surf allows Kangaskhan to 2HKO Golem and 3HKO Aerodactyl but has no utility otherwise. Kangaskhan can amp up its damage output with Double-Edge to 3HKO Hypno—or even Mega Kick to 3HKO Vaporeon—but whatever move gets replaced will often be sorely missed; replacing Body Slam makes Kangaskhan far more reliant on paralysis support, and eschewing coverage is generally not advised.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Paralysis: Paralysis is the main obstacle to Kangaskhan's success, as it aims to take advantage of slower Pokemon like Vaporeon, as well as paralyzed Pokemon, and tear them down. Paralysis not only makes such interactions impossible but also exposes Kangaskhan's awful special bulk. Pokemon like Articuno, Gyarados, Omastar, Vaporeon, and Venusaur blow paralyzed Kangaskhan away with their strong STAB moves. As such, paralysis inducers such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, and Hypno are to be avoided unless Kangaskhan is in a position where it can KO them first. There will be many times where Kangaskhan will KO something mid-game and subsequently be forced out by one of these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel: Tentacruel outspeeds Kangaskhan and has an 82% chance to 2HKO it with Surf. Furthermore, Tentacruel is capable of chipping Kangaskhan into 2HKO range with just one Wrap use, which is what makes the Speed factor so dangerous; while Kangaskhan is absolutely capable of using Earthquake to 2HKO Tentacruel, it cannot do so quickly enough without Tentacruel being paralyzed first or happening to miss Wrap. Even then, Tentacruel may simply go for the Surf 2HKO, as the odds aren't terrible with even a little chip damage. It should be noted that Kangaskhan's Hyper Beam deals more damage than Earthquake, and can KO Tentacruel from 56.4% or less.</p> <p><strong>Tangela</strong>: Tangela isn't afraid of switching into Kangaskhan, not even fearing a critical hit Hyper Beam. Not only does it shrug off these generally nuclear blows, but it can also threaten with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore in return, both of which put an end to Kangaskhan's rampage. Furthermore, if Kangaskhan has been put to sleep, Tangela sets up Growth with impunity, making its Mega Drain noticeably more threatening. Finally, with Bind, Tangela can exploit paralyzed Kangaskhan relatively well, chipping it into KO range and pivoting to its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: If Kangaskhan lacks Rock Slide, Articuno is a very deadly threat to its success. Even Ice Beam from Articuno can 2HKO it, and Blizzard makes it impossible to switch Kangaskhan into anything later. If Kangaskhan does have Rock Slide, Articuno is threatened with a 2HKO, though Kangaskhan will be damaged heavily by Blizzard in the process. Without Rock Slide, Kangaskhan can only win with a critical hit Body Slam followed up by Hyper Beam. If Articuno has set up Agility and hasn't been damaged, even Rock Slide Kangaskhan cannot win without getting extremely lucky.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite can easily set up Agility if Kangaskhan lacks Toxic, then proceed to spam Wrap, dealing gigantic damage to Kangaskhan's team. Blizzard doesn't really help, as it's only a 2HKO, and one turn is all Dragonite needs. Since Kangaskhan is faster by default, it is in a good position to stop it with Toxic. Even if Dragonite has taken damage from Blizzard or been poisoned, though, it can still paralyze Kangaskhan with Thunder Wave or 3HKO with Blizzard anyway, which keeps the matchup generally unfavorable. So long as Dragonite isn't poisoned, the threat of a sweep exists.</p> <p><strong>Counter Users</strong>: Kangaskhan's wallbreaking prowess comes back to bite it with Counter's existence. There will be many points where a Kangaskhan user has to check for Counter by using Earthquake to force it to fail. Pokemon like opposing Kangaskhan, Hypno, and Poliwrath are occasionally seen using the move. Should Kangaskhan trigger Counter, it will take significant damage. There is also the risk of a Pokemon switching in on Hyper Beam and countering the damage the next turn, which may deal fatal damage.</p> <p><strong>Aerodactyl: Aerodactyl is the only Pokemon in the game to resist the combination of Normal- and Ground-type coverage; if Kangaskhan's fourth move doesn't cover it, it becomes a serviceable check. Aerodactyl can use Fire Blast to attempt to burn Kangaskhan in this situation, which is a death sentence if it works. The damage isn't small either; it's a guaranteed 4HKO. However, if Kangaskhan does cover Aerodactyl with Blizzard or Rock Slide, it's generally fine. The risk of Body Slam paralysis is very large for Aerodactyl, which makes it very risky to check Kangaskhan with it.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>The combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam will KO Electabuzz, Persian, and Dugtrio. Furthermore, Hyper Beam alone will OHKO Kadabra, and it has a minute chance to OHKO Dugtrio. Body Slam is crucial for Kangaskhan's success outside of damage, as paralyzing a switch-in will often lead to Kangaskhan beating it outright. Earthquake covers Haunter and Omastar, which are 2HKOed and 3HKOed. It further covers Electric-types like Electabuzz and Raichu as well, which are also 2HKOed. Lastly, Earthquake makes it much easier for Kangaskhan to scout for Counter users like opposing Kangaskhan and Poliwrath, which can be the difference between winning or losing the game.</p> <p>Kangaskhan's fourth move is largely dependent on its team and what threats the player wants it to cover. No option is truly better than the other. Rock Slide will 3HKO Gyarados and Aerodactyl as well as 2HKO Articuno, the latter of which otherwise wins consistently due to its nuclear Blizzard. Counter enables Kangaskhan to use its high HP to check Normal-type attackers, heavily deterring the use of moves like Body Slam, Hyper Beam, and Slash. It also gives Kangaskhan some extra utility, as switching into Hyper Beam and countering during the recharge can be a very strong tactic. Blizzard acts as coverage for Dragonite, 2HKOing it despite Kangaskhan's poor Special, but Dragonite only needing one free turn to set up Agility and start using Wrap makes this less effective in practice. Blizzard also 3HKOes Aerodactyl, Tangela, and Golem, the latter of which takes more damage than it would from Earthquake. Lastly, Toxic is strictly used to put down Dragonite, preventing it from performing an Agility + Wrap sweep.</p> <p>Kangaskhan is a wallbreaker at heart and should mostly be kept to this role. Kangaskhan is one of the best ways to punish Rest in the tier, and taking advantage of this is often key to its success: it's capable of 3HKOing even Hypno with two Body Slam uses followed up by Hyper Beam. Alternatively, Body Slam can 3HKO it a third of the time anyway. Similarly, a paralyzed Kadabra attempting to use Recover provides Kangaskhan with the perfect opportunity to switch in for free and threaten to OHKO it with Hyper Beam. Switching in on Seismic Toss against paralyzed Hypno or Kadabra is also valid, as they're forced to take a heavy hit from Kangaskhan. Kangaskhan is excellent at punishing greedy setup as well, switching in on Pokemon like Dodrio as they use Agility to completely reverse the game's momentum. It can also punish players looking to use Hyper Beam to finish Pokemon off early; Kangaskhan's amazing physical bulk allows it to switch in and punish the recharge with massive damage, even if it lacks Counter. It's good to switch Kangaskhan in after having a partner use Rest too, as players attempting to exploit the Rest will often switch in Pokemon like Persian and Dugtrio, which Kangaskhan excels against. The damage Kangaskhan can deal to a team is immense, so determining when it's appropriate to glean value from it early- to mid-game while avoiding paralysis is an important fundamental for players to learn.</p> <p>Kangaskhan appreciates paralysis support, as well as a reliable sleeper, though neither of these is necessarily required. Consequently, paralysis inducers such as Hypno, Dragonite, Kadabra, and Electabuzz are good partners. Kangaskhan pairs well with other sweepers—particularly those that are stonewalled by a particular Pokemon, including Articuno, Dugtrio, Dodrio, and Persian. Kangaskhan is very capable of overwhelming Pokemon like Haunter, Omastar, and Vaporeon, which typically stand in the way of at least one of these examples. Always remember to fine-tune teams in response to Kangaskhan's fourth move; for example, pairing Counter Kangaskhan with users of Explosion, such as Golem and Haunter, lets you smash a KOed Pokemon's replacement by countering your own Explosion. Haunter particularly pairs well, as it and Kangaskhan together can minimize Wrap's damage to a team by PP stalling it. Haunter also provides the aforementioned sleep support to shut down a potential check, such as Hypno or Kadabra. It can also lure in Pokemon that really don't want to fight Kangaskhan, like Dugtrio. Tangela is a suitable partner for its ease of spreading paralysis, good Dugtrio matchup, and amazing bulk allowing Kangaskhan to be significantly more aggressive. This role compression often gives space for more powerful Kangaskhan partners, such as Articuno and Dugtrio. Venusaur can act similarly to Tangela while further appreciating Kangaskhan's presence, as double switching to Kangaskhan punishes its usual Psychic-type switch-ins hard.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Kangaskhan is often labelled as a \"second Tauros\", and while Tauros is usually a better Normal-type attacker, Kangaskhan is not unusable and this label belies how differently it can act in practice. Kangaskhan is much more expendable during a game, fulfilling tasks that are normally too risky for the king of RBY OU. When compared with Tauros, Kangaskhan has some unique moves that make it more effective for this role as well, although they can be difficult to fit onto a set. For instance, Counter helps it oppose Normal-type attackers, and Mega Kick 2HKOes Chansey. Furthermore, Kangaskhan has formidable defensive bulk, which makes it more effective at switching into Body Slam, which cannot paralyze it.</p> <p>However, Kangakhan's hefty Normal-type competition does make it redundant on most teams. It has awful Special, completely failing to take strong neutral hits from Pokemon like Alakazam, Starmie, and Zapdos. Consequently, it's very challenging to switch Kangaskhan in against a lot of the tier, as one wrong move can mean significant damage; it often requires a double switch. Worse still, its Speed is just below what would be desirable to sweep, which makes it very reliant on extensive paralysis support to face these strong, fast special attackers. Overall, while Kangaskhan is not a replacement for Tauros by any stretch of the imagination, it retains a small niche when used alongside it, forming a strong wallbreaking core.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Kangaskhan's fourth moveslot is the most flexible, and it has a movepool to make use of it. Substitute is an interesting option to relieve prediction because Kangaskhan's HP gives it 103 HP Substitutes, just like Rhydon. This makes Kangaskhan a difficult adversary for Chansey, forcing it to use Seismic Toss twice to break its Substitute. However, Kangaskhan is vulnerable to paralysis throughout these interactions due to Substitute not blocking status in RBY, so it should only be attempted if Chansey is already paralyzed as well. Mega Kick is a valid option for 2HKOing Chansey, Starmie, and Tauros, but it can be difficult to fit into a set, and a miss often leads to Kangaskhan's demise. Rock Slide is another tempting option, allowing Kangaskhan to 2HKO Articuno and Jynx as well as 3HKO Zapdos 47.1% of the time, but it is very matchup-reliant. Thunderbolt is another valid option strictly for beating Cloyster, with two hits putting it in KO range for Hyper Beam. Alternatively, Thunder can 2HKO it after Body Slam.</p> <p>Kangaskhan is capable of using Counter to check Snorlax and Tauros, making them liable to KO themselves if they use Body Slam. Counter also lets Kangaskhan switch in on Hyper Beam, take it very well, and KO the user while it recharges. However, Kangaskhan's exploitable Special makes it deceptively difficult to find situations where Counter can be used. For instance, Kangaskhan is one of the few Pokemon where it's optimal for Tauros to use Blizzard instead of Body Slam before using Hyper Beam. Kangaskhan even takes relatively high damage from Ice Beam Snorlax. With the two most relevant targets for Kangaskhan's Counter being fully capable of scouting for it, it requires patience to pull off.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Strong Special Attacks: The main reason Kangaskhan doesn't see much high-level usage is because of how awful its Special is. Many Pokemon in RBY OU, including Cloyster, Exeggutor, Starmie, Alakazam, and more, will 2HKO it with their STAB moves. However, few of these Pokemon appreciate switching into Body Slam, as getting paralyzed or critically hit could let Kangaskhan subsequently blast them away with Hyper Beam. Bulkier special attackers like Slowbro and Lapras don't mind Hyper Beam much, though, and can often muscle past Kangaskhan with their STAB moves. Zapdos deserves a special mention for being immune to Earthquake and threatening a 2HKO with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: While Kangaskhan loves facing paralyzed Pokemon, this also means it wants to avoid paralysis itself. Ergo, Kangaskhan will often find itself being forced out by paralysis inducers like Jolteon, Zapdos, Alakazam, and Chansey, at least if it can't KO them first. If Kangaskhan is paralyzed, it becomes significantly more vulnerable to 2HKOs from special attackers like Exeggutor and Lapras. Ideally, Kangaskhan should only get paralyzed if it's a do-or-die situation.</p> <p><strong>Tauros Checks: Due to the dominance of Tauros in RBY OU, the tier is already well-equipped for dealing with Kangaskhan. Cloyster has amazing physical bulk, which makes it difficult for Kangaskhan to break past. Even Thunder is only a 3HKO, while Cloyster has an 84.7% chance to 2HKO in return with Blizzard and can recover the damage with Rest. However, Cloyster dislikes switching into Body Slam due to the potential paralysis making it difficult for it to utilize Clamp later on. To Kangaskhan's credit, it's capable of breaking past Cloyster with Thunderbolt or Thunder, although this isn't reliable. Slowbro possesses the physical bulk to trade blows with Kangaskhan, effortlessly paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and get Amnesia boosts on it. However, a Hyper Beam from Kangaskhan will KO it from 44.2% on a maximum damage roll, so it can be a high-variance matchup. Reflect Snorlax is another thorn in Kangaskhan's side, shrugging off anything thrown at it and forcing Kangaskhan out. Kangaskhan can try to use Counter on Body Slam, but this is somewhat predictable. Exeggutor can stomach most attacks from Kangaskhan and 2HKO with Psychic in return. Finally, Starmie is faster than Kangaskhan, can paralyze it, and 2HKOes with its special move of choice.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Body Slam is Kangaskhan's main STAB move, spreading paralysis and ensuring that nothing can switch in for free. A STAB Hyper Beam from Kangaskhan should never be underestimated, KOing most Pokemon from around 65%, including Chansey and Jolteon. Plus, it can KO Alakazam if it's taken minimal chip damage. Earthquake 2HKOes Gengar and Jolteon, but it also helps with scouting for Counter users like Chansey and Snorlax. Surf prevents Rhydon from walling Kangaskhan, 2HKOing it. It should be noted that Kangaskhan takes middling damage from Rhydon's Body Slam and can't be paralyzed by it, making it a very valuable point of entry.</p> <p>Despite Kangaskhan's \"second Tauros\" title, it should not be forgotten that it is both a mid-game utility attacker—think Snorlax—and a capable revenge killer, particularly against paralyzed teams. Once Kangaskhan has safely entered the field, it's challenging to switch into due to its coverage and the threat of paralysis from Body Slam, so scouting with the latter should be its main aim. Kangaskhan is very capable of scouting for Counter users thanks to its coverage, so it's good to be patient and settle for Earthquake against Pokemon that carry it, such as Chansey. Remember that Kangaskhan is extremely specially frail, so it should ideally only fight special attackers if they are paralyzed. Even then, it will rely heavily on being eased in through double switches, sleeping Pokemon, and Explosions.</p> "

Furthermore, Dugtrio cannot KO Seaking with a critical hit, meaning Seaking can set up on it without fear, unlike Articuno.

However, BubbleBeam is weaker than Blizzard, and it cannot KO Dugtrio after its Substitute breaks. Kangaskhan and Persian also go from a potential 3HKO to a 4HKO. Without Blizzard, Seaking's bad coverage becomes even worse and it struggles to damage Flying- and Grass-type Pokemon. Surf is Seaking's strongest special attack thanks to STAB and can be used instead of Blizzard or Hyper Beam. Surf always KOes Dugtrio after Substitute and always 3HKOes Kangaskhan and Persian, whereas Blizzard just has a chance to do both. Surf is also Seaking's best chance at beating Omastar by having a good chance to 4HKO. However, Blizzard's coverage and chance to freeze far outweigh Surf's benefits. Meanwhile, Hyper Beam is generally Seaking's strongest attack and Seaking has a much harder time sweeping without it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Users: Thunderbolt 2HKOes or 3HKOes Seaking, making its users very dangerous. Haunter is the best choice to check Seaking, since it is immune to Double-Edge and Hyper Beam, and Blizzard only 4HKOes.

However, Haunter should avoid switching into Blizzard, which can freeze, and a high damage critical hit can be enough for Seaking to KO Haunter first if it has already set up. Gyarados is another great choice. Seaking's Double-Edge only 4HKOes Gyarados, and the recoil damage guarantees that Gyarados's Thunderbolt will 2HKO. Seaking's only hope to KO a healthy Gyarados is to land critical hit Double-Edge followed by critical hit Hyper Beam, or to freeze with Blizzard. Electabuzz and Raichu 2HKO Seaking and have Thunder Wave to force Seaking to use Agility again. Raichu can also use Agility to outspeed Seaking. Electabuzz and Raichu do have to be careful about switching into a Seaking that has already set up, as critical hit Double-Edge followed by Hyper Beam KOes them.</p> <p><strong>Rest Users: Bulky Rest users can stop Seaking from sweeping, constantly healing until Seaking KOes itself from Double-Edge's recoil damage. This situation is also known as a Rest loop. Omastar is the best choice, as Double-Edge, Blizzard, and Hyper Beam barely damage it, giving it several chances to paralyze Seaking with Body Slam before needing to use Rest. However, Omastar is afraid of Blizzard's freeze, and it needs to be wary of Surf Seaking, which can 4HKO Omastar to prevent safe Rest looping. Hypno and Vaporeon can also safely Rest loop. Seaking needs two critical hits to 3HKO them, and it takes an average of 20% recoil damage every Rest cycle. In addition, Hypno can paralyze Seaking with Thunder Wave before it needs to use Rest and weaken or even KO Seaking with Psychic. Tentacruel can be 3HKOed by Seaking's Double-Edge if one attack is a critical hit, but Seaking has a relatively low critical hit rate, so Tentacruel can sometimes survive Rest looping it.</p> <p><strong>Kangaskhan and Persian: Kangaskhan and Persian 3HKO Seaking and are not likely to get 3HKOed back. Therefore, they can usually KO Seaking first if they switch into Seaking as it uses Agility or to revenge kill. Kangaskhan is the better choice because Body Slam can paralyze Seaking, and a critical hit Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam will 2HKO. Persian's Slash and Hyper Beam can combine to 2HKO, although both moves need a high damage roll, and Thunderbolt 3HKOes while having a small chance to paralyze. However, a +2 Seaking with Surf can 3HKO them first.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set is Seaking's best chance at sweeping. Double-Edge does the most damage on average and is unresisted by most of the metagame. It allows Seaking to take on Tentacruel, which is almost always 3HKOed if a critical hit occurs. Therefore, Tentacruel cannot use Rest over and over again against Seaking as reliably as it can against Articuno, which is Seaking's biggest niche. Blizzard is used to 2HKO Dugtrio, Dragonite, and Dodrio as well as 3HKO Tangela. Hyper Beam KOes foes from higher health than Double-Edge. Notably, Double-Edge followed by Hyper Beam can KO Kadabra from full health, while critical hit Double-Edge and a subsequent Hyper Beam can KO Electabuzz and Raichu. Agility mitigates Seaking's terrible Speed and bypasses paralysis's Speed drop so Seaking can sweep even when paralyzed.</p> <p>It is nearly impossible for Seaking to sweep or beat Tentacruel without a Speed boost, so Seaking needs to find the opportunity to set up. The simplest way is to switch Seaking in against a sleeping Pokemon. The ideal scenario would be to weaken Tentacruel and switch Seaking in as it uses Rest. Seaking can then set up and potentially 3HKO Tentacruel before it can attack. However, it can be difficult to predict when Tentacruel will use Rest, especially if the opponent knows you have a Seaking. Predicting wrong means a huge loss of momentum, as Seaking is forced to switch it out, making this strategy risky. Fortunately, Seaking can set up against any sleeping Pokemon. Therefore, Hypno with Hypnosis, Tangela, and Haunter pair well with Seaking. Putting a Pokemon to sleep can last up to seven turns, so this is Seaking's safest option. Another strategy is to switch Seaking in against a slower or paralyzed Pokemon that is in KO range, pressuring the opponent to switch out. Seaking can set up instead of going for the KO, but be wary that your opponent may predict the Agility or be willing to sacrifice their Pokemon and go for an attack instead. One common situation like this is switching Seaking in against a paralyzed Kadabra that was hit by Seismic Toss. In this case, the opponent must decide if staying in to use Thunder Wave is worth the risk of predicting wrong and being KOed by Hyper Beam. Paying attention to a foe's HP and knowing when Seaking can KO is vital to its success.</p> "

  "Starmie": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Starmie is one of the most common Pokemon in RBY OU thanks to its Psychic typing and access to Recover and Thunder Wave. Starmie's physical bulk allows it to be a defensive check to virtually every Pokemon lacking an Electric-type attack and take two hits from almost any physical attacker. Additionally, its access to many special attacks such as Blizzard, Psychic, and Thunderbolt turns it into an offensive threat versus anything without instant recovery. Although Starmie naturally outspeeds many common Pokemon, most notably Tauros, oftentimes a paralyzed Starmie functions well in its defensive role due to its ability to block sleep-inducing moves from almost anything, while the ability to paralyze any non-Ground-type Pokemon via Thunder Wave makes it difficult to pressure offensively even then. Among the Recover and Soft-Boiled users in OU, Starmie also possesses a special defensive utility, as it's the only one of them to not be forced out immediately by Snorlax when paralyzed and is able to fight back against it offensively as well when running a STAB move. Those traits make Starmie usable in pretty much any state of the game, turning it into a very flexible Pokemon and easy addition to most RBY OU teams.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ice Beam is an option over Blizzard for the increased PP if Starmie tries to fish for freezes on opposing Alakazam or Chansey lacking Thunderbolt. Hyper Beam is an option to surprise weakened Chansey or Alakazam, but Starmie loses a lot of potential if you drop a move for it. Hydro Pump is an option on a late-game Starmie, as it can 2HKO Tauros and generally do decent damage to anything that does not resist it, especially with a critical hit. If you are dedicated to using Starmie's coverage for a sweeping attempt, Hydro Pump can be used over Thunder Wave to form a strong combination of STAB power and coverage alongside Blizzard and Thunderbolt. Starmie also has access to Reflect and the rare Light Screen. However, it will struggle to fit those moves onto its moveset most of the time.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey is the number one counter to Starmie, as Starmie realistically cannot beat it with any of its movesets, especially when Chansey is paralyzed. In return, Chansey beats Starmie by paralyzing it and beating it down with Thunderbolt, which Starmie will almost certainly fail to outstall with Recover due to full paralysis and critical hit chance. Alternatively, a Chansey lacking Thunderbolt can attempt to freeze an unparalyzed Starmie, as it runs little risk of losing by doing that. However, in order for Chansey to reliably beat a paralyzed Starmie, it needs to run Thunderbolt, since Seismic Toss's PP does not surpass Recover's massive 32 PP, meaning Starmie can outstall variants without Thunderbolt. It's also worth noting that an unparalyzed Chansey runs the risk of getting frozen by Starmie's Ice-type attacks, especially if it cannot threaten with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam</strong>: Alakazam has little to fear from Starmie as well. Although it does not possess any super effective move to hit Starmie with, its higher Speed and Special mean Alakazam can trade paralysis against Starmie and proceed to damage it with Seismic Toss or go for Special drops with its own, vastly stronger Psychic. The best Starmie can do is try to freeze an unparalyzed Alakazam or paralyze it and go for Special drops of its own in order to gain the Speed advantage and make Blizzard do more damage. Recover's massive PP leaves Starmie outstalled relatively quickly with that approach, though, since Alakazam can switch out to something like Chansey to relieve the Special drops. Additionally, while Surf can help Starmie in the Alakazam matchup, it usually still is not enough to beat it, since it only 4HKOes. The possibility of critical hits combined with multiple full paralysis turns on Alakazam, however, does give Starmie a fighting chance.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Even though Starmie is relatively bulky for a Pokemon with instant recovery, it still takes a good chunk from Snorlax's Body Slam. Alongside Starmie's relative trouble to deal great damage to Snorlax plus Snorlax frequently running Rest to heal damage and sometimes carrying Hyper Beam, this makes it a solid check to Starmie. If nothing else, Snorlax's Body Slam is another tool to paralyze Starmie, which generally makes it easier to handle. However, Snorlax has to be careful versus Starmie carrying a STAB move, especially Psychic, since one Special drop means it can no longer reliably Rest stall even a paralyzed Starmie. Another tool Snorlax has to dispose of Starmie is Amnesia. Since Amnesia Snorlax frequently only carries Blizzard and Body Slam as attacking moves, it still does not reliably beat Starmie, but outspeeding Starmie thanks to the additional Speed drop caused by using Amnesia when both are paralyzed surely helps break it with Body Slam. However, Amnesia does not protect Snorlax from Starmie's high critical hit chance, meaning Starmie can even break through Amnesia Snorlax with two consecutive Psychic critical hits or a potential freeze from an Ice-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Zapdos</strong>: Starmie struggles to stay in against Electric-type STAB moves from Jolteon and Zapdos or trade a Thunder Wave with them, since it cannot attempt to Recover off the damage they inflict piece by piece. Jolteon is definitely the best offensive check to Starmie. It does not like paralysis very much, but since it is one of the rare Pokemon that naturally outspeed Starmie, it can afford to take Starmie on even when paralyzed. Starmie can at best 4HKO Jolteon with Psychic, while Jolteon outspeeds and 2HKOes it. Zapdos does not fare as brilliantly against Starmie as Jolteon does due to being weak to Blizzard and not naturally outspeeding it, but it still does beat Starmie one-on-one, though it greatly appreciates it being paralyzed beforehand. Note that both Zapdos and Jolteon have a high critical hit rate thanks to their high Speed. One critical hit Thunderbolt from them will easily OHKO Starmie.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Attacks</strong>: Razor Leaf from Victreebel does upwards of 73% to Starmie, meaning that Victreebel does not need to hit many Wraps to put a paralyzed Starmie in range of being KOed by Razor Leaf. If Sleep Clause is already active, Starmie absolutely needs to be paralyzed for Victreebel to beat it, though, since Starmie 2HKOes Victreebel with either Psychic or Blizzard. Mega Drain on Exeggutor is another option to pressure paralyzed Starmie trying to block Sleep Powder, since it 3HKOes Starmie and 2HKOes it after a Special drop from Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Attacks: Other non-STAB Electric-type attacks coming from the likes of Gengar, Lapras, and opposing Starmie will put enormous pressure on Starmie, potentially taking it down with a single untimely full paralysis or critical hit.</p> ",

          "name": "Special Attacker",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Recover and Thunder Wave alongside Starmie's incredible Speed turn Starmie into a very sturdy Pokemon that possesses the ability to paralyze the foe and outspeed it after, even when paralyzed itself, and proceed to recover its health, since most attacks do not deal 50% to it. This makes Starmie tough to break and is why this move combination allows Starmie, despite its high Speed, to take paralysis even early on in the game and avoid being crippled by it as much as most other Pokemon. In fact, a paralyzed Starmie is very good at blocking sleep-inducing moves from common sleepers like Exeggutor and Sing Chansey lacking Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Starmie's traits do not end at its defensive role, however. In its last two moveslots, Starmie is able to run a variety of powerful special attacks, which can be chosen to hit almost every Pokemon in the tier except Chansey super effectively or at least decently hard. In that context it is worth noting that, due to its high Speed, Starmie has a very high chance of 22.46% to score a critical hit, which frequently enables Starmie to successfully knock out opposing Pokemon by shooting for critical hits.</p> <p>Blizzard most notably hits Exeggutor, Zapdos, and Rhydon, as well as Victreebel and Dragonite. It is chosen over Ice Beam due to having more power while only being 10% less accurate. In addition to the coverage Blizzard provides, another reason to use it lies in its chance to score a freeze on opposing Pokemon such as Chansey and Alakazam or just about any Pokemon if you're desperate. Moves that typically go alongside Blizzard are Psychic and Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Psychic is Starmie's best option to hit Pokemon like Gengar and the Normal-types, thanks to gaining STAB. This is especially important against Snorlax, as a Starmie without STAB moves struggles quite a bit to really hurt it. Another important feature of Psychic is the chance to score Special drops, which can help force switches and thus spread paralysis on the opposing team. This is especially noteworthy against Chansey, especially those running Reflect, since enough Special drops can force it out even when it has already set up a Reflect, which Starmie will otherwise fail to achieve. It can be useful against Alakazam as well, albeit not as consistently, since Alakazam itself can cause Starmie's Special to drop. It is worth mentioning however, that the Blizzard + Psychic set does have some issues with running out of PP rather quickly against opposing Recover users and will not be able to hurt opposing Starmie and Slowbro.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is used to hit opposing Water-types super effectively, including Lapras, Cloyster, and especially opposing Starmie and Slowbro. Being able to threaten other Starmie, especially when they lack Thunderbolt themselves, and beating Slowbro with a critical hit are the biggest selling points for Thunderbolt. Additionally, Thunderbolt is Starmie's only super effective move against Articuno, which itself doesn't really threaten Starmie much but can be annoying to actually knock out. If Thunderbolt is chosen alongside Blizzard, it should be noted that Starmie will struggle to properly threaten Gengar and Snorlax, as the latter can usually Rest stall Starmie, especially if it is paralyzed.</p> <p>Either move can be run alongside Blizzard whether or not Starmie is used as a lead, though as a lead Starmie usually prefers Psychic, as it's usually more useful for early-game purposes; Thunderbolt's coverage alongside Blizzard is appreciated if Starmie is kept for late-game, when opposing Pokemon like Chansey and Snorlax are taken care of otherwise.</p> <p>Psychic and Thunderbolt can be used on the same set if you want to retain the power versus Starmie and Slowbro and the ability to threaten Snorlax, which can be very dangerous for teams that have to rely on either of those Pokemon to fend off Starmie if Chansey is taken out already. Not being able to do much versus Exeggutor, especially when facing it as a lead, plus being unable to hit Rhydon super effectively can be annoying, but neither of them really likes going up against Starmie, since Psychic still does a lot to Rhydon, and Exeggutor usually cannot do much back if it lacks Mega Drain and Starmie cannot be put to sleep anymore. Exeggutor will be paralyzed and receive permanent chip damage in the process of trying to beat Starmie. However, Starmie cannot beat it without giving it multiple chances to fish for Special drops, which might force Starmie out and give Exeggutor the opportunity to put a switch-in to sleep. Additionally, Exeggutor has plenty of time to go for its Explosion, meaning Starmie will likely only trade with Exeggutor. Furthermore, not running Blizzard means you miss out on hitting especially the rare Dragonite super effectively, which then does not have to fear being outright KOed by Starmie and may be able to try its luck with setting up Agility on a weakened team.</p> <p>Another STAB option Starmie has is Surf. However, Water-type moves do not provide much in terms of coverage in the RBY OU metagame, since Fire-types are basically nonexistent and will be unable to beat Starmie anyway, and the ones you might meet such as Moltres are already hit super effectively by Blizzard. Nevertheless, Surf is used to OHKO Rhydon, hitting it by surprise, and it's Starmie's best option against Alakazam and Jynx, giving it a chance to take them down with some luck. It is worth noting that even with Surf, Starmie does not necessarily beat Alakazam; it will force it to Recover more frequently, though, and thus create turns to gain momentum by switching in a physical attacker on a Recover. Like Psychic, Surf also serves as a stronger STAB move against neutral targets such as Snorlax. The lack of a Special drop chance, however, makes it the inferior choice for that purpose. Usually the move to go alongside Surf is Thunderbolt, since Blizzard and Psychic are somewhat redundant with Surf. Since Surf and Thunderbolt both have 24 PP, this Starmie set is best suited for drawn-out games that include PP stalling. It must be noted that with Thunderbolt and Surf, Starmie is walled by Victreebel and Exeggutor, the latter of which has a good chance to force Starmie out due to its high Special and Psychic dropping Starmie's Special, giving Exeggutor opportunities to use Sleep Powder on a switch-in. Additionally, Starmie can no longer hurt opposing Zapdos and Dragonite. Pairing Surf with Blizzard is possible to avoid these issues, but the inability to hit opposing Water-types makes this less desirable.</p> "

Swords Dance strengthens Scyther’s Hyper Beam significantly, but it unfortunately does nothing to benefit Slash, and it is rather difficult to use due to Scyther’s low bulk and weakness to common attacking types including Ice, Electric, and Rock. Scyther lacks a good movepool, so the final move comes down mostly to preference. Agility allows Scyther to outpace every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame and ignore the Speed drop from paralysis. Double-Edge is another move that can be used to take advantage of Swords Dance, and, unlike Hyper Beam, it has near perfect accuracy and never risks a recharge turn. Finally, Toxic gives Scyther the ability to punish Dragonite seeking to set up with Agility and allows it to do something when facing its hard counters, namely Omastar, Golem, and Aerodactyl.</p> <p>Scyther has a few other potential moves for the last slot. Wing Attack is another move that receives the Attack boost from Swords Dance and also grants Scyther the ability to deal damage to Haunter.

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Jynx has a lot of unique features that differentiate it from other Psychic-types such as Alakazam and Starmie. For one, Jynx is the second fastest sleep inducer after the unreliable Gengar, making it a fantastic potential lead option that can incapacitate its checks by making them fall asleep. STAB Blizzard also allows Jynx to win the matchup versus Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Rhydon, and Zapdos. This is all in addition to the standard expectations of a fantastic Psychic-type: access to the powerful STAB Psychic and a high Special stat. Jynx also has its faults, though. Despite its key resistances to Ice- and Psychic-type attacks, Jynx can become easily trampled over by physical attacks, namely from Normal-types such as Tauros and Snorlax, due to its pitiful HP and Defense stats. While its key resistances to Blizzard and Psychic may say otherwise, the main way Jynx provides defensive utility is being the switch-in for predicted sleep-inducing moves. Additionally, nearly all teams run at least two solid checks to Jynx between Chansey and either Starmie or Alakazam, sometimes both. Due to the omnipresence of these checks, their access to Thunder Wave and reliable recovery, and Jynx's susceptibility to paralysis and being worn down over time, Jynx's role is undermined. Jynx can use Rest to restore its health and alleviate its paralysis, burning off sleep turns against Pokemon that can't do much back to it like a paralyzed BoltBeam Starmie. However, doing so opens itself up to a slew of physical attackers such as Tauros and Snorlax that can freely switch into it while it's asleep.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>As previously stated, Jynx's most useless move is Rest, and therefore if one wishes to use one of these other options, it should usually replace Rest. Ice Beam can be used over Blizzard to give Jynx more PP on its Ice-type STAB option. Running Ice Beam can also come in handy in long, drawn-out games to secure a freeze against one of the opponent's Pokemon, although the drop in power is noticeable. A healthy Jynx can use Counter to improve its matchup against Tauros and Snorlax; it is situational, and Jynx has to be at a sizable amount of health for this strategy to be pulled off, although it can also be used after taking damage from a previous turn and the foe switching out. Mimic can be utilized to potentially copy an important utility or coverage move such as Thunder Wave, Soft-Boiled, Recover, or Thunderbolt from one of Jynx's switch-ins such as Chansey or Starmie. However, forfeiting Rest for only a chance to copy a useful coverage move is somewhat risky and still leaves Jynx prone to being paralyzed. Body Slam can be utilized to fish for paralysis against incoming switch-ins like Alakazam, although it is not guaranteed, cannot paralyze Chansey and Snorlax, and is fired off of Jynx's exceedingly below-average Attack stat.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Gengar: While Gengar cannot switch in safely on Jynx whatsoever, it can put Jynx out of commission from the very beginning of the game with Hypnosis. Gengar is also faster than Jynx and can threaten to use Explosion at any time.</p> <p><strong>Starmie, Chansey, and Alakazam</strong>: Starmie, Chansey, and Alakazam can sponge all of Jynx's attacks, paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and restore their health with Soft-Boiled or Recover, acting as some of the most consistent Jynx checks after one of their teammates has been put to sleep. Although they are all susceptible to being frozen with Blizzard, they can whittle Jynx down and force it to use Rest early, limiting the number of chances Jynx has of freezing something.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Tauros and Snorlax can take advantage of Jynx's low HP and Defense and love switching into it after it uses Rest, forcing in a teammate to take the incoming Body Slam. Tauros can also pick up the KO against Jynx with Hyper Beam with a little prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Slowbro, like Starmie, resists Jynx's dual STAB combination of Ice and Psychic and can use Jynx as a setup opportunity to boost with Amnesia and Rest off all the damage it has taken. Lapras is another great example of an offensive check to Jynx despite its lack of reliable recovery due to its 4x resistance to Blizzard and access to Body Slam, although one of its teammates will need to have already been put to sleep. The Jynx user may also decide to trade damage off against Lapras with the end goal of revenge killing it later with another teammate such as Tauros or Alakazam. Getting too much damage off on these Pokemon after Jynx puts something to sleep will often lead to the defensive core of a team crumbling.</p> ",

Blizzard is Jynx's strongest STAB option against certain Psychic-types such as Alakazam and nails Pokemon such as Zapdos and Exeggutor. It can also be used to fish for a potential freeze while scouting which of the opponent's Pokemon has a sleep-inducing move. Psychic rounds out Jynx's coverage, receives STAB, and hits Pokemon such as Gengar and Lapras. It also has the potential to lower a foe's Special stat, which can come in handy to more convincingly win matchups versus special attackers, notably an opposing paralyzed Chansey. Rest provides Jynx with a way of restoring its health and alleviating paralysis. While Jynx doesn't have too many opportunities to use Rest due to its lackluster physical bulk, it can use Rest and burn sleep turns on more passive foes such as Chansey, Alakazam, and Exeggutor lacking Double-Edge. Burning off sleep turns is not always easy, however, as generally speaking most teams pack anywhere from two to three solid checks to Jynx, leaving it liable to exploitation. Jynx is primarily used as a lead due to its above-average Speed tier and access to a fairly accurate sleep-inducing move. However, Jynx can also be used mid-game due to its high Special and fantastic offensive dual STAB combination of Blizzard and Psychic. Note that removing statused Pokemon such as paralyzed Alakazam and Chansey from play allows for Jynx to more freely use Lovely Kiss. The ideal way to utilize Jynx is to put one check to sleep with Lovely Kiss, potentially freeze one of Jynx's remaining checks, and then switch it into potential sleep inducers.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Jynx is a good sleeper in the RBY Ubers metagame, able to immediately pressure opposing teams with the fastest Lovely Kiss in the game. It has very powerful STAB moves in Blizzard and Psychic that give it good coverage to hit Rhydon, Exeggutor, and Zapdos for good damage while pressuring Chansey with Special drops. Jynx has decent Speed and a decent Special stat to back up its Lovely Kiss and strong STAB moves. Being an Ice-type even allows it to pivot into and wall Ice Beam Chansey, Mewtwo, and Slowbro before they set up with Amnesia.</p> <p>However, Jynx has very low Defense, taking heavy damage from most physical attacks. It is slower than several notable Pokemon such as Tauros, Gengar, Zapdos, and Mew. Jynx can also end up as setup bait for Slowbro, Mew, and the dangerous Mewtwo after it has put something to sleep and gotten its freeze, requiring very careful use after landing both statuses. Overall, Jynx finds its role as a strong sleep- and freeze-inducing lead with good matchups against standard Psychic-type leads.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Jynx’s last moveslot has a few options available to it. One option is Ice Beam, which has more PP and therefore more opportunities to freeze than Blizzard alone. Another option is Seismic Toss, which allows Jynx to pressure threats it wouldn't otherwise be able to deal with, like Slowbro and Mewtwo after Amnesia. Body Slam can spread paralysis, but its inconsistency and Jynx's very low Attack stat make this mostly not worth it. Mimic is a gimmick that can give Jynx useful moves such as Recover, Thunder Wave, and Amnesia but is very matchup- and luck-based. Jynx has the option of dropping Psychic to run two other moves and potentially catch something off guard at the cost of not being able to pressure Chansey. An interesting option is running 7 DVs in Defense to OHKO Tauros with Counter after getting hit by Body Slam. However, this significantly hurts Jynx, as it already somewhat lacks longevity, and it can also be useless if the opponent is careful and uses Earthquake.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Slowbro: Slowbro sets up on Jynx, takes minimal damage from Psychic and Blizzard, can heal Seismic Toss damage, and doesn’t care about Body Slam paralysis. However, it does fear a freeze. A Slowbro that is asleep from Rest can be chipped by Seismic Toss into the range of a teammate’s Explosion. Keep in mind that Slowbro with only Ice Beam must be at +6 to even 3HKO Jynx.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: While less common, Starmie always walls Jynx's coverage and heals the little damage it may take. It can also effectively absorb Jynx's Lovely Kiss and use Thunder Wave to cripple Jynx. However, too many Psychic Special drops can force it out.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is a very common lead, is faster than Jynx, and carries Hypnosis. It can also use Explosion to OHKO Jynx, which can put Jynx's team at a big disadvantage if there is no backup sleeper. However, Hypnosis's chance to miss means Gengar should fear possibly being put to sleep itself or taking big damage from Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Pokemon that can use Thunder Wave such as Mew, Jolteon, and Alakazam can severely cripple Jynx, as it has very little use without the option of a fast Lovely Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey takes minimal damage from any of Jynx's moves and forces it out with Seismic Toss. It can also put Jynx to sleep with Sing or paralyze it with Thunder Wave. However, Jynx can freeze Chansey or drop its Special, forcing it out. Also, if Ice Beam is Chansey's only attacking move, Jynx can wall it and use Rest to heal damage.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo sets up on Jynx as long as it does not get frozen. Mewtwo can also use Thunder Wave to cripple Jynx. However, Jynx has a chance to beat Mewtwo if it gets fully paralyzed for a few turns before it sets up, or if Jynx lands some critical hits.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Lead Tauros versus lead Jynx is a gamble for both sides. Tauros is able to fish for Body Slam paralysis, a critical hit Body Slam that OHKOes 66% of the time, or Stomp flinches. On the other hand, if Tauros fails to get any of those, Jynx can try to put it to sleep, use Counter, or use Blizzard for heavy damage. However, Tauros can also use Earthquake on the first turn to avoid Counter and guarantee a KO with Hyper Beam on the next turn. Also, Tauros is able to come in later in the game and finish off a weakened Jynx with little issues.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Lovely Kiss is Jynx's best move, allowing it to likely disable one of the opponent's Pokemon for most of the game. Blizzard and Psychic hit the majority of the tier for solid damage. Psychic also has a chance to lower the foe's Special, helping Jynx deal a little bit more damage with subsequent attacks. Counter allows Jynx to fire off massive damage after taking a Normal-type move, usually Body Slam from Tauros, Snorlax, or Mew. However, it is very prediction reliant, as all three run Earthquake and can use it to avoid damage from Counter. Rest helps Jynx stall Chansey, eliminating an obstacle for your own Mewtwo, as well as increasing Jynx's overall longevity. One must be aware that many physical attackers and setup sweepers can take advantage of a sleeping Jynx, so Rest must be used carefully.</p> <p>Jynx sometimes gets an early-game freeze before it can try to freeze Mewtwo, so Light Screen Chansey is a premier teammate, as it provides one of the tier’s best checks to Mewtwo. Light Screen allows Chansey to avoid the 3HKO from Mewtwo's Psychic and paralyze it with Thunder Wave. Another good option is Flash Chansey to PP stall opposing Mewtwo if Jynx is running Rest. Jynx is great both with and against Explosion. Teammates with Explosion such as Gengar, Mew, and Exeggutor, or Snorlax with Self-Destruct, appreciate Jynx chipping the opposing team into their range. Also, Jynx should be used to take Explosion or as sleep fodder after it has inflicted its status effects to prevent Mewtwo and Slowbro from using it as setup fodder.</p> <p>Teammates that can check Mew are very helpful, as Mew can come in against Jynx and set up for free with Swords Dance, especially if Jynx has used Rest. The best check to Mew is Mew itself; Transform Mew is a very solid counter to opposing Swords Dance Mew, as it can easily turn the opponent's strategy against them. Gengar is another good teammate that completely counters mono-Body Slam Mew. Rhydon and Golem are other good checks to mono-Normal Mew and can support Jynx by absorbing other Normal- and Electric-type attacks, both of which can be problematic for it. Rhydon is stronger and bulkier than Golem and can help pressure the opposing team more immediately. However, both Jynx and Rhydon are somewhat slow for the Ubers metagame, and Amnesia users can use them as setup fodder. Golem, while weaker and frailer than Rhydon, is slightly faster and has Explosion as a one-time nuke, which can take out almost anything on the opposing team and applies immense constant pressure.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Pinsir is the sole viable Bug-type in RBY OU thanks to an amazing Attack stat that can be further boosted by Swords Dance, allowing it to let loose nuclear Hyper Beams while trapping with Bind. A +2 Pinsir is nothing to be trifled with, capable of beating Snorlax outright with Submission and possessing a Hyper Beam that can OHKO the physically frailer Pokemon in the tier, including Jolteon, Chansey, Jynx, Alakazam, and Victreebel. Additionally, Pinsir has the strongest non-STAB Slash in the game, hitting nearly as hard as Persian right out of the gate. This makes it one of the few physical attackers that can contest Reflect users like Snorlax and Chansey, the latter of which it can 2HKO. Pinsir's typing gives it surprising defensive utility as well, resisting Earthquake and not being hit super effectively by Thunderbolt, giving it use over other Swords Dance users like Kingler. Pinsir is by no means slow relative to OU either, outpacing Victreebel and Cloyster, and, with paralysis support, it can absolutely mow down even the faster Pokemon in the tier, acting as a surprisingly strong late-game sweeper.</p> <p>However, like all RBY Bug-types, Pinsir suffers from some severe downsides. While powerful, Pinsir cannot hit Gengar without Seismic Toss, possessing strictly Normal- and Fighting-type attacks in its offensive movepool. Ergo, Gengar can effortlessly switch in and let out a completely uncontested Hypnosis while Pinsir is forced to switch out or pivot out with Bind. Pinsir also suffers from a bit of four moveslot syndrome, demanding Swords Dance and Hyper Beam while having to pick between Slash, Submission, and Bind for its last two slots, all of which can significantly affect its matchups. Worse still, Pinsir is very reliant on its Speed to sweep, as being outsped exposes its noticeably mediocre special bulk, leading to it getting forced out by paralysis inducers such as Alakazam, Starmie, and full HP Chansey. These flaws make Pinsir a rare sight in RBY OU, but a serviceable pick nonetheless.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While a highly contested slot, Pinsir's fourth moveslot is the most flexible. If a team absolutely needs another Pokemon to hit Gengar, Seismic Toss is a suitable option, allowing Pinsir to punish its attempts to switch in. After two strikes, Gengar often becomes much more inclined to Explode, making it a bit more predictable. However, fitting Seismic Toss always brings severe opportunity cost, causing Pinsir to lose out on Submission's fantastic damage against Normal-types or Bind's utility.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Gengar: Pinsir can't even touch Gengar without Seismic Toss, possessing no alternatives to hit it. Worse still, Gengar's Thunderbolt is a guaranteed 3HKO, dealing up to 41.4% per hit, or it can fire off a completely uncontested Hypnosis. However, Bind can immobilize Gengar while allowing Pinsir to bring in a teammate such as Alakazam for free, which does add a degree of risk.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Paralysis rains on Pinsir's parade, exposing its severely lacking special bulk and making it near-incapable of running over the opposing team. There is counterplay if Pinsir's foe is paralyzed as well, though, as Pinsir can attempt to use Swords Dance to reapply the Speed drop and continue whaling on them. Pokemon like Exeggutor and Lapras become much more threatening when Pinsir is paralyzed, utilizing their powerful special attacks to 2HKO it. As a result, Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie will often force Pinsir out by the threat of paralysis alone unless it's in a situation where paralysis doesn't matter. This also makes Body Slam paralysis from Pokemon like Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon particularly annoying, as Pinsir can't often stomach more than two hits from any given Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Pinsir's special bulk of 65/55 is awful; even Jolteon's Thunderbolt and Starmie's Surf have a high chance to 2HKO it. As a result, Pinsir is very frequently forced out by special attackers unless it can KO them first, such as if they're paralyzed or chipped. However, Pinsir does often have the chance to attack them once, which can situationally be all it needs in endgame scenarios.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Foes: Pokemon like Rhydon, Cloyster, and Slowbro put large amounts of pressure on Pinsir—especially if it's paralyzed—while being able to stomach its hefty physical blows. These Pokemon can also strike back with equally devastating attacks; in Rhydon's case, Rock Slide can deal upwards of 80% in a single hit, which can be a KO if Pinsir even tries to respond with Submission.</p> <p><strong>Counter Users: If Pinsir can't KO Chansey outright, Counter Chansey will OHKO Pinsir if it uses any of its offensive attacks bar Bind. This can also apply to more niche Counter users, such as Snorlax, Alakazam, and Kangaskhan. However, if Pinsir has Bind, it has a solid way to counter-play the strategy, immobilizing the Counter users and chipping them into Hyper Beam range.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Swords Dance and Hyper Beam are Pinsir's bread and butter, allowing it to swiftly end games if its team can successfully chip and paralyze the opposing team. It should be noted that Swords Dance reapplies the paralysis Speed drop to paralyzed foes, so if Pinsir itself is paralyzed, it isn't game over just yet. This effect also applies to paralyzed Pokemon attempting to switch in, making doing so extremely risky.</p> <p>Pinsir's last two moveslots largely depend on what its user wants. For the third moveslot, Slash gives Pinsir immediate power and provides a better matchup against Reflect users, while Body Slam lets Pinsir spread its own paralysis, making it more self-sufficient. For the fourth slot, Submission, while unreliable and giving Pinsir significant blowback for its use, is an amazing way to dispatch Cloyster, Chansey, and Snorlax at +2, dealing well over 50% to each of them. In fact, after two boosts, Pinsir can outright OHKO non-Reflect Snorlax. Alternatively, Bind can occupy either the third or fourth moveslot, letting Pinsir pivot into its teammates to gain a better position while also dealing serious chip damage. This works especially well against paralyzed teams, forcing them to switch around to PP stall it while often taking around 7% each time if Pinsir has picked up even a single boost, which rapidly adds up over the course of the move.</p> <p>While this is all well and good on paper, using Pinsir in practice is fairly difficult. It's best to keep it to endgame scenarios, when the opposing team has likely been thoroughly paralyzed. However, it's perfectly fair to switch it in on a Chansey's Soft-Boiled turn or a Snorlax's Rest or Earthquake, both options that Pinsir doesn't really care about. Similarly, Recover turns from paralyzed Alakazam and Starmie are good opportunities for Pinsir to sneak in and force damage on the opposing team; if either of these Pokemon experience full paralysis when attempting to respond, they could absolutely be KOed the following turn. Fellow partial trapping pivots and Explosions are other good switch-in chances. Picking up a boost with Pinsir is also quite difficult, though Pinsir is not against taking a hit to set up if it means winning the game there and then. Punishing a Snorlax Rest with Pinsir is among the best ways to get a boost with impunity, often forcing Snorlax out lest it is KOed from there. Pinsir works best on teams that have multiple paralysis inducers, one of which will likely be the ubiquitous Chansey. Jolteon synergizes very well with Pinsir, appreciating Pinsir's Ground resistance and ability to 2HKO Rhydon with +2 Submission.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Pinsir has a unique place in RBY UU thanks to its access to Bind, decent Speed, and potentially massive damage output by virtue of Slash and Swords Dance. Its Bug typing provides it with a resistance to Earthquake; this makes it work well alongside Tentacruel and Electric-types like Electabuzz and Raichu, especially when checking Dugtrio for them. Pinsir's biggest selling point, however, is its sheer threat level should it boost with Swords Dance, which allows it to flatten paralyzed teams. Few Pokemon can switch into Pinsir's +2 Hyper Beam; some standout calculations include a 41% chance to OHKO Tentacruel and a 2.6% chance to OHKO Hypno. This makes Pinsir a particularly brutal punishment for Pokemon that are often forced to use Rest, such as Vaporeon and Hypno. While not perfect, Pinsir's Speed lets it outpace Dragonite and Hypno, which makes it great at revenge killing them. Further, having a partial trapping move faster than Dragonite can be crucial in many situations, allowing Pinsir to keep Dragonite from setting up with Agility and switch to a counter, such as Tentacruel, for free. Bind allows Pinsir to form a partial trapping core alongside Tentacruel and Dragonite as well, providing teams with significant momentum, especially if the opposing team is stricken with paralysis.</p> <p>As with almost any Bug-type in RBY, though, Pinsir is held back by some severe flaws. Pinsir has no STAB attacks to speak of and is forced to rely only on Normal- and Fighting-type moves. It thus competes with the Normal-type attackers of the metagame—Persian, Dodrio, and Kangaskhan—for a place on teams. Pinsir's Normal and Fighting reliance also makes it completely invalidated by Haunter, which forces it to switch or pivot out with Bind. It also struggles with Rock-types if it lacks Submission, and its weakness to Rock Slide doesn't help there. While Pinsir's Speed helps in some minor ways, it just isn't good enough: Pinsir is outpaced by common threats like Tentacruel, Dodrio and Kadabra, which are very capable of threatening it due to its mediocre typing or low Special. As a result, Pinsir relies heavily on teams that spread paralysis efficiently, making it somewhat dependent on the player's Hypno to function well. These flaws are only worsened by it being debilitated by paralysis and mandating setup, which can be very difficult to accomplish in the Wrap-infested format. Paralysis isn't the only status to give Pinsir trouble either, as Toxic—a substantially common way to deal with Dragonite—puts a firm cap on Pinsir's use of Bind, causing it to take more damage than it would normally deal, which is only made worse by Bind's inherent inconsistency. Overall, Pinsir has some very strong points in its favor, but it's a high-risk pick that necessitates a team built around it as well as a competent player.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Body Slam can allow Pinsir to be more self-sufficient in the paralysis department while denying switches in from faster threats. However, Slash's damage is sorely missed in this case, causing Pinsir to miss out on many potential KOs and become more reliant on Swords Dance. Seismic Toss can be utilized, as it's Pinsir's sole option to hit Haunter, but it does little to help the matchup; switching out or pivoting with Bind is really all Pinsir can do. Toxic can be helpful for dealing with Dragonite, which otherwise uses Pinsir as setup fodder. However, Pinsir doesn't necessarily need Toxic, as it can use Bind to safely bring in a counter, such as Tentacruel.</p> <p>Bind can be cut for moveslot flexibility, but this causes Pinsir to be a severe momentum sink mid-game. Should the opponent reveal Haunter or a Rock-type, Pinsir is forced out and has to have a teammate take a hit for it, which can let the opponent open holes. Switching out with Bind ensures momentum isn't lost, as foes are unable to move, even Haunter. However, with Bind cut, Pinsir becomes more consistent late-game, as it's less reliant on Bind's shaky accuracy.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Haunter: Pinsir can't touch Haunter at all without the largely undesirable Seismic Toss. To make matters worse, Haunter is faster and gets a near-guaranteed 3HKO with Thunderbolt. As such, Pinsir is normally forced to switch out through a manual switch or Bind. It should be noted that Bind still immobilizes Haunter, allowing Pinsir to safely bring in a counter like Dugtrio, so using Bind to catch Haunter switching in is viable counterplay.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: If Pinsir doesn't run Submission, it's forced out by Rock-types. However, if it does, it usually 2HKOes them at +2, albeit with significant recoil damage and questionable reliability. Golem is adept at coming in on Hyper Beam and outright 2HKOes Pinsir with Rock Slide, meaning it wins in this situation even if Pinsir has boosted. Omastar deals up to 72% with Hydro Pump, which can be followed up with Blizzard to dispatch Pinsir. In addition, considering Submission recoil, Omastar can easily 2HKO Pinsir with Surf. Aerodactyl is another particularly solid counter, only facing a near-guaranteed 4HKO from Submission while 2HKOing in return with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Pinsir's special bulk is very poor, so threats like Articuno and Kadabra 2HKO it with their STAB moves. However, these matchups are volatile if Pinsir is at full health. Pinsir Speed ties with Articuno and therefore can potentially win if it's boosted; Slash + Hyper Beam will 2HKO Articuno quite frequently. Against Kadabra, Pinsir can deal up to 91% with Slash alone, and +2 Hyper Beam will always OHKO it unless there's an unfortunate miss. As such, Kadabra is restricted to revenge killing Pinsir, which can be stifled by teammates like Hypno, though Pinsir being forced out isn't necessarily ideal. While they are very rare, Fire-type Pokemon like Moltres greatly threaten Pinsir with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel: Tentacruel is faster than Pinsir, can pivot out of bothersome situations through Wrap, and heals paralysis with Rest. It's very difficult for Pinsir to set up in games due to the existence of Tentacruel's Wrap, constantly delaying it while chipping Pinsir into KO range. On top of this, Tentacruel is near-guaranteed to 2HKO Pinsir with Surf. However, Pinsir is very capable of exploiting paralyzed Tentacruel, possessing a potential OHKO with +2 Hyper Beam. If Pinsir paralyzes Tentacruel with Body Slam on the switch, Tentacruel is liable to outright lose. Overall, though, this matchup is very unfavorable and using Pinsir against a healthy Tentacruel is strongly discouraged.</p> <p><strong>Dodrio</strong>: Dodrio can revenge kill Pinsir with Drill Peck, 2HKOing it. It can't switch in to save its life though, taking massive damage from Slash, which has a small but notable chance to 2HKO; alternatively, Slash + Hyper Beam is a guaranteed 2HKO. Furthermore, if Pinsir has boosted, it can OHKO Dodrio with Hyper Beam 89.7% of the time. Dodrio can't fight Pinsir at all if it's paralyzed.</p> ",

Hyper Beam is Pinsir's claim to fame, KOing Pokemon from around half HP even without setup and becoming an OHKO machine if boosted. Slash gives Pinsir immediate and significant power, but Submission—albeit somewhat inconsistently—allows Pinsir to beat Rock-types that try to switch in on Hyper Beam, as well as deal massive damage to Persian and Kangaskhan. Finally, Bind allows Pinsir to provide its team with momentum while chipping threats into Hyper Beam KO range, which becomes near-effortless against paralyzed teams. When boosted by Swords Dance, Bind can be surprisingly powerful; for example, it can deal up to 10.4% to Hypno per hit, quickly bringing it into KO range.</p> <p>Pinsir can be a fairly unwieldy Pokemon to use, relying on a paralyzed team to sweep reliably. However, it has multiple points of entry, particularly Dugtrio, which it can beat outright, 2HKOing it with Slash and only being 3HKOed by Rock Slide 0.1% of the time. Outside of this, Pinsir can punish paralyzed Pokemon heavily, be it by revenge killing them or switching in on their physical attacks, which is made safer by the potential for full paralysis. Paralysis further benefits Pinsir's Bind, giving it a safety net for its more frequent misses than Wrap. Pinsir is capable of exploiting Pokemon using Rest quite well with Swords Dance, which can potentially mean an outright win depending on the game state. Pinsir fits on teams that appreciate its Ground resistance and physical attacking prowess. This particularly applies to those looking to get the most mileage out of Tentacruel and Electric-types, so long as the team is capable of providing extensive paralysis support in return.</p> "

This makes switching into Tauros a very arduous prospect for most teams, as potential checks like Starmie have to fear a sizable chance of paralysis or critical hit from Body Slam. Other Pokemon with the theoretical physical bulk, such as Snorlax, Cloyster, or Slowbro, can only shrug off Tauros's hits via Rest, leaving them in an exploitable state. Overall, although some special attackers can trade blows advantageously with Tauros, and it has to be very wary of paralysis, its sheer offensive prowess makes it an automatic inclusion on a vast majority of RBY teams.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunderbolt and Thunder can be used to damage Cloyster, which, despite being relatively uncommon, is one of the sturdiest Tauros switch-ins available. Thunder manages to 2HKO it but has to deal with much lower accuracy, while Thunderbolt misses out on that damage range but is generally far more reliable.</p> <p>Stomp has a 30% flinch chance, and while definitely unreliable, it can be used to bring opposing Pokemon into KO range with no damage traded back with some luck. This is an especially appealing option if the enemy Pokemon is already paralyzed, which further increases the chances of it not managing to attack.</p> <p>Double-Edge's 100 Base Power can be used to safely snipe out KOs that Body Slam cannot reach while not having to rely on Hyper Beam; the recoil is a generally unpleasant side effect, but it can be used to your advantage, as whenever a Pokemon faints from recoil the turn ends immediately. This mechanic can occasionally be used to damage an opponent and prevent them from healing back up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Status: Tauros's below average bulk is difficult to exploit because it is usually faster and strong enough to KO the foe before they can strike back. Paralysis and sleep are both very common in the RBY metagame, and they can shut down this element of Tauros's gameplay, making it much easier to deal with.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: While Exeggutor lacks recovery, and therefore cannot repeatedly switch in on Tauros, simply having Exeggutor in the back will often dissuade Tauros players from clicking Hyper Beam, as Exeggutor could switch in, tank the Hyper Beam, and land a Sleep Powder or a Stun Spore on Tauros during the recharge turn, effectively putting it out of commission for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Starmie is the only Pokemon with access to Recover that can survive a Body Slam followed by a Hyper Beam, which makes it an obvious candidate for a reliable switch-in on Tauros throughout the game; however, Body Slam can ruin its day with decent frequency due to the chance of paralysis. Regardless, Starmie outspeeds Tauros and can even threaten it with Thunder Wave, which makes a healthy Starmie one of the best Tauros answers available.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster and Lapras</strong>: These Pokemon possess great bulk and access to a powerful Blizzard that is generally enough to scare Tauros away. Lapras's Blizzard is stronger and has a chance to 2HKO, while Cloyster takes Body Slams better and more commonly runs Rest to heal the damage back up. As a side note, Articuno also possesses 2HKO potential via Blizzard, but it's significantly frailer and generally less viable than both Cloyster and Lapras.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro: Slowbro is part of the small list of Pokemon that are guaranteed to survive a critical hit Hyper Beam from full HP, making it an appealing option to switch in on a predicted Hyper Beam in order to guarantee landing a Thunder Wave on the recharge turn. It does not mind a Body Slam either, but it can be hard for it to use Rest and wake up unpunished.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Tauros's much slower and bulkier counterpart is a good asset when trying to answer an opposing Tauros, as its natural bulk will often at least guarantee that some damage gets traded back, and if it carries Self-Destruct, it can somewhat reliably trade one-for-one if your opponent chooses to leave Tauros on the field.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Although mauled by Earthquake, Gengar can switch in on Normal-type attacks from Tauros at no cost and threaten it with Hypnosis. Although the exchange is somewhat likely to end very poorly, between Hypnosis's miss chance and Earthquake's critical chance, the Tauros user is generally expected to keep it away from danger if possible, which means Gengar can somewhat reliably be used to prevent Tauros from making any progress as long as it doesn't get hit with an Earthquake on a predicted switch in. Gengar is also the best check to Tauros without Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Alakazam</strong>: Although they definitely do not want to pick a full one-on-one against Tauros or ever switch in on it, Alakazam and Jolteon deserve a mention as they can outspeed and revenge kill a weakened Tauros, which is a fairly rare quality.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Tauros's combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam makes it an incredibly difficult threat to switch into, as a majority of Pokemon only need to receive minimal chip damage before being unable to tank a Body Slam followed by a Hyper Beam, and some are KOed by this sequence even from full health. Body Slam's paralysis chance on some of the most common Tauros switch-ins such as Starmie and Exeggutor is yet another addition to Tauros's already threatening arsenal. Blizzard is Tauros's best attack to threaten Rhydon and Golem, the two OU-viable Rock-types that would otherwise be able to switch in on its Body Slam, and force them to face the threat of being 2HKOed (or being OHKOed on a critical hit). Earthquake is the preferred move in the last slot, as it gives Tauros a tool to hit Gengar, which otherwise walls it, as well as a way to play around Counter Chansey, although Tauros still risks taking a Thunder Wave in a direct one-on-one situation. Additionally, it can finish off a weakened Rhydon or Golem with greater accuracy than Blizzard. Earthquake also gives Tauros a safe move to hit both Chansey and Rock-types, which elimates the need to predict a switch with Body Slam or Blizzard in certain situations. However, given the generally low usage of Gengar and Counter Chansey, it is reasonable to cut Earthquake in favor of Fire Blast; while this move does not hit any targets for extra damage, it does carry a 30% burn chance that can give Tauros an upper hand in a one-on-one matchup with opposing Tauros.</p> <p>Tauros is such a potent tool to break the opposition down that it is generally preferred to keep it as healthy as possible throughout the game while also trying to get it on the field as often as possible; this is a tricky balance to achieve that often sets apart new players from experienced ones. Great opportunities to switch it in can be found against Pokemon that are asleep, on a predicted switch, or on a recovery move that will leave the opponent's active Pokemon in KO range for Tauros. Quite frequently, Tauros will be able to clean up teams that have appropriately been crippled with status or weakened beforehand thanks to its extremely strong Hyper Beam; this is one of the most common win conditions in RBY, and as such, your game plan should generally account for the possibility of an end-game Tauros sweep. This means you should capitalize on opportunities to set up a Tauros sweep while trying to reduce your opponent's chances to do the same thing. The biggest obstacle in these plans is often the fact that both Tauros are kept as healthy as possible and always able to try a last-resort mirror, even when the rest of the team has fallen apart; this is one of the many reasons for keeping your own Tauros safe.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Gyarados clings to RBY OU relevance thanks to a combination of massively inflated stats, expansive coverage in moves like Thunderbolt and Blizzard, and a unique typing that makes it the only Water-type immune to Ground, letting it switch in on a predicted Earthquake with impunity. That typing lets it synergize with Pokemon like Chansey, Gengar, and Jolteon, which not only appreciate this immunity, but also help patch up its own Thunderbolt weakness. Gyarados's attacking stats are extremely high, allowing it to achieve feats such as 2HKOing Tauros and 3HKOing Snorlax with Hydro Pump, letting it win against them one-on-one. Plus, it's bulky to the point that even a Thunderbolt from Starmie fails to OHKO it without a critical hit. It's not exactly slow relative to RBY OU either, outrunning Pokemon like Cloyster, Dragonite, and Victreebel while threatening them with its coverage. Overall, Gyarados can be seen as a battering ram that blows past paralyzed teams.</p> <p>However, while it may have been a big threat in the early days of the generation, Gyarados fell out of favor due to its typing giving it some horrendous weaknesses. While its Ground immunity looks enticing to switch in on Rhydon, it also takes huge damage from Rock Slide: its bulk isn't as good as it looks. It also gets a quadruple weakness to Thunderbolt and neutrality to Blizzard and Psychic, making it hard for Gyarados to get in against the special attackers of the tier and forcing teams to make up for it. If paralyzed, this gets even worse, as Gyarados's lack of reliable recovery makes it very easy to wear down as is. Even offensively, because of a criminal lack of physical STAB moves, Gyarados struggles to damage specially bulky Pokemon like Chansey and Gengar. Finally, Gyarados has issues distinguishing itself from Lapras outside of its typing and superior Attack, which has the same coverage and higher overall bulk. As a result of these flaws, Gyarados is a very rare sight in RBY OU, often requiring extensive support from a dedicated team to function properly, but it remains a serviceable pick in the hands of an experienced player.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Surf can be used if Hydro Pump's consistency is problematic, but this reduces Gyarados's immediate threat level. Worse still, it's not that much better than Blizzard in practice damage-wise, making it largely redundant. Thunder is a serviceable option to 2HKO Starmie and Slowbro, but its criminally low accuracy and lack of benefit outside of this make it mostly suboptimal.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Gengar: Gengar can switch in on Gyarados and KO it with Thunderbolt if it's taken even a modicum of damage. However, it can't repeatedly switch into Hydro Pump, lest it get 3HKOed in the process.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can effortlessly take Gyarados's special coverage; Reflect sets are also depressing to fight against. Additionally, Chansey's access to Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave makes it very risky for Gyarados to contest unless its moveset has already been successfully scouted. However, Gyarados can KO Chansey with Hyper Beam from 49.3% onwards if Reflect isn't active—even above 75% with Body Slam + Hyper Beam—which makes a paralyzed Chansey very possible to beat.</p> <p><strong>Starmie and Lapras</strong>: While it gets Thunderbolt, Gyarados struggles to deal with Starmie and Lapras due to their Hydro Pump resistance and ability to simply outdamage Gyarados with their own coverage. Starmie is of particular note because of its access to Thunder Wave, which firmly shuts down Gyarados. However, it has to risk Body Slam paralysis when switching in, which can potentially incapacitate it for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type coverage</strong>: Any Pokemon with Thunderbolt is automatically a Gyarados check. Jolteon and Zapdos cleanly OHKO Gyarados with their STAB Thunderbolts. If Tauros and Persian run Thunderbolt, they can 2HKO Gyarados off the bat, the latter of which is arguably more threatening because of its high critical hit rate. However, all of these Pokemon would rather avoid taking direct damage, as they have mediocre bulk; they win one-on-one, but they are not reliable defensive answers by any means.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor: If not running Blizzard, Exeggutor resists both of Gyarados's special coverage options and threatens with massive damage or sleep in return. Even with Blizzard in the equation, a Special drop from Psychic can instantly ruin any chance of Gyarados actually winning. However, Exeggutor doesn't want to take a Blizzard, as it often wants to save its bulk for more pressing matchups, particularly Rhydon and Snorlax.</p> ",

However, it should be remembered that Hydro Pump's inconsistency can and will lead to wasted turns. Additionally, Thunderbolt Tauros can tear Gyarados apart anyway, so it must be scouted for first. Thunderbolt gives Gyarados a fighting chance against all Water-types, most importantly Starmie, Cloyster, Slowbro, and Lapras. However, Blizzard can be used to 3HKO Exeggutor instead, which Gyarados otherwise struggles against. Body Slam allows Gyarados to scout for switch-ins while threatening with paralysis, making use of its great Attack stat in the process; this also prevents Starmie, Alakazam, and Jolteon from switching in safely, and it allows Gyarados to pressure Chansey with significant damage on a critical hit. To top it off, Hyper Beam blows past non-Reflect Chansey and Alakazam, KOing them from 58% and 63.5% onwards, respectively, which Body Slam can set it up for.</p> <p>Gyarados functions as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker that forces the opponent into making predictable decisions. It can be brought in early on a predicted Rest from Snorlax—a common sight in the early-game in RBY—then threaten it with Hydro Pump from there to force damage onto the opposing team. Gyarados's high Special and Water resistance make it one of the best Clamp absorbers in the game too, so it's very capable of switching in on a predicted one from Cloyster. Outside of this though, due to its typing, Gyarados's switch-in opportunities are quite limited, mostly being reserved to generic methods like pivoting with partial trapping, gambling on full paralysis, and Explosion. However, Gyarados's typing makes it well-equipped for double switching against Earthquake, allowing it to ease in Pokemon like Jolteon and Chansey if the situation calls for it.</p> "

While it faces strong competition from other Pokemon with similar coverage, such as Starmie, its combination of power and bulk, as well as access to Sing, gives Lapras a unique set of qualities that give it an important niche in the metagame. Access to STAB Blizzard, as well as Thunderbolt, enables it to hit almost every Pokemon in the game for at least neutral damage, making it quite difficult to switch into. Its Speed is just enough to get by Chansey as well, allowing it to potentially put it to sleep one-on-one. It also has a positive matchup against Tauros and Snorlax, two of the strongest Pokemon in the metagame, which can be crucial in many instances.</p> <p>However, Lapras is bogged down by some flaws. Lapras's typing leaves it with a weakness to Thunderbolt and neutrality to Psychic, which often makes it easy to wear down with Pokemon like Starmie and Alakazam running around. It also struggles mightily against Chansey if it can't put it to sleep, which stonewalls it with its incredible bulk. Regardless, Lapras holds a niche in RBY OU, and it sees success on quite a few teams.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ice Beam is an alternative STAB option to use in place of Blizzard, but the lack of power is really noticeable and generally not worth the extra accuracy and PP. Rest and Reflect can be used in conjunction to give Lapras much appreciated survivability to answer threats such as Tauros more reliably throughout the game, but the set is easy to pressure via powerful special attacks, particularly Psychic- or Electric-type ones, and the lack of offensive pressure makes it a risky and generally undesirable pick.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Lapras struggles immensely in attempting to break through Chansey. It can easily Soft-Boiled away any damage taken and force Lapras out with the threat of Thunder Wave. Lapras may attempt to put it to sleep with Sing, but the move is inaccurate, somewhat predictable, and completely useless against a paralyzed Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos and Jolteon</strong>: While Lapras's Blizzard respectively 2HKOes and 3HKOes these Pokemon, team structures that include Lapras generally leave themselves very vulnerable to Electric-type attacks, which Zapdos and Jolteon can easily exploit and punish with powerful Thunderbolts. It may even be preferable to sacrifice Lapras in a one-on-one scenario just to get some chip damage on Zapdos in particular, but the same cannot be said for Jolteon, which should nearly always have the upper hand against Lapras and only fears a potential Body Slam paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Starmie and Alakazam</strong>: If they are not paralyzed, these two Pokemon can tank any hit Lapras throws at them and Recover off the damage easily while threatening it with Thunder Wave. All Lapras needs to turn the tides on them is paralysis and some correct predictions.</p> <p><strong>Amnesia Snorlax</strong>: Although it takes a while to get going and has to worry about Sing, Snorlax doesn't take much damage from any of Lapras's attacks after one or two Amnesia boosts and can retaliate with Body Slam. Although it is unlikely Amnesia Snorlax would be used as a switch-in, it dominates one-on-one.</p> ",

Thunderbolt allows Lapras to hit Water-types, giving it the ability to muscle through paralyzed Starmie, which would otherwise be a poor matchup. In the third slot, Hyper Beam is Lapras's best bet to finish off Pokemon with a high Special but low Defense, such as Chansey and Alakazam, which are otherwise good answers to Lapras; however, Body Slam may be preferred, as it gives Lapras the ability to somewhat reliably paralyze opposing Starmie. The last slot is usually Sing, a move that provides great utility and scares off Pokemon that would otherwise function as great Lapras answers, with Chansey usually being the main target. Its low accuracy can be unfortunate, as Lapras doesn't have easy ways to shrug off any status or damage that may come its way, so misses can be particularly devastating. If the sleep move is not necessary, you may opt to run Confuse Ray instead, which is Lapras's best shot at powering through paralyzed special walls.</p> <p>When using Lapras, you should first figure out a plan to take care of Chansey, as it can shrug off Blizzard quite easily. Snorlax's Self-Destruct and Exeggutor's Explosion are usually the best ways to achieve this, as your opponent should be able to preserve their Chansey quite easily by simply switching out if you try to defeat it via repeated Ice Beams, PP stalling, or strong physical attacks. However, it is still possible for Lapras to pressure Chansey via Sing, so if you cannot find an opportunity to threaten it via Explosion, you can still rely on Sing to get the job done. Non-paralyzed Starmie and Alakazam are both answers to Lapras as well, threatening to shut it down with Thunder Wave, as they are simply able to use Recover until Lapras is fully paralyzed. If running Body Slam, you should attempt to predict their entrance and hit them with it; should you manage to paralyze them, Lapras will outspeed them and be much harder to stop. Lapras has great potential to create significant advantages between access to Sing and strong matchups against very popular Pokemon such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon, but its checks must be taken care of before it can have any impact on the game.</p> "

Even many super effective attacks, such as Electabuzz's Thunderbolt, will fail to 2HKO it. Vaporeon is capable of dueling and checking mighty physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Dugtrio as well. Vaporeon isn't too concerned about paralysis either, making it one of the best absorbers of the status in the tier. Checking Normal-types, Articuno, Dugtrio, and even Tentacruel all in one, Vaporeon blends offense and defense perfectly, making it a very appreciated addition to many successful RBY UU teams.</p> <p>Still, though, Vaporeon is very slow, which can leave it vulnerable to Wrap from Dragonite or Tentacruel. Worse still, if Vaporeon is low on HP, this Wrap use will deny it from healing off damage with Rest. Vaporeon's reliance on Rest will also let heavy-hitting Pokemon like Persian, Kangaskhan, and Dugtrio safely switch in on the turn Rest is used, putting Vaporeon in a very precarious position. Being outrun by every sleeper in the tier, bar Tangela, can also make Vaporeon easy to put to sleep again after Rest if Sleep Clause isn't active. Finally, Vaporeon lacks coverage for opposing Water-types, though its higher damage output does tend to let it win prolonged interactions.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is an immensely strong option that allows Vaporeon to 2HKO almost any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, with some standout calculations being 2HKOs on Electabuzz, Persian, and Kangaskhan. However, its accuracy and PP leave much to be desired, making what should be the team's anchor very inconsistent. This also makes it easier for opposing Rest users to PP stall Vaporeon. Acid Armor lets Vaporeon wall physical attackers like Dodrio and Kangaskhan as well as take much less chip damage from Wrap, which can define late-game scenarios when its checks are removed. However, since it doesn't help against Persian or special attackers, which are just as common, it's difficult to justify.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Gyarados: Gyarados resists Surf and takes 27.7% maximum from Blizzard, all while possessing coverage in Thunderbolt to 4HKO Vaporeon, which can be turned into a 3HKO with Hyper Beam. Vaporeon simply can't risk contending with a healthy Gyarados and will be forced out by it frequently. Furthermore, the best counterplay to Vaporeon is to switch in on a predicted Rest to give it what for, and Gyarados is among the best punishes to a resting Vaporeon in the tier thanks to its offensive prowess.</p> <p><strong>Venusaur</strong>: Venusaur outspeeds Vaporeon and threatens it with either an uncontested Sleep Powder or a 2HKO from Razor Leaf. Venusaur is a particularly heavy punish to a resting Vaporeon as a result. The punish especially hurts if it's running Swords Dance, allowing it to set up and still get the 2HKO before Vaporeon can act. However, Venusaur really doesn't want to switch into Blizzard, which deals up to 60%, adding a degree of risk to the prediction game.</p> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Haunter is capable of switching in on Vaporeon's Body Slam and can 3HKO with Thunderbolt about half the time. Additionally, if necessary, Explosion KOes Vaporeon from half HP. Since it's faster, Haunter can also threaten Vaporeon with Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Normal-type Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers, like the tier's resident Normal-types, are great at switching in on and punishing Vaporeon's Rest. Persian is the most reliable method of dispatching Vaporeon, 3HKOing it with Slash. While less consistent overall, Dodrio and Kangaskhan can KO Vaporeon after two Body Slams followed by Hyper Beam. However, none of these Pokemon want to contest Vaporeon's nuclear attacks, especially if it runs Hydro Pump, which 2HKOes all of them. Even without Hydro Pump, Surf and Blizzard alike have odds to 2HKO them as well.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electabuzz, Raichu, and the rare Electrode can switch in on Rest and 3HKO Vaporeon with STAB Thunderbolt. Plus, thanks to their high Speed stats, a critical hit from any of them is reasonably likely and can be difficult for Vaporeon to recover from later. In a tight spot, Electrode also guarantees a 2HKO using Thunderbolt + Explosion. However, they all take significant damage from Surf, which they can't afford in the long run. In fact, if they switch in on Surf, they're liable to lose the one-on-one, making them deceptively shaky checks.</p> <p><strong>Swords Dance Tentacruel: If using a Swords Dance set, Tentacruel can swiftly chip Vaporeon down through Wrap damage and KO it from half HP with a +2 Hyper Beam. However, Tentacruel can't afford to switch into Body Slam, lest it gets forced into Rest much earlier than usual, and the Swords Dance set rarely runs Rest anyway. If Tentacruel doesn't have Swords Dance, however, Vaporeon can absolutely fish for a Wrap miss to either try for Body Slam paralysis or use Rest to PP stall. Ergo, standard Tentacruel sets should not be considered reliable Vaporeon checks.</p> <p><strong>Dewgong</strong>: If using Ice Beam, Dewgong can engage in a freeze war with Vaporeon which, given it exhausts all its PP, has an 81.98% chance of succeeding. Since its Ice typing makes it immune to being frozen itself, and its Water typing lets it resist Vaporeon's STAB moves, Dewgong is a serviceable answer to Vaporeon. However, Dewgong is less bulky than Vaporeon, making it more difficult to wake up from Rest in the long run. This also causes it to fail to outdamage Vaporeon in prolonged interactions.</p> ",

Body Slam enables Vaporeon to hit Water-types and thus the entire tier for neutral damage and scout for switch-ins, critically Tentacruel, which can flip the situation on its head if they get paralyzed. Tentacruel becomes much more manageable if it gets paralyzed, because it has to use Rest much earlier, so Body Slam denies it free entry. Rest gives Vaporeon significant longevity while removing the paralysis it will likely absorb early-game. Vaporeon's combined great offensive pressure and bulk warps the opponent's offensive play as well; this should be exploited to force out their key offensive Pokemon while getting free turns to scout with Body Slam.</p> <p>Vaporeon fits on a variety of teams. Pairing Vaporeon with almost any Flying-type Pokemon, like Dodrio or Aerodactyl, is a good choice thanks to its Ice resistance allowing it to check Articuno for them. Dragonite works particularly well, providing Vaporeon with an Electric neutrality and Grass resistance to fall back on. The two also offer each other essential paralysis support, as Vaporeon can use Body Slam against targets such as Tentacruel and Kadabra, while Dragonite can use Thunder Wave against offensive Normal-type Pokemon. Moreover, Vaporeon paired with any Flying-type Pokemon is a particularly good way to keep Dugtrio wavering between Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Slash. Oftentimes, Dugtrio is forced to use Slash, which is far easier to play around, at least compared to its nuclear Earthquake. Other Ice-weak Pokemon, such as Venusaur and Dugtrio, also appreciate Vaporeon's presence for similar reasons. Vaporeon makes a particularly potent defensive core alongside the ubiquitous Hypno as well; Vaporeon handles Dugtrio and Normal-types, while Hypno handles Electric-types and Venusaur.</p> <p>Teams that struggle against Wrap, particularly those with frailer Pokemon like Kadabra, will also benefit greatly from Vaporeon's presence, since it can take a massive amount of chip damage before it's in KO range for anything. Vaporeon can also be used alongside other bulky Water-types, such as Tentacruel, Gyarados, and Omastar, to make teams even more resilient to Wrap and offensive pressure. During Rest, remember that being trapped by Wrap still depletes sleep turns, which makes Vaporeon deceptively easy to wake up and therefore very effective for these types of teams. Vaporeon's HP must be carefully managed when against Wrap users, however.</p> "

Because of this, Jolteon is able to outpace the whole metagame and is one of the few Pokemon that can revenge kill a weakened Tauros. It is also a good lead because of its ability to force a lead Starmie to switch out with Thunderbolt and paralyze other leads like Alakazam, Exeggutor, and Jynx with Thunder Wave. Jolteon also has an important defensive niche that allows it to be one of the few Pokemon to take on Zapdos comfortably due to resisting both of its STAB options as well as put pressure on Water-types like Slowbro and Cloyster with Thunderbolt. While Pokemon like Chansey, Exeggutor, and Alakazam can take Jolteon's Thunderbolt, it can cripple these Pokemon with Thunder Wave. However, outside of its STAB move, Jolteon does not have any other good attacking moves, as it only has two good options in Pin Missile and Double Kick, which fail to do major damage outside of a potential critical hit even on super effective targets like Exeggutor and Chansey due to Jolteon's low Attack stat. Furthermore, Jolteon is unable to deal with Ground-types like Rhydon and Golem, as it cannot do any good damage to them with any of its attacks and gets OHKOed by Earthquake.</p> ",

Thunder is a more powerful move that allows Jolteon to OHKO Cloyster and Tauros on a critical hit; however, the miss chance and lower PP make it hard to justify using it over Thunderbolt or over Rest or Pin Missile. Body Slam can be run over Rest or Pin Missile to try to paralyze Rhydon and Golem as they switch in; however, it is redundant otherwise, as Thunder Wave is able to paralyze Pokemon like Alakazam and Exeggutor as is.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rhydon and Golem: Both Rhydon and Golem wall Jolteon, as they're immune to Thunderbolt and Double Kick fails to do any major damage to them, while they OHKO it back with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Though it needs to be wary of potential critical Thunderbolts, Snorlax is relatively happy to switch into Thunder Wave, can tank a Thunderbolt, and threatens Jolteon immensely with any of Body Slam, Earthquake, or Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor and Victreebel</strong>: Without Pin Missile, Jolteon cannot take care of Grass-types, as Thunderbolt fails to do a lot of damage to them.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Without Rest, Jolteon cannot get rid of paralysis, which hinders it from sweeping late-game and makes it easy for any offensive Pokemon to take care of it by exposing its frailty. Jolteon wins a full one-on-one against Thunder Wave users such as Chansey, Starmie, and Zapdos, but they can simply paralyze it and switch out; Alakazam can even attempt to beat Jolteon by itself.</p> ",

It is also good to use against Tauros, as it is no longer a threat once it's paralyzed. Thunderbolt takes care of Water-types like Starmie and Slowbro and can do a lot of damage to Pokemon that don't resist it if Jolteon lands a critical hit. Double Kick scares out Chansey because it is 2HKOed on a critical hit. Double Kick also allows Jolteon to have a way to get damage on Ground-types like Rhydon and Golem as a last resort, though Jolteon should switch out if it predicts them to switch in to help keep damage off of itself and its teammates. Rest allows Jolteon to get HP back and cure itself of paralysis, which is useful against Pokemon like Chansey, Starmie, and Zapdos; however, outside of these Pokemon, Jolteon will find it hard to use Rest, as the move is more useful late-game, and putting Jolteon to sleep allows Tauros to come in safety. Pin Missile gives Jolteon a way to deal with Grass-types such as Exeggutor, as it will deal major damage if it lands a critical hit on them. If Jolteon is being used as a lead, the best move to start the game is Thunder Wave in order to slow down opposing leads like Jynx, Exeggutor, and Alakazam; however, Jolteon must be careful, as this can lead to it being put to sleep with Lovely Kiss or Sleep Powder or paralyzed from Thunder Wave or Stun Spore. Because of its poor bulk, the best way to have Jolteon come in safely is against Pokemon like Chansey, on a predicted switch, or when a Pokemon faints. Jolteon should be saved to use late-game because of its Speed, as it can pick off most weakened Pokemon with Thunderbolt. Jolteon will need Pokemon like Exeggutor and Starmie on the team because it struggles against common Ground-types like Rhydon and Golem. Pokemon that can also help with Snorlax and Tauros like Cloyster and Exeggutor are needed.</p> "

  "Omastar": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Omastar first appeared on the RBY UU stage because it was thought to be a strong counter to the then recently-released legendary birds, Articuno and Moltres, as well as the Wrap-happy Dragonite to a lesser extent. However, as the metagame progressed, other significant Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Vaporeon proved more than capable of keeping the birds at bay. As Articuno became less potent and Moltres fell into obscurity, Omastar began to find itself somewhat unemployed. As such, Omastar dwells near the bottom of the RBY UU metagame. It competes quite closely with Vaporeon, which is widely regarded as the tier’s premier bulky Water-type. Despite stiff competition, Omastar has a few attributes that set it apart from Vaporeon and other defensively-oriented Pokemon.</p> <p>Omastar’s most notable trait is its Rock typing, which makes it a much more specialized defensive unit compared to Vaporeon and the like. It matches up well against Pokemon that rely primarily or exclusively on Normal-, Flying-, or Fire-type moves such as Persian, Dodrio, and Moltres. Omastar is also rivaled only by Haunter and Golem at handling Wrap damage and Explosion. On the negative side, Omastar shares many of the same weaknesses held by other defensive Water-types, such as against Electric-type moves, while acquiring some additional ones. These include a new weakness to Ground-type moves, a worsened weakness to Grass-type moves, and the inability to resist the many Water-type attacks in the tier. Finally, Omastar is remarkably slow, being outpaced by every major Pokemon in the tier aside from Golem. This renders it highly susceptible to being revenge killed.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aside from its Rock typing, Seismic Toss is pretty much Omastar's only unique advantage over Vaporeon. It can be fairly useful for its consistent damage against any target. However, most Pokemon are simply hit harder by Omastar’s other moves or more threatened by the chance of paralysis from Body Slam, so the move isn’t overly common or useful. It is strongly advised to stick to the suggested set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Omastar’s archrival Vaporeon is also one of its most consistent checks. Vaporeon takes very little from all of Omastar’s moves and is relatively unfazed by paralysis. Vaporeon also uses Omastar’s Rock typing against it by scoring a 4HKO with Surf or a 3HKO with Hydro Pump. Poliwrath is in a similar boat, as it shrugs off Omastar’s attacks quite easily and can retaliate with a super effective move like Earthquake or Submission. Finally, while it fears paralysis, Tentacruel easily emerges victorious against Omastar thanks to its access to the strongest unboosted Surf in the tier.</p> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Users: Electabuzz and Raichu are two of the scariest Pokemon for Omastar to face. While Hydro Pump does quite a lot to both, both dispatch Omastar with relatively uncontested 2HKOs. While it lacks STAB on the move, Gyarados is also more than capable of winning the matchup, even if it switches in. Other users such as Haunter and Persian can't reliably switch in, but they can use their superior Speed to threaten Omastar in a pinch, especially if Omastar has taken a few hits or is asleep.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake Users: While Omastar is well-equipped to handle Normal- and Flying-type moves, its Rock typing leaves it exposed to Earthquake. Omastar is capable of beating every Earthquake user aside from Poliwrath one-on-one, but the move limits Omastar’s ability to switch in. Earthquake users can also revenge kill Omastar without much damage or paralysis support due to its low Speed. A sleeping Omastar can be exploited rather easily for this same reason. The wrong situation can make Pokemon that Omastar usually matches up well against, like Kangaskhan, Dugtrio, and Golem, suddenly threatening.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: While rare, Grass-type Pokemon truly threaten Omastar. Venusaur is especially scary, for it outspeeds and claims a clean OHKO with Razor Leaf. Tangela that choose to use Mega Drain can easily 2HKO Omastar while recovering enough health to not be too fearful of Omastar’s Blizzard. Additionally, its Mega Drain begins to enter OHKO territory after just two uses of Growth.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This is the main set you can expect to see Omastar run. It strongly resembles the set most often employed by Vaporeon and seeks to accomplish many of the same goals. Surf or Hydro Pump is its all-purpose STAB move. Both moves hit neutral and weak targets quite effectively thanks to Omastar’s rather high Special stat. Hydro Pump's extra damage is notable for a few targets, such as scoring a 3HKO against Hypno and a guaranteed 2HKO against Kangaskhan and Persian. Surf misses some benchmarks but has higher accuracy and PP. Blizzard grants Omastar coverage resisted only by Water-types. It is also notable for being extremely likely to OHKO Dragonite, rendering it unable to use Agility. It also outperforms Surf and Hydro Pump against a few targets such as Dodrio, Gyarados, and the handful of Grass-types that lurk in the tier. Body Slam is mainly for hitting opposing Water-types. Its most notable target is Tentacruel; should Body Slam paralyze it, it will likely be forced to use Rest and thus become much easier to exploit. Rest is, of course, to keep Omastar healthy, especially against less offensive teams. Successfully using Rest and waking up is quite difficult in the RBY UU environment, but Omastar can occasionally use Rest in front of the Pokemon it can wall and attempt to wake up amidst the many turns of Wrap likely to occur as the match continues.</p> <p>Omastar is quite good at slowing down your opponent’s offensive momentum. Its Rock typing can be very helpful for pivoting into the many Normal-type moves thrown around in the tier. Omastar can come in rather freely against Persian and Kangaskhan, provided they are using a Normal-type move, and threaten a 2HKO in return. Omastar becomes especially potent if switched in against a Hyper Beam, as it essentially has a free turn to use a powerful special attack. It should be noted that a revealed Omastar is a fairly good deterrent to reckless use of Hyper Beam and Explosion. Additionally, Omastar completely walls Dodrio and Articuno, only fearing the latter freezing it. While it is hardly worth mentioning in the modern metagame because they are so uncommon, Omastar is exceptional at walling Fire-type Pokemon.</p> <p>Omastar also has interesting interactions with Wrap. It resists the attack, so it is quite good at either PP stalling the attacker or simply taking the hits and hoping to punish a miss. When paired with other Pokemon that take little or no damage from Wrap, like Haunter and Golem, Omastar can feasibly force Tentacruel or Dragonite to exhaust all of their Wrap PP by simply switching in and out with the other Pokemon. Such a strategy can still be exploited by many potential Omastar switch-ins, such as Dugtrio, Electabuzz, and Raichu. This can be overcome with proper prediction; you can pivot into a Pokemon that matches up well against common switch-ins to Omastar. And in end-games where many of these attackers are KOed, Omastar can help secure victories against Pokemon that are dependent on Wrap for damage, such as some variants of Dragonite.</p> <p>As the tier’s premier Articuno check, Omastar is quite useful on teams that struggle with the legendary bird. Teammates such as Dugtrio, Tangela, and Venusaur most appreciate Omastar's combination of attributes. These three Pokemon also happen to handle Electric-type Pokemon quite well, which threaten Omastar. Flying-type Pokemon like Gyarados, Dragonite, and Dodrio similarly appreciate Omastar’s resistance to Ice while also switching into the Earthquakes that Omastar frequently baits in; these Earthquakes also help the latter two safely set up with Agility. While Omastar is a decidedly defensive Pokemon, it is quite good at enabling its offensive teammates, either by giving them a partner into which they can pivot or by spreading paralysis via Body Slam.</p> "

Mega Kick can be used as a weaker version of Hyper Beam that has no recharge. However, due to the fact that it is weaker than Hyper Beam, it can end up being the difference between a sweep or not.

      "overview": "<p>Aerodactyl is able to find a niche on anti-Wrap cores thanks to its exceptionally high Speed, which allows it to check and revenge kill even some of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, like Dugtrio and Persian. This Speed gives it an incredible 25.39% critical hit rate while also making it difficult to pin down with Wrap. Aerodactyl also has an amazing defensive typing that provides it with immunity to Earthquake and resistance to Normal-type attacks, granting it great synergy with physically frail Pokemon like Electabuzz and Raichu. Finally, Aerodactyl's Normal resistance allows it to PP stall Wrap, dissuade Explosion, and force recharges from Hyper Beam.</p> <p>However, Aerodactyl comes with a slew of problems. It's hindered severely by a lack of STAB options, with its sole semi-functional one being the mediocre Sky Attack. This extends to the rest of its offensive movepool, often leading Aerodactyl to use Fire Blast. Overall, these movepool issues limit Aerodactyl's damage output by quite a bit. Furthermore, its reliance on Double-Edge forces it to take heavy recoil and leaves it susceptible to knocking itself into KO range, severely limiting its defensive use throughout a game. Defensively, Aerodactyl is very frail specially, taking massive damage from Surf and Blizzard, both very common attacks in the tier. As a result, it will struggle against threats like its extinct brethren Omastar and often get forced out. Aerodactyl is extremely reliant on its Speed as well, making paralysis a near-death sentence, once again forcing it out if it can't KO the user before it gets paralyzed. This is further amplified by the risk of Body Slam paralyzing it, which makes what would otherwise be a switch-in opportunity a dangerous game to play.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aerodactyl's fourth move slot is the most expendable, and while its movepool is very limited, this isn't to say there aren't options. Rest is the most relevant option, allowing Aerodactyl to serve a more defensive role while removing paralysis, ensuring it can maintain a defensive presence throughout a game. Considering Wrap deducts sleep turns, Rest plays well into Aerodactyl's playstyle. However, Rest also makes it easy setup fodder for Dragonite. Alternatively, Sky Attack can be used to hit Haunter and OHKO Kadabra, which isn't unfeasible if it's charged during a Recover turn in Kadabra's case, but its two-turn nature and shaky accuracy make it unreliable and specific.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types: Aerodactyl can't scratch Rock-types at all—especially Omastar and Golem—and is weak to almost every attack they commonly use. As a result, Aerodactyl invites these threats in just by existing and will be subsequently forced out.</p> <p><strong>Haunter: Haunter is immune to Aerodactyl's main attacking options and takes minimal damage from Fire Blast. As if this weren't enough, it 2HKOes Aerodactyl with Thunderbolt. The best Aerodactyl can offer against it is a potential burn, which makes its Explosion pitifully weak. However, Haunter must be wary of Sky Attack.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Aerodactyl takes heavy damage from any viable Water-type's STAB Surf. While it can survive Surf from Vaporeon at full HP, Double-Edge's recoil means it will almost never be in a situation where it can make use of it. This also makes Tentacruel's 28.2% chance to OHKO Aerodactyl with Surf much more imposing. Gyarados can 2HKO Aerodactyl with Surf or Thunderbolt or even OHKO it with Hydro Pump 89.7% of the time. However, Aerodactyl is very capable of revenge killing Water-types not named Omastar through Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Aerodactyl's main strength in RBY UU is its Speed, so paralysis is the bane of its existence. It will force Aerodactyl to use Agility to remain in control, assuming it is running it, which can be very difficult to set up reliably and leaves it open to exploitation from Pokemon like Dragonite. Unless Aerodactyl can take out opposing paralysis inducers like Electabuzz and Hypno, it's forced to switch out. It should be noted that they're KOed by Hyper Beam from 47.1% and 37.5% onwards, respectively. Raichu can notably use Agility to outspeed Aerodactyl and 2HKO it with Thunderbolt. Electrode can do the same, and its naturally higher Speed makes matters worse. Body Slam's paralysis chance can also make checking Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Dodrio much riskier than it should be, making what would normally be a valid point of entry a potential death sentence.</p> <p><strong>Articuno: Articuno takes middling damage from Aerodactyl's options outside of Fire Blast, can boost itself to become faster than it through Agility, and OHKOes it with Blizzard. If Articuno has used Agility, Aerodactyl can't do anything.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: While a Toxic or even burn from Aerodactyl will completely stuff its chances of a Wrap sweep, Dragonite is more than capable of beating Aerodactyl. It can use Agility to outspeed and 2HKO Aerodactyl with Blizzard or Thunderbolt, and it doesn't take much damage from its attacks. It also has access to Thunder Wave, which incapacitates Aerodactyl and makes it much more vulnerable to Wrap.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Double-Edge acts as Aerodactyl's main attacking move, allowing it to deal significant damage to physically weak Pokemon. Double-Edge notably 2HKOes Kadabra and puts Dugtrio into range for Hyper Beam. Hyper Beam allows Aerodactyl to revenge kill opposing Pokemon very effectively, KOing Tentacruel from 40.2% onwards. Fire Blast is most useful for the significant burn chance, which can incapacitate physical attackers and cause Wrap users to take more damage than they can deal when using it. Toxic can be used to prevent a Wrap sweep from Agility + Wrap Dragonite, but Agility is helpful for ignoring the Speed drop from paralysis. Fire Blast works well with Toxic, as burning Haunter and Tentacruel—which are immune to it—allows your own Tentacruel to further chip them using Wrap.</p> <p>Aerodactyl's main purpose during a game is to revenge kill Pokemon and prevent Wrap cores from making progress, all while providing defensive support through its typing. This is best facilitated by the use of partners that, like Aerodactyl, take minimal damage from Wrap, such as Haunter, Omastar, and Vaporeon. Alternatively, Aerodactyl can be fit onto teams with offensive Pokemon that can give it openings to sweep like Persian, Kangaskhan, and Dragonite. Overall, this culminates into a hit-and-run playstyle that makes it work well, be it early- or late-game.</p> <p>Aerodactyl's resistance to Normal-type attacks and high Speed mean it can switch in on Wrap with near-impunity, taking minimal damage while guaranteeing damage on the opposing Wrap user should Aerodactyl stay in. Aerodactyl also happens to switch in well against Pokemon that use their teammate's Wrap to switch in freely, such as Dugtrio and Persian. This makes it a good response to these switch-ins with good prediction, especially if it comes in the same turn as them. Overall, Aerodactyl serves as very effective means to check these fast threats, dictating the game state efficiently by denying the opposing team momentum.</p> <p>Aerodactyl's Ground immunity makes it well equipped for double switching, allowing it to ease in Electric-types like Electabuzz, as well as Haunter and Tentacruel, through deterring the use of Earthquake. This makes Aerodactyl suitable for teams that lead with Electabuzz, as Dugtrio is fairly likely to switch in immediately, and Aerodactyl can KO Dugtrio with Double-Edge + Hyper Beam. Since Aerodactyl is thoroughly debilitated by paralysis, it appreciates having a Ground-type teammate like Dugtrio or Golem to switch in on Thunder Wave and maintain momentum.</p> "

  "Snorlax": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Snorlax is a centerpiece of the RBY OU metagame. It is present on almost every team due to its incredible strength, bulk, and versatility, in spite of its terrible Speed. Thanks to Reflect, Snorlax can upgrade its physical bulk to truly remarkable levels and begin firing powerful Body Slams with little concern about incoming hits. Defensive answers to its Body Slam do exist, but Snorlax has access to a plethora of options to threaten them, such as Earthquake to get around Gengar and Counter users, or Ice Beam to freeze Pokemon which try to fight Snorlax's Reflect with their own. Furthermore, Snorlax can even opt to give up a traditional Reflect set and catch opponents off-guard by using less common moves such as Amnesia or Counter, which can allow it to bypass some common answers, and it even has access to the strongest Self-Destruct in the game, giving it the ability to eliminate almost any Pokemon if necessary, with only Gengar and Rhydon being able to comfortably absorb it.</p> <p>Despite all these positive qualities, Snorlax comes with two inherent flaws: the lowest Speed in the metagame, only tied with Slowbro, and a lack of recovery outside of Rest. This means that once Snorlax is put to sleep it is possible for many special attackers in the tier to threaten it with their STABs: Psychic from the likes of Exeggutor, Starmie, Alakazam, and even Jynx can rapidly snowball out of control due to the high chance of Special drops, and other strong attacks such as STAB Thunderbolt from Zapdos or STAB Blizzard from any of the Ice-types in the tier can also ensure Snorlax is punished for its Rest turns. Nevertheless, Snorlax is one of the biggest offensive threats and one of the hardest Pokemon to KO at the same time, and its set can be tailored to cover any desirable match ups effectively, which means it's usually hard to find reasons not to run Snorlax on your team.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Snorlax can drop Body Slam entirely to run an Ice Beam / Reflect / Amnesia / Rest set that simply aims to soak up damage and spam Ice Beam until it manages to freeze a foe, but it generally needs to be on very specific types of teams to function, is completely helpless against Ice-types, and needs some luck to break through paralyzed Starmie and Chansey, as Ice Beam's limited PP means so Snorlax cannot fish for consecutive paralysis for long.</p> <p>Surf is the best option available to Snorlax to hit Rhydon and Golem, but given that most Snorlax sets run either Reflect or an Ice-type attack, if not both, the situations where Surf is useful are rare.</p> <p>Harden is sometimes preferred over Reflect for the higher PP count and ability to reapply the Speed drop on paralyzed foes, but it is considerably weaker at answering physical attackers, which is usually the primary duty of Reflect Snorlax.</p> <p>Another unusual set is Body Slam / Amnesia / Thunderbolt / Self-Destruct or Rest: given that Starmie and Cloyster are common switch-ins once Amnesia is revealed and that Thunderbolt is a very, very uncommon attack on Snorlax, this set can attempt to lure them in and cripple them with a strong super-effective attack. Self-Destruct is preferred in the final slot as an emergency option that allows Snorlax to bail out of unsuccessful lure attempts with an even trade, but it is possible to use Rest instead in an attempt to preserve Snorlax as a long-term defensive answer. On this set, it is also possible to use Blizzard instead of Body Slam to avoid being completely walled by Rhydon, though it makes Snorlax much weaker against Chansey and Alakazam, so it is usually not preferred.</p> <p>Body Slam / Reflect / Rest sets can afford a few more options in the fourth moveslot. Toxic can allow partial trappers such as Cloyster, Moltres, Victreebel, and Dragonite to be significantly more dangerous, as any poisoned Pokemon attempting to stall out their PP will run out of HP much more quickly, and Snorlax is particularly good at luring in optimal Toxic targets such as Reflect Chansey. Another move that can fill that slot is Amnesia, making Snorlax incredibly difficult to threaten via special attacks alone but ultimately leaving it relatively powerless, with Body Slam as its only attack. Counter is also viable, as after Reflect has been revealed, opponents will most likely stop playing around Counter, giving you some opportunities to net surprise KOs with it.</p> <p>Other Normal-type attacks such as Mega Kick and Double-Edge are rarely seen due to their drawbacks and overall lack of usefulness when Body Slam is such a reliable move and Hyper Beam is a much stronger one, but the ability to repeatedly hit with a greater Base Power can occasionally come in handy.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Reflect Users: Reflect users, particularly Chansey and opposing Snorlax, can switch in on Body Slam and neutralize the damage output from Snorlax fairly efficiently. They are by far the most reliable defensive answers to Snorlax, and a vast majority of RBY teams are forced to include one of the two, if not both, to check it.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar deserves a special mention due to its unique Ghost typing, which allows it to wall all Snorlax sets that lack Earthquake and use Snorlax as an opportunity to threaten either status with Hypnosis or damage with Thunderbolt. It is especially useful against Snorlax sets that only run Normal-type attacks, but it also performs well against any set that lacks Earthquake or Amnesia (unless Snorlax gets a lucky freeze with Ice Beam).</p> <p><strong>Cloyster and Slowbro</strong>: Cloyster and Slowbro are the next best options to switch into Body Slam. Their high defensive stats allow them to come out of the one-on-one matchup on top, but their reliance on Rest to stay healthy and failure to pose a significant immediate threat mean they aren't always the most reliable answers to Snorlax. Slowbro is especially notable, as it can use a sleeping Snorlax as a golden opportunity to set up Amnesia; however, Cloyster has better physical bulk, allowing it to avoid a 4HKO from Body Slam, as well as the ability to use Explosion in case things start to go wrong after paralysis from Body Slam.</p> <p><strong>Other Special Attackers</strong>: Although there aren't many special attackers that enjoy taking a Body Slam to the face, many of them are powerful enough to 3HKO Snorlax, which means they can exert a lot of pressure over it, especially when it's forced to use Rest and sit still for a few turns. Starmie, Lapras, Exeggutor, and Zapdos are some good examples of Pokemon that can force Snorlax out with their strong STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Porygon: Although Porygon's base stats are pitiful, it has access to a very specific set of qualities that make it just good enough to handle Snorlax: it is faster, it is immune to Body Slam's paralysis due to its typing, and Recover's 32 PP allow it to outstall Body Slam's 24 PP. Snorlax's only hopes of breaking down Porygon usually rest on the possibility of landing either a critical hit with Body Slam or a freeze with Ice Beam; however, Porygon is very weak, and it is incredibly easy for the Snorlax player to simply switch out.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types Carrying Rest</strong>: Another very specific countermeasure, Rock-types carrying Rest are generally able to outstall any Snorlax variant that isn't carrying the specific coverage for them. As long as the Rock-type has Rest to stall out repeated Body Slams, there are quite a few of them that can win the one-on-one matchup: non-Earthquake Snorlax will be unable to break through Omastar and Kabutops, non-Ice Beam Snorlax will struggle to wear down Aerodactyl, and even Rhydon can beat a Snorlax in the long run if Snorlax is only carrying Normal-type moves.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Snorlax's Body Slam is one of the most difficult attacks to switch into in the tier due to its sheer power, its paralysis chance, and the relative lack of Normal-type switch-ins in the tier. Reflect allows Snorlax to take on physical attackers, most importantly opposing Snorlax, much more comfortably. Rest gives Snorlax the ability to remain healthy throughout the game. A lot of moves can fit in the last moveslot. The most common one is Ice Beam, as it allows Snorlax to potentially freeze opposing Reflect users, which can otherwise neutralize its Body Slam; however, this leaves Snorlax unable to threaten large amounts of damage in one turn, which means its matchup against many important Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Zapdos, Cloyster, and Lapras goes from bad to worse, and even its ability to power through a paralyzed Starmie or Chansey goes down significantly. Self-Destruct allows Snorlax to function as a wallbreaker if needed, as well as a defensive piece thanks to Reflect and Rest if preferred, while Hyper Beam provides some of Self-Destruct's wallbreaking power without you having to sacrifice your Snorlax for it; however, a Snorlax that is only carrying Normal-type attacks will struggle against Rock-types and will be entirely unable to damage Ghost-types. Lastly, although Earthquake doesn't provide the freeze threat of Ice Beam or the immediate power of the other moves, it allows Snorlax to beat Gengar and Counter Chansey, two Pokemon that, albeit rare, are usually specifically devised to beat it.</p> <p>Using Reflect Snorlax is particularly nuanced due to having to balance Snorlax as both an offensive and defensive tool. If used too aggressively, it might take a KO but subsequently struggle to find turns to heal back up with Rest, making it a trade that is not always worth taking. On the other hand, if used too passively, it will invite too much offensive pressure and eventually collapse without achieving much of anything. Optimal usage of Reflect Snorlax requires careful analysis of the game state as well as appropriate prediction, but when properly managed, it is incredibly potent, as the special attackers that can threaten it lack either recovery or physical bulk, meaning that teams will generally resort to various stalling tactics to force Snorlax to use Rest first and then pressure it during its sleep turns. Reflect Snorlax is at its best early-game when the opponent has one or more paralyzed Pokemon to take advantage of, most commonly Alakazam and Chansey, and when its teammates can offer the necessary defensive cover against special attackers, but it is no slouch late-game either, as it can trade one-for-one with most Pokemon and has an important positive matchup against Tauros.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This moveset is fairly straightforward: maximize offensive prowess to wallbreak as well as possible. Body Slam is the go-to attack to inflict damage, and combined with Hyper Beam, it makes Snorlax particularly dangerous and hard to switch into, especially for paralyzed foes. Self-Destruct is an incredibly potent move to take down an extra Pokemon with Snorlax's last breath or even to take opposing Pokemon by surprise earlier on if the situation calls for it. The last moveslot is a toss-up: Earthquake allows Snorlax to play around Counter Chansey much more comfortably, as well as hitting Gengar and threatening Rhydon, but it can be dropped in favor of Counter, a tool that allows this Snorlax set to muscle through an opponent's Reflect Snorlax with correct prediction. Counter may also be used in conjunction with Earthquake and in place of Hyper Beam; the lack of Hyper Beam is quite noticeable, as it makes Snorlax much less threatening as a wallbreaker, but Earthquake offers unique coverage that could be worth keeping for specific matchups.</p> <p>The absence of recovery on this Snorlax set makes it far riskier to utilize, as it can only take a few hits before being forced to use Self-Destruct. Therefore, this Snorlax set needs to be considered as a tool to accelerate the game and little else, as its defensive capabilities are very limited. This often just means using an early-game Self-Destruct on the opponent's Reflect user to remove them from the situation before they get a chance to set up Reflect. It must be noted that this is a one-for-one trade, which is not always advantageous, but it is often the best that can be achieved with this set, as it is often endlessly walled by Reflect users otherwise; recognizing when to be greedy and when to accept a simple Self-Destruct trade is key to achieving good results with this Snorlax set.</p> "

The last move defines the type of game you want to play with this set: Self-Destruct means hard and fast wallbreaking, as Snorlax simply doesn't have the durability to set up Amnesia multiple times throughout the game, while Rest gives Snorlax those opportunities to set up but leaves it notably vulnerable to Tauros. Ice Beam is an option over Blizzard for the higher PP, which is especially relevant on Rest sets, but Blizzard's considerably greater damage output is generally preferred.</p> <p>This set is quite dangerous to play against due to how difficult it is to answer if your Chansey is paralyzed. Nearly every other common Pokemon is threatened by either Body Slam or a boosted Blizzard, with Water-types like Starmie and Lapras being the best answers defensively but struggling to deal significant damage in return thanks to the Special boost. However, a healthy Chansey usually has no issues switching in and walling this Snorlax variant until it's forced to use Rest, which, in turn, leaves it vulnerable against Tauros. The conditions for this set to excel are difficult to set up, but when they are achieved, this Snorlax set can decide games on its own.</p> "

  "Articuno": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>With an incredible Special stat, the strongest unboosted special attack in the generation, and access to Agility, it's easy to see why Articuno is one of the most dangerous sweepers in RBY UU. The raw power of Articuno's Blizzard is enough to 2HKO nearly two-thirds of the metagame, frequently 2HKOing specially bulky Pokemon like Kadabra and Haunter and always 2HKOing offensive titans like Kangaskhan and Persian; for many Pokemon, just switching into Articuno and surviving is a herculean task. Articuno's incredible bulk also surpasses that of many tier staples, like Tentacruel, Hypno, Kangaskhan, and Tangela. It is only surpassed in physical bulk by Omastar and Golem, and in special bulk by Vaporeon. This fantastic bulk allows Articuno to set up against many targets without fear of being taken out quickly, as well as making it even harder to stop once it begins sweeping. It can also check physical attackers such as Persian, Dodrio, Kangaskhan, and Dugtrio, a trait appreciated by many teams.</p> <p>However, Articuno's Blizzard is a significant reason why bulky Water-types like Tentacruel and Vaporeon are so dominant, as they can shrug off the hit with relative ease; Articuno must rely on its mediocre physical movepool to break past them. Articuno's middling Speed tier is another notable weakness, as being slower than Tentacruel makes it vulnerable to Wrap and leaves it open to being revenge killed by Dugtrio, Persian, and Kangaskhan, unless it finds an opportunity to use Agility. Nonetheless, Articuno's raw power makes it a staple pick on many successful offensive teams.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>On the vast majority of teams, Articuno is best off using its standard set; however, it does have some options which can prove useful. Ice Beam can be used over Double-Edge, giving Articuno another Ice-type attack with better accuracy and more PP than Blizzard to pick off targets such as Dugtrio without worrying about Blizzard's accuracy. Ice Beam also improves Articuno's ability to fish for a freeze as a desperation play. However, Double-Edge is preferred due to its better damage output against Water-types. Rest enables it to consistently take hits and pressure the opponent throughout the game, but it is hard to justify using Rest over Articuno's other moves, as this severely cuts into its sweeping prowess. In a similar vein, Articuno can run Reflect to bolster its defensive prowess, but justifying it over other moves is difficult. Also, critical hits ignore Reflect’s Defense boost, rendering it completely useless against Pokemon with Slash such as Persian.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Many bulky Water-types in RBY UU can switch into Articuno's Blizzard and defeat it. Tentacruel is the most common and can wear it down with Wrap while keeping it from attacking. Worse still, it can use Rest to heal off any damage it may take. However, if Tentacruel takes some chip damage beforehand and Articuno uses Agility on the switch, then Tentacruel becomes a far worse check, as Articuno only needs one Double-Edge critical hit to bring it into Hyper Beam KO range. Vaporeon is another strong answer to Articuno, taking very little damage from Blizzard or Double-Edge while threatening reasonable damage in return with Surf and healing off the damage it does take with Rest. Dewgong and Omastar in particular are hard walls for Articuno, as both take very little damage from Double-Edge or Blizzard and can use Rest if they are at low health. Outside of a timely freeze against Omastar, Articuno needs two consecutive critical hits with Double-Edge or Blizzard against Dewgong and Omastar, respectively, to subsequently break through them on its own. Poliwrath can take a couple of Blizzards before going down, but it is unable to threaten Articuno outside of Hypnosis or Body Slam paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Hypno and Kadabra: While Hypno and Kadabra are by no means reliable answers or even good switch-ins to Articuno, they can act as soft checks in some scenarios. If Hypno is at full health and not asleep, it can take two Blizzards while paralyzing Articuno in return and potentially doing some damage with Psychic or burning limited Blizzard PP with Rest. Kadabra can also take a Blizzard or Double-Edge from full health, and paralyze Articuno in return, before healing off any damage it takes with Recover and praying for full paralysis. However, Articuno can use Agility to remove the Speed drop and then fish for a Double-Edge or Blizzard critical hit fairly safely, finishing Kadabra off with Hyper Beam once it does land the critical hit. Still, though, Double-Edge's recoil damage can add up over repeated uses, and repeated Recovers can stall out Blizzard’s low PP.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Dugtrio, Persian, Electabuzz, and Raichu can all threaten to KO Articuno if it has taken chip damage and has not yet used Agility. However, none of these Pokemon can switch into Articuno's Blizzard without suffering severe damage, if not being KOed outright.</p> <p><strong>Rock Slide Users: Golem, Kangaskhan, and Dugtrio can deal significant damage to Articuno due to its severe Rock weakness. Golem and Dugtrio are OHKOed by Blizzard, which limits them to hitting Articuno as it switches in or revenge killing a weakened Articuno, especially in the case of Dugtrio. If Kangaskhan chooses to run Rock Slide, it becomes a true Articuno check, because it outspeeds and 2HKOes Articuno with Rock Slide while surviving its Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: While Agility does let it ignore the Speed drop, Articuno doesn't handle paralysis all that gracefully, considering its two best moves only have 89.45% accuracy. This means a paralyzed Articuno is dealing damage a mere 67.09% of the time. Paralysis also makes less consistent checks, like Tentacruel, significantly more reliable.</p> ",
      "sets": [
        {
          "name": "Agility Sweeper",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Articuno's Blizzard is the strongest special attack in the generation and its primary attacking move, capable of KOing most Pokemon in only two or three hits. Double-Edge and Hyper Beam help Articuno combat Water-types and Kadabra attempting to stop it from running over teams, with Double-Edge having additional utility as a finishing move with better accuracy and more PP than Blizzard or Hyper Beam. Agility lets Articuno outspeed the unboosted metagame, making it harder to pin down with Wrap and allowing it to bypass the Speed drop from paralysis.</p> <p>Articuno usually operates in one of two distinct ways: as a late-game sweeper or as a tank. In the former role, Articuno generally stays in the back for most of the game, waiting for its answers to either be KOed or weakened to the point where they cannot contest its sweep, from there it begins to look for opportunities to come onto the field and use Agility. From there, the game is usually over, as Articuno will be able to summarily mop up the opposition, barring a couple of untimely Blizzard misses. The biggest obstacles to Articuno's sweeping are Tentacruel, Omastar, Vaporeon, and Dewgong, and it usually falls on Articuno's teammates to remove these Pokemon. However, Articuno can help in this process by coming onto the field safely, such as by double switching into a target that can be OHKOed by Blizzard like Dragonite or Dugtrio, and then attacking the predicted Water-type switch-in. This can be especially effective against a chipped Vaporeon or Dewgong, since a Double-Edge followed by a Hyper Beam will KO both of them from half health as they switch into Articuno to stop an Agility sweep. The other obstacle Articuno faces when operating as a sweeper is finding a turn to safely use Agility. Some examples of good opportunities for Articuno to come onto the field are sleeping targets, attacks it takes easily like Venusaur's Razor Leaf and Dugtrio's Earthquake, and predicted switches to a Normal-type attacker such as Kangaskhan, Persian, or Dodrio. Opponents are likely to play more cautiously with their Articuno checks if it is revealed, so they may be easier to remove if Articuno is revealed only once it is prepared to sweep.</p> <p>On the other hand, Articuno can perform the role of a tank admirably. With its incredible natural bulk and nuclear damage output, Articuno can aid its teammates by taking on some of the most dangerous physical attackers in the tier. From full health, Articuno can switch into and usually KO Kangaskhan and Dodrio. It can also beat Persian, Gyarados, and Dugtrio in a one-on-one matchup if it is reasonably healthy, barring critical hits. In general, Articuno can handle Normal-type attackers that otherwise greatly pressure frailer offensive teams. Furthermore, because of how strong Articuno's Blizzard is, it can help break past defensive Pokemon such as Hypno using Rest, Venusaur, and Tangela to enable teammates like Dugtrio, Persian, Electabuzz, and Kadabra. This way of using Articuno primarily works when facing offense structures that do not run multiple Water-types, as they often lack a good answer to a well-played Articuno outside of their Tentacruel.</p> <p>As mentioned before, Articuno despises bulky Water-types and thus appreciates teammates that can deal with them. Persian, Kangaskhan, Gyarados, and Dugtrio are fantastic Articuno partners, breaking through Articuno checks such as Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar. They can also weaken any other potential roadblocks to Articuno's sweep. In return, they appreciate Articuno's ability to deal with their common answers such as Kangaskhan, Tangela, Dragonite, opposing Dugtrio, and Aerodactyl. Electric-type Pokemon such as Electabuzz and Raichu can aid Articuno in breaking through Water-types as well, given their STAB Thunderbolts and high Speed stats They can also spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, which Articuno appreciates. In return, Articuno helps answer checks to Electric-types such as Dugtrio, Venusaur, and Tangela. Sleepers such as Tangela, Venusaur, and Haunter let Articuno easily set up or start dealing damage when facing a sleeping foe. In addition, their super effective Grass- and Electric-type attacks can help break through the pesky Water-types that Articuno hates. In return, Articuno helps deal with some of their common checks, such as Flying- and Grass-types—especially Dragonite and Dodrio—in the case of Venusaur and Tangela, and Dugtrio in the case of Haunter—albeit to a lesser extent because of Dugtrio's Rock Slide. Venusaur and Tangela come with the added benefit of checking Dugtrio and Electric-types, which can revenge kill or paralyze Articuno. This lets Articuno focus on dealing with other threats and avoid the risk of Dugtrio landing a critical hit with its Rock Slide. Lastly, Water-type Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Vaporeon can be valuable Articuno partners, as their defensive utility helps keep Articuno from overextending and lets it opt out of playing the mirror match.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Articuno’s Blizzard is the strongest attack in RBY that is not Explosion or Hyper Beam. It can even outdamage Mewtwo’s mighty Psychic against neutral targets if both are unboosted. Articuno specializes in tearing huge holes in opposing teams, achieving things like 3HKOs on Mew and Snorlax, 2HKOs on Tauros, Exeggutor, and Zapdos, and clean OHKOs on Rhydon and Golem. Blizzard is very easy to spam, as even resistant Pokemon usually take noticeable damage. The move also comes with a nice chance to freeze and disable a foe for the rest of the game. Articuno also is decently bulky and can take a few strong attacks. For example, Tauros's Body Slam usually takes less than a quarter of its health, assuming it does not get a critical hit.</p> <p>However, Articuno's movepool is abysmal, with almost exclusively Ice- and Normal-type moves to choose from. The latter come off of its mediocre Attack stat, leaving it unable to deal with certain bulky Pokemon like Cloyster and Starmie. Articuno is also rather slow, requiring paralysis support or an Agility in order to function effectively against faster Pokemon. Articuno's low Speed also prevents it from functioning as a good lead, as it is outsped by common leads like Gengar, Jynx, and Starmie. These weaknesses can make Articuno hard to fit on teams at times. Still, Articuno's devastating Blizzard will reward you handsomely for the compensation it needs.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Articuno’s barren movepool leaves it with very few other options to choose from. Sky Attack is a decent option, being Articuno’s only Flying-type STAB move and very powerful in its own right. It can be used over Articuno’s Normal-type coverage, dealing huge damage to Chansey and more damage to Mewtwo. However, its two-turn nature makes it less reliable and harder to use than other moves, and Blizzard does more damage to Mewtwo over two turns. Another option is Ice Beam to save precious Blizzard PP in certain situations. Alongside Rest, it can be used to fish for a freeze, with about an 85% chance to get one with all of its PP used. However, Ice Beam Articuno is completely walled by Jynx and Chansey, since it must drop its Normal-type coverage.</p> <p>Articuno can also utilize Reflect, alongside Rest, to become a good tank that easily staves off hits from Tauros, Mew, and Snorlax. Reflect Articuno's main goal is to freeze a foe, so it should run Ice Beam to maximize that chance. If Articuno uses Reflect, it will likely forgo Agility. This means that, while not completely ruined by paralysis, Reflect Articuno is threatened more by it, since it is forced to use Rest to negate the Speed drop.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ice-resistant Pokemon: Cloyster completely walls Articuno, since it is 4x resistant to Ice, can't be frozen, and has huge Defense to make Hyper Beam deal next to no damage. Similarly, Lapras takes almost zero damage from Blizzard, can't be frozen, and threatens Articuno with Thunderbolt; however, it must watch out for Hyper Beam if it's at low health. Slowbro can easily set up Amnesia on Articuno but fears a stray freeze or critical hits from Blizzard. Starmie can hit Articuno hard with Thunderbolt and heal from Blizzard damage with Recover, but it too must be wary of a freeze.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: While Chansey must be somewhat healthy to switch in on Articuno carrying Hyper Beam, it takes relatively little damage from Blizzard and can scare Articuno away with Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave + Seismic Toss. However, Chansey must be cautious to not be frozen in the process. Although rare, Articuno can use Sky Attack on a predicted switch to do massive damage the next turn; however, Chansey will likely just heal the damage off.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Zapdos</strong>: Jolteon outspeeds Articuno and will almost always 2HKO with Thunderbolt. Articuno also barely misses the 2HKO with Blizzard, meaning it needs a critical hit or a freeze to win one-on-one. Zapdos, albeit weak to Ice, outspeeds Articuno and threatens to 2HKO it with Thunderbolt while narrowly surviving one Blizzard. Jolteon and Zapdos can also paralyze an Agility-boosted Articuno with Thunder Wave to negate its Speed boost.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: None of Articuno’s attacks hit Mewtwo very hard after it has used Amnesia, except a critical hit Blizzard, and Mewtwo has Recover to heal off any damage it does take. Even unorthodox Mewtwo sets can take at least two Blizzards, allowing Mewtwo to use Thunder Wave on Articuno followed by heavy-hitting moves like Psychic, Thunderbolt, and Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: Mew, Gengar, and Snorlax, among others, can finish off a weakened Articuno with their powerful Explosions even after Articuno has set up with Agility. However, an Articuno using Reflect does not fear them.</p> ",

Hyper Beam gives Articuno better odds to defeat Chansey, as Blizzard + Hyper Beam deals a minimum of 59% of damage to it, while also dealing massive damage to Jynx. Double-Edge can be used if Articuno wants to avoid Hyper Beam recharge mind games, but the recoil damage can easily put it into KO range of other threats. Rest allows Articuno to stick around for much longer and fire off more Blizzards. Agility lets Articuno outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and ignore the Speed drop from paralysis. It also makes Articuno less reliant on team paralysis support.</p> <p>Articuno is best used early-game to rip holes into the opposing team with the sheer power of Blizzard, as even Water-types are afraid of switching into Blizzard because of its freeze chance. Switch Articuno in against weaker attacks, such as Chansey's attacks bar Thunderbolt, or on a predicted Earthquake from opposing Mew, Snorlax, or Tauros. It can also switch in against Earthquake from Rhydon or Golem, but it must be very careful, as Rock Slide from either can OHKO Articuno. However, if it manages to come in on their Earthquakes, Articuno will either OHKO them or force them out and do massive damage to something else. Articuno can also be used to absorb paralysis, since it can use Rest later to heal itself or use Agility to negate the Speed drop. Once Articuno is on the field, it should use Blizzard as often as it can and do as much damage to opposing teams as possible.</p> <p>Articuno greatly appreciates paralysis support from teammates such as Exeggutor, Mew, and Zapdos. This allows it to be less reliant on Agility, letting it start doing damage faster and more consistently. However, one must be careful when using Thunder Wave, as a Water-type switching into it becomes immune to freeze, meaning Articuno cannot threaten it at all. Tauros can capitalize on holes Articuno makes in the opponent’s team while supporting it by dealing with opposing Chansey, Starmie, and Jynx. It can also spread paralysis with Body Slam to assist Articuno. Articuno appreciates teammates that can deal with Slowbro, which it is helpless against most of the time. Zapdos, Jolteon, and Thunderbolt Mewtwo can use critical Thunderbolts to bypass Amnesia boosts and do huge damage to Slowbro, while Cloyster, Starmie, Lapras, and Light Screen Chansey wall Slowbro even after it has gained boosts. Light Screen Chansey can also check Amnesia Mewtwo, which Articuno struggles to damage after it has set up. Teams with Articuno tend to be weak to Electric-types, so a check to them like Rhydon, Golem, or Jolteon is appreciated.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Boasting one of the highest Special stats in the game along with the most powerful special move in OU, Blizzard, there's no denying that Articuno is a powerhouse. OHKOing Golem and Rhydon and 2HKOing Exeggutor are feats few Pokemon can muster, but Blizzard allows Articuno to do just that. It can force switches and deal heavy damage throughout the match, softening up your opponent's team and possibly causing a freeze. It can even make for a very nice end-game sweeper by boosting its mediocre base 85 Speed with Agility and blasting away with its STAB Blizzard, potentially getting a freeze in the process.</p> <p>Why isn't Articuno more common, then? Again, its Speed stat is frustratingly low, as it is not able to outspeed Pokemon like Tauros and Alakazam without a boost, while both are capable of paralyzing Articuno. It is walled to kingdom come by the many OU Pokemon that resist Blizzard, namely Lapras, Starmie, Cloyster, and to an extent, Slowbro, as well as Chansey with its massive 250/105 Special bulk. Its movepool is shallow as well, as it leaves Articuno relying on mediocre Ice / Normal coverage, the latter of which runs off its so-so Attack stat. Other Ice-types such as Lapras and Cloyster are generally preferred, due to access to helpful moves such as Thunderbolt and Explosion respectively. However, they can never dream of matching the raw power of Articuno's Blizzard. All-in-all, if you are looking to unleash a nasty surprise on your opponent, don't overlook Articuno.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With Articuno's barren yet focused movepool, there are very few other options it can run. Mimic is probably the best unlisted option, as if Articuno gets lucky enough to copy Thunderbolt from Starmie, it will always 2HKO back. Reflect is another option to help Articuno absorb Body Slam from Snorlax and even Rock Slide from Golem and Rhydon should it find itself paralyzed against them. It also helps Articuno win against Tauros, who needs Body Slam critical hits to win. However, it is typically only useful when your opponent's special walls are gone, as they don't care at all whether Reflect is up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Although Articuno's Blizzard is a frosty nuke and no Pokemon enjoys a freeze, there are quite a few solid counters to it. Lapras and Cloyster are some of the best Articuno counters, as they 4x resist Blizzard and can wear it down with any of their attacks. Starmie has to worry about the freeze chance, but can otherwise shrug off all of Articuno's attacks with Recover and threaten it back with any attack of its choosing. Cloyster also 4x resists Blizzard and has a ton of physical bulk, allowing it to absorb any physical attacks that Articuno might be running, then threaten either Articuno or a switch-in with Clamp, Blizzard, or Explosion. Slowbro is also a decent Pokemon to send out against Articuno one-on-one because it can paralyze it with Thunder Wave, but switching in is not recommended because it takes about 50% from two Blizzards before it even has a chance to move.</p> <p><strong>Special walls: Chansey is as good a special wall as ever, shrugging off attacks with Soft-Boiled and firing back with Thunderbolt or Seismic Toss. It also takes 37.9 - 44.6% from Hyper Beam, so it has little hope in getting the chance to use Soft-Boiled if its health is low. Alakazam can also use Thunder Wave, Recover off any damage, and spam Psychic until Articuno eventually faints, but it is 3HKOed by Blizzard, meaning it needs to be weary of switching in if paralyzed or weakened.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Though they are far from solid defensive checks to Articuno, Zapdos and Jolteon naturally outspeed it and can 2HKO it with Thunderbolt, which makes them effective offensive options to take it down if no more defensive options are available.</p> ",

It can also switch in on a predicted Earthquake from Snorlax or Tauros, dealing heavy damage with Blizzard and hopefully causing a freeze. Rhydon and Golem are a bit harder to switch in on, as Rock Slide will KO Articuno, but if you are fortunate enough to switch in on Earthquake, Blizzard will OHKO either. Double-Edge does chip damage to Lapras, who laughs at a 4x resisted Blizzard, as well as Starmie. Don't use Double-Edge against Chansey though, as it only does 5% more than Blizzard, causes recoil, and does not have a freeze chance. Don't use Agility until the late-game, when the remains of your opponent's team are within KO range. Finally, Hyper Beam is there to finish off weakened Chansey and Alakazam.</p> <p>Ice Beam is a viable alternative over Double-Edge for a 99.6% accurate STAB, but it is significantly weaker than Blizzard and further weakens Articuno against Lapras and Starmie. Rest is great for recovering from status, allowing Articuno to act as a status sponge throughout the battle until you need it again. Another interesting option Articuno has is Sky Attack, which is its most powerful physical attack, possessing a huge 210 Base Power after STAB. With a critical hit, it is guaranteed to OHKO Chansey and has a 52% chance to OHKO Starmie; without a critical hit, it has a 46% chance to OHKO Alakazam, who would normally be 3HKOed by Blizzard. However, it forces you to lose an entire turn and is difficult to find a slot for.</p> "

It is an incredible late-game sweeper, being a mixed attacker on top of having access to Agility. However, Rhydon and Golem hinder Zapdos's effectiveness. While they do take slight chip damage from Drill Peck, they can't be hit by any of Zapdos's other moves and must be dealt with by the rest of the team. Due to this, Zapdos generally requires minor support to work effectively in all matchups, keeping it from being considered one of the best Pokemon in the metagame.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rest is an option for Zapdos to get some HP back, but you'll rarely ever get the chance to use it. Generally, Zapdos should be attacking or use Thunder Wave anyway; there's not a lot of room to put it on the set, as you lose out on either a pivotal attack, the ability to consistently paralyze opposing Pokemon, or the ability to pull off a late-game sweep. Thunder is usable to OHKO Starmie and to 2HKO Tauros and Slowbro, but it is not as used due to its poor accuracy. Toxic is a nice option in order to pressure the Rock-types, but this is generally not worth using over other moves. Final options for Zapdos are Reflect and Light Screen. Generally you would choose one over the other and replace Agility. Having Reflect or Light Screen up mid-game can be incredibly useful; however, due to Zapdos's lack of recovery without Rest, which is already noted to be unreliable, this option is generally not favored. The combination of Rest and Reflect can also be good at letting Zapdos check the Rock-type Pokemon that it usually loses to, but it risks taking a potential critical hit from Rock Slide.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: The Ground-types of the metagame, Rhydon and Golem, are Zapdos's biggest threats to deal with. They soak up any attack Zapdos has to offer, which forces you to play around them before Zapdos can be effective. One can scout early-game for these Pokemon, but if you spend the whole game trying to play around them, you may find yourself in a pickle by late-game.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types like Jolteon can also make good checks to Zapdos, although unlike the above Ground-types, they are susceptible to Thunder Wave. Jolteon would preferably use Rest to better check Zapdos, but ones without Rest work as well. Zapdos itself gets a special mention because it can come in on a Drill Peck to create an even matchup. Despite this, it is still worse than Jolteon as a check, as it is neutral to Thunderbolt damage which should be noted is unable to paralyze Electric-types making it a bit harder for Zapdos to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey can act as a good check to Zapdos thanks to its high Special Defense and access to Reflect, but it is generally unfavorable as a check due to the tendency of Drill Peck landing a critical hit.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Thunderbolt and Drill Peck are Zapdos's STAB moves. Zapdos hits most targets for strong damage, comfortably 3HKOing Tauros and threatening 3HKOs on Snorlax and Alakazam. However, it should be noted that Thunderbolt cannot paralyze other Electric-types. Drill Peck hits two of the main Pokemon that tank Thunderbolt, Exeggutor and Chansey. Exeggutor is sometimes 2HKOed by Drill Peck, and while Chansey can take two Drill Pecks comfortably, it tends to lose to repeated Drill Pecks, as it can't hit Zapdos very hard, and a single critical hit or full paralysis tends to end the fight in Zapdos's favor. However, Chansey does have access to Reflect to increase its chances of winning the matchup. Thunder Wave is used to paralyze Pokemon such as Tauros and Chansey to give openings for Zapdos to sweep late-game or get a chance to prevent recovery to get an extra turn of damage. Agility can be used on a free turn to allow Zapdos to outspeed faster threats like Alakazam and Tauros. It can also be used to remove the Speed drop from paralysis, which can allow Zapdos to sweep through Pokemon that would otherwise revenge kill it.</p> <p>In general, you want to keep Zapdos as healthy as possible throughout the match in order to give it sweeping potential. However, this doesn't mean that you should keep it in the back the whole game, as it has a lot of potential to be useful in the early- and mid-game stages. For example, Zapdos can take advantage of sleeping Pokemon such as Snorlax as long as it comes in on the turn the Pokemon uses Rest. One should try to use Zapdos to spread status through Thunder Wave. This is especially helpful to do on a Pokemon like Chansey, which can be prevented from recovering through status, allowing Zapdos to potentially 3HKO with Drill Peck. Early-game, be sure to scout for the Ground-types of the tier, Rhydon and Golem. Do this with Pokemon like Exeggutor, Tauros, Cloyster, and Lapras, which can pressure them through super effective or status moves. Tauros is probably the best example there, as it has a great matchup versus Exeggutor, Snorlax, Chansey, and Tauros, as well as being a great late-game cleaner on top of that. You could also lure them out with Zapdos itself, which can be done fairly early on, putting you at an information advantage. Whether or not you manage to find a Rock-type, though, you should keep Rock-type checks like Exeggutor and Lapras healthy so they better check them if they come out later in the match. Don't use Agility unless most Pokemon on the opposing team are weakened enough for Zapdos to sweep. To give a reference frame, you should probably wait until Pokemon like Snorlax and Chansey have about a third of their health left. However, if they Rest, you can take advantage of them earlier.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Moltres stands out as the strongest special attacker in RBY OU, tied with Articuno. It shares a lot of strengths and weaknesses with the other legendary bird: Moltres can also 2HKO Tauros and threaten Snorlax significantly while nailing Exeggutor and having Agility to clean up late-game. However, it too has a hard time breaking through very common special walls such as Starmie and Chansey, which holds it back tremendously. Should these walls be incapacitated or removed, Moltres can wreak havoc and make great use of its titanic Special stat.</p> <p>Due to these shared traits with Articuno, it is worth analyzing where they differ to understand which fits your team best. Moltres has access to Fire Spin in tandem with higher Attack, giving it a stronger Hyper Beam. These two qualities allow Moltres to muscle through checks like Starmie and Chansey more effectively than Articuno, especially when these Pokemon have been paralyzed and chipped beforehand. Moltres also possesses no hard walls: while Articuno really struggles against Lapras and Cloyster, there aren't any Pokemon that shut down Moltres quite so hard. However, Moltres's lower physical bulk and a weakness to Ice make it considerably easier to take down. Additionally, the type chart is unkind to Fire-type attacks in RBY, making Moltres considerably weaker in various matchups compared to Articuno, such as Zapdos and especially Rhydon. Furthermore, Fire Spin's accuracy makes it very unreliable; Fire Blast also suffers from this problem to a lesser degree. Overall, Moltres is a phenomenal late-game threat, despite being niche overall, as the ability to beat Tauros one-on-one is of crucial importance; while supporting it can be difficult, this Pokemon remains a sweeping threat that can tear down passive builds.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Moltres possesses a few other viable moves, but they are all hard to justify in most cases. Double-Edge gives it a strong move to hit Chansey on the switch, and to a lesser extent Starmie, which might make its job of taking down these checks a little easier, though you will usually be content to source your extra damage from an additional Fire Spin. Sky Attack hits for over 50% on both Starmie and Chansey, threatening to OHKO on a critical hit, but it requires good prediction to get away with the charge turn. Toxic allows Moltres to functionally empower its own Fire Spin without needing to land a Fire Blast burn, which helps with working around Chansey as long as Moltres can chain enough Fire Spins without missing.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Starmie and Slowbro stop Moltres dead in its tracks thanks to their great special bulk and lack of concern for burns, which allows them to switch into Fire Blast frequently. Starmie is particularly brutal, being faster and threatening hefty damage with any of Blizzard, Thunderbolt, or Surf, or even paralysis from Thunder Wave. Slowbro can use Moltres as setup fodder after paralyzing it, usually forcing it to try and pivot out with Fire Spin as to not give it a free Amnesia boost, though it needs to be wary when burned, as Fire Spin chains can rapidly rack up sufficient residual damage for Moltres to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey can put a hard stop to Moltres thanks to its gargantuan Special bulk; however, Moltres outspeeds it and can therefore stop it from recovering with Fire Spin. Therefore, it can muscle through Chansey with some luck, especially with a Fire Blast burn alongside Fire Spin, as Hyper Beam hits for over 40%. However, this can be quite risky for Moltres, as a miss lets Chansey cripple its late-game with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Zapdos</strong>: While neither is particularly willing to take a Fire Blast, both Jolteon and Zapdos outspeed Moltres while 2HKOing it with STAB Thunderbolt. However, Moltres can beat a chipped or resting Jolteon, having a good shot at 2HKOing it with Fire Blast + Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: While it looks enticing to switch Rhydon in on Fire Blast, its pathetic Special makes it take surprisingly high damage; there is even a chance of a 3HKO. Additionally, being burned is an utter death sentence for Rhydon, making it little more than fodder in the long run. However, Rhydon is otherwise one of the better Moltres checks, absorbing Hyper Beam well and PP stalling Fire Spin better than most OU staples, all while having an OHKO against it in Rock Slide; if it drops Rock Slide in favor of Rest, it gives up the OHKO, but it gains the ability to heal off the burns and can stall Moltres out of Fire Blasts, which is just as good.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Fire Blast is the main draw to Moltres. It threatens significant damage to a majority of the tier, including notable 2HKOs on Tauros, Exeggutor, and Cloyster, and has a nice 30.1% burn chance that forces sturdier physical attackers such as Snorlax and Rhydon to tread very carefully around Moltres. However, much like most special attackers in RBY OU, it must contend with the existence of Chansey and Starmie. These two Pokemon can comfortably heal off all damage taken by Fire Blast, and due to Fire Blast only having 8 PP, Moltres usually doesn't want to waste any on Pokemon that can just shrug it off; furthermore, landing a burn on these Pokemon can sometimes be counterproductive, as it removes the option of paralyzing them. Moltres packs a relatively powerful Hyper Beam to help it deal with special walls, thankfully; in tandem with a Fire Blast, it can hit both Chansey and Starmie for over 60% of their HP over two turns, meaning that, if such walls have been weakened, it stands a good chance of finishing the job. Agility is extremely helpful to ignore the Speed drop from paralysis and gain the upper hand on other fast late-game Pokemon such as Tauros and Zapdos; it is especially powerful in combination with Fire Spin, as a fast partial trapping move completely shuts down the opponent's ability to attack as long as it doesn't miss. Fire Spin excels when the opposition has been statused; it has great synergy with paralysis, which enables Moltres to move faster than any foe even without setting up Agility, and with burn, as repeatedly stopping the foe from moving racks up burn damage.</p> <p>Moltres's specialty is cleanup. If you are running Moltres, you ought to spend the early-game trying to cripple, chip, and potentially even remove the opposing Chansey and Starmie. Moltres is very unconventional in that it doesn't synergize particularly well with the two most powerful statuses in RBY, freeze and sleep. Fire Blast will thaw frozen opponents, and Fire Spin provides sleeping enemies with opportunities to wake while only taking minimal damage per turn. This means Moltres needs a very deliberate plan early-game and beyond to weaken checks and make your opponent play into your hand, especially against Starmie. Many teams are willing to let Starmie absorb sleep early-game, which is great for other Pokemon that struggle with it, like Articuno and Slowbro, but Moltres's resisted Fire Spin is the perfect opportunity for Starmie to burn sleep turns. You might want to try luring your opponent into letting you sleep a different Pokemon, even forgoing sleep altogether if you are feeling creative, or hoping sleeping Starmie falls victim to players' willingness to sacrifice sleeping Pokemon. Similarly, it won't be much use gambling your early-game trying to freeze a Chansey.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Moltres is an unusual Pokemon in RBY UU. It has downright incredible base stats, boasting the second-highest total of any Pokemon outside of Ubers. Its Fire Blast is enormously strong, unsurpassed by any other unboosted special move in the game. Because of these traits, Moltres spent much of its history banned and was considered a top choice once it was finally released to the tier. Given its behemoth offensive prowess and the success its sibling Articuno had, one would be forgiven for assuming Moltres would be a staple in the tier.</p> <p>Moltres, however, is not a staple in RBY UU by any account. The tier is infested with Water-type Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Omastar, and UU king Tentacruel, which creates a very hostile environment for Moltres. Another major flaw is how heavily Articuno outclasses it. As a special attacker, Moltres is nearly strictly worse than Articuno, as several prominent Pokemon in the tier resist Fire but not Ice; thus, the true strength of Moltres's nuclear Fire Blast is seldom realized. Examples include Dragonite, Gyarados, Aerodactyl, and Golem. Somewhat humorously, the only major Pokemon that Moltres has an edge against relative to Articuno is Articuno itself. Being a Fire-type Pokemon isn’t doing Moltres any defensive favors either. Articuno has a much better chance at muscling through Water-type checks, as it can endure their attacks while it hunts for a critical hit or freeze. Moltres, on the other hand, will likely get 2HKOed by Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar, meaning it is afforded no extra turns to try to get lucky. Failing to resist Ice also leaves it more vulnerable to attackers like Gyarados. Considering the ubiquity of Water-type Pokemon and how everything that checks Articuno also checks Moltres, basically every well composed RBY UU team is incidentally prepared to face Moltres.</p> <p>Moltres is just barely able to scrounge a niche in RBY UU, being able to do one of two things for a team. Firstly, it can be a supplement to Articuno to create a strong special attacking core. Against neutral targets, Moltres's Fire Blast boasts impressive damage output, 2HKOing most neutral targets. Alternatively, Moltres can try to slowly rack up damage and possibly even sweep with AgiliSpin, much like Dragonite with Wrap. While both approaches to Moltres are viable, they have their issues. A Moltres and Articuno core still needs a lot of support, as the two share many checks. Fire Spin Moltres is a suboptimal partial trapper relative to staples like Dragonite due to the move's lower accuracy, PP, and damage output.</p> ",

Tentacruel outspeeds Moltres and can use Wrap to weaken it or just cleanly 2HKO it with Surf. Vaporeon is slower but can take Moltres’s attacks more comfortably while still scoring a 2HKO. Poliwrath behaves similarly, but it can only potentially 2HKO Moltres if it has Hydro Pump. Thanks to its typing, Omastar is the best counter to Moltres; even if Moltres scores a critical hit with every attack, Omastar can safely use Rest and wall it indefinitely. Omastar will always 2HKO Moltres with Surf as well. Gyarados can take Moltres’s hits fairly comfortably and score a 2HKO with Hydro Pump or a 3HKO with Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Golem takes relatively little from Moltres’s moves. It is very likely to OHKO Moltres with Rock Slide, making Moltres very hesitant to pivot out with Fire Spin; this essentially gives Golem a free turn to use a powerful STAB attack or Substitute. Golem also punishes Hyper Beam exceptionally well, scoring a virtually guaranteed OHKO in response. Aerodactyl doesn’t have many good offensive options for Moltres, but it can take a few hits and apply pressure with Double-Edge, especially if it can land a few critical hits. Neither Golem nor Aerodactyl handles a burn well, however.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite: Moltres can, at best, 4HKO Dragonite, but it will likely require even more turns to KO it. Dragonite, on the other hand, can 3HKO with Blizzard, stymie Moltres's offensive ability with Thunder Wave, or attempt to use Agility and sweep with Wrap. Dragonite's ability to sweep is threatened by Fire Blast's burn chance, but Dragonite is still very likely to win the matchup thanks to its wide array of strong special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio has no business switching into Moltres and despises burn, but it survives a Fire Blast and can 2HKO Moltres with Rock Slide. Thanks to its high critical hit rate, Dugtrio is liable to OHKO Moltres as well, making Moltres fearful even if it is at full health and has used Agility.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Moltres’s Fire Blast ties with Articuno’s Blizzard as the strongest unboosted special move in the tier. While more Pokemon resist Fire Blast than Blizzard, the move still deals massive damage to the right targets; it 3HKOes Hypno and 2HKOes Kangaskhan, Persian, Dodrio, Dugtrio, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Venusaur. Fire Blast actually outperforms Blizzard against a select few — albeit uncommon — Pokemon as well, including Dewgong, Pinsir, and Venomoth. It also comes with a nasty 30.1% chance to burn, which keeps some would-be checks, like Tentacruel and Dragonite, somewhat hesitant to face Moltres. While not quite as lethal as a freeze, a burn can completely incapacitate pretty much every physical attacker outside of Persian. A burn on a partial trapper like Tentacruel can force it to use Rest much earlier than usual, as the passive damage will build up if it tries to use Wrap or Bind. However, due to Fire Blast's poor accuracy and UU's many Water-types, running out of PP is a genuine possibility. Additionally, a single miss can ruin Moltres, as it leaves it vulnerable to being paralyzed or KOed. As such, Moltres must use it wisely.</p> <p>Moltres's surprisingly high Attack stat makes its Hyper Beam and Double-Edge remarkably strong. Because of the extra damage output from its physical attacks, Moltres can use Agility and attempt to sweep even sooner than Articuno in some cases. For example, Tentacruel and Kadabra must be at or below 35% and 65% health, respectively, for Articuno to secure a sweep with Hyper Beam. For Moltres, these Pokemon can be at 38.5% and 72% health. The difference is minor, but it can be important in a metagame where many Pokemon lose health in increments of roughly 3% to Tentacruel’s Wrap.</p> <p>Fire Spin is more versatile than Double-Edge, enabling it to chip weakened foes into KO range of Fire Blast or Hyper Beam. The move can also immobilize, slowly whittle down, and potentially sweep the opposing team, especially if Moltres has managed to use Agility. Fire Spin also gives Moltres an option against Dragonite; it can use the move and switch out to something that can prevent Dragonite from setting up its potentially game-ending Agility. Compared to Dragonite's Wrap, Moltres's Fire Spin has lower accuracy and PP but has the benefit of damaging Haunter. Alternatively, Double-Edge provides Moltres with a consistent attack with perfect accuracy, a lot of PP, and few drawbacks. This greatly aids in Moltres’s sweeping, allowing it to take out weakened targets with little risk. Note that Articuno almost completely outclasses Moltres running Double-Edge, so Articuno should generally be run alongside Moltres if this set is chosen. Essentially, Fire Spin is for sweeping sooner, while Double-Edge is for sweeping reliably. Agility makes Moltres faster than the entire unboosted metagame and therefore less fearful of Pokemon like Tentacruel, Kadabra, Electabuzz, and Raichu while letting it attempt to sweep or wallbreak.</p> <p>Moltres requires quite a lot of support to function. Pokemon that can apply pressure to Water-type Pokemon, such as Electabuzz, Raichu, and Venusaur, are good partners. Physical attackers like Persian and Kangaskhan can also work with Moltres on hyper offense builds. Together, they can form mixed attacking cores that few teams can handle. Users of sleep inducing moves like Hypno, Tangela, and the aforementioned Venusaur provide Moltres with a setup opportunity. If Moltres is being used alongside Articuno, much of the same support is required, though to an even greater extent. Fast Pokemon like Kadabra and Dugtrio are also good partners, as the core is relatively slow and liable to be smothered by Tentacruel.</p> "

    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Although Dragonair isn't fully evolved, it is still able to scrounge itself a niche in RBY UU because of its access to the deadly combination of Agility and Wrap. Thanks to RBY Wrap mechanics, Dragonair can immobilize Pokemon and deal large amounts of chip damage. Dragonair's access to Agility allows it to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon and use Wrap freely until it misses or runs out of PP. This allows it to act as a deadly setup sweeper in certain scenarios, or to weaken the opposing team to the point where its teammates, such as Dugtrio and Persian, can finish the job. Additionally, Dragonair is really good at gaining information about the opposing team because it is often best dealt with by switching between Pokemon to PP stall Wrap. This simplifies the endgame because you are less likely to be surprised by an unexpected threat.</p> <p>However, Dragonair faces a few key problems. It notably competes with its fully evolved counterpart Dragonite, which has better stats and a Ground-type immunity. On the flip side, Dragonite's Flying typing causes it to take extra damage from Ice-type attacks when compared to Dragonair. While both Dragonite and Dragonair are in OHKO range from Articuno's Blizzard, Dragonair is able to survive a few notable Blizzards from the likes of Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar. This means that Dragonair can set up on more Pokemon than Dragonite, while also taking less punishment than Dragonite would from an unfortunate Wrap miss. However, while it does take less damage than Dragonite, Dragonair still takes heavy damage from Ice-type attacks, which is unfortunate in a tier dominated by the likes of Tentacruel and Articuno. In addition to these flaws, Dragonair also struggles in certain matchups against Pokemon that either resist or are immune to Wrap, such as Omastar, Aerodactyl, and Haunter. Haunter is especially a problem for Dragonair, as it takes mediocre damage from Blizzard and Thunderbolt while being immune to both Hyper Beam and Wrap. Also, Dragonair's stats are a fair bit lower than the tier staples, causing it to struggle offensively and defensively without AgiliWrap. Overall, while Dragonair has the potential to win games and is certainly a viable Pokemon, it is a niche threat due to its lack of defensive utility and competition with Dragonite. Ergo, Dragonair is typically used alongside Dragonite.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set allows Dragonair to play to its biggest strength in Agility + Wrap. Due to its ability to stop the opponent from using a move for the turn, Wrap acts as a pivot move, allowing Dragonair to apply offensive pressure and allow its teammates to switch in freely. Agility allows Dragonair to outspeed and threaten Pokemon such as Kadabra and Dugtrio and act as a win condition when paired with Wrap. Agility also allows Dragonair to ignore the Speed drop from paralysis, although it does not appreciate taking paralysis due to the fact that it decreases the consistency of Wrap. After setting up Agility and using Wrap, the game is simplified to a few key options that allow the Dragonair user to dictate the course of the game. The opponent can stay in on Dragonair with a singular Pokemon as Dragonair threatens to KO it after enough Wrap damage, with the goal being to capitalize on a miss in order to stop the sweep. Alternatively, the opponent can swap between multiple Pokemon in order to spread out the damage and PP stall the Dragonair user. After Dragonair has been removed from the field, perhaps due to it missing a Wrap and crumbling to a choice Blizzard or Thunder Wave, the chip damage and information obtained from Wrap will usually enable a fast sweeper to come in and close out the game. Notable Pokemon for this role include Persian, Dugtrio, Dodrio, and Kadabra. Blizzard and Hyper Beam provide decent coverage that only falters against the likes of Omastar and Haunter. Notably, Hyper Beam is able to KO the likes of Hypno and Tentacruel at around one-third of their health, which is reasonably achievable due to the large amount of chip damage that Wrap provides. This allows Dragonair to remain a threat even after it has been inflicted with paralysis or poison.</p> <p>Due to how linear Dragonair's strategy is, it is rare to find it using other moves. Thunder Wave and Body Slam can both be used to spread paralysis, t's difficult to fit either into the set due to Dragonair's need for the coverage of Blizzard and the damage of Hyper Beam. These moves can be used on the same turn the foe would use Toxic to cripple Dragonair in order to land a surprise paralysis on a potentially key Pokemon. However, these options are typically better suited for use on Dragonite, as it is able to take advantage of them more effectively due to its higher stats. Thunderbolt is a usable option to decrease Dragonair's weakness versus the occasional Omastar, but like Thunder Wave and Body Slam, it can be difficult to fit into the set, partly due to it still dealing mediocre damage against Omastar.</p> "

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragonite makes good use of Thunderbolt to hit Cloyster hard and dish out decent damage against Lapras on the switch in, both of which can scare Dragonite out with the threat of an OHKO with Blizzard. Thunder Wave can be useful against switch-ins that are typically difficult to paralyze, such as Gengar and Starmie, that Dragonite is bound to see. Body Slam blends damage with paralysis chance if you don't want to give up an attacking move for paralysis. Double-Edge is slightly stronger than Body Slam at the cost of not being able to paralyze and causing recoil damage. As finisher moves, both options have an advantage over Hyper Beam by not having to recharge if the opposing Pokemon is not KOed; the lower Base Power makes these moves unfavorable choices, however.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gengar is the chief check as it's immune to Wrap and takes a pittance from any of Dragonite's other options. It doesn't really accomplish much against Dragonite, though, but will generally outlast non-Blizzard Dragonite one-on-one in a battle between unSTAB-boosted special attacks. Powerful Blizzard users, such as Lapras, Cloyster, Articuno, and, to an extent, Jynx, can all scare Dragonite out with the threat of an OHKO. The former three are very physically bulky and will be able to take several hits before dying, which makes it all the more likely that Wrap will miss at some point. Exeggutor and especially Slowbro are also very bulky and can threaten Dragonite with paralysis, but apart from that, they won't generally be able to handle Dragonite on their own. Chansey and Starmie are resilient with their instant recovery and usually carry Ice moves that can 2HKO Dragonite. These two can also paralyze Dragonite with Thunder Wave and force it to risk full paralysis in addition to Wrap misses. Note that Dragonite can use Agility again to completely ignore the Speed reduction from paralysis and resume being faster than all of your Pokemon. On the other hand, however, as full paralysis can also occur in the middle of a Wrap sequence, paralysis will severely limit Dragonite's potential. Its often even advised to go for the guaranteed paralysis with Thunder Wave instead of using an unSTAB-boosted Ice-type attack that will not OHKO.</p> <p>Any Pokemon that has enough health to take Dragonite's Hyper Beam can switch in to this predicted finishing move to cripple or KO Dragonite. When the opposing Pokemon is in KO range from Hyper Beam, the Dragonite user is likely to use it instead of Wrap, to avoid the possibility of an untimely Wrap miss. Punishing a predicted Hyper Beam could give you the possibility of paralyzing or KOing Dragonite. However, proper prediction is required as Dragonite could continue using Wrap, which by itself still has a high success rate against the weakened opponent. Pokemon that resist Normal-type moves, such as Golem and Rhydon, might even be surprised by Surf, which will OHKO them.</p> <p>It's important to note that, if given the chance, using the turn Dragonite uses Agility to cripple it is crucial. Even if you can only land one move that won't do much to Dragonite, such as Body Slam or Psychic, it may still be very rewarding later on, as it will increase the chances of any Ice-type move OHKOing Dragonite. In addition, Body Slam might also score paralysis, which will often ruins Dragonite's ability to effectively sweep.</p> <p>If all else fails, you can try to stall it out of Wrap PP if you can count carefully to 32. Wrap is very weak and locks Dragonite into Wrap if it chooses to stay in, regardless of whether you choose to switch or stay in yourself. Thus, you can repeatedly switch out to force Dragonite to use more turns which read \"Dragonite used Wrap!\" and that therefore cost PP as opposed to the \"Its attack continues!\" turns that do not use PP. However, if you miscount and switch out after Dragonite has used its last Wrap PP, Dragonite will still be forced to use Wrap PP, but instead of forcing Dragonite to use Struggle, RBY glitches and rolls Wrap's PP counter up to 63 to allow it to use Wrap again, thereby rendering your stall for naught. This strategy works much more effectively if you have Golem or Rhydon on your team, as otherwise you will have to sacrifice at least one Pokemon before Wrap runs out of PP.</p> ",

Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to the current RBY OU metagame.</p> <hr /> <h1>Overview</h1> <p>It's got a wide attacking movepool. It's tied with Mew for the second-highest Base Stat Total in the game. It's the only fully-evolved Dragon-type in RBY, a type that sounds legendary on its own and that resists the STAB attacks of all three starter Pokemon. It's the final Pokemon used by Lance, the fourth member of the Elite Four. Clearly, Dragonite was intended to be some sort of legendary behemoth, the boss Pokemon to end all boss Pokemon, at least until the player found Mewtwo. However, in competitive usage, Dragonite is more likely to elicit groans and grimaces of irritation rather than the intended screams and wide eyes of terror. This is because Dragonite's power in OU does not derive from Hyper Beam, its massive base 134 Attack, its typing, or its diverse Special movepool. Rather, it's because of an annoying little move that its lowly first-stage evolution, Dratini, knows from the start: Wrap.</p> <p>Wrap's mechanics differ drastically in RBY compared to later generations; the move has a mere 15 Base Power, but it prevents the opposing Pokemon from making a move while the Wrap user is locked into this move for 2-5 turns. Furthermore, the immobilized opponent cannot attack even during the turn the Wrap user switches out, providing a safe entry for another Pokemon. However, unlike in other generations, the opponent might switch out the Pokemon that is incapacitated by Wrap. Dragonite is the best Wrap user in RBY because it, unlike any other RBY Wrapper, also has access to Agility to make it faster than any other Pokemon in the game. If Dragonite gets lucky and hits all of its Wraps, it can totally sweep a team without the opponent even being able to move. This sounds broken, and indeed, some RBY players play with bans on Wrap and all other moves like it (Bind, Clamp, Fire Spin) because of their potential. However, Dragonite might always miss a Wrap or two, leaving it vulnerable to getting paralyzed or shellacked by an Ice-type move. It is this unreliability that prevents Dragonite from being considered a staple of RBY OU when Wrap is allowed. When Wrap is not allowed, Dragonite is barely worth mentioning in OU due to its lack of STAB, mediocre Speed, and disastrous 4x weakness to the ubiquitous Ice Beam and Blizzard.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Here it is, possibly the most annoying set in all of Pokemon history. It's more than just annoying, however; it's absolutely deadly if luck is on your side. Agility boosts Dragonite's Speed above that of any unboosted Pokemon in the game. It then proceeds to take advantage of Wrap's debilitating mechanics by repeatedly using the move to render any switch-in unable to move, while slowly whittling away at the opposing Pokemon's health. Wrap can even be used to immobilize Gengar, which is immune to Normal-type moves, although Gengar is unlike other Wrap victims in that it does not take damage while incapacitated by Wrap. It is, however, not easy to find a good moment to use Agility, due to the prevalence of Ice-type and paralysis-inducing moves in RBY. Switching into the occasional sleeping or frozen Pokemon lets Dragonite set up Agility safely, however. Otherwise, slow Pokemon such as Golem, Rhydon, Snorlax, and Exeggutor that lack Stun Spore are good options to switch in and set up on. Taking a hit from them, however, means that Dragonite is now OHKOed by unSTAB-boosted Ice-type attacks.</p> <p>Once the opponent's Pokemon has been worn down to low enough health, Dragonite can use one of its other two attacking moves to secure the KO. Hyper Beam is generally the best option, as it is the strongest attack in Dragonite's movepool. Dragonite will usually be able to avoid Hyper Beam's incapacitating side effect as Wrap is meant to first put Pokemon in Hyper Beam's OHKO range. It lacks STAB, but comes from a base 134 Attack stat. Surf is the preferred option in the last slot as it guarantees an OHKO on the Rock / Ground types Golem and Rhydon. Blizzard can be used in its place to heavily damage Golem and Rhydon, but also to give Dragonite its best direct attack to use against Gengar. It also works as an alternative finishing move for Pokemon such as Zapdos and Exeggutor and, unlike Hyper Beam, does not force Dragonite to recharge if it does not OHKO.</p> <p>Dragonite is generally saved for a sweep and, as such, appreciates support from teammates that can spread paralysis directly. Not only does paralysis make Dragonite faster than the opponent without it having to use Agility, but a full paralysis might also save Dragonite if Wrap misses. Alakazam, Chansey, Starmie, Exeggutor, Slowbro, and Zapdos are all Pokemon that can perform that role excellently. The former options can tank hits from many threats as well, while the latter two provide more offensive pressure. The choices should depend on how offensive you want your team to be, although it should be noted that Alakazam and Slowbro are generally the best options to spread paralysis.</p> <p>In addition, Dragonite is able to do more than merely sweep with Wrap; if it gets in on a predicted switch to a slow Pokemon, such as Exeggutor, Snorlax, or Chansey, or on a predicted Earthquake from Rhydon or Golem, it can use Wrap against whatever your opponent might decide to switch in. Dragonite can then switch out to a counter, which is guaranteed to take no damage from the switch-in thanks to Wrap's immobilization effect. Dragonite's ability to act as a pivot makes it a decent mid-game partner for heavy-hitters such as Snorlax and Rhydon to let them switch in on paralyzed foes with impunity. Moreover, as Wrap can still immobilize Gengar, hard-hitters such as Snorlax, Rhydon, Golem, and Tauros also synergize well with Dragonite in this regard. If Gengar switches into Wrap, you can immediately go to a powerful sweeper without taking damage thanks to Wrap's mechanics. Earthquake will generally scare Gengar out, giving Dragonite the possibility of punishing whatever your opponent switches in.</p> "

Like any Pokemon, Mew doesn't appreciate the sleep status either.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Mew</strong>: Any Mew set with both Reflect and Soft-Boiled is a good Mew answer. Thunder Wave paralyzes Mew, and Swords Dance combined with Explosion can take both Mew out of the picture. Swords Dance-boosted attacks also attempt to KO the other Mew.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Mew without Earthquake generally lacks the means to deal any damage to Gengar, usually firing off a Thunder Wave at most.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Reflect Snorlax is particularly effective against Mew lacking Earthquake, as +6 Body Slam is only a 4HKO against Snorlax behind Reflect. Snorlax can use Rest to recover health and is immune to Body Slam paralysis. It can paralyze Mew with its own Body Slam, though, and can deal at least 74% damage with Self-Destruct—assuming Mew doesn't have Reflect's boost.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon and Golem</strong>: Both Rhydon and Golem can exploit Mew lacking Earthquake. Rhydon's Substitutes aren't broken by even a +6 Body Slam most of the time. In return, Rhydon is extremely likely to 3HKO with Earthquake, assuming Mew doesn't have Reflect up. Golem lacks the same power and bulk as Rhydon but can threaten with a 64% or more damage Explosion. Explosion's usage can be predictable though, and Golem finds Reflect Mew extremely tough to break down. Rhydon manages to dismantle Body Slam variants with Leer or stall with Substitute and Rest.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Although considered to have low viability, Articuno makes for a solid check to the typical Mew; it is immune to Earthquake, and unboosted Body Slam from Mew isn't even a guaranteed 6HKO. Blizzard 3HKOes Mew in return. Articuno can also run Reflect; unlike Snorlax, it isn't immune to Body Slam paralysis, though.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster functions similarly to Articuno, except for it not being immune to Earthquake. It notably suffers from a less-powerful Blizzard but instead has an improved Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Mew is only a match for Reflect Zapdos when fully boosted. In the meantime, Zapdos can deal a minimum of 30% damage with Thunderbolt, forcing Mew to recover, while threatening possible critical hits. Mew recovering, especially from critical hits, gives extra opportunities for Thunderbolt's 10.2% chance of inflicting paralysis—assuming Mew isn't already paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor is resistant to Earthquake and is usually only 6HKOed by Mew's Body Slam without boosts. It threatens Mew out with potential Stun Spore and Sleep Powder. It can also do 58% damage minimum to Mew with Explosion if Reflect is not up.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro can paralyze Mew with Thunder Wave or set up Reflect or Withdraw with paralysis support. Slowbro's Surf has a small chance of 2HKOing at +2 Special.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros, which is faster than Mew when not paralyzed, can take it out with enough critical hits or full paralysis triggerings. Tauros benefits from its immunity to Body Slam paralysis, though the matchup slowly reverses as Swords Dance Mew gains its Attack boosts.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: If necessary, Mewtwo can 2HKO Mew on average at +2 Special. Mew, on the other hand, only 3HKOes at +2 Attack unless it possesses Hyper Beam.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Mew's traditional aim is to set up with Swords Dance, recover from any damage via Soft-Boiled, and then attempt to sweep with its two attacks. Earthquake is generally Mew's most damaging attack, OHKOing Gengar and 2HKOing Golem and Rhydon at +2 Attack. Body Slam hits Zapdos and Exeggutor neutrally, albeit being initially weak; it also aims to paralyze targets including opposing Mew, using paralysis and damage to pressure it to recover or use Explosion. At +6 Attack, Body Slam has guaranteed 2HKOs on every Pokemon that isn't Cloyster, behind Reflect or Defense boosts, or a Rock- or Ghost-type. Hyper Beam provides a more powerful move to finish off targets besides Golem, Rhydon, or Gengar, but additional paralysis support and care to avoid being exploited by Transform Mew are advised. Another downside of Hyper Beam is the risk that +4 or +6 Attack Hyper Beam is weakened by one of Mew's 19.5% likely critical hits, which can cost it the KO and force Mew to recharge. Soft-Boiled is the choice for longevity, but often Explosion can be useful to cancel out an opposing Mew in an advantageous position.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set discovered by Golden Gyarados simultaneously performs well against opposing Mew and sets up to sweep. Thanks to Reflect, it can't be KOed by another Mew outside of a +4 Explosion—given no status, enough PP, and consistent recovery. The downside is having to choose between Body Slam or Earthquake; however, when you consider the viable Pokemon in the tier, your opponent will probably have at most two Pokemon that your chosen move cannot hit neutrally or super effectively. Body Slam is the slightly preferred choice due to it hitting Exeggutor and Zapdos, which are collectively considered more viable than Gengar and Rhydon. It also has 8 more PP, and Gengar and Rhydon can be baited into weakening themselves fighting Mew's teammates prior to revealing the set. Earthquake is usually more effective as a counter-team option because, like the traditional sweeper set, opting out of Body Slam for Earthquake means it is best to search for paralysis support. Soft-Boiled is recommended to take advantage of Reflect more.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set exists to nullify an opposing Mew. Once your Mew has landed a Thunder Wave, the opposing Mew is slowed down and vulnerable to full paralysis. Next, boost with Swords Dance so that, on any following turn, Mew is ready to take it down with Explosion. If the opposing Mew uses Reflect, boost your Mew's Attack stat all the way up to +6 if you can in order to guarantee an OHKO with Explosion. Alternatively, you can chip the opposing Mew with Body Slam or Earthquake before delivering a +4 Explosion. With enough paralysis luck, your Mew may be able to KO the opposing Mew and save its Explosion for another Pokemon. Reflect can be used in this set to stall needing to use Explosion, although, since Mew's only attack will be Explosion, it relies on your opponent not playing around it and either giving away a less valuable Pokemon or sending in Gengar, Golem, or Rhydon. This set can also function as an emergency Mewtwo check; it is only 2HKOed by 999 Special Mewtwo, so Mew can reliably paralyze Mewtwo, and it does a minimum of 63% damage with an unboosted Explosion.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set was made specifically to counter traditional Mew, especially the Hyper Beam variant, and greatly departs from the traditional sweeper set. Once in against opposing Mew, use Thunder Wave and Reflect first as it sets up Swords Dance, use Soft-Boiled if needed to stay healthy, and, finally, use Transform. This sequence makes your Mew into the traditional sweeper set with the bonus of Reflect protection and an opposing Mew that can become fully paralyzed. If you make your Mew transform before its target reaches +6, it can use Swords Dance again to both boost itself and lower its target's Speed under paralysis. The Reflect sweeper set, unfortunately, ruins it plans, stalling it out by taking advantage of Transform's 5 PP. This set will also result in a stalemate with fellow Transform Mew, possibly resulting in an endless battle. Worse yet, its lack of offensive threat means the opponent can easily switch to another Pokemon.</p> "
