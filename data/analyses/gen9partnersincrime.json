        "description": "<p>Deoxys-A is one of the most powerful special attackers in the metagame due to its monstrous Special Attack stat and blazing Speed stat. Expanding Force is the other Psychic-type move that should be used when Deoxys-A is in Psychic Terrain. Focus Blast is for Dark-types like Chien-Pao, Incineroar, and Kingambit. Due to Deoxys-A's abysmal bulk, Focus Sash ensures it can get a guaranteed move off. A Hasty nature prevents Porygon2 from getting a Special Attack boost while allowing Deoxys-A to use physical moves from partners like Incineroar and Chien-Pao. Despite Deoxys-A's high Special Attack and powerful STAB moves, it struggles to hit Gholdengo meaningfully, so Pokemon that can actively threaten it, like Incineroar, Landorus-T, and Ogerpon-H, are beneficial. Incineroar and Landorus-T also provide Deoxys-A with pivoting, while Ogerpon-H can redirect in a pinch. Tera Psychic is recommended to make Psycho Boost and Expanding Force as powerful as possible.</p> <h1>Notable Partners</h1> <p><strong>Indeedee-F</strong>: Indeedee-F is mandatory for this Deoxys-A set to shine, as it provides Psychic Terrain support, preventing priority moves such as Incineroar's Fake Out, Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch, and Dragonite's Extreme Speed from functioning, as well as boosting Deoxys-A's Expanding Force. It can also prevent Trick Room with Imprison.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Support Pokemon</strong>: Fake Out users like Incineroar, and redirectors like Amoongus and Ogerpon-W are good partners, as they allow Deoxys-A to stay on the field for longer.</p> <p><strong>Haze Users</strong>: Haze users such as Chien-Pao and Volcanion are useful teammates due to their ability to clear stat changes, allowing Deoxys-A to function properly as a breaker.</p> <p><strong>Pivoting</strong>: Due to Deoxys-A terrible bulk, it cannot switch into anything. Therefore, pivoting from the likes of bulky Landorus-T and Incineroar are appreciated.</p>"

Extreme Speed in conjunction with its ridiculous Attack makes it an attacker that can avoid priority attacks like Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch and Raging Bolt's Thunderclap. Superpower can be used to cover Dark-type threats like Chien-Pao and Kingambit. Focus Sash is required due to Deoxys-A's horrible bulk,and a Hasty nature prevents Porygon2's Download from giving it a Special Attack boost. Tera Stellar is the recommended Tera type, due to the plethora of coverage moves this set runs. Deoxys-A cannot damage Gholdengo very well, so Pokemon like Incineroar and Chien-Pao are recommended.</p> <h1>Notable Partners</h1> <p><strong>Priority Attackers</strong>: Pokemon that commonly use priority moves, such as Dragonite, Rillaboom, and Raging Bolt are good teammates, as they can form a priority spam core that can clean up foes very easily. Rillaboom deserves a special mention due to Grassy Surge removing Psychic Terrain from Indeedee.</p> <p><strong>Haze Users</strong>: Haze users like Volcanion and Chien-Pao are good teammates since they can erase the stat drops from Psycho Boost, Superpower, and Incineroar and Landorus-T's Intimidate. Chien-Pao also forms a priority spam core with Deoxys-A.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Support Pokemon</strong>: Fake Out users like Incineroar and redirectors like Sinistcha and Ogerpon-W are good partners, as they can circumvent Deoxys-A's frailty.</p> <p><strong>Pivoting</strong>: Due to Deoxys-A's terrible bulk, it cannot switch into anything.

With its bulk, it can redirect and absorb various hits by using Rage Powder, as well as threatening to debilitate foes with Spore. Pollen Puff heals Amoonguss's ally even under the effects of Taunt, and Clear Smog negates attempts to set up against Amoonguss. Protect can be used over Clear Smog if Amoonguss's team has ample ways of beating setup Pokemon or does not have enough protection moves to share. Sitrus Berry is best for aiding in Amoonguss's longevity, allowing it to take more hits while redirecting attacks or spreading sleep. The EV spread allows it to survive two uses of Bleakwind Storm from Timid Tornadus with Sitrus Berry, and 28 Speed IVs allow it to underspeed base 50 Speed Pokemon with minimum investment such as Kingambit and Iron Hands. Unfortunately, Amoonguss struggles against opposing Grass-types and Gholdengo because of their immunity to Spore, so teammates like Heatran and Landorus-T are welcome to prevent Gholdengo from being on the battlefield. Amoonguss also struggles against Pokemon with Safety Goggles, so it appreciates Pokemon like Incineroar that can remove said item with Knock Off to help improve Spore's utility. Tera Water allows Amoonguss to resist Fire- and Ice-type attacks from Chien-Pao and Incineroar while preserving its resistance against Water-type attacks, while Tera Dark gives it an immunity to Psychic-type attacks from Pokemon like Deoxys-A and provides an immunity to Prankster-boosted moves, most importantly Taunt from Tornadus.</p> <h1>Notable Partners</h1> <p><strong>Fast Pokemon or Pokemon With Prankster</strong>: While Amoonguss is very slow, Prankster Pokemon such as Tornadus and Grimmsnarl solve this issue by allowing themselves and Amoonguss to have a Prankster-boosted Spore. Fast Pokemon such as Chien-Pao also appreciate being able to use Spore against slower Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Other Defensive Utility Pokemon</strong>: Amoonguss is a good fit on bulkier teams thanks to giving its ally Regenerator and Clear Smog. Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Incineroar appreciate Amoonguss's ability to give them Regenerator, greatly increasing their longevity, and in return, they give Amoonguss more utility moves in order to be less passive.</p> <p><strong>Setup Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Iron Hands and Gholdengo appreciate Amoonguss's ability to redirect attacks so they can set up safely. Furthermore, Swords Dance Ogerpon-H has Mold Breaker, giving Amoonguss the ability to use Spore on Gholdengo.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room Setters</strong>: Trick Room setters like Diancie or Porygon2 allow Amoonguss's poor Speed stat to shine, giving themselves and Amoonguss the chance to use Spore on both of the opposing Pokemon.

The given EV spread allows Tornadus to live a Psycho Boost from Deoxys-A, and the remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack. Covert Cloak is used to nullify the flinching effect of Fake Out, allowing Tornadus to set up Tailwind without worrying about foes such as Incineroar and Iron Hands stopping it. Alternatively, Tera Ghost can be used for a similar effect, additionally granting Tornadus immunity to Extreme Speed from foes such as Dragonite and Entei. If Tera Ghost is used, Sitrus Berry should be used to increase Tornadus's survivability. Tera Steel provides Tornadus with a resistance to Rock-type coverage, such as Rock Slide from foes like Tyranitar and Landorus-T. Tornadus struggles against Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Raging Bolt, as they resist Bleakwind Storm and can threaten back with massive damage, so Ground-types like both Landorus formes can help. Weather-setting moves like Rain Dance and Sunny Day are options over Protect on weather teams, ensuring weather can stay up.</p> <h1>Notable Partners</h1> <p><strong>Offensive Threats</strong>: Generally strong offensive Pokemon appreciate Tornadus's ability to set Tailwind, as offensive teams can make use of Tailwind the best.

Roar can be used as an alternative to Haze that's especially good on more defensive and entry hazard stack teams that Volcanion fits well on. Leftovers allows Volcanion to slowly heal itself, making it harder for it to be overwhelmed. Heavy-Duty Boots removes Volcanion's weakness to Stealth Rock, particularly benefiting more defensive teams, as it is harder for them prevent entry hazards from being set up, as well as helping Volcanion to pivot around more easily. Ability Shield is an alternative option that allows Volcanion to keep its Water-type immunity against teams with a Mold Breaker user. If Volcanion is being used on a team with Tailwind, then using 108 Speed EVs is recommended, as this allows it to outspeed Chien-Pao in Tailwind. Volcanion struggles with strong attackers such as Deoxys-A, Landorus, and Raging Bolt due to its middling Speed allowing it to be overwhelmed easily. Tera Fairy is used as an all-round good defensive typing, giving useful resistances to moves such as Chien-Pao's Dark-type coverage and Dragon-type coverage from Pokemon like Walking Wake, Latios, and Kingdra. However, Tera Fairy can leave Volcanion vulnerable to foes such as Gholdengo. Tera Ground is an alternative option that turns Volcanion's weakness to Electric-type moves from foes like Raging Bolt and Iron Hands into an immunity while also powering up its Earth Power.

Make It Rain is Gholdengo's standout move as an exceptionally high-powered spread attack, taking down the likes of Chien-Pao and Glimmora easily as well as Rillaboom at +2. Shadow Ball pressures other Ghost-types such as Sinistcha and opposing Gholdengo effectively while also hitting Steel-resistant foes such as Ogerpon-H well. Gholdengo can choose to run Recover in lieu of Protect if the rest of the team can provide the latter, making it incredibly hard to remove.

Dazzling Gleam is one of the best coverage options for Gholdengo, allowing it to deal significant damage to the plethora of Dragon-types in the metagame such as Raging Bolt and Walking Wake. Thunderbolt and Power Gem are alternative coverage options that improve Gholdengo's chances against Volcanion and Incineroar. Trick is an option that disrupts Trick Room setters such as Porygon2 as well as setup attackers like Iron Hands.
