        "description": "<p>Amoonguss serves as the tier's prime disruptor thanks to its various powerful support moves alongside Regenerator, which can also be used by its ally to regain HP upon switching out. With its bulk, it can redirect and absorb various hits by using Rage Powder, as well as threatening to debilitate foes with Spore. Pollen Puff heals Amoonguss's ally even under the effects of Taunt, and Clear Smog negates attempts to set up against Amoonguss. Protect can be used over Clear Smog if Amoonguss's team has ample ways of beating setup Pokemon or does not have enough protection moves to share. Sitrus Berry is best for aiding in Amoonguss's longevity, allowing it to take more hits while redirecting attacks or spreading sleep. The EV spread allows it to survive two uses of Bleakwind Storm from Timid Tornadus with Sitrus Berry, and 28 Speed IVs allow it to underspeed base 50 Speed Pokemon with minimum investment such as Kingambit and Iron Hands. Unfortunately, Amoonguss struggles against opposing Grass-types and Gholdengo because of their immunity to Spore, so teammates like Heatran and Landorus-T are welcome to prevent Gholdengo from being on the battlefield. Amoonguss also struggles against Pokemon with Safety Goggles, so it appreciates Pokemon like Incineroar that can remove said item with Knock Off to help improve Spore's utility. Tera Water allows Amoonguss to resist Fire- and Ice-type attacks from Chien-Pao and Incineroar while preserving its resistance against Water-type attacks, while Tera Dark gives it an immunity to Psychic-type attacks from Pokemon like Hoopa-U and provides an immunity to Prankster-boosted moves, most importantly Taunt from Tornadus.</p> <h4>Notable Partners</h4> <p><strong>Fast Pokemon or Pokemon With Prankster</strong>: While Amoonguss is very slow, Prankster Pokemon such as Tornadus and Grimmsnarl solve this issue by allowing themselves and Amoonguss to have a Prankster-boosted Spore. Fast Pokemon such as Chien-Pao also appreciate being able to use Spore against slower Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Other Defensive Utility Pokemon</strong>: Amoonguss is a good fit on bulkier teams thanks to giving its ally Regenerator and Clear Smog. Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Incineroar appreciate Amoonguss's ability to give them Regenerator, greatly increasing their longevity, and in return, they give Amoonguss more utility moves in order to be less passive.</p> <p><strong>Setup Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Iron Hands and Gholdengo appreciate Amoonguss's ability to redirect attacks so they can set up safely. Furthermore, Swords Dance Ogerpon-H has Mold Breaker, giving Amoonguss the ability to use Spore on Gholdengo.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room Setters</strong>: Trick Room setters like Diancie or Porygon2 allow Amoonguss's poor Speed stat to shine, giving themselves and Amoonguss the chance to use Spore on both of the opposing Pokemon. These Pokemon also appreciate Amoonguss being able to redirect certain attacks to ensure Trick Room is set.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Tornadus is one of the tier's best support Pokemon, providing crucial speed control with Prankster-boosted Tailwind while still having respectable damage output with Bleakwind Storm. Taunt allows Tornadus to shut down foes like Amoonguss and prevent Pokemon like Porygon2 from setting Trick Room. The given EV spread allows Tornadus to live a Psycho Boost from Deoxys-A, and the remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack. Covert Cloak is used to nullify the flinching effect of Fake Out, allowing Tornadus to set up Tailwind without worrying about foes such as Incineroar and Iron Hands stopping it. Alternatively, Tera Ghost can be used for a similar effect, additionally granting Tornadus immunity to Extreme Speed from foes such as Dragonite and Entei. If Tera Ghost is used, Sitrus Berry should be used to increase Tornadus's survivability. Tera Steel provides Tornadus with a resistance to Rock-type coverage, such as Rock Slide from foes like Tyranitar and Landorus-T. Tornadus struggles against Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Raging Bolt, as they resist Bleakwind Storm and can threaten back with massive damage, so Ground-types like both Landorus formes can help. Weather-setting moves like Rain Dance and Sunny Day are options over Protect on weather teams, ensuring weather can stay up.</p> <h4>Notable Partners</h4> <p><strong>Offensive Threats</strong>: Generally strong offensive Pokemon appreciate Tornadus's ability to set Tailwind, as offensive teams can make use of Tailwind the best. Additionally, offensive teams appreciate the chip damage that Tornadus deals with Bleakwind Storm, and the prevention of Trick Room with Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Support Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that appreciate Prankster like Amoonguss are good partners for Tornadus due to it helping them fulfill their role as support Pokemon better, such as giving Amoonguss’s Spore priority.</p> <p><strong>Water-, Electric-, and Ground-types</strong>: Teammates like Ogerpon-W, Iron Hands, and both Landorus formes appreciate Tornadus’s ability to threaten the many common Grass-type foes such as Amoonguss, Rillaboom, Ogerpon-W, and Sinistcha, with Landorus in particular benefitting from being able to use Bleakwind Storm.</p>"

Taunt can stop Incineroar's Parting Shot and Amoongus's Spore, setup sweepers like Iron Hands and Ogerpon-W, and Trick Room users like Diancie and Porygon2. Sitrus Berry increases Landorus-T's longevity, while Safety Goggles helps against Spore. The given EV spread lets Landorus-T survive Freeze-Dry from Choice Specs Iron Bundle after Terastallizing and a +2 Dragon Pulse from Raging Bolt. Landorus-T struggles against super effective moves from Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Ogerpon-W, and Walking Wake without Terastallizing. Tera Water removes Landorus-T's Ice weakness, which can be helpful against Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle. Tera Grass is an alternative that can help against Water-types like Ogerpon-W and let Landorus-T ignore Sleep Powder and Rage Powder from Hisuian Lilligant and Sinistcha, respectively.</p> <h4>Notable Partners</h4> <p><strong>Other Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Other defensive Pokemon like Incineroar, Tornadus, and Amoonguss can be good teammates for Landorus-T, as they form good defensive backbones with it. Additionally, Incineroar makes a double Intimidate core, which neutralizes most physical attackers, with Landorus-T; Tornadus provides Prankster-boosted Stealth Rock and speed control with Tailwind; and Amoonguss shares Regenerator. <strong>Bulky Setup Pokemon</strong>: Bulky setup Pokemon such as Nasty Plot Gholdengo and Dragon Dance Dragonite appreciate the presence of Landorus-T, as it can help increase their survivability with Intimidate and help them secure KOs with entry hazards.</p>"

Haze lets Volcanion remove stat boosts from foes such as Gholdengo and Iron Hands, while Earth Power hits foes such as Iron Hands and Archaludon. Roar can be used as an alternative to Haze that's especially good on more defensive and entry hazard stack teams that Volcanion fits well on. Leftovers allows Volcanion to slowly heal itself, making it harder for it to be overwhelmed. Heavy-Duty Boots removes Volcanion's weakness to Stealth Rock, particularly benefiting more defensive teams, as it is harder for them prevent entry hazards from being set up, as well as helping Volcanion to pivot around more easily. Ability Shield is an alternative option that allows Volcanion to keep its Water-type immunity against teams with a Mold Breaker user. If Volcanion is being used on a team with Tailwind, then using 108 Speed EVs is recommended, as this allows it to outspeed Chien-Pao in Tailwind. Volcanion struggles with strong attackers such as Landorus and Raging Bolt due to its middling Speed allowing it to be overwhelmed easily. Tera Fairy is used as an all-round good defensive typing, giving useful resistances to moves such as Chien-Pao's Dark-type coverage and Dragon-type coverage from Pokemon like Walking Wake, Latios, and Kingdra. However, Tera Fairy can leave Volcanion vulnerable to foes such as Gholdengo. Tera Ground is an alternative option that turns Volcanion's weakness to Electric-type moves from foes like Raging Bolt and Iron Hands into an immunity while also powering up its Earth Power. In a pinch, Volcanion can support its ally by targeting it with Steam Eruption, healing it due to Water Absorb.</p> <h4>Notable Partners</h4> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and both Landorus formes are great partners for Volcanion, as it can protect them from Water-type attacks with Water Absorb. Additionally, Ting-Lu and Landorus-T increase Volcanion's bulk with their abilities, while Landorus increases the power of Volcanion's attacks with Sheer Force, and Volcanion gives it Fire- and Water-type coverage in return. These Ground-types also are very strong against Electric-type foes such as Raging Bolt and Iron Hands that Volcanion struggles with.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Physical attackers like Rillaboom and Chien-Pao appreciate Volcanion being strong against Incineroar. The two examples given are also strong against the Ground-type foes such as Landorus and Landorus-T that threaten Volcanion.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Setters</strong>: Volcanion appreciates teammates such as Mew, Ting-Lu, and Deoxys-D that can set entry hazards, as they can help chip down foes into range of Volcanion's attacks and take advantage of Pokemon trying to pivot around Volcanion. Additionally, entry hazards can force damage onto any foes that are forced to switch in due to Roar.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Users</strong> Prankster Pokemon like Tornadus, Grimmsnarl, and Whimsicott can help Volcanion by giving priority to Haze, allowing it to negate stat boosts before setup foes deal any meaningful damage.</p>"

Additionally, it provides plenty of support thanks to Good as Gold making both itself and its partner immune to status moves including  Amoonguss's Spore and Incineroar's Parting Shot. Make It Rain is Gholdengo's standout move as an exceptionally high-powered spread attack, taking down the likes of Chien-Pao and Glimmora easily as well as Rillaboom at +2. Shadow Ball pressures other Ghost-types such as Sinistcha and opposing Gholdengo effectively while also hitting Steel-resistant foes such as Ogerpon-H well. Gholdengo can choose to run Recover in lieu of Protect if the rest of the team can provide the latter, making it incredibly hard to remove. As Gholdengo wants to sit on the field for as long as possible, Leftovers is the primary recovery item chosen to maximize healing; however, Sitrus Berry is a fine option for more immediate HP recovery. Gholdengo's inability to hit Incineroar for any meaningful damage make partners such as Ogerpon-W and Landorus greatly appreciated. The given bulk EVs allow Gholdengo to survive Landorus-T's Stomping Tantrum, Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch, and Heatran's Flash Fire-boosted Lava Plume. Its Speed allows it to outrun Choice Scarf Landorus-T in Tailwind. Tera Dragon is generally preferred to resist both Ogerpon-H's and Ogerpon-W's STAB moves; however, Tera Water is also fine as a good defensive typing overall.</p> <h4>Notable Partners</h4> <p><strong>Bulky Support Pokemon</strong>: The likes of Incineroar, Amoonguss, and Indeedee-F help make Gholdengo shine, with Intimidate nullifying physical attackers almost entirely and Fake Out, Rage Powder, and Follow Me providing safe opportunities to use Nasty Plot.</p> <p><strong>Other Setup Pokemon</strong>: Swords Dance Iron Hands and Cosmic Power Deoxys-D both appreicate Good as Gold granting them an immunity to common disruption such as Will-O-Wisp, Spore, and Taunt. Deoxys-D particularly appreciates Nasty Plot in order to boost its Stored Power damage even further.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon With Immunity Abilities</strong>: Pokemon such as Heatran and Latios provide Gholdengo with Flash Fire and Levitate, respectively, making it immediately immune to types it would otherwise be weak to.</p>"

Choice Specs also helps turn Shadow Ball into an OHKO against the likes of Latios, Sinistcha, and bulky Gholdengo. Dazzling Gleam is one of the best coverage options for Gholdengo, allowing it to deal significant damage to the plethora of Dragon-types in the metagame such as Raging Bolt and Walking Wake. Thunderbolt and Power Gem are alternative coverage options that improve Gholdengo's chances against Volcanion and Incineroar. Trick is an option that disrupts Trick Room setters such as Porygon2 as well as setup attackers like Iron Hands. Steel is Choice Specs Gholdengo's best Tera type, as it further boosts its strongest attack while also retaining its Dragon and Fairy resistances. Choice Specs is particularly good in Partners in Crime, as it allows Gholdengo to lock into its partner's move then later break the Choice lock by having its partner switch.</p> <h4>Notable Partners</h4> <p><strong>Tailwind Users</strong>: Whimsicott and Tornadus are Choice Specs Gholdengo's best friends, with Tailwind allowing it to deal massive damage immediately and its Good as Gold providing Whimsicott and Tornadus with a Taunt immunity. Whimsicott also offers Fake Tears to further boost Gholdengo's damage.</p> <p><strong>Setup Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that require setup to be as threatening as possible such as Swords Dance Rillaboom appreciate the immediate bursts of damage that Gholdengo can provide.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Given that Gholdengo can break its Choice lock at any time by having its partner switch, a strong special attacker such as Volcanion and Landorus makes for a great partner. These also happen to pass it invaluable coverage for Fire- and Steel-types, letting it stand up to Incineroar and Heatran more easily.</p>"

The last of these is appreciated by every Pokemon in the metagame due to Pokemon with Sword of Ruin not being affected by the ability. In particular, physical attackers take the best advantage of the ability, as their own damage output is boosted. Ice Spinner is Chien-Pao's preferred Ice-type STAB move thanks to its consistency over Icicle Crash and the ability to disrupt Indeedee-F's Psychic Terrain. Icicle Crash is a marginally stronger option that can be used if the team features a Terrain it wishes to preserve, which also comes with a flinch chance that is often felt due to Chien-Pao's high Speed. Sucker Punch is a must-have on Chien-Pao, as it allows it a form of damage even when playing against opposing Tailwind or Trick Room teams, notably pressuring the likes of Gholdengo effectively. Sacred Sword is generally preferred as a means to hit Pokemon that resist its STAB moves such as Incineroar and Heatran while also ignoring defensive boosts from the likes of IronPress Kommo-o. Haze is a great alternative to shut down opposing setup such as Gholdengo's Nasty Plot and Rillaboom's Swords Dance. Throat Chop is a stronger Dark-type option that also shuts down moves such as Incineroar's Parting Shot. Focus Sash is Chien-Pao's best item, as it helps patch up its otherwise mediocre bulk; meanwhile, Clear Amulet helps to staveoff Intimidate from Incineroar and Landorus-T. Tera Ghost is Chien-Pao's preferred Tera type, turning its Fighting weakness into an immunity while granting it a Fake Out immunity to help preserve its Focus Sash. Tera Stellar is a more offensive option that takes advantage of the plethora of uniquely typed moves that can be shared with Chien-Pao.</p> <p>Notable Partners</p> <p>================</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority Users</strong>: Extreme Speed users such as Dragonite and Entei make for great partners with Chien-Pao thanks to Sword of Ruin raising their Extreme Speeds' damage to exorbitant heights. Other priority moves such as Rillaboom's Grassy Glide are also good, while all of the aforementioned Pokemon appreciate Ice Spinner from Chien-Pao to clear Psychic Terrain.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Pokemon</strong>: As Sword of Ruin grants the user immunity to the ability, bulky setup Pokemon such as Nasty Plot Gholdengo and Dragon Dance Dragonite appreciate the presence of Chien-Pao.</p>"
