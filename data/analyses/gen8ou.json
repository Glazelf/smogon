    "overview": "<p>Nidoking is equipped with an incredible STAB combination that is amplified by its ability Sheer Force and a Life Orb, allowing it to operate as a powerful special wallbreaker despite its mediocre base Special Attack. In addition, it boasts phenomenal coverage options such as Ice Beam, Flamethrower, and Thunderbolt that allow it to reliably pressure switch-ins to its STAB attacks such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, Slowking, and Landorus-T. Nidoking's defensive typing is solid as well, letting it take advantage of Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Clefable for wallbreaking opportunities as well as providing it with a handy Toxic and Thunder Wave immunity. However, its bulk and Speed tier leave much to be desired. It is very prone to being revenge killed by faster threats like offensive Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Tapu Lele and struggles to find natural wallbreaking opportunities due to its frailty, relying on pivoting allies that can switch it in safely. Despite its good defensive typing, Nidoking's fragility also makes it difficult to utilize consistently, especially if it sustains prior chip damage. On top of this, Nidoking is reliant on its item to do damage due to its mediocre Special Attack, making it susceptible to Knock Off. This can be particularly troublesome against Clefable, which Nidoking can otherwise take advantage of. Special walls such as Blissey and Slowking are problematic as well, having no qualms switching into most of its attacks and gaining momentum on its escape with Teleport.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Taunt allows Nidoking to exploit its small subset of switch-ins by incapacitating most forms of progress, such as Teleport and entry hazard removal, or hazard setup. Taunt mainly punishes Blissey, greatly limiting its utility and providing the Nidoking user with an opportunity to capitalize on it. However, Taunt is a move that needs to be used aggressively to get value, which can conflict with Nidoking's role as a wallbreaker. Alternatively, Focus Punch can be used for the luring and dispatching of Blissey, putting it in range of a subsequent STAB move. This can open Nidoking for more wallbreaking opportunities against teams that are overreliant on Blissey as their special backbone; however, Focus Punch is extremely matchup reliant and has little to no utility against other Pokemon. Lastly, Stealth Rock can be used on teams lacking a Stealth Rock setter, enabling Nidoking to set the hazard on forced switches. Though, using the move limits Nidoking's wallbreaking potential greatly.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Nidoking is extremely susceptible to revenge killing from a wide range of offensive Pokemon like Landorus-T, Rillaboom, Dragapult, and Urshifu-R that can take advantage of its mediocre bulk and Speed tier to force it out and create progress with options such as Stealth Rock, Knock Off, and U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T and Garchomp can scare out Nidoking with their greater Speed and super effective STAB attacks. Landorus-T, particularly, is not bothered by Nidoking's STAB attacks but can easily be overwhelmed by its coverage if utilized recklessly. Gastrodon and Swampert, additionally, are willing to take on Nidoking and scare it out with their respective STAB moves; the latter, however, can also be overwhelmed due to its lack of reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Blissey is a counter to most Nidoking variants that can reliably switch into any one of its special attacks, being only somewhat deterred by Taunt and the situational Focus Punch. Galarian Slowking, Slowking, and Tyranitar are also capable of taking its hits if healthy.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Nidoking is reliant on its Life Orb for its damage output; for this reason, Nidoking losing its Life Orb to Knock Off or Trick greatly mitigates the threat of its power. Additionally, given Knock Off's prevalence, Nidoking's susceptibility to the move allows Knock Off users to safely force progress using it against the Nidoking user's team.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Flamethrower reliably OHKOes Ferrothorn and Scizor and can apply pressure to Corviknight. Ice Beam targets Landorus-T, Garchomp, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T. Thunderbolt is an alternative to threaten super effective damage on Slowking. Thunder applies much more pressure to Slowking and OHKOes Tornadus-T as they switch in at the cost of a lower accuracy; however, a Modest nature is necessary if Thunder is used to create a more favorable roll to KO Slowking with a subsequent Sludge Wave. Substitute is another option that lets Nidoking fully capitalize on a forced switch and safely force damage on a target of its choice without the threat of being knocked out beforehand, which greatly eases the need for prediction, but forces Nidoking to drop an additional coverage option. A Modest nature provides the Nidoking user with a more fruitful damage output and a much more favorable roll to 2HKO Slowking with Thunderbolt. However, Timid allows Nidoking to outspeed Tapu Bulu, Modest Tapu Lele, and Zapdos.</p> <p>Nidoking's inability to find many natural wallbreaking opportunities makes it a phenomenal partner with offensive pivots such as Tapu Koko and Dragapult that can provide it with opportunities to switch in safely. The former is able to apply great pressure to checks like Corviknight and Slowking while pivoting against bulky Grass-types like Ferrothorn; its Electric Terrain, additionally, boosts Nidoking's Thunderbolt, which is prominent against Slowking. The latter pivots against bulky Fairy-types like Tapu Fini and Clefable while applying pressure to Slowking with its Ghost-type STAB attacks. Additionally, it is capable of utilizing Thunder Wave to slow down Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, turning them into wallbreaking fodder for Nidoking. Nidoking also pairs well with defensive pivots like Corviknight and Rotom-W, which give Nidoking a safe wallbreaking opportunity against Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Grass-types like Tangrowth. They, additionally, can give Nidoking a good escape option against potential revenge killers like Tapu Lele for Corviknight and Landorus-T in Rotom-W's case. Slowking can also find good pivoting opportunities against Tapu Koko and Tangrowth while giving Nidoking the ability to exploit Toxapex for a wallbreaking opportunity. In addition, entry hazards and Knock Off are valuable tools that can greatly aid Nidoking's wallbreaking abilities by forcing checks like Slowking and Landorus-T to fold to its coverage. Ferrothorn, for example, boasts access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Knock Off to remove Slowking's Heavy-Duty Boots and more effectively pressure it. Landorus-T is also capable of using Stealth Rock and Knock Off, as well as pivoting against opposing Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Fini with U-turn and providing Nidoking with a wallbreaking opportunity. Clefable is also a solid Stealth Rock setter that has access to Knock Off.</p>"

When combining these traits with Future Sight, Slowbro can make progress against the opposing team while being able to support wallbreakers like Melmetal, Weavile, and Urshifu-R to break past their checks. Slowbro can run a Colbur Berry set with Body Press, letting it remove or even force out Dark-types like Weavile. However, Slowbro is susceptible to Toxic, hindering its ability to function as a pivot reliably and getting constantly worn down from U-turn spam and leaving problems when dealing with Landorus-T, Victini, and Heatran. Additionally, Slowbro's mediocre Special Defense makes it vulnerable when dealing with special attackers like Tapu Lele and Blacephalon.</p>",

Teleport lets Slowbro bring teammates in safely and synergizes well with its bulk and Future Sight. Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred item as it lets Slowbro avoid entry hazard damage, making it much more difficult to break past and allowing Slowbro to pivot more efficiently. Alternatively, Colbur Berry can be used with Body Press to lure in and remove Weavile. 0 Speed IVs and a Relaxed nature make Slowbro as slow as possible to make it move after opposing Slowbro. Rocky Helmet is another alternate option for Slowbro to punish U-turn users like Landorus-T and Urshifu-R.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Urshifu-R, Melmetal, and Weavile appreciate Future Sight's offensive pressure and being brought in safely by Teleport against Pokemon they can force out like Toxapex and Tapu Fini. Tornadus-T and Buzzwole are great partners, as they check Grass-types like Kartana and Rillaboom and appreciate Slowbro's ability to handle Urshifu-R, Victini, and Melmetal. Buzzwole in particular can take advantage of Future Sight. Slowbro struggles in handling special attackers like Dragapult, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Koko, so specially defensive partners like Assault Vest Tornadus-T, Ferrothorn, and Galarian Slowking are useful. Tornadus-T and Galarian Slowking can both form potent Regenerator cores with Slowbro. Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp can take on Electric-types like Zeraora, Tapu Koko, and Regieleki for Slowbro and block their Volt Switch attempts. When using Colbur Berry Slowbro, partners like Dragapult, Blacephalon, and Tornadus-T appreciate its ability to remove Weavile for them, with the former two especially benefitting from this, as they can spam their Ghost-type STAB moves more easily. Tornadus-T and Landorus-T can provide entry hazard control for Colbur Berry Slowbro, as it misses out on avoiding entry hazard damage, allowing Slowbro to make the most from Regenerator recovery.</p>"

Choice Scarf gives Ditto the ability to outspeed any Pokemon that isn't running a Choice Scarf itself, or Pokemon like Hawlucha once Unburden has been activated. Ditto is able to duplicate the opposing Pokemon's base stats bar HP; hence, 252 HP is required in order to maximize Ditto's bulk. 252 SpA and Quiet nature increase the damage of Future Sight after copying a user such as Slowbro, as Future Sight damage will be calculated based on Ditto's SpA before transforming, should Ditto switch out. Against stall teams, Ditto should switch into Knock Off to get its Choice Scarf removed so it can switch moves and have effectively infinite PP as it switches out. This is especially useful against passive Pokemon with recovery like Toxapex, Mandibuzz, and Quagsire, as it can increase its longevity throughout the game.</p> <p>Ditto functions best under bulky teams like stall that require support against offensive setup and opposing stall teams. Blissey appreciates Ditto's ability to break through setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Hydreigon and Venusaur, making it a great partner. In return, Blissey can pivot out slowly with Teleport to provide free switch-in opportunities. Corviknight is a fantastic partner for its ability to remove entry hazards to keep Ditto healthy throughout the game and pivot out with U-turn to bring it in safely. Trick Clefable can help cripple entry hazard removers like Excadrill and Corviknight and other Pokemon like Toxapex and Ferrothorn. Toxapex is useful for dealing with defensive Calm Mind Pokemon like Clefable, which Ditto struggles against due to its Choice Scarf. If you opt to run Toxapex, having a Regenerator core from Pokemon like Reuniclus, Amoonguss, or Tangrowth can prove useful, allowing Ditto to better PP stall defensive Pokemon. Having wallbreakers to support Ditto against stall can benefit it greatly; Pokemon like Safeguard Volcarona, Substitute Kyurem, and Block + Transform Mew can prove useful, with the latter trapping Toxapex, which Ditto struggles to remove.</p>"

Due to Defiant, Galarian Zapdos possesses the unique trait of threatening both Landorus-T and Corviknight's Defog with an Attack boost, which can nearly guarantee a KO. With even a +1 boost from Defiant, Galarian Zapdos threatens a KO on Corviknight with Close Combat, and with a +2 boost, Toxapex is OHKOed with Brave Bird. Furthermore, its access to U-turn allows Galarian Zapdos to act as a strong pivot, as it forces many defensive Pokemon out such as Ferrothorn and Heatran along with slower offensive threats like Tapu Lele and Urshifu-R. U-turn also is a strong midground play against Slowbro, which is a common switch-in to Galarian Zapdos on Regenerator team structures. However, its powerful Brave Bird comes with the drawback of recoil damage, which, when compounded with passive damage caused by Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, or Stealth Rock, can greatly limit its staying power.

Stomping Tantrum is another option that acts as a way of pressuring bulky Poison-types like Toxapex and Galarian Slowking without Brave Bird recoil while also hitting Tapu Koko on the switch and Aegislash super effectively. Drill Peck is another option for the third moveslot that gives Galarian Zapdos more staying power than using Brave Bird constantly and is good for picking off weakened enemies. U-turn is helpful for generating momentum against healthy Regenerator cores and scouting if locking into Brave Bird or Close Combat is not desirable.</p> <p>Galarian Zapdos fits best on offensively oriented teams due to its incredible breaking power and ability to build momentum. Pivots like Dragapult and Tapu Fini help Galarian Zapdos get on the field safely while chipping away at foes health to allow Galarian Zapdos to more easily wallbreak. Tornadus-T, particularly Assault Vest variants, is an excellent pivot that pairs well with Galarian Zapdos, as it is able to both spam Knock Off and eat most hits that would otherwise KO Galarian Zapdos. Entry hazard support helps Galarian Zapdos secure easier KOes against bulkier foes and bait the opponent into activating Defiant with Defog, so teammates such as Spikes Ferrothorn and Stealth Rock Landorus-T are good choices. Ferrothorn can more easily chip away at foes with Knock Off and Leech Seed, while Landorus-T can come in on Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zeraora that threaten Galarian Zapdos. Landorus-T can also utilize Toxic to wear down some of Galarian Zapdos's checks like Zapdos and Slowbro. Pairing Galarian Zapdos with another physical wallbreaker like Weavile or Melmetal is suggested, as together they can break through each other's checks. Both Weavile and Melmetal appreciate Galarian Zapdos's ability to deter Defog due to Defiant and blast through defensive walls like Ferrothorn and Toxapex with Brave Bird, while Galarian Zapdos appreciates Weavile removing Toxapex and Clefable's items with Knock Off and Melmetal's ability to both switch into Fairy-type attacks and spread status to bulky Flying-types like Corviknight and Zapdos. Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Magnezone, and Zeraora are excellent choices as teammates as they can bait in Landorus-T, activating Defiant on a double switch. Tapu Koko particularly appreciates Galarian Zapdos beating Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Galarian Slowking, while Magnezone comes with the added benefit of trapping Corviknight and Skarmory with Magnet Pull, allowing Galarian Zapdos to more freely use Brave Bird.

Slowking's typing and mediocre physical bulk also leave it very vulnerable to Knock Off and U-turn. This is an issue, as these moves are very frequently run and often safe to use, further limiting Slowking's utility as a defensive pivot. In addition, Toxic is worrisome, as it forces Slowking to use Slack Off more often and limits its potential to consistently switch into dangerous Pokemon such as the aforementioned Heatran, Nidoking, and Tapu Lele.</p>",

However, none of these Pokemon appreciate switching into Scald or Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Blissey easily switches into Future Sight and heals off the damage with Soft-Boiled; it also has Heal Bell or Natural Cure to remove Galarian Slowking's status. Corviknight cannot be 2HKOed by Flamethrower from non-setup sets and is able to PP stall Galarian Slowking. Heatran can trap Galarian Slowking and chip it down greatly, which is especially problematic on sets lacking Water coverage. Slowking can switch in easily and use Future Sight and Teleport against Galarian Slowking.</p>",

The combination of Future Sight and Sludge Bomb also allows Galarian Slowking to easily break through and damage Substitute users like Zapdos. However, Psychic can be used for more immediate damage against Toxapex and Urshifu-R. Flamethrower punishes Steel-type switch-ins to Future Sight like Ferrothorn and Corviknight. Scald punishes Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Landorus, and Excadrill with a potential burn and chips down Heatran. Hydro Pump is a notable option, as its power allows Galarian Slowking to 3HKO specially defensive Heatran and 2HKO defensive Ground-types like Landorus-T and Hippowdon, but it has lower accuracy and cannot burn foes like Scald. Ice Beam can replace Scald to specifically target Ground- and Dragon-types like Landorus-T, Dragapult, and Garchomp. Assault Vest allows Galarian Slowking to act as a special tank, sponging hits from Fairy-types like Clefable, Tapu Koko, and Tapu Fini and threatening them with its STAB moves. The EV spread with a Calm nature and Assault Vest allows Galarian Slowking to tank two Choice Specs Shadow Balls from Dragapult and survive a Choice Band Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R. However, if improving the Dragapult matchup is not necessary for the team, a Modest nature can be run for increased damage output.</p> <p>Urshifu-R is a nice partner due to its ability to deal with Ground- and Dark-types that threaten Galarian Slowking. In return, Galarian Slowking helps Urshifu-R break through opposing teams with Future Sight and status. Dragapult greatly appreciates Galarian Slowking's ability to switch into bulky Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini and Clefable. Moreover, Galarian Slowking can cripple walls such as Hippowdon and Tyranitar with Scald, empowering Dragapult's Hex and increasing its wallbreaking potential when paired with Future Sight. Partners that can absorb Knock Off such as Corviknight and Clefable also pair well with Galarian Slowking. Corviknight and Tangrowth in particular are also good switch-ins to Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Garchomp. Entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory appreciate Galarian Slowking pressuring most entry hazard removers with status from Scald and Sludge Bomb. In return, Galarian Slowking appreciates Spikes wearing down switch-ins such as Heatran, Tyranitar, and opposing Galarian Slowking in conjunction with its ability to spread status.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Skarmory's impressive physical bulk and great defensive typing allow it to blanket check most physical attackers in the tier, including Landorus-T, Garchomp, Rillaboom, Kartana, and Weavile. Skarmory differentiates itself from other physical walls by being one of the only viable Spikes setters in the tier, easily setting it because of the many switches it forces against the Pokemon it walls. This prevents it from being completely passive despite its poor offensive stats. Iron Defense in conjunction with Body Press can also turn it into a late-game wincon. However, Skarmory's terrible special bulk leaves it vulnerable to almost every special attack, including even resisted attacks from strong wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Dragapult. Skarmory faces competition from Ferrothorn and Mew as a Spikes setter, which have access to Knock Off and better special bulk to check Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Kyurem, as well as Corviknight and Buzzwole as a physically defensive wall, which have U-turn and actual offensive presence, respectively. Skarmory does, however, have access to reliable recovery and can consistently check Ground-types unlike Ferrothorn, as well as access to Spikes unlike Corviknight and Buzzwole.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Whirlwind can be used in the third moveslot to phaze setup sweepers and Pokemon that Skarmory does not want to face, like Tapu Koko, Magnezone, and Volcarona, if they try to switch into it. The switches it forces can wear down the opposing team in conjunction with Spikes. A Shed Shell allows Skarmory to escape Magnezone's Magnet Pull, which can annoy teams that rely on it to trap Skarmory to support Pokemon like Rillaboom and Kartana. However, Rocky Helmet is valuable, especially against U-turn users Skarmory can't punish without it, and Shed Shell can easily be removed by Knock Off if it pivots into one of the aforementioned Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type Coverage</strong>: Tapu Koko and Zapdos do not mind anything except Toxic from Skarmory and can switch in and force it out, or remove Spikes with Defog in Zapdos's case. Zeraora dislikes switching into Body Press, leaving it reliant on pivots to switch in, but it also forces Skarmory out and can set up on it with Bulk Up. Magnezone is of particular note, as it traps Skarmory with Magnet Pull, though it must be wary of Body Press on the switch, and faster variants of Skarmory can outspeed and KO Magnezone with Body Press if it is weakened. Melmetal can potentially force in Skarmory and use Thunder Punch to weaken it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Volcarona and Victini can switch into Skarmory safely if it does not carry Toxic, and the former can use Skarmory as setup fodder if it does not carry Whirlwind. Heatran cannot switch in safely in fear of Body Press but can force Skarmory out. Garchomp, which Skarmory usually walls, occasionally uses a mixed set with Fire Blast in order to lure in and KO it. Galarian Slowking usually uses Flamethrower on its Assault Vest set.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Due to Skarmory's low special bulk, almost every special attacker, like Hydreigon, Tapu Lele, and Tornadus-T, is capable of threatening it out, though the former two take considerable damage from Body Press should they switch directly in. Pivots like Landorus-T that Skarmory wants to switch into can use U-turn to bring one of these special attackers safely in against it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Body Press is the preferred attacking move, as it deals significant damage to most of the physical attackers Skarmory wants to check like Kartana, Excadrill, and Rillaboom, and it punishes Magnezone attempting to switch in and trap Skarmory. Iron Defense allows Skarmory to match boosts from setup sweepers like Swords Dance Weavile and Garchomp. Be careful when facing Kartana, however, as Sacred Sword bypasses Defense boosts. Iron Defense also boosts the power of Body Press, making Skarmory less passive and potentially able to sweep late-game if faster special attackers are removed. Toxic is an alternative to cripple some Pokemon that can otherwise switch into Skarmory like Zapdos, Volcarona, Tapu Koko, and Slowking, and it allows Skarmory to more consistently keep its Spikes up; it quickly puts most Defog users, with the exception of Corviknight, on a timer. However, it lets physical setup attackers overwhelm Skarmory in the short term. Rocky Helmet allows Skarmory to wear down physical attackers that make contact like Urshifu-R and Weavile. It is also particularly useful for deterring U-turn to gain momentum from the likes of Rillaboom, Landorus-T, and Urshifu-R, forcing progress against them. At the cost of considerable bulk, 176 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Modest Magnezone so that Skarmory can 2HKO it with Body Press if it is weakened or caught on the switch.</p> <p>Many offensive Pokemon can benefit from Skarmory's Spikes punishing the switches they force and wearing down checks, like Bisharp, Weavile, Zeraora, and Dragapult. Bisharp and Weavile are particularly notable for their powerful Knock Offs, which can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes to wear them down further with Spikes, and the former can deter Defog thanks to Defiant while utilizing Assurance to take advantage of Spikes. Ground-types like Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Garchomp can check Electric-types for Skarmory. Skarmory usually draws in special attackers, making special walls that can check them for it ideal teammates. For example, Blissey is a good check to Dragapult and Hydreigon, Slowking checks Heatran and Tapu Lele, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking covers Kyurem and Tapu Koko. Skarmory's Spikes prevents U-turn users like Dragapult and Tapu Koko from freely using them for momentum, especially when paired with Knock Off support. Skarmory can also check most of the strong physical attackers that can beat them, like Rillaboom and Landorus-T. Skarmory is especially valuable to sand teams, as it can check Pokemon that they are usually weak to like Rillaboom and Excadrill, forming a solid defensive core with either specially defensive Tyranitar or Hippowdon, the two viable sand setters.</p>"

Thanks to Teleport's great utility, Blissey can safely bring in a teammate and get momentum against your opponents. In addition, Teleport in tandem with its ability to check many special attackers let Blissey perform as an effective pivot. Natural Cure and Heavy-Duty Boots synergize well with Teleport and make Blissey hard to wear down, as it doesn't have to fear status. However, Blissey is a very passive Pokemon and is vulnerable to Taunt. Blissey is also threatened by the prevalence of strong Knock Off users such as Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Clefable due to its poor physical bulk and reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots to prevent it from being worn down by entry hazards.</p>",

Calm Mind Tapu Fini with Taunt and Draining Kiss also turns Blissey into setup fodder, as Taunt can shut down Blissey's utility entirely.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick</strong>: Blissey dislikes Knock Off, as Heavy-Duty Boots are key to keeping it healthy, and losing it makes Blissey less effective at checking threats throughout the game. Ferrothorn especially is troublesome for Blissey, as it can remove Blissey's item and proceed to set up entry hazards and Leech Seed.

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The specially defensive set can run Ice Beam to serve as a lure to Landorus-T and Garchomp, dealing a ton of damage on the switch, but it has limited uses outside of that, and running Thunder Wave is more useful to permanently cripple Pokemon like Corviknight and Clefable. Chople Berry allows Tyranitar to survive Fighting-type moves from the likes of Tornadus-T and KO them back with its Rock-type STAB move or cripple them with status conditions; however, it is a single-use item and Tyranitar prefers the longevity provided by Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots. A Dragon Dance set with Weakness Policy alongside dual screens support could be used on hyper offense teams, as dual screens allow Tyranitar to survive strong super effective moves like Garchomp's Earthquake and Tapu Lele's Moonblast while setting up. However, it has a mediocre Speed tier even after a boost, and it is outsped by threats like Zeraora, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Kartana, which can revenge kill it easily after some chip damage. The Choice Band set can use an EV spread of 40 HP / 252 Atk / 48 SpD / 168 Spe to withstand a Moonblast from Choice Specs Tapu Lele while still outspeeding Azumarill and Skarmory.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Offensive Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill threaten to KO Tyranitar with their strong STAB Earthquakes. They can set up Stealth Rock or boost with Swords Dance as Tyranitar is scared out. However, they are worn down quickly if they switch into Choice Band Tyranitar's attacks. Albeit uncommon, physically defensive Hippowdon can take on any Tyranitar set lacking Toxic and set up Stealth Rock or hit it with its STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Offensive Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana can OHKO Tyranitar with their Grass-type STAB moves. However, they dislike being paralyzed by Thunder Wave, and they don't take hits from Choice Band Tyranitar very well. Tangrowth's great bulk coupled with Regenerator allows it to switch into Tyranitar with relative ease. However, it can be crippled by Thunder Wave or Toxic from the specially defensive set. Ferrothorn can switch into the specially defensive set almost unharmed, and it can set Spikes or cripple Tyranitar with Leech Seed.

Ice Punch nails Landorus-T and Garchomp on the switch while hitting Hippowdon for decent damage.

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon is an amazing specially defensive wall because of its defensive typing, ability, and access to reliable recovery that differentiate it from the other Ground-types in the metagame. It remains one of the only consistent checks to offensive pivots like Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Dragapult and is notably one of the best checks to Heatran. Gastrodon can also serve as an all-purpose wall against common special attackers like Volcarona, Nidoking, and Dracozolt. Sticky Hold lets it become a counter to most Pokemon using Knock Off and Trick to force progress, like Zeraora, pivot Tornadus-T, and Clefable. On teams lacking solid Water-resistant Pokemon, Storm Drain gives it an edge in matchups against rain teams. However, its passiveness usually relegates it to more defensive teams that can afford its loss in momentum and staying power. For example, it often invites in threatening Grass-types like Kartana and Rillaboom on a predicted Recover or Earthquake, requiring teammates to handle these polarizing offensive threats. Offensive pivots that Gastrodon checks, like Dragapult, can also gain momentum and steady chip damage on it with U-turn, making them much more difficult to check long-term. It is also incredibly vulnerable to status from some of the threats it checks, like Heatran's and Zeraora's Toxic and Dragapult's Will-O-Wisp. Gastrodon faces competition from other defensive Ground-types that are less passive or have the ability to set Stealth Rock, like Landorus-T, Swampert, defensive Garchomp, and its main alternative on defensive teams, Hippowdon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Gastrodon can run Curse with Waterfall over Scald to act as a late-game wincon, but its vulnerability to incredibly common revenge killers like Rillaboom and Kartana, and status from Skarmory, Zapdos, and Toxapex make this a niche and unreliable team option without extensive team support from partners like Magnezone and Heatran.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Defensive Grass-types like Ferrothorn and Tangrowth can often come in against Gastrodon with little risk, forcing it out easily. Offensive threats like Kartana and Rillaboom, which can either be pivoted in by a teammate like Slowking or switched directly in on a prediction, are also able to force Gastrodon to switch and use it as an opportunity to set up with Swords Dance, force progress with Knock Off, or pivot with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Status inflicted by Zeraora, Dragapult, and Zapdos can make Gastrodon's job as a specially defensive wall much more difficult because of its need to use Recover more often. Heatran can also use Toxic and Taunt to stop Gastrodon from healing, but this is risky because of the chance Heatran is OHKOed by Earthquake on an incorrect prediction.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Scald gives Gastrodon some offensive pressure by letting it punish common Grass- and Steel-type switch-ins like Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, and Corviknight with a burn. Earth Power and Earthquake both have different perks, as the former allows it to hit Bulk Up Zeraora harder and can be used without drawbacks on Grassy Terrain, while the latter hits specially defensive Heatran and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking harder. Recover gives Gastrodon a reliable way to check offensive threats like Heatran, Tapu Koko, Nidoking, and Dragapult over the course of a game. Toxic lets Gastrodon apply pressure on Pokemon like Zapdos, Dragapult, and Slowbro. Protect is another option that lets Gastrodon scout Choice item Pokemon like Choice Specs Dragapult and Tapu Lele, and lets it gain extra Leftovers recovery. Clear Smog  lets Gastrodon sit on many different specially attacking setup sweepers, including Calm Mind Clefable and Volcarona. For teams lacking concrete Water-resistant Pokemon, Storm Drain can be used for a better matchup against rain teams, Volcanion, as well as providing a rare immunity to Scald to block progress from common users like Toxapex and Galarian Slowking. Sticky Hold gives Gastrodon the ability to keep its Heavy-Duty Boots forever, making it less vulnerable to chip damage from entry hazards and being gradually worn down by offensive pivots that it checks, such as Dragapult and Tapu Koko. Sticky Hold also lets it counter defensive Pokemon using Knock Off to force progress, like Toxapex lacking Toxic and Clefable. Leftovers, typically used on teams with better entry hazard control, give Gastrodon more longevity at the cost of increased vulnerability to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. A Sassy nature is run on Earthquake variants, otherwise a Calm nature is prefered. A more physically defensive spread with 48 Defense and 208 Special Defense EVs let it survive a Choice Specs-boosted Psyshock from Modest Tapu Lele and guarantee a 3HKO from defensive Landorus-T's Earthquake with Leftovers.</p> <p>Gastrodon primarily fits on more defensive balance and stall teams because of its passiveness and vulnerability to being taken advantage of by offensive threats like Rillaboom. These teams greatly appreciate its ability to check Heatran and Dracozolt, wallbreakers that their defensive cores typically struggle with. It is also an incredibly effective check to Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Dragapult, offensive pivots that are usually able to annoy defensive teams with Knock Off. Gastrodon's defensive typing and Sticky Hold additionally help limit their pivoting. Physically defensive teammates like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Buzzwole help patch up Gastrodon's weakness to Rillaboom and Kartana while also pushing their advantage on a forced switch by pivoting with U-turn, setting Spikes, and gaining a wallbreaking opportunity with its powerful STAB and coverage moves, respectively. Because Gastrodon can often give free switches to special attackers that threaten it, like Tapu Lele, other specially defensive teammates like Blissey and Heatran make solid teammates as well. Gastrodon's vulnerability to status can be alleviated by Aromatherapy support from clerics like Clefable and Blissey, which also appreciate Gastrodon's support as a solid Heatran check.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Garchomp's above-average Speed tier, great Attack stat, relevant coverage options, ability, and good defensive typing let it perform several roles such as setting Stealth Rock, wallbreaking, and checking physical attackers. It is one of the best wallbreakers and cleaners in the metagame because of its nearly unresisted STAB move combination, Speed tier, and good natural bulk. It also serves as one of the tier's best entry hazard setters in the tier because it immensely pressures Defoggers such as Mandibuzz and Zapdos through Toxic. Despite this, Garchomp can struggle to keep up Stealth Rock versus Corviknight and Landorus-T, and its setup set is somewhat unreliable due to Scale Shot's imperfect accuracy. Garchomp also suffers from lacking longevity, making it vulnerable to chip damage from switching in on Pokemon like Heatran and Zapdos. Additionally, it faces competition from Landorus-T as a Stealth Rock setter due to the latter's ability to remove most Defoggers' Heavy Duty Boots with Knock Off and pivot with U-turn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Garchomp can run a Naive nature and Fire Blast on Swords Dance sets to punish Steel-types it lures in like Corviknight and Skarmory. More dedicated mixed sets, also utilizing a Naive nature and maximum Special Attack investment, can aim to punish lured in defensive checks like Landorus-T, Slowbro, and Buzzwole, as well as Corviknight and Skarmory, with a strong Draco Meteor or Fire Blast.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Physically defensive Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Fini can switch in on Stealth Rock sets and use Moonblast, although they have trouble checking Swords Dance sets, especially if Garchomp holds a Life Orb. Their Dragon immunity lets them strategically block Scale Shot's Speed boosts, making Garchomp easier to revenge kill by faster threats. This is somewhat unreliable, though, because revenge killers still may need a sacrifice to switch in freely.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon like Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Tangrowth can check Garchomp without Fire Blast or Toxic effectively and cripple it with a Scald, Toxic, Stun Spore, or Sleep Powder. All of these Pokemon can pivot into most of Garchomp's moves and force it out consistently if it hasn't used Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Corviknight and Skarmory</strong>: Both of these Steel / Flying types resist both of Garchomp's STAB attacks and take neutral damage from Stone Edge, although they have to be cautious of Fire Blast. Their high Defense and typing lets them chip Garchomp easily, set up on it with Iron Defense, pivot out with U-turn into a different check like Clefable or a revenge killer like Rillaboom in Corviknight's case, or force it out with Whirlwind in Skarmory's.</p> <p><strong>Rillaboom</strong>: Rillaboom's priority in Grassy Glide and its Grassy Terrain weakening Garchomp's Earthquakes make it a decent offensive check to most Garchomp sets, as well as a good revenge killer after Garchomp has boosted its Speed.</p>",

Scale Shot's Speed boost makes Garchomp outspeed slower revenge killers and sweep effectively. It primarily uses Fire Fang to threaten Corviknight, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn. Aqua Tail is another option thats lets it hit Landorus-T and Air Balloon Heatran for super effective damage as well as Volcarona harder. Stone Edge is another option  to threaten Flying-types such as Zapdos, Mandibuzz, and Tornadus-T. Threatening these bulky Defoggers makes Garchomp an excellent Stealth Rock setter. Leftovers provides more longevity, while Life Orb applies more pressure against physical walls like Clefable and Ferrothorn. Lum Berry can be used to heal off status conditions such as Landorus-T's Toxic and Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp. Finally, Roseli Berry can be used to deny revenge killing attempts from full health Clefable, Dazzling Gleam Tapu Koko, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. A Jolly nature allows Garchomp to outspeed the likes of Volcarona, Zapdos, Urshifu-R, and Timid Tapu Lele. However, an Adamant nature alongside Life Orb can be used to further boosts Garchomp's damage output, letting it OHKO physically defensive Clefable after a Swords Dance.</p> <p>Scale Shot Garchomp often features on offense teams utilizing other wallbreakers alongside dual screens support to make it sweep as effectively as possible. Scale Shot sets often need their health to be able to set up and sweep. If Garchomp runs Stealth Rock or Stone Edge, many Pokemon can benefit from its ability to pressure most Flying-types, most notably Kartana and Melmetal, which can break through teams incredibly easily. Additionally, Corviknight can serve as a good defensive partner. Garchomp can offensively answer Corviknight's checks, such as Heatran and Zapdos, while Corviknight can check some common revenge killers like Rillaboom. Swords Dance Garchomp does not have many solid defensive answers besides Steel / Flying types such as Skarmory and Corviknight and Unaware Pokemon like Clefable. Heatran, Magnezone, and Tapu Koko can exert pressure on these checks to give Garchomp easier setup opportunities.</p>"

Protect is useful to scout moves from Choice-locked Pokemon like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Choice Band Rillaboom, and it is especially useful on Leftovers sets for better recovery every other turn. Flamethrower is an option to pressure Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Skarmory, which would otherwise be free to set up their own entry hazards or remove Garchomp's Stealth Rock. It can also help Garchomp check offensive Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana that take little damage from Earthquake.

However, Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain weakening Earthquake usually warrants a replacement STAB move in either Stomping Tantrum or Scorching Sands. Garchomp's strain on Defoggers can help other dedicated entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Skarmory. Tapu Koko is also a good partner due to its pressure on Flying-types—especially Corviknight and Skarmory—that can free up Garchomp's fourth moveslot, and it benefits from Garchomp's pressure on Tangrowth, Landorus-T, and Galarian Slowking through Toxic and Earthquake. Garchomp's immense pressure on Heatran and Galarian Slowking, specifically, can also make special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Calm Mind Clefable ideal teammates.</p>"

Hippowdon is one of the defining components of sand balance teams due to Sand Stream and provides further support by setting up Stealth Rock and checking key threats like Dragapult and Tapu Koko. However, Hippowdon's susceptibility to being pivoted against by these Pokemon makes it easy to wear down and forces it to switch out. It also faces stiff competition as a defensive Ground-type from Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Swampert, and Gastrodon; however, Hippowdon manages to offset this due to reliable recovery in Slack Off and access to Stealth Rock. Additionally, as Hippowdon is a passive Stealth Rock setter, it is difficult to keep its entry hazards on the field against common entry hazard removers such as Corviknight, since it can only use Whirlwind or Toxic to dissuade them. Hippowdon is also vulnerable to entry hazards and status, which make it much harder to remain healthy while checking offensive threats.</p>",

This physical set can often run Rocky Helmet to chip physical attackers and pivots such as Melmetal and Tapu Koko, although Hippowdon should be wary of Toxic.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Corviknight and Skarmory</strong>: Hippowdon hates facing Corviknight and Skarmory due to its inability to do anything against them, especially if Hippowdon is not carrying Whirlwind. Skarmory can then use Hippowdon to set up Spikes, while Corviknight can remove entry hazards with Defog. At best, Hippowdon can use Whirlwind against them or Earthquake as they heal with Roost, but it fails to sufficiently weaken them.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Hippowdon is easily worn down by status and entry hazards, which prevent it from checking Pokemon as effectively as it would like.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Weavile threatens Hippowdon with its powerful Ice-type STAB moves, although it cannot come in on a potential Earthquake or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, and Kartana wall Hippowdon and force it out, as they easily tank Earthquake and shrug off its coverage moves.

Toxic allows Hippowdon to punish non-Poison-immune Flying-types that attempt to remove its entry hazards, such as Zapdos and Mandibuzz, and other vulnerable walls such as Tangrowth, Slowking, and Swampert. Whirlwind is also a viable option, allowing Hippowdon to phaze foes it cannot do much against, such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight. Whirlwind can also be used to prevent Hippowdon from being used as setup fodder by setup sweepers like Clefable and Volcarona. Leftovers provides Hippowdon with passive recovery and helps alleviate pressure from offensive threats by letting it waste less turns healing with Slack Off. 8 Attack EVs ensure Hippowdon OHKOes Excadrill with Earthquake. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents residual damage from Spikes and Toxic Spikes, although the passive recovery from Leftovers is in most cases too good to pass up.</p> <p>Hippowdon's Electric immunity and access to reliable recovery give it defensive synergy with partners on more defensive teams and pivots such as Toxapex and Clefable; it helps the team from being overwhelmed by Electric-types such as Zeraora and Tapu Koko.

Sand Rush Excadrill can utilize Hippowdon's sand to clean late-game after a Swords Dance while also providing entry hazard removal. Knock Off and status absorbers like Clefable and Reuniclus are useful if Hippowdon is being utilized on defensive teams, as they provide the team with much more longevity in the long term.

This support greatly enables many of the strongest sweepers and wallbreakers in the tier, such as Garchomp and Rillaboom. Its coverage is limited but effective, with different options to trap additional foes. However, Magnezone is held back offensively due to its low base Speed, leaving it revenge killed by the many faster Pokemon with super effective coverage. Its lack of longevity is also fairly limiting, denying it a defensive niche despite its great defensive typing. Further, Magnezone can't trap all relevant Steel-types with one set, forcing it to pick certain targets to trap.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>If paired with Tapu Koko, Choice Specs Magnezone can opt to run Rising Voltage for an Electric-type STAB move that is extremely hard to switch into. Its reliance on Electric Terrain makes it somewhat inconsistent, but the reward is worthwhile. Rising Voltage's power also lets Magnezone run Choice Scarf over Choice Specs, but Choice Scarf sets still lose a lot of wallbreaking power overall and can't outspeed Pokemon such as Dragapult, Zeraora, and Tornadus-T. Choice Specs Magnezone can potentially run Analytic as its ability for extreme power, but sacrificing Magnet Pull and Magnezone's primary niche is not recommended. Teleport is another option on the Choice Specs set to pivot on Pokemon immune to Volt Switch. This comes at the cost of a key coverage move, though, and Flash Cannon already heavily dents some Ground-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Magnezone's 4x weakness to Ground and lack of coverage, especially on the Body Press set, make it very hard to break past and avoid revenge killing from Ground-types. Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill all greatly threaten Magnezone with their STAB moves, but they don't appreciate switching into Choice Specs Magnezone's Flash Cannon, which lessens their pressure a little bit. Swampert and Gastrodon resist both of its STAB types, making them some of the hardest Ground-types to break immediately.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: With such a low base Speed, middling special bulk, and weaknesses to common attacking types, Magnezone is fairly easy to revenge kill with Pokemon such as Dragapult, Volcarona, and Kartana, or any super effective coverage.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Galarian Slowking is one of the best walls to Magnezone, as its high Special Defense, resistance to Body Press, and strong Fire-type coverage allow it to pivot into and take on most Magnezone sets.

Ferrothorn is the main target, as it is one of the best defensive Steel-types that resists Electric and Steel, but this set is still able to trap typical targets like Skarmory and Corviknight with Thunderbolt. Substitute is very useful to block common status moves such as Ferrothorn's Leech Seed and get one more hit off after taking down a Steel-type. Toxic allows Magnezone to badly poison switch-ins such as Landorus-T and Swampert that can exploit Magnezone, while Teleport allows for Magnezone to gain momentum against them and other Ground-type Pokemon instead.</p> <p>With how easily Magnezone can remove Skarmory, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn, among other foes, physical setup sweepers such as Rillaboom, Kartana, Garchomp, and Dragonite can be much more effective. Iron Defense Magnezone will typically have a hard time breaking through Pokemon that aren't Steel-types due to the lack of offensive investment, meaning it needs strong defensive pivots to help when it gets in a bad position. Teammates like Rotom-W and Slowking can pivot into strong Fire-type attacks from Pokemon like Heatran and Galarian Slowking, while Ground-type answers such as Corviknight and Landorus-T can cover Magnezone against attackers like Garchomp and opposing Landorus-T. Magnezone also appreciates strong wallbreakers to stop walls from taking momentum after it traps a foe, so Pokemon like Kyurem, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Weavile are good fits to break foes it can't even when boosted.</p>"

Its decently powerful STAB moves combined with Choice Specs and a Modest nature make it very hard to wall, as Electric-type answers without reliable recovery such as Landorus-T and Garchomp cannot switch into Flash Cannon reliably. Volt Switch is an incredible tool for Magnezone, allowing it to pivot around special walls such as Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Ferrothorn to bring in stronger wallbreakers against them and chip them for itself later. Its Volt Switch is also very spammable because Flash Cannon deters Ground-types from switching in. Toxic is an unfavorable move to be locked into but is a great midground option against potential switch-ins like specially defensive Hippowdon and Swampert. Body Press lets Magnezone pick off Ferrothorn and Blissey after they've been chipped, and Steel Beam is a very high-risk, high-reward option that can even take down tanks such as Blissey and Galarian Slowking after they've been chipped. Magnezone is fine sacrificing itself with recoil after doing its trapping job. A Modest nature gives Magnezone a big general boost in power and more favorable damage rolls, such as always 2HKOing specially defensive Tyranitar with Flash Cannon. A Timid nature, however, allows Magnezone to outspeed some targets such as defensive Heatran and Scizor.</p> <p>Rillaboom, Tapu Koko, and Mandibuzz are all great VoltTurn partners to let Magnezone continually switch in, especially Rillaboom, which baits in Steel-types for Magnezone to trap.

Unfortunately, Tangrowth still has issues against certain physical attackers such as Weavile, Galarian Zapdos, and Buzzwole, and its abysmal special bulk leaves it open to threats such as Kyurem, Tapu Lele, Calm Mind Clefable, and Heatran. Tangrowth also is vulnerable to Future Sight, which invalidates its ability to wall Pokemon it would usually check. It also faces stiff competition from Ferrothorn as a defensive Grass-type, as Ferrothorn carries Spikes, which allows it to support its teammates and threaten entry hazard removers with Knock Off.

Sludge Bomb hits opposing Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu, but it isn't as important as the other moves on its set. Tangrowth can opt not to use an item at all to have a better matchup against Knock Off users like Swords Dance Kartana and Rillaboom, notably avoiding an OHKO from a boosted Bisharp or Crawdaunt. Protect acts as extra security for Future Sight Pokemon and is commonly seen on bulkier builds to ensure longevity during the long term.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Volcarona doesn't appreciate switching into Knock Off or a status move, but it can easily get rid of Tangrowth offensively, especially if it is a Safeguard variant, as it doesn't fear status and can burn Tangrowth for using Knock Off with Flame Body. Other Fire-types such as Heatran and Victini are just as threatening, but neither appreciates switching into a Knock Off or status.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: While they can't switch in, Ice-types such as Weavile and Kyurem pose a massive threat to Tangrowth, as they can outspeed and deal massive damage to it. The former should be wary of potentially hitting a Rocky Helmet set, especially with Triple Axel, as it will take massive damage as a result.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Once Tangrowth has put a foe to sleep, there are very few options that it has against Steel-types such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Scizor, which easily take Focus Blast.

However, special threats must watch out for Sleep Powder and Knock Off. Other Pokemon such as Life Orb Garchomp and Dragapult can threaten Tangrowth with Fire Blast or Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Entry hazards limit the recovery that Tangrowth gets from Regenerator and therefore significantly impede its ability to consistently check Urshifu-R and other physical attackers. Other Pokemon like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill can carry Toxic and use it to whittle down Tangrowth while mitigating Regenerator's recovery, making it much harder to check them throughout the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Knock Off provides great utility for Tangrowth, removing items from common switch-ins such as Heatran, Zapdos, and Tapu Koko. Focus Blast mainly serves to hit Steel-types like Kartana, Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Bisharp to force them out. Sleep Powder helps with Tangrowth‘s passivity issue by preventing free opposing setup, incapacitating threats, and letting a teammate switch in freely. Stun Spore is an alternative to Sleep Powder that can incapacitate threats permanently, unlike Sleep Powder. Rocky Helmet allows Tangrowth to chip down physical attackers and Pokemon trying to pivot with U-turn such as Rillaboom, Zeraora, Kartana, and Urshifu-R.</p> <p>Tangrowth fits best on defensive teams that appreciate a bulky Grass-type that can check Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. They also benefit from having a reliable and consistent check to physical attackers, particularly wallbreakers like Bisharp and Urshifu-R, that can force progress with Knock Off and generate opportunities for its teammates. Ground-types work well with Tangrowth, as they appreciate it taking on Water- and Grass-types like Urshifu-R, Rillaboom, and Kartana. Hippowdon, Garchomp, and Gastrodon work well to check most threatening special attackers like Heatran. Tangrowth's meager Special Defense requires having partners that can take on special attackers: specially defensive Heatran and Galarian Slowking are excellent teammates that can take care of Zapdos, Life Orb Clefable, and Tapu Lele. In return, they appreciate Tangrowth taking care of physical attackers, such as Landorus-T, Zeraora, and Urshifu-R. Slowking can form a Regenerator core with Tangrowth to handle threats like Heatran and Tapu Lele. Having entry hazard removal is very useful, as entry hazard damage can put Tangrowth in range of some of the tier's stronger wallbreakers, such as Swords Dance Kartana. Corviknight is a great partner on bulkier builds, as it can alleviate pressure for Tangrowth by checking Rillaboom and Kartana, while Zapdos can check Tornadus-T, which is really good at exploiting Tangrowth‘s low Special Defense. Additional checks to physical attackers that Tangrowth can't handle are also beneficial; Toxapex can take care of Weavile, while Corviknight alongside a revenge killer such as Weavile can stop Swords Dance variants of Garchomp or Landorus-T. Corviknight can also alleviate pressure by helping Tangrowth against Rillaboom + Magnezone cores as well as Grass-type spam cores.</p>"

Along with its arsenal of threatening status moves, these factors make it an amazing support option for bulky offense teams, where it is able to easily grab momentum and pivot into threatening offensive teammates while heavily punishing Ground-types attempting to block its Volt Switch. It also has unique defensive utility in checking, most notably, Heatran and Tornadus-T, but also Ground-types like Excadrill and Landorus-T. However, Rotom-W lacks reliable recovery, and it is dependent on Pain Split and Leftovers to consistently pivot and check offensive threats throughout a game, letting it be easily overwhelmed by repeated hits from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Heatran. This problem worsens after a Knock Off from one of the Pokemon it most commonly checks, like Landorus-T or Tornadus-T, or when it is statused by Heatran or Excadrill. Rotom-W faces competition from Slowking as a defensive pivot because of Slowking's reliable recovery with Slack Off and Regenerator, useful guaranteed slow pivoting with Teleport, and access to Future Sight, an invaluable tool for offensive teammates. Swampert is also able to set Stealth Rock, spam its unblockable Flip Turn, and check Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zeraora better while still checking Heatran.</p>",

Will-O-Wisp is also common to pressure Garchomp, Tapu Koko, and Zeraora, and it can provide amazing utility against Leftovers-reliant walls like Ferrothorn.

Unfortunately, Excadrill is very frail, and its Speed is mediocre if not boosted by Sand Rush or Rapid Spin, making it easily revenge killed by strong priority moves from Pokemon such as Rillaboom and Urshifu-R as well as by faster Pokemon like Garchomp and Kartana.

On hyper offensive teams, Excadrill can be used as a suicide lead entry hazard setter with Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin, and Steel Beam, but it is typically outclassed in this role by Landorus-T, which can utilize a powerful Explosion, and Mew, which is faster and has access to Spikes and Taunt. Excadrill can use some alternative items to Leftovers. For example, Heavy-Duty Boots allows Excadrill to switch in without taking damage from entry hazards, which can be helpful if using Rapid Spin. However, Excadrill is already immune to Toxic Spikes and resistant to Stealth Rock, meaning that the chip damage is not usually significant. An Air Balloon is another item that can be used on Sand Rush variants to allow Excadrill to set up against some Ground-types like Hippowdon, Garchomp, and Landorus-T that would usually force it out, but it isn't useful otherwise, and Excadrill will be unable to take advantage of its defensive typing if it wants to keep its item intact. Additionally, Excadrill is worn down more quickly without the passive recovery of Leftovers.

All of them can be worn down if Excadrill hits them with Toxic, though, and if Excadrill carries an Air Balloon, it can potentially set up on the Ground-types.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Rillaboom easily revenge kills Excadrill with its priority Grassy Glide, and it is of particular annoyance because Grassy Terrain weakens Earthquake. Urshifu-R and Weavile can also revenge kill it with Aqua Jet and Ice Shard, respectively, and many other Pokemon faster than Excadrill outside of sand can OHKO it, such as Volcarona and offensive Garchomp.

        "description": "<p>Ferrothorn is the best Spikes setter in the tier thanks to its ability to threaten common forms of entry hazard control like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Mandibuzz with Knock Off. Alternatively, Stealth Rock can be used over Spikes if your team lacks a Stealth Rock setter; however, Ferrothorn will have a harder time breaking through defensive cores. Leech Seed is Ferrothorn's main source of recovery and is particularly helpful because it makes Ferrothorn, which is usually a passive Pokemon, much harder to switch into. Maximum HP and Defense investment allows Ferrothorn to check Weavile, Zeraora, Melmetal, and other physical attackers well.</p> <p>Ferrothorn fits on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate the defensive utility it provides as a Spikes setter. Wallbreakers such as Dragapult and Nidoking appreciate the entry hazards Ferrothorn sets up and can pressure revenge killers such as Zeraora and Weavile. Clefable and Heatran both have great defensive synergy with Ferrothorn, as they can wear down common checks such as Corviknight. They, alongside other Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T, can also help Ferrothorn by allowing it to run Spikes. It's incredibly important to provide checks to Fire-type Pokemon such as Heatran and Volcarona, as Ferrothorn is extremely vulnerable to them. Therefore, Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Garchomp are fantastic partners for it. Fast pivots such as Tornadus-T and Tapu Koko provide VoltTurn support and retain momentum against Pokemon like Corviknight and Mandibuzz, which only fear Knock Off from Ferrothorn, while benefiting from it setting up Spikes to further pressure their defensive switch-ins like Heatran and Galarian Slowking. They can also give Ferrothorn opportunities to set up entry hazards and utilize Knock Off more reliably after pivoting against its checks such as Corviknight and Zapdos. Rain teams also deserve a special mention, as they have formidable synergy with Ferrothorn; Ferrothorn provides Spikes support to wear down the opposing team for rain wallbreakers like Volcanion, Kingdra, Seismitoad, and Barraskewda, it acts as a great check to many Pokemon that threaten rain teams such as Tapu Koko and Rillaboom, while rain reduces its weakness to Fire.</p>"

  "Mandibuzz": {
    "overview": "<p>Mandibuzz's typing separates it from other defensive Flying-types through its ability to check Dragapult. Its great bulk and access to Roost also allow it to check common threats like Rillaboom and Kartana. It is a good Defog user, with Foul Play pressuring common Stealth Rock users like Landorus-T and defensive Garchomp, although it loses to them in the long run due to their moves like Toxic and Knock Off. Foul Play also discourages physical wallbreakers like Rillaboom, Kartana, Dragapult, and Excadrill from setting up. Since it is reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots, Pokemon that it otherwise reliably checks, like Kartana and Rillaboom, can pressure it more effectively after using Knock Off. Due to the number of threats it can check, it can often be overwhelmed during the course of a match, which forces it to use Roost very often. Its reliance on Foul Play to check certain threats can leave it rather passive as well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mandibuzz with Toxic over Defog can work on teams with pre-existing forms of entry hazard control. This set is very good at annoying and punishing opposing Mandibuzz, Kyurem, Tapu Koko, and Zapdos, which can take advantage of it switching in. Whirlwind can be a good choice over U-turn to stop Mandibuzz from being setup fodder against sweepers like Volcarona, Tapu Fini, and Reuniclus. Taunt is also a good option over U-turn, since it can also prevent setup and stop Pokemon from setting entry hazards on Mandibuzz; it additionally allows Mandibuzz to win PP wars even though common entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes have more PP than Defog. However, without U-turn, Mandibuzz becomes a lot more passive and can be taken advantage of by Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Kyurem.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Offensive Electric-types</strong>: Offensive Electric-types like Zeraora and Tapu Koko can force out and pressure Mandibuzz very well with their STAB moves, and Tapu Koko can switch in for free, but Zeraora dislikes Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Ice-types</strong>: Offensive Ice-types like Kyurem and Weavile can threaten to KO or set up on Mandibuzz, as they force it out and can find opportunities to switch in as it uses Defog. However, both of them dislike switching into Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Pokemon that Mandibuzz can check like Excadrill, Landorus-T, and defensive Garchomp often carry Toxic, which they can use as it pivots in, hurting its longevity. Toxic also forces it to use Roost more often, which can deplete its PP more quickly and give it less opportunities to use Defog. Other status conditions like burn and paralysis, especially from Dragapult, can hurt its ability to check threats as well. Status chip damage, along with weaker attacks like U-turn from the likes of Landorus-T and Rillaboom, can be enough to overwhelm Mandibuzz.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Some Pokemon that Mandibuzz is able to check like Landorus-T, Rillaboom, and Kartana carry Knock Off, which is extremely detrimental because it can be left unable to wall certain threats after Stealth Rock damage.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mandibuzz operates best as a mixed defensive Pokemon to check a plethora of threats like Rillaboom, Kartana, and Dragapult. Foul Play enables it to threaten Swords Dance users like Garchomp, Rillaboom, Excadrill, and Kartana while also discouraging them from setting up. Roost gives it longevity to better check threats like Dragapult and Choice Band Rillaboom, which would easily overwhelm Mandibuzz otherwise. U-turn lets it keep up momentum and pivot out on its checks like Kyurem and Tapu Koko to safely bring in its teammates. Knock Off can be a good choice instead to immediately punish its switch-ins. The EVs are used to survive two Draco Meteors from Choice Specs Dragapult and two Smart Strikes from Choice Band Kartana. The remaining EVs are put into Speed to outspeed Azumarill.</p> <p>Landorus-T makes a good partner, since it can help alleviate pressure by covering physical threats like Excadrill and Garchomp that Mandibuzz can struggle with. Mandibuzz can also do the same for Landorus-T by checking offensive Grass-types like Kartana and Rillaboom. Similarly, Slowking can handle special threats that Mandibuzz can struggle with, like Nidoking and Tapu Lele. Mandibuzz also offers Slowking a switch-in to Ghost-type moves from threats like Dragapult. Mandibuzz's ability to lure in Tapu Koko and Kyurem and pivot on them can let Dragapult threaten a KO on them, and Dragapult also likes it switching into opposing Dragapult. Wallbreakers like Kyurem and Nidoking that have a difficult time switching in can take advantage of Mandibuzz's slow pivoting.</p>"

  "Hydreigon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hydreigon's high Special Attack and wide movepool give it unique power to punch holes by threatening common defensive Pokemon such as Slowking, Heatran, and defensive Landorus-T. This is further complemented by its decent Speed allowing it to outpace common offensive Pokemon such as offensive Landorus-T, Urshifu-R, and Tapu Lele. On top of all this, Hydreigon's defensive typing, ability, and Roost let it check Heatran extremely effectively and come in on slower defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Slowking with ease. However, although Hydreigon has passable Speed, it is still outpaced and OHKOed by common Pokemon such as Dragapult, Weavile, and Tapu Koko. It will also often be checked by some Pokemon such as Fairy-types, which it struggles to break through without Flash Cannon, and Blissey, which it can't do much to without Nasty Plot boosts.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hydreigon's movepool has options to cover certain defensive Pokemon at the cost of the neutral coverage its listed options provide; for instance, Superpower lets Hydreigon lure in Blissey and 2HKO it. Choice Scarf Hydreigon is a decent offensive pivot with U-turn and can also function as a revenge killer, but it oftentimes doesn't want to be locked into any of its attacks. Substitute improves Hydreigon's matchup versus offensive teams, as it eases prediction when forcing switches, as well as scouting Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T. Substitute also allows Hydreigon to shield itself from status effects from Pokemon such as Toxapex. A bulkier set with Defog is a viable option to check Heatran even better, as well as other Pokemon such as Blacephalon, but it is passive and overall very niche.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Hydreigon's 4x weakness to Fairy makes Pokemon of this type solid checks to it. Clefable and Tapu Fini can survive any attack from full health and OHKO or heavily damage Hydreigon in return; however, Clefable is OHKOed by +2 Flash Cannon, and Tapu Fini can become too worn down to be able to pivot into Hydreigon's attacks. Rarer Unaware Clefable sets tend to check it better. Tapu Koko easily outspeeds Hydreigon and OHKOes it, although it can't pivot into Earth Power. The rarer Choice Scarf Tapu Fini also outpaces Hydreigon and OHKOes it.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey can tank just about any attack Hydreigon uses, up to a +4 Life Orb Draco Meteor, and cripple it with status or use Teleport to gain momentum.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Kartana and Tornadus-T can easily outpace Hydreigon and pick it off if it is chipped a little bit. Weavile can outpace and OHKO Hydreigon, while Zeraora can also pick off a chipped Hydreigon. Common Dragon-types such as Dragapult, Sand Rush-boosted Dracozolt, and Garchomp all outpace Hydreigon. The former two can easily OHKO with Draco Meteor, while Garchomp can potentially OHKO it with Life Orb-boosted Scale Shot.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Hydreigon is prone to being worn down by status effects from Pokemon it commonly pivots against, such as Toxapex and Slowbro. This is also compounded by how often in can pivot into Heatran's Magma Storm. Because of this damage, Hydreigon can be pressured into using Roost too often.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R, Hawlucha, and Galarian Zapdos can all pivot into Hydreigon's attacks due to the rarity of Draco Meteor and OHKO it. Pokemon that run Fighting-type coverage, such as Rillaboom and Aegislash, which Hydreigon should be otherwise able to pivot into, threaten it as well.</p>",

      "Three Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>Dark Pulse's acceptable power and overall solid coverage let Hydreigon consistently pressure Pokemon such as Slowking and Ferrothorn and consistently damage the majority of the tier. Earth Power OHKOes Heatran, hits Toxapex and Melmetal for super effective damage, and hits most Dark-resistant Pokemon neutrally. Flash Cannon provides coverage for Clefable while still hitting Tyranitar for super effective damage. Roost is mandatory to consistently pivot into Pokemon such as the aforementioned Heatran, Toxapex, and Slowking. Draco Meteor can be used over Flash Cannon or Earth Power to heavily dent most Pokemon, better pressure Mandibuzz as well as defensive Dragonite, and OHKO Urshifu-R, although the Special Attack drop usually forces Hydreigon to switch out after. Flamethrower can also be used over either coverage move to better pressure Corviknight. Life Orb is the best item for this set, as it allows Hydreigon to OHKO Heatran as well as 2HKO Clefable and Slowking. However, if your team needs Hydreigon's defensive capabilities, Leftovers lets it stay around longer, pivot into Heatran's Magma Storm more consistently, and negate burn damage from Pokemon such as Toxapex and Slowbro.</p> <p>Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Kartana put both Ferrothorn and Corviknight in 2HKO range of Dark Pulse by using Knock Off as they switch in; in return, Hydreigon offers a consistent switch-in to Heatran, which can be especially helpful if either one of them is Choice locked into a Grass-type move. Zeraora and Dragapult, when paired with Hydreigon, can overwhelm shared checks such as Clefable and Ferrothorn. Steel-types such as Corviknight, Scizor, and Heatran can check Fairy-types and appreciate Hydreigon checking Heatran; Heatran can also help overwhelm Tyranitar and Hippowdon. Pivots that can bring Hydreigon safely are solid teammates as well; Tapu Koko can lure in Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Hippowdon and use U-turn to bring Hydreigon in. Corviknight is another U-turn pivot that can lure in Rotom-W and Toxapex for Hydreigon. Slowking and Blissey can also pivot with Teleport, and Slowking can help overwhelm foes with Future Sight in combination with Hydreigon's attacks; the two also have decent defensive synergy with Hydreigon. Toxapex has good defensive synergy with Hydreigon and appreciates it stopping Heatran from trapping it. Clefable appreciates Hydreigon checking Heatran and can even heal status effects from it, like Toxic poison from Heatran and Toxapex, with Aromatherapy.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot grants Hydreigon absurd wallbreaking capabilities, allowing it to fully overwhelm Pokemon such as Scizor and Corviknight. Dark Pulse is the primary attack thanks to its decent coverage and power, hitting Pokemon such as Corviknight, Zapdos, and Landorus-T. Earth Power is a coverage option that immediately threatens Heatran and lets Hydreigon break through Tyranitar after a Nasty Plot boost, although Flash Cannon can potentially OHKO Clefable after a Nasty Plot boost and still hit Tyranitar super effectively. Roost is crucial to help Hydreigon better function as a stallbreaker as well as pivot into Heatran, Toxapex, and Slowbro consistently. Life Orb gives Hydreigon a noticeable boost to its power, allowing it to OHKO Corviknight and Clefable with one boost. However, Leftovers is a viable choice to improve its longevity, as Hydreigon still has decent power after a boost and may appreciate pivoting better and possibly setting up on the aforementioned Heatran and Slowbro. Hydreigon can opt for a Modest nature for more power, hitting benchmarks such as a guaranteed OHKO on Clefable with +2 Flash Cannon, although it loses out on the ability to outpace many notable Pokemon such as Tapu Lele. Draco Meteor is an option over Earth Power or Flash Cannon, as it has absurd power after a Nasty Plot boost, although its Special Attack drops and lack of coverage hinder it as an option. Focus Blast and Flamethrower are also viable options in that third moveslot to better pressure Ferrothorn as well as either Tyranitar and Blissey or Corviknight, respectively, although they have little use outside of this.</p> <p>Pivots such as Landorus-T and Slowking can lure in Corviknight and Ferrothorn, respectively, to pivot out and bring Hydreigon in. Depending on whether Hydreigon forgoes Earth Power or Flash Cannon, it will be fully checked by either Tapu Koko or Clefable; this makes Galarian Slowking a decent teammate, as it can stomach attacks from these Pokemon. Galarian Slowking can also use Future Sight to punish Steel-type switch-ins such as Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Ironically, Corviknight and Skarmory make for decent teammates, as they can check Garchomp and Kartana; Corviknight, once again, can lure in Pokemon such as Zapdos and bring in Hydreigon with U-turn, while Skarmory can provide Spikes to wear down Hydreigon's checks such as Tapu Fini. Cleaners such as Rillaboom and Weavile appreciate Hydreigon pressuring and softening up common defensive cores such as Corviknight + Slowking early-game.</p>"

Regenerator lets Tornadus-T make progress against an opposing team with Knock Off, ignore small amounts of chip damage, and pivot with very little risk while utilizing Heavy-Duty Boots. It can also support itself and its teammates by using Knock Off to pressure common switch-ins like Zapdos and Galarian Slowking to make wallbreaking easier. However, Tornadus-T can struggle against Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Zeraora because of their ability to switch in and force it out with super effective STAB moves and, in the former two's case, reliable recovery.

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tornadus-T can utilize Superpower on its pivot set to bait and punish common specially defensive switch-ins like Tyranitar, Blissey, and Heatran better than Focus Blast. On rain teams, Tornadus-T commonly runs Weather Ball instead of Knock Off on its Nasty Plot sets to consistently hit Heatran and provide a strong, accurate neutral move. It can also run Choice Specs or Life Orb to have more immediate power with the heavy drawback of taking damage from Stealth Rock and not being able to switch moves or taking constant damage with every attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos and Tapu Koko, in particular, are reliable checks to Tornadus-T. They can safely switch in and threaten it with super effective Electric-type moves, have reliable recovery in Roost, and are resistant to most of Tornadus-T's coverage options. Zapdos can also threaten to neutralize Tornadus-T through a Static paralysis on an attempted Knock Off or U-turn. Zeraora can also situationally check it, although its lack of recovery makes it an inconsistent switch-in.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Although Tornadus-T is a great check to both Rillaboom and Kartana, it can be gradually weakened over time with entry hazards pressure and Knock Off removing its Heavy-Duty Boots. This may result in it being overwhelmed, especially when facing Choice Band variants.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types like Weavile, if pivoted in safely or revenge killing, can threaten Tornadus-T and force it out if it is unboosted.

Its immense role compression as a Defogger, revenge killer, Grass-type check, pivot, and Knock Off user makes it incredibly versatile and justifiable on almost any team. Heat Wave retains Tornadus-T's ability to hit Kartana and Rillaboom super effectively while also threatening Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Corviknight at the cost of being unable to threaten Urshifu-R. Knock Off is necessary to remove any form of longevity from common switch-ins, most notably Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Melmetal. Alternatively, Toxic can be used to further cripple the likes of Zapdos and Tapu Koko trying to switch in. Taunt allows Tornadus-T to shut down recovery and status moves from Pokemon such as Toxapex, Clefable, and Gastrodon, and stops Stealth Rock attempts from the likes of Mew, Heatran, and Blissey, as well as Pokemon like Swords Dance Garchomp and Cosmic Power Mew from setting up. Finally, Icy Wind can be used to punish Dragon Dance Dragonite and Swords Dance Garchomp trying to set up, and heavily damages Landorus-T. Regenerator grants it the longevity to spam Knock Off against defensive Pokemon using Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots and pivot with little risk with U-turn on forced switches, clearing the way for teammates to break through walls, as well as giving it more opportunities to pivot and use Defog with less fear of chip damage. 168 Speed EVs allow Tornadus-T to outspeed Latios, Latias, and Gengar, which also include notable targets like Kartana and Adamant Weavile. The remaining EVs are invested into Defense to take on Kartana and Urshifu-R better, but investing it into Special Defense instead is also an option to more easily take hits such as Dragapult's and Blacephalon's Shadow Ball.</p> <p>Tornadus-T's ability to consistently pivot makes it very effective on momentum-based VoltTurn cores with Pokemon like Landorus-T and Tapu Koko, especially paired alongside wallbreakers such as Nidoking, Tapu Lele, and Crawdaunt that deal heavy damage when safely switched in. Knock Off's ability to cripple Steel-types and other common specially defensive switch-ins can help specially offensive wallbreakers or sweepers such as Choice Specs Tapu Lele, Calm Mind Clefable, and Tapu Koko win in the long run. Electric-immune Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Garchomp provide insurance against common checks to Tornadus-T like Zapdos and Tapu Koko. They also provide utility with Stealth Rock that will help whittle down teams after items are removed through Tornadus-T's Knock Off. Zeraora can also situationally switch into these Electric-types and appreciates Tornadus-T's U-turn support and pressure on Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Tornadus-T can provide sweeping opportunities for offensive Landorus-T and Garchomp sets by pivoting out of common Steel-type switch-ins like Heatran and Melmetal and letting Landorus-T or Garchomp set up on a forced switch.</p>"

Focus Blast lets Tornadus-T hit Tyranitar and Steel-type switch-ins such as Heatran super effectively. Knock Off is used as a consistent means of punishing defensive switch-ins like Zapdos, Heatran, and Blissey by removing their item to force progress and make them more vulnerable to other threats in the long run.

They can also pressure some of Hawlucha's checks, like Slowbro and Hippowdon, with their STAB moves. Finally, Dragapult and Hawlucha can form an offensive core that can be hard to manage. Dragapult pressures key targets like Zapdos or Toxapex and forces damage on them with its powerful STAB moves; it can also offer setup opportunities with U-turn, as it gets forced out by Pokemon that Hawlucha wants to use as setup fodder, like Blissey and Tyranitar.</p>"

  "Toxapex": {
    "overview": "<p>Toxapex is one of the best defensive Pokemon in the OU metagame. With its amazing defenses, great defensive typing, wide support movepool, reliable recovery, and Regenerator, Toxapex is both very hard to wear down and able to check common metagame threats such as Melmetal and Scizor. Thanks to these qualities, Toxapex is able to fit on numerous balance and stall teams as a defensive pivot. Its high number of utility options allow Toxapex to wear down and cripple many of the metagame's top threats such as Mandibuzz, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, making it a hard Pokemon to switch into despite being a defensive Pokemon. Toxapex unfortunately has trouble exerting offensive pressure due to its underwhelming offensive stats; therefore, its only ways of making progress will be spreading status such as poison and burn and removing items with Knock Off.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Poison Jab allows Toxapex to hit Tapu Fini for consistent damage, which would potentially beat Toxapex with a Calm Mind set otherwise. Shed Shell can be used to prevent being trapped by Magma Storm Heatran, which would otherwise beat Toxapex due to the combination of Magma Storm, Earth Power, and Taunt. Light Screen is an option on more defensive teams to weaken an impending Future Sight that would otherwise break through the defensive core it fits in. Block can be used alongside Spite to both trap PP stall opposing Toxapex, crippling them significantly throughout the course of the game. Toxapex can use an alternative spread of 252 HP / 144 Def / 112 SpD to take hits from Tornadus-T much better while avoiding the OHKO from Timid Nidoking's Earth Power. It can use a Relaxed nature in order if it's using both Scald and Knock Off on the same set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Latios and Tapu Lele can threaten out and overwhelm Toxapex with their STAB moves; however, none of them want to switch into a Toxic, Scald, or Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Tapu Koko and Zapdos are examples of Pokemon that can threaten to OHKO Toxapex or deal serious damage to it. Zapdos in particular can remove Toxapex's Toxic Spikes; however, both need to be cautious of being heavily crippled by status effects or item removal.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Nidoking can deal heavy damage against it with their STAB moves; however, all of them can be worn down with Scald, and the former two can be potentially crippled by a burn, which can make them much less effective throughout the course of the game.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt is very detrimental to Toxapex, as it can be effectively shut down; Taunt users such as Tapu Fini and Heatran can render Toxapex useless and easily take advantage of it by using it as setup fodder in Tapu Fini's case or outright eliminate it through trapping in Heatran's case.</p> <p><strong>Future Sight</strong>: Future Sight can be troublesome for Toxapex. Slowbro, Slowking, and Galarian Slowking can open the door for wallbreakers such as Choice Band Melmetal and Kartana with a Future Sight, as Toxapex will be overwhelmed by the combination of Future Sight damage and their attacks.</p>",

Haze prevents Toxapex from being used as setup fodder by Pokemon like Dragonite, Calm Mind Clefable, Volcarona, and Suicune. Toxic is great for putting Pokemon such as Slowbro, Tornadus-T, Hydreigon, and Mandibuzz on a timer, allowing Toxapex's offensive teammates to overwhelm them, while Toxic Spikes is an option for wearing down grounded Pokemon like Garchomp, Rillaboom, and Tapu Fini as well as defensive Pokemon like Tyranitar and Tangrowth; unfortunately, it can easily be removed, cannot target vital non-grounded Pokemon like Mandibuzz and Hydreigon, and is often absorbed by Poison-types such as opposing Toxapex and Galarian Slowking, which makes it inconsistent at spreading status. Lastly, Baneful Bunker is great for crippling Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Rillaboom attempting to pivot against Toxapex and scouting Choice-locked Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Tapu Lele, as well as potentially racking up additional Black Sludge recovery. Rocky Helmet allows Toxapex to punish Pokemon such as Rillaboom and Kartana while also punishing U-turn attempts from Pokemon such as Corviknight and Dragapult. Black Sludge can be used as an alternative item to gain additional recovery at the end of each turn while also helping Toxapex in Trick scenarios by crippling the Trick user. A Bold nature is generally preferred; however, an Impish can be used if Toxapex uses Knock Off over Scald.</p> <p>Teammates like Dragapult and Rillaboom appreciate Toxapex's ability to spread poison and remove Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from Pokemon like Moltres, Mandibuzz, and Hydreigon. Bulky Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn can be very useful for Toxapex; Heatran hard checks most of the Psychic-types in the tier, as well as being able to potentially trap and remove them with Magma Storm, whereas Ferrothorn covers Toxapex's Psychic- and Electric-type weakness and appreciates Toxapex covering its Fire- and Fighting-type weakness; in return, and run Knock Off to free up a moveslot on Toxapex for another utility option. Dark-types such as Obstagoon, Hydreigon, and Mandibuzz can be very useful, as they can cover Toxapex's Future Sight weakness, making it less prone to being overwhelmed by it. Setup sweepers such as Suicune are very weak to Toxic Spikes, so they appreciate Toxapex's ability to absorb them.</p>"

These traits make it a great pick for offensive teams that need innate speed control and a reliable check to fast, offensive Pokemon such as Tornadus-T. However, Tapu Koko has rather underwhelming offensive stats and limited coverage options, meaning that bulky Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Galarian Slowking can be very problematic. Furthermore, Tapu Koko doesn't have especially good bulk, which means that it'll take a lot of damage from any decently strong attack. Even resisted hits wear it down quickly and can force it to use Roost.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Specs set with Grass Knot to hit bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert can be used in order to increase Tapu Koko's offensive potential. However, it's more reliant on prediction and worse at checking Pokemon like Tornadus-T. Dual screens can be used on hyper offense teams to support setup sweepers, but these teams aren't as common or consistent as other teams Tapu Koko is found on. Taunt can be used to help against defensive Pokemon like Blissey and Clefable, although it's hard to justify over Tapu Koko's other moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types like Ferrothorn and Tangrowth are great answers to Tapu Koko thanks to their bulk and resistance to Thunderbolt. Rillaboom can also threaten to revenge kill Tapu Koko with Grassy Glide after changing the Terrain, although it should be wary of switching into Dazzling Gleam, U-turn, or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp are immune to Tapu Koko's strongest move and can threaten it out although they dislike taking a Dazzling Gleam or Toxic. Excadrill and Nidoking are notable, as they are immune to or resist Tapu Koko's STAB moves while being immune to Toxic; however, their poor bulk means they can be worn down over time.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Blissey and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking can switch into Tapu Koko by virtue of their high Special Defense. Galarian Slowking can threaten it out with a super effective STAB attack, while Blissey can use Toxic or pivot into a teammate.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Dragapult, especially its Choice Specs set, can outspeed and threaten to KO Tapu Koko. Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T and Kartana can do the same, although none of these Pokemon can reliably switch in. Priority moves such as Bullet Punch from Scizor and Ice Shard from Weavile can pick off Tapu Koko if it's at low HP.</p>",

Additionally, it's super effective against Dragon-types like Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Latios that resist Thunderbolt. It's also the best option for damaging Electric-immune Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Zeraora. U-turn allows Tapu Koko to reliably pivot against Ground-types like Landorus-T and keep up momentum against switch-ins such as Ferrothorn. Roost allows Tapu Koko to stay healthy throughout a match in order to check Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Zapdos more consistently. Toxic can be used instead of Dazzling Gleam to cripple Pokemon like Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Tangrowth that can be problematic for Tapu Koko and is especially useful alongside teammates such as Garchomp and Kartana.</p> <p>Tapu Koko is often used on offensively oriented teams. Its ability to keep up momentum is appreciated by a multitude of strong wallbreakers that struggle to find effective opportunities to switch in such as Kartana, Choice Specs Kyurem, and Nidoking, which can be safely brought in via U-turn against the bulky Grass-types like Tangrowth and Ferrothorn that switch into Tapu Koko. Heatran also takes advantage of Grass-types that Tapu Koko forces in, can set Stealth Rock to wear down the opposing team, and use Toxic to cripple Pokemon like Hippowdon and Swampert that wall Tapu Koko. Additionally, it can trap and remove Blissey with the combination of Magma Storm and Taunt. Offensive Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana appreciate that Tapu Koko can switch in and take advantage of their defensive checks like Corviknight and Mandibuzz while also being a good answer to Tornadus-T. Furthermore, they can work together to overwhelm other checks like defensive Tangrowth. Landorus-T can set Stealth Rock and use U-turn to bring Tapu Koko in against Pokemon like Corviknight and Slowbro while also being a good check to some opposing Ground-types. Slowbro and Slowking can both use Future Sight and Teleport to help Tapu Koko put pressure on the opposing team, especially against Ground-types that might try to switch into it.

Its strong defensive typing lets it check Landorus-T, Urshifu-R, and Zeraora. Grassy Terrain provides it with some form of longevity and mitigates Life Orb’s recoil; furthermore, many teammates appreciate the passive recovery and weakening of Earthquake. However, Tapu Bulu often struggles to compete with Rillaboom for a team slot, as it offers priority in Grassy Glide and can support its teammates with Knock Off and U-turn. Tapu Bulu's middling Speed tier also gives it issues when setting up against offensive teams and lets many faster threats force it out.</p>",

Corviknight can pressure Tapu Bulu with Brave Bird, while Skarmory can phaze it with Whirlwind. Tangrowth can weaken it with Knock Off and chip it down with Rocky Helmet. However, they can easily be overloaded due to Tapu Bulu’s high Base Power coverage and boosted strength. Buzzwole is a big roadblock for Tapu Bulu, able to take any hits after a boost and force it out with Ice Punch or recover with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Tapu Bulu's Speed tier leaves it vulnerable to faster Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Volcarona, Kartana, and Weavile, which can force it out.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Stealth Rock and Spikes constantly chip down Tapu Bulu, and its lack of reliable recovery outside of bulky sets makes it get worn down easily. U-turn from Pokemon it otherwise beats such as Landorus-T and Urshifu-R can cause further chip damage, leaving it prone to being overwhelmed in trying to check them.

Close Combat allows Tapu Bulu to hit Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Stone Edge is great coverage to hit Pokemon that resist its other moves like Zapdos, defensive Dragonite, and Mandibuzz. Life Orb guarantees OHKOs at +2 on Mandibuzz and defensive Dragonite when Multiscale is inactive. Leftovers is an alternative over Life Orb, as it stacks with Grassy Terrain for better longevity, though the reduced damage is very noticeable. Jolly is the preferred nature to allow it to be faster than defensive Zapdos and neutral nature Rillaboom, but Adamant is also an option for more damage output. An EV spread of 32 HP / 252 Atk / 224 Spe can be used along with an Adamant nature, which makes Tapu Bulu faster than positive nature Aegislash and Magnezone, while the HP gives it an extra point of recovery while Grassy Terrain is up.</p> <p>Tapu Bulu best fits on offense and bulky offense teams in need of a strong wallbreaker that can offensively check the likes of Landorus-T, Zeraora, and Urshifu-R.

Volcarona, Heatran, and Tornadus-T can threaten Tapu Bulu, so switch-ins for them such as Slowking and defensive Dragonite can cover for it while alleviating its pressure to check Urshifu-R. The former is also able to handle faster wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele and Tornadus-T, while the latter is able to provide Tapu Bulu Heal Bell support. Tapu Koko is able to lure in targets that Tapu Bulu takes advantage of like Ferrothorn and Hippowdon and bring it in with U-turn out while providing a great check to Tornadus-T. Magnezone can remove Corviknight and Skarmory so Tapu Bulu doesn't have to force its way past them, and it benefits from Grassy Terrain decreasing the damage of Earthquake. Kartana is a great partner alongside Tapu Bulu, overwhelming teams once Tapu Bulu removes Flying-types like Zapdos, defensive Dragonite, and Mandibuzz with its powerful coverage.

    "overview": "<p>Tapu Fini is an excellent defensive presence in the OU metagame thanks to its typing and solid bulk, which allows it to check notable threats such as Weavile, Urshifu-R, Heatran, and Hydreigon. It can use Choice Scarf sets to switch into and threaten Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Dragapult, or it can take advantage of common defensive Pokemon such as Slowking, Toxapex, and Blissey by trapping and eliminating them for its teammates or setting up on them. It also limits the progress of status-spreading Pokemon, such as Dragapult and Toxapex, with Misty Surge and boasts a wide utility movepool including Defog, Taunt, and Knock Off. However, Tapu Fini lacks reliable recovery, meaning it can be worn down very quickly, especially if the common Knock Off removes its Leftovers or it runs Choice Scarf. If it has to check multiple threats, it may therefore need a secondary check to them. Many of the Pokemon it wants to switch into, such as Dragapult and Urshifu-R, carry U-turn to wear it down further. While Tapu Fini has many useful resistances, common faster offensive threats like Rillaboom, Tapu Koko, Kartana, and Zeraora exploit its typing. It faces competition from Slowbro, Slowking, and Toxapex as a defensive Water-type and Clefable as a defensive Fairy-type, which can also utilize Calm Mind sets. However, Tapu Fini differentiates itself with its unique combination of utility options, its rare and valuable ability, and it simultaneously checking Pokemon such as Heatran and Weavile.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A more defensive Choice Scarf set with Whirlpool, Moonblast, Nature's Madness, and Trick can be used to trap passive Pokemon similarly to Whirlpool sets, and it still allows Tapu Fini to outspeed and threaten many Pokemon. Such a set should use an EV spread of 252 HP / 116 SpD / 140 Spe with a Calm nature. Tapu Fini can also use a utility set with Knock Off and either Defog or Taunt, but it is usually outclassed by other Defog users like Corviknight and other Water-types like Slowking and Toxapex, which have superior longevity and, in the case of Corviknight, can better pressure most Stealth Rock setters.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Galarian Slowking</strong>: Galarian Slowking completely walls Tapu Fini and gets an almost completely free Future Sight off or hits it back with Sludge Bomb. However, it can be worn down if its Assault Vest is lost to Trick or Knock Off and doesn't like being Choice locked, though using Trick will limit Tapu Fini heavily, as it will be unable to use non-attacking moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Common Pokemon like Zeraora, Tapu Koko, Kartana, and Rillaboom can outspeed and deal heavy damage to non-Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, and they survive at least one attack from Choice Scarf sets.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn can switch into Tapu Fini and hit it hard with Power Whip or wear it down with Leech Seed, though sets lacking Power Whip can be trapped in and KOed by the Whirlpool set, and it strongly dislikes Trick. While Corviknight doesn't offensively threaten Tapu Fini and hates being burned, it can take its attacks fairly well and pivot into a revenge killer. Melmetal avoids the 2HKO from any move and can 2HKO in return with Double Iron Bash or Thunder Punch. Kartana resists Tapu Fini's STAB moves and can OHKO it with Life Orb- or Choice Band-boosted Leaf Blade, but its horrendous special bulk means Tapu Fini nearly 2HKOes it.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Often, the best way to beat Tapu Fini is to exploit its lack of consistent recovery with chip damage such as Future Sight from Slowbro, Slowking, and Galarian Slowking, which are often paired with Pokemon it wants to check like Urshifu-R and Weavile. Both aforementioned wallbreakers can also wear it down over time with their strong attacks. Knock Off from Pokemon like Weavile and Clefable removing its Leftovers, entry hazards, and U-turn from Dragapult, Urshifu-R, and Corviknight are also effective.</p>",

Taunt might look like a strange choice on a Choice item set, but it prevents Toxapex and Slowking from pivoting into it freely and bulky setup sweepers like bulky Volcarona and Dragonite from setting up on it. Defog can be used instead on teams that require situational hazard control. 216 Speed EVs are used to outspeed +1 Dragonite, but the EV spread is customizable; for example, maximum defensive investment can be used if a team has another revenge killer, and Special Attack EVs can allow Tapu Fini to OHKO Pokemon like Weavile and Dragapult.</p> <p>This set fits on offensive teams that do not require Tapu Fini's full defensive utility and appreciate the role compression of a revenge killer, situational switch-in to Pokemon like Dragapult, Urshifu-R, and Weavile, and potential Defogger. Pokemon that take advantage of Tapu Fini's ability to lure in and cripple Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Toxapex, such as Volcarona and Nasty Plot Tornadus-T—which also help against Rillaboom and Kartana—are ideal teammates. Ferrothorn can set Spikes to wear down opposing Pokemon into Tapu Fini's KO range and pressure Water-types like Slowking. It also switches into Tapu Koko for it.

Nature's Madness provides consistent damage on bulkier Pokemon such as the aforementioned ones it can trap, as well as switch-ins like Galarian Slowking. Taunt is necessary so that Pokemon like Toxapex, Blissey, and Slowking cannot use their recovery moves or pivot out with Teleport. Knock Off can be used over Moonblast to lure in Galarian Slowking and remove its Assault Vest while wearing Toxapex down more quickly by removing its Black Sludge or Shed Shell, but this makes Tapu Fini unable to reliably check Weavile and Urshifu-R. The EVs allow Tapu Fini to survive three Choice Band-boosted Close Combats from Urshifu-R and two Choice Specs-boosted Shadow Balls from Blacephalon from full health.</p> <p>This set can fit on a wide variety of teams, but, as its main purpose is to trap and eliminate certain defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Blissey, and Slowking, it should be used with Pokemon that appreciate them being removed. Weavile is a great option, as Toxapex and Ferrothorn are common checks to it, and it beats Grass-types and Galarian Slowking for Tapu Fini. Urshifu-R can similarly benefit from Toxapex and Slowbro being removed, and it eases prediction against teams with Ferrothorn. Volcarona and Dragonite can check Grass-types for Tapu Fini, and both can sweep much more easily with Toxapex removed. Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp can switch into Electric-types for Tapu Fini and like its ability to check Weavile and Urshifu-R.

Scald is weaker than Surf, but it discourages Pokemon not protected by Misty Terrain, such as Landorus-T and Rillaboom, from switching in due to the threat of a burn. Draining Kiss is preferred over Moonblast to make Tapu Fini less easily worn down, but Moonblast can be considered for its greater immediate power. 140 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Bisharp and Timid Magnezone. The Defense EVs and Bold nature are used because Calm Mind already boosts Tapu Fini's special bulk.</p> <p>Magnezone is a great teammate for Tapu Fini because it can trap and eliminate Ferrothorn, one of the most common counters to Tapu Fini, as well as other Steel-types like Corviknight that can pivot into it when it is unboosted.

Knock Off lets it cripple common Flying- and Fire-type switch-ins, like Zapdos and Volcarona, by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots. Kartana is extremely effective at wallbreaking for other Pokemon that it shares Flying- or Grass-type checks with, including Garchomp and Rillaboom. However, it can be hindered by contact-based abilities and items like Zapdos's Static, Volcarona's Flame Body, Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, and Corviknight's Rocky Helmet. Swords Dance and Choice Band sets are commonly revenge killed by faster threats such as Dragapult and Zeraora after they're switched in safely via a defensive pivot like Mandibuzz or Corviknight. Choice Scarf sets can be easily shut down by physically defensive walls like Tangrowth, Corviknight, and Skarmory without the power boost given by Swords Dance or Choice Band. Kartana faces competition from other wallbreakers and wincons like Garchomp, Bisharp, and Rillaboom because they are more difficult to revenge kill through their use of Speed boosting or priority. Garchomp and Bisharp can also use their good defensive typings when setting up, while Kartana is limited because of its frailty.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Kartana can opt to run Aerial Ace to greatly damage Buzzwole and Volcarona. Some Swords Dance Kartana, especially on hyper offense teams, also opt to act as a wincon by using a Timid nature, 19 Attack IVs, and maximum HP EVs, letting Kartana boost its Speed after a KO instead of its Attack. This prevents Kartana from being revenge killed by typical faster threats like Zeraora, Dragapult, and Tornadus-T at the expense of a huge portion of its power. Similarly, Swords Dance Kartana occasionally runs Adrenaline Orb to take advantage of Landorus-T trying to switch in, turning Kartana into a potent sweeper.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types like Corviknight, Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Skarmory are able to deal with the majority of Kartana's coverage. However, they are vulnerable to being worn down over time with Knock Off and entry hazard support, and they can even lose to Swords Dance sets on the spot if weakened.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Kartana has immense difficulty breaking through Skarmory, Tangrowth, and Buzzwole, which have enough Defense to check all of its sets. However, these checks can be heavily pressured by Choice Band Kartana assisted by Future Sight because of their mediocre Special Defense. In the process of KOing Kartana, they can also get weakened to the point where they are unable to check some of Kartana's cleaning teammates, like Garchomp and Rillaboom. Physically defensive Volcarona, especially on offensive teams, can threaten Kartana with Flame Body and use it as setup fodder, but it is crippled if it switches into a Knock Off and is unable to reliably take Swords Dance- or Choice Band-boosted attacks.</p> <p><strong>Contact Effects</strong>: Static from Zapdos, Flame Body from Volcarona, Iron Barbs from Ferrothorn, and Rocky Helmet on Corviknight and Skarmory can make it difficult for Kartana to make progress against these Pokemon, especially for the former two.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: For Swords Dance and Choice Band sets, an aggressive double switch on a predicted Swords Dance or a sacrifice of a teammate into a faster threat like Dragapult, Zeraora, or Tornadus-T can easily force Kartana to switch or get KOed.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Kartana is a premier wallbreaker because of its immense power. Its ability to steamroll its common Flying-type checks when boosted or slowly whittle them down with Knock Off and entry hazard support makes it nearly uncheckable. Knock Off targets Flying-type switch-ins like Mandibuzz, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T, as well as hitting Galarian Slowking and Volcarona. By removing their items, Kartana ensures that it or one of its teammates has an easier time breaking through later. Sacred Sword lets it break through Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Heatran more easily. Sacred Sword also lets Kartana beat Iron Defense Corviknight and Skarmory by bypassing their Defense boosts. Synthesis is an alternative to ensure Kartana defeats Corviknight while healing off Life Orb recoil. It is especially valuable on bulkier teams, where Kartana can be useful even after eliminating Corviknight. However, forgoing Sacred Sword results in harder matchups against other Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed and possibly revenge kill common offensive threats like Garchomp and Hydreigon. Life Orb is especially useful when trying to break through common defensive walls like Corviknight, Zapdos, and Tangrowth. Protective Pads is an alternative to bypass contact effects from the likes of Zapdos, Heatran, Volcarona, Ferrothorn, and Rocky Helmet users like Skarmory and Corviknight at the expense of a great portion of its power without Life Orb</p> <p>Swords Dance Kartana is often used on offensive teams because of its unparalleled ability to break through Corviknight, Tangrowth, and Skarmory for other cleaners like Rillaboom and Garchomp. Magnezone supports it well because it can trap Corviknight and Skarmory, enabling an easy Kartana sweep. On bulky offense teams, Heatran can set Stealth Rock to help chip common checks, including Corviknight and Tangrowth, and easily pressure Grass- and Steel-types. Cleaners like Dragonite, Weavile, and Hawlucha, alongside the aforementioned ones, can benefit from Kartana's wallbreaking ability on hyper offense teams, often with dual screens support from Tapu Koko or Regieleki.</p>"

Removing their items, especially Heavy-Duty Boots, helps Kartana and its teammates break through these foes. Sacred Sword, in addition to targeting Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran, can bypass Iron Defense boosts from Corviknight and Skarmory, letting Kartana break through them if positioned well.</p> <p>Choice Band Kartana fits well with Slowking on Future Sight-based balance or bulky offense teams because of its incredible synergy with Future Sight, which lets it easily bust through typical checks like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and even Skarmory. Slowking's Teleport also gives it safe switches for more wallbreaking opportunities. Kartana's ability to wallbreak and remove Steel- and Flying-type answers makes partners like Garchomp and Tornadus-T thrive. Magnezone can remove Corviknight, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn, making Choice Band Kartana less prediction-reliant and helping it wallbreak more easily. Because Kartana systematically removes items from an opponent's whole team, especially Heavy-Duty Boots, Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T and Heatran are solid teammates, as they set up their entry hazards while pressuring Kartana's checks with Toxic and Magma Storm, respectively.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Blacephalon stands out as an explosive wallbreaker in OU thanks to its excellent offensive stats, its STAB combination, and Beast Boost, which allows it to snowball through whole teams easily after picking off a weakened opponent. All of this, coupled with the tier's lack of sturdy Ghost checks, gives it plenty of opportunities to spam its powerful Shadow Ball and punch holes in opposing walls, defeating common defensive cores made of Pokemon like Landorus-T, Slowbro, and Heatran. Furthermore, Choice Scarf sets allow Blacephalon to act as both a cleaner and a revenge killer. On top of all this, its access to Trick makes it very hard to properly answer, as it allows Blacephalon to cripple checks like Blissey and Tyranitar. However, Blacephalon's weak defensive stats mean it has problems getting into the field, as it requires either pivot support from a teammate or a predicted double switch to start wallbreaking. This means that, if it fails to bring down its target, it is easily KOed by strong neutral hits or weak super effective attacks. Even though Blacephalon has a solid speed tier, it's not enough to get the jump on relevant threats like Weavile, Tapu Koko, Tornadus-T, Kartana, and Dragapult. This, coupled with its Stealth Rock weakness, makes it a very easy target to take down, requiring significant support to function properly.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs turns Blacephalon into a frightening wallbreaker, capable of 2HKOing or OHKOing most neutral targets. Even though Overheat has the disadvantage of dropping its Special Attack, it's a powerful nuke that deals insane damage and is able to muscle past most Pokemon that do not resist its attacks like Landorus-T, Heavy-Duty Boots Tornadus-T, and even sturdier checks like Choice Band Tyranitar. This, coupled with Trick, narrows Blacephalon's checks even further, as Trick permanently cripples Pokemon like Toxapex, Tyranitar, and Blissey. Shadow Ball is a great tool for snowballing due to the lack of Ghost-resistant Pokemon in the tier. Flamethrower is chosen over Fire Blast because of its perfect accuracy, and it 2HKOes the same targets as Fire Blast.</p> <p>Blacephalon greatly appreciates support from pivots like Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Koko that can give Blacephalon a free switch into their checks to start snowballing. Furthermore, the former two can Defog the entry hazards that cripple Blacephalon. Speaking of which, Defog support from Pokemon like Corviknight, which also offers a slow U-turn, is necessary. Blacephalon also enjoys having teammates like Tapu Fini and Ferrothorn that can pivot into possible revenge killers like Weavile and Dragapult. Other wallbreakers like Kartana and Galarian Zapdos benefit from Blacephalon's presence too, as it can KO their checks like Zapdos and Corviknight for them to wreak havoc. Melmetal is a particularly good teammate, as it can help against threats like Weavile, Tapu Koko, and Scarf Tapu Lele that try to revenge kill Blacephalon while also weakening bulky walls like Heatran. Other late-game cleaners like Weavile benefit from Blacephalon's wallbreaking prowess, easily wiping out the opposing team once they get the chance; in exchange, Weavile can soft check Tornadus-T and Dragapult. Finally, making a double Ghost core with Blacephalon and Dragapult is a good idea, as together they can break down their shared checks like Heatran and Tapu Fini, which Blacephalon can also cripple with Trick, allowing one of them to clean late-game.</p>"

Fire blast makes up for this set's lack of initial power, picking off most neutral targets after some chip damage, and unlike Overheat, it doesn't have the disadvantage of dropping its Special Attack. However, Flamethrower is a better option for late-game scenarios after Fire-resistant Pokemon like Tyranitar and Tapu Fini have been chipped, allowing for an easy clean. Trick rounds out the set, giving Blacephalon the opportunity to cripple a defensive Pokemon for its teammates if it's unable to clean efficiently in the match. A Timid Nature is chosen because it allows Blacephalon to outspeed other dangerous Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Blacephalon is best used as a late-game cleaner when it can come in and snowball once the opposing team has been weakened. Because of this, it's advised to pair it with potent wallbreakers like Swords Dance Kartana, Tapu Lele, and Urshifu-R that can weaken the opposing team. In exchange, Blacephalon can outspeed and threaten faster Pokemon that pressure these wallbreakers. Blacephalon also enjoys Knock Off and Defog support, as the former from Pokemon like Weavile can weaken possible checks like Tapu Fini and Toxapex, while the latter from Tornadus-T and Corviknight ensures it doesn't get chipped if it tries to get into the field. Finally, Dragapult is an excellent teammate, forming the classic double Ghost core with Blacephalon that lets Dragapult to spam Shadow Ball to chip foes into range of a Blacephalon sweep.

Furthermore, because of its unparalleled Speed tier, it can revenge kill the likes of Dragapult, Weavile, and Tornadus-T. Zeraora can also act as a Volt Switch absorber thanks to its ability Volt Absorb; because of this, it can easily deter other Volt Switch users such as Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and opposing Zeraora from using the move and take advantage of them to generate momentum or force progress. Unfortunately, Zeraora is pretty frail, meaning that it can't afford to switch into most attacks unlike other Electric-types like Tapu Koko, which can check Pokemon like Tornadus-T more consistently due to its reliable recovery. Zeraora also has to rely on crippling and wearing down Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp, as it cannot bypass them itself; this hurts its pivoting ability in the process.</p>",

Close Combat is great for hitting targets such as Hydreigon, Heatran, and Ferrothorn for super effective damage, as they would otherwise resist or take very little damage from both its aforementioned moves.</p> <p>Bulk Up Zeraora mainly fits on offensive teams, as the support offensive teams provide for Zeraora such as entry hazards and pivoting can give it more setup opportunities. Dual screens Tapu Koko is a great partner for it, as not only does the dual screens and pivoting support give Zeraora more setup opportunities, but the Electric Terrain increases the power of Plasma Fists, making it harder to wall. Suicide leads such as Landorus-T and Mew are very useful partners for Zeraora, as the entry hazards they provide can allow Zeraora to apply more pressure to the opposing team. Rillaboom is an excellent partner for Bulk Up Zeraora, as Grassy Terrain halves the power of Earthquake from the likes of Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon; furthermore, Rillaboom can revenge kill Excadrill in sand, while Zeraora can heavily pressure Pokemon that Rillaboom may struggle with, such as Corviknight, Dragapult, and Skarmory.</p>"

Toxic allows Zeraora to wear down Pokemon such as the aforementioned Landorus-T and Garchomp as well as Tangrowth that can reliably switch into its STAB move.

Moreover, its strong coverage moves, setup in Swords Dance, and pivoting in U-turn make it a great choice for offensive teams; it can effectively wallbreak, sweep late-game, and create momentum via pivoting out on its telegraphed switch-ins, and it also provides residual healing through Grassy Terrain. Despite all of these qualities, Rillaboom is held back by the ubiquity of Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Skarmory, Zapdos, Corviknight, and especially Buzzwole, with this exacerbated by its susceptibility to adverse contact effects such as Rocky Helmet and Static. Additionally, Rillaboom faces competition from other offensive Grass-types in the tier. Tapu Bulu’s higher Defense and Fairy typing make it a more reliable check to Landorus-T, Urshifu-R, and Zeraora, while its access to Stone Edge lets it more reliably break through Flying-type switch-ins. Alternatively, Kartana’s higher Attack stat lets it more freely wallbreak early-game, and Beast Boost lets it snowball and break past would-be counters like Corviknight in the endgame.

For example, at +2, Superpower is a guaranteed 2HKO on Corviknight after Stealth Rock, whereas Drain Punch has just a 33.6% chance to 2HKO. Acrobatics with no item is another option on the set to lure in and break past Buzzwole, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss, making way for teammates like Kartana and Urshifu-R; running no item is preferred over Grassy Seed, since Grassy Seed makes the presence of Acrobatics obvious. There is a noticeable loss in power from dropping Life Orb, however. A Choice Scarf set can be used on teams in need of revenge killing that isn't as reliant on Grassy Glide, and it can also snag surprise KOs on the likes of Dragapult early-game. This generally relies on surprise factor, though, and is hard to justify over Choice Scarf Kartana, which boasts Beast Boost to clean more effectively late-game.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Buzzwole</strong>: Buzzwole resists and tanks all of Rillaboom’s moves, even after a Swords Dance boost, while punishing attacking attempts with Rocky Helmet. This greatly limits Rillaboom’s ability to make progress in a game. Knock Off removing Buzzwole’s Rocky Helmet or Heavy-Duty Boots, however, can either make it easier to use physical attacks or increase the cost of Buzzwole switching in on Rillaboom, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Tornadus-T, Corviknight, Zapdos, Skarmory, and Mandibuzz all comfortably switch into Grassy Glide and threaten out Rillaboom with Flying-type STAB moves, Static, Rocky Helmet, Foul Play, or a mixture of the above. Crucially, they can all also punish Rillaboom switching out with Defog, which can greatly lower a team’s momentum. These Pokemon must exert caution when switching into Rillaboom at +2, though, for they all risk being 2HKOed. Moreover, Corviknight and Skarmory must be cautious of Rillaboom using U-turn to bring in Magnezone, which traps and KOes them, whereas the others severely dislike losing their Heavy-Duty Boots to Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: The likes of Corviknight, Skarmory, Heatran, Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Melmetal can discourage Grassy Glide spam and punish with options like entry hazards, U-turn, and Thunder Wave, especially against the Choice Band set.

Tapu Lele can always come in after a KO and threaten to OHKO with any of its STAB moves, while Tapu Koko can either use U-turn to pivot out of an incoming switch-in or just KO outright with Dazzling Gleam with trivial amounts of chip damage.

At +2, boosted by a Life Orb and Grassy Terrain, Grassy Glide is immensely powerful, capable of KOing virtually all neutral threats and even doing high damage to resistant Pokemon. Knock Off complements Grassy Glide well, punishing switch-ins by removing items such as the Heavy-Duty Boots of Flying-types. Wood Hammer can be opted for here instead; it is extremely powerful, often eliminating the need for prediction, and OHKOes the likes of Unaware Clefable, which otherwise frustrates both this set and hyper offense generally. Wood Hammer also inflicts high damage to Flying-type switch-ins, helping a common teammate in Kartana clean later in the game with Knock Off, therefore making Knock Off redundant on Rillaboom itself. Superpower OHKOes Steel-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal and 2HKOes Corviknight and Skarmory even when factoring in the Attack drop. A Jolly nature allows Rillaboom to outspeed and KO Modest Tapu Lele, and offensive Heatran while also getting the jump on Zapdos to pressure it with boosted Knock Offs or Wood Hammers.</p> <p>This set is best run on hyper offense builds that appreciate Rillaboom’s powerful priority and ability to break past defensive checks. Superpower helps soften Skarmory and Corviknight to let physical attackers like Urshifu-R and Weavile sweep later.

Magnezone stands out as the single best partner for Rillaboom, punishing and discouraging predictable switches into Skarmory and Corviknight so it can more freely attack.

Knock Off hits Grass-resistant foes on the switch for high damage and crucially gets rid of items like Tornadus-T’s Heavy-Duty Boots and Corviknight’s Rocky Helmet, setting up easier wallbreaking opportunities as the game progresses. If Rillaboom is paired with Kartana, omitting Knock Off for Superpower is optimal, since Kartana is better poised to wallbreak with its own Knock Off if the opposing Flying-types' items are intact. Superpower is useful for targeting Steel-types like Melmetal, Ferrothorn, and Heatran that otherwise switch into Grassy Glide. For the final slot, U-turn is a hard-hitting pivoting tool that can bring in partners such as Magnezone, Blacephalon, and Heatran to punish the common Steel-type switch-ins Rillaboom forces. It generates momentum throughout the game, something competitors in Tapu Bulu and Kartana are unable to do. Rillaboom is also reasonably bulky and healed by Grassy Terrain, giving it opportunities to switch in and pivot out against weaker, resisted attacks like Landorus-T’s Earthquake without sacrificing its longevity too much.</p> <p>This set is most appropriate in bulky offense builds. As always, Magnezone is a standout partner as an incredible recipient of U-turn’s pivoting, heavily limiting the opponent’s ability to effectively utilize Corviknight and Skarmory. Heatran appreciates Grassy Terrain to heal and weaken Earthquakes from the likes of Galarian Slowking. It can open up Rillaboom by trapping and removing non-Shed Shell Toxapex, preventing it from scouting Rillaboom's Choice-locked move. Heatran also easily sets Stealth Rock versus nearly all of the Flying-types in the tier, which is especially useful in conjunction with Rillaboom’s Knock Off. Swords Dance Kartana greatly benefits from Grassy Terrain boosting the power of its Leaf Blade and can break through physical walls like Corviknight, setting up Rillaboom to clean with Grassy Glide in the endgame. Entry hazard support such as Stealth Rock from Landorus-T and Spikes from Skarmory helps slowly wear down the opponent's team for Grassy Glide to sweep later. Finally, Urshifu-R can capitalize on Rillaboom’s U-turns out of incoming Heatran and Melmetal.

Furthermore, a neutrality to Stealth Rock and the ability to switch in favorably against most entry hazard setters in the metagame, such as Landorus-T, Clefable, and Garchomp, makes Corviknight a great Defog user. Unlike Zapdos and Tornadus-T, it is not reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots, so it is effective even after being hit with Knock Off. Corviknight's best ability, Pressure, in tandem with Roost, lets it stall out moves such as hazards and weak attacks from the Pokemon it checks effectively. However, Corviknight is often forced to click Roost to stay healthy, leading to a loss of momentum. It also exhibits very little offensive pressure, often relying on one offensive moveslot to help it check foes. Opting for Body Press makes Rillaboom more difficult to deal with, while Brave Bird weakens its matchup against Kartana and Bisharp. Opponents can take advantage of this by sending out Pokemon that resist its main move, forcing Corviknight to switch. Furthermore, Corviknight is especially prone to being trapped by Magnezone, which can open up a major hole in its team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Bulk Up set with maximum HP and Special Defense EVs, a Careful nature, and a moveset of Brave Bird / Bulk Up / Substitute / Roost is an option for a bulky wincon. This set is especially effective at Pressure stalling opposing Pokemon thanks to its sturdy Substitutes. 200 Speed EVs on the Defog set allow Corviknight to outspeed maximum Speed Modest Magnezone and use U-turn to avoid getting trapped. The loss of bulk is very noticeable, however. Iron Head is also an option to deal super effective damage to Fairy-types. However, it is very weak outside of this and an inferior option overall. Taunt can be used to prevent status moves like Leech Seed from Ferrothorn and Thunder Wave from Clefable, and it can also defend the team against setup sweepers in a pinch, but it has very little use otherwise.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Strong Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong special attackers such as Thunderbolt Tapu Lele easily 2HKO Corviknight. Dragapult can also fish for a Special Defense drop with Shadow Ball if it gets in safely. However, Dragapult and Tapu Lele take a big chunk from Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type Coverage</strong>: Common Pokemon such as Zeraora, Tapu Koko, and Zapdos threaten Corviknight with super effective moves. Electric-type coverage moves on Clefable, Melmetal, and Tapu Lele allow these Pokemon to break through Corviknight as well. Magnezone gets a special mention because it traps Corviknight with Magnet Pull and easily beats it, which can open up a major hole in its team.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Heatran is one of the few Stealth Rock users able to beat Corviknight and keep entry hazards on the field. Volcarona threatens Corviknight with its STAB attacks and sets up on variants lacking Brave Bird. Corviknight also invites in Victini, giving it a free turn to use one of its strong attacking moves. Fire-type coverage lets Dragapult and Garchomp break through Corviknight as well. However, Heatran takes a good chunk from Body Press and Volcarona and Dragapult dislike Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Contact punishment from Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin or Iron Barbs is problematic for Corviknight. Furthermore, if hazards are on the field and Corviknight keeps getting forced out before being able to use Defog, the repeated Stealth Rock damage makes its job of switching into Pokemon it's supposed to check more difficult.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The listed EV spread allows Corviknight to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Tapu Lele's Psychic after Stealth Rock damage as well as the 2HKO from Choice Specs Dragapult's Shadow Ball from full HP. Maximum HP and Defense EVs is an alternative, although it takes considerably more damage from special attacks. Body Press OHKOes Bisharp and Weavile while also dealing decent damage to incoming Steel-types such as Heatran and Magnezone. U-turn is what makes Corviknight a great pivot, allowing it to keep momentum against Pokemon that switch in to it. Brave Bird is an alternative that hits Rillaboom, Urshifu-R, and Volcarona for super effective damage and prevents it from being setup fodder for the latter. However, teams especially weak to physical setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Garchomp and Kartana can make use of Iron Defense to completely wall those Pokemon while also making Body Press stronger. Corviknight's ability to wall most hazard setters makes it an excellent Defog user. Leftovers helps check more Pokemon in the long run thanks to the passive recovery. Rocky Helmet deals chip damage to U-turn and Knock Off spam and dissuades Urshifu-R from using Surging Strikes. Corviknight is often switching in on Knock Off from Pokemon such as Weavile, Bisharp, Rillaboom, and Kartana, so its item rarely lasts the entire match.</p> <p>Many team archetypes appreciate Corviknight as a Defogger thanks to its strong defensive presence and pivoting ability. Defensive teams greatly appreciate its longevity and ability to take Knock Off, while more offensive teams take great advantage of its pivoting. Corviknight appreciates Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon switching into Electric-type attacks from Zeraora, Tapu Koko, and Zapdos that threaten it. These Pokemon also threaten Heatran, one of the few Stealth Rock setters able to beat Corviknight. Slowking, Toxapex, and Heatran switch into Fire-types that threaten Corviknight such as Heatran for the former two and Volcarona for the latter two. Slowking and Blissey also sponge special attacks from Pokemon such as Nidoking that Corviknight has trouble repeatedly taking, and they can safely pivot into it with Teleport against strong physical attackers that threaten them like Kartana, Rillaboom, and Urshifu-R. Another great teammate is Clefable, as it appreciates Corviknight's ability to take on physical attackers that threaten it like Rillaboom, Bisharp, and Kartana, while Clefable takes on Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Dragapult that threaten Corviknight. It also can heal status with Aromatherapy. Strong wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Urshifu-R, Bisharp, and Dragapult appreciate Corviknight's slow pivoting with U-turn getting them in safely.</p>"

  "Dracozolt": {
    "overview": "<p>In sand, Dracozolt is one of the tier's most threatening wallbreakers thanks to its great Speed and signature move Bolt Beak, which doubles in power when Dracozolt moves first. It easily beats both offensive and defensive staples like Tornadus-T, Tapu Lele, Toxapex, and Corviknight. Whether it is by trapping and weakening Pokemon like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Garchomp with Fire Spin or simply running coverage, Dracozolt can overcome traditional checks to Electric-types. Unfortunately, Dracozolt is reliant on sand, as it is very slow and easy to offensively pressure outside it. It has mediocre bulk and can be worn down quickly by entry hazards, especially with Life Orb. Finally, Dracozolt is reliant on prediction to nail switch-ins to Bolt Beak and utilize limited sand turns, which sometimes makes it very underwhelming.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fire Blast can be used over Fire Spin on the Substitute set for more immediate damage against Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Melmetal. However, it requires a lot of prediction to be effective, and these Pokemon are still able to pivot around Dracozolt, making Fire Spin's ability to trap them preferred. Taunt can be used on the Life Orb set to force out passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, but Dracozolt dislikes having to give up a coverage move for it, and it should spend its sand turns attacking. High Horsepower can replace Earthquake on teams with Rillaboom so Dracozolt is not weakened by Grassy Terrain.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Specially defensive Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert are some of the very few reliable checks to Dracozolt, tanking even Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteors and OHKOing back with Earthquake. However, Swampert is chipped down quite easily. Utility Excadrill is capable of walling Dracozolt if it does not carry Earthquake, while Sand Rush Excadrill outspeeds and revenge kills Dracozolt in sand. Defensive Landorus-T can switch into Dracozolt and force it out, but switching into Draco Meteor and Fire Spin wears it down over time. Other Ground-types like Garchomp and Nidoking can fall to Dracozolt's coverage moves, but they prevent it from freely using its strongest STAB move and revenge kill it outside of sand.</p> <p><strong>Losing Sand</strong>: Dracozolt is unable to accomplish much outside of sand due to its mediocre Speed, below almost every offensive Pokemon in the tier, so you can stall out its sand turns by switching around it or using Protect users like Heatran. However, Dracozolt can overcome these strategies if it predicts correctly. Pelipper, Torkoal, and Alolan Ninetales replace sand with their own weather as well, although they cannot directly switch into Dracozolt.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority moves like Weavile's Ice Shard, Bisharp's Sucker Punch, and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide can finish off Dracozolt even in sand if it is weakened, which is fairly likely thanks to Substitute damage or Life Orb recoil, though Dracozolt can get past them with a Substitute up. Substitute can particularly exploit Sucker Punch, and none of these Pokemon can directly switch into Dracozolt.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Although Dracozolt theoretically possesses the typing to switch into some defensive Pokemon like Slowking, Toxapex, and Zapdos, it cannot do so safely, as they can cripple it with Scald burns or Toxic. Burns weaken it, and both leave Dracozolt worn down even more quickly than usual.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Fire Spin": {
        "description": "<p>Draco Meteor is a strong secondary STAB move to hit Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Nidoking. Substitute allows Dracozolt to take advantage of the switches it forces, easing prediction, and avoid status moves from Pokemon it can trap with Fire Spin, such as Ferrothorn's Leech Seed and Tangrowth's Sleep Powder. If Dracozolt has a Substitute up, it can still safely attack one time outside of sand. Fire Spin allows Dracozolt to trap passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and especially Clefable, easing prediction, and wear down some of its checks that lack reliable recovery, like Landorus-T and Ferrothorn. 140 Special Attack EVs let Dracozolt beat defensive Landorus-T. To do this, it must hit Landorus-T on the switch with Draco Meteor, then switch out. Later in the match, the combination of Fire Spin and Draco Meteor will then be able to KO it. 184 Speed EVs allow Dracozolt to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T in sand. The remaining EVs are pooled into Attack to increase Bolt Beak's damage output. A Lonely nature guarantees that Dracozolt survives Clefable's Moonblast from full health and 2HKOes specially defensive Tyranitar with Bolt Beak, and it doesn't weaken Draco Meteor. Leftovers is the preferred item to heal off Substitute damage and weaker attacks.</p> <p>Dracozolt is used exclusively on sand cores. Consequently, Tyranitar or Hippowdon is a necessary teammate. Both of them can also set Stealth Rock for Dracozolt. Excadrill is also common on these sand cores; it can either sweep teams with Swords Dance once Dracozolt has weakened them or cripple shared checks like Tangrowth and Landorus-T with Toxic, making them even easier to trap and eliminate. Dracozolt's ability to trap Clefable and Ferrothorn is appreciated by Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Scizor, and they can give Dracozolt free turns against many of their checks like Corviknight by using U-turn. Skarmory can set Spikes, which is particularly useful for wearing down Dracozolt's checks like Hippowdon, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal as Dracozolt forces them in, and it also checks Excadrill. Dracozolt's poor bulk gives it few opportunities to switch in safely, making Teleport users like Slowbro and Slowking useful. Future Sight from either also stops many of Dracozolt's defensive checks, like Clefable and Landorus-T, from switching into it safely. Landorus-T and Corviknight are helpful teammates to check Pokemon like Excadrill for Dracozolt, and they draw in defensive Pokemon that it beats like Skarmory and bring it in safely with U-turn against them. Landorus-T also cripples Tangrowth and opposing Landorus-T with Toxic.</p>"

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>With Life Orb's damage boost, Dracozolt can effectively utilize coverage moves to hit Pokemon that resist its STAB moves. Earthquake hits Excadrill and Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zeraora, and it OHKOes Heatran, which could otherwise survive a hit and do significant damage back with Earth Power. Fire Blast hits Grass-types like Ferrothorn and the rarer Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu. 184 Speed EVs and 176 Special Attack EVs allow Dracozolt to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T in sand and OHKO SubRoost Kyurem with Draco Meteor. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack to increase Bolt Beak's damage output. A Naughty nature instead of Lonely lets Dracozolt take priority moves from Pokemon like Rillaboom and Weavile slightly better.</p> <p>Either Tyranitar or Hippowdon is required to set sand for Dracozolt. Both can check some offensive threats that Dracozolt struggles against, such as Kyurem behind a Substitute for the former and Sand Rush Excadrill for the latter. Garchomp is another Pokemon that fits on sand cores, and it appreciates Dracozolt wearing down their shared checks like Landorus-T, Clefable, and Tangrowth. Pivots like Dragapult, defensive Landorus-T, and Slowking can draw in Pokemon that Dracozolt can beat, like Mandibuzz, Corviknight, and Blissey, and bring it in safely with U-turn or Teleport to start wallbreaking. Slowking is particularly notable, as Future Sight is useful for pressuring Dracozolt's checks like Landorus-T and Clefable. Corviknight and Skarmory are consistent checks to the majority of Ground-types and Rillaboom, which often trouble sand teams. The former can also use its slow U-turn to bring Dracozolt in safely, while the latter sets Spikes to wear down its checks. Clefable can cripple faster Pokemon like Heatran with Thunder Wave, making Dracozolt not deadweight outside of sand, or support it with Aromatherapy.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Dragapult's access to status, U-turn, and STAB Hex makes it a potent disruptor and pivot capable of sweeping past chipped down teams. Additionally, its blistering Speed tier alongside U-turn lets it operate as a superb check to fast Pokemon on offensively inclined teams, being able to take advantage of forced switches with ease to generate momentum or force progress with status. Dragapult's choice of status condition is highly dependent on the needs of its team, as well as what it wishes to target. Thunder Wave typically is the preferred option, as it is capable of punishing and crippling most of Dragapult's checks, including Clefable and situationally Heatran while slowing down fast offensive Pokemon like Tornadus-T for its teammates. Will-O-Wisp, however, can be a great option that takes advantage of and ruins the value of physical attackers while negating Leftovers recovery of Hippowdon and Gastrodon and forcing passive damage on Mandibuzz. Dragapult's vulnerability to entry hazards as an offensive pivot makes it a great user of Heavy-Duty Boots, enabling it to more reliably generate momentum in the long term. Lastly, Infiltrator lets Dragapult wholly disregard dual screens and Substitute and more freely force damage and inflict status on hyper offense builds. Access to Infiltrator also allows Dragapult to disregard Safeguard Volcarona and reliably paralyze it.</p> <p>Dragapult's ability to check faster Pokemon and facilitate offensive teammates with its access to status, fast U-turn, and ability to invite in its exploitable checks makes it a phenomenal pick on balance teams. Likewise, it also appreciates offensive teammates that are able to help it handle its checks due to its relative lack of immediate power. For example, Urshifu-R is a superb teammate that highly appreciates Dragapult's ability to slow down or weaken fast, offensive threats such as Kartana and Tornadus-T while also being able to take heavy advantage of Dragapult checks like Tyranitar and Blissey for wallbreaking opportunities. Additionally, Urshifu-R is capable of pivoting against Pokemon like Slowbro and Tangrowth to give Dragapult more opportunities to spread status. Kartana, similarly, heavily appreciates Dragapult's ability to cripple potential checks while providing it with safe switch in against Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Blissey. Thunder Wave also allows Kartana to outspeed otherwise faster Pokemon like Weavile, improving its cleaning potential in the long run. Access to Knock Off can also allow Kartana to enforce progress for Dragapult and leave its checks more vulnerable to entry hazards and chip damage. Garchomp is a great offensive partner that likes having checks in Corviknight and mixed Clefable dispatched by Thunder Wave, exploits Toxapex, and takes great advantage of Dragapult's pivoting abilities while helping it deal with Clefable, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon more effectively. Landorus-T is also a great partner that can utilize both Knock Off and Stealth Rock to enforce progress for Dragapult while providing a solid switch-in against Zeraora, which may attempt to revenge kill it otherwise if it has sustained any chip damage. Lastly, Dragapult's ability to compress roles with its Speed tier to offensive check fast Pokemon, status, and cleaning make it a good fit on more defensively inclined teams alongside the aforementioned Landorus-T and allies such as Clefable and Ferrothorn that are similarly able to spread item removal and set entry hazards.</p>"
