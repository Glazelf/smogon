As they're forced out, Slowbro can use Teleport to maintain momentum and stay healthy. Scald serves as a spammable STAB attack that can cripple targets with burns, dissuading otherwise decent checks like Mega Tyranitar and physically-centric Aegislash sets from setting up. Even foes that don't rely on physical attacks, like Serperior and Latios, tend to dislike the chip from burn. Future Sight supports wallbreakers like Choice Band Tyranitar, Buzzwole, and Enamorus in breaking through their checks such as Tangrowth and Skarmory for the former two and Galarian Slowking for the latter. It also synergizes excellently with Teleport. Slack Off serves as reliable recovery that doesn't require Slowbro to switch out. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Slowbro to avoid taking damage from entry hazards, maximizing HP regained from Regenerator, though Rocky Helmet can be held instead to punish contact move users, notably foes that run U-turn like Cinderace. A Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs are used to make Slowbro as slow as possible, maximizing its odds of moving slower than opposing Teleport users. Slowbro best fits on bulky offense and balance teams looking for a reliable defensive pivot that can also generate momentum for wallbreakers. Hazard-stacking teammates like Skarmory, defensive Clefable, and Hippowdon pair up nicely with Future Sight, further putting pressure on opposing defensive cores. Many hazard-stacking teammates can also double as checks to Pokemon Slowbro struggles against, such as Clefable checking Dark-types like Hydreigon, Skarmory handling Bug- and Grass-types like Buzzwole and Meowscarada, and Hippowdon checking Electric-types like Iron Hands as well as Galarian Slowking. Similarly, pivots like Scizor and Iron Treads also check threats like Galarian Slowking while pairing nicely with Slowbro's own pivoting potential to maintain offensive momentum. If it isn't running Heavy-Duty Boots, hazard control from teammates like Hydreigon, Choice Scarf Serperior, and Iron Treads is necessary.</p> "

Bounce must be used alongside Flyinium Z to cleave through would-be counters in Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Tangrowth as well as Buzzwole. Even checks that aren't weak to Flying, like Latios, Latias, and Tapu Fini, are often taken out after one to two boosts. Ice Fang is an alternative if Gyarados isn't running Flyinium Z, providing it with the means to threaten Grass- and Dragon-types. Life Orb should be held if Gyarados isn't using Bounce, helping Gyarados OHKO foes such as Serperior with +1 Ice Fang and Tapu Fini with +1 Power Whip. Substitute can be used to take advantage of Pokemon that struggle to threaten Gyarados outside of status, like Mega Sableye. Power Whip is an alternative to threaten Water-types like Slowbro, Quagsire, and Tapu Fini, which it otherwise struggles to break through if it doesn't have access to Supersonic Skystrike. Gyarados best fits on offense teams, enjoying being paired with other sweepers like Iron Hands and Swords Dance Scizor. It supports these physical attackers by luring in and KOing common physical walls such as Buzzwole and Tangrowth with Supersonic Skystrike. Gyarados lacks the means to break through certain physical walls like Skarmory, and based on its choice of coverage it will lack the means to break through certain foes like Tangrowth and Iron Hands, making special attackers like Latios and Galarian Moltres important partners. In return, it can take advantage of some of Steel-types they tend to get picked off by like Celesteela and Scizor. Hazard support, notably from dedicated leads such as Mew and Excadrill, is very useful for chipping Gyarados's checks like Iron Hands and Choice Scarf Latias into KO range of its attacks. Conversely, Gyarados's Stealth Rock weakness means it greatly appreciates partners that can remove them or stop them from being set up, like Iron Treads and the aforementioned Mew and Excadrill. Grimmsnarl is another notable partner, as its dual screens support gives Gyarados a much easier time setting up.</p> "

With its unique defensive typing and good bulk, it can check a wide variety of foes, notably Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Fini and Grass-types such as Serperior and Tapu Bulu. Sludge Bomb serves as a spammable STAB move that can hurt the longevity of targets such as Gastrodon and Mega Sableye by poisoning them. Slack Off provides instant recovery Galarian Slowking can use without needing to switch out. Future Sight lets Galarian Slowking support wallbreakers and threaten Pokemon switching in to check it. Maximizing Galarian Slowking's physical bulk improves its ability to check physical attackers and lets it usually survive at least one Pursuit from an opposing Dark-type. 0 Speed IVs let Galarian Slowking move after its foes when using Chilly Reception, improving its pivoting capabilities. Galarian Slowking best fits on offensive teams looking for a splashable pivot and Future Sight support for wallbreakers that have difficulty coming onto the field, like Meowscarada and Mega Gallade. It struggles the most against Dark-types, which can absorb its Future Sight and threaten it. Tyranitar is a notable example due to its powerful Pursuit and Galarian Slowking's inability to hit it for neutral damage. Thus, bulky Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Buzzwole make good partners. Steel-types such as Aegislash, Iron Treads, and Celesteela also wall Galarian Slowking due to its lack of coverage, so the aforementioned Fighting-types and other checks to Steel-types, such as Fire-types like Iron Moth, are effective support.

Meanwhile, Galarian Slowking's good Special Attack and coverage mean few Pokemon are not threatened by it. Regenerator lets Galarian Slowking have a form of healing while holding Assault Vest. Sludge Bomb is a spammable STAB move that can cripple switch-ins with poison. Future Sight lets Galarian Slowking support wallbreakers while also punishing Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Gyarados that would otherwise try and set up on it. Flamethrower primarily targets Steel-types like Aegislash and Celesteela. Scald hits Ground-types and potentially cripples physical attackers and walls like Skarmory and Mega Tyranitar. This EV spread is used to guarantee that Galarian Slowking will not be 2HKOed by Latios's Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, with the remaining EVs being used to augment Galarian Slowking's Special Attack. Galarian Slowking best fits on bulky teams looking for a versatile tank that serves as a blanket check to most of the tier's special attackers. Examples of partners that appreciate this include Clefable, SubToxic Aegislash, and Gastrodon. Entry hazard removers like Tapu Fini are crucial support, as even one layer of entry hazards significantly cuts into Galarian Slowking's recovery. Galarian Slowking struggles the most against Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar, as while no physical attacker enjoys switching into its Scald or Sludge Bomb, they can easily trap it once they're on the field. Bulky Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Buzzwole and defensive walls such as Skarmory and Tangrowth can handle these foes for Galarian Slowking. Aegislash is another notable issue for Galarian Slowking, as its Ghost typing combined with its huge bulk and offenses lets it easily win one-on-one. Ground-types like Iron Treads can serve as effective checks to it.</p> "

Stone Edge is a strong STAB option that OHKOes Iron Moth while denting neutral targets such as Celesteela and Tapu Fini. Pursuit enables Mega Tyranitar to trap Psychic- and Ghost-types, like Latios and Blacephalon. Crunch offers a strong STAB move to hit bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types, like Aegislash and Mega Latias. It is also the strongest move Mega Tyranitar has to hit Galarian Slowking. Superpower is an option to snipe opposing Tyranitar and severely damage would-be switch-ins such as Excadrill and Iron Treads. 176 Speed EVs enable Mega Tyranitar to outspeed Aegislash and Celesteela. Offensive Fighting-types such as Buzzwole, Blaziken and Keldeo, appreciate Mega Tyranitar removing bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types. In exchange, Buzzwole covers Mega Tyranitarâ€™s weaknesses to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, while Keldeo can bring Mega Tyranitar in safely with Flip Turn. Other teammates such as Iron Moth and Serperior offer some defensive synergy and appreciate Mega Tyranitarâ€™s ability to remove Psychic- and Fire-types, respectively. Mega Tyranitarâ€™s typing gives its weaknesses to prominent attacking types such as Fighting, Water and Ground, so Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Galarian Slowking can provide switch-ins to these types. The Future Sight support provided by the latter meshes well with Pursuit and dissuades Buzzwole and Iron Hands from switching in. Celesteela and Skarmory can help check Excadrill, Iron Treads, and Buzzwole, with Skarmory providing Spikes as a bonus. Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Aegislash can all check Fighting-types to some degree. Aegislashâ€™s immunity to Fighting-type moves makes it an excellent partner to Mega Tyranitar, and it also eases the burden of checking Mega Latias, enabling Mega Tyranitar to run Superpower. Together they can wear down shared checks like Ting-Lu. Due to its lack of reliable recovery, Mega Tyranitar is vulnerable to being chipped down, so partners such as Choice Scarf Latias and Choice Band Scizor can ease the burden against frail sweepers such as Polteageist and Nihilego.

Crunch is an alternative STAB option for Air Balloon Aegislash that also hits Mega Latias, Gastrodon, and Slowbro hard. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Cinderace with a single Dragon Dance. Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar is usually found on bulky offense or hyper offense since these structures provide adequate tools to facilitate setup. The main hindrances for Mega Tyranitar are physically defensive walls like Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Clefable. Teammates like Serperior, Tapu Fini, Swords Dance Scizor, and Meteor Beam Celesteela can take advantage of these Pokemon. Serperior can lure in and use Glare against faster Pokemon that can outspeed +1 Mega Tyranitar, such as Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Mega Aerodactyl. Mega Tyranitar can also be revenge killed by common Fighting-types like Buzzwole, Keldeo, and Iron Hands even after a boost. Teammates such as Polteageist, Latios, and Aegislash offer valuable typings and can soft-check Fighting-types. In turn, they appreciate Mega Tyranitarâ€™s ability to take advantage of specially defensive walls such as Blissey. Offensive Steel-types such as Iron Treads and Scizor can cut a Mega Tyranitar sweep short, and thus Fire-types like Blaziken, Cinderace, and Iron Moth are excellent partners. Magnezone deserves a special mention, as it traps Scizor and Skarmory. Sand Rush Excadrill appreciates Mega Tyranitarâ€™s Sand Stream ability and in exchange offers insurance against Unaware Clefable. Mega Tyranitar is vulnerable to chip damage and thus appreciates pivoting support from Cinderace, Magnezone, Scizor, and Meowscarada. Slowbro and Galarian Slowking can bring in Mega Tyranitar safely with Teleport and Chilly Reception and offer Future Sight support for Buzzwole. Finally, dual screens support from Grimmsnarl and Alolan Ninetales eases setup, while Spikes from Ting-Lu, Meowscarada, and Mew wear down walls.</p> "

U-turn, besides allowing Cinderace to maintain momentum by bringing in a teammate like Hydreigon, can also wear down defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro. Gunk Shot gives Cinderace useful coverage for Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Mega Altaria, and it also lets Cinderace force out Calm Mind Clefable more reliably. Alternatively, High Jump Kick is an option to OHKO Mega Tyranitar and Hydreigon, as well as 2HKO physically defensive Ting-Lu, which U-turn cannot do. Sucker Punch lets Cinderace revenge kill chipped sweepers such as Agility Iron Moth and Z-Celebrate variants of Victini after their respective boosts while also threatening Choice Scarf users such as Blacephalon. Cinderace fits best on offensive teams that can supply it with the tools needed to break through defensive Pokemon; entry hazard setters such as Mega Tyranitar, Ting-Lu, and Iron Treads can support Cinderace in this manner, with Mega Tyranitar also being able to trap Slowbro and Skeledirge with Pursuit after Cinderace pivots against them. Similarly, defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela, Slowbro, and Tapu Fini appreciate Cinderace's ability to threaten out the likes of Aegislash, Meowscarada, and Scizor; in return, they can help sponge the Water- and Ground-type moves aimed at Cinderace or provide Future Sight or Taunt support in the case of the latter two.

Protean increases the damage output of its coverage moves, making them better suited at pressuring targets such as Mega Latias, Galarian Zapdos, and Hydreigon. Knock Off allows Meowscarada to remove important items from walls such as Clefable, Celesteela, and physically defensive Tangrowth, allowing it to break through them more easily.

In addition to this, Knock Off cripples defensive walls such as Scizor and Amoonguss by removing their respective items, while also serving as Meowscarada's most common move to use against neutral targets. U-turn allows Meowscarada to rack up momentum against Pokemon it forces out, such as Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Tapu Fini.

Defensive pivots such as Scizor, Galarian Slowking, and Blissey, are also essential to let Meowscarada enter the field safely against more preferable targets, while also being great Pokemon to fall back on when faced with opposing revenge killers, such as Choice Scarf Latias and Enamorus.

Flower Trick, especially in conjunction with Overgrow, allows Meowscarada to deal significant damage to neutral foes before fainting, most notably 2HKOing Stealth Rock Clefable.

Speed control, namely powerful priority users like Scizor and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Fini and Hydreigon, can also help eliminate physical attackers. Physical wallbreakers like Iron Hands and Aegislash can help against Blissey and Chansey, which wall Iron Moth. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge both wall Iron Moth, so Ghost- and Dark-types, notably Pursuit users like Mega Tyranitar, can remove them for it.</p> "
