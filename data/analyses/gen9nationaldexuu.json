        "description": "<p>Despite Mega Beedrill initially seeming like a good Pokemon thanks to its exceptional Attack and Speed stats, great ability in Adaptability, and access to U-turn, it is completely unviable. While U-turn can grab momentum against foes such as Latios and Serperior, and Poison Jab has some utility in targeting Fairy-types like Clefable, Bug and Poison is an atrocious STAB combination that has no way to break through common defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon and Buzzwole, and it notably struggles to even touch Steel-types. Skarmory and Celesteela stonewall Mega Beedrill, and while other Steel-types dislike Drill Run and Knock Off, virtually every Steel-type, from Iron Treads to Excadrill, can usually beat Mega Beedrill one-on-one. As a pivot, Mega Beedrill suffers massively due to its Stealth Rock weakness and inability to hold Heavy-Duty Boots, which makes it very over-reliant on hazard control, or else it'd be worn down rapidly. Mega Beedrill's paltry defensive stats and terrible typing give it practically no defensive utility, rendering it extremely vulnerable to Choice Scarf users such as Galarian Zapdos and priority moves like Scizor's Bullet Punch and Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Pursuit is another seemingly useful option, with its ability to outpace the likes of Choice Specs Latios and Mega Latias working well in tandem with Mega Beedrill's ability to hit them super effectively. However, Mega Beedrill is outclassed as a Pursuit trapper by Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Tyranitar, both of which have a much better offensive and defensive presence thanks to their better typings. For teammates, entry hazard removers like Iron Treads and Tapu Fini are mandatory. Special attackers that can remove or chip physical walls, such as Iron Moth and Thundurus-T, are necessary to let Mega Beedrill have any hope of threatening the opposing team. Magnezone is notable for its ability to trap and remove Skarmory and Celesteela. Entry hazards from setters like Ting-Lu and Skarmory can chip Mega Beedrill's targets and help it actually KO its targets. Overall, Mega Beedrill is an offensive threat that loses to most foes and requires excessive amounts of support to function properly; thus, it is far too difficult to apply to standard teams to be considered viable.</p>"

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Clefable’s excellent utility, movepool, and defensive typing allow it to function as a powerful defensive piece. Its excellent pure Fairy typing creates favorable matchups versus Pokemon such as Latios, Meowscarada, Buzzwole, and Iron Hands. Clefable acts as a Toxic immunity thanks to Magic Guard and also possesses a permanent immunity to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and sandstorm. On offensive teams, Clefable usually fills the role of hazard setter through Stealth Rock. It can use Knock Off to limit the longevity of potential switch-ins such as Celesteel, Iron Treads, and Leftovers variants of Excadrill. Thunder Wave is another useful option, adding the potential to cripple offensive threats such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, Enamorus, and Z-Celebrate Victini. Defensive teams may choose to employ a more passive variant of Clefable using Wish and Protect to provide longevity to Pokemon without access to reliable recovery such as Mega Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Celesteela. Aromatherapy is similarly useful to allow teammates to outlast the opposing team. Additionally, it allows for more aggressive play against Pokemon reliant on status such as Skeledirge, allowing for them to be safely Pursuit trapped by Mega Tyranitar. Clefable’s ability to spread chip damage through utility moves such as Stealth Rock and Knock Off lends it to supporting wallbreakers like Latios, Meowscarada, Galarian Zapdos, and Excadrill. Clefable also pairs well with entry hazard users such as Mega Tyranitar, Hippowdon, Skarmory, Meowscarada, and Sandy Shocks to wear down the opposition, as it can get rid of items from entry hazard removers such as Excadrill, Tapu Fini, Cinderace, and Iron Treads. Clefable struggles with heavy hitters able to trade powerful attacks for the chip damage inflicted by Clefable, such as Iron Moth, Excadrill, and Enamorus. This weakness is mitigated by teammates able to act as revenge killers like Meowscarada, Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, and Mega Aerodactyl. Defensive partners such as Slowbro, Celesteela, Mega Tyranitar, and Blissey can beat Steel, Poison, and Fire-types which often beat Clefable. In return, Clefable can beat Dark- and Fighting-types such as Buzzwole, Iron Hands, Hydreigon, and Meowscarada. Clefable is also a good switch-in to many Knock Off users that might cripple many of its partners, most notably Assault Vest Tangrowth and Chansey.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Clefable is a strong wincon, becoming extremely difficult to threaten once boosted. Magic Guard allows it to set up in the face of defensive Pokemon that would otherwise rely on status moves to threaten it, such as specially oriented Buzzwole, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. Leftovers is the preferred item to decrease the likelihood of running out of Soft-Boiled PP, but Life Orb can also be used in combination with Magic Guard for a significant increase in damage, helping defeat Pokemon such as specially defensive Celesteela, Taunt Tapu Fini, and Excadrill. Flamethrower is preferred to hit Steel-types such as Excadrill, Iron Treads, Celesteela, and Scizor. Thunder can also be used for passable neutral coverage in addition to the chance to paralyze foes such as Iron Moth, Hisuian Arcanine, and Mega Venusaur. Knock Off offers more permanent damage on Steel-types, removing their items such as Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots at the cost of being unable to directly break through them. Aromatherapy is often seen on stall teams in addition to Unaware, allowing Clefable to function as both the team’s cleric and wincon. Clefable naturally checking Fighting-types makes it a good teammate for Pokemon such as Excadrill and Meowscarada. Mega Tyranitar appreciates this while providing Clefable with crucial Pursuit support, trapping Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge. Offensive pivots such as Cinderace, Meowscarada, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon appreciate Clefable taking advantage of the defensive walls they might be unable to break through. Calm Mind Clefable is vulnerable to foes able to immediately threaten it such as Excadrill, Celesteela, and Iron Moth. Steel- and Poison-resistant teammates such as Celesteela, Slowbro, and Mega Aerodactyl can cover for Clefable, giving it more opportunities to set up. Unaware Clefable being pressured by entry hazards means it necessitates strong hazard control options, such as Defog Skarmory, Mega Sableye, and Salamence. A relative lack of bulk and initial power means friendly entry hazards are appreciated from teammates including Skarmory, Chansey, Hippowdon, and Jirachi that can help wear down incoming defensive Pokemon more quickly.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Slowbro's high physical bulk combined with Regenerator makes it a fantastic defensive pivot, able to check numerous physical attackers such as Cinderace, Excadrill, and Galarian Zapdos. As they're forced out, Slowbro can use Teleport to maintain momentum and stay healthy. Scald serves as a spammable STAB attack that can cripple targets with burns, dissuading otherwise decent checks like Mega Tyranitar from setting up. Even foes that don't rely on physical attacks, like Serperior and Latios, tend to dislike the chip from burn. Future Sight supports wallbreakers like Choice Band Tyranitar, Buzzwole, and Enamorus in breaking through their checks such as Tangrowth and Skarmory for the former two and Mega Venusaur for the latter. It also synergizes excellently with Teleport. Slack Off serves as reliable recovery that doesn't require Slowbro to switch out. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Slowbro to avoid taking damage from entry hazards, maximizing HP regained from Regenerator, though Rocky Helmet can be held instead to punish contact move users, notably foes that run U-turn like Cinderace. A Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs are used to make Slowbro as slow as possible, maximizing its odds of moving slower than opposing Teleport users. Slowbro best fits on bulky offense and balance teams looking for a reliable defensive pivot that can also generate momentum for wallbreakers. Hazard-stacking teammates like Skarmory, defensive Clefable, Ting-Lu, and Hippowdon pair up nicely with Future Sight, further putting pressure on opposing defensive cores. Many hazard-stacking teammates can also double as checks to Pokemon Slowbro struggles against, such as Clefable and Ting-Lu checking Dark-types like Hydreigon, Skarmory handling Bug- and Grass-types like Buzzwole and Meowscarada, and Hippowdon and Ting-Lu checking Electric-types like Iron Hands. Similarly, pivots like Scizor and Iron Treads also check threats like Clefable while pairing nicely with Slowbro's own pivoting potential to maintain offensive momentum. If it isn't running Heavy-Duty Boots, hazard control from teammates like Hydreigon, Choice Scarf Serperior, and Iron Treads is necessary.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With Choice Band, Galarian Zapdos becomes a fearsome choice for bulky offense or offense teams looking for a threat that is able to destroy even the most bulky physical walls like Skarmory and Hippowdon. Close Combat threatens a huge amount of the tier, such as staples like Mega Tyranitar and Excadrill, and Brave Bird allows Galarian Zapdos to hit defensive staples such as Buzzwole and Clefable that resist Close Combat. U-turn allows Galarian Zapdos to maintain momentum and slam Pokemon like Slowbro that can stomach both Brave Bird and Close Combat. Knock Off hits Ghost-types like Hisuian Zoroark and is also a move that can be spammed in the early game to force progress by removing Leftovers or Rocky Helmet. Defiant is a great offensive ability that allows Galarian Zapdos to punish Defog attempts from Tapu Fini and Skarmory, as well as prevent Salamence from effectively neutering it with Intimidate. Despite Galarian Zapdos's decent typing, which allows it to switch into Earthquake from Excadrill and Knock Off from Mega Tyranitar, it can struggle to switch in against the Psychic- and Fairy-type moves thrown out by Slowbro and Enamorus. Therefore, Steel-type teammates such as Excadrill, Bisharp, and Celesteela are appreciated to help take hits from these foes, and Galarian Zapdos can switch into and pressure threats such as Iron Treads and Buzzwole for them. Additionally, Galarian Zapdos can wallbreak for the former two, which can allow for them to sweep after shared checks like Skarmory are removed. Galarian Zapdos also appreciates pivot support to hit the field as often as possible, so Pokemon like Slowbro and Cinderace are good teammates. Galarian Zapdos especially enjoys pivoting in and threatening Mega Tyranitar and Bisharp that switch into Slowbro and Slowking.</p>"

      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>Bulk Up Galarian Zapdos trades the immediate power of Choice Band for the freedom to switch moves, and can therefore threaten most of the tier after a Bulk Up. Bulk Up allows Galarian Zapdos to break through physical walls such as Skarmory and Hippowdon after a boost. Brave Bird slams the Fighting resists looking to switch into Galarian Zapdos, such as Buzzwole and Slowbro, and with Flyinium Z, it becomes an incredibly powerful Supersonic Skystrike that obliterates neutral targets like Clefable and Tapu Fini and prevents the recoil damage of Brave Bird. Thunderous Kick is a great STAB move that lowers the Defense of the target, which can allow Galarian Zapdos to beat defensive Pokemon with Unaware like Quagsire and otherwise force many switches. Alongside Leftovers, it notably allows Galarian Zapdos to beat Iron Defense Skarmory. Close Combat provides more immediate power at the cost of a worse matchup into Quagsire and Iron Defense Skarmory. Substitute allows Galarian Zapdos to set up on bulky foes looking to neuter it with status, such as Hippowdon and Mega Sableye. It can also scout switches against teams reliant on dealing with Galarian Zapdos through Pokemon that resist Flying and Fighting, as well as allow it to beat faster revenge killers like Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Enamorus. Alternatively, Knock Off is an option to slam Slowking and Slowbro if needed, as well as allow Galarian Zapdos to force progress against bulkier targets like Iron Hands and Clefable. Trailblaze is another option on hyper offense teams that can allow Galarian Zapdos to leverage its Bulk Up boosts to sweep by boosting its Speed. Trailblaze also hits Quagsire harder than Brave Bird, which can allow partners on hyper offense builds like Ceruledge to sweep later in the game. Leftovers is an option on Galarian Zapdos if another teammate is using the Z-crystal, and it grants Galarian Zapdos more longevity. It pairs especially well with Substitute, as Leftovers recovery can allow for Galarian Zapdos to set up Substitute multiple times over the course of the game. Bulk Up Galarian Zapdos is mainly used on hyper offense teams and is especially great alongside Ribombee, as it can punish Defog users attempting to remove Ribombee's Sticky Web. It can also be used on balance or fat teams looking for a wincon that can attempt to set up and wallbreak multiple times in a game. Teammates like Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar and Serperior appreciate Galarian Zapdos switching into and breaking foes like Skarmory and Celesteela, respectively, so they can sweep in the late-game. Defensive Pokemon like Clefable and Gastrodon appreciate Galarian Zapdos's ability to beat slower wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Bisharp and Sinistcha, and can switch into attacks from faster threats like Enamorus and Cinderace aimed at Galarian Zapdos.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos is a very fast and powerful revenge killer that can threaten many offensive staples such as Cinderace, Meowscarada, Enamorus, and Heavy-Duty Boots Iron Moth. Brave Bird threatens common foes that resist Fighting like Clefable and Slowbro. Close Combat is Galarian Zapdos's most powerful Fighting-type STAB attack and allows it to threaten much of the tier, such as Mega Tyranitar and Hydreigon. U-turn allows Galarian Zapdos to pivot out of matchups against defensive foes it cannot break with Choice Scarf, such as Skarmory. Knock Off allows Galarian Zapdos to remove the pesky Rocky Helmet or Heavy-Duty Boots to allow teammates like Cinderace to wallbreak later in the game. The speed control provided by Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos allows it to fit on a wider range of teams, from offense to balance. Its ability to threaten common offensive threats like Cinderace and Meowscarada is appreciated by other frail offensive Pokemon like Ogerpon-C, and its ability to revenge kill powerful wallbreakers like Iron Moth and Hydreigon is appreciated by passive defensive Pokemon like Gastrodon and Celesteela. Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos appreciates entry hazard support, as it is able to force more switches with its Speed, and so partners like Clefable and Meowscarada are appreciated to set hazards and pressure defensive foes that are able to stomach hits like Slowbro. Meowscarada can also help Knock Off Heavy-Duty Boots, as well as form a U-turn core with Galarian Zapdos to maintain momentum. Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos cannot wallbreak as effectively, so strong special attackers like Enamorus and Hydreigon appreciate Galarian Zapdos luring in physical walls like Buzzwole for them to set up or launch powerful attacks on, while Galarian Zapdos can threaten special walls like Blissey and Hisuian Goodra for them in return.</p>"

It provides an important buffer against offensive threats such as Hisuian Zoroark and Alakazam while also finding setup opportunities against a large portion of defensive staples, such as Slowbro and Mega Venusaur. Nasty Plot boosts Galarian Moltres's Special Attack to absurd levels, allowing it to reliably pressure specially defensive tanks such Hippowdon and Clefable. Agility allows Galarian Moltres to outspeed common revenge killers such as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Keldeo after one round of setup while giving it the opportunity to clean up opposing teams late-game when its wallbreaking prowess with Nasty Plot isn't as necessary. Taunt, on the other hand, can be used to prevent status and healing from Pokemon such as Blissey and specially defensive Hippowdon, allowing Galarian Moltres to wear them down or use them as setup fodder. Hurricane, in conjunction with Flyinium Z, gives Galarian Moltres a powerful one-time nuke in Supersonic Skystrike that can break through neutral targets such as Blissey and Gastrodon, threatening to outright OHKO the latter at +2 while also offsetting Hurricane’s middling accuracy in the process. As Galarian Moltres can struggle to safely find setup opportunities against faster threats such as Cinderace, Enamorus, and Meowscarada, it pairs best with offensive teammates that can also complement its wallbreaking prowess; late-game cleaners such as Dragon Dance Salamence, Meteor Beam Nihilego, and Booster Energy Iron Moth capitalize on Galarian Moltres's ability to weaken specific answers, such as specially defensive Celesteela and Skeledirge, respectively, allowing them to sweep opposing teams with greater ease late-game. The latter two can also invite in and weaken Rock-types such as both Tyranitar formes and the rare Nihilego, which Galarian Moltres can struggle to break through otherwise. Galarian Moltres's Stealth Rock weakness and inability to run Heavy-Duty Boots necessitates strong anti-hazard options, leads such as Excadrill, Mew, and Meowscarada can all shut down common entry hazard setters, the former via Rapid Spin and the latter two via Taunt.</p>"

Skarmory also serves as a valuable Spikes user thanks to it being able to set up against threats such as Buzzwole, Blissey, Iron Treads, and non-Flamethrower Clefable. The combination of Iron Defense and Body Press is Skarmory’s preferred choice to make progress against teams, as it allows it to stonewall threats such as Scizor, Bisharp, and Tyranitar while also further pressuring threats such as Blissey and Hippowdon. Dropping Iron Defense and Body Press for Whirlwind or Toxic and Brave Bird respectively is also an option on more offensive teams to pressure threats such as Buzzwole and Serperior more effectively while also offering extra team support by phasing or spreading poison damage. However, this comes at the cost of being far more passive against Excadrill and lacks a proper response to Bisharp and Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar. On stall teams, Skarmory has the choice of running Defog in place of either Spikes or Iron Defense and can also run an EV spread of 248 HP / 76 Def / 184 Spe with an Impish nature to outspeed Choice Band Tyranitar, allowing it to boost or safely heal up before Tyranitar can 2HKO it. Skarmory’s main item of choice is Rocky Helmet to get residual damage off against foes with U-turn such as Meowscarada, Scizor, and Galarian Zapdos while also chipping setup sweepers such as Mega Tyranitar, but it can also run Shed Shell on bulkier playstyles such as balance and stall in order to avoid being trapped by Magnezone. Skarmory can struggle a lot against special attackers such as Latios and Enamorus, so specially defensive walls such as Blissey, Chansey, and specially defensive Skeledirge are good partners to shore up that weakness. Mega Tyranitar is another good partner, since it can switch into and Pursuit trap threats that pressure Skarmory such as Iron Moth and Hisuian Zoroark. Common pivots that take advantage of Skarmory such as Cinderace, Thundurus, and Thundurus-T also hate being Pursuit trapped by Mega Tyranitar. Skarmory also has issues against Fire-types such as Cinderace and Victini, so bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Slowking, Gastrodon, and Alomomola can help deal with them. Electric-types such as Thundurus, Thundurus-T, Sandy Shocks, and Zeraora can also threaten Skarmory, so bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon are good partners to hinder them, but bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur also work as teammates at the cost of being unable to block Volt Switch. The aforementioned Ground-types can also form strong entry hazard stacking cores with Skarmory that bulkier playstyles such as stall enjoy greatly. Offensively, wallbreakers such as Cinderace, Iron Hands, Latios, and Galarian Zapdos make for good partners, since they appreciate Skarmory's Spikes helping them chip their checks so they can wallbreak easier.</p>"

Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar is usually found on bulky offense or hyper offense since these structures provide adequate tools to facilitate setup. The main hindrances for Mega Tyranitar are physically defensive walls like Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Clefable. Teammates like Serperior, Tapu Fini, Swords Dance Scizor, and Meteor Beam Celesteela can take advantage of these Pokemon. Serperior can lure in and use Glare against faster Pokemon that can outspeed +1 Mega Tyranitar, such as Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Mega Aerodactyl. Mega Tyranitar can also be revenge killed by common Fighting-types like Buzzwole, Keldeo, and Iron Hands even after a boost.

In return, they appreciate Mega Tyranitar’s ability to take advantage of specially defensive walls such as Blissey. Offensive Steel-types such as Iron Treads and Scizor can cut a Mega Tyranitar sweep short, and thus Fire-types like Cinderace and Iron Moth are excellent partners. Magnezone deserves a special mention, as it traps Scizor and Skarmory. Sand Rush Excadrill appreciates Mega Tyranitar’s Sand Stream ability and in exchange offers insurance against Unaware Clefable. Mega Tyranitar is vulnerable to chip damage and thus appreciates pivoting support from Cinderace, Magnezone, Scizor, and Meowscarada.

Aura Sphere provides Mega Latias with important coverage against most Dark- and Steel-types, hitting Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Excadrill super effectively. Alternatively, if Tyranitar is handled adequately by Mega Latias's teammates, Mystical Fire can be used to deal more immediate damage to the likes of Scizor and Celesteela instead. Mega Latias fits best on defensive and balance teams, which can provide it with the longevity needed to gain proper setup opportunities. Entry hazard support from the likes of Skarmory and Gastrodon can help wear down opposing walls that would otherwise be difficult to break through late-game, such as Tapu Fini. Similarly, wallbreakers such as Choice Band Iron Hands and Serperior can make for good options to take advantage of these Pokemon, especially when Mega Latias lacks Mystical Fire to deal with the former. However, although Mega Latias is able to switch into Pokemon like Iron Hands, its lack of initial power can leave it vulnerable to being overwhelmed by their boosted attacks in return. Thus, Speed control options such as Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Tapu Fini, in addition to certain defensive walls like Unaware Skeledirge are extremely valuable in providing backup against such foes. Conversely, paralysis support from the likes of Serperior and Clefable is also notable, as they can limit faster Pokemon such as Meowscarada and Cinderace from being able to overwhelm Mega Latias with super effective hits late-game.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Latias is an effective form of speed control that sets itself apart from other Pokemon the same role, such as Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos, with its unique utility options. Draco Meteor serves as its main STAB attack, letting Latias revenge kill most neutral targets such as Meowscarada and opposing Latias. Psyshock is a more spammable STAB move that also lets it clean weakened teams and threaten Fighting-types as well as Iron Moth. Psychic is very similar, trading a chance to OHKO Iron Moth for a 2HKO on Iron Hands and a slightly higher damage output against most neutral targets. Healing Wish is especially helpful to bulky Pokemon that lack reliable recovery such as Iron Hands and Tapu Fini. It can also grant offensive Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar another opportunity to sweep or wallbreak. Trick is Latias's preferred fourth move, allowing it to cripple otherwise unbreakable foes such as Blissey and Chansey. An alternative is Mystical Fire, which lets Latias threaten the Steel-types that resist its STAB combination, like Iron Treads and Excadrill. Its Special Attack-lowering effect makes it especially useful against certain boosting threats such as Autotomize Celesteela. Defog is another alternative, letting Latias clear hazards for its team; however, the fact that Latias loses to most Stealth Rock users such as Mega Tyranitar and Excadrill makes it somewhat unreliable in this role. Latias fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that want a revenge killer and appreciate Latias's utility. Latias struggles the most against special walls like Blissey and Slowking, making physical wallbreakers such as Meowscarada and Galarian Zapdos mandatory partners. Fighting-types such as Buzzwole are useful to threaten Mega Tyranitar, which takes minimal damage from Latias's attacks and can trap it with Pursuit; they can also take out Steel-types like Excadrill and Iron Treads, something especially important if Latias forgoes Mystical Fire. Latias's ability to force in and cripple special walls with Trick makes a good partner for special attackers like Serperior and Clefable.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Latios is an elite wallbreaker thanks largely to its raw power. Its powerful STAB move in Draco Meteor allows Latios to demolish all but the sturdiest neutral targets, including Tyranitar, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. It can leverage its solid Speed stat versus common offensive Pokemon such as Victini, Galarian Zapdos, Sandy Shocks, and Blacephalon as well as its numerous useful resistances to create opportunities to unleash devastating moves. Psyshock is preferred over Psychic to defeat specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Chansey more easily. Trick is used on Choice Specs sets to cripple would-be walls such as Jirachi and Clefable, while Roost allows Life Orb variants to offset the item's recoil. Mystical Fire is preferred on Latios to hit Steel-types such as Excadrill, Iron Treads, and Celesteela. It can also choose to use Thunderbolt to flip important matchups such as Tapu Fini, Slowking, and physically defensive Clefable while also providing a consistent way to damage most Steel-types. Choice Specs is preferred to maximize damage output, but Life Orb can also be chosen in order to enable switching moves, at the cost of the ability to eliminate Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Hippowdon with Draco Meteor. Latios's ability to blow away physical walls makes it an excellent partner to any physical wallbreaker. Latios appreciates opportunities to fire off powerful attacks, so Pokemon with pivoting moves such as Cinderace, Meowscarada, Galarian Zapdos, and Scizor make for good partners. Latios struggles with Choice Scarf users able to force it to switch, such as Tapu Fini, Blacephalon, and Latias, as well as Pokemon able to naturally outspeed it such as Cinderace, Meowscarada, and Alakazam. These weaknesses can be alleviated with defensive pivots able to switch into these threats, such as Clefable, Celesteela, Hippowdon, and Skarmory, depending on foe. Latios also pairs well with supportive Pokemon like Clefable, Mewoscarada, Iron Treads, and Mega Tyranitar that are able to help it break through walls through utility moves such as entry hazards or Knock Off. Latios pairs especially well with Fighting-type wallbreakers such as Buzzwole, Galarian Zapdos, and Iron Hands due to their favorable matchups into the Steel- and Dark-types looking to switch into Latios's STAB moves. In return, Latios offers a Psychic resistance and a favourable matchup into physically defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory, Slowbro, and opposing Buzzwole.</p>"

Aura Sphere is chosen to threaten the only Pokemon able to survive a boosted Stored Power: Dark-types like Meowscarada, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon. Latios fits best on hyper offense teams, which require support from Pokemon such as Excadrill, Iron Treads, and lead Meowscarada that can set entry hazards for Latios to secure important KOs late-game. It struggles with strategies able to interrupt its setup without activating Weakness Policy, such as phazing moves from Skarmory and specially defensive Pokemon able to trade hits with Latios such as Scizor and Celesteela. Setup sweepers such as Serperior, Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar, and Scizor aid with overwhelming Steel-types, while Z-Celebrate Victini and Meteor Beam Celesteela can threaten the Steel-types once they have been forced in. Pokemon halted by Unaware users appreciate Latios's ability to boost past them, namely Dragon Dance Mega Aerodactyl and Swords Dance Cinderace.</p>"

This unique set of traits allows it to flourish on defensive teams, where it is able to check a number of strong special attackers such as Mega Latias and Volcanion while supporting the team with passive damage. Spikes or Stealth Rock allow Gastrodon to support its teammates by wearing down the opposing team. If the team already has entry hazards covered, Clear Smog can be used to stop common setup sweepers such as Victini and Clefable that would otherwise greatly threaten Gastrodon and its teammates. Scald is used to cripple both physical attackers and poison-immune Pokemon with a burn. Earthquake is an alternative for more immediate pressure against Poison- and Steel-types such as Okidogi and Iron Moth, but it leaves Gastrodon unable to punish switch-ins like Celesteela and Skarmory. The final moveslot is usually given to Toxic, which allows Gastrodon to slowly wear down its answers. Alternatively, Protect can be used in tandem with Leftovers to improve its longevity while also scouting common Choice-locked Pokemon such as Latios, Meowscarada, and Enamorus. Gastrodon's great special bulk and unique resistances allow it to help out Pokemon like Skarmory, Slowbro, and Tangrowth that struggle against strong Fire- or Electric-type attacks from Pokemon like Volcanion, Sandy Shocks, and Zeraora. Gastrodon can get worn down quickly through poison and burn and therefore appreciates cleric support from Pokemon like Clefable and Blissey. Its low Defense also leaves it susceptible to strong physical attackers such as Mega Tyranitar and Meowscarada, and therefore, it appreciates physical walls such as Tangrowth and Buzzwole that can handle those threats. Gastrodon is also very weak to Pokemon that use Grass-type moves such as Serperior and Iron Moth and therefore needs to be wary of coverage from Pokemon it is used to check.

The boost to Victini's defenses eases setup and makes it more difficult for priority moves such as Shadow Sneak from Ceruledge and Sucker Punch from Meowscarada to revenge kill it; in addition, it lets Victini survive attacks such as Earthquake from Excadrill, giving it the option to set up against them. At +1, Victini's Searing Shot OHKOes most Steel-types such as Excadrill. Stored Power pairs nicely with Z-Celebrate, reaching 120 BP after the latter move is used, enabling Victini to deal massive damage to Fire-resistant foes such as Mega Aerodactyl and Tapu Fini, OHKOing the former after Stealth Rock. Stored Power's Base Power rise after setting up also enables Victini to 2HKO Unaware users such as Quagsire and physically defensive Skeledirge. Focus Blast pairs well with Victini's STAB moves, hitting top threats such as Mega Tyranitar, and its poor accuracy is mitigated somewhat by Victory Star. Alternatively, Energy Ball lets Victini destroy specially defensive Gastrodon, which otherwise takes little from even a boosted Stored Power. Z-Celebrate Victini fits best on hyper offense teams as a late-game cleaner. Entry hazard support from Mew, Excadrill, Iron Treads, and lead Meowscarada can help wear down foes such as Tapu Fini and Slowbro into range of Victini's attacks. Excadrill and Iron Treads also offer Rapid Spin to remove hazards for Victini. Good offensive partners for Victini include Swords Dance Scizor and Autotomize Celesteela.

Victini is vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards and therefore appreciates entry hazard removal from Excadrill, Iron Treads, or Tapu Fini. Excadrill and Iron Treads can also set Stealth Rock to weaken Victini's checks such as Slowbro into range of its attacks. Victini also greatly enjoys U-turn or Teleport support to let it hit the field to launch its powerful V-create. Meowscarada, Scizor, and Slowbro are all good Pokemon that fulfill this role. Scizor can even trap some of Victini's checks, such as Mega Latias, with Pursuit. Since Victini can struggle to reliably pressure some of its aforementioned checks, like Slowbro thanks to Regenerator, a partner that can take advantage of them, such as Nasty Plot Hydreigon, is also appreciated. Finally, a good late-game cleaner such as Autotomize Celesteela or Serperior can finish off a team weakened by Victini.

Serperior can take advantage of the many switches it forces with its expansive utility movepool. Glare is useful to paralyze Serperior's checks such as Iron Moth and Mega Venusaur as they switch in, making it easier for either Serperior or its teammates to break through them later in the game. Defog lets Serperior support its teammates by clearing entry hazards. Leech Seed is a good option, especially alongside Substitute, to wear down Serperior's checks. Substitute is also useful for easing prediction, taking advantage of paralyzed foes, and enabling Serperior to avoid status from Pokemon like Clefable and opposing Serperior. Dragon Pulse hits Latios, Latias, and Salamence, which otherwise resist the combination of Grass and Fire. Finally, Taunt can be useful to deny recovery or status from foes such as Blissey. Leftovers is a good option, especially alongside Substitute and Leech Seed or Glare, to supplement Serperior's longevity and take advantage of the free turns it generates. However, Heavy-Duty Boots is another excellent choice to prevent hazard damage. Entry hazard support from Iron Treads, Mega Tyranitar, and Excadrill is appreciated to wear down checks such as Latias, Mega Venusaur, and Iron Moth into range of Serperior's attacks. Mega Tyranitar is an excellent partner for Serperior that can either set up with Dragon Dance against these checks or use Pursuit to trap Latias and Iron Moth. Other good offensive partners include Flyinium Z Salamence to set up against and eliminate Mega Venusaur and Iron Moth.

Draco Meteor OHKOes threats like Iron Moth and Mega Heracross while doing significant damage to foes such as Galarian Moltres, Iron Hands, and Mega Sableye. Dark Pulse threatens Slowking and gives Hydreigon a spammable STAB move. Flash Cannon hits Fairy-types like Enamorus, Mega Altaria, and Clefable. Fire Blast threatens Celesteela, Tangrowth, and Bisharp, Roost takes advantage of forced switches and lets Hydreigon stay healthy to switch in several times throughout the match, while U-turn lets it pivot out of foes it can struggle against such as Tapu Fini, Azumarill, and Clefable. A Timid nature lets Hydreigon outspeed Excadrill and Ceruledge, while Modest gives Draco Meteor a high chance of OHKOing Choice Band Iron Hands.</p> <p>Hydreigon struggles to break through Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini, Azumarill, and Clefable, as well as Celesteela if not running Fire Blast, so teammates that can pressure them like both Thundurus formes and Mega Venusaur are helpful. Hydreigon also appreciates pivots such as Cinderace and Slowking that can safely get it onto the field; Cinderace can use U-turn to pivot out of switch-ins that Hydreigon threatens like Slowbro and Mega Venusaur, while Slowking can safely pivot it in with Teleport. Knock Off support from the likes of Mega Vensaur, Iron Treads, and Thundurus-T is appreciated to help Hydreigon break through Pokemon like Celesteela, Tapu Fini, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Setup sweepers like Tapu Fini and Galarian Moltres benefit from Hydreigon's longevity and ability to pressure their checks such as Mega Venusaur and Mega Tyranitar, respectively, allowing them to become wincons late-game; fast teammates such as Choice Scarf Enamorus and Keldeo also appreciate Hydreigon for this reason, with it being able to pressure their switch-ins such as Slowking and Assault Vest Tangrowth, which can open the way for them to clean late-game. Hydreigon can also easily be revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Hawlucha, Latios, and Enamorus; Skarmory can deal with Hawlucha while providing Spikes support, and Slowking can deal with Latios and Enamorus.</p>"

Steam Eruption, in addition to being a powerful STAB option, is also very useful at spreading burns in order to weaken potential checks such as Mega Venusaur and Slowking. Sludge Bomb is used in order to break Clefable and Tapu Fini while also heavily damaging switch-ins such as Mega Latias and Hydreigon with a chance to poison them. Alternatively, Hidden Power Grass can be used in order to combat Slowbro and Gastrodon that would otherwise easily switch into Volcanion. Volcanion also offers some utility with Defog, being able to use its offensive capabilities to force out common entry hazard setters such as Mega Tyranitar, Iron Treads, Skarmory, and Hippowdon and clear hazards as they flee. Taunt is another utility option that allows Volcanion to shut down the likes of Calm Mind Clefable and Tapu Fini more efficiently while also preventing Slowking and Slowbro from using Teleport and Slack Off. Alternatively, Volcanion can forego its utility options in exchange for Earth Power in order to target threats such as Hisuian Goodra and Iron Hands. Heavy-Duty Boots is Volcanion's main item of choice in order to avoid damage from entry hazards, but it can also run Shuca Berry on more offensive playstyles in order to lure threats attempting to use Ground-type attacks against it, such as Excadrill and Enamorus. Wallbreakers like Hydreigon and Galarian Zapdos make for a solid offensive core with Volcanion, as Volcanion can switch into and pressure their checks in Clefable and Celesteela while they handle its checks in Slowking and Mega Venusaur. Physical attackers such as Iron Treads and Mega Aerodactyl also enjoy Volcanion's Water-type immunity, allowing it to absorb Scald from the likes of Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Gastrodon. Volcanion is capable of pressuring a ton of offensive threats such as Meowscarada, Mega Aerodactyl, and Sandy Shocks, as they are unable to switch into it properly, but unfortunately the inverse can also be said for it, since its mediocre Speed leaves it outpaced by the aforementioned threats and others, such as Iron Moth, Latios, Serperior, and Ogerpon-C. To mitigate this, speed control options such as Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Enamorus are vital in order to force them out more easily. In return, Volcanion can provide a switch-in to Cinderace and Tapu Fini for them while also pressuring defensive checks such as Amoonguss and Celesteela. Volcanion hates dealing with offensive Ground-types such as Excadrill and Ursaluna due to its inability to switch into them, so partners like Skarmory are very useful at keeping them at bay. In return, Volcanion can handle threats that would try to take advantage of Skarmory such as Aegislash and Tapu Fini. Electric-types such as Iron Hands, Thundurus, and Zeraora are also incredibly annoying for Volcanion, so partners such as Gastrodon, Mega Latias, Mega Venusaur, and Tangrowth are good at handling them. In return, Volcanion can pressure threats such as Amoonguss and Celesteela for them. Although Volcanion can beat Rock-types in theory, Tyranitar, Ogerpon-C, and Mega Aerodactyl can pressure it really easily if on the field. Partners such as Iron Hands and Scizor are great at forcing them out, and in return, Volcanion can deal with Iron Defense Skarmory and Amoonguss for them. Dragon-type wallbreakers such as Hydreigon and Salamence can also take advantage of Volcanion by merit of resisting both its STAB moves. Partners such as Celesteela, Clefable, and Mega Tyranitar can effectively force them out for Hydreigon.</p>"

Misty Surge makes it excellent at regaining momentum against status users, such as Clefable and Blissey, allowing setup teammates like Mega Tyranitar to more freely set up against these Pokemon. Scald provides Tapu Fini with a STAB move that can burn the likes of Celesteela and Tapu Bulu attempting to take advantage of it while also letting it apply pressure to targets such as Iron Moth and Victini. Alternatively, Nature's Madness allows Tapu Fini to hit defensive Pokemon it would otherwise be unable to punish for switching in, Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. Defog keeps entry hazards off against walls that its typing enables it to match up well against, like Skarmory. Taunt, besides preventing the aforementioned Pokemon from relaying hazards in front of Tapu Fini, also denies healing and setup attempts from Pokemon like Clefable and Blissey, particularly when used in combination with Nature's Madness to more quickly wear down said targets. 96 Speed EVs ensure that Tapu Fini outruns Adamant Scizor, letting it shut down potential Swords Dance attempts against it, while the rest is put into Defense to maximize its walling capabilities against Pokemon such as Buzzwole, Psyshock Latios, and Excadrill. Defog Tapu Fini fits onto many bulky offense and balance teams for its valuable role compression. Tapu Fini is prone to being overwhelmed and lacks any form of healing outside of Leftovers, which makes other defensive Pokemon that can support it against the aforementioned threats extremely valuable; these include Pokemon such as Skarmory and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Wish users such as Jirachi and Blissey are also highly noticeable in this regard for their ability to keep Tapu Fini healthy throughout the game in addition to synergizing with it immensely by handling special attackers that can threaten Tapu Fini, such as Serperior and Alakazam, while also gaining protection from the latter's Glare in return. Other defensive Pokemon like Buzzwole and Mega Aggron benefit from Tapu Fini's ability to clear hazards, allowing them to more safely leverage their HP to check the threats they are meant to deal with. Finally, powerful offensive Pokemon that appreciate Misty Terrain's effects, like Ogerpon-C and Choice Band Tyranitar, also enjoy being able to fall back on Tapu Fini to deal with offensive threats like Keldeo and clear hazards, improving their potential to wallbreak throughout the game.</p>"

Additionally, Tapu Fini can still uphold its natural defensive qualities and bulk to switch into other threats like Cinderace and Latios when needed, before outspeeding and threatening them too, while also providing Defog support. Hydro Pump is Tapu Fini's strongest move to hit Iron Moth and Excadrill with, OHKOing both after Stealth Rock damage, but Surf can be used instead if accuracy is a concern despite having less power. Trick allows Tapu Fini to cripple an incoming wall that would normally try to take advantage of it, like Blissey and Amoonguss. Defog allows Tapu Fini to clear entry hazards for its team in a pinch, especially once it has Tricked away its Choice Scarf, but if Defog is already found on another Pokemon, Taunt and Nature's Madness are options that can be used instead to further mess with most defensive Pokemon, chipping them down quickly or denying healing attempts. The given EV spread ensures that Tapu Fini survives a +2 Acrobatics from Hawlucha and outspeeds Mega Aerodactyl. Tapu Fini fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its defensive utility and role compression. Wallbreakers that benefit from its ability to check faster offensive threats like Keldeo and Galarian Zapdos include Pokemon such as Choice Band Tyranitar and Mega Heracross, with each additionally benefiting from Misty Terrain's status immunity. On the other hand, Tapu Fini's tendency to lure in defensive Pokemon that it can Trick its Choice Scarf over to, like Blissey and Chansey, can be exploited by Pokemon that normally struggle to break past them, such as Iron Moth and Nasty Plot Hydreigon. As Tapu Fini can struggle to check threats like Latios and Victini in the long run, other Pokemon like Celesteela and Galarian Moltres can help provide extra insurance against these Pokemon.</p>"

Its naturally great bulk and Steel/Flying typing afford it setup opportunities against foes like Scizor and Excadrill, as well as the ability to easily muscle past them. Meteor Beam combined with Power Herb lets Celesteela boost its Special Attack without needing a KO. Given that it's Celesteela's strongest attack, in some situations it should be saved to instead target a foe Celesteela would otherwise have trouble breaking through like Skeledirge or Victini. Air Slash serves as a spammable STAB attack, 2HKOing most of the tier at +1, though it can OHKO many Bug- and Grass-types like Buzzwole and Meowscarada unboosted. Its chance to flinch its foes can also come in handy against special walls like Gastrodon and Slowking, which could otherwise stop Celesteela's sweep. Fire Blast primarily targets Steel-types, OHKOing foes like Scizor unboosted and opposing Celesteela after a few boosts. Celesteela best fits on offense teams looking for a cleaner, forming a potent offensive combination with other sweepers like Iron Hands and Bisharp. Alternatively, if the opportunity arises, it can instead be used as a mid-game wallbreaker and have a teammate clean using the holes it creates. However, it has no way to break through certain special walls like Blissey and Chansey on its own, making physical attackers like Bisharp and Iron Hands necessary. While they share some overlapping counterplay, special sweepers like Booster Energy Iron Moth and Galarian Moltres also appreciate Celesteela's support for similar reasons, and they can still support each other by weakening some of each other's shared checks, such as Slowbro, Slowking, Latios, and Latias. Entry hazard setters like Lead Mew and Excadrill are crucial for their ability to weaken Celesteela's checks, making it harder for foes like Gastrodon and Tapu Fini to remain healthy enough to check Celesteela.</p>"

Leech Seed is Celesteela’s most defining move, as it is its main way of healing itself and allows it to force progress against would be switch-ins such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Blissey while also discouraging threats such as Mega Latias from setting up against it. Heavy Slam is another vital move that allows Celesteela to pressure threats such as Mega Tyranitar, Clefable, and Enamorus. Protect is good when used with Leech Seed to further wear down threats such as Iron Treads and Enamorus without Substitute while also letting it scout Choice-locked foes such as Latios and Victini. Toxic can be used over Protect on more offensive teams to make faster progress against threats such as Mega Latias, Mega Tyranitar, Hydreigon, and Galarian Moltres and also wear down bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Gastrodon. Flamethrower is an important coverage move to tackle Steel- and Grass-types such as Iron Treads, Skarmory, Serperior, and Meowscarada. Leftovers synergizes very well with Leech Seed and Protect to recover large swaths of HP. Celesteela struggles a lot against Fire-types such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Victini, so bulky Fire-resistant teammates such as Slowking, Mega Latias, and Mega Tyranitar are greatly appreciated to keep them at bay. Mega Tyranitar in particular is capable of Pursuit trapping Fire-types to deal with them. Electric-types such as Sandy Shocks and both Thundurus formes also annoy Celesteela greatly with Volt Switch, so Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon are important for halting their pivoting, and in return Celesteela can deal with Grass-types such as Serperior for them. Grass-types such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Serperior are good at handling Water-types that annoy Celesteela such as Slowbro, Alomomola, and Tapu Fini while also being secondary checks to Electric-types. Dangerous physical attackers such as Galarian Zapdos and Choice Band Meowscarada can easily overwhelm Celesteela, so physical walls such as Slowbro, Buzzwole, and Mega Altaria make for great partners to help deal with them. In return, Celesteela can help cover them against Fairy-types such as Clefable and Enamorus while also providing them with extra longevity via Leech Seed support.</p>"

U-turn, besides allowing Cinderace to maintain momentum by bringing in a teammate like Hydreigon, can also wear down defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro. Gunk Shot gives Cinderace useful coverage for Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Mega Altaria, and it also lets Cinderace force out Calm Mind Clefable more reliably. Alternatively, High Jump Kick is an option to OHKO Mega Tyranitar and Hydreigon, which U-turn cannot do. Sucker Punch lets Cinderace revenge kill chipped sweepers such as Agility Iron Moth and Z-Celebrate variants of Victini after their respective boosts while also threatening Choice Scarf users such as Blacephalon. Cinderace fits best on offensive teams that can supply it with the tools needed to break through defensive Pokemon; entry hazard setters such as Mega Tyranitar and Iron Treads can support Cinderace in this manner, with Mega Tyranitar also being able to trap Slowbro and Skeledirge with Pursuit after Cinderace pivots against them. Similarly, defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela, Slowbro, and Tapu Fini appreciate Cinderace's ability to threaten out the likes of Meowscarada and Scizor; in return, they can help sponge the Water- and Ground-type moves aimed at Cinderace or provide Future Sight or Taunt support in the case of the latter two. Powerful wallbreakers such as Latios and Gengar also appreciate the safe entry Cinderace can facilitate against most physically defensive Pokemon it commonly invites in on top of Cinderace being able to force out the Steel-types that would otherwise threaten them, like Iron Treads and Scizor.</p>"

Its expansive coverage in Earth Power and Mystical Fire allows it to hit every Steel-type in the tier, such as Celesteela, Skarmory, and Scizor, for super effective damage, securing either an OHKO or a 2HKO on them with a Calm Mind boost. It also allows Enamorus to work around other Fairy-resistant foes such as Skeledirge and Iron Moth as well as offensive checks in Hisuian Arcanine and Victini, while its Speed tier allows it to outspeed and OHKO Nihilego. Taunt is an option to potentially beat and deny recovery from status users like Clefable, Hippowdon, and Chansey that try to slow down or stall Enamorus. Similarly, Iron Moth enjoys many of its checks being removed, particularly Mega Tyranitar and Latias. However, Enamorus's frailty and lack of immediate power makes it difficult for it to break past checks such as Mega Venusaur and Celesteela, which threaten to OHKO it with Sludge Bomb and Heavy Slam, respectively, and aren't OHKOed after a Calm Mind boost. Similarly, Chansey can use Toxic and Seismic Toss to take advantage of Enamorus's lack of longevity. This means it appreciates partners such as Tyranitar and Bisharp, which are capable of Pursuit trapping special walls like Chansey, as well as Cinderace, which can break past Celesteela as well as provide pivoting to bring Enamorus in safely. Its Speed tier also means it is pressured by faster threats such as Iron Moth and Latios. This means it enjoys speed control from partners such as Cinderace and Meowscarada, which are able to outspeed its offensive checks. To compensate for its relative frailty, it also enjoys slow pivots to bring it in safely, such as Slowbro, Slowking, and Scizor, and in return it provides an offensive check to the Dark-types they are threatened by, such as Mega Tyranitar, Meowscarada, and Hydreigon.</p>"

This also allows Enamorus to potentially snowball through weakened teams once faster foes like Meowscarada and Cinderace have been removed. Alternatively, Psychic hits Poison-types that aren't weak to Earth Power, such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. In addition to Pursuit trappers like Mega Tyranitar, speed control from the likes of Cinderace, and slow pivots like Slowbro, Choice Specs Enamorus functions as an excellent partner to special sweepers such as Iron Moth, Keldeo, Blacephalon, and Serperior due to its ability to remove checks to it without competing for the same team slot. These options can also be used to remove Steel- and Poison-types to allow Enamorus to use its powerful Moonblast more freely. As Enamorus is weak to Stealth Rock, it appreciates being partnered with strong entry hazard removal options, such as Rapid Spin Iron Treads, Defog Salamence, Defog Tapu Fini, and Court Change Cinderace, which allow it to more easily work around opposing entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon and suicide leads like Excadrill. Due to its Choice Specs, however, Enamorus becomes prediction-reliant against teams that stack multiple Fairy-resistant foes, so Stealth Rock and Knock Off support from Clefable, Tyranitar, and Scizor allows it to more effectively break down its checks over the course of a game.</p>"

Protean increases the damage output of its coverage moves, making them better suited at pressuring targets such as Mega Latias, Galarian Zapdos, and Hydreigon. Knock Off allows Meowscarada to remove important items from walls such as Clefable, Celesteela, and physically defensive Tangrowth, allowing it to break through them more easily. U-turn gives Meowscarada the ability to keep up momentum and in conjunction with Protean, severely dents opposing Meowscarada and Serperior that may try to stay in on it. Thunder Punch is critical for allowing Meowscarada to revenge kill targets like Autotomize Celesteela and Double Dance Galarian Moltres after their respective boosts, especially if the former has already used up its Power Herb. Alternatively, Play Rough can be used to hit other Fighting- and Dragon-types, most notably Buzzwole, Iron Hands, and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria, while retaining its ability to take out Galarian Moltres. If several of the aforementioned Pokemon are adequately covered by Meowscarada's teammates, Trick can be used to cripple an incoming wall, such as Buzzwole or Amoonguss. Choice Scarf Meowscarada fits best on balance and offensive teams. Pokemon such as Sandy Shocks and Skarmory are appreciated partners for laying entry hazards that capitalize on Meowscarada's ability to force switches and remove items such as Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from the opponent. Defensive pivots such as Slowking and Utility Jirachi also appreciate Meowscarada's ability to keep threats like Mega Tyranitar and Keldeo in check and can opt to safely bring it in against these Pokemon, as Meowscarada's poor defensive attributes often means it cannot switch into them directly. While Meowscarada is able to hit many of them super effectively, it can still struggle to deal lasting damage against walls such as Skarmory and Amoonguss, making offensive teammates that can take advantage of them, such as Choice Band Victini and Choice Specs Latios extremely valuable, all of which benefit from the opportunities provided by Meowscarada's U-turn in return.</p>"

In addition to this, Knock Off cripples defensive walls such as Scizor and Amoonguss by removing their respective items, while also serving as Meowscarada's most common move to use against neutral targets. U-turn allows Meowscarada to rack up momentum against Pokemon it forces out, such as Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Tapu Fini. Thunder Punch is usually preferred for its ability to 2HKO Skarmory outright, on top of hitting other crucial Flying-type checks such as Enamorus. However, Play Rough can be used instead to provide super effective coverage against other answers, 2HKOing the likes of physically defensive Buzzwole, Mega Sableye, and Mega Altaria. Sucker Punch is also a passable option in the last slot as a priority move that can finish off weakened offensive threats such as Autotomize Celesteela, Z-Celebrate Victini, and Sand Rush Excadrill. Choice Band Meowscarada fits best on more offensive teams, particularly those that appreciate its unique mix of wallbreaking and pivoting capabilities. Frailer offensive teammates that also benefit from Meowscarada's U-turn, such as Hisuian Zoroark and Alakazam, can make for good teammates to pressure some of Meowscarada's checks, like Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur. Hisuian Zoroark in particular synergizes especially well, as disguising as Meowscarada with its Illusion ability can help force mindgames with the opponent; the threat of Hisuian Zoroark luring in and eliminating walls such as Buzzwole with Flamethrower can make the opponent much less eager to try and switch them into Meowscarada. Defensive pivots such as Scizor and Blissey, are also essential to let Meowscarada enter the field safely against more preferable targets, while also being great Pokemon to fall back on when faced with opposing revenge killers, such as Choice Scarf Latias and Enamorus. Slowking can also use Future Sight to remedy Meowscarada's lack of coverage against Fighting-types such as Buzzwole and Iron Hands. Entry hazard support from the likes of Clefable and Sandy Shocks benefit from Meowscarada's Knock Off removing items such as Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from defensive Pokemon like Clefable, on top of making it easier to break past them.</p>"

Flower Trick, especially in conjunction with Overgrow, allows Meowscarada to deal significant damage to neutral foes before fainting, most notably 2HKOing Stealth Rock Clefable. Knock Off, on top of 2HKOing Lead Mew, can also remove items such as Skarmory's Rocky Helmet and Celesteela's Leftovers, making them easier to break through. Lead Meowscarada's extensive utility and positive matchups against similar archetypes make it a natural fit for hyper offense teams. Offensive Pokemon such as Swords Dance Scizor, Meteor Beam Celesteela, and Calm Mind Latios each appreciate Spikes' ability to wear down several of their grounded checks into range, like Mega Tyranitar and Tapu Fini. Offensive Stealth Rock users, such as Sandy Shocks and Nihilego, can also synergize well with Meowscarada's Spikes to create even more offensive pressure for the opponent. As Lead Meowscarada tends to struggle against Mega Sableye due to Magic Bounce, Pokemon that can take advantage of it, such as Nasty Plot Galarian Moltres and Booster Energy Iron Moth, make for crucial offensive teammates that can fulfill this role effectively. In return, they favor Meowscarada's ability to remove their crippling weakness to Stealth Rock by shutting down the majority of Stealth Rock setters.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Ceruledge's fearsome STAB combination and access to Swords Dance make it a great sweeper and wallbreaker in NatDex UU. At +2, Bitter Blade and Poltergeist cleave through common defensive staples like Celesteela, Clefable, and Slowbro; the former's healing also makes Ceruledge much harder to KO with residual damage like sand and Toxic as well as some neutral hits such as Iron Hands's Thunder Punch. Shadow Sneak lets Ceruledge take out faster foes that are chipped such as Enamorus and Galarian Zapdos, and at +2 it can even OHKO some Ghost-weak foes like Latios. Close Combat is an alternative, primarily used to OHKO Tyranitar and its Mega forme as well as 2HKO Hydreigon, which resist Ceruledge's STAB attacks. It is also Ceruledge's strongest option against Normal-types, 2HKOing Blissey and Chansey. Weak Armor allows Ceruledge to boost its Speed by taking advantage of physical attackers that can't OHKO it like Iron Hands and Cinderace. Air Balloon allows Ceruledge to soft check foes that rely on Ground-type moves to threaten it like Buzzwole, Excadrill, and Enamorus; against physical attackers, Air Balloon can force them to use a weak attack to pop it granting, Ceruledge a Weak Armor boost. Focus Sash is an alternative, guaranteeing Ceruledge at least one turn of setup and, against physical attackers, one Weak Armor boost. Ghostium Z is another option that provides Ceruledge the power to OHKO Pokemon it otherwise can't, such as Tapu Fini and Iron Hands at +2; it also lets Ceruledge use a powerful Ghost-type move against targets that lack an item, which is situationally useful against certain foes like itemless Slowbro and Booster Energy Iron Moth because Poltergeist does not work on them. Ceruledge fits best on hyper offense teams, which can stack offensive teammates like Iron Hands, Iron Moth, and Thundurus-T to weaken each other's checks. Ceruledge struggles against bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and is notably stonewalled by the rare Quagsire, making Grass-types like Serperior and certain sweepers like Z-Dragon Dance Salamence and Iron Moth natural partners. Ceruledge dislikes Stealth Rock, especially if it's holding Focus Sash, so it enjoys the support of teammates that can remove entry hazards like Excadrill and Serperior.</p>"

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Iron Treads is a staple on defensive teams due to its coveted Ground typing, its versatility, and its ability to soft check dangerous threats such as the Tyranitar formes. Iron Head provides more damage output against Clefable and Enamorus. Knock Off complements Iron Treads's coverage by removing items from switch-ins such as Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Celesteela. Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin may be run on the same set, but it is ill-advised, as running both means Iron Treads will struggle to fit all of its other moves. Without Iron Head, it struggles to pressure Calm Mind Clefable, and without Volt Switch, it severely lacks the ability to generate momentum. Assault Vest can be run over Leftovers to provide additional insurance against special attackers like Enamorus and Hydreigon in exchange for recovery. Maximum HP investment ensures Iron Treads is as bulky as possible, while 208 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow it to outspeed Base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Victini. The remaining 48 EVs are invested into Special Defense to help it pivot more easily into special attackers. Defensive Iron Treads acts as a Swiss army knife for bulkier teams due to its variable utility options. Offensive Pokemon that are weak to entry hazards such as Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine, Mega Aerodactyl, and Choice Specs Blacephalon appreciate Iron Treads’s Rapid Spin support. Iron Treads also acts as a middle ground switch-in to Pokemon like Clefable, Mega Tyranitar, and some Tapu Fini variants, which benefits Pokemon like Hydreigon, Salamence, Blacephalon, and Latios. Iron Treads can form robust defensive cores with Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Slowbro and Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur; the former two can handle Fire- and Fighting-type attacks, while the latter can take on Ground-types such as Gastrodon. Mega Venusaur and Tangrowth can switch into Knock Off for Iron Treads, allowing it to preserve Leftovers for the later stages of the game. In return, Iron Treads facilitates entry for these defensive Pokemon via Volt Switch. Skarmory, Celesteela, and Buzzwole can prove to be long-term nuisances for Iron Treads, even though they don’t appreciate losing their items to Knock Off. As such, Pokemon that can exploit their presence such as Tapu Fini, Skeledirge, and Hisuian Arcanine make for excellent partners. Finally, Wish support from Clefable provides Iron Treads with recovery and enables it to stay healthy in the long run.</p>"

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Offensive Iron Treads leverages its excellent defensive typing in tandem with decent coverage to function as a lead or an early- or mid-game hazard setter for more fast-paced teams. While offensive Iron Treads does compete with lead and offensive Rapid Spin Excadrill, Iron Treads boasts greater longevity and Speed over Excadrill despite sacrificing power. Knock Off is necessary for removing Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots from defensive Pokemon to wear them down for itself and its teammates. Iron Head is an option to hit specific Pokemon such as Clefable, Enamorus, and Hydreigon, but a dedicated lead set can be run with both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin if Iron Treads' teammates require entry hazard support. Iron Treads’s item can help double down on these advantages, with Leftovers providing passive recovery to mitigate hazard chip and Booster Energy allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, most importantly offensive Pokemon such as Cinderace, Zeraora, and Iron Moth. Maximum Attack and Speed investment provides Iron Treads with sufficient power and Speed to function as an early-game offensive pivot. A Jolly nature is crucial for outrunning dangerous threats such as Thundurus-T, Sandy Shocks, Jirachi, and Z-Celebrate Victini while also ensuring Iron Treads receives a Speed boost when using Booster Energy. Iron Treads finds itself on bulky offense and even hyper offense teams thanks to its consistency as an offensive spinner. As such, it appreciates offensive partners that can carry its momentum to overwhelm opposing teams. Deadly setup sweepers such as Bisharp and Iron Hands or wallbreakers like Latios, Enamorus, and Mega Heracross exploit Iron Treads's ability to clear hazards and remove crucial defensive items from their checks, such as Leftovers on specially defensive Celesteela. Offensive Iron Treads invites in physically bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Slowbro, Quagsire, Skarmory, Celesteela, and Buzzwole, which could lead to a loss in momentum. Partners such as Iron Moth, Enamorus, Serperior, and Latios can either put pressure on these walls or punish them outright for switching in. In exchange, they appreciate Iron Treads forcing progress against specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Chansey. Slowking can provide Future Sight and Teleport support, which benefits both Iron Treads and the offensive structures it finds itself on. Offensive Spikes users like Meowscarada form an excellent hazard-stacking core with Iron Treads that can further pressure defensive Pokemon and allow Iron Treads to be conserved as a mid-game Stealth Rock setter or spinner.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With the Speed boost from Agility and Special Attack Boost from Booster Energy, Iron Moth can effectively serve the role of a cleaner. Fiery Dance and Sludge Wave serve as spammable STAB attacks that hit the majority of the tier for neutral damage; the former has the potential to snowball through teams, thanks to its chance to raise the user's Special Attack further. Energy Ball primarily targets Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types like Hippowdon, Mega Tyranitar, and Slowking. Due to the all-or-nothing nature of this set, Iron Moth best fits on offense teams looking for a cleaner. It struggles against Ground-, Rock- and Water-types, so Grass- and Water-types like Serperior and Calm Mind Tapu Fini make good partners, as they can handle these threats. Physical wallbreakers like Iron Hands and Buzzwole are also important, as Iron Moth has no way to get past Blissey and Chansey. Skeledirge also walls Iron Moth thanks to their typings and bulk, so Ghost- and Dark-types, and notably Pursuit users like Mega Tyranitar, can eliminate them for it. Iron Moth despises losing 25% of its health to Stealth Rock when switching in, so partners that can remove them, like Excadrill and Iron Treads, are much appreciated. Stealth Rock support is greatly appreciated, as it can push certain targets like Choice Band Tyranitar outside of Sandstorm and Hydreigon into KO range.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Offensive Iron Moth leverages its high number of resistances and good power to act as a dangerous offensive threat with Heavy-Duty Boots. Fire Blast serves as a powerful STAB move that threatens every neutral target that doesn't have immense special bulk. Fiery Dance is an alternative; it's notably weaker, missing out on the OHKO on Autotomize Celesteela and 2HKO on Iron Hands. However, in exchange, it has perfect accuracy, more PP, and its ability to boost Iron Moth's Special Attack can let it sweep late-game. Sludge Wave is Iron Moth's other STAB attack; besides hitting opposing Dragon- and Fire-types for neutral damage, it also breaks through Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Fini. Due to the amount of Pokemon it threatens out, such as Iron Treads and Mega Sableye, Iron Moth is an effective setter of Toxic Spikes; Energy Ball is an alternative, serving as coverage against opposing Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types, like Gastrodon and Tyranitar, and finally, U-turn is another alternative, as the switches Iron Moth forces out let it act as an effective offensive pivot. Morning Sun gives Iron Moth reliable recovery, letting it avoid getting worn down by repeated attacks and Stealth Rock if its Heavy-Duty Boots are removed. Iron Moth best fits on balance and offensive teams looking for a fast and powerful special attacker with good utility. While Iron Moth can check most special attackers, even resisted hits from physical attackers like Cinderace can 2HKO it. Thus, physical walls and tanks like Buzzwole and Slowbro can check these foes for Iron Moth. Pivots, like the latter two, can also help Iron Moth find opportunities to switch in. If it is carrying U-turn, wallbreakers like Choice Band Meowscarada, Choice Specs Latios, and Enamorus appreciate Iron Moth's ability to pivot them in safely, while in return they can smash through the walls and many offensive threats that give Iron Moth trouble. Speed control, namely powerful priority users like Scizor and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Fini and Hydreigon, can also help eliminate physical attackers. Physical wallbreakers like Iron Hands and Buzzwole can help against Blissey and Chansey, which wall Iron Moth. Chansey and Skeledirge also wall Iron Moth, so Ghost- and Dark-types, notably Pursuit users like Mega Tyranitar, can remove them for it.</p>"
