        "description": "<p>Clefable’s excellent utility, movepool, and defensive typing allow it to function as a powerful defensive piece. Its excellent pure Fairy typing creates favorable matchups versus Pokemon such as Latios, Meowscarada, Buzzwole, and Iron Hands. Clefable acts as a Toxic immunity thanks to Magic Guard and also possesses a permanent immunity to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Sandstorm. On offensive teams, Clefable usually fills the role of hazard setter through Stealth Rock. It can use Knock Off to limit the longevity of potential switch-ins such as Aegislash, Celesteela, Galarian Slowking, Iron Treads, and Leftovers variants of Excadrill. Thunder Wave is another useful option, adding the potential to cripple offensive threats such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, Enamorus, and Z-Celebrate Victini. Defensive teams may choose to employ a more passive variant of Clefable using Wish and Protect to provide longevity to Pokemon without access to reliable recovery such as Mega Tyranitar, Excadrill, Celesteela, and Aegislash. Aromatherapy is similarly useful to allow teammates to outlast the opposing team. Additionally, it allows for more aggressive play against Pokemon reliant on status such as Skeledirge and Galarian Slowking, allowing for them to be safely Pursuit trapped by Mega Tyranitar. Clefable’s ability to spread chip damage through utility moves such as Stealth Rock and Knock Off lends it to supporting wallbreakers like Latios, Meowscarada, Galarian Zapdos, and Excadrill. Clefable also pairs well with entry hazard users such as Mega Tyranitar, Hippowdon, Skarmory, Meowscarada, and Sandy Shocks to wear down the opposition, as it can get rid of items from entry hazard removers such as Excadrill, Tapu Fini, Cinderace, and Iron Treads. Clefable struggles with heavy hitters able to trade powerful attacks for the chip damage inflicted by Clefable, such as Iron Moth, Excadrill, and Enamorus. This weakness is mitigated by teammates able to act as revenge killers like Meowscarada, Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, and Mega Aerodactyl. Defensive partners such as Slowbro, Celesteela, Galarian Slowking, Mega Tyranitar, and Blissey can beat Steel, Poison, and Fire-types which often beat Clefable. In return, Clefable can beat Dark- and Fighting-types such as Buzzwole, Iron Hands, Hydreigon, and Meowscarada. Clefable is also a good switch-in to many Knock Off users that might cripple many of its partners, most notably Assault Vest Tangrowth and Chansey.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Clefable is a strong wincon, becoming extremely difficult to threaten once boosted. Magic Guard allows it to set up in the face of defensive Pokemon that would otherwise rely on status moves to threaten it, such as specially oriented Aegislash, Buzzwole, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. Leftovers is the preferred item to decrease the likelihood of running out of Soft-Boiled PP, but Life Orb can also be used in combination with Magic Guard for a significant increase in damage, helping defeat Pokemon such as specially defensive Celesteela, Taunt Tapu Fini, and Excadrill. Flamethrower is preferred to hit Steel-types such as Aegislash, Excadrill, Iron Treads, Celesteela, and Scizor. Thunder can also be used for passable neutral coverage in addition to the chance to paralyze foes such as Iron Moth, Galarian Slowking, Hisuian Arcanine, and Mega Venusaur. Knock Off offers more permanent damage on Steel-types, removing their items such as Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots at the cost of being unable to directly break through them. Aromatherapy is often seen on stall teams in addition to Unaware, allowing Clefable to function as both the team’s cleric and wincon. Clefable naturally checking Fighting-types makes it a good teammate for Pokemon such as Excadrill and Meowscarada. Mega Tyranitar appreciates this while providing Clefable with crucial Pursuit support, trapping Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge. Offensive pivots such as Cinderace, Meowscarada, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon appreciate Clefable taking advantage of the defensive walls they might be unable to break through. Calm Mind Clefable is vulnerable to foes able to immediately threaten it such as Excadrill, Celesteela, Galarian Slowking, and Iron Moth. Steel- and Poison-resistant teammates such as Celesteela, Slowbro, and Mega Aerodactyl can cover for Clefable, giving it more opportunities to set up. Unaware Clefable being pressured by entry hazards means it necessitates strong hazard control options, such as Defog Skarmory, Mega Sableye, and Salamence. A relative lack of bulk and initial power means friendly entry hazards are appreciated from teammates including Skarmory, Chansey, Hippowdon, and Jirachi that can help wear down incoming defensive Pokemon more quickly.</p>"

As they're forced out, Slowbro can use Teleport to maintain momentum and stay healthy. Scald serves as a spammable STAB attack that can cripple targets with burns, dissuading otherwise decent checks like Mega Tyranitar and physically-centric Aegislash sets from setting up. Even foes that don't rely on physical attacks, like Serperior and Latios, tend to dislike the chip from burn. Future Sight supports wallbreakers like Choice Band Tyranitar, Buzzwole, and Enamorus in breaking through their checks such as Tangrowth and Skarmory for the former two and Galarian Slowking for the latter. It also synergizes excellently with Teleport. Slack Off serves as reliable recovery that doesn't require Slowbro to switch out. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Slowbro to avoid taking damage from entry hazards, maximizing HP regained from Regenerator, though Rocky Helmet can be held instead to punish contact move users, notably foes that run U-turn like Cinderace. A Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs are used to make Slowbro as slow as possible, maximizing its odds of moving slower than opposing Teleport users. Slowbro best fits on bulky offense and balance teams looking for a reliable defensive pivot that can also generate momentum for wallbreakers. Hazard-stacking teammates like Skarmory, defensive Clefable, and Hippowdon pair up nicely with Future Sight, further putting pressure on opposing defensive cores. Many hazard-stacking teammates can also double as checks to Pokemon Slowbro struggles against, such as Clefable checking Dark-types like Hydreigon, Skarmory handling Bug- and Grass-types like Buzzwole and Meowscarada, and Hippowdon checking Electric-types like Iron Hands as well as Galarian Slowking. Similarly, pivots like Scizor and Iron Treads also check threats like Galarian Slowking while pairing nicely with Slowbro's own pivoting potential to maintain offensive momentum. If it isn't running Heavy-Duty Boots, hazard control from teammates like Hydreigon, Choice Scarf Serperior, and Iron Treads is necessary.</p>"

With its unique defensive typing and good bulk, it can check a wide variety of foes, notably Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Fini and Grass-types such as Serperior and Tapu Bulu. Sludge Bomb serves as a spammable STAB move that can hurt the longevity of targets such as Gastrodon and Mega Sableye by poisoning them. Slack Off provides instant recovery Galarian Slowking can use without needing to switch out. Future Sight lets Galarian Slowking support wallbreakers and threaten Pokemon switching in to check it. Maximizing Galarian Slowking's physical bulk improves its ability to check physical attackers and lets it usually survive at least one Pursuit from an opposing Dark-type. 0 Speed IVs let Galarian Slowking move after its foes when using Chilly Reception, improving its pivoting capabilities. Galarian Slowking best fits on offensive teams looking for a splashable pivot and Future Sight support for wallbreakers that have difficulty coming onto the field, like Meowscarada and Mega Gallade. It struggles the most against Dark-types, which can absorb its Future Sight and threaten it. Tyranitar is a notable example due to its powerful Pursuit and Galarian Slowking's inability to hit it for neutral damage. Thus, bulky Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Buzzwole make good partners. Steel-types such as Aegislash, Iron Treads, and Celesteela also wall Galarian Slowking due to its lack of coverage, so the aforementioned Fighting-types and other checks to Steel-types, such as Fire-types like Iron Moth, are effective support. Entry hazard stackers like Skarmory pair well with Galarian Slowking's ability to spread damage and pivot in offensive threats.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Assault Vest Galarian Slowking is an effective special wall that uses its unique typing and wide coverage to act as a versatile tank. The overwhelming majority of special attackers in the tier, including difficult-to-wall foes like Serperior and Iron Moth, lack the means to effectively break through it. Meanwhile, Galarian Slowking's good Special Attack and coverage mean few Pokemon are not threatened by it. Regenerator lets Galarian Slowking have a form of healing while holding Assault Vest. Sludge Bomb is a spammable STAB move that can cripple switch-ins with poison. Future Sight lets Galarian Slowking support wallbreakers while also punishing Pokemon such as Swords Dance Cinderace that would otherwise try and set up on it. Flamethrower primarily targets Steel-types like Aegislash and Celesteela. Scald hits Ground-types and potentially cripples physical attackers and walls like Skarmory and Mega Tyranitar. This EV spread is used to guarantee that Galarian Slowking will not be 2HKOed by Latios's Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, with the remaining EVs being used to augment Galarian Slowking's Special Attack. Galarian Slowking best fits on bulky teams looking for a versatile tank that serves as a blanket check to most of the tier's special attackers. Examples of partners that appreciate this include Clefable, SubToxic Aegislash, and Gastrodon. Entry hazard removers like Tapu Fini are crucial support, as even one layer of entry hazards significantly cuts into Galarian Slowking's recovery. Galarian Slowking struggles the most against Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar, as while no physical attacker enjoys switching into its Scald or Sludge Bomb, they can easily trap it once they're on the field. Bulky Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Buzzwole and defensive walls such as Skarmory and Tangrowth can handle these foes for Galarian Slowking. Aegislash is another notable issue for Galarian Slowking, as its Ghost typing combined with its huge bulk and offenses lets it easily win one-on-one. Ground-types like Iron Treads can serve as effective checks to it.</p>"

Skarmory also serves as a valuable Spikes user thanks to it being able to set up against threats such as Buzzwole, Blissey, Iron Treads, and non-Flamethrower Clefable. The combination of Iron Defense and Body Press is Skarmory’s preferred choice to make progress against teams, as it allows it to stonewall threats such as Scizor, Bisharp, and Tyranitar while also further pressuring threats such as Blissey and Hippowdon. Dropping Iron Defense and Body Press for Whirlwind or Toxic and Brave Bird respectively is also an option on more offensive teams to pressure threats such as Buzzwole and Serperior more effectively while also offering extra team support by phasing or spreading poison damage. However, this comes at the cost of being far more passive against Excadrill and lacks a proper response to Bisharp and Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar. On stall teams, Skarmory has the choice of running Defog in place of either Spikes or Iron Defense and can also run an EV spread of 248 HP / 76 Def / 184 Spe with an Impish nature to outspeed Choice Band Tyranitar, allowing it to boost or safely heal up before Tyranitar can 2HKO it. Skarmory’s main item of choice is Rocky Helmet to get residual damage off against foes with U-turn such as Meowscarada, Scizor, and Galarian Zapdos while also chipping setup sweepers such as Mega Tyranitar, but it can also run Shed Shell on bulkier playstyles such as balance and stall in order to avoid being trapped by Magnezone. Skarmory can struggle a lot against special attackers such as Latios and Enamorus, so specially defensive walls such as Galarian Slowking, Blissey, Chansey, and specially defensive Skeledirge are good partners to shore up that weakness. Mega Tyranitar is another good partner, since it can switch into and Pursuit trap threats that pressure Skarmory such as Iron Moth, Galarian Slowking, and non-Close Combat Aegislash. Common pivots that take advantage of Skarmory such as Cinderace, Thundurus, and Thundurus-T also hate being Pursuit trapped by Mega Tyranitar. Skarmory also has issues against Fire-types such as Cinderace and Victini, so bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Slowking, Gastrodon, and Alomomola can help deal with them. Electric-types such as Thundurus, Thundurus-T, Sandy Shocks, and Zeraora can also threaten Skarmory, so bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon are good partners to hinder them, but bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur also work as teammates at the cost of being unable to block Volt Switch. The aforementioned Ground-types can also form strong entry hazard stacking cores with Skarmory that bulkier playstyles such as stall enjoy greatly. Offensively, wallbreakers such as Cinderace, Iron Hands, Latios, and Galarian Zapdos make for good partners, since they appreciate Skarmory's Spikes helping them chip their checks so they can wallbreak easier.</p>"

Stone Edge is a strong STAB option that OHKOes Iron Moth while denting neutral targets such as Celesteela and Tapu Fini. Pursuit enables Mega Tyranitar to trap Psychic- and Ghost-types, like Latios and Blacephalon. Crunch offers a strong STAB move to hit bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types, like Aegislash and Mega Latias. It is also the strongest move Mega Tyranitar has to hit Galarian Slowking. Superpower is an option to snipe opposing Tyranitar and severely damage would-be switch-ins such as Excadrill and Iron Treads. 176 Speed EVs enable Mega Tyranitar to outspeed Aegislash and Celesteela. Offensive Fighting-types such as Buzzwole, Iron Hands, and Keldeo appreciate Mega Tyranitar removing bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types. In exchange, Buzzwole covers Mega Tyranitar’s weaknesses to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, while Keldeo can bring Mega Tyranitar in safely with Flip Turn. Other teammates such as Iron Moth and Serperior offer some defensive synergy and appreciate Mega Tyranitar’s ability to remove Psychic- and Fire-types, respectively. Mega Tyranitar’s typing gives its weaknesses to prominent attacking types such as Fighting, Water and Ground, so Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Galarian Slowking can provide switch-ins to these types. The Future Sight support provided by the latter meshes well with Pursuit and dissuades Buzzwole and Iron Hands from switching in. Celesteela and Skarmory can help check Excadrill, Iron Treads, and Buzzwole, with Skarmory providing Spikes as a bonus. Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Aegislash can all check Fighting-types to some degree. Aegislash’s immunity to Fighting-type moves makes it an excellent partner to Mega Tyranitar, and it also eases the burden of checking Mega Latias, enabling Mega Tyranitar to run Superpower. Together they can wear down shared checks like Hippowdon. Due to its lack of reliable recovery, Mega Tyranitar is vulnerable to being chipped down, so partners such as Choice Scarf Latias and Choice Band Scizor can ease the burden against frail sweepers such as Polteageist and Nihilego. Finally, Sand Rush Excadrill benefits from Mega Tyranitar’s Sand Stream and its ability to wear down Skarmory and Hippowdon.</p>"

Ice Punch synergizes well with Stone Edge, as it chunks physically defensive Ground-types like Hippowdon and physically defensive Tangrowth. Earthquake is a valuable coverage option to hit Excadrill, Iron Treads, and non-Air Balloon Aegislash. Crunch is an alternative STAB option for Air Balloon Aegislash that also hits Mega Latias, Gastrodon, and Slowbro hard. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Cinderace with a single Dragon Dance. Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar is usually found on bulky offense or hyper offense since these structures provide adequate tools to facilitate setup. The main hindrances for Mega Tyranitar are physically defensive walls like Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Clefable. Teammates like Serperior, Tapu Fini, Swords Dance Scizor, and Meteor Beam Celesteela can take advantage of these Pokemon. Serperior can lure in and use Glare against faster Pokemon that can outspeed +1 Mega Tyranitar, such as Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Mega Aerodactyl. Mega Tyranitar can also be revenge killed by common Fighting-types like Buzzwole, Keldeo, and Iron Hands even after a boost. Teammates such as Polteageist, Latios, and Aegislash offer valuable typings and can soft-check Fighting-types. In turn, they appreciate Mega Tyranitar’s ability to take advantage of specially defensive walls such as Blissey. Offensive Steel-types such as Iron Treads and Scizor can cut a Mega Tyranitar sweep short, and thus Fire-types like Cinderace and Iron Moth are excellent partners. Magnezone deserves a special mention, as it traps Scizor and Skarmory. Sand Rush Excadrill appreciates Mega Tyranitar’s Sand Stream ability and in exchange offers insurance against Unaware Clefable. Mega Tyranitar is vulnerable to chip damage and thus appreciates pivoting support from Cinderace, Magnezone, Scizor, and Meowscarada. Slowbro and Galarian Slowking can bring in Mega Tyranitar safely with Teleport and Chilly Reception and offer Future Sight support for Buzzwole. Finally, dual screens support from Grimmsnarl eases setup, while Spikes from Meowscarada and Mew wear down walls.</p>"

This also allows it to find points of entry against common offensive threats such as Iron Moth and Keldeo. Calm Mind boosts Mega Latias' naturally high Special Attack and Special Defense to astounding levels, ensuring that it can easily withstand moves such as Clefable's unboosted Moonblast and Choice Scarf Hydreigon's Dark Pulse to sweep weakened teams. Psyshock is crucial to ignore defensive boosts from Calm Mind variants of the aforementioned Clefable while also breaking past special walls such as Blissey and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking more easily, preventing them from crippling Mega Latias with status moves. Aura Sphere provides Mega Latias with important coverage against most Dark- and Steel-types, hitting Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Excadrill super effectively. Alternatively, if Tyranitar is handled adequately by Mega Latias's teammates, Mystical Fire can be used to deal more immediate damage to the likes of Aegislash, Scizor, and Celesteela instead. Mega Latias fits best on defensive and balance teams, which can provide it with the longevity needed to gain proper setup opportunities. Entry hazard support from the likes of Skarmory and Gastrodon can help wear down opposing walls that would otherwise be difficult to break through late-game, such as Aegislash and Tapu Fini. Similarly, wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Aegislash, Choice Band Iron Hands, and Serperior can make for good options to take advantage of these Pokemon, especially when Mega Latias lacks Mystical Fire to deal with the former. However, although Mega Latias is able to switch into Pokemon like Iron Hands, its lack of initial power can leave it vulnerable to being overwhelmed by their boosted attacks in return. Thus, Speed control options such as Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Tapu Fini, in addition to certain defensive walls like Unaware Skeledirge are extremely valuable in providing backup against such foes. Conversely, paralysis support from the likes of Serperior and Clefable is also notable, as they can limit faster Pokemon such as Meowscarada and Cinderace from being able to overwhelm Mega Latias with super effective hits late-game.</p>"

It can leverage its solid Speed stat versus common offensive Pokemon such as Victini, Galarian Zapdos, Sandy Shocks, and Blacephalon as well as its numerous useful resistances to create opportunities to unleash devastating moves. Psyshock is preferred over Psychic to defeat specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey, Chansey, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking more easily. Trick is used on Choice Specs sets to cripple would-be walls such as Jirachi, Grimmsnarl, and Clefable, while Roost allows Life Orb variants to offset the item's recoil. Mystical Fire is preferred on Latios to hit Steel-types such as Aegislash, Excadrill, Iron Treads, and Celesteela. It can also choose to use Thunderbolt to flip important matchups such as Tapu Fini, Slowking, and physically defensive Clefable while also providing a consistent way to damage most Steel-types. Choice Specs is preferred to maximize damage output, but Life Orb can also be chosen in order to enable switching moves, at the cost of the ability to eliminate Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Hippowdon with Draco Meteor. Latios's ability to blow away physical walls makes it an excellent partner to any physical wallbreaker. Latios appreciates opportunities to fire off powerful attacks, so Pokemon with pivoting moves such as Cinderace, Meowscarada, Galarian Zapdos, and Scizor make for good partners. Latios struggles with Choice Scarf users able to force it to switch, such as Tapu Fini, Blacephalon, and Latias, as well as Pokemon able to naturally outspeed it such as Cinderace, Meowscarada, and Alakazam. These weaknesses can be alleviated with defensive pivots able to switch into these threats, such as Clefable, Aegislash, and Galarian Slowking. Latios also pairs well with supportive Pokemon like Clefable, Mewoscarada, Iron Treads, and Mega Tyranitar that are able to help it break through walls through utility moves such as entry hazards or Knock Off. Latios pairs especially well with Fighting-type wallbreakers such as Buzzwole, Galarian Zapdos, and Iron Hands due to their favorable matchups into the Steel- and Dark-types looking to switch into Latios's STAB moves.

Aura Sphere is chosen to threaten the only Pokemon able to survive a boosted Stored Power: Dark-types like Meowscarada, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon. Latios fits best on hyper offense teams, which require support from Pokemon such as Excadrill, Iron Treads, and lead Meowscarada that can set entry hazards for Latios to secure important KOs late-game. Grimmsnarl's dual screens deserve a special mention, as Latios relies on them to safely set up or activate Weakness Policy.

If the team already has entry hazards covered, Clear Smog can be used to stop common setup sweepers such as Victini and Clefable that would otherwise greatly threaten Gastrodon and its teammates. Scald is used to cripple both physical attackers and poison-immune Pokemon with a burn. Earthquake is an alternative for more immediate pressure against Poison- and Steel-types such as Galarian Slowking and Iron Moth, but it leaves Gastrodon unable to punish switch-ins like Celesteela and Skarmory.

After using Z-Celebrate, Victini outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame as well as common Choice Scarf users such as Tapu Fini. The boost to Victini's defenses eases setup and makes it more difficult for priority moves such as Shadow Sneak from Aegislash and Sucker Punch from Meowscarada to revenge kill it; in addition, it lets Victini survive attacks such as Earthquake from Excadrill, giving it the option to set up against them. At +1, Victini's Searing Shot OHKOes most Aegislash variants after Stealth Rock. Stored Power pairs nicely with Z-Celebrate, reaching 120 BP after the latter move is used, enabling Victini to deal massive damage to Fire-resistant foes such as Mega Aerodactyl and Tapu Fini, OHKOing the former after Stealth Rock. Stored Power's Base Power rise after setting up also enables Victini to 2HKO Unaware users such as Quagsire and physically defensive Skeledirge. Focus Blast pairs well with Victini's STAB moves, hitting top threats such as Mega Tyranitar, and its poor accuracy is mitigated somewhat by Victory Star. Alternatively, Energy Ball lets Victini destroy specially defensive Gastrodon, which otherwise takes little from even a boosted Stored Power. Z-Celebrate Victini fits best on hyper offense teams as a late-game cleaner. Entry hazard support from Mew, Excadrill, Iron Treads, and lead Meowscarada can help wear down foes such as Tapu Fini and Slowbro into range of Victini's attacks. Excadrill and Iron Treads also offer Rapid Spin to remove hazards for Victini. Dual screens support from Grimmsnarl makes it easier for Victini to set up and makes it harder for defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon to chip it and Choice Scarf or priority users such as Meowscarada to revenge kill it. Good offensive partners for Victini include Swords Dance Scizor and Autotomize Celesteela. Finally, Celesteela and Victini share similar checks in specially bulky Pokemon like Gastrodon and Mega Latias, so they can weaken each other's checks to enable one of them to sweep.</p>"

Trick lets Victini cripple an opposing physical wall such as Slowbro by giving it a Choice Band. Bolt Strike targets Water-types, notably 2HKOing Slowbro and physically defensive Tapu Fini Choice Band Victini fits best on offensive and bulky offense teams, where it serves as a powerful early- or mid-game wallbreaker. Victini is vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards and therefore appreciates entry hazard removal from Excadrill, Iron Treads, or Tapu Fini. Excadrill and Iron Treads can also set Stealth Rock to weaken Victini's checks such as Slowbro into range of its attacks. Victini also greatly enjoys U-turn or Teleport support to let it hit the field to launch its powerful V-create. Meowscarada, Scizor, and Slowbro are all good Pokemon that fulfill this role. Scizor can even trap some of Victini's checks, such as Mega Latias, with Pursuit. Since Victini can struggle to reliably pressure some of its aforementioned checks, like Slowbro thanks to Regenerator, a partner that can take advantage of them, such as SubToxic Aegislash or Nasty Plot Hydreigon, is also appreciated. Finally, a good late-game cleaner such as Autotomize Celesteela or Serperior can finish off a team weakened by Victini. On sun teams, Venusaur is a good option for a cleaner that pairs well with Victini and enjoys its ability to punish Pokemon used to check it, such as Blissey.</p>"

After a Swords Dance boost, it can effectively outspeed and break through a large portion of the metagame with its strong STAB moves. Steelium Z allows Excadrill to eliminate chipped switch-ins such as Buzzwole and Tangrowth after a Swords Dance boost. Rapid Spin supports the team while also making sure that Excadrill can beat other Sand Rush Excadrill and Unburden Hawlucha. If a teammate can remove entry hazards, Rock Slide is an alternative that stops Celesteela and Skarmory from stonewalling Excadrill, as well as handling threats such as both Thundurus formes. As a Sand Rush sweeper, Excadrill needs to partner with Tyranitar or Hippowdon to outpace the entire metagame. Strong wallbreakers like Choice Band Tyranitar, Latios, and Dracozolt form a strong offensive core with Excadrill to help overwhelm its checks such as Slowbro or Skarmory. In return, Excadrill can pressure threats such as Iron Hands, Galarian Slowking, and Iron Treads for them, respectively. Additionally, Choice Scarf users such as Meowscarada, Latias, and Tapu Fini can help pressure some of Excadrill's checks, such as Buzzwole and Tangrowth, while also acting as secondary speed control options outside of sand. Tapu Fini in particular is a great partner to protect Excadrill from burns while setting up, thanks to its Misty Terrain, while also handling Buzzwole for it. Slowbro and Slowking handle Fighting- and Fire-types for it such as Buzzwole and Victini, as well as providing Future Sight support and safely getting Excadrill on the field with Teleport. Other Pokemon such as Serperior and Aegislash are valuable support options that can handle its checks, such as Slowbro or Skarmory, while spreading status such as paralysis or Toxic for Excadrill to break through threats more easily.</p>"

The listed EV spread outruns Jolly Mega Tyranitar, and the Attack EVs and nature make Excadrill less passive against threats such as Mega Latias and Scizor; the specific listed arrangement slightly optimizes the stat. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Defense to better check threats such as Aegislash and Mega Latias. Toxic is a great option to cripple common switch-ins to Excadrill such as Buzzwole, Tangrowth, and Slowbro while pressuring other threats such as Latias and Mega Sableye, providing more long-term support for its teammates. Iron Head can be used to check threats such as Clefable more easily. Swords Dance is an option, if running Iron Head instead of Toxic, to become a powerful setup sweeper. If running Swords Dance, then a more offensive EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used. Stealth Rock is another option that gives Excadrill additional role compression as a hazard setter. Excadrill can struggle against physical walls such as Slowbro, Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Celesteela. Serperior, Latios, and the Thundurus formes can help deal with those defensive checks, and in return, Excadrill can check threats such as Aegislash and Galarian Slowking for them. Excadrill can be forced out by faster threats such as Galarian Zapdos, Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Blacephalon; defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro and Tapu Fini can help manage them, and these also give Excadrill slow pivoting in Teleport and Misty Terrain, respectively. Other defensive pivots such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu can help deal with Ground- and Water-type checks such as Iron Treads, Gastrodon, and Tapu Fini; however, run High Horsepower instead of Earthquake if pairing with Tapu Bulu due to Grassy Terrain cutting Earthquake's power in half.

Toxic is another option to cripple opposing hazard setters and Mega Sableye long-term. Focus Sash is an important item to ensure that Excadrill can reliably set Stealth Rock. Excadrill can struggle against threats such as Skarmory and Celesteela due to their Ground immunities; strong setup sweepers such as the Thundurus formes, Meteor Beam Celesteela, and Nihilego can pressure them for it.

Substitute allows Aegislash to take advantage of the aforementioned Pokemon's inability to deal sufficient damage to it while also protecting it from potential status moves from these Pokemon; it also allows it to safely land Toxic on incoming defensive walls such as Gastrodon, stalling them out in conjunction with King's Shield and recovery from Leftovers. Shadow Ball serves as Aegislash's main STAB move, and alongside Aegislash's naturally high Special Attack stat, is useful for putting pressure onto Toxic-immune Pokemon such as Iron Moth, Excadrill, and Mega Sableye. SubToxic Aegislash fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its ability to safely set up on and wear down defensive Pokemon while also making use of its ability to simultaneously check offensive threats such as Galarian Zapdos and Latios. Due to Aegislash's fear of status moves, like Scald burns from the likes of Slowking, as well as Spore from Amoonguss, pivots such as Flip Turn Keldeo, U-turn Iron Moth, and Teleport Blissey are helpful to ensure that Aegislash finds safe opportunities against them. Other defensive Pokemon such as Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Clefable can form notable cores with Aegislash; the former two take advantage of Dark- and Ground-types such as Meowscarada and Hippowdon, while Clefable provides additional support in staving off the likes of Latios and Buzzwole, which can potentially nail Aegislash on the switch with Mystical Fire or Earthquake, respectively. Knock Off users such as the aforementioned Clefable and Assault Vest Tangrowth are also helpful, as they can remove items from checks to Aegislash like Leftovers from Celesteela and Heavy-Duty Boots from Iron Moth and Scizor, giving it an easier time breaking through them in the long-run.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Swords Dance turns Aegislash into a potent wallbreaker and sweeper, using its fantastic neutral coverage and bulk in Shield forme to set up against and break through defensive cores. Close Combat is Aegislash's strongest move overall, and it threatens the many Dark-types that would otherwise resist its Ghost-type STAB moves, like Mega Tyranitar and Hydreigon. Iron Head is an alternative option that still OHKOes the former two after a boost while also 2HKOing Unaware Clefable. Shadow Sneak is a crucial priority move which at +2 can finish off weakened offensive Pokemon that would normally outspeed and take it out, such as Iron Moth and Keldeo, while also being usable to pick off Latios and Alakazam without a boost. Ghostium Z is usually preferred to power up STAB Shadow Claw, which, when turned into Never Ending Nightmare, threatens to KO physically defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory and Amoonguss after Swords Dance. However, Air Balloon can be run instead if the team already has a different Z-Move user, and this also allows Aegislash to find free setup opportunities against Ground-types such as Excadrill and Hippowdon, potentially spinblocking the former. Aegislash fits best on more offensive teams that appreciate its defensive utility and ability to break open holes for its teammates early-game. Other sweepers such as Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar can benefit from Ghostium-Z variants of Aegislash forcing in and eliminating Buzzwole, Hippowdon, and Tangrowth; in return, these Pokemon can help Aegislash weaken certain walls like Mandibuzz early-game. Aegislash also suffers from having terrible bulk in Blade forme, so it is easily revenge killed after attacking, making entry hazard support from the likes of Mew and lead Meowscarada helpful at chipping down offensive threats like Excadrill into Shadow Sneak range while also pressuring other walls such as Tapu Fini. On hyper offense teams, Grimmsnarl can use Reflect and Light Screen to give Aegislash more opportunities to set up while bringing it in safely with Parting Shot if needed.</p>"

Close Combat forms almost perfect neutral coverage with Shadow Ball, notably 2HKOing Blissey and OHKOing Mega Tyranitar after Stealth Rock. Shadow Sneak gives Aegislash additional utility in being able to pick off weakened offensive Pokemon such as Latios and Blacephalon when needed. King's Shield prevents Aegislash from being picked off by Pursuit users like Tyranitar and lets it scout Choice-locked revenge killers such as Keldeo and Meowscarada. 8 Attack EVs with a Mild nature are necessary for Aegislash to 2HKO Chansey with Close Combat after Stealth Rock. Mixed Aegislash commonly features on more offensive teams that appreciate its instant wallbreaking power combined with its utility. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar can be very crucial in helping Aegislash secure 2HKOes against Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Amoonguss on the switch. While Aegislash can find additional opportunities by pivoting directly into attackers such as Latios and Galarian Zapdos, it is often unable to preserve its HP to continue wallbreaking after doing so; as such, pivots like Cinderace and Galarian Slowking are essential to let Aegislash enter the battlefield safely against Pokemon it would like to force out, such as Slowbro. Other setup Pokemon such as Nasty Plot Thundurus-T and Hydreigon can help overwhelm shared checks to this set, such as Hippowdon; in return, they benefit from Aegislash's ability to keep faster Pokemon like Latios and Alakazam in check.</p>"

Misty Surge makes it excellent at regaining momentum against status users, such as Clefable, Skarmory, and Blissey, allowing setup teammates like Aegislash to more freely set up against these Pokemon. Scald provides Tapu Fini with a STAB move that can burn the likes of Celesteela and Tapu Bulu attempting to take advantage of it while also letting it apply pressure to targets such as Iron Moth and Blade forme Aegislash. Alternatively, Nature's Madness allows Tapu Fini to hit defensive Pokemon it would otherwise be unable to punish for switching in, like Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and Amoonguss. Defog keeps entry hazards off against walls that its typing enables it to match up well against, like Skarmory. Taunt, besides preventing the aforementioned Pokemon from relaying hazards in front of Tapu Fini, also denies healing and setup attempts from Pokemon like Clefable, Blissey, and Aegislash, particularly when used in combination with Nature's Madness to more quickly wear down said targets. 96 Speed EVs ensure that Tapu Fini outruns Adamant Scizor, letting it shut down potential Swords Dance attempts against it, while the rest is put into Defense to maximize its walling capabilities against Pokemon such as Buzzwole, Psyshock Latios, and Excadrill. Defog Tapu Fini fits onto many bulky offense and balance teams for its valuable role compression. Tapu Fini is prone to being overwhelmed and lacks any form of healing outside of Leftovers, which makes other defensive Pokemon that can support it against the aforementioned threats extremely valuable; these include Pokemon such as Skarmory and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Wish users such as Jirachi and Blissey are also highly noticeable in this regard for their ability to keep Tapu Fini healthy throughout the game in addition to synergizing with it immensely by handling special attackers that can threaten Tapu Fini, such as Serperior and Alakazam, while also gaining protection from the latter's Glare in return. Other defensive Pokemon like Buzzwole, Assault Vest Galarian Slowking, and Mega Aggron benefit from Tapu Fini's ability to clear hazards, allowing them to more safely leverage their HP to check the threats they are meant to deal with. Finally, powerful offensive Pokemon that appreciate Misty Terrain's effects, like Swords Dance Aegislash and Choice Band Tyranitar, also enjoy being able to fall back on Tapu Fini to deal with offensive threats like Keldeo and clear hazards, improving their potential to wallbreak throughout the game.</p>"

Additionally, Tapu Fini can still uphold its natural defensive qualities and bulk to switch into other threats like Cinderace and Latios when needed, before outspeeding and threatening them too, while also providing Defog support. Hydro Pump is Tapu Fini's strongest move to hit Iron Moth and Excadrill with, OHKOing both after Stealth Rock damage, but Surf can be used instead if accuracy is a concern despite having less power. Trick allows Tapu Fini to cripple an incoming wall that would normally try to take advantage of it, like Blissey and Amoonguss. Defog allows Tapu Fini to clear entry hazards for its team in a pinch, especially once it has Tricked away its Choice Scarf, but if Defog is already found on another Pokemon, Taunt and Nature's Madness are options that can be used instead to further mess with most defensive Pokemon, chipping them down quickly or denying healing attempts. The given EV spread ensures that Tapu Fini survives a +2 Acrobatics from Hawlucha and outspeeds Mega Aerodactyl. Tapu Fini fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its defensive utility and role compression. Wallbreakers that benefit from its ability to check faster offensive threats like Keldeo and Galarian Zapdos include Pokemon such as Swords Dance Aegislash, Choice Band Tyranitar, and Mega Heracross, with each additionally benefiting from Misty Terrain's status immunity. On the other hand, Tapu Fini's tendency to lure in defensive Pokemon that it can Trick its Choice Scarf over to, like Blissey and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking, can be exploited by Pokemon that normally struggle to break past them, such as Iron Moth and Nasty Plot Hydreigon.

Its naturally great bulk and Steel/Flying typing afford it setup opportunities against foes like Scizor and Excadrill, as well as the ability to easily muscle past them. Meteor Beam combined with Power Herb lets Celesteela boost its Special Attack without needing a KO. Given that it's Celesteela's strongest attack, in some situations it should be saved to instead target a foe Celesteela would otherwise have trouble breaking through like Skeledirge or Victini. Air Slash serves as a spammable STAB attack, 2HKOing most of the tier at +1, though it can OHKO many Bug- and Grass-types like Buzzwole and Meowscarada unboosted. Its chance to flinch its foes can also come in handy against special walls and Regenerator users like Gastrodon and Galarian Slowking, which could otherwise stop Celesteela's sweep. Fire Blast primarily targets Steel-types, OHKOing foes like Scizor unboosted and Aegislash and opposing Celesteela after a few boosts. Celesteela best fits on offense teams looking for a cleaner, forming a potent offensive combination with other sweepers like Iron Hands and Bisharp. Alternatively, if the opportunity arises, it can instead be used as a mid-game wallbreaker and have a teammate clean using the holes it creates. However, it has no way to break through certain special walls like Blissey and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking on its own, making physical attackers like Bisharp and Iron Hands necessary. While they share some overlapping counterplay, special sweepers like Booster Energy Iron Moth and Galarian Moltres also appreciate Celesteela's support for similar reasons, and they can still support each other by weakening some of each other's shared checks, such as Slowbro, Slowking, Latios, and Latias. Hazard setters like Lead Mew and Excadrill are crucial for their ability to weaken Celesteela's checks, making it harder for for foes like Galarian Slowking and Tapu Fini to remain healthy enough to check Celesteela.

Heavy Slam is another vital move that allows Celesteela to pressure threats such as Mega Tyranitar, Clefable, and Enamorus. Protect is good when used with Leech Seed to further wear down threats such as Iron Treads and Aegislash without Substitute while also letting it scout Choice-locked foes such as Latios and Victini. Toxic can be used over Protect on more offensive teams to make faster progress against threats such as Mega Latias, Mega Tyranitar, Hydreigon, and Galarian Moltres and also wear down bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Gastrodon. Flamethrower is an important coverage move to tackle Steel- and Grass-types such as Iron Treads, Aegislash, Skarmory, Serperior, and Meowscarada. Leftovers synergizes very well with Leech Seed and Protect to recover large swaths of HP. Celesteela struggles a lot against Fire-types such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Victini, so bulky Fire-resistant teammates such as Slowking, Mega Latias, and Mega Tyranitar are greatly appreciated to keep them at bay. Mega Tyranitar in particular is capable of Pursuit trapping Fire-types to deal with them. Electric-types such as Sandy Shocks and both Thundurus formes also annoy Celesteela greatly with Volt Switch, so Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon are important for halting their pivoting, and in return Celesteela can deal with Grass-types such as Serperior for them. Grass-types such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Serperior are good at handling Water-types that annoy Celesteela such as Slowbro, Alomomola, and Tapu Fini while also being secondary checks to Electric-types. Dangerous physical attackers such as Galarian Zapdos and Choice Band Meowscarada can easily overwhelm Celesteela, so physical walls such as Slowbro, Buzzwole, and Mega Altaria make for great partners to help deal with them.

        "description": "<p>Grimmsnarl is an incredibly valuable dual screens setter thanks to Prankster giving its status moves priority, allowing it to enable popular setup sweepers on hyper offense teams. Spirit Break prevents Grimmsnarl from being shut down by prominent Dark-types such as Mega Tyranitar, Hydreigon, and Mega Sableye and also helps prevent it from being too passive against threats such as Iron Hands and Buzzwole. Taunt denies entry hazards from foes such as Skarmory, Gastrodon, and Chansey; prevents Defog attempts from Tapu Fini; and stops setup sweepers such as Excadrill and Cinderace from using Grimmsnarl as setup fodder. Parting Shot can be used over Spirit Break or Taunt to generate momentum for Grimmsnarl's team while also weakening a foe, but dropping Spirit Break or Taunt leaves Grimmsnarl vulnerable to Dark-types or entry hazard setters and setup sweepers, respectively. The given EVs let Grimmsnarl avoid an OHKO from Life Orb Scizor's Bullet Punch, with the rest dumped into Special Defense. Grimmsnarl fits best on hyper offense teams, which enjoy the dual screens support it can provide. Fighting-type setup sweepers such as Galarian Zapdos and Iron Hands make for good partners to take care of Dark- and Steel-types such as Mega Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Iron Treads for it. Other setup sweepers and late-game cleaners such as Iron Moth, Autotomize Celesteela, and Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar appreciate the support provided by Grimmsnarl's dual screens to set up easier. Entry hazard setters such as Excadrill and Mew also pair well with Grimmsnarl to further support their teammates while also using it's dual screens support to place hazards more consistently.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Enamorus is a potent sweeper, capable of beating common defensive staples in Skarmory, Mega Sableye, and Iron Treads. Its expansive coverage in Earth Power and Mystical Fire allows it to hit every Steel-type in the tier, such as Celesteela, Skarmory, Aegislash, and Scizor, for super effective damage, securing either an OHKO or a 2HKO on them with a Calm Mind boost. It also allows Enamorus to work around other Fairy-resistant foes such as Skeledirge, Galarian Slowking, and Iron Moth as well as offensive checks in Hisuian Arcanine and Victini, while its Speed tier allows it to outspeed and OHKO Nihilego. Taunt is an option to potentially beat and deny recovery from status users like Clefable, Hippowdon, and Chansey that try to slow down or stall Enamorus. These traits make it an excellent partner for Aegislash, with SubToxic variants appreciating the ability to threaten or KO Skeledirge and Steel-types like Iron Treads, while Swords Dance variants enjoy its ability to threaten Buzzwole, Iron Hands, and Whirlwind Skarmory. Similarly, Iron Moth enjoys many of its checks being removed, particularly Mega Tyranitar and Latias. However, Enamorus's frailty and lack of immediate power makes it difficult for it to break past checks such as Galarian Slowking and Celesteela, which threaten to OHKO it with Sludge Bomb and Heavy Slam, respectively, and are only 2HKOed after a Calm Mind boost. Similarly, Chansey can use Toxic and Seismic Toss to take advantage of Enamorus's lack of longevity. This means it appreciates partners such as Tyranitar and Bisharp, which are capable of Pursuit trapping Galarian Slowking and Chansey, as well as Cinderace, which can break past Celesteela as well as provide pivoting to bring Enamorus in safely. Its Speed tier also means it is pressured by faster threats such as Iron Moth and Latios. This means it enjoys speed control from partners such as Cinderace and Meowscarada, which are able to outspeed its offensive checks. To compensate for its relative frailty, it also enjoys slow pivots to bring it in safely, such as Slowbro, Galarian Slowking, and Scizor, and in return it provides an offensive check to the Dark-types they are threatened by, such as Mega Tyranitar, Meowscarada, and Hydreigon.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs allows Enamorus to be more immediately fearsome against bulky teams, now threatening 2HKOs on most Fairy-resistant foes without the need for a turn of setup. In addition to Earth Power and Mystical Fire, Superpower allows it to threaten a 3HKO on Chansey. This also allows Enamorus to potentially snowball through weakened teams once faster foes like Meowscarada and Cinderace have been removed. Alternatively, Psychic hits Poison-types that aren't weak to Earth Power, such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. In addition to Pursuit trappers like Mega Tyranitar, speed control from the likes of Cinderace, and slow pivots like Slowbro, Choice Specs Enamorus functions as an excellent partner to special sweepers such as Iron Moth, Keldeo, Blacephalon, and Serperior due to its ability to remove Galarian Slowking without competing for the same team slot. These options can also be used to remove Steel- and Poison-types to allow Enamorus to use its powerful Moonblast more freely. As Enamorus is weak to Stealth Rock, it appreciates being partnered with strong entry hazard removal options, such as Rapid Spin Iron Treads, Defog Salamence, Defog Tapu Fini, and Court Change Cinderace, which allow it to more easily work around opposing entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon and suicide leads like Excadrill. Due to its Choice Specs, however, Enamorus becomes prediction-reliant against teams that stack multiple Fairy-resistant foes, so Stealth Rock and Knock Off support from Clefable, Tyranitar, and Scizor allows it to more effectively break down its checks over the course of a game.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Meowscarada leverages its excellent power and Speed tier to act as one of the tier's premier revenge killers, outspeeding boosted offensive threats like Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar, Rapid Spin Excadrill, and Sandy Shocks, while also blazing past opposing Choice Scarf users such as Enamorus and Latias. Protean increases the damage output of its coverage moves, making them better suited at pressuring targets such as Mega Latias, Galarian Zapdos, and Hydreigon. Knock Off allows Meowscarada to remove important items from walls such as Clefable, Celesteela, and physically defensive Tangrowth, allowing it to break through them more easily. U-turn gives Meowscarada the ability to keep up momentum and in conjunction with Protean, severely dents opposing Meowscarada and Serperior that may try to stay in on it. Thunder Punch is critical for allowing Meowscarada to revenge kill targets like Autotomize Celesteela and Double Dance Galarian Moltres after their respective boosts, especially if the former has already used up its Power Herb. Alternatively, Play Rough can be used to hit other Fighting- and Dragon-types, most notably Buzzwole, Iron Hands, and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria, while retaining its ability to take out Galarian Moltres. If several of the aforementioned Pokemon are adequately covered by Meowscarada's teammates, Trick can be used to cripple an incoming wall, such as Buzzwole or Amoonguss. Choice Scarf Meowscarada fits best on balance and offensive teams. Pokemon such as Sandy Shocks and Skarmory are appreciated partners for laying entry hazards that capitalize on Meowscarada's ability to force switches and remove items such as Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from the opponent. Defensive pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Utility Jirachi also appreciate Meowscarada's ability to keep threats like Swords Dance Aegislash and Keldeo in check and can opt to safely bring it in against these Pokemon, as Meowscarada's poor defensive attributes often means it cannot switch into them directly. While Meowscarada is able to hit many of them super effectively, it can still struggle to deal lasting damage against walls such as Skarmory and Amoonguss, making offensive teammates that can take advantage of them, such as SubToxic Aegislash, Choice Band Victini, and Choice Specs Latios extremely valuable, all of which benefit from the opportunities provided by Meowscarada's U-turn in return.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Meowscarada packs colorful coverage in conjunction with Protean and its naturally high Speed tier, letting it serve as a powerful offensive pivot. Choice Band allows Meowscarada to OHKO several offensive Pokemon that it otherwise wouldn't, such as Aegislash and Iron Moth. In addition to this, Knock Off cripples defensive walls such as Scizor and Amoonguss by removing their respective items, while also serving as Meowscarada's most common move to use against neutral targets. U-turn allows Meowscarada to rack up momentum against Pokemon it forces out, such as Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Tapu Fini. Thunder Punch is usually preferred for its ability to 2HKO Skarmory outright, on top of hitting other crucial Flying-type checks such as Enamorus. However, Play Rough can be used instead to provide super effective coverage against other answers, 2HKOing the likes of physically defensive Buzzwole, Mega Sableye, and Mega Altaria. Sucker Punch is also a passable option in the last slot as a priority move that can finish off weakened offensive threats such as Autotomize Celesteela, Z-Celebrate Victini, and Sand Rush Excadrill. Choice Band Meowscarada fits best on more offensive teams, particularly those that appreciate its unique mix of wallbreaking and pivoting capabilities. Frailer offensive teammates that also benefit from Meowscarada's U-turn, such as Mixed Aegislash, Hisuian Zoroark, and Alakazam, can make for good teammates to pressure some of Meowscarada's checks, like Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur. Hisuian Zoroark in particular synergizes especially well, as disguising as Meowscarada with its Illusion ability can help force mindgames with the opponent; the threat of Hisuian Zoroark luring in and eliminating walls such as Buzzwole with Flamethrower can make the opponent much less eager to try and switch them into Meowscarada. Defensive pivots such as Scizor, Galarian Slowking, and Blissey, are also essential to let Meowscarada enter the field safely against more preferable targets, while also being great Pokemon to fall back on when faced with opposing revenge killers, such as Choice Scarf Latias and Enamorus. Galarian Slowking can also use Future Sight to remedy Meowscarada's lack of coverage against Fighting-types such as Buzzwole and Iron Hands. Entry hazard support from the likes of Clefable and Sandy Shocks benefit from Meowscarada's Knock Off removing items such as Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from defensive Pokemon like Clefable, on top of making it easier to break past them.</p>"

      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Lead Meowscarada is one of the fastest leads in the entire tier, which makes it highly effective at getting the jump on opposing leads. It also matches up very well against Grimmsnarl, as its Dark typing makes it immune to Prankster. Due to Meowscarada's insane Speed tier, Taunt allows it to dominate other leads by outspeeding and preventing them from getting their own entry hazards up, most notably Excadrill, Mew, and Hydreigon, while also blocking Defog from foes like Tapu Fini and Mandibuzz. Flower Trick, especially in conjunction with Overgrow, allows Meowscarada to deal significant damage to neutral foes before fainting, most notably 2HKOing Stealth Rock Clefable. Knock Off, on top of 2HKOing Lead Mew, can also remove items such as Skarmory's Rocky Helmet and Celesteela's Leftovers, making them easier to break through. Lead Meowscarada's extensive utility and positive matchups against similar archetypes make it a natural fit for hyper offense teams. Offensive Pokemon such as Swords Dance Scizor, Meteor Beam Celesteela, and Calm Mind Latios each appreciate Spikes' ability to wear down several of their grounded checks into range, like Mega Tyranitar and SubToxic Aegislash. Offensive Stealth Rock users, such as Sandy Shocks and Nihilego, can also synergize well with Meowscarada's Spikes to create even more offensive pressure for the opponent. As Lead Meowscarada tends to struggle against Mega Sableye due to Magic Bounce, Pokemon that can take advantage of it, such as Nasty Plot Galarian Moltres and Booster Energy Iron Moth, make for crucial offensive teammates that can fulfill this role effectively. In return, they favor Meowscarada's ability to remove their crippling weakness to Stealth Rock by shutting down the majority of Stealth Rock setters.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With the Speed boost from Agility and Special Attack Boost from Booster Energy, Iron Moth can effectively serve the role of a cleaner. Fiery Dance and Sludge Wave serve as spammable STAB attacks that hit the majority of the tier for neutral damage; the former has the potential to snowball through teams, thanks to its chance to raise the user's Special Attack further. Energy Ball primarily targets Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types like Hippowdon, Mega Tyranitar, and Slowking. Due to the all-or-nothing nature of this set, Iron Moth best fits on offense teams looking for a cleaner. It struggles against Ground-, Rock- and Water-types, so Grass- and Water-types like Serperior and Calm Mind Tapu Fini make good partners, as they can handle these threats. Physical wallbreakers like Iron Hands and Swords Dance Aegislash are also important, as Iron Moth has no way to get past Blissey and Chansey. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge also wall Iron Moth thanks to their typings and bulk, so Ghost- and Dark-types, and notably Pursuit users like Mega Tyranitar, can eliminate them for it. Iron Moth despises losing 25% of its health to Stealth Rock when switching in, so partners that can remove them, like Excadrill and Iron Treads, are much appreciated. Stealth Rock support is greatly appreciated, as it can push certain targets like Choice Band Tyranitar outside of Sandstorm and Hydreigon into KO range.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Offensive Iron Moth leverages its high number of resistances and good power to act as a dangerous offensive threat with Heavy-Duty Boots. Fire Blast serves as a powerful STAB move that threatens every neutral target that doesn't have immense special bulk. Fiery Dance is an alternative; it's notably weaker, missing out on the OHKO on Autotomize Celesteela and 2HKO on Iron Hands. However, in exchange, it has perfect accuracy, more PP, and its ability to boost Iron Moth's Special Attack can let it sweep late-game. Sludge Wave is Iron Moth's other STAB attack; besides hitting opposing Dragon- and Fire-types for neutral damage, it also breaks through Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Fini. Due to the amount of Pokemon it threatens out, such as Aegislash and Mega Sableye, Iron Moth is an effective setter of Toxic Spikes; Energy Ball is an alternative, serving as coverage against opposing Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types, like Gastrodon and Tyranitar, and finally, U-turn is another alternative, as the switches Iron Moth forces out let it act as an effective offensive pivot. Morning Sun gives Iron Moth reliable recovery, letting it avoid getting worn down by repeated attacks and Stealth Rock if its Heavy-Duty Boots are removed. Iron Moth best fits on balance and offensive teams looking for a fast and powerful special attacker with good utility. While Iron Moth can check most special attackers, even resisted hits from physical attackers like Cinderace can 2HKO it. Thus, physical walls and tanks like Buzzwole, Slowbro, and Galarian Slowking can check these foes for Iron Moth. Pivots, like the latter two, can also help Iron Moth find opportunities to switch in. If it is carrying U-turn, wallbreakers like Choice Band Meowscarada, Choice Specs Latios, and Enamorus appreciate Iron Moth's ability to pivot them in safely, while in return they can smash through the walls and many offensive threats that give Iron Moth trouble. Speed control, namely powerful priority users like Scizor and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Fini and Hydreigon, can also help eliminate physical attackers. Physical wallbreakers like Iron Hands and Aegislash can help against Blissey and Chansey, which wall Iron Moth. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge also wall Iron Moth, so Ghost- and Dark-types, notably Pursuit users like Mega Tyranitar, can remove them for it.</p>"
