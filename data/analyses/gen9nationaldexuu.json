        "description": "<p>Galarian Slowking is an excellent pivot owing to its combination of Regenerator and Chilly Reception, which gives it some of the best longevity in the tier. With its unique defensive typing and good bulk, it can check a wide variety of foes, notably Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Fini and Grass-types such as Serperior and Tapu Bulu. Sludge Bomb serves as a spammable STAB move that can hurt the longevity of targets such as Ting-Lu and Mega Sableye by poisoning them. Slack Off provides instant recovery Galarian Slowking can use without needing to switch out. Future Sight lets Galarian Slowking support wallbreakers and threaten Pokemon switching in to check it. Maximizing Galarian Slowking's physical bulk improves its ability to check physical attackers and lets it usually survive at least one Pursuit from an opposing Dark-type. 0 Speed IVs let Galarian Slowking move after its foes when using Chilly Reception, improving its pivoting capabilities. Terastallization is best used to shed Galarian Slowking's Ground and Dark weaknesses, which notably helps against Pursuit trappers. Tera Water specifically gives Galarian Slowking resistances to Water and Fire, letting it tank weather-boosted attacks from foes like Barraskewda and Victini to reset the weather using Chilly Reception. Galarian Slowking best fits on offensive teams looking for a splashable pivot and Future Sight support for wallbreakers that have difficulty coming onto the field, like Meowscarda and Mega Gallade. It struggles the most against Dark-types, which can absorb its Future Sight and threaten it. Tyranitar is a notable example due to its powerful Pursuit and Galarian Slowking's inability to hit it for neutral damage. Thus, bulky Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Buzzwole make good partners. Steel-types such as Aegislash, Iron Treads, and Celesteela also wall Galarian Slowking due to its lack of coverage, so the aforementioned Fighting-types and other checks to Steel-types, such as Fire-types like Iron Moth and Moltres, are effective support. Entry hazard stackers like Skarmory and Ting-Lu pair well with Galarian Slowking's ability to spread damage and pivot in offensive threats.</p> "

        "name": "Assault Vest",
        "description": "<p>Assault Vest Galarian Slowking is an effective special wall that uses its unique typing and wide coverage to act as a versatile tank. The overwhelming majority of special attackers in the tier, including difficult-to-wall foes like Serperior and Iron Moth, lack the means to effectively break through it. Meanwhile, Galarian Slowking's good Special Attack and coverage mean few Pokemon are not threatened by it. Regenerator lets Galarian Slowking have a form of healing while holding Assault Vest. Sludge Bomb is a spammable STAB move that can cripple switch-ins with poison. Future Sight lets Galarian Slowking support wallbreakers while also punishing Pokemon such as Blaziken and Dragon Dance Gyarados that would otherwise try and set up on it. Flamethrower primarily targets Steel-types like Aegislash and Celesteela. Scald hits Ground-types and potentially cripples physical attackers and walls like Ting-Lu and Mega Tyranitar. Tera Water is best used to remove Galarian Slowking's Ground and Dark weaknesses, which is notably important against Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar, while also letting it check some special attackers it otherwise can't, like Blacephalon and Kingdra under rain. This EV spread is used to guarantee that Galarian Slowking will not be 2HKOed by Latios's Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, with the remaining EVs being used to augment Galarian Slowking's Special Attack. Galarian Slowking best fits on bulky teams looking for a versatile tank that serves as a blanket check to most of the tier's special attackers. Examples of partners that appreciate this include Clefable, SubToxic Aegislash, and Gastrodon. Entry hazard removers like Tapu Fini and Moltres are crucial support, as even one layer of entry hazards significantly cuts into Galarian Slowking's recovery. Galarian Slowking struggles the most against Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar, as while no physical attacker enjoys switching into Galarian Slowking's Scald or Sludge Bomb, once on the field they usually force it to Terastallize to survive. Bulky Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Buzzwole, as well as physically defensive walls such as Skarmory and Tangrowth, can handle these foes for Galarian Slowking. Aegislash is another notable issue for Galarian Slowking, as its Ghost typing combined with its huge bulk and offenses lets it easily beat Galarian Slowking one-on-one. Fire- and Ground-types like Moltres and Iron Treads can serve as effective checks to it.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Mega Tyranitar’s excellent defensive stats, typing, and Pursuit enable it to carve a niche as a reliable entry hazard setter and Pursuit trapper. Stone Edge is a strong STAB option that OHKOes Iron Moth and Moltres while denting neutral targets such as Celesteela and Tapu Fini. Pursuit enables Mega Tyranitar to trap Psychic- and Ghost-types, like Latios and Blacephalon. Crunch offers a strong STAB move to hit bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types, like Aegislash and Mega Latias. It is also the strongest move Mega Tyranitar has to hit Galarian Slowking. Superpower is an option to snipe opposing Tyranitar and severely damage would-be switch-ins such as Excadrill and Iron Treads. 176 Speed EVs enable Mega Tyranitar to outspeed Aegislash and Celesteela. Offensive Fighting-types such as Buzzwole, Blaziken and Keldeo, appreciate Mega Tyranitar removing bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types. In exchange, Buzzwole covers Mega Tyranitar’s weaknesses to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, while Keldeo can bring Mega Tyranitar in safely with Flip Turn. Other teammates such as Iron Moth and Serperior offer some defensive synergy and appreciate Mega Tyranitar’s ability to remove Psychic- and Fire-types, respectively. Mega Tyranitar’s typing gives its weaknesses to prominent attacking types such as Fighting, Water and Ground, so Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Galarian Slowking can provide switch-ins to these types. The Future Sight support provided by the latter meshes well with Pursuit and dissuades Buzzwole and Iron Hands from switching in. Celesteela and Skarmory can help check Excadrill, Iron Treads, and Buzzwole, with Skarmory providing Spikes as a bonus. Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Aegislash can all check Fighting-types to some degree. Aegislash’s immunity to Fighting-type moves makes it an excellent partner to Mega Tyranitar, and it also eases the burden of checking Mega Latias, enabling Mega Tyranitar to run Superpower. Together they can wear down shared checks like Ting-Lu. Due to its lack of reliable recovery, Mega Tyranitar is vulnerable to being chipped down, so partners such as Choice Scarf Latias and Choice Band Scizor can ease the burden against frail sweepers such as Polteageist and Nihilego. Finally, Sand Rush Excadrill benefits from Mega Tyranitar’s Sand Stream and its ability to wear down Skarmory and Hippowdon.</p> "

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar utilizes its solid bulk and versatile offensive coverage to act as a threatening late-game cleaner. Ice Punch synergizes well with Stone Edge, as it chunks physically defensive Ground-types like Hippowdon, Ting-Lu, and physically defensive Tangrowth. Earthquake is a valuable coverage option to hit Excadrill, Iron Treads, Tera Steel Buzzwole, and non-Air Balloon Aegislash. Crunch is an alternative STAB option for Air Balloon Aegislash that also hits Mega Latias, Gastrodon, and Slowbro hard. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Cinderace with a single Dragon Dance. Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar is usually found on bulky offense or hyper offense since these structures provide adequate tools to facilitate setup. The main hindrances for Mega Tyranitar are physically defensive walls like Hippowdon, Tera Fairy or Water Skeledirge, Skarmory, and Clefable. Teammates like Serperior, Tapu Fini, Swords Dance Scizor, and Meteor Beam Celesteela can take advantage of these Pokemon. Serperior can lure in and use Glare against faster Pokemon that can outspeed +1 Mega Tyranitar, such as Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Mega Aerodactyl. Mega Tyranitar can also be revenge killed by common Fighting-types like Buzzwole, Keldeo, and Iron Hands even after a boost. Teammates such as Polteageist, Latios, and Aegislash offer valuable typings and can soft-check Fighting-types. In turn, they appreciate Mega Tyranitar’s ability to take advantage of specially defensive walls such as Blissey. Offensive Steel-types such as Iron Treads and Scizor can cut a Mega Tyranitar sweep short, and thus Fire-types like Blaziken, Cinderace, and Iron Moth are excellent partners. Magnezone deserves a special mention, as it traps Scizor and Skarmory. Sand Rush Excadrill appreciates Mega Tyranitar’s Sand Stream ability and in exchange offers insurance against Unaware Clefable. Mega Tyranitar is vulnerable to chip damage and thus appreciates pivoting support from Cinderace, Magnezone, Scizor, and Meowscarada. Slowbro and Galarian Slowking can bring in Mega Tyranitar safely with Teleport and Chilly Reception and offer Future Sight support for Buzzwole. Finally, dual screens support from Grimmsnarl and Alolan Ninetales eases setup, while Spikes from Ting-Lu, Meowscarada, and Mew wear down walls.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With its high Attack and Speed stats, good coverage moves, and inability to be worn down by entry hazards thanks to Heavy-Duty Boots, Cinderace is a versatile pivot that is able to outspeed and offensively respond to various threats such as Latios and Clefable. Pyro Ball is Cinderace's main STAB move, allowing it to hit Steel-types such as Celesteela and Excadrill while also dealing significant damage to other defensive Pokemon such as Buzzwole and Amoonguss; it notably preserves Libero's type-changing ability in the process. U-turn, besides allowing Cinderace to maintain momentum by bringing in a teammate like Hydreigon, can also wear down defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro. Gunk Shot gives Cinderace useful coverage for Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Mega Altaria, and it also lets Cinderace force out Calm Mind Clefable more reliably. Alternatively, High Jump Kick is an option to OHKO Mega Tyranitar and Hydreigon, as well as 2HKO physically defensive Ting-Lu, which U-turn cannot do. Sucker Punch lets Cinderace revenge kill chipped sweepers such as Agility Iron Moth and Z-Celebrate variants of Victini after their respective boosts while also threatening Choice Scarf users such as Blacephalon. Tera Fire is preferred to strengthen Pyro Ball's damage output against neutral targets, letting it OHKO offensive Pokemon such as Galarian Moltres after Stealth Rock and giving it favorable odds to 2HKO the likes of physically defensive Galarian Slowking and Iron Hands. Cinderace fits best on offensive teams that can supply it with the tools needed to break through defensive Pokemon; entry hazard setters such as Mega Tyranitar, Ting-Lu, and Iron Treads can support Cinderace in this manner, with Mega Tyranitar also being able to trap or force Slowbro and Skeledirge to Terastallize with Pursuit after Cinderace pivots against them. Similarly, defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela, Slowbro, and Tapu Fini appreciate Cinderace's ability to threaten out the likes of Aegislash, Meowscarada, and Scizor; in return, they can help sponge the Water- and Ground-type moves aimed at Cinderace or provide Future Sight or Taunt support in the case of the latter two. Powerful wallbreakers such as Latios and Gengar also appreciate the safe entry Cinderace can facilitate against most physically defensive Pokemon it commonly invites in on top of Cinderace being able to force out the Steel-types that would otherwise threaten them, like Aegislash and Scizor.</p> "

At +2, Breakneck Blitz manages to OHKO the likes of Slowbro and physically defensive Moltres after Libero, and it is also effective at nullifying the possibility of other walls like Buzzwole and Amoonguss Terastallizing against it. High Jump Kick is a necessary coverage option to let Cinderace reliably KO Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu. Cinderace fits best on hyper offense teams that benefit from its ability to break open defensive cores; as Cinderace is often revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Choice Scarf Latias, other Pokemon that can take advantage of these revenge killers like Galarian Moltres, Swords Dance Scizor, and Bulk Up Galarian Zapdos become valuable teammates, as they also appreciate Cinderace's innate ability to threaten common walls such as Buzzwole and Skarmory. Cinderace also appreciates having dual screens support from Grimmsnarl to improve its setup opportunities, while anti-entry hazard options such as Excadrill and Iron Treads can help alleviate Cinderace's crippling Stealth Rock weakness.</p> "

        "name": "Agility + Booster Energy",
        "description": "<p>With stat boosts from Agility and Booster Energy, Iron Moth can effectively serve the role of a cleaner. Fiery Dance and Sludge Wave serve as spammable STAB attacks that hit the majority of the tier for neutral damage; the former has the potential to snowball through teams, thanks to its chance to raise the user's Special Attack further. Energy Ball primarily targets Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types like Ting-Lu, Mega Tyranitar, and Slowking. Terastallization is best used when Iron Moth is faced with Ground- and Water-types; trading these weaknesses for resistances, particularly Ground, can give it a crucial extra turn to set up or attack. The newly gained STAB damage on Grass-type moves is also notable, as it turns some 3HKOs like Ting-Lu into 2HKOs and 2HKOs like on specially defensive Hippowdon into OHKOs. Losing its Psychic-type weakness can also help against select foes such as Future Sight users like Slowking and Slowbro. Due to the all-or-nothing nature of this set, Iron Moth best fits on offense teams looking for a cleaner. It struggles against Ground-, Rock- and Water-types, which usually force it to Terastallize, so Grass- and Water-types like Serperior, Calm Mind Tapu Fini, and Gyarados make good partners, as they can handle these threats. Physical wallbreakers like Iron Hands and Swords Dance Aegislash are also important, as Iron Moth has no way to get past Blissey and Chansey. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge also wall Iron Moth thanks to their typings and bulk, so Ghost- and Dark-types, and notably Pursuit users like Mega Tyranitar, can eliminate them for it. Iron Moth despises losing 25% of its health to Stealth Rock when switching in, so partners that can remove them, like Excadrill and Iron Treads, are much appreciated. Stealth Rock support is greatly appreciated, as it can push certain targets like Choice Band Tyranitar outside of Sandstorm and Hydreigon into KO range.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<p>Offensive Iron Moth leverages its high number of resistances and good power to act as a dangerous offensive threat with Heavy-Duty Boots. Fire Blast serves as a powerful STAB move that threatens every neutral target that doesn't have immense special bulk. Fiery Dance is an alternative; it's notably weaker, missing out on the OHKO on Autotomize Celesteela and 2HKO on Iron Hands. However, in exchange, it has perfect accuracy, more PP, and its ability to boost Iron Moth's Special Attack can let it sweep late-game. Sludge Wave is Iron Moth's other STAB attack; besides hitting opposing Dragon- and Fire-types for neutral damage, it also breaks through Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Fini. Due to the amount of Pokemon it threatens out, such as Aegislash and Mega Sableye, Iron Moth is an effective setter of Toxic Spikes; Energy Ball is an alternative, serving as coverage against opposing Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types, like Gastrodon and Tyranitar, and finally, U-turn is another alternative, as the switches Iron Moth forces out let it act as an effective offensive pivot. Morning Sun gives Iron Moth reliable recovery, letting it avoid getting worn down by repeated attacks and Stealth Rock if its Heavy-Duty Boots are removed. Iron Moth can Tera Grass to exchange its Ground and Water weaknesses for resistances, which can flip matchups with Pokemon of these types, particularly if Iron Moth is carrying a now STAB Energy Ball. It also makes Iron Moth shed its Stealth Rock weakness. Tera Fire is an alternative that massively boosts the power of Iron Moth's Fire-type STAB moves, notably letting it OHKO foes it couldn't previously like Assault Vest Tangrowth with Fire Blast and Celesteela with Fiery Dance. For both Tera types, losing its Psychic weakness can also help Iron Moth tank some attacks like Future Sight from Slowking and Slowbro. Iron Moth best fits on balance and offensive teams looking for a fast and powerful special attacker with good utility. While Iron Moth can check most special attackers, even resisted hits from physical attackers like Cinderace can 2HKO it. Thus, physical walls and tanks like Buzzwole, Slowbro, and Galarian Slowking can check these foes for Iron Moth. Pivots, like the latter two, can also help Iron Moth find opportunities to switch in. If it is carrying U-turn, wallbreakers like Choice Band Meowscarada and Choice Specs Latios and Enamorus appreciate Iron Moth's ability to pivot them in safely, while in return they can smash through the walls and many offensive threats that give Iron Moth trouble. Speed control, namely powerful priority users like Scizor and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Fini and Hydreigon, can also help eliminate physical attackers. Physical wallbreakers like Iron Hands and Aegislash can help against Blissey and Chansey, which wall Iron Moth. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge both wall Iron Moth, so Ghost- and Dark-types, notably Pursuit users like Mega Tyranitar, can remove them for it.</p> "
