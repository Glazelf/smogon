As a dual status spreader, Butterfree is outclassed by Drowzee, which does more damage and has fantastic defensive utility.

While most slower threats don't want to face Butterfree before Sleep Powder is used, afterwards Drowzee serves as a strong check that doesn't mind its attacks or paralysis, so wallbreakers like Pinsir and Fearow help out considerably. Butterfree is best used to put a foe to sleep as quickly as possible and then try to spread paralysis before being knocked out. Butterfree can notably switch into slower Earthquake users like Machamp and Graveler and then put them to sleep.

Beedrill can only effectively contribute by setting up with Swords Dance and Agility, which is nearly impossible to pull off since even the weakest foes 3HKO it. One would think Twineedle gives it a niche against Psychic-types, but Beedrill flops even against the incredibly frail Abra, OHKOing it a mere 25.6% of the time.

Beedrill outspeeds Drowzee but isn't even guaranteed to 2HKO it, and Drowzee has a small chance to OHKO back. The ubiquity of Fire-types does Beedrill no favors, as it deals pitiful damage to them and they outspeed and OHKO it, leaving it few chances to even find entry, let alone progress.

This combined with many teams choosing not to use a sleeper at all makes Parasect not worth using.

Additionally, its terrible Ground- and Psychic-type weaknesses leave it OHKOed and 2HKOed, respectively, by every common Earthquake and Psychic in the tier.

    "overview": "<p>In the first generation of Pokemon, Normal-types aren't to be taken lightly thanks to powerful STAB moves such as Body Slam, Double-Edge, and the infamous Hyper Beam. Even all the way down in RBY PU, Lickitung exists to prove that not all Normal-types are created equal, falling far short of Fearow and Porygon. Lickitung initially looks promising with its access to STAB Hyper Beam and Swords Dance, amazing coverage options, and potential to spread paralysis with Body Slam. However, it falls short everywhere else due to its absolutely horrendous stats. Its atrocious Speed makes it slower than almost every relevant Pokemon, and is 3HKOed or 4HKOed by the majority of the tier. Lickitung can theoretically win one-on-one against physically frail Pokemon like Staryu and Gastly, but the damage taken in return leaves Lickitung easily revenge killed. Furthermore, Lickitung is almost entirely outclassed by Pinsir, which boasts much higher Attack, Defense, and Speed; in fact, Pinsir's Normal-type attacks hit harder than Lickitung's. Lickitung's only niche is its ability to sweep with Swords Dance, which is something Pinsir can do better. For these reasons, Lickitung remains a terrible Pokemon in RBY PU, and it shouldn't be used unless you're looking to torture yourself.</p> ",
    "sets": [{"name": "Swords Dance", "description": "<p>After a Swords Dance, Lickitung is able to OHKO or 2HKO the entire tier with the combination of Body Slam, Earthquake, and Hyper Beam. Body Slam is Lickitung's safest move; it deals decent damage to neutral targets, and paralysis helps mitigate Lickitung's horrendous Speed. Earthquake is its best option against Omanyte and Gastly, which would otherwise wall it, and the plethora of Fire- and Poison-types in the tier, all of which it OHKOes or 2HKOes at +2. Hyper Beam is Lickitung's most powerful move, and does 60% at minimum to every neutral target in the tier after a Swords Dance. If you must use Lickitung, it is absolutely imperative that its teammates spread paralysis as much as possible before revealing it. Teammates such as Porygon, Staryu, and Dragonair can be very useful as they can spread status without much trouble.</p> "}],

  "Seaking": {
    "overview": "<p>Seaking’s high attacking stats and access to STAB Surf make it one of the most fearsome mixed attackers in the tier. It can function as a mid-game wallbreaker as well as use Agility to become a deadly late-game cleaner. Seaking's bulk is also fantastic; it can comfortably avoid 2HKOs from Nidoqueen, Pinsir, and Fearow. Seaking’s Water typing gives it very few weaknesses, only really having to worry about non-STAB Thunderbolt from Nidoqueen, Dragonair, Staryu, and Gastly. However, Seaking is almost completely walled by an unparalyzed Staryu, which resists Surf, can paralyze Seaking with Thunder Wave, and can use Recover to heal off the damage from Seaking’s Normal-type moves while wearing it down. Although Staryu doesn't outclass Seaking, which still boasts better attacking stats and bulk, it is generally seen as the preferred Water-type thanks to its higher Speed and better movepool. Seaking is quite slow, requiring Agility to outspeed key threats such as Nidoqueen, Rapidash, Pinsir, and Fearow, while Staryu outspeeds Nidoqueen naturally. Although Seaking is bulky, it lacks reliable recovery, meaning it can be overwhelmed by the strong physical attackers in the tier. Despite these weaknesses, Seaking is still a formidable Pokemon, and its fearsome offensive presence should not be ignored when building a team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Blizzard is able to secure a 2HKO on Fearow, Dragonair, and the rare Grass-types, which Seaking’s standard set is unable to do. However Surf hits everything else harder, and Blizzard generally isn't preferred over Seaking's Normal-type moves. The remainder of Seaking's options are much more niche. Rest is an option to give Seaking longevity, but the offensive nature of the tier makes it very difficult for Seaking to find an opportunity to wake up, and Staryu’s access to Recover makes it a much better Water-type for this role. Tail Whip and Mimic can be used as anti-Staryu options. Two Tail Whips get Staryu into Hyper Beam OHKO range, and Mimic can potentially copy Thunder Wave, Recover, or a coverage move from Staryu. However, both of these options are inconsistent and are generally not recommended.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Staryu: Staryu is without a doubt Seaking’s biggest counter. An unparalyzed Staryu can switch into Seaking then use Recover until it KOes itself from Double-Edge recoil. If Seaking uses Hyper Beam or Agility, Staryu can then paralyze it safely and continue to use Recover until it fully paralyzes.</p> <p><strong>Dragonair</strong>: Seaking without Blizzard is helpless against Dragonair, and even if Seaking is running Blizzard it’s still outsped and can be wrapped. Dragonair is also one of the few Thunderbolt users in the tier, which Seaking does not appreciate.</p> <p><strong>Fearow and Pinsir:</strong> Although neither can switch into Seaking, Pinsir and Fearow both beat Seaking one-on-one; Fearow does, however, usually lose against Blizzard Seaking. Even if they lose the one-on-one fight, they’ll have chipped Seaking enough that something else can revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Seaking</strong>: Seaking is able to switch into itself well, and the face-off will typically result in the winning Seaking being at low enough HP that something can revenge kill it, although it will probably be able to fire off one more attack before being KOed if it set up Agility.</p> <p><strong>Slowpoke</strong>: Although rare, Slowpoke is able to switch into Seaking and paralyze it, which generally forces it out. Slowpoke is also able to hit it neutrally with Psychic and reapply the paralysis Speed drop with Amnesia.</p> <p><strong>Vileplume and Weepinbell:</strong> The rare Vileplume and Weepinbell are able to switch into a Seaking lacking Blizzard and inflict it with either paralysis or sleep. Weepinbell also has Razor Leaf, which 2HKOes Seaking.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Surf is Seaking’s strongest move and can 3HKO almost every non-resistant Pokemon in the tier. Surf importantly 2HKOes Nidoqueen, the best Pokemon in the tier, and it also puts nearly every Pokemon into KO range for either Fearow’s Hyper Beam or Drill Peck; the few exceptions such as Pinsir and Machamp are not good switch-ins to Seaking. Double-Edge comes off a respectable base 92 Attack stat, and it gives Seaking perfect neutral coverage along with doing more damage than Surf against physically frail Pokemon, such as Abra and Drowzee. Hyper Beam lets Seaking finish off foes, impressively KOing Drowzee from 49.5% and Staryu from 55.1%. Agility gives Seaking a form of speed control, allowing it to outspeed faster threats such as Nidoqueen and Rapidash, and it lets Seaking clean up a weakened team late-game.</p> <p>Seaking’s best teammate is Fearow, since Seaking is able to punish Fearow’s two biggest checks—Graveler and Omanyte—with a strong Surf. In return, Fearow heavily threatens Staryu, outspeeding it and 2HKOing with Double-Edge or OHKOing with Hyper Beam after the slightest bit of chip damage. Pinsir also appreciates Seaking breaking through the Rock-types, which enables it to wreak havoc with Slash. Seaking is also able to check Rapidash, a Pokemon that Pinsir heavily struggles against. Ironically, Staryu is also a great teammate for Seaking, since it can trade paralysis with opposing Staryu and potentially chip it to make it easier for Seaking to deal with. Dragonair is a notable teammate that can switch into opposing Thunderbolt as well as spread paralysis, easing the burden of Seaking’s low Speed. Lastly, Graveler is a great teammate for Seaking to fall back on if it’s being overwhelmed by Fearow and Pinsir, while Seaking can help Graveler fend off Rapidash.</p> "

However, Scyther is held back by its horrendous coverage, which is limited to Normal-type attacks and Wing Attack, denying it any effective means to get past Rock-types and Gastly. Additionally, its terrible typing and low Special allow the tier's many Fire-types to often OHKO it outright, while its BoltBeam weakness dooms it against common threats like Nidoqueen and Dragonair. Despite its lower Speed, Pinsir is preferred as a Bug-type attacker due to its better coverage, while Fearow better fills the role of a speedy physical attacker. While it looks quite solid at first glance, it advised that you avoid using Scyther.</p> ",

    "overview": "<p>The novelty of Ditto being the only non-Uber that has access to Transform quickly wears thin when it's the only move it can learn. Ditto's awful base stats are a massive hindrance—it's outsped by the majority of the tier and has subpar bulk, so it generally takes heavy damage before being able to do anything. To add insult to injury, even after using Transform Ditto retains its terrible base HP and low critical hit rate and it uses its subpar original stats when calculating critical hits it deals and receives. Transform copying stat boosts is almost completely irrelevant in PU, as the tier has few viable setup sweepers.

  "Omanyte": {
    "overview": "<p>Omanyte's combination of solid bulk and a Rock / Water typing perfectly counters Rapidash and Arcanine, denying them meaningful progress, and also makes it an effective switch-in to Fearow. As Rapidash and Fearow are incredibly common offensive threats, Omanyte will almost always have several opportunities to stop a powerful progress-maker in its tracks and then make its own progress. Few Pokemon enjoy switching into Omanyte's decently powerful Surf and Blizzard or risking Body Slam paralysis. However, Omanyte's offensive presence has flaws, as choosing the wrong move for its switch-in—such as Surf for Seaking or Body Slam for Gastly—leaves it in a bad position. Omanyte's terrible Speed makes it loses the one-on-one to a variety of metagame threats, such as Nidoqueen and Drowzee, which can force a powerful attack or status condition on one of Omanyte's teammate as it's forced out. Omanyte's low HP also leaves it extremely vulnerable to fixed-damage moves, which 3HKO it. Additionally, its switch-ins are very predictable, making it exploitable with double switching. Pokemon checked by Omanyte have ways to mitigate its effectiveness, as Fearow's sheer power and critical hit rate can quickly wear it down, while Rapidash can use Fire Spin to switch out if its team lacks a decent Omanyte switch-in. Effective use of Omanyte requires a team that can handle its shortcomings and careful management of its HP, but when played optimally, it can turn dangerous offensive threats into non-issues.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is much stronger than Surf, notably having around a 47% chance to 2HKO Gastly, a 59% chance to 2HKO Abra, an 83% chance to 2HKO opposing Omanyte, and an 85% chance to OHKO the rare Sandslash, feats Surf can never achieve without a critical hit. Hydro Pump's extra damage against Drowzee leaves it always in range of Machamp's Hyper Beam or two Seismic Tosses, and it gives Rapidash's Hyper Beam and Pinsir's Slash favorable odds to KO Drowzee as well. However, Hydro Pump's poor accuracy makes it quite unreliable, with Surf usually being preferred over its inconsistent counterpart.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: While they all dislike paralysis, none of Omanyte's attacks do significant damage to any of the tier's Water-types, whereas they can easily overwhelm it with their STAB moves in return. Staryu can wall Omanyte indefinitely as a result of its access to Recover, while Seaking can set up Agility to negate the Speed drop from paralysis. The rarer Slowpoke and Poliwag can use Omanyte as setup fodder for Amnesia freely.</p> <p><strong>Gastly: Gastly is uniquely immune to Body Slam while only being 3HKOed by Surf, affording it numerous opportunities to switch in and threaten Omanyte with its higher Speed, Hypnosis, and a 2HKO with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Drowzee</strong>: Drowzee can outspeed and put Omanyte to sleep with Hypnosis and can usually win the one-on-one with Psychic if sleep isn't available.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake Users</strong>: Machamp outspeeds and 2HKOes Omanyte with Earthquake while only being 3HKOed by Surf in return. While they cannot switch in, Ground-types such as Nidoqueen and the rare Sandslash outspeed and 2HKO Omanyte with Earthquake while only being 2HKOed in return, allowing them to easily win the one-on-one or pick off a weakened Omanyte.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: While rare and vulnerable to Blizzard, Weepinbell and Vileplume serve as effective Omanyte checks.
