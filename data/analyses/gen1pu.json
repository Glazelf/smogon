  "Butterfree": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite its access to the powerful \"Double Powder\" combination, Butterfree has no place in PU. Its mediocre offenses and lack of decent STAB attacks mean it does pitiful damage despite its access to the excellent Psychic. It's overwhelmed by most physical attackers and 2HKOed by the plethora of Fire Blast, Blizzard, and Thunderbolt users thanks to its awful Bug / Flying typing. Additionally, while less common, Rock Slide from threats like Graveler easily OHKOes Butterfree. As a fast sleeper, it's completely outclassed by Gastly, which has a much better offensive presence and Speed tier. As a dual status spreader, Butterfree is outclassed by Drowzee, which does more damage and has fantastic defensive utility. Even fringe sleepers like Vileplume and Weepinbell still have more of a use thanks to their niche defensive utility. It is not advised to use Butterfree if your goal is to win.</p> ",

This is particularly important if Butterfree is used as a lead, as these threats are themselves common leads. While most slower threats don't want to face Butterfree before Sleep Powder is used, afterwards Drowzee serves as a strong check that doesn't mind its attacks or paralysis, so wallbreakers like Pinsir and Fearow help out considerably. Butterfree is best used to put a foe to sleep as quickly as possible and then try to spread paralysis before being knocked out. Butterfree can notably switch into slower Earthquake users like Machamp and Graveler and then put them to sleep. However, it must be wary of their other attacks, most of which hit Butterfree super effectively or can paralyze it.</p> "

At first glance, Twineedle seems usable and its boosting moves look promising, but Beedrill's incredibly poor stats prevent it from contributing to a victory. It is outsped by premier attackers including every viable Fire-type, Abra, Nidoqueen, Pinsir, and Fearow, all of which OHKO it or come extremely close. Beedrill can only effectively contribute by setting up with Swords Dance and Agility, which is nearly impossible to pull off since even the weakest foes 3HKO it. One would think Twineedle gives it a niche against Psychic-types, but Beedrill flops even against the incredibly frail Abra, OHKOing it a mere 25.6% of the time. Meanwhile, Abra OHKOes Beedrill 72% of the time, before accounting for critical hits, and is faster. Beedrill outspeeds Drowzee but isn't even guaranteed to 2HKO it, and Drowzee has a small chance to OHKO back. The ubiquity of Fire-types does Beedrill no favors, as it deals pitiful damage to them and they outspeed and OHKO it, leaving it few chances to even find entry, let alone progress.

Pidgeot falls into all the same pitfalls as Fearow, including a losing matchup against Rock-types, a difficult BoltBeam weakness, and a fear of paralysis.

Pidgeot hates being paralyzed, so it's best used either as an endgame cleaner when all opposing paralysis spreaders have been weakened or KOed or as a midgame wallbreaker willing to sacrifice itself to aid another cleaner.</p> "

  "Fearow": {
    "overview": "<p>Fearow’s combination of high Attack, Normal-type STAB, and excellent Speed make it one of the most dangerous physical attackers in the tier. It is a deadly offensive threat throughout the game, blasting opponents with powerful attacks in the early- and mid-game and single-handedly cleaning up a weakened team. It can also be used effectively as a lead, dishing out heavy damage from the first turn. Since the only relevant threat that outspeeds Fearow is Rapidash, anything that switches in will most likely be taking two attacks, making it extremely difficult to switch into safely. Fearow's high critical hit ratio of 19.53% means that an otherwise-safe switch-in can potentially be put in a dangerous situation. However, Fearow is quite frail, and although its Flying typing offers a nice immunity to Ground-type moves, it doesn’t have any other notable resistances and is weak to common moves such as Blizzard and Thunderbolt. Double-Edge's recoil also hinders its longevity. Fearow is very reliant on its Speed since it can’t afford to take many hits, which also makes it afraid of paralysis, though its Normal typing prevents paralysis from Body Slam. Fearow is also afraid of being burned by Fire Blast. Fearow is completely walled by Graveler and to a lesser extent Omanyte. Both Rock-types resist Fearow’s STAB combination and are capable of hitting it back with super effective damage, so it requires some team support to deal with them before it can achieve its destructive potential.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>All four moves in Fearow's standard set are very important, so other options are generally not recommended for Fearow. If you do want to use another option, you should replace Agility since Double-Edge, Drill Peck, and Hyper Beam are much more important. Mirror Move can be used to punish Nidoqueen’s Blizzard by copying the move and hitting it back with super effective damage, but Fearow’s low Special means it actually does less damage than Hyper Beam, and Nidoqueen can use the safer but weaker Thunderbolt or just switch out to render Mirror Move useless. Mirror Move can also be used to let Fearow switch into Nidoqueen and even Graveler’s Earthquakes, then hit them super effectively with Earthquake the next turn. Toxic can be used on a predicted Graveler or Omanyte switch-in to wear it down over the course of a game, making it easier for Fearow to break through. However, the damage from poison is very low, and a wrong prediction could accidentally make an opposing Pokemon immune to paralysis. Lastly, Substitute can be used to ease prediction and punish switches, but Fearow can still be paralyzed while behind a Substitute.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Paralysis: Fearow hates being paralyzed since high Speed is one of its most important assets. Because of this, Fearow has to run from Pokemon it would otherwise easily beat, such as Porygon, Dragonair, Drowzee, Staryu, and the rare Slowpoke. Dragonair and Porygon in particular can 2HKO Fearow with Blizzard. However, since most paralysis spreaders are frail, Fearow can KO them with Hyper Beam if they’ve taken a bit of chip damage, and a critical hit Hyper Beam OHKOes every Thunder Wave user outright.</p> <p><strong>Fire-Types: Although Rapidash cannot switch into Fearow since it is unlikely to survive Double-Edge followed up by Hyper Beam, it is able to outspeed Fearow and has a 36.3% chance to 2HKO with Fire Blast; this becomes guaranteed after factoring in Double-Edge recoil. Fire Blast can also burn Fearow, effectively rendering it useless. Arcanine is slower than Fearow but is bulky enough to always survive a Double-Edge followed up by Hyper Beam and does the same amount of damage as Rapidash.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Graveler and Omanyte can switch into Fearow and take its hits well. Graveler takes a maximum of 17.2% from Double-Edge, while Omanyte takes a maximum of 21.9%. Graveler’s Rock Slide and Omanyte’s Blizzard both do massive damage to Fearow, 2HKOing it.</p> <p><strong>Nidoqueen</strong>: Nidoqueen is able to survive a Double-Edge followed by Hyper Beam and hit Fearow super effectively with Blizzard. Although it loses to Fearow one-on-one if it switches in, Blizzard will do enough damage for a teammate to finish Fearow off.</p> <p><strong>Sandslash:</strong> Although rare, Sandslash is able to survive two of Fearow's Double-Edges followed up by Hyper Beam, and it 2HKOes with Rock Slide after factoring in Double-Edge recoil.</p> ",

Double-Edge is the more powerful of the two, but reckless use will quickly rack up heavy recoil damage. Drill Peck is slightly weaker, but it lacks recoil and hits Pinsir and Machamp super effectively, which is useful since they are two of the most physically bulky Pokemon in the tier. Drill Peck also cleanly 2HKOes Gastly, which would otherwise wall Fearow. Fearow’s Hyper Beam is extremely powerful, dealing a minimum of 73.3% to Drowzee and 81.7% to Staryu, making it an excellent Pokemon to finish off these physically frail foes after minimal chip damage. Hyper Beam also does a lot against bulkier Pokemon, dealing a minimum of 42.8% to Nidoqueen and a minimum of 53.9% to Seaking. Two Double-Edges followed by Hyper Beam is guaranteed to KO every non-resistant Pokemon in the tier aside from the rare Sandslash, and more physically-frail Pokemon are put into Hyper Beam range after just one Double-Edge. A critical hit Double-Edge puts almost every Pokemon into Hyper Beam KO range, and a critical hit Hyper Beam will OHKO most of the tier outright, making switching into a predicted Hyper Beam very risky. Agility allows Fearow to outspeed Rapidash and negates Speed drop from paralysis. Agility is most useful late-game when Fearow is ready to sweep a weakened team.</p> <p>Seaking and Staryu are both excellent teammates for Fearow, since they are able to switch into Rapidash, Arcanine, Graveler, and Omanyte and force them out, although they both fear paralysis from Body Slam. Seaking is a better switch-in than Staryu though, as it is bulkier and doesn't mind Body Slam paralysis as much thanks to Agility. The Water-types can also switch into Nidoqueen’s Blizzard in dire situations, with a healthy Staryu even beating Nidoqueen one-on-one after switching into Blizzard. Porygon is a fantastic teammate thanks to its ability to switch in to Graveler and Omanyte. Pinsir and Rapidash are also excellent teammates that can use Bind and Fire Spin to get opposing Pokemon into Fearow’s Hyper Beam range and give Fearow a free switch, which is extremely helpful considering Fearow's frailty. They also help Fearow wear down shared checks in Graveler and Omanyte. Pinsir’s Submission does a decent amount of damage to the Rock-types, while Rapidash can potentially burn them with Fire Blast. Additionally, Machamp is able to comfortably switch into Graveler's Rock Slide and threaten both Rock-types with a powerful Earthquake or Submission. Ironically, Omanyte is also a good teammate thanks to its ability to switch into a Rapidash or Arcanine that tries to revenge kill Fearow. Although they are hard to fit on a team, Vileplume and Weepinbell threaten both Graveler and Omanyte with 4x super effective damage, making them great checks to Fearow’s main walls. They can also try to paralyze a Rapidash or Arcanine that switches into them with Stun Spore, making them much easier for Fearow to handle later.</p> "

Defensively, Parasect has resistances to Ground, Water, and Electric, meaning it can situationally switch in on Pokemon like Machamp, Seaking, and Staryu. Parasect is also generally unfazed by paralysis, making it a decent early-game status absorber.

This combined with many teams choosing not to use a sleeper at all makes Parasect not worth using. In addition, Parasect's stats are all-around mediocre; its Speed is tied for the lowest among all fully evolved Pokemon. Its terrible typing also makes it very easy to OHKO. This especially applies in RBY PU, a tier filled with powerful Fire-types, such as Rapidash and Arcanine, to prey on its 4x Fire weakness, and other Pokemon like Fearow and Nidoqueen feast on its poor defensive typing as well.

Farfetch'd also has Body Slam and Swords Dance, which other Flying-types lack, but it will rarely have the time to even set up Agility, let alone a second move. Farfetch'd's poor Speed and bulk make it difficult for it to contribute; attackers like Nidoqueen, Pinsir, Fearow, and all Fire-types outspeed and 2HKO it. Therefore, just about any team is better served by Fearow or Pinsir instead.</p> ",

To make matters worse, it is dominated by Gastly, which is only 4HKOed by Fire Blast and is immune to Explosion.

Fire Blast 2HKOes Pinsir while threatening Grass-types such as Vileplume and potentially burning physical attackers. It is also Muk's strongest attack against Gastly. Alternatively, Hyper Beam lets Muk OHKO Abra, meaning it need not use Explosion to KO Abra. Explosion is Muk's most powerful attack, OHKOing common threats like Fearow and Rapidash, and it deals a minimum of 72% to Nidoqueen. It also has an 84.6% chance to OHKO Porygon, which is important, since Porygon otherwise stonewalls Muk.

    "overview": "<p>Gastly holds a niche in PU as the second fastest sleeper in the tier, only behind the niche Poliwag. Gastly remains threatening even after using Hypnosis thanks to its high Special and combination of Psychic + Thunderbolt, which has perfect coverage and hits top threats such as Fearow and Nidoqueen super effectively. These traits make Gastly a fantastic lead, since it can put most opposing leads to sleep and then threaten switch-ins with powerful attacks. Gastly can also switch into Normal-type moves, such as Rapidash's Hyper Beam and most of Pinsir's attacks, without taking damage, something no other Pokemon in the tier can do. However, despite its unique defensive utility, Gastly's defensive profile is quite poor due to its stats and Poison typing. Its terrible physical bulk allows most neutral physical attacks such as Fearow's Drill Peck to 2HKO it, while Gastly's low HP leaves it very vulnerable to fixed-damage moves such as Pinsir's Seismic Toss. Additionally, its terrible Ground- and Psychic-type weaknesses leave it OHKOed and 2HKOed, respectively, by every common Earthquake and Psychic in the tier. These issues are compounded by Gastly's reliance on the inaccurate Hypnosis, as a miss could mean Gastly faints without doing anything.</p> ",

Confuse Ray can be used in conjunction with paralysis support to let Gastly defeat foes it otherwise can't, such as Drowzee.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Both Abra and Drowzee can 2HKO Gastly with Psychic or ruin it with Thunder Wave. The former outspeeds Gastly and is only 3HKOed by Night Shade, while the latter is only 4HKOed. However, both must watch out for Explosion, which OHKOes Abra and does a minimum of 67% to Drowzee. Due to it being outsped, Drowzee must be wary of Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Fearow, Rapidash, Arcanine, and Pinsir all outspeed Gastly. Fearow 2HKOes Gastly and is only 2HKOed back by Thunderbolt, while Rapidash, Arcanine, and Pinsir 3HKO Gastly and are only 4HKOed by Night Shade. Rapidash can also use Fire Spin to chip Gastly into KO range, and both Fire Spin and Pinsir's Bind can be used to pivot around Gastly. However, Rapidash and Pinsir must be wary of Hypnosis, as they often give Gastly numerous opportunities to try to put them to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake Users: Even if Gastly can hit them super effectively, Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Machamp, and Graveler can easily tank a hit and OHKO Gastly in return with Earthquake.

Thunderbolt deals super effective damage to Fearow and Water-types, such as Staryu and Seaking. Night Shade is a good midground option because many of Gastly's switch-ins have low base HP, and it's Gastly's strongest attack against Abra and Drowzee barring Explosion.

Gastly can also be used in the back to pivot into common Normal-type attacks such as Rapidash's Hyper Beam and Pinsir's Slash thanks to its Ghost typing.

Therefore, Hitmonlee needs extensive paralysis support to work, and it's just not worth it when other Pokemon like Machamp get more mileage out of such a strategy. Finally, its paper-thin defenses mean it has little chance of surviving any interactions, especially against foes that resist High Jump Kick, since Hitmonlee cannot win unboosted.

Rest is an option to give Seaking longevity, but the offensive nature of the tier makes it very difficult for Seaking to find an opportunity to wake up, and Staryu’s access to Recover makes it a much better Water-type for this role. Tail Whip and Mimic can be used as anti-Staryu options. Two Tail Whips get Staryu into Hyper Beam OHKO range, and Mimic can potentially copy Thunder Wave, Recover, or a coverage move from Staryu.

Offensive threats like Machamp are appreciated for their ability to force damage on bulky threats like Nidoqueen, allowing Scyther to clean late-game.</p> "}],

  "Ditto": {
    "overview": "<p>The novelty of Ditto being the only non-Uber that has access to Transform quickly wears thin when it's the only move it can learn. Ditto's awful base stats are a massive hindrance—it's outsped by the majority of the tier and has subpar bulk, so it generally takes heavy damage before being able to do anything. To add insult to injury, even after using Transform Ditto retains its terrible base HP and low critical hit rate and it uses its subpar original stats when calculating critical hits it deals and receives. Transform copying stat boosts is almost completely irrelevant in PU, as the tier has few viable setup sweepers. Ditto is a fun gimmick, but if you have the slightest interest in winning, you should never use it.</p> ",

It leaves Ditto with 5 PP in every move, which isn't a huge issue in a tier as offensive as PU, but leaves Ditto easy to PP stall by threats such as Porygon. Ditto appreciates its targets being paralyzed, as then it can transform without taking a hit, which likewise means it should avoid getting paralyzed as much as possible.</p> "}],

  "Flareon": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite possessing the highest BST in PU, Flareon is beyond outclassed. While Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar have much lower attacking stats, their excellent Speed improves their matchups across the board. Flareon's bad base 65 Speed, meanwhile, leaves it outsped by most of the metagame, including key threats like Nidoqueen. Even if it can still win against foes like Abra and Pinsir, having to take an extra hit means it gets worn down quickly and revenge killed by faster threats. Flareon often fails to outdamage faster Fire-types, as their higher Speed lets them launch more attacks against the opposing team. They also have traits that offer more game-to-game utility than Flareon's sheer damage. Rapidash outspeeds Fearow, Arcanine has excellent bulk, and Magmar can threaten Omanyte, something no other Fire-type can do.</p> <p>Thus, you can only justify using Flareon alongside another Fire-type and heavy paralysis support. With proper support Flareon is a usable wallbreaker, as besides Omanyte, no Pokemon can safely switch into all of its attacks. Notably, it's among the few Pokemon that can reliably 2HKO Porygon. However, most of the time another duo of Fire-types will make more progress with less support, and thus Flareon should rarely see play.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic can be used alongside Fire Spin to let Flareon wear down Omanyte, but this means Flareon must give up Hyper Beam. Reflect can be used over Fire Spin to improve Flareon's matchups against many physical attackers, but its low Speed hampers this. Nidoqueen still 2HKOes Flareon unless it can use Reflect before Nidoqueen can land the first Earthquake, while Fearow's high critical hit rate and Pinsir's Slash can bypass Reflect's Defense boost. While weak, Quick Attack can be used to pick off physically frail foes, like Staryu and Abra.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Omanyte's unique typing lets it take minimal damage from all of Flareon's attacks barring the rare Toxic plus Fire Spin combo, making it Flareon's hardest counter. Seaking outspeeds Flareon and 2HKOes it with Surf and is 3HKOed by Body Slam in return, though Seaking must be wary of Body Slam paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Arcanine: Arcanine's higher Speed and physical bulk let it outdamage Flareon one-on-one, especially if it's carrying Reflect.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Nidoqueen outspeeds and 2HKOes Flareon with Earthquake, (AC) while Flareon's Fire Blast only 2HKOes 3% of the time Flareon outspeeds Graveler and 3HKOes it with Fire Blast, but it has a 17.9% chance to OHKO Flareon with Earthquake. The rarer Sandslash speed ties Flareon and has a 33.3% chance to OHKO Flareon with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fearow: Fearow outspeeds and 2HKOes Flareon with Double-Edge+ Hyper Beam while only being 2HKOed by Fire Blast in return. While Fearow fears a burn, it is notably immune to Body Slam paralysis cannot be KOed by the combination of Body Slam and Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: While they usually lose to Flareon one-on-one, faster threats like Staryu and Pinsir can easily revenge kill Flareon due to their higher Speed.</p> ",

Body Slam lets Flareon fish for paralysis and hits most Fire-resistant switch-ins hard, including Arcanine, Staryu, and Dragonair. Hyper Beam is actually weaker than Fire Blast against most neutral foes, but it OHKOes Abra and serves as a powerful finisher against physically-frail Pokemon, like Drowzee, and Fire-resistant foes, barring Omanyte.

Omanyte is the one wall Flareon has no hope of breaking through, so Porygon is an essential partner. Paralysis support is also crucial for letting Flareon overwhelm its foes, so Thunder Wave users like Staryu, Drowzee, and the aforementioned Porygon are important.</p> "

  "Omanyte": {
    "overview": "<p>Omanyte's combination of solid bulk and a Rock / Water typing perfectly counters Rapidash and Arcanine, denying them meaningful progress, and also makes it an effective switch-in to Fearow. As Rapidash and Fearow are incredibly common offensive threats, Omanyte will almost always have several opportunities to stop a powerful progress-maker in its tracks and then make its own progress. Few Pokemon enjoy switching into Omanyte's decently powerful Surf and Blizzard or risking Body Slam paralysis. However, Omanyte's offensive presence has flaws, as choosing the wrong move for its switch-in—such as Surf for Seaking or Body Slam for Gastly—leaves it in a bad position. Omanyte's terrible Speed makes it loses the one-on-one to a variety of metagame threats, such as Nidoqueen and Drowzee, which can force a powerful attack or status condition on one of Omanyte's teammate as it's forced out. Omanyte's low HP also leaves it extremely vulnerable to fixed-damage moves, which 3HKO it. Additionally, its switch-ins are very predictable, making it exploitable with double switching. Pokemon checked by Omanyte have ways to mitigate its effectiveness, as Fearow's sheer power and critical hit rate can quickly wear it down, while Rapidash can use Fire Spin to switch out if its team lacks a decent Omanyte switch-in. Effective use of Omanyte requires a team that can handle its shortcomings and careful management of its HP, but when played optimally, it can turn dangerous offensive threats into non-issues.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is much stronger than Surf, notably having around a 47% chance to 2HKO Gastly, a 59% chance to 2HKO Abra, an 83% chance to 2HKO opposing Omanyte, and an 85% chance to OHKO the rare Sandslash, feats Surf can never achieve without a critical hit. Hydro Pump's extra damage against Drowzee leaves it always in range of Machamp's Hyper Beam or two Seismic Tosses, and it gives Rapidash's Hyper Beam and Pinsir's Slash favorable odds to KO Drowzee as well. However, Hydro Pump's poor accuracy makes it quite unreliable, with Surf usually being preferred over its inconsistent counterpart.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: While they all dislike paralysis, none of Omanyte's attacks do significant damage to any of the tier's Water-types, whereas they can easily overwhelm it with their STAB moves in return. Staryu can wall Omanyte indefinitely as a result of its access to Recover, while Seaking can set up Agility to negate the Speed drop from paralysis. The rarer Slowpoke and Poliwag can use Omanyte as setup fodder for Amnesia freely.</p> <p><strong>Gastly: Gastly is uniquely immune to Body Slam while only being 3HKOed by Surf, affording it numerous opportunities to switch in and threaten Omanyte with its higher Speed, Hypnosis, and a 2HKO with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Drowzee</strong>: Drowzee can outspeed and put Omanyte to sleep with Hypnosis and can usually win the one-on-one with Psychic if sleep isn't available.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake Users</strong>: Machamp outspeeds and 2HKOes Omanyte with Earthquake while only being 3HKOed by Surf in return. While they cannot switch in, Ground-types such as Nidoqueen and the rare Sandslash outspeed and 2HKO Omanyte with Earthquake while only being 2HKOed in return, allowing them to easily win the one-on-one or pick off a weakened Omanyte.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: While rare and vulnerable to Blizzard, Weepinbell and Vileplume serve as effective Omanyte checks. Both outspeed it; the former OHKOes Omanyte with Razor Leaf, while the sheer bulk of the latter allows it to reliably 2HKO Omanyte with Mega Drain. Both threats can also put Omanyte to sleep with Sleep Powder.</p> ",

These threats can also check foes that give Omanyte trouble, such as Machamp handling Nidoqueen and Rapidash handling Pinsir. On the defensive end, Staryu is a great partner for its ability to eternally wall Seaking, which otherwise can use Omanyte as setup fodder. Drowzee, while not as iron-clad, is capable of checking special attackers, such as Gastly, Abra, and Staryu, which give Omanyte trouble.</p> "
