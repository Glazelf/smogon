When Pikachu transforms, only the ability, item, and HP EVs listed here matter. The listed moves, non-HP EVs, and nature will very rarely see use: since Pikachu outspeeds all other Imposter users like Chansey, it is extremely rare that Pikachu is not transformed. Nevertheless, Volt Switch provides a reasonably strong pivoting option against opposing transformed Imposter users, which cause Pikachu's Imposter to fail, while Glare can paralyze threats to aid Pikachu later on. Healing Wish and Spikes both provide some utility if Pikachu is no longer needed. Since Pikachu is extremely frail, it can easily fall to any strong move from opposing threats it wants to transform into. Therefore, significant team support is needed to realize its potential. Paralysis spam through Nuzzle and Glare ensures Pikachu always outspeeds opposing threats like Mega Mewtwo X, and it can also generate free turns. Knock Off invalidates Pikachu, so Knock Off absorbers, such as Arceus with a held Plate are recommended. Bulky special walls like Ice Scales Arceus-Ground and Ho-Oh check Mega Diancie and Arceus-Ghost, which Pikachu cannot safely transform into: the former can OHKO with Extreme Speed, and the latter Imposter-proofs itself.</p> "

Jungle Healing removes crippling status conditions while also acting as a form of recovery to mitigate chip damage. Its lower healing compared to alternatives like Strength Sap is valuable for breaking through Imposter users, although, in a pinch, these can use No Retreat and attempt to stall Judgment. Arceus-Ghost highly appreciates Knock Off users like RegenVest Pokemon to help remove Imposter Chansey's Eviolite, weaken opposing RegenVest Pokemon, and remove Covert Cloaks for Triple Arrows; in return, Arceus-Ghost acts as a decent Knock Off and status absorber. Arceus-Ghost can struggle against Pokemon like Fur Coat Yveltal and Ice Scales Arceus-Fairy, so offensive teammates like Mega Diancie and Teravolt Kartana pair well with it.</p> "
