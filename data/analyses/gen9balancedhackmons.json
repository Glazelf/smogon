        "description": "<p>Thanks to Light Ball, Pikachu is a niche Imposter user that can break past less-sturdy Imposter-proofers, although it forgoes defensive utility in exchange. When Pikachu transforms, only the ability, item, HP EVs, and Tera type listed here matter. Tera Fairy is useful against Dragon-types like Koraidon and Palkia-O, while Tera Dragon lets Pikachu transformed into Palkia-O 2HKO Ice Scales Dialga-O after Spikes. The listed moves, non-HP EVs, and nature will very rarely see use: since Pikachu outspeeds all other Imposter users like Chansey, it is extremely rare that Pikachu is not transformed. Nevertheless, Volt Switch provides a reasonably strong pivoting option against opposing transformed Imposter users, which cause Pikachu's Imposter to fail, while Glare can paralyze threats to aid Pikachu later on. Healing Wish and Spikes both provide some utility if Pikachu is no longer needed. Since Pikachu is extremely frail, it can easily fall to any strong move from opposing threats it wants to transform into. Therefore, significant team support is needed to realize its potential. Paralysis spam through Nuzzle and Glare ensures Pikachu always outspeeds opposing threats like Koraidon, and it can also generate free turns. Knock Off invalidates Pikachu, so Knock Off absorbers, such as Arceus with a held Plate and Guts + Flame Orb users like Slaking, are recommended. Bulky special walls like Ice Scales Arceus-Ground and Dialga-O check Palkia-O and Arceus-Ghost, which Pikachu cannot safely transform into: the former is unsafe to switch in to, and the latter Imposter-proofs itself. Substitute + Baton Pass is a niche option to provide free turns to Pikachu, and this has the benefit of scouting potential Terastallization.</p> "

This provides a myriad of benefits, including blanket checking most Pokemon, scouting sets, and PP stalling less threatening foes. While Eviolite is usually the best item, Covert Cloak is useful against Nuzzle and Spirit Shackle users. The given moves offer the most utility in the rare situations Chansey is not transformed, like phazing Substitute users, pivoting, and acting as a cleric. Offensive threats such as Palkia-O and Flutter Mane appreciate the information Imposter Chansey provides through scouting. Imposter Chansey appreciates slow pivoting from Pokemon like Dondozo and RegenVest Ting-Lu for safe scouting; these Pokemon can also provide Knock Off support, aiding against Judgment users that can otherwise defeat Imposter Chansey. Tera Normal gives Chansey a STAB boost on Judgment, improving its matchup into Pokemon like Arceus-Ground, while Tera Fire and Tera Ghost are useful against V-create users and trapping moves, respectively.</p> "

Parting Shot allows Chansey to safely pivot teammates in thanks to its low Speed. Chanseyâ€™s low Attack limits Strength Sap healing from common special attackers, making it effective at wearing them down in the long run. Chansey's poor Defense means that it enjoys Fur Coat teammates like Groudon, Eternatus, and Arceus to check powerful physical attackers like Slaking, Groudon, and Koraidon. Chansey is also hindered by poison from Mortal Spin and Toxic, so having Hell Bell somewhere on the team is useful. Tera Ghost protects Chansey from being trapped, whereas Tera Poison makes it immune to poison and grants a resistance to Pixilate Extreme Speed from Arceus-Fairy.</p> "

Facade has downright absurd damage output, OHKOing everything that isn't a Fur Coat user or resistant to Normal at +1, and it has high enough PP to outlast Strength Sap on most walls. Tidy Up bolsters Slaking's offensive profile and also clears entry hazards, which when combined with Flame Orb's burn and disposability makes it a near-perfect switch-in to RegenVest users. V-create slams Steel-types like Zamazenta-C and picks off weakened Arceus-Ghost, while Wicked Blow hits Arceus-Ghost and Giratina harder. Strength Sap provides reliable recovery and allows Slaking to switch in and beat most Fur Coat Groudon sets one-on-one. Slaking's best fit is on balance and offense teams, as these can give it multiple opportunities to set up and heavily benefit from a good switch-in to RegenVest users like Ting-Lu. Fur Coat Arceus-Ghost is a common obstacle for Slaking and drastically reduces how fast it makes progress, so teammates that can limit its Strength Sap recovery, like Chansey and Liquid Ooze users, are recommended. Fur Coat Giratina is rare but basically unbeatable with Slaking, so a teammate like Choice Band Koraidon is appreciated to remove it or force it to Terastallize. Ghost-types and Zamazenta-C are the preferred Imposter-proofs for Slaking, as even though Fur Coat users like Groudon and Dondozo are usually sufficient, they can crumple if the Imposter user is statused.</p> "

Knock Off removes items like Covert Cloak and Rocky Helmet to more freely use Body Slam against targets like support Arceus formes and Groudon; alternatively, Victory Dance allows Slaking to outrun and threaten Palkia-O and Koraidon. Covert Cloak blocks Nuzzle paralysis from Pokemon like RegenVest users. Fur Coat Slaking's best fit is on balance teams that want a reliable, non-passive Fur Coat wall without giving up the Arceus slot.

With Magic Guard, Tidy Up + Wide Lens makes Slaking a reliable source of entry hazard removal while also allowing it to outrun Eternatus and Koraidon, whereas Coil + Life Orb offers higher damage. Flame Orb + Guts blocks crippling burns at the cost of forcing Coil and either itself or an ally into using Knock Off. V-create offers a more immediate damaging option against opposing Steel-types, notably OHKOing Zacian-C unboosted; alternatively, Wicked Blow deals heavy damage to Ghost-types like Arceus-Ghost and Giratina, and Toxic allows Slaking to wear them down in the long run while also dissuading Imposter users from switching in. Population Bomb Slaking best fits on bulky offense teams that can wear down Slaking's hardest checks like Arceus-Ghost and Prankster Giratina. A Spooky Plate Imposter user is recommended to turn the tables on Fur Coat Arceus-Ghost, although Hoopa-U can fit the bill on more offensive teams.

Tera Ghost further boosts Astral Barrage, helping Flutter Mane break past walls like Calm Mind Ice Scales Arceus formes, and helps defensively against Dialga-O's Revelation Dance. Tera Steel prevents potential revenge killing from Iron Bundle's Boomburst and Koraidon's Gigaton Hammer, as well as resisting Dialga-O's Revelation Dance. Flutter Mane pairs very well with other special attackers, such as Palkia-O, Eternatus, and setup Arceus formes, that place heavy pressure on opposing special walls like Chansey and Ice Scales Dialga-O. Setup Arceus formes can also inflict Chansey with poison using Toxic or Mortal Spin, greatly increasing Flutter Mane's capability of stalling it out of recovery. Defensive pivots like Ting-Lu can provide entry hazard support, deny momentum from Chansey, and pivot Flutter Mane in safely. Paralysis support from the likes of Ting-Lu can also slow down the troublesome Zacian, which outspeeds and threatens Flutter Mane.
