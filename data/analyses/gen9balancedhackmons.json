When Pikachu transforms, only the ability, item, and HP EVs listed here matter. The listed moves, non-HP EVs, and nature will very rarely see use: since Pikachu outspeeds all other Imposter users like Chansey, it is extremely rare that Pikachu is not transformed. Nevertheless, Volt Switch provides a reasonably strong pivoting option against opposing transformed Imposter users, which cause Pikachu's Imposter to fail, while Glare can paralyze threats to aid Pikachu later on. Healing Wish and Spikes both provide some utility if Pikachu is no longer needed. Since Pikachu is extremely frail, it can easily fall to any strong move from opposing threats it wants to transform into. Therefore, significant team support is needed to realize its potential. Paralysis spam through Nuzzle and Glare ensures Pikachu always outspeeds opposing threats like Mega Mewtwo X, and it can also generate free turns. Knock Off invalidates Pikachu, so Knock Off absorbers, such as Arceus with a held Plate are recommended. Bulky special walls like Ice Scales Arceus-Ground and Ho-Oh check Mega Diancie and Arceus-Ghost, which Pikachu cannot safely transform into: the former can OHKO with Extreme Speed, and the latter Imposter-proofs itself.</p>"

Mega Alakazam appreciates support from Imposter users and Knock Off users to remove Assault Vests from RegenVest Pokemon that could otherwise what move it locks into and Leftovers from Blissey to make it easier to wear down. Entry hazard support from RegenVest users with Stone Axe and Spikes users such as Eternatus can help Mega Alakazam achieve 2HKOes on targets like Ice Scales Arceus formes. RegenVests users like Primal Kyogre can additionally provide slow pivoting to bring Mega Alakazam in safely, as it is frail and susceptible to status conditions; these can also Imposter-proof Mega Alakazam if it isn't using Psystrike. Other Imposter-proofing options include Imposter Chansey and Ice Scales walls neutral to its attacks like Ho-Oh.</p>"

Scald threatens to burn setup threats like Ice Scales Arceus-Ground, which could otherwise set up in Mega Slowbro's face, and it also deals solid damage. Future Sight has incredible synergy with Teleport, as it allows Mega Slowbro to support its offensive teammates by preventing opposing walls from safely switching in. Alternatively, Mortal Spin allows Mega Slowbro to serve as an entry hazard remover and cripple foes unaffected by burn, such as Ho-Oh. Covert Cloak prevents Mega Slowbro from being chipped by foes reliant on Salt Cure and Mortal Spin to make progress, while Rocky Helmet consistently chips wallbreakers in exchange for a worse matchup against passive walls like Mega Audino; Rocky Helmet also notably punishes Choice Band foes, such as Kyurem-B, for trying to easily up chip damage with U-turn. The pivoting and Future Sight support Mega Slowbro provides is heavily appreciated by wallbreakers that often fall just shy of 2HKOs, such as Mega Garchomp and Ash-Greninja; teammates with a bad matchup against various physical attackers are also appreciative of its walling capabilities, including the likes of Ice Scales Ho-Oh and Blissey. The aforementioned Blissey and other special walls like Ice Scales Arceus-Ground and Ho-Oh can also cover for dangerous foes like Miraidon and Flutter Mane, forming a solid defensive core. Since Ash-Greninja is one of the only wallbreakers that can dissuade Mega Slowbro from switching in, a check to it like Miraidon or Fur Coat Arceus-Fairy is appreciated. Mega Slowbro should be Imposter-proofed by a Take Heart user, ideally with Thunder Cage, as even if Mega Slowbro is able to burn or poison the Imposter user, it still acts as a free source of healing and Teleport momentum.</p>"

The given moves offer the most utility in the rare situations Chansey is not transformed, allowing it to Imposter-proof certain special attackers and act as a cleric. While Eviolite is usually the best item, Covert Cloak is useful against Spirit Shackle and Salt Cure users, and Spooky Plate allows Chansey to threaten Arceus-Ghost and Lunala that would otherwise defeat it with Judgment. Offensive threats such as Ultra Necrozma appreciate the information Imposter Chansey provides through scouting; physical attackers in particular highly appreciate moves like Burning Bulwark being discovered. Special attackers enjoy Imposter Chansey taking advantage of RegenVest users and potentially Imposter-proofing them. Imposter Chansey appreciates slow pivoting from Pokemon like Celesteela and Mega Steelix so it can safely scout. Specially defensive Pokemon like Ice Scales Arceus formes and Magic Guard Blissey can serve as checks to opposing Take Heart Arceus formes, which can beat Imposter Chansey one-on-one, while also checking Dragon-type attackers like Eternatus and Miraidon that can hit it hard.</p>"

Doom Desire can enable attackers that struggle to break through Fairy-type walls like Mega Garchomp and Ash-Greninja due to their one-sided wallbreaking nature shoehorning your opponent into specific response patterns; alternatively, Draco Meteor threatens Miraidon and Eternatus. Additionally, Revelation Dance + Draco Meteor hits both Flutter Mane and Dragon-type attackers, (comma) but Dialga-O can't provide Doom Desire support if this combination is run. Replacing either move with Doom Desire forces you to pick what Dialga-O can and can't beat, but it's still able to pivot into a teammate that takes care of foes that it struggles with. Knock Off removes key items such as Assault Vest from RegenVest Mega Steelix, Salt Cure heavily deters Steel-types that would otherwise endlessly wall Dialga-O, Rapid Spin acts as decent entry hazard removal, and Stone Axe can be used as a reliable way to set entry hazards. A Quiet nature is recommended for Revelation Dance to potentially KO Flutter Mane after three turns of burn damage and Draco Meteor to OHKO Miraidon, but a Sassy nature provides greater safety against threats like Mega Alakazam. Teammates that struggle to break through Fairy-types appreciate Dialga-O hitting them with Doom Desire, (comma) as mentioned previously, along with the slow pivoting it provides. Teammates vulnerable to Thunder Cage and Mortal Spin like Mega Slowbro also appreciate Dialga-O checking users of these moves. Dialga-O cannot break through Steel-types without Salt Cure, so a Pokemon that can pivot in and break them like Magic Guard Ho-Oh makes for a good partner.

V-create threatens to OHKO Steel-types like Mega Steelix, which can otherwise scout Kyurem-B's move choice and heal off about half of the damage with Regenerator. U-turn offers dangerous teammates like Mega Mewtwo X a safe window to switch in if Kyurem-B can't secure a KO, and it can be used early-game to scout for potential Fur Coat switch-ins. Kyurem-B fits best on balance teams that can grant it opportunities through pivoting and can make room for counterplay against the few things it can't instantly get past, such as Arceus-Poison. Kyurem-B's lack of recovery and weakness to Rock mean Stone Axe is a major pain, so multiple entry hazard removers like Miraidon, Mega Steelix, and Primal Kyogre are recommended; the latter two also function as slow pivots, which Kyurem-B also appreciates. Fur Coat Arceus formes not weak to Kyurem-B's attacks, such as Arceus-Poison and Arceus-Fairy, also aren't afraid of it when healthy; as a result, it appreciates an ally that can block their Strength Sap, such as a Magic Bounce user like Mega Audino, significantly cutting into their longevity. A faster offensive teammate like Mega Mewtwo X or Deoxys-A is recommended to clean weakened teams, as Kyurem-B's poor Speed inhibits it in this regard. Imposter-proof Kyurem-B with a Fur Coat user not weak to its attacks, like Arceus-Poison or Arceus-Fairy.</p>"

Volt Switch grants Flutter Mane the option to pivot out on switch-ins like Primal Kyogre, Ice Scales Mega Audino, and Ho-Oh, while Knock Off allows it to cripple special walls by removing items like RegenVest users' Assault Vests, Ho-Oh's Heavy-Duty Boots, and Blissey's Leftovers. Beads of Ruin is an option over Adaptability to increase Volt Switch's chipping capabilities, but running it means Astral Barrage will no longer 2HKO Imposter users. Flutter Mane appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of RegenVest Mega Steelix, Primal Kyogre, and Mega Swampert, as this allows it to have an easier time threatening 2HKOs on the aforementioned Ice Scales walls like Arceus formes and Primal Kyogre. Flutter Mane necessitates a teammate that can threaten specially defensive Normal-types like Blissey, Ice Scales Mega Audino, and Ice Scales Arceus; this makes mixed attackers like Ultra Necrozma valuable. Imposter-proof Flutter Mane with a specially defensive Normal-type like Imposter Chansey.</p>"

        "description": "<p>RegenVest Ting-Lu is a reliable special wall and a premier momentum generator. Regenerator gives Ting-Lu reliable recovery without conflicting with Assault Vest. Nuzzle discourages dangerous attackers like Palkia-O from switching in. U-turn allows Ting-Lu to safely bring in teammates thanks to its low Speed. Stone Axe forces chip damage on foes, letting offensive teammates wallbreak more easily. Knock Off removes items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Covert Cloak, making Ting-Lu's own utility more effective; it also punishes Imposter users attempting to gain Regenerator. Ting-Lu fits best on balance teams, which appreciate its ability to spread paralysis and safely bring in teammates thanks to its huge bulk. Dangerous wallbreakers like Koraidon and Palkia-O help maximize the effectiveness of U-turn pivoting. Ting-Lu is unable to naturally check Palkia-O and Fairy-types like Flutter Mane, so a teammate that helps shore up this weakness, such as Arceus-Grass or Hisuian Goodra, is appreciated. Tera Fairy provides an immunity to Dragon, allowing Ting-Lu to block Dragon Energy from Palkia-O and Glaive Rush from Koraidon; alternatively, Tera Grass provides a Water resistance, covering for Palkia-O's Water Spout.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Fur Coat Miraidon is a resilient wall with strong offensive pressure that can also check Pokemon like Mega Lucario and Ash-Greninja. Torch Song provides coverage against Mega Steelix and boosts Miraidon's Special Attack, potentially facilitating a late-game sweep. Spikes can support Miraidon's offensive teammates and force progress against hard walls like Mega Swampert. Thunder Cage + Torch Song lets Miraidon damage most Steel-types well, making it an effective user of Mortal Spin. Will-O-Wisp threatens to burn offensive threats and some switch-ins like Mega Swampert. Take Heart is another way to boost Special Attack, and also means Miraidon can’t be put on a permanent timer once it loses Covert Cloak. Miraidon struggles against Mega Garchomp and mixed attackers like Ultra Necrozma, so Pokemon like Celesteela and Arceus-Ground can pair well with it. Miraidon can be Imposter-proofed by itself in most cases due to Thunder Cage; however, Pokemon like Blissey and the aforementioned Arceus-Ground can Imposter-proof it in emergency situations.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With Magic Guard, Miraidon is a powerful wallbreaker that can exploit passive foes relying on Mortal Spin and Salt Cure to deal damage; its typing and Speed also allow it to soft check slower foes like Mega Lucario and Ash-Greninja. Torch Song hits Steel-types like Registeel and Mega Steelix while boosting Miraidon's Special Attack. Thunder Cage traps foes, deals good chip damage to special walls, and is an overall decent high-PP STAB move; alternatively, Volt Switch makes Miraidon a very effective pivot. Dragon Energy, when boosted by Life Orb, becomes a very powerful attack against foes taking chip from Thunder Cage. Strength Sap is a burst healing option that's easy to Imposter-proof and keeps Dragon Energy's Base Power high. Miraidon's ability to heavily chip down special walls makes other special attackers like Choice Specs Flutter Mane good partners; other teammates relying on passive damage such as Salt Cure users also appreciate Miraidon as an offensive Imposter-proofer. Miraidon will never beat Arceus-Ground and struggles against Magic Guard Blissey and specially defensive Mega Swampert, so allies like Ultra Necrozma and Simple Arceus-Ghost are useful. Imposter-proof Miraidon with Ice Scales Arceus-Ground or Magic Guard Blissey; Imposter Chansey can also work, but it's less reliable due to taking chip damage from Thunder Cage.</p>"
