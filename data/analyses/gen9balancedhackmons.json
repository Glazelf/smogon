        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Miraidon is a fierce wallbreaker that can reliably threaten nearly the entire tier with it's lethal offensive typing. Volt Switch helps maintain momentum and can scout opposing Terastallization. Trick ruins Ice Scales users like Goodra-H and Arceus-Grass lacking a held Plate, and Steam Eruption threatens burns and targets Ground-types like Ting-Lu and Clodsire; Grass Knot hits many of the same targets but makes Miraidon easier to Imposter-proof. Miraidon's massive damage potential and ability to break down defensive cores makes it an excellent fit on offense. Palkia-O and Final Gambit Eternatus make good partners, as they can help remove Ground-types and weaken special walls with Dragon Energy. Terastallizing into one of its original types is useful to supercharge Miraidon's damage output; however, Tera Steel can be useful to get a surprise KO on Zacian-C, and Tera Fairy is useful for blanking an Imposter user's Dragon Energy. Imposter-proofing is generally done with a specially defensive Ground-type teammate like Ting-Lu or Groudon.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Miraidon's typing and good stats make it a potent setup sweeper. Nasty Plot provides higher immediate power, whereas Quiver Dance makes setting up easier, enables the use of a Modest nature, and allows Miraidon to outspeed and threaten Zacian-C. Draco Plate + Judgment is used so Miraidon can fully self Imposter-proof, in addition to being usable at low HP, unlike Dragon Energy. Miraidon's best fit is on bulky teams that appreciate its instant damage output, potential to sweep, on top of its innate self-Imposter-proofing and good matchup into common Prankster users. Teammates that can help destroy Ice Scales users, such as Final Gambit Eternatus and Poison Heal Arceus-Fairy are appreciated, the latter of which can also absorb Knock Off. Miraidon should be careful when Terastallizing, as this removes its 4x Electric-type resistance and makes it more vulnerable to being PP stalled by Imposter; however, Tera Electric or Tera Dragon are useful for damage output, and Nasty Plot sets enjoy having Tera Steel for Zacian-C.</p> "
