        "description": "<p>Thanks to Light Ball, Pikachu is a niche Imposter user that can break past less-sturdy Imposter-proofers, although it forgoes defensive utility in exchange. When Pikachu transforms, only the ability, item, HP EVs, and Tera type listed here matter. Tera Fairy is useful against Dragon-types like Koraidon and Palkia-O, while Tera Dragon lets Pikachu transformed into Palkia-O 2HKO Ice Scales Dialga-O after Spikes. The listed moves, non-HP EVs, and nature will very rarely see use: since Pikachu outspeeds all other Imposter users like Chansey, it is extremely rare that Pikachu is not transformed. Nevertheless, Volt Switch provides a reasonably strong pivoting option against opposing transformed Imposter users, which cause Pikachu's Imposter to fail, while Glare can paralyze threats to aid Pikachu later on. Healing Wish and Spikes both provide some utility if Pikachu is no longer needed. Since Pikachu is extremely frail, it can easily fall to any strong move from opposing threats it wants to transform into. Therefore, significant team support is needed to realize its potential. Paralysis spam through Nuzzle and Glare ensures Pikachu always outspeeds opposing threats like Koraidon, and it can also generate free turns. Knock Off invalidates Pikachu, so Knock Off absorbers, such as Arceus with a held Plate and Flame Orb users like Flare Boost Flutter Mane, are recommended. Bulky special walls like Ice Scales Arceus-Ground and Dialga-O check Palkia-O and Arceus-Ghost, which Pikachu cannot safely transform into: the former is unsafe to switch in to, and the latter Imposter-proofs itself. Substitute + Baton Pass is a niche option to provide free turns to Pikachu, and this has the benefit of scouting potential Terastallization.</p> "

Offensive threats such as Palkia-O and Flutter Mane appreciate the information Imposter Chansey provides through scouting. Imposter Chansey appreciates slow pivoting from Pokemon like Dondozo and RegenVest Ting-Lu for safe scouting; these Pokemon can also provide Knock Off support, aiding against Judgment users that can otherwise defeat Imposter Chansey.

Chansey is also hindered by poison from Mortal Spin and Toxic, so having Hell Bell somewhere on the team is useful.
