        "description": "<p>Thanks to Light Ball, Pikachu is a niche Imposter user that can break past less-sturdy Imposter-proofers, although it forgoes defensive utility in exchange. When Pikachu transforms, only the ability, item, HP EVs, and Tera type listed here matter. Tera Fairy is useful against Dragon-types like Koraidon and Palkia-O, while Tera Dragon lets Pikachu transformed into Palkia-O 2HKO Ice Scales Dialga-O after Spikes. The listed moves, non-HP EVs, and nature will very rarely see use: since Pikachu outspeeds all other Imposter users like Chansey, it is extremely rare that Pikachu is not transformed. Nevertheless, Volt Switch provides a reasonably strong pivoting option against opposing transformed Imposter users, which cause Pikachu's Imposter to fail, while Glare can paralyze threats to aid Pikachu later on. Healing Wish and Spikes both provide some utility if Pikachu is no longer needed. Since Pikachu is extremely frail, it can easily fall to any strong move from opposing threats it wants to transform into. Therefore, significant team support is needed to realize its potential. Paralysis spam through Nuzzle and Glare ensures Pikachu always outspeeds opposing threats like Koraidon, and it can also generate free turns. Knock Off invalidates Pikachu, so Knock Off absorbers, such as Arceus with a held Plate and Guts + Flame Orb users like Slaking, are recommended. Bulky special walls like Ice Scales Arceus-Ground and Dialga-O check Palkia-O and Arceus-Ghost, which Pikachu cannot safely transform into: the former is unsafe to switch in to, and the latter Imposter-proofs itself. Substitute + Baton Pass is a niche option to provide free turns to Pikachu, and this has the benefit of scouting potential Terastallization.</p> "

This provides a myriad of benefits, including blanket checking most Pokemon, scouting sets, and PP stalling less threatening foes. While Eviolite is usually the best item, Covert Cloak is useful against Nuzzle and Spirit Shackle users. The given moves offer the most utility in the rare situations Chansey is not transformed, like phazing Substitute users, pivoting, and acting as a cleric. Offensive threats such as Palkia-O and Flutter Mane appreciate the information Imposter Chansey provides through scouting. Imposter Chansey appreciates slow pivoting from Pokemon like Dondozo and RegenVest Ting-Lu for safe scouting; these Pokemon can also provide Knock Off support, aiding against Judgment users that can otherwise defeat Imposter Chansey. Tera Normal gives Chansey a STAB boost on Judgment, improving its matchup into Pokemon like Arceus-Ground, while Tera Fire and Tera Ghost are useful against V-create users and trapping moves, respectively.</p> "

Ruination bypasses Chansey's meager offenses to deal damage. Toxic cripples bulky Pokemon like Arceus formes and setup sweepers like Palkia-O. Parting Shot allows Chansey to safely pivot teammates in thanks to its low Speed. Chanseyâ€™s low Attack limits Strength Sap healing from common special attackers, making it effective at wearing them down in the long run. Chansey's poor Defense means that it enjoys Fur Coat teammates like Groudon, Eternatus, and Arceus to check powerful physical attackers like Slaking, Groudon, and Koraidon. Chansey is also hindered by poison from Mortal Spin and Toxic, so having Hell Bell somewhere on the team is useful. Tera Ghost protects Chansey from being trapped, whereas Tera Poison makes it immune to poison and grants a resistance to Pixilate Extreme Speed from Arceus-Fairy.</p> "

Knock Off removes items like Covert Cloak and Rocky Helmet to more freely use Body Slam against targets like support Arceus formes and Groudon; alternatively, Victory Dance allows Slaking to outrun and threaten Palkia-O and Koraidon. Covert Cloak blocks Nuzzle paralysis from Pokemon like RegenVest users. Fur Coat Slaking's best fit is on balance teams that want a reliable, non-passive Fur Coat wall without giving up the Arceus slot. Teammates like Choice Band Groudon enjoy Slaking's presence, as Knock Off ensures opposing walls' bulk is stretched even thinner.

With Magic Guard, Tidy Up + Wide Lens makes Slaking a reliable source of entry hazard removal while also allowing it to outrun Eternatus and Koraidon, whereas Coil + Life Orb offers higher damage. Flame Orb + Guts blocks crippling burns at the cost of forcing Coil and either itself or an ally into using Knock Off. V-create offers a more immediate damaging option against opposing Steel-types, notably OHKOing Zacian-C unboosted; alternatively, Wicked Blow deals heavy damage to Ghost-types like Arceus-Ghost and Giratina, and Toxic allows Slaking to wear them down in the long run while also dissuading Imposter users from switching in. Population Bomb Slaking best fits on bulky offense teams that can wear down Slaking's hardest checks like Arceus-Ghost and Prankster Giratina. A Spooky Plate Imposter user is recommended to turn the tables on Fur Coat Arceus-Ghost, although Hoopa-U can fit the bill on more offensive teams. Imposter-proof Slaking with a Giratina or Fur Coat Arceus-Ghost.</p> "

Glaive Rush is immensely spammable and lacks consistent switch-ins outside of Fur Coat Dondozo and Zacian, and it's bolstered even further by Tera Dragon, which allows Koraidon to 2HKO Fur Coat Groudon and Arceus after Spikes. Mold Breaker is an alternative to Sword of Ruin that secures said 2HKOes without the need for Spikes, albeit at the cost of less damage against non-Fur Coat Pokemon. Close Combat nukes Slaking, Ting-Lu, and Corviknight. Gigaton Hammer threatens Zacian, Arceus-Fairy, and Enamorus, which are otherwise hard counters, and it also helps against Tera Fairy users like Groudon. Flip turn allows Koraidon to maintain momentum, helps scout Terastallization, and dents Groudon, whereas Toxic can benefit its team by forcing extra chip damage onto Fur Coat users. Koraidon's best fit is on balance and offense teams, as these give it multiple opportunities to wallbreak, and they easily take advantage of the passive walls it can't beat one-on-one, like Fur Coat Dondozo. Koraidon's mediocre defensive typing and vulnerability to status mean that slow-pivoting teammates, like Ting-Lu and Dialga-O, are recommended to bring it in safely; helpfully, Koraidon forces out Imposter users transformed into these pivots. Teammates that can limit opposing Strength Sap, like Chansey and Liquid Ooze users, help ensure that foes hit by Gigaton Hammer can't safely heal as Koraidon switches. To Imposter-proof Flip Turn sets, use bulky Fur Coat users that aren't weak to Koraidon's attacks, like Groudon or Arceus-Water, and Imposter-proof Toxic variants with Fur Coat Arceus-Poison or Prankster Corviknight.</p> <p>Written by: https://www.smogon.com/forums/members/tea-guzzler.577920/ Quality checked by: https://www.smogon.com/forums/members/chessking345.355040/ https://www.smogon.com/forums/members/tttech.338877/ Grammar checked by: https://www.smogon.com/forums/members/adeleine.517429/</p> "
