  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>When taking a close look at what it has in its arsenal, Gengar has quite a number of reasons to bear that menacing grin on its face. A unique Ghost / Poison typing on top of the ability Levitate gives Gengar some handy immunities to Normal-, Fighting-, and Ground-type moves as well as some useful resistances to Fairy-, Grass-, Bug-, and Poison-type moves, allowing it to check Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Breloom, and Azumarill. However, despite these useful resistances, Gengar is somewhat held back by its poor bulk, which can make switching in even on some resisted hits challenging. Gengar makes up for this, though, boasting a notable offensive presence between its incredible base 110 Speed, high Special Attack, and superb movepool that allows Gengar to dispatch a wide range of checks. All of this comes on top of having access to a Mega Evolution that grants Gengar the ability Shadow Tag, a major improvement to its Special Attack and Speed stats, and a slight increase to its bulk that makes Gengar truly a force to be reckoned with in the Battle Spot Singles metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Gengar can run a set centered around using Substitute and Pain Split, but it gives up the SubDisable set's capability to annoy the foe in exchange for the ability to survive a bit longer, and its usefulness is hindered by Gengar's poor bulk. A set utilizing Choice Scarf or Choice Specs can be used to surprise opponents while taking advantage of Gengar's access to Trick. Gengar has access to Thunderbolt and Energy Ball if your team requires the additional coverage, as Thunderbolt is capable of dealing more damage to Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Gyarados, and Skarmory, while Energy Ball does more to Rotom-W, Quagsire, and Hippowdon than any of Gengar's other moves. Bear in mind that these moves can be tough to fit onto offensive sets, as Gengar's primary options hit just about everything neutrally. Though its accuracy is shaky, Hypnosis can be useful to take a Pokemon out of play for a few turns; in conjunction with Substitute, this move can make Gengar a major headache to deal with. Due to being a Poison-type, Gengar has access to a perfectly accurate Toxic, which can be even further capitalized on by Gengar's access to Hex and Venoshock, which both inflict double damage on a poisoned Pokemon. However, Gengar's poor bulk means it may not survive too long after using Toxic, and Gengar will have more trouble dealing decent damage to Poison- and Steel-types. Hex also works with Will-O-Wisp and can be used on bulkier sets over Shadow Ball. Lastly, Protect can be used to allow Gengar to Mega Evolve safely, jumping Speed tiers and subsequently outspeeding a ton of Pokemon, while also being beneficial for scouting a foe's moves and allowing Gengar to play around Sucker Punch.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Though they have to be wary of Focus Blast, Dark-types, namely Bisharp, Greninja, Tyranitar, and Weavile, all pose a major threat to Gengar due to their ability to KO Gengar with their STAB moves. Bisharp has access to Sucker Punch to make quick work of Gengar, though it can be forced into mind games if Gengar carries Will-O-Wisp or Substitute. Greninja and Weavile both outspeed Gengar before Mega Evolution and can readily KO it, while Tyranitar has access to Pursuit to trap Gengar. All of them, however, are outsped by Gengar after Mega Evolution. Bulky variants of Tyranitar also have a high chance of surviving Focus Blast from all non-Life Orb Gengar sets, so take this into consideration when facing it.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Ghost-types such as opposing Gengar variants, Aegislash, Choice Scarf Chandelure, and Sableye can KO Gengar with Shadow Ball. While the former three are also weak to Shadow Ball themselves, Sableye is neutral to the move, is unaffected by Taunt due to Magic Bounce, and can use Prankster Calm Mind in its base forme to get a free boost while surviving the hit and then Mega Evolve to use Recover safely, even against Life Orb Gengar. Aegislash is bulky enough to survive any hit from Gengar when in Shield forme and immediately strike back; it also has access to Shadow Sneak to quickly finish off weakened Gengar. Ghost-types are also unable to be trapped even by Shadow Tag, meaning Mega Gengar cannot reliably trap and KO them on its own, effectively neutering its capability against them.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: While Gengar can beat most Psychic-types with Shadow Ball, it still has to be wary of switching into them due to its weakness to Psychic-type moves. Gallade, Gardevoir, Metagross, and Slowbro are particularly threatening.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Though Gengar is immune to Ground-type moves in its base forme with Levitate, it has to be wary of Mega Evolving in front of Pokemon such as Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Landorus-T, as it will immediately become vulnerable to Earthquake. Excadrill is even deadlier, as its Mold Breaker ability lets it beat Gengar regardless of Levitate.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats: Though Mega Gengar boasts a remarkable base 130 Speed, which surpasses the entire unboosted metagame barring Mega Lopunny, Mega Manectric, and the rare Mega Alakazam and Mega Aerodactyl, Gengar has to be wary of faster Pokemon when in its base forme, which has only base 110 Speed. At best, it can only Speed tie with Espeon, Latias, Latios, Mega Gallade, and Mega Metagross, whereas threats such as Mega Salamence, Raikou, Starmie, and Thundurus can easily outspeed Gengar, exploiting its poor bulk with their attacks. In a similar vein, Choice Scarf users such as Excadrill and Garchomp can take even Mega Gengar by surprise.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: One of Gengar's most important traits is its Speed stat. Being crippled by paralysis from Pokemon such as Porygon2, Klefki, and Thundurus renders Gengar nearly useless by making it a slow, frail target. The latter two are especially problematic because they have the Prankster ability, which allows them to use Thunder Wave before Gengar can do anything against them.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon: If Gengar lacks Taunt, defensive Pokemon with high Special Defense, such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, Porygon2, and even Cresselia, can give Gengar issues, being able to easily take hits from it and recover their health. Tanks such as Heatran, Tyranitar, Assault Vest Azumarill, and Assault Vest Conkeldurr can sponge hits from Gengar with relative ease and strike back.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Though Gengar is immune to Mach Punch and Extreme Speed, it still has to be wary of users of priority moves, namely Mega Mawile, Bisharp, Aegislash, Talonflame, Azumarill, Scizor, and Mega Gallade, as their moves can deal serious damage to, if not outright KO, Gengar. Mega Mawile and Bisharp can punish Gengar with Sucker Punch, while Aegislash and Mega Gallade have access to Shadow Sneak to quickly pick it off.</p>",

        "name": "Bulky Trapper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Destiny Bond allows Gengar to fulfill its role as a trapper by taking the opposing Pokemon down with it upon being KOed, leaving a hole in the opponent's team by removing a threat for Gengar's teammates. Will-O-Wisp allows Gengar to neuter physical attackers such as Azumarill, Bisharp, Garchomp, and Kangaskhan, which can also benefit Gengar's teammates. Taunt lets Gengar hinder supportive Pokemon such as Chansey and Skarmory, preventing them from using status moves; it also forces Pokemon to attack Gengar, making it easier to take down an attacker with Destiny Bond. Shadow Ball is the more reliable of Gengar's Ghost-type STAB moves, though Hex can be used, as it becomes a hard-hitting 130 Base Power STAB move against targets afflicted by status, which compensates for this set's lack of Special Attack investment. Thus, Hex should be used strictly in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp, but bear in mind it can be somewhat situational because a target isn't always guaranteed to be burned when needed. Sludge Bomb is Gengar's best Poison-type STAB move and attains decent neutral coverage with Gengar's Ghost-type STAB move, though Focus Blast offers the absolute best coverage, allowing Gengar to hit as many Pokemon as possible for super effective damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With maximum HP investment, Gengar is as bulky as possible, making it able to sponge a variety of hits, especially when running Will-O-Wisp, as physical attackers will generally fail to KO Gengar after being burned. Specifically, with maximum HP, Gengar avoids the 2HKO from Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and Zapdos's Thunderbolt, avoids the OHKO from Garchomp's Outrage, and can survive any move followed by an Aqua Jet from Azumarill after it has been burned. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is used to make the most out of Gengar's base 130 Speed after Mega Evolution, outpacing even +1 base 80 Speed Pokemon with a neutral nature, such as Altaria, Dragonite, and Gyarados after a Dragon Dance.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Evolving immediately is usually the best way to go, as Gengar gains notable increases to its Special Attack and Speed stats, outpacing Pokemon that it couldn't otherwise the following turn, such as Greninja, Raikou, Mega Lucario, and Mega Salamence. Gaining Shadow Tag allows Gengar to trap and eliminate Pokemon such as Skarmory, Chansey, and Cresselia for its teammates, as well as ensuring that Gengar can revenge kill most weakened Pokemon. Refrain from Mega Evolving only in cases where Levitate will be more useful, such as when facing Pokemon with Ground-type moves, such as Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. Mega Kangaskhan is also a noteworthy mention here, as it often has trouble hitting non-Mega Gengar due to Levitate and Gengar's immunity to Normal-type moves, allowing Gengar to serve as an emergency check to it. Even though this set lacks Special Attack investment and relies more on teammates to secure KOs on Pokemon, Gengar still boasts a base 170 Special Attack after Mega Evolving, which allows it to deal good damage. Make use of this and its offensive moves to hit Pokemon, using Destiny Bond to take an attacker down once Gengar has run out of steam. It might even be feasible to sacrifice Gengar by using Destiny Bond while it is still healthy if taking down the opposing Pokemon will allow Gengar's teammates to succeed. Use Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers, and use Taunt to hinder defensive Pokemon and force Pokemon to attack Gengar, making it impossible for them to play around Destiny Bond. Also bear in mind that Ghost-types and Pokemon with access to U-turn, Volt Switch, or Baton Pass can escape from Gengar, making them more difficult to trap, even with Shadow Tag.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Gengar set functions as a supporter for offensive teams, as it excels at trapping and removing most defensive Pokemon for its teammates. Pair it with offensive Pokemon, such as Blaziken, Breloom, Greninja, Garchomp, Azumarill, Conkeldurr, Talonflame, and Bisharp, as they all can deal serious damage to the opposing team, which compensates for Gengar's own lack of offensive presence. Blaziken is especially noteworthy, as checks to it such as Cresselia, Slowbro, Altaria, and Azumarill can be easily handled by Gengar, while Blaziken can take on Dark-types such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Greninja in return. Wobbuffet is also an excellent partner for Mega Gengar, as together they can regulate absolute control over a single Pokemon thanks their shared Shadow Tag ability. Wobbuffet can either use Encore to lock a foe into a useless move for Gengar or a teammate to switch into or take down a foe with Counter or Mirror Coat. U-turn and Volt Switch users, such as Landorus-T, Scizor, Talonflame, Rotom-W, Manectric, and Magnezone, can be a problem for Gengar, as they are able to escape from Shadow Tag. Pokemon such as Breloom, Excadrill, Latias, Latios, and Conkeldurr can be used to offensively check Volt Switch users, while Pokemon such as Zapdos, Air Balloon Heatran, and Rotom-W are able to check most of these U-turn users; Rotom-W also checks Aegislash, Azumarill, and Bisharp for Gengar. Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Klefki, Azumarill, and Togekiss can switch into Dark-type moves aimed at Gengar, while Gengar covers their Poison-type weakness nicely. Porygon2, Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Weavile can switch into Ghost-type moves for Gengar, while Gengar is immune to their Fighting-type weakness.</p>"

        "name": "Offensive Trapper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Destiny Bond ensures that, after Mega Evolution, Gengar is able to remove a trapped Pokemon if it manages to knock Gengar out, possibly taking out a key threat on the opponent's team. Substitute allows Gengar to dodge status moves and play around Pokemon that rely on Sucker Punch to hit it, such as Bisharp, Kangaskhan, and Mawile, while making it much harder to deal with if it manages to KO something with a Substitute up. Shadow Ball is a reliable Ghost-type STAB move, attaining solid neutral coverage alongside STAB Sludge Bomb, which hits Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Mega Altaria much harder than Shadow Ball. While Sludge Wave is a usable attacking option for its higher Base Power than Sludge Bomb, on top of being Gengar's strongest move to hit the rare Chesnaught with, it unfortunately is incredibly hard to find a usable Gengar with Sludge Wave, as it is an event-exclusive move. Though its accuracy can be off-putting, Focus Blast has supreme coverage with Shadow Ball, hitting the Dark- and Normal-types that don't mind Shadow Ball while also hammering Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Heatran harder than any of Gengar's other moves. Taunt allows Gengar to hinder defensive Pokemon that rely on support moves, such as Chansey, Clefable, and Cresselia, after trapping them, and it forces Pokemon to attack Gengar, easing prediction with Destiny Bond. Lastly, Icy Wind is also an option for Gengar to dispatch threats such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Salamence, and it has the utility of reducing an opposing Pokemon's Speed.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With maximum Special Attack and Speed investment and a Timid nature, Gengar is able to be as fast as possible while boasting an offensive presence, hitting as hard as possible. Gengarite is necessary to allow Gengar to Mega Evolve, gaining the ability Shadow Tag to trap Pokemon, notable boosts to its Special Attack and Speed stats, and a slight increase in bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Gengar's boosted Special Attack and Speed stats aren't just for show; take advantage of them, using its excellent coverage to deal damage to their respective targets, using Destiny Bond once Gengar is dangerously low on HP or unable to KO the opposing Pokemon before going down itself in hopes of taking an attacker down with it. Shadow Tag keeps all non-Ghost type Pokemon from switching, making Gengar an excellent revenge killer once a teammate has fallen, so be sure to Mega Evolve relatively early in the match once Gengar comes out, even leading with Gengar to do so if it is plausible. Mega Gengar's offensive presence and high Speed are also effective late-game, allowing it to secure a necessary KO on a weakened Pokemon for its teammates. If running Substitute, take advantage of Gengar's ability to block predicted status moves or attempts at using Sucker Punch; also opt for Focus Blast over Taunt to give Gengar absolute coverage while letting it deal serious damage back to Sucker Punch users. If using Taunt, use it to harass supportive Pokemon that rely on status moves, such as Chansey and Skarmory; also take advantage of Taunt's utility in forcing these Pokemon to attack Gengar, making Destiny Bond much easier to predict with even against offensive Pokemon that might not be running four attacking moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Gengar set can fit very easily onto nearly any offensive team due to its own attacking power and ability to trap and revenge kill Pokemon for its teammates, so Pokemon such as Azumarill, Breloom, Garchomp, Greninja, and Talonflame all appreciate their respective checks being weakened or eliminated. Porygon2 synergizes nicely with Gengar, being immune to its Ghost weakness while Gengar is immune to Porygon2's Fighting weakness; Porygon2 is also able to check offensive threats to Gengar, such as Aegislash, Garchomp, and Talonflame, while Gengar can shut down defensive Pokemon that Porygon2 struggles against, such as Chansey, Cresselia, and Ferrothorn. Wobbuffet, despite the shared Dark- and Ghost-type weaknesses, partners well with Gengar, as it also has Shadow Tag, allowing them to switch interchangeably while keeping an opposing Pokemon trapped. Wobbuffet's bulk allows it to sponge some hits for Gengar and retaliate with Counter or Mirror Coat, or it can even use Encore to hinder a Pokemon for Gengar. Rotom-W and Talonflame are also excellent partners to Gengar, as both are immune to the Ground moves Gengar is vulnerable to after Mega Evolution and have access to Volt Switch and U-turn, respectively, to get momentum on a forced switch to bring Gengar in. Rotom-W is able to threaten Aegislash, Bisharp, Mawile, Scizor, and Talonflame for Gengar, while Talonflame itself has priority Brave Bird to threaten offensive checks to Gengar, such as Blaziken and Conkeldurr. Other users of Volt Switch and U-turn, such as Rotom-H, Landorus-T, and Scizor, can allow Gengar a safe switch in while dealing some damage, making it easier for Gengar to deal with the foe. Lastly, Fairy-types such as Azumarill, Klefki, and Sylveon can switch into Dark-type moves and check the Dark-types that threaten Gengar.</p>"

        "name": "Perish Trapper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Perish Song causes Gengar and the opposing Pokemon to faint within three turns of using the move, essentially guaranteeing the foe faints thanks to Shadow Tag keeping it from switching. Protect shields Gengar from any damage, allowing it to stall for a turn after using Perish Song. Substitute also allows Gengar to stall for a turn after using Perish Song and blocks status moves while working with Gengar's incredible Speed, which allows Gengar to move first most of the time. Disable can also be used along with Protect, as most Pokemon, especially supportive Pokemon, carry only one move that can hit Gengar, making it much more annoying to deal with after factoring in Shadow Tag and Perish Song. Choice-locked Pokemon afflicted by Disable are also forced to use Struggle, rendering them useless for three turns. Shadow Ball gives Gengar some offensive presence, allowing it to deal some damage, while Taunt can be used to keep defensive Pokemon from using status moves. While a set lacking any attacking moves may seem odd, this set's aim is to trap and eliminate Pokemon with Perish Song, so attacking moves aren't fully necessary and should only be considered if certain supportive Pokemon are more troublesome for your team to deal with. Other attacking moves such as Sludge Bomb, Icy Wind, and Focus Blast can also be used here to pick off their desired targets, such as Azumarill, Mega Salamence, and Tyranitar, respectively, if your team needs more leverage against them.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With maximum HP investment, Gengar maintains as much bulk as possible, allowing it to avoid being 2HKOed by Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Zapdos and survive Garchomp's Outrage. This in turn makes it much easier for Gengar to safely use Perish Song against even offensive Pokemon that have been trapped by Shadow Tag. A Timid nature and maximum Speed investment make the most of Gengar's major Speed increase after Mega Evolution, allowing it to outpace even neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon at +1, such as Altaria, Dragonite, and Gyarados after a Dragon Dance. Gengarite allows Gengar to Mega Evolve, which is necessary for this set to succeed, as it relies on Shadow Tag to ensure Pokemon are trapped and inevitably taken out after using Perish Song.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In most cases, the best course of action is to Mega Evolve immediately once Gengar is out, using Perish Song as Gengar takes a hit, followed by Protect and either Substitute or Disable to stall for two turns. Once Perish Song's count reaches 1, switch Gengar out to a Pokemon that can comfortably switch into the opposing Pokemon, as the foe will subsequently faint while Gengar is preserved, allowing it to be brought back out later to finish something else off if needed. If running an attacking move, use it to deal damage to Pokemon weak to the move, but don't rely on it to deal significant damage, due this set's lack of Special Attack investment. If running Taunt, use it to keep defensive Pokemon from hindering Gengar with status moves, making it easier to stall them out with Perish Song. When used alongside Disable, Taunt lets Gengar cripple several defensive Pokemon by itself, such as Chansey, Cresselia, Ferrothorn, Gliscor, and even Porygon2.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Wobbuffet is this set's best partner in crime, as its presence makes Gengar much deadlier due to both of them having Shadow Tag to keep foes from switching. This allows Wobbuffet to help Gengar stall with Perish Song and is on top of Wobbuffet's superior bulk, access to Encore, and ability to take down Choice Scarf users that Gengar would struggle against, such as Excadrill and Garchomp. Porygon2 not only has great defensive synergy with Gengar but also excels at checking faster threats to Gengar, such as Greninja, Starmie, and Mega Salamence. Rotom-W checks offensive threats to Gengar, such as Aegislash, Bisharp, Scizor, Talonflame, and Tyranitar, and can use Volt Switch to bring in Gengar safely. Talonflame is able to break down Pokemon Gengar might struggle with, such as Blaziken, Conkeldurr, Magnezone, and Mega Sableye. Pokemon that can handle Dark-types, such as Conkeldurr, Terrakion, Azumarill, Sylveon, and Klefki, are also vastly appreciated by Gengar.</p>"

      {
        "name": "SubDisable",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute lets Gengar avoid status moves and gives it a means of playing around Sucker Punch users, while Disable allows Gengar to prevent a Pokemon from using the last move it used. This is useful, as most Pokemon often carry only one move that can hit Gengar, making it especially troublesome after Gengar has used Substitute to scout the move and Disable to keep them from using it for a few turns. Disable also keeps Choice-locked Pokemon from using their moves, forcing them to helplessly use Struggle or switch out. Shadow Ball is Gengar's most reliable Ghost-type STAB move, while Focus Blast rounds out its coverage perfectly, letting Gengar hit everything for at least neutral damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EVs and nature make Gengar as fast as possible while maximizing Special Attack to capitalize on its offensive presence. Black Sludge is the best item for Gengar to hold, as it gives Gengar passive HP recovery, allowing it to use Substitute numerous times. Though it costs Gengar some longevity compared to Black Sludge and requires an open team slot for Mega Evolution, Gengarite can be used to allow Gengar to gain Shadow Tag, becoming a major nuisance for trapped Pokemon that are unable to hit it, especially Choice-locked Pokemon affected by Disable. A Sitrus Berry can be used, as it gives Gengar 25% of its HP back within a single turn once activated. If this item is chosen, move the 4 EVs from Special Defense to HP in order to give Gengar an HP stat divisible by four, which allows Gengar to use Sitrus Berry after using Substitute twice. If offensive presence is a must, a Life Orb can also be used to make Gengar's attacks as strong as possible, though Gengar's ability to stick around will be cut drastically short.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Substitute on a predicted attack or status move, and use Disable on the next turn if Gengar's Substitute is broken. From there, feel free to capitalize on the situation by either attacking or using Substitute again followed by the appropriate attacks. Be wary, however, of the opponent predicting Disable and using a different move to still hit Gengar, as most of the time Gengar's frailness ensures its Substitute can still be easily broken. Make use of Gengar's typing by switching in on the Normal-, Fighting-, and Ground-type moves it's immune to. This makes Gengar a hassle for Pokemon such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Garchomp to deal with once it gets a Substitute up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rotom-W is a solid partner for Gengar, as it checks Aegislash, Azumarill, Mamoswine, Scizor, and Talonflame, all problematic Pokemon for Gengar due to their bulk and access to priority moves. In return, Gengar is able to switch in on Grass-type moves directed at Rotom-W. In a similar vein, Heatran synergizes well with Gengar, functioning as a solid check to Aegislash, Bisharp, and Talonflame, while Gengar's immunity to Ground- and Fighting-type moves for Heatran is vastly appreciated. Offensive Pokemon such as Garchomp, Greninja, Lopunny, Salamence, and Talonflame can wear down the bulkier Pokemon that Gengar has trouble breaking through, such as Azumarill, Porygon2, and Zapdos. Pokemon such as Azumarill, Bisharp, Conkeldurr, Lucario, and Sylveon pair well with Gengar, as they can switch into Dark-type moves directed at it. Bisharp is a noteworthy partner, as it is immune to Gengar's Psychic weakness and resists Ghost-type moves, while Gengar is immune to the Fighting- and Ground-type moves Bisharp is weak to. Porygon2 also is an excellent partner, as it checks Pokemon faster than Gengar, such as Greninja, Mega Salamence, and Starmie; Porygon2 is also immune to Ghost-type moves, while Gengar is immune to Fighting-type moves Porygon2 is weak to.</p>"

        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb are Gengar's STAB moves, covering a large number of targets for neutral damage. Focus Blast rounds out this coverage by allowing Gengar to break switch-ins such as Porygon2, Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Heatran. Destiny Bond lets Gengar take an attacker down with itself, which can be useful in situations where eliminating a key threat Gengar can't immediately beat is vital to succeeding. Though Icy Wind has a very low Base Power, do not write it off completely, as a Life Orb-boosted Icy Wind can OHKO Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, and Garchomp. Dazzling Gleam hits Fighting-types and Dragon-types not named Garchomp or Salamence harder than any of Gengar's other moves, and it is Focus Sash Gengar's only means of OHKOing Hydreigon and Life Orb Gengar's only way of 2HKOing Conkeldurr. Dazzling Gleam also hits Chesnaught much harder than Icy Wind, which is useful because Chesnaught is immune to all of Gengar's other moves. Will-O-Wisp allows Gengar to provide some support to its team by spreading burns to physical attackers, though the primary target of this is Mega Kangaskhan, which Gengar can easily cripple after a burn. Taunt can be used to hamper defensive Pokemon such as Clefable, Porygon2, and Chansey if your team has issues with them.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The nature and EVs listed maximize Gengar's Speed, making it as fast as possible, while giving it maximum Special Attack to maintain an offensive presence. Life Orb allows Gengar to take its offensive prowess a step further, making Gengar hit as hard as possible while being able to switch moves. Focus Sash ensures Gengar will survive any hit with at least 1 HP and be able to strike back after, allowing Gengar to function as a lead or a revenge killer. Focus Sash also pairs very nicely with Destiny Bond, almost guaranteeing Gengar can nab at least one KO per game.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With Focus Sash, Gengar can serve as a lead, matching up favorably against most offensive Pokemon from the first turn. Gengar can also function as a revenge killer with Focus Sash, picking off weakened foes and threats in an emergency. Take advantage of Gengar's great offensive presence, especially if using Life Orb, as the added power from Life Orb on top of Gengar's great Speed and coverage allows it to act as a battering ram that can be a pain for many Pokemon to switch into. Use Focus Blast to take out targets weak to it, such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Bisharp. After successfully nabbing a KO or using up Gengar's Focus Sash, use Destiny Bond to take the foe down with Gengar if it is unable to immediately dispose of the opposing Pokemon. Take advantage of Levitate to freely switch into predicted Ground-type moves from Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Mamoswine. If Gengar is carrying Icy Wind, these Pokemon can be subsequently dealt with after switching in. Due to its ability to lower the foe's Speed, Icy Wind can also be useful against fast offensive Pokemon such as Greninja and Raikou, especially if Gengar is holding Focus Sash.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Gengar set lacks its own Mega Stone, thus freeing up your team to run a different Pokemon as a Mega Evolution, which can throw your opponent off. While nearly any Mega Evolution can be paired with Gengar, ones such as Lopunny, Kangaskhan, Lucario, and Gyarados most notably have solid defensive synergy with Gengar, as they all cover each other's weaknesses in some way while fending off each other's checks. Take advantage of Gengar's Levitate ability by pairing Gengar with partners that appreciate Gengar's immunity to Ground-type moves, such as Bisharp, Blaziken, Excadrill, Heatran, Manectric, Metagross, and Raikou. Bisharp is noteworthy, as it covers both Gengar's Ghost- and Dark-type weaknesses, handling threats such as Aegislash for Gengar, while Gengar is immune to Bisharp's weaknesses to Ground- and Fighting-type moves. Offensive threats such as Talonflame, Greninja, Garchomp, Azumarill, and Thundurus pair well with Gengar, as they can clean up teams much more easily after Gengar has punched holes in them either by attacking or by using Destiny Bond.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hypnosis is always a bit of a dice roll because of its accuracy, but since the odds are in your favor, it's still a viable choice. Although 60% accuracy might look very unappealing, the benefits of putting a foe to sleep are so strong that it can be worth the risk. Hex is the Ghost-type STAB move of choice because it gets a boost when used against a sleeping Pokemon. Destiny Bond is great when you're looking to take out a big threat, such as Mega Mawile or Mega Kangaskhan. Thanks to Shadow Tag, it can be very difficult for your opponent to play around Destiny Bond, especially if the opposing Pokemon is Choice-locked or only carries attacks. Focus Blast offers perfect coverage alongside Hex. It can surprise Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Porygon2, and specially defensive Heatran, which are otherwise good checks to Mega Gengar. Sludge Bomb can be used for more consistency and coverage against Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Azumarill, and can pick up an OHKO on Serperior. The last moveslot should be decided based on what coverage your team needs.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is used to at least Speed tie with other Mega Gengar while outspeeding some threats such as Greninja, Latios, and Latias. With 12 Special Attack EVs, Hex is a guaranteed OHKO on Aegislash under status. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP so Mega Gengar can take hits better. The remaining 8 EVs are placed in Defense and Special Defense; this is more efficient than adding 8 EVs in HP because it gives an extra stat point. Bulk is important on this set for the turns when Hypnosis misses. The more turns Mega Gengar is active, the more chances you'll have to hit Hypnosis. Levitate is Gengar's only ability before Mega Evolving but can be useful before Mega Evolving against some Ground-types to avoid being OHKOed. In most cases, though, you will want to Mega Evolve Gengar right away to get the huge benefits of Shadow Tag and the extra Speed. An alternate spread of 188 HP / 116 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 196 Spe can be used if you find that maximum Speed investment isn't necessary. 196 Speed EVs allow Mega Gengar to outspeed Pokemon up to maximum Speed Timid Greninja, while the defensive investment allows it to take strong moves such as Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird, Mega Blaziken's Flare Blitz, and Garchomp's Outrage before Gengar Mega Evolves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Hypnosis when Mega Gengar is in a favorable position. It is especially good if you expect your opponent to switch out on the turn you haven't Mega Evolved Gengar, as you'll have a second chance to try to hit Hypnosis if you didn't already on their switch. If you do hit the incoming Pokemon, this gives Mega Gengar a guaranteed free turn to get off an attack. This set can work well as a lead to try to heavily weaken some of your opponent's team. If the opponent doesn't have many or any Pokemon faster than Mega Gengar, it can be very difficult for them to take it down if Hypnosis is hitting consistently. Hypnosis can also put a stop to common lead strategies that involve getting Stealth Rock up. If you can stop Stealth Rock from getting up, you'll disrupt your opponent's game plan quite a bit, putting you in a good position. You can also use Mega Gengar to take on defensive Pokemon, as with Mega Gengar's investment in HP, it can take some hits from their weaker attacks, giving it plenty of turns to hit Hypnosis and start dishing out a lot of damage with Hex. If Mega Gengar is against a big threat to your team, it might be better to attempt to go for a trade with Destiny Bond rather than risking Hypnosis missing. Focus Blast is a niche move that most opponents won't expect, so try to catch switch-ins such as Tyranitar when you see them during Team Preview.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set is not always reliable, so it is best used as a backup Mega Pokemon, such as on teams with Mega Kangaskhan. It can deal with Pokemon that Mega Kangaskhan struggles with such as Cresselia and Mega Slowbro. It can also work well with Mega Blaziken for similar reasons. Mega Gengar works well alongside other status spreaders so Mega Gengar can immediately use Hex on Pokemon that you don't need to put to sleep. Thunder Wave Thundurus, Toxic Suicune, and Will-O-Wisp Talonflame are all good examples. Suicune also appreciates Mega Gengar's ability to trap and deal with Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Serperior. Choice Scarf Garchomp appreciates Mega Gengar's ability to deal with bulky threats such as Cresselia and Porygon2, while Garchomp can handle offensive Pokemon more consistently. Belly Drum Azumarill works well with Mega Gengar thanks to the support it provides with Shadow Tag; Mega Gengar can trap threats to Azumarill such as Mega Venusaur and defensive Rotom-W. Other setup sweepers such as Talonflame and Volcarona can also work well with Mega Gengar. Mega Gengar can use Destiny Bond to take out big threats to these two such as Garchomp and can utilize its coverage with Focus Blast to take out other troublesome Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Heatran. Fire-types in general, such as Talonflame, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard Y, also make good teammates to help deal with Steel- and Ghost-types such as Ferrothorn, Aegislash, and Mega Sableye more consistently so Mega Gengar doesn't have to risk missing Focus Blast or Hypnosis against them. Ghost-types can be hard for Mega Gengar to beat, since they can hit Mega Gengar super effectively and are able to switch out of Shadow Tag if they decide to. Dragonite appreciates Mega Gengar's ability to trap and take out physical walls such as Clefable, Cresselia, and Porygon2 so Dragonite can have a much easier time sweeping.</p>"

  "Raikou": {
    "overview": "<p>The ability to function as a setup sweeper, pivot, and screen supporter makes Raikou an easy fit on many team styles. In addition to its versatility, thanks to its pseudo-BoltBeam coverage and excellent Speed, Raikou can also check some of the top threats seen in the metagame such as Garchomp, Talonflame, and Mega Salamence. With Pressure and a reliable setup move in Calm Mind, Raikou beats defensive threats such as Rotom-W and Cresselia. Raikou not only has advantages over its fellow Electric-types, such as better defenses and not requiring a Mega slot, but also is a great check to other Electric-types, such as Thundurus and Zapdos. However, despite having a decent Special Attack, it lacks the firepower to OHKO Garchomp and Mega Salamence without the aid of Life Orb or Choice Specs, limiting its options. In a more physically oriented metagame such as Battle Spot Singles, Raikou's inferior physical bulk is also a problem, as Ground-type moves are so common even as coverage moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Life Orb is a viable option over Choice Specs that allows the freedom to switch between moves while still netting key OHKOs against threats such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence. Focus Sash allows Raikou to scout for Choice Scarf Ground-types such as Garchomp and Landorus-T without sacrificing itself while being able to 2HKO these threats with Hidden Power Ice. Thunder Wave can be used on non-Choice sets to cripple bulky attackers like Mega Kangaskhan and neuter faster threats such as Mega Gengar and Blaziken, which is especially useful when paired with Focus Sash. Toxic alongside Protect can be run, which allows Raikou to beat defensive threats such as Cresselia, Porygon2, and Zapdos. However, a Pressure stall set is mostly outclassed by the Calm Mind set, as Raikou is forced to run mono-Electric as its only attacking option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Both Mamoswine and Hippowdon take very little from Raikou's coverage moves, due to Thick Fat and phenomenal bulk, respectively, while threatening to OHKO back with STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Jolly Mega Salamence outspeeds Raikou and can OHKO it with Earthquake. Thanks to its ability Multiscale, Dragonite can set up a Dragon Dance on Raikou and proceed to OHKO it. Similarly, Mega Charizard and Mega Altaria survive Choice Specs Raikou's Hidden Power Ice and can OHKO in return at +1.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Although Garchomp and Landorus-T take 4x damage from Hidden Power Ice, both can easily revenge kill Raikou with Choice Scarf equipped. Blaziken outspeeds Raikou after one turn of Speed Boost and OHKOes it with Flare Blitz or High Jump Kick.</p> <p><strong>Weather Sweepers</strong>: Both Excadrill and Mega Swampert can outspeed Raikou in their respective weather conditions and easily OHKO it with STAB Earthquake. Even without weather, the two make solid answers due to Hidden Power Ice dealing only neutral damage.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Both Sylveon and Chansey sponge anything Raikou has due to their fantastic special bulk. While Sylveon's Hyper Voice hits through Substitute, Chansey can muscle past Calm Mind variants prior to setup.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers: Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Mawile, and Mega Heracross can take a Thunderbolt even from Choice Specs Raikou while being able to OHKO in return with their STAB move of choice. Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Heracross are particularly dangerous, being able to break through Substitutes with their multi-hit attacks. Tyranitar comfortably takes Raikou's attacks in sand while being able to retaliate with a STAB move or Earthquake. Ferrothorn resists Raikou's STAB attacks while taking little from its coverage moves and can break Substitute with a Grass-type STAB move or can wear Raikou down with the combination of Leech Seed and Protect. Assault Vest Conkeldurr can eat up Raikou's attacks while using STAB Drain Punch to gain recovery.</p>",

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind increases Raikou's damage output, securing OHKOs on Garchomp and Mega Salamence after one boost. The Special Defense boost also lets Raikou muscle past threats that would otherwise wall it, such as defensive Zapdos, Cresselia, and Porygon2. Thunderbolt is Raikou's most powerful STAB move that has perfect accuracy under normal conditions. Hidden Power Ice completes Raikou's pseudo-BoltBeam coverage and hits most Ground-types that are immune to Thunderbolt. Substitute lets Raikou set up on defensive threats such as Cresselia and Porygon2 more effectively, avoiding nasty status such as Toxic, which would severely cripple it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature should always be run with maximum investment in Speed, allowing Raikou to outspeed as many threats as possible. 236 Speed EVs is an option if you want to outspeed everything up to Mega Lucario, and 228 Speed EVs may be used if you only wish to outspeed Thundurus. Running 220 EVs in HP maximize Leftovers recovery, allowing Raikou to make more Substitutes. The rest of the EVs are allocated to Special Attack, letting Raikou have a chance to OHKO both Mega Salamence and Garchomp at +1. Running maximum Special Attack is also an option, having a chance to OHKO Landorus-T prior to boosting, but you lose the chance to potentially set up Substitute against Suicune's Scald. Leftovers is the best item on the set, offering crucial passive recovery as Raikou sets up Calm Mind behind Substitute. Pressure works in great in conjunction with Substitute, allowing Raikou to effectively stall out PP against more defensive threats such as Rotom-W and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Calm Mind Raikou struggles with bulky offense teams, as they give very few to no opportunities for it to set up. Therefore, if you see teams with Mega Kangaskhan, Mamoswine, or Mega Mawile, it's better to leave out Raikou entirely. The best time to send out Raikou is mid- or late-game, as without any Calm Mind boosts, Hidden Power Ice and even Thunderbolt lack any real firepower. With that said, never stay in on any Ground-types, even Landorus-T, as the chance of a Choice Scarf, Assault Vest, or Focus Sash set is extremely high. As far as defensive threats go, don't try to set up Calm Mind or Substitute on Mega Sableye before it Mega Evolves, as priority Will-O-Wisp can badly hinder Raikou's chance of sweeping late-game. Substitute should always take priority over Calm Mind when you predict a switch, as it not only avoids taking a potential Toxic but also makes Raikou harder to revenge kill. While Choice Scarf Rotom-W is relatively uncommon, when dealing with Rotom-W, be wary of Trick; otherwise, using Substitute is the best option to try to fish for a miss from Hydro Pump before proceeding to set up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Raikou can set up on a lot of defensive threats that Mega Kangaskhan struggles with, such as Cresselia, Mega Sableye, and Porygon2. Raikou can also deal with the bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Suicune, and Slowbro, while Mega Kangaskhan can help Raikou eliminate bulky Fairy-types like Sylveon. In a similar fashion, Mega Salamence, being immune to Ground-types and having Intimidate to soften physical attacks while eliminating Fighting-types such as Assault Vest Conkeldurr, also forms a nice core with Raikou. In turn, Raikou can help Mega Salamence check Thundurus. Coincidently, Suicune and Raikou set up on each other's checks, with Suicune dealing with Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Mamoswine while Raikou can check Thundurus and Zapdos in return. Landorus-T helps Raikou check Mega Charizard X and Garchomp, both Pokemon that Raikou struggles to set up on, and can easily switch into Earthquakes aimed at Raikou. On more offensive teams, Greninja's superior coverage options to hit all Ground-types and even eliminate Dragonite through Multiscale are much appreciated, which will allow Raikou more chances to set up. Serperior can provide Glare support, which helps Raikou set up Substitute or Calm Mind, and also easily eliminate Hippowdon in the process. In turn, Raikou can help Serperior check Talonflame.</p>"

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch lets Raikou pivot out at will while doing decent damage thanks to Choice Specs. Thunderbolt is a powerful and reliable STAB move, 2HKOing specially defensive Thundurus and physically defensive Zapdos. Hidden Power Ice is by far the best coverage option Raikou has, which can OHKO threats such as Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Landorus-T. Shadow Ball is the best move in the last slot, hitting Gengar, Aegislash, and Cresselia for more damage than any other move. Extrasensory can be used if 2HKOing Mega Venusaur is more important for your team while also having a slight, but unreliable, chance to flinch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Speed with a Timid nature allows Raikou to take full advantage of its base 115 Speed, outspeeding crucial threats such as Thundurus, Serperior, and Mega Lucario and getting a Choice Specs-boosted attack in before they can retaliate. Special Attack is also maximized to hit as hard as possible, taking full advantage of Choice Specs. Though not important, the remaining EVs should be allocated to Special Defense, as due to the mechanics of Hidden Power, it's the only viable place where they'll increase Raikou stat by one. Choice Specs allows Raikou to outright OHKO Garchomp and Mega Salamence, both of which cannot be KOed without the item, while offering immediate firepower without the recoil damage from Life Orb.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Specs Raikou is immensely powerful, as Hidden Power Ice will OHKO most threats that are 4x weak to it, and Shadow Ball outright OHKOes Mega Gengar if you choose to use it. Unlike the Calm Mind set, Choice Specs Raikou struggles with defensive threats such as Cresselia and Porygon2, both of which can Toxic Raikou and outstall it with their reliable recovery. Try to avoid spamming Volt Switch early-game if there are opposing Ground-types present in Team Preview. When dealing with Gengar, Volt Switch is the safer option to avoid the Protect + Destiny Bond combination from Mega Gengar while also scouting for Focus Sash from non-Mega Gengar. Shadow Ball is the safer option in general, which can be used to 2HKO offensive variants of Mamoswine, a common switch-in for Raikou. If your team needs a solid switch-in to SwagPlay threats such as Klefki and Thundurus, Raikou is your best bet, as it's immune to Thunder Wave and its Thunderbolt is guaranteed to 2HKO both of them. Thunderbolt is great for late-game, once Ground-types have been removed or scouted for, 2HKOing Mega Kangaskhan. This Raikou may also directly switch into Suicune on a Calm Mind and still comfortably 2HKO it with Thunderbolt.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to the nature of the set being locked into one move, Choice Band Scizor and Choice Specs Raikou form a very nice VoltTurn core. Scizor deals with all Fairy-types Raikou may have trouble with, like Sylveon, and Raikou can check the bulky Water-types, including Rotom-W and Suicune. To further complement this core, Choice Scarf Landorus-T checks Mega Charizard X, something that walls Raikou; provides a general, safe Earthquake switch-in; appreciates the aforementioned Water-types weakened and removed in return; and lastly is a nice part of the VoltTurn core with its own U-turn. Fighting-types such as Blaziken and Mega Heracross both enjoy the removal of bulky Water-types and Talonflame, and they also deal with Mamoswine for Raikou. Cloyster can pressure and set up on Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon so that Raikou may freely spam Choice Specs-boosted Thunderbolt late-game, and in return, Raikou can check fast special attackers such as Thundurus, Mega Charizard Y, and Serperior for Cloyster. Finally, Azumarill checks both Mamoswine and Blaziken, while Raikou can check Slowbro, Thundurus, and Zapdos for Azumarill. Both Talonflame and Mega Salamence make great teammates due to Raikou's ability to take on troublesome Electric-types such as Thundurus and Zapdos.</p>"

        "name": "Dual Screens",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Reflect softens the damage dealt by physical attacks, while Light Screen does the same to special attacks. When these screens are used together, they halve all incoming damage, allowing Raikou to set up even on Earthquake while making your entire team much harder to take down. Volt Switch lets Raikou pivot out once the screens are set up, dealing chip damage and breaking potential Focus Sashes for the next teammate. Hidden Power Ice is an important move in the last slot so that Raikou doesn't get walled by Ground-types that would otherwise potentially have free turns.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature with full investment in Speed allows Raikou to set up screens on as many threats as possible while also making it an effective scout for Choice Scarf users. Maximum HP allows Raikou to be bulky behind screens, gives it more chances to set up both screens before going down, and notably avoids a potential OHKO from Choice Band Garchomp while Raikou is behind Reflect. The remaining 4 EVs have little use and can be allocated to either Special Attack or Special Defense, since they won't have any value if allocated to Defense due to Hidden Power Ice mechanics. Light Clay boosts the duration of both screens from five turns to eight, letting your team benefit from them for potentially the whole match. Pressure is a great ability on a defensive Raikou set, effectively stalling out more of the foes' PP complemented by the extra bulk offered by the screens.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Dual screens Raikou is typically used as a lead to get up screens as soon as possible. Raikou should be used against more offensive teams, as the pressure provided by screens can be a nightmare for opposing teams that rely on OHKOs, which turn to 2HKOs. Although they're uncommon, benching Raikou against stall-oriented teams is the best option, as most of these teams don't mind screens anyway, with Seismic Toss to break Substitute and Unaware users that won't mind your setup sweeper's boosts. Reflect holds priority over Light Screen when faced against Charizard, as Raikou struggles with Mega Charizard X more. Once the screens are up, Volt Switch should be used to preserve Raikou for another chance to set them up at a later point in the game and to get your setup sweepers in immediately.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Setup sweepers with Intimidate such as Mega Salamence and Mega Gyarados are fantastic teammates for Raikou, being able to set up behind screens along with the reduced damage from Intimidate. Mega Salamence easily beats Fighting-types such as Breloom and Mega Heracross and appreciates Raikou's Volt Switch to break Focus Sash. Mega Gyarados can easily set up on Mamoswine, Hippowdon, and Mega Swampert, especially behind screens. Due to its bulk along with plenty of resistances and immunities, Aegislash can benefit from the screens greatly as a common user of Weakness Policy. A lot of these setup sweepers struggle with Thundurus due to Prankster and its great coverage, and Raikou can check it reliably. Mega Charizard X can use Raikou as a setup fodder; for this reason Landorus-T and Garchomp are great teammates that can both check it, while Garchomp can make use of the screens to set up itself. Frail sweepers such as Blaziken, which can easily beat Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, and opposing Raikou that take advantage of this Raikou's passiveness, also appreciate the reduced damage. While Raikou struggles to do anything to defensive threats, including Cresselia, Porygon2, and Mega Sableye, Suicune can easily set up Calm Mind on these threats while appreciating Raikou's ability to freely switch into Electric-types and set up screens.</p>"

  "Entei": {
    "overview": "<p>Entei can make even the mightiest physical attackers cower in fear of Sacred Fire, if that is what you wish. Sacred Fire is the main selling point of Entei, as it deals good damage to most Pokemon that don't resist it and has a 50% chance to burn the target. Since it is not a contact move, it also avoids the Attack drop from King's Shield, which can make Entei a decent check to Aegislash. In addition to this, it doesn't have to worry about Rocky Helmet, unlike other physical attackers. Entei provides a check against many dangerous Pokemon in Battle Spot Singles, such as Volcarona, Rotom-H, Mega Charizard Y, Thundurus, Gengar, and Aegislash. Its lack of a Fighting-type weakness differentiates it from Heatran and complements its overall bulk, and Base 100 Speed allows it to outspeed Pokemon such as Breloom and Heracross with little investment.</p> <p>Entei's downsides are its incredibly shallow movepool and inability to deal with bulky Water- and Ground-types. The loss of Extreme Speed and Flare Blitz in the Battle Spot Singles metagame limits its movepool further and makes it very predictable. It is weak to many common Pokemon in the metagame, such as Garchomp, Kangaskhan, Landorus-T, and Suicune. However, many of these threats cannot safely switch into Sacred Fire.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Entei has a shallow movepool that is further hindered by the Pentagon rule, so there are few other options when it comes to attacks. Entei can run Snarl to weaken special attackers, although this has low damage output. Return or Frustration are decent options, but Sacred Fire is generally the better move when hitting Pokemon for neutral damage due to its secondary effect. Sleep Talk can be used on the Choice Band set if you need a team member to absorb sleep, although this is situational. Rest is Entei's only means of reliable recovery, but it comes at the cost of sleep turns or running Sleep Talk; both of these options limit Entei's effectiveness and coverage. Iron Tail deals more damage than Iron Head, but its low accuracy can often be detrimental. Will-O-Wisp can burn physical attackers, but Sacred Fire is a much better option because of the additional damage output. As for items, Lum Berry and Choice Scarf are also viable options. Special sets may surprise Entei's usual counters, but a physical set is generally better, as 90 Special Attack isn't very impressive and Entei suffers from a shallow movepool on the special side as well.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran can come in on Sacred Fire and threaten Entei with Earth Power. Heatran must watch out for Bulldoze, though, as it is capable of OHKOing it. Air Balloon Heatran, in particular, is an excellent counter to Entei due to its immunity to Bulldoze.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune can tank Entei's attacks and threaten it with their STAB Water-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Suicune: Suicune is especially dangerous among bulky Water-types, as it can switch into any of Entei’s attacks, PP stall with Pressure, and set up with Calm Mind. It can also use Rest to get rid of a burn.</p> <p><strong>Rock- and Ground-types</strong>: Rock- and Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Tyranitar immediately threaten Entei with STAB moves such as Earthquake and Rock Tomb. Landorus-T also has Intimidate, which lessens Entei's offensive presence. These Pokemon must be wary of switching into Sacred Fire, though, for fear of a burn.</p> <p><strong>Garchomp: Lum Berry Garchomp can easily tank a Sacred Fire, outspeed, and OHKO Entei with Earthquake, making it an excellent counter. Other variants cannot freely switch into Sacred Fire but can easily KO Entei if they manage to get on the field.</p> <p><strong>Facade Mega Salamence</strong>: Mega Salamence can come in on any of Entei's attacks, and it does not fear a burn if it is running Facade. Even Mega Salamence lacking Facade is a threat to Entei if it manages to get on the field without a burn, although Facade's usage is high enough to be taken into consideration.</p>",

        "name": "Assault Vest",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sacred Fire is the main STAB attack of this set, dealing solid damage with a 50% chance to burn the target. This can make checks such as Garchomp, Kangaskhan, and Tyranitar think twice before switching in. Sacred Fire can eliminate Pokemon such as Aegislash, Serperior, Weavile, and Mega Mawile. Stone Edge hits Fire-types that resist Sacred Fire, such as Talonflame or Mega Charizard Y. Bulldoze punishes Heatran with heavy damage and a Speed drop. Flame Charge, although weak, can raise Entei's speed to help it sweep, whereas Iron Head deals more damage to Rock- and Fairy-types such as Tyranitar, Clefable, and Mega Altaria.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Assault Vest takes advantage of Entei's natural bulk and ability to spread burns with Sacred Fire. This allows it to switch into attacks such as Sylveon's or Gardevoir's Hyper Voice with relative ease. Maximum Attack EVs and an Adamant nature allow Entei to hit as hard as possible, while the HP and Defense EVs give Entei good general bulk. In particular, 132 HP and 52 Defense EVs allow Entei to survive a Double-Edge from Adamant Mega Salamence. 52 Special Defense EVs, coupled with Assault Vest, give Entei a little special bulk to tank some weak hits and allows it to survive a Draco Meteor from Modest Choice Specs Hydreigon. 20 Speed EVs allow neutral nature Entei to outspeed Adamant Bisharp and Breloom, and after one Flame Charge, base 115 Pokemon by one point.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Spamming Sacred Fire is generally the best way to use Entei, unless you predict a Flash Fire user or Fire-type switch-in. However, if the foe is low on health, KOing it with Flame Charge can help Entei avoid getting revenge killed. Assault Vest allows Entei to switch into resisted attacks fairly easily. Similarly, Entei's immunity to Will-O-Wisp allows it to switch into many Ghost-types, such as Aegislash, Gengar, and Sableye.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune can cover Entei's Rock- and Ground-type weaknesses and are better able to deal with opposing Fire-types. Garchomp and Landorus are also good partners for this reason. Landorus in particular can come in on Ground-type moves aimed at Entei. Thundurus can help Entei against bulky Water-types, and it can also prevent Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Salamence from setting up on Entei by neutralizing them with Prankster Thunder Wave. Grass-types such as Serperior, Mega Venusaur, and Breloom can help cover Entei's Rock-, Ground- and Water-type weaknesses as well.</p> <p>Gengar is a good teammate for Entei because of its immunity to Ground-type moves and ability to take advantage of burned foes with Hex. Hydreigon has good type synergy with Entei and appreciates Entei's ability to threaten Fairy-types. Cresselia can come in on Garchomp or Landorus-T's Earthquake and threaten it with Ice Beam.</p>"

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sacred Fire is Entei's main move, capable of dealing good damage and inflicting burns. Stone Edge helps against predicted Flash Fire users and Fire-types such as Talonflame switching in. Bulldoze lowers the foe's Speed and is the best move against Heatran. Iron Head is mostly a filler, but can deal a lot of damage against Tyranitar, Clefable, and Mega Altaria.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Band, an Adamant nature, and maximum Attack investment allow Entei to hit as hard as possible. A Jolly nature can be used instead to outspeed Lucario and Kangaskhan before they Mega Evolve. Maximum Speed EVs allow Entei to outspeed everything up to positive-natured base 86 Pokemon. If you want more bulk, a spread of 132 HP / 252 Atk / 52 Def / 52 SpD / 20 Spe can be used instead.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Sacred Fire is the move you will be using the most, as it is Entei's main STAB and can spread burns. Many strong physical attackers like Kangaskhan can OHKO Entei but do not want to switch into Sacred Fire for fear of a burn. Be wary of Flash Fire users and Pokemon that resist Sacred Fire. Pokemon that can use these resistances to their advantage and set up on Entei, such as Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X, are particularly dangerous. Entei is effective at crippling the opponent's team early with burns and damage. It is generally best to bring Entei in after a Pokemon has been KOed or into a resisted attack. Leading with Entei is not a good idea because it has poor matchups against many common leads, like Garchomp. Garchomp often carries Lum Berry, neutering Entei's Sacred Fire even further.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune can cover Entei's weakness to Ground- and Rock-types and deal with opposing Fire-types. Grass-types, especially the ones that can deal with bulky Water-types, can help round out coverage; Breloom in particular is a good teammate for Entei because it helps get rid of Dark-, Rock-, and Water-types such as Hydreigon, Tyranitar, and Rotom-W and also provides Spore support. However, it should be noted that Breloom's Spore can conflict with Entei's Sacred Fire. Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Togekiss, Gardevoir, Whimsicott, and Azumarill benefit from Entei's ability to deal with Steel-types. Togekiss also helps Entei thanks to its immunity to Ground-types. Porygon2 is a good defensive teammate for Entei and is a good check to Intimidate users if running Trace. Mega Salamence appreciates Entei's ability to deal with Ice-types.</p>"

        "name": "Pressure Stall",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute allows Entei to rack up damage from burns and poison, as well as PP stall with Pressure. It also blocks status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave. Protect helps stall longer, while scouting the opponent. Toxic poison deals more residual damage compared to burn, and thus is useful against walls. It shuts down defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia, Zapdos, Porygon2, and Rotom-W. Sacred Fire is Entei's only attacking move and can burn the foe.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Entei to get the jump on Mamoswine and more effectively set up Substitute. 20 HP EVs give maximum Leftovers recovery while maintaining as much Attack as possible. Leftovers, along with Protect, helps Entei increase its longevity and recover health lost by Substitute. This set capitalizes on Entei's ability, Pressure, through the use of Substitute and Protect.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is best used after the Pokemon that threaten Entei are gone, as it is easy for Pokemon such as Suicune to set up on it. Once the threat of such boosters is gone, it is particularly effective against stall and defensive teams. This set is somewhat susceptible to Taunt due to its reliance on non-attacking moves. Fast Substitutes and Protect can be used to PP stall with Pressure and rack up damage from Toxic or burn.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bulky Water-, Fairy-, and Grass-types are generally good teammates because they can cover Entei’s weaknesses. Pokemon such as Calm Mind Suicune and Belly Drum Azumarill can take advantage of Entei’s ability to cripple the foe. Pokemon with the ability to check bulky Water-types, such as Rotom-W, Mega-Venusaur, and Thundurus, are useful teammates for Entei.</p> <p>Strong sweepers such as Mega Kangaskhan appreciate Entei's ability to weaken the foe and give it an opportunity to come in and sweep. Mega Mawile appreciates the synergy and support that Entei offers; Entei can take Will-O-Wisps and Fire-type moves and handle threats such as Ferrothorn and opposing Mega Mawile.</p>"

  "Suicune": {
    "overview": "<p>Suicune is one of the best Water-types in the format thanks to its great all-around bulk. With its good physical and special defenses, it can be very difficult to take out for some teams, and with Pressure, it can be very effective at stalling other Pokemon out. It's able to check a lot of Pokemon in the metagame such as Garchomp, Mega Kangaskhan, Blaziken, Mega Salamence, and Mamoswine. It often runs Calm Mind to become more threatening offensively as well and has solid Water- and Ice-type coverage that covers most of the metagame bar other Water-types. Suicune can run a variety of viable sets, including moves that can throw off your opponent's game plan such as Mirror Coat, Icy Wind, and Substitute. It has a decent Speed tier for a defensive Pokemon, outspeeding foes such as Porygon2, Tyranitar, and, with some investment, also others such as Rotom-W and Cresselia. However, Suicune's low Special Attack means it needs a few Calm Mind boosts before it can do significant damage. Its only recovery is Rest, which can be somewhat unreliable. If it takes too many hits early on in a match and is forced to use Rest, it is often not as good at dealing with strong threats late-game such as Mega Salamence, Blaziken, and Mega Kangaskhan.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sitrus Berry is a decent item for some recovery; it works well with Mirror Coat so Suicune doesn't have to lose as much HP when taking a hit from something like Rotom-W or Thundurus. Surf can be used on sets with Toxic, since you won't always want to burn the opposing Pokemon, but there are some scenarios where you would still want Scald burns on Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and Garchomp, so Scald is usually preferred. Snarl can be really annoying for some special attackers, but the opponent can just switch out to remove the drops, so just using Calm Mind to raise Suicune's Special Defense is usually better. Assault Vest can make use of Mirror Coat and surprise some opponents by letting Suicune take strong Electric-type attacks such as Choice Specs-boosted Thunderbolt from Rotom-W and Thundurus-T, and it can also help Suicune take on many other special attackers with the Special Defense boost. However, Suicune's Special Attack is pretty low and it can't function as well with only attacks, so Assault Vest is only a really viable option when non-Pentagon sets with Sheer Cold are legal.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types hit Suicune super effectively, and since Suicune usually doesn't invest in Special Defense and most Electric-types are special attackers, they hit Suicune really hard. Rotom-W resists both Scald and Ice Beam and has a chance to OHKO Suicune with Choice Specs-boosted Thunderbolt before a Calm Mind. Thundurus and Raikou can use Nasty Plot and Calm Mind to keep up with Suicune's boosts from Calm Mind and manage to muscle past it. Zapdos has to watch out for Ice Beam but can Roost off most damage Suicune does and fire back with Thunderbolts.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Breloom hits Suicune really hard with Bullet Seed and can break through sets with Substitute. Serperior gets boosts from Leaf Storm to outpace Calm Mind boosts. Mega Venusaur has Thick Fat so it doesn't take much from Ice Beam, hits super effectively with Giga Drain, and can stall Suicune out with help from Leech Seed or Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Status Absorbers: Pokemon with Facade such as Mega Salamence and Mega Kangaskhan can surprise Suicune and take advantage of burns from Scald. Mega Heracross easily 2HKOes with Bullet Seed and breaks through sets with Substitute. It can switch into Scald before Mega Evolving and take advantage of potential burns thanks to Guts. Conkeldurr has Guts to benefit from Scald burns and usually has Assault Vest, so it takes little from Suicune's attacks. It can also Knock Off Suicune's item, which is usually very valuable.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Users: Opposing Calm Mind users can potentially beat Suicune in a Calm Mind war. Pokemon with Psyshock, such as Slowbro and Cresselia, are particularly threatening, as they easily beat Suicune because they hit its Defense. Sylveon can use Yawn and muscle past Suicune on the turns it's sleeping, and it can also hit through sets with Substitute with Hyper Voice. Raikou is able to hit Suicune super effectively and can use Substitute to its advantage. Other Suicune with Calm Mind can be an issue if your Suicune doesn't have Calm Mind or Roar. However, some of these Pokemon have to be wary of Substitute + Protect sets stalling them out of their moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Suicune typically invests in its Defense, so many special attackers are able to 2HKO it. Choice Specs Sylveon and Gardevoir can do a lot of damage to Suicune and hit through Substitute variants with Hyper Voice. Latios and Hydreigon can 2HKO with Draco Meteor even at -2. Although Calm Mind can help against these Pokemon, Suicune will usually have to set up Calm Mind before they come in to have a chance to beat them. Mega Charizard Y can 2HKO Suicune with Solar Beam and takes little damage from Scald in the sun.</p> <p><strong>Trick: Pokemon such as Rotom-A and Latios can cripple Suicune with a Choice item, as it heavily relies on using its status moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Some bulky Water-types can be a problem for Suicune. Against Azumarill, Suicune needs to rely on getting a Scald burn, or Azumarill can easily set up a Belly Drum and OHKO with +6 Play Rough. Slowbro is hard for Suicune to break through, and if it's a Calm Mind variant it can beat Suicune in a Calm Mind war with Psyshock. Jellicent can set up Trick Room on Suicune and use Taunt to stop it from using Calm Mind or Rest.</p>",

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind is used to give Suicune a threatening offensive presence; Calm Mind makes Suicune harder for Special Attackers to take on and able to potentially sweep teams. Scald is Suicune's best STAB move because of the high chance to burn, which cripples physical attackers and helps break through bulky Pokemon faster. Ice Beam hits common targets such as Garchomp and Mega Salamence and offers nice coverage against some Grass- and Flying-types such as Breloom and Thundurus. Rest gives Suicune recovery and helps to avoid getting Toxic stalled from the likes of Cresselia and Porygon2.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment is used to take on the many common physical attackers in the format that Suicune can handle, such as Blaziken and Garchomp. Suicune doesn't need to invest in Special Defense because Calm Mind takes care of its Special Defense nicely. Chesto Berry is used so Rest can be used as a reliable option for recovery. It is much more consistent than using up a moveslot on Sleep Talk, which takes up Suicune's coverage and makes you risk wasting two turns. Pressure is the only ability available to Suicune, but it can be very useful to stall out moves, especially ones with only 8 PP.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Suicune should try to get Calm Minds up before special attackers come in. Using Calm Mind allows Suicune to put pressure on the opponent; it can set up on foes it threatens out, and the boosts allow it to better take on whatever switches in. Defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia and Hippowdon can easily be used as setup fodder thanks to Rest and Chesto Berry getting rid of any status. Against strong Pokemon such as Mega Salamence and Blaziken, it is usually be better to attack because they are able to 2HKO Suicune, so setting up Calm Mind could cost you the game. Suicune should be wary of other special attackers that can set up, as it won't usually be able to beat them, such as Nasty Plot Thundurus and other Calm Mind Pokemon that will usually come out on top.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Suicune works well with Mega Kangaskhan, as Suicune can set up on defensive Pokemon that Mega Kangaskhan struggles to beat such as Cresselia and Hippowdon. Suicune also beats offensive Pokemon that can threaten Mega Kangaskhan such as Blaziken and Garchomp. Mega Gengar can trap threats to Suicune like bulky Grass-types such as Serperior and Mega Venusaur. Mega Gengar can usually beat defensive Rotom-W with status and Hex as well as burn Mega Kangaskhan with Will-O-Wisp so Suicune doesn't have to rely on Scald burns, making it much easier for Suicune to deal with. Blaziken likes Suicune as a teammate because Suicune can deal with Ground-types such as Garchomp and Landorus-T. Suicune also handles Mega Salamence decently so Blaziken doesn't need to worry about it. Mamoswine can help Suicune deal with Thundurus and Zapdos. Garchomp appreciates Suicune because it can use Cresselia as setup fodder and handle Mamoswine easily. Taking these Pokemon out can make it much easier for a Choice Scarf or Swords Dance Garchomp to clean up. Talonflame and Mega Salamence can help take out bulky Grass-types for Suicune. Suicune can also help deal with threats such as Tyranitar and Heatran for Talonflame, and Mamoswine for Mega Salamence. Thundurus can help spread paralysis around so Suicune can outspeed more Pokemon, making it earlier for Suicune to take them out or set up Calm Mind against them. Thundurus can also take out bulky Water-types for Suicune such as Slowbro, Jellicent, and opposing Suicune. Suicune can also help deal with threats to Thundurus such as Tyranitar and Ground-types like Mamoswine, Excadrill, and Garchomp. Serperior can deal with bulky Water-types and also Breloom thanks to Reflect and Rocky Helmet. Suicune also appreciates the paralysis support from Serperior and helps deal with Pokemon that threaten Serperior such as Blaziken and Talonflame.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is Suicune's best STAB move, as the high chance to burn is very valuable. Ice Beam hits a lot of common targets such as Garchomp and Mega Salamence and offers nice coverage on Pokemon that resist Water such as Breloom and Serperior. Icy Wind can be used instead, as it still 2HKOes many common Ice-weak Pokemon, and with some Speed investment, Suicune can outspeed them the next turn to avoid more damage. Rest gives Suicune some recovery; it ensures Suicune doesn't go down too soon and allows more turns of Rocky Helmet damage to rack up. Roar helps stop setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Garchomp, Dragon Dance Mega Salamence, Calm Mind Suicune, Calm Mind Slowbro, and Quiver Dance Volcarona. Mirror Coat can help Suicune take out some special attackers that would be tough to deal with otherwise such as Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Gengar. Toxic can wear down other defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia and Porygon2. It can also be nice to stack residual damage alongside Rocky Helmet against physical attackers. Reflect lets Suicune beat Mega Kangaskhan and other physical attackers very well. It can also help teammates out if Suicune goes down. Sleep Talk can be used alongside Rest if you want the chance to attack while Suicune is sleeping after Rest.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment is used because this set is used primarily to deal with physical attackers such as Blaziken and Mega Kangaskhan. When you're using Icy Wind, an alternate spread of 252 HP / 188 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 60 Spe with a Bold nature can be used; this spread allows Suicune to outspeed Garchomp after a Speed drop while maximizing Suicune's bulk. Rocky Helmet is used mainly for Mega Kangaskhan, as Parental Bond will activate Rocky Helmet twice, but it is also useful for other physical Pokemon that make contact such as Blaziken, Mega Salamence, and Talonflame. It is especially nice against these Pokemon because they often use moves with recoil and therefore get a ton of residual damage, making it easier for Suicune to finish them off. Pressure is the only ability Suicune has, but it can sometimes be useful to stall out the foe's moves, especially ones with only 8 PP.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is used primarily to take on physical attackers; it can tank hits and use Rocky Helmet to put things closer to KO range. Suicune can switch directly into threats such as Mega Kangaskhan and Blaziken, as Rocky Helmet will rack up a lot of damage and can potentially take out Mega Kangaskhan after Double-Edge recoil. However, if you need Suicune to survive for the rest of the match, you should be wary taking these powerful Pokemon on, as Double-Edge from Adamant Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Salamence have the potential to 2HKO. For the most success Suicune should be brought in on a free turn if possible, after a Pokemon faints or via Volt Switch or U-turn. Coming in safely guarantees Suicune can get an attack off on Pokemon that are able to 2HKO it. Roar can be used when you expect your opponent to switch; this shuffles out what will probably be their answer to Suicune coming in. This is especially effective when Stealth Rock is up to get a bit of chip damage. Mirror Coat is optimal against special attackers that your team struggles with and Suicune might not be able to win against such as defensive Rotom-W and Sylveon. This should usually only be used when Suicune isn't as valuable to you anymore, as it will often have to take a big hit in the process, which will make it easy to revenge kill afterwards.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Suicune works well with offensive teams, as with all the chip damage Suicune is able to get with Rocky Helmet, Toxic, and Scald, it can wear down teams very nicely for its teammates. Blaziken appreciates Suicune's ability to handle Talonflame and Mega Salamence. Since both these Pokemon often use moves with recoil, Suicune's Rocky Helmet is able to really hinder them, and Suicune threatens each of them with super effective attacks. When you're using Roar, a Pokemon with Stealth Rock synergizes very well. Good setters include Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Hippowdon. Focus Sash Garchomp and Mamoswine can also deal with Electric-types such as Thundurus and Raikou. Ferrothorn can also set Stealth Rock and can deal with some Water-types Suicune might struggle with such as Azumarill. Mega Kangaskhan appreciates Suicune's ability to deal with Pokemon such as Blaziken, Mega Salamence, and Garchomp. With faster threatening Pokemon being dealt with, Mega Kangaskhan has a much easier time. Garchomp appreciates Suicune dealing with Mamoswine and opposing Garchomp. Suicune can also switch into Talonflame, which could burn Garchomp. If running Toxic, Suicune can also help deal with Cresselia and Porygon2. Breloom helps deal with Water-types like Rotom-W and Azumarill. Rock Tomb can make it easier for Suicune to take out certain Pokemon such as Thundurus and Choice Band Dragonite after Breloom goes down. Volcarona likes having Suicune around to deal with Talonflame and Mega Salamence, making it easier to pull off a sweep. Volcarona can also set up on Pokemon Suicune struggles with such as Serperior and Ferrothorn, Lum Berry ensures Volcarona can take a paralysis from either of them as well. Nasty Plot Thundurus can muscle past Rotom-W and opposing Suicune, which are difficult for Suicune to handle. Thundurus can also spread paralysis around so Suicune's Speed doesn't hinder it as much. In return, Suicune can switch into many Thundurus checks such as Mamoswine and Tyranitar. Aegislash can switch into Sylveon, which hits Suicune really hard. Suicune also deals with some Fire-types such as Heatran and Blaziken for Aegislash. Thundurus-T can be a nice teammate able to switch into Electric-types such as Thundurus for Suicune and also easily take out Water-types that Suicune can't break through, while Suicune deals with Mamoswine and other fast Ground-types that threaten Thundurus-T.</p>"

      {
        "name": "Fast Substitute",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is Suicune's best STAB move; it might seem to synergize poorly with Toxic, but there are some situations against physical attackers where it is better to burn the opposing Pokemon rather than badly poison it. Substitute is used to avoid status such as burn and poison while also taking less damage from attacks each turn it's used. Substitute can also be useful to avoid being taken out by OHKO moves from Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Glalie. Toxic can be used to stall Pokemon out, taking advantage of Substitute and Protect to use up as many turns of Toxic as possible. Calm Mind gives Suicune the potential to sweep and a good offensive presence; it can set up Substitutes and boost behind them against a lot of defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia and Porygon2. Protect synergizes well with Substitute, as it gives Suicune free turns to get more Leftovers recovery and allows Suicune to make more Substitutes throughout the match. This can also work well with Pressure, as with Substitute and Protect, Suicune can quickly stall out low-PP moves such as Leaf Storm and Fissure. Protect can also mess with Blaziken running High Jump Kick, as they will take 50% when attacking against Protect. Ice Beam can be used for some coverage, which is especially nice with Calm Mind, as it helps against Mega Salamence and Serperior and takes out Garchomp faster.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The HP investment hits a Leftovers number, giving Suicune more recovery each turn to make more Substitutes. The Speed EVs with a Timid nature let Suicune outspeed positive-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Mamoswine. The remaining EVs are spread out between defenses, with more in Special Defense so Porygon2 gets an Attack raise from Download. Alternatively, maximum Speed investment can be run to outrun neutral-natured maximum Speed Gliscor and Speed tie with Modest Hydreigon, sacrificing some EVs in each defense to make room. Contrary to other Suicune sets, this one has less bulk because the main goal is to use Substitute to take attacks most of the time, so more bulk isn't needed. Leftovers is necessary to make more Substitutes. Although Pressure is the only usable ability, it works great with this set to stall out moves with Substitute and Protect. An alternate spread of 244 / 44 Def / 220 Spe with a Bold nature can be used; this spread lets Suicune outspeed up to maximum Speed base 80s with a neutral nature and focuses more on its bulk, allowing it to play more closely to a tank set.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set does very well against defensive Pokemon and stall teams. It can set up Substitutes on passive Pokemon such as Cresselia and Slowbro, as Substitute will dodge any status they try to use, and most attacks from them won't be able to break Suicune's Substitute in one turn. Substitute should be used when you're expecting your opponents to switch to get the advantage next turn. Toxic should be used on most defensive Pokemon and Pokemon that you don't need to burn with Scald. When up against a physical attacker such as Mega Kangaskhan or Garchomp, Scald should be used over Toxic to get a potential burn, which will be much more useful. Once a Pokemon is badly poisoned Suicune, should continuously use Substitute and Protect until the Pokemon is in range where Scald is enough to finish it off. When using Calm Mind, Suicune should try to use Substitute against Pokemon that can't break it, using defensive Pokemon as setup fodder to get as many Calm Minds as possible. Once Suicune gets a couple boosts and is behind a Substitute, it becomes very difficult to deal with. Against Pokemon with low-PP moves, Substitute and Protect with Pressure can help counter them. This is especially good against Serperior, as it is a common Suicune check and some sets often run Leaf Storm as their only move. When running Calm Mind, paralysis support can help a lot when trying to set up so Suicune can use Substitute in front of Pokemon that would otherwise outspeed it, and getting Substitute on a full paralysis gives Suicune a huge advantage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Garchomp, Blaziken, and Mega Salamence all appreciate Suicune's ability to deal with physical walls such as Cresselia and Slowbro easily with Toxic. Mega Gengar can use the Toxic Suicune inflicts to do more damage with Hex. It can also trap threats to Suicune such as Sylveon. Thundurus helps deal with opposing Suicune, as Rest variants can be hard for Toxic Suicune to deal with. It also provides paralysis support for sets with Calm Mind, as Suicune can set up Substitutes on the slowed Pokemon and really take advantage of free turns from full paralyses. Suicune also deals with Mamoswine for Thundurus. Bulky Serperior can help deal with Ferrothorn and Breloom; Breloom is especially threatening to Suicune because it very often runs Bullet Seed, which will break through Suicune's Substitutes. Serperior can also use Glare to support Calm Mind in setting up. Mega Salamence works well with Suicune, as it can deal with Mega Venusaur and Breloom, and Suicune can deal with Mamoswine, Cresselia, and Porygon2 for Salamence. Mamoswine really appreciates Cresselia and Porygon2 being badly poisoned and can deal with Thundurus for Suicune. Cresselia can work on teams with this Suicune, as without high Defense investment, it becomes harder for Suicune to deal with threats such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Salamence. Cresselia can also offer paralysis support for Calm Mind sets and use Lunar Dance to bring Suicune back to full health if it gets too low after using Substitute so many times. In return, Suicune does well against other defensive Pokemon like Porygon2, which Cresselia has trouble doing much damage to. When you're running Toxic, other teammates with Substitute can also take advantage of Toxic such as Mega Salamence with Substitute and Roost and Gliscor with Poison Heal. Landorus-T appreciates Cresselia being badly poisoned and can U-turn when it expects Cresselia to come in to allow Suicune to come in for free so Suicune doesn't have to risk switching into Toxic from Cresselia.</p>"

  "Greninja": {
    "overview": "<p>Greninja might seem like an unassuming, mediocre Pokemon on the surface, but just like a real ninja, it's hiding a deadly weapon under its unassuming appearance in the formidable Protean! Protean gives Greninja STAB on every one of its attacks, making it deceptively powerful, and Greninja's high Speed and diverse attacking movepool let it revenge kill dangerous threats such as Garchomp and punish most offensive switch-ins. However, Greninja isn't very versatile on the item front; it's forced to use either Life Orb or Focus Sash, restricting the item options of your team. Greninja's defenses are rather subpar, and its typing will usually only protect it from Sucker Punch and situational attacks via Protean typing changes. Greninja also has a difficult time covering the whole metagame with just four moveslots, and with the moves it has, Greninja will often just miss out on a KO against healthy Pokemon. All of these aspects combined mean that Greninja must be played with care, or else it will simply waste a Pokemon and item slot. Greninja might not be the easiest Pokemon to use, but don't let your guard down, because Greninja is a Pokemon that is worth more than the sum of its parts. Protean is still an excellent ability that gives out game-changing rewards with good prediction, thanks to its type-changing properties giving Greninja the chance to survive moves that would normally OHKO it. This means that a well-played Greninja is among the most deadly assassins in the Battle Spot Singles metagame, so giving a Greninja a contract for your team is a fine choice as long as you're prepared for its flaws.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>On the support side of things, Greninja gets access to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. They might seem appealing at first, but because Battle Spot Singles is rather fast-paced, the extra damage they do to grounded Pokemon usually isn't worth the turn required to set them up. Toxic, on the other hand, can work fairly well to cripple Porygon2 and give Greninja a valuable Fighting-type resistance. Rock Slide and Rock Tomb are reasonable offensive options if your team has especially big problems with Mega Charizard Y, and the resistance to Brave Bird can leave Talonflame unable to KO a healthy Greninja. While Shadow Sneak is fairly weak even with the STAB boost, it can be used to get a surprise Fighting immunity and also prevent an OHKO from Mega Gengar's Sludge Bomb or Focus Blast. Choice Specs and Choice Band might seem like great ways to make Greninja into an even more frightening sweeper, but being locked into moves makes Greninja extremely vulnerable to revenge killing. Choice Scarf suffers similar problems, except it leaves Greninja in an even weaker state in exchange for surprise KOs against other Choice Scarf Pokemon. Expert Belt can be used if your team desperately needs another Pokemon to use Life Orb, but the loss in power is significant. Finally, you can elect to use King's Rock with Water Shuriken to get horrifying surprise flinches on your foes, but the loss in power usually isn't worth the cruelty.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Porygon2: Greninja has no hope of breaking through a healthy Porygon2, while Porygon2 can threaten to paralyze Greninja with Thunder Wave, wear it down with Ice Beam, or even obliterate it with a boosted Tri Attack.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Even mixed Greninja is unable to 2HKO Chansey with Gunk Shot, leaving Chansey able to stop Greninja in its tracks with paralysis and Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Mega Gengar, Mega Manectric, and Mega Lopunny can easily revenge kill Greninja. Additionally, Choice Scarf users can usually smash through Greninja's poor defenses.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame and Blaziken: Much like Ryu Hayabusa, Greninja has a difficult time with fast birds such as Talonflame and Blaziken. Neither of these two can switch into Greninja easily, but they will outspeed and OHKO Greninja thanks to Gale Wings and Speed Boost, respectively. Just note, both Talonflame and Blaziken are 2HKOed by Water Shuriken.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks:</strong>: Priority Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Breloom, Conkeldurr, and Mega Lucario will smash Greninja before it even gets the chance to move, which is especially harmful because Greninja is often an Ice- or Dark-type. Note that Greninja can turn the tables on them with smart use of Protean.</p> <p><strong>Focus Sash: Focus Sash is especially problematic for Life Orb Greninja, as failing to OHKO the foe usually means an early grave for Greninja.</p> <p><strong>Thunder Wave</strong>: Surprise Thunder Waves can turn Greninja from hero to zero due to losing its excellent Speed tier.</p> <p><strong>Mega Mawile</strong>: Hydro Pump and Hidden Power Fire do a lot, but otherwise Greninja can't touch Mega Mawile, while Mega Mawile can use Greninja's fear of Play Rough to set up a Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Any Greninja that lacks Extrasensory has no hope of breaking through Mega Venusaur, giving it ample time to set up Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan</strong>: Mega Kangaskhan fears Low Kick but can otherwise use Fake Out and Double-Edge or Return backed by Parental Bond to make even Focus Sash Greninja a non-issue. Also, Fake Out and Sucker Punch together will destroy Greninja if Protean hasn't changed it into a Dark-or Fighting-type.</p> <p><strong>Charizard</strong>: Charizard has no chance of switching into Greninja well, but Mega Charizard Y and Mega Charizard X are not KOed by any of Greninja's moves, giving them the chance to set up a potential sweep with Flame Charge or Dragon Dance.</p> <p><strong>Blissey: Unlike Chansey, Blissey can be 2HKOed by Gunk Shot. However, pure special attacking Greninja are still hopelessly walled, and Blissey has the bonus of being able to carry Shed Shell to nullify Greninja and Mega Gengar partnerships.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Beam is Greninja's main tool of assassination, allowing Greninja to OHKO most Pokemon 4x weak to Ice, KO physically defensive Hippowdon, and have a 68% chance of OHKOing Zapdos. While Dark Pulse doesn't hit as many targets super effectively, it allows Greninja to 2HKO Cresselia and Aegislash (though you should watch out for Weakness Policy) and OHKO Mega Gengar. Greninja might have a low Attack stat, but Gunk Shot makes Greninja an effective mixed attacker. It OHKOes Azumarill and Sylveon and 2HKOes offensive Rotom-W, Pokemon that would otherwise counter Greninja. Because Greninja also survives a Belly Drum-boosted Aqua Jet at full health, it can be an effective emergency check to Belly Drum Azumarill. Gunk Shot also gives Greninja a Fighting resistance, meaning that users of Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave can no longer check Greninja.</p> <p>The final moveslot depends heavily on what you need Greninja to cover for your team. Low Kick rounds out the set well, doing at least 79% to minimum HP Mega Kangaskhan. It also allows Greninja to OHKO Tyranitar and Bisharp and 2HKO specially defensive Ferrothorn. If you're more worried about Suicune, Grass Knot is an effective way to stop it from setting up, with Grass Knot even having a chance to 2HKO Suicune after it has used Calm Mind once. As a bonus, it will also still 2HKO Tyranitar. Grass Knot does laughable damage to the lightweight Rotom-W, though, so if you care to do more damage to Rotom-W, you can use Hidden Power Grass at the cost of being able to beat Suicune. Water Shuriken might seem like a strange choice, as Greninja is already extremely fast. However, it allows Greninja to snipe Blaziken and Talonflame when they are around half their health (which is especially useful because it means Talonflame will be OHKOed after Stealth Rock damage). Water Shuriken will also prevent Pokemon with Fighting-type priority from OHKOing Greninja before it does anything, allowing Greninja to deal some damage before it gets KOed. If your team needs some extra firepower, consider Hydro Pump. Hydro Pump is Greninja's most powerful weapon, OHKOing Heatran and dealing over 70% to the troublesome Mega Mawile, which Greninja will lose to otherwise. If you're paranoid about Hydro Pump's accuracy and don't mind missing out on the OHKO on Heatran, Surf can be used as a reliable move to 2HKO Mega Mawile, while Scald is slightly less powerful in exchange for a burn rate.</p> <p>If you want a move that can hit both Mega Mawile and Ferrothorn, Hidden Power Fire is also a good option, doing the most to Mega Mawile out of Greninja's tools and OHKOing Scizor and physically defensive Ferrothorn. If Mega Venusaur is a huge problem for your team, Extrasensory can be used to 2HKO it while protecting Greninja from Fighting-type priority. Finally, while U-turn doesn't offer any compelling coverage, it can allow Greninja to be more useful early in the game by giving Greninja the ability to scout the Pokemon your opponent has chosen and perform well against some leads such as Focus Sash Garchomp. One final thing to note about Greninja's complicated move choices: if your team can adequately handle Azumarill, you can elect to replace Gunk Shot with any of the moves listed above.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Greninja should always run maximum Speed to avoid KOs. Additionally, this Greninja should not be leaving the dojo without a Life Orb, because the extra power is necessary to vanquish many foes in the Battle Spot Singles battlefield. With a Naive nature and 20 Attack EVs, Greninja OHKOes Azumarill with Gunk Shot, and the rest of the 236 EVs go into Special Attack for maximum revenge killing power. If for any reason you decide to make your Greninja a full special attacker, run a Timid nature with maximum Special Attack.</p> <p>If you plan on running Hidden Power Fire, use an EV spread of 20 Atk / 240 SpA / 248 Spe, because due to Pokemon being level 50 in this metagame, any extra EVs in Special Attack and Speed would be a waste when the Pokemon is forced to have an IV of 30. Finally, an interesting option to consider is to hone Greninja's martial arts skill by running maximum Attack EVs. This gives the ninja frog a 93% chance to OHKO minimum HP Mega Kangaskhan with Low Kick and a guaranteed OHKO on maximum HP Heatran. Ice Beam will still KO all the targets 4x weak to it, but unfortunately, Dark Pulse will lose the guaranteed 2HKO on Cresselia and the OHKO on Mega Gengar and Mega Slowbro.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It's best to keep Greninja hidden in the shadows early in the game; Greninja's defenses leave it OHKOed by many of Battle Spot Singles's powerful offensive Pokemon. Getting Greninja in after a KO is usually the best way for it to enter the battle, and letting Greninja take the stage later in the game when your opponent's team is weary from battle can lead to a clean sweep.</p> <p>If using Greninja earlier in the game, try to get it in on something it can easily scare out and revenge kill. Pokemon that are weak to Ice such as Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Zapdos are great candidates for Greninja's assaults. It might seem like a good idea to use Greninja early in the game, but think carefully before you do this: Greninja can't handle any leads that run Focus Sash or powerful priority moves. If using U-turn, Greninja can handle the lead position more comfortably by U-turning slower Focus Sash Pokemon that lack priority, such as Garchomp.</p> <p>Finally, because Greninja's mere presence can force switches, you can employ the high-risk, high-reward tactic of double switching, which can give your team an edge against defensive switch-ins such as Porygon2 and Suicune.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>The greatest support Greninja's comrades can give it is residual damage. Wearing down the opponent's team can transform Greninja from a simple revenge killer to a terrifying cleaner. The easiest way to support Greninja is to use Pokemon wearing a Rocky Helmet or ones with a contact-damaging ability. Pokemon such as Garchomp, Cresselia, and Zapdos work well here. A big bonus is that Mega Kangaskhan will fall to Greninja after only one round of Rocky Helmet damage.</p> <p>Greninja also appreciates sandstorm support from Tyranitar and Hippowdon. Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar share an unfortunate Mach Punch weaknesses with Greninja, but they can effectively switch into Talonflame and also set up on Porygon2 with Taunt and Dragon Dance. Hippowdon, on the other hand, can defeat troublesome, physically based revenge killers such as Blaziken and Choice Scarf Garchomp. Just note that Sand Stream support is a double-edged katana, as Life Orb and sandstorm damage can wear Greninja down to the KO range of priority attacks. The final form of residual damage support is Stealth Rock, which, while difficult to set up, can be especially effective with Greninja, as Stealth Rock puts Talonflame into the KO range of Water Shuriken.</p> <p>There are some troublesome foes that must be taken into account when hiring Greninja for your team. Porygon2 is near the top of the list, as it is able to effortlessly wall Greninja and either blast the ninja with Tri Attack or destroy its Speed with Thunder Wave. If Greninja isn't running the right moves for it, Mega Mawile will become a terrifying force to face, while Mega Venusaur can use Greninja as an opportunity to stall with Leech Seed. Finally, fast Fighting-type attacks and Talonflame can bypass Greninja's Speed and assassinate it. Mega Gengar is an excellent response to many of Greninja's problems. Mega Gengar haunts Greninja's defensive threats with Shadow Tag, can switch into Fighting-type attacks, and in general can take out fast offensive Pokemon with Destiny Bond. Talonflame also works well, being able to destroy most Fighting-types and Mega Venusaur, and it can also revenge kill Mega Mawile as long as Mega Mawile hasn't used Swords Dance. Other offensive Flying-types such as Mega Salamence also work well against Mega Venusaur and Fighting-type Pokemon. Finally, offensive Fire-types can work well against the troublesome Mega Mawile. Heatran in particular deserves special mention for its ability to handle Talonflame, and it is even able to use Toxic to defeat defensive Porygon2.</p> <p>One final piece of support worth mentioning is U-turn and Volt Switch. Because Greninja often has trouble switching in, using these moves can let Greninja take the stage. Great Pokemon to consider for this role include Landorus-T, Scizor, Rotom-W, Mega Manectric, and Rotom-H.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Beam, while not very strong, still gives Greninja enough firepower to assassinate Garchomp, Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, and Gliscor. Dark Pulse is even weaker, but it's the only way Greninja will be 2HKOing Aegislash and maximum HP Mega Gengar. Just note that, unfortunately, Cresselia avoids the 2HKO from Dark Pulse. Thankfully, Hydro Pump gives Greninja some much-needed power, letting it OHKO Talonflame and 2HKO Mega Mawile and Heatran. The last slot depends on your team structure and what threats you feel are more important for Greninja's mission. Grass Knot 2HKOes Suicune and Tyranitar, preventing them from setting up, and protects Greninja from Breloom's Spore and Mach Punch if it attempts to revenge kill Greninja. Extrasensory 2HKOes Mega Venusaur and Assault Vest Conkeldurr and protects Greninja from Fighting-type priority. Hidden Power Fire allows Greninja to 2HKO Ferrothorn, and it does more to Mega Mawile than Hydro Pump does. If none of these options sound like a fit for your team, consider Gunk Shot. While Gunk Shot won't OHKO Azumarill, it still does more damage than any of Greninja's other moves and is guaranteed to KO Azumarill after Belly Drum and Sitrus Berry. Low Kick is also an option if your team despises Tyranitar, nabbing an OHKO before it can set up Dragon Dance.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment is the way to go, because Greninja needs as much power as possible to make the best use of Focus Sash. If your team desperately needs an emergency Belly Drum Azumarill check, running Naive with Gunk Shot is needed to defeat Azumarill after a Belly Drum. If running Hidden Power Fire, run 12 HP / 248 SpA / 248 Spe for pure special sets and 12 Atk / 248 SpA / 248 Spe for mixed attacking sets. Because Pokemon in Battle Spot Singles are level 50, running 252 SpA or Spe when using an IV of 30 in both won't give Greninja any extra stat points.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The simplest way to use this Greninja is to lead with it. Greninja has a favorable matchup against prominent Pokemon such as Garchomp and Mega Salamence, and thanks to the Focus Sash, Greninja is less vulnerable to surprise Focus Sash and Choice Scarf users. In the case of Choice Scarf users, Focus Sash Greninja is an excellent scout of them, meaning it can provide your team with valuable information without getting KOed in the process. Keeping Focus Sash Greninja in the shadows for the late-game still has plenty of value, though. Focus Sash allows Greninja to get surprise KOs on sweepers such as Mega Salamence and Talonflame, which can be game-winning events if played well. It also saves Greninja from bad matchups against leads such as Breloom, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Lopunny. If you plan on taking advantage of Focus Sash's surprise value, being reckless with switching Greninja in is usually not a good plan unless you need to make an emergency switch in. One last factor that is important to note is that Focus Sash Greninja is rather weak compared to the more common Life Orb variant, so don't expect Greninja to sweep through teams as well as usual.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>The most important support options Focus Sash Greninja can get are ways to deal with multi-hit Pokemon and Fake Out. This is especially true in the case of Mega Kangaskhan, Breloom, and Mega Lopunny, which are frequently seen as leads. Fast Fighting-types such as Blaziken and Choice Scarf Heracross can scare off Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Lopunny, while Rocky Helmet Cresselia and Zapdos are more reliable switch-ins to them. Breloom can be trickier to deal with because of Spore, but packing leads that match up favorably against Breloom such as Mega Kangaskhan and Lum Berry Garchomp is usually enough. If your team is especially scared of Spore, consider Mega Venusaur and Mandibuzz, which are immune to Spore. Another issue Greninja faces is Sand Stream from Hippowdon and Tyranitar. While neither of these Pokemon has a good matchup against Greninja, the sandstorm damage will ruin Greninja's Focus Sash. The only guaranteed way to deal with this is using Mega Charizard Y or Politoed to make the weather less hostile. Otherwise, consider benching Focus Sash Greninja if you see Tyranitar or Hippowdon. While Focus Sash Greninja is hired for a suicide mission, it still appreciates U-turn and Volt Switch support to ensure a safe passage to the battlefield. Landorus-T, Scizor, Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H are great partners for this job.</p>"

  "Gardevoir": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Gardevoir is a dangerous wallbreaker in Battle Spot Singles, capable of threatening most switch-ins with powerful Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voices. Its Psychic typing sets it apart from other Fairy-types such as Sylveon, preventing it from being a safe switch-in for Poison-types like Gengar and Mega Venusaur that struggle to survive STAB Psyshock. A useful ability in Trace also allows it to copy more useful abilities such as Speed Boost and Intimidate before Mega Evolving, which it can then use against the foe. Beyond functioning as a wallbreaker as a Mega Evolution, Gardevoir can also run a Choice Scarf set to function as a revenge killer with moderate surprise factor, as most opponents will expect a Gardevoir to Mega Evolve.</p> <p>Gardevoir is somewhat reliant on speed control such as paralysis support, since base 100 is a risky Speed tier for such a physically frail Mega Evolution. This makes it easy to revenge kill Gardevoir with priority or just fast physical attackers. Speed tying with Mega Kangaskhan and being outsped by Garchomp also make it difficult for Mega Gardevoir to threaten some of the most common Pokemon even though few things can switch into Pixilate Hyper Voice. As a Mega Evolution, it relies more on team support than the likes of Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Blaziken to be successful, while Sylveon gives it competition as a special Fairy-type without requiring a Mega Stone.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Psychic is an alternative to Psyshock on Mega Gardevoir; while Psyshock covers Chansey, Psychic allows Gardevoir to hit physically defensive Mega Venusaur harder and is slightly stronger than Psyshock. Substitute is also an option on Mega Gardevoir that can punish switches and give it a buffer against status while also letting it safely take on faster threats such as Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Will-O-Wisp can be used to catch physical attackers off guard and helps mitigate Gardevoir's issues with taking physical attacks, though this works best on switches and most physical attackers that beat Gardevoir are not likely to risk switching into Hyper Voice. Similarly, Thunder Wave lets Gardevoir paralyze switch-ins on its own to beat otherwise faster threats, though most threats that can switch into Gardevoir still win even after being paralyzed. Encore allows Mega Gardevoir to punish slower foes attempting to set up as it switches in, which can create a free turn for it to fire off a powerful Hyper Voice. Calm Mind alongside Taunt lets Mega Gardevoir set up and sweep on its own, though base 100 Speed isn't conducive to sweeping with something as physically frail as Mega Gardevoir. Shadow Sneak is an unusual option that can be used to pick off a foe relying on its Focus Sash to beat Mega Gardevoir, but it has no other realistic use and it's difficult to justify a moveslot just for this. Healing Wish is an option on the Choice Scarf set to give a teammate a second chance to wallbreak after being weakened, but Lunar Dance Cresselia usually outclasses this. Memento is another option to create an easy setup opportunity for a teammate, but Gardevoir is usually better off bring something down with it, so Destiny Bond tends to be better.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Priority Users: Gardevoir is very physically frail and vulnerable to most forms of priority, so priority moves from Talonflame, Scizor, Dragonite, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Mawile all deal with Gardevoir. Using priority moves also reduces the risk of being picked off by a surprise Choice Scarf Gardevoir and can KO Gardevoir before it can attempt to use Destiny Bond.</p> <p><strong>Faster Physical Attackers: While Mega Gardevoir threatens many Pokemon with Hyper Voice, its Speed tier leaves it outsped by important threats such as Garchomp and Mega Salamence. It also Speed ties with Mega Kangaskhan at best and usually can't keep up with Blaziken even if it Traces Speed Boost, usually leaving Gardevoir outsped and OHKOed due to its poor physical bulk.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Ghost-types that don't mind Hyper Voice, such as Gengar and Aegislash, give Gardevoir trouble, since it's outsped by the former and walled by the latter. Aegislash also has Shadow Sneak to pick it off without taking extra damage and can get a Weakness Policy boost from Hidden Power variants. Gengar must still be wary of Choice Scarf Gardevoir if it lacks Focus Sash, since it's weak to Psyshock.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Mega Gardevoir often runs coverage for Steel-types, but it usually can't cover everything at once. Mega Lucario outspeeds Mega Gardevoir and can threaten to OHKO it with either Bullet Punch or Flash Cannon, although it can't switch into Hyper Voice. Scizor only fears switching into Hidden Power Fire and otherwise threatens Gardevoir with Bullet Punch. Ferrothorn also wins against variants lacking Hidden Power Fire and usually survives one Focus Blast regardless. Heatran also beats variants lacking Hidden Power Ground or Focus Blast.</p>",

        "name": "Mega Wallbreaker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyper Voice is boosted by Pixilate and functions as Mega Gardevoir's primary Fairy-type STAB move. It also hits a foe behind a Substitute, which is useful against the likes of Whimsicott and Gyarados. Psyshock hits Poison-types such as Gengar and also gives Mega Gardevoir an STAB move to use against Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona and hits Chansey through its weaker Defense. Taunt is useful for preventing status moves from the likes of Chansey and Cresselia and also prevents Calm Mind users such as Suicune and Raikou from setting up so that Mega Gardevoir can beat them more easily. Tracing Prankster also allows Gardevoir to Taunt Klefki before it can use Thunder Wave. Focus Blast hits Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn, which otherwise wall Mega Gardevoir completely. Hidden Power Fire lets Mega Gardevoir beat both Ferrothorn and Scizor, though Scizor can OHKO Mega Gardevoir with Bullet Punch, so this is best used as it switches in. Hidden Power Ground is an alternative that hits Heatran without the risk of missing like Focus Blast but misses out on hitting Ferrothorn and doesn't do as much damage to other Steel-types. If Taunt's utility isn't necessary, running both Focus Blast and Hidden Power is viable as well, letting Mega Gardevoir cover Steel-types more thoroughly.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Gardevoirite is necessary to Mega Evolve, which is important for allowing Gardevoir to make use of Pixilate Hyper Voice. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Mega Gardevoir to hit as fast and hard as possible. Trace lets Gardevoir copy a more useful ability to use against the foe before it Mega Evolves, such as Intimidate, Prankster, Speed Boost, or Volt Absorb. A Modest nature is preferred to boost Mega Gardevoir's huge Special Attack further and is ideally used with paralysis support from the likes of Thundurus and Serperior. Alternatively, Timid allows Mega Gardevoir to Speed tie with the numerous Pokemon in the base 100 Speed tier such as Mega Kangaskhan and both Mega Charizard formes. It also allows Gardevoir to outspeed Breloom before Mega Evolving. If you're running Hidden Power Ground, 4 EVs should be moved from Special Attack to Defense to avoid wasting EVs. Likewise, an EV spread of 4 HP / 4 Def / 248 SpA / 4 SpD / 248 Spe should be used with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Gardevoir is a wallbreaker, so it should be primarily used against slower, bulkier teams; switching into Mega Gardevoir is difficult, so capitalizing on Hyper Voice's power is important. An opponent is generally more likely to bring a Steel-type just to have a switch-in for Mega Gardevoir, so bringing teammates that handle the likes of Aegislash and Heatran helps to take advantage of how threatening Pixilate Hyper Voice is for most foes. Mega Gardevoir works well early-game to weaken bulky threats such as Slowbro and Suicune for a sweeper like Talonflame or Garchomp. It's best to bring Mega Gardevoir in on a foe that can't threaten it much, such as a Garchomp or Dragonite locked into Outrage or a more passive threat such as Rotom-W or Slowbro. This is especially useful because it often creates a free turn to hit a potential switch-in with a powerful Hyper Voice. Mega Gardevoir also works well late-game against weakened teams, though it needs support to handle faster threats, since it does not fare well against faster physical attackers. Physical priority is also a huge problem for Mega Gardevoir, so it's usually better not to bring Gardevoir along against teams with many powerful priority users such as Talonflame and Scizor.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gardevoir greatly appreciates paralysis support, so Zapdos, Ferrothorn, Thundurus, Serperior, and Rotom-W are effective partners. Serperior in particular can paralyze Garchomp and Landorus-T with Glare, which both otherwise threaten Mega Gardevoir. Meanwhile, Zapdos, Thundurus, and Rotom-W can handle Talonflame, with the former having Heat Wave to hit Steel-types as well. Ferrothorn can also offer Stealth Rock support to help break through bulkier threats more effectively. Partners that can beat Scizor such as Heatran and Aegislash are useful for Mega Gardevoir. Both have generally great matchups against opposing Steel-types as well, which reduces the need for Mega Gardevoir to rely on its own coverage moves to beat them. Late-game sweepers and cleaners appreciate Mega Gardevoir's ability to break down bulkier teams; Talonflame and Choice Scarf Garchomp are effective cleaners alongside Mega Gardevoir, and they also make up for Gardevoir's lack of Speed.</p> <p>Intimidate Pokemon such as Gyarados and Landorus-T help Gardevoir take physical attacks better and can also chip away at Mega Kangaskhan with Rocky Helmet. They also fare well against most priority users. Similarly, Suicune can take on most physical attackers that threaten Mega Gardevoir and checks Talonflame while being able to patch up Mega Gardevoir's vulnerability to physical attacks with Scald burns or even Reflect. Blaziken is also an effective teammate for Mega Gardevoir, potentially functioning as a secondary Mega option due to its ability to beat Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Gengar more reliably. Alternatively, Life Orb Blaziken can also deal with Aegislash well with Overheat, while Baton Pass variants can give Mega Gardevoir the Speed to sweep on its own.</p>"

      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Moonblast is Gardevoir's primary STAB move, hitting Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Hydreigon. This is generally the safest move to lock into due to its superior coverage over Psyshock and its decent chance to lower the Special Attack of a possible switch-in. Psyshock is a secondary STAB move that allows Gardevoir to revenge kill Poison-types such as Gengar and Mega Venusaur, though Moonblast is better against most Fighting-types due to its greater coverage and ability to hit Dark-types. Choice Scarf Gardevoir doesn't wallbreak, so Psychic is a viable alternative that hits physically defensive threats like defensive Mega Venusaur and Rotom-W harder. Trick allows Gardevoir to be useful against bulkier threats if it doesn't need its Choice Scarf anymore, crippling the likes of Cresselia and Ferrothorn, as well as Klefki after Tracing Prankster. Destiny Bond allows Gardevoir to take down a threat with it if the ability to revenge kill Dragon-types and the surprise factor of Choice Scarf are no longer useful. Choice Scarf Gardevoir often finds itself unable to beat Pokemon that aren't weak to its STAB moves, so Destiny Bond allows it to take down a threat that it wouldn't beat otherwise.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf allows Gardevoir to function as a revenge killer and offers notable surprise factor due to most opponents expecting Mega Gardevoir. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Gardevoir to hit as hard as possible while outspeeding as many threats as possible with a Choice Scarf. Trace allows Gardevoir to copy a more useful ability and use it against the foe, such as Speed Boost or Levitate, which makes it more difficult to revenge kill. A Timid nature allows Gardevoir to outspeed Modest Choice Scarf Rotom-W and Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T as well as the occasional Mega Lopunny and Mega Sceptile to revenge kill them with Moonblast. It also allows Gardevoir to keep up with Life Orb Blaziken if it Traces Speed Boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As a dedicated revenge killer, Gardevoir should primarily come in as after a partner has been KOed. However, bringing Gardevoir in against a faster threat such as Garchomp or Salamence might make the opponent suspect it is holding Choice Scarf, so try to avoid making that too obvious. While not always ideal, leading with Choice Scarf Gardevoir is effective at catching an opponent off-guard, since they are less likely to suspect the Choice Scarf. Do note that this is dependent on the opponent's lead being favorable for Gardevoir, so avoid doing so unless Gardevoir has a generally favorable matchup against the opposing team. Trick should only be used against bulky Pokemon that Gardevoir can't break on its own, but Choice Scarf Gardevoir generally should not be brought against very bulky teams, since it struggles to win against most bulky threats even once it Tricks its Choice Scarf away. Destiny Bond makes Gardevoir useful even against teams that aren't weak to its STAB moves, so Gardevoir can still be useful even if its STAB combination isn't very helpful. However, sacrificing Gardevoir too early can put you at a disadvantage if the revenge killing utility is still useful, so Destiny Bond should not be used recklessly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Gardevoir is primarily used to support teams, so it's more important that the team appreciates Gardevoir's utility than it appreciates the utility that its teammates offer. This Gardevoir fits primarily on offensive teams, so it should be paired with wallbreakers and sweepers such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Kangaskhan, and Blaziken. Blaziken in particular can deal with opposing Mega Mawile and Mega Kangaskhan, both of which have priority moves to pick off Gardevoir that Blaziken resists. Pokemon that are troubled by Dragon-types such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y also appreciate Gardevoir's ability to surprise Garchomp and Mega Salamence.</p> <p>Priority users are a huge problem for Gardevoir, since they hit its weaker Defense, which makes its job as a revenge killer more difficult. Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Heatran deal with Talonflame and Scizor, while Ghost-types such as Aegislash can deal with Extreme Speed users. Zapdos can also deal with Azumarill and can wear foes down with Rocky Helmet. Suicune can generally switch into most priority users safely and can wear down physical attackers to help Gardevoir clean late-game. Stealth Rock support is also useful for letting Gardevoir clean a weakened team late-game, so Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Garchomp are effective partners that can also wear teams down with Rocky Helmet.</p>"

  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnezone is a powerful special attacker in Battle Spot Singles, boasting the typing and power to function as an effective wallbreaker. Its Electric / Steel typing allows it to check bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Rotom-W and gives it a secondary STAB that allows it to threaten Ground-types such as Garchomp and Landorus-T without the need for Hidden Power Ice. This typing also lets it Magnezone check Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Gardevoir while giving it numerous resistances, making it easier for Magnezone to find opportunities to switch in. Analytic helps Magnezone capitalize on switches as well, allowing it to maintain momentum for its team while exerting great offensive pressure. Access to Sturdy allows Magnezone to function as a revenge killer without requiring a Focus Sash, despite its low Speed, and the immunity to OHKO moves also makes it one of few Moody Glalie checks that don't fear Sheer Cold. However, Magnezone's low Speed makes it easy to wear down, since it will often be attacking after the foe, making it prone to being revenge killed. While few Pokemon can safely switch into Magnezone, its typing also leaves it weak to common threats such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Blaziken, Mamoswine, and Talonflame. Magnezone's movepool is also very shallow with few options outside of STAB moves and Hidden Power, so it has difficulty breaking through threats such as Swampert and Rotom-H that typically don't mind Magnezone's moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Other Hidden Power types can be used to hit specific threats if Fire- or Ice-type coverage isn't necessary, such as Hidden Power Ground for Heatran and Hidden Power Grass for Swampert. However, they're often less useful than Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ice and should only be considered on teams that struggle with these threats. Substitute can take advantage of the many switches that Magnezone forces, giving it protection against Pokemon such as Garchomp that otherwise outspeed and easily OHKO it. Magnezone can use a Custap Berry with Sturdy in order to surprise foes with one last hit before it goes down, possibly getting a KO in the process. Thunder Wave is another option with Custap Berry as a last resort to help a teammate deal with a faster threat, though emergency paralysis is usually done better by Thundurus.</p> <p>Mirror Coat in combination with Sturdy can surprise special attackers that otherwise beat Magnezone, such as Volcarona, Heatran, and Hydreigon. A more bulky approach with Assault Vest is also viable so that Magnezone isn't taking too much damage in the process. However, Mirror Coat is somewhat reliant on its surprise factor to be useful, and Magnezone has trouble giving up any of its moves for it. Magnet Pull is Magnezone's least useful ability, since trapping Steel-types doesn't provide as much utility as Analytic or Sturdy, but the ability to trap Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory can be useful on teams that struggle with them. Choice Scarf can be used to function as a revenge killer, though this gives up a lot of Magnezone's power, since it makes less effective use of Analytic. Choice Scarf Magnezone with a Timid nature can outspeed everything up to positive-natured base 115 Pokemon, which include Adamant Talonflame. Air Balloon is situational, though being able to avoid damage from a Ground-type move can force Garchomp or Landorus-T to switch out or hit Magnezone with a resisted move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-type Moves: Magnezone's 4x weakness to Ground-type moves makes Ground-types such as Garchomp, Hippowdon, Swampert, and Landorus-T effective answers to it. Hydreigon also commonly runs Earth Power and resists Electric-type moves, while offensive Porygon2 occasionally runs Hidden Power Ground and can handle any of Magnezone's moves.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Blaziken, Volcarona, Heatran, Talonflame, and Rotom-H resist Flash Cannon and outspeed Magnezone, OHKOing it with their respective Fire-type moves. Specially defensive Heatran in particular can shrug off most attacks from Magnezone, while Magma Storm variants can also mess with Sturdy. Rotom-H resists Electric-type moves as well, so Sturdy variants don't give it any trouble unless Magnezone runs Mirror Coat. However, Blaziken and Talonflame must be especially wary of Sturdy, since they both risk being KOed by Magnezone.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Move Users: While most Fighting-types can't switch into Magnezone directly, they can all threaten to OHKO Magnezone with their respective STAB moves. Mega Lucario, Mega Lopunny, Mega Heracross, and Breloom are all options that outspeed and OHKO Magnezone. Conkeldurr is outsped by Magnezone, though it often runs Assault Vest to handle special attacks and can still beat Sturdy Magnezone with Mach Punch. Low Kick Greninja can also take down Magnezone, and Focus Blast users such as Thundurus and Gengar beat Choice Specs variants.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Magnezone has no way to deal with Chansey or Blissey, which can easily heal any damage Magnezone does while slowly bringing it down with Seismic Toss. Specially defensive Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn can also deal with Magnezone, though the latter must wary of Hidden Power Fire.</p>",

Flash Cannon gives Magnezone a secondary STAB attack that allows it to threaten Ground-types that could otherwise safely switch into Magnezone while also hitting Fairy-types harder. Volt Switch provides momentum and gives Magnezone the ability to function as a pivot, and due to its low Speed, it can be used to bring in a teammate safely. Hidden Power Ice gives Magnezone a better way to hit Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Landorus-T on the switch, though it relies greatly on prediction or Sturdy, since they can all threaten to OHKO Magnezone with Earthquake. Hidden Power Fire is an alternative on teams that want a reliable answer to Ferrothorn and Scizor, and it is Magnezone's only way of hitting the former, while Hidden Power Ice isn't necessary to hit anything that its STAB moves can't.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Specs allows Magnezone to function as a wallbreaker, dealing huge damage to anything that doesn't resist its STAB combination. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Modest nature allows Magnezone to hit as hard as possible and outspeed Bold Suicune and fast Azumarill, while the leftover EVs are placed in HP. Magnezone can move all Speed investment into HP, since it often won't outspeed offensive threats anyway, though doing so puts Magnezone at risk of being outsped by a fast Azumarill. If you're running Hidden Power Fire, this can also allow Scizor to outspeed and KO Magnezone with Superpower. An alternative EV spread of 4 HP / 4 Def / 248 SpA / 4 SpD / 248 Spe should also be used with Hidden Power Fire to avoid wasting EVs.</p> <p>Analytic is the preferred ability to boost Magnezone's power, since it will often move after the foe, and also allows it to effectively punish switches. However, Sturdy can let Magnezone function as an emergency check to a wider variety of threats such as Talonflame and Low Kick Greninja, which otherwise beat it. Sturdy is also the preferred ability with Hidden Power Ice in order to effectively lure Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence and eliminate them.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Magnezone is best used early-game to break through bulkier Pokemon such as Cresselia, Suicune, and Rotom-W with its powerful STAB moves. Magnezone is particularly effective as a lead against teams that lack Ground-types or Thundurus-T, since this makes it easier for Magnezone to Volt Switch out and capitalize further on switches with Analytic. Common Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Swampert are popular leads, though, so be careful leading Magnezone if you see one of them at Team Preview. If running Sturdy and Hidden Power Ice, Magnezone can surprise the former two, though otherwise consider leading something other than Magnezone or even benching it. Magnezone is difficult to switch into for many teams, though after it locks into a move, the opponent can more easily take advantage of it. Recognizing when it's safer to simply use Volt Switch or switch out directly is important, since both of its STAB moves lure in many dangerous threats once it locks into a move.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Magnezone is commonly paired with Dragon-types such as Mega Salamence and Garchomp, since it can safely switch into Fairy-types and Ice-type moves. Mega Salamence in particular appreciates a teammate that can handle Thundurus, while Magnezone appreciates Mega Salamence's ability to switch into Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type moves. Cresselia also pairs well with Magnezone thanks to its ability to switch into Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp that beat Magnezone and threaten them with Ice Beam. Sturdy variants also benefit from Lunar Dance to bring Magnezone's HP back up if Sturdy is broken at any point. Azumarill also threatens Ground-, Fire-, and Fighting-types that trouble Magnezone, while Magnezone can reliably switch into Electric-, Poison-, and Grass-type moves for Azumarill. Gengar can switch into Ground- and Fighting-type moves aimed at Magnezone, while Magnezone handles Psychic-type moves aimed at Gengar. Mega Gengar can also trap and remove special walls that Magnezone can't beat, such as Chansey, though Mega Evolving also removes Gengar's ability to switch into Ground-type moves. Physical attackers such as Blaziken and Mega Kangaskhan benefit from Magnezone's ability to safely deal with physical walls such as Cresselia and Suicune, and they also appreciate having a slow Volt Switch user to bring them in safely. Magnezone also pairs well with common U-turn users, notably Landorus-T for its ability to switch into Ground-type moves and threaten Fire-types. Magnezone's ability to threaten bulky Water-types and switch into Ice-type moves helps Landorus-T as well.</p>"

        "name": "Assault Vest",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is Magnezone's strongest reliable STAB move, providing great coverage and consistent power. Flash Cannon functions as a secondary STAB move to deal with Fairy-types and hits Ground-types that otherwise can freely switch into Magnezone. Volt Switch allows Magnezone to pivot and maintain momentum for its team, and due to its low Speed, it will often move after the foe, which can help it bring in a teammate safely. Hidden Power Fire hits Ferrothorn and Scizor, which is useful on teams that struggle with them, though Hidden Power Ice is an alternative option that hits Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence harder.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Assault Vest allows Magnezone to function as a bulky pivot, checking special attackers such as Mega Gardevoir and Rotom-W more effectively. The given EVs guarantee that Life Orb Thundurus will never KO with a combination of Thunderbolt and Focus Blast, allowing Magnezone to more safely deal with offensive Thundurus variants. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Attack, and a Modest nature is used to boost Magnezone's damage output further. Analytic allows Magnezone to take advantage of its low Speed and punish switches, letting it pivot in and out with Volt Switch while still dealing a lot of damage. While Assault Vest already helps Magnezone's special bulk, Sturdy is still useful for letting Magnezone survive physical attacks such as Earthquake and retaliate with an attack of its own.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Assault Vest Magnezone is a bulky pivot, so it should be used to switch into special attackers such as Thundurus and Sylveon thanks to its increased Special Defense. Magnezone needs to stay healthy to check Focus Blast Thundurus, so if this is something that Magnezone's team is weak to, try to avoid letting Magnezone take any damage. Magnezone can also only survive one Focus Blast, so be careful if you think Thundurus might use Focus Blast as Magnezone switches in. Magnezone often forces switches due to its high power, so using Volt Switch is often very safe if the opponent lacks any Ground-types or Thundurus-T. However, Assault Vest Magnezone doesn't lose as much momentum as Choice Specs variants if it doesn't use Volt Switch, so using another move is often not too risky. Bluffing Choice Specs is also an effective approach that can allow Magnezone to surprise foes that think it's locked into a move; for example, using Hidden Power Fire on Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dragon-types such as Mega Salamence, Garchomp, and Dragonite appreciate Magnezone's ability to safely switch into Fairy-types and common Ice Beam users, and they all greatly benefit from having a teammate capable of checking Thundurus with ease. Magnezone also offers the utility of a slow Volt Switch and appreciates Mega Salamence's ability to cover Magnezone's weaknesses to threats such as Mega Blaziken, Mega Heracross, and Volcarona. Levitate Pokemon such as Gengar and Latios cover Magnezone's Ground-type weakness, while Magnezone can reliably switch into most of the types that trouble them, notably Psychic- and Fairy-type moves, respectively. Both Gengar and Latios can also check Fighting-types for Magnezone, while Mega Gengar in particular can also trap and eliminate special walls that completely stop Magnezone, such as Chansey, at the cost of Levitate. Fire-types such as Blaziken appreciate Magnezone's ability to switch into bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Rotom-W, though this compounds a Ground-type weakness and Magnezone can't reliably beat common Flying-types such as Talonflame and Mega Salamence without Sturdy. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Slowbro are effective partners that can check Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon that Magnezone usually doesn't want to deal with, while Magnezone can handle Electric-types like Thundurus and Grass-types such as Serperior. Landorus-T can form a VoltTurn core with Magnezone thanks to its ability to switch into Ground-types that Magnezone has trouble with while also providing Intimidate support to help Magnezone take physical hits better. Meanwhile, Magnezone deals with Suicune and Rotom-W for Landorus-T and shrugs off Ice Beam from the likes of Cresselia.</p>"

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatran is a very versatile Pokemon, being able to fill defensive, offensive, and supportive roles on a team. It particularly excels at stallbreaking thanks to its immunity to Toxic and its signature move Magma Storm. Additionally, its stats and unique typing are great defensively and mean that it often completely walls foes that can't deal super effective damage to it. This makes it an excellent check to common foes such as Talonflame and Cresselia, which are almost entirely unable to touch it. Its high Special Attack stat and access to Flash Fire also mean it can deal a lot of damage, even with neutral attacks. Its middling Speed stat does mean that it's often outsped by other Pokemon, however, and it isn't quite slow enough to take advantage of Trick Room. Finally, while Heatran is great defensively, it's weak to Ground, Water, and Fighting, types that are all common as STAB moves and as coverage. This means that ordinarily lopsided match-ups, such as against Charizard and Scizor, can be a risky proposition when Focus Blast and Superpower, respectively, are considered.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>More offensive sets, in particular, have the most other options. Fire Blast is an alternative Fire-type STAB move that trades Flamethrower's accuracy for a greater damage output. Hidden Power Ice deals significant damage to common Earthquake users and Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Landorus-T, although Heatran is still outsped by these. Dragon Pulse similarly deals with Dragon-types like Garchomp and Mega Salamence but has the benefit over Hidden Power Ice of dealing more damage to Hydreigon, Latios, and Latias. Dark Pulse provides an alternative option for foes like Cresselia and has a handy chance to flinch the target. Stone Edge is an alternative to Ancient Power that generally deals more damage and is particularly useful against specially defensive Talonflame, but it is less accurate than Ancient Power. Using Taunt on the stall set can help to prevent foes from using non-attacking moves and is particularly useful for preventing recovery. Using a set with Stealth Rock and Air Balloon is viable if your team requires an entry hazard setter, but there are usually better options than Heatran. Choice Scarf can be a good answer to Heatran's Speed problem, particularly in combination with Hidden Power Ice, as this allows Heatran to outspeed threats such as Mega Salamence. Life Orb provides Heatran with more immediate firepower, but this wears it down quickly due to its lack of recovery. Assault Vest boosts Heatran's Special Defense, but preventing it from using support moves or a boosting item inhibits its usefulness.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types such as Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Landorus-T can easily KO Heatran as a result of its 4x weakness to Earthquake, even when burned if they're holding a boosting item like Life Orb. Lum Berry Garchomp has the easiest time against Heatran, as it is not concerned about being burned while switching in.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Blaziken, Conkeldurr, and Mega Lopunny can all KO Heatran with relative ease using their STAB moves. Conkeldurr is a particularly good check as a result of its Guts ability, which allows it to benefit from burn. Mega Lucario has an easy time KOing Heatran, although it has a hard time switching in safely. Additionally, Low Kick Greninja gains a STAB boost on the move as a result of Protean and can OHKO Heatran as a result, given enough Attack investment.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types such as Rotom-W, Azumarill, and Gyarados take little damage from Heatran's Fire-type attacks and are able to hit back with their super effective STAB moves. Politoed's Drizzle also creates problems for Heatran, as the rain halves the power of its Fire-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types like Hydreigon, Latios, and Latias resist Heatran's Fire-type attacks and commonly have coverage moves to hit Heatran super effectively, such as Earth Power and Surf. However, it should be noted that the former two have a chance to be 2HKOed by Choice Specs-boosted Flash Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan</strong>: Mega Kangaskhan has access to a variety of moves that can make it problematic for Heatran. Earthquake obviously deals a huge amount of damage to Heatran. Power-Up Punch can be used to negate the effects of burn, as can Facade after Kangaskhan has finished with Heatran. It can also use Substitute in order to block Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room: Heatran's middling Speed stat leaves it susceptible to Trick Room set by Pokemon such as Cresselia and Porygon2, as it allows foes that normally have a poorer match-up against it, such as Mega Heracross, to outspeed and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Utility: The Choice Specs set is shut down by Disable users such as Gengar, as the move forces Heatran to use Struggle or switch out. The stall set doesn't appreciate Encore users such as Gardevoir and Whimsicott, as its success is generally reliant on being able to switch moves.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Stall",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>The first move choice is between Heatran's STAB moves, both of which aim to deal residual damage. Magma Storm is generally preferred, as it deals a greater amount of damage and traps foes, although its accuracy is less than desirable at 75%. Lava Plume, on the other hand, has 100% accuracy and a chance to burn the foe, reducing Heatran's reliance on Will-O-Wisp. The second move aims to improve Heatran's stalling capabilities. Toxic has the higher damage potential, as the damage it deals increases over time; it's therefore most useful against foes with recovery like Porygon2 and Cresselia. Will-O-Wisp is guaranteed to burn the foe provided it hits, inflicting chip damage and importantly reducing the damage opposing physical attackers deal. The next options help Heatran to deal with foes that it would otherwise have trouble beating. Substitute prevents a number of non-damaging moves and, in combination with Leftovers, provides a safety net against super effective hits. However, Earth Power hits the majority of targets that resist Fire for good damage, such as Blaziken and opposing Heatran, reducing the chance that Heatran will be walled. Finally, Protect allows Heatran to safely stack up recovery from Leftovers and chip damage for a turn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>While Heatran has no choice in the matter, Flash Fire is an excellent ability that makes it immune to and lets it gain a boost from Fire-type attacks. This therefore makes it an excellent switch-in against opposing Fire-types. The given EVs grant a 16n+1 number of HP, which is optimized for both Leftovers and consecutive use of Substitute. A Timid nature and 252 Speed EVs allow Heatran to outspeed as many foes as possible. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to allow Heatran to take special attacks slightly better. Using a Calm nature and an EV spread such as 212 HP / 4 Def / 44 SpA / 156 SpD / 92 Spe is an alternative to take special hits better if outspeeding foes is less important. Leftovers is essential to provide a form of recovery, improving Heatran's stalling capabilities.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>While this set deals well with most Pokemon that can't hit it super effectively, it's best against defensive foes such as Cresselia and Porygon2. You generally won't want to lead with Heatran, and it should instead be kept in the back ready to be switched in. This can be done fairly liberally as a result of its excellent typing and defensive stats, but foes such as Volcarona that don't run Hidden Power Ground and Choice Specs Sylveon are prime targets to do so. The combination of Substitute and Protect can allow Heatran to stall out slower foes using moves with low PP, such as Hydro Pump Rotom-W. Protect also allows Heatran to safely scout for Trick Rotom-W to avoid getting itself Choice locked. Try to scout for super effective coverage on a foe's set before getting comfortable, such as against uncommon Earthquake users like Mega Charizard Y and Mega Sceptile. Protect and Substitute are great tools for helping with this, but be wary of a foe setting up on a Protect.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran wants teammates that can deal with foes it can't outstall, like those that resist Fire and/or hit it super effectively. Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Breloom do a good job at dealing with Water-types. Mega Venusaur also resists Fighting-type attacks, making it an especially good partner defensively. Serperior is another good partner, as it can set up on foes such as Hippowdon and Rotom-W, neither of which Heatran likes. Electric-types like Thundurus and Zapdos can also deal with Water-types and commonly carry Hidden Power Ice to help them deal with opposing Ground-types. Mega Kangaskhan struggles against defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia and Porygon2 and therefore appreciates Heatran's ability to switch into them and stall them out. In the best-case scenario, opposing Porygon2 can be baited into using Hidden Power Fire to active Heatran's Flash Fire. Garchomp enjoys Heatran's resistances to attacks such as Outrage and Ice Beam that threaten to eliminate it. Flying-types such as Mega Salamence, Landorus-T, and Gyarados are immune to Ground and resist Fighting, and Heatran has a 4x resistance to Ice for them in return. Partners with Levitate, such as Cresselia, Gengar, and Rotom-W, are also immune to Ground and have ways to deal with Mega Kangaskhan, which Heatran can struggle with. Heracross resists both Ground and Fighting, and Heatran makes a good partner for it thanks to Flash Fire. Using both Cresselia and Heracross together with Heatran creates a strong core that has excellent type synergy.</p>"
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Overheat is Heatran's strongest attack and can OHKO many foes with the boost from Choice Specs, including physically defensive Thundurus, Zapdos, and Hippowdon. The following two moves provide consistent STAB attacks for when lowering Heatran's Special Attack is undesirable. Flash Cannon provides an alternative STAB move and coverage against Fairy-types such as Sylveon. Flamethrower provides a Fire-type attack that doesn't lower Heatran's Special Attack and has a decent damage output combined with reliable accuracy. The final coverage options are used to reduce the chance that Heatran will be walled. Earth Power hits the majority of foes that resist both Fire- and Steel-type attacks super effectively, such as opposing Heatran. Ancient Power is a more effective option against foes like Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame. You may also opt to drop Flamethrower in exchange for running both Earth Power and Ancient Power in order to minimize the chance that Heatran will be walled.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Heatran's only ability, Flash Fire, is excellent for giving it an immunity to opposing Fire-type attacks and a means to further boost its own Fire-type attacks. Choice Specs and maximum Special Attack EVs make Heatran as immediately threatening as possible. The remaining EVs are placed mostly into HP to improve Heatran's overall bulk as much as possible. If you're looking to outpace more threats, EVs that trade bulk for Speed and potentially the use of a Timid nature can allow Heatran to do so. For example, 124 Speed EVs let Heatran outspeed base 60s, 204 EVs let it outspeed base 70s, and 252 EVs let it Speed tie with opposing maximum Speed Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set should be used on teams that need the greatest amount of firepower to get past bulky Steel-types like Aegislash. Flamethrower and Flash Cannon will be your staple move choices; use them until you're confident about making a prediction. Try to bait Fire-type attacks to activate Flash Fire, as this will boost the power of Heatran's Fire-type attacks even further. Avoid being Choice locked into Earth Power or Ancient Power if it can be helped, as this comes with the risk of hurting momentum. Equally bear in mind that Overheat's Special Attack drops can also have a negative effect on momentum. This set has no protection against potential super effective coverage, so be safe and scout for it when necessary.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cresselia is this set's best partner, as its access to Levitate and Ice Beam lets it check Ground-types easily. Its Lunar Dance can also provide a form of recovery, which Heatran otherwise lacks but finds desirable. Heracross resists both Fighting and Ground, can handle Water-types with Bullet Seed, and creates a strong core with Cresselia and Heatran, as Heatran resists every one of Heracross's weaknesses and helps beat foes like Aegislash for it, and Cresselia provides speed control for the other two, which are otherwise fairly slow. Garchomp can be useful to set up Stealth Rock, as it helps to eliminate Focus Sash users such as Breloom. Mega Salamence also makes a good partner, as it can switch in on Fighting- and Ground-types such as Blaziken and Choice-locked Earthquake users. Facade Mega Salamence can also deal with weakened bulky Water-types that threaten Heatran, such as Suicune, Rotom-W, and Slowbro. Mamoswine makes a great partner offensively, as it's able to threaten Ground-types and Dragon-types, particularly Garchomp and Mega Salamence, thanks to Icicle Spear. Mamoswine can also provide Stealth Rock support should it be needed for nullifying Focus Sashes and aiding in picking up KOs. Conkeldurr appreciates Heatran's ability to check Talonflame.</p> <p>Other Pokemon that have a hard time getting past Steel-types also enjoy this set's presence. Sylveon appreciates having Steel-types like Aegislash removed so that it can spam Hyper Voice freely. Mawile, while having some coverage against opposing Steel-types, likes Heatran's ability to KO them more efficiently. Ferrothorn can't touch Steel-types outside of Leech Seed and can switch into Water-type attacks for Heatran. It also makes excellent bait for activating Heatran's Flash Fire as a result of its 4x weakness to Fire. Breloom can do little to Steel-types other than Spore and resists both Ground and Water. Heatran can't beat opposing Water-types, so it appreciates support for that. Electric-types like Thundurus can power through them with their strong STAB moves. Grass-types like Mega Venusaur and Serperior resist Water and can hit back with their super effective STAB moves, with Mega Venusaur working especially well, as it resists Azumarill's Play Rough and takes less damage from Ice-type coverage moves thanks to Thick Fat.</p>"

  "Aegislash": {
    "overview": "<p>Aegislash's sword and shield motif isn't just for show; Stance Change turns it into an incredibly powerful offensive force that is also extremely bulky. Combine this with its excellent defensive typing that gives it nine resistances and three immunities, as well as its effective use of Weakness Policy, and you have an absolute wrecking ball of a Pokemon that is very difficult to directly check in Battle Spot Singles. Ironically, Aegislash's biggest weakness lies in its greatest strength. Aegislash is very vulnerable in its Blade Forme due to its low defenses. In the fast-paced world of Battle Spot Singles, Aegislash often finds itself in situations that are heavily prediction-dependent. One wrong use of King's Shield or an attack can lead to a KO—or even a sweep—from your opponent. Additionally, with the rampant use of offensive Ground-types in Battle Spot Singles, Aegislash can find itself in situations where even its Shield Forme's bulk won't be enough to survive. Aegislash's Achilles's heel isn't that much of a detriment in the end though, as Stance Change makes it one of the most prominent bulky offensive forces in Battle Spot Singles. Preparing for Aegislash is absolutely necessary for any Battle Spot Singles team to succeed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Spooky Plate can still let Aegislash deal good damage with Shadow Ball and Shadow Sneak, but it makes Sacred Sword and Flash Cannon rather weak. Aegislash can equip Safety Goggles to become an effective Breloom check if needed, though it won't do much else. Head Smash may seem like an appealing option due to being more powerful than any of Aegislash's STAB attacks, but its high recoil and 20% chance of missing generally make it an especially risky option, meaning that you should only consider it if Mandibuzz and Charizard switch-ins are huge problems for your team. Rock Slide can be used if you especially fear bulky Talonflame using Will-O-Wisp on physically based Aegislash. Pursuit can deal good damage to Pokemon switching out, but it is generally not worth the loss in coverage otherwise. Aegislash can attempt a surprise sweep with Autotomize. While Autotomize's Speed increase means that Aegislash can sweep with far more powerful attacks than Shadow Sneak, it also requires Speed investment to take advantage of, making it harder to set up. Destiny Bond may seem like a great option for putting opponents in a tight spot, but Aegislash's low Speed prevents this from being as effective as it could be.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mandibuzz: Mandibuzz's Dark / Flying typing and good defenses allow it to tank Aegislash's assaults, and Mandibuzz can ignore King's Shield due to Foul Play's mechanics. Mandibuzz does need to watch out for Head Smash and Substitute + Toxic sets, though.</p> <p><strong>Bisharp</strong>: Bisharp not only resists Aegislash's STAB attacks, it also can destroy Aegislash with Knock Off. What truly sets Bisharp apart, is its ability Defiant, allowing it to bypass the Attack drop of King's Shield.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Ground-types</strong>: Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Excadrill are among Aegislash's biggest problems. These Pokemon avoid King's Shield's attack-lowering qualities with Earthquake and have the option of running offensive items to make their Earthquake's just powerful enough to OHKO Aegislash. Note, when these Pokemon don't run Attack-boosting items, they become vulnerable to healthy Aegislash themselves due to Weakness Policy.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Fire-types: Mega Charizard Y and Heatran don't care about King's Shield and can fry Aegislash with their powerful special attacks. Just note, Heatran will need Overheat or a Special Attack-boosting item if it wants to OHKO Aegislash. While Aegislash can play nasty games with King's Shield against Blaziken and Mega Charizard X, they can fight back with setup moves if they predict correctly. Otherwise, Flare Blitz annihilates Aegislash.</p> <p><strong>Substitute: Due to Aegislash's forme-changing nature, it's particularly vulnerable to offensive Pokemon with Substitute. Substitute can make choosing between King's Shield and attacking become a very dangerous game, one that is easy for Aegislash to lose.</p> <p><strong>Porygon2</strong>: Porygon2 can effectively check Special Attacker Aegislash and can even threaten to severely damage physically based variants with Foul Play. However, Porygon2 handles Substitute Aegislash rather poorly.</p> <p><strong>Mega Lopunny</strong>: While Mega Lopunny is rather vulnerable to King's Shield, if it uses Encore on Shadow Ball, Shadow Sneak, or King's Shield, it leaves Aegislash extremely vulnerable to High Jump Kick or getting set up by another Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Taking Advantage of the Blade Forme</strong>: While checking Aegislash directly can be difficult, Aegislash is at its most vulnerable when it's in its Blade forme, as it forces Aegislash into mind games. If you predict correctly, setting up on King's Shield can open up new sweeping opportunities, while attacking on a predicted stay on the offense will shatter Aegislash.</p>",

        "name": "THE CRUMBLER (Special Attacker)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball is able to slice through most Pokemon in the Battle Spot Singles metagame thanks to Aegislash's base 150 Special Attack and the lack of Pokemon that resist it. Shadow Sneak is Aegislash's way to pick off weakened opponents or to use one last move before getting KOed. King's Shield protects Aegislash from getting KOed in its very vulnerable Blade forme by returning it back to its extremely bulky Shield forme. King's Shield also reduces any contact move using Pokemon's attack by two stages. This is especially useful against Blaziken and Mega Charizard-X, who can OHKO Aegislash with Flare Blitz. Just remember, King's Shield does not shield Aegislash from getting hit by status moves. Sacred Sword can OHKO Dragon Dance Tyranitar and 2HKO Mega Kangaskhan, and is Aegislash's only shot of breaking through Chansey, though it needs a Weakness Policy boost to achieve this. Flash Cannon doesn't have as good coverage, but it still hits Tyranitar and Mega Kangaskhan hard, while rendering Aegislash less vulnerable to risky switch-ins from dangerous Pokemon such as Mega Salamence and Mega Gengar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Quiet nature boosts Aegislash's important Special Attack, while still allowing Shadow Sneak and Sacred Sword to deal good damage. 4 EVs in Special Defense ensure that any Porygon2 with Download will receive an Attack boost, leading to a weaker Shadow Ball of theirs. A Speed IV of 0 allows Aegislash to underspeed other Aegislash early-game and hit them in Blade forme. However, you can also use a perfect Speed IV to allow your Aegislash to revenge kill other weakened Aegislash later in the game. Weakness Policy allows Aegislash to become an absolute wrecking ball of a Pokemon, boosting Shadow Ball to tremendous levels of power when hit with a super effective attack. Maximum HP and Special Attack investment ensures that Aegislash can tank most super effective hits and proceed to slam targets with a boosted attack. If you feel the need for more immediate power, however, Life Orb gives Aegislash plenty of power at the cost of survivability, notably letting a faster Aegislash revenge kill opposing Aegislash when they are under 70% of their health. If you are more worried about Ground-types, Air Balloon can put offensive Ground-types into uncomfortable situations and can be paired with Hidden Power Ice to slam Garchomp and Landorus-T. Finally, if you have especially big problems with Garchomp and Landorus-T, you can use a Shuca Berry with Hidden Power Ice to make Aegislash an effective lure or revenge killer against the weaker variants, though note that these options mean that Aegislash will have a harder time cleaning up weakened teams.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The general way to use Aegislash is in a rather hit-and-run manner: switch into Pokemon it threatens (good examples include Cresselia and unboosted Mega Salamence) and choose the appropriate attacking move, then switch out when the opponent switches in their Aegislash check. If your opponent's remaining Pokemon have trouble breaking through Aegislash, use King's Shield to restore Aegislash's bulk via the Shield forme. When using Weakness Policy, you can turn Aegislash into an incredibly destructive, game-changing Pokemon. Keep Aegislash hidden in your team and scout your opponent. Try to figure out if your opponent's \"Aegislash checks\" can actually OHKO Aegislash; many Aegislash checks will fail to beat it one-on-one if they are lacking an offensive item or a setup move. Switching Aegislash in after losing a Pokemon or via U-turn can put these ill-equipped \"checks\" in an extremely difficult situation, as an Aegislash with a Weakness Policy boost will often OHKO them, while their other coverage moves will do very little to Aegislash. This can lead to Aegislash either taking out an important Pokemon or setting up for a clean sweep versus weakened teams. One of the riskier aspects of Aegislash is taking advantage of its usual predictability. Many higher ranked opponents may predict a King's Shield and use the free turn King's Shield offers them to switch to an Aegislash check or set up. Taking advantage of Aegislash's predictability is a very high-risk, high-reward strategy. If you manage to respond with a good switch-in or attack from Aegislash, you may put your opponent at a massive disadvantage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>The most obvious Aegislash teammates are Dragon-, Dark-, Fighting-, Flying-, and Normal-type Pokemon, as they complement its typing defensively by resisting its weaknesses and tend to attract moves Aegislash can switch into. Mega Salamence is a great example of a dangerous Pokemon that can cover Aegislash's weaknesses to Ground- and Fire-type moves. While Hydreigon is a bit more niche than Mega Salamence, it takes this to the next level, as Aegislash and Hydreigon together carry a resistance or immunity to all 18 types. While Tyranitar unfortunately shares the Ground weakness with Aegislash, it resists Aegislash's other weaknesses and can use Ice Beam to lure and smash Garchomp and Landorus-T switch-ins to aid Aegislash. Finally, any Fighting-type Pokemon and Aegislash form a good offensive core, with Fighting-types smashing through Porygon2 and Aegislash dealing with Cresselia. Weakness Policy Aegislash can find itself in situations where it barely misses out on the Shadow Sneak KOs it needs to clean up a weakened team. As such, Will-O-Wisp support from the likes of Rotom-W, Talonflame, and (Mega) Gengar works fantastically well for Aegislash, weakening key physical checks, while effectively wearing down other opponents. Toxic support can also aid Aegislash, especially because it can use King's Shield to rack up the Toxic damage. Tyranitar and Hippowdon can provide Sand Stream support to whittle down opponents to Shadow Sneak KO range. Finally, while Stealth Rock can be tricky to use in Battle Spot Singles, it undeniably aids Aegislash in the same way. While Aegislash is bulky on its own, getting it in with Volt Switch or U-turn can give it the perfect opportunity to preserve its health for Weakness Policy use. Rotom-W, Landorus-T, Talonflame, and Mega Manectric are good options to consider.</p>"

        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This Aegislash can work as an excellent lure if used correctly. Substitute and Toxic allow Aegislash to beat one of its usual checks, Porygon2, while generally working wonderfully against many Aegislash switch-ins, preventing them from statusing Aegislash or setting up on it as it switches out. King's Shield further complements these two moves, doing a good job of giving Aegislash an extra turn to stall for Toxic damage and Leftovers recovery, in addition to the usual Shield forme switching. Shadow Ball has good coverage alone, being able to do serious damage to any Pokemon that isn't a Dark- or Normal-type, and can give Aegislash the edge against opposing Aegislash, but its inability to hit Normal-types can give Aegislash problems against Mega Lopunny and Mega Kangaskhan. If your team can't afford to Toxic stall them and carry another switch-in, consider Flash Cannon instead; it does plenty of damage to Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Lopunny and still has the same Base Power as Shadow Ball, though Flash Cannon unfortunately is resisted by many Pokemon and puts Aegislash at a disadvantage against other Aegislash.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Modest nature with maximum HP and Special Attack investment gives Aegislash good bulk and attacking power. 4 Speed EVs let Aegislash outspeed opposing base 60 Speed Pokemon such as Porygon2, Clefable, and Sylveon. This lets Aegislash use Substitute and Toxic before one of the aforementioned Pokemon, giving it an easier time against them without having to risk the Speed tie. A Modest nature is preferred, as with Substitute, Aegislash can play mind games against slower Aegislash and possibly come out on top with Shadow Ball. However, since Aegislash will often find itself stalling for time, you can opt to use Timid with maximum HP and Speed instead. While this makes Aegislash less of an offensive force, it allows Aegislash to outspeed Adamant Breloom and use Substitute before it can put Aegislash to sleep. If using Flash Cannon, you can use a Quiet nature with a 0 Speed IV to at least have a shot of doing good damage to opposing Blade forme Aegislash with Flash Cannon. Leftovers is the preferred item, as in tandem with King's Shield and Substitute, it makes Aegislash extra tough to take down. However, Air Balloon is notable for allowing Aegislash a shot at completely walling some Mega Kangaskhan and forcing Ground-type checks into a very uncomfortable situation if you manage to get Substitute up while still carrying an Air Balloon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try being coy with this Aegislash set. While it may be tempting to immediately switch Aegislash into Porygon2, this tends to make your opponent suspicious of Aegislash's set. Switch Aegislash into Pokemon it usually switches into, such as Cresselia and Mega Heracross. This can lead to your opponent switching Porygon2 in on a well-timed Toxic or Substitute or shock more offensive switch-ins with a Substitute. This Aegislash in particular can be good at taking advantage of Choice-locked Pokemon. Pay attention to items such as Choice Scarf, as an opponent locked into a wrong move gives Aegislash the perfect time to set up Substitute. Outrage is an especially good candidate here, giving Aegislash time to set up Substitute and attack.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since this Aegislash set is based around luring your opponent, it's essential to pair Aegislash with Pokemon that appreciate Porygon2 and other defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia and Mandibuzz being weakened. Garchomp and Mega Salamence excellent teammates in this case: they appreciate Aegislash's ability to deal with Cresselia and Porygon2, while Aegislash benefits from the opportunities to switch into Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks. Other offensive Pokemon burdened by Porygon2 such as Mega Kangaskhan and Greninja also work well with this Aegislash. While this Aegislash makes a great Porygon2 lure, having good Porygon2 checks is still a good idea, because lacking any can make your opponent suspicious about your strategy, potentially leading him/her choosing a better trio of Pokemon. Fighting types such as Blaziken, Mega Lopunny, and Terrakion make good choices here, since these 3 Pokemon benefit from Aegislash eliminating Cresselia.</p>"

      {
        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>While Aegislash is generally more dangerous as a special attacker, a physically based variant does have some advantages, such as a stronger Shadow Sneak that can more easily pick off weakened Pokemon and clean up battle-weary teams. Sacred Sword complements Shadow Sneak perfectly, hitting Normal-types and Ferrothorn hard. As a final offensive move, Iron Head is a fine choice. While many Pokemon resist it, Iron Head is Aegislash's strongest attack against most Pokemon that don't. If you're more worried about opposing Aegislash, Shadow Claw can take them out earlier than Shadow Sneak can. King's Shield gives Aegislash more chances at staying in by reverting it back to its Shield forme. Swords Dance is the high-risk, high-reward option; while Aegislash isn't a particularly potent sweeper on its own, Swords Dance can dramatically boost its cleaning power late-game, giving your team a new potential win condition at the cost of being forced to switch out more often. Finally, King's Shield and Swords Dance together can be a particularly dangerous foe to face late-game, due to having potent cleaning power and being hard to take down. However, this causes Aegislash's utility early in the game to suffer, as losing Iron Head or Shadow Claw makes KOing bulkier threats much more difficult for Aegislash.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An Adamant nature with maximum HP and Attack investment gives Aegislash the picking-off power it needs, in addition to a good amount of bulk. 4 Special Defense EVs deny Porygon2 a Special Attack boost from Download. If you want to take advantage of the Shield forme more often, consider a Brave nature and a Speed IV of 0. Life Orb and Weakness Policy are both great options on this Aegislash. Life Orb shows more immediate benefits of Aegislash's increased physical power, allowing Shadow Sneak to have an 81% chance of OHKOing minimum HP Mega Gengar, allowing Sacred Sword to OHKO Mega Kangaskhan switch-ins, and allowing a boosted Sacred Sword to OHKO Ferrothorn. Life Orb is also the safer option for getting Swords Dance Aegislash to reliably snap weakened teams in half. The power of Weakness Policy is undeniable, though. Weakness Policy can gives your Aegislash new opportunities to slice through a weakened team without using Swords Dance. Additionally, Weakness Policy gives Aegislash a better shot of beating many healthier Pokemon one-on-one such as Garchomp.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The key to using physical Aegislash is to try saving it until later in the game, where it has a better shot of slicing and dicing a team apart. This is especially true if you plan on using Swords Dance, as using Swords Dance on Aegislash early in the game usually ends poorly. This isn't to say that physically based Aegislash is useless in tough early-game situations, though, so don't be afraid to bring Aegislash out earlier if you think it will win you the game. However, if you find yourself using Aegislash a lot earlier in the game often, consider using the special attacker Aegislash set instead. Also, note that Intimidate users such as Landorus-T, Gyarados, and Salamence can torpedo Aegislash's chances of sweeping a team, so setting up when these threats are around is generally not a good idea unless your opponent's team is sufficiently weakened. An important warning to consider: this Aegislash is extremely vulnerable to Will-O-Wisp, so King's Shield is not as safe of an option versus defensive threats as it usually is.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Even with maximum Attack investment, Aegislash can still have a habit of barely missing out on important KOs with Shadow Sneak. Providing support in the form of residual damage can aid Aegislash in becoming a particularly potent cleaner versus offensive teams. Will-O-Wisp can work wonders, giving Aegislash new opportunities to set up, in addition to neutering some of Aegislash's checks. Rotom-W, Talonflame, and Gengar / Mega Gengar are all teammates to consider. Toxic, while not quite as potent as Will-O-Wisp, can still wear opponents down, and it offers a much wider amount of Pokemon to choose from. If your teammate needs some particularly low-effort residual damage, Tyranitar and Hippowdon's Sand Stream can work well. If you can fit it on your team, Stealth Rock can also aid in Aegislash's attempt to sweep through weakened teams. Consider using Pokemon immune to Will-O-Wisp, as this Aegislash is a huge target for them. Mega Charizard X is a particularly good teammate, as it's one of the few Pokemon immune to Will-O-Wisp that can handle Rotom-W. Pokemon that can use Facade effectively such as Mega Salamence and Mega Mawile can also work if you are desperate for options. Otherwise, at least pair Aegislash with a special attacker to avoid getting neutered offensively. If using Swords Dance, Aegislash can take advantage of a more unusual kind of support: Thunder Wave. Normally, Aegislash has to be especially careful against paralyzed Pokemon, as missing out on a KO against them can spell doom due to the Blade forme's low defenses. In the case of Swords Dance Aegislash, many paralyzed Pokemon can be obliterated by a boosted attack, giving Aegislash a quicker opportunity to pull off a sweep. Thunder Wave has a very high distribution, but Porygon2 and Ferrothorn deserve special mention for luring in some of Aegislash's faster checks.</p>"

  "Cresselia": {
    "overview": "<p>Cresselia is one of the most prominent defensive Pokemon in Battle Spot Singles. With defenses on par with those of Ubers and an excellent defensive ability in Levitate, Cresselia is capable of checking some of Battle Spot Singles's biggest threats, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence! Additionally, Cresselia has an excellent support movepool to take advantage of her bulk, with game-changing moves such as Lunar Dance, Thunder Wave, and Trick Room, and access to a recovery move in Moonlight. Few Pokemon in Battle Spot Singles can come close to Cresselia's combination of support and checking power!</p> <p>Sadly, Cresselia's wonderful defensive qualities are hampered by her mediocre Psychic typing. The only particularly useful resistance she has is Fighting, while her typing leaves her vulnerable to deadly special attackers such as Mega Gengar, Aegislash, Greninja, and Hydreigon and even hinders her against some physical threats such as Tyranitar and Scizor. Furthermore, Cresselia's poor offenses mean that these threats can usually come in with very few issues and that Cresselia is often setup bait.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Calm Mind is appealing, but Cresselia's low offensive presence means that she requires a large number of Calm Mind boosts before she has any chance of sweeping. If using Calm Mind, Psyshock is recommended, as it allows Cresselia to defeat Suicune and Sylveon one-on-one. Shadow Ball can also be used with Calm Mind to eventually prevail over Aegislash after a large number of boosts. Moonblast can be used to deal a large amount of damage to Hydreigon and hit Tyranitar for decent damage. If hitting Tyranitar harder is your primary concern, Grass Knot can be used, although this still won't even always 4HKO Tyranitar.</p> <p>On the support side, Cresselia has access to Skill Swap, which allows it to weaken Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Salamence and make Gliscor's Toxic Orb backfire. Icy Wind is another form of speed control, but it's pathetically weak compared to Ice Beam. Gravity might seem like a poor idea due to it nullifying Levitate, but it can be paired with powerful Ground-types to wreak havoc. Magic Coat can be a surprise move to deal with status and Taunt, although it requires good prediction to be used effectively. Cresselia has access to Reflect and Light Screen, which can be used in combination with Light Clay and Lunar Dance to help a sweeper set up.</p> <p>Item-wise, Safety Goggles is a reasonable choice if your team fears Breloom. An odd but somewhat effective strategy is to use Psycho Shift Cresselia with Flame Orb. This allows Cresselia to cripple physical threats with a burn. However, Flame Orb drastically reduces Cresselia's lifespan, and the set is extremely predictable the moment Cresselia gets burned. Cresselia also has access to the disruptive Trick. This can be used with a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs to cripple defensive Pokemon, but Cresselia's low offenses make it a poor Choice user. Shed Shell can be used to escape Mega Gengar and Wobbuffet if your team is especially fearful of them.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mega Mawile: Mega Mawile doesn't care about anything Cresselia can do besides the rare Skill Swap and can set up on Cresselia with Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar hates paralysis and Psychic, but it can trap Cresselia and 2HKO with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Wobbuffet</strong>: Wobbuffet, after using Encore, either uses Cresselia as setup bait for dangerous sweepers or defeats her with Mirror Coat.</p> <p><strong>Bisharp</strong>: Bisharp's typing gives it a resistance to Ice Beam and an immunity to Psychic, and its Sucker Punch makes attempts at speed control useless. Bisharp's STAB Knock Off and Pursuit severely damage Cresselia, and Defiant takes advantage of Intimidate from Mawile and Landorus-T, common Cresselia teammates.</p> <p><strong>Azumarill: Azumarill can set up Belly Drum and OHKO Cresselia with Play Rough as long as it hasn't taken too much prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash</strong>: Aegislash laughs at Cresselia's attempts to inflict it with status and 2HKOes her with Shadow Ball. Aegislash can even set up on Cresselia with Swords Dance or Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn has nothing to worry about from Cresselia's status moves and can stall her Moonlight out with Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Anti-Status Calm Mind Users</strong>: Suicune and Sylveon use Cresselia to setup with Calm Mind thanks to Rest and Sleep Talk. Mega Sableye can't even be hit by Psyshock, and it has Magic Bounce to status Cresselia with her own moves.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar: Dragon Dance variants of Tyranitar will dislike Thunder Wave, but Sand Stream will weaken Moonlight and Tyranitar can destroy Cresselia with its Dark-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Special Dark-types</strong>: Special Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Greninja can bust through Cresselia's Special Defense with their STAB Dark Pulse. However, both of them hate Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Mega Heracross: Mega Heracross bypasses Cresselia's Rocky Helmet and vanquishes her with its Skill Link-boosted Pin Missile. Mega Heracross is even bulky enough to avoid a 2HKO from Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Bug-types</strong>: Scizor, Volcarona, Heracross, and Escavalier can hit Cresselia hard with their STAB Bug-type attacks. Scizor and Volcarona, in particular, can even attempt to set up on Cresselia!</p> <p><strong>Trick: Tricking Cresselia a Choice item destroys her walling capability. The most common user of Trick is Rotom-W, but Rotom-H and Togekiss are also viable users of Trick.</p> <p><strong>Toxic: Toxic slowly but surely ruins Cresselia's walling capabilities, making it vulnerable to the very Pokemon it attempts to check!</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt prevents Cresselia from using its valuable support moves, leaving her as a sitting duck waiting to be set up on due to her weak attacks. Common users include Talonflame, Thundurus, and Gyarados.</p>",

        "name": "Defensive Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Beam is Cresselia's main checking tool, KOing important threats that are 4x weak to Ice, such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence. Moonlight restores Cresselia's health, maintaining her ability to check important physical threats. Psychic is a good secondary attack, allowing Cresselia to 2HKO her archnemesis, Mega Gengar, making it think twice about switching in. Psychic also 2HKOes Fighting-types such as Blaziken and Mega Lopunny and does decent chip damage to Mega Kangaskhan. One of Cresselia's most potentially devastating support options is Lunar Dance. Lunar Dance might seem like a strange option on such a defensive Pokemon, as Cresselia will immediately faint after using it. However, the ability to completely restore the health and PP of a battle-weary sweeper can lead to a devastating turn of events for your opponent, making it a great move to use when Cresselia has outlived her usefulness.</p> <p>If you're more interested in early-game support options, Thunder Wave is an excellent choice, crippling Cresselia's faster offensive checks and clearing the way for your own sweepers. Cresselia also happens to be one of the most reliable users of Trick Room around, allowing your slow, bulky attackers to become fearsome speed demons for five turns! Toxic is Cresselia's most passive support option. While it won't immediately cripple offensive threats, Toxic gives Cresselia the edge against opposing Cresselia and Porygon2 and does a great job of wearing down physical threats. Finally, if your team can handle Fighting-types and Mega Gengar effectively, you can even opt to replace Psychic with Lunar Dance, giving Cresselia room for these support options.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Bold nature and maximum investment in HP and Defense are required for Cresselia to check Battle Spot's many dangerous physical threats. The extra 4 EVs go in Special Defense because winning Speed ties won't aid Cresselia in the slightest. Rocky Helmet is by far Cresselia's best item choice. Because Cresselia's offenses are lackluster, Rocky Helmet picks up the slack by dealing damage to any Pokemon using a contact move. This is what makes Cresselia an effective check to Mega Kangaskhan, forcing it to lose around 32% of its health any time it attacks Cresselia! If another one of your Pokemon is already using Rocky Helmet, you can opt to use a Sitrus Berry or Leftovers to give Cresselia some extra sustainability. Just note that this makes Cresselia a less effective Mega Kangaskhan check.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Cresselia is at its best early on in the match. Simply switch Cresselia into dangerous physical threats with contact moves, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Mega Lopunny, and use the appropriate attacking move or recover Cresselia's health with Moonlight. Strong, boosted attacks have the potential to severely damage Cresselia, so switching it into these threats before they boost is a good idea.</p> <p>If Cresselia has taken down one of its targets, don't be afraid to sacrifice Cresselia. Using Lunar Dance to restore a battle-weary sweeper's HP or simply switching Cresselia into a powerful move so a faster Pokemon can revenge kill the foe is a fine choice if Cresselia has taken down its targets, because keeping Cresselia around longer than it is useful can actually backfire due to its minimal offensive presence.</p> <p>Pay attention to Team Preview, as there are two big factors that can affect Cresselia before the battle even begins! The first factor is Mega Gengar. Mega Gengar's ability to trap and defeat Cresselia is a huge problem, so if you feel like you must use Cresselia, using Psychic or Thunder Wave on predicted Gengar switch-ins can save Cresselia from assassination attempts! Wobbuffet can pose similar issues; due to its typing, Cresselia does extremely poorly against Wobbuffet. Additionally, Cresselia has a difficult time making an impact on stall teams due to its poor offenses. When seeing a stall team or Wobbuffet in Team Preview, consider benching Cresselia if at all possible.</p> <p>If using Trick Room Cresselia, it might be tempting to set up Trick Room as soon as possible. However, Cresselia's offensive presence is rather poor, usually forcing you to switch her out for a more potent threat. This wastes a valuable turn of Trick Room, meaning that using Trick Room early in the match isn't always the correct choice. If you are unsure whether your opponent is running foes that check your choice of Trick Room sweepers, it is usually best to let the match play out until you feel that Trick Room will make a big impact on the battlefield.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As Cresselia is primarily a defensive Pokemon, covering its weaknesses to Dark-, Ghost-, and, to a lesser extent, Bug-type Pokemon is highly recommended. Ferrothorn is a unique threat to Cresselia, using its Steel typing and Leech Seed to simply stall Cresselia out of Moonlight's PP. Fighting-types such as Mega Heracross, Blaziken, Mega Lopunny, and Terrakion (which notably gets an Attack boost from Dark-type attacks) are effective switch-ins for Dark- and Bug-type moves, and effectively slam Ferrothorn. Mega Mawile's and Azumarill's Fairy typing makes them effective checks to most Dark- and Bug-types as well. Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Mega Gyarados also happen to pair well with Cresselia, covering Cresselia's weaknesses to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks while Cresselia tanks Fighting-type attacks. Porygon2's Normal typing makes it immune to Ghost-type moves, and its good bulk allows it to check Greninja and Aegislash effectively. While Heatran only covers Cresselia's weakness to Bug-type attacks, it is notable for forming an effective defensive partnership with Cresselia thanks to its ability to lure in Ground- and Fighting-type attacks for Cresselia to take advantage of.</p> <p>Additionally, Mega Mawile and Azumarill are particularly notable threats, as they can use Cresselia's poor offensive presence to set up and break through Cresselia's team. These Pokemon can be particularly hard to wall, meaning that less defensive options to Cresselia's checks can work well, too. Talonflame makes for a particularly powerful teammate, using its strong priority Brave Bird to smash through Belly Drum Azumarill and frail special attackers such Greninja and Mega Gengar and using Flare Blitz to fry Mega Mawile and weakened Aegislash. Mega Charizard Y is another notable offensive teammate, roasting Steel-types and slamming Azumarill with Solar Beam. Mega Charizard Y's Drought also gets rid of the dreaded sandstorm and replaces it with sunny weather, which boosts Moonlight! Mega Gengar can toy with Cresselia's defensive threats effectively thanks to Shadow Tag and its immunity to Toxic, and it can also sacrifice itself with Destiny Bond to remove some of Cresselia's offensive checks.</p> <p>Lunar Dance is an amazing support move, so teaming Cresselia up with decently bulky attackers is highly recommended. Mega Kangaskhan stands out as the most brutal teammate, as restoring Mega Kangaskhan to full health can annihilate worn-down teams! Other good recipients for Lunar Dance include Mega Salamence, Aegislash, Garchomp, Belly Drum Azumarill, Mega Mawile, Dragonite, and Mega Charizard X.</p> <p>If your Cresselia is equipped with Thunder Wave, make sure to take advantage of it with her teammates! Slow, powerful Pokemon such as Mega Mawile, Azumarill, and Conkeldurr work well here. You can also use Pokemon that, while not slow, have more awkward Speed tiers. Great examples of teammates in this category include Landorus-T, Hydreigon, and Mega Heracross.</p> <p>Cresselia variants that are being used as Trick Room supporters need to be paired with some slow, powerful Pokemon to work effectively. Mega Mawile is the premier teammate under Trick Room, becoming extremely difficult to check when it outspeeds the majority of the metagame! Other good choices include Azumarill, Escavalier (which provides a Spore immunity with Overcoat), Rhyperior, and Conkeldurr. Also, realize that your entire team shouldn't focus on functioning under Trick Room, as this reduces your team's matchup versatility.</p>"

  "Charizard": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Evolutions define Battle Spot Singles's metagame, but Charizard kicks that concept up a notch, being the only Pokemon with two Mega Evolutions! Mega Charizard X is the physical attacker, having an incredible boosting ability in Tough Claws. Its secondary Dragon typing makes it very unique among Fire-types, allowing it to set up on defensive Water-types with Dragon Dance and Swords Dance. With access to awesome support moves such as Flame Charge, Roost, and Will-O-Wisp and the bulk to use them, Mega Charizard X stands out as the most versatile physical Fire-type out there and as a physical Dragon-type that isn't checked by normal means such as Will-O-Wisp or Suicune.</p> <p>Mega Charizard Y is the opposite side of the coin. With Drought and an impressive Special Attack stat, Mega Charizard Y is a ferocious wallbreaker that 2HKOes the majority of the metagame with no setup whatsoever. Drought even provides Mega Charizard Y with defensive benefits, allowing it to take on most Water-type Pokemon in conjunction with its good Special Defense stat and access to Solar Beam. Mega Charizard Y might not be as versatile as Mega Charizard X, but it doesn't need to be when the switch-ins most teams can provide will get 2HKOed at worst!</p> <p>While each Charizard Mega Evolution is a dangerous Pokemon, both are reasonable enough to check on their own. However, since both of these Pokemon come under the disguise of Charizard at first, their threat level is magnified. Each Charizard has a dramatically different set of checks from each other, with one Pokemon checking one Charizard Mega Evolution, only to get obliterated by the other. With the limited number of Pokemon you can send out and the fast-paced nature of Battle Spot Singles in mind, this means that predicting the wrong Mega Evolution often results in losing a Pokemon or getting set up on, which is usually a devastating blow that often costs you the game!</p> <p>The key to solving the nightmarish guessing game is to keep their similarities in mind, which opens up a few reliable tactics against both Mega Evolutions. Both also have a huge problem with Stealth Rock, which is likely to appear on any team that has big problems with the Mega Charizard duo, chopping off enough health to make it reasonable to revenge kill. Charizard's Speed, while certainly not bad, is hotly contested in Battle Spot Singles, meaning it Speed ties with Salamence and Mega Kangaskhan and gets outsped by the ever-so-common Garchomp. Finally, with Choice Scarf users, Garchomp, and common Focus Sash users such as Breloom often running Rock-type attacks, landing a super effective hit on either Mega Evolution is actually a feasible task. In general, applying constant offensive pressure on the Mega Charizard family can save teams from getting tricked by this two-in-one Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>For Mega Charizard X, Belly Drum might seem like a devastating setup attack, but Mega Charizard X's lack of priority and common Speed tier make it far more risky than Dragon Dance and Swords Dance. Rock Slide can be used to OHKO Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, but Dragon-type attacks do plenty already. Fire Punch is a Fire-type attack that lacks recoil, but Flame Charge is usually the better choice for the Speed boost.</p> <p>For Mega Charizard Y, Sunny Day can be useful to surprise Politoed and Tyranitar switch-ins, but it does little else. Dragon Pulse hits Hydreigon and Latios harder, but Fire-type moves do plenty enough to them, and Focus Blast does more to Hydreigon. If you're especially worried about Talonflame and other Mega Charizard Y, you can use Ancient Power to OHKO them. Air Slash is useful for inducing flinches and does a bit more against Conkeldurr and Mega Venusaur, but otherwise it is too weak to do much despite having STAB. If you really want to surprise Tyranitar, Heatran, and Chansey, you can use Focus Punch on Mega Charizard Y, though note that this only works on the switch. In general, Mega Charizard Y is strapped for moveslots, so using more exotic options is a difficult proposal for most teams.</p> <p>Tailwind is an interesting choice to consider on both Charizard Mega Evolutions, as it allow them to outspeed Garchomp. However, it doesn't last long, and it doesn't have the Attack boost of Dragon Dance or the offensive pressure of Flame Charge. Substitute protects both Mega Evolutions from status, allows them to take advantage of their ability to force switches, and saves them from Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch and Choice Scarf Garchomp, but otherwise it costs them in coverage. Regular Charizard is monstrously powerful with a Life Orb, Solar Power, and Sunny Day, but the setup and lack of bulk are huge problems.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>For Both Charizard Mega Evolutions</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock chopping off half the health before Charizard can Mega Evolve really shortens its. Common users of Stealth Rock include Hippowdon, Garchomp, Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Swampert.</p> <p><strong>Mega Altaria: Mega Altaria is uncommon, but it's one of the few Pokemon to wall both Mega Evolutions, and it can hit both of them hard with its Dragon- and Fairy-type STAB moves. It can even run Facade to punish Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Garchomp</strong>: Garchomp naturally outspeeds Charizard and often carries a Rock-type attack to hit them hard no matter which Mega Evolution it chooses. Garchomp can even run a Choice Scarf to outspeed Mega Charizard after a Dragon Dance or Flame Charge, but Garchomp that lack Choice Scarf must be warry of Flame Charge.</p> <p><strong>Other Offensive Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types often carry STAB Earthquake to defeat Mega Charizard X and Rock-type moves to defeat Mega Charizard Y. Focus Sash users such as Excadrill and Landorus-T can pull this off, and they can also use Choice Scarf to outspeed Mega Charizard X and Y before a Dragon Dance or Flame Charge. Even though Mamoswine doesn't always run a Rock-type attack, it still often runs Focus Sash, OHKOes Mega Charizard X with Earthquake, and deals massive damage to Mega Charizard Y with Icicle Spear.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence: Mega Salamence takes a lot of damage from both Charizard Mega Evolutions, but its STAB Double-Edge does a ton of damage to both. Earthquake hits Mega Charizard X hard, and Draco Meteor OHKOes Mega Charizard X. Mega Salamence is also faster than both Charizard Mega Evolutions before a Speed boost.</p> <p><strong>Thundurus</strong>: Thundurus hits Mega Charizard Y hard with Thunderbolt and can use prankster Thunder Wave to ruin Mega Charizard X's chances of sweeping. However, it can't take either of their hits very well, with even bulky Thundurus being 2HKOed.</p> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan</strong>: While it only Speed ties with Mega Charizard X and Y, said Speed tie means that Mega Kangaskhan can smash them with Double-Edge or Earthquake. It even sometimes runs Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Breloom</strong>: Breloom might sound preposterous as a check, but its affinity for Focus Sash and high-powered Rock Tombs are a big problem for Mega Charizard X and Y if Stealth Rock isn't set up.</p> <p><strong>For Mega Charizard X</strong></p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Landorus-T can usually survive unboosted assaults and smash Mega Charizard X with Earthquake. Rhyperior also works, since Solid Rock covers its Earthquake weakness. Note that none of these like Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Azumarill: Azumarill resists Mega Charizard X's STAB types and can hit hard with Play Rough. However, +1 Thunder Punch and +2 Flare Blitz can defeat Azumarill, and it hates Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Mega Charizard X without Earthquake can have a hard time against Heatran without boosts while Heatran can slam it hard with Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Faster Dragons</strong>: Latios, Latias, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon outspeed and can OHKO Mega Charizard X; however, they are unable to switch in and must watch out for Speed-boosting moves such as Dragon Dance and Flame Charge.</p> <p><strong>Cresselia: While Cresselia doesn't directly hurt Mega Charizard X much, it can cripple Mega Charizard X with Thunder Wave. It must watch out for Swords Dance-boosted Outrage, however.</p> <p><strong>For Mega Charizard Y</strong></p> <p><strong>Talonflame</strong>: Talonflame resists all of Mega Charizard Y's attacks and can either wall it with a specially defensive set or outright OHKO it with Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird. Note that Talonflame can lose in the rare case of Ancient Power Mega Charizard Y.</p> <p><strong>Politoed</strong>: Unlike most Water-types, Politoed has Drizzle, which ruins Mega Charizard Y's ability to hit it with Solar Beam.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-H</strong>: Calm Rotom-H isn't 2HKOed by Mega Charizard Y, and it 2HKOes with Thunderbolt in return. Offensive variants take heavy damage from Fire-type attacks, but Choice Specs variants in particular can OHKO Mega Charizard Y.</p> <p><strong>Mega Charizard X</strong>: Mega Charizard X takes little damage from Fire- and Grass-type attacks, and it can use Mega Charizard Y as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Thanks to Multiscale and resistances, Dragonite sets up on Mega Charizard Y, unless it switches into Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Tyranitar</strong>: Although Focus Blast deals serious damage, specially defensive and Assault Vest Tyranitar get rid of the sun and easily OHKOs Mega Charizard Y. Choice Scarf Tyranitar also outspeeds Mega Charizard Y, and switching into a Solar Beam means Tyranitar will usually win. In general, Tyranitar's appearance makes Solar Beam much more difficult to use for Mega Charizard Y, reducing its versatility.</p> <p><strong>Faster Electric-types</strong>: While they can't take Mega Charizard Y's attacks very well, faster Electric-types such as Raikou and Thundurus-T can revenge kill it. Choice Scarf Rotom-W can also revenge kill weakened Mega Charizard Y, though it can get OHKOed by Solar Beam. Also, none of these threats can handle Mega Charizard Y once it gets a Flame Charge boost.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey: Chansey and Blissey's massive HP and Special Defense stats ensure that Mega Charizard Y can't muscle past them.</p> <p><strong>Entei</strong>: Assault Vest Entei can tank Mega Charizard Y's attacks and threaten to OHKO it with Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Chandelure</strong>: While uncommon, Flash Fire Chandelure completely walls Mega Charizard Y and can hit it with Shadow Ball while threatening other switch-ins with its own Fire Blasts.</p> <p><strong>Greninja</strong>: Greninja normally makes a poor Mega Charizard Y check, but if it's running Rock Slide or Rock Tomb, it can act as a surprise revenge killer as long as Mega Charizard Y hasn't used Flame Charge.</p>",

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With a Dragon Dance in tow, Mega Charizard X becomes a powerful sweeper that outspeeds every relevant non-Choice Scarf Pokemon in Battle Spot Singles. Outrage is Mega Charizard X's cleaning tool of choice, OHKOing most offensive Pokemon after a boost. Flare Blitz is just as powerful as Outrage but doesn't lock Mega Charizard X in, making it a good move to throw out before setting up despite the recoil.</p> <p>The last move is a bit trickier to choose and depends on the makeup of your team. Earthquake allows Mega Charizard X to OHKO Heatran and pick off weakened Aegislash without risking a King's Shield hit. Roost allows Mega Charizard X to recover from Stealth Rock damage against nonthreatening Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, and it allows Mega Charizard X to set up multiple Dragon Dances against certain defensive threats such as Suicune that lack Roar. Dragon Claw is a weaker but safer Dragon-type STAB move than Outrage, perfect for smashing through Dragon-types without risking a Steel- or Fairy-type switching in. Finally, Thunder Punch allows Mega Charizard X to OHKO Azumarill after a boost, to 2HKO Suicune without locking itself into Outrage, and to get past bulky Gyarados more easily.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mega Charizard X will want to maximize its Attack and Speed EVs to ensure it can sweep as easily as possible. The rest goes into Defense rather than HP, as this means less damage is taken from Stealth Rock. Make sure to carry Charizardite X so you don't use the wrong Mega Evolution!</p> <p>Adamant is usually the best nature for Mega Charizard X, giving it plenty of power while still outspeeding non-Choice Scarf Pokemon after a Dragon Dance. However, a Jolly nature is still valuable for allowing Mega Charizard X to outspeed Kangaskhan and Lucario before they Mega Evolve and to outspeed the rare Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Note that the loss of power will be noticeable, losing out some KOs such as no longer guaranteeing a 2HKO on maximum HP Leftovers Heatran with a boosted Outrage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The key to sweeping with Mega Charizard X is knowing when to use Dragon Dance. Early in the game, if your opponent could potentially send out big problems such as Choice Scarf Garchomp, Hippowdon, bulky Landorus-T, Thundurus (which can use Prankster Thunder Wave to ruin a sweep), and walls that can paralyze Mega Charizard X such as Porygon2 and Cresselia, you're better off attacking instead of setting up. Only set up Dragon Dance later in the game, when these checks have been weakened enough. Note that if running Lunar Dance Cresselia, you can use Mega Charizard X early in the game to deal plenty of damage, or use it more recklessly against Pokemon with status moves, since Lunar Dance will restore it back to perfect health!</p> <p>Since Mega Charizard X often finds itself using the recoil-causing Flare Blitz, it's also best to set up on Pokemon that won't harm Mega Charizard X too much. Defensive Rotom formes, Volcarona, Ferrothorn, Raikou, and Mega Charizard Y are good examples of Pokemon Mega Charizard X will usually scare out. Note that defensive Rotom formes and Ferrothorn occasionally carry Thunder Wave, which can be an issue if they predict setup. If Charizard has Roost, you can even set up on Suicune that lack Roar! Mega Charizard X's setup potential is especially boosted if given support in the form of Yawn.</p> <p>While it might be tempting to always use Mega Charizard X as a sweeper, sometimes it's best to just attack switch-ins right away, especially if the opponent's Mega Charizard X answers tend to be more offensive Pokemon. Mega Charizard X's STAB moves have plenty of power before a boost, enough so that against a slower, weakened team, Dragon Dance might not even be needed.</p> <p>If Stealth Rock isn't set up, you have the option of keeping Charizard unevolved for some time. This is great for double switches and scouting what your opponent's response to Charizard will be, potentially throwing them off guard if they choose the wrong check for Mega Charizard X. Also, Charizard has a useful Ground immunity, which can help it set up against Choice-locked Ground-type attacks or some offensive Heatran variants before Mega Evolving.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Garchomp is Mega Charizard X's biggest problem, naturally outspeeding it and even being able to run a Choice Scarf or a Focus Sash to defeat it after a Dragon Dance. Bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon and defensive Landorus-T and Focus Sash or Choice Scarf Mamoswine and Excadrill are also serious problems. Azumarill defeats Mega Charizard X without Thunder Punch, while faster Dragon-types such as Latios, Mega Salamence, and Hydreigon will OHKO Mega Charizard X before it can set up Dragon Dance. Finally, Thundurus and Cresselia, while not being able to directly defeat Mega Charizard X, can stop its sweep with Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Because of these issues, Rotom-W makes a great teammate. It handles bulky Ground-types and Mamoswine fairly well with Hydro Pump, can burn Garchomp, handles Belly Drum Azumarill, and can even cripple Cresselia with Trick if running an offensive set! In return, Mega Charizard X sets up on Ferrothorn for Rotom-W. A Hippowdon of your own also makes an excellent teammate, being able to use Stealth Rock to help Mega Charizard X grab more KOs; it also has access to Yawn to help Mega Charizard X set up and is able to deal with Garchomp and Mega Kangaskhan. Defensive Zapdos does a good job against Azumarill and Mega Salamence, while Suicune can defeat Mega Salamence, Ground-types, and set up Calm Mind on Cresselia.</p> <p>On the more offensive side of things, Serperior checks Azumarill and Ground-types, while Mamoswine aids Mega Charizard X by defeating Focus Sash Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Thundurus with Icicle Spear, as well as setting up Stealth Rock. Azumarill does a great job of taking on specially attacking Dragons, is immune to Outrage, smashes Hippowdon, and can revenge kill weakened Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Landorus-T. While Greninja offers no defensive synergy with Mega Charizard X, its ability Protean and its movepool allow it to revenge kill most of Mega Charizard X's threats, and it does a great job softening up threats to make way for a Mega Charizard X sweep.</p> <p>Cresselia deserves special mention as a teammate, as Lunar Dance makes Mega Charizard X far more versatile in the earlier parts of the game thanks to the full recovery. Cresselia also deals with Garchomp and Landorus-T, and it supports Mega Charizard X by paralyzing faster foes with Thunder Wave.</p>"

        "name": "Versatile Sweeper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance boosts Mega Charizard X's Attack to frightening new levels, allowing it to become a powerful wallbreaker. Flame Charge boosts Mega Charizard X's Speed. While it has low Base Power, Tough Claws and STAB boost it enough to make it a good tool for maintaining pressure against offensive teams and defeating faster Focus Sash switch-ins. Outrage is Mega Charizard X's main STAB move, being so powerful that even Heatran is 2HKOed after a Swords Dance! Flare Blitz complements Outrage perfectly, allowing Mega Charizard X to slam walls without locking itself into Outrage and to hit Fairy-types hard. In fact, after a Swords Dance, Flare Blitz has a 75% chance to OHKO Azumarill after Stealth Rock damage! However, if you're more worried about hitting Heatran before a boost, Earthquake is an acceptable alternative.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment is needed for Mega Charizard X to be a competent wallbreaker. 4 Defense EVs are better than HP EVs, as this means Charizard will take less damage from Stealth Rock. Make sure to carry Charizardite X to Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard X.</p> <p>An Adamant nature fits this set the best, as it maximizes Mega Charizard X's wallbreaking power. However, a Jolly nature allows Mega Charizard X to Speed tie with Salamence and outspeed Kangaskhan and Lucario before they Mega Evolve. This comes at the cost of power, however, losing the chance to OHKO Azumarill and Cresselia after a Swords Dance and Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Don't be reckless when switching Mega Charizard X in, as its reliance on boosted Outrage and Flare Blitz tends to make it the shortest-lived Mega Charizard X set. Usually, you'll want to switch Mega Charizard X in on something it can set up on without taking damage, after a KO, or via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. Good Pokemon to set up on include defensive Rotom formes, Volcarona, Raikou, Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Mega Charizard Y. Also, note that if you are using Mega Charizard X with Cresselia, being more reckless against opponents becomes a much more viable tactic thanks to Lunar Dance.</p> <p>While Mega Charizard X is nearly unstoppable once it sets up both Swords Dance and Flame Charge, setting up both is a difficult task, so oftentimes it's best to choose which move to set up with. When more defensive Pokemon are left, Swords Dance is the best move to set up with to break through walls, paving the way for other sweepers to clean up. If more frail, offensive Pokemon are left, then it's best to use Flame Charge to either set up a clean sweep or take out an important, fast Pokemon. Just note that this can be unsafe if Choice Scarf or Focus Sash Garchomp is around, so make sure to scout its item. Generally, Mega Charizard X is faster than the targets it wants to defeat with Swords Dance-boosted attacks, while the faster threats are OHKOed without a boost and only need to be outsped via Flame Charge.</p> <p>A common way to defeat Mega Charizard X is to goad it into using Outrage so that Fairy-types like Azumarill and Mega Mawile can hit it hard, so only use Outrage if you absolutely need a threat down if you see Fairy-types in Team Preview. Steel-types are used for a similar purpose, but note that after a Swords Dance, most such as Heatran will be 2HKOed by Outrage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock support is highly recommended for this Mega Charizard X, as it gives it the chance to get some major KOs against defensive threats after a Swords Dance, such as a guaranteed OHKO on Suicune, a 62.5% chance to OHKO Cresselia, and a 75% chance to OHKO Azumarill. Hippowdon is an excellent choice, as it deals with Garchomp, one of Mega Charizard X's archnemeses; can use Yawn to help Mega Charizard X set up; and has Sand Stream to take care of Focus Sash. In a similar matter, Swampert can use Yawn and set up Stealth Rock, and as a bonus, its Water typing allows it to hit Mamoswine, Excadrill, and Landorus-T hard. Mamoswine is also a good user of Stealth Rock, and it is able to defeat Thundurus and Focus Sash Garchomp. A Focus Sash Garchomp of your own does a good job of setting up Stealth Rock, while Landorus-T can set up Stealth Rock and soften up foes with Intimidate. All of these Pokemon appreciate Mega Charizard X's wallbreaking power and can also help against Heatran if Mega Charizard X lacks Earthquake.</p> <p>One of this Mega Charizard X's biggest problems is faster Dragon-types. Garchomp is the biggest issue, since it naturally outspeeds Mega Charizard X, and it can even run a Choice Scarf to always outspeed. Mega Salamence and Choice Scarf Hydreigon always outspeed it before a boost. Azumarill is also a big problem if Stealth Rock isn't set up. Defensive Zapdos is a good choice for a partner, as it can help with Mega Salamence and Azumarill. While not as bulky as Zapdos, Thundurus can use Prankster Thunder Wave to deal with faster Dragons. Cresselia does a great job against Garchomp and Mega Salamence, and it can support Mega Charizard X with Thunder Wave and Lunar Dance. Suicune also does well against Garchomp and Mega Salamence and can aid further against Battle Spot Singles's walls with Calm Mind. If you're especially worried about Azumarill, Serperior can work well against it; it also forms a good defensive core with Mega Charizard X and Suicune and can paralyze faster threats with Glare. While frail, Breloom can be a great teammate, dealing with Azumarill, slowing down foes with Rock Tomb, and even putting foes to sleep with Spore so Mega Charizard X can set up. Greninja can soften up or outright KO many of Mega Charizard X's threats despite its frailness. Finally, Mega Kangaskhan makes a good backup Mega Pokemon, as it deals with offensive teams better, while Mega Charizard X can handle more defensive teams.</p> <p>As a special mention, seriously consider Cresselia as a teammate, as Lunar Dance gives Mega Charizard X a second chance to sweep. Cresselia also defeats Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Landorus-T and can provide Mega Charizard X with Thunder Wave support so it can use Swords Dance more often.</p>"

        "name": "Drought Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With the sun shining, Flamethrower is an extremely powerful attack, 2HKOing most Pokemon that don't resist it. Fire Blast is even more absurdly powerful, 2HKOing Pokemon that resist it such as Mega Salamence, Garchomp, Hydreigon, and opposing Mega Charizard Y. However, because of Mega Charizard Y's physical frailness, missing with Fire Blast can be deadly. Solar Beam complements the Fire STAB type perfectly, smashing Water-types such as Azumarill, Rotom-W, Suicune, and Swampert. It's also useful for revenge killing weakened Tyranitar in the sun. Focus Blast's accuracy can be a bit shaky, but it allows Mega Charizard Y to 2HKO Heatran and seriously damage Tyranitar switch-ins.</p> <p>Overheat is an extremely powerful attack, dealing over 50% to most possible switch-ins. However, it greatly reduces Mega Charizard Y's power, often forcing it to switch, which is especially costly when your opponent has set up Stealth Rock. Hidden Power Ice OHKOes incoming Garchomp and Mega Salamence, potentially opening up a sweep for Mega Charizard Y, but note that Fire Blast does more to Pokemon that are only 2x weak to Hidden Power Ice. Roost allows Mega Charizard Y to recover from Stealth Rock damage and stay alive longer. Mega Charizard Y's good Special Defense stat means it is capable of using Roost against walls such as Porygon2, Cresselia, and Suicune and against Pokemon it scares out such as Aegislash, Ferrothorn, and Scizor. Flame Charge might seem a bit strange because it's a physical attack, but its Speed-boosting effect is great for allowing Mega Charizard Y to defeat faster threats such as Greninja and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, letting Mega Charizard Y defeat faster Focus Sash Pokemon after hitting them on the switch, and even potentially sweep weakened teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Speed are needed for full wallbreaking power. The leftover EVs should go in Defense so that Mega Charizard Y can switch into Stealth Rock twice. If you are using Hidden Power Ice, put the remaining EVs in Special Defense instead so you don't waste any EVs. Blaze is the simplest nature to use, since it has no harmful effects, and Trace Pokemon can't make any use of it. However, Solar Power has the bonus of making Charizard more powerful than Mega Charizard Y under the sun, which can be useful if your opponent is also running Mega Charizard Y. Make sure to hold a Charizardite Y so Charizard will Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard Y.</p> <p>A Timid nature makes the most sense for Mega Charizard Y, since it already has plenty of power under the sun, and it can then Speed tie with Salamence and outspeed Lucario and Kangaskhan before they Mega Evolve. However, if you want more power, Modest allows Mega Charizard Y to 2HKO Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Hydreigon with Flamethrower.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is a huge problem for Mega Charizard Y, chopping off almost half its health per switch in. Try to prevent Stealth Rock from being set up any way you can. If your opponent's Stealth Rock user looks like a more defensive, bulky user such as Hippowdon or Swampert, consider leading with Mega Charizard Y to avoid one switch into Stealth Rock and for the ability to slam them with Solar Beam. However, Mega Charizard Y won't be able to stop fast users of it such as Garchomp. If the opponent's team looks like it will put too much pressure on Mega Charizard Y due to Stealth Rock and a high number of offensive Pokemon, consider benching Charizard.</p> <p>Usually, you'll want to Mega Evolve Charizard as soon as possible, as there are almost no direct benefits otherwise. The only reasons to not Mega Evolve are to grab a KO so you don't waste a turn of Drought, to predict a Tyranitar or Politoed switch-in, or if you want to double switch and keep your Charizard's Mega Evolution unrevealed.</p> <p>Mega Charizard Y works great early- or mid-game, where it can deal massive damage to incoming Pokemon, softening them up for a sweep from its teammates late on. However, Mega Charizard Y is so powerful that cleaning up isn't out of the question late-game, especially if it is carrying Flame Charge. Also, try to target slower Pokemon with Mega Charizard Y, as fast offensive threats such as Garchomp and Mega Salamence deal massive damage to it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is Mega Charizard Y's biggest fear, so if you can't stop it, at least check the threats that set it up. Additionally, Pokemon that carry Rock-type moves such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Excadrill often carry Focus Sash or Choice Scarf to revenge kill Mega Charizard Y. Talonflame is problematic because it resists all of Mega Charizard Y's attacks and can OHKO it with Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird. Rotom-H is also a problem due to its resistance to Fire- and Grass-type moves and its super effective Electric STAB type. While Thundurus and Raikou are hit hard by the Fire-type attacks, they can also outspeed and zap Mega Charizard Y. Finally, Politoed can flip the weather on Mega Charizard Y with its Drizzle ability.</p> <p>Hippowdon makes an excellent teammate for Mega Charizard Y. It can hit Garchomp and offensive Landorus-T hard with Ice Fang, deal with Excadrill, and use Yawn to put Politoed switch-ins to sleep. They also have good typing synergy, with Hippowdon taking Rock-type attacks and Mega Charizard Y dealing with Grass-type attacks and certain special attacks. A unique aspect of Hippowdon is that it has Sand Stream, which allows Mega Charizard Y to reset the sun at any time. Tyranitar is also great for resetting the weather, and it does a good job of handling Talonflame, Latias, Latios, and Thundurus that lack Focus Blast. Mamoswine is a great option to consider, taking care of Focus Sash Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Thundurus, and if you are especially desperate to keep Stealth Rock off the field, it can even use a Choice Scarf to defeat Garchomp before Garchomp can move. Serperior cuts through Mamoswine and Politoed with Leaf Storm, can Taunt most Stealth Rock users before they move, and can Glare through Ground-types such as Garchomp. Ferrothorn handles Politoed and has a Rock-type resistance, the ability to handle Raikou and Thundurus, and the utility of Thunder Wave to support Mega Charizard Y. Conkeldurr takes Rock-type attacks fairly well and can hit Choice Scarf Excadrill and Mamoswine with Drain Punch. Bulky Landorus-T takes on most Ground-types fairly well, defeats offensive Talonflame, and can use U-turn to get Mega Charizard Y in, while Thundurus-T absorbs Electric-type attacks and fries Politoed and Talonflame with Thunderbolt. Thundurus can use its Prankster Thunder Wave to aid Mega Charizard Y against faster threats, and it can use a bulky EV spread to handle Talonflame and Mega Salamence.</p>"

      {
        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Will-O-Wisp is what makes this set so effective, crippling many of Mega Charizard X's physical switch-ins. Roost is the other key to this set, allowing Mega Charizard X to stick around for a long time. Dragon Claw doesn't have high Base Power, but STAB and Tough Claws makes it a reliable attack. Flame Charge is a bit weak, but the Speed boost it provides is invaluable for allowing Mega Charizard X to burn or attack faster threats such as Garchomp and Mega Kangaskhan. If you're more worried about Heatran, Earthquake is an acceptable secondary attack.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Running a Jolly nature and 220 Speed EVs gives Mega Charizard X the ability to outspeed Adamant Salamence and Mega Kangaskhan. The HP EVs give Charizard an odd HP number to take less damage against Stealth Rock, and 116 Defense EVs maximize its physical bulk. If you prefer to be a bit quicker, you can run maximum Speed EVs to at least Speed tie with Salamence and Mega Kangaskhan, but note that these two often opt for Adamant over Jolly anyway. If you're interested in a bulkier spread, 172 HP / 132 Def / 204 Spe with an Impish nature gives Mega Charizard X better bulk, at the cost of only being able to outspeed base 80 Speed Pokemon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Usually, it's best to Mega Evolve Charizard as soon as you can to get a better defensive typing and stats. Staying in as Charizard only helps with switching into Ground-type attacks and keeping the opponent in the dark as to what Mega Stone you're running if you double switch. Mega Evolving early also lessens Stealth Rock's damage, to the point where leading with Charizard is encouraged as long as you think you can get a favorable lead matchup. Staying in against faster Dragons such as Garchomp is ill advised.</p> <p>Throw out Will-O-Wisp as much as possible. Many of Mega Charizard X's checks are physical Ground-types in addition to Azumarill, making this Mega Charizard X set a great lure. You'll want to use a combination of Dragon Claw and Roost to whittle down these foes' health. Will-O-Wisp is even useful against bulky special attackers such as Porygon2 and Cresselia, as Will-O-Wisp can wear them down into the KO range of powerful sweepers. If you're carrying Flame Charge, using this attack early is useful so Mega Charizard X can burn faster threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Garchomp and Mega Salamence are also hit hard by Dragon Claw after a Speed boost, but note that they won't be OHKOed without previous damage. You can burn them, but note that they can still do heavy damage, with Salamence in particular being able to use Draco Meteor, while some Garchomp run Lum Berry.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Charizard X is a great lure against physical attackers such as Azumarill and Garchomp thanks to Will-O-Wisp, so packing in Pokemon to take advantage of burned foes is a good idea. Azumarill is a fantastic option, being able to easily set up Belly Drum on burned Pokemon. Calm Mind Sylveon does better when its foes are burned, and it happens to deal with defensive Pokemon well too. Weakness Policy Aegislash can take advantage of weaker super effective attacks to set up, while burned Pokemon have a difficult time preventing a Dragonite from setting up. Mega Charizard X can also be an invaluable lure for sand-based Excadrill teams for its ability to lure and cripple Landorus-T as well as deal with defensive Rotom-W and Ferrothorn. Just note that since this means you're also running either Hippowdon or Tyranitar, this core has severe problems with Suicune and offers no resistances to powerful Water-type attacks in general.</p> <p>This Mega Charizard X set has trouble against bulky Pokemon that don't care about status, such as Suicune and Mega Sableye. Raikou sets up Calm Minds on Suicune with ease, and Serperior also works well with Leaf Storm. Both of these Pokemon also love Mega Charizard X's ability to deal with Ferrothorn and burn physical attackers. Zapdos is a good teammate against Suicune as well, while Sylveon and Azumarill can hit Mega Sableye hard. Thundurus and Thundurus-T can surprise Mega Sableye with Nasty Plot and also jolt through Suicune.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Mega Blastoise's ability to check and counter some of the top threats makes it a great anti-meta Pokemon. Mega Launcher boosts Mega Blastoise's aura and pulse moves by 50%, making it an effective wallbreaker. Furthermore, it has access to a lot of coverage moves, such as Dark Pulse, Aura Sphere, and Ice Beam, and excellent bulk that allows it to tank powerful attacks. Mega Blastoise is also very versatile, functioning as a lead as well as a late-game sweeper. However, Mega Blastoise has a subpar Speed stat and requires some form of speed control from Pokemon such as Thundurus and Cresselia. It is also weak to common Electric-types such as Thundurus and Rotom-W and as it has no form of recovery, it is worn down easily by status conditions.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragon Pulse OHKOes Mega Charizard X and has a chance to OHKO Latios as well. However, Ice Beam hits the more commonly used Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Mega Salamence for more damage; therefore, it is the better option. Water Spout has an insane Base Power of 150 when used at full HP, but due to Mega Blastoise's subpar Speed, it can never count on maintaining that Base Power throughout the game. Hydro Pump can be used over Water Pulse, but its low accuracy can be detrimental in the long run. Scald's burn chance can come in handy, but Mega Blastoise is at its best when it is dealing as much damage as possible, not fishing for burns. Yawn usually gives Mega Blastoise a free turn, but it's highly situational and forces Mega Blastoise to sacrifice useful coverage moves. Mirror Coat allows Mega Blastoise to return double the damage it takes, but due to its low HP stat, it isn't recommended.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey walls any attack from Mega Blastoise and can wear it down using a combination of Toxic, Soft-Boiled, and Seismic Toss. It can also safely switch into any move without worry because at best Aura Sphere barely 4HKOes it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Sylveon and Goodra stop Mega Blastoise right in its tracks. Mega Blastoise at best can 3HKO Sylveon, while Choice Specs Sylveon can 2HKO it with a Hyper Voice. Assault Vest Goodra tanks all hits Mega Blastoise throws in its direction and can also 2HKO Mega Blastoise with a combination of Thunderbolt and Draco Meteor.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Suicune can set up on Blastoise using Calm Mind because at best Dark Pulse and Aura Sphere are a 3HKO. Additionally, it can restore its health with Rest. Suicune can also status Mega Blastoise using Toxic. Azumarill can switch into any attack Mega Blastoise uses and set up on it using Belly Drum. Assault Vest Azumarill is an even bigger problem, as it completely walls Mega Blastoise and has a chance to 2HKO Mega Blastoise with Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Mega Venusaur can switch into any move Mega Blastoise uses and can beat it with a combination of Leech Seed and Giga Drain. Serperior can safely fire off Leaf Storms against Mega Blastoise and boost its Special Attack in the process. Breloom can outspeed Mega Blastoise, put it to sleep, and finish it off with Bullet Seed. However, these two must be wary of Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Life Orb Thundurus and Choice Specs Rotom-W can OHKO Mega Blastoise with a super effective Thunderbolt or can cripple it with Thunder Wave. Sitrus Berry Rotom-W can tank any hit Mega Blastoise uses and can finish it off using two Thunderbolts. All variations of Raikou have a good time against Mega Blastoise. The Assault Vest variant can 2HKO with Thunderbolt, the Choice Specs variant OHKOes with Thunderbolt, and the Leftovers variant can safely set up with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Mega Heracross: Mega Heracross can survive any attack Mega Blastoise uses and has a chance to OHKO it with Bullet Seed.</p> <p><strong>Greninja</strong>: Life Orb Greninja often carries Grass Knot, which has a chance to OHKO Mega Blastoise thanks to Protean.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Water Pulse has an effective Base Power of 90 thanks to the boost from Mega Launcher, allowing Mega Blastoise to check Talonflame, Blaziken, and Mamoswine. Aura Sphere is a must on Mega Blastoise to check Dark-, Normal-, and Steel-types such as Hydreigon, Tyranitar, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Lucario. Ice Beam OHKOes some of the most important threats in the metagame such as Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Landorus-T. It can also be used as a way to hit Thundurus on a predicted switch. The last moveslot is based on personal preference. Dark Pulse provides Mega Blastoise with additional coverage and allows it to hit top threats such as Gengar and Aegislash for super effective damage. Aqua Jet is very useful against common Focus Sash users such as Gengar, Mamoswine, Blaziken, and Greninja.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Blastoisinite is essential for enough wallbreaking power. Blastoise should always Mega Evolve on the first turn so it can gain Mega Launcher. 252 EVs in HP make Mega Blastoise as bulky as possible and allow it to survive powerful attacks such as an Outrage from Choice Band Garchomp, Double-Edge from Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Salamence, Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Hydreigon, and Solar Beam from Mega Charizard Y. However, do note that a combination of Fake Out and Double-Edge from Mega Kangaskhan has a chance to KO Mega Blastoise. 252 EVs in Special Attack and a Modest nature ensure Mega Blastoise hits as hard as possible. If Aqua Jet is opted for, a Quiet nature with an alternative EV spread of 244 HP / 4 Atk / 4 Def / 252 SpA / 4 SpD can be used.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The best option is to always Mega Evolve Blastoise immediately so it can deal as much as damage as possible. Mega Blastoise's great coverage can be exploited by hitting opposing Pokemon for super effective damage on predicted switches early in the game. For example, lead Mamoswine and Mega Salamence are often used together. Usually on the first turn, most opponents switch to Salamence fearing a Water Pulse. You can use this to your advantage and use Ice Beam on the predicted switch. Now your opponent loses their Salamence and you take control of the game. Later in the game, Mega Blastoise can be used to clean through the opposing team after your opponent's Pokemon have been crippled by status or are at low health. Hence, Mega Blastoise is very versatile, functioning both as a lead and as a late-game sweeper. Mega Blastoise is also great at taking out common physical walls such as Hippowdon, Cresselia, and Porygon2; it OHKOes the former and 2HKOes the latter two. Mega Blastoise struggles with stall Pokemon such as Mega Sableye, Chansey, and Suicune and must never be left on the field when facing those. Due to lack of reliable recovery, Mega Blastoise should only be switched in after its teammate has fainted, as it won't have to risk taking any damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Blastoise enjoys the help of Pokemon that provide it with speed control such as Cresselia, Thundurus, and Zapdos. Cresselia has access to Trick Room and Lunar Dance, which help Mega Blastoise sweep and recover from previous damage. Thundurus has access to Prankster Thunder Wave and can switch into common Grass-types such as Serperior and Ferrothorn. Defensive Zapdos can wear down opposing Pokemon with Discharge and Toxic. Zapdos also helps eliminate Ferrothorn reliably with Heat Wave. Ferrothorn itself is another great teammate, as it resists Electric- and Grass-type attacks and can cripple opposing teams with Stealth Rock and Leech Seed, making Mega Blastoise's job much easier. It is also a great check to Azumarill, which stops Mega Blastoise right in its tracks.</p> <p>Garchomp is a notable partner as well, since it's immune to Electric-type moves and helps deal with Pokemon that can cause Mega Blastoise problems such as Mega Mawile and Weakness Policy Aegislash. Garchomp enjoys Mega Blastoise's help too, since it can take care of physical walls such as Hippowdon and Cresselia and other common threats to Garchomp such as Mamoswine and Hydreigon. Talonflame and Heatran make good partners for Mega Blastoise, as they can help get rid of Serperior and Mega Venusaur. Additionally, Heatran can switch into Fairy-types such as Mega Mawile and Sylveon for Mega Blastoise. In return, Mega Blastoise can deal with Ground-types such as Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Landorus-T. Another notable teammate is Volcarona; common Rock-type move users such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Tyranitar are all easily taken care of by Mega Blastoise, giving Volcarona an easier time setting up Quiver Dance, while Mega Blastoise also eliminates Talonflame. Whimsicott and Sylveon can be used to switch into resisted Dark- and Fighting-type attacks. Also, they help Mega Blastoise avoid any damage from Dragon-type attacks. Sylveon can additionally deal with Mega Sableye, which is a huge problem for Mega Blastoise. Finally, Grass-types such as Breloom and Serperior can help Mega Blastoise against Suicune and Rotom-W. In return, Mega Blastoise deals with Fire-types such as Talonflame and Blaziken for the two.</p>"

  "Beedrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Previously ridiculed as a garbage Pokemon, Beedrill's Mega Evolution turns it into a beast! While still relatively uncommon in Battle Spot, Mega Beedrill is an offensive powerhouse. Its strength lies in its obscene Attack and Speed, which allow it to outspeed many common threats, and Adaptability, which doubles the power of its STAB moves. It also has a very strong U-turn, turning it into a powerful scout. Unfortunately, it can't reliably switch into a lot of threats because of its low bulk and bad defensive typing. Entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock, give it a huge problem, as they limit the number of times it can switch in. The big problem is that Mega Beedrill can't stand up to a lot of its defensive checks without a lot of team support, so keep that in mind when building around it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fell Stinger can give Mega Beedrill an Attack boost, but it's extremely hard to net KOs with it. Protect or Swords Dance could be dropped to create an all-out attacking set, but only do this if you plan to bring Mega Beedrill in exclusively against slower threats or foes that are paralyzed or asleep. Substitute can be used to take advantage of a predicted status move and make it hard to revenge kill Mega Beedrill. X-Scissor hits a bit harder than U-turn, but then Mega Beedrill loses offensive momentum by not being able to switch out while dealing damage. An Adamant nature is sometimes used to gain extra Attack, but Beedrill needs that Speed to deal with some of its checks, such as Mega Gengar, Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and +1 Mega Gyarados and Mega Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Priority and Choice Scarf Users: These Pokemon can easily switch into Mega Beedrill and revenge kill it. Talonflame in particular stands out because Brave Bird rips Mega Beedrill to shreds.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Mega Beedrill can't OHKO everything, so any Pokemon that can survive a hit from it, such as Hippowdon or Ferrothorn, can easily check it.</p> <p><strong>Blaziken: Blaziken can collect Speed boosts to become faster than Mega Beedrill and hit it with a powerful Fire-type move.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence</strong>: Mega Salamence can set up a Dragon Dance and demolish Mega Beedrill with a powerful Double-Edge or Return. Aside from this, it has Intimidate, which is a huge thorn in Mega Beedrill's side.</p> <p><strong>Recoil Damage</strong>: All of Mega Beedrill's moves make contact, so recoil can really wear it down, limiting the number of times it can make contact. Common sources of recoil are Garchomp, Rocky Helmet Suicune, and Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards: Entry hazards can limit the number of times Mega Beedrill can switch, putting a huge damper on it because of how often it uses U-turn.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>U-turn is Mega Beedrill's main STAB move. It hits like a truck and allows Mega Beedrill to switch out of almost anything that threatens it. Poison Jab is another powerful STAB move that hits several Fairies for super effective damage. Protect allows Mega Beedrill to Mega Evolve safely so it can boost its Speed and scout for moves that threaten it. However, it can be dropped for Swords Dance to turn Mega Beedrill into an amazing wallbreaker. Drill Run deals with Steel-types that can wall Mega Beedrill, such as Heatran and Klefki. Alternatively, Knock Off hits Ghost-types for super effective damage and cripples Pokemon that rely on their item, such as Chansey and Porygon2.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>36 Defense EVs allow Mega Beedrill to take a hit from important priority moves, such as Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch and Choice Band Azumarill's Aqua Jet. 244 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow it to outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Mega Gengar, and the like. The remaining EVs are put into Attack so that it hits as hard as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Beedrill can be used as a scouting lead; Protect can scout the foe's move and allow Beedrill to Mega Evolve safely unless the extra Speed isn't necessary, in which case it should U-turn out or KO the foe. Exercise caution when you know the foe has a priority move; if you know it'll KO Mega Beedrill, hard switch into a teammate that can absorb that hit. Maintaining offensive momentum is imperative, as that's what Mega Beedrill does best. Don't switch Mega Beedrill in on a hit that it doesn't resist; instead, wait for a free switch or Volt Switch or U-turn into it safely.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Hydreigon and Belly Drum Azumarill can aid Mega Beedrill in its sweep, getting rid of important checks such as Mega Slowbro and Ferrothorn. Any Pokemon that can make use of a Lum Berry is a great teammate because Beedrill has a hard time dealing with paralysis, burn, and sleep. One good user of Lum Berry is Garchomp, which can deal with some of Beedrill's checks, such as Talonflame. Anything with Volt Switch forms a great core with Beedrill. Rotom-W in particular stands out because of how physically bulky it is. They can both switch out of their checks repeatedly. Magnezone is also a good partner because it can trap Steel-types and crush them. In return, Mega Beedrill can run Drill Run to deal with Heatran so that it doesn't pose an issue to Magnezone. Both of these Pokemon deal with Talonflame, an important check to Beedrill. Though Beedrill is hyper-offensive in nature, pairing it with a defensive Pokemon that can cover its weaknesses might be beneficial; Suicune is a good example, as it can deal with Fire- and Ice-types. Entry hazard support from the likes of Landorus-T and Hippowdon helps Beedrill wear down some of its checks.</p>"

  "Pidgeot": {
    "overview": "<p>With a small, but specialized, movepool and an excellent base 135 Special Attack that is rare for an offensive Flying-type, Mega Pidgeot is capable of breaking through several otherwise impenetrable Pokemon in Battle Spot Singles such as Gliscor and Mega Venusaur. One of Mega Pidgeot's most interesting assets is its ability to answer Minimize Clefable and Drifblim thanks to its ability, No Guard. No Guard also gives Mega Pidgeot a very powerful tool in STAB Hurricane, an otherwise unreliable move thanks to its 70% accuracy. However, its viable offensive movepool is restricted to Hurricane, Heat Wave, Hidden Power, and Hyper Beam, a tiny selection that leaves Mega Pidgeot hard walled by common Pokemon such as Heatran and Rotom-W. It also has similar checks to Talonflame, a well-prepared-for threat. However, with some team support, Pidgeot functions well as a special wallbreaker and sweeper in the Battle Spot Singles metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Roost can be used as a form of recovery, but in a fast-paced format like Battle Spot Singles, staying healthy isn't really a priority for a fast, frail attacker like Mega Pidgeot. Mirror Move is a fun gimmick that synergizes well with Protect or Substitute to catch OHKO move users and Pokemon that use moves that they themselves are weak to (for example, Shadow Ball Gengar or Earth Power Heatran if a switch is predicted) off-guard. However, it's incredibly situational and, once again, Pidgeot can't really afford the moveslot. Hidden Power Grass, Hidden Power Fighting, and Hidden Power Ground are listed solely for the purpose of beating popular checks such as Rotom-W, Tyranitar, and Heatran, respectively. However, they have little utility, as Tyranitar still doesn't take much from any of them and none are capable of OHKOing their targets from full health. Agility can be used with a Modest nature to turn Mega Pidgeot into a boosting sweeper; however, Pidgeot lacks the bulk to boost in most cases and prefers the Speed tier that a Timid nature grants it. The extra power and Speed can however be useful if you find a boosting opportunity, making Agility a niche option. Hyper Beam is an obscenely powerful STAB move that has some utility in Battle Spot Singles where 1v1 situations are quite possible and Hurricane might not be strong enough to pick something off. However, Hyper Beam's side effect alone nullifies the majority of its value and makes it a niche option in most cases. Similarly to Talonflame, Pidgeot can make use of Tailwind to benefit its teammates, especially if it is expected to faint in the turn that Tailwind is used. Lastly, Whirlwind is an option for forcing boosted Pokemon such as Scolipede, Blaziken, and Minimize Chansey off the field before they can do too much damage. However, Pidgeot can't always make use of this thanks to its frailty relative to other users of phazing moves, especially given the extra layer of vulnerability that it gets from No Guard.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rotom-W and Rotom-H: These two Pokemon are commonly seen threats that resist all of Pidgeot's commonly seen attacks and KO back with a super effective Electric-type move.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Tyrantrum resist both Hurricane and Heat Wave and tend to take little damage from Hidden Power Ice, significantly neutering Pidgeot's main forms of damage output. Meanwhile, they can do significant damage in return with a STAB Stone Edge or Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Heatran: Heatran's ability and set of resistances make it a hard stop to almost all forms of Mega Pidgeot; the only move with any chance of breaking through is Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Mega Manectric and other Electric-type Pokemon such as Jolteon, Zapdos, and Thundurus-T can switch in on a predicted Hurricane and outspeed and OHKO Mega Pidgeot with a STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Greninja: Greninja's base 122 Speed allows it to consistently outspeed Mega Pidgeot and OHKO it with Life Orb-boosted Ice Beam. However, it is incapable of switching in on Hurricane, Hidden Power Grass, and Hidden Power Fighting.</p>",

        "name": "Specially Offensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hurricane is Mega Pidgeot's STAB move and its most spammable move; its reasonable 30% chance to inflict confusion on its target is a useful bonus. Heat Wave allows Mega Pidgeot to OHKO Scizor and Ferrothorn, as well as hit a whole slew of other Steel-types super effectively. Pidgeot's base 101 Speed is good but somewhat middling before it Mega Evolves; therefore, Protect is a useful choice for safely acquiring the Speed boost that allows Mega Pidgeot to outpace Pokemon such as non-Choice Scarf Garchomp, Terrakion, Mega Gallade, Mega Metagross, and Raikou. U-turn is another solid scouting option here, as non-Mega Pidgeot's Speed tier is good enough for it to not need Protect against a lot of threats; U-turn allows Pidgeot to scout for counters switching in and answer accordingly, maintaining your team's momentum. Substitute is similar to Protect in that it shields Pidgeot from most offensive attacks and status moves, but it differentiates itself with a potentially longer-lasting effect; it also has good synergy with the confusion from Hurricane's secondary effect. Lastly, Hidden Power Ice is a useful move for exploiting Mega Pidgeot's Speed tier and high Special Attack to heavily damage threats such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Mega Salamence. Roost is a useful move that can be used in either the third or fourth slot; however, running Pidgeot without Hidden Power Ice means that it cannot perform its niche of checking Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence quite as effectively, whereas losing Protect can make Pidgeot vulnerable to Pokemon such as Garchomp and Terrakion on the turn it Mega Evolves. Recovery is also not much of a priority for Pidgeot in Battle Spot Singles, where its frailty and the fast-paced nature of the format can limit the opportunities that Pidgeot has to heal itself.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mega Pidgeot's base 121 Speed is a valuable benchmark to have in a format where most of the relevant threats are base 100 Speed or faster; therefore, a Timid nature and 252 Speed EVs are essential in order to outspeed and KO dangerous threats such as Mega Salamence and Mega Lucario. 252 Special Attack EVs make Pidgeot's attacks as strong as possible, leaving the last 4 EVs to go into Defense or Special Defense.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Pidgeot beats a very specific number of threats and needs support for another specific group of threats. No Guard Hurricane and Heat Wave give it a solid matchup against Grass-types and Fighting-types such as Mega Venusaur, Serperior, weakened Conkeldurr, and Mega Lucario, and Hidden Power Ice gives it Dragon-slaying utility with its fantastic Speed tier—on the other hand, these three moves are completely walled by Pokemon such as Chansey, Tyranitar, Rotom-W, and Heatran. No Guard also allows Mega Pidgeot to completely bypass any and all evasion changes, completely nullifying Minimize strategies as a threat to your team. However, it also bestows perfect accuracy upon moves used by the opponent, making users of inaccurate moves such as Thunder and Stone Edge and OHKO moves such as Horn Drill and Sheer Cold very scary to face.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Pidgeot is a powerful attacker, but its shallow movepool makes it very predictable and easy to stop. Hurricane spam helps a lot versus its checks if Mega Pidgeot gets the confusion, but Mega Pidgeot will often find itself being forced out by a Tyranitar, Heatran, or Rotom-W, all of which are very common thanks to the ubiquity of Talonflame. As such, it's highly recommended that you come prepared with answers to these Pokemon to allow Pidgeot to have a much better time. Ground-types and Fighting-types are the best catch-all answers to these three Pokemon: Mold Breaker Excadrill's Earthquake can weaken them sufficiently for them to be picked off by Mega Pidgeot's Hurricane; Assault Vest Conkeldurr can throw out Drain Punches and Mach Punches while being able to absorb Rotom-W and Heatran's status moves with Guts and throw out Guts-boosted attacks in return; Landorus-T and Garchomp exacerbate Pidgeot's Ice weakness considerably but are still worth consideration for their powerful Earthquakes and other utilities; and Dugtrio is a niche, but decent, option for trapping and removing Tyranitar, Heatran, and grounded Electric-types such as Raikou.</p>"

  "Clefable": {
    "overview": "<p>Clefable has a great and rare typing for a defensive Pokemon: mono-Fairy. Fairy-type is fantastic because it helps Clefable excel against Pokemon such as Garchomp and Hydreigon, while also having only two relatively rare weaknesses. On top of this, Clefable has an excellent movepool. Calm Mind and Minimize make Clefable a threatening sweeper that can be incredibly difficult to take out. Two great abilities round off Clefable's fantastic traits. Unaware gives Clefable the ability to take on setup sweepers, while Magic Guard is useful against Toxic, making it near impossible to stall Clefable out. At first glance, Minimize might seem like too risky of a strategy, but with the right support, such as speed control from Thunder Wave, Clefable has a favorable chance to win against a lot of common Pokemon, such as Garchomp and Blaziken. However, Clefable isn't limited to only Minimize strategies. Its movepool is wide enough for Clefable to be played in many ways, such as a support role utilizing Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave or even offensive sets utilizing Clefable's impressive coverage moves.</p> <p>Some of Clefable's weaknesses stem from its stats. Clefable is very slow, and this limits Minimize's effectiveness and basically mandates paralysis support. Clefable's defenses, while high enough to get by, often aren't high enough to take on the most powerful attackers in the format such as Mega Kangaskhan and Sylveon. Against these Pokemon it is difficult to find opportunities to set up and Clefable will easily be overwhelmed. Minimize sets also have the downside of being limited to one attack, either STAB or Stored Power. Finally, because of the pentagon rule in Battle Spot, Clefable doesn't have access to its best recovery move, Soft-Boiled, so instead it has to look to less reliable options in Moonlight or Rest.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Cosmic Power can be used instead of Calm Mind, as this makes it harder for physical attackers to damage Clefable. It is best used with Stored Power since the high Base Power will make up for the lack of Special Attack boost. However, this makes Clefable more susceptible to critical hits as it will take much longer for Clefable to win the game compared to Calm Mind. More offensive sets with Life Orb and Magic Guard can be used. Clefable has a lot of good coverage moves such as Thunderbolt for Talonflame, Psychic for Mega Venusaur and Gengar, and Grass Knot for bulky Water- and Ground-types. These sets can catch your opponent off guard very well. Substitute can be used on Minimize sets to help against OHKO move users and, after using Minimize, you can put up more Substitutes to give Clefable more turns. Substitute will usually be used with Leftovers, as it will need to be used over recovery. Substitute usually isn't optimal because it is difficult to fit in the moveset and the other moves for Minimize sets are too good to pass up on. Heal Bell can be used on support sets to help remove troublesome status on offensive teammates, but is generally outclassed by Healing Wish.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Heatran resists Moonblast 4x and can use Toxic to beat Clefable lacking Rest or Magic Guard very easily. It can use Magma Storm to trap Clefable and also use Taunt to shut down any setup, and more offensive sets can use Flash Cannon to hit Clefable super effectively. Toxic variants of Aegislash easily beat Clefable without Rest or Magic Guard. It sets up Substitutes for free on Clefable, making it very difficult for Clefable to take it out. It can also hit Clefable super effectively if running Iron Head or Flash Cannon. Scizor takes little from Moonblast and Choice Band Bullet Punch will 2HKO even after a Kee Berry boost. Scizor also doesn't care about paralysis much because it has access to priority. However, Scizor does have to watch out for Clefable running Fire Blast. Mega Mawile can OHKO with Iron Head and takes little from Moonblast, and can still 2HKO if Kee Berry already activated. Ferrothorn can be very difficult for Clefable to take down and Leech Seed makes it difficult for Clefable to stay healthy. However, when running Kee Berry and Minimize, Clefable can usually effectively stall Ferrothorn out of Gyro Ball PP, and sets with Fire Blast will also take Ferrothorn down fairly easily. Mega Lucario is very threatening and can 2HKO even after Clefable has set up two Calm Minds. Excadrill is able to 2HKO even after a Kee Berry boost and also takes very little from Moonblast, especially if it is an Assault Vest variant.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Mega Gengar can trap Clefable and hit it super effectively with Sludge Bomb. Greninja can 2HKO with Gunk Shot even after Kee Berry activates and will resist Moonblast after using it, but can't safely switch into Moonblast due to its initial Dark typing. Mega Venusaur hits hard with Sludge Bomb and takes very little from Moonblast. It can be very hard to deal with when running Sleep Powder or Leech Seed, if Clefable doesn't have Magic Guard. Amoonguss can use Clear Smog to remove all of Clefable's boosts and can use Spore to punish switch-ins if Clefable decides to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame: Choice Band Talonflame will struggle to take down Clefable after a Kee Berry boost and a few Minimize boosts. However, Taunt variants are able to shut Clefable down completely, take little from Moonblast and can use Roost to take Clefable on even longer.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-W and Rotom-H</strong>: Rotom-W and Rotom-H are able to cripple Clefable with Trick when running Choice sets. Rotom-H takes little from Moonblast and can take on Clefable's most common teammate, Thundurus.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers: Pokemon that are able to deal a lot of damage make it very difficult for Clefable to find turns to set up. Mega Kangaskhan can 2HKO with Adamant Double-Edge even after a Kee Berry boost. Choice Specs Sylveon can 2HKO even after a Calm Mind. Mega Charizard Y takes little from Moonblast and can OHKO with Overheat. If Clefable runs Unaware it will always takes the same amount of damage from Overheat even after the Special Attack drops.</p> <p><strong>OHKO Moves: Clefable spends a lot of turns setting up, giving many chances for OHKO moves to hit, and Minimize doesn't help against them as they have a fixed accuracy. Assault Vest Mamoswine and Lapras are both bulky enough to take several hits from Clefable while they attempt to hit Fissure and Sheer Cold. Gliscor and Glalie can set up Substitutes on turns that Clefable sets up and start trying to hit Guillotine and Sheer Cold.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey: Chansey and Blissey both take very little from Moonblast, and even at +6 are unable to be 2HKOed. They can also Toxic stall Clefable that aren't running Rest or Magic Guard.</p>",

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind allows Clefable to hit harder and makes it more difficult to take out. Moonblast doesn't need too many boosts to start dealing decent damage. It's also useful to hit common Pokemon such as Garchomp and Mega Salamence super effectively. Stored Power can be used over Moonblast for insane amounts of damage after a lot of boosts, but will leave Clefable walled by Dark-types. It is much less flexible than Moonblast as it requires Clefable to have a large amount of boosts before it can be useful, and because of this it is best used on Minimize sets. Minimize makes Clefable very hard for your opponent to beat after a few boosts. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple a lot of threats, such as Blaziken and Mega Salamence, and makes it easier for Clefable to keep setting up Calm Minds because it can safely outspeed and heal up when it needs to against the paralyzed foe. Fire Blast can be used for more coverage against Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Scizor. Flamethrower can also be used if you don't like missing but it is significantly weaker. Moonlight is usually the preferred choice for recovery as it gives the most flexibility possible and frees up Clefable's item slot. Rest is a decent recovery move when used with Chesto Berry. It's less flexible than Moonlight but helps deal with Toxic, and isn't hindered by sand like Moonlight is.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment is used to take on the large amount of physical attackers in the format, such as Blaziken, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Salamence. Since Clefable has Calm Mind to raise its Special Defense, investment in Defense is more important. Kee Berry is used so Pokemon such as Blaziken and Choice Band Garchomp can't 2HKO Clefable, and the boost makes it much easier for Clefable to set up on physical attackers. If running Rest, Chesto Berry should be used instead. Unaware makes Clefable tougher to take out because setup sweepers can't rely on getting an OHKO after setting up. This also makes Clefable a nice check to common setup sweepers such as Mega Salamence and Blaziken. Magic Guard can be used so Clefable is immune to Toxic and burn, which can be useful against stall teams and defensive Pokemon carrying Toxic such as Cresselia and Zapdos. Regardless, when running Minimize, Unaware is usually the preferred ability so Clefable can't be set up on and KOed in one turn.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Clefable works best against paralyzed Pokemon because it will always have the upper hand when going for Calm Mind or Minimize. Getting free turns off full paralysis is also a huge advantage to quickly and safely get maximum evasion boosts. Sets with Minimize are best used late-game when the opposing team has been weakened, so try to take out Pokemon that might threaten Clefable early on. Using Clefable as the last Pokemon can also help to avoid it getting phazed. When Clefable is up against strong physical attackers make sure to recover off the first hit while Kee Berry activates before trying to set up. Before the Kee Berry boost many threats can 2HKO Clefable such as Blaziken, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Salamence. In most games, you should prioritize getting Minimize boosts, as this will give Clefable many free turns later on to set up Calm Minds. Don't get too greedy with Calm Mind; once you are at a comfortable position, start attacking. Two or three Calm Minds are usually enough to close out the game. Make sure you are wisely deciding when to recover and when to set up. It is best to set up Calm Minds on Pokemon that don't threaten Clefable, such as defensive Rotom-W, Suicune, and Cresselia. This is especially true when using Magic Guard or Rest so Toxic or burn isn't an issue from those Pokemon. If you are running Stored Power, make sure to prioritize taking out Dark-types, or consider benching Clefable at team preview if you see a Dark-type that you feel will be too difficult to play around. Fire Blast can be used when you expect Scizor or Ferrothorn to come in, taking them out as fast as possible. Clefable can usually afford to take some hits from Ferrothorn, but Scizor is still threatening and should be removed before attempting a sweep. When running Kee Berry, try to make good use of it if Clefable looks like it can sweep a team. It might be tempting to use Clefable early in some situations if you're using Thunder Wave or coverage moves, but if a sweep looks like a strong possibility, it might be better to save Clefable for later to keep the boost from Kee Berry.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As mentioned earlier, paralysis gives Clefable a big advantage and makes setting up much easier. Teammates that can spread paralysis reliably are necessary on every team with Clefable. Thundurus makes for a great partner, utilizing Prankster Thunder Wave. It can also use Swagger to potentially get more free turns for Clefable with confusion hits, and thanks to Unaware, the Attack boosts from Swagger are not a problem for Clefable. Thundurus is usually the go-to user of Thunder Wave and Swagger because it can also deal with Talonflame, which is a big issue for Clefable when carrying Taunt. Klefki does a similar job to Thundurus with a generally stronger typing, but is much worse against Talonflame and doesn't have an offensive presence like Thundurus does. Klefki is often used as a backup teammate in matchups where Thundurus might be worse, against such Pokemon as Greninja and Porygon2. Serperior can also spread paralysis for Clefable. Glare is able to hit Ground-types which are normally immune to Thunder Wave. Serperior can use a set with Focus Sash and Swagger to give Clefable more potential free turns with confusion hits. With Focus Sash, it can also work as a lure to take out Gengar with Mirror Coat. It can also run a bulkier set with Reflect, which makes it easy to set up on physical attackers. Glalie and Ditto also benefit from some of Clefable's common teammates utilizing paralysis and Swagger. Glalie can set up Substitutes on paralyzed opponents, fishing for Moody boosts, while Ditto can copy Swagger boosts from physical attackers. Mega Gengar can trap and eliminate threats to Clefable such as Mega Venusaur and Cresselia with Toxic. It can use Will-O-Wisp on physical attackers, making it much easier for Clefable to set up on them. If Clefable is running Thunder Wave itself, Mega Gengar can take advantage of it with Hex. Garchomp is a nice teammate for Clefable as it can take on Steel-types such as Heatran and Aegislash. Rock Tomb might also come in handy in some situations before sending in Clefable to set up. Clefable can also switch into opposing Garchomp so your own doesn't have to risk dealing with the mirror match. Since Minimize can be a somewhat unreliable strategy at times, Mega Kangaskhan is a good partner because it is very consistent and can be a good backup win condition in matchups where Clefable might not shine. Clefable is also good at dealing with various offensive threats such as Garchomp and Blaziken and can set up on defensive Pokemon that wall Mega Kangaskhan such as Suicune and Cresselia, so Mega Kangaskhan can have an easier time. If Clefable is running Thunder Wave, Mega Kangaskhan appreciates the speed control on Pokemon such as Blaziken and Mega Salamence. Rotom-W can help deal with Talonflame and can switch into Mamoswine so Clefable doesn't have to risk Fissure hitting it. Rotom-W can also spread status such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave to aid Clefable in setting up. Clefable can work well with physical setup sweepers, such as Mega Salamence and Dragonite, as Clefable can easily switch into Will-O-Wisp without fear if it has Rest or Magic Guard and can set up on physical walls such as Suicune and Cresselia.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Moonblast is Clefable's best option for STAB. Thunder Wave cripples many threats such as Blaziken and Mega Salamence. With Unaware, Clefable can take a hit from set-up sweepers and retaliate with Thunder Wave. Moonlight is Clefable's best option for recovery and helps it stay around longer. Stealth Rock is nice to break Focus Sashes and get some chip damage, which is most useful with very offensive teammates. Encore can lock something into a status move, which is especially good against defensive Pokemon. Fire Blast offers good coverage against Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Scizor. It can also be used to avoid being Toxic stalled. Healing Wish works very well with offensive teammates, bringing something back after being weakened or burned. This is especially nice with powerful threats such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Mawile.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With 236 HP EVs, Clefable gains maximum recovery from Sitrus Berry. A Calm nature and 108 Special Defense EVs allow Clefable to live a Sludge Bomb from Mega Gengar so Clefable can cripple it with Thunder Wave, while the remaining EVs are put into Defense. Unaware allows Clefable to take on set-up sweepers. Sitrus Berry allows Clefable to take hits better, as it turns many 2HKOs into 3HKOs. It allows Clefable to switch into Pokemon such as Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Azumarill much more easily. Rocky Helmet can be used to help deal with physical attackers such as Blaziken, Mega Kangaskhan, and Talonflame. Many of these Pokemon use moves with recoil and when combined with damage from Rocky Helmet it quickly weakens them without Clefable even needing to attack. It is especially good against Mega Kangaskhan because of Parental Bond activating Rocky Helmet twice. Leftovers can be used if Sitrus Berry is taken, as the recovery each turn can be useful in some scenarios, especially against Garchomp without a boosting item, to avoid a 2HKO from Earthquake.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set aims to support the team and create opportunities for teammates to succeed. Setting up Stealth Rock early can make it easier for offensive teammates to pick up KOs, thanks to Focus Sashes being broken and the extra chip damage. Encore should be used to lock something into a useless move such as a defensive Pokemon using its recovery. This can give Clefable's teammates opportunities to come in and get free turns to set up. Thunder Wave should be used on fast threats such as Blaziken and Gengar, so they become much easier to revenge kill. Support from Healing Wish can allow you to play a bit more recklessly with Clefable's teammates, as you can sometimes afford to take a burn or paralysis or let a Pokemon get significantly weakened if you know you can heal it later. With Unaware, Clefable can be used as a check to most setup sweepers, using Thunder Wave on them as Clefable takes a hit. However, Clefable should be wary of switching directly in because most setup sweepers, such as Mega Blaziken and Mega Salamence, are powerful enough to 2HKO it if they opt to simply attack instead of setting up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set should be used with more offensive teammates. If a team appears to be weak to many common setup sweepers and struggles to revenge kill very fast threats, then Clefable is a good option. Mega Gengar appreciates Clefable paralyzing Blaziken and other fast setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Salamence. It can also use the paralysis Clefable spreads to its advantage with Hex. Mega Kangaskhan appreciates Blaziken and Mega Gengar being paralyzed and greatly benefits from Healing Wish support as Double-Edge recoil can quickly wear down Mega Kangaskhan, a prime target for Rocky Helmet users. Many setup sweepers appreciate Clefable setting Stealth Rock and using Encore to buy them free turns to set up. Mega Salamence, Mega Charizard X, and Dragonite are all good examples of setup sweepers that work well with Clefable and form 2/3 of a Fairy / Dragon / Steel core. Blaziken appreciates Clefable's ability to deal with Mega Salamence. Clefable's Stealth Rock support also makes it much easier for Blaziken to sweep by breaking Focus Sashes and weakening Pokemon such as Charizard and Talonflame.</p>"

  "Cloyster": {
    "overview": "<p>Cloyster is one of the most terrifying, yet predictable, setup sweepers in the metagame, without the need to take up a Mega slot. Its colossal Defense stat, which rivals that of Mega Slowbro, along with its good offensive typing means Cloyster can set up on many physical attackers commonly seen in Battle Spot such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Dragonite. Thanks to its ability, Skill Link, Icicle Spear becomes a reliable multi-hit STAB move that allows Cloyster to easily break through Focus Sash and Substitutes. Furthermore, having access to a priority STAB attack in Ice Shard makes Cloyster rather difficult to revenge kill once it sets up and differentiates it from other common Shell Smash users such as Gorebyss and Barbaracle. However, Cloyster desperately needs a boost to become threatening, as both its Attack and Speed are below average prior to Shell Smash. Cloyster cannot afford to take any status such as a burn, which severely cripples it, and, given its abysmal HP and Special Defense stats, even resisted attacks like Scald can prove to be fatal.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute is a viable option in the last slot if you decide to forgo priority or a more reliable STAB move, as it is especially useful to avoid various status moves from defensive threats such as Hippowdon's Yawn, Ferrothorn's Leech Seed, and defensive Gyarados's Thunder Wave. Running a Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment along with a Choice Scarf allows Cloyster to outspeed Mega Gengar, which is useful because Icicle Spear has a very high chance to OHKO it with Stealth Rock on the field. Explosion is a nice option that will deal decent a amount of damage even to Steel-types, especially after a Shell Smash boost, and it can be used to exit the field if you no longer need Cloyster, allowing a teammate to come in safely. Surf and Hydro Pump are Cloyster's secondary STAB options that can be used over Razor Shell, hitting Steel-types such as Mega Mawile, Aegislash, and Klefki. Surf trades power for reliability, as opposed to Hydro Pump, which does the opposite, and a Naughty or Naive nature should be used if running either of these moves so that Cloyster's Special Attack isn't hindered, while still maximizing the damage output of Icicle Spear. Life Orb is a viable alternative that gives a substantial boost to Cloyster's attacks, allowing it to OHKO Mamoswine with Surf at +2; however, this is situational, as other items such as Lum Berry are more reliable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Bulky Steel-types such as Mega Mawile and Aegislash easily wall Cloyster and are able to retaliate with powerful STAB moves. While Mega Lucario isn't bulky, special variants are particularly threatening, being able to OHKO Cloyster with Adaptability Vacuum Wave right off the bat.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Suicune, and Mega Slowbro have an easy time beating Cloyster due to their high Defense and the ability to spread nasty status. Making these threats flinch via King's Rock is sometimes the only way to break through them.</p> <p><strong>Mamoswine: Mamoswine has Thick Fat, which reduces the damage from Icicle Spear, and takes neutral damage from Rock Blast. It can then retaliate with a powerful Earthquake. Running Razor Shell or Surf helps immensely with this, especially if Cloyster is at +2.</p> <p><strong>Blaziken</strong>: Blaziken threatens to OHKO Cloyster with its Fighting-type STAB move of choice, either High Jump Kick or Superpower, and having Speed Boost means Cloyster will be unable to outspeed it after Shell Smash unless Cloyster is running a Jolly nature and maximum Speed EVs.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Any status cripples Cloyster for the remainder of the match, although Lum Berry somewhat alleviates this problem. In particular, Rotom-W spreads burns and Thundurus threatens to OHKO Cloyster with STAB Thunderbolt while also having access to Prankster Thunder Wave. Breloom will more often than not outspeed Cloyster and can put it to sleep with Spore, which allows it to try to KO with Bullet Seed.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers: Mega Kangaskhan packs enough power and bulk to overwhelm Cloyster prior to Shell Smash, and Cloyster needs to watch out for a potential Sucker Punch. Conkeldurr's Fighting-type STAB moves hit Cloyster super effectively, and packing priority means that Cloyster will have to use Ice Shard, which fails to KO it swiftly.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Common special attackers such as Gengar, Thundurus, and Greninja with Grass Knot have the Speed to easily OHKO Cloyster with their powerful STAB attacks, unless Cloyster is holding a Focus Sash or is already boosted.</p>",

        "name": "Smash n' Sweep",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shell Smash is a must on Cloyster, boosting its offenses to dangerous levels and allowing it to sweep unprepared teams at a moment's notice. Icicle Spear is Cloyster's most powerful and reliable STAB attack, which is guaranteed to hit five times due to Skill Link, reaching 125 Base Power. This lets it easily break through Focus Sash and Substitute, as well as OHKO Intimidate users such as Salamence and Landorus-T even at -1. Rock Blast is another move that benefits from Skill Link and offers Cloyster coverage against Fire- and Ice-types such as Charizard, Volcarona, Glalie, and opposing Cloyster, while also hitting bulky Water-types that resist Icicle Spear neutrally, such as Rotom-W, Suicune, and Slowbro. These attacks are non-contact moves as well, meaning that common Rocky Helmet users such as Cresselia and Hippowdon cannot hurt Cloyster with residual damage outside of Toxic and, in Hippowdon's case, Sand Stream. Ice Shard is a STAB priority move that is very useful because Cloyster struggles to take a hit after Shell Smash's defense drops. It also helps against other priority users such as Thundurus, Talonflame, and Breloom. Alternatively, Razor Shell gives Cloyster a secondary STAB option that it can use to OHKO defensive Heatran and Mamoswine after a Shell Smash boost.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An Adamant nature along with full investment in Attack gives Cloyster maximum damage output. Cloyster is relatively flexible with the amount of Speed investment it can run; 140 EVs allow it to outspeed all the relevant threats up to Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T after a Shell Smash boost. However, 100 Speed EVs can be run if only outspeeding the base 135 Speed tier is desirable, or even 84 EVs if you only need it to outspeed Mega Gengar. The rest of the EVs go into HP, Defense, and Special Defense to increase Cloyster's overall bulk. A much simpler spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe is viable if you want Cloyster to outspeed every +1 base 100 Speed Pokemon after one Shell Smash boost; this includes common Dragon Dance users such as Mega Charizard X and Speed Boost Mega Blaziken. It also allows Cloyster to Speed tie with Adamant Breloom prior to Shell Smash. A Jolly nature with maximum Speed allows Cloyster after a Shell Smash to outspeed everything up to the base 110 Speed tier at +1, including Choice Scarf Latios, while Speed tying with maximum Speed Breloom before the boost. King's Rock is the best item on Cloyster, pairing nicely with Skill Link and Cloyster's multi-hit moves to provide a great 41% chance to make the foe flinch. Cloyster can fully take advantage of King's Rock to potentially muscle through defensive threats such as Rotom-W, Cresselia, Porygon2, and Mega Venusaur. Focus Sash means Cloyster can always survive a hit, allowing it to set up on special attackers such as Gengar and Thundurus, which would otherwise OHKO it with their STAB move of choice; however, this is normally outclassed by King's Rock's ability to immobilize slower and bulkier threats. Lum Berry is an option to allow Cloyster to set up more effectively, as it wouldn't be fearing Breloom's Spore, Hippowdon's Yawn, or Thundurus's Thunder Wave. Skill Link is chosen to guarantee Icicle Spear and Rock Blast hit five times.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Cloyster has a large enough presence at Team Preview that your opponent will think twice before sending out their physical attackers and common Ground-type leads such as Garchomp and Landorus-T, and even going up against these threats usually means a chance to boost. Therefore, you can use Team Preview to your advantage when picking your lead. With that said, Cloyster is best used as a lead, especially if it runs Focus Sash. Don't be careless by switching into Outrage and Earthquake, as both of these moves have a high chance to 2HKO it. Go for an early Shell Smash take out as many threats as possible or simply try to make them flinch before going down, and then let your team clean up. It's better to leave Cloyster for later or bench it entirely if you're against teams that have Steel- and Water-types, particularly Mega Mawile, Aegislash, Suicune, Rotom-W, and Slowbro, or against rain offense or Trick Room teams. You can afford to be more aggressive if running Substitute or Lum Berry, as it allows Cloyster to use Shell Smash much more safely against moves such as Hippowdon's Yawn, Breloom's Spore, and Suicune's Scald.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Volcarona is able to easily threaten out the Steel-types that Cloyster struggles with, such as Aegislash and Mega Mawile, while Cloyster eliminates Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon, all of which threaten Volcarona. Dual screen setters such as Klefki and Raikou are particularly helpful to Cloyster, making it extremely difficult to take down. Assault Vest Raikou can also help Cloyster by sponging nasty Electric-type attacks such as Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt, and in return Cloyster can set up on the Ground-types that Raikou doesn't like. Thunder Wave support from Thundurus is also appreciated for Cloyster due to its low Speed prior to Shell Smash. Consider Mega Charizard X when using Cloyster, as Mega Charizard X appreciates the removal of Ground- and Dragon-types, which Cloyster can set up on. Mega Gengar is great for trapping defensive walls that Cloyster might have trouble breaking through, such as Slowbro and Cresselia. Bulky Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Hippowdon help Cloyster deal with Steel-types such as Aegislash and Mega Mawile. Chansey can come in on any special attacker that may threaten Cloyster, such as Thundurus, Greninja, or Mega Charizard Y, and provide Thunder Wave support if required. Talonflame threatens Fighting-types such as Breloom and Blaziken and is able to burn Mamoswine with Will-O-Wisp. Specially defensive variants of Talonflame can also deal with Aegislash, which can easily wall Cloyster, very well. In return, Cloyster can help Talonflame remove Ground-types that it struggles with, such as Garchomp and Landorus-T. It can set up Shell Smash against these threats, as they would most likely want to get up Stealth Rock as soon as possible upon seeing both Cloyster and Talonflame in Team Preview. Heatran can take special attacks relatively well and beat Steel-types for Cloyster, while Cloyster can take Earthquake thanks to his high natural physical bulk and remove Ground-types for Heatran. Serperior can easily set up on and remove bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Rotom-W, and Slowbro and is able to spread paralysis through Glare or set up dual screens to allow Cloyster to boost more easily. Cresselia has access to Lunar Dance and other support moves such as Thunder Wave and Toxic, and it can also easily wall bulky attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Conkeldurr.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Even in a fast-paced metagame such as Battle Spot, where offensive Pokemon are heavily favored over defensive ones, Chansey still stands out as one of the best walls in the game. With stellar HP and Special Defense, Chansey is able to sponge hits and then force out powerful special attackers such as Thundurus and Volcarona. Chansey's lack of Defense is somewhat alleviated by the use of Eviolite, further improving her tanking capabilities and allowing her to beat mixed attackers such as Greninja. Chansey has access to a variety of support options that let her assist her team, such as Thunder Wave to spread status onto the opposing team, and Chansey can absorb incoming status as well thanks to Natural Cure. Unfortunately, Chansey's passive nature leaves her vulnerable to Taunt users, and with only base 35 Special Attack, Chansey cannot properly make use of coverage moves, meaning that most Ghost-types are able to completely wall her. As Chansey is outclassed by Blissey without Eviolite, she is very vulnerable to moves like Knock Off and Trick, which will severely cripple her ability to sponge hits. Mega Gengar can take advantage of this and trap Chansey, knowing that she will almost never hold Leftovers or Shed Shell over Eviolite.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is useful for breaking Focus Sash and can be used over Thunder Wave or Toxic if your team needs an entry hazard setter. Psychic prevents Chansey being completely walled by Gengar and will do decent amounts of damage to Fighting-types such as Breloom. Shadow Ball helps Chansey against Gengar and Aegislash, and it also happens to have more PP than Psychic, which is helpful due to Chansey's low Special Attack. Skill Swap can be used to gain momentum by stealing abilities such as Magic Bounce, Shadow Tag, and Prankster. It also helps cripple Suicune, Sylveon, and Gliscor by robbing them of their useful abilities. Counter is another option for Chansey to deal with physical attackers such as Garchomp and Mega Charizard X when they lock themselves into Outrage. Protect can be used along with Toxic to help rack up extra chip damage. Aromatherapy is an option for Chansey, as her phenomenal bulk makes her a decent cleric, but it isn't too common due to her other moves being more useful most of the time. Wish is a nice support move with Chansey's massive HP but is extremely difficult to acquire, as Chansey only has access to this move in the third generation.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Talonflame: With access to both Taunt and Roost, Talonflame poses a huge threat to Chansey and can quickly rack up Swords Dance boosts against her.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Due to Mega Sableye's access to Magic Bounce, Chansey cannot touch it at all unless running both Skill Swap and Toxic. Otherwise, Mega Sableye can freely set up Calm Mind on Chansey without much to fear.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Chansey relies on her non-attacking moves to fulfill her role and is very vulnerable to Taunt due to her low Speed. Be aware of special attackers that might carry Taunt, such as Serperior and Thundurus.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick Users: Common Knock Off users such as Mega Mawile, Scizor, and Conkeldurr will severely cripple Chansey's ability to tank, as she is heavily dependent on Eviolite. Trick users such as Rotom-W, Latios, and Gothitelle, the latter of which can trap and eliminate Chansey, not only rob Chansey of her Eviolite but also cripple her for the rest of the match.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users: Common setup sweepers and Mega Evolutions such as Mega Alakazam, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gyarados sometimes carry Substitute to avoid status ailments; Gyarados may even have Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Despite Chansey's tanking capabilities, she is unable to take powerful Fighting-type STAB attacks from foes such as Blaziken and Heracross. Heracross doesn't even mind status ailments much thanks to Guts.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash: Aegislash can threaten Chansey by virtue of its typing. Variants with Toxic and Substitute are especially dangerous, as due to Chansey's low Speed, Aegislash will be able to easily stall her out.</p> <p><strong>OHKO Moves</strong>: Chansey is very vulnerable to OHKO moves, as she cannot be taken out easily by other means due to having reliable recovery and excellent bulk. Pokemon with access to OHKO moves such as Gliscor, Mamoswine, Excadrill, Glalie, and Suicune have a chance to eliminate Chansey instantly.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar: Being a Ghost-type with access to Perish Song and Taunt, Mega Gengar is able to trap Chansey and then KO her through Perish Song or Struggle recoil depending on which move it's running, and due to Chansey's low Special Attack, she won't even be able to 3HKO Mega Gengar even with Psychic.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Seismic Toss is Chansey's only way of dealing damage outside of Toxic and is useful as chip damage in order to break Substitutes; it is also Chansey's only usable move after being hit by Taunt. Soft-Boiled serves as Chansey's only means of recovery, instantly recovering 50% of Chansey's HP and helping her stay alive for as long as possible. Thunder Wave lets Chansey cripple faster foes that can potentially sweep your team such as powerful Dragon Dance users, which include the likes of Mega Charizard X and Mega Salamence. Toxic is extremely useful when breaking down more defensively oriented foes that won't be worn down by Seismic Toss due to their access to reliable recovery, such as Porygon2 and Slowbro. Swagger is an option over Toxic, as the combination of the two statuses will give the foe only a 37.5% chance to retaliate per turn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>As Chansey is always used as a reliable switch-in for Greninja, it is a good idea to invest 44 EVs in HP to allow Chansey to survive two Gunk Shots from neutral-natured maximum Attack Greninja. Maximum investment in Defense with the remaining EVs in Special Defense makes the most use of Eviolite. Due to the uneven distribution between Chansey's defensive stats, investing in HP is generally not efficient, but it is an option to survive certain attacks. For example, running 152 HP EVs helps Chansey tank a +1 Outrage from Adamant Mega Charizard X and avoid the 2HKO from Adamant Garchomp's Outrage. A Bold nature should always be used to somewhat patch up Chansey's terrible Defense, as she already has sufficient Special Defense. Eviolite is required to allow Chansey to take both physical and special hits better. Natural Cure allows Chansey to absorb status ailments for the team, immediately healing Chansey after she switches out.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Considering that Chansey can take any special attack with ease, she should be sent in on Pokemon such as Greninja, Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Mega Gardevoir to sponge powerful STAB moves that her teammates cannot afford to take. At the same time, Chansey must be wary of special attackers that could carry Taunt or Trick such as Serperior, Rotom-W, and Latios. Chansey is an excellent status absorber thanks to Natural Cure, which removes status ailments inflicted by the likes of Scald, Thunder Wave, and Toxic that would otherwise cripple your team's sweeper. Always scout for potential Knock Off users with your Mega Evolution so that Chansey will not lose her ability to tank hits for your team. If running Swagger, it is a relatively a safe option for Chansey to use because she is usually sent in on powerful special attackers and therefore doesn't have to fear a powerful physical attack; the chip damage from the foe hurting itself will also be extremely useful for taking it down. Using Swagger can help Chansey overcome Calm Mind users such as Suicune and Sylveon, which cannot be worn down with Toxic due to their access to Rest and Heal Bell. With a bit of luck on your side, Swagger can even be used to take down Aegislash variants lacking Substitute.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Both Slowbro and Mega Slowbro are fantastic partners that can form a solid defensive core with Chansey due to Slowbro's ability to take on powerful Fighting-types with ease while also dispatching Talonflame, which would otherwise be a huge threat to Chansey. Gliscor really enjoys Thunder Wave support from Chansey so that it can take advantage of slower foes by freely setting up Substitute and proceed to threaten the opposing team with Guillotine. In return, Chansey can help take special attacks such as Scald and Ice Beam without having much worry of being burned or frozen due to Natural Cure. Bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn can form an effective core with Slowbro and Chansey; they all have access to some form of recovery, which allows them to wear down each other's checks and counters through residual damage by forcing constant switches. Powerful wallbreakers such as Heracross and Mega Heracross appreciate paralysis support from Chansey, as they are often outsped and taken out before being able to deal massive damage to the opposing team. As Mega Sableye really struggles to deal with Fairy-types, Chansey can help with removing them due to her ability to come in on most Fairy-type attacks, such as Mega Gardevoir's Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice. Due to Skarmory's high Defense and superb defensive typing, it is an excellent partner for Chansey, taking on physical attackers that threaten her. Mega Gengar can trap opposing Chansey on stall teams and cripple physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp. Despite stacking a Fighting-type weakness with Chansey, Tyranitar is a decent partner for its ability to Pursuit trap Mega Gengar and potential Trick users such as Latios.</p>"

        "name": "Minimize",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Seismic Toss is required in order to deal meaningful damage, as Chansey lacks the offensive stats to make good use of her other attacking options. Soft-Boiled provides reliable recovery that, along with Chansey's superb bulk and decent typing, gives her more chances to set up and increases her longevity. Along with some investment in Speed, Minimize allows Chansey to gain evasion boosts against slower foes, which will make her extremely hard to take down due to her reliable recovery and excellent bulk. Substitute works well with Chansey's ability to absorb weaker special attacks, easing setup, blocking status moves from slower foes such as Ferrothorn's Thunder Wave and Leech Seed, and, most importantly, allowing Chansey to stall out users of OHKO moves, which are threatening because they ignore evasion boosts. Both Thunder Wave and Toxic are viable options over Substitute, though, as the former gives Chansey the ability to move first, which is useful when setting up, and the latter helps wear the foe down while Chansey continues to grab evasion boosts; it is also helpful to have another source of damage besides Seismic Toss.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Running maximum Speed investment with a positive nature is recommended on this set, as it gives Chansey more opportunities to set up against slower foes such as uninvested Cresselia, Mega Venusaur, and Suicune. The rest of the EVs are allocated to Defense to allow Chansey to take physical hits better, as she has a rather low physical bulk. A Bold nature with an EV spread of 252 Def / 252 SpD / 4 Spe can also be used but is not recommended, as Chansey then loses the ability to outspeed many defensive threats. Eviolite boosts Chansey's overall bulk by 1.5x and is required for her to set up and tank hits properly. Natural Cure allows Chansey to recover from status ailments if the foe is faster. The ability is also useful for scouting purposes, allowing you to find out whether Pokemon such as Venusaur are running any Speed investment.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Chansey should be sent out on potential slower leads such as Ferrothorn, Hippowdon, and Skarmory for a chance to set up at the start of the match, but you must watch out for potential phazing moves such as Whirlwind. With maximum Speed and a Timid nature, Chansey can set up on faster foes with no Speed investment such as Cresselia, Venusaur, and Suicune. Substitute should always be used before setting up with Minimize, as it blocks potential Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Leech Seed while also protecting Chansey from Scald burns and OHKO moves. If the bulkier spread with a Bold nature is used, Chansey will force out a lot of special attackers such as Greninja, Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Sylveon and can find opportunities to set up. Never send Chansey in on a potential Knock Off and always scout for Trick on the likes of Rotom-W and Latios, as without Eviolite, Chansey becomes very physically frail.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to their immense physical bulk and access to reliable recovery, Slowbro and Mega Slowbro are excellent partners for Chansey, being able to deal with Fighting-types such as Blaziken as well as Talonflame. Gliscor can help Chansey wear down physical attackers such as Garchomp and Landorus-T by spreading Toxic so that Chansey can take advantage of her bulk to stall out the foes. Suicune is a nice partner because Chansey can set up on powerful Grass- and Electric-types such as Venusaur and Mega Manectric, two of Suicune's biggest threats. Tyranitar helps Chansey eliminate Gengar and Talonflame with Pursuit trapping and its powerful STAB moves, respectively; however, you should be aware that the residual damage from sand also wears down Chansey considerably due to her lack of Leftovers. Mega Evolutions such as Mega Salamence, Mega Scizor, and Mega Venusaur can switch into a predicted Knock Off or Trick, while Chansey can take powerful special attacks that threaten them in return. Both Klefki and Thundurus have access to Prankster Thunder Wave, which helps with spreading paralysis so that Chansey can set up Substitute on faster foes. Stallbreakers like Gliscor, Mega Gengar, and Talonflame can use Taunt to prevent foes from using Substitute and phazing moves such as Roar and Whirlwind; Talonflame also appreciates Chansey's ability to take on bulky Water-types such as Suicune. Mega Gengar can also trap and eliminate opposing Chansey as well as threaten Unaware Clefable with STAB Sludge Bomb.</p>"

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "overview": "<p>Behold what may be the biggest threat in Battle Spot Singles! Parental Bond lets Mega Kangaskhan rise to stardom, allowing her to attack twice per turn, effectively giving her a free 50% boost to her Attack and other bonuses such as the ability to blast through Focus Sashes and Substitutes! Mega Kangaskhan also has a superb stat spread that gives her not only great offensive presence but also good Speed and defenses that make OHKOing Mega Kangaskhan a difficult task. Even with a mediocre Normal typing, Mega Kangaskhan makes full use of it with her powerful STAB moves and only has a sole weakness to Fighting. What truly takes Mega Kangaskhan to the next level is her amazing movepool. Mega Kangaskhan's offensive movepool is extremely varied, giving her a tactic around almost all of her checks!</p> <p>Mega Kangaskhan's only major flaw is that she is such a huge threat that almost every team has a battle plan against her. Teams will use things such as Rocky Helmet, Will-O-Wisp, and even specific Pokemon such as Porygon2 and bulky Serperior for the purpose of checking Mega Kangaskhan. While Mega Kangaskhan is incredibly difficult to directly check, she can certainly be worn down by a whole team. With so many teams being well prepared against Mega Kangaskhan, you may end up benching her from battles more often than you'd expect. Even with a metagame that attempts to be as hostile to Mega Kangaskhan as possible, however, she is still one of the most defining Pokemon of Battle Spot Singles, because any team that fails to prepare for Mega Kangaskhan is doomed to fail!</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Kangaskhan may have a paltry base 60 Special Attack, but thanks to Parental Bond, a specially based set is viable. Shadow Ball 2HKOes unsuspecting Mega Gengar, Fire Blast roasts Ferrothorn, and Ice Beam and Blizzard can get around Garchomp's Rough Skin and Salamence's Intimidate.</p> <p>Low Kick grabs an easy OHKO on Tyranitar and deals serious damage to Air Balloon Heatran, Ferrothorn, and opposing Mega Kangaskhan. Stomp, while weak, gives Mega Kangaskhan a 51% chance to induce flinches and punishes Chansey and Starmie for using Minimize. Hammer Arm gives Mega Kangaskhan extra coverage against Steel-types, but the Speed drop makes it only useful against Trick Room teams. Drain Punch can restore some of Mega Kangaskhan's health, but it's too weak to do much else. Disable, when paired with Substitute, can ruin an offensive Pokemon's chance at defeating Mega Kangaskhan. Inner Focus, while usually inferior to Scrappy, can be used to hit opposing Mega Kangaskhan through their Fake Out.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chip Damage: Rocky Helmet users such as Suicune, Hippowdon, Cresselia, Zapdos, and Ferrothorn (which has Iron Barbs as well) will rapidly wear down Mega Kangaskhan due to Parental Bond and her high use of contact moves. Garchomp takes a huge amount of damage switching in, but Rough Skin itself will take a toll on Mega Kangaskhan, especially if Garchomp is wearing a Rocky Helmet.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types:: Fighting-types such as Blaziken, Choice Scarf Heracross, Mega Lucario, and Mega Lopunny are unable to switch into Mega Kangaskhan, but they can revenge kill her with their STAB Fighting-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Porygon2: Porygon2 takes a huge amount of damage from boosted attacks but can deal considerable damage with Foul Play, which also receives a Parental Bond boost thanks to Trace.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar can play mind games before Mega Evolving thanks to Levitate. With Will-O-Wisp and Levitate, Gengar is immune to entire Mega Kangaskhan sets and can easily cripple her with Will-O-Wisp. Mega Gengar gets hit by Earthquake, but it is still a big threat due to Will-O-Wisp and Shadow Tag.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye, in addition to being immune to Normal-type moves, has decent bulk and can burn Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Without Facade, Mega Kangaskhan becomes utterly crippled when burned. Common users of Will-O-Wisp include Rotom-W, Gengar, and Talonflame.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Sweeper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thanks to Parental Bond, Power-Up Punch hits twice, letting Mega Kangaskhan double her Attack with just one use. Double-Edge is Mega Kangaskhan's hard-hitting STAB move, giving her great offensive presence before a boost and serious wallbreaking power after a boost. However, if you are worried about Mega Kangaskhan getting worn down by the recoil, you can opt to use Return at the cost of making Mega Kangaskhan more reliant on boosting. Sucker Punch gives Mega Kangaskhan a useful priority attack, allowing her to pick off weakened faster threats and even potentially sweep through battle-worn teams. Just note that Sucker Punch can result in mind games due to its failure against Pokemon using support moves.</p> <p>Earthquake is the most reliable option for the last moveslot, allowing Mega Kangaskhan to slam Steel- and Rock-types and avoid recoil from Garchomp, Ferrothorn, and Rocky Helmet users. Rock Slide doesn't offer great coverage compared to Earthquake, but in exchange, it lets Mega Kangaskhan hit Gengar and Ground-immune Rocky Helmet users such as Zapdos and Cresselia. With the help of Parental Bond, Rock Slide also has a 51% chance to cause the foe to flinch! Finally, Substitute can be used with a bulkier EV spread to allow Mega Kangaskhan to muscle through some of her defensive checks. Even against offensive Pokemon, Substitute can make Mega Kangaskhan extremely difficult to check, as playing around Sucker Punch becomes more difficult. Secret Power offers no additional coverage and is rather weak, but its 51% chance of paralysis and ability to avoid Rocky Helmet damage can make it a good move to pair with Double-Edge.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Jolly is the preferred nature for sweeping, as it allows Mega Kangaskhan to outspeed threats such as Landorus-T and Hydreigon as well as Lucario and Kangaskhan before they have Mega Evolved. However, Adamant allows Mega Kangaskhan to be a bigger threat early in the game, as she is thus less reliant on boosting. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs are preferred for maximum sweeping power, while the 4 Special Defense EVs ensure that Porygon2 will not get a Special Attack boost.</p> <p>Scrappy is the preferred base ability for Kangaskhan. This allows her to hit Ghost-types before Mega Evolving. This is especially important against Gengar, which is a common switch-in to Mega Kangaskhan. Scrappy also allows Kangaskhan to use Power-Up Punch on Aegislash switch-ins, letting her OHKO Aegislash with a +1 Earthquake after Mega Evolving.</p> <p>If using Substitute, consider a bulkier EV spread of 132 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 116 Spe with an Adamant nature. This allows Mega Kangaskhan to survive some impressive attacks, such as Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor, +2 Aegislash's Flash Cannon, Landorus-T's Superpower, and Choice Band Garchomp's Outrage. The Speed EVs are designed to let Mega Kangaskhan outspeed Breloom. Thanks to the HP EVs, Mega Kangaskhan also takes less damage from Rocky Helmet, allowing her to take on Cresselia, Suicune, and defensive Rotom-W more easily.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If using Mega Kangaskhan early-game, try to focus on attacking the foe instead of setting up. This is a particularly effective tactic against offensive teams, because even if Mega Kangaskhan goes down early, the amount of damage she will have dealt can open up holes for teammates to sweep. Setting up early may seem appealing, but most teams will have offensive checks that can cut Mega Kangaskhan's sweep short. If your strategy requires Mega Kangaskhan to last longer, focus on using non-contact moves such as Earthquake and Rock Slide early on, as one of the most common responses to Mega Kangaskhan is to switch in a defensive Rocky Helmet Pokemon. Common Rocky Helmet Pokemon to watch out for include Suicune, Cresselia, Zapdos, Talonflame, Gyarados, Hippowdon, Garchomp, Ferrothorn, and Serperior.</p> <p>When planning to sweep with Mega Kangaskhan, focus on softening her defensive checks such as Cresselia, Suicune, and Porygon2. Doing this can allow Mega Kangaskhan to smash through them with a boosted Double-Edge or Return, leading to a potential sweep!</p> <p>Usually, it is better to Mega Evolve Kangaskhan on the first turn, as the Speed boost allows her to outspeed important threats such as Hydreigon and positive-natured Lucario. However, if you are facing Gengar or Aegislash, holding off on Mega Evolution can actually be a good idea. Thanks to Scrappy, Kangaskhan can hit Gengar before she Mega Evolves with Return or Double-Edge, making it a less reliable check. As for Aegislash, using Power-Up Punch as it switches in can allow Kangaskhan to OHKO it with Earthquake after Mega Evolution!</p> <p>During Team Preview, if you notice that your opponent's team is packed with defensive Mega Kangaskhan checks such as Porygon2, Cresselia, and Suicune or contains offensive checks such as Blaziken and Terrakion, don't be afraid to bench Kangaskhan if you feel like other Pokemon provide a better matchup. Mega Kangaskhan may be extremely dangerous, but even she can't bust through an entire team on her own.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rocky Helmet Pokemon such as Suicune, Cresselia, and Hippowdon are huge problems for Mega Kangaskhan, as their good bulk and the residual damage can stop her from sweeping. Knock Off can get rid of their main source of residual damage, with good users including Blaziken, Conkeldurr, and Azumarill. Tricking Choice items onto them can also cripple them. Rotom-W and Rotom-H are the best Pokemon for this job, while Togekiss can Trick them a Choice Scarf as well. Finally, residual damage from sources such as Stealth Rock can weaken foes enough to put them into Mega Kangaskhan's KO range, which can help in avoiding further chip damage from Rocky Helmet. Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Swampert are particularly good users of Stealth Rock.</p> <p>While using more than one Mega Evolution may seem like a waste of a teamslot, it can work well in Mega Kangaskhan's case provided that they cover Pokemon that give her issues. Mega Gengar is the perfect example of this, as it has Shadow Tag to trap many of Kangaskhan's defensive checks and counters. Mega Charizard X is also a good choice, as it can set up on Suicune and Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Finally, one notable strategy is pairing Mega Kangaskhan with Lunar Dance Cresselia or Healing Wish Latias. These moves can bring Mega Kangaskhan back from the brink of being KOed, giving her another chance to sweep!</p>"

        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Double-Edge's absurd power is well worth the recoil. Sucker Punch gives Mega Kangaskhan a valuable priority move to pick off weakened foes and lets Mega Kangaskhan clean through weakened, faster foes such as Garchomp and Mega Salamence. Earthquake gives Mega Kangaskhan coverage against common Steel- and Rock-types such as Aegislash and Tyranitar.</p> <p>The last moveslot is an incredibly diverse toss-up. Fake Out is a great option that gives Kangaskhan a turn to Mega Evolve without worrying about its starting Speed and can wear down foes into revenge KO range. Rock Slide allows Mega Kangaskhan to dodge Rocky Helmet damage and has a 51% chance to cause the foe to flinch your foes. Ice Punch OHKOes Garchomp and does a huge amount of damage to Mega Salamence, while Fire Punch grabs an OHKO on Ferrothorn and a 2HKO on Skarmory. Facade may not offer any additional coverage, but it ruins teams that rely on Will-O-Wisp to defeat Mega Kangaskhan. While Crunch may seem inferior to Sucker Punch, being able to attack even if a foe uses a support move or switches makes it a valuable tool against Gengar. Finally, Secret Power, while weak, avoids Rocky Helmet damage and gives Mega Kangaskhan a 51% chance to paralyze her foes.</p> <p>If you wish, you can get rid of Earthquake to free up another moveslot. However, this makes Substitute Aegislash a much more serious issue. You may also replace Sucker Punch with Fake Out. While getting rid of Sucker Punch reduces Mega Kangaskhan's cleaning potential, it does allow room for more reliable coverage moves.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs are recommended to maximize Mega Kangaskhan's offensive presence, while 4 Special Defense EVs ensure that Porygon2 will not get a Special Attack boost from Download. Scrappy is the best ability for Kangaskhan, as it allows her to hit Ghost-types before Mega Evolving, which is especially important against Gengar switch-ins.</p> <p>Choosing between an Adamant nature and a Jolly nature can be a difficult decision. Going with an Adamant nature maximizes Mega Kangaskhan's offensive power; it is especially recommended if using Fake Out, as the extra chip damage can be game winning. A Jolly nature, on the other hand, allows Mega Kangaskhan to outspeed Adamant Mega Kangaskhan, Landorus-T, and Lucario before it Mega Evolves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Usually, you'll want to Mega Evolve Kangaskhan as soon as possible for the extra Speed. This is especially true if your Mega Kangaskhan has Fake Out, as this move will grant her a free turn to Mega Evolve. The main exception to this rule is when facing Gengar. Hitting Gengar on the switch with Double-Edge before Mega Evolving can ruin its plans to cripple Mega Kangaskhan with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Mega Kangaskhan works in every stage of the game, but your strategy should change depending on what stage of the game you want to use her. If you plan on using Mega Kangaskhan early in the game, use her to try to weaken the foes for another teammate to sweep. This is usually a good tactic against offensive teams, where sacrificing Mega Kangaskhan may not be as big of a deal. If you want Mega Kangaskhan to last longer, avoid using contact moves such as Double-Edge. This lets you scout for Rocky Helmet switch-ins.</p> <p>If you plan on using Mega Kangaskhan late-game, try to clean up the weakened team with Double-Edge and Sucker Punch. This is the tactic to use if you see a team with bulky Pokemon such as Porygon2, Cresselia, Hippowdon, and Suicune, as these Pokemon will check Mega Kangaskhan when they are healthy.</p> <p>If your opponent has a team full of Mega Kangaskhan checks, it may be wise to bench Mega Kangaskhan. While Mega Kangaskhan is one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the game, even she won't be able to overcome a team designed to check her!</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>By far the biggest issues are defensive Rocky Helmet Pokemon, which can take advantage of Parental Bond and force Mega Kangaskhan to lose significant portions of her health. Common Rocky Helmet users include Suicune, Cresselia, Gyarados, Hippowdon, Zapdos, Talonflame, and Serperior. Especially watch out for Rocky Helmet Garchomp and Ferrothorn, which take away over half of Mega Kangaskhan's health if she makes contact! Getting rid of Rocky Helmets can be a big help. Trick Rotom-W with Choice Scarf or Choice Specs can cripple most defensive Pokemon, while Blaziken and Conkeldurr can use Knock Off to get rid of Rocky Helmets, and they can also defeat Porygon2 with their Fighting-type STAB moves. Nasty Plot Thundurus also deserves a special mention for being able to get surprise sweeps on these defensive Pokemon.</p> <p>Another big problem for Mega Kangaskhan is offensive Fighting-type Pokemon such as Blaziken, Choice Scarf Heracross, and Mega Lopunny, which outspeed and OHKO her. Pokemon that resist Fighting are an excellent answer to this problem. Cresselia and Latias are excellent choices, especially because they can use Lunar Dance or Healing Wish to heal up Mega Kangaskhan. Talonflame is a more offensive answer, smacking Fighting-types with priority Brave Bird. Landorus-T works well too, thanks to its great ability, Intimidate.</p> <p>Mega Kangaskhan is great at dealing quick, small-risk damage thanks to Fake Out and punching holes through a team thanks to Double-Edge. This makes fast, powerful sweepers such as Talonflame, Blaziken, Greninja, and Thundurus good teammates. They can also take Will-O-Wisps that threaten to cripple Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <p>Another good teammate for Mega Kangaskhan is Baton Pass Blaziken. Blaziken can use Speed Boost and Bulk Up or Swords Dance to pass on boosts to Mega Kangaskhan. With Speed and Attack boosts, Mega Kangaskhan can become almost unstoppable!</p> <p>Most Battle Spot teams will have a game plan against Mega Kangaskhan, so running backup Mega Pokemon can be a good tactic against well-prepared teams. Mega Gengar is an excellent choice, being able to check Mega Kangaskhan's defensive checks thanks to Shadow Tag. Meanwhile, Mega Charizard X is able to use Mega Kangaskhan checks such as Suicune and Ferrothorn as setup fodder.</p>"

  "Ditto": {
    "overview": "<p>Ditto has a very unique ability in Imposter, which allows it to copy any Pokemon, stat boosts and all, making it one of the best revenge killers in the metagame. Ditto is capable of turning games around by preventing opponents from winning with most setup sweepers. Ditto also works extremely well with the move Swagger, copying the +2 Attack boost from opposing physical attackers; it copies all the boosts from the foe but none of the status the opposing Pokemon may have. This makes running Swagger much less risky and a legitimate strategy. However, Ditto isn't always good against certain teams, especially defensive ones, which don't have many Pokemon that Ditto will benefit from copying. It also needs to paralyze the foe if it's not running Choice Scarf to avoid Speed tying with it, so it's not always reliable against Ground-types, such as Garchomp and Mamoswine. Ditto also has a very poor HP stat; as this is the only stat Ditto doesn't copy from the foe, it's usually very frail.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Lum Berry helps Ditto avoid status like Thunder Wave, which would heavily cripple Ditto after it copies a setup sweeper. If you want a higher damage output, Life Orb could be used; it is especially useful when Ditto may need to copy a special attacker. However, both of these items rely on paralyzing whatever Ditto copies to avoid Speed ties and, unlike Focus Sash, cause Ditto to have nothing to fall back on if it loses the tie. If flexibility is required and you really want Focus Sash on a different teammate, you can gamble with Quick Claw, which is very inconsistent and usually not recommended. Other Hidden Power types may be useful, such as Fire and Ground; these can be decided based on your team if you feel you may need one of these coverage options in some scenarios. Though Metal Powder and Quick Powder may look tempting when you read their descriptions, they should never be used because they only work when Ditto isn't transformed, which you never want to happen anyway.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute is Ditto's worst nightmare, as it blocks Imposter. Setup sweepers utilizing Substitute, such as Mega Salamence, can be a big problem if not dealt with by Ditto's teammates.</p> <p><strong>Illusion: Although it is very uncommon, Illusion also blocks Imposter, and Ditto users should be wary of this when seeing Zoroark in Team Preview.</p> <p><strong>Ditto: Opposing Ditto are an annoyance, as Imposter won't work on them even when they've transformed into another Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Defensive Pokemon, such as Porygon2, Cresselia, and Slowbro, often won't be useful to copy and can easily stall out Ditto's low-PP moves with recovery.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind: Pokemon that utilize Calm Mind, such as Sylveon, Suicune, and Mega Sableye, are setup sweepers that Ditto often won't benefit from copying because of the boost to their Special Defense. They can keep setting up even when Ditto has come in and will usually come out on top.</p> <p><strong>Thunder Wave: Depending on what Ditto copies, Thunder Wave can slow it down to make it easier to kill, stopping a potential sweep. Pokemon with Prankster, such as Thundurus and Klefki, are especially threatening, as they are able to move before Ditto even if it has a Choice Scarf or a copied Speed boost.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Pokemon with powerful priority attacks, such as Mega Mawile, Azumarill, Mamoswine, and Talonflame, can finish off a weakened Ditto before it has the chance to move.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Transform is the only move Ditto has. Normally, Ditto copies the foe's moveset, so its lack of a movepool doesn't hinder it much. The only use Transform will have is preventing Ditto from instantly having to Struggle if Imposter fails.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Imposter allows Ditto to transform into the foe instantly. Maximum HP investment is used because it's the only stat Ditto doesn't copy. Other EVs aren't necessary, as Ditto will always copy the other stats from the foe. A Sassy nature is used so that Download will always give Porygon2 an Attack boost. Minimum Speed IVs help Ditto deal with Pokemon with Intimidate; when Ditto is outsped by the foe, Intimidate will activate before Imposter, so Ditto will lose the Attack drop when it transforms. For IVs, Ditto should usually run an IV spread of 31 / 31 / 30 / 31 / 30 / 0, which will give it Hidden Power Rock. Rock is usually the most useful Hidden Power, as it hits the most common users of Hidden Power, Thundurus and Volcarona, super effectively. Alternatively, an IV spread of 31 / 31 / 31 / 31 / 31 / 0 can be used to get Hidden Power Ice, which is super effective against many targets, such as Garchomp and Mega Salamence. Focus Sash is used because it allows for more flexibility; ideally, the foes Ditto copies will be paralyzed, so it won't have to rely on a Speed tie. However, if it does need to rely on a Speed tie, Focus Sash ensures it will survive at least one hit. Choice Scarf can be used if Ditto needs to outspeed what it copies all the time, but that locks it into one move, which can sometimes make it easier to play around.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Ditto should come in on physical attackers that have been hit with Swagger and attempt to sweep or heavily weaken the opponent's team. Ideally, you want to paralyze the Pokemon you use Swagger on before Ditto comes in so it can avoid Speed ties. Ditto can also be used to revenge kill setup sweepers, such as Garchomp and Mega Salamence, as Focus Sash will let it survive any hit if necessary, allowing it to take out the opposing threat. If it runs Choice Scarf, it becomes a much more effective revenge killer, always outspeeding opposing setup sweepers. Ditto will likely dissuade opponents from using setup sweepers, which can be used to your advantage when deciding what three Pokemon to bring. Ditto shouldn't be brought against very defensive teams because it often won't be useful. Ditto is best used against offensive teams with threatening physical attackers that it can benefit from copying.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Ditto should always be used with Prankster users carrying Swagger, as it is most useful when copying boosted physical attackers. Thundurus is arguably the best user of Swagger and is a good Pokemon overall. Outside of Swagger, Thundurus can use its Electric- and Ice-type coverage to take care of many threats such as Talonflame and Mega Salamence. Klefki is another reliable user of Swagger; it is much more dedicated to using Swagger, utilizing Substitute and Foul Play as well as its great typing. Liepard also makes for a great teammate not only because it has Prankster and Swagger but also because it works well with the common Spore + Assist strategy. Because Assist can't use Transform, Liepard can reliably get Spore from Assist. This strategy also runs Breloom as a third partner to complete the core and provide Spore that Liepard can use via Assist. Serperior can paralyze Ground-types, such as Garchomp and Landorus-T, so that Ditto doesn't have to rely on Speed ties when copying them. Clefable can be used as another backup Pokemon to deal with Pokemon hit by Swagger thanks to Unaware ignoring all boosts. If Ditto is running Focus Sash, Clefable is a more reliable answer to Pokemon that haven't been paralyzed. Mega Gengar can be a useful teammate, being able to trap Pokemon that Ditto won't want to copy, such as Cresselia. Mega Kangaskhan can be used as a cleaner after Ditto has weakened opposing teams after copying a boosted Pokemon. It is also a very reliable Pokemon you can use in matchups where you don't want to bring Ditto. Porygon2 and Cresselia can also spread paralysis reliably thanks to their bulk; they can also deal with Ground-types, such as Garchomp and Landorus-T, which are riskier for Ditto to copy. However, they don't synergize as well with Ditto as other paralysis spreaders because they often can't fit Swagger onto a moveset, unlike Thundurus and Klefki.</p>"

Sheer Cold makes Articuno one of the most terrifying stallbreakers in the game, allowing it to run through defensive staples such as Cresselia, Suicune, Porygon2, Slowbro, and Chansey. Articuno is very bulky for an OHKO move user, and access to Roost lets it stick around longer than other users of Sheer Cold such as Lapras and Glalie. Pressure makes Articuno an effective stall Pokemon itself, making it very usable on both stall and balanced teams. Finally, Articuno has some decent STAB moves in Freeze-Dry, which also allows it to hit Water-types, and Hurricane.</p> <p>Articuno sounds like it should be a Battle Spot Singles staple on paper, but in reality the only thing that makes it a rather niche Pokemon is its absolutely atrocious typing. It has a crippling 4x weakness to Rock-type attacks, severely compromising its ability to deal with physical attackers, as prominent ones such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Breloom, Tyranitar, and Hippowdon all carry Rock-type attacks, and Stealth Rock is sometimes seen on offensive teams as well. Its additional weaknesses to Steel and Fire make it even more vulnerable to common Pokemon such as Blaziken, Talonflame, Aegislash, and Heatran. Articuno's middling Speed makes it only a bit faster than Dragonite, meaning it has to choose between being fast and compromising bulk and being outsped by Pokemon such as Breloom and Gyarados. While Sheer Cold might be Articuno's selling point, Articuno also tends to rely on it a lot, which makes Articuno deadweight if it uses up Sheer Cold's meager PP and tends to make offensive teams very problematic for Articuno due to the move's 70% miss rate.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mind Reader might seem like a terrific idea because it guarantees that Sheer Cold hits, but its effects go away when Pokemon switch out, meaning that it's only particularly useful against a final Pokemon. Rest and Sleep Talk together rid Articuno of its problems with status moves, but the possibility of Sleep Talk choosing a bad move makes Articuno rather vulnerable. Reflect allows Articuno to soak physical attackers more easily, but it's a difficult move to fit in. Toxic is nice for wearing down defensive Pokemon, but it conflicts with Sheer Cold. Hail and Snow Cloak together can make Articuno difficult to hit (especially in conjunction with Double Team), but Pressure is just too good of an ability to give up.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire allows Articuno to deal decent damage to Steel-types, while Hidden Power Ground hits Magnezone and Heatran hard. However, getting a good Hidden Power on Articuno is an extremely difficult task. Ice Beam has more power than Freeze-Dry, but losing out on Water-type coverage is just too big of a sacrifice for Articuno. U-turn lets Articuno scout in switch-ins, but Ice Shard and Ancient Power are usually more useful, and U-turn is extremely risky if Stealth Rock is set up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Sturdy Steel-types: Magnezone is immune to Sheer Cold thanks to Sturdy, and it resists Articuno's entire moveset, making it the best Articuno counter in the game. Skarmory only has to worry about a 3HKO from Freeze-Dry or a 2HKO from a rare offensive Ice Beam. Otherwise, Sturdy makes it immune to Sheer Cold. While very rare, Steelix also has Sturdy before Mega Evolving and can smash through Articuno with Rock- and Steel-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Rock Blast Users: Mega Heracross is OHKOed by Hurricane, but it otherwise defeats Substitute Articuno by OHKOing it with Rock Blast. If Cloyster has its Focus Sash intact, it can also OHKO Articuno through its Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar: Tyranitar walls Articuno thanks to Sand Stream, and it easily OHKOes with any Rock-type move. However, Tyranitar must watch out for Roost, Substitute, and Pressure outstalling its Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Attacks</strong>: Articuno's 4x weakness to Rock-type moves is devastating, and plenty of Pokemon that are faster than Articuno have access to them. Excadrill, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Breloom depending on Articuno's Speed all OHKO. Note that while these often carry Focus Sash, Ice-type moves will outright OHKO Garchomp and Landorus-T, making them unsafe switch-ins.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types such as Aegislash, Heatran, Mega Mawile, Ferrothorn, Scizor, Mega Lucario, and Mega Metagross all hit Articuno very hard and, with the exception of Mega Lucario, they are usually bulky enough to take Hurricane. Aegislash and Heatran can use Substitute and King's Shield or Protect to tank Sheer Cold.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Entei stands out as a good Fire-type check to Articuno due to its special bulk. Mega Charizard X and Y and Talonflame do fine as long as they avoid the rare Ancient Power, while Blaziken and Volcarona can roast Articuno as long as they don't switch into Hurricane. Note that their effectiveness goes down if Articuno is paired with Politoed (except for Mega Charizard Y).</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: With the exception of Electric-types weak to Freeze Dry such as Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Zapdos, most Electric-types only have to worry about Sheer Cold. Substitute + Calm Mind Raikou actually sets up on Articuno, while Rotom-H resists Articuno's entire moveset.</p> <p><strong>Status: While Articuno is a huge threat to defensive Pokemon, Articuno that take too many risks might get crippled by Toxic or Thunder Wave as they switch in. Substitute + Toxic Suicune is especially threatening, since it can use Substitute to defeat Sheer Cold attempts and usually runs enough Speed to outpace Articuno. The rare Timid Chansey can also get a surprise Toxic in, though note that Minimize will not affect Sheer Cold's accuracy. Substitute variants can even make a mockery out of Sheer Cold.</p>",

        "name": "Sheer Cold Fisher",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sheer Cold is the big selling point of Articuno, allowing it to become an effective stallbreaker. Substitute protects Articuno from status moves and helps scout what Pokemon your opponent has chosen without forcing Articuno to switch on the next turn. Thanks to Articuno's bulk, most defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia, Suicune, Porygon2, and Slowbro will fail to break through its Substitutes. Roost ensures that Articuno can stick around, also allowing it to take Electric-type and weak Rock-type moves if it is faster than its foe.</p> <p>Freeze-Dry gives Articuno some offensive presence outside of the Sheer Cold dice roll, allowing it to OHKO Garchomp and Mega Salamence, have a shot at 2HKOing Mega Gyarados, 2HKO most Dragon-types and Swampert, and deal good damage to Rotom-W. It's also good for saving Sheer Cold's PP when facing Suicune and Slowbro that are low on health. Alternatively, while Protect makes Articuno extremely reliant on Sheer Cold, it allows Articuno to effectively take advantage of Pressure to stall out Stone Edge from slower Pokemon with its Substitute and take advantage of timer stalling in emergencies. Hurricane has shaky accuracy, but it allows Articuno to OHKO Mega Heracross and have a shot at OHKOing Mega Blaziken switch-ins, in addition to letting Articuno hit Mega Venusaur hard without using valuable Sheer Cold PP.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Articuno should always run Leftovers to set up Substitutes more often. 220 HP EVs maximize Leftovers recovery while letting Articuno switch into Stealth Rock twice without recovery. Maximum Special Defense lets Articuno tank plenty of special attacks, avoiding important 2HKOs such as defensive Rotom-W's Thunderbolt and offensive Mega Gengar's boosted Hex. Also, most defensive Pokemon that Articuno preys on use their Special Attack stat, while most of its checks are physical. 28 Speed EVs let Articuno outspeed most defensive Rotom-W and Suicune, while the rest go in Defense and Special Attack so EVs aren't wasted.</p> <p>Alternate EV spreads are a viable option to consider if you are willing to give up on bulk. 220 HP / 148 SpD / 140 Spe allows Articuno to outspeed Adamant Breloom, while 220 HP / 52 SpD / 236 Spe beats Jolly Breloom. Finally, if you need to outspeed Jolly Gyarados and Dragonite, run a Timid nature with an EV spread of 220 HP / 60 SpD / 228 Spe.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Articuno should be trying to prey on the defensive Pokemon of Battle Spot Singles, but you must note that directly switching into them risks getting Articuno crippled with Toxic poison or paralysis. Usually, it's best to come in via a slower U-turn or Volt Switch, bring in Articuno after a Pokemon of yours gets KOed, or even lead with Articuno. Once Articuno is safely in, use Substitute to block status. Most defensive Pokemon will be unable to break Articuno's Substitute, so use Sheer Cold as much as possible to apply a terrifying offensive pressure against your foes. If Articuno is carrying Protect, you can opt to whittle down the timer if you feel that your team is in a tough spot, because if the timer runs out and you have a higher number of Pokemon than the opponent, you'll win the match!</p> <p>Against more offensive Pokemon that fail to 2HKO Articuno such as Mega Gengar, you should still use Sheer Cold as much as possible; however, don't bother using Substitute unless you intend to stall them out with Protect, as it's better to Roost in most cases. Articuno doesn't do very well against hyper offense teams in particular, so if you feel that many Pokemon on your opponent's team will just OHKO it with a move it's weak to, benching Articuno for the match might be the best course of action. This is especially true against Pokemon with Rock Blast such as Cloyster and Mega Heracross. However, note that Articuno's chances against offensive teams become much higher with paralysis support, since it can effectively use Substitute and Roost to stall out many Pokemon with weaker Rock-type attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Carrying Pokemon that resist Rock-type attacks is almost mandatory for Articuno, as it simply can't handle faster Rock-type attacks from the likes of Garchomp, Landorus-T, Breloom, Tyranitar, and Excadrill. Fire-, Electric-, and Steel-type attacks should also be covered if possible. Mamoswine is a great teammate to consider, because while it can't handle Steel-type attacks, it smashes through Garchomp and Landorus-T with Icicle Spear, has a shot of OHKOing Breloom if it gets at least three Icicle Spear hits, and hits Rock-, Steel-, and Fire-types hard with Earthquake. Bulky Landorus-T can take on most physical and Electric-type attacks aimed at Articuno and is your best bet against a Mega Heracross switch-in. Garchomp isn't as bulky as Landorus-T, but the two make for a fine offensive Ground-type pair that also resists Fire-type attacks and can use Choice Band Dual Chop to have a chance at defeating Breloom in emergencies. While Conkeldurr only resists Rock-type attacks, it's notable for being an excellent Tyranitar check and revenge killing Excadrill with Mach Punch. Mega Altaria is handy for dealing with Tyranitar, and being one of the few Pokemon to check both Charizard Mega Evolutions. Finally, Gliscor and Articuno can form a frightening OHKO attack duo, with Gliscor being chosen for teams with plenty of physical attackers while Articuno handles teams with dangerous special attackers.</p> <p>Another avenue of support to consider is status. Paralysis in particular allows Articuno to set up Substitute more easily, Will-O-Wisp makes it much harder for most physical threats to check Articuno, and Toxic support means that Articuno won't have to rely as much on Sheer Cold. Porygon2 is an excellent teammate to consider, doing a great job spreading paralysis or Toxic and making a very good check to most offensive Ground-types and Aegislash that lack Substitute. Cresselia also works well, and while it can't check Aegislash, it can work as an emergency check against Mega Blaziken. Serperior is a more offensive twist on paralysis that shares an unfortunate Fire-type weakness with Articuno but makes a great Rotom-W check, gets a Speed boost from Rock Tomb, and can paralyze Ground-types with Glare. It can even use Reflect to make Articuno more difficult to check. Ferrothorn is even more weak to Fire-type attacks, but it makes a good status spreader and can even use Leech Seed to potentially restore more of Articuno's health. Rotom-H shares the dreaded Rock-type weakness, but it does great against Steel- and Electric-type Pokemon, except for Rotom-W, and it makes a good Mega Charizard Y check. It also is good at spreading around one of the three listed status moves if you wish. Heatran is a Fire-type that isn't weak to Rock-type attacks, and thanks to Flash Fire, it can switch into opposing Fire-types while spreading around Toxic and burns for Articuno. Mega Gengar is especially notable for its ability to trap and burn offensive Pokemon that Articuno has trouble with, and it also takes advantage of Pokemon with status via Hex.</p> <p>When using Articuno on more balanced teams, it's a good idea to pair it with devastating sweepers that appreciate Articuno's stall-breaking power. Mega Kangaskhan is one of the most dangerous examples around, since it does very well against offensive teams. Mega Salamence shares Articuno's weakness to Rock, but it's very bulky otherwise, revenge kills Mega Heracross, and can switch into Fire-type attacks. Mega Blaziken appreciates Articuno's wallbreaking, smashes through Tyranitar and Excadrill (though it should watch out for Earthquake), revenge kills Mega Heracross, and can take on most Steel-types. You can even use a mixed Blaziken set to defeat non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Garchomp.</p>"
      },
      {
        "name": "Assault Vest",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sheer Cold is Articuno's way of threatening bulky Pokemon like Porygon2, Cresselia, Chansey, and Slowbro. Freeze-Dry 2HKOes Rotom-W and Azumarill and even has a shot at 2HKOing Suicune, saving Articuno's Sheer Cold PP! Hurricane's accuracy is a bit shaky without rain support, but it happens to OHKO Mega Heracross and Mega Blaziken, common Articuno switch-ins. As a bonus, it also 2HKOes Mega Venusaur. Ice Shard is extremely weak, but it can pick off weakened Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence even with the Attack-lowering nature, and it's particularly helpful against Focus Sash Pokemon that survive Sheer Cold. If Ice Shard is too weak for your taste, you can use Ancient Power to OHKO offensive Talonflame switch-ins, have a 50% shot at OHKOing Charizard switch-ins, and deal over 50% to defensive Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y switch-ins.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Assault Vest makes Articuno much more specially bulky, allowing it to run maximum Special Attack for dealing decent damage outside of Sheer Cold. 108 HP EVs allow Articuno to switch into Stealth Rock twice and avoid a 2HKO from defensive Rotom-W. 140 Speed EVs with a Modest nature let Articuno outspeed Adamant Breloom, but if you're more worried about Jolly Breloom, you can run an EV spread of 12 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 236 Spe with a Modest nature. If outspeeding Dragonite and Gyarados is more important, run a Timid nature with 28 HP / 252 SpA / 228 Spe.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Don't be reckless with switching this Articuno in. While Assault Vest makes Articuno very bulky, it also prevents Articuno from using Roost, limiting the times it can switch in and threaten Pokemon with Sheer Cold (especially when Stealth Rock is up). Articuno also can't protect itself against status at all. This means that it's usually best to try to switch in Articuno via Volt Switch or U-turn or after a Pokemon of yours has been KOed.</p> <p>Assault Vest Articuno doesn't do quite as well against defensive teams as other Articuno, but in exchange, it can effectively lure and defeat some of its common switch-ins, such as offensive Rotom-W, Blaziken, and Mega Heracross. However, if it's apparent that your opponents team just has too many fast Rock-type attackers or Stealth Rock in tow, benching Articuno isn't a bad idea.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon with Rock-type attacks such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Tyranitar are the bane of Articuno's existence, meaning that you'll need teammates that resist those. Partners that resist Steel-, Electric-, and Fire-type attacks are also good to bring. Mamoswine is a superb answer to the Ground-types barring Excadrill, being able to smash Garchomp and Landorus-T with Icicle Spear and deal with Rock-, Steel-, and Fire-types with Earthquake. A Garchomp or Landorus-T of your own also deals with Tyranitar and Rock-type moves fairly well and can hit Steel-, Electric-, and Rock-types pretty hard too. Conkeldurr only resists Rock-type moves for Articuno, but it's a very good teammate to consider because it's one of the best Tyranitar counters around, can revenge kill Excadrill with Mach Punch, and is a great switch-in to status moves that Articuno loathes so much.</p> <p>This Articuno really appreciates paralysis support to make up for its middling Speed, which is especially helpful to make Blaziken lose its ability to check Articuno. Serperior is an excellent choice despite being weak to Fire-type moves, since it lures in Blaziken, Talonflame, and Charizard and can paralyze Ground-types thanks to Glare. Porygon2 is a great choice as a bulky paralysis spreader, since its offensive variants can defeat special attacking Aegislash and can generally deal with most offensive Ground-types. Cresselia works in a similar manner to Porygon2, trading the ability to check Aegislash with being able to handle Mega Blaziken better. Rotom-H can work well despite sharing the Rock-type weakness, since it helps against Steel-types, Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Thundurus. Rotom-W doesn't deal with Electric- and Steel-types as well, but it does do better against Ground-types in comparison thanks to the lack of a Rock-type weakness.</p> <p>Volt Switch and U-turn support can be useful to make the best use of Articuno's limited opportunities to switch in. Landorus-T, Mega Manectric, Scizor, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H are great choices for this role. Finally, Politoed is a special teammate to consider for Articuno, since its Drizzle makes Hurricane have 100% accuracy and lessens the blow of Fire-type attacks.</p>"

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<p>While Zapdos may not have the offensive prowess of its Electric / Flying relative Thundurus, Zapdos is capable of using its typing defensively, boasting respectable 90 / 85 / 90 bulk, solid recovery in Roost, an immunity to paralysis that allows it to check Thunder Wave users such as Klefki with ease, and the abilities Static and Pressure, all of which rare and useful for a defensive Pokemon in Battle Spot Singles. While its defenses aren't on par with those of walls such as Porygon2, Suicune, and Cresselia and its typing can be exploited by common Ice- and Rock-type moves, Zapdos boasts a respectable base 125 Special Attack and access to moves such as Heat Wave and Toxic. This allows Zapdos to function as an effective check to Pokemon such as Excadrill, Salamence, Lopunny, Azumarill, Talonflame, and Gyarados, carving a solid role for itself in Battle Spot Singles and fitting easily onto teams requiring a flexible defensive Pokemon to handle these threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A specially defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 SpA with a Calm nature can be used to allow Zapdos to check Togekiss, Magnezone, Mega Charizard Y, and Aegislash more easily, though it will greatly miss the added physical bulk, as its typing lends it to checking physical attackers better. While Zapdos's base 125 Special Attack set makes an offensive moveset seem appealing, it is outclassed entirely by Thundurus, which boasts a better movepool, higher Speed, and the ability to sweep with Nasty Plot. A set with Substitute and Roost can be extremely annoying to deal with, especially when factoring in the ability to stall with Pressure and Toxic, but it causes Zapdos to lose out on vital coverage and is incredibly passive in general. A set using Tailwind with U-turn or Volt Switch can be used to allow Zapdos to support offensive teammates for a few turns. Rain Dance can be used to support a rain team while taking advantage of Zapdos's access to both Thunder and Volt Switch. Yache Berry can be used to allow Zapdos to survive an Ice Beam from the likes of Starmie or Greninja and KO them in return, though it is otherwise useless if the opponent lacks any Ice-type moves to hit Zapdos with. Sitrus Berry can be used to allow Zapdos to regain 25% of its HP back immediately once it falls below 50%, which can save it in a pinch, though Zapdos generally benefits more from the residual damage Rocky Helmet offers or the passive recovery provided by Leftovers. Safety Goggles can be used to allow Zapdos to switch safely into Spore from Breloom and Sleep Powder from Mega Venusaur if your team requires more support against these Pokemon. An offensive set using Choice Scarf and a Modest nature with moves such as Thunderbolt, Heat Wave, Hidden Power Ice, and Volt Switch can be used to catch a large number of offensive Pokemon off-guard while acting as a revenge killer.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types such as Mega Altaria, Mega Charizard X, Hydreigon, Latios, and Latias can be problematic for Zapdos, as they all take little from its moves, especially if it lacks Hidden Power Ice, and the former two are able to set up Dragon Dance on it. However, all of them suffer from paralysis, so they must be wary of switching in on Discharge or Thunder Wave from Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types such as Garchomp, Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Excadrill are immune to Zapdos's Electric-type moves and can set up on it or, in Hippowdon's case, wear it down with Toxic. However, Garchomp and Landorus-T have to be wary of Hidden Power Ice, while Excadrill succumbs to Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Strong special attackers such as Greninja, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Gengar, Sylveon, and Thundurus have the raw power needed to easily break through Zapdos, hitting it on its weaker Special Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage: Pokemon with Ice-type STAB moves, such as Mamoswine and Weavile, can readily dispose of Zapdos, while Pokemon that frequently carry Ice-type coverage moves, such as Greninja, Starmie, and Porygon2, can deal a large amount of damage to it. Greninja, in particular, has a very high chance to OHKO Zapdos with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Coverage: Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Terrakion, and Mega Aerodactyl can tear through Zapdos with their Rock-type STAB moves, while Pokemon that frequently use Rock-type coverage, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Breloom, and Excadrill, can finish off Zapdos if it's weakened, though in some cases, Stone Edge can be stalled out of PP if it lacks STAB.</p> <p><strong>Lightning Rod and Volt Absorb: Manectric prior to Mega Evolving and Mega Sceptile have access to Lightning Rod and can take advantage of Zapdos's Electric-type STAB move to give themselves free Special Attack boosts, while Thundurus-T can set up on Zapdos and break through it due to to Volt Absorb.</p> <p><strong>Raikou: Raikou is a major threat to Zapdos, as it takes pittance from any of Zapdos's moves, while Raikou can set up Calm Mind against Zapdos and eventually break through it. Even if Zapdos carries Toxic, it has to be wary of Raikou variants running Substitute + Calm Mind, as they can safely set up behind a Substitute while ignoring Toxic completely.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Zapdos hates being poisoned by Toxic, as it offsets the recovery Zapdos gets from Leftovers and Roost, eventually forcing Zapdos to succumb over time.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: While not as prevalent in the Battle Spot Singles metagame, Stealth Rock still takes away a quarter of Zapdos's HP upon switching in, making Zapdos's job of functioning as a wall a bit harder.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Roost allows Zapdos to function as a wall, keeping itself healthy with reliable recovery. Thunderbolt is Zapdos's strongest and most reliable Electric-type STAB move, hitting Pokemon weak to it for respectable damage. Volt Switch can be used to allow Zapdos to gain momentum, bringing in a teammate safely while dealing damage and possibly breaking Focus Sashes, but being forced to switch after attacking can be costly, especially if Zapdos is left with low HP before using the move. Volt Switch is also useful for escaping from Mega Gengar and Wobbuffet, which would otherwise trap Zapdos with Shadow Tag. Discharge can be used for its higher chance of paralysis, though it can conflict with Toxic, so only use it in conjunction with Hidden Power Ice. Heat Wave is vital for Zapdos to break through Steel-types such as Excadrill, Klefki, and Aegislash, as well as Grass-types such as Breloom and Ferrothorn. Toxic gives Zapdos a way of whittling down defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia, Rotom-W, and Porygon2, allowing it to stall them out with Roost, while also giving it a means of damaging Pokemon such as Garchomp and Landorus-T. Hidden Power Ice, however, can be used as a method to deal immediate damage to offensive Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, and Thundurus-T, and the choice should be based on what your team needs more coverage against. Roar allows Zapdos to phaze, shuffling out setup sweepers and allowing you to scout the opposing team early-game, though it generally won't be more useful than Toxic or Hidden Power Ice. Thunder Wave can also be used to spread paralysis, allowing Zapdos to cripple offensive Pokemon such as Mega Altaria, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Salamence that may try to set up.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given nature and EVs maximize Zapdos's physical bulk while ensuring it takes as little damage as possible from Stealth Rock, sand, and hail. Rocky Helmet punishes Pokemon that rely on contact moves to hit Zapdos, such as Talonflame, Azumarill, and most importantly, Mega Kangaskhan. Leftovers is still a viable choice, however, as it gives Zapdos passive recovery, boosting its durability and making it less reliant on Roost. An EV spread of 252 HP / 196 Def / 60 Spe with a Bold nature can be used to allow Zapdos to outrun neutral-natured base 75 Speed Pokemon and below, such as Mega Heracross, Breloom, Bisharp, and Cloyster, while still maintaining as much physical bulk as possible.</p> <p>Static is an excellent ability on Zapdos, threatening to paralyze Pokemon in addition to taking Rocky Helmet damage. This is especially great for switching into Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out, since paralyzing it makes it much easier to check. However, Static is a difficult ability to get on Zapdos since it requires an obscure event. Because of this, if you are unable to get a hold of a good Static Zapdos, Pressure is still a good alternative that can make Zapdos better at PP stalling its foes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Take advantage of Zapdos's bulk and typing by using it to check physical attackers that will fail to immediately break through it, such as Azumarill, Scizor, Talonflame, and Gyarados, disposing of them with the appropriate move. Be especially liberal about switching into them if Zapdos is holding Rocky Helmet, as this wears them down as they attack, possibly even breaking their Focus Sash in the process. This is especially a good tactic if you are using Static Zapdos, since most of these Pokemon hate being paralyzed. Zapdos is one of the faster defensive Pokemon in Battle Spot thanks to its base 100 Speed stat, so take advantage of this when using moves such as Toxic and Roost against slower threats such as Cresselia and Rotom-W. If using Pressure Zapdos, take advantage of that and access to Toxic and Roost to stall out low-PP moves such as Stone Edge and Fire Blast, though be cautious if they are STAB moves, as they can outdamage the HP Zapdos recovers from using Roost. If running Volt Switch, be cautious when using it to escape from Wobbuffet, as your incoming Pokemon can end up taking a Mirror Coat.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Water-types such as Suicune, Slowbro, and Azumarill appreciate Zapdos's ability to switch into Grass- and Electric-type moves, while they themselves can handle the Ice-type moves directed at Zapdos, and check threats such as Dragonite, Garchomp, and Mega Charizard X. Specially bulky Pokemon such as Porygon2, Chansey, and Cresselia can form a defensive core with Zapdos, checking threats such as Greninja and Mega Charizard Y for it, while Zapdos can switch in on the Fighting- and Bug-type moves aimed at them. Pokemon such as Conkeldurr, Mega Venusaur, Breloom, and Greninja appreciate Zapdos's ability to deal with Talonflame and Mega Kangaskhan. Blaziken is also an excellent teammate for Zapdos, as it appreciates Zapdos's ability to handle most of its checks, namely Talonflame, Slowbro, Azumarill, Gyarados, and Salamence, while Blaziken can handle the Rock- and Ice-type moves directed at Zapdos with ease. Aegislash is also a noteworthy partner for Zapdos, as Zapdos is immune to the Ground-type moves that plague Aegislash, while Aegislash can take Rock- and Ice-type moves for Zapdos. Aegislash can also switch into Toxic for Zapdos, while Zapdos can wear down Porygon2 for Aegislash by using Toxic itself.</p>"

  "Dragonite": {
    "overview": "<p>Dragonite faces stiff competition in Battle Spot Singles due to seemingly more powerful Dragon-types such as Mega Salamence, Garchomp, and Mega Charizard X running amok in the metagame. However, Dragonite has a few neat tricks up its sleeve that set it apart from these powerhouses; Multiscale gives it significant bulk when at full health, and it is the only Dragon-type with access to a priority move in Extreme Speed. Dragonite also has an expansive movepool, giving it coverage against almost anything that it wants to hit, which, when backed by its monstrous Attack and usable Special Attack, means that it can tailor its moveset to get past some of its common checks. Dragonite is also one of the best Choice Band users in the metagame, as the item gives immediate power to Outrage and Extreme Speed, allowing it to punch holes early or effectively clean up the opposing team. However, Dragonite hates status conditions, as they severely hinder its ability to sweep the opposing team; while a Lum Berry gives it a second chance when using the Dragon Dance set, the Choice Band set needs to look out for common Will-O-Wisp users such as Sableye, Gengar, Talonflame, and Rotom-W. Dragonite also has trouble fitting all the moves it needs onto one set, as its movepool is so large that it often has a hard time choosing exactly what it needs; this is especially true for the Dragon Dance set, which already has a moveslot taken up by Dragon Dance itself and needs to decide between great options such as Fire Punch, Roost, Substitute, and Iron Head. It is also quite hard to switch Dragonite into the battle, as taking damage nullifies Multiscale, and Dragonite is actually quite frail without it. Due to this, Dragonite should also be kept away from common Fake Out users such as Mega Lopunny, Weavile, Mega Medicham, and Mega Kangaskhan. Dragonite's 4x weakness to Ice-type moves is also easily exploitable, as those moves are very popular in the metagame to defeat popular threats such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence. Dragonite may seem like an underwhelming choice; however, because it doesn't require a Mega slot, it is able to set itself apart from Mega Salamence and Mega Charizard X and can fit on most teams very easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragon Dance Dragonite has a plethora of options; it can make use of Roost for recovery, Substitute or Safeguard to aid against status, and Superpower or Thunder Punch for coverage against Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Gyarados. The Dragon Dance set can be altered to use a Weakness Policy over Lum Berry and Agility over Dragon Dance. This set aims to quickly boost Dragonite's stats against a foe with a weaker super effective move, such as Mega Manectric with Hidden Power Ice, Serperior with Dragon Pulse, or Landorus-T with Rock Slide. However, relying on being hit with and surviving a super effective move to get the boost from the Weakness Policy is very risky. Dragonite can also make use of rain, either setting it up itself with Rain Dance or letting a teammate do it, as it has the perfect movepool for taking advantage of rain, with moves such as Hurricane, Thunder, Surf, and Waterfall; however, Dragonite absolutely needs rain to be set up in order for such a set to work, and keeping rain active is difficult. Dragon Claw and Dragon Rush are alternative STAB options to Outrage; however, the difference in power between Dragon Claw and Outrage is significant, and Dragon Rush's accuracy is quite unreliable. Dragonite can also use a Life Orb on either set, but it leaves the Dragon Dance set susceptible to status and is weaker than the Choice Band set. It also lowers Dragonite's health when an attack is used, which removes Multiscale if Dragonite is at full health.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Because Dragonite's main form of offense is Outrage, it should be wary of locking into it and having Pokemon such as Azumarill, Sylveon, and Togekiss come in for free and force Dragonite out.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves: Even Multiscale can't save Dragonite from powerful moves such as Greninja's Ice Beam, Mamoswine's Icicle Spear, and Weavile's Fake Out + Icicle Crash combination. Even Kangaskhan can run Ice Punch and bypass Multiscale by hitting twice in the same turn.</p> <p><strong>Removing Multiscale: Dragonite actually isn't very bulky if it isn't at full health and can't make use of Multiscale. Stealth Rock users stop Dragonite from switching in freely, as they will break Multiscale upon entry. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Lopunny, and Weavile can all break Multiscale and follow up with a KO with Ice Punch or, in Mega Kangaskhan's case, Double-Edge. U-turn and Volt Switch users can also break Dragonite's Multiscale while simultaneously switching to a counter.</p> <p><strong>Status: Dragonite is highly susceptible to status conditions, especially the Choice Band set, as it lacks the recovery of the Lum Berry. Will-O-Wisp users such as Sableye and Rotom-W can stop Dragonite from doing any significant damage, whereas Pokemon such as Thundurus, Klefki, and Liepard can inflict paralysis with Thunder Wave or even attempt to confuse Dragonite with Swagger.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Defensive Pokemon with reliable recovery can outright stop Dragonite from doing much of anything; these include Suicune, Cresselia, Hippowdon, Skarmory, Slowbro, Quagsire, and Gliscor.</p> <p><strong>Serperior: While the Dragon Dance set is able to boost its Speed and beat Serperior, the Choice Band set is walled by physically defensive Serperior, which can set up Reflect and continue to heal with Synthesis until Dragonite succumbs to recoil from its Rocky Helmet.</p>",

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Dragonite's Attack to monstrous levels and its Speed to a high enough level to outspeed threats such as Garchomp, Latios, Latias, Serperior, Raikou, and Greninja after only one boost. Outrage may seem too risky to lock into, but its monstrous power is well worth it. While Extreme Speed may seem redundant with Dragon Dance's Speed boosting capabilities, it allows Dragonite to go ahead of most other priority moves, most notably Ice Shard, meaning that Dragonite can pick off weakened users such as Mamoswine and Weavile instead of being KOed itself. It's also a great move in general and is great for picking something off if Dragonite hasn't yet boosted its Speed. Earthquake is the preferred coverage option, as it allows Dragonite to heavily damage the Steel-type Pokemon that resist Outrage, most notably Aegislash, Heatran, and Mawile. Fire Punch has the benefit of hitting Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Skarmory, but it leaves Dragonite walled by Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment is used to increase Dragonite's sweeping potential, and an Adamant nature boosts Dragonite's power even further. Jolly can be used instead to outspeed Mega Gengar at +1, but Dragonite appreciates the increase in power a lot more. A Lum Berry combines fantastically with Multiscale, practically guaranteeing Dragonite to boost with Dragon Dance at least once; it also cures the confusion inflicted by Outrage if it isn't used up before then. If you aren't worried about status conditions, you can try using a Weakness Policy instead. If Multiscale is intact, Dragonite can stomach most super effective hits and come out with a +3 in Attack if it boosts on the same turn, which will allow it to do devastatingly high amounts of damage to the foe.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Dragon Dance Dragonite is one of the safest leads in the game, as it is very easy to grab a first-turn boost with Dragon Dance and then immediately go on the offensive. Against Fake Out leads such as Mega Lopunny or common status spammers such as Sableye and Thundurus, it is best to switch out to a teammate so that you can keep Multiscale and the Lum Berry intact. Despite being a fantastic lead, Dragonite can also function as a terrific cleaner, as it can pick off a weakened foe with Extreme Speed or take the opportunity to boost with Dragon Dance if the foe does not threaten it. While Dragonite may function exceptionally well at any time in a match, it desperately needs to keep its Multiscale active, as it isn't actually very bulky without it; accordingly, you need to be careful when switching, as taking unnecessary damage will void the Multiscale. For this reason, it is best to either lead with Dragonite or bring it in after a teammate has been KOed or with the aid of a slow Volt Switch or U-turn user. Once Dragonite is set up, you can start using Outrage for maximum damage against the foe. This is really only a risky play if the opponent has a Fairy-type Pokemon to switch to; if they don't, Dragonite is basically free to use Outrage. Earthquake should only be used if Dragonite is faced with a Steel-type that resists Outrage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dragonite's most popular teammates are Hippowdon and Mega Lucario; these three are a very popular core amongst Japanese players. Hippowdon is used as a lead that can set up Stealth Rock to break opposing Focus Sashes, as well as put the foe to sleep with Yawn, and once Hippowdon has been KOed, you can bring in Dragonite at full health to set up a Dragon Dance. Mega Lucario is used to beat the Fairy- and Ice-type Pokemon that Dragonite has trouble with, and Dragonite helps against the Ground-types that Mega Lucario doesn't want to face. Dragonite can be paired with almost anything that takes care of opposing Fairy-, Ice-, and Dragon-types; these Pokemon include Suicune, Mawile, Metagross, Azumarill, Scizor, and Rotom-W. Notably, Mega Gengar can be used to trap and eliminate troublesome Fairy-type Pokemon for Dragonite. Porygon2 is a great bulky partner for Dragonite, being a great switch-in to Greninja, and provides valuable paralysis support with Thunder Wave, helping Dragonite against faster threats. Dragonite hates Stealth Rock, as it removes its Multiscale upon entering the field, so stopping it from being set up in the first place is the most feasible course of action. Mega Sableye is probably the best at doing this, as it can either make use of its non-Mega forme to quickly Taunt a foe trying to set up Stealth Rock or send it back onto their side of the field with Magic Bounce.</p>"

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Outrage is Dragonite's STAB move of choice, hitting for ridiculous amounts of power right from the get-go thanks to the Choice Band. Extreme Speed is what sets Dragonite apart from other Dragon-types, giving it a strong priority move with which to pick off faster threats. Earthquake hits troublesome Steel-types such as Heatran and Aegislash for super effective damage. Fire Punch rounds out Dragonite's coverage against Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Scizor. Iron Head or Iron Tail can be used over Fire Punch to hit Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Togekiss super effectively; however, it is usually best to just let a teammate deal with them.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment increases Dragonite's wallbreaking abilities as much as possible, and an Adamant nature is used to increase Dragonite's Attack even further. The Choice Band gives Dragonite immediate power equal to that of a Dragon Dance boost, allowing it to do large amounts of damage right away, such as OHKOing Thundurus, Mega Salamence (after Intimidate), maximum HP Mega Gengar, physically defensive Ferrothorn, physically defensive Mega Latias, and Mega Kangaskhan and 2HKOing physically defensive Zapdos, Cresselia, Suicune, Hippowdon, and Porygon2 lacking Trace.</p> <p>While this EV spread is rather simple, it is possible to change Dragonite's EVs to be able to tank certain hits better at the cost of some power and speed. An alternative spread is 236 Atk / 212 SpD / 60 Spe. This allows Dragonite to still outspeed most Rotom-W and Suicune, as well as giving Dragonite a great chance at surviving Life Orb Greninja's Ice Beam as long as Multiscale is still active. Dropping the Attack EVs doesn't sacrifice too much power, as Dragonite can still OHKO Greninja and get the 2HKO on Rotom-W. However, Dragonite is usually better off leaving those Pokemon to its teammates, meaning you can stay with the original EV spread.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Band Dragonite acts as a great wallbreaker and late-game cleaner due to the immediate power of the Choice Band allowing it to easily finish weakened teams with Outrage and Extreme Speed. Because this Dragonite does not aim to spend a turn boosting, it is much easier to switch it into the battle without worrying about its Multiscale being broken; however, it still benefits greatly from having it intact to take on Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Thundurus, Garchomp, Raikou, and Blaziken, so take this into account when switching. All of Dragonite's moves are easily exploitable by Pokemon that are immune to them, so be wary of any Fairy-, Ghost-, or Flying-type Pokemon or Levitate or Flash Fire users on the opponent's team, as they can easily use Dragonite for a free switch. Therefore, if you plan on sweeping with Choice Band Dragonite, it is of utmost importance that you clear the field of any of these Pokemon before locking Dragonite into a certain move.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hippowdon and Mega Lucario are very popular teammates for Choice Band Dragonite. Hippowdon is used as a lead to set up Stealth Rock and put the foe to sleep with Yawn, and when it has been KOed, either Mega Lucario is brought in to set up with Swords Dance or Nasty Plot or Dragonite can come in to immediately start doing damage. If Mega Lucario is brought in after Hippowdon to set up, Dragonite acts as the cleaner with its powerful Extreme Speed, usually after Mega Lucario has been KOed itself so that Dragonite can maintain its Multiscale. Mega Lucario and Dragonite work brilliantly together, as Mega Lucario can effectively beat opposing Fairy-, Ice-, and Rock-type Pokemon for Dragonite, while Dragonite is immune to Ground-type moves and has a good matchup against Fire-type Pokemon. Choice Band Dragonite suffers from its average Speed stat, meaning that many faster Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Charizard X and Y, Serperior, and Mega Salamence can give it trouble. For this reason, paralysis support is really helpful, allowing Dragonite to go ahead of these Pokemon and pummel them with its powerful moves. Porygon2 is perhaps the best partner, as it is a great switch-in to these threats with its fantastic mixed bulk and ability to punish them with Thunder Wave. Serperior is also able to paralyze Ground-type Pokemon such as Garchomp and Landorus-T with Glare or just outright beat them with Leaf Storm. Choice Band Dragonite also benefits from teammates that can beat opposing Fairy-, Ice-, and Dragon-type Pokemon; good partners include Suicune, Mawile, Scizor, and Rotom-W.</p>"

  "Azumarill": {
    "overview": "<p>Azumarill may look unassuming, but it's actually one of Battle Spot's most enduring mainstays. Its stellar defensive typing, small but perfect movepool, and its incredible ability in Huge Power make it a poster boy for bulky offense and arguably Battle Spot's best available Water-type. Its ability to go toe-to-toe against threatening Pokemon such as Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Heatran and come out on top makes it a valuable asset for many players; however, while Azumarill is capable of doing a lot of damage to unprepared teams, its small movepool makes it vulnerable to several common threats, and it sometimes has difficulty taking out even some frail attackers. Also, its pitiful base 50 Speed means that it has to rely on Aqua Jet quite often to KO faster opponents or it risks losing a chunk of its HP—or even being KOed—as there are some situations that even its above-average 100 / 80 / 80 bulk can't save it from. In spite of its flaws, however, Azumarill makes a fine offensive and defensive cornerstone for a lot of teams and excels in most matchups and situations.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Azumarill can use its other two abilities, Sap Sipper and Thick Fat, in a defensive set with moves like Scald, Toxic, Encore, and Perish Song. However, while these Azumarill variants are quite effective at catching people off-guard, they have no recovery and are often too passive to have any lasting impact on a battle. On top of that, Encore is incompatible with Aqua Jet, so it cannot find a place on an offensive set. Bounce is an interesting option that Azumarill can use in the fourth slot of the Belly Drum or all-out attacker set as a way of getting past Mega Venusaur, but Venusaur is very uncommon nowadays and Bounce leaves Azumarill vulnerable to more common answers such as Ferrothorn and Porygon2. It's usually better just to leave Venusaur to a teammate like Talonflame.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Breloom can give Azumarill some trouble thanks to their resistance to Aqua Jet, generally superior Speed, and super effective STAB moves. Grass / Poison types are capable of hard-walling Azumarill, as none of its common attacks hit any better than neutrally.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types such as Rotom-W, Zapdos, Mega Manectric, and Magnezone are all capable of taking an Aqua Jet at full health and dispatching Azumarill with their STAB Electric-type moves. However, they are less effective against Belly Drum variants due to the lack of a resistance to Water (aside from Rotom-W), meaning that a +6 Aqua Jet does a lot of damage to them.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Most of the Water-types give Azumarill issues due to their good physical bulk and resistance to Aqua Jet; bulky Water-types such as opposing Azumarill, Suicune, Mega Slowbro, and Rotom-W can tank Azumarill's hits comfortably and threaten it with a burn from Scald or Will-O-Wisp, whereas the most popular offensive Water-type, Greninja, can survive even a +6 Aqua Jet (if it hasn't changed type via Protean) and OHKO Azumarill comfortably with Life Orb Gunk Shot or Grass Knot.</p> <p><strong>Faster Priority: While Azumarill's strong defensive typing gives it resistances to most common priority moves such as Ice Shard, Sucker Punch, Aqua Jet, and Mach Punch, powerful priority users like Talonflame and Mega Lucario can outspeed Azumarill's Aqua Jet and finish it off, cutting its sweep short. All-out attacker variants are less worried about these Pokemon than Belly Drum variants are, but they are still capable of doing significant damage to Azumarill.</p> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet: As all of Azumarill's commonly used attacks are contact moves, Pokemon like Cresselia, Porygon2, Slowbro, Suicune, Zapdos, and Ferrothorn, all of which commonly hold Rocky Helmet, are very effective for repeatedly taking Azumarill's hits and essentially causing it to deplete its own HP with passive damage. Knock Off Azumarill is capable of stopping this before it gets too problematic; however, many of these Pokemon are still capable of crippling or damaging Azumarill outside of their item with moves like Scald, Thunder Wave, Power Whip, and Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Faster Bulky Attackers: Azumarill is easily overwhelmed by powerful neutral attacks such as Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge, Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Mega Salamence's Double-Edge, especially when it can't do enough damage to overcome the situation with Aqua Jet.</p>",

        "name": "Belly Drum",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Belly Drum is used for boosting Azumarill's Attack stat at the cost of half of its health. Aqua Jet is a priority move and Azumarill's main means of damaging faster opponents. Play Rough is Azumarill's secondary STAB attack and achieves decent neutral coverage with Aqua Jet. The choice between the last three moves depends on your team structure; Waterfall is an alternative STAB option that is more accurate than Play Rough, Knock Off removes troublesome items such as Eviolite and Rocky Helmet, and Superpower gives Azumarill the coverage necessary to get past Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This EV spread maximizes Azumarill's Attack and overall bulk whilst also giving an even HP stat at level 50; this is important, as it puts it into Sitrus Berry's activation range after Belly Drum is used. The leftover 4 EVs are put into Speed to allow Azumarill to outpace opposing base 50s, such as Chansey, Aggron, Tangrowth and Mega Mawile. The EV spread can be tweaked depending on what you want Azumarill to outspeed; 228 HP / 252 Atk / 12 Def / 12 SpD / 4 Spe with an Adamant nature is the safest due to the large amount of bulk, but points can be moved from HP into Speed to outpace faster threats; for instance, 132 HP / 252 Atk / 124 Spe with an Adamant nature allows Azumarill to outspeed Pokemon with an uninvested base 65 Speed stat while still keeping Azumarill's HP at an even number. This jump point encompasses Pokemon such as Scizor, Tyranitar, Abomasnow, and Clefable, greatly improving Azumarill's matchup against them and making it less dependent on Aqua Jet. Huge Power is Azumarill's preferred ability for all of its sets, as it doubles Azumarill's Attack stat, bringing it from a middling 112 to a much more impressive stat of 224, allowing it to do much greater damage than it would be capable of with either of its other two abilities. Sitrus Berry synergizes well with Belly Drum, recovering 25% of Azumarill's health when it has 50% HP or less remaining. This leaves Azumarill at the maximum possible amount of HP after boosting and makes it more likely to survive oncoming attacks during its sweep.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Despite its bulk, Belly Drum Azumarill can sometimes be a risky Pokemon to play with due to the health lost while setting up and the free turn required to do so. However, there are several Pokemon in the format that cannot significantly hurt Azumarill with certain attacks and as such make good setup opportunities: examples include Heatran, Mega Sableye, Hydreigon, Tyranitar, and Garchomp locked into Outrage or Rock Tomb. Because the list of setup opportunities for Azumarill is quite specific, some scouting is usually required before Azumarill can commit to a sweep by clicking Belly Drum. However, if you have other viable win conditions, Azumarill can be used effectively as an early hole puncher. At +6, Azumarill's Aqua Jets are strong enough to do solid damage to a significant portion of the format. Due to this, it makes a fine win condition, especially against slower teams. However, Azumarill still has difficulty breaking through Pokemon such as Cresselia, Mega Venusaur, Zapdos, Ferrothorn, and Porygon2 without prior damage. This is where scouting can be useful: if these threatening Pokemon can be knocked out or sufficiently damaged, Azumarill can easily clean up with its moves. While clicking Belly Drum and spamming Aqua Jet can be tempting, there are occasions where Azumarill can hold off on boosting and save its item (and its health) for a later opportunity. Aqua Jet makes Azumarill a fairly effective revenge killer, and there will also be occasions where it's wiser to simply damage the opponent rather than go for the boost and risk having Azumarill faint.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>While Azumarill is strong, its base 50 Speed is lackluster and makes it easy to revenge kill. As such, plenty of faster Pokemon can stop its sweep, either by resisting Aqua Jet or possessing faster priority. Azumarill's main concern is opposing Grass-types: if they outspeed it, they are capable of easily taking a +6 Aqua Jet and OHKOing in return with a STAB Grass-type move. Azumarill also has trouble with Talonflame, as Choice Band Brave Bird easily does enough damage to OHKO Azumarill after the HP loss from Belly Drum. For these reasons, Heatran makes a very effective teammate for Azumarill, as it resists both of Talonflame's STAB types and also walls many common Grass-types, including Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Roserade. They also synergize defensively and Azumarill can beat Heatran's answers, including Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Conkeldurr, in return. Electric-types make good teammates for Azumarill thanks to their above-average Speed stats, passable physical bulk, and resistance to priority moves such as Bullet Punch and Brave Bird. Mega Manectric in particular excels at this role thanks to its ability, Intimidate, which allows it to switch in on priority for Azumarill and remove the threat with its coverage. Pokemon like Garchomp, Mamoswine, Excadrill, and Landorus-T are useful supporters for Azumarill thanks to their positive matchup against Electric-types with their immunity to Electric-type moves and STAB Earthquake; however, Garchomp and Landorus must take care around carriers of Hidden Power Ice. Azumarill doesn't like to take damage if it can avoid it, as too much can keep it from successfully getting a Belly Drum off. For this reason it appreciates Volt Switch or U-turn support from teammates such as Assault Vest Landorus-T and Raikou. Finally, this variant of Azumarill benefits a lot from Mega Gengar, which can switch in on Grass- and Poison-type moves and trap and remove problematic Pokemon such as Zapdos, Cresselia, Mega Slowbro, Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Serperior for Azumarill. In turn, Azumarill can dispatch Dark-type Pokemon that threaten Gengar, such as Hydreigon and Tyranitar.</p>"

        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Aqua Jet is a STAB priority move that allows Azumarill to bypass its low Speed, hit faster attackers, and finish off weakened attackers. Waterfall and Play Rough are its main STAB options and main means of dealing damage. Knock Off gives Azumarill a utility option in removing key items such as Leftovers, Sitrus Berry, Choice items, Eviolite, and Rocky Helmet, while the main alternative, Superpower, gives it a way to hit Ferrothorn and Porygon2 super effectively.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment help to make Azumarill as threatening as possible. The EV spread maximizes Azumarill's overall bulk and allows it to outspeed opposing base 50s. An alternative spread of 100 HP / 252 Atk / 156 Def with an Adamant nature can be used to guarantee that Azumarill survive a 252+ Mega Salamence Double-Edge from full HP and KO back most of the time with Play Rough and Aqua Jet. The choice of item is determined by the purpose you want Azumarill to fulfill: Lum Berry is a technical option that allows Azumarill to get the jump on Pokemon like Breloom and Sableye, which otherwise threaten it with their status moves, while Assault Vest boosts Special Defense and grants Azumarill the ability to check both of Charizard's Mega Evolutions - the Assault Vest allows Azumarill to comfortably survive Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam and KO back with Waterfall followed by Aqua Jet. A third option that can be considered is Life Orb: the damage boost allows Azumarill to do upwards of 90% to Life Orb Blaziken with Aqua Jet and makes Azumarill harder to switch into overall; however, it loses out on a lot of its bulk thanks to the recoil and makes moves such as Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, and Scald much more of a concern for Azumarill.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This variant of Azumarill is geared less towards sweeping and extreme power and more towards being a reliable switch-in to attacks aimed at Azumarill's teammates. This means that this variant of Azumarill isn't quite as reliant on support from it's teammates as other variants are; the all out attacker set should therefore be used as a bulky pivot and hole-puncher, switching in on resisted attacks and getting immediate damage off with its moves. This set is similar to the Belly Drum set in that it has a positive matchup against Dragon-, Dark- and Fire-types like Hydreigon, Tyranitar, Heatran and Mega Charizard X, but takes a more immediate approach to attacking: while the Belly Drum build sets up on a Pokemon it threatens and then attempts to take out the switch-in with a +6 attack, the all out attacker simply fires off an attack into the switch-in and then responds accordingly. For this reason, this set isn't as scared of Pokemon like Zapdos and Ferrothorn, as it can damage them on the switch-in and then respond by either switching into a teammate to take an incoming attack or attacking again, depending on how much prior damage they've taken.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>While this Azumarill set is quite resilient, it still suffers from a few issues inherent in physical Water-type attackers: Grass-types, priority abuse, physical tanks, and Electric-types still give it a hard time. However, all-out attacker Azumarill makes for a more reliable switch-in, so it can support it's teammates as well. Landorus-T, Zapdos, Garchomp, Thundurus, Mega Manectric, Raikou, Aegislash, and Heatran are all solid Pokemon that complement Azumarill's weaknesses and that can get strong hits off on the things that beat it, while Azumarill can do the same in kind.</p>"
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Aqua Jet is Azumarill's priority STAB attack and its main revenge killing tool; Waterfall doesn't benefit from increased priority like Aqua Jet does, but it is a much more powerful attack; Play Rough has stellar coverage with Azumarill's Water-type move and is the hardest-hitting attack on the set; Knock Off removes the items of Pokemon like Porygon2; and Superpower allows Azumarill to hit Kangaskhan, Ferrothorn and Mega Aggron for super-effective damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Huge Power is mandatory on a physical attacker, set as it doubles Azumarill's otherwise mediocre base 50 attack stat, making Azumarill into a formidable threat, especially when equipped with a Choice Band, which adds a further multiplier of 1.5x, making Azumarill's attacks monstrously strong. With this level of power, there's no reason not to max out Attack; otherwise, you can adjust Azumarill's HP and Speed investment depending on what you want to creep, but the hit-and-run nature of the set makes maxing out bulk the most practical choice. Therefore, running 228 HP / 252 Atk / 12 Def / 12 SpD / 4 Spe is your safest bet, as it maximises Azumarill's bulk while still maintaining the maximum possible power. Other options include a 244 HP / 252 Atk / 12 Spe spread which grants Azumarill another point of Speed, giving you more assurance against other base 50s that may be trying to Speed creep. 132 HP / 252 Atk / 124 Spe is another spread to consider for outpacing uninvested base 65 Pokemon such as bulky Scizor.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Band Azumarill works rather differently to the All-Out Attacker despite being almost identical in every way other than the item choice; it trades the flexibility of a defensive item for the immediate strength of a Choice Band. The biggest draw of the Choice Band set is the ability to switch in and do immediate damage with a very powerful Aqua Jet, which can 2HKO many of the targets hit neutrally in the format and can OHKO some frailer threats such as Mega Blaziken. On top of that, Azumarill's Play Rough is incredibly hard to switch into when boosted by a Choice Band. With great power, however, comes great responsibility; the move-locking side-effect of the Choice Band places much more emphasis on predicting correctly, as it is very easy to force Azumarill out if the opponent does have a switch-in for its moves (such as Ferrothorn or Zapdos). Be sure to take advantage of Azumarill's typing and natural bulk to bring it in on things that cannot threaten it (such as Hydreigon or Blaziken) and use the free turn to damage the switch-in with a powerful STAB Waterfall or Play Rough.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Band Azumarill needs to switch in and out a lot, but it lacks recovery; while it can switch in on a hit and tank it well, it can't do so repeatedly. For this reason, it's a good idea to bring some methods of getting Azumarill safely onto the field with minimal damage. Pokemon that bait attacks that Azumarill doesn't mind taking are useful here; for example, Salamence can lure in Dragon-type moves or weak Rock-type coverage from Garchomp and switch to Azumarill, which can shrug off either option easily. U-turn, Volt Switch, and Baton Pass are also good for getting Azumarill safely onto the field when used by slow, bulky Pokemon such as Scizor, Sylveon, and Rotom-W. As with the Belly Drum set, Choice Band Azumarill really appreciates the support of Mega Gengar, as it can trap problematic Pokemon such as Cresselia, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos and remove them so that they can't switch in on Azumarill and force it out. Likewise, Azumarill deals with Dark-type attackers for Gengar.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>When talking about Espeon, the thing that immediately comes to mind is its fantastic ability Magic Bounce, which bounces back status moves, particularly Taunt, Swagger, and most phazing moves. However, Magic Bounce is not the only reason to use Espeon, as it has a good Speed stat that enables it to outspeed common threats like Garchomp and Mega Kangaskhan and Speed tie with Gengar. Espeon also has a good offensive movepool with moves such as Stored Power, Dazzling Gleam, Shadow Ball, and Grass Knot, alongside a great Special Attack stat that aids in sweeps, and a handy defensive movepool, having access to Calm Mind, Yawn, dual screens, and a recovery move in its signature Morning Sun. With the combination of these tools, Espeon carves itself a niche in the Battle Spot Singles metagame as a Calm Mind sweeper, a fast dual screen user, or simply one of the best Baton Pass recipients in the game. What really keeps Espeon from being more than a niche Pokemon, though, is its lacking physical Defense and HP stats, leaving it vulnerable to many common physical attackers, such as Mega Salamence, Mega Mawile, and Talonflame, and Sucker Punch users due to its Psychic typing. Even on the special side, it is weak against common threats like Aegislash and Greninja that can easily take care of it. Because of its frailness, Espeon greatly suffers competition for a slot on the team from bulkier Calm Mind sweepers such as Mega Sableye, Suicune, and Raikou, and from dual screen users like Klefki, which has Prankster and a better defensive typing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Fire is an option to hit Ferrothorn as well as Scizor, while Hidden Power Ground could help the Choice set deal heavy damage to Heatran. Espeon can run Baton Pass as well, setting up fast Substitutes or Calm Minds and then passing them to a partner. White Herb is the mandatory item if you are using Smeargle as your Baton Pass user to offset all the negative boosts from Moody and Shell Smash. Bright Powder can be used to increase evasion even further if building a team around evasion-passing strategies.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Mega Gengar hits Espeon very hard with its STAB Shadow Ball, threatening both the Calm Mind and the dual screen set, while Mega Lopunny KOes those sets with the combination of Fake Out and Return. Choice Band Talonflame and Life Orb Greninja both have good chances to OHKO Espeon. Common Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon, Garchomp, and Landorus-T could also threaten Espeon if it is not running a Choice Scarf itself.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Pokemon: Volcarona can use Quiver Dance in front of either the dual screen set, ignoring Yawn if having a Lum Berry, and the Calm Mind set, becoming faster than Espeon and usually going out of control. Mega Salamence can take an attack from Espeon even after a Calm Mind boost and then Dragon Dance and Roost or attack.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Sucker Punch users such as Mega Kangaskhan, Bisharp, and Mega Mawile can OHKO the Calm Mind set and the Choice set and deal heavy damage to the dual screen set. Dragonite and Lucario both can pressure Espeon and deal good damage with Extreme Speed. Talonflame can OHKO the Choice set with a priority Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types: Aegislash can easily threaten all of Espeon’s sets, easily tanking Psychic-type moves, Dazzling Gleam, and even Shadow Ball or Hidden Power Fire after one or two Calm Mind boosts, KOing it back with the combination of Shadow Ball and Shadow Sneak. Mega Mawile laughs at Espeon's attacks, even if it's running Hidden Power Fire, being able to use Swords Dance or just Knock Off in return. Scizor and Ferrothorn can both be very hard to deal with if Espeon doesn't run Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Espeon usually needs a few Calm Mind boosts before being able to OHKO Dark-types with Dazzling Gleam. Tyranitar deserves a special mention, being able to easily threaten Espeon, surviving Dazzling Gleam or Hidden Power Fighting even if Espeon is at +2, and halving Morning Sun's healing power with the sand up.</p>",

        "name": "Calm Mind Sweeper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind is Espeon's form of setup, reducing damage from special attacks and boosting its already great Special Attack. Stored Power capitalizes on the boosts Espeon gets, and it's the preferred option if using Espeon as a Baton Pass recipient. Psychic is an alternative for immediate power, since Stored Power needs two Calm Minds to be stronger than it, while Psyshock can be used to hit common Assault Vest users such as Conkeldurr. Dazzling Gleam covers Dark-types and has good coverage; however, Hidden Power Fighting can be used instead if targeting Steel-types is required while still hitting Dark-types, but it is weaker. Morning Sun gives Espeon recovery to ease setup, while Substitute guards it from status-inducing moves such as Scald and Discharge or from priority moves like Sucker Punch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Magic Bounce lets Espeon set up without fear of status or phazing. The EV spread allows for optimum Leftovers recovery, while maximum Speed aids sweeping with Calm Mind or set up a fast Substitute. The rest of the EVs are invested into Defense to patch up Espeon's average physical bulk, allowing it to survive attacks like Jolly Garchomp's Outrage. Keep in mind that running Hidden Power Fighting means that Espeon will fail to Speed tie with Gengar. In this case, if using a Timid nature, a 164 HP / 116 Def / 28 SpD / 200 Spe spread can be used in order to outspeed Jolly Garchomp and all base 100s while having good chances to survive Adamant Life Orb Talonflame's Brave Bird and Timid Gengar's Shadow Ball. 236 HP / 76 Def can be used in order to always survive a maximum Attack Adamant Life Orb Talonflame's Brave Bird, while 196 Speed EVs still let Espeon outspeed maximum Speed Garchomp and all base 100s. A Modest nature with a 236 HP / 76 Def / 4 SpA / 28 SpD / 164 Spe spread is an alternative to allow Espeon to outspeed maximum Speed Jolly Heracross and survive maximum Attack Adamant Life Orb Talonflame's Brave Bird and Timid Gengar's Shadow Ball while having a more offensive presence. On Baton Pass teams, Espeon could run very bulky EV spreads such as 252 HP / 252 Def with a Bold nature in order to mitigate its physical frailness. Leftovers and Morning Sun increase Espeon's longevity, but Kee Berry can be an option to increase its bulk and Stored Power's base damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to Espeon's frailness, avoiding unnecessary damage is mandatory. Fainted teammates are a good way of bringing in Espeon. Capitalize on Magic Bounce by switching in on predicted status moves, entry hazards, or Pokemon that often rely on residual damage or support moves. A good idea is to use special attackers such as Cresselia and Rotom-A as setup fodders, since Espeon can take hits from them and heal back the HP it lost. Likewise, support Pokemon like Chansey and Whimsicott are setup bait thanks to Magic Bounce. Knowing when to set up is very important, since you don't want to start setting up too early and be forced out after taking a bit of damage. A good way to maximize Espeon's chances to sweep is to deal with potential threats in the early stages of the game and try to set up in the latter part of the match. Keep in mind that Espeon needs a couple of boosts to successfully attempt a sweep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can handle Steel-, Dark-, and Dragon-types such as Blaziken, Heatran, Mawile, and Sylveon are good partners for Espeon. Fighting-types such as Mega Lopunny and Conkeldurr help against Mega Kangaskhan and Steel-types. Blaziken in particular can also pass Speed boosts, further strengthening Stored Power while also allowing Espeon to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and all common Choice Scarf users. Other Pokemon that can Baton Pass boosts to Espeon like Smeargle, Scolipede, and Drifblim make for good partners, as well as support Pokemon like Klefki, which sets up screens and can paralyze threats with Thunder Wave. Umbreon deserves a special mention, being able to pass evasion to Espeon and to switch in on Ghost- and Dark-type attacks, while threatening strong attackers with Foul Play. Rotom-W can handle Talonflame and Greninja, and it also provides Will-O-Wisp support against strong physical attackers. Powerful physical attackers like Garchomp and Mega Kangaskhan can weaken opposing teams to allow Espeon to sweep, especially removing Pokemon that Espeon has trouble with like Steel-types such as Aegislash or Mawile.</p>"

        "name": "Dual Screens",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psychic is the main STAB move, dealing decent chip damage to anything that doesn't resist it and hitting common threats like Breloom, Gengar, and Venusaur hard. Reflect and Light Screen make up the main role of this set, boosting Defense or Special Defense for all of the Pokemon on your side for eight turns. Yawn forces switches and stops opposing setup sweepers to further help Espeon's supporting role, and Dazzling Gleam offers good coverage as well as preventing Espeon from being completely walled by Dark-types.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Thanks to Magic Bounce, Espeon can ignore Taunt, status moves, and annoying Swagger strategies. 236 HP EVs and 76 Defense EVs allow it to always survive maximum Attack Life Orb Adamant Talonflame's Brave Bird before setting up Reflect and have a great chance to survive Timid Gengar's Shadow Ball even if not covered by Light Screen. 196 Speed EVs with a Timid nature is used to outspeed positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon, such as Mega Kangaskhan, and maximum Speed Jolly Garchomp. Behind dual screens, Espeon becomes pretty bulky, being able to survive attacks like Adamant Conkeldurr's Knock Off, +1 Jolly Mega Salamence's Double-Edge, and even Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch or Double-Edge (although the combination of Fake Out and Double Edge will still KO Espeon) while shielded by Reflect; maximum Special Attack Quiet Aegislash's Shadow Ball and maximum Special Attack Timid Life Orb Greninja's Dark Pulse if behind Light Screen. Light Clay is required to prolong the turns of Reflect and Light Screen.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The main goal of this set is to put up dual screens and maximize Espeon's teammates' chances to sweep or set up. Bringing Espeon as your lead is in general the best idea, since it doesn't like to switch in and take hits. Try to set up one screen and then use Yawn to gain the momentum for a switch out or to spread chip damage on switch-ins. Setting up both screens will often lead Espeon to faint, but it could still be worth it, giving a free switch into your sweeper. Letting Espeon go down after setting up one or both screens is especially good on hyper offense teams, since Pokemon on these teams don't need many turns to set up. Yawn can be used to stop foes from setting up in front of Espeon, but keep in mind that using it in front of a Prankster + Substitute user such as Thundurus or Klefki could lead to a wasted turn.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Espeon set fits well on offensive teams and pairs well with setup sweepers. Dragon Dance Mega Salamence and Quiver Dance Volcarona are both good partners thanks to the dual screen support from Espeon as well as Magic Bounce that prevents entry hazards. Mega Kangaskhan is another good partner, being able to switch in on and check Ghost-types with Sucker Punch and Crunch while checking Steel-types with Earthquake. Azumarill gives Espeon a handy switch-in to Dark- and Bug-type attacks and appreciates the dual screen support that can allow it to easily set up Belly Drum. Blaziken is also a good choice for helping against Steel-types and Tyranitar. Mega Gyarados resists Ghost-type moves and can set up with Dragon Dance. Dragonite can be extremely bulky with the combination of Multiscale and the dual screens while setting up Dragon Dances. In general, strong, hard-hitting Pokemon will all appreciate dual screen support from Espeon. Other examples of good partners are Mega Heracross, Mega Mawile, Greninja, and Sylveon.</p>"

        "name": "Choice Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psychic is Espeon's strongest STAB move. Psyshock can be used to hit special walls or Calm Mind users harder. Dazzling Gleam covers Dark-types and has good overall coverage. Grass Knot smashes common leads like Mamoswine and Hippowdon, and Shadow Ball can be used to hit most Steel-types and deal super effective damage to Aegislash and Gengar. Hidden Power Ice is an option to deal huge damage to 4x Ice-weak Dragons like Salamence and Garchomp, even having a chance to OHKO them, and OHKO non-bulky variants of Landorus. Trick is a great option for the fourth moveslot, allowing Espeon to lock Pokemon into a single move.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread maximizes Espeon's Special Attack and provides enough Speed to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, other Choice Scarf user, and even Blaziken at +1, if running a Choice Scarf. If running Choice Specs, the EV spread will allow Espeon to Speed tie with Gengar and outspeed common threats like Garchomp and Mega Kangaskhan. Magic Bounce guards Espeon from status that could otherwise stop it from sweeping, like paralysis and confusion from Swagger. A Modest nature could be used to obtain more firepower. If running Modest Espeon, 28 Speed EVs and a Choice Scarf are enough to outspeed base 130s such as Mega Gengar, so the remaining EVs could be invested to increase its bulk. Keep in mind that this could leave Espeon vulnerable to other Choice Scarf Pokemon or with poor Speed after using Trick.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Espeon can be used as the lead to deal as much damage as it can or mess up foes with Trick, locking them into a supporting move or restricting their choice to a single move, crippling Pokemon like Cresselia and Porygon2, and giving momentum to the team. It can also be used as a late-game cleaner thanks to its high Speed, but keep in mind that Espeon is vulnerable to priority attackers like Talonflame or Kangaskhan.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can handle Steel- and Dark-types, such as Fire-type Pokemon like Blaziken or Fighting-type Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, are good partners for Espeon. Mega Kangaskhan is another good partner, being able to switch in on and check Ghost-types with Sucker Punch and Crunch while also checking Steel-types with Earthquake. Fairy-types such as Azumarill and Mega Mawile give Espeon handy switch-ins to Dark- and Bug-type attacks. An answer to common priority users such as Talonflame and Mega Kangaskhan may facilitate Espeon's sweeping role. Rotom-W or Rotom-H, Zapdos, and Garchomp can all fulfill this role. Pokemon with the ability Justified such as Lucario or Terrakion can switch Dark-type attacks and gain a free Attack boosts if Espeon Tricks a foe into a Dark-type move while also being able to take Bug-type attacks.</p>"

  "Wobbuffet": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Wobbuffet might seem like a rather unremarkable trapper compared to Mega Gengar, but, thanks to its disruptive movepool and good bulk, Wobbuffet is effective at dealing with certain kinds of Pokemon that Mega Gengar has more issues with, such as Choice users and fast offensive threats. However, what truly makes Wobbuffet dangerous isn't what sets it apart from Mega Gengar but, rather, what the two can do together when joining forces! Wobbuffet and Mega Gengar together can be a dastardly duo that horrifies defensive teams with Perish Song. Against offensive teams, Wobbuffet's and Mega Gengar's ability to trap different threats can put a massive amount of pressure on your opponent!</p> <p>Unfortunately, Wobbuffet heavily relies on its teammates to finish the job, meaning that when it's left as the last Pokemon, Wobbuffet can potentially lose the game by becoming easy setup fodder. Its low Speed, lack of recovery, and mediocre defensive typing mean that Wobbuffet will often only have the capability to take down one Pokemon per match. These flaws make Wobbuffet a rather specialized Pokemon that won't fit on every team. However, with a specialization as deadly as trapping, Wobbuffet should never be taken as a joke when encountered in Team Preview, as few Pokemon excel at taking away choices as well as Wobbuffet does!</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>If your team is vulnerable status ailments, Wobbuffet can use Safeguard and Lum Berry together to ruin attempts at status. If especially worried about sleep, Wobbuffet can use Safety Goggles to defeat Breloom and Vivillon. Focus Sash can let Wobbuffet nab a surprise KO on a sweeper, but it will leave Wobbuffet useless for the rest of the battle. Charm is notable for making Perish Song trapping with Mega Gengar and setting up sweeps easier, but it only works on physically offensive Pokemon, making it a rather situational move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Pokemon with Shed Shell: Shed Shell is uncommon outside of Blissey, but it is an extremely effective response to Wobbuffet, ruining its trapping strategies with Mega Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Taunt: Taunt blocks Wobbuffet's Encore, making it easy setup fodder. Common offensive users of the move include Tyranitar and Gyarados, while Mandibuzz and Skarmory are effective defensive Taunt users.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Magic Bounce: While uncommon, Mega Sableye and Espeon are immune to Wobbuffet's Encore thanks to Magic Bounce.</p> <p><strong>Special Dark-types and Physical Ghost-types: Mirror Coat doesn't affect specially attacking Dark-types, making Hydreigon and mixed Tyranitar effective answers as long as they avoid Destiny Bond. In a similar manner, physical Aegislash is unaffected by Counter.</p> <p><strong>U-turn, Volt Switch, and Baton Pass Users: U-turning to a Ghost-type is an effective way to escape Wobbuffet's Counter and Encore, while using Volt Switch to bring in a Dark-type avoids Mirror Coat and Encore. Baton Pass isn't as common, but thanks to its lack of damage, it's even more effective against Wobbuffet, letting the foe switch in without a risk of getting KOed.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: While Wobbuffet isn't actually OHKOed by unboosted Ghost-types, these Pokemon are immune to Shadow Tag, allowing them to escape and KO Wobbuffet later when it's weakened.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Users</strong>: Although Pursuit is uncommon, Scizor and Tyranitar can use it to deal massive damage to any escaping Wobbuffet.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off Users: While Wobbuffet will usually OHKO Knock Off users with Counter, it also means Wobbuffet won't be able to use its Berry. Common Knock Off users include Blaziken, Azumarill, and Conkeldurr.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "\\(>_<)7",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Encore is Wobbuffet's big selling point, locking the foe into a move for three turns with no chance of switching out thanks to Shadow Tag! Counter allows Wobbuffet to deal massive damage when hit by a physical attack, while Mirror Coat shatters foes using special attacks. Destiny Bond rounds out the set, allowing Wobbuffet to ease prediction by putting setup sweepers in a \"get KOed or set up on\" situation. Safeguard is usually a poor option, but it can be considered if your team is especially weak to status moves.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Defense and Special Defense is recommended for the most bulk, because Wobbuffet's HP stat is so massive that investing in it won't do as much good. The extra 4 Speed EVs give Wobbuffet a chance to Speed tie with Slowbro, while a Bold nature lets Wobbuffet take physical hits better, suiting the physical dominance of Battle Spot Singles.</p> <p>Sitrus Berry gives Wobbuffet a longer presence on the battlefield due to the 25% recovery it offers, which can be especially useful against more defensive teams. Custap Berry, on the other hand, is a more high-risk, high reward option. Custap Berry lets Wobbuffet move first when it's at 25% of its health (which, in this case, is 66 HP). When combined with Destiny Bond, this gives Wobbuffet the potential to take down two Pokemon in a match! However, this also makes Wobbuffet more vulnerable to extremely powerful attacks that don't quite get it into Custap Berry's activation range, as Sitrus Berry won't be there to cushion the blow for it.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Wobbuffet might have good bulk, but switching it in recklessly trying to trap foes isn't usually a wise decision. Wobbuffet's lack of recovery means that it's usually only guaranteed one KO per match, so keeping Wobbuffet healthy earlier in the game is a good idea until you can decide what Pokemon you want Wobbuffet to take out. This isn't to say that Wobbuffet needs to be saved for the late-game, though; if you find a good opportunity to get Wobbuffet in safely, such as after a KO or against a defensive Pokemon, don't hesitate to bring it in. Just remember: when using Wobbuffet early in the game, setting up sweeps is riskier due to potential checks, so it's sometimes best to simply launch off powerful attacks with your setup sweeper instead.</p> <p>Wobbuffet's safest option is to switch into defensive targets that can't do much to it beyond giving it a status ailment. Use Encore to make them setup fodder for another switch-in or use Counter or Mirror Coat to eventually KO them if they attack. Good targets for Wobbuffet include defensive Porygon2, Cresselia, Hippowdon, Ferrothorn, Slowbro, and Suicune. The next best targets for Wobbuffet are Choice Scarf Pokemon, with two of the most common targets being Landorus-T and Rotom-W. Wobbuffet usually shouldn't directly switch into these Pokemon until you know they are carrying a Choice Scarf, and be aware that Rotom-W and Rotom-H often carry Trick, which can cripple Wobbuffet. Once Choice Scarf Pokemon are locked into a move, they become easy targets for Wobbuffet to defeat with Counter or Mirror Coat! Choice Band and Choice Specs Pokemon are also vulnerable to Wobbuffet, but because they are occasionally able to 2HKO Wobbuffet, it's usually best for Wobbuffet to revenge kill them instead.</p> <p>When Wobbuffet is forced to face powerful setup sweepers such as Blaziken and Life Orb Garchomp, using Encore is risky, as their attacks can already 2HKO Wobbuffet. Instead, using Destiny Bond is the safer choice. Because Wobbuffet is so slow, Destiny Bond will remain activated when the foe moves again. This puts the foe in a tough situation: either KO Wobbuffet and get taken down with Destiny Bond or avoid a KO and become setup fodder thanks to Encore! Using Destiny Bond against potential mixed attackers such as Mega Salamence is also wise because predicting the wrong move with Counter or Mirror Coat can be devastating for Wobbuffet.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gengar should almost always be used with Wobbuffet. When paired together, Wobbuffet and Mega Gengar form a dastardly duo that severely punishes defensive Pokemon and foes locked into support moves from Encore. Perish Song Mega Gengar is usually the best variant to run. The first method of unleashing their madness is for Wobbuffet to use Encore on a support move or a Normal- or Fighting-type move for Mega Gengar to switch in on so it can start the Perish Song cycle. The second method is for Mega Gengar to use Perish Song on a defensive Pokemon and then switch to Wobbuffet to absorb their attacks, as Wobbuffet has much higher bulk than Mega Gengar. Also, note that Wobbuffet and Mega Gengar don't always have to be used in the same match: using one or the other can be useful against offensive teams, which are not as vulnerable to Perish Song. Wobbuffet tends to do better against fast, offensive threats and Choice Scarf users, while Mega Gengar tends to deal with slower threats more efficiently. If your team can't afford the loss in coverage, other Mega Gengar variants are still good teammates, though they aren't as effective against defensive Pokemon.</p> <p>Almost any setup sweeper in Battle Spot Singles will benefit from Wobbuffet's support, but sweepers that are especially valuable to focus on are Pokemon that offer immunities and resistances that can take advantage of Wobbuffet's Encore. Great examples include Garchomp (for its Electric immunity), Azumarill (for its Dragon-type immunity and Dark-type resistance), Thundurus (for its Ground and paralysis immunity), Talonflame (for its Ground and burn immunity), and Blaziken (for its Dark-type resistance and burn immunity). Also, as using both Wobbuffet and Mega Gengar isn't the best choice against every opponent, having a backup Mega Pokemon that enjoys Wobbuffet's support is a reasonable option. Strong offensive Mega Pokemon that benefit from Wobbuffet's support include Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Salamence.</p>"

  "Steelix": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Steelix is more of a niche option in Battle Spot Singles, but it has the potential to be dangerous on a Trick Room team with Cresselia as a teammate, especially in a metagame filled with fast and frail attackers. It finds usefulness due to its ability to utilize Curse effectively, after which it is able to OHKO most Pokemon in the format, including Mega Kangaskhan and Garchomp.</p> <p>While Mega Steelix does not have to worry about even super effective physical attacks, special attacks are unfortunately a major weakness. It cannot stand up to Water-type attacks like Hydro Pump and Scald or to Focus Blast. It also heavily relies on Trick Room to be effective and therefore only fits on one kind of team, with Cresselia as a mandatory partner. On top of that, it must use Curse before attacking, giving it only two turns of Trick Room in most situations. For these reasons, it faces heavy competition from Mega Mawile, which can still be effective when outside of Trick Room. However, Mega Steelix is still a very powerful Pokemon while under Trick Room and can even be used to counter opposing Trick Room teams that use Mawile.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>In Battle Spot Singles, Steelix really is not that flexible and does not have that many other options outside of the Trick Room set. Heavy Slam has more PP than Gyro Ball but is very much inferior, as it misses out on the OHKO on Mega Kangaskhan. Steelix usually does not have to worry about being slow enough anyway, especially with Curse decreasing its Speed. Rock Blast is a way to beat Volcarona and Dragonite that have Focus Sash, but it is generally unreliable compared to Rock Slide. Fire Fang is an option to take down Scizor and Ferrothorn. Explosion can be useful if Steelix is about to go down, as it can take out Pokemon that do not care about Earthquake and Gyro Ball, such as Rotom-W. Non-Mega Steelix can use a Custap Berry set with Stealth Rock, but it is generally outclassed by other Stealth Rock users such as Skarmory, which can recover HP. Toxic and Rocky Helmet on a defensive set is also an option, but once again it is outclassed by Skarmory. However, Toxic on the Curse set over Rock Slide or Stone Edge is not a bad idea as it cripples defensive switch-ins, such as Porygon2, Cresselia, and Hippowdon. However, for the most part, Steelix is best used as a Mega Evolution in Trick Room, as this is much more effective than any of its alternative sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon: Bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Gliscor can come in on Steelix's attacks fearlessly. Hippowdon can heal off the damage and passively hurt Steelix with Rocky Helmet, and Swampert can take it down with special attacks. Gliscor can wear Steelix down with Earthquake while using Substitute and Protect to stall out Gyro Ball's low PP. It can also nab Steelix with Guillotine if Steelix has Mega Evolved and lost Sturdy. Mega Venusaur, Mega Slowbro, and Porygon2 can also heal to stall out Steelix. Pokemon like Mega Venusaur, Mega Sableye, and Ferrothorn that can inflict passive damage on Steelix, such as burns or Leech Seed, are also major roadblocks. However, with Lunar Dance Cresselia, Steelix can be healed from this later on.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-type Pokemon have to watch out for a boosted Earthquake, but if they can get a hit in they will severely damage Steelix. Bulkier Pokemon such as Suicune and Mega Blastoise can usually take a hit and attack back. Greninja is a threat outside of Trick Room, and Rotom-W has no reason to fear any of Steelix's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fighting- and Ground-types: Although Mega Steelix can usually take two or three physical super effective hits, it will be eventually worn down. Pokemon such as Mega Heracross and Conkeldurr will be able to beat it in the long run. Defensive Rocky Helmet and offensive Swords Dance variants of Garchomp and Landorus-T will be able to take down Steelix as well. Garchomp can even use Choice Band for extra muscle to beat Steelix.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Pokemon such as Mega Lucario, Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Volcarona, and Choice Specs Hydreigon can take out Steelix easily. Generally, whether or not these Pokemon counter Steelix depends on whether or not Trick Room is up. When Trick Room is down, these Pokemon greatly threaten Steelix. However, when it is up, Steelix can take care of most of them handily.</p>",

        "name": "Curse Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Curse is a great boosting move that increases Steelix's Attack and Defense and lowers its Speed. All three of these effects benefit Steelix: raising Attack directly increases the power of its moves, lowering Speed increases the power of Gyro Ball, and boosting Defense buys it more time to Curse again before it takes critical damage. Gyro Ball is the main STAB attack to be used. Because Steelix's Speed is lowered by Curse, Gyro Ball is usually at maximum power. After one Curse, it is able to OHKO Mega Kangaskhan. Earthquake is a very powerful secondary STAB move and should be used primarily to damage Pokemon that resist Steel. Rock Slide and Stone Edge are options to nab Pokemon such as Talonflame and Thundurus that do not care about Gyro Ball or Earthquake. Stone Edge is more powerful, but it has a significantly greater chance to miss.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>You should want Steelix to be as slow as possible in order for it to fully benefit from Trick Room and Gyro Ball, so no Speed EVs and 0 Speed IVs are used. Instead, those EVs can be reallocated into HP to make Steelix as bulky as possible. 252 Attack EVs make Steelix as powerful as possible. Steelixite allows Steelix to Mega Evolve to Mega Steelix, granting a significant boost to its Attack and Defense. Sturdy and Sheer Force are the two options for abilities before Mega Evolution, as Steelix uses no recoil moves for Rock Head. While Sheer Force boosts the power of Rock Slide, Sturdy is generally the better choice, as it can be useful in a last Pokemon situation. For example, against a boosted Volcarona or Charizard, Steelix can take a hit and KO back. Most of the time, though, you will want to Mega Evolve Steelix straight away. Upon Mega Evolving, Steelix gains Sand Force. However, it is not something that can really be taken advantage of, as Tyranitar and Hippowdon are poor teammates that stack weaknesses. Finally, a Brave nature is chosen to increase Steelix's Attack while lowering its Speed to increase the power of Gyro Ball.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Steelix set is more of a sweeper, as it needs the boost from Curse to start doing serious damage. However, in some matchups it can attack right away and be effective, such as against certain physically-based leads like Kangaskhan, Garchomp, and Mamoswine. Due to its low Speed, you should expect Steelix to take a hit before it can use an attack. It can take most physical hits comfortably, but it will get worn down over time, especially if it gets burned. However, if Cresselia has Lunar Dance, you can afford to let Steelix get worn down and then revive it and attempt a sweep in the late-game. Having Cresselia use Lunar Dance immediately after Trick Room to bring Steelix in is usually the best option since you will want to use Steelix under Trick Room, and if it seems Steelix is able to sweep, it ensures Steelix has enough health to set up. Curse is safer than it might seem at first; since it boosts Defense as well, it can give you more time to set up on physical attackers. Against a Mega Kangaskhan or Mega Salamence, do not be afraid to take one turn to get hit and then set up Curse, even if doing this uses a turn of Trick Room; one turn is usually all you need. However, Steelix cannot use Curse carelessly; only use it when you know it can pull off a sweep. If you are forced to switch Steelix out, it will significantly hurt your momentum. Nonetheless, once Mega Steelix has a Curse boost and is under Trick Room, it will be able to OHKO most Pokemon and pull off a sweep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cresselia is an absolutely mandatory partner. It is a general defensive threat that has good synergy with Steelix thanks to its high defenses, good typing, and Levitate, making it able to come in on the Fighting-, Ground-, and even Water-type attacks that hit Steelix super effectively. It also sets up Trick Room for Steelix and gives it a free switch and healing with Lunar Dance, which is essential, as Steelix is easy to wear down over time. Both Technician and Poison Heal variants of Breloom are useful helpers to Steelix. Poison Heal Breloom can act as a status absorber in order to take random burns or sleep-inducing moves thrown at Steelix. Furthermore, Breloom can help take down Hippowdon and Suicune, which otherwise have a good matchup against Steelix. Technician Breloom trades the ability to absorb status in favor of the ability to exert offensive pressure. Serperior and Amoonguss are other Grass-types that have good type synergy with Steelix and can take down Hippowdon and Water-types. Amoonguss also enjoys having Trick Room around due to its low Speed. Lapras is a Water-type that is able to counter Suicune and Garchomp. Porygon2 is a good back-up for Cresselia, making the three-Pokemon team quite bulky. With Download, Porygon2 can also deal with Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Garchomp while also being able to set up Trick Room for Steelix. Sylveon's weaknesses are covered by Steelix, and in return it has high Special Defense to take hits aimed at Steelix. It can use powerful Hyper Voices to wear down the opposing team as well and can even benefit from Trick Room. It also has a lesser-used option, Safeguard, to protect Steelix from status as it sets up for a sweep. Mega Charizard X is a good idea for a backup Mega to replace Steelix in certain cases, as it has great synergy with the rest of Steelix's team options, such as Cresselia and Breloom. In Team Preview, Steelix tends to lure out opposing Water-types, which Mega Charizard X can usually capitalize on. It is also a good Mega to use if it seems that it will be difficult to set up Trick Room against the opposing team. Talonflame and Hydreigon are similar Pokemon that can be useful outside of Trick Room to act as stallbreakers with Taunt. Hydreigon can take care of Rotom-W and Hippowdon, while Talonflame can still be useful inside of Trick Room thanks to Gale Wings.</p>"

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Scizor is arguably one of the best momentum grabbers in Battle Spot Singles thanks to its high Attack and STAB U-turn that allows you to keep up offensive pressure. Scizor can fulfill a variety of roles such as a setup sweeper, revenge killer, and physical or special sponge, but it is generally found on balance and stall teams mainly due to its low Speed but superb defensive typing. Having access to a priority move in Technician-boosted Bullet Punch really helps a slow Pokemon like Scizor. With only one weakness in Fire and excellent bulk, Scizor is able to switch into many powerful special attackers such as Mega Gardevoir, Sylveon, Gengar, and Latios. Its Mega Evolution further increases its already impressive defenses, and reliable recovery in Roost makes Scizor extremely difficult to take down without a Fire-type move. However, Scizor is often at the mercy of Fire-types commonly seen on Battle Spot such as Blaziken, Talonflame, and Mega Charizard X and Y, as they are all able to get a free turn without being threatened. Other dangerous foes include Zapdos and Thundurus, which can both beat Scizor one-on-one. Scizor is often seen as outclassed by other powerful Steel-types in the metagame such as Aegislash and Mega Mawile, with both having better typing and being overall more powerful, but access to Roost, which the other offensive Steel-types lack, allows Scizor to last much longer in battle.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Lum Berry is a viable option over Choice Band if you don't wish to be locked into one move, allowing Scizor to better check Gengar without fearing burn and remove items from Rotom-W and Thundurus before receiving nasty status. Scizorite is a viable option over Choice Band that gives Scizor the option to freely switch moves and a great increase in bulk at the cost of some power. Occa Berry can be used in conjunction with Counter to score surprising KOs against certain foes such as Fire Fang Garchomp and Mega Mawile. Leftovers is a viable option when running maximum Special Defense if you wish to bring Scizor along with another Mega Evolution. Quick Attack is another priority move boosted by Technician that allows Scizor to hit foes that resist Bullet Punch such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona. Feint functions in a similar manner to Quick Attack but with a higher priority bracket, allowing Scizor to hit Talonflame before it can use Brave Bird or Roost. Aerial Ace is a Technician-boosted move that can be used in the last slot to hit Breloom, Chesnaught, Heracross, and Blaziken on the switch for super effective damage. Facade is an option to take advantage of status such as burn and paralysis so Scizor can deal massive damage to Rotom-W, which often takes advantage of a burned Scizor and stays in. Finally, a Jolly nature is an option over Adamant to hit neutral Speed Heatran with Superpower, but be aware that some Heatran run Timid anyway.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Dangerous Fire-types such as Blaziken, Heatran, Talonflame, Mega Charizard X and Y, and Volcarona are all able to freely use Scizor as setup bait while Scizor can't do anything in return. Talonflame and some Mega Charizard X variants are also able to freely spam Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Zapdos resists Scizor's STAB types and has access to Heat Wave, Magnezone can trap Scizor and eliminate it with Hidden Power Fire, and Mega Manectric has access to Intimidate and Flamethrower and Overheat. Bulky Thundurus with Nasty Plot and, potentially, Taunt also poses a huge threat to Scizor.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Scizor can't do much to Suicune and risks getting a Scald burn, Rotom-W is able to cripple Scizor with Will-O-Wisp, and Gyarados has Intimidate, resists Scizor's STAB types, and can freely set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Aegislash and Skarmory can easily wall Scizor with their astronomical Defense, Mega Mawile has Intimidate and access to Fire Fang to threaten Scizor, and Heatran is able to outspeed and Scizor OHKO it with its Fire-type STAB move of choice.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence: Intimidate and its Dragon / Flying typing allow Salamence to freely set up on Scizor, while its access to utility moves such as Roost and Substitute means Scizor won't be able to do much back even after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: Due to its typing and Magic Bounce ability, Mega Sableye doesn't take much from any of Scizor's coverage moves, and it can threaten to burn or proceed to set up Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Burn Inducers</strong>: Common Will-O-Wisp users include Rotom-W, Talonflame, and Gengar. Scizor relies on physical moves for damage output most of the time, so a burn will severely decrease Scizor's ability to deal damage while also putting a timer on it.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance is required on Scizor due to its relatively limited coverage options outside of its STAB moves and to make Scizor more threatening. Roost increases Scizor's longevity to allow it to switch in more or to grab more boosts with Swords Dance. Bullet Punch is Scizor's STAB move of choice, as it gets boosted by Technician and is very spammable against Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir. Thanks to the priority, Scizor doesn't need to worry about its low Speed to sweep against faster threats like Gengar and Mamoswine. Knock Off provides Scizor with Dark-type coverage to hit threats such as Aegislash and Gengar and gets rid of their item for non-Mega variants of Gengar; it can also OHKO Thundurus after one Swords Dance boost. U-turn can be used over Knock Off to allow Scizor to scout for Fire-types so that the team can have a better matchup against potentially dangerous threats. Bug Bite is a reliable STAB move that is boosted by Technician and more powerful than U-turn; however, it is generally not recommended because it doesn't offer Scizor momentum when Fire-types come in. Nevertheless, it does remove potential Berries from Pokemon such as Sitrus Berry Rotom-W and allows Scizor to keep its boosts during the match. Superpower is a viable option in the last slot to hit Mega Kangaskhan, Ferrothorn, and Mega Lucario.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in HP makes Scizor as bulky as possible because Speed isn't that important with priority moves and reliable recovery. Allocating 28 EVs into Defense allows Scizor to survive two Earthquakes from Adamant Landorus-T, while 116 Special Defense EVs help it survive two Shadow Balls from maximum Special Attack Mega Gengar. The rest of the EVs are allocated into Attack to allow Scizor to benefit as much as possible from an Adamant nature. Given how the mechanics of EVs work at level 50, the remaining 4 should be allocated to Speed so no points are wasted. Scizorite is necessary, as it not only improves Scizor's defenses but also makes it less susceptible to moves such as Knock Off and Trick. Life Orb is an alternative if you already plan to bring other Mega Evolutions and should be used with a more offensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe for maximum damage output. This setup offers Scizor massive offensive potential at the cost of significant bulk. Technician not only is the best ability for Scizor in general but also lets you feign a non-Mega Scizor set, which is especially useful if your team has more than one potential Mega Evolution. However, Light Metal is a viable alternative prior to Mega Evolution, as Scizor will take less damage from moves such as Low Kick when switching in.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Don't bring Scizor into the match if Team Preview is very unfavorable, such as when half the team is a major threat, like when you see Salamence, Volcarona, and Suicune on one team. However, Scizor does have a favorable matchup against Trick Room teams because of its ability to remove Cresselia and its low Speed, but it must be wary of Heatran. Always Mega Evolve Scizor as early as possible, especially when running Light Metal because Scizor really needs the extra bulk. Scizor may be used as a lead if there are no Fire-types because it has a good matchup against other potential leads such as Landorus-T, Mamoswine, and Ferrothorn and is able to U-turn out to maintain momentum against these foes. Swords Dance should only be used in later stages when most of the opponent's team has been revealed, especially when running Knock Off or Superpower over U-turn. Never overestimate Mega Scizor's bulk, and always scout for potential Hidden Power Fire from common users such as Mega Venusaur and Serperior; however, the latter can only OHKO at +2 and is destroyed by Mega Scizor's Bug-type STAB moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Latios and Scizor have near-perfect synergy, with Latios taking on Fire-types and Scizor taking on Dragon- and Fairy-types while also eliminating Dark-types that threaten Latios like Tyranitar. Spamming Choice Specs Draco Meteor with Latios could also weaken the opposing team enough for Scizor to sweep. Garchomp is able to provide Stealth Rock support while Scizor comfortably takes Ice- and Fairy-type attacks for it. Dragonite is able to set up on every Fire-type that takes out Scizor without fearing status as much due to Lum Berry. Powerful Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon can eliminate Mega Sableye, one of Scizor's main checks, while also completing a popular Dragon / Fairy / Steel core. Tyranitar helps Scizor eliminate Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y and has the ability to change the weather to sand, which is more favorable to Scizor. Blaziken is able to Baton Pass Speed boosts to Scizor, which could really use the Speed because it's so slow, while Scizor has a better matchup against Azumarill and Slowbro, which all threaten Blaziken. Gastrodon is a counter to many Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Raikou and gets Special Attack boosts from Scalds aimed at Scizor. Thundurus pairs well with Scizor because its paralysis support helps alleviate Scizor's low Speed and it can eliminate Flying-types like Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y with relative ease.</p>"

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Bullet Punch provides Scizor with a powerful STAB move, priority, and revenge killing capabilities against Fairy-types and weakened teams. U-turn is a must for Scizor, as it cannot afford to stay in on potential Fire-types while being locked into one move and ensures momentum is maintained to allow for a more positive matchup. Superpower is able to OHKO Mega Kangaskhan and Heatran and cleanly achieves the 2HKO on other threats such as Mega Mawile and Porygon2. Knock Off is able to cripple switch-ins by removing items such as Leftovers, Rocky Helmet, and Eviolite while dealing a nice amount of damage. Pursuit can be used over Knock Off as an alternative Dark-type coverage move that can trap Gengar and Latios and also helps weaken bulky Psychic-types like Cresselia.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Attack with an Adamant nature allows Scizor to hit as hard as possible without losing much bulk. The remaining 4 EVs are not as important but can be allocated to Speed to outspeed other uninvested Scizor. Choice Band is the best-suited item for this set; along with Scizor's high base Attack, it allows it to dish out huge amounts of damage with its STAB moves alone. Technician should be used over any other abilities when using non-Mega Scizor because Bullet Punch can benefit greatly from the ability.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If there are no Fire-types in Team Preview, Scizor makes for a decent lead to hit the foe hard with an appropriate move. U-turn should always be used at the early stages to scout for potential checks and counters, as Scizor cannot afford to be Choice-locked into Bullet Punch against foes that resist it. As this set doesn't have the bulk and recovery to take repeated hits, it's best to send it out on Fairy-types and other defensive foes like Cresselia and Ferrothorn or come in on a free turn. It might also be a good idea to use U-turn on obvious switches against Fairy-types because there is no drawback in doing so and it will help weaken the opponent's team enough for Bullet Punch to clean.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Landorus-T forms a nice U-turn core with Scizor, as Scizor takes Ice-type attacks while Landorus-T helps eliminate Fire-types with its EdgeQuake combination. Garchomp provides Stealth Rock support while also eliminating Heatran and Magnezone, which are huge threats to Scizor. Hydreigon enjoys Fairy-types being threatened and removed by Scizor while threatening Scizor's checks through sheer power in return. Rotom-W is a nice teammate for Scizor, being able to take on Fire-types well while forming a solid VoltTurn core. Mega Salamence pairs well with non-Mega Scizor, being able to threaten opposing physical Fire-types with Intimidate. Chansey appreciates Scizor's ability to Pursuit trap Gengar, one of Chansey's counters, while easily absorbing special Fire-type moves aimed at Scizor. Thundurus is helpful for being able to paralyze Fire-type sweepers such as Blaziken, Mega Charizard X, and Volcarona with Prankster Thunder Wave while also eliminating Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y for Scizor to function with less fear.</p>"
      },
      {
        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Bullet Punch is Scizor's main STAB move and also has priority to pick off weakened targets, and it hits Fairy-types for decent damage even without investment. U-turn is Scizor's secondary STAB move, allowing it to gain more favorable matchups against its checks and counters through switching out as they switch in. Roost is necessary to heal off damage, allowing Scizor to further rack up damage to physical threats such as Mega Kangaskhan through Rocky Helmet. Toxic should be used in the fourth slot because it can help Scizor wear down defensive foes such as Garchomp and Landorus-T, especially because this Scizor has no means to do so otherwise. However, Knock Off is a viable alternative that removes items from foes while offering some coverage for those that resist Bug and Steel, like Thundurus and Heatran, on the switch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An Impish nature is used as well as maximum investment in HP and Defense in order to get the most use of Rocky Helmet and take on physical attackers as effectively as possible. Rocky Helmet inflicts extra damage on physical attackers whenever they make contact, which is especially helpful against Mega Kangaskhan due to Parental Bond letting it hit twice every turn. Scizorite is an alternative to Rocky Helmet that gives Scizor a large boost in Defense and Special Defense, but losing the passive damage from Rocky Helmet may be unappealing. Technician is Scizor's best ability and should always be used over other abilities unless you're using Mega Scizor, in which case Light Metal can be used to soften damage from attacks like Low Kick.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Scizor can be sent in on powerful physical attackers such as Mega Heracross, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mamoswine. U-turn should always have priority over Roost if Scizor is decently healthy, in case there is a Fire-type at the back, as Scizor cannot afford to stay in on one and potentially allow free boosts. As this set lacks any Attack investment and doesn't run any boosting moves, it heavily relies on Toxic and Rocky Helmet to do most of the damage. Status such as burn, paralysis, and confusion from Swagger doesn't cripple this Scizor as much as other sets due to the passive damage Rocky Helmet and Toxic still offer. Despite not having any investment in Special Defense, Scizor is still able to beat Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Raikou forms a nice VoltTurn core with Scizor due to the latter's ability to switch into powerful Earthquakes for Raikou and spread Toxic to weaken Raikou's checks. Mega Kangaskhan pairs well with Scizor due to its ability to counter Cresselia, which is one of the best checks to Kangaskhan. Salamence enjoys the removal of Mamoswine, and its Intimidate also helps Scizor take physical attacks better to rack up more damage from Rocky Helmet. Volcarona is a decent partner for Scizor, as Chansey is a huge threat to it and Scizor can Knock Off its item or cripple it with Toxic. Scizor can help Mega Charizard X take on Landorus-T and cripple Hippowdon and Unaware Quagsire with Toxic, which are major nuisances to Mega Charizard X.</p>"

        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance is used to boost Scizor's Attack quickly, as it wouldn't be able to do much damage due to the lack of investment in Attack. Iron Defense may be used over Swords Dance as an alternative setup move that makes Scizor very hard to take down with both physical and special attacks after a single boost. Roost provides Scizor with instant recovery to allow it more opportunities to set up. Knock Off offers nice coverage against Ghost-types like Aegislash and is mainly used to threaten Fire-type switch-ins that carry items. U-turn is a strong STAB attack Scizor can use to maintain momentum while also checking to see if it's safe to set up during the earlier stages of the match. Toxic is a nice option in the final slot that can be used to wear down defensive foes such as Cresselia and Porygon2, which would not take much from Scizor's STAB moves when it is not using Swords Dance.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Careful nature with maximum investment in HP is needed to make Scizor as specially bulky as possible. Allocating 204 EVs into Special Defense allows Mega Scizor to survive two Thunderbolt from Life Orb Thundurus. Maximum Special Defense investment can also be used so that Hydro Pump Greninja only has a 2% chance to 2HKO Mega Scizor. Scizorite should be used with the given spread, as it offers Scizor significantly more bulk to ease setup. Lum Berry is an option to grab a boost before getting crippled by burn or paralysis. Light Metal can be used if using Mega Scizor, but Technician should always be the ability for Scizor when it is running Lum Berry.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Swords Dance and Iron Defense Scizor function very differently; Swords Dance Scizor is used like a sweeper, while the Iron Defense variant relies more on Toxic to stall out the foe. Scizor can easily set up on Pokemon that cannot touch it, such as Fairy-types like non-Hidden Power Fire Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir. When running Iron Defense, Scizor can set up on special attackers to prevent physical threats such as Garchomp and Landorus-T from threatening it out when they switch in. Scizor should be sent in to sponge powerful special attacks, notably from Gengar, Greninja, and Mega Gardevoir, and proceed to set up on them. Due to the little investment in Defense, Scizor is rather vulnerable to physical attacks without Iron Defense boosts. Iron Defense works best with Toxic on the same set, as the lack of Attack investment means Bullet Punch won't be threatening.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gliscor makes for a fantastic partner for Scizor, having good physical bulk and functioning as a decent status absorber, while Scizor can easily help Gliscor take super effective Ice- and Water-type attacks. Slowbro is another nice physical wall to cover Scizor's physical weakness and helps Scizor remove Fire-types such as Blaziken and Talonflame with relative ease. Mega Kangaskhan appreciates Scizor's ability to remove Rocky Helmet from Cresselia and Eviolite from Porygon2 so that Kangaskhan has an easier time breaking through physical walls that annoy it. Azumarill works great with Scizor due to its ability to come in on many Electric-, Grass-, and Poison-type attacks, while Azumarill can help absorb Fire-type attacks and retaliate with powerful STAB moves. Talonflame doesn't offer as much defensive synergy as Azumarill, but it still resists Fire and is able to revenge kill Blaziken. Physically defensive Rotom-W also has very nice synergy with Scizor, being able to cripple physical threats to allow Scizor more opportunities to set up while potentially completing a VoltTurn core if Scizor is using U-turn.</p>"

  "Heracross": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Heracross has the highest base Attack stat in Battle Spot Singles. Couple that with its exceptional ability in Skill Link, making all its multi-hit moves hit 5 times, and its access to moves that take advantage of this ability, and you can see why Mega Heracross is one of the best wallbreakers in the metagame. Its coverage moves, including Pin Missile, Close Combat, Rock Blast, Bullet Seed, and Earthquake, are perfect for taking down the most common physical walls in Battle Spot, namely Cresselia, Suicune, and Zapdos. Aside from Mega Heracross's offensive capabilities, its good bulk before and after Mega Evolving allows Mega Heracross to take a few hits, and its defensive typing means it resists common types, such as Ground and Fighting, giving it a good matchup against Pokemon like Mamoswine and Lucario. This Bug / Fighting typing also gives Mega Heracross a resistance to Dark, giving it an edge against Swagger + Foul Play users.</p> <p>Despite all this, though, Mega Heracross still has trouble beating a number of common offensive Pokemon. Heracross's low Speed and even lower Speed when Mega Evolved means that Heracross is outsped by a great number of the offensive threats. On top of that, while its defensive typing gives Heracross some good resistances, this typing also leaves Heracross weak to some very common attacking types, such as Fire and Flying, which means immense pressure is put on it from Blaziken and Talonflame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance can give Mega Heracross absolutely terrifying Attack, but the move comes at the cost of coverage. Substitute serves as a means to dodge common status moves that physical walls tend to throw at Heracross, such as Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp, and it makes Mega Heracross very difficult to revenge kill. Heracross can run a number of sets without its Mega Stone, but you'll usually want to opt for the higher Attack and Skill Link. An Assault Vest set with Guts and Pursuit can lure in Mega Gengar, a common counter to Heracross, and is especially useful on stall teams. Heracross can also run a Choice Scarf, turning it into a revenge killer. Moxie is especially useful on such sets, though the ability can also net Heracross an Attack boost before Mega Evolution by picking off threats. However, Guts is usually better for saving Heracross from being crippled by Will-O-Wisp and Scald.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types: Salamence can come in on Heracross, taking little damage from its moves, except for Rock Blast, thanks to Intimidate. Salamence can then use Dragon Dance to turn itself into an offensive powerhouse and decimate Heracross with Double-Edge, Return, or Hyper Voice. While Talonflame has to be wary of getting hit by Rock Blast on the switch, Heracross has no chance of living a Brave Bird from any variant of Talonflame. Skarmory risks a 2HKO from Close Combat, but if it gets in safely, it can OHKO Mega Heracross with Drill Peck after Heracross has had its defenses lowered by Close Combat or straight up OHKO it with Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash: Aegislash's only worry is switching into Earthquake; otherwise, it either completely walls Mega Heracross or gets a Weakness Policy boost from Earthquake if it gets in safely.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar can trap Mega Heracross and burn it with Will-O-Wisp, crippling it for the rest of the match. Note that Mega Gengar without Will-O-Wisp take serious damage from Rock Blast and are always OHKOed by Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Mega Mawile</strong>: Mega Mawile only risks an OHKO from Heracross's Earthquake if Heracross hasn't had its Attack lowered; in return it grabs an easy OHKO on Mega Heracross with Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Mega Altaria</strong>: Mega Altaria takes massive damage from Rock Blast, but it can otherwise come in and OHKO Mega Heracross with Pixilate Hyper Voice or Return.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Mega Manectric drastically reduce Mega Heracross's wallbreaking power, especially when they are in a VoltTurn core.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Although Heracross has great bulk, when weakened it can often be taken out by faster Pokemon with strong attacks, especially after defensive drops from Close Combat. Examples of faster Pokemon include Garchomp, Charizard, Latios, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Gardevoir.</p> <p><strong>Blaziken: Blaziken is faster than Heracross and can hit it with a super effective Flare Blitz. However, under Trick Room, Heracross can beat it with Close Combat and Earthquake.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Pin Missile reaches an effective Base Power of 125 with Skill Link. Its primary targets are Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Slowbro, as well as Grass-types such as Serperior. An added perk is that Pin Missile can break Focus Sashes and Substitutes and avoid Rocky Helmet damage. Rock Blast is another move affected by Skill Link and is Mega Heracross's best option for hitting the Flying-types that it otherwise has trouble with, such as Thundurus, Dragonite, Zapdos, Gyarados, and predicted Talonflame and Mega Salamence switch-ins. Close Combat hits Steel- and Normal-types, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Porygon2, and Heatran, for super effective damage. Bullet Seed 2HKOes Suicune, Hippowdon, and defensive Rotom-W, and OHKOes Mamoswine and offensive Rotom-W. However, if Aegislash is a problem for your team, consider Earthquake instead of one of the last two moves to 2HKO it. As a bonus, Earthquake also guarantees an OHKO on maximum HP Mega Gengar. However, since Mega Heracross can only afford to give up Close Combat or Bullet Seed, choosing this alternative will come at the cost of coverage, and Close Combat and Bullet Seed hit a wider variety of threats harder than Earthquake in general.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Heracronite gives Heracross great offensive stats and an amazing ability. Before Mega Evolution, however, Guts can be used to absorb status moves so that Heracross isn't crippled by burns and paralysis. A spread of 156 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpDef / 92 Spe ensures that Mega Heracross takes less residual damage and outspeeds Cresselia.</p> <p>However, if Heracross doesn't need much bulk, consider a Jolly nature with a spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe. This allows Mega Heracross to outspeed the important targets Jolly Breloom and Adamant Dragonite, both of which hate multi-hit moves due to Focus Sash and Multiscale respectively. Because of this, Mega Heracross is actually a decent lead, as before Mega Evolving, Heracross outspeeds Mamoswine, meaning that Heracross can defeat two very popular Focus Sash leads. This offensive spread also allows Heracross to outspeed Adamant Kangaskhan before both Mega Evolve, potentially leading to a surprise KO.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Heracross functions as a good lead, because it has very few solid switch-ins. You can make use of its resistances very easily. Heracross can come in on a resisted hit, particularly Earthquake or Mach Punch, or a free switch, giving Heracross the opportunity to Mega Evolve and wreak havoc. While the best idea usually is to Mega Evolve as soon as possible for the extra bulk and power, there are a few instances where Heracross should stay unevolved. Heracross is a bit faster before it Mega Evolves, allowing it to outspeed certain threats such as Mamoswine. Also, if Heracross gets burned, it will deal more damage in its base forme than when Mega Evolved thanks to Guts. If you are using Heracross with a Healing Wish or Lunar Dance user, feel free to be more reckless with Mega Evolving, as these moves will remove burns from Mega Heracross.</p> <p>Since most physical and special walls have a low damage output, Heracross can very easily switch into them, provided Heracross can take out that wall with coverage moves. Slowbro and Suicune are prime examples, because prior to Heracross Mega Evolving, it can switch into Scald without any fear of being KOed or burned. Speed control such as paralysis and Trick Room is a godsend for Mega Heracross because speed control allows Mega Heracross to beat common offensive threats that would otherwise counter it. You might want to consider benching Heracross if the Team Preview shows many of Mega Heracross's offensive checks, such as Talonflame, Blaziken, and Mega Salamence, especially since these Pokemon are common leads.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cresselia can sponge most powerful hits for Heracross and provide it with Trick Room, Thunder Wave, and Lunar Dance support. Cresselia can also serve as a check to a lot of Pokemon that are faster than Heracross, such as Blaziken, Mega Salamence, and Kangaskhan. Porygon2 is another reliable user of Thunder Wave and Trick Room, and unlike Cresselia, offensive variants deal with special attacking Aegislash fairly well. Heatran can cover Heracross's weaknesses effectively and Heracross can break through special walls that Heatran can't get past, such as Chansey. Heatran also beats Talonflame and Aegislash reliably, which is a huge benefit for Heracross. Answers to Fire- and Flying- types in general really help out Heracross, as they can switch in on almost all of Heracross's attacks other than Rock Blast. Examples of these kinds of Pokemon include Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Tyranitar. Thundurus deserves a special mention here, as it can not only beat Flying-types easily, but also spread paralysis throughout the opposing team. Raikou deals with Flying-types well and can set up with Calm Mind, while Mega Heracross deals with Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, Mamoswine, and Chansey for Raikou. Landorus-T serves as a blanket check to a lot of the common Pokemon that threaten Heracross, such as physical Blaziken, Talonflame, and sometimes Mega Kangaskhan, and can provide Heracross with U-turn support, an effective way to switch in Heracross safely. In addition, Landorus-T has Intimidate, which can force a lot of switches and provide Heracross with great support. Talonflame makes for a good partner as well, taking care of Blaziken and Volcarona, and defeating weakened Pokemon in general. Greninja is a good choice to provide Mega Heracross with additional coverage that can hit common threats super effectively, such as Garchomp and Gengar. A Mega Gengar of your own is a great back up Mega Evolution, since it can use Destiny Bond to trap and KO Mega Mawile and Aegislash. Focus Sash Gengar works too if you want to use it with Mega Heracross or other Mega Evolutions, and it can use Icy Wind to surprise Mega Salamence.</p>"

  "Skarmory": {
    "overview": "<p>Skarmory's very useful resistances granted by its Steel / Flying typing, its high defense, and its reliable recovery make it a great check to many physically attacking Pokemon, and its support options make it a great addition to a bulkier stall team. However, Skarmory can easily be broken by almost any sort of special attacker, and physical Fire-types will be able to eventually muscle their way through its defenses. It's also quite slow and passive, meaning it greatly damages momentum when used on a non-stall team. However, it is still a great addition to most stall teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Heatran or Charizard can stop Skarmory easily with their powerful Fire attacks. Even physical Fire-types, such as Talonflame or Blaziken, will be able to muscle through Skarmory with a boost.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Rotom, Manectric, and Zapdos can all take out Skarmory with a powerful Electric attack. They can also gain momentum against Skarmory's team with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Although they might not hit Skarmory super effectively, any kind of strong special attacker, such as Hydreigon, Aegislash, Greninja, or Gengar, will deal a load of damage to it. Gengar especially can Mega Evolve and trap Skarmory or one of its partners, putting a big hole in Skarmory's stall core.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt users such as Sableye and Talonflame can disable Skarmory and then use it as an opportunity to set up.</p> <p><strong>Lures: Physical attackers that Skarmory normally counters, such as Garchomp, Kangaskhan, or Tyranitar, can lure it in and then use a surprise special attack.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Roost keeps Skarmory healthy throughout the match and prevents Skarmory from being worn down. It also removes Skarmory's Flying type for the turn, giving Skarmory resistances to Rock and Ice while also giving weaknesses to Ground and Fighting. Toxic is Skarmory's main way of dealing damage, allowing it to simply use Roost and stall until the foe faints. Stealth Rock is another option, helping to wear down opposing switch-ins; however, Toxic is better to take down an individual target. Whirlwind combos well with Stealth Rock, as it forces the foe out. It is also useful for removing boosting Pokemon, especially Minimize users, as it ignores evasion boosts, Substitutes, and Protect. Drill Peck is the main STAB attack, and Iron Head is an alternate option that hurts Rock- and Fairy-types more and has a chance to flinch slower attackers. Brave Bird can also be used, as it is more powerful. However, it gives recoil, which can put Skarmory into 2HKO range against certain attackers, and forces Skarmory to use Roost more often. It also prevents Skarmory from keeping Sturdy active.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EVs are straightforward: maximum HP and maximum Defense help to make Skarmory as bulky as possible. Rocky Helmet is to deal passive damage; as Skarmory is used to check physical attackers, it will be hit with contact moves very often. Leftovers is an alternate option if another Pokemon is already using the team's Rocky Helmet. Sturdy is the best ability, as it makes Skarmory immune to OHKO moves and allows Skarmory to survive any hit from full health and use at least one move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Skarmory is rather straightforward: just bring it in against unboosted physical attackers that are not Fire-types, such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Kangaskhan, or Tyranitar, or against passive stall Pokemon such as Cresselia or Hippowdon. Toxic is the main move you will want to use most of the time to assure that the opposing Pokemon is taking damage each turn. Once the foe is poisoned, Roost to heal the damage until the opposing Pokemon switches out or faints. If it tries to boost, use Whirlwind to remove it. If you opt to use Stealth Rock over Toxic, use Whirlwind whenever possible to force switches and cause your opponent's Pokemon to take entry hazard damage. Use an attack to finish off a low-HP foe, or if the foe is already poisoned and you do not yet need to Roost.</p> <p>Although Roost is an all-around a good move, in some cases it can make Skarmory more vulnerable. Roost removes Skarmory's Flying type for the remainder of the turn, which gives it resistances to Rock and Ice, but also makes it weak to Ground and Fighting. This means that slower Ground and Fighting attackers such as Rhyperior or Conkeldurr will be able to hit Skarmory with a more powerful attack on the turn it uses Roost. In these cases, using Roost will require some predictions to minimize the damage Skarmory takes.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Skarmory greatly appreciates bulky partner Pokemon that can help it form a stall core. Its most common partner is Chansey, which can take any special attack for Skarmory. Slowbro, Gliscor, and Venusaur are other common stall Pokemon that have good synergy with Skarmory. For more bulky offensive partners, Latias likes having opposing strong physical attackers removed and can also take some special hits for Skarmory. It also greatly appreciates having Tyranitar and Cresselia removed by Skarmory. Tyranitar itself is a good partner as well, as it can also take special hits and has good type synergy with Skarmory. More offensive Pokemon, such as Salamence, Volcarona, or Greninja, benefit from having the opposing team worn down by Toxic or Stealth Rock. However, as Skarmory is a more defensive Pokemon, it can often be a liability to an offensive team's momentum.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance is an option to make Skarmory more offensive so it can use its STAB moves such as Iron Head or Brave Bird. Keen Eye might seem like a good option at first to counter evasion strategies, but it is inferior to Sturdy, as Whirlwind already ignores evasion boosts. Spikes is generally inferior to Stealth Rock, as it takes several turns to set up. However, on a full stall team it can sometimes be worth it. Taunt is another option to use against opposing stall teams, along with 132 Speed EVs for Skarmory to outspeed and Taunt Cresselia. Iron Defense is also an option to double Skarmory's Defense, making it even harder to wear down. However, this strategy is susceptible to critical hits and it can be hard to find a moveslot to use for it.</p>"

  "Houndoom": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Houndoom is one of the more lesser used Mega Evolutions in the Battle Spot metagame because there are much more reliable ones, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Salamence. As a fast special attacker, it's also outclassed by Mega Charizard Y, although its base 115 Speed and access to Nasty Plot give it a niche. Mega Houndoom is able to act as an excellent wallbreaker on offensive teams due to its powerful Special Attack, tearing down walls such as Mega Sableye, Cresselia, Ferrothorn, Zapdos, and Gliscor. It also has a nice Dark / Fire typing, which lets it take on various threats in the metagame such as Mega Metagross, Mega Gengar, Mega Mawile, and Aegislash. Even though it has a nice set of resistances, its typing leaves it weak to Rock-, Water-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves. Thanks to Solar Power, Mega Houndoom functions very well under sun, whether it comes from a teammate or from the opponent's Mega Charizard Y; however, the ability also makes it lose 1/8 of its HP every turn. Mega Houndoom has a nice movepool with options such as such as Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, Pursuit, and Sucker Punch, providing support, utility, and a way to pick off foes that switch and foes that attack, respectively. However, Mega Houndoom's mediocre bulk makes it easy for foes to KO it, especially for faster Pokemon and priority attackers such as Mega Salamence, Mega Lopunny, Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Blaziken, Azumarill, and Conkeldurr.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Focus Sash can be used on a set running Destiny Bond, Counter, Flamethrower, and Dark Pulse. Focus Sash and Counter work well together because of Houndoom's terrible defenses. It can then use Destiny Bond on another Pokemon the opponent has sent out. Flamethrower and Dark Pulse are both filler moves in the set. It also doesn't need to run any defensive EVs due to Houndoom's frailty. Sunny Day activates Mega Houndoom's Solar Power, allowing it to hit harder, but it'll have to waste a turn to use it. The foe can attack it while it tries to set up Sunny Day, and Solar Power also makes Mega Houndoom lose a little health each turn sun is up, making it a risky strategy. Nasty Plot has essentially the same effect without the drawbacks. Solar Beam can be used together with Sunny Day instead of Hidden Power Grass so that it doesn't need a turn to charge. However, this means that Mega Houndoom's primary coverage move for Water-types is dependent on the sun being up, so there's no point in using it. Overheat can be used over Flamethrower or Fire Blast for even more power. It will deal a lot more damage after Houndoom has switched into a Fire-type move or when the attack is used under sun. However, Overheat lowers Mega Houndoom's Special Attack by two stages after each use. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers, which helps Mega Houndoom take physical hits better. Sucker Punch gives it priority to pick off weakened foes. Pursuit can be used to trap and deal extra damage to Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Cresselia and Gengar. Hidden Power Ice allows Mega Houndoom to hit Dragon-, Flying-, and Ground-types such as Mega Salamence, Garchomp, Dragonite, and Landorus-T for super effective damage. Protect allows Houndoom to Mega Evolve safely against Pokemon that are faster than its base forme and slower than its Mega forme. However, Mega Houndoom has no room for that move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types, such as Suicune, Rotom-W, and Mega Gyarados, can all take Fire Blast from Mega Houndoom and can retaliate with their Water-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Porygon2 and Chansey can wall Mega Houndoom's attacks. Porygon2 can Trace Houndoom's Flash Fire before it has Mega Evolved, making its Fire-type attacks useless. Chansey can take any special attack that Mega Houndoom can dish out and then cripple it with Toxic or Thunder Wave. Clefable has Unaware, which ignores Mega Houndoom's stat boosts from Nasty Plot, and can set up with Cosmic Power or Calm Mind, as well as stall it with Moonlight. Beware that Mega Houndoom can use Chansey as setup fodder for Nasty Plot after using Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Mega Blaziken: Mega Blaziken resists both of Mega Houndoom's STAB moves due to its Fire / Fighting typing. It can use Protect to get a boost from Speed Boost, outspeeding Mega Houndoom and OHKOing with High Jump Kick.</p> <p><strong>Conkeldurr</strong>: Conkeldurr resists Mega Houndoom's Dark Pulse and can survive a Fire-type attack, as it usually carries Assault Vest. It can then retaliate with Drain Punch or revenge kill it with Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Azumarill</strong>: Azumarill resists both of Mega Houndoom's STAB attacks and use it as setup fodder to get a Belly Drum off. It can then OHKO it with Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Greninja</strong>: Greninja outspeeds Mega Houndoom and OHKOes it with its Water-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite has Multiscale, which makes it take only half damage from any of Mega Houndoom's attacks while it's at full health. It can set up with Dragon Dance and outspeed Mega Houndoom or OHKO it with a Choice Band-boosted Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Tyranitar, resist Mega Houndoom's Fire-type moves and put offensive pressure on it. Both regular and Mega Aerodactyl outspeed Mega Houndoom and can OHKO it with Stone Edge. Tyranitar also resists Mega Houndoom's Dark-type moves and can KO it with its Rock-type STAB moves.</p>",

      {
        "name": "Mega Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Mega Houndoom's Special Attack by two stages, allowing it to hit harder. Dark Pulse hits Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Cresselia, Aegislash, and Gengar. Fire Blast is the preferred Fire-type STAB move, as it hits very hard after a Nasty Plot or under sun, but it has a chance to miss. Flamethrower is an alternative Fire-type STAB move with perfect accuracy but much less power. Destiny Bond allows Mega Houndoom to take down the opposing Pokemon upon being KOed, getting rid of a threat to its teammates or any other foe that it's not able to take down, such as Suicune. Hidden Power Grass gives Mega Houndoom coverage against Rock-, Ground-, and Water-types such as Rhyperior, Mega Gyarados, Azumarill, and Swampert. Taunt can be used instead of Hidden Power Grass or Destiny Bond to make Mega Houndoom an efficient stallbreaker, allowing it to prevent Pokemon such as Chansey, Clefable, and Porygon2 from setting up or inflicting status ailments.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Mega Houndoom to have more sweeping potential, hitting hard and fast. It also allows it to outspeed base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Gallade, Mega Metagross, Latios, Latias, and Gengar. A Timid nature is preferred over a Modest nature, as Modest would put Mega Houndoom in a Speed tie with base 100 Speed Pokemon. The remaining 4 Special Defense EVs are used to prevent Porygon2 from getting a Special Attack boost from Download. If Hidden Power Grass is being used instead of Destiny Bond, an IV spread of 31 / 30 / 31 / 30 / 31 / 31 and an EV spread of 4 HP / 248 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe should be used. Flash Fire gives Houndoom immunity to Fire-type moves and allows it to switch into a predicted Fire-type attack, increasing the power of its own Fire-type attacks before Mega Evolving. Houndoominite is used to Mega Evolve Houndoom, boosting its Special Attack, Speed, and bulk and granting it the ability Solar Power, allowing its attacks to hit harder under sun.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Houndoom should try to switch in after a teammate has fainted so that it doesn't take any damage. Mega Houndoom should set up Nasty Plot on defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Mandibuzz, and Cresselia. Don't try to set up Nasty Plot if Mega Houndoom's checks or counters are not KOed yet.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gengar provides great synergy with Mega Houndoom, as it is immune to Fighting-type attacks, while Mega Houndoom is immune to Psychic-type attacks. Gengar can handle Mega Kangaskhan and Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir, Azumarill, and Sylveon. It can also stallbreak Chansey if it runs Taunt, and Mega Houndoom can take on Pokemon faster than Gengar such as Weavile and non-Focus Blast Alakazam in return. Rotom-W can be an excellent pivot with Volt Switch, bringing in Mega Houndoom safely. Rotom-W can also handle Rock-, Ground-, and Water-types such as Tyranitar, Garchomp, and Azumarill, respectively, while Mega Houndoom can handle Grass-types such as Serperior. Rotom-W can also wall Talonflame, which can potentially prey on Mega Houndoom's frailty. It can also burn Fighting-types with Will-O-Wisp, but it must be careful of those with Guts such as Conkeldurr and Heracross. Gyarados also provides great synergy with Mega Houndoom because it resists Fighting- and Water-type moves. It's also immune to Ground-type attacks and can use them to set up. Also note that Gyarados has Intimidate, which can help soften physical attacks aimed at Mega Houndoom. Klefki and Thundurus pair well with Mega Houndoom, as they both provide Thunder Wave support, allowing Mega Houndoom to gain the Speed advantage over the opposing team. Thundurus helps deal with Water-types as well. Houndoom can also make use of Ferrothorn and Scizor to lure in Fire-type attacks to get a free switch in and Flash Fire boost.</p>"

  "Porygon2": {
    "overview": "<p>It's easy to brush off Porygon2 as a useless pre-evolution, but thanks to Eviolite, Porygon2 is a Battle Spot Singles super star! Eviolite gives Porygon2 an incredible amount of bulk, which, when combined with Porygon2's sole weakness to Fighting, makes it a very versatile Pokemon. Porygon's checking prowess is nearly unmatched, allowing Porygon2 to take on fearsome threats such as Greninja, Mega Salamence, and Aegislash. With Download and Analytic, Porygon2 takes the opposite role and becomes a surprisingly strong special attacker that surprises its offensive checks. Porygon2 is even the premier Trick Room user of Battle Spot Singles, allowing fearsome threats such as Mega Mawile to run rampant!</p> <p>This awesome versatility comes at a cost though: Porygon2's uncanny ability to glue teams together makes it an extremely high-value target. Many teams will run problematic Pokemon for Porygon2 together, such as Blaziken and Mega Gengar, specifically to try to overload Porygon2. Also, although Porygon2 is only weak to Fighting-type attacks, it has no resistances and only a Ghost immunity, meaning that strong, boosted neutral attacks can still do a lot of damage to Porygon2. Porygon2's wonderful Eviolite can also be its undoing, as Trick and Knock Off can get rid of it, crippling Porygon2's bulk. While these are important flaws to address, they don't change the fact that Porygon2 is an incredibly easy Pokemon to fit on most teams. If your team is in desperate need of a defensive check to Battle Spot Singles's top threats, or you are in need of a bulky offensive Pokemon, Porygon2 should always be highly considered.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Psychic doesn't offer very good coverage, but it does allow Porygon2 to 2HKO Conkeldurr and Mega Venusaur with a Download boost. Porygon2 has the ability to boost its Special Attack with Charge Beam, but it usually doesn't have the time to boost. Conversion and Conversion 2 can screw up Fighting-type checks, but it's difficult to fit them onto Porygon2's sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mega Mawile: By far the most effective check to Porygon2, Mawile can switch in on anything Porygon2 throws at it and threaten to remove its Eviolite with Knock Off, or even set up for a sweep with Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Bisharp: While it is not quite as effective as Mega Mawile, Bisharp can similarly Knock Off Porygon2's Eviolite and set up Swords Dance with ease. It must watch out for Hidden Power Ground, though, which will 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Conkeldurr</strong>: Conkeldurr gets special mention compared to other Fighting-types. Even offensive Porygon2 is unable to 2HKO Assault Vest Conkeldurr, while Conkeldurr gets an easy 2HKO with Drain Punch. Conkeldurr's Guts and low Speed mean that Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Trick Room won't do much either.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type Pokemon such as Blaziken, Heracross, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Lucario can blast through Porygon2's impressive defenses. None of these Pokemon like Thunder Wave or boosted Tri Attacks, though.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick: Porygon2 relies on Eviolite to withstand powerful attacks, so losing Eviolite via Knock Off or Trick can ruin Porygon2's ability to check threats.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Although Mega Gengar hates Thunder Wave, it can use Taunt and Destiny Bond to take defensive Porygon2 down. Mega Gengar must watch out for offensive Porygon2, though, as Shadow Ball is an easy 2HKO on it.</p> <p><strong>Wobbuffet</strong>: Wobbuffet might not be as effective of a trapper as Mega Gengar, but it can still turn Porygon2 into setup bait for dangerous sweepers. Also, when paired with Mega Gengar, Wobbuffet can trap Porygon2 into a Perish Song cycle.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind</strong>: Calm Mind users such as Suicune, Sylveon, and Mega Sableye can use Porygon2 as setup bait, as Rest (or Magic Bounce in Mega Sableye's case) means they don't care about Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn: Ferrothorn laughs at anything Porygon2 will use, with the exception of Hidden Power Fire, and can stall it out with Leech Seed or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Much like Ferrothorn, Mega Venusaur can Leech Seed stall Porygon2 with ease.</p> <p><strong>Toxic and Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Toxic in general is bad news for Porygon2, effectively crippling its ability to wall threats. This can open up avenues for dangerous sweepers to blast through teams! While not quite as effective at wearing Porygon2 down, Will-O-Wisp is still an unwelcoming situation for it.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt is an effective way of shutting down Porygon2's defensive options, making it a sitting duck against many offensive threats.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Beam is Porygon2's most important offensive tool, allowing it to check dangerous threats such as Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Landorus-T. Be careful about Landorus-T though, as it has a habit of carrying Knock Off. Foul Play is Porygon2's other main offensive tool. When combined with Trace, it allows Porygon2 to check threats such as Mega Kangaskhan and Belly Drum Azumarill. Recover allows Porygon2 to have some serious staying power.</p> <p>Thunder Wave is an excellent status move in Battle Spot Singles and is a good choice if your team has more problems with Porygon2's offensive checks. Toxic, meanwhile, is the only way Porygon2 can do any meaningful damage to the extremely common Rotom-W. Toxic is also Porygon2's best tool against its other main problem: other defensive Pokemon with Toxic! Discharge is a good midway option if you want to have a secondary special attack while still being able to spread paralysis, thanks to its 30% infliction rate. Discharge will allow Porygon2 to deal a good amount of damage to Azumarill, making it far more risky for Azumarill to set up Belly Drum. Discharge also allows Porygon2 to 2HKO Gyarados and offensive Talonflame. If you just want to do a bit more damage to foes (especially Azumarill) but don't care about the paralysis, you can opt to use Thunderbolt instead.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Eviolite is what makes Porygon2 such a bulky Pokemon, so make sure you don't forget to put that on your Porygon2! The HP EVs may seem a bit strange, but they give Porygon2 an odd amount of HP. This lets Porygon2 take less damage from sand, Stealth Rock, hail, and status, giving it an extra bit of longevity at almost no cost to bulk. Maximizing the Defense stat is a must, as it allows Porygon2 to check a ton of Pokemon. The remaining EVs are put into Special Defense for an extra bit of bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because Porygon2 is all about checking many of Battle Spot Singles's big threats, you'll usually find yourself using Porygon2 in a rather reactive way, switching into big threats and using the predicted switch to try to punish your opponent with status moves or Foul Play. A word of warning: in most cases, you should resist the urge to use Foul Play on Aegislash. Most Aegislash use a mixed attacking set with Weakness Policy. Porygon2 can normally wall this set, but if you use Foul Play, Aegislash will now be able to 2HKO Porygon2 with Sacred Sword!</p> <p>Trace is a very unique and useful asset for Porygon2, so make sure to take advantage of it whenever possible. Defensively, Trace makes Porygon2 a great switch-in to Salamence before it Mega Evolves, as Porygon2 can lower its Attack with Intimidate. Porygon2 can also do the same with Mawile, but note that Mega Mawile beats Porygon2 one-on-one. Heatran and Manectric before it Mega Evolves are also good targets for defensive uses of Trace, due to their abilities making Porygon2 immune to their main attacks. For more offensive uses of Trace, Mega Kangaskhan is a prime target, as Parental Bond can give Porygon2 more offensive presence than usual. Greninja's Protean can also aid Porygon2 offensively and remove its Fighting-type weakness when Porygon2 uses Toxic or an Electric-type attack, but note that becoming Ice-type gives Porygon2 many new weaknesses.</p> <p>If you face an opponent who doesn't appear to have a Porygon2 check, don't take that as an easy win: it's very possible that your opponent is trying to ensnare your Porygon2 with some kind of lure! For example, an opponent might be running Substitute + Toxic Aegislash or Power-Up Punch Mega Kangaskhan. When seeing these kinds of teams, consider choosing the Pokemon that are good at dealing with lure-related emergencies for your team.</p> <p>On a final note, one topic that must be addressed is Mega Gengar. Mega Gengar can be specialized to become a devastatingly effective way to trap Porygon2 thanks to Destiny Bond and Taunt. Teams that use sweepers particularly weak to Porygon2 are known to do this. Mega Gengar is extremely difficult to directly check due to Shadow Tag, so the best way to check it is not so much bringing a specific Pokemon but more about planning ahead. If you see a team that could be using this kind of Mega Gengar, consider not leading with Porygon2 and possibly even making risky double switches into predicted Gengar switches. Sometimes, it's possible that the key to overcoming a matchup like this is to put Gengar into an unfavorable matchup before it Mega Evolves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>When talking about Porygon2's teammates, it's important to first note the Pokemon that try to take advantage of Porygon2. Two of the most dangerous examples are Mega Gengar and Mega Mawile, while more general offensive threats to Porygon2 are Fighting-types such as Blaziken, Heracross, and Mega Lopunny. Moreover, Porygon2 doesn't do that great against more defensive threats. While it can cripple opposing Porygon2 and Cresselia with Toxic, having your own Porygon2 hit with Toxic can cripple its ability to check some of the more powerful threats of Battle Spot Singles. Of particular note are Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur, which have nothing to fear from Porygon2 and can ensnare Porygon2 into the clutches of their Leech Seed! Teammates that resist Fighting are highly recommended when using Porygon2. Talonflame is a fantastic offensive example, as it can support Porygon2 in other ways. Its powerful priority Brave Bird preys on Fighting-types and smashes Mega Gengar and Mega Venusaur, while Flare Blitz scorches Mega Mawile and Ferrothorn. In a funny twist of fate, Porygon2's archnemesis, Mega Gengar, works here as well, aiding Porygon2 with a Fighting immunity and Shadow Tag to defeat many defensive Pokemon, while Porygon2's Thunder Wave allows Mega Gengar to effectively revenge kill Choice Scarf threats. On the more defensive side of teammates, Cresselia, the other premier defensive Pokemon, happens to pair reasonably well with Porygon2. Cresselia resists Fighting, while Porygon2 provides Cresselia with backup against Greninja and Aegislash (watch out for Substitute, though).</p> <p>If you choose Thunder Wave in the last moveslot, make sure to take advantage of it! Most sweepers in general can find a situation where they can win a game because of paralysis, but two Pokemon in particular deserve a special mention. Mega Mawile is a fantastic teammate in this regard. Paralyzing threats such as Blaziken can give Mega Mawile the breakthrough it needs to win the game! Garchomp, while already fast on its own, is much harder to defeat when fast checks such as Mega Lopunny are crippled. Garchomp itself can aid Porygon2 in a particular emergency, surviving a +2 Sucker Punch from Mega Kangaskhan and often destroying it thanks to Rough Skin.</p> <p>Take special care in avoiding Trick and Knock Off, as losing Eviolite compromises Porygon2's ability to check threats. Common users of Knock Off that don't already hit Porygon2 super effectively include Azumarill, Mega Mawile, Bisharp, and Weavile, while common users of Trick include Rotom-W and Rotom-H. Thankfully, Mega Evolutions are immune to losing their item, making them fine ways to halt attempts at removing Porygon2's Eviolite. Mega Evolutions that resist Knock Off such as Blaziken, Tyranitar, and Heracross work especially well.</p>"

        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Beam is Porygon2's main offensive tool, grabbing easy OHKOs on the many Pokemon doubly weak to Ice in Battle Spot Singles and even doing over 90% to physically defensive Hippowdon. Shadow Ball lets Porygon2 smash one of its archnemeses, Mega Gengar, with offensive variants facing an OHKO after a Download boost. Additionally, Analytic Porygon2 will OHKO Aegislash when it is in its Blade forme, while a Download boost can allow Porygon to 2HKO Cresselia. While this Porygon2 focuses on offense, Recover is still a staple, as it allows Porygon2 to check specially offensive threats such as Aegislash and Greninja.</p> <p>The last move is a bit trickier to choose, as Porygon2 has many viable options. Tri Attack is an easy choice offensively. While it offers Porygon2 no additional coverage, the STAB boost makes Tri Attack a good general attacking option. Notably, Tri Attack 2HKOes Mega Charizard X with an Analytic boost and 2HKOes Mega Kangaskhan with a Download boost. If you're more worried about coverage, Hidden Power Ground is a fine option, 2HKOing Mega Charizard X, Mega Mawile, and Heatran with a boost. Hidden Power Fire still hits Mega Mawile but also gives Porygon2 a way to smash through Scizor and Ferrothorn. Thunder Wave gives Porygon2 an additional way to support the team, while Discharge gives Porygon2 a move that slams Gyarados and Skarmory while still potentially spreading paralysis. Toxic can also be used to fix Porygon2's issues with walls such as Cresselia and other Porygon2.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs are needed to give Porygon2 a reasonable offensive presence. 244 HP EVs reduce residual damage against Porygon2, while the 12 EVs in Defense are simply filler, giving Porygon2 a bit of extra physical bulk. Eviolite is required, as the massive boosts in defenses are far more useful than an offensive boost. A Modest nature is usually the best for Porygon2, giving it extra special attacking power while letting it outspeed Mega Mawile. However, if using Analytic, a Quiet nature with 0 Speed IVs should be considered, allowing Porygon2 to underspeed Mega Mawile and Speed tie with mixed Aegislash.</p> <p>The big decision to make on Porygon2 is choosing between Download and Analytic, which is essentially a choice between power and reliability. Download gives Porygon2 the most power, letting it gain KOs on important targets such as Mega Gengar. However, Download will only boost Porygon2's Special Attack against Pokemon that have a higher Defense stat than Special Defense, making useful Download boosts not guaranteed. Analytic offers a 30% boost instead of a 50% boost and requires Porygon2 to move last or attack on the switch to activate. However, because Porygon2 is already fairly slow, Analytic is less matchup reliant. Note that this will cause Porygon2 to have more problems with slower Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Wobbuffet.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Knowing when to switch in Porygon2 is paramount, because while Porygon2 is bulky, its low Speed means that powerful, boosted offensive threats such as Dragon Dance Mega Salamence and Power-Up Punch Mega Kangaskhan can shatter Porygon2 before it can attack. Pokemon that don't boost, such as Greninja, Choice Scarf Garchomp, Skarmory, physically defensive Hippowdon, and Weakness Policy Aegislash, are good opportunities for Porygon2 to switch in. Also note that all of these Pokemon except Aegislash will give Porygon2 a valuable Download boost. Switching Porygon2 in after losing a Pokemon or through U-turn or Volt Switch is also a good idea, as this preserves Porygon2's ability to take powerful hits.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Offensive Porygon2's main issue is its Fighting-type weakness. Although switching in can be dangerous for them, Blaziken, Mega Lucario, and Heracross can blast though Porygon2. Porygon2's other big issue is against specially bulky Pokemon, with opposing Porygon2, Suicune, Sylveon, Toxic Cresselia, and Ferrothorn (if Porygon2 lacks Hidden Power Fire) tanking offensive Porygon2's assaults. These problems make Mega Gengar a fantastic teammate, thanks to its useful Fighting-type immunity (although Blaziken is still an issue) and its ability to use moves such as Taunt, Destiny Bond, and Perish Song to toy with defensive Pokemon. Thanks to their STAB types, Talonflame and Azumarill do well if you specifically need a Pokemon to deal with Fighting-types, while Mega Mawile and Mega Charizard Y can take on most of Porygon2's defensive problems fairly well.</p> <p>Because Porygon2 is fairly slow for an offensive Pokémon, paralysis support makes it far more difficult to counter. In particular, paralysis support means that frail Fighting-types such as Blaziken and Mega Lucario are no longer guaranteed to revenge kill Porygon2. Thunder Wave has a huge amount of viable users to choose from, but bulky ones such as Zapdos, Ferrothorn, and Rotom-W work especially well. More offensive users of paralysis such as Thundurus and Serperior can also pair well with Porygon2, as Porygon2 can often switch into their offensive checks such as Greninja.</p> <p>Pairing Porygon2 with a Volt Switch or U-turn user can be a good way to keep Porygon2 in healthy shape. Mega Manectric and Landorus-T are particularly good choices thanks to Intimidate letting Porygon2 soak up physical threats more easily, but Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Scizor are fine choices as well.</p>"

      {
        "name": "Trick Room",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Setting up Trick Room is Porygon2's primary objective, letting it change its low Speed into a lightning-fast asset for five turns! Shadow Ball 2HKOes Mega Gengar at minimum, which is extremely important because some Mega Gengar might attempt to stop Porygon2's setup with Taunt or waste Trick Room's time with Perish Song and Protect. Ice Beam offers good coverage, OHKOing the large amount of Pokemon doubly weak to Ice in the metagame and even doing over 90% to physically offensive Hippowdon after a Download boost.</p> <p>Tri Attack is the easiest choice for the last moveslot, giving Porygon2 a STAB attack that allows it to clean weakened teams in Trick Room with a Download boost. If you want Porygon2 to take on a more supportive role, Hidden Power Ground is a good choice, allowing a boosted Porygon2 to 2HKO Mega Mawile and have a 68% chance to OHKO Heatran, both of which can be problems under Trick Room. If your team can handle the loss in coverage, Recover can be used to give Porygon2 much more lasting power and is especially useful on teams that are only partially Trick Room-based.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Quiet nature, full investment in Special Attack, and 0 Speed IVs are needed to give Porygon2 reasonable power and a low Speed stat to take advantage of Trick Room. Eviolite and 244 HP EVs maximize Porygon2's bulk while letting it take less residual damage, while the 12 Defense EVs are simply filler to make Porygon2 slightly bulkier. Download is the best option ability-wise, giving Porygon2 the potential for extra offensive presence.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Conserving Porygon2's HP is an important task; switching recklessly into powerful offensive threats such as Mega Kangaskhan can get Porygon2 KOed before it launches off Trick Room. Switching into less powerful, non-boosting threats such as Greninja and Aegislash and defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia and Hippowdon is ideal. That being said, don't be afraid to sacrifice Porygon2 if you feel that setting up Trick Room and attacking once will open up an opportunity for a teammate to sweep! This tactic works especially well late in the game, when you know what foes your opponent has chosen.</p> <p>Pay close attention to your opponent's team in Team Preview, as this can dramatically affect how you play your Porygon2. For example, if your opponent's team is packed with Pokemon that give Trick Room trouble, you can still consider using Porygon2 for its bulk and potential to sweep weakened teams under Trick Room and not run its Trick Room teammates. If you are facing an opposing Trick Room team, you can opt to bench Porygon2, as running other Trick Room teammates could turn the momentum of the match in your favor.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Mawile should almost always be a teammate for this Porygon2. Mega Mawile's low Speed and absurd Attack make it extremely fearsome under Trick Room! Mega Mawile is also a great wallbreaker, using many of Porygon2's defensive checks as setup fodder. Powerful, slow Pokemon in general enjoy Trick Room support, with some good ones including Escavalier, which is immune to Spore thanks to Overcoat; Rhyperior, which is a good check to Talonflame, a problem for Trick Room teams; and Azumarill, which offers backup priority in Aqua Jet.</p> <p>Don't feel pressured into making your team fully centered around Trick Room support. Bringing fast Pokemon that don't need Trick Room to function well is usually a good idea, in case you face teams that do well against Trick Room, such as stall. Talonflame is the gold standard among these Pokemon, offering priority Brave Bird that works well regardless of the field condition and moves such as Taunt to give defensive Pokemon trouble. Mega Gengar, while not appreciative of Trick Room, gives stall teams trouble thanks to Shadow Tag.</p>"

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite numerous weaknesses to many top-tier threats, Tyranitar still stands out as one of the most versatile bulky offense Pokemon in the metagame. Being one of the only two sand setters in the format, Tyranitar faces a lot of competition from Hippowdon, which has superior bulk and typing that allow it to wall any physical attacker with ease. However, due to its Rock typing, Tyranitar gets a 50% Special Defense boost under sand, which can be helpful when playing supportive roles. Taking on a more offensive approach when using Tyranitar is where it really shines, though. Depending on its item, Tyranitar can play a variety of roles, including that of a sweeper, bulky Pursuit trapper, or just support. Its Mega Evolution not only increases its overall bulk but also boosts its Speed, which puts it in an important Speed tier after one boost. Thanks to sand also breaking potential Focus Sashes, Mega Tyranitar differentiates itself from other Dragon Dance sweepers such as Mega Salamence, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Gyarados. With its huge movepool and excellent stat distribution, Tyranitar can run both physical and special sets or even go mixed, with moves such as Fire Blast and Ice Beam letting it easily check some of the threats that would otherwise be troublesome such as Ferrothorn and Landorus-T. Tyranitar is a staple on stall teams due to its ability to get rid of Mega Gengar, a huge threat for stall teams because of Shadow Tag. It is also a must on sand teams, being one of the only two setters that can help Excadrill activate Sand Rush just by switching in. While Tyranitar's typing theoretically lets it handle Fire-, Flying-, and Ghost-types, some of these usually carry Fighting-type moves as coverage, and they can outspeed and OHKO Tyranitar. Tyranitar is also at the mercy of some of the most prominent Fighting-types seen in Battle Spot, such as Blaziken and Breloom. Tyranitar's Speed is also a letdown, as even when it has a Choice Scarf equipped, it fails to hit an important tier, further limiting its effectiveness against the threats that it's supposed to match up well against, such as Mega Gengar, Weavile, and Alakazam.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute can be used with a Mega Dragon Dance set to avoid nasty status, which the set is very vulnerable to. However, you will be forced to give up on a coverage move or a secondary STAB move. Similarly, Taunt is viable alternative to Substitute that lets Tyranitar set up on defensive threats more easily. This lets Mega Tyranitar prevent phazing moves such as Whirlwind, but it will still be vulnerable to moves like Discharge and Scald. With that said, Taunt is also good on other offensive sets, as it lets Tyranitar stop threats like Suicune from setting up on it. Toxic can be used to wear down defensive threats such as Porygon2 and Rotom-W on the switch if Tyranitar is already statused or doesn't have enough investment to break through these. Custap Berry has a nice surprise factor when Tyranitar survives a hit with low HP. Eject Button works effectively in sand combos with Excadrill, allowing Tyranitar to switch out immediately after setting sand; however, this is extremely situational.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type Coverage: Due to Tyranitar's 4x weakness to Fighting, Fighting-types are the biggest threat to it. Blaziken can outspeed any variant of Tyranitar thanks to Speed Boost and OHKO it. Breloom has priority Mach Punch. Mega Heracross and Conkeldurr have the bulk to take any attack and OHKO in return. Mega Lopunny and Mega Lucario also pose problems for Tyranitar due to their impressive Speed and power. Foes that commonly carry Focus Blast will OHKO Tyranitar, even though Tyranitar can check some of these without it. Mega Gengar, Thundurus, and Mega Charizard Y are some common examples that carry Focus Blast. Greninja and Weavile are notable users of Low Kick, which can easily OHKO Tyranitar, and they can even outspeed Choice Scarf variants.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Mega Mawile can weaken Tyranitar with Intimidate prior to Mega Evolution and OHKO it in return with its STAB move of choice. Similarly, both Azumarill and Mega Altaria can take any attack and OHKO in return. Defensive Clefable has an easy time walling Tyranitar and can potentially use it as setup bait or just neuter it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Tyranitar has difficulties breaking past some Steel-types like Skarmory and Aegislash. Skarmory has very high Defense and has access to Roost. Aegislash can play games with Tyranitar through King's Shield and potentially cut Tyranitar's Attack in half if it can predict Tyranitar's Crunch correctly, and it can OHKO it in return with Sacred Sword. Tyranitar lacking Fire Blast will be walled by bulky Scizor, although Bullet Punch and Superpower threaten Tyranitar anyway. Ferrothorn cannot take Superpower or Fire Blast well but can deal heavy damage with its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Both offensive and defensive Ground-types have ways to check Tyranitar. Offensive Ground-types such as Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Landorus-T can outspeed Tyranitar and OHKO it with Earthquake, although they do not take Tyranitar's moves well either, whether it's Ice-type coverage or Superpower. Defensive Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon can take any attacks and recover off any damage taken.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Physically defensive Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune can take Tyranitar's attacks well while being able to burn it with Will-O-Wisp or Scald. Mega Slowbro has the bulk to take STAB Crunch and retaliate with Scald and then set up Iron Defense on Tyranitar after it gets burned.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Threats: Tyranitar has few means to break through physically bulky foes, and in return they can inflict Tyranitar with status such as burn or paralysis and recover off any damage taken. Defensive threats include Porygon2, Mega Venusaur, Mega Sableye, and Chansey. Bulky Rocky Helmet Cresselia is annoying, though Moonlight's recovery is cut in sand and Mega Tyranitar with a boost running Crunch can simply overwhelm Cresselia if Tyranitar is not fully paralyzed.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Mega Tyranitar's Attack and Speed, which, coupled with its more-than-impressive bulk, turns it into a terrifying sweeper that can easily demolish teams. Stone Edge is the primary STAB move and will OHKO almost everything that is weak to it; it also has a nice critical hit chance, so it'll continue to be somewhat useful even if Tyranitar is burned. Rock Slide can be used instead, as the higher accuracy can prevent Mega Tyranitar from missing at crucial times, and the 30% chance to flinch is especially nice at +1 Speed. Rock Slide is better used with Crunch, since you won't be relying on the weaker option as Mega Tyranitar's only STAB move. Ice Punch gives Mega Tyranitar crucial coverage against Garchomp and Landorus-T, making Mega Tyranitar harder to revenge kill with their STAB Earthquake if it already has a boost under its belt. The last move depends on what Tyranitar wishes to hit, as there is no ideal move that will cover all other relevant threats in the metagame. Crunch is a secondary STAB option that is much more reliable than Stone Edge, boasting perfect accuracy and allowing Tyranitar to hit bulky Psychic-types that will otherwise wall it, namely Cresselia and Slowbro. Earthquake hits Steel-types such as Mega Mawile, Heatran, and Aegislash and it is particularly useful against the latter because Earthquake doesn't incur King's Shield's Attack drop, unlike Crunch. Superpower has a chance to OHKO Mega Kangaskhan and opposing Tyranitar prior to boosting while also giving Mega Tyranitar a reliable move to hit Mamoswine, Ferrothorn, and Hydreigon with. It also lets Mega Tyranitar breaks through defensive Normal-types if your team struggles to deal with them, like Porygon2 and Chansey.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature is a must for Mega Tyranitar to hit an important tier at +1 Speed, outspeeding Mega Gengar. If reaching this benchmark isn't important for Mega Tyranitar, you may opt for an Adamant nature for more power, although it is generally not recommended. Attack should also be maxed to take full advantage of Dragon Dance, making Mega Tyranitar a very potent sweeper after just one boost. Tyranitarite is necessary for Tyranitar to Mega Evolve, providing it with a much-needed boost to its defenses and crucially increasing its Speed. Sand Stream should always be Tyranitar's first choice of ability, as it only increases its Special Defense by 50% upon the switch in and also breaks Focus Sash via residual damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Tyranitar requires a substantial amount of support and therefore should be kept until later stages and used as a late-game sweeper. Tyranitar can set up on Pokemon that can't do much to it such as Zapdos, Latios, and Raikou and Mega Evolve as soon as possible to make use of its increased bulk and much-needed new Speed tier. When trying to set up, it's not recommended to do so against Ground-types such as Garchomp despite having the bulk to survive an Earthquake, since Rough Skin damage can be fatal after all because Ice Punch is a contact move. Watch out for weaker super effective attacks such as Scald; most of the time, it's not worth the risk to stay in and try to use Dragon Dance and potentially get burned. The unreliability of Stone Edge can sometimes be the difference between a win and a loss; with that in mind, don't use it unless you have to. If you're running Crunch, bulky Steel-types such as Mega Mawile should be removed before bringing out Mega Tyranitar. Likewise, if Earthquake or Superpower is used, you should have teammates that can deal with bulky Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Slowbro. As both Garchomp and Landorus-T are popular Choice Scarf users, using Ice Punch to catch these on the switch before setting up may be an effective play.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Like with most Tyranitar sets, Talonflame is a fantastic partner, being able to take out almost every Fighting-type easily with its priority Brave Bird. In return, Mega Tyranitar can get rid of annoying Electric-types that it struggles with such as Thundurus, Raikou, and Zapdos. Since Will-O-Wisp gives Mega Tyranitar an easier time to set up against physical attackers, Gengar and Rotom-W make decent teammates. The former can switch into predicted Fighting-type moves with ease, while the latter is able to freely switch into any Ground-types and burn them or just hit them with Hydro Pump. Mega Venusaur is a fantastic Mega Evolution to bring in matchups that may prove troublesome for Mega Tyranitar due to their fantastic synergy in general. Mega Tyranitar powers through offensive teams once it's set up, while Mega Venusaur has the means to take down bulkier teams with its Leech Seed and STAB moves that deal with Fairy-, Ground-, Water-types with ease. Dual screens users give Mega Tyranitar more opportunities to set up thanks to reduced damage; both Latios and Klefki are great options. Latios also has access to Memento to make Tyranitar even harder to take down if the foe decides to stay in, while Klefki can paralyze foes with its Prankster Thunder Wave. Suicune can set up on the defensive threats that Mega Tyranitar might have trouble breaking down such as Porygon2 and Mega Sableye (though Snarl will be somewhat annoying); in return, Mega Tyranitar gets rid of Electric-types for Suicune. Rotom-H is an effective Mega Mawile check and can help spread burns to increase Mega Tyranitar's chances at setting up, but do take note of the shared weakness to Water.</p>"
      },
      {
        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Pursuit allows Tyranitar to trap Mega Gengar and Latios, outright OHKOing both if they switch out, while also dealing heavy damage to threats that will most likely switch out anyway such as Talonflame and Volcarona. Stealth Rock may be used if you lack a setter, and offensive teams will always appreciate it being up. Rock Tomb is Tyranitar's primary STAB move; it will OHKO all foes that are 4x weak to it as well as offensive Thundurus most of the time. It also has a nice secondary effect of slowing down switch-ins, which can be important considering Tyranitar's low Speed. Stone Edge trades accuracy for more power, allowing Tyranitar to OHKO Mega Charizard X and defensive Rotom-H if these are important targets for your team. Ice Punch provides mandatory coverage against Ground-types, can OHKO Garchomp, has a chance to OHKO Mega Salamence, and deals heavy damage to other Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor. Superpower is the best coverage move on this set, being able to OHKO opposing Tyranitar while hitting both Mega Kangaskhan and Ferrothorn hard, both of which can otherwise take this set on easily. Crunch allows Tyranitar to cleanly 2HKO non-Mega Slowbro and is a more reliable STAB move than Stone Edge thanks to its perfect accuracy. Crunch will also OHKO Mega Gengar without risking Pursuit if it stays in. Lastly, Earthquake is an option mainly to hit Steel-types such as Mega Mawile and Heatran. It also reliably hits Aegislash without risking the sharp Attack drop of King's Shield.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in both Attack and Speed allows Tyranitar to hit as hard as possible without losing any power, OHKOing the likes of Garchomp and Mega Salamence with Ice Punch after sandstorm damage. An alternative spread of 60 HP / 60 Atk / 132 Def / 4 SpD / 252 Spe can be used, helping Tyranitar survive an Earthquake from Garchomp and Mamoswine while still being able to outspeed Garchomp and Mega Kangaskhan after a Rock Tomb and finishing them off Ice Punch or Superpower. Lum Berry is the ideal item for Tyranitar, as it is a status magnet, allowing it to avoid potential burns, paralysis, and sleep and potentially giving it a free Attack boost from Swagger if the foe decides to stay in. Lum Berry is also particularly useful against Mega Gengar, because it is known to be a common user of Will-O-Wisp and Hypnosis. Smooth Rock greatly helps Excadrill by extending the duration of sand, as it is less likely to get stalled out with eight turns. Assault Vest helps Tyranitar survive Focus Blast without the need to run a Careful nature, turning Tyranitar into a special tank in tandem with the boost from sand. Chople Berry lets Tyranitar take Mach Punch from Breloom, potentially knocking it out with a combination Ice Punch and sand damage. Lastly, if your team can afford to give up a Mega slot, Mega Tyranitar makes a fine trapper due to increased bulk and power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tyranitar makes a decent lead to set up Stealth Rock or take out a common lead right off the bat, which Rock Tomb helps with greatly. Tyranitar has a good matchup against Garchomp, Thundurus, and Mega Kangaskhan when running Superpower. When not using Tyranitar as a lead, you can switch it in on a weakened Thundurus or Aegislash and eliminate them without having to worry about Thunder Wave or King's Shield. Rock Tomb is a great move to use when you need good damage against something that isn't weak to Pursuit without needing to guess whether or not they switch. By slowing down a switch-in, you can prevent threats such as Gyarados from setting up Dragon Dance safely and either force them to knock out Tyranitar or leave them easier revenge killed by a teammate. Tyranitar is also a very reliable switch-in to Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona for resetting weather and threatening to OHKO them in return. This Tyranitar set is great to have on dedicated stall teams for its ability to effectively deal with Mega Gengar, as stall teams will have sweepers and walls that easily get trapped and eliminated by it. Paralysis support, speed control via Tailwind, or Baton Pass can help Tyranitar Pursuit trap more efficiently without having to risk taking damage if the foe stays in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Being the best sand sweeper in the game, Excadrill is a great partner for any Tyranitar. With its Speed doubling in sand, it can even outspeed common Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp and Latios. Mega Salamence rounds off the core nicely, being able to switch into predicted Earthquakes with ease while also dealing with Fighting- and Grass-types such as Blaziken and Mega Venusaur. Alternatively, Mega Altaria is also nice to round out the sand core. Lastly, Talonflame can close out the game with Brave Bird much more easily when Electric-types and Steel-types are weakened or gone. Garchomp is a decent partner here, as Tyranitar gets rid of opposing Garchomp with Ice Punch and deals with Zapdos and Thundurus so that Garchomp can clean up. Serperior can provide paralysis support for Tyranitar, which is always appreciated on a slow Pokemon, while Tyranitar gets rid of Talonflame, a huge problem for Serperior. In addition, Serperior can threaten Ground-types such as Hippowdon and remove bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Rotom-W with ease. Due to their immunity to Ground-types and the ability to spread burns, Rotom-H and Rotom-W make decent teammates. As the opponent is less likely to expect Thunder Wave from these two, they make effective paralysis inducers, compensating for Tyranitar's low Speed. Naturally, Pokemon that enjoy the absence of Mega Gengar are greatly appreciated on the team. Mega Slowbro is one of the best examples, as Tyranitar helps it remove powerful special attackers such as Mega Gengar and Mega Charizard Y, as well as Electric-types, and Mega Slowbro can help Tyranitar deal with Fighting-types while setting up Calm Mind. Finally, Greninja makes a decent addition, being able to eliminate Ground- and Dragon-types more reliably than Tyranitar while offering great coverage and Speed to the team overall.</p>"

        "name": "Defensive Trapper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Pursuit is a necessary move for Tyranitar to function as a trapper, easily OHKOing Mega Gengar but also getting damage on the targets that are likely to switch out such as Talonflame and Volcarona. Rock Slide is the primary STAB move that is fairly accurate compared to Stone Edge and used to check Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Volcarona. Rock Tomb is an alternative that has better accuracy and can slow down switch-ins; while you should note that it fails to OHKO Thundurus, it is generally the better option when you're not running Thunder Wave. Foul Play prevents Tyranitar from being setup bait to certain physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Salamence, is boosted by STAB, and has the benefit of not being affected by King's Shield. Thunder Wave further prevents Tyranitar from being setup bait, crippling nearly anything that is faster than Tyranitar. A combination of Thunder Wave and Rock Slide can be deadly if flinches stack. Crunch can also be used if you want a safer Dark-type STAB move for those Mega Gengar that decide to stay in as well as a reliable move to hit bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro. If your team wants Stealth Rock support as well as a trapper in one slot, Stealth Rock can be used in the last slot.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment with 204 EVs in Special Defense and a Careful nature allows Tyranitar to survive any Focus Blast with ease, including Life Orb Thundurus's. Other common users of this move include Mega Gengar and Mega Charizard Y. 44 EVs are then allocated to Attack to give Tyranitar a chance to OHKO even some bulkier variants of Mega Gengar. The remaining EVs are allocated to Defense and Speed so that no points are wasted due to the EV mechanics at level 50. Lum Berry lets Tyranitar avoid status one time, which can be crucial against the threats it's meant to trap, since they are very likely to target Tyranitar with a status move such as Will-O-Wisp, Hypnosis, or Thunder Wave. Mega Tyranitar is also an option if you want greater bulk and damage output, although you won't be able to bring a different Mega Evolution, making this somewhat less appealing. Sand Stream gives Tyranitar the ability to set sand on the switch, effectively breaking all Focus Sashes on foes not immune to sand and making Excadrill a huge threat to offensive teams.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because this Tyranitar can reliably remove Mega Gengar, it should be used on stall teams that are particularly vulnerable to having their Pokemon trapped and eliminated by it. Therefore, you would often be benching Tyranitar if there are few to no foes that may pose a threat to your defensive team or if you do not require a particular threat removed such as Thundurus, Talonflame, or Charizard. You may use Tyranitar as a lead to try and trap Mega Gengar from the get-go or just neuter something with Thunder Wave and work from there. Against unfavorable lead matchups such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Ferrothorn, due to lack of coverage and less Attack investment, you may directly switch out to a bulkier teammate so that you can save Tyranitar for trapping later on. As with most Tyranitar sets, prior paralysis support is greatly appreciated, as this allows it to run other moves such as Crunch and Stealth Rock and also lets it trap foes more safely in case they stay in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Slowbro appreciates Mega Gengar and Thundurus gone and in return takes on most Fighting-types with ease. Chansey is often found on stall teams and is great to have, despite the duo's shared weakness to Fighting, since Tyranitar is able to remove or cripple the Ghost-types that threaten it, such as Mega Gengar and Aegislash. Gliscor makes a decent teammate and functions a decent status absorber for Tyranitar once Lum Berry is gone. Tyranitar can also help Gliscor get rid of pesky Taunt users including Talonflame, Thundurus, and Mega Gengar. Any Talonflame is good with Tyranitar; offensive ones appreciate Thunder Wave or Stealth Rock support to can clean up more easily, while specially defensive variants do well against defensive threats thanks to Taunt and Will-O-Wisp. With fantastic synergy and great overall bulk, Mega Venusaur makes a great teammate, being able to deal with Water-types while Tyranitar can come into Flying- and Psychic-types with ease. Skarmory appreciates Tyranitar's ability to deal with Electric- and Fire-types such as Raikou and Volcarona. Excadrill is Tyranitar's sand partner in crime, as it benefits greatly from Tyranitar's sand to take advantage of Sand Rush as soon as it comes in to threaten offensive teams.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock provides the team with additional chip damage alongside sand and prevents Fire- and Flying-types from coming in safely. Ice Beam has a chance to OHKO everything that is 4x weak to it, including common Dragon- and Ground-types such as Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Landorus-T. Roar has good synergy with Stealth Rock, allowing Tyranitar to shuffle the opposing team while racking up chip damage while also preventing Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan from trying to set up on Tyranitar. Thunder Wave is a viable alternative that neuters faster threats such as Mega Gengar and just provides paralysis support in general, allowing your team to have an easier time. Stone Edge will still OHKO everything that is 4x weak to it, even with a hindering nature, if checking Talonflame and Volcarona is particularly important for the team. Rock Tomb is a viable alternative if the Speed drop and better accuracy are more appealing, although Tyranitar misses out on the OHKO on Thundurus due to the Attack-lowering nature. A STAB-boosted Foul Play can be useful against physical sweepers such as Mega Kangaskhan and has a chance to OHKO at +2, and it isn't affected by Intimidate. Fire Blast prevents Tyranitar from getting walled by Steel-types and will almost always OHKO Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, and it is Tyranitar's best option to hit Skarmory with. Superpower can be used in the last slot if OHKOing opposing Tyranitar is important for the team, but it is usually outclassed by the other moves due to the negative effect and hindering nature.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Bold nature with maximum HP investment allows Tyranitar to be as physically defensive as possible, letting it survive Earthquakes from offensive Ground-types so it can retaliate with Ice Beam. 76 EVs are used in Defense to get an extra point, potentially helping Tyranitar survive an Earthquake from Life Orb Mamoswine, while the remaining EVs are allocated to Special Attack to increase the chance of an OHKO with Ice Beam on all those 4x weak to it. 204 EVs in Special Attack can be used if you want to guarantee the OHKO on Garchomp. Smooth Rock is the best item on a support Tyranitar, giving a Sand Rush sweeper such as Excadrill longer time in sand, which can be useful if the opponent tries to stall sand turns via switches or Protect. Focus Sash is a viable alternative, allowing Tyranitar to survive any single hit, which guarantees Tyranitar to at least get Stealth Rock up or potentially neuter a threat with Thunder Wave.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>At Team Preview, if the team appears to be defensive or on the bulkier side, it might be wise to bench Tyranitar, as Stealth Rock and even sand offense might prove ineffective against such a lineup. As a support Pokemon, Tyranitar is typically used as a lead to set up sand immediately. A combination of Ice Beam and Fire Blast hits common leads such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Ferrothorn. If you're using Focus Sash, this will at least guarantee Stealth Rock to be up, and you can proceed to Roar out or paralyze the foe if it decides to stay in and set up. Thunder Wave works great with a Focus Sash, as Tyranitar can paralyze Blaziken and prevent it from potentially outspeeding Excadrill in sand. As this set is less bothered by status or Intimidate, don't be too afraid to take a paralysis or burn if trading status or denting a threat with Ice Beam or Fire Blast is beneficial. However, be mindful that this set gets worn down rather easily.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Excadrill is the best teammate to pair up with support Tyranitar, as Tyranitar can potentially give it eight turns of sand to make full use of Sand Rush. Thanks to Excadrill's excellent typing, the opponent will have to think twice before trying to Thunder Wave or Toxic Tyranitar. In return, Tyranitar's Ice Beam helps Excadrill with a lot of threats such as Garchomp and Landorus-T. Mega Salamence rounds out the sand core nicely, preventing foes such as Landorus-T, Conkeldurr, and Blaziken from overpowering the duo with their STAB moves. In a similar fashion, Mega Altaria works in place of Mega Salamence as an alternative to deal with the Fighting-types and Dragon-types that have their way with the sand core. As this set lacks the means to deal with bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Rotom-W, and Mega Slowbro, Thundurus is a fantastic teammate here. Thundurus can paralyze foes with Prankster Thunder Wave. In addition, Rotom-W makes a fantastic Ground-type switch-in and can also burn them while dealing with bulky Water-types as well. Breloom appreciates Talonflame gone and also is able to take on Water-types relatively well. Talonflame is great as always, whether it's spreading burns or eliminating Fighting-types with Brave Bird, while Tyranitar helps Talonflame deal with Electric-types such as Thundurus and Raikou. Mega Charizard Y works nicely with Tyranitar, even more so now that Tyranitar can provide Thunder Wave support. This set can also lure in Ground-types such as Garchomp and Landorus-T and KO them with Ice Beam, which Mega Charizard might struggle with especially if they are running Choice Scarf.</p>"

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stone Edge is Tyranitar's main STAB move, OHKOing many relevant threats including those that are 2x weak to it such as Thundurus and specially defensive Zapdos. Rock Slide is a more accurate option with a nice secondary effect of flinching, which is great in tandem with a Choice Scarf. However, Tyranitar misses the OHKO on Mega Charizard X and defensive Rotom-H. Pursuit KOes weakened threats switching out and can also catch Gengar before Mega Evolution, but Mega Gengar can outspeed Tyranitar the following turn. Ice Punch lets Tyranitar OHKO Garchomp most of the time while also dealing massive damage to any other Dragon- and Ground-types such Landorus-T and Mega Salamence. Ice Beam can be used as over Ice Punch if dealing with the Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Mega Salamence is more important than Garchomp for your team. This, however, forces Tyranitar to run a Naive nature if you want it to OHKO them. Crunch is a reliable STAB move that can be used to OHKO Mega Gengar before it Mega Evolves and is a superior move to Stone Edge when cleaning up due to perfect accuracy. Earthquake is an option to OHKO Heatran and to hit Aegislash without playing King's Shield mindgames and is Tyranitar's best option to hit Mega Mawile hard. It can also potentially catch Blaziken off guard and OHKO if Blaziken doesn't Protect first turn. Nevertheless, Earthquake is a bad move to lock Tyranitar. Superpower can be used to OHKO opposing Tyranitar as well as hit Mega Kangaskhan and Ferrothorn hard but leaves Tyranitar walled by Aegislash and bulky Psychic-types.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Running a Jolly nature with maximum Speed investment makes full use of Tyranitar's revenge killing potential. Attack is also maximized, as Tyranitar is forced to lock itself into one move, so it wants to hit as hard as possible. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Tyranitar can outspeed every threat up to the maximum Speed base 116 tier, which includes Whimsicott. It also outspeeds key threats such as Raikou, Mega Kangaskhan—which is notable because Tyranitar resists Sucker Punch—Serperior, and Garchomp. Although it now outspeeds Thundurus, Prankster Thunder Wave will still be an annoyance and will cripple Tyranitar. Sand Stream should always be used over Unnerve, giving Tyranitar a boost in Special Defense and allowing it to break potential Focus Sashes. When running Ice Beam over Ice Punch, a Naive nature should be used over Jolly. If you want to guarantee the OHKO on Landorus-T, 52 EVs in Special Attack are required. However, do note that running Naive lowers Tyranitar's Special Defense.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As Tyranitar is forced to lock itself into one move and has no means to recover from status, bench it if teams appears to be too bulky or defensive at Team Preview. Because Choice Scarf is relatively uncommon on Tyranitar, you can surprise threats that stay in such as Garchomp, Thundurus, and Mega Lucario. Despite being equipped with a Choice Scarf, Tyranitar will still fail to outspeed Mega Gengar, making it more useful against Gengar before it Mega Evolves. Pursuit can be risky, as using the move leaves Tyranitar very vulnerable to a new threat that is able to set up on a Choice-locked Pursuit. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can be used as a lead to surprise other leads with its increase in Speed or be kept until late-game when the opposing team has been weakened enough to the point where it can clean. With that said, Tyranitar can easily switch into Mega Charizard Y and reset the sun without worrying to take a Focus Blast afterwards thanks to Choice Scarf.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As Tyranitar will be force to lock itself into one move due to Choice Scarf, teammates that can deal with foes that try to set up on it afterwards are great. Talonflame can deal with Fighting-types and revenge kill weakened or frail threats with ease due to priority Brave Bird. Greninja is a fantastic partner, being able to handle all Ground-types with ease thanks to its coverage and can take out Garchomp if it tries to set up Swords Dance on a Choice-locked Stone Edge. Clefable is a decent teammate for Tyranitar, as Tyranitar is not only able to Pursuit trap or outright OHKO Mega Gengar with Crunch prior to its Mega Evolution but also able to remove bulky Talonflame with a STAB Rock-type move. In return, Clefable ignores all the boosts of the setup sweepers that take advantage of Tyranitar, including Suicune and Azumarill. As far as Mega Evolutions go, Salamence, Slowbro, and Venusaur are all fine choices. Mega Salamence and Slowbro both enjoy Thundurus eliminated. Mega Venusaur benefits from the removal of Talonflame. As this Tyranitar struggles with defensive threats and cannot play around them once it gets paralyzed or burned, Calm Mind Raikou is capable of setting up on and overpowering foes like Cresselia, Porygon2, and Suicune. Mega Gengar can trap defensive threats such as Cresselia and annoy Porygon2 and Suicune with the Taunt + Destiny Bond combination. As a Sand Rush sweeper, Excadrill works great with any Tyranitar. With the combination of an Ice-type move and Choice Scarf, Tyranitar can weaken or eliminate Ground-types for Excadrill, making the sweep much easier to pull off.</p>"
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>There aren't many safe switch-ins in Battle Spot to Choice Band-boosted Stone Edge; Mega Salamence will take around 88% or more after Intimidate, and it can even 2HKO defensive Mega Venusaur and has a chance to 2HKO Skarmory! If you wish to trade power for a more accurate move, Rock Slide is a great alternative. With the boost from a Choice Band, it now secures the OHKO even on Mega Charizard X and defensive Rotom-H, and the chance to flinch is always appreciated. Crunch is a reliable secondary STAB move that will now even 2HKO the likes of Cresselia and Mega Slowbro and offensive Mega Venusaur. It's a good move to break walls with because it has perfect accuracy, unlike Rock Slide or Stone Edge. Thanks to the significant increase in damage output with a Choice Band, Pursuit will be doing decent damage if your opponent decides to stay in. However, if trapping is not the main role played by Choice Band Tyranitar, you can opt for Ice Punch in the third slot for coverage on Ground- and Dragon-types; it will OHKO Landorus-T even after Intimidate drop and even OHKO Gliscor. Earthquake offers Tyranitar nice coverage against Steel-types; it can OHKO Mega Mawile and even has a chance to OHKO Aegislash after Stealth Rock. Finally, Superpower can be used to hit opposing Tyranitar, OHKO Mega Kangaskhan, and even potentially OHKO Ferrothorn with some prior damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Full investment in Attack along with an Adamant nature is used to maximize Tyranitar's wallbreaking potential and make full use of the Choice Band. With 204 Speed EVs, Tyranitar can outspeed defensive threats with minimum investment, including Cresselia, Mega Venusaur, and Skarmory. 76 Speed EVs can be used if only outspeeding Skarmory is desired, and the rest go to HP. Alternatively, maximum HP investment allows Tyranitar to take an Earthquake from certain threats such as Landorus-T so that it may retaliate and OHKO with Ice Punch. With that said, you sacrifice a large amount of bulk in the process when running Speed, and Tyranitar can no longer survive an Earthquake. If investing in Speed is not appealing, you can run a Brave nature, allowing Tyranitar to function effectively as a powerful Trick Room attacker. Choice Band is the key item here, providing Tyranitar with immediate wallbreaking potential, letting it break through even defensive teams given the right support. Sand Stream should be the ability to use regardless of the situation, as it not only provides sand support for teammates like Excadrill and breaks Focus Sashes but also cuts recovery moves of certain defensive threats such as Cresselia and Mega Venusaur.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Unlike most Tyranitar sets, with a Choice Band equipped, it can now break past even defensive teams with the right support, so you can pick Tyranitar at Team Preview more often than usual. With that said, Choice Band Tyranitar requires a substantial amount of support before it can be utilized to its full potential; therefore, leading with it may be a bad idea due to its low Speed and extreme vulnerability to status. Only use Trick Room support against fast offensive teams, not slow bulky teams, to prevent things such as Slowbro and Ferrothorn from outspeeding Tyranitar. Choice Band-boosted Crunch is insanely powerful, and Tyranitar can easily OHKO Talonflame and Volcarona without the risk of missing Stone Edge or Rock Slide. Once the opposing team has been weakened enough, you can use Crunch to finish the game or use Rock Slide if you managed to get prior paralysis in, since the flinch chance can be crucial against certain threats such as Suicune.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Support is key for this Tyranitar, and as such Pokemon that can spread status are much appreciated, Thunder Wave in particular, as Tyranitar is slow. Grass-types such as Serperior and Breloom can threaten Suicune, Serperior's Glare can even paralyze Ground-types such as Garchomp, and both of them enjoy Talonflame gone. When looking for Trick Room setters, both Cresselia and Slowbro are fine choices. The former can come in on Earthquake and even use Lunar Dance give Tyranitar another chance at wallbreaking if it has been statused or weakened. Both are fine Thunder Wave users also. When the opportunity presents itself, Blaziken makes a fine Baton Pass user to Tyranitar and can even make it more threatening through Swords Dance or Bulk Up, while Blaziken appreciates Tyranitar's ability to remove Talonflame. Mega Pokemon that pair well with Tyranitar include Mega Salamence and Mega Gyarados. Both of these have great synergy with Tyranitar, and their Intimidate can be used to soften physical attacks. Mega Salamence and Talonflame revenge kill most Fighting-types that eliminate Tyranitar, and Mega Gyarados can set up on the Ground-types. Both really appreciate Electric-types such as Raikou and Thundurus gone. With Tyranitar being able to wear down Cresselia more easily with the help from Choice Band, Excadrill once again makes a good partner for being able to sweep with bulky threats weakened or gone. However, the lack of Smooth Rock means it won't get as much time under sand.</p>"

  "Sceptile": {
    "overview": "<p>With its blazing Speed and relatively high Special Attack that allows it to take out the likes of Suicune, Mega Salamence, Garchomp, and Rotom-W, Mega Sceptile makes for an efficient revenge killer and late-game cleaner in the Battle Spot Singles metagame. Lightning Rod gives Mega Sceptile immunity to Electric-type moves and a Special Attack boost if it switches into one. Additionally, Mega Sceptile's resulting immunity to Thunder Wave is a huge boon for it by completely removing one of the primary methods to lower its Speed, its greatest asset. Mega Sceptile's secondary typing in Dragon is a huge benefit, as it grants it a secondary STAB type to utilize, removes its weakness to Fire, and gives it a 4x resistance to Water, improving its matchup against the likes of Heatran and Rotom-H. However, Mega Sceptile's typing also gives it a 4x weakness to Ice and new weaknesses to Dragon and Fairy. Mega Sceptile is also quite frail, and the prevalence of priority in Battle Spot Singles gives it a disadvantage against common Pokemon such as Talonflame, Kangaskhan, and Mamoswine. Although Grass / Dragon has decent coverage on its own, Mega Sceptile's STAB moves are walled by Steel-types such as Aegislash, Mega Mawile, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, making its role at cleaning teams a lot more difficult. Even with a high base Special Attack of 145, Mega Sceptile fails to beat the common walls and bulky Pokemon of Battle Spot such as Cresselia, Porygon2, and specially defensive Thundurus.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rock Slide can be used to OHKO Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona, both of which threaten Mega Sceptile otherwise, as well as OHKO Talonflame on the switch. The 30% flinch chance can be utilized to great effect as well with Mega Sceptile's impressive base 145 Speed. Earthquake can be used to hit Steel-types like Heatran, Aegislash, Mega Mawile, and Mega Lucario. Energy Ball or Giga Drain can be used for a more reliable Grass-type STAB move in the last moveslot, but these two moves generally do not see much use, as Mega Sceptile is meant to hit hard and fast. SubSeed Sceptile can be used to drain the opposing Pokemon’s HP to bring them into the KO range of one of its STAB moves. However, Mega Sceptile lacks the bulk to do this with great effectiveness. A physical moveset of Swords Dance / Leaf Blade / Earthquake with a filler move is a possibility, but Mega Sceptile lacks the bulk to set up and still lacks the wallbreaking power it wants after a boost.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Priority Moves: Mega Sceptile's frailty and weakness to priority moves such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Ice Shard from the likes of Mamoswine, Cloyster, and Weavile means that these Pokemon prove to be effective checks to it. Mega Sceptile fears strong priority from the likes of Lucario, Scizor, and Dragonite as well.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash: Aegislash resists both of Mega Sceptile's STAB types and takes little damage from Earthquake while in Shield forme. It can then either 2HKO with Shadow Ball or OHKO with Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types have the benefit of resisting both of Mega Sceptile's STAB types, and most can take advantage of its frailty. Such Pokemon include Heatran, Scizor, and Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon: Mega Heracross takes a hit from Mega Sceptile and OHKOes it with Pin Missile. Specially defensive Thundurus is capable of taking a few hits from Mega Sceptile and can 2HKO with Hidden Power Ice. Cresselia and Porygon2 both stomach hits from Mega Sceptile and can use Ice Beam to either 2HKO or OHKO, respectively. Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y can take a hit and KO Mega Sceptile or set up in Volcarona's case if Mega Sceptile lacks Rock Slide. Mega Venusaur is capable of taking a few hits from Mega Sceptile and OHKOes with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Garchomp, Mega Blaziken, Mega Gengar, and Greninja all outspeed Sceptile before it Mega Evolves and OHKO Mega Sceptile with relative ease. However, the use of Protect to safely get the Speed boost from Sceptile's Mega Evolution allows it to outspeed them and get the upper hand.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Mega Mawile resists both of Mega Sceptile's STAB types and OHKOes it Play Rough. Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir can take a Leaf Storm and OHKO with Hyper Voice. Mega Sceptile gets walled hard by Mega Altaria if lacking Hidden Power Ice, and Mega Altaria can easily OHKO or set up on it. Albeit a little uncommon, Sap Sipper Azumarill is capable of walling Mega Sceptile's STAB moves completely.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leaf Storm is Mega Sceptile's strongest STAB move and allows it to OHKO the likes of Suicune, Rotom-W, Azumarill, and Mamoswine. Dragon Pulse is Mega Sceptile’s secondary STAB attack, hitting many Pokemon that resist Grass for neutral or super effective damage such as Salamence, Gengar, Thundurus, and Hydreigon. Focus Blast allows Mega Sceptile to hit the Steel-types that its STAB moves fail to hit effectively, such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. It also OHKOes Mega Kangaskhan, which is quite noteworthy. Hidden Power Fire provides similar coverage, hitting Ferrothorn and Scizor very hard while also hitting Aegislash and Mega Mawile. Protect can be used for scouting and to get the Speed boost from Sceptile's Mega Evolution right away so it can outspeed threats to its base forme such as Greninja, Mega Gengar, and Mega Lopunny. When facing a Pokemon that cannot do much to Mega Sceptile, such as Rotom-W, Slowbro, or Suicune, Mega Sceptile can utilize Substitute when predicting a switch to give itself a shield against attacks and status moves.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sceptilite is mandatory for Sceptile, as it is really mediocre outside of its Mega forme and should not be used when going on the offensive. Overgrow is used over Unburden because Mega Sceptile cannot make use of Unburden at all while holding a Mega Stone. Maximum Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature allows Mega Sceptile to hit fast and hard. Maximum Speed on this moveset greatly improves Mega Sceptile's matchup against Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T, letting it outspeed it by a small margin. If coverage is preferred on the team, Mega Sceptile can forgo both of the moves in the last slot for a coverage move such as Earthquake or Rock Slide. If it does, Mega Sceptile should utilize a Naive nature so as to not hinder its Attack stat. If Hidden Power Fire is used, an EV spread of 248 SpA / 12 SpD / 248 Spe should be used for maximum efficiency along with 30 Speed IVs. Note that Mega Sceptile then will not be able to Speed tie with opposing Mega Sceptile and Mega Beedrill, although they are uncommon, so the Speed loss does not put it at a great disadvantage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Once brought on the field, Sceptile should immediately Mega Evolve to get its new Speed tier the following turn and hit harder with its increased stats. Mega Sceptile is used best during the late-game when everything is softened up and weakened, using its Speed to clean up the remaining Pokemon on the opponent's team. Mega Sceptile is a great revenge killer and should be used as such whenever given the chance. It does not appreciate switching even into some attacks it resists such as Ground, as it is quite frail, so one should be cautious before switching it in into a resisted move. However, Mega Sceptile does not mind switching into types it resists extremely well, such as Scald from a bulky Water-type like Suicune. Mega Sceptile does not mind the potential burn if not running a physical move and can likely retaliate with a quick Leaf Storm for the OHKO. However, note that Mega Sceptile fails to OHKO Suicune with Leaf Storm after a Calm Mind boost, so proper scouting for Calm Mind on Suicune is greatly recommended before switching into it. Mega Sceptile loves to switch into Electric-type moves from the likes of Rotom-W, Raikou, Mega Manectric, and Thundurus. However, one should scout for Hidden Power Ice variants of Rotom-W before switching in and be wary of possible Hidden Power Ice on the switch from the latter three Pokemon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Talonflame appreciates having bulky Water-types moved from the battlefield, which Sceptile is capable of doing; in return, it takes out major threats to Mega Sceptile such as Blaziken and Mega Heracross. Heatran and Rotom-H both have great type synergy with Sceptile and take care of Talonflame and Steel-types like Aegislash and Mawile. Mega Sceptile checks a majority of the Pokemon that Azumarill dislikes such as Mega Salamence and Rotom-W, while Azumarill can set up and have an easier time sweeping weakened teams. Substitute + Toxic Aegislash defeats the Fairies and walls that Mega Sceptile hates such as Sylveon, Mega Gardevoir, Cresselia, and Porygon2. In return, Mega Sceptile handles the Ground-types that Aegislash has a disadvantage against. Mamoswine and Landorus-T help with the issues Mega Sceptile has against Thundurus and Aegislash and are also able to provide Stealth Rock to hinder threatening Pokemon to Mega Sceptile such as Talonflame and Dragonite. Landorus-T is also able to provide momentum for Mega Sceptile with a combination of U-turn and Intimidate. In return, Mega Sceptile deals with the bulky Water-types that Mamoswine and Landorus-T struggle with. Gyarados or Suicune is a nice teammate to have to deal with Mamoswine, Talonflame, Blaziken, and Kangaskhan with Rocky Helmet, while Mega Sceptile resists Grass and is immune to Electric with Lightning Rod. Zapdos helps check Flying-types like Talonflame for Mega Sceptile and provides momentum for it with Volt Switch. Sceptile does Zapdos some favors as well by helping check Pokemon like Hippowdon and Mega Tyranitar, both of which Zapdos has a disadvantage against. Tyranitar helps deal with Gengar by Pursuit trapping it and dealing with Flying-types such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Zapdos, which all prove to be problems for Mega Sceptile. Tyranitar also appreciates having bulky Water-types removed from the match. Mega Sceptile often has unfavorable matchups in the Battle Spot Singles metagame, so running a second Mega Pokemon is a good idea. In particular, Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Mawile are good choice for when the team has an unfavorable matchup against Fairy-types. Meanwhile, Mega Sceptile can be brought into matches where it can dispose of the threats to Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Mawile, such as Hippowdon and Suicune.</p>"

  "Blaziken": {
    "overview": "<p>Blaziken is, without a doubt, one of the premier offensive threats in Battle Spot Singles, and for multiple good reasons—it is powerful, fast, and versatile. It gets STAB on two of the most formidable offensive types in the game, backed up by access to high Base Power attacks on top of strong offensive stats (increased even further in its Mega forme). To top it all off, it has access to one of the best abilities in the game, Speed Boost, which helps patch up its rather average base Speed, allowing it to truly exercise its immense raw power and also function as a revenge killer. The possibilities don't end there—Blaziken is devastating in both Mega and non-Mega formes, allowing for flexible teambuilding, and can even pull off a supporting role with Baton Pass.</p> <p>As strong as Blaziken is, however, it is quite frail and is weak to some common types, meaning that if Blaziken does not KO its target, it will often be subject to serious retaliation. Its STAB moves also have drawbacks that can be taken advantage of, making Blaziken somewhat prediction-reliant. They are also contact moves, meaning Rocky Helmet can be a nuisance. Despite Blaziken being blindingly fast with Speed Boost, its weaknesses to Water and Flying mean that it can be revenge killed by Aqua Jet and Gale Wings Brave Bird. Its reliance on Protect + Speed Boost to cover its rather average initial Speed can also be taken advantage of in the form of a free switch in. Nevertheless, Blaziken simply has too many advantages to be taken lightly. It has proven time after time, with its consistent appearance in the top 12 of the PGL usage stats, that it is an omnipresent threat, and it shows no signs of slowing down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rock Slide is a viable alternative to Stone Edge if accuracy is a concern. If you don't care too much about opposing Salamence or Gyarados, the power drop will not be a huge issue. Toxic can be used to wear down bulky, sustaining checks such as Mega Slowbro, Cresselia, and Hippowdon. Note that regular Slowbro can still be an issue due to Regenerator, however. Low Kick can be used if High Jump Kick's and Superpower's drawbacks are too much, but its lower Base Power against certain important targets such as Rotom-W and Garchomp can be a problem. Will-O-Wisp is an unusual choice to weaken Azumarill, Salamence, Gyarados, and Dragonite and can be used to cripple some enemies in a pinch. Brave Bird may seem appealing, but it only hits Mega Venusaur.</p> <p>On the mixed set, Hidden Power Electric and Grass are viable alternatives—the former smashes Gyarados and the latter takes down Quagsire, Swampert, and Gastrodon. Both options also deal respectable damage to Slowbro. Fire Blast can be used instead of Overheat for a more consistent damage output, but it might fail to OHKO Aegislash. On the Baton Pass set, Blaziken can surprise enemy phazers by carrying Roar.</p> <p>Blaziken can utilize Scope Lens + Focus Energy for fun. This amplifies Blaziken's critical hit rate on regular moves to 100% and, because critical hits ignore stat drops, Blaziken can freely spam Overheat and Superpower at 150% damage without suffering from the offensive stat drops unless it hits a foe that has Shell Armor or Battle Armor or is shielded by Lucky Chant. It is not as good as it sounds, however, as the turn Blaziken uses to set up Focus Energy can be used for something more productive, such as setting up a Swords Dance. However, Baton Passing Focus Energy and Speed boosts to Sniper Kingdra can be devastating.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Blaziken's STAB Moves: Slowbro, Salamence, Gyarados, Talonflame, Azumarill, Mega Latias, Mega Altaria, and Dragonite can tank Blaziken's STAB attacks easily. Mega Slowbro will completely wall Blaziken if it lacks a super effective Hidden Power.</p> <p><strong>Suicune: Although High Jump Kick can 2HKO Suicune with high rolls, Suicune can easily handle everything else Blaziken throws at it. Rocky Helmet can knock Blaziken into Scald's KO range and Roar can nullify the Baton Pass set very easily.</p> <p><strong>Cresselia</strong>: Cresselia is bulky enough to withstand every attack Blaziken throws at it and can threaten back with Thunder Wave and Psychic. It can also heal off the damage Blaziken dealt with Moonlight. Knock Off can nullify the threat of Cresselia's Rocky Helmet, however.</p> <p><strong>Hippowdon</strong>: High physical bulk, access to reliable recovery, a phazing move, and a STAB Earthquake can make short work of Blaziken's Mega and Baton Pass sets. If nothing else, Rocky Helmet and Sand Stream can both quickly deplete Blaziken's health.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Note that while Blaziken resists most priority moves, it is weak to Flying and Water, making priority users such as Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Azumarill, and Crawdaunt tremendous issues. Similarly, Prankster Thunder Wave can shut down Blaziken's sweeping attempt, although it will often come at the cost of that Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Rocky Helmet: Blaziken typically runs contact moves, meaning Rocky Helmet can punish it, especially when combined with Flare Blitz's recoil.</p> <p><strong>Prediction</strong>: Correctly predicting Blaziken's Fighting-type STAB move and responding to it appropriately can severely weaken Blaziken. Sending a Zapdos into Blaziken's Superpower, for example, lowers its Attack so that Zapdos can comfortably stall it. Likewise, sending a Ghost-type Pokemon into High Jump Kick will quickly make Blaziken regret the turn.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Flare Blitz and Superpower / High Jump Kick serve as powerful STAB moves, backed by Blaziken's titanic base 160 Attack. Superpower is more reliable than High Jump Kick, but the Attack drop deters repeated usage and can make sweeping difficult. High Jump Kick offers even more power and no stat drawbacks, but it can miss and severely cripple Blaziken, often leading to its demise. It is important to keep in mind common Protect users and Ghost-type Pokemon when using that move.</p> <p>Regardless, the sheer strength of these moves often requires opponents to have Pokemon that either resist both or pack extremely high physical bulk. Even then, Blaziken has options to get around these foes. Knock Off smashes apart Latios, non-mega Latias, and Chandelure and deals solid damage to Cresselia and Slowbro. It can remove Rocky Helmet, relieving the passive pressure Blaziken gets from repeatedly using contact moves. Stone Edge destroys Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y and can make Salamence, Gyarados, and Dragonite think twice before switching in. However, its accuracy can be rather problematic, so it may be wise to run Rock Slide instead. Thunder Punch can be used to smash Gyarados and Azumarill, although it hits no other notable targets. If the bonus coverage is not needed, Blaziken can use Swords Dance to boost its Attack to sky-high levels, allowing it to sweep with ease. Protect is mandatory in order to guarantee a turn of Speed Boost, especially during the turn Blaziken Mega Evolves.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>As with most glass cannon sweepers, maximizing Attack and Speed is recommended to hit as hard and as quickly as possible. With maximum Speed, Mega Blaziken can attempt to Speed tie with the likes of Mega Charizard X and Volcarona, potentially pulling a clutch victory. Adamant is recommended over Jolly, as Adamant Blaziken outruns every relevant unboosted Pokemon at +1 Speed.</p> <p>Both Blaze and Speed Boost are viable abilities to choose from for the base Blaziken. Blaze may sound odd at first, but if you're going to Mega Evolve Blaziken anyways, having Speed Boost on the base forme can be pointless. With Blaze, Blaziken has an incentive to not immediately mega evolve. Sometimes odd scenarios in which Blaze is more useful can happen, such as preventing enemy Porygon2 from being able to Trace Speed Boost, or times when Blaziken needs the power boost from Blaze to KO something. Regardless, these situations are incredibly rare. Speed Boost allows for more teambuilding flexibility—some teams will prefer having two Mega Pokemon but may often not use them together. In the cases where both Pokemon are required in one squad, Blaziken can forgo its Mega Evolution and remain relevant due to Speed Boost.</p> <p>In short, choose Blaze if Blaziken will be your only Mega Evolution on the team and choose Speed Boost if you have another potential Mega Evolution.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As a Mega Pokemon, Blaziken will often be the center of your team's focus. Evaluate the number of enemies Blaziken can defeat in Team Preview before deciding to bring it in, then bring the appropriate amount of support once you decide on that. It may not be the best idea to bring it if your opponent has two or more Blaziken checks or two or more Pokemon that can outduel it. For example, a team with Cresselia / Azumarill / Talonflame / Aegislash / Garchomp / Mega Kangaskhan is probably not something you should bring Blaziken into.</p> <p>Due to the side effects of Blaziken's STAB moves combined with its frailty, it is important to note that mispredictions can be immediately costly. Be careful with using High Jump Kick if there are enemy Ghost-types around, or if Blaziken is facing a common Protect user such as Heatran or enemy Blaziken. Speaking of Protect, try not to be predictable when using it, as it can lead to the opponent getting a free switch to a check.</p> <p>Blaziken's sheer offensive strength allows it to be used as both a wallbreaker and a cleaner, although it is more proficient at the latter. With that and its resistances, switching Blaziken into direct attacks is possible, despite its overall frailty. However, Blaziken should primarily be switching in to revenge kill after a teammate faints so it does not take too much damage and subsequently knock itself out via Flare Blitz recoil.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Zapdos and Rotom-W cover most of Blaziken's checks, such as Azumarill, Salamence, Gyarados, Slowbro, and Talonflame. Both of them can use Volt Switch to help bring Blaziken in easier. In turn, Blaziken can threaten Grass-types that beat Rotom-W and can defeat certain Pokemon that give Zapdos issues, such as Greninja, Tyranitar, and Gengar. Ferrothorn can defeat Water-types such as Suicune, threaten Cresselia with passive damage, and set up Stealth Rock to aid Blaziken's sweep. Zapdos's Fighting resistance helps turn the trio of Zapdos / Blaziken / Ferrothorn into a solid balanced squad. Blaziken / Rotom-W / Ferrothorn is also another great core, featuring the Fire / Water / Grass combination. Thundurus can fulfill a somewhat similar role to Zapdos and offers more power in exchange for reduced durability.</p> <p>Stealth Rock can aid Blaziken massively. A number of Blaziken's checks are weak to it (most notably Talonflame). Furthermore, Stealth Rock ensures that Blaziken will 2HKO Suicune with High Jump Kick. A few notable Stealth Rock users include Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Ferrothorn.</p>"

It reliably destroys Aegislash as well and, because it is a special attack, it won't be affected by Mawile's Intimidate. Hidden Power Ice OHKOes Landorus-T, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Mega Salamence. Superpower and High Jump Kick are strong STAB options despite lacking full investment. Protect is a necessity to quickly patch Blaziken's mediocre Speed.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Blaziken's talents extend to its non-Mega usage. With a mixed set, Blaziken can carve out an offensive niche that is not outclassed by its Mega Evolution. Sporting formidable 120 / 110 offenses backed by Life Orb, Blaziken can still dish out tremendous amounts of damage and even slightly outclass its Mega Evolution power-wise if it attempts to pull off the same set. Here are some calculations to demonstrate Blaziken's power.</p> <pre><code>244 SpA Life Orb Blaziken Hidden Power Ice vs. 0 HP / 0 SpD Garchomp: 182-218 (99.4 - 119.1%) -- 93.8% chance to OHKO [this doesn't change with 252 SpA] 244 SpA Life Orb Blaziken Hidden Power Ice vs. 0 HP / 0 SpD Mega Salamence: 177-208 (104.1 - 122.3%) -- guaranteed OHKO 52 Atk Life Orb Blaziken Superpower vs. 252 HP / 4 Def Heatran: 203-242 (102.5 - 122.2%) -- guaranteed OHKO 52 Atk Life Orb Blaziken Superpower vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Mega Kangaskhan: 218-257 (102.8 - 121.2%) -- guaranteed OHKO 244 SpA Life Orb Blaziken Overheat vs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Aegislash-Shield: 179-213 (107.1 - 127.5%) -- guaranteed OHKO 244 SpA Life Orb Blaziken Overheat vs. 252 HP / 0 SpD Zapdos: 140-165 (71 - 83.7% + 35.5 - 42.1%) -- guaranteed 2HKO 244 SpA Life Orb Blaziken Overheat vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Mega Gengar: 134-160 (98.5 - 117.6%) -- 93.8% chance to OHKO </pre> <p>With 212 Speed EVs, Blaziken's Speed reaches 208 at +1, outspeeding Choice Scarf Rotom formes and base 135 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Manectric and Mega Lopunny. Maximizing Speed is a viable option, as Blaziken can outrun up to Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Sceptile at +1.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set can function as a lure, so it may be in your best interest to carry a Pokemon that appreciates certain checks baited and removed by Blaziken. However, some people may expect it if you don't Mega Evolve Blaziken. Try predicting your opponent's usual check to it on the switch before he or she suspects something is up and punishes you for it. Remember that this Blaziken's Fighting-type STAB move is not as powerful, so enemies such as Suicune and Azumarill can be sent in more comfortably.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because this set does not require Blaziken to Mega Evolve, feel free to use Mega Pokemon in conjunction with it. Mega Gengar can destroy Mega Slowbro and threaten Cresselia and Azumarill, while Blaziken scares off Dark-type Pokemon such as Bisharp and Hydreigon. Mega Salamence appreciates Blaziken's ability to threaten Skarmory, Tyranitar, Zapdos, and Porygon2.</p> <p>As mentioned before, Blaziken can lure enemies with this set. There are some Pokemon that can take advantage of a successful bait. For example, Aegislash and Mega Kangaskhan appreciate Blaziken dealing severe damage to Hippowdon, and Mega Venusaur can have a field day if Blaziken can successfully bait and destroy Mega Salamence.</p>"

      {
        "name": "Baton Pass",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance and Protect allow Blaziken to quickly stack stat boosts to Baton Pass to teammates. Bulk Up + Weakness Policy is also viable for greater payoff potential, but this strategy is less reliable. High Jump Kick lets Blaziken hurt foes if it absolutely needs to, but it should be used sparingly, especially because missing or hitting a Rocky Helmet Pokemon will waste its Focus Sash. Substitute with Leftovers is viable if your recipient Pokemon requires multiple Speed boosts. It can also block predicted Thunder Waves, allowing for a safer pass. It also blocks Imposter so Ditto doesn't turn the boosts against the recipient.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs are used for the best overall bulk because this set will not be attacking much. Maximum Speed allows Blaziken to Baton Pass away with minimum Speed boosts, assuming the recipient does not require multiple boosts. There is also the fact that there really aren't better stats to invest the EVs in, assuming Jolly.</p> <p>Impish is also viable with maximum HP and Defense EVs. Blaziken can take a Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird from Talonflame after a Bulk Up, activate Weakness Policy, and Baton Pass away. It will also be guaranteed to survive Garchomp's Earthquake without any defensive boosts.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set can work quite well as a lead, but beware if the enemy has potential phazers such as Suicune. Priority moves can also ruin Baton Pass. If you anticipate the foe having a priority move, make sure Blaziken uses Baton Pass in a healthy state before its HP gets too low and it can be picked off. Don't make your Baton Passes predictable. Oftentimes, you may want to Baton Pass as soon as Blaziken gains sufficient boosts. You don't always want to wait to Baton Pass until you're unable to boost any further, because this telegraphs that your move next turn will be Baton Pass. This makes it easier for your opponent to punish your recipient.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Kangaskhan is the best recipient for Blaziken's boosts. It is bulky enough to take most incoming punishment and possesses the raw strength to simply batter defensive threats with a boost. It also bypasses Sturdy and Focus Sash thanks to Parental Bond. Mega Mawile is another fearsome ally—a speedy Mega Mawile can be terrifying due to how much raw damage it deals. It also resists Brave Bird, Ice Shard, Sucker Punch, and Extreme Speed and is bulky enough to withstand Aqua Jets and Mach Punches, making revenge killing it difficult. Generally, any physical attacker will work as a teammate depending on the situation. For example, Blaziken can Baton Pass to Mega Salamence to avoid Earthquake, or Baton Pass to Garchomp to avoid Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Mega Latias deserves a special note for being able to act as an unexpected partner. With sufficient boosts, Mega Latias can deal tremendous amounts of damage with Stored Power. Use the Bulk Up / Weakness Policy set with this.</p>"

  "Breloom": {
    "overview": "<p>Breloom is the universal lead of Battle Spot. With an amazing moveset at its disposal, there's no reason you'd have another lead on most teams. It has the ability to bluff its lead role and can be used as a late-game sweeper, finishing off weakened Pokemon with Mach Punch. One thing that makes Breloom stand out compared to other leads is its access to Spore, which can have a great effect on the outcome of a battle. However, Breloom suffers from weak defensive stats, so using an item besides Focus Sash is quite risky. To add on to that, lots of Pokemon wall Breloom, from Aegislash, which resists any move Breloom can throw at it, to Ferrothorn, which can hurt Breloom without even attacking it. Breloom also suffers from a low base 70 Speed, so a plethora of commonly used Pokemon, such as Rotom-W and Landorus, can easily use a pivot move to avoid a Spore.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Poison Heal is an option over Technician for Breloom if you want to surprise your opponents. With Poison Heal, Breloom can also take advantage of the fact that it can recover more health than it would with Leftovers. It can get a free Focus Punch out of using Substitute as well. If Breloom is doing too little damage, it can run Swords Dance, although it is hard to fit into a moveset without losing coverage. You can use Life Orb if you don't want to lose power, although because Breloom is quite frail, it is not the best option. Choice Scarf is an option, although it is not the best choice because it locks Breloom into one move. However, with no Sleep Clause, it is able to spam a fast Spore repeatedly.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Chesnaught, Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth are immune to Spore, often have access to recovery moves, and can easily deal with Breloom.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: With entry hazard support, Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Blaziken can outspeed Breloom and OHKO it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards: Entry hazards break Breloom's Focus Sash, which significantly lowers Breloom's effectiveness due to its frailty and low Speed.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash</strong>: Aegislash is immune to Breloom's Fighting-type moves, resists Rock Tomb, and can KO Breloom with its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Mandibuzz</strong>: Mandibuzz is a huge issue for Breloom. With its ability Overcoat, it is immune to Spore, and it is bulky enough to avoid being 2HKOed by any move Breloom can throw at it.</p> <p><strong>Safety Goggles</strong>: Pokemon holding a Safety Goggles are immune to Spore.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn can break Breloom's Focus Sash with Iron Barbs and is immune to Spore. Additionally, Mach Punch only 3HKOes Ferrothorn, while Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball OHKOes Breloom.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar can trap and KO Breloom, as it is faster and immune to Mach Punch. Mega Gengar can also burn Breloom with Will-O-Wisp, rendering any move besides Spore practically useless, as well as letting Mega Gengar survive a couple of Rock Tombs.</p> <p><strong>Mega Lopunny and Mega Kangaskhan</strong>: Both Mega Lopunny and Mega Kangaskhan are capable of breaking Breloom's Focus Sash with a Fake Out and are able to survive a Mach Punch and outspeed Breloom for an evident KO. Mega Kangaskhan can also beat Breloom regardless of whether it uses Fake Out or not, as its ability, Parental Bond, causes its moves to hit twice.</p>",

      {
        "name": "Offensive Spore",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With no Sleep Clause, Breloom is sure to put more than one foe to sleep with Spore. It can be used on a predicted switch to ease prediction, unless a Grass-type or Pokemon with Overcoat, such as Venusaur and Mandibuzz, happens to still be alive. Technician-boosted Mach Punch is Breloom's essential STAB priority move. It is Breloom's primary revenge killing tool and helps to wear down opposing Pokemon. Bullet Seed is Breloom's strongest STAB move after the Technician boost, and it is useful for breaking Focus Sash and Sturdy users. Rock Tomb is extremely practical for lowering the Speed of predicted switch-ins. Rock Tomb also lets Breloom hit Pokemon such as Charizard, Talonflame, and Thundurus, which would otherwise resist any move Breloom could throw at it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This set is optimized to get the best out of Technician while abusing the fact that there is no Sleep Clause. The EVs are maxed out in Attack and Speed for Breloom to get the most out of its hits and so Breloom can outspeed Pokemon such as Mega Swampert. Adamant is used for increased power, but Jolly can be used to ensure that Breloom outspeeds and puts as many Pokemon to sleep as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Breloom set is best described as a suicide lead. With no Sleep Clause, Breloom causes plenty of switches, whether it's to take care of a Spore or to just absorb any hit. When predicting a switch, use Spore so that whatever is switching in is put to sleep and thus rendered useless. However, because Grass-types are immune to Spore, if you predict that the foe is going to switch one in, use it as an opportunity to double switch and gain the advantage. If you predict something faster, such as Talonflame, to switch in, use Rock Tomb to either lower its Speed or KO it altogether. Pokemon with Lum Berry or Sleep Talk put a dent in this set because they won't have to worry about Spore at any point and can thus break Breloom's Focus Sash, rendering Breloom largely useless. Mega Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Lopunny have no problem breaking Breloom's Focus Sash with Fake Out, which is problematic for Breloom. Even though they are weak to Mach Punch, at max health, they both can survive any of Breloom's attacks.</p> <p>If you are facing a sandstorm team, you might want to reconsider using Breloom as a lead, as sandstorm damage will break its Focus Sash. However, although it might be tempting to stay in and go for the Mach Punch on Tyranitar or the Bullet Seed on Hippowdon, you must analyze the situation to see if you will need to use Breloom's Focus Sash later in the match.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fire-types such as Heatran are great partners for Breloom; Heatran resists all of Breloom's weaknesses and counters Talonflame as well as checking Aegislash, two of the most common Pokemon in the metagame that have positive matchups against Breloom. Mega Charizard Y can help Breloom avoid getting its Focus Sash broken by weather because of Drought. Mega Gengar can come in on a sleeping foe, trap it, and use a boosted STAB Hex as well as use Destiny Bond on any troublesome Pokemon that can affect the team as a whole. Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Rhyperior can also help Breloom deal with Fire- and Flying-types that can cause Breloom a lot of trouble. Water-types such as Suicune and Quagsire are good partners for Breloom because they can deal with physical Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, and Blaziken as well as provide a nice general bulky Water presence and support. Breloom also helps Calm Mind Suicune and Raikou set up and sweep by eliminating opposing Water- and Ground-types, respectively. Flying-types such as Mega Salamence, Mega Pinsir, and Talonflame are good partners because they can beat Breloom's most common counters, Mega Venusaur and Chesnaught, with their STAB Flying-type moves. Talonflame can also use Tailwind, which can mitigate Breloom's low base Speed by allowing it to outspeed a plethora of threats. Breloom also suffers from being frail and slow, which is why bulky Pokemon such as Rocky Helmet Cresselia and Rocky Helmet Zapdos help out against Mega Lopunny and Mega Kangaskhan, which are big threats to Breloom. Zapdos and Cresselia wall these threats and deal passive damage with Rocky Helmet, making them great partners for Breloom. Lunar Dance Cresselia is also an option, as it can bring back Breloom to full health, which is great if Breloom hasn't lost its Focus Sash. To help with Breloom's low Speed, fast Fighting-types such as Blaziken can assist in handling threats by having a chance to OHKO Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan with High Jump Kick.</p>"

  "Sableye": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Sableye's excellent bulk and access to support moves and reliable recovery allow it to be an effective stop to many physical attackers and defensive Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Garchomp, Chansey, and Cresselia. Its Dark / Ghost typing gives it immunities to Fighting, Normal, and Psychic, a resistance to Poison, and only weak to Fairy. Magic Bounce allows Mega Sableye to effectively bounce back any kind of status move, making it a great status absorber and letting it act as a setup Pokemon that doesn't have to worry about Taunt, Leech Seed, and any status-inducing moves such as Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, and Thunder Wave. Mega Sableye is also the biggest counter to SwagPlay strategies, making your opponent think twice before sending out Klefki, Liepard, and Thundurus. Sableye also has access to Prankster prior to Mega Evolution, which grants its non-damaging moves priority, notably letting it burn its foes with Will-O-Wisp and recover off damage with priority. Sableye uses both the number of physical attackers dominating the metagame and entry hazards being less common in Battle Spot Singles to its advantage by not having to Mega Evolve the first turn, letting it punish Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Garchomp, and Landorus-T with Prankster Will-O-Wisp and Mega Evolve when it needs to.</p> <p>Battle Spot Singles is a very fast-paced metagame, which means Sableye can't utilize its stalling capability to its full potential. Even with Mega Sableye's extra bulk, its low HP is a problem. With the Speed decrease after Mega Evolving, Mega Sableye will have huge difficulty outspeeding any threat in the metagame. However, priority STAB Sucker Punch along with its passable Attack after Mega Evolution assists with its terrible Speed. Sableye still lacks offensive presence, though, increasing its reliance on setting up Calm Mind to deal more damage. However, Foul Play helps with that against the monstrous physical attackers of Battle Spot. Also, Sableye is very vulnerable to wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Hydreigon, Mega Charizard X, Serperior, and Thundurus, so leaving it in against those threats would mean trouble for the jewel thief.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dark Pulse can be used for perfect accuracy with Calm Mind, but Snarl is much better to help Sableye stall out special attackers. Metal Burst can be used as a surprise attack to many setup sweepers and powerful attackers, but Sableye doesn't have the bulk to take too much damage prior to Mega Evolving. Mega Sableye would be able to take certain attacks such as burned Bisharp's Iron Head at +2; the problem is that its low Speed keeps it from outspeeding many threats to use Recover, which makes Mega Sableye an open target for another attack. Gravity can be used to boost Will-O-Wisp's and Snarl's accuracy to 100 percent along with giving teammates such as Garchomp and Landorus-T the ability to hit Flying-types such as Zapdos and Talonflame with Earthquake. However, Gravity gives your team pretty slow momentum, only lasts for five turns, and requires a turn to set up, which is pretty critical in the metagame. Swagger can be used to confuse foes and increase the damage output of Foul Play; however, Sableye is outclassed by Thundurus and Klefki as a Swagger user, as they both have access to Prankster Thunder Wave, and Klefki has excellent defensive typing, boasting useful resistances to Flying, Ice, Dark, and most importantly Fairy, which Sableye is weak to.</p> <p>Leftovers is useful together with Recover to gain back health. Shadow Ball hits Ghost- and Psychic-types; however, Dark Pulse and Snarl hit everything that Shadow Ball does and don't leave Mega Sableye walled by Normal-types. Substitute allows Sableye to avoid any status moves and can be used to stall with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic. With Prankster, Sableye will freely set up a Substitute if it's not fighting faster Prankster users such as Thundurus and Whimsicott. Knock Off can be used to hit item-reliant Pokemon such as Garchomp, Chansey, Landorus-T, and Porygon2. Power Gem allows Mega Sableye to hit Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Weavile. However, Mega Sableye relies more on its STAB moves. Toxic is good for putting defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia, Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Porygon2 on a timer, but Will-O-Wisp is much more viable due to it crippling physical attackers, despite the increase in damage Toxic does each turn. A specially defensive spread along with a Calm nature is viable when using the Calm Mind set. This can catch people off guard; Mega Sableye will likely lure in special attackers such as Mega Gengar, Aegislash, and Greninja and deal with them better. Prankster Will-O-Wisp still helps against physical attackers, so you don't have to worry too much about the loss of Defense.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Dealing with Fairy-types can be a massive dilemma for Sableye. Sableye is unable to tank hits from Fairy-types and oftentimes can't cripple them with Will-O-Wisp, as the majority of them are special attackers. Clefable has Unaware, which can discourage Mega Sableye from setting up Calm Mind, and can proceed to KO it with Moonblast. Even though Mega Mawile gets burned by Prankster Will-O-Wisp, it can proceed to use Sableye as setup fodder by using Swords Dance and threaten it thanks to its ability Huge Power. Azumarill can use Belly Drum even if Mega Sableye has burned it and KO it with STAB Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types have an immunity to Will-O-Wisp, which makes Mega Sableye vulnerable to several threats. Blaziken, Mega Charizard X, and Volcarona can all use Mega Sableye as setup fodder. Mega Charizard Y can deal a lot of damage to Mega Sableye under the sun with its STAB Fire-type moves, acting as a great wallbreaker. Heatran can switch in and get a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp and use that as an opportunity to hit Mega Sableye with Magma Storm. Entei can break past Mega Sableye's physical bulk with Sacred Fire and burn it. Talonflame isn't at all affected by the Special Attack decrease from Snarl, and specially defensive variants are becoming more common. However, both Mega Charizard X and Talonflame need to be wary of Foul Play while setting up Dragon Dance or Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers: Sableye is unable to outspeed Thundurus to Taunt it and prevent Thundurus from using Thunder Wave or Taunt itself. However, Sableye can reflect Thundurus's status moves if it Mega Evolves. Some Thundurus variants run Nasty Plot, which they can use to set up on Sableye and KO it with Thunderbolt. With Contrary, Serperior can out-boost Calm Mind Mega Sableye and get more damage off with Leaf Storm. Mega Sableye isn't able to deal much damage back if it hasn't already set up. Choice Specs Hydreigon can give Mega Sableye a lot of trouble if it has no Calm Mind boosts. Mega Gengar is able to take down Mega Sableye with Shadow Ball; however, it needs to be wary of Snarl.</p> <p><strong>-Ate Ability Users: Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Mega Altaria, and the uncommon Mega Pinsir can take advantage of Mega Sableye's Will-O-Wisp with Facade. Additionally, all three Pokemon can set up on Mega Sableye with Dragon Dance and Swords Dance and proceed to KO it with Pixilate or Aerilate Facade. Choice Specs Sylveon can OHKO even +1 Mega Sableye with Pixilate Hyper Voice, as can Mega Gardevoir with a little prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Raikou and Suicune: Raikou and Suicune can set up Calm Mind and beat Mega Sableye. Raikou can set up behind a Substitute and hit Sableye with its STAB Electric-type move; however, it cannot afford to be burned by Will-O-Wisp, and Snarl can deal damage through Substitute. Suicune can repeatedly use Scald in order to attempt to burn Mega Sableye. With Mega Sableye receiving residual damage, it'll struggle to continue to Recover health, while Suicune can use those turns to set up Calm Mind or go for another Scald. Additionally, both Raikou and Suicune have Pressure, allowing them to stall out Mega Sableye.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Will-O-Wisp gives Mega Sableye and its teammates excellent support in crippling physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Salamence, and Garchomp, which helps it set up Calm Mind on them. This also helps get residual damage on Pokemon that lack recovery such as Ferrothorn. Recover gives Mega Sableye a reliable recovery move, increasing its longevity so that it can gain more Calm Mind boosts and wear down the opposing team with Will-O-Wisp. Calm Mind boosts Mega Sableye's Special Attack and Special Defense by one stage, making it a bulky sweeper and helping it survive special attacks. Snarl reduces the opposing Pokemon's Special Attack by one stage. With Calm Mind and Recover, it can assist in stalling out opposing Calm Mind users such as Raikou.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Prankster gives Sableye priority on Will-O-Wisp, Recover, and Calm Mind. Prankster is active on the turn Sableye Mega Evolves as well. Sablenite is used to increase Sableye's bulk, allowing it to check many physical attackers and defensive Pokemon. Gaining Magic Bounce helps Mega Sableye be a great status absorber, bouncing back any status move to the foe. Maximum HP and Defense EVs with a Bold nature optimize Sableye's bulk because the majority of attackers in Battle Spot Singles are physical, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Mawile, Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Make sure to Mega Evolve Sableye and set up Calm Mind on defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Chansey, and Porygon2, which are likely to status it. Chansey and Ferrothorn can't do anything to Mega Sableye. If the opponent has Heatran and leads with a physical attacker like Garchomp, they will usually expect Will-O-Wisp and switch out to get the Flash Fire boost. On some occasions, you really don't need to Mega Evolve Sableye, as it can stall out some physical attackers on its own. For example, against Landorus-T and Garchomp, Sableye can use Prankster Will-O-Wisp to burn them, cutting their Attack and dealing residual damage each turn while Sableye stalls them out with Recover. Mega Sableye is very vulnerable to Fairy-types, so keep it away from them and make sure you have a partner for them.</p> <p>Entry hazards aren't all that common in Battle Spot Singles due to it being fast paced, so you can focus more on Sableye stalling out the foes. Dealing with special attackers can be tricky because Sableye's Special Defense isn't all that great. The best it can do is set up Calm Mind on the first turn and then Mega Evolve to go for Recover. Mega Sableye has a huge presence in Team Preview for the opponent. Many physical attackers don't enjoy getting burned by Will-O-Wisp, so the opponent will most likely bring their special attackers and leave their physical threats such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mega Kangaskhan behind. Play this to your team's advantage when picking which three to send out to battle. Mega Sableye should definitely not stay in on dangerous special attackers such as Choice Specs Hydreigon and Serperior unless it has set up enough Calm Minds. Because Mega Sableye is slow and almost always goes second, it is very important to keep track of its HP and how much damage the foes do so you can judge when to use Recover and when to set up Calm Mind.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran 4x resists Fairy-type attacks, while Mega Sableye can safely switch into Fighting-type attacks. Excadrill can also remove Fairy-types from the field with STAB Iron Head and dent Electric- and Fire-types such as Raikou and Heatran with Earthquake. Additionally, Choice Scarf variants of Excadrill carry Rock Slide, demolishing Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y. Scizor can use Fairy-types to set up with Swords Dance and eliminate them with Bullet Punch. Clefable makes for a great partner for Mega Sableye because many sweepers like to set up on it. Switching Unaware Clefable into the foe can prevent them from using Mega Sableye as a setup fodder. Mega Sableye can also switch into resisted Poison-type moves for Clefable and burn some physical Steel-types that threaten Clefable such as Excadrill and Scizor. Thundurus can paralyze the foe with Thunder Wave or shut down defensive Pokemon with Taunt, allowing Mega Sableye to get free turns to set up Calm Mind.</p> <p>Gengar can be a nice partner, removing Fairy-types with its Poison-type STAB move and switching into Ground-type moves due to Levitate. Together, Chansey and Mega Sableye can make a fine defensive core. With Mega Sableye burning the foe with Will-O-Wisp, both Pokemon can tank more hits from physical attackers. Chansey's amazing special bulk lets it switch into several special attacks for Mega Sableye, while it appreciates the removal of Ghost-types such as Mega Gengar and Aegislash. Breloom can provide Spore support along with eliminating Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Talonflame with Rock Tomb. Also, it can help clear the field of Water-types such as Suicune and Rotom-W. While Breloom is a shaky check to Fire-types, with Focus Sash + Rock Tomb and Spore, it has a chance to stop them in their tracks. Latias can provide Thunder Wave support and switch into predicted Ground-type moves, as well as use Healing Wish to bring Mega Sableye in with full health along with healing it of any status. Choice variants of Latias help cripple Suicune, a common check that can use Sableye as setup fodder due to Pressure and superb bulk, and it also helps eliminate Fighting-types such as Blaziken and Mega Lopunny that threaten Mega Sableye.</p> <p>Bulky Ground-types such as Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Mamoswine are all fine partners with Sableye. Not only are they great Stealth Rock users, but they also are able to check dangerous Fire- and Steel-types such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard X, Mega Lucario, and Mega Mawile. The former two also deal with Blaziken, while Mamoswine is able to check Mega Altaria and Mega Salamence relatively well. Mega Kangaskhan is a great partner for Sableye, as it can eliminate Pokemon that Sableye hates such as Mega Salamence, Clefable, and Heatran. VoltTurn support in general from partners such as Rotom-W and Landorus-T is neat for getting Sableye in safely because it's not very bulky prior to Mega Evolving.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Will-O-Wisp is required on Mega Sableye to cripple physical attackers. Recover replenishes Mega Sableye's health and pairs nicely with Will-O-Wisp to rack up damage every turn while stalling. Foul Play punishes setup sweepers such as Mega Salamence, Mega Kangaskhan, Talonflame, Mega Charizard X, and Aegislash. Taunt helps with stallbreaking Pokemon such as Chansey along with preventing Pokemon from setting up on it prior to Mega Evolution. Sucker Punch is a great STAB move for Mega Sableye, as it can deal massive damage against frail Pokemon such as Mega Gengar. Together, Foul Play + Sucker Punch is a guaranteed KO on Mega Gengar. When using Sucker Punch over Taunt, Mega Sableye will need to be wary of stall Pokemon and setup sweepers such as Suicune, Clefable, and Mega Salamence.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs optimize Mega Sableye's overall bulk, and 204 Defense EVs with an Impish nature increase its physical bulk. 52 Special Defense EVs help Sableye take special attacks from the likes of Mega Gengar and Aegislash and give it a chance to survive Serperior's Leaf Storm at +4 Special Attack. Prankster gives Sableye's non-attacking moves priority before and while it Mega Evolves. Sablenite is used to increase Sableye's bulk. With this in mind, the physical bulk and Will-O-Wisp will allow Mega Sableye to wall several physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Landorus-T, and Garchomp.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Stallbreaker Sableye can easily disable defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia, Chansey, and Ferrothorn with Taunt. You can use the free turn as an opportunity to switch in a setup sweeper while they can't recover any health for the next turn. You can burn any physical attackers you see with Will-O-Wisp; the only thing to worry about is using it when you see a Fire-type in Team Preview because that'll just give them a safe switch in. After burning them, you can stall out the physical attackers with Recover + Foul Play. This makes Mega Sableye a pretty good lead. You can also trick your opponent because many always lead with a Mega Sableye counter, expecting Mega Sableye to come out first. Mega Sableye is best switched in from a fallen teammate because it doesn't want to take any hits on the switch prior to Mega Evolving. When Mega Sableye is low on health, it's best to just keep it in as death fodder due to its terrible Speed. Most opponents don't expect this set, so Taunt / Sucker Punch might be able to catch them off guard.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran, Excadrill, Scizor, and Aegislash get rid of Fairy-types for Sableye. Rotom-W can be paired up with Heatran and Mega Sableye, as the three provide excellent synergy with each other. Rotom-W can switch in on resisted Water- and Electric-type attacks for Heatran and Mega Sableye and is immune to Ground-type moves. Landorus-T can eliminate Fire- and Steel-types such as Talonflame and Excadrill. Sylveon helps eliminate Dark- and Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Mega Altaria, Mega Salamence, and Garchomp with Pixilate Hyper Voice. Ditto is a great revenge killer against offensive Pokemon such as Mega Gengar and Mega Charizard X. Mamoswine and Excadrill are immune to Electric-type attacks and can check Fire-types such as Talonflame and Mega Charizard X and Y. Greninja provides excellent coverage, getting rid of various Pokemon that threaten Mega Sableye such as Sylveon, Clefable, Thundurus, Mega Salamence, and Mega Altaria. Togekiss can be a nice teammate for clearing the field of Dark-, Dragon-, Fighting-, and Grass-types such as Hydreigon, Garchomp, Blaziken, and Serperior. Sableye appreciates Mega Kangaskhan on its team, as it is useful in some matchups that are unfavorable for Sableye. This can catch players off guard, as the presence of Mega Sableye in Team Preview can make the opponent bring their special attackers such as Mega Gengar, Aegislash, and Greninja. Return or Double-Edge from Mega Kangaskhan can KO many threats, and it outspeeds Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Clefable. Mega Kangaskhan also has access to Ice Punch to deal with Dragon-types such as Mega Salamence, Mega Altaria, and Garchomp.</p>"

  "Mawile": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to Mawile's fantastic Mega Evolution, it goes from zero to hero! Boasting the highest Attack stat in the game, an excellent typing, priority, and a great base ability in Intimidate, Mega Mawile is an incredibly daunting physical threat that's almost impossible to wall and difficult to wear down. This makes Mega Mawile an especially effective threat against Trick Room teams and stall teams. However, because of Mega Mawile's poor Speed stat, it's not too difficult to revenge kill early in the match. Simply hitting it with faster, strong STAB Ground-type and Fire-type attacks will usually end Mega Mawile's reign of terror. It doesn't help that most users of Will-O-Wisp outpace Mega Mawile as well. Because of Mega Mawile's flaws, it's not simply a Pokemon you can slap on your team; it's a powerful Pokemon you build your team around.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>If you want to take more advantage of Substitute, Focus Punch can be used over Swords Dance. While this lowers Mega Mawile's sweeping potential, the powerful Fighting-type attack can ruin Heatran and Porygon2. Brick Break might seem like a more appealing Fighting-type attack, but it's only notable for hitting Heatran harder than Knock Off does. Thunder Fang hits Gyarados and Skarmory hard, but Play Rough and Fire Fang usually make Thunder Fang too specialized for most teams to consider. On the support side, Mawile can use Taunt to ruin Skarmory, but Fire Fang usually works better. Pain Split gives Mega Mawile some extra longevity, but the turn is usually better spent attacking or setting up. Hyper Cutter can block Intimidate and help against Bisharp, but Intimidate's utility makes it the better choice almost every time.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Gliscor: Gliscor deserves special mention among Ground-types. Its defensive nature and use of Substitute make it very difficult to revenge kill and ruin usage of Sucker Punch for Mega Mawile. However, Gliscor must watch out for Knock Off, as losing Toxic Orb before its activation will cripple Gliscor.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran is a fairly good Mega Mawile switch-in as long as it avoids Knock Off, Brick Break, and Focus Punch. Heatran can easily carry Substitute to ward off Sucker Punch, while its STAB Fire-type attacks can incinerate Mega Mawile rather easily.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: While they get hit hard by Sucker Punch, Mega Charizard X and Y and Rotom-H do a fairly good job of revenge killing Mega Mawile. Both occasionally run Will-O-Wisp to ruin Mega Mawile that attempt to hit them Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Blaziken: Blaziken unfortunately does not resist Play Rough like most other Fire-types, but in exchange, its resistance to Sucker Punch can make it a particularly effective revenge killer.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Ground-types</strong>: While most Ground-types can't switch into Play Rough, they can usually survive a Sucker Punch at full health, and their immunity to Thunder Wave often makes them key roadblocks to a Mega Mawile sweep. The usual suspects here are Garchomp, Landorus-T, and to a lesser extent, Mamoswine and Excadrill.</p> <p><strong>Status: Will-O-Wisp can be a quick and dirty way to cripple Mega Mawile's sweeping capabilities. While Mega Mawile is already slow, Thunder Wave can ruin game plans revolving around speed control.</p> <p><strong>Bisharp</strong>: Bisharp alone isn't a particularly good check to Mega Mawile. However, Defiant can make the opponent question whether or not they should select Mega Mawile, as Intimidate can give Bisharp a sweeping opportunity.</p>",
    "sets": [

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Play Rough is Mega Mawile's devastating STAB move, smashing through anything that doesn't resist it. Sucker Punch is Mega Mawile's powerful priority move, allowing it to pick off weakened foes and clean offensive teams later in the game. It also avoids Aegislash's King's Shield, a great utility for a physical attacker. Swords Dance boosts Mega Mawile's Attack to absolutely apocalyptic levels. It might seem like overkill to boost what's already the highest Attack stat in the game, but Mega Mawile greatly benefits from Swords Dance for two reasons. Mega Mawile might be strong, but it requires a boost to break down walls such as Cresselia and Porygon2 effectively. The other reason is that an Attack boost makes sweeping through weakened offensive teams with Sucker Punch a much more realistic possibility.</p> <p>Knock Off is usually the easiest move to fit in the last slot. While its coverage might be redundant with Sucker Punch, it avoids the mind games Sucker Punch can be locked into, and its item-removing power can be extremely useful against certain switch-ins. Knock Off also allows Mega Mawile to wallbreak more easily, as it removes Porygon2's Eviolite and OHKOes Cresselia after a boost. Fire Fang is the more specialized option, having a shot at OHKOing Ferrothorn and 2HKOing opposing Mega Mawile even after Intimidate. Fire Fang also has a shot at OHKOing Skarmory after Stealth Rock and a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p>If you wish, there are even more specialized tools for Mega Mawile if you feel Knock Off and Fire Fang are not helping your team much. Facade can be used to laugh in the face of Will-O-Wisp, giving Mega Mawile an attack even more powerful than its STAB move when statused! Rock Slide and Stone Edge are acceptable attacks for crushing Talonflame and Charizard on the switch, and Rock Slide in particular can cause paralyzed foes to flinch. If you simply want a reliable, accurate STAB move, Iron Head can be used, with the bonus of being able to cause paralyzed targets to flinch, though using it comes at the cost of coverage. Finally, if Sucker Punch's mind games are simply too much for you to handle, you can use Substitute in the last slot at the cost of coverage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mawilite is the entire point of Mawile, so holding it is essential! Maximum HP investment along with Intimidate gives Mega Mawile the survivability it needs to launch off attacks, while maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature ensure that Mega Mawile's KOing power is through the roof! If you are using Mega Mawile in Trick Room, consider a Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs to underspeed Quiet Aegislash and opposing Mega Mawile. If you want a bit of extra bulk, consider an EV spread of 252 HP / 212 Atk / 44 Def. This EV spread allows a full-health Mega Mawile to survive Choice Band Talonflame's Flare Blitz after an Intimidate, which can ruin your opponent's win condition in a pinch!</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It's tempting use Swords Dance right away, but resist the urge earlier in the game. Mega Mawile might be powerful, but Sucker Punch doesn't OHKO everything with a boost, and Mega Mawile is also extremely vulnerable to Substitute and Will-O-Wisp. When your chances of sweeping aren't clear, Mega Mawile is better off using Play Rough or Knock Off, because even without a boost, these moves deal a tremendous amount of damage. Swords Dance is best used when you need Mega Mawile to break a defensive Pokemon or know that Mega Mawile will be able to sweep the rest of the opposing team.</p> <p>Mega Mawile might have decent bulk and a great ability and typing, but switching it into neutral attacks can ruin chances to launch attacks or set up. Try to goad your opponent into bringing in Pokemon that struggle against Mega Mawile. For example, double switching your physical threats from a predicted switch to Porygon2 or Cresselia can give Mega Mawile a serious advantage on the battlefield. In more desperate situations, you can attempt to force your opponent to KO one of your other Pokemon with Outrage, giving Mega Mawile a guaranteed turn to wreak havoc! Finally, scouting your opponent's team for Choice items can also work wonders, because Mega Mawile's wide array of resistances allows it to prey on many of these Pokemon.</p> <p>Mega Evolving Mawile on the first turn it's out is usually a fine option, but it's not always the best one. Intimidate is a fantastic ability on its own, so if you plan on switching out right away, don't Mega Evolve. This can allow Mawile to stop sweeps in desperate situations with a double dose of Intimidate and generally put more pressure on your opponent.</p> <p>Finally, one of the trickier aspects of Mega Mawile is Sucker Punch. Sucker Punch can be the root of terrifying, game-deciding mind games, due to its low PP. There isn't much that can be done about these mind games (besides running Substitute), so scouting your opponent's selection can at least ease some of this pain. For example, if an opposing Pokemon has Substitute, then using Sucker Punch can be riskier than usual.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Thunder Wave support is an easy way to make your opponent's Pokemon vulnerable to Mega Mawile. Because paralysis spreading tends to fail against offensive Ground-types, this makes Cresselia, Rotom-W, and Porygon2 excellent choices to consider. As a special note, Cresselia and Latias can use Lunar Dance and Healing Wish, respectively, to give Mega Mawile a second shot at sweeping. If you desire a more offensive option, you can opt for Thundurus, which has priority Thunder Waves to ruin offensive Pokemon's chances against Mega Mawile. Another form of speed control that can make Mega Mawile a terror is Trick Room. While the five turns can be limiting, they allow Mawile to blast through offensive Ground-types much more easily. Porygon2 and Cresselia are the best Pokemon for this job, thanks to their bulk allowing many setup opportunities.</p> <p>Mega Mawile's amazing typing leaves it vulnerable to only Fire- and Ground-type attacks, so make sure your team can cover those. Flying-type Pokemon and Levitate users are perfect for switching into Ground-type attacks, while Water-, Fire-, and Dragon-type Pokemon can aid against Fire-type attacks. These qualities make Rotom-W a fantastic partner for Mega Mawile. Not only do they cover each other's weaknesses, but Rotom-W can also deal with Talonflame and most Ground-types effectively, while Mega Mawile can switch into Grass-type attacks (though it should watch out for Breloom's Spore). On the more offensive side, Dragonite, Latios, Latias, and Hydreigon offer equally good typing synergy and can also lure in faster Outrages for Mega Mawile to take advantage of.</p> <p>Mega Mawile is extremely vulnerable to Will-O-Wisp if it lacks Facade. While special attackers can be used to absorb them, Fire-types such as Heatran and Blaziken can also switch into them (though both have problems switching into Rotom-W), while Heracross is notable for using Guts to take advantage of Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Finally, Mega Mawile's wallbreaking power can make it a useful teammate for several offensive Pokemon that are walled by Cresselia and Porygon2. Offensive Ground-types such as Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Landorus-T greatly appreciate Mega Mawile's wallbreaking powers.</p>"

  "Manectric": {
    "overview": "<p>With base 135 Speed, Manectric becomes one of the fastest Pokemon in the metagame after Mega Evolving, with very few Pokemon except Choice Scarf users able to outspeed it. It outspeeds common Pokemon such as Greninja, Mega Gengar, Mega Salamence, and Talonflame. Mega Manectric is able to lower the foe's Attack, thanks to its supportive ability Intimidate, so it can survive another hit from certain physically offensive Pokemon. This means that priority moves are less effective at KOing Mega Manectric, as most priority moves are physical. Mega Manectric has access to coverage moves such as Overheat and Hidden Power Ice in order to check or counter threats, and it can act as a nice scouter with Volt Switch, allowing it to switch out from foes that pose a huge threat. Against physical attackers not carrying a Choice Scarf, Mega Manectric's Speed allows it to attack first and Volt Switch out after lowering its foe's Attack with Intimidate. This can support a teammate in setting up against the weakened enemy. Mega Manectric is able to shut down a lot of common offensive Pokemon such as Azumarill. Unfortunately, Mega Manectric takes up a Mega slot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Protect allows Mega Manectric to scout the foe's move first and potentially cripple Choice Scarf users by locking them into a move, such as Garchomp using Earthquake. This gives Mega Manectric the time to switch out into a Pokemon that has a resistance to the attack. It is also useful in getting the Speed boost next turn after Mega Evolving. Unfortunately, it misses out on reliable coverage moves, and it could possibly cause the foe to set up on it. Magnet Rise allows Mega Manectric to avoid Ground-type attacks. Roar acts as a supportive move to Stealth Rock, getting passive damage off and messing up switch-ins. Substitute can be used on predicted switches and status moves. It also gives Mega Manectric a chance to beat Garchomp if it has Choice Scarf or Focus Sash. Toxic can act as a surprise status move to cripple special walls such as Cresselia.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Mamoswine can OHKO Mega Manectric even at -1 Attack with an Earthquake, with the exception of Excadrill, which still has a high 75% chance to OHKO Mega Manectric with Earthquake. Mega Manectric can't really do anything to Mamoswine outside of Overheat, and even that doesn't OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls such as Cresselia and Chansey can take continuous hits from Mega Manectric. Cresselia can use Mega Manectric as setup fodder, and Chansey can stall it out with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Mega Charizard X: Mega Charizard X resists all of Mega Manectric's attacks aside from Hidden Power Ice, which it can take several hits from. It can easily set up on Mega Manectric and KO it with any of its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar walls Mega Manectric and can 2HKO it with Earthquake, but Mega Manectric can use Volt Switch to switch into a check or counter.</p> <p><strong>Porygon2</strong>: Porygon2 can act as a special wall and switch into Manectric before it Mega Evolves. This is because of its ability Trace, which will copy Manectric's Lightning Rod ability.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is powerful enough to get many 2HKOs on frail Pokemon along with getting rid of Flying- and Water-types. Volt Switch allows for Mega Manectric to get some damage off against the foe before switching out. This is rather helpful against physical attackers when combined with Intimidate, as you can then send out a wall. Overheat is a very powerful Fire-type move and has nice coverage against Grass-, Ice-, and Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Glalie, and Scizor. Flamethrower can be used as an alternative to Overheat, which forces Mega Manectric to use Volt Switch or switch out after a -2 drop in Special Attack. While Flamethrower may not cripple Manectric the same way Overheat does, it should be noted that Flamethrower is a weaker Fire-type move, which means Aegislash can avoid a 2HKO. Hidden Power Ice targets Dragon- and Ground-types such as Dragonite, Hydreigon, and Landorus-T and can possibly OHKO non-specially defensive Garchomp and Mega Salamence.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Manectite allows Manectric to Mega Evolve into Mega Manectric, boosting its Speed and Special Attack along with granting it Intimidate. This is very useful when going against a physical attacker. Lightning Rod gives Manectric immunity to Electric-type moves, allowing it to switch into a predicted Electric-type move and gain a boost in Special Attack. This allows Manectric to OHKO threats such as Mega Salamence and Garchomp after Mega Evolving. A Timid nature is used to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon before mega evolution, along with Talonflame and Greninja after mega evolution. It also lets Mega Manectric Speed tie with Mega Lopunny. A Modest nature can be used for more damage; it gives Mega Manectric a higher chance to OHKO uninvested Mega Salamence and Garchomp than a Timid nature does. Hidden Power Ice 2HKOes Hydreigon with a Modest nature, while Timid loses the guaranteed 2HKO. As a cost of using Modest nature, Mega Manectric will lose out on its chance to outspeed Mega Gengar, Mega Salamence, Mega Blaziken, and Greninja, so Timid nature is often preferred. The remaining EVs are invested in Special Defense to prevent Porygon2 and Porygon-Z from getting an increase in Special Attack from their ability, Download.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Manectric is better off as a lead Pokemon because of its Speed and access to Volt Switch. This allows it to hit-and-run against powerful threats that can easily KO it. Also, it can assist with breaking any Focus Sash the foe might hold. It should be noted that Manectric should always Mega Evolve as soon as it is out on the field to take advantage of Mega Manectric's increased base stats. Do not switch Mega Manectric in continuously while entry hazards are out on the field because it lacks recovery and its bulk isn't very good. Do not keep Mega Manectric in on special walls because it's a wasted effort, as it can't KO Pokemon such as Chansey and Cresselia. Remember that when Manectric Mega Evolves into Mega Manectric, it doesn't get a huge boost in bulk; it is still frail, so it should avoid getting hit by any attack in general. Even though Mega Manectric can work great as a lead, it needs to watch out for common leads such as Garchomp; Garchomp's Earthquake can still OHKO Mega Manectric even after Intimidate, and although it has Hidden Power Ice to hit Garchomp for a lot of damage, the latter often carries a Focus Sash and will survive the attack anyway.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gyarados is a great partner because it can switch in from Mega Manectric and get an extra Intimidate off on physical attackers. Gyarados's Flying typing gives it immunity to Ground-type moves and provides resistance to Bug-, Fighting-, Fire-, and Water-type moves. Despite having a 4x weakness to Electric-type moves, Mega Manectric can switch in on a predicted Electric move and get a boost in Special Attack from Lightning Rod before Mega Evolving. Landorus-T is immune to any Ground-type move and can act as a double Intimidate user to soften attacks. It can also help form a VoltTurn core as well. Latios and Latias are both immune to Ground-type attacks because of Levitate. Latios can use a Choice Scarf to outspeed Choice Scarf Garchomp and OHKO it with its Dragon-type STAB moves. Talonflame can assist in getting rid of Fighting-types with its STAB Flying-type moves. It also has access to Will-O-Wisp for punishing physical attackers, which can be combined with Mega Manectric's Intimidate. Also, they both can form a VoltTurn core, just like with Landorus-T. Dragonite can be used to set up Dragon Dance on physical attackers after an Intimidate from Mega Manectric. Hydreigon is immune to Cresselia's Psychic attacks and resists Aegislash's Shadow Ball, and can hit both of these Pokemon hard with Dark Pulse.</p>"

  "Glalie": {
    "overview": "<p>Glalie finds a niche for itself in Battle Spot Singles with two very important traits in its ability Moody and access to Sheer Cold, an OHKO move no type is immune to. Glalie is able to effectively take advantage of Moody to gain boosts to all of its stats, making it faster, bulkier, more evasive, and more powerful. Additionally, it can fall back on Sheer Cold to get rid of almost every single Pokemon in the metagame. While Glalie's stats may be mediocre, they are just high enough to get by; for example, it is just fast enough to set up Substitutes in front of Pokemon like Dragonite, Cresselia, Suicune, Rotom-W, and Venusaur, and it only needs a +1 boost to its Speed to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame bar Mega Alakazam and Mega Aerodactyl. This means that, with a bit of luck, Glalie can fish for Moody boosts against almost anything. Glalie is also fantastic against stall or defensively oriented teams. Since those teams are typically slower, Glalie does not have to rely on lucky boosts to its Speed and can immediately become a threat. However, Glalie's Ice typing leaves it with no useful resistances and with many weaknesses to common offensive types, such as Fighting, Fire, and Rock. This means that unless it is behind a Substitute, Glalie is quite vulnerable to being KOed. Most notably, Glalie is weak to several common priority moves such as Bullet Punch, Mach Punch, and Vacuum Wave, all of which have common users such as Scizor, Breloom, and Lucario. This means that even if Glalie has Speed boosts, it can easily be picked off by these moves. Moody can also be incredibly unreliable, as Speed and defensive drops can spell doom for Glalie, and it doesn't benefit at all from an Attack or accuracy boost. Sometimes, Glalie will lose simply because it just got the wrong boosts, and there's nothing you can do about that. However, if luck is on your side, Glalie can beat almost anything.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Glalie does not have an extensive list of moves to use outside of the main set; however, there are a few with niche uses. Earthquake in combination with a Jolly nature can be used to get past Heatran without relying on Sheer Cold. Swagger can be used against special attackers to help gain free turns to get Substitutes up; this can be paired with support from Ditto to take advantage of the Attack boost against physical attackers. Icy Wind allows Glalie to outspeed faster Pokemon without having to rely on Moody to increase its Speed and is another way to ease the process of getting Substitutes set up. Disable can make a foe's most effective move against Glalie unusable. Spite helps stall out the foe's PP, potentially leaving it with no useful moves to use against Glalie at all.</p> <p>Mega Glalie may seem like an interesting option with its Refrigerate ability and access to Return and Explosion; however, its Ice typing combined with low bulk and mediocre base Speed leave it extremely vulnerable to common Pokemon such as Blaziken, Talonflame, Aegislash, and Mega Mawile, and it is 2HKOed by almost the entire metagame. This means that Mega Glalie needs excessive team support to work and not waste a Mega Evolution slot. If you want to try it, Return, Explosion, Earthquake, and Ice Shard is the best moveset.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan: Mega Kangaskhan is able to break through Glalie's Substitutes and easily knock it out due to its ability, Parental Bond; it is especially threatening with Power-Up Punch, which simultaneously busts through the Substitutes and boosts Mega Kangaskhan's Attack.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame</strong>: Flare Blitz hits Glalie for super effective damage and easily KOes it. Brave Bird, which has priority thanks to Gale Wings, can be used if Glalie has boosts to its Speed stat to hit it before it gets a Substitute up. Talonflame can also carry Taunt to prevent Glalie from using Protect and Substitute in the first place.</p> <p><strong>Blaziken</strong>: Glalie is weak to both of Blaziken's STAB moves, and Blaziken's Speed Boost ability lets it steadily gain Speed, while Glalie needs to be lucky with Moody. Mega Blaziken is also faster than Glalie; thus, Glalie will always be outsped by Mega Blaziken if it has the same number of (or more) boosts to its Speed. It can also use the predictable Protect turns to set up with Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Glalie struggles against most Fire-types, as they resist its Frost Breath and can retaliate with their STAB moves, often resulting in a KO even if Glalie has defensive boosts due to its low natural bulk. These threats include Heatran, which 4x resists Frost Breath and often has Substitute to help against Sheer Cold; Mega Charizard X, which can use Flame Charge to break Glalie's Substitutes while simultaneously boosting its Speed; Volcarona, which can use the predictable Protect turns to set up with Quiver Dance and bypass Glalie's Substitutes with Bug Buzz or break them with its Fire STAB moves; and Infiltrator Chandelure, which bypasses Glalie's Substitutes no matter what.</p> <p><strong>Gengar: Shadow Tag lets Mega Gengar trap Glalie and allows it to cripple Glalie with Taunt or remove it with Destiny Bond or Perish Song. Gengar also commonly carries Focus Blast, which hits Glalie extremely hard, or Substitute, which protects it from Sheer Cold.</p> <p><strong>Hyper Voice: Hyper Voice bypasses Glalie's Substitutes and can hit for massive damage. Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir are the two most common users, and their naturally high Special Defense helps them easily survive Frost Breath. Mega Salamence is the only other common user of the move, but it can't survive a Frost Breath.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash: Aegislash resists Frost Breath and can stall out Sheer Cold's PP with King's Shield. It can also carry Substitute itself to protect it from potential hits from Sheer Cold or go on the offensive with Sacred Sword, which hits Glalie super effectively and ignores evasion and defensive boosts.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit Attacks</strong>: Mega Heracross's ability, Skill Link, combined with Rock Blast allows it to break Glalie's Substitutes and continue doing damage, OHKOing Glalie unless it has defensive boosts. Breloom can use Bullet Seed to break Glalie's Substitute and provide enough damage afterwards to follow up with a KO from Mach Punch. Cloyster can use Glalie to set up a Shell Smash and proceed to KO it with Rock Blast.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Priority: Glalie's Ice typing leaves it weak to common priority moves such as Mach Punch, Bullet Punch, and Vacuum Wave, which means Pokemon such as Breloom, Conkeldurr, Lucario, Scizor, and Mega Metagross can hit Glalie before it gets to set up a Substitute, either KOing it or putting its HP too low to even use Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Phazing: Roar and Whirlwind ignore Protect and Substitute, so they can force Glalie out and rid it of its boosts without fail. Glalie is not built to come into the battle multiple times and often requires sacrificing a teammate to get it in, so phazing it can really mess it up. Common users of such moves include Skarmory, Swampert, Suicune, and Hippowdon.</p>",

        "name": "Welcome to Crystal Lake (Moody Booster)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Protect and Substitute are used in combination in order to gain as many Moody boosts as possible. Protect nets Glalie guaranteed Moody boosts and Leftovers recovery, whereas Substitute takes away 25% of Glalie's HP in order to let it avoid powerful attacks or status moves. Sheer Cold allows Glalie to OHKO any Pokemon in the metagame other than Sturdy users, such as Skarmory. However, Sheer Cold's low PP means it is prone to running out if you are unlucky, so a secondary offensive option is necessary. Frost Breath is fantastic due to its 100% critical hit chance, effectively giving Glalie a 90 Base Power STAB move that also ignores potential Special Attack drops and ignores its foe's defensive boosts. This means that if Glalie is unlucky and keeps lowering its Special Attack, Frost Breath will not lose power, and that Calm Mind users, such as Clefable and Raikou, do not take reduced damage from it. Freeze-Dry can be used as an alternative to Frost Breath to hit Water-types such as Suicune, Azumarill, Rotom-W, and Greninja super effectively, and it even hits Gyarados, Swampert, and Quagsire for 4x damage. However, all these Pokemon fear Sheer Cold, and Frost Breath is generally better, especially for hitting Skarmory.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>172 EVs in HP maximize the amount of HP Glalie gets from its Leftovers and minimizes the HP lost from setting up a Substitute. Maximum Speed investment is used together with a Timid nature to make Glalie as fast as possible, which is important for setting Substitutes up in front of as many foes as possible; the increased Speed also means that Glalie needs fewer boosts to outspeed the entire metagame. Notably, Glalie can outspeed Pokemon like Dragonite, Suicune, Cresselia, and Venusaur when unboosted and, with a boost, faster threats like Mega Gengar and Greninja. The remaining 84 EVs are put into Special Defense to pump up Glalie's resilience to Hyper Voice from the likes of Sylveon and Gardevoir. Moody is used for its stat-boosting properties, and Leftovers is chosen to extend Glalie's lifespan by providing passive recovery.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Glalie should absolutely not be switched into attacks, as it is too frail and needs as much health as it can get. Instead, Glalie should be brought in after one of your Pokemon has been KOed, preferably after the foe has been sufficiently crippled with status or weakened with stat-reducing moves. This helps Glalie set up Substitutes because of the foe being too weak to break them, being unable to attack due to a status ailment, or having to switch out to a check. A Glalie behind an intact Substitute is dangerous, so getting one up and maintaining safety behind one is imperative to Glalie's success. If you're faced with a faster Pokemon such as Garchomp or Greninja and Glalie already has a Substitute set up, you should expect it to be broken and use Substitute again. Alternate between doing that and using Protect until Glalie is faster than the foe, and then you can use Glalie's Speed advantage to attack before its Substitute gets broken and replace Substitutes before being attacked again. Hopefully, Glalie should accrue enough defensive or evasion boosts that it can avoid having its Substitutes broken every turn, giving it chances to attack. Sheer Cold's PP should be preserved for when it is absolutely needed, so use Frost Breath to attack until faced with a dangerous Pokemon, such as Suicune, Cresselia, Porygon2, Heatran, or Tyranitar, and hope that Sheer Cold lands on them. If your opponent brings in a Pokemon that threatens Glalie but it is behind a Substitute, use the opportunity to fish for a Sheer Cold hit before the foe breaks the Substitute, rather than immediately switch out.</p> <p>Glalie struggles against fast heavy offense teams, as it cannot get Substitutes up reliably without taking hard hits. If you see at Team Preview that your opponent has a team stacked with heavy hitters, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Blaziken, Thundurus, Garchomp, and Mega Salamence, don't be afraid to leave Glalie out of the battle entirely. This also means that your team cannot be overly reliant on Glalie.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Glalie thrives with Thunder Wave support, as the decreased Speed of the foe and free turns that full paralysis can provide make setting up Substitutes far easier. Thundurus is Glalie's most common teammate for this reason, as its priority Thunder Wave allows it to cripple even the fastest of Pokemon, such as Greninja, Serperior, and Mega Salamence. There are many other great paralysis inducers including Serperior, Klefki, Chansey, Cresselia, Rotom-W, and Zapdos.</p> <p>Physically defensive checks to Pokemon like Mega Kangaskhan, Talonflame, and Blaziken are crucial for Glalie's success. Thundurus again is valuable here, though Pokemon such as Suicune, Mega Slowbro, Cresselia, Rotom-W, and Zapdos can all be used. Sylveon is a massive threat because of Hyper Voice being able to hit through Glalie's Substitutes; Mega Gengar is able to trap Sylveon and KO it with Sludge Bomb if it's taken some prior damage or take it down with Destiny Bond. Aegislash can take Hyper Voice relatively well and KO Sylveon with Iron Head or Flash Cannon, while Chansey can tank any move except Psyshock and whittle Sylveon down with Toxic. Specially defensive Talonflame is a great partner for Glalie, being able to beat Blaziken, Volcarona, and Heracross and wall Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir. Mega Kangaskhan is the preferred Mega Evolution to use with Glalie, as it provides a reliable backup when Moody doesn't work in your favor and also provides a lot of pressure at Team Preview, forcing your opponent to bring defensive checks to it that Glalie can set up on, such as Ferrothorn and Cresselia. Mega Salamence is also a fine option, being able to threaten Blaziken, Heracross, and Volcarona lacking Hidden Power Ice; Intimidate also provides valuable support for Glalie. Because Glalie can be used as setup fodder with its predictable alternation of Protect and Substitute, an Unaware user such as Clefable can work as a check to opposing sweepers. Ditto can also be used to take advantage of the foes' stat boosts if they manage to break through Glalie.</p>"

  "Salamence": {
    "overview": "<p>Sweeping in from the skies, Mega Salamence shows massive improvement over its base forme! The biggest factor in Mega Salamence's rise to stardom is its excellent ability, Aerilate, which gives it a powerful 30% boosted Flying-type STAB move when using Double-Edge, Return, or Hyper Voice. Mega Salamence has an excellent stat distribution as well, being extremely fast and powerful, and thanks to its great Defense stat and its non-Mega ability Intimidate, Mega Salamence actually takes physical hits better than notable walls such as Skarmory! Finally, Mega Salamence's movepool perfectly complements its offenses, as it has access to great coverage moves such as Earthquake and Fire Blast and useful non-attacking moves such as Dragon Dance, which turns Mega Salamence into a dangerous sweeper that can bust through weakened walls, and Roost, which gives Mega Salamence effective staying power.</p> <p>Mega Salamence may be an extremely dangerous Pokemon, but it is also very well prepared for in Battle Spot Singles. Along with a 4x weakness to Ice, which is exploited by popular offensive Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Greninja and defensive Ice Beam users such as Suicune, Porygon2, and Cresselia, Mega Salamence is also easily worn down by the common Rocky Helmet and Double-Edge recoil. Furthermore, there are other powerful Mega Pokemon that give Salamence serious competition, such as Kangaskhan, Gengar, Blaziken, and Charizard, which makes Mega Salamence lose some of its appeal. Overall, Mega Salamence is an extremely dangerous Pokemon, but it will need adequate team support in order to overcome its major problems.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thrash is a decent alternative to Double-Edge, losing the recoil but instead locking Salamence in. Moxie can be used to let Salamence get a free Attack boost before it Mega Evolves, but Intimidate is usually better for giving Mega Salamence more setup opportunities. Finally, a set with Choice Scarf and Moxie makes Salamence a unique revenge killer, but it has severe problems with Fairy-types, making other revenge killers a better choice most of the time.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Defensive Ice-type Move Users: Porygon2, Cresselia, Zapdos (with Hidden Power Ice), Suicune, and Mega Slowbro all survive a +1 Double-Edge and can severely damage Mega Salamence with Ice Beam. However, those that don't run Rest must be wary of the Toxic set.</p> <p><strong>Fast Special Attackers: Greninja, Mega Manectric, and, if Mega Salamence hasn't Mega Evolved yet or has an Adamant nature, Latios can all revenge kill Mega Salamence before it sets up Dragon Dance. Focus Sash Greninja in particular can even revenge kill a boosted Mega Salamence!</p> <p><strong>Mamoswine: Mamoswine gets hit hard by Mega Salamence's STAB attacks, but it can easily pick off a weakened Mega Salamence with Ice Shard. Choice Scarf sets can outright outspeed and OHKO Mega Salamence with Icicle Spear, which not even Substitute can save it from.</p> <p><strong>Weavile</strong>: Weavile can't take a hit from any of Mega Salamence's attacks, but it outspeeds Mega Salamence and can OHKO it with Icicle Crash, and it can revenge kill weakened boosted ones with Ice Shard as well.</p> <p><strong>Mega Mawile</strong>: Mawile takes a ton of damage from Earthquake and Fire Blast, but it can use Intimidate to switch in on a setup move or Double-Edge and OHKO with Play Rough after Mega Evolving.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp: Most Will-O-Wisp users, such as Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Mega Sableye, take a huge amount of damage from boosted attacks but can cripple Mega Salamence if it isn't carrying Facade or Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Thundurus and Klefki: Even bulky Thundurus and Klefki take a lot of damage from Mega Salamence, but they can use their priority Thunder Wave to stop a Mega Salamence sweep, and both happen to resist its main STAB attack.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Double-Edge is Mega Salamence's 156-Base Power STAB move, seriously wounding any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Dragon Dance turns Mega Salamence into a ferocious sweeper, boosting the power of its Double-Edge to astronomical levels and allowing it to outspeed even Choice Scarf Garchomp. Earthquake is the perfect coverage move for Double-Edge, hitting Steel-, Rock-, and Electric-types that resist Double-Edge, mainly Aegislash, Tyranitar, and Raikou.</p> <p>The last slot can be a bit tricky to choose, as Mega Salamence has plenty of viable options. Roost takes advantage of Mega Salamence's excellent Defense, giving it more chances to set up a sweep later by healing Double-Edge's recoil and other residual damage. If you're more worried about status, Substitute can protect Mega Salamence from getting its sweep ruined by Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp users such as Thundurus, Klefki, and Rotom-W. Substitute even blocks stat drops, which is great against Intimidate and Rock Tomb users. Facade lets Mega Salamence sweep after getting hit by Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Mega Sableye.</p> <p>On the more offensive end, Fire Blast can be used to hit Steel-types that aren't weak to Earthquake, such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Scizor. Flamethrower is also a reasonable choice if you prefer accuracy over power, but note that it misses out on OHKOing Mega Scizor and Skarmory won't be in KO range after Double-Edge. If you're more worried about physical walls in general, Draco Meteor is a great option for slamming Hippowdon and defensive Mega Charizard X. If you especially have problems with Zapdos, Mega Salamence can even use Outrage, which 2HKOes Zapdos and OHKOes Dragonite after a Dragon Dance. Finally, if Double-Edge's recoil damage is undesirable, Return is a fine option. Just note, if you opt to use Return over Double-Edge, that Return loses a significant number of KOs compared to Double-Edge.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mega Salamence uses a simple physical attacking spread, maximizing Attack and Speed for the best sweeping capability. The choice of nature is trickier. Adamant Mega Salamence has an easier time grabbing KOs with an extra powerful Double-Edge, most notably getting a potential OHKO on Azumarill and a 2HKO on Suicune, while still outspeeding important Pokemon such as Garchomp. However, if you are willing to sacrifice the extra power, Jolly becomes a reasonable alternative, allowing Mega Salamence to outspeed potential revenge killers such as Raikou, Thundurus, and Latios. Finally, if you are running Fire Blast or Draco Meteor, a Naughty or Naive nature is preferred, as Mega Salamence's physical bulk is too good to sacrifice.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It may be tempting to set up Dragon Dance right away, but this will usually only result in Mega Salamence getting KOed early. It's best to use Dragon Dance later in the game, when checks such as Suicune, Porygon2, and Cresselia are in KO range of a boosted Double-Edge and when Mamoswine in particular is taken out, as it threatens Mega Salamence with its priority Ice Shard. Once you feel that Mega Salamence is primed for sweeping, you'll need to find a low-risk Pokemon to set up on. Good targets include physical attackers such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Mega Blaziken, as well as Choice item users locked into moves Mega Salamence resists or is immune to, such as Garchomp locked into Earthquake and Azumarill locked into Waterfall.</p> <p>When Salamence is primed to attack, you'll usually want to Mega Evolve it. However, Mega Evolution isn't always needed as soon as possible, because of non-Mega Salamence's ability Intimidate, which can save your team from getting swept. Therefore, keeping Salamence in its base forme is a great idea if you plan on double switching Salamence, especially if Stealth Rock is off the field.</p> <p>Finally, while Mega Salamence is an incredibly dangerous Pokemon, it also has bad matchups against prominent defensive Pokemon such as Suicune, Porygon2, and Cresselia. If you feel like the opponent's team is too well guarded against Mega Salamence, feel free to bench it for that match.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Salamence is very vulnerable to common walls such as Suicune, Porygon2, Cresselia, Zapdos, Hippowdon, and—if lacking a Fire-type attack—Skarmory, so using teammates that threaten defensive foes is a good idea. Substitute + Toxic Aegislash is a great Porygon2 lure that deals with Cresselia and happens to resist all of Mega Salamence's weaknesses. Quiver Dance Volcarona, Calm Mind Raikou, and Calm Mind Sylveon are special sweepers that defeat a lot of physical walls that trouble Mega Salamence. Serperior may share Mega Salamence's weakness to Ice, but it puts a great deal of offensive pressure on Hippowdon and Suicune. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Hippowdon, Tyranitar, and Swampert can also wear down these defensive threats, putting them in 2HKO range of Mega Salamence's Double-Edge.</p> <p>Offensively, Mamoswine, Greninja, and Weavile are massive problems for Mega Salamence due to their fast Ice-type STAB attacks. Porygon2 does a great job of handling Greninja and Mamoswine as long as it avoids Knock Off, while Blaziken can switch into predicted Ice-type attacks and slam their users with its Fighting-type STAB moves. Conkeldurr also does a good job of forcing these Pokemon out due to its decent bulk and STAB Drain Punch and Mach Punch.</p> <p>Because Mega Salamence may have to be benched more than you like, consider a backup Mega Pokemon that can handle Pokemon that trouble Mega Salamence. Mega Gengar is an excellent example, using Shadow Tag and moves like Taunt and Destiny Bond to take care of common walls. Mega Tyranitar's excellent bulk and interesting typing give it an edge over Cresselia, Porygon2, and Zapdos, and it can even use Taunt to cripple them further. Mega Venusaur is immune to Toxic and can take Ice Beams fairly well, and it can potentially outstall threats with Leech Seed or put foes to sleep with Sleep Powder.</p>"

        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Mega Salamence's good base 120 Special Attack is perfect for catching physical walls off guard. Draco Meteor is Mega Salamence's main attack, dealing a ton of damage to common physically defensive switch-ins such as Hippowdon, which is put in the KO range of Double-Edge after this, Zapdos, Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and bulky Thundurus. Fire Blast takes care of Steel-types, roasting Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Skarmory and 2HKOing Aegislash and Mega Mawile. Flamethrower can be used for better accuracy, but note that Mega Salamence loses the 2HKO on Aegislash and the chance to OHKO Skarmory. Double-Edge still deals plenty of damage even without Attack investment, allowing Mega Salamence to be an offensive force even after Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop. Double-Edge also ensures that Azumarill and Sylveon won't wall Mega Salamence.</p> <p>The last moveslot can contain a variety of moves. Earthquake smashes Heatran and prevents Raikou from setting up on Mega Salamence after Draco Meteor is used. Roost sacrifices coverage for more staying power, which is especially useful if your opponent sets up Stealth Rock. Hyper Voice is a low-risk STAB move that has the awesome bonus of hitting through the Substitute of prominent Pokemon such as Gliscor. Finally, Stone Edge gives Mega Salamence a chance at KOing Zapdos after a hit from Draco Meteor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mega Salamence should focus on maximizing its Special Attack and Speed so it can have the best possible offensive presence. Mega Salamence's nature should be either Naive or Rash because lowering Mega Salamence's only acceptable Special Defense is better than lowering its fantastic Defense. Naive gets Mega Salamence the Speed boost it needs to outspeed Raikou, Adamant Mega Salamence, and Latios, all threats Mega Salamence likes to damage. On the other hand, Rash makes Draco Meteor even more powerful.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The early-game is when Mega Salamence often does its best. Use Draco Meteor and Fire Blast to hit unsuspecting walls, potentially letting you gain control of the match early. Hyper Voice may seem like a good move to use early-game, but it reveals your surprise early without a big hit, so only do this against more offensive teams or in the mid-game. If you see Fairy-types on your opponent's team, consider using Double-Edge as you predict them to switch in, or use Fire Blast to grab an OHKO on Mawile switch-ins.</p> <p>This Mega Salamence focuses far more on opening up holes for your sweepers than attempting to sweep the opposing team as a whole. Because of this, feel free to sacrifice Mega Salamence once it has done its job. Also note that its base forme can get great mileage out of Intimidate before Mega Evolving. Non-Mega Salamence has base 110 Special Attack as well, so if your opponent's remaining Pokemon are slower than Salamence, feel free to pick them off with Salamence before Mega Evolving if you feel that Intimidate still has some utility.</p> <p>While this Mega Salamence set focuses on breaking down walls that sweeper sets have trouble with, Porygon2 and Cresselia are still huge problems for this set, so feel free to bench Mega Salamence if Team Preview isn't looking healthy for Mega Salamence.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock support from bulky users such as Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Swampert is highly recommended, as with Stealth Rock set, the switches Mega Salamence forces will create even more offensive pressure on the opposing team.</p> <p>Because Mega Salamence is all about opening up new sweeping opportunities, it's best to pair it with sweepers such as Scizor, Tyranitar, Gyarados, Blaziken, and Talonflame, which like physical walls such as Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Zapdos weakened or KOed.</p> <p>Note that some walls such as Cresselia and Porygon2 can still tank Mega Salamence's attacks, so preparing for them is a good idea. Substitute + Toxic Aegislash is a great partner, as it deals with Cresselia and makes for an excellent Porygon2 lure. Dragon Dance or Taunt Tyranitar can be a huge pain for them, and neither of them likes dealing with Swords Dance Scizor with Roost or Knock Off. Ferrothorn is a nice, bulky alternative that can support Mega Salamence with Leech Seed and Thunder Wave, especially if it manages to paralyze mixed Blaziken or Mega Lopunny.</p>"

        "name": "SubRoost",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This set is based around using Mega Salamence's good bulk to surprise its usual checks. Toxic does a great job of crippling common defensive switch-ins such as Cresselia, Porygon2, Zapdos, and Hippowdon, and it also forces Suicune and Rotom-W to use Rest earlier than they want to. Substitute is important to prevent Salamence from getting crippled by status moves and makes Mega Salamence much harder to revenge kill in general. Roost gives Mega Salamence much-needed staying power and reduces its 4x Ice-type weakness to 2x on the turn it's used, giving Mega Salamence the potential to outstall Porygon2, Cresselia, and Zapdos!</p> <p>The last slot is for Mega Salamence's offensive option. Double-Edge may seem like an odd move to use on a more defensive set due to the recoil, but it still packs a good punch thanks to its high Base Power and this Mega Salamence is less vulnerable to recoil thanks to Roost; however, if you're still worried about the recoil, Return is a reasonable alternative, exchanging brute force for even more staying power.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mega Salamence will usually want maximum HP investment to take Ice Beams and physical attacks. Maximum Speed with a Jolly nature allows Mega Salamence to outspeed Raikou, which often carries Hidden Power Ice, and at least Speed tie with opposing Mega Salamence.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against teams that have obvious Salamence checks that you'll want to lure out, you'll usually want to use Substitute against threats Mega Salamence scares out, such as Mega Blaziken, Choice-locked Ground-types, and Grass-types. This keeps the rest of the set shrouded in mystery, giving Mega Salamence a better chance to Toxic its targets.</p> <p>When facing certain status targets such as Porygon2 and Cresselia, you'll be faced with a bit of a mind game if you want to stall them for more damage: whether to use Substitute against their status moves or Roost against their Ice-type attacks. It can be risky, but stalling them with Toxic damage can open up holes for sweepers. Regardless of the risk, this Salamence set is built to last, so only sacrifice it when it could open up the potential for a sweep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because this Mega Salamence is a great lure, using Pokemon that appreciate walls such as Porygon2 and Cresselia being taken care of is highly recommended. Great teammates to consider include Greninja, Swords Dance Talonflame, physical Blaziken, Sand Rush Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Azumarill.</p> <p>Because Flying-type attacks are Mega Salamence's only means of attacking, Steel-types such as Mega Mawile, Heatran, Skarmory, and Klefki are far bigger problems than usual. Additionally, the bigger focus on defense means that Sylveon and Azumarill present more problems than usual. Finally, Suicune is still fully capable of walling Mega Salamence with Rest. Mamoswine is an excellent teammate against Mega Mawile, Klefki, and Heatran and appreciates Porygon2 and Cresselia being crippled. Excadrill provides similar benefits but also has a STAB Iron Head to take out Sylveon. Gliscor also does fairly well against Klefki and Mega Mawile and outspeeds Heatran; however, Fire-type attacks do plenty of damage to it. A Heatran of your own does a great job of taking care of most Steel-types as well. Rotom-W does a great job against Heatran and Azumarill and can use Will-O-Wisp to cripple Mega Mawile in emergencies. If you aren't as concerned about Azumarill and Suicune, Rotom-H does an admirable job as well, taking care of Mega Mawile and more safely being able to Trick Sylveon a Choice Scarf. Finally, if you are especially worried about Suicune, Pokemon such as Calm Mind Raikou, Serperior, and Breloom are good teammates.</p>"

  "Metagross": {
    "overview": "<p>With a new set of arms, Mega Metagross makes its way to Battle Spot Singles, capable of punching holes in the metagame. Mega Metagross shows off its majestic Attack stat coupled with an excellent offensive movepool containing a plethora of solid options to run such as Zen Headbutt, Earthquake, Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, Grass Knot, and Hammer Arm by checking and countering many threats in the metagame such as Mega Gardevoir, Mega Altaria, Mega Heracross, Mega Lopunny, and Heatran. Its ability, Tough Claws, boosts the power of all of its contact moves by 30%, making its attacks hit harder and get potential KOs. Its base 110 Speed stat allows it to outspeed Garchomp and base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Zapdos, and its bulk and typing allow it to take several hits from physical and special attackers, granting it plenty of opportunities to switch in. For example, it helps check Fairy- and Ice-types such as Sylveon and Glalie, which makes it a good partner for Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Hydreigon.</p> <p>Despite its positive traits, Mega Metagross has trouble against Pokemon such as Bisharp, Mega Blaziken, Aegislash, Mega Mawile, and Suicune because of the advantages they hold such as their powerful STAB attacks along with their coverage moves. Before Mega Evolving, Metagross has to deal with its lackluster Speed and will surely get hit by an attack before being able to outspeed the opposing Pokemon. Because it lacks reliable recovery Mega Metagross has a difficult time breaking past defensive status users such as Mega Sableye, Slowbro, Rotom-W, Cresselia, and anything with Scald. Mega Metagross Steel / Psychic STAB moves isn't all that great either besides hitting Fairy-, Fighting-, Ice-, and Poison-types such as Sylveon, Conkeldurr, Mamoswine, and Gengar. Nonetheless, Mega Metagross is able to hold its own in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Protect can be used to ensure Mega Metagross is not outsped when it Mega Evolves and scout the foe's moves and potential Choice item. Thunder Punch hits Water- and Flying-types such as Suicune, Azumarill, Gyarados, and Talonflame. Grass Knot gets a boost from Tough Claws and targets Ground- and Water-types such as Mega Swampert and Quagsire. Pursuit can surprise threats that tend to switch out such as Latios. Agility can be used with an Adamant nature to outspeed Choice Scarf Pokemon. No Speed would need to be invested in such a set, and instead 252 EVs can be put into both HP and Attack. Explosion is a last-resort option to KO the threat if Mega Metagross has no way of beating it. Rock Slide can be used to hit notable checks on the switch such as Charizard, Talonflame, and Volcarona. Power-Up Punch can be used to get a boost Mega Metagross's Attack; however, offensive moves such as Hammer Arm are generally better options than setting up, not to mention Power-Up Punch is usually outclassed by Hone Claws because it doesn't offer any boost in accuracy for Zen Headbutt and Meteor Mash, while Mega Metagross could get hurt from setting up against Rocky Helmet / Rough Skin / Iron Barbs users such as Cresselia, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn. Assault Vest gives Metagross extra bulk in Special Defense and lets it act as a tank. A Substitute + 3 attacks set with Zen Headbutt, Meteor Mash, and Earthquake or Hammer Arm can be used in order to avoid status moves while attacking behind a Substitute. Toxic deserves a special mention in order to wear down bulky walls such as Cresselia, which would otherwise comfortably wall Metagross with reliable recovery + Rocky Helmet damage.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is useful for hitting threats harder. This nature can be used in conjunction with other Pokemon on Mega Metagross's team if they carry Icy Wind, Rock Tomb, or even Thunder Wave. It would also allow for Mega Metagross to get some possible KOs that it normally wouldn't such as on Hydreigon and Mega Kangaskhan; however, Mega Metagross will lose out on its ability to outspeed base 100s. When you're running an Adamant nature, 124 EVs in HP can allow Mega Metagross to survive an Earthquake from Adamant Landorus-T, while putting the rest in Speed will allow Mega Metagross to Speed tie with neutral-natured base 95 Pokemon. You can even run max HP and max Attack if you find outspeeding those isn't worthwhile.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Mega Metagross has a lot of trouble against the most threatening Fire-types in the metagame. Notable Pokemon include Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Mega Blaziken, Talonflame, and Rotom-H. Both Mega Charizard X and Blaziken can OHKO Mega Metagross with Flare Blitz, and Mega Blaziken can even outspeed Mega Metagross with Speed Boost after using Protect. Mega Charizard Y's Fire moves get a boost from Drought, allowing it to KO Mega Metagross with any of its strong Fire attacks. Talonflame can cripple Mega Metagross with Will-O-Wisp while stalling with Roost. Rotom-H can easily get rid of Mega Metagross with Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Dark- and Ghost-types: Mega Sableye can burn Mega Metagross with Will-O-Wisp, neutering its physical attacking capabilities. Mega Sableye can then proceed to set up with Calm Mind while replenishing itself with Recover and KO Mega Metagross with its Dark-type STAB attacks. Aegislash can gain a boost in Attack and Special Attack from Weakness Policy from Mega Metagross's Earthquake and KO it with Shadow Ball. Mega Gengar outspeeds Mega Metagross and can OHKO it with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Hippowdon carries Rocky Helmet, which, because the majority of Mega Metagross's moves make contact, helps wear Mega Metagross down. Additionally, Ice Punch only 3HKOes Hippowdon, while Earthquake 2HKOes Mega Metagross with Rocky Helmet. Hippowdon can also use Slack Off to recover any lost health. Choice Scarf Garchomp 2HKOes Mega Metagross with Earthquake and has the ability Rough Skin, which will give out residual damage. Landorus-T can come into Mega Metagross and lower its Attack with Intimidate. It can outspeed with Choice Scarf and has a chance to OHKO with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Burn and Paralysis: Mega Metagross is vulnerable to burn and paralysis. Burns will decrease its Attack, making its moves completely useless. Paralysis ruins Mega Metagross's Speed with an additional chance to immobilize it. Notable status users that would give Mega Metagross trouble are Mega Sableye, Mega Gengar, Rotom-W, Rotom-H, Thundurus, and Cresselia.</p> <p><strong>Cresselia and Porygon2: Cresselia is able to easily wall Mega Metagross and paralyze it with Thunder Wave, ruining its Speed. It also commonly carries Rocky Helmet, which will deal passive damage after each hit Mega Metagross deals to it, and can recover any damage that's dealt to it with Moonlight; however, when Mega Metagross is behind a Substitute, Cresselia can't do much to it. Mega Metagross has no way of beating Porygon2 if it's an all-out attacker because many are physical walls and can take any hit. Porygon2 can also paralyze Mega Metagross with Thunder Wave. However, Substitute + Hone Claws allows Mega Metagross to deal with Porygon2 and Cresselia unless Porygon2 carries Foul Play or Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Mega Mawile</strong>: Mawile can switch in and decrease Mega Metagross's Attack with Intimidate, while Mega Metagross isn't able to OHKO Mega Mawile with any of its moves and needs to watch out for Sucker Punch when it's not at full health. If Bullet Punch is being used, however, Mega Metagross can play mind games with Mega Mawile because it outspeeds, and if Substitute is being used, Mega Metagross can bypass Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Gyarados can take Mega Metagross's attacks thanks to Intimidate, and regular Gyarados variants wear down Mega Metagross with Rocky Helmet and carry Thunder Wave. Suicune resists Mega Metagross's Steel-type STAB attacks and can burn it with Scald. The same goes for Mega Slowbro. Both of these Pokemon can use Mega Metagross to set up Calm Mind in order to deal more damage. However, Gyarados needs to be aware of Thunder Punch, while Suicune and Mega Slowbro needs to be wary of Grass Knot.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types such as Skarmory and Scizor can reliably check Metagross. Skarmory can use Whirlwind to prevent the Hone Claws set from setting up even through Substitute, while Scizor, especially the bulky Mega variants, takes almost nothing from Earthquake or Hammer Arm and threatens to set up and retaliate with powerful Bug-type STAB attack or Dark-type coverage move.</p>",

      {
        "name": "All-out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Zen Headbutt is Mega Metagross's STAB move, which allows it to hit Fighting- and Poison-types such as Blaziken, Mega Heracross, Breloom, Gengar, and Mega Venusaur. It is also Mega Metagross's strongest option against be used to hit Rotom-W. Bullet Punch lets Mega Metagross pick off weaker threats along with hitting Fairy- and Ice-types for super effective damage such as Mega Gardevoir and Weavile. Meteor Mash can be used over Bullet Punch to hit other threats for more damage. Despite the lack of perfect accuracy, the move still has high power. It is also helpful with the Tough Claws ability. Ice Punch has great coverage, dealing with Dragon-, Flying-, Grass-, and Ground-types such as Garchomp, Mega Salamence, Dragonite, Landorus-T, Thundurus, Zapdos, Serperior, and Gliscor. Earthquake gives Mega Metagross more coverage against Fire- and Steel-types such as Mega Charizard X, Heatran, Mega Lucario, Aegislash, and Excadrill. Hammer Arm allows Mega Metagross to hit Ferrothorn along with Dark-, Normal-, and Rock-types such as Hydreigon, Mega Kangaskhan, Chansey, and Tyranitar. Unfortunately, Hammer Arm decreases Mega Metagross's Speed after each use, putting it at a disadvantage against fast Pokemon that wouldn't outspeed it normally. Iron Head can be used instead of Bullet Punch or Meteor Mash because of its perfect accuracy and decent Base Power.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Metagrossite is the only item for Metagross to use because it gives a huge boost in power, bulk, and Speed, as well as Tough Claws to deal a little extra damage on foes through contact. Maximum Attack and Speed investment ensures that Mega Metagross can hit hard while outspeeding many threats in the metagame. A Jolly nature is preferred over Adamant because it allows Mega Metagross to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir, Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Zapdos, Jolly Mega Kangaskhan, and Jolly Garchomp. Clear Body prevents Mega Metagross's stats from being lowered before Mega Evolving. For example, the ability lets Metagross face off against Intimidate users such as Landorus-T, Mega Mawile, Mega Manectric, and Gyarados as well as switch into Icy Wind and Rock Tomb. If tying with base 100 Speed threats such as Gengar or Latios is unnecessary or unappealing, you can add some bulk over max Speed. 220 EVs allow Mega Metagross to outspeed base 105 threats such as Manectric, Lopunny, and Mega Pinsir after Mega Evolving, while 196 Speed is needed to outspeed Garchomp, if it's your only concern. 244 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed base 108 Speed Pokemon such as Infernape; however, it is uncommon. The rest of the EVs can be allocated to HP and Defense, which is particularly useful when you're dealing with Garchomp, as the combination of Earthquake + Rough Skin damage can KO Mega Metagross.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Metagross's primary job is to start attacking and forcing out various threats in the metagame such as Mega Salamence, Sylveon, Heatran, Gliscor, and Conkeldurr. If you're planning on using Mega Metagross early-game as a lead, make sure your opponent doesn't have a lead that could hinder Metagross. It's also best for Mega Metagross to be on the lookout for potential Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and the uncommon Heatran. It's very crucial to watch out for Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave users such as Mega Sableye, Rotom-W, Rotom-H, Cresselia, and Thundurus, as Will-O-Wisp renders Mega Metagross's attacks useless and deals passive damage, while Thunder Wave ruins its Speed. It's better to almost always use Zen Headbutt and Bullet Punch or Meteor Mash because both moves hit many Pokemon hard that do not resist them, unless you're facing a Pokemon that is weak to Mega Metagross's coverage moves.</p> <p>Even though Mega Metagross is resistant against several types, don't switch it in repeatedly because it lacks reliable recovery; this means it can only be switched in a few times. Because Mega Metagross is holding Metagrossite, it can use that to its advantage to scout for Trick / Switcheroo users such as Rotom-W, Gothitelle, and Noivern. It's usually best to send Mega Metagross in on Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir because it resists their STAB moves. However, some Gardevoir carry Will-O-Wisp, which is capable of burning Metagross on the switch or prior to Mega Evolution. Try to Mega Evolve Metagross as soon as possible, as the Speed boost is crucial for outspeeding certain threats such as Garchomp and Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hydreigon and Mega Metagross have excellent synergy with each other, as Hydreigon can take on Dark-, Fire-, and Ghost-types while Mega Metagross can handle Dragon-, Fairy-, Fighting-, and Ice-types. Additionally, Hydreigon's ability Levitate gives it an immunity to Ground-type attacks, and it can eliminate Aegislash with Choice Specs Dark Pulse. Stallbreaker variants of Hydreigon can even provide Taunt or Thunder Wave support against defensive threats such as Cresselia and Porygon2 so that Mega Metagross has an easier time dealing with these bulky matchups. Togekiss is a viable teammate, as it can take down Dark-, Fighting-, and bulky Grass-types such as opposing Hydreigon, Breloom, Tangrowth, and Mega Venusaur, while Mega Metagross can switch into Ice-type attacks. Together, Mega Metagross, Togekiss, and Hydreigon can form a nice Steel / Fairy / Dragon core. Both Gyarados and Landorus-T can switch in and soften physical attacks for Mega Metagross with Intimidate. With a Ground immunity and Fire resistance, Gyarados can punish both types with its STAB Water-type moves. Landorus-T is able to punish Fire- and Steel-types with Earthquake. In return, Mega Metagross can sponge Rock- and Ice-type attacks for Gyarados and Landorus-T, respectively. Talonflame pairs well with Mega Metagross, as it can clean Aegislash off the field and burn physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Tyranitar resists Dark-, Fire-, and Ghost-type moves and can get rid of Mega Gengar with Pursuit if it switches out. However, it needs to watch for Focus Blast. Rotom-W and Rotom-H are immune to Ground and can burn physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp, while Mega Metagross can take Rock-type moves for Rotom-H and Grass-type moves for Rotom-W. Rotom-H also helps with eliminating Aegislash. Garchomp and Mamoswine can both switch into Electric-type moves, keeping Mega Metagross safe from Thunder Wave from Pokemon such as Thundurus. Conkeldurr makes a decent partner, being able to take on Dark-types such as Bisharp while not even fearing status thanks to Guts, so it can absorb Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave for Mega Metagross.</p>"
      },
      {
        "name": "Substitute + Hone Claws",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute prevents Mega Metagross from being hit by powerful attacks and helps it avoid status moves such as Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, and Leech Seed. Many expect Mega Metagross to run an all-out attacking set; this gives Mega Metagross the opportunity to set up Substitute on a predicted Sucker Punch from Pokemon such as Mega Mawile and Bisharp. Hone Claws raises Mega Metagross's Attack and accuracy by one stage. Using it in conjunction with Substitute also lets Mega Metagross set up for free against defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia, Ferrothorn, and Clefable. Earthquake is used to hit Fire-, Rock-, and Steel-types such as Heatran, Tyranitar, and Aegislash. The last moveslot is a toss-up between Zen Headbutt and Meteor Mash. Zen Headbutt can hit Poison- and Fighting-types such as Gengar and Breloom and has a chance to make the foe flinch, while Meteor Mash hits Mega Altaria, Sylveon, Clefable, Latios, Latias, and Cresselia. It notably OHKOes Latios at +1 and OHKOes Mega Kangaskhan at +2. With a Hone Claws boost under Mega Metagross's belt, both of these attacks will have perfect accuracy.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs give Mega Metagross more bulk to take hits better. This also ensures that Mega Metagross's Substitute doesn't break from weak attacks such as Breloom's Mach Punch. 252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Mega Metagross to outspeed non-Choice Scarf variants of Garchomp. There's no point in running any EVs in Attack for this set because it's necessary for Mega Metagross to outspeed as many foes as possible while having extra bulk to take hits. Clear Body allows Metagross to block any moves or abilities that would decrease its stats. 236 HP EVs can be used to keep Suicune from breaking Substitute with Scald. The remaining 20 EVs can be added to Attack to give Mega Metagross a little more damage output.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set helps with Mega Metagross's bulk, allowing it to have a safe turn behind a Substitute after a weak attack. It resists many attacks that don't break it's Substitute. Mega Metagross should set up Substitute on defensive Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Clefable, Cresselia, and Ferrothorn because they won't be able to break it. Notably, its Substitute can survive Scald from Suicune, Mach Punch from Breloom, and Ice Beam from Cresselia. Try to use Substitute on predicted status moves such as Leech Seed and Thunder Wave, Sucker Punches, or switches to either get a Hone Claws boost or to hit the opposing Pokemon for damage. For example, Mega Metagross can predict Aegislash to be switched in, which gives it the perfect time to set up Substitute. It can then proceed to spam Earthquake and 2HKO it while ignoring King's Shield. However, if Aegislash carries Weakness Policy, it 2HKOes Mega Metagross with Shadow Sneak. Set up Hone Claws as soon as Mega Metagross is behind a Substitute in order to prepare for a sweep. Also, it's very crucial that its checks and counters are gone for a safe switch in and setup. It's always best for Mega Metagross to switch in after its teammate has fainted, as it won't have to risk taking any damage. You have to be very careful when Mega Evolving Metagross because it'll still have its low base 70 Speed first turn, so switch it into slower Pokemon such as Cresselia, Sylveon, and Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hydreigon and Mega Metagross have amazing synergy and check each other's checks and counters. Serperior's Glare allows it to paralyze Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Excadrill, and it's able to deal with Hippowdon, Rhyperior, and Mamoswine for Mega Metagross. The more Pokemon Mega Metagross outspeeds, the more free turns it has to set up Substitute on a turn they're fully paralyzed. Serperior also helps by setting up dual screens and can help break down physical walls with Contrary Leaf Storm such as Suicune and Rotom-W. Garchomp can help take care of Fire-types and can switch into any Electric-type move. Mega Metagross resists Dragon-, Fairy-, and Ice-type moves, providing a nice switch-in for Garchomp's counters. Greninja has excellent coverage that can help get rid of threats such as Garchomp, Gengar, Hippowdon, Mega Salamence, and Landorus-T. Thundurus gives speed control with Thunder Wave, and with its ability Prankster, it'll surely get a paralysis off. Rotom-H and Rotom-W are immune to Ground-type moves, and both can use Will-O-Wisp to soften attacks aimed at Mega Metagross. Breloom offers Metagross Spore support and can even slow foes with Rock Tomb so that Metagross has an easier time outspeeding them prior to Mega Evolution. Breloom is also able to eliminate bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Suicune, and Slowbro, which Metagross really appreciates.</p> <p>Mamoswine does an excellent job at removing Ground-, Dragon-, and Steel-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Mega Mawile so Mega Metagross has an easier time setting up. If Ferrothorn is a pain when trying to set up Hone Claws, consider Magnezone as a partner to trap and remove this nuisance. Mega Metagross isn't actually too bad on rain teams for their ability to threaten dangerous Fire-types Mega Metagross might struggle with such as Talonflame, Blaziken, and Mega Charizard X and Y. Mega Salamence has an easy time with certain matchups Mega Metagross struggles with, namely Fairy-, Fighting-, and Ice-types such as Mega Mawile, Mamoswine, and Blaziken.</p>"

  "Latias": {
    "overview": "<p>Latias is able to serve either as a late-game sweeper or as a check to an array of foes such as slower Dragons or physical attackers, with its better defensive stats, which allow it to take a Shadow Ball from Mega Gengar, and access to Healing Wish giving it a niche over the generally preferred Latios. Mega Latias's bulk emphasizes these differences even further, giving stall teams an immense amount of trouble once Tyranitar has been eliminated and making Latias more versatile than Latios. Furthermore, in combination with the recovery granted by Roost, Latias is able to stick around for extended periods of time, which resistances to common types and a Ground immunity help with. Its high base Speed allows it to outpace the majority of threats in the metagame, often giving it the initiative. This is particularly advantageous for outspeeding most Dragons, such as Garchomp and Mega Salamence, the latter of which often does not use a Speed-boosting nature. A wide offensive movepool, including moves such as Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball, gives Latias the means to deal with a variety of foes, making it somewhat unpredictable. For example, Azumarill, while ordinarily problematic, is 2HKOed by a Choice Specs-boosted Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Latias does still, however, face competition from Latios offensively, as the latter can take advantage of a higher Special Attack stat in that role. Latios is also not the only Dragon-type it faces competition from. Hydreigon, for example, is another special attacking Dragon-type that hits hard. Being walled by both Dark- and Fairy-types can create some unfavorable match-ups straight from Team Preview. Steel-types also resist both of Latias's STAB moves, making foes such as Mega Mawile, Aegislash, Ferrothorn, and Scizor equally problematic. Overall, Latias is very versatile and can therefore perform well on many different types of teams, but you should ensure it's not outclassed in doing so.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunderbolt and Ice Beam are individual options for the excellent coverage they provide or as a pair to complete the popular BoltBeam combination. Shadow Ball helps Latias beat opposing Psychic-types, such as Cresselia, that it can otherwise struggle with. It also helps handle Aegislash, which, while otherwise problematic, is 2HKOed with a Choice Specs-boosted Shadow Ball. Energy Ball is an alternative to Thunderbolt that also beats Ground-types like Swampert. Grass Knot could also be used for this purpose, but it does little damage to lighter foes such as Rotom-W and Gastrodon. However, a particular quirk of Grass Knot is that +1 Mega Latias can OHKO maximum HP Mega Tyranitar with it. Hidden Power Fire can be used to deal with Steel-types like Scizor and Ferrothorn. Stored Power can be used in place of Psyshock on the Calm Mind set for the potential to hit even harder once Mega Latias has set up, though it comes at the cost of dealing very poor damage without consecutive boosts. This can work particularly well if you have teammates to Baton Pass boosts so that Latias is less dependent on accumulating them itself. Charm is an alternative to Reflect on the physically defensive set, as the ability to use it multiple times allows Latias to wall a single target harder; however, Reflect is generally more consistent and isn't reset when the opponent switches out. Life Orb can be used over Choice Specs to boost Latias's power while retaining the ability to change moves; however, such a set requires running another coverage move or Roost instead of Trick. Notably, a big selling point of Life Orb is that Latias can use Healing Wish immediately after using Draco Meteor, which can be great for momentum. Choice Scarf is another alternative to Choice Specs that trades power for the ability to outspeed faster foes. Lum Berry can help to check users of crippling status such as Thunder Wave Thundurus and Spore Breloom. Latiasite can be used in the physically defensive set if your team doesn't have a Mega Pokemon already, but note that this means it can't chip at Mega Kangaskhan with Rocky Helmet. Safety Goggles can be used specifically for users of powder moves such as Breloom and Venusaur to help beat them one-on-one.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Although Latias can outspeed and hit most of them super effectively, many Dragons are still situationally problematic for it. Garchomp, for example, more often than not uses either Focus Sash or Choice Scarf, both of which allow it to trade positively with Latias. Salamence can outspeed Latias after Mega Evolving if it uses a Jolly nature and can then fire off a strong Dragon-type move to OHKO it. Dragonite's Multiscale allows it to take a single hit from Latias and then proceed to either Dragon Dance or OHKO it back. However, note that a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor can still OHKO Dragonite through its Multiscale.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Dark-types are immune to Latias's Psychic-type moves and can hit it super effectively with their STAB attacks. Choice Scarf Hydreigon is common and has a chance to OHKO even bulkier Latias sets with a high-powered Draco Meteor. Tyranitar takes little damage from any of Latias's attacks thanks to the sand boosting its Special Defense, and its access to Pursuit means Latias cannot switch out safely against it. Mega Sableye is one of the few defensive Pokemon capable of taking on the Choice Specs set thanks to its immunity to Trick and ability to deal good damage with either Foul Play or Snarl.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Fairy-types are immune to Dragon-type attacks, and their access to high-powered moves means they can deal a lot of damage to Latias. Mega Mawile resists Psychic thanks to its Steel typing and can use Sucker Punch to strike first. Gardevoir also resists Psychic and can deal massive damage even through Substitute with Hyper Voice. Sylveon likewise gets access to Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice, and it has an equally as high Special Defense stat it can use to wall Latias. However, it does need to be wary of a Choice Specs-boosted Psyshock, which can still 2HKO it. Mega Altaria also gets Hyper Voice, and its high defenses means it's difficult to 2HKO. Klefki takes little damage from either of Latias's STAB moves, and it can whittle away at it with a combination of Swagger and Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: As Steel-types resist both Dragon- and Psychic-type attacks, they're able to easily wall Latias. Aegislash's high defenses in Shield forme and its Ghost typing allow it to both take hits well and strike back hard. Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball deals a lot of damage to Latias as a result of it being so fast. Heatran, particularly the Choice Specs variant, can dish out good damage with Flash Cannon. It should beware of a Choice Specs-boosted Surf, however, as this can 2HKO even bulkier variants. Mega Lucario outspeeds Latias and can deal large damage with Iron Tail, OHKOing it after a Swords Dance boost. Scizor takes little damage from either of Latias's STAB moves and easily OHKOes even bulky sets with Bug Bite.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control: Almost all variants of Latias rely on their high Speed, which makes them vulnerable to various forms of speed control. Thunder Wave from Pokemon such as Thundurus, Rotom-W, and Cresselia quarters Latias's Speed. The latter two should be wary against Calm Mind variants however, as they can merely end up as setup fodder. Icy Wind from users such as Gengar and Suicune hits Latias super effectively and lowers its Speed by one stage. Trick Room set by Pokemon such as Cresselia, Porygon2, and Slowbro allows slower Pokemon to move first.</p>",

        "name": "Mega Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind boosts Mega Latias's Special Attack and Special Defense by one stage, giving it the means to set up on the foe. Psyshock is the STAB move of choice, as it deals a consistent amount of damage at high accuracy. It also has the quirk of hitting the target's Defense stat, which is part of the reason why it generally outclasses Psychic, as it therefore threatens Calm Mind Suicune more. Roost can help keep Mega Latias healthy by recovering 50% of its HP, compensating for health lost by damage taken from foes and Substitute. Substitute is most effective against defensive threats, giving Mega Latias the option of blocking crippling status, such as poison, paralysis, and burn, from inhibiting its sweep. It also provides a means to prevent the use of Sucker Punch from foes such as Mega Kangaskhan. Draco Meteor can be used instead to provide Latias with some mid-game wallbreaking potential.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Latiasite allows Latias to Mega Evolve, which significantly improves its stats and its ability to sweep through teams. Levitate grants it an immunity to Ground-type moves, which provides more opportunities for Mega Latias to set up. The Speed EVs and Timid nature make Mega Latias as fast as possible. The remaining EVs are invested into HP to boost Mega Latias's general bulk as much as possible. While 56 EVs can be moved out of Speed to improve Mega Latias's bulk but still outspeed Garchomp, this is not recommended, as it's generally counterproductive to sweeping.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set aims to begin setting up to close out the battle once any problematic foes have been eliminated. After gaining a few boosts, Mega Latias is dangerous, and special attackers such as Aegislash, Greninja, and Sylveon will no longer be able to 2HKO it. However, don't try to force this; leave Mega Latias on the bench if you don't believe setting up to be a reasonable expectation. Focus on bringing checks to Steel-, Fairy-, and Dark-types, as they will be the most problematic for Latias. Mega Charizard Y and Rotom-W are good examples of setup fodder, as Latias can stall out Mega Charizard Y's Drought and takes little damage from any of Rotom-W's attacks. Defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia, Porygon2, Zapdos, and Slowbro also make good targets to set up on. Suicune is another example, but bear in mind that Roar is reasonably common, which allows it to phaze Latias. Be sure to Mega Evolve as soon as possible to take advantage of Mega Latias's higher defensive stats. Try to keep Substitute up as much as possible in order to block crippling status from ruining your game plan. It's also recommended to do this as a way of preventing critical hits from OHKOing Latias through its Special Defense boosts.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As this set is walled by Dark-types, teammates that can remove them for Mega Latias are essential. Using a second Mega Evolution such as Mega Mawile, Mega Heracross, or Mega Scizor can offer alternatives for when Mega Latias faces a very poor match-up, as each handles the majority of foes Latias struggles against such as Sylveon and Tyranitar. Azumarill has a great match-up against Dark-types, as it resists their STAB moves and can hit the majority of them super effectively with Play Rough. Blaziken can likewise handle Dark-types well and, in return, appreciates Latias as a defensive switch-in due to its frailty. Protean Greninja gets STAB Low Kick to similarly threaten Dark-types, amongst a variety of other coverage, such as Gunk Shot and Ice Beam, that allow it to threaten other foes that threaten Mega Latias. Non-Mega Scizor, as a Bug-type, also makes a great partner, as it deals with both Dark- and Fairy-types excellently. Physically defensive Scizor makes a particularly good partner, as it can handle physical attackers in general. Ferrothorn accomplishes the same in handling Fairy-types and serves as a great check to physical attackers. Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Gyarados equally help to keep physical attackers in check by lowering their Attack stat. Landorus-T also has access to Stealth Rock, which breaks Focus Sash and therefore helps boosted Latias pick up OHKOs against Focus Sash users such as Breloom. Will-O-Wisp users such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Rotom-W can halve the foe's Attack. The former two, being Fire-types, also provide the benefit of resisting Fairy-type attacks and have the ability to check Steel-types.</p>"

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Latias's hardest-hitting attack, dealing massive damage when combined with the boost from Choice Specs. It does, however, come with the drawback of lowering Latias's Special Attack by two stages. Psychic is a STAB move that deals consistent damage at a reasonable Base Power and high accuracy. Alternatively, Psyshock can be used instead if you'd prefer to have the option of hitting a foe's potentially lower Defense. For example, Psychic hits foes like Mega Venusaur harder, but Psyshock deals with Assault Vest users such as Conkeldurr better. Trick can disable a defensive foe by locking them into a single move, making them easy to eliminate. Surf hits many of the targets that Latias struggles against, such as Tyranitar and Heatran, super effectively. Alternatively, Healing Wish differentiates Latias from Latios and can be used over Surf to give Latias more late-game utility by healing up a strong partner such as Mega Mawile or Mega Kangaskhan, should you find that more valuable.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Specs provides the largest increase to Latias's damage output, albeit while locking it into a single move. Levitate is Latias's only ability, but the immunity to Ground-type moves it grants is great for giving it more opportunities to switch in and deal damage. The Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Latias to outpace as many threats as possible. The remaining EVs are invested into Latias's Special Attack, improving damage output. A Modest nature may be used to deal even more damage, allowing it to OHKO foes, such as 4 HP Mega Kangaskhan, with Draco Meteor. However, it then misses out on outspeeding key threats around the base 100 Speed mark such as Garchomp, generally making it the poorer option.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set aims to deal as much damage as possible, not necessarily focusing on super effective hits. This is because a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor deals a lot of damage even on neutral hits. As Draco Meteor will often be the best choice of move, Latias will be switching in and out a lot to reset the stat drops associated with it. Its superior defenses when compared to Latios and its plentiful resistances complement this strategy, as they make switching in much easier. Do try to think a turn ahead when using Draco Meteor however, as it's easy to fall into the trap of losing too much momentum. If you're running Psyshock, get familiar with predicting foes with high Special Defense to switch in, as it can often 2HKO them. Sylveon, for example, would normally be a safe switch-in against Latias, but is 2HKOed by Psyshock. Chansey is an exception, as it can take a Psyshock relatively easily and would be better crippled by the use of Trick. If using Healing Wish, wait until Latias is no longer useful, or if a crippled ally could better close out the battle.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Teammates that can deal with Pokemon that resist Latias's STAB moves, such as Dark- and Fairy-types, are appreciated. Mega Mawile and Scizor are great examples of this, as they can check both of those types with their STAB moves. Physical Greninja can use a combination of Low Kick and Gunk Shot to accomplish something similar. However, it does have difficulty switching into Fairy-types directly, as it's natively a Dark-type. Azumarill is another Fairy-type that does a good job at checking Dark-types. Fairies being immune to Dragon-type attacks also makes them easy to switch into opposing Dragons. Ferrothorn makes another good Steel-type partner, as it is able to deal well with opposing Fairy-types. Fighting-types such as Blaziken and Mega Heracross are also useful for beating Dark-types, and they are further able to beat Steel-types, which are problematic due to them resisting both of Latias's STAB moves. Fire-types such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Rotom-H equally beat Steel-types and provide a resistance to Fairy. Talonflame is additionally useful as a check against Blaziken, which Latias struggles against because of its combination of Speed Boost and Knock Off. Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Mamoswine likewise hit Steel-types super effectively, although the latter is admittedly hit super effectively by them too. Both can also provide Stealth Rock support, which is useful for breaking the Focus Sash of Pokemon such as Breloom.</p>"

        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psychic is used to provide Latias with a consistent STAB move with reasonable power and high accuracy. Draco Meteor has the ability to pick up OHKOs against foes such as Garchomp, but use of the move is incredibly risky because of the Special Attack decrease. Reflect reduces the damage Latias's team takes for five turns, making it better able to wall physical attackers. Thunder Wave provides a form of speed control and reduces the chance the foe has to move by 25%. This is useful for crippling threats such as Blaziken, which, while ordinarily very fast thanks to Speed Boost, struggles once that advantage has been taken away. Toxic could be used in place of Thunder Wave if your team particularly struggles against defensive threats like Cresselia and Porygon2. Roost recovers 50% of Latias's HP, which allows it to continue racking up chip damage with Rocky Helmet. Healing Wish could be used over Roost if you'd prefer Latias simply went down after doing its job. This synergizes particularly well with Draco Meteor, as it allows Latias to safely exit the match after its stats have been lowered.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rocky Helmet inflicts chip damage against foes that use contact moves, primarily physical attackers, such as Mega Kangaskhan, which takes double the damage due to Parental Bond. Levitate, while being Latias's only ability, gives it an immunity to Ground-type moves, providing Latias with even more opportunities to safely switch in. The Speed EVs and a Timid nature are used to allow Latias to get off its moves, particularly Reflect, before as many foes as possible. The remaining EVs are used to bolster Latias's overall bulk as much as possible, allowing it an easier time of walling foes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set aims to beat non-Dark-type physical attackers while also providing support for Latias's teammates. You should mostly pick Latias at Team Preview when you want to bring a setup sweeper that would benefit from Latias's support. Another example is when a specially defensive partner needs Latias to defeat the physical attackers that it cannot alone. This is because a Latias without Trick or much offensive presence otherwise struggles to accomplish much outside of these scenarios. This set deals especially well with Mega Kangaskhan because of Parental Bond forcing it to take two rounds of Rocky Helmet damage, particularly if you can switch it in on a weak attack such as Fake Out. Try to Reflect as early as possible and keep it up, as Latias's Defense stat is merely average without it. An exception is if you anticipate the opponent bringing in a special attacker, in which case you should instead opt to cripple them with Thunder Wave. If Healing Wish is chosen, use it when Latias is no longer useful and when an ally can better close out the battle.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Mega Mawile and Scizor make the best partners, as Reflect helps them get off their setup moves and Thunder Wave consequently helps them sweep by ensuring they outspeed their potential threats. They're also useful against defensive foes such as Cresselia, Porygon2, Zapdos, and Calm Mind Suicune, and they both resist many of the types Latias is weak to, making them able to switch in extra safely. Power-Up Punch Mega Kangaskhan is another notable example, as Thunder Wave helps it outspeed foes around its very crowded base 100 Speed tier. Calm Mind Raikou is also a fantastic teammate, as Latias needs help to beat opposing bulky Water-types. Likewise, Electric-types in general such as Thundurus and Zapdos are good options, as they also provide a means of dealing with them.</p> <p>Specially defensive Pokemon and Assault Vest users also complement this set well, as they can often wall the attackers that Latias cannot. Assault Vest Mamoswine appreciates the speed control Latias provides and can check Steel- and Dragon-types in return. Azumarill also makes a good Assault Vest user, and it can counter most Dark- and Dragon-types easily. Heatran functions very well with a specially defensive variant of its stall set, and its typing complements Latias's well. Pokemon that deal with the Dark- and Steel-types that wall Latias's only attacking move make good offensive partners. Fighting-types such as Blaziken and Mega Heracross are able to deal with said Dark- and Steel-types, for example. Mega Heracross particularly enjoys the speed control provided by Thunder Wave due to its merely average Speed. Fire-types such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Rotom-H provide a resistance to Fairy and can beat Steel-types. Landorus-T also beats Steel-types handily, and its Intimidate ability further improves Latias's bulk.</p>"

  "Infernape": {
    "overview": "<p>Infernape stands out as a great suicide lead in Battle Spot, while also boasting a vast movepool and the offensive stats to be a powerful mixed attacker. It sits at an impressive Speed tier of base 108, allowing it to become an effective scout when holding Focus Sash for common Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp and Landorus-T. Access to support moves such as Encore and Taunt makes Infernape a threat that is almost impossible to set up on and can grant its teammates ample opportunities to set up themselves. Infernape's nice offensive typing allows it to check common Dark-, Grass-, and Steel-types such as Hydreigon, Serperior, and Mega Mawile. However, this leaves Infernape weak to Ground-, Water-, and Dragon-types, which are very common in the metagame. Additionally, Infernape is also extremely frail, meaning it cannot switch into any attacks. Even neutral STAB moves such as Outrage can easily knock it out. Infernape also relies heavily on its Focus Sash to check Flying-types such as Talonflame and Thundurus with Rock Tomb, and it is also very predictable, though you can play this to your advantage at Team Preview; the same can be said for your opponent. As a lead, Infernape has difficulties with two other common leads seen in Battle Spot, Breloom and Mamoswine. Infernape is generally outclassed by Blaziken in all offensive roles, which limits its usefulness, as Stealth Rock isn't a necessity on every team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>When you're using Naive Infernape, an alternative EV spread of 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe allows it to KO Mega Gengar with the combination of Rock Tomb + Overheat more than 70% of the time, although this is outclassed by the physical variant, as the damage decrease on Rock Tomb makes it miss out on crucial OHKOs on numerous threats such as Volcarona. A mixed attacking set with Life Orb allows Infernape to net several KOs that would normally not be possible for a Focus Sash set, such as Close Combat OHKOing Mega Kangaskhan, even for a special variant, and Overheat directly OHKOing both Mega Gengar and Aegislash and also reliably 2HKOing Mega Sableye after the Special Attack drop. If Infernape is packing Grass Knot, it can OHKO physically defensive Hippowdon and take on a few other threats that it might struggle with such as Mega Slowbro, Mega Swampert, and Gastrodon. Mach Punch is great for finishing off Focus Sash users, especially those that can finish off Infernape with a priority move, such as Mamoswine. Iron Fist should be used over Blaze if running Mach Punch, as it increases the move's damage output. Do note, however, that the mixed attacking set is somewhat outclassed by Blaziken, as the only niche Infernape has over it is access to Grass Knot and Mach Punch, and it loses out on Speed Boost. Hidden Power Ice is notable for being able to 2HKO Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Landorus-T even with a Jolly nature. Taunt helps Infernape against users of Spore, Thunder Wave, Yawn, and Stealth Rock such as Breloom, Porygon2, Hippowdon, and Garchomp. Fake Out works great to break Focus Sashes on foes such as Mamoswine and Breloom. Endeavor works well with Focus Sash by allowing Infernape to bring the foe down to 1 HP for the next team member to finish off. This is especially helpful against foes that resist Infernape's dual STAB moves, such as Slowbro, Gyarados, and Dragonite.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: Due to Magic Bounce, Mega Sableye cannot be burned, Encored into a move, or Taunted and can even bounce back Stealth Rock. It is immune to Close Combat and can easily wall Infernape and use it as setup fodder for Calm Mind unless it is running Life Orb, in which case it can 2HKO Mega Sableye with Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers</strong>: Aegislash can beat Infernape with a combination of Shadow Ball + Shadow Sneak, and Mamoswine can do the same with Earthquake + Ice Shard. Azumarill's Aqua Jet and Breloom's Mach Punch 2HKO it. Though it fears Rock Tomb, Talonflame's Brave Bird can OHKO Infernape if its Focus Sash is broken. Greninja is able to pick off Infernape if it is packing a Water-type STAB move such as Scald or Surf by finishing it off with priority Shadow Sneak or Water Shuriken.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Mega Salamence, Dragonite, and Mega Altaria resist both of Infernape's STAB moves while taking little from Rock Tomb and threatening to KO Infernape with their own STAB move of choice.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Common Ground-types seen in the metagame, such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon, have an easy time with Infernape. The former two commonly run Choice Scarf while the last walls Infernape that lack Grass Knot and easily breaks its Focus Sash thanks to its ability Sand Stream. Each of them can also threaten to KO Infernape with STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types like Rotom-W, Suicune, Azumarill, and Gyarados have no problem walling Infernape due to their good bulk, and all can retaliate with their powerful Water-type STAB moves. Neither Azumarill nor Gyarados can afford to take a Will-O-Wisp, though.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Cresselia easily walls Infernape but needs to watch out for Encore when using a non-attacking move such as Toxic or Moonlight. Both Slowbro and Latios can OHKO Infernape with their STAB Psychic. However, the former needs to watch out for Grass Knot, though the latter can outspeed Infernape and even use Trick to lock it into one move. Espeon is faster and can set up Calm Mind on Infernape without fearing Encore at all due to Magic Bounce.</p>",

        "name": "Standard",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock allows Infernape to break the omnipresent Focus Sash and put pressure on the opposing team in general, which is extremely useful for setup Pokemon such as Mega Salamence so that a foe's Focus Sash or Sturdy does not ruin a potential sweep. Rock Tomb can be used to OHKO the threats that resist Infernape's STAB moves such as Talonflame, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard Y and slow down a faster threat such as Thundurus so Infernape can KO it the following turn before it can finish off with Thunderbolt. Close Combat is Infernape's most reliable Fighting STAB move, OHKOing Mega Kangaskhan and Greninja and 2HKOing Ferrothorn and Normal-types like Porygon2 and Chansey. Encore is the best move to use in the last slot. Not only does it prevent Infernape from getting set up on, but it also locks the foe into a move, whether it be attacking or non-attacking, so that the next team member can potentially have a free turn. Overheat is Infernape's most powerful Fire-type STAB move, easily OHKOing Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Mega Mawile. It is preferred over Flare Blitz because it is a non-contact move that will not be affected by Intimidate or King's Shield, not to mention that Flare Blitz's unnecessary residual damage from self-recoil, Rough Skin and Iron Barbs, or Rocky Helmet makes it counterproductive with Focus Sash. Will-O-Wisp is viable in the last slot, as it can be used to cripple and soften the damage from physical attackers, notably Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Azumarill.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Jolly nature along with full investment in Attack and Speed is a must on Infernape, allowing it to be as fast as possible while still maximizing its damage output. The remaining 4 EV points should be allocated to Special Defense so that Porygon2 does not get a boost in Special Attack from Download. A Naive nature should be used if you decide to run Overheat in the last slot so that the move will not be hindered by a lower Special Attack stat. It is important to note that maximum Attack should be run even with a Naive nature to ensure the best chance at OHKOing Mega Kangaskhan. Focus Sash is a must on Infernape, allowing it to function effectively as a lead either by getting Stealth Rock up or using Encore before going down to a super effective attack. Blaze goes well with Focus Sash, as Infernape is guaranteed to survive a hit, significantly increasing the power of Overheat at low health.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Stealth Rock leads such as Infernape are normally only found on very offensive teams, since balance and stall teams do not need something that just gets entry hazards up and faints. Offensive teams, on the other hand, appreciate having Stealth Rock on the opposing side or a foe locked into a move via Encore to create the necessary opportunities to set up safely. Infernape is normally used as a dedicated lead, since you want get Stealth Rock up as soon as possible or just Encore something for your next Pokemon to set up. That being said, you can use Team Preview to your advantage, since the opponent will more than likely think about having to face Infernape in the lead matchup by sending in something that can counter it, such as Mega Sableye. Therefore, in matchups where Stealth Rock isn't necessary, it might be wise to bench Infernape entirely to avoid situations where you cannot afford to be effectively one Pokemon down. It is usually safe to go for Stealth Rock in common lead matchups such as against Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mamoswine so that you can Encore them into their own Stealth Rock or Earthquake, allowing your Flying-type to come in safely next turn. However, be careful when facing Mamoswine, as the combination of Earthquake + Ice Shard will finish off Infernape unless it is running Mach Punch. Breloom is another lead that Infernape struggles with, as it threatens to put something to sleep right away due to its Focus Sash being in tact, while Mach Punch is only a 2HKO; therefore, breaking its Focus Sash is Infernape's optimal play. When you're going up against Greninja, Rock Tomb should be used over Close Combat in the event Greninja uses Shadow Sneak, breaks Infernape's Focus Sash, and proceeds to finish it off with a Water- or Psychic-type STAB move. As lead Rotom tends to carry Choice items, they might be worth scouting for by switching into your Mega Pokemon. Otherwise, it is generally preferred to 2HKO it with Close Combat. Focus Sash can be utilized not only to get Stealth Rock up but also to just go for the 2HKO with Close Combat on threats such as Porygon2 and Chansey if your team really appreciates one of them being gone.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Salamence is one of the best partners for Infernape in terms of synergy, as it can easily set up on a foe locked into Earthquake and appreciates Infernape's Stealth Rock, while Infernape easily eliminates the Rock- and Ice-types that may cause Mega Salamence trouble such as Tyranitar, Greninja, and Weavile. Mega Charizard X, Volcarona, and Dragonite are other great offensive sweepers that appreciate Infernape in the same manner as Mega Salamence does. Greninja beats the Ground-, Dragon-, Flying-, and Psychic-types that Infernape struggles with, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Thundurus, and Slowbro, with its impressive coverage and appreciates Stealth Rock for breaking any potential Focus Sashes. Azumarill can threaten every Dragon- and Ground-type that Infernape struggles with, including Garchomp, Mega Salamence, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon. Infernape can also lock these threats in a non-damaging move with Encore so that Azumarill has a chance to set up Belly Drum, as well as eliminate Grass- and Steel-types for Azumarill such as Serperior, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. Suicune is another Water-type that can comfortably set up on Mega Sableye, something that Infernape really struggles with and cannot break through, while also being able to deal with the aforementioned Dragon- and Ground-types due to its excellent bulk and defensive typing. Togekiss is another Fairy-type that is excellent at walling Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Dragonite, and it is able to cripple foes further when running Thunder Wave or Trick and can easily switch into Choice-locked Earthquake. In return, Infernape deals with the Rock- and Ice-types that Togekiss might struggle with such as Tyranitar, Ice Beam Greninja, and Weavile. Grass-types such as Serperior can easily set up on the Water-types that wall Infernape, such as Rotom-W, Suicune, and Slowbro. Serperior can also cripple faster switch-ins with Glare, such as Mega Gengar and Blaziken, while also being able to comfortably come in Breloom's Spore. Raikou, Rotom-W, and Thundurus lessen the pressure on Infernape by reliably checking Flying-types such as Talonflame, so Infernape does not always have to rely on its Focus Sash to deal with it, as well as switching into Thunder Wave. Rotom-W is notable for being able to wall both Landorus-T and Mamoswine, two threats Infernape really struggles to deal with. Mega Gengar can trap and eliminate an foe crippled by Encore when the opportunity arises, such as using Disable on Suicune's Scald, forcing it to use Struggle.</p>"

  "Roserade": {
    "overview": "<p>Roserade is a relatively niche Pokemon in the Battle Spot Singles metagame. It faces great competition from Grass-types such as Serperior and Mega Venusaur, which both offer more utility on a team due to their Speed and bulk, respectively. However, Roserade manages to separate itself from other Grass-types by having a better offensive movepool and, most notably, access to Technician. Roserade boasts an impressive Special Attack stat, and with Technician, it has the rare ability to utilize a 90 BP Hidden Power for flexibility in strong coverage options. Access to Sleep Powder lets it function similarly to a special equivalent of Breloom, winning against many threats one-on-one with a Focus Sash. A Grass / Poison typing also grants Roserade very useful resistances to primarily special types like Electric, Water, and Fairy, which function well with Roserade's respectable Special Defense. This allows Roserade to beat common bulky Water-types like Suicune and Rotom-W while also threatening Fairy-types like Sylveon and Azumarill. However, incredibly low physical bulk brings Roserade down, making it difficult to take even resisted physical hits. It also sits at an awkward Speed tier for a somewhat frail Pokemon, leaving Roserade outsped by many relevant threats such as Garchomp, Mega Kangaskhan, and Gengar. As a Grass-type it suffers from weaknesses to common attacking types like Flying, Fire, and Ice, which make it difficult for Roserade to last long without a Focus Sash.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf is an alternative to allow Roserade function as a revenge killer due to its wide offensive movepool. Timid Choice Scarf Roserade outspeeds all relevant Pokemon with the exception of faster Choice Scarf users, while Modest lets it outspeed up to base 140 Speed Pokemon. Assault Vest lets Roserade more comfortably switch in to special attackers, with Giga Drain healing some of the damage it takes. This item is notable for letting Roserade survive Ice Beam from Greninja to beat it with Hidden Power Fire. However, Assault Vest sets lack the power of Life Orb and Expert Belt as well as the safety of Focus Sash. Roserade can run a bulkier Natural Cure set with Black Sludge and a Calm nature on teams that want Mega Venusaur's resistances but don't want to use up the Mega slot. It can also utilize Rest thanks to Natural Cure, but this forces it to switch out immediately. In general, Mega Venusaur or Amoonguss are still better options for a bulky Grass-type, though Roserade's offensive presence is enough to set it apart from these two.</p> <p>Energy Ball is an alternative to Magical Leaf if Roserade opts for Natural Cure over Technician, though it doesn't have any advantages otherwise. Shadow Ball is an option to hit Aegislash if Roserade is running something in place of Hidden Power Fire and also hits Psychic-types like Latios on the switch. However, the move has few uses otherwise, and Aegislash is hit harder by Technician Hidden Power Fire anyway. Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit Talonflame, both Charizard formes, and Volcarona on the switch; Roserade can't afford to stay in against them unless it's running Focus Sash. However, if running Focus Sash, the recoil that Talonflame takes will put it in range of Sludge Bomb, so Hidden Power Rock isn't always needed to beat Talonflame. Dazzling Gleam hits Dragon-types like Latios while still hitting Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Dragonite. It also hits Mega Sableye harder than any of Roserade's other moves, but otherwise Hidden Power Ice is a better option for Dragons.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Talonflame, both Charizard formes, Blaziken, and Heatran completely stop Roserade, either outspeeding it or walling it and OHKOing with any Fire-type move. However, all of these bar Heatran need to be wary of Focus Sash and being put to sleep or surprised by Hidden Power Rock or Extrasensory.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: If Roserade lacks Hidden Power Fire, Steel-types like Mega Mawile, Scizor, Aegislash, and Ferrothorn wall it completely, and most of them threaten it with physical moves. Ferrothorn in particular is immune to Sleep Powder, so it has little trouble setting up Stealth Rock in front of Roserade.</p> <p><strong>Multi-Hit Moves: Mega Kangaskhan, +2 Cloyster, and Choice Scarf Mamoswine can reliably beat Roserade with Return or Icicle Spear without fear of being put to sleep by a Focus Sash Roserade. Roserade's low physical bulk means that it risks being KOed by Mamoswine's Icicle Spear even if Mamoswine only gets two hits.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: If Roserade lacks Extrasensory, it has no way to deal with opposing Poison-types, and it takes neutral damage from them due to being part Grass-type. Mega Gengar and Mega Venusaur both beat Roserade with ease, and Mega Venusaur in particular is immune to Sleep Powder and doesn't take much damage from Hidden Power due to Thick Fat.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Roserade's Special Attack isn't as high as that of other wallbreakers, so numerous special walls have little trouble stopping Roserade. Chansey and Blissey in particular take little damage from Roserade, and neither is particularly bothered by Sleep Powder or being poisoned by Sludge Bomb due to Natural Cure.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Many Psychic-types are naturally faster than Roserade, so Pokemon like Latios, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Alakazam can threaten to OHKO it. They must be wary of retaliation by a coverage move or being put to sleep if Roserade has a Focus Sash, though they otherwise have little trouble dealing with it. Cresselia also doesn't mind what Roserade does to it other than the occasional Shadow Ball and typically isn't bothered by Sleep Powder.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sludge Bomb is Roserade's primary STAB move, allowing it to beat Fairy- and Grass-types and boasting a useful 30% chance to poison the foe. Giga Drain is a secondary STAB move that pairs well with Life Orb to heal off recoil and helps Roserade last longer, though the power can be underwhelming against bulky Water-types like Suicune. Magical Leaf is a reliable alternative that benefits from Technician, hitting 90 Base Power and ignoring evasion in case of an emergency. However, Roserade typically struggles against most common evasion boosters anyway, so the accuracy isn't a major draw. Leaf Storm is Roserade's most powerful Grass-type STAB move, capable of OHKOing Suicune and Rotom-W reliably without a Life Orb, but the Special Attack drops can turn Roserade into setup fodder, which is not preferable on a Pokemon that wants to maintain momentum for its team. Roserade needs Extrasensory to avoid being walled by Poison-types like Gengar and Mega Venusaur, as well as to hit Blaziken on the switch. Technician-boosted Hidden Power Fire beats Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Scizor, which otherwise completely wall Roserade; this is especially useful since the former is immune to Sleep Powder. In contrast, Hidden Power Ice makes Roserade more vulnerable against Steel-types but allows it to effectively lure Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence. However, it needs to run Focus Sash for this, as all of them outspeed Roserade. If one of the coverage slots isn't necessary, Sleep Powder is an option to let it punish switches and turn potentially bad matchups into favorable ones, all while keeping its Focus Sash intact.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Technician is used almost exclusively for a stronger Hidden Power, though this is one of the primary reasons to use Roserade over other Grass-types anyway. Natural Cure is an alternative if Roserade is not running Hidden Power to let it function as a switch-in to Scald and status moves; otherwise, Technician should always be used. The listed EV spread is designed to be used with Hidden Power Fire. Special Attack and Speed investment is optimized to ensure no EVs are wasted while maximizing damage output and ensuring that Roserade is as fast as possible, with the remaining EVs going into HP for a slight increase in bulk. A spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe is recommended with Hidden Power Ice since it does not impact the Special Attack or Speed IVs like Hidden Power Fire does.</p> <p>Modest is the preferred nature to ensure Roserade can reliably KO threats such as Hippowdon and Azumarill. Timid can be used to outspeed Jolly Mamoswine and get the jump on Adamant Mega Charizard X and Mega Kangaskhan to hit them with Sleep Powder, though the power drop is noticeable and it loses out KOs against the aforementioned threats. Life Orb gives Roserade a noticeable power boost, though Focus Sash is preferred so that it can function as an effective lure to its common checks. Expert Belt is a slightly weaker alternative to Life Orb if running four attacking moves, since Roserade covers a wide range of threats thanks to Technician Hidden Power. The lack of recoil can help Roserade survive longer and bluff another item, but unlike Life Orb, it fails to provide enough power to OHKO Mega Gengar with Extrasensory. Hidden Power Ice should not be used if Roserade runs Life Orb, though, since Roserade needs the Focus Sash to lure Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The item choice makes a big impact on how Roserade should be played. Focus Sash Roserade is best used as a lead or immediately after a partner is KOed to keep its Focus Sash intact. This makes it difficult to beat Roserade one-on-one, especially with the threat of Sleep Powder. Focus Sash Roserade can also lure a multitude of threats like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence, so keeping Focus Sash intact is incredibly important. Life Orb Roserade doesn't have the same cushion that its Focus Sash set has, so it's more effective when used later in the game once its checks and counters have been removed or paralyzed by a partner.</p> <p>Roserade's average Speed and low physical bulk mean that it has a difficult matchup against many of the format's physical powerhouses like Mega Kangaskhan, Garchomp, and Mega Salamence. However, it has advantageous matchups against common Water- and Grass-types such as Suicune, Azumarill, Rotom-W, Serperior, and Breloom, so being aware of both the good and bad matchups is important. Sleep Powder can be used to take advantage of these favorable matchups, and it's generally a safe move against Pokemon that are unlikely to stay in against Roserade. However, the move's shaky accuracy can be costly, so it's sometimes better to attack anyway if the foe might have a move that threatens Roserade, such as Knock Off from Azumarill or Ice Beam from Suicune.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Steel-types like Mega Mawile and Aegislash have great synergy with Roserade, serving as good switch-ins to all of Roserade's weaknesses except Fire. Both also beat Mega Kangaskhan, which otherwise has little trouble beating Roserade regardless of its item. In return, Natural Cure lets Roserade handle status moves aimed at Mega Mawile, notably allowing Roserade to switch safely in to Scald. Fire-types like Rotom-H, Heatran, Talonflame, Blaziken, and both Charizard formes beat Steel-types for Roserade if it forgoes Hidden Power Fire, as it has no way to handle them without it. Rotom-H in particular beats Talonflame, which otherwise destroys Roserade if it lacks Focus Sash, and Blaziken deals with Mega Kangaskhan. Roserade can also handle Water-types as well as switch into Electric-type moves aimed at Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <p>Roserade appreciates Stealth Rock support to secure KOs against threats like Suicune and Hippowdon, so Garchomp and Mamoswine make for effective partners that also appreciate Roserade's ability to beat these threats for them. Paralysis support from Cresselia or Slowbro makes Roserade's job much easier by helping it outspeed the numerous threats above the base 90 Speed range. Both also help against Mega Kangaskhan, which gives Roserade huge issues, and Slowbro can comfortably deal with Talonflame. Gengar, despite stacking a Psychic weakness, pairs well with Roserade due to Mega Gengar's ability to trap and remove walls like Cresselia, Chansey, and Blissey. It can also spread burns against common physical threats like Mega Kangaskhan, Garchomp, and Mega Mawile, which all trouble Roserade. Gyarados has great synergy with Roserade as well, handling Fire-types that give Roserade trouble and appreciating Roserade's ability to switch into Electric-type moves. In return, Roserade handles Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Azumarill for Mega Gyarados.</p>"

  "Lopunny": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Lopunny stands out in Battle Spot thanks to its excellent combination of a high Speed stat, a high Attack stat, and an unresisted STAB combination thanks to its ability, Scrappy. Fake Out is a great move that allows Mega Lopunny to safely Mega Evolve and deal damage in the process. The two top threats of the tier, Mega Kangaskhan and Aegislash, both fall to Mega Lopunny's powerful attacks; however, Aegislash can create mind games with King's Shield. Mega Lopunny is capable of weakening the foe with its powerful attacks so that its partner has an easier time to sweep. However, by running Mega Lopunny, you give up the ability to run many other great Mega Evolutions, namely Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Salamence, and Mega Mawile. Mega Lopunny is powerful, but not as powerful as the aforementioned threats and will fall short at times. Mega Lopunny's bulk is not outstanding either, and it will fall to powerful hits. To put it into perspective, whatever Mega Lopunny does not KO will KO it in return. Common Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, Mega Mawile, and Talonflame are threatening and are too hard for Mega Lopunny to handle.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Drain Punch provides a means of reliable recovery and has decent power, but Mega Lopunny is mainly used for demolishing the opposing team with High Jump Kick. Substitute + Encore allows the use of Focus Punch and can be very annoying to deal with because Mega Lopunny's high Speed ensures that it will likely lock a foe into a move. Substitute provides immunities to Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Intimidate. Power-Up Punch has the potential to turn Mega Lopunny into a near-unstoppable wallbreaker, but then Mega Lopunny sacrifices valuable coverage, and the raw power that Mega Lopunny packs is usually enough. Toxic cripples Cresselia, which annoys Mega Lopunny. Quick Attack helps pick off Choice Scarf Pokemon once they've been weakened, but Mega Lopunny is quite fast as it is and Quick Attack is generally not going to be used. Facade takes advantage of status to make Mega Lopunny insanely hard to wall; however, it's very dependent on the opponent's team and is generally an inconsistent move. If Ditto is a large concern, or you just stress about it coming in and taking Lopunny's Return, you could potentially run Frustration over Return, but this situation is quite uncommon. A Klutz + Assault Vest set is ill-advised because this wastes most of Lopunny's potential. Mega Lopunny is the main reason why normal Lopunny is viable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Cresselia is extremely common in Battle Spot and completely shrugs off anything Mega Lopunny can throw at it thanks to its neutrality to Return, resistance to High Jump Kick, and high physical bulk. Other physical walls, such as Mega Slowbro, Clefable, Mandibuzz, Quagsire, Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Suicune, are able to take Mega Lopunny's hits. These Pokemon all have a high Defense stat, are neutral to one or both of Mega Lopunny's STAB moves, and carry a form of recovery. Mega Lopunny will be unable to break through these Pokemon, although all of them dislike Toxic. These Pokemon can typically beat Mega Lopunny with a Scald, Psychic, Moonblast, Earthquake, or Toxic of their own. The best way to check Mega Lopunny with a defensive Pokemon is with a reliable wall that has a solid form of recovery; otherwise, Mega Lopunny could potentially wear them down.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate: Landorus-T is very common and can weaken Mega Lopunny with Intimidate. Despite being 4x weak to Ice Punch, Landorus-T can survive the hit and smack Mega Lopunny with Earthquake. Mawile, another Pokemon with Intimidate, can tank a High Jump Kick and OHKO in return with Play Rough. Salamence can come in on Fake Out, Mega Evolve, survive Ice Punch, and choose between setting up on Mega Lopunny and OHKOing it with Return. These Pokemon all tank Mega Lopunny's hits and soften up its attacks for teammates to have a much easier time taking it on. Mega Lopunny's only way to prevent Intimidate is through Substitute, which all Intimidate users are able to break through.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killing: Talonflame is the most common priority user in the tier and is capable of revenge killing Mega Lopunny easily with a powerful Brave Bird. Talonflame doesn't like Return too much, however, but it can switch in and revenge kill if need be. Choice Scarf Rotom-W can tank a hit and proceed to 2HKO Mega Lopunny with Hydro Pump. Choice Scarf Landorus-T 2HKOes with Earthquake and shrugs off Return with ease thanks to Intimidate. Garchomp can revenge kill with a Choice Scarf Outrage, but it heavily dislikes Ice Punch and is thus best to come in after another Pokemon has fainted. Blaziken is an excellent check thanks to Speed Boost and its ability to make High Jump Kick crash via Protect, and it can OHKO Mega Lopunny with Superpower easily. Choice Scarf is the best way to revenge kill Mega Lopunny, while priority is a viable method as well.</p>",

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out is an excellent move because it allows Lopunny to rack up damage the turn it Mega Evolves and safely allow it to gain a new, faster Speed tier. Fake Out's damage comes in handy because it makes Return and High Jump Kick much more likely to KO the foe after it's lost a bit of health from Fake Out. Return is a solid choice because it is a powerful STAB move that has no drawbacks, and can be safely used against most Pokemon. High Jump Kick is more powerful than Return and smacks Steel-types such as Heatran and Mega Mawile, both of which shrug off Fake Out and Return. Ice Punch hits the incredibly common Landorus-T and Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Mega Salamence for solid damage, thus rounding out Mega Lopunny's coverage. However, Ice Punch is unable to OHKO all three of these Pokemon without prior damage, preferably from a teammate. Baton Pass allows Mega Lopunny to safely pivot into a teammate and come back in later to abuse Fake Out again; however, it's a risky move because Landorus-T's or Mawile's Intimidate will punish Lopunny for using it. Substitute is an excellent choice in the last slot so that Mega Lopunny can avoid Intimidate and status, and it can be used on predicted switches. Mega Lopunny takes advantage of Encore due to its high Speed stat, eliminating mind games, and can lock opposing Pokemon into unfavorable moves, such as Aegislash with King's Shield. Mega Lopunny's last moveslot is very flexible and is suited to fit your team's needs. Utility moves such as Healing Wish or other coverage moves such as Fire Punch or Thunder Punch could be used if the need arises. Healing Wish, in particular, is useful for bringing in a weakened teammate with full health and giving them a second chance to sweep the opposing team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Lopunnite is the only item Lopunny should ever run, as it allows Lopunny to Mega Evolve and gain a large boost in Speed and power, along with an excellent ability in Scrappy. Limber prevents paralysis on Lopunny before it Mega Evolves, which means Lopunny could create potential mind games with Thunder Wave users. After Mega Evolving, Lopunny gains Scrappy, which is an excellent ability because it allows Mega Lopunny to use High Jump Kick without fearing Ghost-type Pokemon. A Jolly nature is chosen over an Adamant nature so that Mega Lopunny can get the jump on base 100 Speed Pokemon before Mega Evolving and outspeed Greninja after Mega Evolving. An Adamant nature could be used if your team packs Icy Wind, Rock Tomb, or Thunder Wave support in some form, as this nature does increase Mega Lopunny's damage output quite a bit, but it's generally unadvised. The only notable difference an Adamant nature makes is that Porygon2 falls to the combination of Fake Out and High Jump Kick, but it's left at a low amount of health either way. In the long run, a Jolly nature will almost always be more beneficial to Mega Lopunny than an Adamant nature.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Lopunny does well as a lead because it can weaken the opposing team so that more powerful teammates can come in later and take advantage of the worn-down team. Thanks to Scrappy, Fake Out is almost always guaranteed to break Focus Sash, further adding to the excellence of Mega Lopunny in the early-game. Random Protects ruin Mega Lopunny's day because it means that High Jump Kick will crash, so it's always best to scout for these Protects before using High Jump Kick if possible. Limber is very situational, and it's very risky to stay in base Lopunny forme, but it can fish for a Thunder Wave. It's often best to Mega Evolve regardless and inflict damage with Fake Out, then switch into a Ground-type partner to take the incoming Thunder Wave. The greatest use for Limber is when Lopunny is not in the lead position so that it can switch into Porygon2's Thunder Wave with impunity. Mega Evolve Lopunny as early in the match as possible, because without being Mega Evolved, Lopunny is less bulky and its Speed tier is much worse than Mega Lopunny's. Do note that using Mega Lopunny early in the game does not mean that you should sacrifice it. Mega Lopunny can be useful later in the match because of its Speed, allowing it to clean up teams itself. Realize the difference in power between High Jump Kick and Return. Return's power is solid, but High Jump Kick is much higher in Base Power, and it will do a lot more on neutral hits. This can be something players forget because High Jump Kick has risky accuracy, but the risk is almost always worth it in the end. Ghost-types are also unable to switch directly into High Jump Kick because of Scrappy, so teams with Mega Lopunny don't have to fear Ghost-types switching in! Always use Fake Out first; it only works on the first turn that Lopunny is sent out and will provide excellent chip damage. Fake Out is also great because it allows a turn for Lopunny to Mega Evolve, thus gaining a huge boost in Speed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Landorus-T is a good partner because it softens up attacks for Mega Lopunny and takes any Thunder Wave aimed at Mega Lopunny. The two create a powerful core that weakens physical walls together because of their high Attack stats. Landorus-T can even U-turn to get Mega Lopunny in safely! Aegislash has good synergy with Mega Lopunny, taking on Fighting-, Psychic-, and Fairy-type attacks with ease while Mega Lopunny is able to take on Dark- and Ghost-type attacks. Aegislash beats Cresselia, in particular, which is beneficial for Mega Lopunny. Later on, Mega Lopunny can bring Aegislash back in at full health via Healing Wish. Rotom-W safely pivots into Mega Lopunny via Volt Switch and is able to spread around burns, while taking on Landorus-T and Talonflame easily. Garchomp is also a good partner for Mega Lopunny thanks to its ability to set up Stealth Rock to cripple Talonflame, which Mega Lopunny greatly appreciates. Although running Tyranitar creates a double Fighting weakness, Tyranitar helps take down pesky Psychic-types with Pursuit or can set up a Dragon Dance against a weakened team. Sylveon is a powerful wallbreaker that has decent synergy with Mega Lopunny and appreciates the removal of Steel-types before attempting a sweep. Talonflame takes advantage of the removal of Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon on the field to spam Brave Bird without worry, and it beats Blaziken, a pesky revenge killer. Bisharp is a great partner because it dissuades Intimidate and can prey upon weakened teams via Sucker Punch or Knock Off.</p>"

  "Garchomp": {
    "overview": "<p>If you're looking for the mascot of Battle Spot Singles, look no further than Garchomp! Garchomp is nearly omnipresent, as it offers an excellent offensive typing in Dragon / Ground, a great ability in Rough Skin that can make KOing physical threats much easier, and nearly perfect stat distribution that makes it fast, powerful, and difficult to OHKO. However, what truly makes Garchomp a force to be reckoned with is its insane versatility. Garchomp laughs at Item Clause, as its viable items go into the double digits. Garchomp's usable item pool and movepool make it an extremely customizable Pokemon for most teams and rather difficult to directly counter. Garchomp is fully capable of claiming victory for your team just because your opponent might not have correctly guessed what kind of Garchomp you are using.</p> <p>Garchomp's only defining flaw is tied to its ubiquity: Garchomp is one of the most prepared-for Pokemon in Battle Spot Singles. Very few competent teams go without a game plan for Garchomp, so your Garchomp might be benched more often than you'd think. Overall though, Garchomp is extremely easy to fit in almost any team, and that quality makes it a true star of Battle Spot Singles!</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sand Veil is an interesting option if you have Sand Stream support from Tyranitar or Hippowdon. Missing an attack against Garchomp usually spells doom for frailer, more offensive Pokemon such as Greninja and Mega Lopunny! However, Rough Skin is usually still the superior ability due to its ability to let Garchomp get out of situations involving Mega Kangaskhan. If the Item Clause is just giving you too many problems, you can elect to use Draco Plate, Earth Plate, or Expert Belt to increase Garchomp's offensive power. Just note that Garchomp will lose out on key KOs compared to Garchomp running Life Orb or Garchompite. On the support side of things, Roar can be used to help Garchomp scout its checks and other members of the opposing team. Dragon Tail can do the same while providing an extra bit of damage, but unfortunately, Fairy-types are immune to it. Dragon Rush might seem like an appealing move, especially with Hone Claws. However, the miss chance is too great to be reliable, and a Swords Dance-boosted Dual Chop is more powerful than a Hone Claws-boosted Dragon Rush.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Locking Garchomp Into Outrage: While not a direct way to check Garchomp, locking it into Outrage by baiting it with Levitate users exposes Garchomp to being revenge killed or set up on by Steel- and Fairy-types.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory, while not common outside of stall teams, can wall most Garchomp to heck and back, wear it down with Toxic and Rocky Helmet, and just force it out with Whirlwind if it attempts to boost. Just be warned: Fire Blast can score a surprise 2HKO on Skarmory!</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ice Beam Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Cresselia, Porygon2, Slowbro, Mega Slowbro, and Suicune can take on unboosted attacks from Garchomp and nearly OHKO it with Ice Beam. Note, however, that these Pokemon are extremely vulnerable to Yache Berry Garchomp and take a huge amount of damage from boosted Outrage.</p> <p><strong>Togekiss: While Togekiss isn't especially common in Battle Spot Singles, it can be a huge problem for Garchomp, being immune to both of its STAB types. Dazzling Gleam does a ton of damage to Garchomp and can be especially worrying if coming from the faster Choice Scarf Togekiss. However, Togekiss is 2HKOed by Rock-type attacks most of the time.</p> <p><strong>Mamoswine</strong>: While Mamoswine can't switch into Garchomp, it's a fairly effective Garchomp check. Life Orb and Choice Band-boosted Ice Shards do a ton of damage to Garchomp while bypassing its Speed. Worst of all, if Mamoswine gets a chance to use Icicle Spear (usually thanks to Focus Sash or Choice Scarf), it can bypass Focus Sash and Yache Berry and OHKO Garchomp anyways!</p> <p><strong>Greninja and Weavile</strong>: Amongst the frail offensive checks to Garchomp, Greninja and Weavile get special merit for outspeeding and OHKOing even Yache Berry Garchomp with a Life Orb-boosted Ice Beam and Icicle Crash, respectively. However, Choice Scarf Garchomp can smash these two with Outrage (though Garchomp must watch out for Weavile's Ice Shard), while Focus Sash Garchomp can nab a surprise KO on them.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Garchomp heavily relies on its Speed to beat offensive threats, so as soon as Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Mega Salamence, Latios, and Hidden Power Ice Thundurus start roaming around, Garchomp will have a harder time sweeping! Just note, Focus Sash Garchomp and Yache or Haban Berry Garchomp can ruin these plans!</p> <p><strong>Aegislash: Aegislash isn't a particularly good Garchomp check on paper, but against weaker, non-boosting variants, it can be a menace. Earthquake won't be able to OHKO a healthy Aegislash, but it will activate Weakness Policy, allowing Aegislash to OHKO Garchomp! Garchomp's other moves do little damage to Aegislash, so against weaker Garchomp, Aegislash can use them as a clinch way to set up a sweep!</p>",

        "name": "Lurechomp",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This is the Garchomp to use if you want to take advantage of its versatility and mind game-playing power! Earthquake is Garchomp's strong, reliable STAB move and its way of tearing up Steel-types. Outrage is riskier because it locks Garchomp in, but it provides an immense amount of immediate power and slams Levitate users and Flying-types particularly hard. The third moveslot is generally open for one of Garchomp's support moves. While Stealth Rock can be a bit difficult to use in Battle Spot Singles, Garchomp is one of the best users of the entry hazard thanks to its reasonable bulk and offensive presence. Swords Dance, on the other hand, gives Garchomp potent sweeping power, especially late-game! A third option is Toxic. While Toxic may seem like an oddball choice on an offensive Pokemon, running it on Garchomp can be an effective way to cripple Porygon2 and Cresselia.</p> <p>The fourth moveslot is where the customization begins full force! Rock Tomb might seem rather weak, but in addition to smashing Talonflame without locking Garchomp into Outrage, it provides speed control, which can screw up desperate Garchomp switch-ins such as Greninja. If you prefer slightly more power and the ability to cause foes to flinch, Rock Slide is a reasonable alternative. Stone Edge is Garchomp's most powerful Rock-type attack, but it comes with the cost of having the highest miss rate.</p> <p>If Rock-type moves don't fit your team, Dragon Claw gives Garchomp a reliable Dragon-type STAB move to hit weakened foes such as Mega Salamence and Hydreigon. If you run Swords Dance, Dual Chop becomes the more attractive option, because unlike Dragon Claw, Dual Chop can smash through Focus Sash Pokemon after a boost. Just note, opposing Rocky Helmet users become more of an issue when running Dual Chop, and it has a 10% chance to miss. While not particularly strong, Fire Blast is also a good option, as it 2HKOes Skarmory and Ferrothorn. Finally, if you just can't decide between Stealth Rock and Swords Dance, using both is actually a viable possibility, giving Garchomp both early-game and late-game utility. However, this comes at a serious cost: you will have to choose between making Garchomp far easier to revenge kill due to Outrage and severely reducing Garchomp's immediate power with Dual Chop.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Garchomp's given nature and EVs maximize its Speed and Attack, while Rough Skin allows Garchomp to get some extra damage in via switching into contact moves (especially painful in Mega Kangaskhan's case). If you want a bit of extra power for Fire Blast and aren't using a Yache Berry, feel free to use a Naive nature.</p> <p>There are many items to choose from for this Garchomp. While Focus Sash might seem a bit strange to use considering Garchomp's bulk, Garchomp still happens to be one of the most effective Focus Sash users in the game, thanks to its sandstorm immunity and offensive power! This item gives Garchomp an edge against many foes early-game, especially if you need to set up Stealth Rock. If you manage to hold onto Focus Sash later in the game, Garchomp can act as an emergency check to many offensive threats and can even set up a surprise Swords Dance, potentially devastating your opponent's team! If you want Garchomp to have more late-game value, Lum Berry is an excellent choice. A common way to deal with Garchomp is to burn it with Pokemon such as Rotom-W. With Lum Berry and Swords Dance, Garchomp can set up on and devastate some of these threats when they are weakened. It also allows Garchomp to act as an emergency Spore absorber against Breloom. If you want to take advantage of Rough Skin, consider using Rocky Helmet Garchomp. With a Rocky Helmet in tow, most Pokemon will take 24% damage from touching Garchomp, which can be enough to push some foes into its KO range. In particular, Mega Kangaskhan takes a devastating 58% damage, which can potentially save you from this fearsome monster! If you thirst for more specialized luring power, Yache Berry should be on the top of your list. Most non-STAB Ice-type moves will fail to OHKO Garchomp when it holds a Yache Berry, allowing Swords Dance Garchomp to potentially smash through some of its checks! If you are more worried about faster Dragon-types, Haban Berry can work as well. Finally, if you just want to give Garchomp some added bulk, Leftovers can work just fine. Just remember, Leftovers will give away Garchomp's item immediately, reducing its mind gaming power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If you're using Garchomp as a lead, Focus Sash is recommended, as it gives Garchomp the edge versus possible leading checks such as Life Orb Greninja. Try to set up Stealth Rock if your opponent has Pokemon that are greatly harmed by entry hazards, such as Focus Sash Breloom and Talonflame. Regardless of what Garchomp variant you are using, just try to do as much lasting damage to the opponent's team as possible. As long as Garchomp doesn't get KOed before it can do any damage, it will usually have done its job. Just make sure that, when using Garchomp earlier in the game, you don't overly rely on Garchomp to defeat a certain threat!</p> <p>If you plan on using Swords Dance, Garchomp usually becomes more effective later in the game. The key to making Garchomp a sweeping force late-game is to try as hard as possible to keep Garchomp's item hidden. Garchomp is at its most dangerous when your opponent has as little information as possible, as your opponent guessing Garchomp's item incorrectly can lead your team to victory! Tactics to maximize Garchomp's luring power include scouting your opponent's team for their Garchomp checks and switching Garchomp into attacks that don't give away its item, such as Electric-type moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Garchomp set is extremely easy to fit on most teams, thanks to its versatility. While Garchomp will enjoy teammates that can take care of foes such as Porygon2, Cresselia, Greninja, and Mega Salamence, the point of this set is less about being the star of your team and more about supporting your team in key ways. In general, you should pair Garchomp up with teammates that benefit from its item-based mind games. For example, using Focus Sash Garchomp can free up teamslots thanks to its increased checking power. Using Lum Berry Garchomp to smash through Will-O-Wisp-using checks is great news for physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan. Rocky Helmet Garchomp, on the other hand, pairs up well with Pokemon that fear Mega Kangaskhan. Finally, Yache Berry Garchomp tends to pair well with Pokemon that prefer having fast Hidden Power users such as Thundurus and bulkier Ice Beam users such as Porygon2 and Cresselia out of the way.</p> <p>Most fast, offensive Pokemon will enjoy Stealth Rock support aiding their cleaning capabilities, especially Pokemon that want Talonflame and Charizard out of the way (as both take 50% from Stealth Rock). Offensive Fighting-types love Stealth Rock support, as having Talonflame out of way greatly increases their offensive presence, and they can even help deal with Porygon2 for Garchomp. Blaziken can switch into weak Ice-type attacks and provide potent sweeping power with Speed Boost, while Heracross is one of the few Fighting-types that can muscle past Cresselia for Garchomp. Aegislash helps deal with Cresselia, can switch into super effective attacks for Garchomp, and has an easier time sweeping weakened teams with Shadow Sneak when Stealth Rock is up. While it doesn't have as much synergy with Garchomp, Belly Drum Azumarill also appreciates Stealth Rock's support in getting the residual damage it needs to sweep a team.</p> <p>While Swords Dance tends to be one of this set's more situational moves, supporting Garchomp's sweeping power is not a bad idea if you can fit in teammates for it. Paralysis support is a good idea no matter what item Garchomp is running, as paralyzing faster threats can conserve Garchomp's Focus Sash or, if running another item, simply make Garchomp even harder to check! Bulky Thunder Wave users such as Porygon2, Gyarados, and Ferrothorn will work just fine for this role. If you prefer a more direct answer to defensive Pokemon, Mega Gengar is one of the best teammates available! Shadow Tag allows Mega Gengar to toy with defensive threats through the use of tools such as Destiny Bond and Taunt, and it has the bonus of being able to wear down physical threats with Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

Just remember, Outrage leaves Garchomp very vulnerable to revenge killing. Most Choice Band Garchomp will want to carry a safer, secondary Dragon-type attack to avoid situations where Outrage Garchomp makes Garchomp setup bait. Dual Chop works fantastically here. Thanks to Choice Band, Dual Chop can actually OHKO some Pokemon, such as opposing Garchomp and Greninja, through their Focus Sash, preventing Garchomp from being revenge killed so easily! As a bonus, it can also deal good damage to Pokemon that use Substitute. If your team has residual damage support or you're worried about Dual Chop's 10% miss rate and Rocky Helmet users, you can use Dragon Claw instead.</p> <p>The final moveslot is saved for Garchomp's more situational options. The most common option is a Rock-type move. Rock Slide allows Garchomp to OHKO Thundurus and maximum HP Talonflame and 2HKO Zapdos without resorting to Outrage. While Rock Slide's flinch chance can be handy, Stone Edge is a reasonable choice if you aren't worried about its 20% chance to miss, as it has significantly more power than Rock Slide. Rock Tomb can help get some surprise wins thanks to its ability to lower the foe's Speed, but Zapdos can unfortunately avoid a 2HKO from Rock Tomb.</p> <p>If Rock-type attacks don't suit your fancy, Garchomp has more tricks up its sleeve! Poison Jab might seem redundant because Azumarill takes almost as much damage from Earthquake, but because Garchomp is running Choice Band Poison Jab can allow Garchomp to OHKO Azumarill and then finish off weakened Levitate users and Flying-type threats. Fire Fang does more damage to Ferrothorn than Garchomp's other options do, while Fire Blast can be used to nab a potential 2HKO against Skarmory. Toxic, while usually ill-fitting for a Choice set, is notable for crippling Porygon2 and Cresselia switch-ins, which is especially useful because both of them can be 2HKOed by Outrage with some residual damage!</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Choice Band is obviously needed here, as it's the theme of the set! A Jolly nature with maximum Attack and Speed investment is needed for Garchomp to slam many of Battle Spot Singles's faster threats, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y. Rough Skin is preferred over Sand Veil, as the residual damage of Rough Skin can get Garchomp some extra KOs.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It might seem tempting to immediately try to plough through your opponent's team with Outrage, but keep that trigger finger steady; using Outrage early-game will usually lead to a KOed Garchomp and not much to show for it! Generally, Earthquake and Dual Chop or Dragon Claw will be the moves you use earlier in the game, depending on your opponent's team.</p> <p>Choice Band Garchomp tends to be at its most dangerous later in the game, especially if your opponent is carrying Pokemon that are immune to Ground and Dragon. Knowing what your opponent has chosen makes Choice Band Garchomp less prone to being set up on. Most importantly, though, Choice Band Garchomp excels at smashing through weakened teams. Try to get your opponent's team weakened by chip damage so Garchomp can clean up with its Choice Band-boosted Outrage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>The first and most easy kind of support is paralysis support. Garchomp might be fast, but faster Pokemon can often stop Garchomp right in its tracks. Pokemon such as Porygon2, Gyarados, and Ferrothorn are reasonable choices for bulky Thunder Wave users. For a more offensive twist on this kind of support, Thundurus can use its Prankster Thunder Wave to cripple fast, offensive threats. While Tailwind can be harder to pull off due to its time limit, it can be used late in the game as a suicidal move of sorts to give Garchomp the last push it needs to sweep a team! Talonflame is usually your best choice for a clutch Tailwind user.</p> <p>The tougher, but still rewarding, kind of support Choice Band Garchomp loves is residual damage. With just a bit of extra damage, Garchomp gains the ability to 2HKO common switch-ins such as Cresselia and Porygon2 with Outrage! The easiest way to pull this off is to pair Garchomp with good users of Will-O-Wisp and Toxic. Rotom-W is one of the best users of Will-O-Wisp users around, and it even provides Garchomp with a teammate that resists Ice. Talonflame is much more frail, but it tends to lure in Porygon2 and Cresselia more often, and Talonflame's priority Brave Bird can smash up faster offensive threats for Garchomp. Mega Gengar is in a similar boat to Talonflame, but it has the bonus of Shadow Tag to toy with defensive threats. Almost every Pokemon learns Toxic, so feel free to use it on more unexpected (but viable) Pokemon to support Garchomp! Finally, Stealth Rock can be tough to set up, but it often does enough damage to turn 3HKOs into 2HKOs for Garchomp! If you can't fit status support on your team, you can use Tyranitar or Hippowdon for their Sand Stream Unlike status moves, Sand Stream requires no moveslots or particularly careful planning to use, but unfortunately, several of Garchomp's checks, Suicune and Mamoswine, also give Tyranitar and Hippowdon problems.</p>"

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Outrage is integral to Choice Scarf Garchomp's success. While it's a move that must be used sparingly, its power and STAB boost allow Garchomp to become a dangerous sweeper against weakened teams. Outrage also differentiates Garchomp from the other Ground-type Choice Scarf users: Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Mamoswine. Earthquake is Garchomp's less risky STAB attack and main weapon for burying Steel-type Pokemon. A Rock-type attack is heavily recommended, as using Outrage against Flying-types too early can spell doom for Garchomp. Rock Slide fits perfectly on Choice Scarf Garchomp. While it's rather weak, it still nabs an OHKO against Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, and its 30% flinch rate can get Garchomp out of some tricky situations. Stone Edge's 20% chance to miss can be absolutely brutal, but the extra power is welcomed on this set. Stone Edge is Garchomp's only chance of OHKOing Thundurus outside of Outrage, and it can also 2HKO Zapdos switch-ins with a bit of residual damage. If you only care about shattering Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, Rock Tomb can be used for its Speed-dropping capabilities in emergencies.</p> <p>The last slot can be a bit of a toss-up depending on what you need to hit the most. Dragon Claw offers Garchomp a more reliable Dragon-type attack to use and is an especially valuable tool when picking off weakened Dragon-types and Pokemon immune to Earthquake. Dual Chop is usually the lesser option on Choice Scarf Garchomp, because unlike other sets, it doesn't have the power to break through most Focus Sash Pokemon, and the 10% chance to miss plus the extra Rocky Helmet damage can be worrisome. However, if you are especially worried about Substitute Pokemon and extremely frail Focus Sash users such as Smeargle, Dual Chop may fit your team better.</p> <p>If the lower power and more situational use of Garchomp's secondary Dragon-type move or Rock-type move don't appeal to you, Garchomp has some more options that may fit your team better. Toxic is normally a silly move on a Choice Pokemon, but Choice Scarf Garchomp's problems with defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Cresselia are so severe that it becomes viable to use earlier in the game. Poison Jab, while only slightly more powerful against Fairy-types than Earthquake is, hits Flying-types, making it a game-winning move to be locked into in a few situations! Garchomp's final option is Fire Blast; it is a weak move that can be dangerous to be locked into, but it's Garchomp's best shot against Skarmory and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rough Skin is the best ability for weakening Pokemon that rely on contact moves, while a Jolly nature and the listed EV spread give Garchomp the Speed and power it needs to be an effective user of Choice Scarf. Unlike on other Garchomp sets, Adamant is a reasonable nature to consider here. An Adamant nature allows Choice Scarf Garchomp to rampage through weaker teams more easily, but makes Garchomp a less effective revenge killer. At best, Adamant Choice Scarf Garchomp Speed ties with Jolly Choice Scarf Excadrill, and it loses its ability to revenge kill potentially faster threats such as both Mega Charizard, Mega Blaziken, and Hydreigon if they have a Speed boost of any kind.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Garchomp is at its most effective later in the game, when you know what Pokemon your opponent has chosen and they have been weakened enough to get picked off by Garchomp. The other big reason to keep Garchomp in hiding is the surprise value Choice Scarf offers. Try to KO slower Pokemon so you don't reveal Garchomp's item. This can goad your opponent into switching in a fast revenge killer, only for them to suffer two devastating consecutive KOs!</p> <p>This isn't to say that Choice Scarf Garchomp shouldn't be used for revenge killing, though, as its Speed can save your team against a wide variety of sweepers. However, blindly revenge killing Pokemon can easily end in disaster for Garchomp, as this set is especially vulnerable to being set up on or revenge killed. Once again, saving Choice Scarf Garchomp until later will help you decide if your other two chosen Pokemon can handle Garchomp getting set up on. Blindly revenge killing Pokemon with Garchomp is usually only recommended if you feel that you have no other choices.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Garchomp has huge problems against most stall teams. Often times, it's best to just leave Garchomp unselected if you come across them, as this set offers almost no wallbreaking power. This Garchomp set is better off being sent out against more offensively based teams that have a difficult time dealing with Choice Scarf Garchomp's surprise value.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Garchomp has one very serious problem that needs to be addressed: its issues against defensive Pokemon. Garchomp is a sitting duck against most of Battle Spot Singles's defensive Pokemon, so pairing up Garchomp with wallbreakers is a necessity. When it comes to wallbreakers, Mega Gengar is a fantastic choice. Thanks to Shadow Tag, it can trap the walls that plague Garchomp and either toy with them via its status moves, take them down directly, or even use Taunt and Destiny Bond to ensure that they won't block Garchomp's attempts at sweeping! If you desire bulkier wallbreakers, Taunt Gyarados, Mega Mawile, and Mega Heracross can work well, too.</p>"

        "name": "Versatile Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Garchomp's reliable damage dealer, avoiding Rocky Helmet damage and demolishing most Steel-types. Outrage, thanks to the Life Orb boost, deals a ton of damage to any offensive Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Swords Dance boosts Garchomp's already high Attack to explosive levels, allowing Garchomp to OHKO Rotom-W with Outrage and deal over 70% to Porygon2 and Cresselia. Setting up Swords Dance can be a bit difficult, though, so if you prefer to, you can replace Swords Dance with Substitute. Substitute might seem strange with Life Orb, but it can ease prediction and harm Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Mawile's ability to pick off Garchomp with Sucker Punch. If you're worried about Life Orb recoil limiting Garchomp's early-game potential, you can use Toxic to cripple Garchomp's more defensive switch-ins. If none of these support or sweeping options appeal to you, Garchomp can also simply run another attack for more coverage.</p> <p>The last move depends on what targets you want Garchomp to slam the hardest. Dual Chop is a less risky move than Outrage, and thanks to the power increase and potential Swords Dance boost, it can bust through Focus Sash Pokemon that would normally stop Garchomp's sweep. Garchomp might have mediocre Special Attack, but Draco Meteor can be a great option for surprising some of Garchomp's physically defensive switch-ins. Most notably, it also means that Mega Salamence won't be able survive Garchomp's Dragon-type moves after Intimidate. If you are worried about Ferrothorn and Skarmory, Fire Blast 2HKOes both of them while avoiding Rocky Helmet damage. Finally, Garchomp can run a Rock-type attack to get around Flying-type Pokemon hoping to switch in on an Earthquake. While Stone Edge has a nasty habit of missing, it's the preferred option because after a Swords Dance, it's able to OHKO defensive Zapdos. If you care more about Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, you can run Rock Slide, which can cause foes to flinch, or Rock Tomb, which provides speed control.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rough Skin is Garchomp's best ability due to the residual damage it causes, and maximum Attack and Speed are needed to make Garchomp effective. If you're only using physical moves, go with a Jolly nature. If you decide to use special moves, use a Naive nature, as Garchomp cares more about taking priority attacks than Ice Beams, and Life Orb will wear down Garchomp anyways.</p> <p>Life Orb boosts Garchomp's power while still giving it the freedom to switch moves. However, if you aren't able to fit Life Orb in due to Item Clause but still want its versatility and power, there is one solution: Garchompite. Mega Garchomp has almost as much physical power as Life Orb Garchomp does, and its dramatically increased Special Attack makes it a more effective mixed attacker. This comes at a serious cost, though: Mega Garchomp loses 10 base Speed, letting it get outsped by important Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and both Mega Charizard. If you feel you need to dedicate a Mega slot for Mega Garchomp, make sure you give it speed control support!</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set makes Garchomp an extremely hard hitter without locking it in with a Choice item, making Garchomp very difficult to switch into! The beauty of this Garchomp set is not only its attacking versatility, but its ability to adapt to the flow of the match. This Garchomp can function fine earlier in the game, with Life Orb giving Garchomp enough power to become a threat before setting up! Using a low-risk attack can be perfect for scouting the Pokemon your opponent has chosen. However, because Life Orb recoil puts Garchomp's lifespan on a countdown, feel free to use Swords Dance or Toxic earlier in the game if your opponent has more defensive checks to Garchomp.</p> <p>Garchomp may work fine in the earlier stages of the game, but late-game is where it becomes especially brutal. Because many of Garchomp's defensive checks take a massive amount of damage after a Swords Dance, try to put pressure on them with your other Pokemon. Forcing Pokemon such as Cresselia out with even 70% of their health can allow Garchomp to OHKO them with a boosted Outrage! Just make sure you avoid Fairy-type Pokemon in this case, as a common desperation tactic is to goad Garchomp into Outrage to make it setup bait for Azumarill or Mega Mawile.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>A major part of what makes this Garchomp so deadly is its ability to defeat its common defensive checks with some previous damage. While you can maintain this with simple offensive pressure, you can also elect to use Will-O-Wisp or Toxic support. On the Will-O-Wisp front, Rotom-W is one of the easiest Pokemon to fit on teams, while Talonflame can lure in some of Garchomp's defensive checks. Most defensive Pokemon make fine use of Toxic, but putting it on offensive but viable users such as offensive Porygon2 and Aegislash can be a good way to lure in Garchomp's defensive checks!</p> <p>Life Orb's awesome power unfortunately doesn't solve Garchomp's problems against faster revenge killers. This makes speed control an effective tactic that can allow Garchomp to blast through more offensive teams! Thunder Wave support is the easiest option here, as a multitude of bulky Pokemon such as Porygon2, Gyarados, and Ferrothorn are effective users of it. On the more risky and clutch side, Tailwind can be used at the right moment to devastate weakened teams. Talonflame is the best user of Tailwind, because while Talonflame doesn't last long, Gale Wings usually ensures that it fire off a Tailwind before it goes down.</p> <p>Just because Garchomp can now bust through some of its defensive checks doesn't mean that they aren't a problem, especially if you aren't using Swords Dance! Garchomp heavily relies on boosted Outrages to slam defensive Pokemon, making it extremely vulnerable to Steel- and Fairy-types stopping its sweep. This makes Mega Gengar an amazing Pokemon to directly deal with these defensive Pokemon! Mega Gengar can trap most defensive Pokemon and use a combination of Taunt and Destiny Bond to effectively remove them from the game, allowing Garchomp to get away with sweeping using its less powerful options more often! Other wallbreakers such as Mega Heracross, Taunt Gyarados, and Mega Mawile are also good teammates.</p>"

  "Lucario": {
    "overview": "<p>Lucario functions as a lethal late-game sweeper with the stats and movepool to run either physical, special, or even mixed sets. When backed up by its Mega Evolution's ability, Adaptability, it becomes a nightmare for defensively oriented teams to face. Despite its Fighting / Steel typing giving it a plethora of resistances, however, it does not have the bulk to take advantage of this and will fall to even neutral STAB attacks. Depending on the set, Lucario may be forced to rely on STAB moves that have relatively poor accuracy such as Iron Tail and Focus Blast. Although it has access to nice coverage options such as Ice Punch, Lucario fails to make proper use of them despite its good Speed stat due to the prevalence of Focus Sash and Choice Scarf on common Ground-types, which can easily KO it with STAB Earthquake. Lucario often faces tough competition from fellow Fighting-types such as Blaziken, which has superior STAB coverage and Speed without needing to Mega Evolve, but with Extreme Speed and other STAB priority options, Lucario becomes less prone to getting revenge killed by priority moves such as Brave Bird and Aqua Jet. Additionally, Blaziken lacks a reliable Fighting-type STAB move like Close Combat, so it will often need to rely on High Jump Kick and Superpower, which sometimes holds it back.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Bullet Punch is boosted by Adaptability and can be used over Extreme Speed if hitting Gengar seems more appealing to the team. However, the ability to hit Fire-types is better overall. On the Nasty Plot set, Hidden Power Ice might seem like an odd choice but can score surprising KOs against Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Salamence as well as Gliscor, which Ice Punch fails to KO. Earthquake is an option to hit Aegislash without the fear of King's Shield, but it can only OHKO it after a Swords Dance boost. Substitute sacrifices some HP to help Lucario avoid status from foes such as Rotom-W and allows it to beat Blaziken in a one-on-one situation. Stone Edge allows Mega Lucario to OHKO Thundurus, which Ice Punch fails to do, while also hitting Zapdos and other Fire-types such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona harder than any other moves. A Naive nature with a spread of 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe can be used on a specially offensive set if you decide to run Close Combat over Focus Blast or Aura Sphere, as it still is able to KO Heatran and Chansey reliably. Protect can be used to allow Lucario to safely Mega Evolve, but this comes at the cost of a coverage move. Thunder Punch is an option to nail Gyarados more reliably than Stone Edge. Focus Sash is an option for an item, given that Lucario has immunity to residual damage such as sand while also having Inner Focus, which prevents it from flinching. However, it is largely outclassed by Lucarionite, as such a set is significantly weaker.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Aegislash: Aegislash has an easy time walling non-Earthquake and Dark Pulse Lucario while being able to retaliate with STAB Shadow Ball or KO with Sacred Sword.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos resists both of Lucario's STAB types and boasts high defenses, and it is able to Roost off any damage and then KO back with Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Gyarados and Slowbro</strong>: Gyarados can easily set up on Lucario with Intimidate, resists its STAB types as well as most of its coverage moves, and is able to outspeed Lucario after one Dragon Dance. Slowbro threatens to burn with Scald or paralyze with Thunder Wave while taking nothing from physical Mega Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Mega Gengar and Mega Sableye have no problem dealing with physical variants of Lucario, as they are able to cripple it with burn and can freely come in on a predicted Close Combat, but Mega Gengar is OHKOed by Iron Tail. Special variants of Lucario have an easier time against Gengar that lack Focus Blast or Will-O-Wisp + Hex, as Flash Cannon is a clean 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp and Landorus-T, Choice Band Talonflame, and Blaziken can all revenge kill Lucario with ease. However, they need to be relatively healthy to do so, as Lucario has access to priority and hits extremely hard after a boost.</p> <p><strong>Status: Common status users including Rotom-W and Thundurus are able to cripple Lucario for the rest of the match with burn or paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Common Focus Sash users include Mamoswine, Garchomp, and Breloom, all of which can ruin Lucario's sweep, which is why Stealth Rock support is important.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers: Lucario is unable to OHKO Mega Mawile and Azumarill, while they threaten to KO back with their STAB moves; however, Mega Mawile is OHKOed by Close Combat after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Prominent Fire-types seen in Battle Spot including Talonflame, Blaziken, Mega Charizard X and Y, and Volcarona can all threaten to OHKO Lucario while resisting its STAB types. Do note that none of these can safely switch into Lucario directly and can only revenge kill Lucario when it is unboosted.</p>",

        "name": "Physical",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Close Combat is Lucario's strongest and most reliable move and can deal massive amounts of damage to even foes that resist it such as Talonflame and Thundurus when boosted by STAB and Adaptability. Iron Tail is a necessary secondary STAB move used to hit Ghost-types such as Sableye, eliminate bulky Fairy-types like Clefable and Sylveon, and serve as Lucario's best option against Mega Venusaur. Extreme Speed offers Lucario a move with +2 priority, allowing it to pick off weakened targets such as Talonflame before they can use Roost or retaliate with priority Brave Bird. Swords Dance helps Lucario get past bulky threats such as Cresselia better, allows it to net more OHKOs with Close Combat on Garchomp and Rotom-W, and makes Extreme Speed able to threaten faster foes such as Greninja and Talonflame. Ice Punch can be used over Swords Dance as a coverage move to hit bulky Ground-types such as Garchomp and Landorus-T as well as Thundurus.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Jolly nature should always be used with maximum investment in Attack and Speed to allow Lucario to hit the crucial base 112 Speed tier while providing maximum damage output. Lucarionite is mandatory, as it provides a substantial boost to Lucario's offenses and Speed while giving it Adaptability, allowing its STAB moves to be even more threatening. Inner Focus lets Lucario reliably beat Mega Kangaskhan prior to Mega Evolution due to its immunity to flinching from Fake Out. Justified can also be used for a +1 boost in Attack if you can predict a Dark-type move; however, Lucario is usually too frail to be switching into any attacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is generally a bad idea to start the match with Lucario, as it has a bad matchup against common leads in the metagame such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mamoswine, which all threaten to OHKO it with their STAB moves while potentially carrying Focus Sash. Therefore, opposing Focus Sash should be broken and Choice Scarf users must be scouted properly by teammates in order to make the most use of Lucario's late-game sweeping capability. As Lucario is rather slow prior to Mega Evolution, it's best brought in on a free turn such as a Choice-locked Outrage or a predicted Trick, usually from lead Rotom-W. Swords Dance must be used with caution, even on foes Lucario threatens out like Kangaskhan, because if you predict incorrectly, Lucario will easily fall to Earthquake or incur a status such as paralysis from Chansey. It might be reasonable to let Lucario sit out if Team Preview seems too unfavorable with bulky Ground-types, Fire-types, Aegislash, and Thundurus on the same team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hippowdon is one of the best partners for Lucario, as it is able to function as a lead for setting up sand and Stealth Rock, which can break Focus Sash and Sturdy and allows Lucario's +2 Extreme Speed to OHKO Talonflame. Hippowdon is also a nice check to Fire-types, which threaten Lucario, and its access to Yawn will provide Lucario more chances to set up Swords Dance. Dragonite and Lucario form a nice core because Dragonite attracts Dragon- and Fairy-types that Lucario can take advantage of to set up while Dragonite can set up on a potential Choice-locked Earthquake user that would take out Lucario. Latios is able to set up screens for Lucario and also attracts Dark-type moves such as Knock Off, which will give Lucario a free boost if it is running Justified. Although it usually prefers to run different moves, Latios also has access to Memento, which, alongside dual screens, will make Lucario extremely hard to take down if the foe stays in. Both Greninja and Thundurus can weaken the opposing team with their superb coverage for Lucario to potentially sweep, and Thundurus is also able to cripple the opposing team with Prankster Thunder Wave; in turn, Lucario can easily help them get rid of bulky attackers like Mega Kangaskhan and tanks including Porygon2, Chansey, and Blissey. Lucario appreciates Landorus-T's ability to remove Talonflame and threaten Aegislash while also providing Intimidate support and being able to U-turn out for momentum.</p>"

        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Nasty Plot Lucario is less susceptible to burn and is able to get past Intimidate users such as Salamence better. Aura Sphere is a reliable Fighting-type STAB move that will never miss, which is especially useful against Minimize Chansey, as special Lucario fails to OHKO it without Close Combat. Focus Blast is a viable option over Aura Sphere with a noticeable increase in power and the ability to OHKO Heatran and Porygon2 as well as OHKO Chansey and Thundurus at +2, but it can be rather unreliable due to poor accuracy. Flash Cannon gives Lucario vital coverage against Fairy-types that resist Fighting and also allows it to hit all Ghost-types bar Aegislash more reliably. Thanks to Adaptability, Vacuum Wave is an 80-Base Power priority move that can be used against faster foes such as Greninja, Lopunny, and Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon. Dark Pulse offers nice coverage if you decide to forgo priority, as it is able to hit Slowbro and Aegislash, but it has little utility outside of this due to failing to OHKO Aegislash even at +2.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature along with maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed allows Lucario to hit as hard as possible while taking advantage of its decent Speed tier. The remaining 4 EVs should be allocated to Special Defense, which is useful for preventing Porygon2 from acquiring a Special Attack boost from Download before Lucario Mega Evolves. Lucarionite is a must to allow Lucario to Mega Evolve, increasing its offenses, Speed, and Defense and giving it Adaptability to further increase its damage output with its STAB moves. Inner Focus is the best ability for Lucario prior to Mega Evolution to prevent flinching from Fake Out users like Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Lucario should always look to Mega Evolve whenever possible, as it is unable to do much in its default forme unless directly faced against a Fake Out user. Do not carelessly bring Lucario in on any attacks, as even resisted hits will do decent amounts of damage due to its relatively poor bulk even after Mega Evolving. Because this set is less crippled by burn, it can set up Nasty Plot on Rotom-W, which is likely to spend one turn burning Lucario before switching. Nasty Plot Mega Lucario has a fantastic matchup against defensively oriented teams, especially against Chansey and Skarmory, which rely heavily on Toxic to do damage and are both unable to use Counter against this set. Lucario should be brought in once the opposing team has been weakened considerably enough for it to clean up during later stages of the match.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Garchomp provides Lucario with Stealth Rock, weakens the opposing team with its powerful STAB moves, and also has the ability to slow down switch-ins with Rock Tomb so Lucario has an easier time coming in. Hippowdon checks Fire-types like Talonflame and Mega Charizard X while also being able to break potential Focus Sashes with Stealth Rock or sandstorm damage. Stealth Rock support is particularly useful for breaking the dreaded Focus Sash, which is rather common on some Pokemon such as Mamoswine. Dragonite works well with Lucario, as Lucario is able to easily revenge kill Protean Greninja, which OHKOes Dragonite with Ice Beam even with Multiscale intact, with Vacuum Wave. A core of Hippowdon, Dragonite, and Lucario works very well, as Hippowdon is able to provide the other two with Stealth Rock support and create opportunities to set up through Yawn. Stall-oriented teams will find it very difficult to successfully wall both physical Dragonite and specially offensive Mega Lucario. Talonflame can lead and then U-turn out on its counters such as Rotom-W and Tyranitar, which Lucario is able to set up Nasty Plot on. Mega Gengar is a fantastic teammate due to its ability to trap and remove Cresselia, Slowbro, and Azumarill, which are notable threats to Lucario prior to gaining boosts. Thundurus and Zapdos do a fantastic job at removing Pokemon on Flying-type spam teams such as Talonflame and Salamence as well as bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Gyarados, while Lucario is able to eliminate Ice- and Rock-types that they are weak to. Klefki can provide Lucario with dual screen support and also has access to Prankster Thunder Wave, which can slow down faster threats such as Blaziken and Gengar. Although in an unconventional manner, Klefki can beat a lot of physically offensive threats such as Mega Charizard X and Garchomp through a combination of Swagger and Foul Play, which will make sweeping a lot easier for Lucario.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>In the midst of a powerful sandstorm, Hippowdon is able to take on some of the strongest Pokemon in the metagame. With Rocky Helmet and reliable recovery, Hippowdon can wall threatening physical attackers such as Blaziken and Mega Kangaskhan. Between Rocky Helmet, sand damage, and even recoil for Pokemon such as Blaziken and Talonflame, physical attackers will be taking a good chunk of damage without Hippowdon even needing to attack. Hippowdon can even check special attackers as well if invested for it. The very prominent Aegislash easily falls to Hippowdon's high defenses and STAB Earthquake. Sand Stream is a fantastic ability which gets chip damage that can end up being crucial. It's also very useful for breaking Focus Sashes, making troublesome Focus Sash users such as Breloom easier to deal with. It can also work as a good way to remove other weather if need be. Hippowdon's access to Yawn is great thanks to the lack of Sleep Clause in Battle Spot; with Yawn's two turn mechanic, it forces a lot of switches. This works well in conjunction with Stealth Rock, punishing foes for attempting to avoid being put to sleep. However, Hippowdon suffers from a very low Speed tier and will almost always be moving last, and it heavily relies on support moves, making it an easy target for Taunt users such as Thundurus.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic can be useful for wearing down defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Cresselia. Leftovers is a good item choice on certain sets, providing nice passive recovery each turn. Ice Fang can be used to hit Salamence, Garchomp, and Landorus-T, which are all prevalent threats. Sets utilizing Stockpile and Toxic can work well against unprepared teams and are almost impossible to break when put in the right position.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Bulky Water-types in particular cause a lot of problems for Hippowdon. Most Water-types are special attackers, so they will be hitting Hippowdon for super effective damage on its weaker Special Defense, meaning that it cannot afford to stay in to use Yawn. It also fears being burned by Scald, as the residual damage significantly hinders Hippowdon's ability to stay in the match. Rotom-W, Suicune, and Slowbro are all common sights and nightmares for Hippowdon.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types can do heavy damage to Hippowdon and take very little damage from Earthquake, so it is not really worth staying in to Yawn against them. Breloom and Venusaur in particular are extremely threatening, as they can put Hippowdon to sleep before it can use Yawn.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Hippowdon's uninvested Special Defense is not amazing. Most powerful special attackers such as Greninja and Mega Charizard Y are capable of doing heavy damage to Hippowdon, and unless it can KO them with Earthquake or has already hit them with Yawn on the switch, it is often not worth staying in because they may be doing more damage than Hippowdon is able to recover.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon: Hippowdon excels only against very offensive Pokemon. Pokemon such as Cresselia and Porygon2 can be very troublesome for Hippowdon, as they can use Toxic on it, hit it with STAB special attacks, and recover off most damage it does. Putting them to sleep is useful, but foes such as Cresselia, which sometimes carries Rest anyway, might not even care.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Hippowdon's most important moves are stopped by Taunt. Taunt is not the most common of moves, but Taunt users such as Gyarados and Thundurus will shut down Hippowdon really well.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: Mega Sableye is a hard counter to Hippowdon, as Magic Bounce nullifies Yawn, Stealth Rock, and Whirlwind by bouncing them back. Mega Sableye can also burn Hippowdon, making Earthquake do pitiful damage. Hippowdon is total setup bait for Mega Sableye.</p>",

        "name": "Rocky Helmet Wall",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Slack Off is what makes Hippowdon great at what it does; Hippowdon can use Slack Off to keep itself as healthy as possible while being attacked. Thanks to sand and Rocky Helmet, the foe will still be taking a good amount of damage while Hippowdon recovers. Yawn and Stealth Rock go hand in hand; Yawn's two turn mechanic gives the foe a chance to switch out and avoid being put to sleep, and when Stealth Rock is up Hippowdon can safely continuously use Yawn, forcing the opponent to either let something sleep or take too much damage from Stealth Rock and sand. If you choose to run Stealth Rock on another Pokemon, Whirlwind can be used instead, as it really messes with the opponent's switches and racks up even more residual damage. It's also nice for phazing sweepers and Minimize users, as Whirlwind will always work even against foes with evasion boosts. Earthquake is Hippowdon's main form of offense, a strong STAB move coming off a respectable Attack for a defensive Pokemon. It hits many Pokemon Hippowdon would like to check super effectively, such as Blaziken, Mawile, and Aegislash. Rock Tomb is a good alternative to hit Talonflame and lower the foe's Speed, but it doesn't hit nearly as hard in most situations.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Defense and HP EVs are used because Hippowdon is meant to check the strongest of physical attackers. Rocky Helmet is the essential item that ensures Hippowdon can check Mega Kangaskhan, being able to do extra damage thanks to the latter's Parental Bond ability. Minimum Speed is desired to underspeed all Aegislash so Hippowdon can hit them with Earthquake in their frailer Blade forme. Additionally, it can be helpful against Trick Room teams, most notably underspeeding Brave Mega Mawile.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hippowdon can take hits from threatening attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Talonflame, and Blaziken, protecting teammates from being revenge killed by them. It can also serve nicely as a lead by immediately setting up Stealth Rock and spreading sleep with Yawn. Setting Stealth Rock up fast allows Focus Sashes to be broken early and provides some chip damage that could be very helpful to put a foe in KO range for your other Pokemon, but Hippowdon works just as well mid-game or whenever it is needed most. You should be cautious leading with Hippowdon, as you often won't want to lose it too quickly in the match. Slack Off should be used wisely and not neglected. Keeping Hippowdon healthy can be important; losing it too early could make you susceptible late-game to a foe that Hippowdon could have checked. The power of foes such as Kangaskhan, Blaziken, and Aegislash should not be underestimated, and Hippowdon still has to be careful not to fall early to them. Whenever you decide to set up Stealth Rock or use Yawn, make sure Hippowdon is healthy enough to do so. Try to keep sand up as long as you still need it, as the chip damage can be great and softens foes up for Hippowdon's teammates. You should keep in mind that continuously using Yawn is a viable option, as it prevents the opponent from bringing in a counter to Hippowdon without getting punished.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hippowdon fits very well on balance teams. Fast and frail sweepers such as Charizard, Mega Lucario, Greninja, and Blaziken appreciate Hippowdon's ability to deal with opposing Blaziken and Talonflame; with the priority and Speed Boost revenge killers out of the way, they can have an easier time cleaning up teams late-game. Although it does not have particularly good type synergy with Hippowdon, Excadrill becomes very threatening with Hippowdon's sand up thanks to Sand Rush. Especially after Hippowdon has helped weaken teams, Excadrill can have an easy time picking off the rest of a team with its boosted Speed and naturally high Attack. Once Hippowdon has weakened foes with its numerous ways of inflicting chip damage, they become closer to KO range for heavy hitters such as Aegislash and Mega Kangaskhan.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Slack Off allows Hippowdon to stay healthy; it can tank a hit, dish one out itself, and proceed to recover. Yawn spreads sleep around and forces switches thanks to its two turn mechanic, working well with Stealth Rock to create extra chip damage. Should you choose to use Stealth Rock on another Pokemon, Whirlwind is an option to mess with the opponent's switches and rack up even more damage from Stealth Rock. Earthquake is Hippowdon's strongest STAB move and is necessary to deal with Pokemon that Hippowdon threatens most. It can do a great amount of damage to Aegislash and Heatran, among others.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Defense investment is used to let Hippowdon take hits from powerful special attackers. It can survive strong hits and proceed to use Yawn on them. Minimum Speed is used to have the best matchup against Aegislash as possible. With Special Defense investment, Hippowdon becomes a fantastic counter to Aegislash; it is able to take any hit and knock Aegislash out in return, as it will always be attacking after Aegislash and hitting its frailer Blade forme. Rocky Helmet is the item of choice to get some chip damage, and it allows Hippowdon to scare physical attackers even without Defense investment. Sitrus Berry can be used for recovery on turns you use Yawn or Earthquake instead of Slack Off. Smooth Rock allows sand to be up longer and can be helpful for more turns of chip damage or to support other Pokemon on your team, such as Excadrill or Garchomp.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hippowdon can be an annoyance to special attackers and should be coming in and trying to put them to sleep or weakening them with Earthquake. This set lacks physical investment, so it should not be brought directly in on certain physical powerhouses such as Blaziken and Mega Kangaskhan, but it can still serve as a check to them with Rocky Helmet.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hippowdon fits well on balance teams. Pokemon that only need a bit of chip damage on certain foes to manage to KO them, such as Blaziken and Mega Lucario, appreciate Stealth Rock and Hippowdon's other forms of chip damage. Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Aegislash work well with Hippowdon as their partner. Mega Kangaskhan and Salamence appreciate the removal of Aegislash, as they can more freely use their STAB attacks. Talonflame also likes having Aegislash removed so that it doesn't need to play King's Shield mind games and can spam Brave Bird without it switching in. It also likes the residual damage that Hippowdon provides. Bulky Talonflame can be a good partner by spreading Will-O-Wisp, putting less pressure on Hippowdon's uninvested Defense. Excadrill becomes a threatening Pokemon capable of cleaning up teams with Hippowdon's sand up thanks to the speed boost from Sand Rush. Porygon2 can be used as an extra defensive Pokemon to work with Hippowdon; together, they can be hard to break without a dedicated wallbreaker.</p>"

  "Weavile": {
    "overview": "<p>Weavile often faces competition from the more popular Mamoswine as an Ice-type, lacking the flexibility and utility that Mamoswine provides. Weavile sets itself apart with a fantastic Dark / Ice typing backed up by one of the highest Speed stats in the game, making it a powerful lead and late-game cleaner capable of tackling some of the format's most popular threats. Access to great priority moves in Fake Out and Ice Shard allows it to effectively take down opposing leads and function as a reliable revenge killer that outpaces opposing priority users such as Thundurus due to its high base 125 Speed. A dangerous STAB combination and access to Knock Off and Icicle Crash also allow Weavile to clean up later in the game when its anti-lead capabilities are not necessary.</p> <p>However, Weavile is incredibly frail, so if it's not KOing the foe, it will almost surely be KOed in return. As a result, priority users that can shrug off a hit from Weavile such as Azumarill and Conkeldurr are very problematic. Weavile also suffers from a poor defensive typing with common weaknesses to Fire, Rock, and Fighting, so it has a difficult time finding opportunities to come in if it doesn't lead. Weavile also lacks access to many coverage moves beyond Low Kick and Poison Jab, so it finds itself struggling against anything that isn't weak to one of its moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Due to Pressure, Weavile can run a disruptive PP stalling set utilizing Substitute, Protect, and Spite with Leftovers to drain low-PP moves such as Close Combat and Fire Blast. This can be critical for giving a partner an easier setup opportunity on a foe that might otherwise threaten it, but the lack of offensive presence reduces its usefulness. Weavile can also opt to give up Fake Out to run Choice Band, but it sacrifices the ability to effectively deal with opposing leads. Counter can be used on a Focus Sash set to surprise Weavile's usual checks such as Blaziken and Talonflame, but fitting it onto a moveset is difficult without sacrificing an important STAB attack or coverage move. Swords Dance lets Weavile take on the role of a boosting sweeper thanks to its solid Speed tier, though its typing makes it difficult to find setup opportunities.</p> <p>Poison Jab lets Weavile deal with some of its usual counters such as Azumarill and Clefable, although it still struggles to break through Clefable without the Life Orb boost. Similarly, Aerial Ace lets it punish the Fighting-type switch-ins that aren't covered by Icicle Crash, particularly Blaziken and Heracross. Ice Punch is a more accurate alternative to Icicle Crash if you're worried about misses, although it's generally an inferior option due to its low Base Power. Unlike Icicle Crash, Ice Punch makes contact, so Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin become more problematic.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Klefki, Azumarill, and Mawile are among Weavile's strongest counters, as they resist both Ice and Dark while easily KOing it or forcing it out. Azumarill can also take advantage of the free switch for an opportunity to set up Belly Drum in front of it, while Mawile is immune to the occasional Poison Jab. Sylveon, Togekiss, and Gardevoir can also take a hit from Weavile and KO it in return, but none of them can afford to switch into Icicle Crash or Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Most Fighting-types can switch into Knock Off and KO Weavile back. Blaziken in particular resists both of Weavile's STAB types and can either set up with Swords Dance or KO it outright. Likewise, Mega Lopunny is the only other Fighting-type that can outspeed Weavile, although it must be careful of switching into Low Kick. Mega Heracross also isn't bothered much by Weavile's attacks beyond the odd Aerial Ace and immediately threatens to KO with Pin Missile or Close Combat. Breloom threatens Weavile with Mach Punch but needs to be wary because it loses if Weavile is running both Fake Out and Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Volcarona and both Mega Charizard formes give Weavile a difficult time and threaten to KO it with any Fire-type attack. Mega Charizard X in particular doesn't have to worry about anything aside from the occasional Icicle Crash and can proceed to set up or immediately KO Weavile.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers: Weavile's frailty makes it a prime target for priority moves. Talonflame, Scizor, Conkeldurr, and Lucario can all check Weavile with their respective priority moves without worrying about Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan: Mega Kangaskhan avoids being OHKOed by Weavile's Low Kick and can KO it with any STAB move, or it can use Power-Up Punch to get a quick boost. Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out also does a minimum of 50%, so it can pick off a weakened Weavile and avoid any damage. However, it must be mindful of Fake Out from Weavile itself and the occasional Stealth Rock, as the damage can put it in KO range for Low Kick.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: The best Weavile can do to Pokemon such as Suicune and Rotom-W is Knock Off, so both can safely burn it with Scald and Will-O-Wisp, respectively. Thanks to Thick Fat, Mega Venusaur also beats Weavile by stalling until Life Orb recoil KOes it. Similarly, Ferrothorn forces Weavile to take huge amounts of recoil damage and KOes with Gyro Ball, but it doesn't take Low Kick well.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: If Weavile doesn't have the Speed advantage, it often struggles to win due to its poor defenses. Mega Manectric in particular can Intimidate Weavile to take a hit better, after which it can outspeed it and OHKO with Flamethrower or Overheat. Choice Scarf users that don't mind Ice Shard are also reliable options to take out Weavile. Rotom-W and Excadrill don't mind Ice Shard and can easily KO Weavile with their respective STAB moves, although both hate switching in due to the risk of losing their Choice Scarf.</p>",

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out lets Weavile get relatively safe chip damage on the foe, breaking potential Focus Sash leads and possibly bringing the foe down to KO range for one of Weavile's other moves. Knock Off is Weavile's primary STAB move and is useful for taking down Gengar, Aegislash, and Cresselia or removing items from foes that might switch in as a result of the offensive pressure Weavile provides. Unless the opposing team has a Mega Evolution that doesn't mind Dark-type moves, Knock Off is generally a very safe move to use. Low Kick provides great coverage alongside Knock Off, threatening Rock-types such as Tyranitar as well as hitting Mega Kangaskhan and Mamoswine harder than Weavile's STAB moves. Low Kick can also KO Mega Kangaskhan variants that don't invest in bulk after a bit of prior damage, which Fake Out can provide. Ice Shard is commonly used in the final slot for beating boosted Mega Salamence, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Choice Scarf Garchomp, which all KO Weavile otherwise. Ice Shard is also necessary to beat lead Breloom before it can OHKO Weavile back with Mach Punch, and it's generally a great move for picking off a weakened foe without fear of being revenge killed.</p> <p>Alternatively, Icicle Crash is a more powerful Ice-type STAB move that can take on sturdier Pokemon that otherwise can take an Ice Shard and threaten to KO back, such as Zapdos and Hippowdon. It also gives Weavile a strong STAB attack that doesn't make contact or rely on the foe having an item. However, Fake Out can be dropped to run both Ice Shard and Icicle Crash at the cost of being unable to effectively threaten opposing leads.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread is designed to maximize Weavile's offensive potential. Maximum investment in Attack and Speed with a Jolly nature is needed to outpace base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Latios and Gengar. Life Orb is the preferred item because Weavile wants all the power it can get without having to compromise its important Speed tier, and it won't be able to take a hit if the foe survives anyway, so the recoil isn't a huge concern. Focus Sash is an alternative that can help Weavile reliably revenge kill at least one threat, although the loss in power is significant.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Weavile is best used as an anti-lead with Fake Out to pick off Focus Sash leads such as Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Breloom. However, be careful not to mindlessly click Fake Out if the foe might have Rocky Helmet, as that can result in Weavile taking more damage than Fake Out does to the foe. Dark / Ice coverage forces a lot of switches, so don't be afraid to click Knock Off or even switch out to take advantage of the offensive pressure that Weavile provides.</p> <p>If Weavile doesn't lead, it can still function as an effective late-game cleaner or revenge killer. However, while it is capable of cleaning weakened teams on its own, remember that Weavile is very frail and will struggle to break through bulkier Pokemon on its own. Unless you're sure it can sweep, don't rely on Weavile to be your sweeper. Weavile also depends greatly on type advantage to do its job effectively. If the opposing team isn't particularly weak to Weavile's STAB moves, Weavile should probably sit out for the battle.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Weavile greatly appreciates Stealth Rock support from Hippowdon or Garchomp to help it secure KOs on threats such as Mega Kangaskhan and Greninja. Weavile is also capable of KOing Talonflame with the combination of Fake Out and Ice Shard after Stealth Rock damage. Hippowdon and Garchomp also threaten Blaziken, which fears little from Weavile. Talonflame itself pairs well with Weavile, threatening the Fighting-types that give Weavile trouble. Fire-types that threaten Mawile and Skarmory also make for strong partners, while Weavile can take on Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp in return. In particular, Mega Charizard Y and Heatran also beat Aegislash reliably, which is important because Weavile can't OHKO Shield forme Aegislash with Knock Off and risks facing King's Shield or activating Weakness Policy. Grass-types such as Serperior help with Weavile's fear of Azumarill while also threatening the other bulky Water-types that Weavile struggles to break. In return, Weavile can deal with Mega Salamence and other Flying-types that keep Grass-types away. Weavile also appreciates support from slow U-turn and Volt Switch users to give it an easier time coming in if it doesn't lead. Rotom-W in particular deals with Talonflame, while Weavile threatens Grass-types that will want to switch into Rotom-W.</p>"

  "Rhyperior": {
    "overview": "<p>Rhyperior was made to be a tank. Its base 115 HP coupled with its Solid Rock ability, base 130 Defense, base 55 Special Defense, and access to Assault Vest makes it one of the bulkiest Pokemon in Battle Spot Singles. Its stellar base 140 Attack lets Rhyperior deal a lot of damage to Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Salamence, hitting them with one of its great coverage moves including STAB Earthquake, Rock Blast, and Stone Edge, as well as Superpower and Ice Punch. Rhyperior completely counters physical attacking Mega Salamence, as Rhyperior takes little damage from Double-Edge and Earthquake. Rhyperior's great offensive typing grants it a STAB EdgeQuake combo; however, it is a lackluster defensive typing, as it gives Rhyperior six weaknesses, including common types such as Fighting, Ground, and Water. Rhyperior has a 4x weakness to Water- and Grass-type attacks, and although this is reduced to 3x damage thanks to Solid Rock, Rhyperior will still be OHKOed or 2HKOed by most of them, making it very weak to Pokemon such as Azumarill, Rotom-W, Mega Venusaur, and Breloom. Rhyperior's base 40 Speed stat makes it very slow, so it won't be outspeeding much, either.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rhyperior can utilize its wide movepool and use attacks such as Megahorn, Hammer Arm, Superpower, Aqua Tail, or Thunder Punch. Rock Slide can be used over Rock Blast or Stone Edge, as it still retains many OHKOs or 2HKOs that the latter can achieve and has greater accuracy than both. A Choice Band or Life Orb can be used, but Rhyperior enjoys the extra Special Defense that Assault Vest provides. A Weakness Policy can be used to capitalize on Rhyperior's ability to take super effective attacks. A pure defensive set can be used, with an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with an Impish nature and the moves Stealth Rock, Roar, Earthquake, and Stone Edge, holding Leftovers or Rocky Helmet, with Leftovers increasing Rhyperior's longevity and Rocky Helmet crippling physical attackers. However, it is outclassed by other defensive Pokemon and Stealth Rock setters such as Mega Aggron and Garchomp; Mega Aggron has much greater Defense and Special Defense and has access to Thunder Wave, while Garchomp has much more Speed, Rough Skin, and the ability to use items such as Focus Sash or Rocky Helmet. Smack Down is an interesting option, letting Rhyperior knock down Pokemon such as Skarmory, 2HKOing it with Earthquake. Rock Polish can be utilized to boost Rhyperior's rather low Speed stat. Dragon Tail phazes common switch-ins such as Suicune, preventing a possible unfavorable matchup. Rhyperior's bulk lets it tank hits, so Metal Burst is an option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass- and Water-type Attacks: Rhyperior struggles against Water- and Grass-type moves due to its large weakness to them. Suicune, Rotom-W, Mega Venusaur, and Breloom are all examples of Pokemon that utilize them.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers: Though Rhyperior utilizes an Assault Vest, powerful special attackers still have to ability to OHKO or 2HKO it. Mega Charizard Y OHKOes Rhyperior with Solar Beam, and Pokemon such as Suicune, Rotom-W, and Mega Venusaur 2HKO Rhyperior.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls: Rhyperior has a hard time against physically defensive Pokemon, as they can tank any one of Rhyperior's attacks. However, they have to be aware of Horn Drill if they cannot do much to Rhyperior. Pokemon such as Suicune and Cresselia can easily tank Rhyperior's attacks, but they have to watch out for Horn Drill.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Assault Vest",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is a reliable STAB attack that does tons of damage coming off of Rhyperior's amazing base 140 Attack. Rock Blast is a secondary STAB attack that has the ability to break Focus Sashes and Substitutes and hit through Sturdy; however, it is fairly weak if it doesn't get at least three hits. This lets Rhyperior beat low-health Substitute Pokemon such as Volcarona or the rare Substitute Talonflame. Stone Edge, on the other hand, is more reliable in terms of power; it has a consistent 100 Base Power, but it is only 80% accurate. Ice Punch hits Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus-T, all of which take little damage from Rhyperior's STAB attacks. Ice Punch does enough damage to Gliscor that it won't have enough HP left to create a Substitute afterwards. Horn Drill OHKOes bulky Pokemon that Rhyperior has trouble with, such as Cresselia, at the cost of only being 30% accurate. Megahorn does a good chunk of damage to Cresselia without having to resort to Horn Drill; however, Rhyperior only has a 21.9% chance of 2HKOing her, and, in the process, has to take damage from Rocky Helmet. Fire Punch is an option to be considered, as it 2HKOes Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. However, using it means Rhyperior has to give up either Ice Punch or Horn Drill, whose targets are Landorus-T and Cresselia, respectively, which are greater threats in Battle Spot Singles.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Using an Assault Vest boosts Rhyperior's rather low Special Defense stat by 50%, giving it the ability to take special attacks, as Rhyperior can already take many physical attacks thanks to its monstrous base 130 Defense. In combination with Solid Rock, Rhyperior can survive a plethora of threatening attacks. Maximum Attack investment coupled with an Adamant nature enables Rhyperior hit as hard as possible. A Brave nature can be used instead of an Adamant nature, as it lets Rhyperior underspeed minimum Speed Aegislash, avoid giving Aegislash a Weakness Policy boost, and OHKO it with Earthquake. It also lets Rhyperior outspeed Trick Room-based Mega Mawile under Trick Room, OHKOing with Earthquake. Maximum Special Defense investment is used instead of maximum HP investment because Rhyperior can then survive threatening attacks such as +1 4 SpA Suicune's Scald, 252 SpA Modest Mega Salamence's Hydro Pump, 4 SpA Rotom-W's Hydro Pump, 252 SpA Modest Rotom-W's Hydro Pump in the sun, and 252 SpA Modest Mega Venusaur's Giga Drain. An alternate EV spread with maximum HP lets Rhyperior better handle physical attacks from the likes of Blaziken, Mega Salamence, etc.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Rhyperior's fantastic mixed bulk to take hits from Pokemon such as Mega Salamence and Cresselia, and use its even better Attack stat to retaliate with strong super effective attacks. When in doubt, against bulky Pokemon that Rhyperior can take hits from but not hit hard back, use Horn Drill to have a chance to OHKO them on the spot. Rhyperior should be used to force out physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Salamence, and Talonflame, threatening them with the appropriate coverage move. If Rhyperior is against Pokemon such as Suicune, Rotom-W, Mega Venusaur, and Breloom, switch out, as they threaten Rhyperior with powerful Water- or Grass-type attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Talonflame can switch into Grass-type attacks aimed at Rhyperior. Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss can also switch into Water-type attacks, while Talonflame can threaten opposing Grass-types with its STAB Brave Bird and can freely switch into Ground-type attacks. Zapdos provides excellent defensive synergy with Rhyperior, taking the Ground-, Steel-, and Grass-type moves aimed at Rhyperior, with Rhyperior taking the Rock-type moves aimed at Zapdos. Mega Charizard Y can beat the Steel-, Grass-, and Ice-type Pokemon that threaten Rhyperior. Its ability, Drought, sets up sun, which weakens Water-type attacks aimed at Rhyperior. Rhyperior can switch into Pokemon that threaten teammates such as Mega Charizard Y, Gyarados, Mega Salamence, Hydreigon, and Aegislash.</p>"

Its Guillotine is pretty spammable once everything immune to it is gone, as Gliscor's good defensive typing, its good bulk, and the constant recovery from Poison Heal give it many opportunities to use it. Gliscor can also be a great status absorber due to Poison Heal, which, in tandem with a Toxic Orb, renders it effectively immune to other status effects. However, Gliscor has a 4x weakness to Ice-type attacks, which gives it trouble in the face of attacks such as Glalie's Frost Breath, Thundurus's Hidden Power Ice, and Mamoswine's Icicle Spear and Ice Shard, and it is easily overwhelmed by special attackers such as Gengar, Rotom-W, and Aegislash because of its subpar Special Defense.</p>",

Ice Fang hits Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Garchomp, Dragonite, and Landorus-T for decent damage, but it is significantly weaker than Earthquake and provides redundant coverage otherwise. Roost can be used as a reliable form of recovery. Gliscor has a very big movepool, so it can utilize moves such as Swords Dance, Acrobatics, Aerial Ace, Fling, Stone Edge, Knock Off, Baton Pass, and even Torment. Fling with Acrobatics deserves a special mention, as Gliscor can Fling a Toxic Orb onto the foe, badly poisoning it and doubling Acrobatics's power in the process.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Earthquake and Guillotine: Gengar's and Skarmory's typings and abilities make them immune to Toxic, Earthquake, and Guillotine. Air Balloon-wielding Ghost-types such as Aegislash are immune to Gliscor's Earthquake and Guillotine. Aegislash is also immune to Toxic, which only leaves Gliscor to set up Substitute and Protect. Aegislash can take advantage of that and use it as setup fodder. Chandelure, despite not having an immunity to Toxic, has Infiltrator, allowing it to bypass Gliscor's Substitute and deal damage to it. Mega Sableye is immune to Guillotine and takes little damage from Earthquake, which it can then heal off with Recover.</p> <p><strong>Perish Song Mega Gengar: Mega Gengar outspeeds Gliscor and can keep it from switching out with Shadow Tag. After using Perish Song, Gengar can stall out Gliscor with Protect and Substitute and switch out. Mega Gengar is also immune to Guillotine.</p> <p><strong>Hyper Voice</strong>: Hyper Voice is dangerous to Gliscor, as it takes advantage of its lower Special Defense and bypasses its Substitute. Common users include Sylveon, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Altaria, and Mega Salamence. Sylveon is particularly threatening, as it can OHKO Gliscor if it is equipped with a Choice Specs. These all, however, need to watch out for Guillotine.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon With Strong Water- and Ice-type Attacks: Pokemon such as Suicune and Thundurus have enough power to OHKO Gliscor with super effective Scald and Hidden Power Ice, respectively. Both can switch into Earthquake with ease but must be wary of Guillotine. Albeit uncommon, Mega Kangaskhan can use Ice Punch, which OHKOes Gliscor if it's not behind a Substitute and 2HKOes Gliscor if it is behind one. Cloyster and Mamoswine have access to Icicle Spear, which is able to break Gliscor's Substitutes and hit it for super effective damage after doing so. Cloyster easily OHKOes Gliscor no matter the circumstance because of Skill Link, but Mamoswine needs at least three hits in order to at least have a chance to OHKO. Cresselia and Porygon2 can set up Trick Room while Gliscor uses Protect and can OHKO it with Ice Beam. Porygon2 also has Trace, which can copy Poison Heal, making Toxic from Gliscor useless.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore Users: Taunt users such as Gyarados, Talonflame, Gengar, and Thundurus can all keep Gliscor from stalling them out. Talonflame and Gengar have no trouble outspeeding Gliscor, and Gyarados is able to beat Gliscor with its STAB moves. Thundurus deserves a special mention because its Prankster Taunt shuts down most of Gliscor's moves, forcing it to use Guillotine. All of the threats mentioned above are immune to Earthquake as well. Mega Alakazam, Whimsicott, and Liepard can use Encore to lock Gliscor into one of its status moves. Mega Alakazam has Trace, which can copy Gliscor's Poison Heal, making it effectively immune to Toxic. Whimsicott has Prankster and can set up Substitute while Gliscor is locked into a move. It can spam Moonblast and use Leech Seed, depleting Gliscor of its HP. Liepard also has Prankster and can damage Gliscor as well, forcing it to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Phazers: Skarmory and Suicune can both disrupt Gliscor's stalling capabilities with Whirlwind and Roar, respectively, as both attacks can go through Gliscor's Substitute. Skarmory is unaffected by any of Gliscor's moves, and Suicune can cure itself of poison with Rest, but it must be wary of Guillotine.</p>",

        "name": "Poison Healer",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>In combination with Toxic Orb and Poison Heal, Gliscor can effectively stall out the foe. Protect allows Gliscor to scout the foe and activate Toxic Orb after a turn passes. Substitute enables Gliscor to protect itself from status and from any physical attackers that can't break its Substitute. Poison Heal offsets the health loss of Substitute after two turns, meaning Gliscor hasn't lost any health after using the combination of the two. Albeit uninvested, Earthquake hits common Pokemon that are weak to it, such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Gengar, Mega Blaziken, Heatran, and Aegislash, for decent damage. Guillotine, despite being highly inaccurate, hits what Earthquake cannot. Its main use is to OHKO non-Sturdy users, non-Ghost-type Levitate users, and Flying-type Pokemon, as well as bulkier Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Chansey, Blissey, and Suicune. Toxic can be used over Guillotine, as it is more reliable for beating defensive Pokemon, but Guillotine's ability to OHKO foes on the spot is highly preferred.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>212 EVs are invested into Speed to allow Gliscor to outspeed maximum Speed Heatran. 228 HP EVs with an Impish nature increase Gliscor's physical bulk, allowing it to take many hits from other physical attackers and assist with Poison Heal recovery and Substitute usage. The remaining 68 EVs are invested into Defense to increase Gliscor's physical walling capabilities as much as possible. Toxic Orb activates Poison Heal, which helps replenish Gliscor's health every turn and further aids Gliscor's stalling capabilities. Gliscor can also activate Toxic Orb by switching into other attackers to tank their hits.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Gliscor's most common role is stalling. It has many positive matchups against faster physical attackers, allowing Gliscor to easily set up a Substitute and putting it in a great position to use Guillotine. However, when looking at Team Preview, be very careful when you see Mega Kangaskhan, Pokemon that can carry Hyper Voice such as Sylveon, Chandelure with Infiltrator, and any Pokemon that has a chance of carrying an Ice-type attack. Gliscor should always use Protect as its first move in order to scout the foe's move and have Toxic Orb activate. If using Toxic instead of Guillotine, Gliscor can inflict Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Talonflame with poison and stall them out by alternating between Protect and Substitute.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Chansey and Blissey have great Special Defense to help back up Gliscor's weaker Special Defense stat, forming an excellent defensive core. Additionally, because most Water- and Ice-type attacks are special moves, they have an easy time switching into threats that Gliscor can't handle. Water-type Pokemon such as Slowbro, Mega Slowbro, Suicune, and Rotom-W can also switch into the Water- and Ice-type attacks that threaten Gliscor. Mega Venusaur can switch into Water-type attacks that threaten Gliscor and provides Leech Seed support, letting Gliscor continuously wear down the foe and stall it without having to resort to Guillotine. Klefki has good defensive synergy with Gliscor, being able to switch into the Ice-type attacks aimed at Gliscor while Gliscor can freely switch into Ground-type attacks aimed at Klefki. Klefki either can utilize the combination of Swagger and Thunder Wave so that Gliscor has a safer time spamming Guillotine or can set up dual screens so that the opponent's Pokemon have a harder time breaking past Gliscor. Gliscor has good defensive synergy with Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Ferrothorn, making them good teammates. Pokemon with Toxic support let Gliscor stall out Pokemon that would otherwise be a threat to it. Pokemon such as Zapdos and Suicune can normally waste Guillotine's PP faster due to Pressure, and having them poisoned reflects the pressure back to the opponent.</p>"

  "Mamoswine": {
    "overview": "<p>Mamoswine is a great check to many common Pokemon, including Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Mega Salamence, both of which are 4x weak to Ice; Steel-types such as Heatran; and Electric-types such as Thundurus and Zapdos. Its Ground / Ice STAB combination in is very hard to switch into in general because it hits many Pokemon at least neutrally. Most Ice-types are severely hindered by their typing, but Mamoswine can make good use of its Ground / Ice typing along with Thick Fat, offsetting its Fire weakness and Ice neutrality and giving it an immunity and resistance to the famous BoltBeam combination that many Electric-types carry. Mamoswine also has other useful moves, such as the always-handy Stealth Rock as well as Fissure to deal with defensive Pokemon it can't break through otherwise. Mamoswine is also very versatile. If your opponent predicts the wrong set, it can potentially cost them the game. One of Mamoswine's biggest downsides is its mediocre Speed, leaving it outsped by Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Y, Mega Kangaskhan, and Gengar. Mamoswine also has very common hard counters such as Cresselia, Rotom-W, and Suicune. These Pokemon can freely switch into Mamoswine, and there's not much it can do to punish them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Life Orb makes Mamoswine much stronger and helps it pick up more KOs, most notably on Aegislash. Choice Band can make Mamoswine a lot stronger, but one of Mamoswine's best features is its STAB combination that covers a lot of the metagame, so being locked into one attack often is not preferred. Lum Berry can help Mamoswine deal with burns, and this is especially useful against Mega Gengar. Freeze-Dry can be used to hit some Water-types, most notably Gyarados, Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Swampert. However, in order to deal a respectable amount of damage, you must run Life Orb with 36 Special Attack EVs to allow Mamoswine to 2HKO Rotom-W and Slowbro. Freeze-Dry hits Swampert for 4x super effective damage and prevents it from setting Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Cresselia: Cresselia is immune to Earthquake and bulky enough to take on Mamoswine's other attacks. It can easily wear Mamoswine down and use Moonlight to restore off any damage taken. Toxic is the only way Mamoswine has a chance to beat Cresselia.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Suicune, Mega Slowbro, Gyarados, and Azumarill are all bulky enough to take on Mamoswine's attacks and fire back with their super effective STAB moves. Scald is especially threatening because of its chance to burn.</p> <p><strong>Mega Heracross: Mega Heracross is bulky enough to take on Mamoswine and can OHKO back with Bullet Seed, even through Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Rotom Formes</strong>: Rotom-W and Rotom-H are both immune to Ground and resist Ice, making them great counters to Mamoswine. They can threaten with super effective attacks or Will-O-Wisp to lower Mamoswine's Attack.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame: Talonflame can outspeed and burn Mamoswine, leaving it near useless. It can use Roost to recover off any damage Mamoswine might have done. Without a Rock-type move, it's very difficult for Mamoswine to beat it, as Mamoswine needs to correctly predict Roost with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn only fears the rare Superpower from Mamoswine, and it can easily take any other attack and OHKO back with Gyro Ball.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory walls Mamoswine very well and can freely start setting up entry hazards against it or take it out with Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Mega Scizor</strong>: Mega Scizor takes little from Mamoswine's attacks, can use Mamoswine as setup fodder, and threatens it with Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan</strong>: Mega Kangaskhan outspeeds non-Choice Scarf variants and can OHKO most Mamoswine even through Focus Sash. However, Kangaskhan has to watch out for Rocky Helmet sets.</p> <p><strong>Gengar: Gengar can burn Mamoswine with Will-O-Wisp, heavily crippling it. Gengar can also wait before Mega Evolving against Mamoswine in order to avoid super effective damage from Earthquake.</p>",

        "name": "Focus Sash",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Mamoswine's strongest STAB move and hits many common Pokemon super effectively, such as Aegislash and Mega Gengar. Ice Shard is a fantastic move for picking off weakened foes that would outspeed Mamoswine otherwise. Icicle Spear is very useful for breaking through Substitute and Focus Sash, giving Mamoswine an edge over other Focus Sash leads such as Breloom and Garchomp. Stealth Rock is useful for getting some chip damage on Pokemon, and with Focus Sash, Mamoswine can reliably set it if you need it to. Endeavor is a nice option to heavily cripple something after Mamoswine has been brought down to its Focus Sash. Fissure can be used to deal with some defensive Pokemon that are tough for Mamoswine to break through, and although the low accuracy might seem like a big risk, Focus Sash guarantees it'll have at least two attempts to hit, which is about a 50% chance.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment is preferred, as with Focus Sash investing in bulk isn't necessary. Maximum Speed is important to ensure Mamoswine outspeeds Breloom and takes it out with Icicle Spear. Focus Sash makes Mamoswine a great lead and revenge killer, able to take big hits and retaliate with its own. Thick Fat increases Mamoswine's defensive capabilities, helping it take the popular BoltBeam combination often used on Pokemon such as Thundurus and Zapdos.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mamoswine is a very nice lead thanks to Focus Sash and can reliably set up Stealth Rock if necessary. With Focus Sash, dealing with Mamoswine is rather troublesome, as it can survive most hits and attack back with its strong STAB and priority moves. Common leads for Mamoswine to take on include Garchomp and Breloom, though Icicle Spear won't be able to KO Breloom with only two hits. However, since Mamoswine is such a common lead, leading with something to beat Mamoswine checks can be an effective way to punish your opponent. It also works as a good revenge killer, and it does especially well against common sweepers such as Mega Salamence, Garchomp, and Blaziken. It can survive strong attacks and attempt to OHKO back or 2HKO with help from Ice Shard. Mamoswine also works great as a Thundurus check, as it is able to switch into Thunder Wave and other common attacks from Thundurus. Pokemon that are terrified of Talonflame appreciate having the Stealth Rock that Mamoswine can provide. Serperior, for example, has an easy time with Talonflame weakened or taken out and can deal with Rotom-W for Mamoswine.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mamoswine's reliability as a Stealth Rock setter and Thundurus check makes it a beneficial teammate for setup sweepers. Most setup sweepers really appreciate the chip damage from Stealth Rock and Mamoswine's ability to switch into Thunder Wave fairly easily. Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Mega Charizard X, and Blaziken all appreciate having Mamoswine on their team. Thundurus can deal with bulky Water-types that Mamoswine often struggles with and can also provide Thunder Wave support to make up for Mamoswine's below-average Speed tier. Talonflame appreciates Mamoswine as a teammate because it can deal with Pokemon that often give Talonflame trouble, such as Thundurus, Garchomp, and Landorus-T.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is a strong and consistent STAB move. Ice Shard offers priority, which makes up for this set's minimal Speed investment and is very useful for picking off faster, weakened foes. Icicle Spear is useful for breaking through Substitute and Focus Sash and hits many common Pokemon super effectively, such as Garchomp, Thundurus, and Mega Salamence. Fissure helps Mamoswine break through defensive Pokemon such as Suicune and Porygon2. With Assault Vest Mamoswine can withstand a lot of attacks, providing a lot of turns to attempt to hit Fissure. Knock Off is a nice option for removing items such as Sitrus Berry to prevent recovery and crippling Pokemon relying on items such as Eviolite and Choice Scarf. Rock Tomb can be useful for hitting Talonflame, which can wall Mamoswine quite well otherwise. It also lowers Speed, which can be especially nice when you predict something faster to switch in.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An Adamant nature is used so that Mamoswine still has a good offensive presence. The HP EVs minimize residual damage. Maximum Special Defense investment is used to increase the utility of Assault Vest as much as possible. The Speed investment is enough for Mamoswine to outspeed most Suicune variants. The remaining EVs are all put into Attack to increase Mamoswine's damage output. Assault Vest, most importantly, helps Mamoswine take on Electric-types such as Thundurus very well. It's also very nice against other special attackers such as Porygon2, Aegislash, and Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mamoswine works as a great answer to Thundurus, as it is immune to Thunderbolt and resists Hidden Power Ice, Thundurus's most common moves. The only moves it has to watch out for are Focus Blast and Grass Knot, but thanks to Assault Vest, it can survive both. Mamoswine can take on a lot of defensive Pokemon very well with Fissure. Assault Vest allows Mamoswine to take a lot of attacks from Pokemon such as Porygon2 and even defensive Suicune, granting it more turns to attempt to hit Fissure. It can revenge kill a good number of Pokemon in the metagame thanks to its nice STAB coverage, such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, Raikou, and weakened Aegislash. Mamoswine can switch in against most special attackers, but its physical bulk isn't very impressive and thus it shouldn't switch directly in to most physical attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mamoswine is a nice partner for Mega Salamence, as it can consistently switch into Thundurus thanks to the Special Defense boost from Assault Vest. With Assault Vest, Mamoswine can often deal with Pokemon that would normally take it on easily, such as Suicune and Porygon2, and removing them via Fissure at them is very beneficial to offensive Pokemon such as Blaziken, Mega Kangaskhan and Talonflame. Suicune appreciates Mamoswine's ability to consistently switch into Electric-types, and if holding a Rocky Helmet, Suicune can handle Mega Kangaskhan, which Mamoswine normally struggles against. Serperior can deal with Water-types such as Rotom-W that Mamoswine struggles with and can paralyze fast threats so Mamoswine can outspeed them. Mamoswine also handles Thundurus well, making things much easier for Serperior. Mega Gengar can trap and beat some Pokemon that threaten Mamoswine such as Mega Kangaskhan and Cresselia.</p>"

Stealth Rock helps get chip damage and breaks Focus Sash. With the bulk on this set, Mamoswine can often set Stealth Rock reliably. Toxic helps wear down many of Mamoswine's common switch-ins such as Cresselia and Rotom-W. Icicle Spear is a nice option if you want a stronger Ice STAB move. Knock Off offers nice utility in taking out the foe's item which will often be crucial to their game plan. Rock Tomb allows Mamoswine to hit Talonflame, and the Speed drops might be useful. Fissure helps Mamoswine take out some defensive Pokemon that aren't bothered as much by Toxic, such as Rest Suicune and Chansey with Natural Cure.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An Impish nature with maximum investment in HP and Defense is used to take on strong attackers like Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Salamence. Maximum investment is needed to ensure the best chance of surviving a Double-Edge from +1 Mega Salamence. Rocky Helmet allows Mamoswine get a lot of damage on Mega Kangaskhan because of Parental Bond and other Pokemon with recoil moves such as Blaziken, Mega Salamence, and Talonflame. Thick Fat helps Mamoswine easily take Ice-type attacks, making it a very consistent switch-in to Electric-types such as Thundurus.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If you need a Pokemon that can deal with physical attackers like Mega Salamence and Kangaskhan but also need a Thundurus check, Rocky Helmet Mamoswine is a good option. Mamoswine can withstand Fake Out and Double Edge from Mega Kangaskhan and take it out with Earthquake after Rocky Helmet damage. However, Mamoswine often should not be switched directly into Kangaskhan because it can be 2HKOed. Mamoswine should come into Kangaskhan on a free switch if possible. It can be used to switch into Thundurus, so that teammates such as Mega Salamence and Blaziken aren't crippled by Thunder Wave. Mamoswine can also be used as a dedicated counter to Garchomp and Landorus-T, being able to take their hits and dish out 4x super effective damage back.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Blaziken especially appreciates bulky Mamoswine as a partner. With the defensive investment, Mamoswine can take on some big checks to Blaziken such as Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, and Thundurus. Mamoswine also lures in Cresselia and can wear it down with Toxic, making it easier for Blaziken to deal with. Stealth Rock support is also very beneficial for getting chip damage and breaking Focus Sash to up a successful sweep for Blaziken. Mega Salamence appreciates Mamoswine's ability to take on Thundurus and wear down Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Cresselia with Toxic. Thundurus is a nice teammate to deal with bulky Water-types such as Suicune that Mamoswine has trouble dealing with. Mamoswine can also deal with Choice Scarf Ground-types such as Garchomp and Landorus-T, both of which can can threaten Thundurus with Stone Edge.</p>"

It also hits other common Pokemon such as Aegislash and Heatran super effectively. Icicle Spear is useful for breaking Focus Sash and Substitutes. Icicle Crash can be used instead if you want a more consistent damage output; it also has a nice flinch chance, which is especially useful with Choice Scarf boosting Mamoswine's Speed. Superpower offers nice coverage on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Mega Kangaskhan, and other Mamoswine. Alternatively, Rock Slide OHKOes Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, which are hard for Mamoswine to take on otherwise. Fissure can be used when you predict defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Suicune to switch in. It can also be used as a last-resort attack in a pinch. Knock Off can be used as it offers nice utility, removing your foe's item.

It is a great answer to Thundurus and can outspeed variants carrying Focus Blast that might expect to outspeed and KO it. This set is less bulky than other variants and doesn't have Focus Sash to make up for that, so it should be very wary when switching into most Pokemon. Hiding the fact that Mamoswine is carrying Choice Scarf can help gain an advantage, as can bringing in Mamoswine against naturally slower Pokemon such as Breloom and then surprising your opponent by outspeeding a faster Pokemon later in the game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mamoswine works well on teams that are quite slow and need something fast to outspeed most of the metagame, and it's an especially good choice if you need something to deal with Pokemon such as Thundurus, Garchomp, and Mega Salamence.

  "Rotom-Heat": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-H might not seem as gourmet as Rotom-W, but thanks to its unique typing, Rotom-H brings something unique to the table! Rotom-H's resistances to Grass, Electric, and Fire and access to a STAB Overheat mean it is able to beat threats that Rotom-W couldn't even dream of handling, such as Ferrothorn, Breloom, Serperior, Aegislash, and Mega Charizard Y. Rotom-H's Fairy-type resistance also lets it handle Mega Mawile more reliably than Rotom-W. Rotom-H can even use its typing to pivot in and out of Thundurus. Much like Rotom-W, Rotom-H also has access to a delicious but concise movepool, with access to the all-important Volt Switch that allows it to become an effective scout and scrumptious support moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Trick.</p> <p>However, as great as Overheat is for dealing with a large number of threats, the Special Attack drop leaves Rotom-H vulnerable to being set up on. Along with Volt Switch, this also means that Rotom-H is forced to switch out more often than Rotom-W, which is a problem when combined with its Stealth Rock weakness. Weaknesses to Rock- and Water-type moves in general also mean that there are some prominent threats that Rotom-H has more problems against than Rotom-W, such Garchomp and Azumarill. In general, make sure you are using Rotom-H for the unique threats it checks, rather than as an off-brand Rotom-W.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rotom-H doesn't have many viable options that haven't been covered already. Reflect and Light Screen can be used with Light Clay to help setup sweepers, but giving up two moveslots is often too much for Rotom-H. Hex can be paired with Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp to smash Mega Gengar without Overheat, but it is otherwise weaker than Rotom-H's Electric STAB move. If you really dislike Swampert and Rhyperior, you can run Hidden Power Grass, but otherwise it's a wasted moveslot compared to Hidden Power Ice. Confuse Ray has synergy with Substitute, but it is much more luck based than Will-O-Wisp or Toxic.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Hydreigon, Latios, Mega Latias, and Mega Altaria only really fear Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power Ice and can otherwise use Rotom-H as setup bait or slam it with their STAB moves. Facade Mega Salamence sets up without fear of Will-O-Wisp, while Dragonite sets up especially easily if it has Lum Berry. Mega Charizard X is immune to Will-O-Wisp, so it will set up on Rotom-H unless Rotom-H has Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar and Rhyperior: Tyranitar's Rock typing and Sand Stream make it a real nightmare for Rotom-H, only fearing Will-O-Wisp. Even then, Rotom-H gets smashed by Rock Slide and Stone Edge. Assault Vest Rhyperior also avoids a 2HKO from Rotom-H and can even use Rock Blast to muscle past its Substitutes.</p> <p><strong>Facade Mega Kangaskhan</strong>: Mega Kangaskhan already usually OHKOes Rotom-H, but Facade means Mega Kangaskhan doesn't even fear Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fire-types</strong>: Calm Heatran avoids a 2HKO from even Choice Specs Rotom-H and can cripple Rotom-H with Toxic as long as it avoids Trick. Assault Vest Entei is extremely bulky and hits Rotom-H hard with Stone Edge. While Volcarona is OHKOed by Choice Specs-boosted Overheat, it can otherwise use Rotom-H to set up Quiver Dance.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Stealth Rock strips away 25% of Rotom-H's HP, which is especially punishing because Rotom-H often switches out due to Volt Switch and Overheat. Common users of Stealth Rock include Garchomp, Hippowdon, Tyranitar, Landorus-T, and Swampert.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Ground-types: Garchomp in particular easily takes Overheat and Electric moves and slams Rotom-H with Rock-type attacks, though it can't take Hidden Power Ice well. Landorus-T takes heavy damage from Overheat and Hidden Power Ice but can otherwise hit Rotom-H even harder with Rock-type attacks. Excadrill gets OHKOed by Overheat, but its Mold Breaker ability allows it to OHKO Rotom-H with Earthquake. All of these Pokemon also heavily punish constant uses of Volt Switch, especially if Rotom-H is Choice-locked.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur: Thick Fat allows specially defensive Mega Venusaur to wall Rotom-H. Offensive and physically defensive Mega Venusaur also do well against Rotom-H, but they are 2HKOed by Choice Specs-boosted Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Water-types</strong>: Azumarill, Rotom-W, Greninja, and Gyarados all hit Rotom-H hard, but all of them hate Electric-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Swampert: Swampert only fears Will-O-Wisp if it's physically based, as it otherwise slams Rotom-H with its Water-type attacks, and can set up Stealth Rock or use Yawn fairly easily.</p> <p><strong>Raikou</strong>: Raikou gets beaten down hard by Choice Specs-boosted Overheat, but it can otherwise use Rotom-H as setup bait with Calm Mind and can use Substitute to soak up the first Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey</strong>: As long as they avoid Trick, Chansey and Blissey totally wall Rotom-H with their massive Special Defense.</p> <p><strong>Conkeldurr</strong>: Assault Vest Conkeldurr uses Guts to absorb Will-O-Wisp and smack Rotom-H hard with a boosted Drain Punch.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch is an excellent scouting move on Rotom-H, allowing you to peer into what Pokemon your opponent has chosen and gain an edge with a better matchup. Overheat is Rotom-H's strongest STAB move, letting Rotom-H roast Ferrothorn and Mega Mawile. It even OHKOes Aegislash if Rotom-H is carrying an Expert Belt and is using a Modest nature. Will-O-Wisp is great for crippling Tyranitar, Azumarill, and Garchomp switch-ins and helps against Mega Mawile that might attempt to Sucker Punch Rotom-H. Thunder Wave is a reasonable alternative, punishing Mega Charizard X, Volcarona, and Blaziken for attempting to use Rotom-H as setup bait and dealing with Hydreigon switch-ins as well. In general, Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave allow Rotom-H to punish Pokemon that attempt to set up on it after Overheat.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is a good, reliable STAB attack to consider, 2HKOing Mega Charizard Y and Azumarill without forcing Rotom-H to switch out. If you prefer a higher paralysis chance, Discharge is also a reasonable option. Finally, Hidden Power Ice 2HKOes Garchomp and Mega Salamence, which is especially important if Rotom-H lacks Will-O-Wisp. If Rotom-H is carrying an Expert Belt and a Modest nature, it can actually OHKO these two, as well as 2HKO Hydreigon switch-ins.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The most difficult choice for Rotom-H is which build to use. With a Calm nature and maximum HP and Special Defense investment, Rotom-H becomes a good Mega Charizard Y check and is able to take on Thundurus more reliably; it also allows Rotom-H to defeat Focus Sash Serperior when at full health and tank Sylveon's Hyper Voice. This also pairs nicely with Rotom-H's ability to burn physical attackers. However, if you'd prefer to take on Mega Mawile more reliably, a Bold nature with maximum HP and Defense investment is still a reasonable option. While Rotom-H won't check Mega Charizard Y as reliably, it will now take on Mega Salamence's Double-Edge better and take less damage from Pokemon with Rock-type attacks such as Garchomp and Landorus-T. When you're using a defensive nature, Sitrus Berry makes the most sense, since it can turn 2HKOs into 3HKOs, but Leftovers is a fine option if Sitrus Berry is already held by another teammate.</p> <p>If you prefer to focus more on offense, consider running a Modest nature with Expert Belt. While Rotom-H isn't able to check Pokemon as reliably, this does allow it to OHKO Aegislash with Overheat. This also means that certain Rotom-H switch-ins are far less safe than usual. For example, Garchomp and Mega Salamence are now usually OHKOed by Hidden Power Ice, and Hydreigon is 2HKOed. Meanwhile, Thunderbolt now 2HKOes Assault Vest Azumarill. With a Modest nature, it's best to put the remaining 4 EVs in Special Defense to prevent Porygon2 from getting a Special Attack boost from Download.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Usually, its best to switch Rotom-H into Pokemon it checks, such as Talonflame, Ferrothorn, Serperior (when using a Calm nature), and Thundurus. While Overheat fries Mega Mawile, note that Mega Mawile's Knock Off deals a huge amount of damage to Rotom-H that are Calm or Modest, so be careful about making Rotom-H your primary check to that Pokemon. Additionally, while Rotom-H checks Mega Charizard Y well, Mega Charizard X can set up on it, so switching into Charizard before it has Mega Evolved is extremely risky. While Rotom-H's Will-O-Wisp cripples Mega Kangaskhan, you should only force Rotom-H to handle that in emergencies, as Mega Kangaskhan is so strong that it'll 2HKO Rotom-H regardless of whether Will-O-Wisp connects or not. Finally, Modest Rotom-H is best sent in after a KO, as it is a bit frail compared to the defensive ones.</p> <p>Using Volt Switch as much as possible is great for scouting your opponent's Pokemon choices, especially if Stealth Rock hasn't been set up on your side of the field. It's usually a good idea to use Volt Switch on non-threatening Pokemon that rarely stay in on Rotom-H, such as Talonflame, Ferrothorn, and Scizor. If you see physical Pokemon that use Rock-type moves such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Tyranitar in Team Preview, using Will-O-Wisp on Pokemon Rotom-H often forces out isn't a bad idea to nail these Pokemon on the switch. Note that while Overheat is Rotom-H's most powerful attack, it also makes Rotom-H very easy to set up on, so make sure that any setup sweeper that can take advantage of Overheat's Special Attack drop is manageable with the Pokemon you have chosen before using it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon with a Rock-type resistance are fairly important for Rotom-H, as such moves are a common way for physical attackers such as Tyranitar, Garchomp, and Landorus-T to hit Rotom-H hard. Water-type switch-ins are also important, because while Rotom-H hits most of them hard with Thunderbolt, special attacking Swampert, faster Water-types such as Greninja and Mega Gyarados, and Azumarill's Aqua Jet severely damage Rotom-H. Finally, watch out for special attacking Dragon-types such as Hydreigon or Latios, as they only fear Thunder Wave and Expert Belt-boosted Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p>Because of these threats, Ferrothorn makes an excellent teammate for Rotom-H. Ferrothorn resists Rock-type attacks, is able to handle Choice-locked Dragon-type attacks, and handles most Water-type Pokemon fairly well. In return, Rotom-H can defeat Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame. Mega Venusaur makes a good teammate as well for similar reasons, and as a bonus, it is a more reliable check to Azumarill because of the Superpower resistance. Mega Mawile stands out as a Pokemon that greatly appreciates Rotom-H's support moves, with Thunder Wave allowing it to OHKO faster threats and Will-O-Wisp saving it from KOs from most offensive Ground-types. In return, Mega Mawile defeats most Tyranitar variants and takes on Dragon- and Rock-type attacks. Azumarill also works well, hitting Tyranitar hard (though it takes heavy damage from Stone Edge), being immune to Dragon-type attacks, defeating Mega Gyarados, and being able to set up on burned threats with Belly Drum. Rotom-H's Volt Switch is also great for switching Azumarill in to get a free Belly Drum. Conkeldurr tanks Rock-type moves and smashes Tyranitar fairly well, while Breloom works as a Focus Sash fighter that crushes Tyranitar and Azumarill. As a bonus, both of these Fighting-types appreciate Rotom-H zapping Talonflame. Mega Kangaskhan greatly benefits from Rotom-H's ability to deal with Ferrothorn and Talonflame and can set up on Pokemon Rotom-H has burned. Finally, Mega Salamence provides a Water-type resistance, checks Mega Venusaur, revenge kills slower Dragon Pokemon, and easily sets up on burned Pokemon thanks to its great physical bulk, while Rotom-H helps deal with Thundurus.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Overheat's power is mouth watering when boosted by Choice Specs, being able to deep fry Aegislash in its Shield forme and deal massive damage to threats Rotom-H usually fails to, such as 2HKOing Mega Venusaur, and having a reasonable shot at OHKOing Hippowdon and Raikou with a Modest nature. It even deals over 50% to many Pokemon that resist it, such as Rotom-W, Hydreigon, and Garchomp. Volt Switch is a great and powerful scouting move with Choice Specs, having a great chance to OHKO Azumarill, almost always OHKOing Mega Charizard Y, and 2HKOing Rotom-W. Hidden Power Ice is Rotom-H's weapon against Dragon-types, OHKOing Garchomp and Mega Salamence and 2HKOing Hydreigon and Latios switch-ins. Trick is a great way to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Cresselia, while Thunderbolt doesn't force Rotom-H to switch out, 2HKOes Heatran, and has a decent chance of OHKOing Suicune.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>All Choice Specs Rotom-H should run as many Special Attack EVs as possible, as getting OHKOs on Pokemon such as Aegislash is extremely important. The nature and the HP and Speed EVs are far more malleable. Maximum HP and 4 SpD EVs give Rotom-H good bulk while avoiding a Special Attack boost from Porygon2's Download.</p> <p>If you want more Speed, a Modest spread of 76 HP / 24 Def / 252 SpA / 24 SpD / 132 Spe allows Rotom-H to outspeed Adamant Breloom. For outspeeding Jolly Breloom, run an EV spread of 76 HP / 24 Def / 180 SpA / 228 Spe. Finally, if you want to outspeed Jolly Gyarados, Mamoswine, and Dragonite, use a Timid nature and 76 HP / 24 Def / 188 SpA / 220 Spe. Note that all of these faster spreads are designed to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Talonflame while Stealth Rock is off the field, but these Rotom-H in general are more frail than usual.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Using Volt Switch as much as possible is usually a great way to soften up Pokemon and scout your opponent's Pokemon choices, but if you see Ground-types in Team Preview, consider throwing out Hidden Power Ice to OHKO Garchomp and Landorus-T switch-ins and Overheat to smash Mamoswine, Landorus-T, and Excadrill switch-ins. Note that while Overheat deals tremendous damage, it also makes Rotom-H fairly easy to set up on after a KO. Similarly, Hidden Power Ice is extremely easy to set up on by Pokemon that aren't weak to it.</p> <p>Rotom-H is somewhat frail even with maximum HP investment, so its usually best to switch it into defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn or after one of your Pokemon has been KOed. Rotom-H also makes a good lead because of this, being able to scout the opponent's choices early in the game. Double switching can also surprise Ground-types that were expecting a Volt Switch, putting momentum in your favor. If you see a team full of defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Cresselia, Tricking them is a great way to pave the way for your more offensive Pokemon as long as you take into account the boost in power Choice Specs provides them (especially against offensive Porygon2).</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>If possible, consider paralysis support to patch up Rotom-H's mediocre Speed, as this makes Rotom-H much more difficult to check. Porygon2 and Cresselia are among the most reliable users of Thunder Wave and can help check Ground-types. Serperior is a more offensive option that can paralyze Ground-types with Glare deal with Water-types with Leaf Storm.</p> <p>Conkeldurr is a huge help against the dreaded Tyranitar, and it appreciates Rotom-H's ability to OHKO Aegislash and Talonflame. Meanwhile, Azumarill can defeat Tyranitar and switch freely into Dragon-type attacks. Aegislash also has good synergy with Rotom-H, luring in Ground- and Fire-type moves to switch Rotom-H into, while Rotom-H severely hurts Gengar leads and OHKOes opposing Aegislash. Mega Mawile provides similar luring powers and benefits greatly from Rotom-H's immunity to Will-O-Wisp. Ground-types such as Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Excadrill can maim Tyranitar switch-ins and generally handle its Rock-type attacks.</p> <p>Consider Pokemon that can take advantage of the free switches Volt Switch offers. Greninja is a fantastic example, often being able to KO Pokemon Rotom-H has softened up. Landorus-T and Scizor are notable for being able to use U-turn to further the switching antics. Focus Sash Pokemon such as Breloom and Garchomp become far more deadly when they get a free switch, while Dragonite can retain its Multiscale if Stealth Rock isn't up.</p>"

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch is an excellent move on Choice Scarf Rotom-H, allowing it to escape before it's hit by an attack and scout what Pokemon your opponent has chosen to switch to. Overheat is Rotom-H's most powerful attack, destroying Ferrothorn, Mega Mawile, and Scizor and OHKOing Greninja that have turned into an Ice-type. Hidden Power Ice is rather weak, but it does 2HKO Garchomp and Mega Salamence while also 3HKOing Hydreigon. Trick is great for crippling walls such as Porygon2 and Cresselia, while Thunderbolt is a reliable Electric-type attack that doesn't force Rotom-H to switch out.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The listed EV spread and Timid nature allow Rotom-H to outspeed Gyarados and Dragonite after they have used Dragon Dance, while surviving two hits of Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird as long as Stealth Rock isn't set up. You can use a Modest nature with the same spread to have more power and still outspeed Mega Gengar, but this removes Rotom-H's ability to pick off weakened Mega Gyarados.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Near the early parts of the game, Rotom-H will like to use Volt Switch as much as possible to scout the opponent's Pokemon and soften them up for its teammates. However, this can be punished harshly by Ground-type Pokemon, so using Hidden Power Ice on predicted Garchomp switch-ins and using Overheat on Ground-type switch-ins can work in your favor. Just note that Overheat and Hidden Power Ice make Rotom-H extremely vulnerable against setup sweepers. If you're team can't handle a large number of Volt Switch-immune foes or Rotom-H getting set up on by a certain threat in your opponent's team, it might be best to bench Rotom-H.</p> <p>Try to be sly about Choice Scarf Rotom-H's true nature, as Choice Scarf can be a nasty surprise to many Pokemon. Try to avoid obvious plays such as switching Rotom-H into Garchomp to use Hidden Power Ice, and instead switch Rotom-H into Pokemon it usually checks such as Ferrothorn. This lets Rotom-H get surprise revenge kills on threats it normally can't deal with well, such as Greninja and Mega Lucario. This also makes walls more comfortable with switching into Rotom-H, allowing you to cripple them with Trick.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>It's best to prepare for the large number of sweepers that can set up once Rotom-H has used Overheat. Major examples include Azumarill, Volcarona, Dragonite, Garchomp, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Salamence. Tyranitar is also a massive problem for Rotom-H, as it completely walls Rotom-H. Specially attacking Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Latios also tend to wall Rotom-H. Azumarill is great teammate here, taking on Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X and Tyranitar and revenge killing weakened Volcarona with Aqua Jet. Mega Altaria helps against Mega Charizard X, Tyranitar, Volcarona, and Hydreigon. Zapdos does a good job dealing with Azumarill and can use Thunder Wave to surprise Volcarona, Mega Charizard X, and Hydreigon switch-ins. While it has poor typing synergy with Rotom-H, Choice Band Talonflame smashes Volcarona and KOes Azumarill after it has used Belly Drum. Conkeldurr hits Tyranitar with Drain Punch and can revenge kill weakened Hydreigon with Mach Punch, while Breloom trades bulk for being an excellent Focus Sash user that defeats Tyranitar and Azumarill and can even badly hurt Mega Charizard X with Rock Tomb + Mach Punch if it has a Focus Sash intact. Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mamoswine check Tyranitar, and all 3 can run Focus Sashes to solve Rotom-H's setup bait woes. Finally, Mega Venusaur does a great job against Water-types and is one of the best Azumarill counters in the game.</p> <p>Since Choice Scarf Rotom-H has a habit of crippling walls with Trick, consider Pokemon that benefit from Cresselia, Porygon2, Suicune, and other bulky Pokemon being far less effective at checking threats. Great offensive Pokemon to consider here include Garchomp, Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Salamence, Dragonite, and Mega Gyarados.</p>"

        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute is great for allowing Rotom-H to avoid Toxic and Breloom's deadly Spores. It also scouts your opponent's Pokemon if Rotom-H can force them out and saves Rotom-H from getting revenge killed by Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch without relying on Will-O-Wisp. Overheat might have poor synergy with Substitute, but being able to smash Mega Mawile, Ferrothorn, and Scizor is far too valuable to give up. Will-O-Wisp lets Rotom-H burn physical Pokemon, which is especially valuable after a use of Overheat. If you're more interested in dealing with walls, Toxic does a good job of wearing them down and ironically makes Rotom-H a great check to most opposing Rotom-H. Discharge works great as Rotom-H's Electric-type attack, as the 30% paralysis rate gives Rotom-H more chances to use Substitute. Thunderbolt does have more power, however, giving Rotom-H a reasonable chance of OHKOing Greninja while it's a Water-type and a reasonable chance to 2HKO Blaziken, stunts that are much safer to attempt when behind a Substitute.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers should always be run, as it will usually increase the number of Substitutes Rotom-H can make. The HP EVs allow Rotom-H to restore the most health possible from Leftovers while avoiding a 2HKO from Focus Sash Garchomp's Rock Tomb 98% of the time. The Speed EVs let Rotom-H outspeed Adamant Breloom, and the Calm nature and Special Defense EVs allow Rotom-H to take on Mega Charizard Y and take as little damage from the sound attacks that Rotom-H resists as possible.</p> <p>A Timid nature is also viable with an EV spread of 156 HP / 132 SpD / 220 Spe, which is designed to outspeed Jolly Gyarados, Dragonite, and Mamoswine and lets Rotom-W survive two Sludge Bombs from offensive Mega Gengar most of the time.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Be careful about switching Rotom-H in, because while this set focus on bulk, any heavy damage Rotom-H takes is going to reduce the number of Substitutes it can make. Try to switch Rotom-H on Pokemon it safely checks such as Ferrothorn and Scizor or after one of your Pokemon gets KOed against a foe that will likely switch out, such as Mega Mawile or Talonflame. You don't have to constantly use Substitute if it doesn't fit the flow of the match, either; sometimes it's best to just burn switch-ins with Will-O-Wisp and keep Rotom-H's health up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Make sure to pack Pokemon with a Rock-type resistance, as most users of such moves tend to be faster than Rotom-H. Mega Heracross in particular can smash through Rotom-H's Substitutes with Rock Blast. Specially attacking Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Latios can take anything that isn't Toxic and threaten to deal some serious damage, while Mega Charizard X sets up on Rotom-H. While Water-types are an extremely risky switch-in due to Substitute and Electric STAB type, they can switch in on Overheat and wreak havoc. Calm Mind Suicune and Raikou are especially problematic in this case, as this Rotom-H is too weak to defeat them once they start setting up.</p> <p>These problems make Ferrothorn an incredible partner. Ferrothorn resists Rock- and Water-type attacks, can take on Choice-locked Dragon-types, and, most of all, can use Leech Seed to restore some of Rotom-H's health. Mega Venusaur also works, being one of the best counters to Azumarill in the game. Serperior outpaces Calm Mind Suicune and can use a Focus Sash set to hit Dragon-types hard with a boosted Dragon Pulse. Breloom smashes through Azumarill and Tyranitar and can snipe weakened Hydreigon and hit Mega Charizard X hard with Rock Tomb if it has its Focus Sash intact. In return, Rotom-H helps these four Grass-types deal with Talonflame and Mega Salamence. A Calm Mind Raikou of your own is also helpful against Calm Mind Suicune and is hard for the special attacking Dragon-types to stop. Choice Scarf Garchomp does a great job against Mega Charizard X, Raikou, Dragonite, and Tyranitar in particular.</p> <p>Consider using some setup sweepers to take advantage of Rotom-H's burning capabilities. Belly Drum Azumarill is an excellent choice, since it's so hard to stop its setup once physical attackers are burned. Mega Salamence and Mega Gyarados also synergize well with Rotom-H. Toxic support Pokemon allow Rotom-H to effectively outstall most walls. Porygon2 and Cresselia are reliable users of Toxic, but Aegislash and Mega Salamence are also great choices, since they lure in defensive Pokemon to handle them. You can even use Toxic Spikes Greninja to threaten Toxic damage for entire teams.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-W may seem to be a bit mediocre in terms of stats, but don't be fooled: it's worth more than the sum of its parts. It's got a great defensive typing and ability, leaving it only weak to Grass-type attacks. It can also run a defensive set that makes it a good Talonflame check and able to check physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp, such as Mamoswine and Mega Salamence. Rotom-W is one of the best scouts in the game thanks to its decently powered Volt Switch and the ability to heavily damage Pokemon that are immune to the move with Hydro Pump. Finally, Rotom-W is a very competent user of Choice Specs and Choice Scarf due to its usable offensive stats and excellent use of Trick.</p> <p>Rotom-W's Achilles heel is that its merely passable stats force it to focus on either defenses or offenses at the cost of the other. Even when fully focused on defenses, Rotom-W's lack of recovery and less-than-impressive defensive stats mean that it can't withstand some of the heaviest hitters in Battle Spot Singles, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Aegislash. Rotom-W is also forced to rely on Hydro Pump as its Water-type STAB move, which can miss at the worst possible moments.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>If your team already has a Pokemon using Sitrus Berry, Leftovers is a reasonable alternative on Rotom-W. Chesto Berry + Rest gives Rotom-W some form of recovery, but this comes at the cost of a move and item slot. Pain Split helps Rotom-W stick around longer, but it's a fairly unreliable move. Reflect and Light Screen allow Rotom-W to help setup sweepers, but this comes at the cost of giving up Will-O-Wisp. Using Reflect, Rocky Helmet, and Will-O-Wisp together can be a brutal surprise to physical sweepers if you're willing to give up the moveslots as well.</p> <p>Toxic can wear down walls such as Cresselia and Porygon2, but it also gives Mega Venusaur even more reasons to switch in. If you want a better chance at inflicting paralysis, Discharge is a reasonable option over Thunderbolt. Finally, a specially defensive set is a possible option to synergize with Will-O-Wisp, but do note that Rotom-W's biggest checks tend to be specially based Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Mega Venusaur is possibly the best Rotom-W counter in the game, as it can restore its health and damage Rotom-W with STAB Giga Drain and is immune to Trick. Serperior is another great threat thanks to the power and spammability of Leaf Storm. Breloom and Ferrothorn can also be threatening if they have ways of getting around Will-O-Wisp and Trick.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Certain Dragon-types, such as Latios, Hydreigon, and Lum Berry Dragonite, can switch in on Rotom's STAB moves and Will-O-Wisp, and they can weaken it severely with their powerful Dragon-type STAB moves. Hidden Power Ice can hurt them, however, and Thunder Wave is a big problem for Latios and Hydreigon.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker Users: Excadrill and Mega Gyarados are able to either weaken or outright KO Rotom-W with Mold Breaker Earthquake, which bypasses Levitate for a super effective hit. Note that both must watch out for super effective attacks from faster Rotom-W.</p> <p><strong>Charizard: Both Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y are capable of taking advantage of Rotom-W, with Mega Charizard Y having a good chance of OHKOing even bulky variants with Solar Beam, and Mega Charizard X being able to take advantage of its Fire / Dragon typing to set up Dragon Dance on Rotom-W that lack Thunder Wave. Just note that weakened Mega Charizard Y has to watch out for Choice Scarf Rotom-W, and Mega Charizard X takes a ton of damage from Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fairy-types: Hard-hitting specially bulky Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir can handle almost anything Rotom-W throws at it, and these two can slam it hard with Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice. Mega Altaria handles Rotom-W even better, resisting both of its STAB moves and denting Rotom-W with either Hyper Voice or a status-boosted Facade.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users: Substitute not only blocks all status moves but also prevents Trick from working; notable users of the move include Mega Salamence (if Rotom-W lacks Hidden Power Ice), Substitute + Toxic Aegislash (which are sometimes Timid with maximum Speed investment), and Calm Mind Raikou.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: While it's uncommon, Magic Bounce makes Mega Sableye immune to Rotom-W's status moves; it's immune to Trick because it's a Mega Evolution; and it can use Rotom-W as fodder to set up Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Guts Users</strong>: Assault Vest Conkeldurr doesn't like being hit by Trick, but it can handle Rotom-W's weaker attacks, while the rare Choice Scarf Heracross can deal lots of damage to Rotom-W after getting burned.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is Rotom-W's strongest attack, dealing with Mamoswine and defensive Talonflame super effectively. Volt Switch is perfect for scouting the Pokemon your opponent has chosen and getting favorable switch-ins. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers and lets Rotom-W have a chance at checking Pokemon it'd otherwise struggle against such as Mega Mawile. However, Thunder Wave is a reasonable alternative to support slower teammates and cripple Serperior switch-ins. Thunderbolt is a great, reliable secondary STAB attack for finishing off foes, though Discharge can also work with Thunder Wave if you'd like an increased chance to paralyze foes. If your team is especially worried about Mega Salamence, Hidden Power Ice allows Rotom-W to check it in emergencies, and it also allows it to nail Garchomp and weakened Dragonite outside of Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Defense allows Rotom-W to check physical attackers such as Talonflame and Mega Salamence as well as possible, while Sitrus Berry turns a lot of potential 2HKOs into 3HKOs. A more offensive EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA with a Modest nature also works, allowing Rotom-W to perform better against Suicune. However, note that Rotom-W will have a much more difficult time checking physical attackers.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Usually, you'll want to use Rotom-W as a check for a large variety of physical attackers, such as Mamoswine and Talonflame. However, note that Rotom-W should only attempt to check Mega Kangaskhan in emergency situations, as Double-Edge does around 80% to Rotom-W, meaning it 2HKOes even through Will-O-Wisp. Note that while Rotom-W may seem like a great check to Suicune, it loses to Calm Mind + Rest Suicune, as well as the uncommon Mirror Coat. Make sure to take advantage of Volt Switch as much as possible, since it does a great job of scouting your opponent's Pokemon choices, breaks Focus Sashes for teammates, and gets free switches for your teammates.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Breloom, Serperior, and Mega Venusaur give Rotom-W serious problems, and special attacking Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Latios also tend to shrug it off as long as it isn't carrying Thunder Wave. This makes Mega Salamence an excellent teammate, as its Aerilate-boosted Return makes quick work of Grass-types (though watch out for Focus Sash from Breloom and Serperior), and it can even elect to run Outrage to smash through slower Dragon-types, while Rotom-W can deal with Mamoswine. In a similar manner, Talonflame does an excellent job of taking out Grass-types, while Rotom-W cripples Pokemon that use Rock-type attacks to deal with Talonflame, such as Hippowdon, Garchomp, and Tyranitar. A Mega Venusaur of your own does a great job of checking most Grass-types, while Rotom-W handles most Flying-types very well. Heatran handles most Grass-types and Choice item Dragon-types as long as it avoids Hidden Power Ground, while Rotom-W provides a vital Water- and Ground-type switch-in. Scizor and Aegislash can handle many Grass-types and Choice item Dragons, while Rotom-W provides a Fire and Ground switch-in. While Blaziken is too frail to act as a switch-in to Rotom-W's checks, it can revenge kill most Grass-types and Hydreigon, and in return, Rotom-W checks Talonflame for it. Finally, if you're especially worried about Calm Mind Suicune, Serperior can set up by using Leaf Storm on it, while Raikou can set up Calm Mind alongside it.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is Choice Specs Rotom-W's most powerful attack, making up for its mediocre Special Attack by 2HKOing important threats such as Aegislash and Mega Charizard X and even having a 90% chance to 2HKO Porygon2. Volt Switch does an excellent job of scouting your opponent's Pokemon choices, and it does a good amount of damage with Choice Specs. Trick is instrumental to this set's success, allowing Rotom-W to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Cresselia, Chansey, and Porygon2. Thunderbolt gives Rotom-W a reliable way to 2HKO a large number of threats, and it allows Rotom-W to check Calm Mind Suicune. If your team is more worried about Dragon-types, Hidden Power Ice is an acceptable alternative, 2HKOing Hydreigon and OHKOing Mega Salamence and Garchomp. It also gives Rotom-W a move to use against Serperior and Breloom switch-ins.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment allows Rotom-W to actually hit hard, while maximum HP investment lets Rotom-W survive important hits such as avoiding a 2HKO from Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird, and it also makes Rotom-W a more reliable check to Mamoswine. If you prefer Speed, you can run a spread of 76 HP / 20 Def / 198 SpA / 4 SpD / 220 Spe to outspeed Jolly Gyarados and still avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Talonflame while Stealth Rock isn't up. If you plan on using Hidden Power Ice for the faster spread, move the 4 Special Defense EVs to Defense.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Volt Switch as frequently as you can. Most Ground-types wouldn't dare switch into Rotom-W, making it an excellent scout. If you predict a Dragon-type such as Hydreigon or Latios coming in, however, use Hidden Power Ice to deal a severe amount of damage. If you really want to make Rotom-W an effective lure against defensive Pokemon, you may want to consider using double switches to prevent opponents from knowing it's holding Choice Specs. This way, you can pull off a surprise Trick against defensive Pokemon, crippling them. Finally, note that even with maximum HP, Rotom-W isn't particularly bulky, so don't switch it in too recklessly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Serperior are huge problems for Rotom-W to face, and Ferrothorn is also a huge threat if Rotom-W doesn't cripple it with Trick. Special attacking Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Latios are only threatened by Hidden Power Ice, as they can even switch into Trick. Since Rotom-W can use Volt Switch so well, you can get away with just carrying checks to these threats. Mega Salamence is a particularly excellent teammate, as it is able to smash through Grass-types with Aerilate-boosted Double-Edge, can roast Ferrothorn with Fire Blast, and even has the option to defeat Hydreigon and Latios with Dragon-type attacks (though watch out for Choice Scarf). Talonflame performs similarly well against Grass-types, but if you're especially worried about Dragon-types, Choice Scarf Garchomp and Latios can easily revenge kill them. Mega Altaria can also work well (provided that you get it in before it gets hit by a Dragon-type attack), as Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice and Return deal massive damage to opposing Dragon-types, and it can use Fire Blast to defeat Ferrothorn. While Heatran struggles against Hydreigon and Mega Venusaur, it does an adequate job of handling Serperior and Ferrothorn while also baiting Ground-type attacks for Rotom-W. Finally, while not a direct check to most of Rotom-W's problems, Mega Gengar is an excellent teammate, since Shadow Tag allows it to pick off threats Rotom-W has weakened with repeated Volt Switches.</p> <p>Since Choice Specs Rotom-W is slow for an offensive Pokemon, consider giving it paralysis support, as many threats will find it hard to revenge kill it when they're slower. Cresselia, Ferrothorn, and Porygon2 are among the most reliable users of Thunder Wave to consider. Porygon2 and Ferrothorn in particular make for good lures for Blaziken, a dangerous threat that will fall to Rotom-W when paralyzed. For more risky offensive users of paralysis, consider Thundurus and Serperior. If you're willing to roll the dice, you can use Klefki as well, which has priority Thunder Wave like Thundurus and provides a Dragon-type immunity, while Rotom-W gives a valuable Ground-type immunity and Fire-type resistance.</p> <p>Since Rotom-W is one of the best users of Volt Switch in the game, you may want to consider using it with other users of U-turn or Volt Switch to maximize momentum gained from being a step ahead of the opponent. Choice Scarf Landorus-T is one of the best U-turn users around, having the bonus of switching into Excadrill's Earthquake for Rotom-W. Choice Band Scizor works as a slower alternative that can threaten Grass-types pretty well, has a massively powerful U-turns, and can help deal with Sylveon. While it shares the same typing as Rotom-W, Mega Manectric is useful for its ability to deal with most Grass-types thanks to Flamethrower and Overheat and use Intimidate to soften blows for Rotom-W, while Rotom-W provides a valuable Ground-type immunity.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch is the move Rotom-W will be using the most, allowing it to switch out before it gets attacked and scout what Pokemon the opponent has chosen in favorable matchups. Hydro Pump is Rotom-W's most powerful STAB move, which is perfect for dealing with Ground-types such as Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Landorus-T. Trick is a great move to use against defensive Pokemon, severely limiting their utility with a Choice Scarf. It can also be a decent emergency move to limit certain offensive Pokemon such as Garchomp if needed.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ice deals a lot of damage to Garchomp and Mega Salamence, with Timid Rotom-W having an 87% chance of OHKOing 4 HP Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock damage. However, if you prefer emergency crippling options, Will-O-Wisp can be a nasty surprise for faster physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan. Being locked into Will-O-Wisp isn't great, but it can become especially useful if Rotom-W has Tricked away its Choice Scarf. Finally, Thunderbolt gives Rotom-W a reliable Electric-type attack that doesn't force it to switch out, and unlike Volt Switch, it guarantees an OHKO on offensive Talonflame. Thunderbolt is particularly useful for revenge killing weakened Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature with the above EV spread allows Rotom-W to outspeed Mega Gyarados even after it uses Dragon Dance, while the HP and Defense EVs allow Rotom-W to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Talonflame as long as Stealth Rock isn't set up. If you care more about power and not about outspeeding Jolly Mega Gyarados, consider using Modest, which allows Rotom-W to OHKO Dragonite and Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock with Hidden Power Ice. However, note that Modest needs maximum Speed to outspeed Mega Manectric, meaning it risks getting 2HKOed by Choice Band Talonflame.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Prepare to use Volt Switch as much as possible, as it allows Rotom-W to get a chance to attack without suffering massive damage, and it works as an excellent way to scout your opponent's Pokemon choices. While Rotom-W is capable of revenge killing threats, they'll usually need to be softened up first, so moves like Hydro Pump are best saved for later in the game.</p> <p>If you want to truly take advantage of Trick, try to get Rotom-W in on foes that it is naturally faster than such as Hippowdon. This hides Rotom-W's true purpose, allowing it to get a surprise revenge kill or surprise Trick in when the opponent least expects it. Just note that switching Rotom-W in recklessly isn't a wise idea, as this Rotom-W is fairly frail, so you may want to stick to switching Rotom-W into resisted hits or Ground-type attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Having a check to Grass-types is necessary, as Choice Scarf Rotom-W is especially weak to the likes of Mega Venusaur, Serperior, Breloom, and Ferrothorn. Additionally, Hydreigon and Latios are even bigger problems than normal. Mega Salamence is an excellent teammate, taking down Grass-types, and even potentially taking down non-Choice Scarf Dragon-types if using a Dragon-type attack, while in return, Rotom-W can take Ice-type attacks for Mega Salamence and threaten to cripple defensive Pokemon with Trick. Talonflame doesn't do as well against Dragon-types, but it deals with Grass-types fairly well, except for Focus Sash Breloom. Mega Altaria can handle Dragon-types fairly well and can help against Ferrothorn and Serperior. Heatran doesn't do great against Hydreigon, but it's a reasonable check to Serperior and Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Consider pairing Rotom-W with sweepers that benefit from walls such as Cresselia and Porygon2 getting crippled. Good teammates to consider include Mega Kangaskhan, Garchomp, and Mega Gyarados. To make the deal even sweeter, you might want to consider Pokemon that use Substitute well, such as Aegislash, Gliscor, and Raikou.</p>"

  "Serperior": {
    "overview": "<p>No one would have ever thought about using Serperior until the long-awaited release of its Dream World ability, Contrary. This ability, when combined with Leaf Storm, gives Serperior a 130 Base Power STAB move with the side effect of a Nasty Plot, allowing it to attack and boost its Special Attack at the same time! This would have turned Serperior into a terrifying special sweeper if it weren't for its middling special movepool, which is limited to Dragon Pulse and Hidden Power for coverage. This has led to the rise of defensive Serperior being the more popular set as a way to check physical attackers with the combination of Reflect, Synthesis, and Rocky Helmet, with Leaf Storm tacked on to maintain an offensive presence. Serperior can also make use of several other great support moves including Glare, Taunt, Light Screen, and Leech Seed.</p> <p>Serperior is gifted with a great Speed stat, which allows it to outspeed key physical threats such as Garchomp and Mega Kangaskhan, as well as anything slower, meaning it can quickly set up Reflect before being attacked or pick off a weakened foe with Leaf Storm while gaining the Special Attack boost. Being weak to common Pokemon such as Talonflame, Blaziken, Mega Salamence, and Greninja, as well as being a little frail without Reflect set up and weak before a Leaf Storm boost, might make it seem as though Serperior would be a poor choice for your team; however, as far as Grass-type options go, having access to Contrary and not taking up a Mega slot are huge points in Serperior's favor.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Giga Drain can be used on the all-out attacker set as a way to recover health, but it is weak without Special Attack boosts and severely outclassed by Leaf Storm as a way to deal damage. Light Screen is an option for patching Serperior's Special Defense on the Solid Snake set, but Serperior generally prefers Glare's support or Hidden Power Rock's coverage. Knock Off can be used to cripple item-reliant Pokemon, but the Solid Snake set isn't fazed by many items and the all-out attacker would rather be trying to boost or KO the foe. Mirror Coat can be used alongside a Focus Sash as a way to surprise special attackers. Mean Look can be used to trap Pokemon that Serperior can set up on, but it requires Serperior to give up valuable coverage or Glare. Swagger can be used in conjunction with Glare to form a parafusion set, but it's better done by Pokemon such as Klefki and Liepard, which have access to Prankster. Hidden Power Ice can be used over Dragon Pulse as a way to still hit Dragon-type Pokemon, but especially Salamence and Dragonite, as well as Garchomp and Landorus-T; however, it means losing Fire- or Ground-type coverage, which leaves Serperior walled by Steel-types. Leech Seed is an option on the Solid Snake set as a way to passively recover health while also whittling down the health of the foe; however, Synthesis usually provides enough recovery, and Glare is overall more valuable in the last slot. A Choice Scarf or Choice Specs can be used to spam Leaf Storm more quickly or more powerfully, respectively; however, being locked into Leaf Storm will leave Serperior walled by anything that resists Grass, and Serperior's coverage moves are quite weak when it can't make use of its boosts from Leaf Storm.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Talonflame: Talonflame ignores Serperior's Speed with priority Brave Bird and OHKOes it unless Reflect is up. It also 4x resists Leaf Storm, but it has to watch out for Hidden Power Rock.</p> <p><strong>Greninja</strong>: Greninja is naturally faster than Serperior and can OHKO it with Ice Beam. It can't switch into a Leaf Storm, though, and has to watch out for Glare.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence</strong>: Mega Salamence is naturally faster than Serperior and can KO it with an Aerilate-boosted Return or Double-Edge. It can also use Serperior as setup fodder for Dragon Dance due to its 4x resistance to Leaf Storm, but it has to watch out for a boosted Dragon Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar resists Leaf Storm due to its Poison typing and can KO Serperior with Sludge Bomb. Mega Gengar is even bigger trouble because it outspeeds Serperior and traps it with Shadow Tag.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Mega Charizard X and Y, Blaziken, Heatran, Rotom-H, Volcarona, and Chandelure all resist Leaf Storm and can KO Serperior with their Fire-type STAB moves. Serperior can carry Hidden Power Rock or Ground, however, so they have to watch out for that.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Aegislash, Mawile, Ferrothorn, Scizor, Skarmory and Klefki all resist Leaf Storm and are usually bulky enough to outlast Serperior. They need to watch out for a super effective Hidden Power, though, especially Ferrothorn and Scizor, as they are 4x weak to Hidden Power Fire, Serperior's preferred type.</p> <p><strong>Fast Electric-types: Raikou, Mega Manectric, Jolteon, and Choice Scarf Thundurus-T are immune to Glare by virtue of their typing, outspeed Serperior, and can 2HKO it with Hidden Power Ice or, in Mega Manectric's case, Flamethrower. Thundurus can also paralyze Serperior with Prankster Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos: Zapdos not only is immune to Glare due to its Electric typing, but it also resists Leaf Storm and can stall out its PP with Roost and its ability, Pressure.</p> <p><strong>Porygon2</strong>: While it can't tank boosted Leaf Storms, Download Porygon2 can come in against the Solid Snake set and receive a Special Attack boost, after which it stands a good chance to OHKO Serperior with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Cresselia and Chansey</strong>: If Serperior lacks Taunt, Cresselia and Chansey are solid counters to Serperior and can stall it out with their recovery and status moves.</p>",

        "name": "Solid Snake",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Reflect is used to lessen the damage received from physical attackers such as Garchomp and Mega Kangaskhan, which allows Serperior to take more hits and thus inflict more damage with its Rocky Helmet. Synthesis is important for healing so that Serperior can continue to stall physical attackers. Leaf Storm is Serperior's main source of offense, and it works well in conjunction with Contrary to give it a +2 boost in Special Attack every time it hits the foe; this brings Serperior's power to great levels even without Special Attack investment after a couple of boosts. Glare is fantastic for supporting Serperior's teammates, as the Speed drop can allow slower Pokemon such as Dragonite, Suicune, Porygon2, and Glalie to outspeed faster foes and can provide opportunities to set up or heal when they become fully paralyzed. It is also a great safe option when predicting a switch, as only Electric-type Pokemon are immune to it, and the only notable Electric-type Pokemon that is comfortable switching into Serperior is Zapdos. Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit Pokemon that resist Leaf Storm, such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard X and Y, Mega Salamence, and Dragonite, as well as many other Fire- and Flying-types, but it is quite weak without several boosts. Taunt is an option for shutting down defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, Cresselia, and Sableye.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature with 172 Speed EVs allows Serperior to outspeed Garchomp, the fastest, most relevant physical attacker that Serperior should be used to wall, while the remaining EVs are put into HP and Defense to allow Serperior to check physical attackers as well as possible. 116 HP and 220 Defense EVs give the best balance and allow Serperior to avoid an OHKO from Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge and take less than 50% from it with Reflect up, meaning Serperior can stall it with Synthesis. If using Hidden Power Rock, you'll need to increase the Speed EVs to 176 to still outspeed Garchomp due to the IV drop involved; this makes the most efficient balance of HP and Defense 140 HP (31 IV) and 192 Def (30 IV). This does, however, give Adamant Mega Kangaskhan a very minor chance to OHKO with Double-Edge due to the drop in Defense. Rocky Helmet is the best item to use, as it inflicts chip damage on physical attackers, allowing Serperior to whittle them down into Leaf Storm's KO range.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set aims to check physical attackers and allow Serperior to boost its Special Attack against them while it tanks their moves. Serperior is actually quite frail without Reflect being set up, so it is best to either lead with this Serperior or get it onto the field after a slow Volt Switch or U-turn or after one of your own Pokemon has been knocked out so that it doesn't have to take unnecessary damage. If you can predict a weaker move such as Kangaskhan's Fake Out or Garchomp's Earthquake, Serperior can use those as an opportunity to switch in without taking too much damage. Try to get Reflect set up as soon as possible; however, if you predict a switch to a special attacker, it might not be the best move. Glare is usually the safest option, as only Electric-type Pokemon are immune to it, and the paralysis support is often more beneficial to Serperior's teammates than Reflect's Defense boost. Once Serperior is comfortably behind Reflect against a physical attacker or the foe has been weakened enough, it can begin using Leaf Storm to boost its Special Attack and attempt a sweep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Serperior is a sitting duck against Flying- and Fire-type Pokemon, both of which are a common sight in the Battle Spot Singles metagame and include powerhouses such as Mega Salamence, Talonflame, Mega Charizard X and Y, and Blaziken, so adequate team support is necessary. Landorus-T is an excellent choice due to its ability to offer defensive support with Intimidate, get Serperior onto the field safely with U-turn, and take on these Pokemon. Mega Manectric, while being much frailer, is an example of a Pokemon with Intimidate and access to a pivoting move in Volt Switch. Suicune pairs well, as it forms a strong physically defensive core with Serperior and is capable of taking Ice-type attacks from Pokemon such as Greninja lacking Grass Knot, Weavile, and Mamoswine. Mega Charizard X and Y both are handy partners for Serperior, as they are able to take on Steel-types such as Aegislash, Mega Mawile, Scizor, Ferrothorn, Mega Metagross, and Heatran. Mega Charizard Y also provides sun support with its ability Drought, which increases the amount of HP Serperior receives from Synthesis. Porygon2 is a decent partner for its ability to check Pokemon such as Greninja, Talonflame, and Mega Salamence. It also appreciates the support that Reflect and Glare provide. Clefable greatly appreciates the support from Reflect and Glare too, as it allows it to set up Calm Mind and Minimize more easily against physical attackers.</p>"

        "name": "Offensive Leaf Storm",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leaf Storm, in combination with Contrary, is the only reason to use this set, and it is the main move that you will be selecting in battle. Hidden Power and Dragon Pulse are chosen as a means of hitting the Steel- and Dragon-type Pokemon that resist Leaf Storm. Fire is the preferred type, as it hits Ferrothorn and Scizor for 4x super effective damage and hits Skarmory super effectively. Ground can be used instead to hit Heatran hard. Dragon Pulse hits Mega Salamence, Mega Charizard X and Y, Dragonite, Latios, Latias, Hydreigon, and Mega Sceptile, but Leaf Storm is more powerful against Garchomp because of its secondary Ground typing. Glare is the preferred option in the last slot for its ability to paralyze anything that isn't an Electric-type, but Taunt can be used to stop Pokemon such as Chansey and Cresselia from using their many status moves. Hidden Power Rock can be used as a way to surprise Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y switch-ins, but doing so leaves Serperior walled by Steel-types.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Because Hidden Power Fire requires an even IV in both Special Attack and Speed, 248 EVs in these stats is the most efficient number at level 50. The leftover 12 EVs are put into Special Defense to give Download Porygon2 an Attack boost. If using Hidden Power Ground, an EV spread of 248 SpA / 8 SpD / 252 Spe should be used. Timid is used to get the jump on fast Pokemon such as Garchomp, Mega Lucario, Latios, Latias, Mega Kangaskhan, and everything else in the crowded base 100 Speed tier. Focus Sash is used because Serperior is actually quite frail and is prone to being OHKOed by stronger attacks. A Life Orb can be used instead to give Serperior a much-needed boost to its attacks. A Lum Berry is also an option to protect against Thunder Waves and Swaggers, which are quite common in the metagame.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Focus Sash Serperior does not want to switch into attacks, as this breaks the Focus Sash, rendering it useless. Therefore, it is best to either lead with Serperior or bring it in as a revenge killer. Life Orb and Lum Berry Serperior can switch more freely; however, it is still unadvised due to Serperior's frailty. Try to take advantage of Water-type Pokemon such as Azumarill, Suicune, and Rotom-W to start gaining boosts with Leaf Storm, or start boosting by finishing off slower foes such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Gyarados that have been weakened to within Leaf Storm's KO range. Serperior's coverage moves are quite weak before boosting, so even if you can hit something super effectively with them it is advised to try to boost first so that they can do more respectable damage. If you predict a switch, Glare is a great option, as often boosting against a switch-in is wasted by Serperior needing to switch out, whereas paralysis lasts the whole match.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As mentioned previously, Serperior is actually quite frail and falls victim to bulkier Pokemon that it cannot KO, so it needs strong defensive support to succeed. Intimidate users such as Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, and Gyarados are great for their ability to beat Serperior's Fire-type checks, whereas the Attack drop granted by Intimidate can also help Serperior take some physical attacks itself. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Rotom-W, and Mega Slowbro are fantastic for taking on strong physical attackers such as Talonflame and Mega Kangaskhan and help create two-thirds of a Fire / Water / Grass core. Mega Charizard X or Y can be used to take on the many Steel-types that wall Serperior, such as Aegislash. Mega Charizard Y also provides sun support, which increases the power of Serperior's Hidden Power Fire, while both Mega formes appreciate having opposing Water- and Rock-types dealt with by Serperior. Porygon2 can help check Greninja, Talonflame, and Mega Salamence. Garchomp can be used to dispatch Fire- and Steel-types and also enjoys having Serperior to deal with bulky Water-types. Slow Volt Switch and U-turn users can be used to help get Serperior onto the field safely; these include Rotom-W, Scizor, and defensive Landorus-T.</p>"

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Excadrill is backed by a great Attack stat, solid typing, and access to two fantastic abilities in Mold Breaker and Sand Rush; the former allows easier spam of its STAB Earthquake, allowing it to hit Levitate users such as Rotom-W, Gengar, Latios, and Hydreigon, while the latter gives it tremendous Speed during a sandstorm, allowing Excadrill to outspeed the entire metagame and potentially sweep unprepared teams. On the defensive side, Excadrill has mediocre bulk, meaning it has a hard time switching in against powerful attackers. Additionally, because Excadrill is weak to common priority moves such as Aqua Jet and Mach Punch, it is fairly easy to pick off. However, due to its Steel / Ground typing, Excadrill can take advantage of a predicted Thunder Wave or Toxic and switch in for free. Excadrill's most powerful attribute, being one of the fastest Pokemon in the game during a sandstorm, is severely hindered by its poor defensive synergy with Tyranitar and Hippowdon, the only two Pokemon with access to Sand Stream, as they are all weak to Water moves and Excadrill also shares a Ground and Fighting weakness with Tyranitar. For this reason, Excadrill best works as a revenge killer by making use of its great Speed while holding a Choice Scarf and using its powerful Earthquake to finish off a weakened team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>You can forego Swords Dance on the Sand Rush set and opt for setting up your own sandstorm if needed; however, this faces the same issues as using Swords Dance in that it gives the opponent a free turn to get in a check or potentially cripple Excadrill. Magnet Rise can be used alongside an Air Balloon to force Pokemon that rely on Earthquake to KO Excadrill to use their coverage moves. Rapid Spin can be used to remove entry hazards from the field; however, these are very uncommon in Battle Spot, so it is usually not worth the moveslot. If your team features Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, or Volcarona and you absolutely need Stealth Rock removed, it can be used. Aerial Ace is an option to nail Mega Heracross and Breloom, although it's quite useless outside of those threats. A Passho or Chople Berry can save Excadrill from being picked off by an Aqua Jet or Mach Punch, respectively, and maybe even net it a surprise KO in the process. Sand Force might seem like a viable option; however, the Choice Scarf set appreciates the ability to hit Levitate users with Earthquake more than the increased power, and the huge Speed boost from Sand Rush is much more beneficial than Sand Force's power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Excadrill has no way of powering past Pokemon such as Suicune, Azumarill, (Mega) Slowbro, Swampert, Blastoise and Gyarados (save for Rock Slide), and they can all KO with their Water-type STAB moves. Sets utilizing Swords Dance can muscle past some of these if Excadrill has already boosted before they come in.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types and Earthquake users: Pokemon such as Garchomp, Mega Salamence, Landorus, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Mega Kangaskhan can easily survive an attack from Excadrill and retaliate with their own Earthquake</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves: Aqua Jet and Mach Punch bypass the Speed boost from a Choice Scarf or Sand Rush and hit Excadrill for super effective damage. Common users include Azumarill, Feraligatr, Crawdaunt, Conkeldurr, and Breloom. Of these, only Crawdaunt can OHKO an Excadrill at full health, so unless Excadrill has received some prior damage, it can get off an attack before going down.</p>",

      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Excadrill's most powerful STAB move and is more reliable due to Mold Breaker ignoring the ability Levitate and allowing Excadrill to hit Pokemon that possess it, the most notable of which is Rotom-W, which would otherwise counter this set. Excadrill can also outspeed Gengar and OHKO it with Earthquake. Iron Head is Excadrill's secondary STAB move and is notable in being able to flinch the opponent, which works great when combined with a Choice Scarf. It also hits Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Togekiss for super effective damage. Rock Slide gives great neutral coverage with Earthquake and allows Excadrill to hit Flying-types such as Zapdos, Thundurus, Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Gyarados super effectively, which avoid Earthquake and don't mind an Iron Head. Horn Drill and Fissure are 30% accurate OHKO moves and can act as a last-resort option against Pokemon that Excadrill cannot KO with any of its other moves. Horn Drill is the preferred option, as it hits everything except Ghost-types; however, the most common Ghost-types in Battle Spot are Aegislash and Gengar, and they are both hit hard by Earthquake anyway. Notable Pokemon that are hit by Fissure include Sableye and Jellicent, so the choice is up to you. Another benefit of Mold Breaker is that Excadrill can hit Pokemon with the ability Sturdy with its OHKO move; these include Skarmory and Donphan.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An offensive EV spread is used to maximize Excadrill's Speed with a Choice Scarf and give it as much power as possible. The Choice Scarf is chosen to give Excadrill the jump on faster Pokemon such as Mega Manectric, (Mega) Gengar, Choice Scarf Chandelure, Greninja, Raikou, and Mega Lucario and KO them with Earthquake. Adamant is the preferred nature, as it gives Excadrill some additional power to use alongside the Speed that the Choice Scarf provides; however, a Jolly nature can be used instead to get the jump on neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon at +1, including Mega Charizard X, Mega Blaziken, and Volcarona, and KO them with the appropriate move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Excadrill works best as a revenge killer, utilizing its high Speed and powerful Earthquake to finish off weakened teams. Leading with it might put you in an unfavorable matchup, forcing you to sacrifice it or switch out, both of which give your opponent momentum. Even though Excadrill's Attack stat is quite high, it is unable to OHKO bulkier threats at full health and its mediocre bulk leaves it susceptible to being KOed back or severely weakened in the process, so getting prior damage on the opponent's team will allow Excadrill to come in and easily finish them off. This also allows you to scout the opposing team for Flying-types, which are immune to Earthquake.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to Excadrill's ability to take out Electric-types as well as his 4x resistance to Rock moves, it makes a great partner for Pokemon such as Gyarados, Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, Mega Pidgeot, Mega Pinsir, and Togekiss. Excadrill desperately needs help getting past bulky Water- and Ground-types, so bringing a Grass-type such as Mega Venusaur, Mega Sceptile, Roserade, or Serperior is a good idea. Excadrill can also help them by revenge killing the Fire- and Flying-types that give them trouble.</p>"

        "name": "Sand Sweeper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Excadrill's strongest move and main sweeping tool. Earthquake hits key threats such as Aegislash, Mega Manectric, Mega Blaziken, Mega Gengar, and Mega Charizard X. Iron Head is Excadrill's secondary STAB option; it works well with the Speed boost of Sand Rush, as it can pull off clutch flinches. Its main targets are Togekiss, Sylveon, and Mamoswine. Rock Slide gives great coverage alongside Earthquake and can also make foes flinch. It works great against Zapdos, Thundurus, Mega Charizard Y, and Talonflame, as they are all immune to Earthquake and resist Iron Head. Swords Dance gives a tremendous boost to Excadrill's Attack stat, and when paired with the insane Speed provided by Sand Rush, it allows Excadrill to sweep teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximize Excadrill's Attack and Speed for optimum sweeping potential; the remaining 4 EVs go into Defense, as it is preferred to have an odd HP stat when using a Life Orb to minimize the recoil Excadrill receives from it. Life Orb gives a 30% boost to Excadrill's attacks at the cost of 10% HP; this gives Excadrill a much-needed increase in power while also allowing flexibility with its move choices. Excadrill doesn't like taking hits in the first place, so the recoil from the Life Orb isn't too much of an issue. Azumarill can pick Excadrill off with Aqua Jet after two rounds of Life Orb recoil, though, so watch out for that. An Earth Plate or Soft Sand can be used instead to keep Earthquake hitting hard and prevent recoil, at the cost of losing a lot of power to Excadrill's other moves. Adamant is the preferred nature, as it gives Excadrill extra power and it still outspeeds everything in the tier that hasn't boosted its own Speed. Jolly is also an option to stop Timid Trace Gardevoir from coming in, outspeeding Excadrill, and OHKOing it with Focus Blast. It also allows Excadrill to get the jump on Jolly Mega Salamence after a Dragon Dance, Adamant Sharpedo after two Speed boosts, and Adamant Mega Charizard X and Mega Blaziken after two boosts.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Sand Rush Excadrill needs an active sandstorm to make use of its fantastic Speed stat, so bring it in once you have set it up. Pokemon such as Azumarill and Conkeldurr can bypass Sand Rush and KO Excadrill with some prior damage with their super effective priority moves, so eliminating these is a top priority. Using Swords Dance can give Excadrill an enormous boost to its attacks, but it uses a valuable turn of sandstorm to set up and also leaves Excadrill vulnerable to being attacked. Only use it if you are matched up against a Pokemon that is likely to switch out and you know you can afford the turn of sandstorm. Switching Excadrill in on Electric-types such as Thundurus and Raikou is your best chance to set up a Swords Dance.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bringing either a Tyranitar or Hippowdon is mandatory to set up the sandstorm necessary for Excadrill to abuse Sand Rush. The problem with them is that they share weaknesses with Excadrill including Water, Fighting, and Ground. You also need a teammate that can easily take care of Azumarill, which is probably Sand Rush Excadrill's biggest threat. Venusaur and Roserade work well, as they resist Excadrill's— as well as Tyranitar's or Hippowdon's— weaknesses and can also deal with Azumarill well. Serperior can also come in and start setting up Leaf Storm boosts against most things that threaten Excadrill's sweep. Latias and Latios make for good partners, as they resist Water and Fighting while being immune to Ground thanks to Levitate, while Excadrill resists their Dragon, Fairy, and Bug weaknesses. They can also manually set up sandstorm, while Latias can even use Healing Wish to get Excadrill in safely and also heal it in the process.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Excadrill's most powerful STAB option, utilizes Mold Breaker by hitting Levitate users such as Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Gengar for super effective damage, and hits key threats such as Aegislash, Mega Manectric, Mega Charizard X, and Heatran for super effective damage. Iron Head is Excadrill's secondary STAB option and offers valuable super effective coverage against Pokemon such as Sylveon, Togekiss, Clefable, and Mamoswine. The choice between Rock Slide and Rock Tomb is personal preference: Rock Slide has more power, while Rock Tomb sports slightly better accuracy and drops the target's Speed by one stage, which can allow Excadrill to outspeed a faster opponent on the next turn or allow a teammate to come in and outspeed it. It also makes revenge killing much easier. Swords Dance offers a significant increase in power and allows Excadrill to power past bulky Pokemon such as Cresselia, Porygon2, Ferrothorn, and Aegislash. Stealth Rock provides entry hazard support, which helps break enemy Focus Sashes while also taking a chunk out of Charizard and Talonflame. It also works great with Mold Breaker, as Magic Bounce users such as Espeon and Mega Absol can't reflect it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An offensive EV spread is used to give Excadrill as much power and Speed as possible, with the remaining EVs put into Special Defense to ensure Excadrill survives a Focus Blast from Mega Gengar when equipped with an Assault Vest. An Adamant nature is preferred over Jolly to give Excadrill a boost to its attacks, guaranteeing the OHKO on Mamoswine and Mega Manectric (accounting for Intimidate); on the other hand, Jolly gets the jump on neutral-natured base 100 speed Pokemon such as unboosted Mega Charizard X, Volcarona, and Entei. A Focus Sash is the preferred item, as it allows Excadrill to avoid an OHKO and be left with 1HP, meaning it can either get in an attack before going down or to ensure that Stealth Rock gets set up. An Air Balloon makes Excadrill immune to Ground attacks, namely Earthquake, and forces the opponent to use a weaker move to pop the Air Balloon. This is especially helpful against Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence, although Excadrill shouldn't be trying to fight them anyway. An Assault Vest cannot be used with either Swords Dance or Stealth Rock, which is why Horn Drill is used in the fourth slot. Assault Vest notably allows Excadrill to survive a Hydro Pump from defensive Rotom-W and Focus Blast from offensive Mega Gengar, while Excadrill can KO both with Earthquake.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Excadrill needs to avoid switching in, as taking an attack will break its Focus Sash or pop its Air Balloon, which is why this set works best as a lead. From the lead position, Excadrill can easily set up Stealth Rock and then either switch out or start attacking. If using an Air Balloon, you can make use of predicted Earthquakes to switch Excadrill in for free. Beware of Fake Out users such as Mega Lopunny, Infernape, Mega Medicham, and Mienshao, as they can all break Excadrill's Focus Sash with Fake Out and proceed to KO it with a super effective move. You can also take advantage of Pokemon such as Cresselia, Porygon2, and Thundurus to switch in on a Thunder Wave or Toxic and set up a Swords Dance.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that enjoy Stealth Rock support to either discourage Talonflame switching in or have the opposing Pokemon's Focus Sashes being broken to aid their sweep make for good partners to this set; these include Greninja and Blaziken. Venusaur can help Excadrill deal with Azumarill and Breloom, while it appreciates having Excadrill to take out Talonflame.</p>"

  "Conkeldurr": {
    "overview": "<p>Conkeldurr is not a common sight in Battle Spot Singles, but it is still a force to be reckoned with. It's well-known as one of the best users of Assault Vest in the game, thanks to the perfect combination of Drain Punch, a move that recovers Conkeldurr's health without conflicting with Assault Vest's requirements; the increased-priority move Mach Punch, which can be used for revenge killing; Knock Off, a useful coverage option that also removes the foe's item; and its ability Guts, which allows it to switch in on status moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Scald, Thunder Wave, and Toxic for its teammates without any fear of being completely crippled. Unfortunately, while Assault Vest does give Conkeldurr impressive mixed bulk, it is usually overly reliant on Drain Punch to keep itself healthy, and Conkeldurr can find itself taking more damage than it can recover against foes that take little from this attack. On top of this, its power can be somewhat lacking if it's not inflicted with a status or hitting a foe for super effective damage. However, despite these flaws, Conkeldurr is a very useful utility option and a worthy Fighting-type Pokemon to consider to combat the Porygon2, Kangaskhan, and Ferrothorn that run rampant in the format.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Conkeldurr has two other fantastic abilities aside from Guts that it can use with some effectiveness—the first, Iron Fist, strengthens punching moves, giving a great power boost to Drain Punch, Mach Punch, and Ice Punch. While good, Iron Fist is usually a less attractive option than Guts due to the latter's status-absorbing utility, despite its more situational nature. The second ability, Sheer Force, can be used well in conjunction with Life Orb to grant a significant boost in power to most of Conkeldurr's coverage moves; however, none of Conkeldurr's Fighting-type moves receive the boost from Sheer Force, aside from the weak Force Palm and the unreliable Dynamic Punch, so if Conkeldurr needs to hit an opposing Pokemon with a STAB move or Knock Off, it has to take Life Orb recoil and compromise its HP. Conkeldurr gets a few other useful moves aside from those listed: Bulk Up can be used well in conjunction with a specially defensive spread and Rocky Helmet to punish physical attackers and capitalize on Conkeldurr's above-average physical bulk. However, it's slow to set up and it can be difficult to find an opportunity to use it as a win condition. Thunder Punch is a niche but useful move for hitting Gyarados extremely hard while also covering Flying-type switch-ins. Damage-boosting items such as Choice Band and Flame Orb (with Guts) are viable on Conkeldurr; however, the latter puts Conkeldurr on a timer, whereas the former has a lock-in effect that can make Conkeldurr a liability when paired with its slowness and relative special frailty compared to that of the Assault Vest set. However, the damage boost makes Conkeldurr's moves a force to be reckoned with, particularly the increased-priority Mach Punch.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Talonflame: Talonflame is capable of cleanly OHKOing all but the most physically bulky Conkeldurr with STAB Brave Bird and only fears Rock Tomb or Thunder Punch on the switch in. Thanks to Brave Bird's increased priority, Conkeldurr can't even hope to score a surprise counter-KO with Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence</strong>: Mega Salamence is capable of surviving Ice Punch after Intimidate even without investment and OHKOes Conkeldurr with an Aerilate-boosted Double-Edge or Return. Salamence can also turn Conkeldurr into setup fodder if it is a bulky variant with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Mega Mawile: While Mega Mawile doesn't resist Conkeldurr's STAB moves, it is bulky enough to take a Drain Punch with ease and obliterate Conkeldurr with Play Rough. Intimidate also neuters Conkeldurr's offensive capability against Mawile, meaning that it can safely set up Swords Dances in front of Conkeldurr with little consequence.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Psychic-types: Slowbro and Cresselia take paltry damage from Knock Off and can sit in front of Conkeldurr and spam Psychic-type attacks or set up Calm Mind while also passively damaging Conkeldurr with Rocky Helmet at least once.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon That Resist Fighting: Offensive Pokemon such as Azumarill, Gyarados, Sylveon, Mega Gallade, Mega Gengar, and Mega Latias take little damage from Conkeldurr's STAB moves and can overwhelm Conkeldurr with powerful attacks. Some of these fall to coverage moves such as Knock Off and Poison Jab, but their superior Speed allows them to do significant damage to Conkeldurr if they survive, weakening it and making it setup fodder for another member of their team.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Assault Vest",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Drain Punch is Conkeldurr's primary STAB attack; it hits hard against Pokemon such as Chansey, Mega Kangaskhan, Porygon2, Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, and Heatran and replenishes Conkeldurr's health in the process. Mach Punch is an increased-priority move and serves as Conkeldurr's secondary STAB attack. It's mainly used to bypass Conkeldurr's low Speed and pick off weakened offensive Pokemon such as Bisharp and Focus Sash Garchomp. Knock Off hits Ghost- and Psychic-types, which are immune to or resist Conkeldurr's Fighting-type STAB moves, super effectively. It also has utility in removing items such as Porygon2's Eviolite. However, it does little to Cresselia, which doesn't usually mind having its item removed. Ice Punch is Conkeldurr's most useful coverage option for removing threats such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Mega Salamence, which take little damage from Conkeldurr's other attacks. Poison Jab or Rock Tomb could be used over Ice Punch to hit threatening Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Clefable or to hit Talonflame and Charizard on the switch, respectively.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Assault Vest set aims to take advantage of Conkeldurr's best traits while patching its one big flaw—its special frailty. With this in mind, an EV spread that emphasizes Conkeldurr's natural attacking power and bulk is recommended. A simple spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def is the most efficient for maximizing both power and mixed bulk; however, a number of different spreads can be used to improve Conkeldurr's matchup against Mega Kangaskhan, the main threat that Conkeldurr needs to beat as a Fighting-type. 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Def can be used to take Double-Edge better and heal more of Conkeldurr's HP with Drain Punch due to the relative lack of HP investment; however, it compromises Conkeldurr's special bulk significantly, especially if its Assault Vest is removed by a foe's Knock Off. 148 HP / 108 Atk / 252 Def is an interesting spread that can be used to survive Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out and Double-Edge 100% of the time while still being near-guaranteed to 2HKO back with Drain Punch and Mach Punch. It also makes Conkeldurr slightly more specially resilient than the above spread does. Finally, a Brave nature can be used to underspeed 0 Spe IV Aegislash and OHKO it in Blade Forme with Knock Off. Brave is also useful on Trick Room teams to ensure that Conkeldurr outspeeds as many Pokemon as possible under Trick Room's effect.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Conkeldurr is a versatile Pokemon with a lot of applications and uses on a team. It makes a fine switch-in for otherwise very threatening Pokemon such as Greninja and Thundurus, but it also has a couple of counters that can turn it into a liability or outright KO it, among them such common sights as Azumarill and Cresselia. Also, while it is very bulky with Assault Vest, Conkeldurr's bulk isn't insurmountable, so care must be taken around strong attackers to ensure that Conkeldurr isn't overwhelmed. Conkeldurr's ability to turn status ailments into a benefit with Guts makes it a good switch-in for common status move users such as Rotom-W, Porygon2, Cresselia, Thundurus, and Suicune—however, keep in mind that the sight of Conkeldurr in Team Preview may deter the opponent from recklessly using status, so be careful when switching into a Pokemon that may instead use a super effective move and cut into Conkeldurr's HP. Against many foes, Conkeldurr is more or less safe to just spam Drain Punch, lowering their pool of HP while keeping Conkeldurr's relatively full; however, don't underestimate the utility of Knock Off, as even aside from its good type matchup against Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Aegislash and Cresselia, most Pokemon in the format don't appreciate losing their item, making Knock Off a very safe move to use if you predict a foe to switch in. Mach Punch is a fantastic tool for revenge killing, especially if Conkeldurr is statused. This move alone can make Conkeldurr an unexpectedly useful cleaner, as many of the threats in the format only need to be weakened a little bit to make Mach Punch an OHKO. Lastly, Ice Punch is purely a coverage move, but the targets it hits, mainly the myriad Flying-types in the format such as Togekiss, Zapdos, and Mega Salamence, are important targets that Conkeldurr appreciates being able to remove.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Conkeldurr is definitely a Pokemon that is at its best when it's supporting its teammates; however, that doesn't mean it needs no support to function properly. Many of its issues stem from Pokemon that resist Fighting-type moves, such as Zapdos, Talonflame, Cresselia, and Azumarill, as they take little damage from Drain Punch, thereby preventing Conkeldurr from healing back much of the damage it has taken, and are able to wear it down. As such, Pokemon that can efficiently deal with these threats, such as Raikou, Mega Gengar, Mega Manectric, and Steel-types such as Aegislash and Heatran, are useful Pokemon for Conkeldurr to be paired with to allow it to support the team more efficiently. One of Conkeldurr's main flaws is its low Speed stat, so it especially appreciates speed control such as Thunder Wave or Trick Room; Thundurus and Cresselia are excellent users of these respective moves and have good type synergy with Conkeldurr. As for Pokemon that benefit from Conkeldurr's presence, fast offensive Pokemon such as Greninja and Mega Salamence appreciate its help in dealing with status abusers such as Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Porygon, which can cripple them with Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp. Conkeldurr can use the Guts boost to muscle through them with ease and remove them from the battle. Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Rock- and Steel-types, such as Sylveon and Talonflame, appreciate Conkeldurr's powerful STAB Drain Punch for clearing those threats.</p>"

  "Whimsicott": {
    "overview": "<p>With access to Prankster and a huge supporting movepool, Whimsicott is very useful for disrupting the opposing team. Its base 116 Speed makes Whimsicott the fastest Prankster user in the Battle Spot metagame, outspeeding other Prankster users such as Thundurus, Liepard, Klefki, and Sableye along with base 115 Speed Pokemon such as Raikou and Starmie. Whimsicott's Fairy / Grass typing is great defensively, giving it an immunity to Dragon and some useful resistances, such as to Fighting, Dark, Water, Electric, and Ground, but it also gives Whimsicott an extra weakness to Steel and a 4x weakness to Poison. Whimsicott is also an excellent stallbreaker, being able to utilize Encore + Taunt against defensive Pokemon, such as Chansey, Clefable, and Cresselia, locking them into a status move and causing them to use Struggle afterwards.</p> <p>However, Whimsicott has little to no offensive presence, leaving it with very few attacking options outside of its STAB attacks Moonblast and Giga Drain. Its 60 / 85 / 75 bulk leaves a lot to be desired, which prevents Whimsicott from being able to take several strong attacks. Because of Whimsicott's reliance on support moves, it often becomes bait for other Taunt users if it isn't running Taunt itself. Whimsicott also lacks reliable recovery outside of Leech Seed, so it's heavily reliant upon the move. Its typing also gives it trouble against Fire-, Flying-, Steel-, Poison-, and Ice-types such as Talonflame, Heatran, Gengar, and Mamoswine.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Giga Drain can be used alongside Leech Seed to recover more HP and hit Rock-, Water-, and Ground-types such as Terrakion, Rotom-W, and Mega Swampert; however, Moonblast is a much better attacking option because it hits some of the most common threats in the metagame, such as Mega Salamence, Mega Lopunny, and Sableye. Memento decreases the foe's Attack and Special Attack by two stages, allowing Whimsicott's teammates to set up. This forces the foe to either attack the sweeper or switch out, giving the sweeper a free turn to set up without taking any damage. U-turn can be used as a hit-and-run option to pivot out of a terrible matchup, and it helps with gaining momentum. Focus Sash + Endeavor can be used with Memento and Tailwind with Whimsicott at level 1 to cripple particularly troublesome threats such as Mega Salamence, Suicune, and Cresselia. It can then use either Memento or Tailwind to help one of its teammates set up. However, this set is useless against Mega Kangaskhan and Ghost-types.</p> <p>A set with Switcheroo and Choice Specs can be used to cripple defensive Pokemon and physical attackers. However, Whimsicott needs to be careful because many teams can switch their Mega Evolution into it. This forces Whimsicott to switch out, giving the opposing team a free turn to set up or attack Whimsicott's teammate. Switcheroo + Choice Specs can also be used to cripple physical attackers and defensive Pokemon. The set's other moves are Hurricane, to hit Bug- and Grass-types such as Heracross and Serperior; Hidden Power Fire, to hit Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory; and either U-turn or Moonblast. A Timid nature should be run on such a set, along with maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs. However, the set is inferior to Whimsicott's stalling set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Whimsicott is easily walled by Steel-types, as it has no offensive coverage moves and many Steel-types resist both of its STAB attacks. Ferrothorn can't be paralyzed by Stun Spore due to its Grass typing and can OHKO Whimsicott with Gyro Ball. Excadrill and Magnezone can easily KO Whimsicott with Iron Head and Flash Cannon, respectively. Magnezone also can't be paralyzed, so Stun Spore is useless against it. Aegislash can easily handle Whimsicott with either Iron Head or Flash Cannon. Heatran is 4x resistant to Whimsicott's STAB moves and can KO it with its own STAB moves in return. Mega Metagross is also a problem for Whimsicott to overcome and can use either Bullet Punch or Meteor Mash on it.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Talonflame is much faster than Whimsicott thanks to its base 126 Speed, allowing it to easily OHKO Whimsicott with Brave Bird. Zapdos isn't affected by Stun Spore due to its Electric typing and can anticipate a Taunt from Whimsicott. Zapdos can also use Heat Wave to hit it for super effective damage. Mega Salamence can OHKO Whimsicott with Aerilate-boosted Double-Edge; however, it does need to watch out for Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Attackers: Whimsicott hates being hit by hard attacks, so it often has to rely on Substitute to shield itself from taking major damage. Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Kangaskhan can continue to attack Whimsicott, getting rid of Substitute every time Whimsicott uses it and then KOing it. Mega Kangaskhan deserves a special mention because its ability, Parental Bond, can break Whimsicott's Substitute and damage Whimsicott itself on the second hit. Chandelure can also bypass Substitute due to Infiltrator and OHKO Whimsicott with its STAB Fire-type moves. Mega Blaziken and Greninja can OHKO Whimsicott with Flare Blitz or Blaze Kick in the former's case and Ice Beam or Gunk Shot in the latter's case; however, both get paralyzed by Stun Spore.</p> <p><strong>Poison- and Grass-types: Gengar and Mega Gengar can make quick work of Whimsicott. Mega Gengar can also trap Whimsicott with Shadow Tag, keeping it from switching out. Mega Venusaur is immune to Stun Spore and Leech Seed and can take any attack Whimsicott dishes out. Both Gengar and Mega Venusaur can OHKO Whimsicott with Sludge Bomb. Grass-types are immune to Stun Spore and Leech Seed, so they can use that to their advantage. Serperior can use Leaf Storm in order to deal with Whimsicott and its teammates after it faints.</p> <p><strong>Hyper Voice Users: Many Hyper Voice users can take advantage of Whimsicott's low Special Defense due to the move bypassing Substitute. Mega Salamence, Mega Altaria, and Mega Gardevoir can all be problematic because they get a boost from either Aerilate or Pixilate. Sylveon can OHKO Whimsicott with Pixilate- and Choice Specs-boosted Hyper Voice as well.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users: If Whimsicott lacks Taunt, it's easily shut down by opposing Taunt users such as Thundurus, Liepard, Sableye, and opposing Whimsicott, forcing it to either use Moonblast or switch out. Serperior gets a special mention because not only can it use Taunt, but it's also immune to Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce: Magic Bounce users shut down Whimsicott's stalling capabilities. Mega Sableye, Espeon, and Mega Absol can all use Whimsicott's support moves as their opportunity to set up on it with Calm Mind or Swords Dance. Espeon also has access to recovery in Morning Sun, which can help it stall Whimsicott. However, both Mega Sableye and Mega Absol need to watch out for Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit Moves: Whimsicott is susceptible to multi-hit attacks such as Icicle Spear. Notable users include Mamoswine and Cloyster, both of which can get rid of Whimsicott's Substitute and continue to inflict damage on it. Cloyster also has Skill Link and can use Whimsicott as setup bait for Shell Smash, but it needs to watch for Whimsicott's Encore and Stun Spore.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Cotton Stall",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Encore allows Whimsicott to gain the upper hand as it forces the foe to use the same move for three turns. Whimsicott can use that to its advantage by switching out into a more dangerous threat to the opposing team or setting up Leech Seed, Substitute, or Cotton Guard. Leech Seed is Whimsicott's main recovery move, as it applies pressure on offensive Pokemon and slowly wears down their health while Whimsicott regains a little bit of health back. It can also switch out into one of its teammates, as they can recover health from Leech Seed as well. Moonblast is a great STAB move because it hits Fighting-, Dragon-, and Dark-types such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Salamence, and Sableye. It also keeps Whimsicott from being complete Taunt bait if it's not running Taunt itself. Substitute allows Whimsicott to avoid status from common moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Toxic. Whimsicott can use that in conjunction with Encore and Leech Seed to lock its foe into a move while behind a Substitute. Substitute also keeps it from being hit by powerful attacks and can help scout the foe's move.</p> <p>Taunt can be used instead of Substitute so that Whimsicott can act as a stallbreaker towards defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia, Chansey, Gliscor, and Suicune. Taunt and Encore can be used together to cause the opposing threat to use Struggle if it is locked into a non-attacking move. Stun Spore can be used in order to cripple faster Pokemon, most notably Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Excadrill, and Mega Evolutions such as Mega Gengar, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Metagross. It has a niche in paralyzing Ground-type Pokemon as well. Cotton Guard boosts Whimsicott's Defense by three stages, allowing it to take physical attacks more effectively; for example, it helps Whimsicott survive Mega Salamence's Double-Edge and other physical attacks that would normally KO it. However, this makes Whimsicott vulnerable to status moves. Prankster Tailwind can be used as a more situational move. Even though Whimsicott doesn't benefit from the move, it can be sacrificed after using the move to send of one of its teammates in, allowing the teammate to outspeed Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Garchomp.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>204 HP EVs let Whimsicott hit 161 HP, and 52 EVs are invested in Special Defense for added bulk, helping Whimsicott take hits better. 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow it to outspeed base 115 Speed Pokemon and every Prankster user. Leftovers is used for passive recovery in conjunction with Leech Seed every turn. A Bold nature with maximum HP and Defense investment can be used instead of a Timid nature to take damage more effectively; however, Whimsicott will then have trouble outspeeding Prankster users such as Thundurus and Liepard. It also keeps Whimsicott from outspeeding Adamant Mega Salamence.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Whimsicott's primary role is to switch into Pokemon that you'd expect to set up or use a support move of their own so that it can Encore them. This allows Whimsicott to set up either Substitute or Leech Seed to help stall out the foe. If Taunt is being used instead of the two moves mentioned already, it can force the threat to use Struggle, making it take recoil damage and giving Whimsicott another free turn to use any of its support moves. Encore will also give one of Whimsicott's teammates a chance to set up by locking the foe into a useless status move or an attack that one of your setup sweepers resists. Use Stun Spore on very fast Pokemon in order to gain the Speed advantage over the opposing team. This will also help in allowing your Pokemon to set up for a sweep when the opposing team is fully paralyzed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Lucario is immune to Poison-type moves and can handle Fairy-, Ice-, Poison-, and Steel-types such as Sylveon, Mamoswine, Mega Gengar, and Heatran for Whimsicott. Mega Charizard X is also a nice partner because it can take on Bug-, Grass-, and Steel-types that threaten Whimsicott such as Mega Scizor, Serperior, and Aegislash. In return, Whimsicott can switch into Dragon- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Mega Charizard X. Heatran pairs very well with Whimsicott because it resists or is immune to all of its weaknesses. Whimsicott also does the same for Heatran's weaknesses to Fighting-, Ground-, and Water-type moves. Heatran can deal with Talonflame, Ferrothorn, Aegislash, Mega Gengar, and Weavile, while Whimsicott can take on Garchomp, Rotom-W, and Conkeldurr. Talonflame is also a good partner because it can easily get rid of pesky Grass-types with STAB Brave Bird.</p> <p>Water-types, such as Suicune and Rotom-W, can form a perfect core with Whimsicott and Heatran. Rotom-W can also make use of Will-O-Wisp, softening physical attacks for Heatran and Whimsicott. Both Suicune and Rotom-W can take care of Fire-types such as Blaziken, opposing Heatran, and Rotom-H. Cresselia also makes for a good partner because it can take many attacks and deal passive damage to foes such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Salamence, and Mega Blaziken with Rocky Helmet. In return, Whimsicott can take Dark-type attacks for Cresselia.</p>"

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn’s great mixed bulk, diverse support movepool, and unique Grass / Steel typing make it a valuable asset to both offensive and defensive teams alike. There seems to be an endless list of Pokemon Ferrothorn can check, most notably Mega Kangaskhan, Landorus-T, Breloom, Sylveon, and virtually every Water-type in the metagame. Thanks to Iron Barbs, it can also act as a deterrent to physical attackers in general. For example, when Ferrothorn is still alive, Talonflame and Mega Charizard X will have to be careful about using Brave Bird or Flare Blitz. A few of Ferrothorn’s most notable drawbacks include poor Speed, average offensive presence, vulnerability to burns, and a weakness to the common Fighting- and Fire-type attacks. Ferrothorn will have to occasionally think twice before attempting to fight a Pokemon it is supposed to check, as the foe might unexpectedly carry a move of one of those types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Band set with Power Whip, Gyro Ball, Knock Off, and a filler move is the most notable alternative set Ferrothorn can run, utilizing its high-Base Power attack to really leave a mark. To give an example of its power, a Choice Band-boosted Gyro Ball is strong enough to OHKO Garchomp. Some choices for the filler move include Bulldoze, Bullet Seed, and Explosion. Bulldoze can severely damage Heatran, Lucario, and Blaziken, while also reducing their Speed. Bullet Seed can break Focus Sash from the likes of Mamoswine and Terrakion, and can damage Glalie after breaking its Substitute. Explosion simply deals a large amount of damage to most foes that don't resist it and can OHKO Mega Charizard X.</p> <p>Focus Sash is an alternative item that can be used to really surprise some of its most common checks. For example, if Ferrothorn can bait the opponent's Mega Charizard X or Mega Charizard Y to fight it one-on-one, it can survive any Fire-type attack with Focus Sash, paralyze it, and set up Stealth Rock. Ferrothorn will most likely faint after setting up Stealth Rock, but in return, it has essentially neutered the Charizard and granted your team an entry hazard advantage. Occa Berry can be used to survive a Fire-type attack in a similar fashion, although Ferrothorn will probably not survive most STABed Fire-type attacks in the game. Sitrus Berry is an option as well due to the constraints of Item Clause.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon and Fire-type attacks: There is no better way to get rid of Ferrothorn than to hit it with a 4x super effective move. Furthermore, some of the metagame's most powerful threats are Fire-types, such as Blaziken, Mega Charizard Y, Mega Charizard X, Heatran, and Talonflame, and giving them an opportunity to switch in can be disastrous to not only Ferrothorn, but also to the rest of its teammates. Non-Fire-type Pokemon such as Zapdos, Mega Salamence, Mega Kangaskhan, Slowbro, and even Greninja may carry a Fire-type attack (Hidden Power Fire in Greninja's case). Grass-type Pokemon with Hidden Power Fire such as Mega Venusaur and Serperior get a special mention due to being immune to Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Lucario and Blaziken can OHKO Ferrothorn with their Fighting-type STAB attacks. Blaziken can additionally threaten Ferrothorn with its Fire-type STAB moves. Both Pokemon can switch into Ferrothorn's attacks easily, but fear Thunder Wave. Conkeldurr can absorb Thunder Wave, receive an attack boost from Guts, and punish Ferrothorn with Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Burn Inducers: Ferrothorn lacks reliable recovery and uses physical attacks. Therefore, a burn from the likes of Rotom-W and Mega Gengar using Will-O-Wisp or a Water-type Pokemon such as Suicune or Slowbro using Scald can really shorten Ferrothorn's time on the field. Mega Gengar can force this status ailment onto Ferrothorn thanks to Shadow Tag.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: Magic Bounce renders Leech Seed, Stealth Rock, and Thunder Wave useless. Mega Sableye's high physical bulk ensures that Ferrothorn can't deal much damage, and it can burn Ferrothorn with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Mega Mawile</strong>: Mega Mawile resists Power Whip and takes very little damage from Gyro Ball due to its low Speed. It is, however, still faster than Ferrothorn and can quickly destroy it with Fire Fang. Alternatively, it can set up Swords Dance on it. Regardless, due to the menacing power Mega Mawile holds, the team with Ferrothorn must be very careful to limit this Pokemon's opportunities to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Magic Guard</strong>: Being Ferrothorn's indirect damage is always helpful. Clefable and Reuniclus can threaten to set up on Ferrothorn thanks to said immunity and beat it up with a super effective move; Flamethrower or Fire Blast in Clefable's case, and Focus Blast in Reuniclus's case.</p> <p><strong>Trick and Switcheroo Users: Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Latios are able to Trick their Choice items onto Ferrothorn, drastically reducing its walling and stalling ability.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leech Seed grants Ferrothorn a steady recovery option and wears down foes, particularly bulkier ones such as Cresselia, Porygon2, and Suicune. Power Whip is a strong STAB attack that is useful for heavily damaging Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Hippowdon, and Excadrill. Gyro Ball takes advantage of Ferrothorn’s extremely low Speed and strikes many offensive threats at 150 Base Power. Some notable Pokemon it covers include Breloom and Gengar, and it also hits Kangaskhan, Garchomp, Blaziken, and both Mega Charizard formes much harder than Power Whip. Knock Off provides a utility in removing items and also threatens Aegislash, which is faster than Ferrothorn and risks being struck in its Blade forme. Thunder Wave cripples unsuspecting sweepers such as Mega Charizard X and Volcarona, but it weakens Gyro Ball.</p> <p>Protect synergizes with Leech Seed and Leftovers to make Ferrothorn a long-lasting wall, allowing it to accumulate more residual damage. Stealth Rock provides team-wide support by rendering Focus Sash almost ineffective and can add a valuable amount of residual damage to help Ferrothorn's teammates sweep. It also deals heavy damage to Charizard, Volcarona, and Talonflame. Iron Head can be used over Gyro Ball for better synergy with Thunder Wave, as Thunder Wave significantly reduces Gyro Ball's damage. Toxic is another status move that can take advantage of Ferrothorn's stalling capabilities and threaten Pokemon such as Zapdos and Talonflame.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment optimizes Ferrothorn's performance against the heavy number of physical threats in the metagame. It ensures that Adamant Mega Salamence cannot OHKO it with Double-Edge after a single Dragon Dance boost and that Talonflame cannot 2HKO it with Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird. A specially defensive spread is viable, taking advantage of Ferrothorn's slightly lower but still respectable Special Defense stat. It allows it to take on Greninja, Raikou, and Choice Specs Rotom-W and Sylveon more easily.</p> <p>Leftovers is preferred to make use of Ferrothorn’s stalling abilities and to patch up its lack of reliable recovery. Rocky Helmet can further deter physical attackers, as it can deal a combined 29% damage with Iron Barbs against a single contact attack. Against Mega Kangaskhan's contact attacks, this combination can wipe out a staggering 58% of her HP!</p> <p>If running Iron Head, use an Impish nature and 12 Speed EVs to outrun paralyzed, positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon. Running 84 Speed EVs grants Ferrothorn enough Speed to outrun paralyzed Mega Gengar, but it does put a strain on Ferrothorn's overall bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Make use of the huge list of Pokemon Ferrothorn checks, but in some matchups, try to scout for potential anti-Ferrothorn measures before staying in. For example, if you want to use Ferrothorn to check Sylveon, you should try to scout for Hidden Power Fire. This can be accomplished through the use of Protect and/or double switching. Another example is Azumarill; avoid Superpower if you can. Double switch if necessary, and make use of Ferrothorn’s strong pivoting quality provided to it by its resistances, bulk, and Iron Barbs.</p> <p>Evaluate whether to Leech Seed, Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, or attack as you see fit. Leech Seed is the safest move to throw out, as it is effective against all Pokemon bar Grass-types. Use Stealth Rock if you anticipate a longer battle or are in need of that residual damage on key targets. For example, your Mega Salamence will have a much easier time dealing with Thundurus and Zapdos with Stealth Rock on the field. It may also be in your interest to immediately set Stealth Rock up if you anticipate that your opponent will bring Charizard, Talonflame, or Volcarona. However, using Stealth Rock also means a one-time free switch in for many threats, so do not set it up without thinking about it. Thunder Wave is an excellent way to cripple sweepers that love switching into Ferrothorn, such as Blaziken, Lucario, and Mega Charizard X.</p> <p>Use an attack to immediately threaten the foe and to combat Substitute users. However, Ferrothorn is not a wallbreaker; you probably won’t get a lot of opportunities to predict a switch-in and punish it with a direct attack.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Salamence, Dragonite, Latias, Latios, Gyarados, Talonflame, Azumarill, Mega Charizard Y, Slowbro, and Mega Altaria are all viable options to cover Ferrothorn's weaknesses to Fire and Fighting. Ferrothorn also covers most of their weaknesses and its Stealth Rock support can be invaluable for them as well.</p> <p>Ferrothorn is a solid partner for Blaziken, as it covers a number of Blaziken's checks, such as Hippowdon, Cresselia, and Suicune. Adding in Zapdos to the mix covers Talonflame, Mega Salamence, and Azumarill. Together, these three form a balanced trio that can blanket check most Pokemon in the metagame.</p> <p>Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and a Pokemon that resists Fire also act as a strong core. Rotom-W and Rotom-H are the most notable options as they also resist Flying, making it difficult for Talonflame and Mega Salamence to break the core.</p> <p>Politoed can provide Ferrothorn with rain support to reduce its Fire weakness, while Ferrothorn resists both Electric and Grass. Ferrothorn's long list of resistances is always helpful for a rain team.</p>"

  "Hydreigon": {
    "overview": "<p>​ Hydreigon is an incredibly powerful special attacker in Battle Spot Singles, capable of running numerous different sets both as a wallbreaker and a revenge killer. Its Dark / Dragon typing grants it fantastic neutral coverage that hits every type bar Fairy for neutral damage, allowing it to threaten many popular threats such as Aegislash, Cresselia, and Rotom-W. Between Draco Meteor and Dark Pulse, few Pokemon beyond Chansey and Fairy-types have an easy time switching into Hydreigon, and a very diverse movepool with coverage options including Fire Blast, Earth Power, and Focus Blast also complements Hydreigon's powerful offensive presence. Hydreigon's ability to run both Choice Specs and Choice Scarf effectively also allows it to threaten both offensive and defensive teams and adds an element of surprise that can throw an unsuspecting opponent off guard. Defensively, Hydreigon's typing alongside Levitate grants it a wide range of resistances and immunities, which helps it find numerous opportunities to switch in and start punching holes in the opponent's team. However, while base 98 Speed places Hydreigon in a decent Speed tier, it leaves it just short of the important base 100 range, which in turn leaves it outsped by many threats when it's not holding a Choice Scarf, including Mega Kangaskhan and Garchomp. Hydreigon is often reliant on Choice items as well, which makes it more predictable and can risk giving an opponent a free turn. Fairy-type Pokemon also ruin Hydreigon's day, so it always needs a teammate that can help deal with threats such as Azumarill and Sylveon before it can start breaking teams with Draco Meteor and Dark Pulse. However, despite these shortcomings, Hydreigon still stands as one of the most effective special wallbreakers in the format.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragon Pulse is an option on Choice Specs sets for a Dragon-type STAB move that doesn't lower Special Attack, but Dark Pulse gets enough coverage for the most part, and it's hard to replace another move. Flash Cannon is effective for punishing repeated Fairy-type switch-ins but is otherwise not very useful. Most Fairy-types boast a respectable Special Defense stat anyway, and it's not a good move to be locked into either. U-turn can also be used on Choice sets to gain momentum and scout a potential Fairy-type switching into Hydreigon, though it comes at the cost of a valuable coverage move.</p> <p>On the Life Orb set, Taunt is an effective option for dealing with defensive Pokemon such as Suicune and Porygon2, preventing them from setting up or crippling Hydreigon with status moves. Thunder Wave is an option that can surprise Hydreigon's usual faster switch-ins, letting it support its team a bit while also letting it handle these faster switch-ins by itself. While Hydreigon's ability to force many switches gives this nice utility, giving up an attacking move for it is difficult. A more unconventional physically defensive Rocky Helmet set utilizes both Taunt and Thunder Wave alongside Roost and Dark Pulse. While this gives up Hydreigon's more impressive offensive prowess, this set threatens stall teams more effectively and can prevent Pokemon like Hippowdon from setting Stealth Rock or using Yawn. It can also muscle through Chansey, a Pokemon that most stall teams rely on to beat Hydreigon, with Dark Pulse flinches in conjunction with Thunder Wave.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Hydreigon can't touch most Fairy-types with either of its STAB moves, so they are huge threats to it. Azumarill in particular doesn't mind any of Hydreigon's moves and can threaten setting up with Belly Drum or OHKOing it with Play Rough. Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir threaten Hydreigon with Hyper Voice, but they must be careful of switching into the occasional Choice Specs-boosted Flash Cannon. Klefki does not appreciate Fire Blast or Earth Power, but it can switch into either STAB move and paralyze it.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: While Draco Meteor threatens most Fighting-types, many of them have some way to get around Hydreigon. Mega Blaziken is incredibly difficult for Hydreigon to beat because even Choice Scarf variants lose out due to Speed Boost. Mach Punch from Assault Vest Conkeldurr and Breloom can also revenge kill Hydreigon. The former can also hit Hydreigon with Drain Punch to recover most damage that Hydreigon might do, whereas the latter can put switch-ins to sleep with Spore. Mega Lopunny threatens with High Jump Kick, though Choice Scarf variants can still threaten it with Draco Meteor. Mega Lucario resists both STAB moves and can threaten Hydreigon with Vacuum Wave, though it doesn't want to switch into Fire Blast or Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Move Users: Weavile and Mamoswine can both KO Hydreigon with Ice-type moves, with Ice Shard to revenge kill a weakened Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Both of these also often run Focus Sash, so Hydreigon has trouble winning against these two. Greninja threatens Hydreigon as well with Ice Beam, though it doesn't have Ice Shard to deal with Choice Scarf variants if it lacks Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: While it's difficult to check Hydreigon defensively, Chansey can switch into any of Hydreigon's common moves and threaten to paralyze or Toxic stall. However, it must be careful with Taunt and Roost variants. Goodra can also switch into any of Hydreigon's moves bar Draco Meteor and threatens to KO back, though the lack of recovery can be difficult.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: While Choice Scarf Hydreigon can revenge kill many fast threats, anything that can surpass Hydreigon's awkward base 98 Speed is very problematic for it. Choice Scarf Garchomp and Jolly Mega Charizard X at +1 threaten even Choice Scarf variants and OHKO Hydreigon with Outrage; Garchomp in general is particularly problematic, as Focus Sash is a another dangerous possibility. Jolly Mega Kangaskhan can threaten Choice Specs and Life Orb sets with Double-Edge or Low Kick, and it can even use a weakened Hydreigon as a setup point for Power-Up Punch.</p> <p><strong>Playing Around the Choice Lock: Hydreigon will often run Choice Specs or Choice Scarf, so taking advantage of the fact that it will lock itself into a move and need to switch out will often put Hydreigon at a disadvantage. This can create an opening for a Pokemon to set up if the Hydreigon player doesn't switch out, so a setup sweeper can put heavy pressure on a Choice-locked Hydreigon.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is incredibly strong with a boost from Choice Specs, and it will often OHKO or 2HKO Pokemon that don't resist it. This will generally be used when you need to remove a threat as soon as possible, and it puts incredible pressure on teams that lack many sturdy switch-ins for a Dragon-type move. However, Draco Meteor can't be used recklessly due to the Special Attack drops, so Dark Pulse gives Hydreigon another powerful STAB move that doesn't lower Special Attack and can be used more easily due to the lack of Pokemon that resist Dark-type moves. Fire Blast complements Hydreigon's Dark / Dragon STAB combination and is used to hit Steel-types such as Mawile, Klefki, Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Skarmory, all of which threaten Hydreigon or force it out otherwise. However, the risk of missing Fire Blast can be critical in a fast-paced format, so Flamethrower is an acceptable option as well despite the power drop. Earth Power can be used to hit Heatran and Tyranitar harder, which Fire Blast can't do, and also has a chance to 2HKO Choice Band Azumarill in an emergency. However, it can leave you open to a Flying-type or Levitate switch-in, so it's not always safe to be locked into. Alternatively, Focus Blast can be used to break through Tyranitar more effectively than Earth Power can, although the accuracy can prove problematic. It also lets Hydreigon threaten Porygon2, but it has few other uses and is ineffective against Fairies.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack EVs maximize damage output, and 252 Speed EVs help make the most of Hydreigon's Speed tier. The final 4 EVs are put into Special Defense specifically so that a Porygon2 with Download will get an Attack boost instead of a Special Attack boost. Modest is generally the preferred nature because Hydreigon wants all the power it can get, but Timid is an option to get the jump on Adamant Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard X. Choice Specs is also necessary to let Hydreigon punch holes into the opposing team effectively, as it allows Hydreigon to OHKO Rotom-A with Draco Meteor and Aegislash with Dark Pulse, even in Shield forme.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is primarily a wallbreaker, so it excels against defensive teams and slower bulky offensive teams. Draco Meteor and Dark Pulse grant incredible neutral coverage that is only resisted by Fairy-types, so these two moves are the ones Hydreigon should be using most often. Draco Meteor OHKOes most Pokemon that don't resist it, so if your opponent lacks a Steel-type or Fairy-type, this is a fairly safe choice. Dark Pulse is the safest option otherwise and doesn't force Hydreigon to switch out as often, and it can be used very freely due to the lack of Dark-resistant Pokemon. All of Hydreigon's coverage moves should be used carefully, as they put Hydreigon at a much greater risk of being used as setup fodder. If there is significant risk of an opponent switching in something that can take advantage of Hydreigon being locked into Fire Blast, Earth Power, or Focus Blast, it may be a better idea to use Dark Pulse for a safe hit or simply switch Hydreigon out. Focus Blast in particular presents this risk, as there is very little reason to use it if the opponent lacks a Porygon2 or Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Aegislash has perfect type synergy with Hydreigon and can deal with Fairies comfortably. They also form an effective wallbreaking core that can be very difficult for slower teams to deal with. Much like Aegislash, Mega Metagross and Mega Mawile have fantastic type synergy with Hydreigon and appreciate its ability to threaten Heatran, Rotom-A, and Cresselia. Azumarill and Talonflame also like having defensive threats such as Rotom-A removed. Mega Venusaur is a good partner for Hydreigon, as it handles the Fairy-types that give Hydreigon trouble while appreciating its ability to threaten Psychic-types; it is also generally a sturdy switch-in that can ease the risks of Hydreigon locking itself into a bad move. Hydreigon's ability to break down sturdy walls makes it a great partner for Mega Kangaskhan as well, which can more easily overwhelm teams with threats like Slowbro and Sableye out of the way. Hydreigon itself appreciates paralysis support to help it outspeed faster threats, as many Pokemon rely on its awkward Speed tier to revenge kill it. Pokemon such as Serperior, Ferrothorn, Rotom-A, and Cresselia are great partners for this, with Serperior in particular being able to paralyze Ground-types such as Garchomp and Landorus-T with Glare.</p>"
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor and Dark Pulse are the two main STAB moves, and with a Choice Scarf they'll be used to clean up threats. Earth Power provides great coverage for hitting Steel-types such as Heatran, Klefki, and Mawile while also letting Hydreigon hit Tyranitar harder. Fire Blast and Flamethrower cover the Steel-types that don't mind Earth Power such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory, but otherwise they cover most of the same threats as Earth Power. Running both Earth Power and a Fire-type move is viable as well. Dragon Pulse lets Hydreigon clean up a weakened team late-game without having to worry about Draco Meteor's stat drops, at the cost of reduced type coverage. Despite the redundancy with Draco Meteor, it's a useful option to have due to the fantastic neutral coverage when Fighting-types and Dark-types are a danger late-game. Focus Blast is an option almost exclusively for Porygon2 and Tyranitar and is pretty weak on a Choice Scarf set, but Hydreigon has a difficult time breaking through either of these two without it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EVs maximize Speed and Special Attack to take full advantage of the Choice Scarf boost. The Choice Scarf set has a significantly lower damage output than Hydreigon's other sets, so a Modest nature is used to avoid sacrificing too much power. However, Timid is equally viable to capitalize on its role as a revenge killer, managing to outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Adamant Mega Charizard X at +1. The final 4 EVs are placed in Special Defense to stop Download Porygon2 from getting a Special Attack boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As Choice Scarf Hydreigon is a revenge killer, avoid leading with it and attempt to bring it in primarily after a partner has been KOed to revenge kill something. Hydreigon's Dark typing grants it a resistance to Sucker Punch, which makes it an effective check to Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Mawile, and Bisharp. Finding safe opportunities to switch in is important, as this Hydreigon's increased Speed tier allows it to threaten many faster and frailer threats, giving it the opportunity to dent something with Draco Meteor. However, don't use Draco Meteor too often early in the game because it can be a huge momentum killer, and because this Hydreigon is not a wallbreaker it lacks the power to OHKO many threats. Due to its lack of a power-boosting item, this set is also far less effective against bulkier teams with threats like Tyranitar and Chansey. However, bluffing a Choice Specs by bringing it in against a bulky threat can force a switch, as there are many threats that can't afford to stay in if Hydreigon's item has not been revealed, which can be just enough to take advantage of the game. Likewise, this set can surprise faster threats that expect a Choice Specs set, so try to keep your opponent guessing with Hydreigon's item whenever it's possible.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Hydreigon generally fits primarily on teams in need of a strong revenge killer, so teams are not often built around it. Aegislash stands out as the most prominent teammate, capable of handling the Fairy-types that give Hydreigon trouble. Aegislash also makes up for this set's lack of wallbreaking power and boasts perfect defensive synergy with Hydreigon. Blaziken and Mega Metagross have great type synergy with Hydreigon as well and appreciate its ability to threaten Slowbro and Rotom-A while functioning as a switch-in to Ground-type moves. Wallbreakers and sweepers that like having fast Pokemon like Mega Kangaskhan and Garchomp out of the way make for great partners, such as Belly Drum Azumarill and Mega Heracross. Checking Azumarill is especially important for this set, so Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Serperior are great partners for that. Pokemon that can take care of defensive teams, such as Mega Gengar and Mega Mawile, make up for Hydreigon's inability to break through them by itself.</p>"
      },
      {
        "name": "Life Orb",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Life Orb Hydreigon trades the speed and power of Choice sets for the ability to wallbreak with the freedom to change moves. Draco Meteor and Dark Pulse are the primary STAB moves, and the ability to switch between moves makes it easier to choose a move. Hydreigon isn't punished as harshly for choosing the wrong STAB move, so it's much more difficult to play around it through effective switching, though Dark Pulse will still generally be the safer option due to the lack of drops. As for coverage moves, Earth Power is great on the Life Orb set because the ability to switch moves eliminates the risk of being forced out against Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate. Fire-type moves are strong choices for hitting Ferrothorn and Scizor, and the risk of Heatran coming in isn't as problematic due to the ability to freely choose Earth Power on the next turn. Focus Blast hits Porygon2 and Tyranitar, although it has few other targets and has a significant risk of missing. Alternatively, Roost can be used to increase Hydreigon's longevity amidst Life Orb recoil and any other damage that might add up. However, this set thrives on its ability to choose coverage moves more freely, so the reduced coverage that comes with running Roost is not without drawbacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb grants Hydreigon a nice power boost and the ability to switch moves freely at the cost of recoil. Hydreigon wants to maximize its wallbreaking ability, so maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows it to hit as fast and hard as possible. The leftover EVs are placed in Special Defense to prevent Porygon2 from getting a Special Attack boost with Download. A Modest nature is preferred over Timid, as this set is more likely to be worn down due to recoil and is not likely to last long enough to pull off a sweep even with the Speed boost from a Timid nature.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set functions as a wallbreaker. The draw to this set is the ability to switch moves, as oftentimes an opponent will try to take advantage of the Choice lock to beat Hydreigon. Draco Meteor hits insanely hard, but you must be careful when using it early because the Special Attack drop will quickly force Hydreigon out, which ruins the staying power that Life Orb provides over Choice Specs. Clicking coverage moves doesn't sacrifice as much momentum, so less prediction is required when clicking Earth Power. This also applies to the other coverage moves, so the risk of locking Hydreigon into a move and giving a foe a free setup opportunity is not as crippling. Roost can keep Hydreigon healthy and should be used to punish forced switches or against something that can't hurt Hydreigon much. It also prevents the opponent from stalling until Life Orb recoil brings Hydreigon down.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Paralysis support is incredibly helpful for letting Hydreigon break through teams, so Serperior, Cresselia, and Rotom-W make for strong partners. This set is more crippled by status itself and hates the residual damage from burns, so Lunar Dance Cresselia is an especially effective partner here. Cresselia also beats Blaziken, which otherwise has an easy time beating Hydreigon. Aegislash has perfect type synergy with Hydreigon, can deal with Fairy-types, and forms a less restricted wallbreaking core between the two that's more difficult to play around without a Choice-locked Hydreigon. Mega Metagross functions similarly alongside Hydreigon, trading Aegislash's superior defensive typing for the ability to threaten faster Pokemon. Blaziken also appreciates Hydreigon's ability to break common defensive threats such as Slowbro, Cresselia, and Gliscor, while Blaziken threatens Chansey in return. Additionally, Hydreigon appreciates Stealth Rock to help it secure KOs. Garchomp in particular can wear down a threat with Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet while setting up Stealth Rock, while Ferrothorn can use Leech Seed to mitigate Life Orb recoil a bit if a foe does not switch out. Ferrothorn can also provide paralysis support and checks Fairy-types, so it makes for a particularly effective partner.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Volcarona stands out as a powerful special attacker in a format dominated by physical attackers, boasting a unique offensive typing that lets it threaten a wide variety of threats, such as Cresselia, Aegislash, Mega Mawile, Ferrothorn, Hydreigon, and Slowbro, with its STAB moves. Volcarona's naturally high Special Attack and Speed along with access to Quiver Dance make it an effective sweeper that is made more dangerous with the fact that most walls are physically defensive rather than specially defensive. Flame Body lets Volcarona punish physical attackers that manage to take it down using contact moves, potentially crippling a foe trying to hit its weaker Defense stat. However, this frailty makes it difficult for Volcarona to find setup opportunities against physical attackers, and weaknesses to common types such as Rock, Flying, and Water limit the number of Pokemon that Volcarona can set up on and allow it to be more easily revenge killed. Furthermore, Volcarona's Bug / Fire typing leaves it walled by many top threats such as Mega Salamence, Talonflame, Blaziken, Heatran, and Azumarill, forcing it to pick what it can and can't beat with its coverage moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swarm pairs well with Focus Sash to boost Bug Buzz's power after taking an otherwise lethal hit, which provides a more powerful and accurate alternative to Fire Blast when in Swarm range. Notably, a +1 Swarm-boosted Bug Buzz will almost always OHKO standard Mega Kangaskhan, while Sucker Punch from Adamant Mega Kangaskhan will usually put Volcarona into Swarm range. Hidden Power Rock hits Talonflame on the switch and prevents Mega Charizard Y from walling Volcarona, though it has no real advantages otherwise and requires Focus Sash to beat Talonflame reliably. Psychic can be used to hit Blaziken, though it needs boosts to reliably OHKO Mega Blaziken and doesn't hit much beyond that. Substitute can punish switch-ins and create extra turns for Volcarona to set up, though this means Volcarona is easier to wall because it gives up coverage.</p> <p>Volcarona can run a Choice Scarf set with Fiery Dance, which allows it to function as a dedicated revenge killer and late-game cleaner thanks to Volcarona's high Special Attack and solid base 100 Speed for a Choice Scarf user. Fiery Dance can also be used on a Quiver Dance set for the chance to accumulate boosts while sweeping, though the fact that it has lower power than Flamethrower can be problematic. Overheat can be used as a last-resort attack alongside Fire Blast or Flamethrower and fits well on a Choice Scarf set, securing OHKOs on Mega Gengar, Thundurus, and Aegislash. Life Orb can give Volcarona a noticeable power boost if you're running a Timid nature or if Lum Berry's buffer against status isn't desired, though Volcarona hits very hard without the boost anyway. Roost is also an option on a Life Orb set and provides longevity; it also opens up the possibility of a bulky physically defensive Volcarona with a Bold nature, though as a sweeper with common weaknesses, it isn't easy to find opportunities to make use of a bulky Volcarona.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physical Attackers: Volcarona is physically frail, so strong physical attacks from the likes of Garchomp, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Salamence will easily KO it. However, Flame Body risks crippling many physical attackers, so even if Volcarona faints, the burn can be more detrimental for the foe than Volcarona itself going down.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves: Volcarona's poor physical bulk makes it susceptible to being revenge killed by priority moves from physical attackers such as Talonflame, Mega Mawile, Mega Kangaskhan, Dragonite, and Azumarill. Talonflame in particular resists both of Volcarona's STAB moves and can easily OHKO it with Gale Wings Brave Bird while being immune to burns due to its typing. Most other priority users must be aware of the risk of Flame Body, and others like Mega Mawile also risk being KOed in return if Volcarona is healthy.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Moves: Many Pokemon carry Rock-type coverage for Talonflame, so otherwise non-threatening Pokemon such as Breloom and Heracross are risky for Volcarona to switch into. Landorus-T, Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Hippowdon all usually carry Rock-type moves as well, so they can threaten Volcarona and prevent it from setting up. Stealth Rock is another huge issue, since Volcarona loses half of its HP when switching into it, making it far more difficult for Volcarona to set up. Common Rock-type moves also don't make contact, so foes don't even fear Flame Body burns punishing them.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Volcarona's STAB combination is resisted by Fire-types, which can't be burned by Flame Body either, and none of its common coverage moves help against them except in specific cases. Blaziken, Heatran, Entei, Mega Charizard Y, and Rotom-H all wall Volcarona and threaten it due to Volcarona lacking a Fire resistance itself. However, Blaziken and Heatran must be wary of the occasional Psychic or Hidden Power Ground, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types such as Gyarados and Suicune don't mind Fire Blast while also threatening to KO Volcarona with their respective Water-type moves; the former resists Bug Buzz as well, though it must be wary of getting burned by Flame Body. Other Water-types such as Rotom-W and Greninja also threaten Volcarona, though if Volcarona manages to get enough boosts, then it doesn't mind them as much and can threaten them with Bug Buzz or Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Volcarona can't touch most Dragon-types if it lacks Hidden Power Ice, so Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Mega Charizard X can comfortably set up on or outright KO it due to its low Defense. Mega Charizard X in particular resists all of Volcarona's moves aside from Hidden Power Ground, and it can avoid Mega Evolving to maintain an immunity to Ground while also being immune to burns from Flame Body.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Volcarona struggles against Chansey due to its monstrous Special Defense. Even with a Lum Berry, Chansey can continue to use Toxic against Volcarona and stall it out with Soft-Boiled. However, using Seismic Toss can result in Chansey being burned, which can wear it down enough for a partner to finish it off, so being too careless against Volcarona can put Chansey in a tough spot.</p>",

        "name": "Special Sweeper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Quiver Dance lets Volcarona function as an effective setup sweeper thanks to its solid base 100 Speed and naturally high Special Attack. Fire Blast is Volcarona's strongest STAB move and has great neutral coverage, which is important to guarantee the OHKO against threats such as Landorus-T and Thundurus after a boost. Flamethrower gives up some of Fire Blast's power for accuracy, notably missing out on the guaranteed OHKO against Landorus-T after a Quiver Dance boost. Bug Buzz is Volcarona's secondary STAB move and lets it hit the Dragon-, Water-, and Rock-types that resist Fire-type moves. Notably, this is Volcarona's best move for hitting Cresselia, Hydreigon, and Tyranitar. Giga Drain is an alternative if Bug-type coverage isn't necessary, hitting Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune harder than Bug Buzz while preventing Azumarill from walling Volcarona and getting a free Belly Drum against it. The recovery it offers is also useful for keeping Volcarona healthy while it sweeps. However, running both Bug Buzz and Giga Drain is viable as well. Hidden Power Ice is preferred in the last slot to hit Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Landorus-T, which notably allows Volcarona to more comfortably opt for Flamethrower, since it no longer needs Fire Blast to OHKO the last. Hidden Power Ground is an alternative that hits Fire-types that would otherwise wall Volcarona, such as Heatran, Blaziken, and Entei, though Volcarona needs multiple boosts in order to OHKO the latter two.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment maximizes Volcarona's damage output while ensuring that it's as fast as possible, outspeeding Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T after one Quiver Dance boost. While it doesn't come into play often, the leftover EVs are placed in HP to give Volcarona an odd HP number, which allows it to switch into Stealth Rock twice. If you run Hidden Power Ground, 4 Special Attack EVs should be moved to Defense so that no EVs are wasted. A Modest nature is preferred to boost Volcarona's power further, since Quiver Dance boosts are enough to let it afford the Speed drop and the Speed boost from Timid isn't as useful. This also lets Volcarona OHKO Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence with Hidden Power Ice on the switch without needing to boost. Modest is also preferred if you're running Flamethrower over Fire Blast. Timid is typically inferior to Modest but lets Volcarona Speed tie with Mega Kangaskhan before boosting as well as outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Excadrill and the occasional Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T after boosts.</p> <p>Lum Berry is the preferred item to prevent Toxic and Thunder Wave users such as Cresselia and Thundurus from cutting Volcarona's sweep short; this also lets it function as an effective Klefki check. Focus Sash is an alternative that gives Volcarona a chance to set up against otherwise unsafe foes such as Hydreigon and offensive Zapdos if there's no risk of a priority user finishing it off later, and it also functions as a safety net against threats such as Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Jolly Choice Scarf Garchomp. Flame Body allows Volcarona to punish physical attackers that make contact with it, potentially crippling a dangerous threat such as Mega Kangaskhan or Mega Salamence as it goes down, which can give its teammates an easier time cleaning afterwards.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Volcarona's goal is to sweep, so it'll usually be brought in after a teammate has been KOed or switched into something that can't hurt it much, such as Ferrothorn or Cresselia. If Volcarona tries to set up early, be sure that it has partners such as Choice Scarf Garchomp that can clean up in case Volcarona can't finish the job. Likewise, avoid setting up early if Volcarona is needed to beat a specific threat such as Cresselia, since it's typically used for the unique coverage that its Bug / Fire typing offers. Lum Berry makes it easier for Volcarona to set up against Pokemon that can only threaten it with status, so don't hesitate to set up against foes that can't do much immediate damage such as Porygon2 and Serperior.</p> <p>Volcarona has very troubling matchups depending on its coverage move, but generally it should avoid setting up if the opponent has a Fire-type, since it can't hit most of them without Hidden Power Ground. Fire Blast is the move Volcarona should be using most of the time due to its huge power even without boosts; if you're running Flamethrower instead, this is still the preferred STAB move due to the superior coverage over its other moves. Bug Buzz should generally only be used against weakened foes and Pokemon that are weak to Bug or resist Fire such as Hydreigon, Suicune, and Tyranitar. Otherwise, it shouldn't be used unless missing Fire Blast is a big risk; even if Bug Buzz doesn't KO, the guaranteed damage can be more important, especially if a partner can pick off the foe afterwards.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Salamence creates an aggressive setup sweeper pair with Volcarona that boasts great defensive synergy, beating most Fire-types and Belly Drum Azumarill for Volcarona while appreciating Volcarona's ability to switch into Ice Beam and Fairy-types. Intimidate from Salamence before it Mega Evolves also helps Volcarona against physical attackers. Mega Kangaskhan appreciates Volcarona's ability to beat Steel-types such as Mega Mawile and Ferrothorn as well as Cresselia and the occasional Mega Sableye, while Mega Kangaskhan breaks down walls to let Volcarona sweep more easily. Volcarona also appreciates partners that can remove special walls like Chansey, so Mega Gengar makes for an effective partner by trapping and beating these walls. Cresselia can switch into most physical attackers that threaten Volcarona, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Blaziken, while notably dealing with Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence if Volcarona lacks Hidden Power Ice. Cresselia also has Lunar Dance, which can give Volcarona a second chance to sweep.</p> <p>Stealth Rock gives Volcarona an easier time sweeping, giving it a greater chance to OHKO threats such as Aegislash in Shield forme before boosts, as well as Mega Kangaskhan, Zapdos, and bulkier Thundurus at +1. Stealth Rock also cripples Talonflame, which completely stops Volcarona. Garchomp, Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Mamoswine are all effective partners that can offer this support while being able to check Talonflame and other Fire-types to varying degrees. Hippowdon in particular can put foes to sleep or force them out with Yawn, which can help Volcarona set up. Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Serperior, and Breloom deal with Water-types that give Volcarona trouble if it lacks Giga Drain. Ferrothorn in particular offers Stealth Rock support and a sturdy Rock-type switch-in for Volcarona. However, all of these are threatened by Fire-types, which Volcarona struggles against as well. Water-types such as Rotom-W, Greninja, Azumarill, Suicune, Cloyster, and Gyarados can take on the Fire- and Rock-types that threaten Volcarona. Volcarona can deal with any Grass-type for them, and Rotom-W in particular serves as an effective Talonflame check. Cloyster also pairs well as a setup sweeper alongside Volcarona, overwhelming slower teams. Electric-types such as Thundurus, Raikou, and Rocky Helmet Zapdos are also capable of checking Flying-types such as Talonflame and Mega Salamence for Volcarona.</p>"

  "Thundurus": {
    "overview": "<p>Thundurus is one of the most consistent Pokemon in the Battle Spot Singles format, providing utility and a good offensive presence. Thundurus is extremely versatile and can run many sets; whether as a fast attacker with its great coverage, as a bulky supporter with moves such as Taunt and Thunder Wave, or even as a sweeper with access to Nasty Plot, it has many tools to deal with a lot of top threats and easily fits on most teams. Prankster is a great ability that Thundurus utilizes very well. Prankster Thunder Wave is its best tool and is useful for crippling fast threats, sweepers, and Pokemon that try to revenge kill it, such as Mega Salamence, Blaziken, and Greninja. Thundurus has great offensive stats alongside good Speed, outspeeding key Pokemon like Mega Kangaskhan, Garchomp, and base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Gengar and Latios. Its Electric- and Ice-type coverage handles a wide range of the metagame and is hard to switch into, and it is complemented by good coverage moves such as Focus Blast and Grass Knot. Additionally, while Thundurus has mediocre bulk, its typing gives it useful resistances to popular types such as Flying and Fighting, as well as an immunity to Ground, making it a good switch-in to Pokemon such as Talonflame, Mega Salamence, and Landorus-T. However, Thundurus is weak to Ice and Rock, two very common types. Ice- and Rock-type attacks are commonly packed on almost every team; Porygon2 and Cresselia often carry Ice Beam and can deal with Thundurus well, and Garchomp and Landorus-T often carry Rock Tomb, which not only hits Thundurus super effectively but also lowers its Speed. The Rock weakness is especially crippling if the opponent has Stealth Rock, as the chip damage makes Thundurus much easier to wear down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thundurus's offensive sets have below average defenses, so a Focus Sash can allow it to survive attacks that would normally OHKO it, such as Greninja's Ice Beam and Dragonite's Outrage. However, Thundurus can usually take at least one hit from most Pokemon, and Stealth Rock isn't a rare sight, so Focus Sash isn't useful in every battle. Knock Off provides good utility, crippling Porygon2 and Pokemon with Sitrus Berry such as Rotom formes and opposing Thundurus. Psychic hits Mega Venusaur, which walls Thundurus completely otherwise. Rocky Helmet can be used on the tank set to hurt Talonflame and Mega Salamence even further, as well as somewhat punishing Mega Kangaskhan. A Calm nature can be used on the tank set if you want Thundurus to take on more special attackers, particularly Water-types that Thundurus can threaten. Superpower is a good coverage option over Focus Blast, as Thundurus has a solid base 115 Attack and can use Superpower to pick off weakened Chansey at around 45%. Don't reveal Superpower unless you need to; if the opponent knows Thundurus has it, they can easily play around it. Incinerate can be used as a more accurate option over Focus Blast to hit Ferrothorn and Scizor and to burn Berries. U-turn is weaker than Volt Switch, but it's still a good option for momentum, as nothing is immune to it. Jaboca Berry helps deal with Focus Sash Breloom and Mamoswine, acting like a one-use Rocky Helmet that doesn't require contact.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Mega Manectric and Raikou outspeed Thundurus, are immune to Thunder Wave, are capable of tanking most of Thundurus's attacks, and can deal good neutral damage back. Rotom-W can take a hit or two from Thundurus and, with Choice Specs, OHKO frail sets or 2HKO bulkier ones with Hydro Pump. Rotom-H resists both Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice, is bulky enough to take on Thundurus's other coverage options, and hits it hard with its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Special Tanks: Pokemon with high Special Defense, such as Chansey, Cresselia, and Porygon2, can take hits and recover off the damage while firing back with Ice Beam, Seismic Toss, or even Toxic. However, Taunt helps against these Pokemon and the SwagPlay set has a good matchup against them as well.</p> <p><strong>Mamoswine: Mamoswine is immune to Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave and resists Hidden Power Ice thanks to Thick Fat. It can hit Thundurus super effectively with STAB Ice-type attacks and set up Stealth Rock to cripple Thundurus as it switches in.</p> <p><strong>Fast Revenge Killers</strong>: Thundurus has mediocre bulk and gets KOed by many fast Pokemon such as Greninja, Blaziken, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Choice Scarf Garchomp. Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Garchomp can revenge kill Thundurus without fear of Thunder Wave, but most others face the risk of getting paralyzed, which is very crippling for fast Pokemon such as Greninja and Blaziken.</p> <p><strong>Slow Heavy Hitters: Strong Pokemon that are bulky enough to take hits from Thundurus, such as Aegislash, Sylveon, and Conkeldurr, can be threatening. These Pokemon are already slow, so they don't fear Thunder Wave as much as other Pokemon do, and Conkeldurr will actually get a Guts boost from it.</p> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan: Mega Kangaskhan can take out any variant of Thundurus, bar bulky Sitrus Berry, with Fake Out + Double Edge, and is bulky enough to take a hit from most Thundurus. Mega Kangaskhan is usually willing to take a Thunder Wave if it needs to, especially if it's paired with Lunar Dance Cresselia.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Choice Band Dragonite's Outrage OHKOes all Thundurus variants, Lum Berry sets can take one paralysis for free, and Weakness Policy sets receive an Attack boost from Hidden Power Ice and can proceed to spam Extreme Speed. Dragonite's Multiscale makes it very reliable against Thundurus, and it's tough to play around if its item hasn't been revealed.</p> <p><strong>Breloom</strong>: Breloom can check or revenge kill Thundurus, as it survives at least one attack with Focus Sash and can lower its Speed or 2HKO it with Rock Tomb. Breloom can also put non-Taunt Thundurus to sleep or use Spore on a predicted switch after a Rock Tomb.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Prankster Thunder Wave can neutralize a fast threat such as Greninja or Blaziken and stops opposing Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Mega Salamence and Dragonite from sweeping your team. Thunderbolt is usually Thundurus's most reliable move and hits a lot of Pokemon at least neutrally. Hidden Power Ice hits Ground-types immune to Thunderbolt super effectively and hits some common Pokemon for 4x damage, such as Mega Salamence, Garchomp, and Landorus-T. The fourth moveslot has a handful of viable options. Grass Knot hits Hippowdon and Mamoswine really hard. Focus Blast deals with some bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Heatran. Volt Switch can be used to gain some momentum. Taunt gets priority from Prankster, shuts down some defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Clefable, and stops Aegislash from using King's Shield, making it more vulnerable in Blade forme.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread is used to hit as hard and as fast as possible. Thundurus needs maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature to outspeed key threats such as Garchomp and the crowded base 110 Speed tier, which includes Pokemon such as Gengar and Latios. Prankster is the only ability available to Thundurus in Battle Spot, but it makes very good use of it. Life Orb is used to increase Thundurus's damage output and guarantee an OHKO on Garchomp and Mega Salamence with Hidden Power Ice.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Thundurus set plays very simply: use Thundurus to paralyze Pokemon that could be threatening to your team, such as Speed Boost Blaziken and Dragon Dance Mega Salamence. Thunder Wave slows them down, making them vulnerable to the rest of your team when they would have swept otherwise. Thundurus might often have to sacrifice itself to get off a Thunder Wave against a sweeper, but it's for the good of the battle. Thundurus can be a good revenge killer thanks to its good Speed and Special Attack, and it can threaten common Pokemon like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Talonflame.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon with an average Speed tier appreciate the speed control from Thunder Wave, such as Mamoswine, Dragonite, and Mega Kangaskhan. Defensive Pokemon can take advantage of the Thunder Wave support by potentially getting free turns to heal against a paralyzed foe. Blaziken works well with Thundurus, as Thundurus can deal with Talonflame and Water-types that Blaziken struggles with. Pokemon that are weak to Ground-type attacks, such as Heatran and Aegislash, appreciate Thundurus's immunity to them. Suicune provides good synergy defensively and can switch into Ice-type attacks for Thundurus. Landorus-T can form a nice VoltTurn core with Thundurus and appreciates Thundurus's ability to deal with Suicune and slow down Pokemon for it if it isn't running Choice Scarf.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunder Wave is a great form of speed control, especially with Prankster, and can deal with threatening sweepers. Thunderbolt is Thundurus's best STAB move and can hit bulky Water-types and Flying-types really hard. Hidden Power Ice rounds out the coverage well and can hit Ground-types super effectively. Taunt can shut down a lot of defensive Pokemon, such as Hippowdon and Ferrothorn, by limiting their utility and recovery. Swagger can help out when you're in a really sticky situation, and with Prankster it's very useful to fall back on. Volt Switch can help your team gain momentum, as Thundurus often scares Pokemon out.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This set runs a very bulky EV spread so Thundurus can take hits a lot better and function as a better check defensively. 244 HP and 168 Defense EVs along with a Bold nature and a Sitrus Berry allow Thundurus to survive two Double-Edges from a maximum Attack Mega Salamence or three Brave Birds from Choice Band Talonflame. 28 Speed EVs are enough to outspeed maximum Speed base 70s, such as Breloom, and the rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Attack. The extra bulk makes Thundurus a better switch-in to various threats, especially Flying-types. A Bold nature is used to ensure Thundurus can withstand hits from Mega Salamence and other strong Pokemon. Prankster can make up for the lack of Speed on this set and is especially useful for Thunder Wave.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set takes advantage of Thundurus's great ability and defensive typing. Its primary goal is to paralyze everything that needs to be slowed down with Thunder Wave. With the extra bulk, Thundurus can afford to spend a turn using Thunder Wave and then taking a hit, and it can afford to switch into more attacks and function as a better check to Flying-types such as Mega Salamence and Talonflame.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon with an average Speed tier, such as Mamoswine, Dragonite, and Kangaskhan, appreciate the speed control from Thunder Wave. Pokemon that use Substitute, such as Gliscor and Glalie, like the Thunder Wave support so they can use Substitute in front of more Pokemon. Blaziken appreciates Thundurus's ability to deal with Talonflame and Mega Salamence; Mega Salamence can normally set up on Blaziken, but Thundurus can come in to check it. Serperior can deal with teams much more easily when Thundurus helps deal with opposing Talonflame and Mega Salamence. Steel-types, such as Aegislash, synergize well with Thundurus defensively and can switch into Ice- and Rock-type attacks aimed at Thundurus.</p>"

        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Nasty Plot makes Thundurus a great wallbreaker, as not many Pokemon can reliably take hits from Thundurus at +2 Special Attack. Thunderbolt is a good STAB move, and Hidden Power Ice hits Ground-types that are immune to it. The fourth moveslot has many viable options. Thunder Wave can be used to give Thundurus some utility outside of being just a sweeper, and Substitute can be used to dodge status that would wear it down and to avoid Sucker Punch. Additionally, if Thundurus can get up a Substitute in front of a foe that can't break it, it can avoid being revenge killed by another Pokemon afterwards. Focus Blast hits Steel-types, such as Heatran and Ferrothorn, which could otherwise take a few hits, and Grass Knot can be used to pick up OHKOs on Mamoswine, Hippowdon, and Swampert after a Nasty Plot boost.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread is used to hit as hard and as fast as possible. Thundurus needs maximum Speed with a Timid nature to outspeed key threats such as Garchomp and the crowded base 110 Speed tier, which includes Pokemon such as Gengar and Latios. Prankster is Thundurus's only ability available, but it is very useful for getting off a Thunder Wave on a sweeper or using Substitute against faster Will-O-Wisp users, such as Talonflame and Mega Gengar. Sitrus Berry gives Thundurus a bit of recovery and helps avoid some 2HKOs, such as from defensive Rotom-W's Hydro Pump. Life Orb gives Thundurus a much greater damage output. Leftovers can be used with Substitute to give some recovery to make up for the lost HP. When using Substitute and Leftovers, an EV spread of 52 HP / 204 SpA / 252 Spe should be used so Thundurus can regain more HP from Leftovers and make more Substitutes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Thundurus scares out a lot of Pokemon, such as Suicune, Talonflame, and Blaziken, so it can find many free turns to set up a Nasty Plot or Substitute. You should not set up if the opponent has a Pokemon that can easily stop Thundurus, such as Mamoswine; it's best to set up when a team is already weakened and Pokemon are in range of Thundurus's attacks or when you want Thundurus to weaken the opposing team for another Pokemon in the back to clean up, such as Mega Blaziken or Mega Lucario. Thundurus can still utilize Thunder Wave as well when you need to stop a Pokemon from sweeping your team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Thundurus needs teammates that can deal with Pokemon that usually wall it, such as Mamoswine, Ferrothorn, and Porygon2. Suicune can easily counter Mamoswine, while Fighting-types, such as Blaziken and Mega Lucario, can deal with Ferrothorn and Porygon2. Mega Gengar can trap and take out walls such as Chansey and Cresselia. Stealth Rock support is nice to get some chip damage and break Focus Sashes so Thundurus has an easier time sweeping. Garchomp and Mamoswine are some reliable Stealth Rock setters. Mamoswine also covers Thundurus's Ice weakness and helps deal with Breloom and Dragonite, which Thundurus sometimes struggles with.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swagger is a great move to attempt to shut a Pokemon down, and it works especially well with Prankster. Thunder Wave provides great utility in general and works wonders in combination with Swagger, as it has a good chance to provide free turns factoring in confusion and paralysis chance. Substitute is used to take advantage of the possible free turns you'll get and can be used to protect Thundurus just in case the foe breaks through and attacks. Foul Play takes advantage of the Attack boosts from Swagger and does a lot of damage to specially defensive Pokemon Thundurus might not have been able to break through otherwise, such as Cresselia and Chansey. Thunderbolt can be used as well to deal with Pokemon such as Suicune and Talonflame reliably. Taunt is good for stopping status and recovery moves from Pokemon such as Chansey and Cresselia, but it leaves Thundurus with no reliable attack and vulnerable to opposing Taunt.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Calm nature is used because you want Thundurus to primarily check special attackers, which don't benefit from the Attack boost that Swagger gives them. 180 HP EVs are used to maximize Leftovers recovery and allow Thundurus to set up more Substitutes throughout the match. Maximum Special Defense investment is used to take on special attackers that you want Thundurus to deal with. 28 Speed EVs ensure Thundurus outspeeds base 70 Speed Pokemon, such as Breloom. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense for some extra physical bulk and allow Thundurus to survive a +1 Double-Edge from Mega Salamence at full health. Because of level 50 EV mechanics, the leftover 4 EVs are put into Special Attack.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bring Thundurus in on special attackers and defensive Pokemon such as Suicune, Aegislash, Cresselia, Porygon2, and Chansey. Swagger should be the first move used, as it has a 50% chance to cost the opponent a turn due to confusion, while Thunder Wave has only a 25% chance to get a full paralysis, unless you really need to slow down a sweeper such as Blaziken or Mega Salamence. Try to get free turns with a Substitute up; if you threaten the foe and predict a switch, it's best to use Substitute so you're safe to status their switch-in before retreating.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that don't like facing common special attackers and defensive Pokemon work well with Thundurus, as it can deal with them. Many special attackers, such as Suicune and Serperior, appreciate having Chansey dealt with, and Mega Kangaskhan appreciates having Cresselia and Porygon2 gone or weakened. Clefable can work well with this Thundurus because of its ability Unaware; if Thundurus does use Swagger on a physical attacker, Clefable can come in and ignore the boosts to make sure it doesn't become too threatening. Clefable also appreciates the Thunder Wave support because it functions much better when it can get off Minimize and Calm Mind against slower Pokemon. Ditto can also work well to take advantage of the Swagger boosts, as it can copy a boosted physical attacker without the confusion that comes with it.</p>"

  "Thundurus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Thundurus-T is a unique special attacker in Battle Spot Singles, capable of functioning as a more powerful wallbreaker and sweeper than its more common Incarnate Forme. However, this comes with a significant Speed drop that leaves it outsped by the likes of Garchomp, Latios, and Gengar, as well as losing the valuable utility of Prankster that makes Thundurus a huge threat. On the other hand, access to Volt Absorb instead allows it to function as one of the best Thundurus counters in the format, which is generally the primary reason to use Thundurus-T over Thundurus. Its Electric / Flying typing also grants it useful resistances to Fighting- and Flying-type moves as well as a Ground-type immunity, with only two weaknesses in Ice- and Rock-type moves. However, Thundurus-T's bulk isn't great, so it needs significant defensive investment in order to actually switch into stronger threats such as Mega Salamence and Choice Band Talonflame. Thundurus-T also has access to a wide range of coverage moves such as Psychic, Focus Blast, Hidden Power Ice, and Grass Knot, which allow it to check various threats in the format such as Mega Venusaur, Tyranitar, Dragonite, Ferrothorn, and Hydreigon. Access to Nasty Plot and Agility also allows Thundurus-T to capitalize on its wallbreaking capabilities and mitigate its drop in Speed to either break through bulkier teams or sweep against offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Agility with Weakness Policy can be used to boost Thundurus-T's Special Attack and Speed without needing to run Nasty Plot; however, Thundurus-T is not bulky enough to make this a consistent option. Agility can also be used together with Nasty Plot for a double dance sweeper, though this comes at the cost of a valuable coverage slot, and it often won't be able to use both moves in one game. Hidden Power Flying can be used on the Nasty Plot set to give Thundurus-T a secondary STAB attack to hit Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, though this is only legal with an even number of Speed IVs, which is typically undesirable because this causes it to Speed tie with base 100 Pokemon. However, this isn't a major issue on a bulkier Thundurus-T that doesn't mind having less Speed. Dark Pulse can be used on the Choice Specs set in order to hit Aegislash and Cresselia harder, but it's typically inferior to the other coverage moves. Similarly, Sludge Wave can be used to hit Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir harder on teams that have trouble switching into Fairy-type moves. Thundurus-T is often used on rain teams as a check to Thundurus, so Thunder is a viable option over Thunderbolt on these teams for more power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls such as Blissey, Chansey, and Mega Venusaur can tank most attacks that Thundurus-T runs. Blissey and Chansey can usually cripple Thundurus-T with Toxic and stall it out with Soft-Boiled, while Mega Venusaur can gradually take it down with Sludge Bomb and heal off damage with Synthesis or Leech Seed. Porygon2 can also wall Thundurus-T thanks to Trace and beat it with Ice Beam. However, they still need to watch out for Focus Blast and Psychic, especially from Nasty Plot variants.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Attackers: Common Assault Vest users such as Conkeldurr and Mamoswine can take a hit from Thundurus-T and retaliate with Ice Punch or Icicle Spear. Calm Mind Raikou can also be difficult for Thundurus-T to break through, since it doesn't take too much damage from any of Thundurus-T's attacks aside from Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type moves: Mamoswine, especially Assault Vest and Focus Sash variants, can survive Thundurus-T's Focus Blast and can retaliate with a STAB Icicle Spear and Ice Shard. Weavile also outspeeds Thundurus-T if it lacks a Choice Scarf and can OHKO with Icicle Crash, while Greninja can give Thundurus-T some trouble.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers: Thundurus-T isn't particularly bulky, so strong attackers that can outspeed Thundurus-T such as Garchomp, Mega Blaziken, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Sand Rush Excadrill can handle it. Rock-type coverage is common on many physical attackers as well, so physical attackers such as Mega Heracross that can typically take a hit from Thundurus-T can take it down with Rock Blast.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Gardevoir can switch in safely thanks to Trace, which greatly disrupts Choice variants using Electric-type moves, and threaten to OHKO more offensive variants with Hyper Voice. Sylveon can also tank a hit from Thundurus-T and OHKO with Hyper Voice, though it should avoid switching into Choice Specs Thundurus-T.</p>",

        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Nasty Plot allows Thundurus-T to function as a dedicated wallbreaker, allowing it to break through nearly any wall after a boost. Thunderbolt is Thundurus-T's primary STAB move, offering consistent power and great coverage. Hidden Power Ice hits Dragon-types such as Dragonite, Garchomp, and Mega Salamence as well as Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Hippowdon. Focus Blast is the ideal coverage move, since it allows Thundurus-T to hit Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, Mamoswine, and Hydreigon harder, as well as break through Porygon2 and Chansey after a Nasty Plot. Psychic is an option if Focus Blast's coverage is not needed, allowing Thundurus-T to hit Mega Venusaur and Mega Heracross harder. Grass Knot can also be used to hit bulky Ground-types that don't mind Hidden Power Ice, such as Swampert and Gastrodon, and also hits Tyranitar and Hippowdon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Thundurus-T to hit as hard and fast as possible, while the leftover EVs are placed in Special Defense. A Timid nature is preferred because the power boost from Modest is unnecessary with Nasty Plot, and the Speed allows Thundurus-T to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Kangaskhan, and Volcarona. Sitrus Berry is the preferred item to allow Thundurus-T to heal some of the damage it might take while setting up, and prevents it from being 2HKOed by Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird. It also allows Thundurus-T to avoid a 2HKO from Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and Cresselia's Ice Beam, which makes it easier to set up on them. Life Orb can be used as an alternative that makes Thundurus-T less reliant on setting up, notably allowing it to OHKO Mega Kangaskhan and Ferrothorn with Focus Blast, though this makes it tougher to check Talonflame since this wears Thundurus-T down quickly. Volt Absorb is Thundurus-T's only ability available, but it's very useful for switching into any predicted Electric-type moves such as Thunder Wave, Volt Switch, and Thunderbolt.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set's primary role is to break down sturdy walls and sweep after a Nasty Plot, so it's best used against slower, bulkier teams. However, Thundurus-T can function either as a sweeper or as a wallbreaker due to its naturally high Special Attack, so it doesn't always need to focus on finding the opportunity to set up. Volt Absorb makes Thundurus-T one of the best offensive checks to opposing Thundurus, so it should take advantage of the fact that its presence alone deters Thundurus from carelessly using Thunder Wave. This gives Thundurus-T a stronger presence at Team Preview, since the threat of Volt Absorb alone can deter the opponent from bringing their Electric-types. For this reason, you don't always need to bring Thundurus-T into battle. Thundurus-T can also be used to check Flying-types such as Mega Salamence and Talonflame, though it should not be used as your primary check, since it's not very bulky and can still be easily worn down even with its Sitrus Berry.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that struggle with Thundurus make great partners. Blaziken, Suicune, Azumarill, Greninja, and Garchomp are all powerful teammates that appreciate having a teammate that can deal with Thundurus. Blaziken in particular deals with Rock-types and Ice-types for Thundurus-T while appreciating its ability to deal with Talonflame. Water-types such as Suicune and Azumarill can also handle Ice-type moves that give trouble Thundurus-T. Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Swampert can cover its Rock-type weakness and also provide Stealth Rock support to aid its sweeping attempts. Landorus-T in particular provides Intimidate support that helps Thundurus-T take physical attacks better. Mega Mawile can provide similar support and also appreciates Thundurus-T's ability to switch into Ground-type moves. Grass-types such as Serperior and Breloom, as well as Fighting-types such as Heracross and Conkeldurr also appreciate Thundurus-T's ability to check common Flying-types such as Talonflame and Mega Salamence.</p>"

      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is Thundurus-T's primary STAB move, providing great coverage and consistent power. Hidden Power Ice hits Dragon- and Ground-types such as Garchomp, Dragonite, Mega Salamence, and Landorus-T, complementing Thunderbolt's coverage well. Focus Blast rounds out Thundurus-T's coverage, hitting foes that don't mind Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Ice such as Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, Hydreigon, and Porygon2. Psychic can be used instead to hit Mega Venusaur and to beat Mega Blaziken at +1 Speed. Alternatively, Grass Knot can be used to give Thundurus-T coverage against Rock- and Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Tyranitar. Volt Switch is the preferred choice in the last slot, since it allows Thundurus-T to pivot out of bad matchups while maintaining momentum. Thundurus-T can give up Thunderbolt or Volt Switch to run another coverage move, though Thunderbolt's power and Volt Switch's utility are usually more important than the coverage that Psychic or Grass Knot provides.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf patches up Thundurus-T's middling Speed and allows it to function as a strong revenge killer due to its great Special Attack. Volt Absorb allows Thundurus-T to heal from Electric-type moves, which is its biggest draw for the ability to counter Thundurus. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment is ideal to allow Thundurus-T to hit as hard and fast as possible. A Modest nature is preferred over Timid to maximize Thundurus-T's damage output, and Timid doesn't help outspeed anything notable. If checking Talonflame is particularly important, a bulkier spread of 200 Def / 200 SpA / 108 Spe can be used to avoid being 2HKOed by Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird while still outspeeding Adamant Dragonite after a Dragon Dance and the occasional Choice Scarf Breloom.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Thundurus-T still has great Special Attack even without a boosting item, so it can still break through foes that aren't dedicated walls. However, this Thundurus-T set is used primarily as a revenge killer or late-game cleaner, so it should be ideally brought in after a teammate has been KOed. Leading with Thundurus-T is also a viable approach if the opposing team lacks Ground-types, since it can simply Volt Switch out against an unfavorable matchup. Try to avoid making Thundurus-T's item too obvious, since bluffing another set can allow you to surprise a foe later in the game. This is particularly important if Thundurus-T is being used to revenge kill foes such as Mega Salamence and Garchomp, since it becomes much easier for the opponent to play around Thundurus-T if they know it's locked into a move. Locking into a coverage move can be particularly dangerous because it can give powerful sweepers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard X an easy setup opportunity.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Thundurus-T appreciates Stealth Rock support in order to effectively clean late-game, so teammates such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Ferrothorn, and Hippowdon are great for their ability to provide this support and weaken teams through other means of residual damage. These all can handle Rock-type moves that trouble Thundurus-T. Thundurus-T also appreciates teammates that can handle Ice-type moves, such as Blaziken, Volcarona, Suicune, and Slowbro. In return, Thundurus-T handles Electric-types such as Thundurus, which gives them a difficult time. In the case of Blaziken and Volcarona, Thundurus-T can also handle Talonflame and Mega Salamence, though it must be careful switching into them, since it isn't very bulky. Mega Lucario and Mega Mawile tend to struggle with bulky Water-types, so they appreciate Thundurus-T's ability to come in and revenge kill them. Thundurus-T can also punish Ground-type moves that are aimed at them, though this must be done carefully, since Thundurus-T isn't particularly bulky itself. Even though Thundurus-T has great Special Attack on its own, wallbreakers such as Mega Gengar and Mega Heracross can break through troublesome walls that Thundurus-T has trouble beating by itself, such as Chansey and Mega Venusaur.</p>"

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is Thundurus-T's primary STAB move for wallbreaking, boasting great coverage and consistent power. Hidden Power Ice complements Thunderbolt's coverage, allowing Thundurus-T to hit Ground- and Dragon-types such as Landorus-T, Hippowdon, Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Dragonite. Focus Blast is the preferred coverage move in order to hit Dark-, Steel-, and Normal-types such as Tyranitar, Hydreigon, Ferrothorn, and Porygon2, which have few issues beating Thundurus-T otherwise. However, Psychic can be used to hit Mega Venusaur and more consistently OHKO bulky Mega Gengar. Grass Knot is another alternative that gives Thundurus-T coverage against Rock- and Ground-types, such as Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Swampert, though locking into it can be very risky due to its variable power. Volt Switch is also used in order to allow Thundurus-T to pivot out of bad matchups while still maintaining momentum.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack helps Thundurus-T take full advantage of Choice Specs by hitting as hard and fast as possible. Choice Specs turns Thundurus-T into a powerful wallbreaker capable of breaking through most threats in the format. A Timid nature is preferred to allow Thundurus-T to outspeed the many important Pokemon in the crowded base 100 Speed range, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Salamence before it Mega Evolves. However, a Modest nature can be used to KO a wider range of threats, such as Rotom-W with Thunderbolt and Mega Heracross with Psychic. Volt Absorb makes Thundurus-T a reliable answer to Electric-types, notably allowing it to switch into Thundurus safely and deter it from using Electric-type moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Thundurus-T aims to break down bulkier foes with its powerful Electric-type moves, so this set works best as a lead. This is particularly effective if the foe lacks Ground-types, since switching into a Choice Specs-boosted Thunderbolt is difficult for anything except the bulkiest special walls, such as Chansey and Mega Venusaur. Thundurus-T should usually use Volt Switch early-game in anticipation of a switch, since Thundurus-T's huge Special Attack still allows it to get a big hit in while maintaining momentum. Thundurus-T is powerful enough to use Hidden Power Ice even against foes that only have a single weakness to Ice such as Hippowdon, though it can be dangerous to lock into. Thundurus-T's great Special Attack can reward a well-predicted switch, so the option to use a coverage move shouldn't be overlooked, but avoid carelessly locking into a coverage moves early-game unless the foe lacks any way to immediately punish it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Speed control helps Thundurus-T out greatly due to its Speed only being slightly above average. Common users of Thunder Wave such as Ferrothorn, Cresselia, and Porygon2 are effective partners, while Serperior can also provide the same support with Glare. Physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Talonflame, Mega Blaziken, and Garchomp appreciate Thundurus-T's ability to blast through physical walls for them, such as Cresselia and Suicune. Stealth Rock support is useful to help Thundurus-T beat foes more easily, so Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Swampert are effective teammates. These Pokemon can also handle Rock-type moves aimed at Thundurus-T and sometimes run Rocky Helmet to wear down physical attackers further. Grass-types and Fighting-types such as Serperior, Breloom, Mega Heracross, and Mega Lopunny all benefit from Thundurus-T's ability to check Flying-types. Breloom and Mega Lopunny also appreciate Thundurus-T's ability to threaten physical walls for them, as they typically have trouble breaking through the likes of Cresselia. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Slowbro enjoy Thundurus-T switching into Grass- and Electric-type moves for them, while they can handle Ice-type moves that threaten Thundurus-T.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is Thundurus-T's most reliable STAB move, providing great coverage and power. Hidden Power Ice complements Thunderbolt's coverage well, hitting Ground- and Dragon-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Dragonite, and Mega Salamence. Volt Switch is necessary on this set, as it allows Thundurus-T to function effectively as a pivot, as it will often be switching into foes and pressuring them with its powerful attacks. Focus Blast is the preferred coverage move, since it allows Thundurus-T to hit Porygon2 and Tyranitar, notably OHKOing most variants of the latter under sand. Psychic is a viable alternative, though, if Mega Venusaur and Mega Heracross are bigger threats to the team. Grass Knot hits Ground-types that don't mind Hidden Power Ice, such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Gastrodon, though it has few other targets. Running three coverage moves is also viable, though this usually comes at the cost of Thunderbolt or Volt Switch, which is often difficult to make room for.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Assault Vest gives Thundurus-T the bulk to take special attacks, such as Hidden Power Ice from opposing Thundurus, Ice Beam from Greninja, and Hydro Pump from Rotom-W. The given HP and Defense EVs allow Thundurus-T to never be 2HKOed by Brave Bird from Adamant Choice Band Talonflame so that it can switch in and revenge kill it if necessary. While this appears less efficient than investing more in Defense, the HP investment is required to allow Thundurus-T to survive Life Orb Greninja's Ice Beam. 108 Speed EVs ensure that Thundurus-T outspeeds up to positive-natured base 70 Pokemon such as Breloom, and the rest is placed in Special Attack so that it can hit foes as hard as possible. A Modest nature is used to boost Thundurus-T's damage output further and is preferred over Timid because this set is designed to tank hits and deal damage rather than wallbreak or sweep. Volt Absorb allows Thundurus-T to check Electric-types such as Zapdos, Rotom-W, and opposing Thundurus. The damage it heals from Electric-type moves also helps Thundurus-T stay healthy.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Assault Vest Thundurus-T is a tank, so it should be used to switch into special attackers and take advantage of its great coverage. At the same time, this Thundurus-T lacks the power of most other sets, so it should not be used as a wallbreaker. Thundurus-T often forces switches due to its great power, so using Volt Switch often is essential to maintain momentum. If the foe lacks Ground-types, using Volt Switch is often very safe. While Thundurus-T can take special hits relatively well, it has no way to heal off the damage it takes, and Volt Absorb can't be relied on at all times, so be careful about letting it take too much damage. However, Electric-types such as Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Thundurus have trouble doing much to Thundurus-T in the first place outside of Toxic or Will-O-Wisp, so don't hesitate to switch into them to try and heal damage whenever possible.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Teammates that struggle with Electric-types such as Thundurus appreciate Thundurus-T's ability to switch into any Electric-type with easy. Suicune, Slowbro, Talonflame, Mega Salamence, and Blaziken all appreciate Thundurus-T's ability to handle Electric-types, especially opposing Thundurus. Teammates that can handle Rock-type moves, such as Garchomp, Ferrothorn, Mega Heracross, and Mega Lucario, are effective options that generally appreciate a teammate that can safely Volt Switch to bring them in. Intimidate support helps Thundurus-T takes physical attacks better, allowing it to more easily switch into a wide range of Pokemon. This makes Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, and Gyarados great options, with Landorus-T in particular forming a strong VoltTurn core with Thundurus-T. However, in the case of the former two, this doubles up on an Ice-type weakness that Thundurus-T itself wants covered. Meanwhile, Gyarados greatly appreciates Thundurus-T's ability to switch into Electric-type moves that threaten it. Thundurus-T also appreciates teammates such as Suicune, Volcarona, Mega Mawile, and Aegislash that can handle Ice-type moves well, and they all generally appreciate having a teammate that can handle Thundurus.</p>"

  "Landorus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Landorus-T provides great utility and power that allow it to serve a variety of roles on a team, such as revenge killing or checking the many powerful physical attackers in the format. Intimidate and a great typing both offensively and defensively make Landorus-T an excellent pivot, which helps it switch into many threats and maintain momentum for its team thanks to U-turn. Coverage moves such as Superpower and Knock Off also allow it to beat major threats such as Mega Kangaskhan and Gengar. Landorus-T can also utilize a defensive support-oriented set as a result of its typing and Intimidate, which is very useful in a format dominated by physical attackers. However, a crippling Ice-type weakness means that checking Landorus-T isn't difficult, and many common threats such as Cresselia, Suicune, Thundurus, Blaziken, and Greninja are known to carry Ice-type moves for it. Landorus-T competes with Garchomp as a wallbreaker and setup sweeper, which is generally a better user of Swords Dance and Choice Band than Landorus-T thanks to its superior Speed and coverage. It also competes with Hippowdon on defensive sets, which has reliable recovery and Yawn to prevent it from being setup bait. Furthermore, Landorus-T's most common and effective set utilizes Choice Scarf, which means it can often be played around, which is particularly dangerous because locking into Earthquake gives a free switch in to many dangerous Flying-types and Levitate Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance can be used with a Focus Sash to let Landorus-T function as a sweeper, though its Speed is lacking for a sweeper and still leaves it vulnerable to being revenge killed. Choice Band allows Landorus-T to function as a powerful wallbreaker thanks to its huge Attack and decent Speed. However, it is generally outclassed by Garchomp, which has a better Speed tier and usable secondary STAB moves. Toxic can be used on the defensive set in order to cripple other walls such as Cresselia and Hippowdon that otherwise don't mind switching into Landorus-T. Landorus-T has an acceptable base 105 Special Attack to utilize Hidden Power Ice, which can be an effective lure, since Landorus-T usually can't do much to an opposing Landorus-T. It can also surprise Garchomp and Mega Salamence, though it has no other targets beyond them. Yache Berry can be used to survive Ice-type coverage moves such as Hidden Power Ice from Thundurus and Ice Punch from Tyranitar, though unless you wish to run Stealth Rock, Assault Vest is generally better. Fissure can be used on Assault Vest sets and defensive sets to punish bulky threats that might otherwise be able to switch in completely safely, such as Suicune, Ferrothorn, and Porygon2, though it's difficult to fit it on a set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Rotom-W, and Mega Slowbro can take anything from Landorus-T and retaliate with their respective Water-type STAB moves or even Ice Beam. Rotom-W in particular is immune to Earthquake and doesn't fear anything from Landorus-T except losing its item to Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Move Users: Ice-type moves are very common on many top threats for dealing with Garchomp, so Landorus-T has a difficult time against common users of these moves. Bulky Water-types, Cresselia, Greninja, Mamoswine, Zapdos, Thundurus, Porygon2, Gengar, and even Blaziken are all viable users of Ice-type moves that can beat Landorus-T. However, more offensive threats often hit Landorus-T's Special Defense, so they must be wary of Assault Vest variants.</p> <p><strong>Mega Heracross: Mega Heracross resists all of Landorus-T's common moves bar Rock-type moves and is generally bulky enough to switch into and 2HKO offensive variants with Rock Blast or Bullet Seed. Unlike many physical attackers, it also doesn't fear Rocky Helmet, since neither move makes contact.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: While Landorus-T has a huge Attack stat, it has trouble breaking through physically bulky threats because it rarely runs boosting moves or items. Cresselia, Porygon2, Gliscor, Mega Venusaur, Skarmory, Hippowdon, Ferrothorn, and even opposing Landorus-T can be difficult for Landorus-T to break through unless they've been weakened already. However, Porygon2 and Ferrothorn must be wary of switching into Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Landorus-T often relies on Intimidate to check physical attackers, but it has no way to take powerful special attacks if it doesn't have an Assault Vest. Mixed Mega Salamence, Serperior, and Hydreigon can all give Landorus-T a difficult time, especially Choice Scarf variants that are locked into the wrong move. Locking into Earthquake can also give the likes of Latios and Mega Charizard Y an easy turn to hit Landorus-T hard.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is a powerful STAB move with fantastic coverage that is effective for cleaning late-game, especially if the opponent lacks switch-ins to Ground-type moves. U-turn allows Landorus-T to pivot out safely against bad matchups, since Landorus-T often forces switches thanks to Intimidate and its great Attack stat. Knock Off can also capitalize on forced switches by removing items from threats such as Porygon2 or even opposing Landorus-T, which otherwise safely switch into Landorus-T. Knock Off gives Landorus-T a way to hit Gengar as well without needing to guess whether or not Gengar will Mega Evolve. Superpower has a chance to OHKO Mega Kangaskhan and also hits Ferrothorn harder than Earthquake. It can also OHKO Mamoswine, though Mamoswine commonly runs Focus Sash and OHKOes Landorus-T with Ice Shard if it hasn't been affected by Intimidate. Rock-type coverage complements STAB Earthquake well, preventing Flying-types from freely switching in. Rock Slide is preferred for its accuracy and flinch chance, while Stone Edge allows Landorus-T to beat bulkier Thundurus reliably at the cost of lower accuracy. Stone Edge's lower accuracy can be very undesirable if using Landorus-T as a Talonflame check, though. Rock Tomb is also an option that doesn't give up as much momentum as Rock Slide or Stone Edge if an enemy switches into it, since it can help a teammate outspeed a faster foe, though the Speed drop doesn't help Landorus-T much.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Landorus-T to hit as hard and fast as possible, while the leftover EVs are placed in HP. Choice Scarf allows Landorus-T to function as an effective revenge killer and pivot, hitting a comfortable Speed tier that outspeeds nearly all unboosted threats. Intimidate allows Landorus-T to switch into the many physical attackers in the format more comfortably, increasing its effectiveness as a pivot. An Adamant nature is preferred for the extra power and is necessary for the chance to OHKO Mega Kangaskhan, and the power in general allows Landorus-T to revenge kill and clean more effectively late-game. Alternatively, a Jolly nature allows Landorus-T to outspeed Adamant Mega Charizard X after a Dragon Dance and prevents Life Orb Blaziken from outspeeding it after one Speed Boost, though Adamant is generally better unless outspeeding these threats is preferable.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Landorus-T is a very effective pivot, so it functions well as a lead. If the opponent lacks Mamoswine or if you don't know what to lead with, leading with Landorus-T is generally safe, since it can U-turn out of most unfavorable matchups. Avoid locking into Earthquake early as well, especially if the opponent might have a dangerous Flying-type such as Talonflame or Mega Salamence. A great defensive typing and Intimidate also mean that Landorus-T can often find several opportunities to switch in throughout the battle, which can help regain momentum. Bringing Landorus-T in after a teammate has been KOed is also effective, as this allows it to gain momentum or revenge kill a foe. Cleaning up late-game is also possible, since Landorus-T has great Attack, which is made easier if the opponent lacks any Ground-immune Pokemon, though removing threats immune to Ground-type moves should always be a priority regardless. Landorus-T has difficulty breaking through defensive teams, though, especially when locked into one move, so you're usually better off not bringing it against bulkier teams.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Suicune covers Landorus-T's Ice- and Water-type weaknesses while Landorus-T is immune to Electric-type moves. Suicune also appreciates the Intimidate support to handle physical attackers more effectively. Mega Gengar can trap Cresselia, which is a threat for Landorus-T, since it often runs Ice Beam to beat Landorus-T, and Landorus-T usually can't beat Cresselia on its own anyway. Setup sweepers appreciate Intimidate support from Landorus-T; Blaziken, Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, Scizor, and Mega Kangaskhan all have an easier time setting up against a weakened physical attacker. Landorus-T also has an easier time cleaning up afterwards if its partner couldn't finish the job. Scizor in particular also creates an effective VoltTurn core with Landorus-T and appreciates its ability to threaten opposing Fire-types, which otherwise switch into Scizor easily. Electric-types such as Thundurus, Zapdos, Raikou, Rotom-W, and Mega Manectric can handle the Water-types that threaten Landorus-T. Rotom-W, Raikou, or Mega Manectric can form an effective VoltTurn core with Landorus-T while Rotom-W can also handle Ice-type moves, whereas Thundurus and Zapdos appreciate having a partner that can switch into Ground-types they can't deal with such as Excadrill with Sand Rush active. Ferrothorn is a reliable partner for pivoting into, since Iron Barbs and Rocky Helmet can punish physical attackers even further, and it can reliably deal with Water-types.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake provides Landorus-T with a powerful and accurate STAB move that still does a lot of damage uninvested. U-turn allows it to pivot out of difficult matchups more effectively and maintain momentum after setting Stealth Rock, which provides useful support for offensive sweepers such as Volcarona and Blaziken that can't deal with Talonflame. Not all teams need this Stealth Rock support, though, so Knock Off can be used instead for the utility of removing a foe's item. While Stealth Rock deters Talonflame from switching in, Rock Tomb can be used to prevent Talonflame from attempting to set up on Landorus-T while also lowering the Speed of any foe switching in, making it easier for Landorus-T or a teammate to deal with it. Rock Slide offers more power at the cost of accuracy if the speed control isn't necessary, though Rock Tomb is generally a better option. If covering Talonflame is not a concern, Knock Off and Stealth Rock can be used together.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EVs maximize physical bulk while ensuring that Landorus-T outspeeds Garchomp after Rock Tomb. An Impish nature is used in order to check physical attackers better, such as the aforementioned Garchomp, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Blaziken. Investing more in Speed allows Landorus-T to outspeed various threats after Rock Tomb at the cost of bulk; 60 Speed EVs allow Landorus-T to outspeed everything up to base 110 Speed after Rock Tomb, while 92 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Pokemon with up to base 115 Speed after Rock Tomb. Intimidate complements Landorus-T's bulk, allowing it to comfortably switch into most physical attackers without taking too much damage. Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers further and allows Landorus-T to function as a safe switch-in to Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set works well as a lead to try to set Stealth Rock as early as possible and is effective at forcing switches because an opponent is likely to expect Landorus-T to be running Choice Scarf. Landorus-T wants to force as many switches as possible to rack up more Stealth Rock damage, so using U-turn after setting Stealth Rock helps Landorus-T wear down the opposing team, as it can often force another switch while maintaining momentum. When setting Stealth Rock is not necessary, Landorus-T still functions as an effective switch-in to physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Blaziken, punishing them with Rocky Helmet damage as well as lowering their Attack. Landorus-T can switch into physical attackers very liberally thanks to Intimidate and its great defensive typing, though its lack of recovery means that it usually can't handle entire teams by itself. If Landorus-T is necessary to check a specific threat, avoid switching it in too much, since it needs to remain healthy in order to check stronger physical attackers such as Mega Charizard X and Talonflame effectively. Landorus-T's lack of recovery or means to threaten defensive foes such as Cresselia and Slowbro make it a liability against defensive teams, so it's generally better to avoid bringing it against such teams.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Landorus-T appreciates teammates that can beat leads with Ice-type moves such as Mamoswine and Greninja, so Conkeldurr and bulky Water-types are effective teammates. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune also appreciate Intimidate support and switch into Water- and Ice-type moves for Landorus-T, while Landorus-T can switch into Electric-type moves. Suicune can also set up with Calm Mind and Substitute against defensive threats that Landorus-T can't deal with. Electric-types such as Rotom-W, Zapdos, Raikou, and Mega Manectric can deal with opposing bulky Water-types that Landorus-T struggles to beat. Raikou and Mega Manectric also appreciate having a teammate that can come in on Ground-type moves, and the latter outspeeds Greninja after Mega Evolving. Fire-types such as Blaziken, Talonflame, and Mega Charizard X appreciate Landorus-T's ability to switch into Ground- and Rock-type moves. They also appreciate Landorus-T's ability to wear down foes through Rocky Helmet damage and Stealth Rock in order to sweep more effectively. However, the added weakness to Water-types can be problematic. Landorus-T pairs well with sweepers in general, including Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Lucario, and Mega Mawile, due to its great defensive typing and ability to wear down foes. All three of these also struggle with Mega Blaziken and Garchomp to some extent, and Landorus-T deals with both reasonably well.</p>"

        "name": "Assault Vest",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is a powerful STAB move that does huge damage to anything that doesn't resist it. U-turn allows Landorus-T to function as an effective pivot and escape difficult matchups, which works well with the switches that it often forces. Knock Off allows Landorus-T to punish switches by removing the foe's item and lets it hit Gengar and Cresselia harder. Superpower can be used to hit Mega Kangaskhan and Ferrothorn harder and has a chance to OHKO the former with an Adamant nature. Rock Tomb is effective for lowering the Speed of a switch-in so that Landorus-T can beat an otherwise faster foe itself, which helps mitigate Landorus-T's otherwise average Speed. Stone Edge is much more powerful at the cost of being less accurate, and it notably allows Landorus-T to beat bulky Thundurus more reliably. Rock Slide is a middle ground option that's more accurate than Stone Edge while still being more powerful than Rock Tomb. The flinch chance can also get Landorus-T out of tight situations.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EVs allow Landorus-T to hit as hard as possible while allowing it to outspeed all Pokemon up to base 115 Speed after Rock Tomb. The remaining EVs are placed in HP to increase Landorus-T's bulk to help it survive stronger special attacks, such as Hidden Power Ice from Life Orb Thundurus and Overheat from Timid Mega Charizard Y. If a faster Landorus-T is preferred, a spread of 252 Atk / 28 SpD / 228 Spe should be used so that Life Orb Thundurus can't OHKO Landorus-T with Hidden Power Ice. Assault Vest allows Landorus-T to function as pivot with mixed bulk combined with Intimidate reducing a foe's Attack. This is effective at luring common users of Hidden Power Ice that otherwise can OHKO Landorus-T. An Adamant nature boosts Landorus-T's Attack further and is preferred, since it can use Rock Tomb to help it outspeed foes regardless. A Jolly nature doesn't help Landorus-T outspeed many threats, though it does allow it to outspeed Adamant Mega Charizard X, Modest Volcarona, and Timid Rotom-W and Rotom-H.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Assault Vest Landorus-T has the bulk to switch into both physical and special attackers, so it functions as an effective pivot. Landorus-T is a tank, so it should take advantage of its great typing and mixed bulk in order to switch into threats and retaliate with its strong attacks. Many threats rely on strong special attacks to beat Landorus-T because they aren't affected by Intimidate, so Assault Vest is effective for letting it surprise these special attackers. This includes common users of Hidden Power Ice such as Thundurus, Volcarona, and Life Orb Blaziken, as well as generally powerful special attackers like Hydreigon and Sylveon. Most opponents expect Choice Scarf from Landorus-T, so bluffing that set can be particularly effective against Flying-types such as Dragonite and Talonflame that think they have a free turn to set up after switching into Earthquake. This also makes Landorus-T a safe lead, since Choice Scarf Landorus-T is also commonly used as a lead and is effective at forcing switches.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Rotom-W are effective partners that can deal with Water- and Ice-types for Landorus-T and appreciate having a partner to help them take physical attacks better as well as threaten Electric-types. Paralysis support is very useful for Landorus-T due to its average Speed, especially if you're not running Rock Tomb. Thundurus, Serperior, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos are all effective partners that can offer this support. They're also all effective against bulky Water-types that give Landorus-T a difficult time. Mega Kangaskhan appreciates having a teammate that can beat Fighting-types such as Blaziken, and Assault Vest allows Landorus-T to switch into special Mega Lucario more effectively. Strong setup sweepers such as Talonflame, Mega Blaziken, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Mawile appreciate Landorus-T's ability to switch into threats such as Thundurus and Heatran, with the former three all dealing with Ferrothorn and Skarmory. Landorus-T can also use U-turn after a faster foe attacks to let them come in safely, especially if Landorus-T forgoes Speed investment. This Landorus-T is effective as part of a VoltTurn core thanks to its bulk, so common users of Volt Switch and U-turn such as Rotom-W, Scizor, Mega Manectric, and Raikou pair well with it.</p>"

        "name": "Offensive Stealth Rock",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock allows Landorus-T to support powerful setup sweepers that appreciate its ability to break Focus Sash and rack up extra damage, which is generally easy to set up thanks to Focus Sash. Earthquake is Landorus-T's main STAB move, usually dealing a lot of damage when unresisted. Rock Tomb is primarily used for its ability to lower the foe's Speed, but if Focus Sash is still intact, the combination of Rock Tomb and Earthquake can disrupt faster foes like Greninja. Rock Tomb also does significant damage to Flying-types such as Talonflame, Thundurus, Charizard, and Salamence. Explosion is a last-resort option that is best used after Focus Sash has been broken, dealing huge damage to anything that doesn't resist it while allowing a teammate to come in on the next turn without taking damage. U-turn can get Landorus-T out of difficult situations with certain leads such as Breloom and Rotom-W and is generally useful or scouting if you wish to preserve Landorus-T for later in the game. Knock Off removes problematic items such as Rocky Helmet and Eviolite and hits Gengar hard, while Superpower can be used to hit Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Focus Sash might appear unnecessary considering Landorus-T's impressive bulk, but it nearly guarantees that you can set up Stealth Rock against any common lead other than Mamoswine. Focus Sash is also useful for revenge killing foes that Landorus-T normally can't beat, such as Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Greninja. Maximum Attack and Speed investment with an Adamant nature is ideal for the most power, and with a Focus Sash there's little need for defensive investment, since setting Stealth Rock is the primary goal of this set. However, a Jolly nature can be used in order to outspeed neutral-natured Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Charizard X, and Volcarona.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Setting up Stealth Rock is often the main priority, especially if you need it for certain sweepers to take down Talonflame, but saving Landorus-T for later can also be advantageous to safely revenge kill a foe. While Landorus-T is still useful beyond the utility of its Focus Sash, Mamoswine leads are a huge issue, so benching Landorus-T is fine if you see it at Team Preview. If running U-turn, make sure to capitalize on the momentum it provides, because Landorus-T forces a lot of switches. It's also useful for getting sweepers in safely, especially after setting Stealth Rock, since this might force another switch and rack up more damage. If running Explosion, don't be afraid to use it immediately after setting Stealth Rock if it can put a sweeper in the position to clean up quickly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Landorus-T set is best paired with setup sweepers, since they greatly appreciate the Stealth Rock damage and surprise KOs that Landorus-T can get for them. Examples of effective partners include Mega Kangaskhan, which appreciates the residual damage to deal with Cresselia and Suicune, and Mega Lucario, which can KO Talonflame with +2 Extreme Speed. Mega Blaziken also loves Stealth Rock to bring down Talonflame, and Mega Charizard X can set up on bulky Water-types that often switch into Landorus-T. Breloom and Mamoswine are both problematic leads for Landorus-T, so teammates that can deal with them are ideal. Rotom-W helps a lot with Mamoswine, Safety Goggles Aegislash completely walls Breloom, and Mega Venusaur deals with both of them thanks to Thick Fat and an immunity to Spore. While Ferrothorn is weak to Fighting-type moves, it can help check Breloom with a combination of Iron Barbs damage and Gyro Ball.</p>"

  "Talonflame": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite being a \"starter bird\" of the Kalos region, Talonflame is a popular competitive choice for having the strongest priority in the game in the form of Gale Wings and Brave Bird. Combine that with the highest Speed stat of all generation VI Pokemon, and you have a Pokemon capable of sweeping through weakened teams late-game. Although its other stats are very mediocre, Talonflame makes up for this with access to a lot of useful moves and great compatibility with numerous items.</p> <p>One of Talonflame's greatest strengths is that it places a lot of restrictions on the opponent's options in Team Preview. A Flying-type check becomes mandatory, and Talonflame-weak Pokemon such as Blaziken and Lopunny are unable to move as freely because Talonflame is a great check to them. However, it's important to note that many people bring Stealth Rock support with Talonflame-weak sweepers, so don't expect an easy match just because the opponent's win condition is a Blaziken. Talonflame also does a lot of damage to itself thanks to recoil from its most common attacks and common Rocky Helmet users.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Natural Gift allows Talonflame to deal significant damage to its usual counters as long as it's holding the appropriate Berry. At +2, Natural Gift OHKOes Rotom-W and Heatran with the Liechi and Salac Berries, respectively. However, it's a one-time trick, and Talonflame will not be holding any items afterwards to boost its offensive capability. You can use it in conjunction with Acrobatics if you want to take advantage of the item removal and don't like Brave Bird recoil, but keep in mind that it won't deal a lot of damage without a Swords Dance boost. Overheat is also a cool option that can be used with Life Orb to catch physical walls off guard, most notably Mega Aggron, Mega Steelix, and Avalugg, although all three of these Pokemon are hardly seen in Battle Spot Singles. Protect is useful to prevent extra damage from Fake Out from Pokemon such as Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mienshao, though you lose a valuable moveslot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: The 4x Rock weakness severely limits Talonflame's mobility throughout the match. Combine it with any defensive Pokemon and you can effectively put Talonflame into a checkmate.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: If a Choice Band Talonflame doesn't use U-turn upon Rock-types switching in, they can easily take a Brave Bird or Flare Blitz and proceed to set up Stealth Rock while scaring Talonflame away. Burns won't save the Rocky Helmet set from STAB Stone Edges from Pokemon like Tyranitar and Rhyperior.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon: Mega Slowbro, Cresselia, Porygon2, Hippowdon, Heatran, and bulky Gyarados will tank multiple Choice Band-boosted Brave Birds and either hit back hard or recover health. Against the Rocky Helmet set, Gyarados, Hippowdon, and Cresselia will have difficulty getting through, so watch out. Porygon2 and Mega Slowbro can get through with Discharge/Thunderbolt and Scald, respectively. Heatran wins if it gets off a Toxic before getting Taunted, but get ready for a long battle if it fails to do so.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Zapdos can take multiple Choice Band-boosted Brave Birds and hit back extremely hard. Thundurus cannot tank two Choice Band-boosted Brave Birds, but it can check Talonflame effectively and even paralyze Talonflame with priority Thunder Wave. All of them except Rotom-A cannot take Flare Blitz too well, so don't send them in carelessly. All of them are special attackers, so burns aren't a problem.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Offensive Pokemon: Garchomp, Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, and Mega Kangaskhan can check Choice Band Talonflame and OHKO with any powerful attack. Against the Rocky Helmet set, Garchomp and Landorus-T can break through with Stone Edge, hold a Lum Berry, hold a Choice Scarf to beat Talonflame before getting burned, or set up Swords Dance. Mega Kangaskhan can beat Talonflame with Fake Out + burned Rock Slide or Facade, and Mega Salamence can set up Dragon Dance on the turn of Will-O-Wisp and muscle through with Double-Edge.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: The Rocky Helmet set will not be able to beat Mega Sableye thanks to Magic Bounce preventing Taunt, and Mega Sableye will freely start setting up Calm Mind. Choice Band Talonflame can 2HKO Mega Sableye, so the only hope it has is to Recover stall until Talonflame faints from recoil damage.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash</strong>: Aegislash checks Talonflame thanks to King's Shield and Talonflame's main offensive options making contact. Special Aegislash don't mind getting burned either and can beat Talonflame with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Recoil</strong>: Recoil is an issue for Talonflame, as its main offensive options deal a third of the damage dealt to the opponent to Talonflame. Combine that with Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, and Rough Skin, and Talonflame often knock themselves out.</p>",

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Brave Bird takes full advantage of Gale Wings to hit the opponent with a STAB 120 Base Power priority move. It's also the best answer the game has for Blaziken. Flare Blitz is Talonflame's other STAB option if locking into Brave Bird is not optimal, and it hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Scizor very hard. U-turn allows Talonflame to scout opponents and keep momentum in your favor.</p> <p>The last slot is mainly filler, as you'll rarely use anything aside from the first three moves, but in certain situations, using Will-O-Wisp or Tailwind to support the next teammate is the best option. Sleep Talk is also a viable option that allows Talonflame to switch into an incoming Spore from Breloom.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This set is designed to maximize Talonflame's offensive capabilities. Despite only having a measly base 81 Attack, great Attack investment with Choice Band gives it a lot of firepower and makes it easier to spam Brave Bird. Adamant is often preferred over Jolly because the boost in Attack is more important than Speed when Talonflame fires off priority moves. 220 EVs in Speed let Talonflame outspeed maximum Speed Liepard to beat Assist Spore. They also let Talonflame beat priority users such as Mega Kangaskhan and a lot of Talonflame variants that put more investment into HP. 44 HP EVs give Talonflame 159 HP to optimize passive damage and give it a slight boost in bulk. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack.</p> <p>It's possible to sacrifice some Speed EVs for HP to increase longevity and handle recoil better, but keep in mind this can allow opposing Pokemon to outspeed Talonflame with priority. Key Pokemon to look out for are opposing Talonflame and Mega Kangaskhan (if you opt for less than 172 EVs in Speed). It will also limit Pokemon you will be able to use U-turn against.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Ideally, this Talonflame's role is to sweep the opponent once all of their Pokemon are within KO range from Brave Bird. Until then, it can be used as a scout or pivot with U-turn, or heavily dent Pokemon that switch into Brave Bird or Flare Blitz. However, it's frail and takes a lot of recoil, so don't expect it to pull through teams it cannot take out alone. Choice Band Talonflame's matchups are usually either very good or very bad, so keep your opponent's team in mind when locking yourself into a move. Avoid bad matchups as much as possible, and make good use of U-turn predicting your opponent to switch out Talonflame-weak Pokemon and keep momentum on your side. Flare Blitz also 2HKOes non-Sitrus Berry Zapdos, which is commonly used to stop Talonflame, so if the opponent is afraid of Brave Bird and has Zapdos in their team, Flare Blitz is usually a pretty good option.</p> <p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the opponent will know Talonflame is holding a Choice Band from the damage output and will plan accordingly. If you think it's in your favor to keep your Talonflame set ambiguous in a match, don't use U-turn. It rarely is the case, as many people will assume you're using a Choice Band anyway, but occasionally it makes it hard for opponents to bring in certain Pokemon when they don't know you're locked into Flare Blitz. It's also important to look out for Rocky Helmet users, as combined with move recoil it will hurt you a lot.</p> <p>While not as common as in 6v6, Stealth Rock does have a decent presence in Battle Spot Singles, especially on Blaziken teams. There are also a few Pokemon that spam Roar or Whirlwind after setting up Stealth Rock, such as Hippowdon and Swampert, so don't bring Talonflame when facing a team with Hippowdon or a non-rain team Swampert. Entry hazard management is useful, but the difficulty is not really worth it. Defog users and Rapid Spin users are very limited in number, and using a turn to remove entry hazards is usually not the best option.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Talonflame's ideal use is to sweep weakened teams late-game. Due to this simplicity, Talonflame works with Pokemon that deal severe damage to Pokemon that stop these sweeps. Garchomp resists a lot of Talonflame's weaknesses and clears the path very effectively with super effective Earthquakes against the three types that resist Flying, though it does struggle against Zapdos, Thundurus, Rotom-W, and Skarmory. Talonflame can also finish off teams weakened by offensive Pokemon such as Greninja, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Gengar.</p>"

        "name": "Bulky Rocky Helmet",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Brave Bird is Talonflame's main STAB move, because you can't go wrong with a 120 Base Power STAB priority move. Will-O-Wisp completely stops physical attackers, and combined with priority Roost, a lot of opponents such as Mega Salamence and Mega Mawile will not be able to get past Talonflame. Taunt allows Talonflame to handle support Pokemon and slowly scrape off HP with burn damage while preventing bulky Pokemon from recovering HP.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>92 Speed EVs and Jolly nature allow Talonflame to outspeed Adamant Mega Salamence. Putting 252 EVs into Defense will give Talonflame 174 HP and will therefore go down after two switches with Stealth Rock up, so 8 EVs are shifted to HP. As a little bonus, 175 HP is optimal for handling passive damage. Rocky Helmet is for taking on opposing physical attackers. Even without any Attack investment, Brave Bird has the same damage output as a maximum Attack Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against tankier, stall Pokemon, Taunt allows Talonflame to get past a lot of them with relative ease. On top of that, priority Roost lets Talonflame stall out foes with burn damage. In essence, physical attackers that are unable to 2HKO Talonflame while burned will not be able to beat it. If used effectively enough, all of the opponent's Pokemon will eventually enter Brave Bird range. There is also the element of surprise in your favor, as most opponents will assume Talonflame to be a Choice Band set. This set is also very good against Pokemon that rely on Sucker Punch, such as Bisharp, Mega Mawile, and Mega Kangaskhan, as it allows Talonflame to get a free burn and cripple them.</p> <p>That said, keep in mind Will-O-Wisp can miss and there are physical Pokemon that are capable of 2HKOing while burned, notably Rock-types, Rock Slide Mega Kangaskhan, and Belly Drum Azumarill. However, Rock-types deal half damage when Roosting, so don't forget to check the amount of damage the opponent does to Talonflame to avoid unnecessary accidents. This set doesn't fare too well against special attackers, so don't force yourself to stay in against them. This set is also setup fodder for Mega Sableye. Stealth Rock isn't as scary on this set if you can create opportunities to Roost back up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Garchomp is a great teammate that can switch into hits that Talonflame prefers not to take and effectively scrape off a lot of HP from the opponent. Tyranitar is also a nice teammate to have for special attackers, though keep in mind the sandstorm can sometimes affect the longevity of Talonflame. Talonflame also helps Tyranitar greatly by scaring away Fighting types and weakening physical attackers. Other specially defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Cresselia make great teammates as well, especially if you plan on stalling out foes with burn damage.</p>"

      {
        "name": "Flexible Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Brave Bird is Talonflame's best move, hitting hard with STAB 120 Base Power. Flare Blitz takes advantage of Talonflame's other STAB type, allowing it to hit opposing Steel-types or other Pokemon that would otherwise survive a Brave Bird. Swords Dance allows Talonflame to sweep through a lot of teams, especially when everything is in range of a +2 Brave Bird. Roost is another option in this slot if you want to switch Talonflame a lot during a battle, giving it more opportunities to switch into Stealth Rock, as well as mitigate the tremendous amounts of recoil done by the attacking moves, Rocky Helmet, and Life Orb. Will-O-Wisp is a handy support option that Talonflame can use against incoming switch-ins, crippling them if they're physical attackers. U-turn allows Talonflame to switch out while damaging the opponent, potentially breaking Focus Sashes or giving you the upper hand when the opponent decides to switch. Tailwind can come in handy if you want to sacrifice Talonflame to allow your next Pokemon to come in with double Speed, which can be very helpful for Pokemon that are in a mediocre Speed tier, such as Mega Heracross and Sylveon. Taunt is also a useful option to prevent the opponent from setting up entry hazards or boosts. Although it does require a fair amount of prediction, it is very effective against Pokemon such as Skarmory and Cresselia.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>44 HP EVs give Talonflame 159 HP, which is a Life Orb number and optimizes passive damage. Attack is maximized to increase damage output. 212 Speed EVs let Talonflame outspeed base 105 Speed Pokemon, allowing Talonflame to Flare Blitz Manectric before it Mega Evolves, which will OHKO after a Swords Dance if Talonflame is holding a Life Orb. An Adamant nature is preferred over Jolly as it gives a 10% boost to Attack, while Talonflame doesn't necessarily need the 10% boost in Speed thanks to Gale Wings. However, a Jolly nature with 228 Speed EVs will allow Talonflame to outspeed Water Shuriken Greninja that may potentially stop its sweep as well as outspeed and OHKO Thundurus with Flare Blitz after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p>Life Orb provides Talonflame with the most powerful boost it can get without locking itself to a move, allowing Talonflame to choose moves flexibly based on the opponent in front of it. Sharp Beak is also an option for this slot if you don't want to deal with Life Orb recoil on top of the recoil from the two main attacking moves, but keep in mind it will not boost Flare Blitz and Brave Bird will be slightly less powerful.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Talonflame is best used when the path is clear for a sweep. One key difference between this set and the Choice Band set is that Talonflame won't be locked into a move, allowing it to switch between Brave Bird and Flare Blitz, Taunt opposing support Pokemon, recover HP with Roost, burn opposing Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp, or set up a Swords Dance. Due to this flexibility, this set is capable of going up against both offensive and defensive Pokemon and provide support for the other two members in your team. Even if the opponent has a Zapdos in their team, if you set up a Swords Dance on the switch Flare Blitz can OHKO with Life Orb.</p> <p>However, due to Talonflame's lackluster defensive stats, it's usually unable to fully utilize its entire moveset before going down. Therefore, whenever Talonflame is sent out, keep in mind what is needed the most in the current situation in the battle and choose its moves accordingly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Talonflame is very flexible, so it is able to fit into almost any team. It enjoys Garchomp, Aegislash, and Mega Lucario as a partner because they can switch into incoming Rock-type moves and dish out a lot of damage. Breloom is also a good partner, as Tailwind can double its Speed to allow it to Spore faster opponents, as well as Spore slow Rock-types and defensive Pokemon. Putting Pokemon to sleep also gives Talonflame a great opportunity to set up Swords Dance. Mega Gengar is a great partner to remove Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro and Cresselia, which prevent Talonflame from sweeping. If you're using Perish Trap Gengar with Wobbuffet, Wobbuffet can also give Talonflame an opportunity to set up Swords Dance by Encoring the opponent into a status or Ground-type move.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Brave Bird is Talonflame's strongest Flying-type STAB move to take advantage of Gale Wings. It will mainly be used to revenge kill weakened Pokemon or finish off foes after stalling burn damage. Will-O-Wisp is great for wearing down Pokemon and hindering physical attackers. Taunt stops defensive Pokemon from using recovery or using Toxic on Talonflame. Roost allows Talonflame to stall Pokemon alongside burn damage, and thanks to Gale Wings, it can Roost on faster offensive Pokemon as well.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The HP and Defense EVs allow Talonflame to avoid being KOed by a combination of Rock Tomb and Mach Punch from a burned Breloom so you can beat Focus Sash variants. 52 Speed EVs are used to outspeed up to Adamant maximum Speed Mega Kangaskhan, and the remaining EVs are dumped into Special Defense. A Careful nature with a lot of Special Defense investment is used to take on common special attacking walls such as Cresselia and Porygon2. The Special Defense is also helpful to take on some common offensive special attackers such as Mega Gengar and Sylveon. Lum Berry allows Talonflame to switch into defensive Pokemon, such as Cresselia and Chansey, and avoid getting poisoned by Toxic. It also helps to avoid getting put to sleep by Breloom and Mega Venusaur. Gale Wings allows Talonflame to revenge kill weakened Pokemon with Brave Bird or use priority Roost to stall out faster Pokemon, such as Latios and Mega Gengar.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set should be played defensively, slowly wearing down Pokemon until they get in range of a KO from Brave Bird. Bring Talonflame in against defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia, Porygon2, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur, and wear them down with Will-O-Wisp and Taunt to limit their recovery. Taking these bulky Pokemon out or weakening them can pave the way for Talonflame's more offensive teammates to win the game. After Talonflame's Lum Berry is used, be careful switching directly into defensive Pokemon because Toxic is detrimental to this set. Once you have Pokemon such as Cresselia and Ferrothorn burned and Taunted, you can safely spam Will-O-Wisp to catch switch-ins. Since they will be doing very little damage to Talonflame, Roosting every turn isn't necessary, so you can Roost only when needed and use Will-O-Wisp on other turns. This set is mainly used as a stallbreaker, but thanks to Gale Wings it's very flexible. It can also be used against offensive teams as a check to Pokemon such as Mega Gengar, Aegislash, Blaziken, and Volcarona. Priority Brave Bird can pick up revenge kills on many weakened Pokemon on offensive teams, and Will-O-Wisp is very useful against teams with a lot of strong physical attackers, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Garchomp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Talonflame works very well with many physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Mawile, Tyranitar, Garchomp, and Mamoswine, as it is able to weaken and take care of many physical walls such as Cresselia and Ferrothorn and switch into Will-O-Wisp for them. In turn, many of these physical attackers are able to deal with Thundurus and other Electric-types for Talonflame. Mega Gengar likes taking advantage of the burns Talonflame spreads with Hex. Suicune and Rotom-W like having Talonflame around as a check to Grass-types. Suicune and defensive Rotom-W variants can deal with Garchomp for Talonflame. Rotom-W can also take out bulky Water-types, such as Suicune, and use Volt Switch to get Talonflame in safely against opposing Pokemon so Talonflame doesn't need to risk switching directly in and fear taking an incoming Toxic or Sleep move.</p>"

  "Sylveon": {
    "overview": "<p>The Intertwining Pokemon shows off its amazing Fairy typing, which gives it only weaknesses to Poison and Steel as well as an immunity to Dragon-type moves, allowing Sylveon to check Mega Salamence in the Battle Spot metagame. Sylveon is very straightforward and an easy-to-use Pokemon with Choice Specs. It has an excellent Special Attack stat and has great special bulk, which helps it deal enormous damage while taking hits from other special attackers. Sylveon also has access to Pixilate, which changes its Normal-type moves to Fairy, thus giving them STAB. This allows it to utilize a boosted Hyper Voice to hammer through many threats that don't resist it such as Garchomp and offensive Landorus-T.</p> <p>However, Sylveon's Poison- and Steel-type weaknesses are exploited by many threats such as Mega Gengar, Aegislash, Excadrill, Mega Mawile, and Scizor. Despite Sylveon's impressive health, its physical bulk is too poor for it to take several powerful physical attacks. Sylveon also lacks a wide movepool, leaving its options limited and predictable against other players. Sylveon's Speed is very low as well, and it normally doesn't run much Speed investment either, so even defensive threats such as Heatran, Venusaur, and Suicune can outspeed it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Pixie Plate is an alternative for Sylveon to still get a power boost for its Fairy-type moves, allowing Sylveon to bluff Choice Specs and fool the threat to stay in so that it can get a free hit. However, Choice Specs is a much stronger option to utilize, as it lets Sylveon deal more damage with all of its coverage moves. Yawn can come in handy to pressure the opponent into switching out. Additionally, there's no sleep clause, meaning Sylveon can put multiple foes to sleep. However, Sylveon misses out on coverage moves and it doesn't have enough physical bulk to deal with physical attackers. Quick Attack is used to pick off weakened or frail threats, and it also gets a boost from Pixilate. Use it with a Pixie Plate and a Quiet nature. Rocky Helmet deals passive damage against physical attackers, but once again, Sylveon's low physical bulk makes this a subpar option.</p> <p>A bulky spread of max HP and Defense should be used if using Rocky Helmet. Stored Power can be used alongside Calm Mind to have a huge power boost after setting up, but Psyshock is much more useful, particularly hitting Chansey for more damage. Protect is useful for scouting the foe's move and help Sylveon switch into a more reasonable counter. Additionally, it can be used alongside Wish and Leftovers for the much-needed recovery, but then Sylveon will lose out on its coverage moves to check other threats. Toxic sets a timer on defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia, Porygon2, Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H. Pixilate-boosted Hyper Beam can be used as a great and powerful finisher to many threats as a chance to get a KO. However, Sylveon will have to recharge on the next turn, giving the foe the upper hand. Sleep Talk is viable, as many threats such as Breloom and Hippowdon use Spore and Yawn. However, the randomness of Sleep Talk and boosted power of Snore make this less useful.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Heatran generally carries Flash Cannon and completely walls Sylveon if it's not carrying Hidden Power Ground. Aegislash can KO Sylveon with Iron Head or Flash Cannon and is able to survive a coverage move from it. Excadrill can easily take it down with Iron Head. Ferrothorn can take out Sylveon with Gyro Ball, but it needs to watch out for Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Mega Venusaur completely resists Sylveon's Hyper Voice. With Thick Fat, it can also take a Hidden Power Fire very well and retaliate with Sludge Bomb. Mega Gengar can threaten Sylveon out with Sludge Bomb as well, but it does need to be wary of Psyshock or Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Mega Mawile: Mega Mawile resists Sylveon's STAB moves and can easily KO it with its STAB Iron Head. However, it should be wary of Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Azumarill</strong>: Azumarill has a large chance to survive Hyper Voice. It can proceed to KO Sylveon with the combination of Play Rough and Aqua Jet. Choice Band variants are able to KO Sylveon with Play Rough, while Assault Vest variants can survive a Hyper Voice.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Salamence are able to OHKO Sylveon with STAB Double Edge. Adamant Mega Blaziken can get a Speed Boost from Protect and KO Sylveon with Flare Blitz. Greninja can make quick work of Sylveon with STAB Protean Gunk Shot. Choice Band variants of Talonflame have a low chance to OHKO Sylveon with Flare Blitz or Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Status: Unless it runs the uncommon Heal Bell, Sylveon is crippled by Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, and Toxic from Pokemon such as Thundurus, Rotom-W, and Chansey, unless it's using the Calm Mind + Rest set.</p>",

        "name": "Choice Specs Wallbreaker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Pixilate-boosted STAB Hyper Voice allows Sylveon to hit many Pokemon hard, especially the Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-types weak to it, such as Tyranitar, Mega Salamence, Garchomp, Mega Altaria, and Conkeldurr. Additionally, Hyper Voice can go through Substitute, hitting Pokemon such as Gliscor more reliably Psyshock provides Sylveon a nice way to check Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur and Mega Gengar, and by targeting Defense, it's also useful against Chansey, which would otherwise wall Sylveon. Shadow Ball is used to hit Aegislash and the uncommon Chandelure. Hidden Power Fire can assist Sylveon in eliminating problematic Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Scizor, Skarmory, and Klefki. However, Hidden Power Ground can be used instead to hit Fire-types that completely wall Sylveon, such as Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>236 HP EVs give Sylveon needed bulk in order to take attacks better. For example, it can survive Mega Gengar's Sludge Bomb. 12 Defense EVs are added in order to keep a full health Sylveon from being OHKOed by Choice Band Talonflame. 248 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature give Sylveon more damage output, 12 Speed EVs let Sylveon outspeed Aegislash and Porygon2. Pixilate is needed, as it turns Normal-type moves into Fairy-type moves and boosts their power by 33%. Choice Specs is used to give Sylveon the extra power needed to deal enormous damage to Pokemon that don't resist Fairy. Additionally, it increases the power of its coverage moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Usually, use Hyper Voice on Pokemon that don't resist it. Sylveon shouldn't be staying in on Steel-types such as Excadrill and the uncommon Bisharp because Iron Head is an easy OHKO, unless you predict them to Swords Dance, in which case Hyper Voice OHKOes Bisharp and 2HKOes Excadrill. The opponent can use the fact that Sylveon has a shallow movepool and will usually be carrying Choice Specs to their advantage; however, you can turn that around by looking at Team Preview. If you suspect your opponent will switch out to a more reasonable counter to Sylveon, that'll give you a chance to predict the switch and go into a counter of your own. Against Steel- and Poison-types that resists Fairy, make sure you go for coverage moves instead, such as Hidden Power Ground and Psyshock to deal with Aegislash, Excadrill, Heatran, and Mega Venusaur. Sylveon makes a decent lead as well, putting pressure on some common leads seen in the metagame such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Kangaskhan with Double-Edge can help Sylveon deal with powerful threats. Mega Kangaskhan also has access to Earthquake, which can help get rid of pesky Steel-types. In return, Sylveon can switch into Dark- and Fighting-type moves and eliminate Pokemon that give Mega Kangaskhan trouble, such as Mega Sableye and Conkeldurr. Garchomp and Hippowdon are also great partners for Sylveon, helping to eliminate Poison- and Steel-types such as Mega Gengar, Heatran, and Aegislash with STAB Earthquake. They are superb Stealth Rock users as well, turning potential 2HKOs into OHKOs for Sylveon. An example is non-Assault Vest variants of Azumarill. In return, Sylveon can punish Dragon-types for Garchomp, such as Hydreigon, Dragonite, and opposing Garchomp. Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X and Y, Heatran, Rotom-H, and Talonflame can deal with Steel-types that threaten Sylveon. Additionally, Talonflame can help take on Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Serperior.</p> <p>Rotom-H and Rotom-W are great for taking Flying-type attacks from Pokemon such as Talonflame and the rare Mega Pinsir. They can both utilize Will-O-Wisp to burn physical attackers, which helps mitigate Sylveon's low Defense. Ferrothorn can switch into Steel-type moves with ease and is immune to Poison, giving it good synergy with Sylveon. Magnezone is helpful in trapping other Steel-types with Magnet Pull, such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, and the uncommon Bisharp. Aegislash is a great partner for its ability to come in freely on some threats that take out or threaten Sylveon, such as Chansey, Mega Venusaur, Dragalge, and Mega Metagross. Sylveon appreciates Thunder Wave support from the likes of Thundurus and Cresselia, as it ruins many physical attackers' ability to check it. Cresselia deserves a special mention because it can tank physical attacks very well and switch into Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Salamence.</p>"
      },
      {
        "name": "Calm Mind + Rest",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind boosts Sylveon's Special Attack and Special Defense by one stage, making it bulkier and increasing its damage output. Rest is Sylveon's only reliable way of recovery, replenishing its health and removing status. Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice gives Sylveon STAB and much needed power for hitting anything that doesn't resist it. Snore is used together with Rest to ensure that Sylveon's sleep turns don't go to waste. Additionally, it also gets a Pixilate boost. It's a nice way to surprise a foe that thinks it could use those turns to set up. Alternatively, Psyshock could be used as it let Sylveon hit Poison-types such as Mega Gengar and Mega Venusaur. Also, it's needed for Sylveon to deal more damage to Chansey. Hidden Power Fire can also be used to hit Steel-types that shrug off Sylveon's STAB moves, such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>244 HP and 172 Defense EVs give Sylveon some physical bulk, allowing it a chance to survive Jolly Mega Kangaskhan's Double Edge. 68 Special Attack EVs increase Sylveon's damage output. 20 Speed EVs allow Sylveon to outspeed uninvested base 60 Speed Pokemon such as Clefable, Porygon2, and Aegislash. The remaining 4 EVs go to Special Defense so none are wasted. A Chesto Berry is needed to effectively use Rest, giving Sylveon a greater chance of sweeping with Calm Mind.</p> <p>Modest is the preferred nature over Bold because the extra power is needed for Sylveon to KO foes. However, Bold can still be used so that Sylveon can take more hits from physical attackers, and when it's used with maximum HP and Defense investment, this set can become a late-game win condition. Leftovers offers much appreciated passive recovery. Sylveon almost always has to use Snore if it's holding Leftovers to avoid dead turns while asleep from Rest.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Sylveon should set up Calm Mind on defensive Pokemon, such as Hippowdon, Porygon2, Rotom-W, and Zapdos, that can't touch it. With Rest, Sylveon is able to replenish its health and get rid of any status. However, be wary of Rotom-W, as they are likely to carry Trick, which will cripple Sylveon and prevent it from setting up. It's better for Sylveon to switch in on predicted non-damaging moves, a Dragon-type attack, or after a teammate has fainted, because it cannot afford to risk taking any damage. If Sylveon has a couple of Calm Minds set up and Chesto Berry is gone, it's best to continue using Snore because it's Sylveon's only attacking option while asleep and can surprise the opponent. Calm Mind is usually a safe option to use when predicting a switch because even if Sylveon stays in on a resisted critical hit or status move, it can easily replenish itself with Rest. Sylveon is better kept for later stages of the match when most of the Steel-types, especially Heatran, have been eliminated.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran is very helpful for switching into Poison- and Steel-type attacks, and Sylveon can handle bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon that trouble Heatran. Mega Lucario is also a great partner, having a Poison-type immunity and the ability to get rid of opposing Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Clefable. Landorus-T and Gyarados can come into predicted Ground-type moves and get an Intimidate off for Sylveon to sponge a physical attack. Additionally, Landorus-T can switch into Electric-type moves such as Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt as well as get rid of troubling Electric-, Poison-, and Steel-types. However, if Landorus-T isn't running Choice Scarf or Assault Vest, it must be wary that some Electric-types carry Hidden Power Ice, such as Mega Manectric, Raikou, and Thundurus. Gyarados on the other hand assists Sylveon by clearing the field of Fire-types such as Talonflame and Heatran; in return, Sylveon can set up on Conkeldurr, one of the Pokemon Mega Gyarados really struggles with. More defensive variants can provide much appreciated Thunder Wave and Rocky Helmet support against physical attackers, giving Sylveon more chances to set up Calm Mind. Similarly, Thunder Wave support from Thundurus is much appreciated. Talonflame can annihilate Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Serperior with its STAB Brave Bird.</p> <p>Latios and Latias are considered good partners for Sylveon because they can deal with Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur. Latias deserves a special mention, as it can paralyze foes with Thunder Wave and provide Sylveon with Healing Wish support, getting rid of any status problems it may have and fully replenishing its health. Also, as Mega Latias, it'll be able to survive a Shadow Ball from Mega Gengar and KO it back with its STAB Psychic-type move. Uncommon Choice Scarf variants of Latios can also be used to deal with Mega Gengar. In return, Sylveon can switch into predicted Dragon-type moves. Ferrothorn appreciates the removal of Fighting-types such as Breloom, Conkeldurr, and Mega Lopunny, while being able to set up Stealth Rock and potentially Thunder Wave a few threats before it goes down, so Sylveon can come in for free. Mamoswine also appreciates the removal of the aforementioned Fighting-types and can set up Stealth Rock, while Sylveon can set up on the defensive Water-types that wall Mamoswine such as non-Trick variants of Rotom-W and Slowbro lacking Calm Mind.</p>"

  "Klefki": {
    "overview": "<p>Klefki may not seem like much, but it has an excellent ability in Prankster and the movepool to take advantage of it! Klefki is most notorious for its use of a Swagger set, which may be the most irritating to face in Pokemon history due to its uncanny ability to hax its way to victory! Swagger isn't all Klefki is good at either, as it has access to other good support moves such as Reflect, Light Screen, and Thunder Wave as well as an excellent typing that gives it key resistances to Poison-, Flying-, Ice-, Normal-, and Dark-type attacks and an immunity to Dragon-types.</p> <p>Klefki's most notorious luck-dependent utility may in fact be its greatest flaw in the long run. Swagger can easily backfire when used against strong, physical switch-ins such as Garchomp and Landorus-T and proves to be fairly ineffective against stall teams due to Klefki's lack of reliable recovery. Klefki's overall stats are fairly mediocre, reducing its niche to prankster support and rolling the dice with Swagger. Because of these flaws, Klefki isn't a particularly reliable Pokemon, so it simply isn't something a trainer can slap onto any team without proper support. Still, it's hard to deny that Klefki's ability to take advantage of luck can make it extremely dangerous to face, so it should never be underestimated.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Klefki gets Switcheroo, which allows it to switch harmful items such as Iron Ball and Flame Orb onto opponents. However, the combination of Iron Ball and Switcheroo is mostly outclassed by Thunder Wave, as the former can only be used once and fails against Mega Evolutions, and Flame Orb's burn actually harms Klefki if it doesn't get rid of it right away. Another interesting support move to consider is Spikes. Spikes may seem appealing due to its ability to rack up damage, but the fast-paced nature of Battle Spot Singles and the prominence of Levitate users and Flying-type Pokemon mean that setting up Spikes is often a wasted turn. Sunny Day and Rain Dance can be interesting for weather teams, but being forced to switch out usually isn't worth it when Mega Charizard Y and Politoed can set up weather with just their ability. Klefki can also use Rest and Sleep Talk to restore health, but Klefki's mediocre bulk usually means it isn't worth the risk. Offensively, Klefki gets Play Rough, which can deal decent damage to Dragon-types. Dazzling Gleam and Flash Cannon are also usable and can get boosted with Calm Mind. In general, though, Klefki is too weak to use these moves well and is better off sticking to Foul Play for offensive pressure.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mega Bounce: Magic Bounce reflects any of Klefki's status moves back at Klefki itself, ruining much of its utility. The most common user if Magic Bounce is Mega Sableye.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt will shut down most of Klefki's movepool, making it liable to get set up on. Thundurus is by far the best choice, being immune to Thunder Wave and having its own Prankster Taunt to shut Klefki down before it can use Swagger. Whimsicott works in a similar fashion, though it must be careful about switching into Thunder Wave. Mega Gengar and Gyarados are also capable users of Taunt, but they must take a Swagger or Thunder Wave before they can Taunt Klefki and are more vulnerable to Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn: Ferrothorn's typing and Speed let it shrug off Klefki's attempts at statusing it, and it can hit Klefki hard with Gyro Ball (especially when boosted by Swagger). It can also wear down Klefki as it uses Foul Play thanks to Rocky Helmet and Iron Barbs.</p> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan</strong>: While Mega Kangaskhan is vulnerable to Foul Play, its Parental Bond Earthquake can hurt Klefki through its Substitute, making it a particularly risky target to give a Swagger boost to.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types are immune to Thunder Wave, and, as long as they don't hit themselves in confusion, they benefit from Swagger's Attack boost, all while slamming Klefki with boosted Earthquakes. Prominent examples of this group include Garchomp, Landorus-T, Mamoswine, and Excadrill.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon: Defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia, Porygon2, Suicune, and Chansey have no problems taking Klefki's Swagger-boosted Foul Plays, allowing them to easily stall it out. However, defensive Pokemon without Rest can get crippled by Toxic variants, and even Rest Pokemon can be defeated by the rare Heal Block Klefki.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-type Pokemon are immune to Thunder Wave and can usually break through Klefki's Substitutes. The most prominent two examples outside of Thundurus are Rotom-W and Rotom-H, but Mega Manectric can be a problem as well.</p> <p><strong>Chandelure: Chandelure is crippled by Thunder Wave and takes massive damage from boosted Foul Plays but is notable for OHKOing Klefki through its Substitute thanks to Infiltrator and STAB Fire-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Most Fire-types such as Heatran, Blaziken, and both of Charizard's Mega Evolutions can OHKO Klefki. However, Blaziken and Charizard despise Thunder Wave and only work as emergency checks.</p> <p><strong>Lum Berry: Surprise Lum Berries from the likes of Garchomp and Dragonite can ruin Klefki's chances at using Swagger and Thunder Wave effectively.</p>",

        "name": "SwagPlay",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swagger, Klefki's main tool of annoyance, confuses the foe while doubling its Attack stat. This has perfect synergy with Foul Play, allowing Klefki to slam its foes hard after the boost! Foul Play also works well against Pokemon that may attempt to set up on Klefki if you are willing to make a risky prediction against foes such as Garchomp. Thunder Wave furthers aids Klefki's ability to cripple Pokemon, being an excellent tool to stop fast sweepers thanks to Prankster, pairing well with Swagger to further increase the chances of preventing your foes from moving!</p> <p>Substitute makes Klefki more difficult to KO and has great synergy with Swagger and Thunder Wave because Klefki often finds itself getting free turns to set it up. It also saves Klefki from Choice Scarf + Trick users such as Rotom-W. Magnet Rise is more situational than Substitute, but its ability to save Klefki from powerful Earthquake users such as Mega Kangaskhan and Garchomp can be very valuable. If you feel Klefki needs to do better against defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia, Porygon2, and Slowbro, Toxic can be used as a surprise move to cripple them. You can even get rid of Thunder Wave if your team needs Klefki to handle itself better against stall. If you choose Toxic over Thunder Wave, consider running Heal Block to prevent Pokemon such as Suicune from using Rest.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers is a key item on this set, as the free turns Klefki often gets as a result of Swagger and paralysis give it ample time to restore much of its health; in addition, it pairs well with Substitute. A Calm nature with maximum investment in HP and Special Defense is preferred, as Klefki's Swagger shenanigans tend to work better on special attackers. Most importantly, this allows Klefki to avoid a 2HKO from all of Mega Gengar's attacks except for a status-boosted Hex. It also lets Klefki better handle Aegislash, which can be defeated by Foul Play if it hits itself in confusion!</p> <p>As an aside, a Bold nature with maximum HP and Defense investment is a reasonable option, as it allows Klefki to survive weaker boosted hits and an unboosted Earthquake from both Mega Kangaskhan and Garchomp when at full health.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to use Substitute whenever possible against threats that can't do much to Klefki, such as Choice item users locked into resisted moves (common examples include Talonflame locked into Brave Bird and Garchomp locked into a Dragon-type attack), Greninja that lack Water-type moves, and Cresselia when Klefki is carrying Toxic. Then, Klefki should use either Swagger or Thunder Wave, depending on whether the opponent's team has a Ground- or Electric-type remaining. Paralysis and confusion together make it likely your opponent won't be able to attack! If Klefki is behind a Substitute or facing an offensive opponent that won't OHKO it after a Swagger boost, use Foul Play to deal serious damage against Pokemon that don't resist it.</p> <p>If your Klefki is running Thunder Wave, choosing whether to use Swagger or Thunder Wave first can be a bit tricky. Using Swagger and then Thunder Wave has a better chance of preventing the foe from moving and tends to work well against special attackers. However, Swagger is riskier against physical switch-ins and allows the foe to switch out without a permanent status effect like paralysis. Thunder Wave can therefore be used as a less risky option first if your opponent prefers to send in physical attackers against Klefki, though Ground- and Electric-type Pokemon can use it as a free switch in.</p> <p>Regardless of which move you choose to use first, use Substitute whenever Klefki gets a free turn from Swagger or paralysis, as this can set Klefki up to decimate offensive teams! Just try to avoid relying too much on the luck factor, because as tempting as it may be to crush an opponent with Klefki's coin flips, Swagger can backfire massively against physical threats if they don't hit themselves in confusion!</p> <p>If you opt to run Toxic Klefki, don't use Toxic the first chance you get. Instead, keep your opponent in the dark about the true nature of your Klefki. Because Klefki tends to attract defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia, Porygon2, and Slowbro, you will want to hit them with Toxic when they least expect it, potentially opening new holes for an offensive teammate to rip through.</p> <p>Finally, pay attention to the Team Preview, because Klefki tends to struggle against Ground-and Electric-types due to their Thunder Wave immunity. If you see Pokemon that Klefki has trouble with, such as Thundurus and Garchomp paired together, consider benching Klefki.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>A special teammate to consider for Klefki is Ditto. Because Ditto's Imposter copies the foe's stat boosts, you can potentially sweep your opponent with their own Pokemon by sacrificing Klefki against a Swagger-boosted physical attacker such as Garchomp! Just ensure that Ditto can OHKO the Pokemon so the strategy won't backfire.</p> <p>Thanks to Prankster and its habit of forcing switches, Klefki is excellent at spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave, making it a good idea to partner it with slower, more powerful Pokemon. Hydreigon and Dragonite are especially good examples due to to their good defensive synergy with Klefki, but other good teammates to consider include Azumarill, Mamoswine, and Conkeldurr. If you're willing to place further emphasis on luck, you can even try to take advantage of paralysis to get more boosts with Moody Glalie.</p> <p>Mega Kangaskhan and Ground-types are a huge problem, as their powerful Earthquakes easily take advantage of and smash Klefki and its Swaggers. Great defensive partners to consider include Cresselia, Porygon2, which also has access to Foul Play to take advantage of Swagger against special attackers, and Slowbro. Gliscor works against Ground-types as well, with the exception of Mamoswine, and Suicune and Rotom-W can work well too despite their lack of reliable recovery. Greninja, while very frail and hard to bring in, can hit Ground-types fairly hard thanks to a Protean-boosted Ice Beam and can hit Mega Kangaskhan hard with Low Kick as well.</p> <p>While Klefki is a great paralysis spreader itself, carrying some extra Pokemon with paralysis moves can be extremely useful, as they allow Klefki to dish out Swagger with less pressure. Great defensive examples include Cresselia, Porygon2, and Rotom-W, while more offensive examples include Thundurus and Serperior, which can actually paralyze Ground-types with Glare.</p> <p>If Klefki is only carrying Thunder Wave, defensive Pokemon such as Suicune, Cresselia, Porygon2, and Slowbro are able to easily stall it out. This makes stallbreakers a great addition to a Klefki core, with prominent examples being Mega Gengar, Swords Dance Mega Charizard X, and Toxic Mega Salamence. Conversely, if Klefki is carrying Toxic (and Heal Block for Suicune), it can turn the tables on its defensive checks and help support sweepers that have trouble against them; good partners for this include Garchomp, Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Salamence, and Blaziken.</p>"

        "name": "Dual Screens",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With Reflect and Light Screen in tow, Klefki becomes an excellent support Pokemon for offensive teams! Klefki's main purpose is to set up screens to let your sweepers set up, but Foul Play is a good deterrent against Pokemon that may attempt to set up on Klefki. Thunder Wave further guards Klefki's team from sweepers by crippling them with paralysis, but Toxic can be used in its place. It might seem strange on a dual screens Pokemon, but Toxic allows Klefki to ruin the ability of walls such as Cresselia, Slowbro, and Porygon2 to last throughout the match. Safeguard can be used to protect your team from status, furthering your sweeper's ability to clean teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Bold nature with maximum HP and Defense EVs is recommended, as this allows Klefki to set up both Reflect and Light Screen against Choice Band Garchomp and lets it avoid a 2HKO from Mega Kangaskhan and Garchomp without offensive items under Reflect.</p> <p>Light Clay is usually the best item for Klefki, as it increases the duration of Reflect and Light Screen from five to eight turns. However, Eject Button is a reasonable option for more fast-paced teams, as it allows Klefki to switch as soon as it gets hit, allowing you to get a surprise set up with your sweeper at the cost of only having one screen up!</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Klefki can be used early in the game to surprise your opponent with Reflect and/or Light Screen (especially if carrying Eject Button), potentially allowing you to deal some serious damage with Klefki's offensive teammates. However, if you use it early-game to set up a sweeper with Klefki's support, make sure there aren't Pokemon on the opposing team that are still hard stops to your Pokemon of choice while it's under Reflect and Light Screen. Klefki can also be used later in the game when you know what Pokemon your opponent has chosen. While this can be a more reliable tactic for setting up a sweep, don't let Klefki linger too long, as this set is completely useless without offensive partners to back it up. Finally, when using Eject Button, make sure not to switch Klefki in on attacks, or you'll waste your surprise!</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>The best Pokemon to pair with Klefki are strong, bulky sweepers that can fully take advantage of Reflect and Light Screen. Mega Charizard X is a particularly good example of this, as it can also use Swords Dance to break through powerful walls that can hinder this tactic such as Cresselia and Suicune. Other bulky sweepers to consider include Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Salamence, Belly Drum Azumarill, and Dragonite. Frailer sweepers such as Blaziken, Talonflame, and Thundurus are also reasonable back up choices. Finally, while Mega Gengar isn't a sweeper, its ability to trap and defeat Cresselia and Slowbro makes it a great teammate for Klefki.</p>"
