        "description": "<p>Ninetales is a niche wallbreaker in the RU tier; with access to Drought and good coverage, it sets up in front of Pokemon such as Registeel, Sylveon, and Roserade, and it can threaten a wide variety of Pokemon including Seismitoad, Metagross, and Steelix. However, it is weak when unboosted and faces competition from Chandelure, Toxtricity, and Volcanion. Solar Beam grants Ninetales a strong coverage option to muscle past bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune. Toxic cripples incoming walls such as Incineroar and Snorlax, and also Noivern. Scorching Sands hits Dragalge, Chandelure, and Incineroar. Choice Specs is a good alternative item, but Choice Specs Ninetales gets worn down by entry hazards quickly and is very prediction-reliant.</p> <p>Despite Ninetales's great power, it has trouble bypassing Snorlax, as it can tank any hit Ninetales dishes out, so Fighting-types such as Cobalion, Mienshao, and Heracross are good teammates. Ninetales in return can help deal with Doublade and bulky Fairy-types such as Galarian Weezing. Ninetales has trouble breaking Dragon-types such as Noivern and Dragalge; Fairy-types such as Togekiss, Sylveon, and Gardevoir deal with Noivern, while bulky Steel-types like Registeel and Metagross can handle both. Choice Scarf Gardevoir is notably an excellent teammate, as it also provides Healing Wish support late-game, whereas Ninetales can blow through bulky Steel-types such as Registeel and Doublade. Knock Off users such as Mienshao and Seismitoad can remove annoying items such as Assault Vest on Reuniclus, Heavy-Duty Boots on Noivern, and Leftovers on Snorlax. Entry hazard setters such as Registeel, Metagross, and Golisopod are great, as they help in wearing down walls. Golisopod is an exceptional partner, as it provides both Knock Off and Spikes support, and it switches into Ground-type moves. Seismitoad sets Stealth Rock and also uses Knock Off. Ninetales can form a semi-sun core with Shiftry, which has good offensive synergy with Ninetales and can provide Knock Off support, although the lack of sun turns can limit the pair's effectiveness.</p> "

Unfortunately, Vileplume can get worn down quickly and is often forced to use its recovery to remain healthy, which gives openings to Pokemon it invites in like Toxtricity and common Flying-types such as Noivern and Crobat. Strength Sap is Vileplumeâ€™s main recovery move and allows it to lower the Attack stat of an opposing physical attacker. Corrosive Gas is used to remove important items such as Leftovers, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Choice items from Pokemon such as Cobalion, Crobat, and Toxtricity. Alternatively, Sleep Powder can be used to put common switch-ins such as Crobat and Noivern to sleep, generating free turns for itself and its teammates. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 144 Def / 112 SpD can be used to avoid a 4HKO from Xurkitree's Thunderbolt. Vileplume is best suited for balance teams that need a check for prominent physical attackers such as Zarude and Mienshao. Due to Vileplume's weakness to Fire-types, bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Milotic can be great teammates. In return, Vileplume can handle offensive Electric-types such as Xurkitree and Raikou.

Registeel and Steelix also make great teammates for Vileplume, since they are able to check offensive Psychic-types such as Gardevoir and Necrozma. Since Vileplume often switches into pivots, taking damage from entry hazards can quickly wear it down and limit its defensive capabilities, so entry hazard removal from Togekiss or Crobat is important.</p> "

It also takes advantage of teams relying on Seismitoad and Gastrodon as their bulky Water-type, as neither is a suitable Cloyster check. Rock Blast hits Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune neutrally, helping Cloyster beat them with flinches. It also hits Volcanion and can be used against other Fire-types like Incineroar and Chandelure. Hydro Pump is the preferred last move due to its greater damage against Steel-types such as Metagross, Cobalion, and Steelix. Liquidation can be used instead to OHKO Diancie and potentially 2HKO Registeel after Spikes damage while also giving Cloyster a more reliable Water-type STAB move. However, it makes Cloyster more reliant on breaking past the aforementioned Steel-types with flinches. King's Rock gives Cloyster's Icicle Spear and Rock Blast an effective 41% flinch chance. A Naive or Jolly nature should be used, as they allow +2 Cloyster to outrun Choice Scarf Mienshao. Explosion can be used to take down Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune for a teammate. Focus Sash can be used to almost guarantee setup, but this requires solid entry hazard removal, and Cloyster loses out on the ability to break past its checks with flinches. Life Orb is another item option that allows Cloyster to KO notable threats such as Cobalion, Galarian Weezing, Metagross, and Doublade at +2 without prior residual damage. Spikes allows Cloyster, which beats most Defoggers, to give value to its team in a matchup where it doesn't do much else. However, Spikes also forces Cloyster to ditch its Water-type STAB moves, which worsens its matchup against Steel-types significantly.</p> <p>Cloyster's natural physical bulk is impressive even without investment and gives it some notable setup opportunities against Pokemon such as Darmanitan, Crobat lacking Taunt, and Mimikyu. Cloyster is potentially capable of breaking past its defensive answers with flinches, but this requires a fair bit of luck. Bulky Water- and Steel-types can halt Cloyster barring an ill-timed flinch, so efforts should be put into wearing these Pokemon down. Most of the tier's bulky Steel-types will get worn down by Spikes; offensive Metagross, Cobalion, and Doublade will be in KO range of +2 Hydro Pump after switching in with three layers of Spikes, while Liquidation variants will be able to reliably 2HKO Registeel after two layers. Therefore, Spikes setters like Klefki and Roserade are good teammates. Cloyster's ability to take advantage of Spikes and cause its targets to flinch makes it a great choice for hyper offense teams, as it can be a devastating wincon or a supportive wallbreaker for another sweeping teammate such as Necrozma, Mimikyu, or Polteageist. Cloyster is also capable of sweeping on standard offensive and bulky offensive teams. Teams utilizing Cloyster in this regard should attempt to wear down bulky Water- and Steel-types. Knock Off from the likes of Incineroar, Reuniclus, and Obstagoon can remove Leftovers from Pokemon like Registeel and Suicune, making it easier for Cloyster to break through them. Pivoting teammates, such as Mienshao, Incineroar, and Crobat, can get Cloyster into battle safely. Toxic from Diancie and Salazzle can help wear down Water-types to let Cloyster go wild late-game.</p> "

Roserade checks Water-types, Golisopod checks Ground-types like Flygon, and both provide Spikes support. In general, Alolan Marowak appreciates bulky teammates like Togekiss, Seismitoad, and Steelix, since it's easily revenge killed by many Pokemon due to its low base Speed and common weaknesses. Wish support from Togekiss and Sylveon helps Alolan Marowak to stay healthy.

Galarian Weezing's mediocre special bulk, lack of consistent recovery, and general passivity make it harder to support and fit on teams than its Fairy-type competition of Togekiss and Sylveon. Sludge Bomb is preferred over Sludge Wave for its higher chance of poisoning. Galarian Weezing can be used as a Defogger, though it dislikes Stealth Rock setters such as Necrozma, Cobalion, and Rhyperior. Toxic Spikes can be useful for crippling Pokemon such as Seismitoad, Milotic, and Diancie, but it's matchup-dependent due to the prevalence of Heavy-Duty Boots and the large amount of viable Poison- and Steel-types such as Roserade, Toxtricity, Cobalion, and Metagross. Pain Split gives Galarian Weezing a form of recovery, albeit an unreliable one. Will-O-Wisp burns threats such as Cobalion, Mienshao, and Cloyster. Corrosive Gas can be used to remove items from the likes of Seismitoad, Registeel, and Chandelure. Rest is a viable option on stall teams, but stall is a rather unreliable playstyle as a whole. Black Sludge is preferred to give Galarian Weezing more survivability. Rocky Helmet can be used to force more damage onto the likes of Zarude and Mienshao, but should only be used with dedicated Wish support.

Registeel and Porygon2 also appreciate Galarian Weezing switching into threatening Fighting-types. Zarude is capable of checking Psychic-types such as Starmie and Reuniclus as well as Ground-types such as Rhyperior and Golurk. Options such as Seismitoad, Suicune, and Volcanion are capable of taking on offensive Steel-types such as Cobalion and Metagross. Volcanion is also a capable Defogger, freeing up Galarian Weezing to run other moves, most notably Pain Split. Every Electric-type in the tier forces Galarian Weezing out, leading to  free uses of Volt Switch. Seismitoad, Gastrodon, Rhyperior, and Steelix are viable Ground-type partners as a result. Wish passing from the likes of Umbreon is useful and practically mandatory on stall, as Galarian Weezing lacks reliable recovery. Variants running Toxic Spikes can be supported by bulky Calm Mind sweepers like Suicune. Threats to Poison-types such as Necrozma, Gardevoir, and Alolan Marowak are important on such teams.</p> "

However, outside of setting rain, Politoed is a generally underwhelming Pokemon that canâ€™t provide much help to rain teams itself and often becomes a momentum sink due to its passiveness. Encore allows it to deal with bulkier threats that would wall it otherwise and discourage Pokemon from setting up on it. Toxic can break down walls in tandem with Encore, particularly bulky Water-types that pose a threat to rain teams like Seismitoad. Hypnosis trades some effectiveness against passive builds for the potential to shut down common roadblocks to rain teams like Gastrodon and Milotic, and maintain utility against more offensive teams looking to take advantage of Politoedâ€™s passivity. Ice Beam chips Grass-types like Celebi, 3HKOes Dragalge, and OHKOes Noivern with the Special Attack investment. Perish Song forces bulky setup sweepers out, allowing Politoed to check Pokemon like Suicune, Snorlax, and Reuniclus. Finally, Rest allows Politoed to continue setting rain when severely weakened and in long matches against passive teams. Non-Ice Beam variants can invest the 76 Special Attack EVs into Defense, as they do nothing significant with Scald. 56 Speed EVs let Politoed outrun Alolan Marowak, but 92 Speed EVs can be ran for Milotic, which Encore + Toxic variants can beat.</p> <p>Politoedâ€™s only niche is setting rain, so Pokemon that take advantage of it are necessary.

Electric-types of your own like Raikou and Heliolisk are able to run Thunder and Weather Ball as coverage and check Electric- or Water-types. Tornadus also enjoys fully accurate Hurricane and Weather Ball coverage. Toxicroak appreciates the Dry Skin recovery and can switch into Milotic with impunity. Steel-types like Metagross and Steelix can provide good defensive utility for rain teams. Finally, entry hazard setters such as Klefki and Roserade can help pressure bulkier cores that threaten rain such as Suicune + Assault Vest Reuniclus, as well as synergizing with the surprising amount of switches Politoed can force from defensive Pokemon.</p> "

Protect allows Umbreon to safely recover with Wish and scout opposing Choice item Pokemon.

Foul Play is Umbreon's most reliable offensive move and helps it to better deal with physical attackers such as Metagross, Alolan Marowak, and Crobat. The given EVs coupled with a Calm nature allow Umbreon to check special attackers more effectively. Leftovers gives Umbreon passive recovery and works nicely with Protect.

        "description": "<p>Porygon2 is one of the tier's better defensive pivots thanks to its great support movepool, Eviolite-boosted bulk, and amazing ability. Teleport allows Porygon2 to reliably get in powerful wallbreakers while sparing them from taking direct damage. Ice Beam is generally the preferred attacking move because it OHKOes Noivern and Flygon, while also 2HKOing Roserade and Golurk. Tri Attack is a decent alternative that does more to the likes of Xurkitree, Raikou, and Toxtricity. Toxic cripples the likes of Milotic, Volcanion, and Raikou, mitigating their long-term impact against Porygon2's teammates. Foul Play is an attacking option to hit Metagross and Alolan Marowak, while also letting Porygon2 check Polteageist much easier. A specially defensive spread allows Eviolite Porygon2 to blanket check many dangerous special attackers, such as Xurkitree, Toxtricity, and Roserade. Some Defense investment can be used to make Porygon2 a better pivot into the likes of Dhelmise and Flygon should its team need it. Trace allows Porygon2 to copy great abilities, like Regenerator from Reuniclus and Punk Rock from Toxtricity.</p> <p>Porygon2 pairs very well with most offensive Pokemon, as it's able to absorb damage and switch them in safely with Teleport. Toxtricity, Darmanitan, Mienshao, and Heracross are powerful wallbreakers that enjoy having Porygon2 to fall back on when they're forced out by certain special attackers, such as Noivern. A pivoting core can also be powerful, especially with the likes of Mienshao, Incineroar, and Raikou, as it can keep Porygon2 in favorable situations. Incineroar deserves special mention because Intimidate helps it to stomach physical attacks for Porygon2, though it doesn't appreciate Knock Off removing its Heavy-Duty Boots. Togekiss and Galarian Weezing are great checks to Fighting-types while Porygon2 can easily handle most Toxtricity variants and other Electric types. Togekiss can even provide Defog and Heal Bell support, while Galarian Weezing can handle most Knock Off users. Powerful physical attackers such as Heracross, Darmanitan, Alolan Marowak, and Swords Dance Cobalion can take advantage of Porygon2's inability to generally threaten them. The aforementioned Togekiss and Galarian Weezing fare well against Heracross, while Suicune and Milotic can take on Darmanitan and Alolan Marowak. Healthy Noivern can switch directly into Cobalion and any Noivern can outspeed Heracross and Alolan-Marowak should Porygon2 predict their switch in with Teleport.</p> "

Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to the current SS RU metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Raikou is an amazing pivot and sweeper in the RU tier, being one of the fastest Pokemon and having great power and coverage. It can pivot easily with Volt Switch while pressuring many Electric-immune Pokemon that may try to block it. Its decent bulk lets it take some hits to offensively check foes or set up more easily. Its typing and movepool also make it a good offensive check to most Flying- and Water-types as well as some Electric-types, including Togekiss, Suicune, Milotic, and Xurkitree. Raikou has to compete with other Electric-type Pokemon such as Xurkitree and Toxtricity as both a pivot and a wallbreaker, however. It has no moves to hit Seismitoad and Gastrodon, and it has a hard time breaking through some Electric-resistant Pokemon such as Roserade and Dragalge. It also struggles to beat bulky special walls such as Umbreon and Registeel, and it lacks the power to KO most threats without boosts or some prior damage.</p> ",

Raikou can use Choice Specs or Choice Scarf to act more as a wallbreaker or a revenge killer; however, Heavy-Duty Boots is generally better, as it allows Raikou to switch its moves and keep itself healthy more easily throughout the match. Raikou can be used on rain teams alongside Politoed as a good Electric-type check, and it can use Thunder as its main STAB move and Weather Ball over Scald on these teams.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Seismitoad and Gastrodon: Raikou doesn't have any coverage to threaten Water / Ground types such as Seismitoad and Gastrodon, although they have to be careful with Toxic, especially Seismitoad, as it lacks any form of reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Umbreon, Porygon2, and Registeel don't fear much from Raikou, as they take little damage from its moves, but they have to be careful of Volt Switch constantly chipping them throughout the match. Porygon2 is also susceptible to Toxic and can be used as setup fodder by Calm Mind + Substitute Raikou.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types such as Regidrago and Dragalge tank Raikou's attacks easily and can deal a lot of damage in return with their STAB moves, though Dragalge has to be careful of potential Extrasensory.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Some Poison-types, such as Vileplume and Roserade, take little damage from Raikou, as they have good Special Defense, resist most of its coverage, and are immune to Toxic. Toxtricity also resists most of Raikou's attacks, and it has sound moves to bypass a potential Substitute, but it takes much more damage from Raikou due to its mediocre defensive stats. The uncommon Extrasensory Raikou can do more damage to them.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Despite Raikou's high Speed and overall good bulk, some revenge killers can outspeed and beat it. Choice Scarf Darmanitan and Choice Scarf Tyrantrum can OHKO Raikou, whereas Choice Scarf Mienshao and Choice Scarf Heracross can OHKO it after little damage. They have to be careful with Substitute, although Mienshao and Darmanitan can use U-turn to break it. Noivern with Draco Meteor can revenge kill a weakened Raikou, even through Substitute thanks to Infiltrator, and it can take a hit from Raikou if needed.</p> ",

Sacred Fire is Entei's best STAB move due to its great Base Power, no drawback unlike Flare Blitz, and especially high burn chance. Extreme Speed allows Entei to revenge kill weakened faster threats such as Raikou, Starmie, and Sharpedo. Stone Edge deals heavy damage to Fire-types such as Chandelure, Incineroar, and Volcanion, which take Entei's STAB moves well. It is also Entei's best move for Water-types and OHKOes Noivern. The slightly higher Base Power of Flare Blitz allows Entei to OHKO Registeel and Raikou as well as consistently 2HKO Reuniclus and specially defensive Porygon2. Stomping Tantrum can be used over Flare Blitz to 2HKO Dragalge, Tyrantrum, and Diancie as well as hitting Rhyperior for more damage. A Jolly nature is necessary to outspeed Obstagoon, Darmanitan, Indeedee, and Mimikyu. Inner Focus prevents Incineroar from lowering Entei's Attack stat with Intimidate.</p> <p>Entei's best counters are bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Suicune, and Seismitoad. As a result, a strong Grass-type or Electric-type like Dhelmise, Roserade, Toxtricity, or Xurkitree is extremely important as a teammate. These four examples are also able to threaten or wear down bulky Rock-types like Diancie and Gigalith, which are huge threats to Entei too, especially if Entei lacks Stomping Tantrum. In return, Entei can threaten their counters such as Registeel for Roserade's case or Crobat for Dhelmise. A Fighting-type such as Cobalion or Mienshao can help Entei with bulky Rock-types as well as Curse Snorlax. These two can also bring Entei safely on the field via U-Turn or Volt Switch. In general, Entei appreciates VoltTurn support a lot. Entei is easily revenge killed by other Pokemon once it's locked into a move, so a defensive backbone provided by bulky PokÃ©mon like Seismitoad, Stakataka, and Assault Vest Reuniclus is helpful. An entry hazard remover like Noivern, Crobat, and Starmie is crucial due to Entei's weakness to Stealth Rock. Speaking of hazards, Entei appreciates Spikes or Toxic Spikes setters such as Roserade, Golisopod, Galarian Weezing and Dragalge alongside the usual Stealth Rock, because they support Entei in wearing down its counters as well as general wallbreaking. Lastly, although Entei is a decent late-game cleaner due to its strong Extreme Speed, a more reliable one like Choice Scarf Heracross, Calm Mind Raikou, or Shift Gear Toxtricity is a solid partner too.</p> "

Calm Mind makes it very hard for special attackers to break Suicune's Substitute and makes Scald much harder to switch into. Substitute provides Suicune with a way to protect itself from status effects, which will cripple sets lacking Rest, and is especially effective for PP stalling Pokemon unable to break its substitute in one hit. Note that Suicune must still be cautious not to switch into status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave from the likes of Registeel, Togekiss, and Klefki. Protect enables Suicune to scout Choice item users, stall out low PP moves, and gain additional Leftovers recovery. Ice Beam can be used to hit the likes of Zarude and Seismitoad after boosting, which are otherwise major threats. Roar is another option that allows Suicune to phaze out other setup sweepers and rack up entry hazard damage. The EV spread allows Suicune to outpace base 80 Speed Pokemon like Chandelure and Togekiss, while giving it an 81% chance that Seismitoad's Earthquake will not break its Substitute. An alternative spread with maximum Speed will allow Suicune to Speed tie with Heracross, but lowers its chances of its Substitute surviving Seismitoad's Earthquake to about 56%. This set lacks recovery other than Leftovers, so Suicune must be careful not to take Knock Off from Pokemon like Incineroar and Obstagoon without a Substitute up. Suicune must also be careful not to get hit by Trick from the likes of Darmanitan and Gardevoir, as it completely cripples this set.</p> <p>Suicune's natural bulk and typing make it a great choice for teams looking to check threats like Darmanitan, Alolan Marowak, and Metagross. Suicune's best check is Zarude, which can use Jungle Healing to remove any Scald burns and threaten Suicune with Power Whip. Therefore, it pairs well with Zarude checks like Cobalion, Galarian Weezing, and Togekiss. Cobalion has the added bonus of being an excellent Knock Off absorber thanks to Justified, while Galarian Weezing and Togekiss check other threats to Suicune like certain Guts Fighting-types such as Machamp and Heracross. The aforementioned Guts users, along with Obstagoon, pose a notable threat to Suicune because they are powerful enough to threaten Suicune and unafraid of burns from Scald. Sylveon or Togekiss notably can provide Heal Bell support to remedy this set's weakness to status effects. Suicune is also threatened by Electric-types like Xurkitree, Toxtricity, and Raikou, so it should be used alongside Electric-type checks such as Roserade, Assault Vest Reuniclus, Zarude, and Vileplume. Finally, Suicune lacking Roar is unable to beat certain Calm Mind sweepers with Psyshock like Reuniclus and Sigilyph, so it is wise to pair it with checks to them like Obstagoon and Chandelure.</p> "

It also gives Gardevoir an excellent matchup against weather teams, as it can copy the Speed boosting abilities from the weather sweepers and revenge kill them as a result.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Gardevoir is a very good partner for powerful wallbreakers that are prone to being worn down throughout the course of a match. Alolan Marowak, Reckless variants of Mienshao, and Chandelure are all powerful wallbreakers that get worn down by entry hazards and can be crippled by assorted status moves. Healing Wish can heal these Pokemon back to full; many teams are not equipped to deal with these dangerous Pokemon getting what is essentially an extra life. These wallbreakers, as well as others such as Heracross and Bewear, all threaten the Steel-types that might prevent Gardevoir from cleaning late-game. Gardevoir can further help these Pokemon out by revenge killing threats to them, such as Zarude, Obstagoon, and Toxtricity. Pivots such as Noivern, Mienshao, Darmanitan, and Zarude can help Gardevoir to get into battle safely. Gardevoir is rather slow for a Choice Scarf user, so it can't revenge kill most other Choice Scarf users in the tier. Having defensive answers to Choice Scarf users such as Heracross, Xurkitree, and Darmanitan is therefore useful. Heracross can be hindered with Flying-types such as Togekiss and Crobat, Xurkitree can be pressured via Ground-types like Steelix and Seismitoad or Electric-types such as Raikou, and Darmanitan is annoyed by Water-types like Suicune, Milotic, Volcanion, and Seismitoad. A user of strong priority, such as Golisopod, can also help remedy this issue.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Ninjask is a niche option usable as an offensive pivot with its amazing Speed and access to STAB U-turn, being able to revenge kill most threats on offense and provide free switches to wallbreakers against bulkier teams. However, due to its mediocre base Attack, horrible bulk, lack of coverage options, and underwhelming STAB combination, Ninjask needs a lot of team support for it to work, as it is very easily checked. Its typing does, however, allow it to switch into some Grass-, Fighting-, and Ground-type moves if necessary, but most of the time it risks being hit by any coverage move, which will deal a significant amount of damage. Swords Dance allows Ninjask to be a late-game cleaner and Protect allows it to safely increase its Speed with Speed Boost and outspeed everything in the tier, including Choice Scarf users such as Mienshao and Flygon, as well as Jolly Barraskewda. 156 EVs on Speed allow Ninjask to outspeed Choice Scarf Metagross and 130 base Speed Pokemon such as Crobat and Aerodactyl. A spread with 44 HP / 252 Atk / 212 Spe can be used to outspeed Jolly Barraskewda without needing to use Protect at the cost of some bulk.</p> <p>Wallbreakers like Mienshao, Golurk, and Salazzle love Ninjask's capacity to lure in and use U-turn to pivot out of Steel-types. Other offensive pivots help Ninjask pressure the opponent, such as Raikou, Flygon, Noivern, and Mienshao, while defensive pivots such as Incineroar, Porygon2, and Milotic can switch into Ninjask's checks and use their slow pivoting moves to give Ninjask more opportunities to come in. Entry hazard support helps Ninjask weaken the opposing team, which it needs due to its poor coverage. Seismitoad, Cobalion, and Stakataka are good Stealth Rock setters; Cobalion is also able to use Volt Switch to carry momentum and safely bring in Ninjask. Golisopod and Roserade can set Spikes for it, and Golisopod also has Knock Off to remove Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots from Ninjask's checks. Roserade, on the other hand, helps deal with Electric- and Water-types that can be an issue for Ninjask.</p> "

Close Combat covers threats such as Zarude, Cobalion, and Registeel. Protect is needed to activate Speed Boost safely. It also foils attempts by Golisopod to KO Sharpedo with First Impression. Waterfall is preferred over Liquidation, because Liquidation does not achieve any notable KOs that Waterfall doesn't, and the flinch chance is largely more useful than Liquidation's chance to drop Defense given Sharpedo's need to avoid taking damage at all costs. A Life Orb is required to give Sharpedo maximum damage output while still allowing it to switch moves. An Adamant nature also helps Sharpedo hit as hard as possible, but it does mean that +1 Sharpedo is outrun by Choice Scarf Heracross and Choice Scarf Xurkitree, so these threats should be accounted for before committing to a Sharpedo sweep.</p> <p>Sharpedo is best utilized with entry hazard stacking offense or hyper offense teams that can chip down the opposition as much as possible before Sharpedo attempts a sweep. Sharpedo's extreme frailty means that it should ideally OHKO everything it faces, lest it get OHKOed in return. Stealth Rock setters such as Metagross, Rhyperior, and Cobalion are good partners as a result. Spikes is also quite useful for accumulating even more chip damage, so setters such as Klefki, Roserade, and Golisopod work well with Sharpedo. Knock Off support can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from annoying Pokemon such as Zarude and Togekiss, letting them get chipped into Sharpedo KO range. Employing users of the move, such as Salazzle, Mienshao, and Incineroar can work wonders as a result. Completely removing users of strong priority that revenge kills Sharpedo, such as Golisopod, is mandatory. Sharpedo can work on hyper offense teams to apply a ton of offensive pressure in conjunction with other powerful teammates. Options such as Necrozma, Mimikyu, Polteageist, and Toxtricity are all nice choices for hyper offense teams looking to keep the pressure on. Pivoting teammates such as Mienshao, Toxtricity, and Zarude can use their pivoting moves to get Sharpedo in safely, which is important given its extreme frailty.</p> "

Togekiss, Seismitoad, Chople Berry Cobalion, bulky Metagross, Steelix, Galarian Weezing, and Doublade are all examples of Pokemon that mixed Sharpedo matches up significantly better against. Dark Pulse is preferred to guarantee OHKOs onto the likes of Metagross and Doublade. It also has a chance to put Golisopod into Emergency Exit range. Crunch can be used, however, as it hits Assault Vest Reuniclus harder. Close Combat is necessary to hit Zarude and Registeel hard, though both must be chipped down before they are outright KOed by the move. Protect allows Sharpedo to accrue Speed boosts, therefore making it easier for it to sweep, while also preventing Golisopod from revenge killing it with First Impression. Ice Beam can be used to OHKO Noivern and 2HKO Togekiss without having to rely on the inaccurate Hydro Pump, but it is hard to fit on the moveset. Maximum Special Attack EVs are preferred for the best KO odds on Galarian Weezing, Togekiss, and Doublade.</p> <p>Sharpedo can be employed on entry hazard stacking offense and hyper offense teams that are in need of a late-game option. Sharpedo needs to have the opposition chipped down before it attempts to sweep, so Stealth Rock and Spikes setters are fantastic teammates. Stealth Rock can be set by partners such as Metagross, Cobalion, and Seismitoad, while Spikes from the likes of Klefki and Roserade is important. Mixed Sharpedo doesn't match up quite as well against a few common threats, most notably Zarude but also Registeel and Umbreon. Employing methods of chipping these threats down specifically is recommended. Knock Off from the likes of Incineroar, Seismitoad, and Heracross is crippling, especially to the former two, and hazards can help wear these threats down, therefore giving Sharpedo an easier time busting past them. Pivoting Fighting-types, most notably Mienshao, can force these threats to switch around constantly, therefore also keeping up the pressure and wearing them down into Sharpedo KO range. Knock Off is also generally nice to have on your side, as it makes wearing down threats such as Togekiss and Noivern much easier.</p> "

Its access to Stealth Rock provides all-important role compression for these teams and is one of the big reasons Torkoal is preferred over Ninetales. Yawn forces the opponent to switch Pokemon or give one of Torkoal's offensive teammates a free switch in. Toxic is an alternative option, as it puts bulky Water-types, such as Milotic and Seismitoad, on timers and gives Torkoal an edge against the rare Politoed in a weather war. Body Press works off of Torkoal's high Defense stat to significantly threaten the likes of Porygon2, Snorlax, and Incineroar. Heat Rock should always be used to maximize the amount of turns Sun is active for Torkoal's teammates. Rapid Spin looks appealing, but it's generally better to just let a teammate deal with entry hazards, with Torkoal being weak to Stealth Rock and thus easy to pressure. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 176 Def / 84 Spe can be used in order to outspeed Steelix. Although rare, this can prevent weakened Steelix from getting Stealth Rock up against Torkoal before fainting to Lava Plume.</p> <p>Powerful sun threats are the best partners to take advantage of the support Torkoal provides. Shiftry is a prominent Chlorophyll sweeper that can mow down opposing teams with its boosted Speed and high-powered attacks. Charizard and Darmanitan are powerful Fire-types that become even more challenging to switch into when their STAB moves are backed by sun. Xatu and Klefki are worthwhile support options to ensure entry hazards are not a problem for Torkoal. Both can also manually set sun via Sunny Day in order to relieve some pressure on Torkoal. Heliolisk is a unique sun attacker by virtue of its type and can utilize the sun to slot in Weather Ball to reliably crush Steel-types like Registeel and Steelix. Although rare, Politoed is a rather troublesome opposing weather setter that Torkoal can only threaten with Toxic or repeated use of Body Press. Noivern enjoys having its Flamethrowers boosted by Torkoal's sun, can use Defog to keep the field clear of entry hazards, and reliably check Politoed throughout a game.</p> "

It also has useful Rock and Fire resistances, a Ground immunity, and exceptional resilience to entry hazards. U-turn allows Flygon to gain momentum and potentially force big damage onto Zarude. Stone Edge pressures Togekiss and 2HKOes Noivern, Crobat, and Tornadus without having to lock into Outrage. Outrage gives Flygon a means to clean late-game and more power against threats such as Noivern, Heracross, and Gastrodon. Toxic catches Togekiss, as it is usually not 2HKOed by Stone Edge. It also forces damage onto threats that handle Flygon's attacks well, such as Seismitoad, Porygon2, and Dhelmise. Defog can be used if the role compression is needed, but inability to catch anything with Toxic forces Flygon to use U-turn much more often. 20 Special Defense EVs allow Flygon to take Dazzling Gleam from Xurkitree once in a pinch.</p> <p>Flygon's role compression and utility makes it suited for use on balance and offensive teams, as they appreciate having a check to Electric-types and a Choice Scarf user into one slot.

This is thanks to a great combination of mixed defenses, good movepool, decent Speed as a defensive Pokemon, and an ability that actually gives it a benefit from being hit by status moves. Flip Turn even allows Milotic to be used on faster-paced teams, as it becomes a bulky Pokemon that can actually build or maintain momentum. Milotic's ability to check powerful threats like Darmanitan, Rhyperior, Noivern, and Metagross is very welcome on many teams. However, Milotic finds itself in a tier where Electric- and Grass-types, such as Raikou, Toxtricity, Zarude, and Roserade, are incredibly potent. While Milotic's ability to take hits of all kinds is relatively uncommon for defensive Pokemon, it does mean that extremely powerful wallbreakers, such as Indeedee and Heracross, can use their powerful STAB moves to brute force their way past Milotic.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Competitive set can be a Defog deterrent on Spikes stacking teams, as the common Defoggers do not generally fare well against a Milotic with boosted Ice Beam. Marvel Scale might make Flame Orb strategies look appealing, but the constant chip damage forces Milotic to use Recover way too often.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: RU is not short on Electric-types, and all of them can simply push past Milotic's defenses with powerful STAB moves. Raikou and Xurkitree aren't scared of Scald nor hindered too badly by a potential Toxic, as they rarely stay in long. Toxtricity is more vulnerable to Flip Turns as it switches in due to its much lower Speed, but similarly threatens out Milotic if it safely switches in and is immune to Toxic. Heliolisk, though much less common than the others, is perhaps the worst enemy of Milotic thanks to Dry Skin even cutting off Milotic's ability to pivot out with Flip Turn as Heliolisk switches in.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Zarude and Roserade might be the only common Grass-types, but they easily handle Milotic. Zarude's Jungle Healing can make Toxic and Scald burns a non-factor for it, while Roserade's Natural Cure and secondary Poison typing work similarly. Both can utilize their powerful Grass-type STAB moves to eliminate Milotic. To make matters worse, Zarude can maintain momentum with U-turn on a forced switch out, while Roserade can litter the field with Spikes to undermine Milotic's bulk later on.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Milotic's good but not spectacular mixed bulk means that very powerful wallbreakers can push past it. Choice Specs Indeedee, Guts Heracross, Obstagoon, and Nasty Plot Togekiss are all strong enough to overcome Milotic with powerful neutral STAB moves, though Milotic can outspeed Dragalge and chip it with Flip Turn on the way out.</p> ",

Flip Turn generally is preferred to generate and maintain momentum as a defensive Pokemon, something that is generally uncommon. This is especially helpful on faster-paced teams that would rather have Milotic stay a step ahead of threats like Raikou and Zarude. Ice Beam prevents Grass-types from switching into Milotic as freely, outdamaging Jungle Healing on Zarude and discouraging Roserade from using Spikes. It also OHKOs Noivern. Toxic is able to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Seismitoad, which can help Milotic's more offensive teammates push past them. It also is great for chipping away at common switch-ins like Raikou and Xurkitree. Haze is a great alternative that allows Milotic to stall out Substitute + Protect variants of Suicune lacking Toxic as well as prevent Calm Mind Reuniclus from taking advantage of Milotic's low damage output. On more defensive teams, Haze is a solid option over Flip Turn or Ice Beam, as these teams generally don't care as much about momentum as they do about covering as many offensive threats as possible. Milotic's 48 Speed EVs enable it to outpace Adamant Golurk.</p> <p>As Milotic is a defensive Pokemon that can maintain momentum, it can work on faster-paced teams that appreciate having it as a defensive backbone when they're forced out by certain Pokemon. Durant is a powerful wallbreaker that appreciates Milotic's slow Flip Turn allotting them more opportunities to switch in. Durant enjoys feasting on the likes of Zarude and Roserade. Toxtricity and Raikou are powerful Electric-types that can threaten the majority of the tier and appreciate Milotic being able to bring them in safely. VoltTurn cores with the likes of Cobalion, Zarude, Mienshao, and Raikou are also powerful on more offensive teams that aim to maintain momentum. Roserade is a great check to most Electric-types, can spare Milotic from Toxic from the likes of Porygon2 and bulky Water-types, and litter the field with Spikes to amplify the effects of Flip Turn. In return, Milotic is able to check offensive Steel-types and multiple Fire-types. Porygon2 is another great slow pivot move user on balance teams that can also run Toxic to allow Milotic to more easily use Haze for the likes of Snorlax and Suicune. Registeel, Togekiss, and Galarian Weezing are great options on slower teams. Registeel is able to set up Stealth Rock, check Indeedee and most Electric- and Grass-types, and appreciates Milotic being able to switch into most Fire- and Ground-types looking to take on Registeel. Galarian Weezing and Togekiss are able to take on the likes of Obstagoon, Zarude, and Heracross for Milotic. Galarian Weezing can even set Toxic Spikes so Milotic doesn't have to waste a turn using Toxic, while Togekiss can use Defog to clear the field of entry hazards, which sometimes force Milotic to use Recover more often than it would like.</p> "

This is supplemented by its great natural bulk, which allows it to also take powerful neutral hits from the likes of Xurkitree and Toxtricity. Registeel also has Stealth Rock, and its ability to annoy common Defoggers like Togekiss and Crobat makes it a good user of the move. Registeel is unfortunately reliant on its Leftovers to stay healthy, which makes Knock Off incredibly threatening to it. Registeel is also rather passive compared to other Steel-types, as it is much more reliant on the likes of Toxic to make progress than its Steel-type competition of Steelix and Metagross. Annoying weaknesses to Fire-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves leaves Registeel open to common Pokemon such as Chandelure, Darmanitan, and Heracross.</p> ",

Additionally, Natural Cure Roserade is one of the best switch-ins to bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune, being able to negate Scald burns.

Grass Knot is an alternative Grass-type STAB move that provides consistent damage against Pokemon such as Stakataka, Suicune, and Raikou. However, it does not provide recovery like Giga Drain and does not have as much damage potential as Leaf Storm.

Psyshock gives Cresselia a better matchup against Calm Mind Raikou and hits Roserade and Dragalge harder. Moonblast hits Dark- and Dragon-types like Obstagoon, Flygon, and Tyrantrum. Moonlight keeps Cresselia healthy throughout the battle. Toxic is used to wear down bulky Pokemon like Seismitoad, Milotic, and Incineroar. Thunder Wave, on the other hand, provides Speed control by slowing down fast threats for Cresselia's teammates. 176 Speed EVs allow Cresselia to outspeed Modest Toxtricity.

    "overview": "<p>Seismitoad is an important defensive Pokemon in RU due to its excellent typing, ability, and utility movepool. Its typing and Water Absorb allow it to deal with threats such as Raikou, Metagross, Darmanitan, and Entei. Seismitoad can also act as a Stealth Rock setter, and it has access to important utility moves in Knock Off and Toxic, allowing it to take advantage of all the free turns it gets. Seismitoad is an incredibly reliable user of Knock Off, and it is able to remove important items from checks such as Togekiss and Zarude. The latter is an important part of VoltTurn teams, allowing Seismitoad to pressure such teams by removing Heavy-Duty Boots. Seismitoad's decent offensive movepool and Swift Swim also make it a key addition to rain teams, where it provides them with an Electric immunity and Stealth Rock while being a threatening sweeper in its own right. However, Seismitoad's quadruple weakness to Grass can lead to problems for it, as the Grass-type Zarude is one of the tier's most ubiquitous Pokemon and doesn't mind most of Seismitoad's attacks, and others such as Roserade and Vileplume can also give it problems. Most viable RU teams carry Grass-types due to their defensive and offensive utility, so this is a major issue. This weakness also prevents Seismitoad from properly using its Electric-immunity in many cases, as Xurkitree carries Grass-type coverage, and another threatening Electric-type in Toxtricity doesn't care much about Seismitoad, as Boomburst does way too much damage for Seismitoad to consider switching into it directly and OHKOes it after just a bit of chip damage. Therefore, Seismitoad is not suitable as a team's only form of counterplay to the tier's Electric-types, necessitating other checks. Seismitoad also lacks reliable recovery outside of Leftovers, meaning that it can get worn down over the course of a match. This is compounded by the fact that Pokemon it otherwise checks often carry pivoting moves or Toxic, such as Darmanitan, Volcanion, and Diancie.</p> ",

Sludge Wave is viable on the rain sweeper set, as it hits Celebi while still pushing damage onto Zarude, but it does significantly less damage to Zarude than Focus Blast. Choice Band variants can be used outside of rain, but such sets tend to be very prediction-reliant and do not effectively utilize Seismitoad's defensive presence.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type coverage: Seismitoad is greatly threatened by the Grass-types of the tier, including Zarude, Roserade, Vileplume, and Celebi.

The core struggles with Steel-, Fire-, and Fighting-types, so checks to these such as Cobalion, RestTalk Suicune, Xatu, and Noivern can hold them off. Entry hazard removal such as Noivern, Togekiss, or Starmie alleviates the Stealth Rock weakness of having two Ice-types.

Regenerator makes Mienshao significantly more difficult to wear down than most other Choice Scarf users, and most of the tier's best Fighting-resistant Pokemon, such Togekiss, Crobat, and Noivern, dislike Knock Off greatly. In addition, common Fighting resistant Pokemon such as Togekiss, Gardevoir, and Noivern can't take its potential coverage moves of Knock Off and Stone Edge. Its ability to force out common Pokemon such as Incineroar, Stakataka, and Cobalion allows it to easily keep momentum with U-turn.

Mienshao's great Speed and offensive utility can also make it a dangerous wallbreaker that is capable of 2HKOing a large majority of the tier. However, Mienshao is quite frail; it can't comfortably take hits from powerful attackers like Xurkitree and Metagross. Mienshao also has annoying weaknesses to Flying-, Fairy-, and Psychic-type moves. Mienshao is capable of threatening most users of said moves with Knock Off or U-turn, but they can become an issue should Mienshao lock into Close Combat. Locking into Close Combat can also give opportunities to dangerous Pokemon such as Necrozma, Golurk, and Calm Mind Reuniclus.

Volcanion keeps up offensive pressure and can spread Toxic to bulky Water-types trying to handle Durant, while Milotic is capable of bringing Durant in via Flip Turn.

The aforementioned two are also able to check Raikou and Xurkitree. Bulky Pokemon such as Milotic, Porygon2, and Assault Vest Reuniclus give Tornadus a reliable defensive backbone, since Tornadus is easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users, such as Noivern, Xurkitree, and Darmanitan. Pivots like Raikou, Porygon2, and Zarude bring Tornadus safely onto the battlefield, and in most cases, against Pokemon it can beat such as Roserade, Cobalion, and Galarian Weezing. Strong late-game sweepers such as Choice Scarf Heracross, Xurkitree, and Sharpedo appreciate Tornadus' ability to weaken opponent's team. Tornadus fits well on rain teams, where Politoed is a necessary teammate. Seismitoad and Kingdra as strong rain sweepers overwhelm bulkier Pokemon alongside Tornadus and Seismitoad is also able to check Electric-types. In return, Tornadus checks bulky Water- and Grass-types. Lastly, Tornadus can also be used on dual screens teams, where the screens support give it more setup opportunities. Klefki has dual screens and Spikes, while Vanilluxe sets up Aurora Veil and allows you to run Arctozolt alongside it as a strong wallbreaker. Other strong setup sweepers such as Linoone, Cloyster, and Necrozma are great choices to overwhelm opposing teams.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Talonflame's niche comes from its Fire resistance, Steel resistance, access to Will-O-Wisp, and ability in Flame Body. Talonflame faces strict competition from Crobat and Noivern as fast Flying-type Pokemon, with Crobat having more useful defensive utility and Noivern being better offensively. However, Talonflame is able to check certain Steel-types such as Metagross, Durant, and Steelix well unlike its Flying-type competition. Talonflame is also able to stave off Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Heracross. Will-O-Wisp allows Talonflame to cripple common Flying-resistant Pokemon such as Diancie and Stakataka, Steel-types like Cobalion and Steelix, and setup sweepers like Swords Dance Doublade and Swords Dance Mimikyu. U-turn is helpful to keep momentum and bring in frailer wallbreakers and other teammates. Flare Blitz and Toxic can be run over Brave Bird and Will-O-Wisp to make Talonflame more immediately threatening to Steel-types and Electric-types; Toxic also makes it harder for Water-types to handle it. However, this leaves it without a move to hit Chandelure and is less threatening to Stakataka. Talonflame has the option to run a Swords Dance set with maximum Attack investment as well as Flare Blitz and Swords Dance over U-turn and Will-O-Wisp, which threatens common Flying-resistant Pokemon like Raikou and Steelix. Swords Dance Talonflame still struggles to break past most bulky Water- and Rock-types and loses immense utility by not having U-turn or Will-O-Wisp, however. 240 Speed EVs let Talonflame outspeed Ribombee. While an offensive EV spread is preferred, Talonflame can alternatively run a physically defensive EV spread of 16 HP / 252 Def / 240 Spe to more reliably check Mienshao, Durant, and Metagross, but it gives up the ability to guarantee a 2HKO on Chandelure.</p> <p>Talonflame cannot do much to the many Rock- and Water-type Pokemon like Diancie, Milotic, and Gastrodon in the tier, so Celebi, Milotic, and Vileplume make good teammates that are able to switch in and threaten these Pokemon. Vileplume and Celebi are especially notable, as they also handle Electric-types that threaten Talonflame like Raikou and Xurkitree. Talonflame's ability to lure in Rock- and Water-types such as Stakataka, Diancie, and Milotic can give free switches to teammates like Golurk, Decidueye, and Virizion thanks to U-turn. Talonflame appreciates cleric support from Diancie, Vileplume, and Sylveon to reliably handle Toxic users such as Metagross and defensive Stakataka. Talonflame isn't a reliable Fighting-type check on its own, so Vileplume and Sylveon make good teammates for it that are able to reliably handle Mienshao. Knock Off can ruin Talonflame by removing its Heavy-Duty Boots, making it vulnerable to Stealth Rock; Knock Off absorbers like Cobalion, Vileplume, and Gastrodon can take Knock Off for Talonflame. Frailer wallbreakers like Life Orb Mienshao and Choice Band Golurk appreciate Talonflame's ability to easily bring them in with U-turn.</p> "

Iron Head allows Pangoro to OHKO Diancie as well as 2HKO defensive Sylveon, bulky Togekiss, and Galarian Weezing. Drain Punch is a more reliable secondary Fighting-type move. However, Bullet Punch gives Pangoro a way to revenge kill weakened faster threats. Scrappy makes Pangoro less prediction reliant, as it prevents Ghost-types from switching into its Fighting-type moves and Incineroar's Intimidate from lowering its Attack stat. Life Orb can be used instead of Choice Band to make Pangoro less prediction reliant. However, it loses some breaking power and misses safe OHKOs on bulky Metagross and Klefki as well as a 2HKO on Galarian Weezing. Additionally, once the opponent is able to switch thanks to correct prediction or a free switch, Pangoro is forced to switch out anyway.</p> <p>VoltTurn support is crucial, since Pangoro is unable to switch directly onto the battlefield due to its mediocre bulk. Electric-types such as Raikou, Toxtricity, and Xurkitree support Pangoro with Volt Switch and check Flying-types like Togekiss and Crobat. Flying-types like Crobat, Noivern, and Talonflame, on the other hand, get Pangoro in safely against Steel- and Rock-types like Steelix, Registeel, and Stakataka through U-turn and check Fighting-types like Mienshao and Heracross. Entry hazard support is helpful because Pangoro can remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off and often forces switches due to its raw power. Stakataka and Diancie can both set Stealth Rock and beat the most common Defog users like Noivern and Togekiss. Steel-types, such as Metagross, Steelix, and Klefki, also set hazards and check Fairy- and Flying-types. Late-game cleaners like Xurkitree, Stakataka, and Calm Mind Raikou benefit from Pangoro breaking through sturdy walls.

Hyper Voice is a great secondary STAB move that hits Grass-types, such as Celebi and Roserade, for solid damage, and prevents Electric-types from easily switching in. Grass Knot OHKOes Seismitoad after Stealth Rock and does respectable damage to Steelix.

Volcanion and Ground-types, such as Golurk, can pummel these special walls with their powerful STAB attacks. Volcanion can utilize Toxic to cripple Porygon2 as well, while Golurk simply uses these special walls as an oppourtunity to severely dent the opposition to help Heliolisk finish off a match with its good natural Speed. Incineroar can check Assault Vest Reuniclus and Darmanitan, appreciates Heliolisk ability to pressure bulky Water-types, and can act as a slow pivot to get Heliolisk in safely.

Thunder Wave serves as a great form of speed control, allowing Klefki to shut down sweepers and cripple the likes of Noivern and Crobat. Toxic in the final slot ensures that Klefki has a way to threaten Ground-type Pokemon like Seismitoad and Electric-type Pokemon like Xurkitree and Raikou, though it is less valuable for faster paced offensive teams, as the gradual poisoning damage doesn't have as many turns to add up. Defog can be used over a status move on teams that need emergency hazard removal; however, Klefki has poor matchups against common hazard setters like Cobalion, Steelix, and Metagross. Foul Play can be used over Toxic in order to give Klefki a way to punish a number of its checks, such as Alolan Marowak, Metagross, and Doublade, as they switch in. Magnet Rise is an option that allows Klefki to continue setting Spikes even against certain Ground-type Pokemon like Seismitoad. A specially defensive EV spread is used to allow Klefki to more easily take hits from the likes of Gardevoir, Togekiss, and Necrozma. 16 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed paralyzed Noivern.</p> <p>Klefki pairs well with offensive threats that benefit from its ability to wear down grounded pokemon with Spikes, like Toxtricity and Raikou. Bulky Water-types like Seismitoad and Suicune make for good partners, helping it deal with the Pokemon like Steelix and Darmanitan that pose the biggest threat to it. It also partners well with Zarude, as it's able to take on and cripple most of the Flying-types that check it with Thunder Wave.  Finally, slower wallbreakers like Heracross, Toxtricity, and Tyrantrum appreciate Klefki's ability to spread paralysis around so they can punch holes through the enemy team.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Noivern provides excellent utility to any team as an offensive pivot or Defogger. Its typing and sky-high Speed tier let it check and revenge kill a vast array of common Pokemon such as Mienshao and Cobalion. Noivern excels as a pivot, providing frequent free switches for wallbreakers while forming potent VoltTurn cores with Xurkitree, Raikou, and Mienshao. As a Defogger, Noivern has some of the better matchups against common entry hazard setters, being able to threaten Cobalion, Steelix, and Roserade but struggling with Stakataka, Diancie, and Registeel. Noivern's defensive utility is greatly diminished by its reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots, as it can't switch in on Pokemon such as Mienshao, Golisopod, and Seismitoad without the risk of getting hit by Knock Off. Furthermore, Noivern's mediocre Special Attack means it barely scratches special walls like Diancie, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Snorlax while also leaving it as setup fodder for Calm Mind Reuniclus and Nasty Plot Togekiss. However, Noivern can circumvent its switch-ins by providing a free switch for powerful wallbreakers with U-turn.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic can cripple common switch-ins to Noivern such as Togekiss, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Diancie. With Toxic, Noivern can also act as a hard stop to Calm Mind + Substitute Suicune thanks to Infiltrator. However, using Toxic means giving up on the great utility provided by U-turn or Defog, which is difficult to justify on most teams. A stallbreaker set with Taunt prevents Cobalion, Seismitoad, and Registeel from setting Stealth Rock and walls like Milotic, Togekiss, and Snorlax from healing. Generally, Hurricane is the preferred STAB option alongside Taunt because it gives better odds of beating Calm Mind Suicune. Switcheroo can be run alongside Choice Scarf to cripple Noivern's switch-ins such as Registeel, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Diancie. Swapping items with bulky set-up Pokemon like Snorlax, Reuniclus, and Suicune neutralizes their attempts at a sweep. Noivern is also the fastest Choice Scarf user in RU and can even outspeed and revenge kill +2 Cloyster. However, Choice Scarf sets are greatly limited by Stealth Rock. Rocky Helmet punishes U-turn pivots like Crobat, Mienshao, and Darmanitan. It can also be used alongside Taunt to always beat Registeel. The big downfall with Rocky Helmet is that it also leaves Noivern vulnerable to Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Diancie, and Togekiss wall Noivern. Diancie is especially troublesome for Defog Noivern because it can freely switch in on the turn Noivern uses Defog and set Stealth Rock again. Choice Scarf Gardevoir can revenge kill Noivern, and Mimikyu can use Defog sets as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls such as Assault Vest Reuniclus, Umbreon, Snorlax, and Porygon2 take very little damage from Noivern's attacks. Reuniclus can set up Future Sight or remove an item with Knock Off, Umbreon gets a free Wish for itself or its teammates, Snorlax sets up Curse, and Porygon2 pivots out with Teleport or cripples something with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf users: Choice Scarf users such as Mienshao, Xurkitree, and Darmanitan can revenge kill Noivern after a slight bit of prior damage. Less common Choice Scarf users such as Tyrantrum and Gardevoir can always OHKO Noivern.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Certain Steel-types like Registeel, Stakataka, and Klefki can take Flamethrower from Noivern multiple times. Klefki can also cripple Noivern with Thunder Wave. Steelix and Cobalion can threaten Noivern on the switch with a Rock-type coverage move in Head Smash or Stone Edge.</p> ",

U-turn takes advantage of Noivern's switch-ins to provide a free switch for its teammates. Noivern can opt for Defog if the team is in need of entry hazard removal. Heavy-Duty Boots is necessary because Noivern is held down by Stealth Rock otherwise. With Infiltrator, Noivern can ignore Substitute from Volcanion and rare Chandelure sets. An alternative EV spread of 212 Def / 44 SpA / 252 Spe trades power for extra bulk to avoid an OHKO from Life Orb Mienshao's Stone Edge.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Heracross, Choice Band Metagross, and Toxtricity appreciate the free switch provided by U-turn and take advantage of common switch-ins to Noivern like Assault Vest Reuniclus, Togekiss, and Diancie.

Noivern does next to nothing to Fairy-types like Togekiss, Sylveon, and Diancie, so Fairy-type answers like Metagross, Steelix, and Registeel are crucial. Pokemon to take advantage of Fairy-types like Roserade, Darmanitan, and Durant are especially appreciated by U-turn Noivern. Fighting- and Ground-types like Heracross, Mienshao, and Seismitoad help deal with bulky Steel-types such as Registeel, Stakataka, and Klefki. Noivern can struggle as a team's sole Fighting-type check due to its weakness to Knock Off. Therefore, Pokemon such as Reuniclus, Vileplume, and Sylveon can handle Fighting-types in place of Noivern.

Diancie can leverage its great matchup against most Defog users, including Crobat and Togekiss, to set Stealth Rock consistently. Diamond Storm's +2 Defense boost can suddenly make Diancie very difficult to KO with physical attacks and empowers Body Press, a key move that allows Diancie to immediately threaten Stakataka and Zarude along with dealing heavy damage to Registeel after a Diamond Storm boost. This Defense boost can also turn the tables on Flygon as Diancie can survive Earthquake with boosted Defense, and then deal massive damage with Body Press. Toxic cripples common switch-ins like Seismitoad and Milotic, while also pressuring Togekiss, the only common Defog user that can reliably stall out Diamond Storm's meager PP. The given spread allows Diancie to check the likes of Xurkitree and Chandelure comfortably. Should another member of its team already be using Stealth Rock, Diancie can opt to run Heal Bell or Protect in that slot instead. Heal Bell can give crucial cleric support for Diancie and its team, while Protect can stall for Leftovers recovery, rack up Toxic damage, and scout potential Choice item users, such as Toxtricity and Metagross, to ease switching into them.</p> <p>Diancie is generally a sitting duck against bulky Water-types, as it can only threaten them with Toxic, so it should have teammates that can switch into them easily. Roserade is particularly notable because it's immune to Toxic, can form an entry hazard-stacking core with Diancie, and can lessen pressure on Diancie to check Raikou and Xurkitree. As Diancie has no reliable recovery of its own, Wish and Heal Bell support from Umbreon can be very beneficial. Diancie is very vulnerable to entry hazards continually chipping away at it as it switches in. Noivern, Volcanion, and Crobat are notable Defog users that appreciate Diancie checking Toxtricity and Xurkitree. Volcanion can even switch into various Water-type moves aimed at Diancie, while Noivern and Crobat are great checks to Roserade and Zarude should Diancie not catch them with an offensive move as they switch in. Despite having Body Press, Diancie greatly appreciates Pokemon that can handle faster Steel-types, particularly Cobalion and Metagross. Bulky Water-types such as Seismitoad and Milotic generally do well against these Pokemon. Seismitoad can run Stealth Rock to free up a moveslot for Diancie or vice versa. Milotic is more vulnerable to Thunder Punch from Metagross, but it also has Recover to sustain itself throughout longer games. Zarude can reliably handle bulky Water-types, and it enjoys having Diancie to fall back on when threatened by faster Flying- and Fire-types.

In particular, its higher Speed stat is what differentiates it from Dhelmise and lets it outspeed the whole unboosted metagame except Jolly Barraskewda after a Rapid Spin. Tsareena's vulnerability to Toxic and difficulty to fit Synthesis make it unable to naturally switch into Electric- and Water-types like Raikou, Xurkitree, and Gastrodon unlike other Grass-types such as Roserade, Vileplume, and Celebi. Knock Off removes crucial items like Heavy-Duty Boots from switch-ins such as Incineroar while not giving away any free switches to Chandelure and Metagross. Triple Axel catches Flying- and Grass-types such as Togekiss, Noivern, and Vileplume on the switch. High Jump Kick, U-turn, and Synthesis are all great options, but without either Knock Off or Triple Axel, Tsareena is left completely vulnerable to common threats like Chandelure and Togekiss.

Roserade is especially a nuisance, as it's a Spikes setter that Tsareena loses to. Pokemon such as Crobat can check Roserade while Seismitoad and Gastrodon help with the latter two.

Its Heavy-Duty Boots set singlehandedly makes Seismitoad and Gastrodon, strong Raikou answers, insufficient for covering the metagame's Electric-types, and other Ground-types like Steelix and Flygon shaky at best. With Ground-types so hesitant to face Xurkitree, it's free to use Volt Switch on switch-ins like Grass-types and special walls, which are rife with weaknesses for teammates to exploit. It's at its strongest against bulkier cores, which often use slower, exploitable Pokemon like Togekiss and Water-types and which struggle to pressure it with passive damage thanks to its Heavy-Duty Boots. While its Speed and bulk aren't great against offensive teams, it can usually find at least one opportunity to threaten them as well, either by forcing a switch or taking a hit. Should its team call for it, it can use Choice Scarf for greater use against offense and potentially cleaning up with Beast Boost at the expense of threatening defensive cores. What generally holds Xurkitree back is its aforementioned bulk and Speed; it can't switch into many direct attacks, and it often has very little breathing room against offense, areas where Raikou beats it out. Its Choice Scarf set suffers from prediction reliance against Ground-types and failing to outspeed other Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Flygon as well as sweepers like Slush Rush Arctozolt, limiting its ability to revenge kill and clean up. If you're looking for raw attacking power, you might prefer Toxtricity, whose Boomburst is easier to spam and much stronger than any of Xurkitree's individual attacks.</p> ",

They're vulnerable to Volt Switch, though, so Xurkitree's team will often stay at an advantage, and Vileplume's and Dhelmise's lower Speed means Xurkitree doesn't even need to predict them.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Bulky Pokemon like Diancie, Registeel, Assault Vest Reuniclus, Porygon2, and Umbreon stand up well to Xurkitree's unboosted attacks but are total Volt Switch fodder. They need Heavy-Duty Boots Xurkitree statused or itemless to win a battle of attrition.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Steelix's Grass neutrality makes it the best Ground-type Xurkitree switch-in, though it quickly loses to repeated Grass Knot or Energy Ball. Flygon can take Dazzling Gleam once with the right EVs. Other Ground-types such as Gastrodon and Seismitoad usually switch out when Xurkitree appears in fear of Grass-type moves but can punish overeager uses of Volt Switch. Any Ground-type is a serious problem for Choice Scarf Xurkitree, creating a cost for locking into Electric-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: With resistance to Electric and neutrality to Grass and Fairy, other Electric-types like Raikou, Toxtricity, and Xurkitree itself make for decent early-game switch-ins to Xurkitree. Only Toxtricity threatens much damage back, however, and none of them are eager to keep losing HP.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority: Offensive teams featuring a lot of fast Pokemon give Heavy-Duty Boots Xurkitree few easy entry points and seldom lose more than one Pokemon to it. Faster Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Heracross can revenge kill weakened Choice Scarf Xurkitree. The same goes for strong priority from the likes of Golisopod and Durant.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Marowak: Lighting Rod Alolan Marowak is unique in that it's immune to Electric and resistant to both Grass and Fairy, making it a major early-game obstacle to Xurkitree, but it's uncommon, very flawed, and fairly easy to wear down.</p> ",

Necrozma can use Autotomize to outrun the whole metagame and use Meteor Beam to boost its Special Attack and pose an extremely deadly threat; however, Meteor Beam needs Power Herb, so Autotomize Necrozma is often preserved to clean up late-game. It's also often forced into mind games against Incineroar, which can bait its Power Herb Meteor Beam, switch out, and wall it afterward. Necrozma's great bulk and power to weaken walls also make it one of the most reliable Stealth Rock setters on offense teams. It threatens most of the common entry hazard removers and setters, including Togekiss, Noivern, and Metagross. Physical sets with Dragon Dance take advantage of common answers to special Necrozma sets like Assault Vest Reuniclus, Stakataka, and Incineroar. With dual screens, Dragon Dance Necrozma can easily set up multiple times and pose a major threat to most teams. Necrozma is often held down by its average Speed; faster threats like Togekiss, Heracross, and Chandelure can deal with it when unboosted, while Choice Scarf users such as Mienshao, Heracross, and Flygon can revenge kill weakened Dragon Dance variants.</p> ",

Calm Mind is another setup option and can be run quite effectively thanks to Necrozma's natural bulk and reliable recovery in Morning Sun, but Necrozma's susceptibility to the common Toxic and Morning Sun's low PP make such sets less desirable compared to Calm Mind Reuniclus.

Its quadruple Normal resistance makes it one of the tier's better ways to take Toxtricity's Boomburst as well. Unfortunately, since Stakataka's the slowest Pokemon in the tier, it's usually getting hit first and worn down easily, and it is forced to make predictions even when other defensive Pokemon are switching in.

Its resistances let it even switch into and punish Cobalion, Roserade, and Raikou once or twice, especially if they go for utility moves. Once Toxtricity has taken some damage, however, it becomes much less of a threat, as its low Speed and bulk will make it easy for many Pokemon to pick off. Its vulnerability to Stealth Rock and Spikes worsens this issue, especially in a metagame full of pivots using Heavy-Duty Boots, which incentivizes conventional offensive teams to forgo entry hazard removal. It faces competition from RU's other top Electric-types, Raikou and Xurkitree; the former's naturally high Speed lets it remain a threat to offense all game long, while the latter can use Choice Scarf to similarly threaten offense or Heavy-Duty Boots to wallbreak like Toxtricity without fearing entry hazards.

Sharpedo and Cloyster are powerful late-game cleaners that benefit from Psychic Terrain protecting them from dangerous priority moves. Pokemon such as Milotic and the aforementioned Mienshao can utilize pivot moves to effectively switch in Indeedee-M on favorable matchups. Sun support from Ninetales is somewhat niche, but the power boost to Mystical Fire is enough to 2HKO Registeel and Bronzong, and Indeedee-M's Psychic Terrain protects Ninetales and common sun Pokemon like Shiftry and Darmanitan from priority moves.</p> "

Mienshao is a  troublesome faster Choice Scarf user that can revenge kill Indeedee-M, thus making Togekiss and Galarian Weezing good teammate options. Togekiss can utilize a Nasty Plot set to weaken or outright remove Steel-types for Indeedee-M, while Galarian Weezing can effectively use Toxic Spikes to wear down Porygon2 and Umbreon. Spikes from Roserade and Klefki is also appreciated, as all of the special walls Indeedee-M struggles with are vulnerable to the entry hazard. Late-game cleaners, such as Sharpedo and Cloyster, that appreciate Psychic Terrain protecting them from opposing priority moves are good choices to use with Indeedee-M as well.</p> "

The given EV spread allows Arctozolt to outspeed up to Choice Scarf Heracross and improve Blizzard rolls. Low Kick 2HKOs Steelix after a layer of Spikes and OHKOs Stakataka.

Arctozolt is vulnerable to faster Choice Scarf users, particularly Mienshao and Darmanitan, so Pokemon that can switch into or set up on them are necessary, like RestTalk Suicune and Noivern. It also needs Steel-types such as Cobalion and Metagross chipped, as they can take Bolt Beak from full HP. Weakening them can be achieved through Spikes from Pokemon like Klefki and Roserade. Semi-hail cores need to be able to deal with sturdier Steel-types such as Registeel, which can wall both Pokemon easily. Fighting-types like Cobalion and Mienshao can deal with them. Finally, solid entry hazard control such as Starmie, Xatu, and Noivern is almost required on teams with Arctozolt, as they will always have two Ice-types extremely vulnerable to entry hazards.</p> "

Lastly, because Arctovish is unable to break through some bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune, Grass- and Electric-type teammates such as Roserade, Celebi, and the aforementioned Arctozolt are highly valuable.

Regidrago's average-to-good bulk and Dragon typing lend it many setup opportunities against bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune, but also against passive walls like Registeel. However, even after a boost, Regidrago is slower than every common Choice Scarf user. The Speed raise from Scale Shot can prevent Choice Scarf users from revenge killing Regidrago after setup, but it's inconsistent due to its variability in power. After a Dragon Dance, Thunder Fang 2HKOes even bulky Togekiss. Substitute helps Regidrago set up by blocking Scald burns and Toxic. The passive recovery from Leftovers means Regidrago can use Substitute many more times throughout a battle. An Adamant nature is preferable to ensure the 2HKO on Togekiss with Thunder Fang after a Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Try as it might, Regidrago can't break through Steelix, Galarian Weezing, Sylveon, and Doublade. Luckily, Toxtricity can pick up the slack and blow past each one with relative ease. Fighting-types such as Guts Heracross, Bewear, and Pangoro can overwhelm Sylveon and Galarian Weezing while breaking Steelix and Doublade. Mienshao, Darmanitan, and Incineroar can safely switch Regidrago into the battlefield with U-turn. Darmanitan and Incineroar synergize particularly well with Regidrago, as they can bring it in against bulky Water-types for a setup opportunity. Disguised as Regidrago, Zoroark can lure Galarian Weezing, Sylveon, Steelix, and Doublade with coverage moves in Extrasensory, Sludge Bomb, and Flamethrower. Dragon Dance Regidrago fits well on dual screens hyper offense teams, as it can get multiple boosts with ease thanks to its titanic bulk under dual screens. One notable Pokemon commonly seen on dual screens hyper offense is Cloyster; after a Shell Smash, it can OHKO both Doublade and Galarian Weezing with Hydro Pump.

The Speed raise also makes it harder to revenge kill with faster threats like Noivern and Cobalion. Hammer Arm is Regidrago's best move to hit Diancie as well as Steel-types such as Steelix and Registeel. Thunder Fang is a near-guaranteed 2HKO on max HP Togekiss. Explosion is an alternative over either Outrage or Scale Shot, as it opens the door for Regidrago's teammates by either severely weakening or outright KOing Togekiss, Sylveon, or Galarian Weezing.

Regidrago can also lure and severely weaken Fairy-types with Explosion so its Fighting- and Dark-type teammate can clean up afterward. Zoroark can disguise itself as Regidrago with Illusion to lure and surprise Fairy-types with a super effective Sludge Bomb. Pivots like Raikou, Mienshao, and Darmanitan are excellent for safely bringing Regidrago onto the field. Darmanitan and other Fire-types like Volcanion and Incineroar are grateful for Regidrago breaking bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Seismitoad.

However, Glastrier's positives are offset by its atrocious defensive typing and glacial Speed, which mean it will typically only get a few chances to check threats per game and requires significant team support to shine. High Horsepower complements Glastrier's Ice STAB by hitting Steel- and Fire-types like Cobalion, Metagross, and Darmanitan. Substitute allows Glastrier to set up on weaker Pokemon such as Crobat and Steelix and prevent status from the likes of Registeel and Gastrodon. Close Combat hits most High Horsepower targets like Incineroar and Registeel for significantly more damage, but it cannot hit Chandelure and its stat drops will usually force Glastrier out. Heavy-Duty Boots makes Glastrier significantly less reliant on entry hazard removers, but Leftovers is an alternative on teams with solid hazard removal. Defensive Pokemon often have a hard time breaking Substitute, so Leftovers synergizes well with it. The Speed EVs allow Glastrier to outpace Registeel, Diancie, and Vileplume.</p> <p>Glastrier is very customizable. Protect can be used on Substitute + Leftovers variants providing Glastrier with more recovery and allowing it to slowly outlast its counters and accumulate Chilling Neigh boosts. A spread of 252 HP / 92 Atk / 164 Spe allows Glastrier to completely take advantage of Registeel by making its Substitute survive Seismic Toss, although the lack of initial power can be detrimental against faster-paced teams. A spread of 140 HP / 124 Atk / 244 Spe outspeeds and sets up on Porygon2 and Galarian Weezing, while also outspeeding Sylveon and Incineroar. 180 HP / 252 Atk / 76 Spe allows Glastrier to maintain bulk and set up on Gastrodon with ease. Any of the given options can be mixed and matched to cover specific threats.</p> <p>Glastrier teams are often forced to run at least a few Pokemon with middling Speed, so reliable Speed control and revenge killers are required. Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Flygon as well as priority users like Golisopod, Durant, and Choice Band Metagross can remedy this issue. Mienshao and Zarude can also pivot on Flying-type switch-ins like Crobat and Togekiss for Glastrier to take advantage of. Similarly, Electric-types like Raikou and Xurkitree can scare out Water-types and lure in Ground-types for Glastrier. Togekiss pairs well with Glastrier, patching up its crippling Fighting-type weakness and can provide Wish and cleric support. In return, Glastrier can weaken Steel-types and ease the pressure on Togekiss to check Sharpedo and Flygon. Bulky Water-types like Milotic, Suicune, and Golisopod are Glastrier's biggest roadblocks, so Pokemon that take advantage of them like Raikou, Roserade, and Toxicroak are necessary. Spikes or Toxic Spikes from the likes of Golisopod, Roserade, and Dragalge can also help wear them down. Water-types of your own like Starmie, Volcanion, and Golisopod can serve as Fire- and Steel-type checks, with the former two providing entry hazard removal and Golisopod providing priority. Dedicated hazard removal is necessary if running Leftovers, so Pokemon like Togekiss, Noivern, and Volcanion synergize well with Glastrier.</p> "
