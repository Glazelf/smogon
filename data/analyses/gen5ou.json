It can still be used on non-Drought teams as a way to \"countersweep\" opposing sun teams, but considering sun teams are almost always stall oriented, Venusaur is not exactly a great answer to them. Being forced to manually set its own sun if not facing a Drought team and then having to find turns to set up Growth to be threatening means the effort-to-reward ratio is way too imbalanced to merit using Venusaur in most situations. Outside of sun, Venusaur is outclassed by Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Celebi in pretty much all aspects despite sporting nice balanced stats and the ability to check Keldeo.</p> ",

Hidden Power Fire provides the best two-move coverage with Giga Drain, becomes a pseudo-STAB move in the sun, and allows Venusaur to blow through Ferrothorn and Scizor; however, Sludge Bomb is far stronger and gives Venusaur another reliable STAB move outside of sun to threaten Pokemon like Latios, Hydreigon, Breloom, and Thundurus-T.</p> "}],

Still, Alakazam has pitiful bulk. In addition, it often struggles breaking past some of the most common Pokemon in OU, especially Tyranitar and bulky Steel-types.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Alakazam has a very wide movepool, and thus it has many other options. Hidden Power Fire can consistently hit Ferrothorn and Jirachi and deal massive damage to the less common Forretress. Charge Beam gives Alakazam a high chance to raise its Special Attack when finishing off weakened foes, making it even more threatening. As for support options, Alakazam can use Taunt to prevent opposing Pokemon, most notably Chansey, from healing. If using Life Orb, Substitute can be used against Pokemon Alakazam can scare out, easing prediction and providing Alakazam a form of protection against revenge killers. Calm Mind gives Alakazam some extra power to muscle past bulky Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Jellicent, and specially defensive Skarmory. Finally, Psych Up in tandem with Focus Sash and Psyshock is a gimmicky option but allows Alakazam to turn the tables on a boosted Volcarona.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Life Orb Alakazam is tough to switch into, but due to Alakazam's low bulk, it is easily taken out by priority or Choice Scarf users. Focus Sash Alakazam can be quite difficult to dispatch, as it will always require two separate hits to KO it. Choice Scarf Garchomp and Choice Scarf Jirachi deserve special mentions because they can easily KO both variants with Dual Chop and by causing a flinch with Iron Head. Aside from these, Alakazam's biggest enemies are those it cannot 2HKO; specially defensive Jirachi, specially defensive Skarmory, and Chansey can take any two attacks from Focus Sash Alakazam and proceed to threaten it out. Scizor is a solid check provided that Alakazam lacks Hidden Power Fire. Weavile not only outspeeds Alakazam but can also trap it with Pursuit, KOing Alakazam even if it stays in. Sableye can reliably beat Alakazam due to its immunities to Alakazam's STAB move and strongest coverage attack, Focus Blast.</p> ",

Sitting at a great Speed tier with a high Special Attack stat and impeccable coverage, Alakazam is a challenge to face. The choice in item depends on your team's needs; while the combination of Magic Guard and Focus Sash makes Alakazam a premier revenge killer by allowing it to avoid entry hazard and residual damage, Life Orb allows Alakazam to hit like a truck without fearing recoil. Psychic hits many targets for solid damage. Focus Blast gives Alakazam coverage on Steel- and Dark-types and, most notably, the ability to 2HKO Ferrothorn and Tyranitar. The third slot is dedicated towards coverage for opposing Psychic-types. Shadow Ball is preferred, as it also hits Jellicent hard, but Signal Beam allows Alakazam to hit Dark-types without relying on Focus Blast. Thunder Wave gives Alakazam a general utility move to cripple setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Gyarados, as well as other offensive Pokemon. Hidden Power Ice can be used to nail Choice Scarf users like Garchomp and Landorus-T on the switch, as well as Dragonite. Encore is another alternative that allows Alakazam to prevent opposing Pokemon from setting up or grant itself and its teammates free turns by temporarily locking a foe into an unfavorable move.</p> <p>Alakazam, like all other offensive Pokemon, appreciates entry hazard support to weaken foes. As such, spikers like Skarmory and Ferrothorn are good teammates. Skarmory can check and set up Spikes on the plethora of Choice Scarf users that threaten Alakazam, most notably Garchomp and Landorus-T. Your own Garchomp can set up Stealth Rock to support Alakazam, as well as check Tyranitar and Jirachi, two very common switch-ins to Alakazam. Jellicent can spinblock while spreading burns.</p> "

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its unique typing, good overall stats, and interesting movepool, Zapdos manages to hold a definite niche in OU. It has Roost to take repeated assaults, and can take on threatening special sweepers such as Volcarona (provided it is raining) and Tornadus. Furthermore, the combination of Zapdos's Electric typing, good coverage, Roost, and useful resistances allow it to threaten the ubiquitous rain offense teams and put big pressure on them. However, Zapdos has many flaws that prevent it from being a prevalent threat in OU. Offensively, Zapdos is mostly outclassed by Thundurus-T, which has slightly higher Speed, higher Special Attack, a better ability, and access to Nasty Plot. Zapdos is an appropriate offensive choice only if you take advantage of its better bulk and access to Heat Wave and Roost. Defensively, Zapdos's biggest flaw is its Stealth Rock weakness, which hampers its overall performance and makes it very team-reliant. Finally, even though Zapdos has great all-around stats, its special bulk is somewhat lacking in comparison to OU's premier special walls, such as Celebi, Jirachi, and Heatran.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Zapdos can use a SubRoost set with Thunderbolt and Toxic, which when coupled with the PP stalling that Pressure speeds up can have modest success. While it has the potential to be effective, especially with Toxic Spikes support, it loses much of the appeal of Zapdos in OU in the first place such as great coverage and the ability to threaten rain teams. Damp Rock coupled with Rain Dance and Volt Switch allow Zapdos to become an effective supporter for manual Rain Dance teams. While Agility sets are largely outclassed by Thundurus-T, Zapdos has access to Baton Pass and Roost, meaning it can become a blend of sweeper and tank with an Agility + Roost set, and a blend of sweeper and supporter with an Agility + Baton Pass set. Substitute and Charge Beam can fit in this set, too, if Zapdos runs Baton Pass. Hidden Power Grass can be used on any team that struggles against Gastrodon and Mamoswine, two Pokemon that normally give Zapdos problems, but has no use otherwise. Finally, Tailwind can be used on any offensive set, imitating Agility but helping the whole team, something that Thundurus-T can't do. However, Tailwind is not reliable enough to be worth it most of the time.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Chansey and Blissey are the best counters to any Zapdos set. Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Mamoswine counter Zapdos, too, as they wall its attacking moves, and have the added benefit of blocking Volt Switch. Tyranitar, Latias, Kyurem-B, specially defensive Jirachi, and any variant of Celebi and Jirachi in rain all wall Zapdos as well, and can either set up on it or OHKO it, with the exception of specially defensive Celebi, which can only use Perish Song to force it out. However, except for Chansey, Blissey, and Jirachi, all these Pokemon are crippled by Toxic.</p> <p>As for checks, anything that either resists Electric-types moves or is specially bulky and neutral to them can check Zapdos well, provided it isn't very susceptible to Zapdos's coverage moves and can hurt Zapdos back. This includes Pokemon such as Latios, specially defensive Heatran, and Terrakion in sand. In addition, if Zapdos lacks either Hidden Power Ice or Heat Wave, Dragon- and Ground-types (examples include Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus-T) and Steel- and Grass-types (examples include Ferrothorn, Celebi, and Jirachi) respectively become good checks.</p> ",

Thanks to its wide coverage and favorable match-up against most Pokemon found on rain teams, Zapdos is also a good anti-rain Pokemon. A STAB move is essential on Zapdos, taking advantage of Electric's great neutral coverage and super effective hits against the plethora of Water-type Pokemon found in OU, and there are two options. Thunderbolt is strong and reliable, while Volt Switch enables Zapdos to control the pace of the game and makes it a better pivot. Roost keeps Zapdos healthy throughout the game, helps alleviate its Stealth Rock weakness, and lets Zapdos PP stall some dangerous moves when combined with Pressure. Heat Wave lets Zapdos dent or OHKO the various Steel-types that it checks, such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Magnezone. Heat Wave also OHKOes Breloom, a Pokemon that Zapdos checks very well. Hidden Power Ice deals with Landorus-T and Dragon-types and gives Zapdos great neutral coverage when combined with its Electric STAB. On the other hand, Toxic cripples many common switch-ins to Zapdos, namely Hippowdon, Tyranitar, Latias, Kyurem-B, Gastrodon, and Mamoswine.</p> <p>The Speed EVs allow Zapdos to outspeed Adamant Breloom in order to OHKO it with Heat Wave before it has a chance to act. Roar is an option on Zapdos that makes it a pretty good check to boosting special attackers such as SubCM Jirachi, Calm Mind Latias, and any Nasty Plot Celebi variant. Thunder can be used as Zapdos's STAB if Politoed is a teammate, while Discharge is a good STAB option if your team really appreciates paralysis support. Baton Pass can also be used to guarantee being able to safely switch out of Ground-types and Pursuit users like Tyranitar.</p> <p>Zapdos needs Stealth Rock off the field in order to work properly, so physically defensive Forretress makes a good partner, spinning away hazards while sporting good synergy with Zapdos and covering many physical attackers that Zapdos can't. If Zapdos is used on a rain team, Tentacruel is the best spinner to use with Zapdos, as it can take the boosted Water-type attacks that Zapdos can't handle and is exceptional at spinning. Hippowdon is one of the best partners for Zapdos, as it handles most physical attackers that Zapdos has troubles with, such as Terrakion, Jirachi, and Tyranitar, while Zapdos checks most of the few physical attackers that can break through Hippowdon, such as Scizor, Breloom, and Gyarados. Furthermore, Hippowdon removes rain, allowing Zapdos to check offensive Starmie and Keldeo instead of easily getting 2HKOed by their STAB attacks. Celebi takes on the strong and potentially rain-boosted Water-type attacks that Zapdos can't handle, counters SubCM Jirachi with Perish Song, can make for a good check to Terrakion with a physically defensive spread, and can even form a VoltTurn combo with Zapdos.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Using its good bulk and access to Roost and Heat Wave, Zapdos can pull off an offensive set in OU, despite the major competition from Thundurus-T. By virtue of the above, Zapdos can check many dangerous offensive Pokemon that Thundurus-T can't, such as Scizor, Breloom, and Tornadus, all the while being very hard to switch into thanks to its good power and coverage. Thunderbolt is the STAB move of the set and deals with Water- and Flying-types, such as Keldeo, Gyarados, and Tornadus. Hidden Power Ice covers the Grass-, Dragon-, and Ground-types that resist or are immune to Thunderbolt, and Heat Wave takes care of the few Grass-types that don't mind Hidden Power Ice, namely Ferrothorn and Celebi, and some other Pokemon that Zapdos checks, such as Lucario and Scizor. Roost allows Zapdos to stick around long enough to check the threats it is supposed to check, counteracts any Stealth Rock damage that Zapdos may incur, and is the main trait that differentiates Zapdos from Thundurus-T.</p> <p>The EV spread gives Zapdos enough Speed to outrun Adamant Lucario and Special Attack is maximized to hit as hard as possible. Leftovers is the preferred item to further enhance Zapdos's bulk, help Zapdos focus on attacking instead of healing, and keep Zapdos as healthy as possible when conditions are not in Zapdos's favor (sandstorm or Stealth Rock being up for example). On the other hand, Expert Belt gives Zapdos a respectable power boost that allows it to 2HKO specially defensive variants of Jirachi, Celebi, and Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock (assuming rain is up in Ferrothorn's case) with Heat Wave, OHKO physically defensive variants of Jellicent, Politoed, and Tentacruel after Stealth Rock, always OHKO Thundurus-T after Stealth Rock, and 2HKO offensive Latias and specially defensive Hippowdon (the latter 73.44% of the time with Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes). Life Orb could be used for the increased power on Zapdos's STAB, but it cuts into Zapdos's lifespan significantly, taking away one of its main advantages over Thundurus-T. Thunder should be used on rain teams, while Volt Switch can be used as the STAB move of choice to have better momentum control. U-turn is also an option over Roost to gain momentum even against Ground-types and hit Celebi hard, but forgoing Roost is not recommended.</p> <p>Terrakion breaks through most Pokemon that wall Zapdos, such as Gastrodon, Heatran, Blissey, Chansey, and Kyurem-B, while Zapdos returns the favor by taking care of Breloom and Scizor, two of Terrakion's biggest troubles. Tyranitar and Scizor help against most special walls and can both take care of Latias with Pursuit. Breloom is another excellent physical attacker that beats most of the Pokemon that trouble Zapdos, and has the added benefit of checking Terrakion, one of Zapdos's biggest enemies. Rapid Spin support greatly helps Zapdos do its job of checking dangerous threats and allows Zapdos to focus more on attacking. Starmie and Tentacruel are the best options for rain teams, while Forretress has the best synergy overall with Zapdos, making it the best spinner to use alongside Zapdos outside of rain teams. Forretress can also provide Spikes for Zapdos, helping it get certain KOs while Zapdos discourages any spinner from switching in. If using Forretress, Tyranitar is an exceptional teammate due to its ability to trap and kill Jellicent (which prevents Forretress from spinning and thus hinders Zapdos indirectly), Latios, and Latias (two of Zapdos's checks). Entry hazard support also helps Zapdos obtain certain KOs, such as the 2HKO on Mamoswine with Heat Wave, the 2HKO on physically defensive Hippowdon with Hidden Power Ice, and the 2HKO on Ferrothorn with Heat Wave in rain, all with the help of Stealth Rock or one layer of Spikes. Terrakion and Tyranitar can both set up Stealth Rock and have good synergy with Zapdos. Landorus-T is another excellent user of the move and can also protect Zapdos from Terrakion and help deal with physical attackers in general.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Losing 50% of its health from Stealth Rock, having a mediocre base 90 Speed, being weak to Electric-, Rock-, and Water-type moves, and being outclassed by various other Fire-types were all reasons why Moltres never sees any real use in OU. However, Moltres's access to Hurricane gives it a reason to be used. While it faces stiff competition with the tier's premier Hurricane user, Tornadus, Moltres has its own unique traits to distinguish it. These are the ability to act as a hard check to some dangerous offensive Pokemon in OU, such as Volcarona and Swords Dance Scizor, the ability to use an Agility set to attempt a late-game sweep, the ability to overcome Jirachi, Bronzong, Metagross, and OHKO Ferrothorn in rain, and the ability to easily switch into many Pokemon that sun teams carry and punch holes with a stupidly strong Fire Blast. Even if those traits are not enough for Moltres to escape from the shadow of Tornadus and its other flaws, Moltres and Tornadus form a destructive Hurricane combo when combined together, where Moltres weakens the Pokemon that prevent Tornadus from cleaning up late-game or vice-versa, with Tornadus sacrificing itself after using priority Tailwind to allow Moltres to sweep. In short, despite needing a ton of support to work, Moltres has two definite niches in OU: the ability to work as a wallbreaking partner for Tornadus and the ability to act as a powerful Agility sweeper under rain.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A defensive set utilizing Substitute and Roost alongside Flamethrower and Hurricane or Toxic is the most viable Moltres set not already listed. Thanks to Pressure, Moltres can easily PP stall moves from Pokemon that would otherwise hurt it badly by alternating between Substitute and Roost, such as Stone Edge from Tyranitar and Hydro Pump from Rotom-W and Choice Specs Politoed. Such a set should run 248 HP / 164 SpD / 96 Spe with a Timid nature. This gives Moltres enough Speed to outrun positive-natured base 70s, such as Breloom and Politoed, and places the rest of the EVs into HP and Special Defense because Moltres's typing is better suited to take special hits. However, this set can be walled and rendered useless by many common Pokemon, such as Roar Heatran, Hippowdon, Jirachi sets with Calm Mind or Thunder, and Tentacruel, and is checked by many other Pokemon, depending on the final move Moltres chooses to run. Its viability is also hurt pretty badly by Stealth Rock, as with Stealth Rock up it can't wall any of the threats that it otherwise could and has to spend all of its time using Roost. Substitute can be used with Life Orb on the offensive set when running Roost to take advantage of Pressure and stall out moves that could hurt Moltres, scout faster switch-ins, and ease prediction, but between Substitute, Life Orb recoil, and Stealth Rock damage, Moltres will rarely find time to attack or heal. Choice Scarf is an option on the offensive set to enable Moltres to act as a moderately powerful revenge killer, but it is outclassed by pretty much any other revenge killer in OU due to a huge Stealth Rock weakness and a mediocre Speed stat. Lastly, an Agility set with Fire Blast, Solar Beam, and Hidden Power Ground is a viable option in sun teams and can act as a decent cleaner late-game, but faces a lot of competition from better sun sweepers, such as Volcarona and Victini, and thus is generally outclassed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best way to deal with Moltres is Stealth Rock, as with it on the field Moltres can only switch in three times at best. If the Stealth Rock setter is paired with Pokemon such as Choice Band Tyranitar, Moltres will have an even harder time coming in, as the two spinners most commonly paired with Moltres—Starmie and Tentacruel—are in danger of getting trapped. As far as traditional counters go, Chansey and Blissey are the only surefire counters to Moltres. Tyranitar and Heatran work too, but they both get hurt pretty badly by the appropriate Hidden Power, and Heatran can't do any immediate damage back to Moltres. Rotom-W and Rotom-H, as well as Zapdos and Jirachi in rain, are all good checks, but are prone to getting worn down (the first two lack reliable recovery while Zapdos is weak to Stealth Rock) except for Jirachi, and will lose if a Hurricane confusion occurs or will get 2HKOed by Fire Blast in Jirachi's case. Everything faster than Moltres that can take a hit and OHKO back is an okay check, namely Choice Scarf Rotom-W, Jolteon, Thundurus-T, and Calm Mind Jirachi, as they can switch into Moltres once or twice and force it out. Finally, there are many offensive Pokemon that can revenge kill Moltres, including Keldeo, Latios, Starmie, and Terrakion, as long as Moltres hasn't used Agility.</p> ",

Tied with Tornadus as the most powerful Hurricane user in OU, Moltres is able to 2HKO even Pokemon that resist Flying, such as bulky Rotom-W and offensive Heatran, after Stealth Rock damage. Additionally, Moltres's typing gives it the ability to check or threaten many Pokemon that other common rain team Pokemon can't, such as Breloom, Volcarona, Celebi, and Ferrothorn. Moltres can also perform admirably under sun, as no Pokemon besides Heatran can reliably switch into its Fire Blast; to make matters worse for opposing sun teams, Moltres gets many opportunities to switch in against Pokemon commonly found on sun teams, including Ninetales, Volcarona, and Forretress. Hurricane is Moltres's strongest and most reliable attack under the rain and the move it should be using most of the time. Even under the rain, Fire Blast can threaten many of the Steel-types that can tank a Hurricane, as well as always OHKOing Ferrothorn. Fire Blast is also Moltres's most reliable attack under sand and sun and allows Moltres to threaten common sun sweepers such as Volcarona. U-turn allows Moltres to gain momentum for its team as well as deal decent damage to Tyranitar switch-ins. Hidden Power Fighting allows Moltres to 2HKO any variant of Tyranitar and deal solid damage to Heatran.</p> <p>Choice Specs is the optimal item choice because of the huge power it provides and because Moltres should be using Hurricane most of the time anyway. A Modest nature is used to maximize Moltres's power, but Moltres can also use a Timid nature to outspeed Pokemon such as Jolly Mamoswine, Modest Hydreigon, and neutral nature Kyurem-B. However, Moltres will lose out on a lot of power and notably the ability to 2HKO Rotom-W (after Stealth Rock damage) and OHKO Garchomp.</p> <p>Moltres can use Hidden Power Grass in its fourth moveslot to hit specially defensive Rotom-W hard. Hidden Power Grass also 2HKOes Choice Scarf Tyranitar after Stealth Rock damage and OHKOes Gastrodon. Another alternative, Hidden Power Ground allows Moltres to OHKO any variant of Heatran after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Politoed is a mandatory teammate for Moltres, providing rain to boost Hurricane's accuracy. Because of Moltres's crippling Stealth Rock weakness, a spinner is also imperative to allow Moltres more longevity. Analytic Starmie is a great option for offensively inclined teams, being able to threaten offensive Pokemon such as Keldeo and Terrakion, which give Moltres trouble, as well as being able to weaken Rotom-W for Moltres. An option for balanced teams, Tentacruel can set Toxic Spikes to wear down common Moltres switch-ins, such as Tyranitar and Chansey, as well as checking Water-types such as Keldeo. In return, Moltres can threaten Pokemon that Starmie and Tentacruel have issues with, such as Celebi, Ferrothorn, and Gastrodon.</p> <p>Celebi also has great synergy with Moltres, as it can handle the various Water- and Electric-types that can threaten Moltres. It can also use Baton Pass to pass Nasty Plot boosts to Moltres, allowing it to 2HKO almost the entire metagame with +2 Hurricanes. In return, Moltres can threaten the various Bug-, Steel-, and Grass-types that Celebi attracts, namely Scizor and Ferrothorn. Finally, Choice Band Terrakion can freely switch into Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Heatran through Moltres's U-turn and proceed to eliminate them with Close Combat, while Moltres can KO physical walls such as Landorus-T and Jellicent in return.</p> "

Thanks to its typing, Moltres can force out and set up on dangerous and common Pokemon, Technician Breloom and Scizor, meaning that setting up won't be very hard as long as Stealth Rock is off the field. Hurricane OHKOes every single offensive Pokemon that doesn't resist it after Stealth Rock and has great neutral coverage, with only nine Pokemon that resist it in OU. Fire Blast complements Hurricane perfectly, OHKOing even in rain some of the Pokemon that can take a Hurricane, such as Magnezone and Skarmory, and greatly damaging some of the rest, such as Jirachi and Metagross. It also gives Moltres a fearsome weapon against sun teams as well as a more accurate STAB move to use if neither rain nor sun are up. Fire Blast is also useful to OHKO Ferrothorn in rain, a quality that many rain teams struggle to find but really appreciate. Roost gives Moltres better survivability, allowing it to have better presence in early- and mid-game, and eases setup against Pokemon that Moltres walls, making any attempt of those Pokemon to stay in and wear Moltres down futile. Roost is also very useful in games where using Agility is not an option, either because Moltres and its teammates can't get past the opposing defensive core or because it is difficult for Moltres's team to keep Stealth Rock off the field, and allows Moltres to take the role of a wallbreaker and a check to problematic Pokemon. On the other hand, Hidden Power Ground forfeits all of those benefits to give Moltres better sweeping potential, as with it Moltres can OHKO offensive Heatran and deal 75% minimum to specially defensive variants, OHKO Jolteon after Stealth Rock most of the time, and hit Ninetales slightly harder and more reliably than Fire Blast.</p> <p>Modest is the best nature for this set, as it allows Moltres to get a ton of important OHKOs, and Moltres already outspeeds every Pokemon in OU after an Agility. However, a Timid nature helps Moltres outspeed some dangerous threats without the need for an Agility boost, such as neutral natured Kyreum-B and Hydreigon, Jolly Mamoswine, and Modest Celebi. Hidden Power Fighting OHKOes Choice Scarf Tyranitar after Stealth Rock most of the time and 2HKOes every other variant, while also dealing good damage to Heatran. Hidden Power Grass is useful to 2HKO any Rotom-W, dealing 68% damage minimum to 232 HP variants, and OHKO Gastrodon with a layer of Spikes while hitting Tyranitar for decent damage as well.</p> <p>Politoed is a mandatory teammate, as Moltres is a dedicated rain sweeper. When using Moltres, serious measures against Stealth Rock must be taken. Starmie and Tentacruel are both excellent spinners for rain teams, with Starmie putting up big offensive pressure and Tentacruel being a better dedicated spinner. Custap Berry Forretress with Rapid Spin is another great teammate for Moltres, setting up entry hazards and preventing Stealth Rock from getting up the first few turns, making it easier for Moltres to switch in at the early stages of the game. Although rarely seen on rain teams, Xatu is an option for very fast-paced offensive teams with other U-turn or Volt Switch users and can prevent Stealth Rock from getting up for a limited amount of time, which is fine considering that the game shouldn't last very long anyway. Agility Moltres is best used on offensive rain teams that have good momentum and pace control, where it is easy to keep Stealth Rock off the field by constantly attacking with Pokemon that are difficult to wall, meaning that the spinner that accompanies Moltres won't have to get rid of Stealth Rock very often.</p> "

Roost increases Moltres's longevity and allows it to recover from crippling Stealth Rock damage. Substitute protects Moltres from status and, in conjunction with Roost, helps Moltres PP stall the opposing team with Pressure—Moltres finds many opportunities to set up Substitutes on Pokemon it can force out, such as Breloom, Celebi, and Scizor. Hurricane is a STAB attack that never misses in the rain, hits hard even without any offensive investment, and also boasts a 30% chance to confuse the target, which can give Moltres opportunities to use Roost or set up a Substitute in tight situations. Finally, Will-O-Wisp helps Moltres check physical attackers and wear down bulky Pokemon with burn damage. Many Pokemon that resist Hurricane, such as Tyranitar, Rotom-W, and Jirachi, hate being burned, as it severely cuts into their longevity.</p> <p>Moltres's HP should be maximized first to increase its longevity and give it solid mixed bulk. 96 Speed EVs combined with a Timid nature allow Moltres to outspeed Jolly Breloom.

Moltres can also sacrifice some bulk for Speed by using an EV spread of 248 HP / 44 Def / 216 Spe with a Timid nature, letting it outspeed threats such as neutral-nature Kyurem-B and Hydreigon as well as Jolly Toxicroak. Leftovers is necessary to provide extra longevity, as Moltres is easily weakened by Stealth Rock and Substitute damage, so it needs as much recovery as it can get.</p> <p>Although it isn't mandatory when using this Moltres set, Politoed is still a great partner due to its rain support, which boosts the accuracy of Moltres's Hurricanes. Rapid Spin support is also much appreciated when using Moltres, especially this defensive set, which switches in and out often. Tentacruel is the best option, as it can check not only Heatran, which laughs at anything Moltres tries to do to it, but also dangerous Water-type foes such as Keldeo and Politoed. Tentacruel can also lay Toxic Spikes to help Moltres stall out foes. Both Politoed and Tentacruel appreciate Moltres's ability to check Grass-types such as Breloom, Celebi, and Amoonguss, as well as Toxicroak, which often sees Politoed and Tentacruel as setup fodder. Moltres also appreciates Spikes support to make the most of the switches it forces. Many Pokemon that resist Hurricane, such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Jirachi, hate Spikes and will find themselves being worn down quickly by entry hazards, Hurricane, and possibly a burn. Ferrothorn is a great partner, as it has amazing defensive synergy with Moltres and appreciates the removal of Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr, Toxicroak, and Breloom as well as Grass-types that can prevent Ferrothorn from healing itself with Leech Seed. Although it cannot set up Spikes, Gastrodon also has great defensive synergy with Moltres and fares well against almost all of Moltres's usual switch-ins. Although it shares a Water-type weakness with Moltres, Hippowdon can check dangerous Rock-types such as Terrakion and Tyranitar and absorb Electric-type attacks from the likes of Thundurus-T and Magnezone.</p> "

  "Milotic": {
    "overview": "<p>Milotic moves into the new generation retaining her status as the only bulky, pure Water-type with instant, self-sufficient recovery. Above-average HP, excellent Special Attack, and phenomenal Special Defense stats allow Milotic to function as a great mixed wall that is also capable of dishing out her own damage. Marvel Scale remains a unique defensive ability that sets Milotic apart from other bulky Water-types as a status absorber or a Sleep Talk user. Despite only a minute increase to her already shallow movepool, Milotic has some new toys to play with in BW. Scald is a welcomed asset, burns helping protect Milotic's weaker defensive stat and Dragon Tail gives her much-needed phazing. Since these options are TM-based, Milotic is one of the few Pokemon who can enjoy the generation transition with no detrimental impact. In a chaotic, new world dominated by offense, Milotic establishes herself as a moderate defensive check, not supporting the team so much as disrupting the opponent.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With Scald disabling physical sweepers, Milotic can try Mirror Coat to nail special attackers as well. For this, a spread focusing on Special Defense is recommended as Milotic needs all the investment it can get to survive and reflect the most powerful of special moves. Light Screen, when combined with Scald, can be used to increase Milotic's overall defenses. A Calm nature with 252 HP / 200 Def / 56 SpD makes a good balance, but Milotic will want to focus most of her EVs on Defense this generation to differentiate herself from Jellicent.</p> <p>Hidden Power Electric and Hidden Power Grass are offensive alternatives to Ice Beam or the support options on the Recover set, but Milotic won't be doing as much damage to her fellow Water-types as she would with Toxic. Hidden Power Fire is another option to deal with Ferrothorn, but doesn't offer many other benefits. A Life Orb set is also a possibility, but can be hard to pull off--although Milotic has great Special Attack, barely better-than-average Speed, a poor offensive movepool, and a lack of setup moves leave her to coverage-based tanking at best.</p> <p>Magic Coat's increased versatility this generation extends to Milotic as well, although more often than not, Milotic is happy to take a status move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>For all of her splendor and bulk, Milotic is easily 2HKOed by powerful Grass- and Electric-type moves. Zapdos, Virizion, Breloom, Celebi, Jolteon, and Lilligant can all counter Milotic quite effectively with their STAB moves, but the majority of them won't like being hit by Ice Beam or badly poisoned. Ferrothorn and Whimsicott make Milotic's life hellish as they can sap massive amounts of health through Leech Seed--Ferrothorn is especially troublesome as it can set up entry hazards. However, Scald can be troublesome as Ferrothorn will be unable to kill Milotic with Power Whip if it's burned. The RestTalk set can also outrun Ferrothorn and, should Sleep Talk select Dragon Tail, phaze it before it gets a chance to move. If Milotic switches into either Ferrothorn's Thunder Wave or Whimsicott's Stun Spore, killing her will be much harder.</p> <p>Milotic needs Ice Beam to slay dragons and Grass-types, Toxic to overcome bulky Water-types, and Haze to counter Substitute sweepers. Once you figure out her support move, she'll be relatively simple to counter appropriately. Jellicent might have a chance against the Recover set if it's running Energy Ball or Toxic. Taunt is its best option against the RestTalk set, however, because Milotic can easily outspeed Jellicent and use Toxic itself, while Jellicent will find it hard to do any damage back. Tentacruel can easily set up on Milotic, but runs the risk of being stalled to death if Milotic is burned. Additionally, if Tentacruel is used to set up Toxic Spikes, one should be careful of a Milotic switch-in nabbing the Marvel Scale boost on the first layer.</p> ",

        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Milotic's access to Recover, which frees up an extra moveslot for both offensive and support moves. Scald and Ice Beam allow Milotic to exercise her robust 100 base Special Attack. Scald's 30% burn chance means that most physical sweepers must be wary of switching in, lest they be crippled. Ice Beam rounds out Milotic's coverage, notable targets including Salamence, Dragonite, and Haxorus.</p> <p>The choice of support move is at the player's discretion, each having its own merits; Toxic allows Milotic to make short work of her fellow bulky Water-types and works well with Recover-stalling, whereas Dragon Tail allows Milotic to bounce away setup sweepers and inflict extra damage through entry hazards. It also bypasses Taunt, but unlike Haze, it is liable to miss, albeit rarely, and fails to get rid of opponents behind a Substitute.</p> <p>The defensive EV spread makes the most of Milotic's mixed walling potential, providing her with solid 394 HP and 280+ defenses, while the 4 offensive EVs guarantee Ice Beam's OHKO on uninvested Salamence. Toxic can be used over Ice Beam which would allow Milotic to shuffle status across an opponent's team with Dragon Tail. If one is turned off by the idea of conflicting statuses, then Surf can be used over Scald. However, most opponents will enjoy neither burn nor Toxic, rendering Surf's additional Base Power an inferior choice.</p> <p>Milotic can fit on both bulky offensive and pure stall teams, as both welcome a defensive pivot with the potential to hit back. Entry hazard support is always welcome. Milotic enjoys being part of a Fire / Water / Grass core; Ferrothorn, Roserade, and Whimsicott come to mind as worthwhile Grass-type partners, especially with the entry hazard potential of the first two. Heatran and Chandelure are great Fire-type choices as in most cases Milotic can pave the way for their sweep by eliminating enemy Water-types.</p> <p>In addition, Milotic works wonderfully in tandem with sweepers that fear Ice-, Water-, or Fire-type moves: Latios, Dragonite, Scizor, Lucario and most other Dragon- and Steel-types hence work as teammates. They allow Milotic to avoid getting into stall wars with the most resilient of walls. Thanks to Poison Heal, Gliscor or Breloom can switch in and absorb Toxic, as well as Electric-type moves. Milotic can happily switch into an opponent's attempts at set-up and status; an activated Marvel Scale gives Milotic the potential to exceed Skarmory's Defense. Opposing Scalds, the first layer of Toxic Spikes, and Will-O-Wisp all provide optimal opportunities to switch in and grab the defensive boost.</p> "

        "name": "RestTalk",
        "description": "<p>The fabled strategy of RestTalking is definitely still viable on Milotic because she is the only Pokemon that receives a defensive reward for using Rest, through Marvel Scale. Scald, again, is the primary STAB because of its chance to enhance Milotic's walling ability. Dragon Tail finally allows Milotic to join the phazing ranks of Gyarados and Swampert, becoming a team player of sorts as it can hamper opposing efforts to set up or spread status. With Sleep Talk, Dragon Tail loses its negative priority, allowing Milotic to phaze slower opponents before they even have a chance to move. Milotic is a solid choice over Gyarados in this niche because of her lack of Stealth Rock weakness, better Special Defense, the boost from Marvel Scale, and lack of an easily exploitable 4x weakness to Electric-type moves.</p> <p>As with the Recover set, the EV spread and nature give Milotic near-equal defensive stats. While Marvel Scale is inactive, Milotic sits at 394 HP, 282 Defense, and 286 Special Defense. However, after a Rest, Milotic's Defense skyrockets to an incredibly durable 423. It is also of interest to note that the combination of Rest and Scald actually allows Milotic to handle any of the five major statuses and restore itself to full health. An Attack-lowering nature is used because Dragon Tail is being used to phaze rather than as a legitimate attacking option. Before choosing this over Gyarados, one has to consider defenses, damage roll, and burn chance. Marvel Scale also makes Milotic a viable choice over Suicune, but as always, one must weigh the many pros and cons of Dragon Tail vs Roar.</p> <p>Entry hazards of all kinds are welcome, although at least two are recommended to make full use of Milotic's phazing powers. One should probably take into account the fact that Toxic Spikes is somewhat counter-productive with Scald, however. As Milotic is still effectively acting as a mixed wall, it's a good idea to have Pokemon in the wings who are entirely focused on one defensive stat, such as Blissey or Snorlax, and Hippowdon or Skarmory. Like Jellicent, Milotic has high Special Defense and the power to burn her foes, but she isn't Pursuit weak and boasts superior physical defense, even before considering Rest and Marvel Scale. As Milotic and Jellicent have similar niches, it is recommended that one relies on another spinblocker, such as Spiritomb, Chandelure, or Dusclops.</p> "

  "Infernape": {
    "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced around the time BW was the main generation. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the current BW OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>A former superstar of mixed sweeping, Infernape has found new life as a brutal sun-based wallbreaker. Boasting a neutrality to Stealth Rock and a devastating Fighting-type STAB, Infernape isn't your run-of-the-mill fragile Fire-type attacker. When the sun is up, Infernape's Flare Blitz is devastatingly powerful, plowing through even the toughest walls. Furthermore, when in less favorable weather conditions, Infernape can fall back on its coverage moves, U-turn, and STAB Close Combat. Infernape also boasts an exceptional base 108 Speed, which makes it an excellent revenge killer and offensive Pokemon in a crowded speed tier.</p> <p>That said, unlike some of its contemporaries, Infernape isn't a nuclear weapon. It's more of a smart bomb, and needs precise guidance to function effectively. When used carelessly, Infernape's time to shine can be short. Some prominent Pokemon, namely Latios, Latias, and Dragonite, boast resistances to both of Infernape's STABs, and are durable enough that just spamming Flare Blitz won't be enough to take them down. The prevalence of rain teams also makes it difficult for Infernape to leverage its Fire STAB. However, when used with prediction and finesse, you can be sure that Infernape's sunny days will be here to stay.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Let's take a moment to appreciate how expansive Infernape's movepool is. It has a healthy supply of offensive choices, access to some of the best boosting moves in the game, and a surprisingly long list of support moves. Infernape is capable of using movesets with Nasty Plot, Work Up, Calm Mind, or Swords Dance to decent success, as the extra power boost makes Infernape difficult to wall. The days of sweeping entire teams with it are long gone, however, as Infernape finds itself easily revenge killed in the OU metagame. Vacuum Wave can be used over Mach Punch on pure special attacking sets. Encore can occasionally be used to lock an unsuspecting Pokemon into a useless move and give you a free turn. It's useless in practice though, as Infernape's fantastic coverage can easily force switches. Focus Blast is an option on pure special attacking sets, but its abysmal accuracy and the fact that most special walls take more damage from Close Combat make it a throwaway move option. Slack Off can be used on the mixed set to mitigate Life Orb recoil or heal in general. However, it takes away Infernape's ability to put pressure on the opponent, and comes at the cost of a coverage move, making it difficult to use in general.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Unfortunately for Infernape, its fantastic coverage nonetheless leaves certain Pokemon easily able to beat it. Latias and Latios, for example, are the perfect counters to Infernape. They're capable of switching into most of Infernape's attacks, have access to healing moves to keep up defensive pressure, and can threaten Infernape or its teammates with STAB Draco Meteor or Psyshock. They also make for fantastic checks due to their higher Speed stats; as long as either Latias or Latios is still standing, Infernape will have a hard time doing much of anything. The only things either of them has to worry about is U-turn, especially from the Choice Band set, and sun-boosted Flare Blitz, which deals over 60% to both of them. (Note: Latios's comparatively poorer defensive stats make it harder for him to check Infernape.) Other Dragon-types, such as Salamence and Dragonite, can act as decent checks to Infernape, but need to watch out for Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p>Certain other bulky Water-types possess unique traits that make it difficult for Infernape to beat them. Politoed is a decent stop to Infernape, as long it doesn't switch into Close Combat or Thunder Punch. The rain that accompanies it removes sun and sandstorm, effectively neuters Fire moves, and dramatically lessens Infernape's usefulness in the long run. Jellicent's immunity to Fighting, resistance to Fire, and access to Recover make it a solid counter to Infernape. Jellicent only has to worry about Thunder Punch and sun-boosted Flare Blitz, which can 2HKO it. Tentacruel is capable of getting in Infernape's way with its dual resistances to Infernape's STAB moves, and if rain happens to be up, can avoid being 2HKOed by Thunder Punch with Protect. Gyarados has Intimidate and resistances to both Fire and Fighting, which allow it to easily withstand sun-boosted Flare Blitz, and provide an all-around good check to Infernape in general. That said, its vulnerability to Stealth Rock and quadruple weakness to Thunder Punch make it a shaky check in some cases.</p> <p>Hippowdon's meaty defenses allow it to wall Infernape both physically and specially. Specially defensive sets can wall every set barring the Choice Band set (Fire Blast and Close Combat fail to 2HKO specially defensive Hippowdon) and physically defensive sets can easily wall the Choice Band set. Hippowdon's Sand Stream also passively nerfs Infernape used on sun teams. Faster revenge killers such as Alakazam and Choice Scarf Keldeo can spell the end to Infernape, and finally, good prediction on your part and passive damage can help defeat Infernape. Since it usually incurs recoil damage from Life Orb or Flare Blitz, switching in the right checks at the right time can quickly whittle it down.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>A Choice Band turns Infernape into a powerful offensive threat from turn one and an absolute terror on sun teams. Though it faces competition from Darmanitan and Victini, Infernape has several notable advantages over both sun attackers. The first is Infernape's neutrality to Stealth Rock, which allows it to switch into battle more frequently, a rather significant trait for a Choice Band user. The second is Infernape's Fighting STAB; unlike Darmanitan and Victini, Infernape does not have to resort to its coverage moves to deal with the opposing weather starters Politoed and Tyranitar. Instead, it can deter them from switching in with just its STAB alone. Despite its lower firepower (pun intended), Infernape is capable of demolishing most switch-ins, notably bulky Water-types such as Tentacruel, Jellicent, and Rotom-W, with its sun-boosted Flare Blitz. Close Combat is a powerful STAB move capable of dealing heavy damage to the right targets, and is a useful move to fall back on when Flare Blitz isn't ideal. U-turn is primarily used to keep momentum on your side in situations where attacking would prove detrimental (i.e. when Infernape is not operating under sun), though you should focus on attacking when Infernape is in play. Thunder Punch takes care of bulky Water-types that are tricky to deal with, such as Gyarados, which is capable of taking sun-boosted Flare Blitz due to Intimidate, and other Water-types in general when the sun isn't shining. If you're confident in your ability to deal with Water-types, Mach Punch gives Infernape access to semi-powerful priority.</p> <p>At the cost of some Speed, an Adamant nature can be used for a significant power boost. For example, when an Adamant Infernape is used, has guaranteed OHKOs on Latios and Jellicent with U-turn and Thunder Punch respectively after Stealth Rock damage. The loss in Speed is generally not worth the boost in power though, because Infernape resides in an important Speed tier. A Life Orb can be used over a Choice Band for added flexibility, and the loss of power isn't too pronounced, as Infernape is capable of 2HKOing practically every switch-in with sun-boosted Flare Blitz and a coverage move. That said, Infernape will suffer Life Orb recoil which compounds the damage from Flare Blitz. To avoid unnecessary recoil, Fire Punch can be used in the fourth slot as an alternative to Flare Blitz, in the event that an OHKO or 2HKO is possible to achieve with just Fire Punch</p> <p>Choice Band Infernape absolutely needs Ninetales as a partner to succeed, as otherwise, it's a fairly unremarkable attacker. While the sun is up though, Choice Band Infernape makes for a fantastic wallbreaker, so it's important to bring it out as early as possible to weaken your opponent's team and facilitate a sweep later on. There are a few roadblocks that prevent Choice Band Infernape from doing its job. First and foremost, rain absolutely kills this set's effectiveness, so it's crucial to keep Stealth Rock off your field and have a Ninetales that can stick around. Latias and Latios are roadblocks to this set, as despite taking insane amounts of damage from sun-boosted Flare Blitz and U-turn, they are capable of tanking an attack and OHKOing Infernape in return. Worse still, they're common revenge killers to Infernape, and if the sun isn't up, they'll have a much easier time switching into Infernape and forcing it out. Specially defensive Heatran is a great teammate, as it excels at checking Latias and Latios and has access to Stealth Rock. Physically defensive Hippowdon is also a difficult Pokemon to bypass, as it easily avoids the 2HKO from Flare Blitz and Close Combat, and it can change the weather upon switching in. U-turn works best here, and fortunately, there are several Pokemon that can switch into Hippowdon, such as Xatu and Forretress.</p> <p>Choice Band Infernape is prediction-heavy; even though its STAB moves have the ability to do ridiculous amounts of damage, it won't matter if your opponent is able to switch the right Pokemon into Infernape and kill your momentum. It's important to scrutinize each your moves before attacking, as a mistake may leave you open to getting set up on or give your opponent a free attack. Overall, Choice Band Infernape's coverage moves give it the ability to KO Pokemon that are well-suited to tanking sun-boosted Flare Blitz, making it a handful to deal with, but its reliance on prediction makes it difficult for players to utilize it to its full potential.</p> "

        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>The original mix-master ace from DPP returns largely unchanged to the BW2 metagame. This set focuses on Infernape's great coverage and offensive stats to wreck switch-ins and break through defensive cores. Overheat deals a ton of damage in a burst, but should only be used when you're sure it will land on Pokemon that are weak to Fire-type moves, since the Special Attack drop it incurs will leave Infernape vulnerable to certain Pokemon, such as Dragonite. Close Combat is a powerful offensive option that complements Overheat nicely by targeting some of the Fire-type resists in OU. Close Combat shouldn't be used in the early game on forced switches however, as most of Infernape's checks resist it. Instead, it should be used mid-game to late-game when everything on your opponent's team is around 50% or lower. Thunder Punch is used for Pokemon that resist Infernape's STAB combination, and is arguably Infernape's most important primary coverage move, as it allows Infernape to heavily damage its checks--Starmie, Jellicent, and Tentacruel--and obliterate Gyarados. Hidden Power Ice extends Infernape's coverage by targeting Pokemon with a quadruple weakness to Ice, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Dragonite. U-turn grants Infernape the ability to scout and offer switch advantage as well as damage Latios and Latias (two fairly good Infernape checks), while Mach Punch can pick off weakened threats such as Terrakion. However, neither option should be used over Hidden Power Ice without justification, as the extra coverage is too important to pass up.</p> <p>The main spread allows Infernape to OHKO Garchomp after Stealth Rock, usually OHKO bulky Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock, OHKO Thundurus-T with Fire Blast after Stealth Rock, and 2HKO specially defensive Hippowdon with Fire Blast after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. If you decide to use an Expert Belt, the spread 96 Atk / 160 SpA / 252 Spe gives Infernape enough power to OHKO Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. Expert Belt strengthens Infernape's performance on sand teams, since it's capable of staying in play much longer compared to Life Orb variants. However, this comes at a significant decrease in power, especially against Pokemon who take neutral damage from Infernape such as Rotom-W. Grass Knot wrecks Pokemon that have a quadruple weakness to Grass, such as Gastrodon, and does a decent amount of damage to Jellicent and Hippowdon, though you will need to pump more EVs into Special Attack to guarantee a 2HKO. Fire Blast can be used over Overheat for consistent damage, as it doesn't lower Infernape's Special Attack (important against Dragonite, which avoids the 2HKO from a combination of Overheat and -2 Hidden Power Ice).</p> <p>Mixed Infernape is oddly at its best on sandstorm teams; Tyranitar is capable of trapping Infernape's best offensive checks (Latios and Latias), and the extra damage from sand makes it easier to obtain kills in general. On the other hand, sandstorm negatively compounds with Life Orb recoil, which guarantees that Infernape will burn out faster than most Pokemon. A decent alternative to Tyranitar is Weavile, which can trap and kill just about every single offensive check to Infernape, though it has a much harder time doing so. That said, Mixed Infernape should not concern itself with staying alive; its primary goal is to deal as much damage as it can in a short amount of time. Regardless, a spinner such as Starmie or Forretress doesn't hurt, to take some of that pressure off. This set shines against stall teams or teams with durable cores, but a significant amount of prediction is required, as Life Orb, sandstorm, and entry hazard damage seriously hamper Infernape's ability to stay in play.</p> "

        "name": "Anti-Lead",
        "description": "<p>Lead Infernape has the distinction of having an advantage against almost every single common lead in OU, with the exceptions of Politoed, Rotom-W, and Hippowdon, and is almost guaranteed to set up Stealth Rock, while simultaneously preventing the opponent from setting up their own hazards. Its effectiveness as a lead is largely attributed to Fake Out, since it completely nullifies lead strategies revolving around Focus Sash and Sturdy. Dedicated leads such as lead Terrakion only have a 50% chance of setting up Stealth Rock, and are OHKOed if they stay in. Custap Berry users such as Skarmory and Forretress are placed in a checkmate position, as they're unable to rely on Sturdy to protect them from Overheat or use their Custap Berry. Crustle is the exception to the rule, as Infernape is unable to OHKO it. That said, Infernape is capable of 2HKOing it without activating Custap Berry, limiting Crustle to just Stealth Rock or one layer of Spikes. Overheat and Close Combat round off the set as two powerful STAB moves with decent coverage, and give Infernape utility beyond the lead phase. With Focus Sash, Infernape is near-guaranteed to activate Blaze, supercharging Overheat in the process.</p> <p>Infernape can also be used as a dedicated Endeavor lead, and because of its access to priority, it can finish off opposing leads with a one-two punch combo. That said, Mamoswine is much better at executing this strategy due to its immunity to all forms of weather damage. Infernape can forego running Stealth Rock for more coverage, but there's little reason to do this unless you're fond of Focus Sash attackers.</p> <p>Despite having positive matchups against most leads, you will occasionally run across leads that will completely shut this Infernape down. Hippowdon is barely fazed by Infernape's STABs and can OHKO Infernape in return with Earthquake. Sand Stream nullifies Focus Sash, so Infernape is forced to flee or sacrifice itself to set up Stealth Rock (which may or may not work to your advantage). Politoed can easily overcome Infernape with its Water-type STAB moves and renders its Fire STAB useless with Drizzle. Nearly every Grass- and Dragon-type should be able to put a stop to either weather starter, and Celebi and Latias deserve special mention because they are usually able to hard counter both threats. Thanks to team preview, your opponent might decide to lead a fast check to Infernape, such as Alakazam or Latias, so make sure that Infernape's default position is not in the lead position.</p> <p>Lead Infernape finds its home on offensive teams that want Stealth Rock set up as soon as possible, as well as those that wish to prevent hazards being set on their side of the field. Even after Infernape has successfully completed its job, it can still act as a decent offensive threat that can smack things around with its acceptable offenses and base 108 Speed!</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>A Choice Scarf turns Infernape into your run-of-the-mill revenge killer, with excellent coverage and a high Speed. Choice Scarf Infernape still has basic offensive utility, for example, the ability to OHKO Tyranitar and Blissey, but its overall damage output is noticeably lower than that of the other sets, to the point where Infernape will struggle to damage Pokemon that aren't weak to its STAB moves. Infernape has good enough coverage to target most of OU for super effective damage; Close Combat smashes a multitude of Pokemon weak to Fighting, such as Tyranitar, Heatran, Terrakion, and Blissey, and Fire Blast incinerates various Pokemon weak to Fire, such as Celebi, Scizor, Skarmory, and Jirachi. U-turn is a staple on this set, as it practically eliminates the need to predict after you've brought Infernape in on something it can force out, and will usually net you a switch advantage. Hidden Power Ice allows Infernape to revenge kill Pokemon that are 4x weak to Ice, and is effective at stopping Dragon Dance users such as Dragonite and Salamence. Stone Edge offers similar coverage but targets specific Pokemon weak to Rock, namely Volcarona and Gyarados.</p> <p>The listed EVs allow Infernape to OHKO Garchomp, Salamence, Landorus-T, and offensive Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice, and guarantee the OHKO on Terrakion with Close Combat after Stealth Rock. If Stone Edge is used in place of Hidden Power Ice, a physically offensive spread (252 Atk / 252 Spe) with Flare Blitz over Fire Blast should be used. Attack-boosting natures are discouraged, as Naive Choice Scarf Infernape actually Speed ties with Choice Scarf Keldeo and Terrakion. Thunder Punch covers most of the Pokemon that are hit super effectively by Stone Edge, and is more accurate and deals decent damage to bulky Water-types, especially Gyarados.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types and Dragon-types are the bane of this set, as Choice Scarf Infernape is usually walled by either type, and in some cases can be set up on. Celebi can easily handle Water-types, and a Steel-type (e.g. Jirachi and Scizor) or a fast Dragon-type of your own (e.g. Latias and Latios) can be used to check opposing Dragons. Rain teams with Fighting-type resists completely shut this set down, so countermeasures should be taken to deal with them. Examples of this include Celebi, Politoed trappers such as Magma Storm Heatran, and a weather condition of your own (e.g. sun or sand). Choice Scarf Infernape works particularly well on sun teams as a late-game sweeper or utility Choice Scarf user, but it's viable (albeit slightly mediocre) on non-sun teams.</p> "

  "Seismitoad": {
    "overview": "<p>Seismitoad has an interesting niche in BW OU as an anti-metagame supporter that can stop VoltTurn users such as Rotom-W. Refresh is the move Seismitoad's counterpart, Gastrodon, wishes it had, as blocking Will-O-Wisp is normally enough to prevent VoltTurn teams' progress. Seismitoad is also capable of walling the vast majority of the bulky Water-types in the metagame, making it a valid choice for some sand and rain teams. Its biggest problem is its lack of recovery outside of Leftovers and Rest, since even its good defensive stats are not perfect and switching into the wrong move is normally enough to put Seismitoad into KO range of the biggest OU threats, like Latios, Garchomp, and Alakazam.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Earth Power is similar to Earthquake and doesn't require a Speed-reducing nature, but it has a little less power, which can be an issue against Substitute Kyurem or Calm Mind Keldeo. Ice Punch is an option to not be setup fodder for Dragonite, Garchomp, and specially defensive Gliscor, and to deal some damage to Breloom, Celebi, and Amoonguss, but a valuable moveslot is used for it, and Seismitoad isn't OHKOing the Dragon- and Flying-types or 2HKOing the Grass-types anyway. Rest can be used over Refresh, but Seismitoad will never have an opportunity to wake up, so Heal Bell or Aromatherapy support is needed. Gastro Acid is a surprise option that has potential, since it nullifies Breloom and Gliscor's Poison Heal, Reuniclus's Magic Guard, and the Water immunities of Gastrodon, Jellicent, and opposing Seismitoad, but it is difficult to find a moveslot for it. A specially defensive or mixed defensive set is possible to better handle hits from Alakazam, Thundurus-T, and offensive Starmie, but Seismitoad will usually be taking strong physical hits, so having more Defense is normally ideal.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Poison Heal Breloom doesn't care about anything Seismitoad can do except for the rare Gastro Acid and can use it as setup fodder for Swords Dance, Bulk Up, or Substitute. Ferrothorn threatens Seismitoad away with Power Whip, which lets it safely set Spikes or Stealth Rock or use Knock Off, but it's deathly afraid of getting burned and having its item removed. Celebi can shrug off a Scald burn with Natural Cure, threaten a KO with Leaf Storm or Giga Drain, set up Stealth Rock, or use Seismitoad as setup fodder for Nasty Plot, Swords Dance, or Substitute. Amoonguss threatens an immediate KO with Giga Drain and can heal away the passive damage with Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon: Storm Drain Gastrodon can use Recover to outlast Seismitoad. Jellicent can heal HP with Water Absorb, burn Seismitoad with Will-O-Wisp, deal significant damage with Night Shade, and shut it down with Taunt. Opposing Seismitoad can beat your Seismitoad if they have Knock Off or Earthquake, or the rarer Gastro Acid, and yours doesn't. Toxicroak can set up Swords Dance or Substitute versus any Seismitoad that doesn't have Ground-type coverage. Defensive Starmie can use Rapid Spin against Seismitoad forever if it lacks Toxic and can also threaten it away with Psychic, Psyshock, or Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Reuniclus can use Seismitoad to set up Calm Mind or Trick Room with no penalty outside of the uncommon Knock Off. Latias and Keldeo can easily set up Calm Mind or Substitute versus Seismitoad. With maximum Special Defense investment, Gliscor takes little damage from Scald and can use Seismitoad to set up Swords Dance or remove its item with Knock Off. Dragonite with Substitute and Dragon Dance can freely set up versus any variation of Seismitoad, since even Ice Punch does mediocre damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Powerful special attackers like Alakazam, Latios, and Hydreigon threaten a 2HKO with their STAB moves. Thundurus-T and Tornadus threaten an OHKO with Grass Knot but don't want to directly switch into Scald. Kyurem can use Seismitoad to safely set up Substitute and then punish it with its STAB moves. Keldeo can OHKO Seismitoad with Hidden Power Grass or deal great damage with Secret Sword boosted by Choice Specs or Fighting Gem. Heatran can grab a surprise KO with Hidden Power Grass or Sunny Day + SolarBeam.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald's most important function is fishing for burns, which lets Seismitoad not be entry hazard fodder for Skarmory and Ferrothorn, since they hate being burned on the switch. Refresh is what makes Seismitoad so valuable, since negating Toxic, Toxic Spikes, and Will-O-Wisp allows Seismitoad to neutralize bulky Water-types like Rotom-W, Politoed, Tentacruel, Milotic, and defensive Starmie. The primary use of Protect is to stack Leftovers recovery and sand damage, but it also lets Seismitoad scout Choice-locked Pokemon like Latios, Tyranitar, and Garchomp. Stealth Rock is an amazing option, as Seismitoad can pressure all spinners with the combination of Scald + Refresh and free up a moveslot for its teammates. Alternatively, Knock Off can make progress by removing items, making foes like Ferrothorn, Refresh Politoed, and opposing Seismitoad unable to regain health with Leftovers. Earthquake can be used to damage other Water-types—especially Keldeo, break Kyurem's Substitute, OHKO Heatran if it's not maximum HP, and damage Toxicroak. However, it lacks any other important targets, since Seismitoad has mediocre offensive stats, and forces it to run a Relaxed nature. Toxic can also be used in the last moveslot to deal with other Water-immune Pokemon, like Gastrodon and Jellicent, and to not be overly dependent on Scald burns to make progress. Dropping Protect for another support move is possible but never recommended, since losing the stability it provides alongside Leftovers hurts Seismitoad a lot in the long run.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>28 Speed EVs are used to outspeed standard specially defensive Heatran. 248 HP and 232 Defense EVs with a Bold nature prevent Seismitoad from being 2HKOed by Jolly Sand Force Excadrill's Earthquake after Protect. If running Earthquake, use 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD with a Relaxed nature.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Do not waste any opportunity to bring Seismitoad safely to the field, since almost every team has a bulky Water-type. Spam Scald against Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Jirachi, and Tentacruel, as burns are the main way for Seismitoad to threaten them. Use Refresh as soon as Seismitoad gets inflicted with status so to not waste any HP. Do not let common Substitute users go unpunished, as Seismitoad attracts them, oftentimes being unable to break the Substitute of Pokemon like Breloom and Keldeo. Going for Scald to burn the foe or outright switching to achieve an advantageous position is best in these scenarios. Avoid using Protect too predictably. If using Stealth Rock, bring Seismitoad in as soon as possible to set it up. If using Knock Off, do not be afraid to predict switches, since its best targets in Ferrothorn, Latios, Jellicent, and Reuniclus love to switch into Seismitoad. Refresh, Stealth Rock, and Knock Off are Seismitoad's advantages over Gastrodon, so it should use them to their fullest.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since Seismitoad loves the chip damage sand provides, Tyranitar is one of its best partners, and it also Pursuit traps problematic Psychic-types like Latios and Reuniclus. Pokemon that can deal with Ferrothorn like Heatran, Breloom, Magnezone, and Xatu are a must, since Ferrothorn can use Seismitoad as entry hazard fodder. Xatu especially is an amazing partner for an anti-metagame core, shutting down entry hazard stacking and helping Seismitoad with Reflect support. Magnezone invalidates any free switch in that Ferrothorn or Skarmory tries to grab versus Seismitoad. Because Seismitoad is a bit passive, it loves having Spikes support from Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Skarmory. Offensive Pokemon that can benefit from Seismitoad's ability to nullify Rotom-W like Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Garchomp are also amazing partners. Pokemon that have ways to deal with Reuniclus like Latios, Scizor, Encore Alakazam, and Nasty Plot Celebi are needed on the team. Bulky Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Skarmory can help deal with Adamant Excadrill. Seismitoad can be used in rain structures to neuter Rotom-W, which is normally a nightmare for rain teams. In those, partners like Gyarados, Tentacruel, Scizor, Breloom, Latios, Latias, and Jirachi are good options.</p> "

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>There is no Pokemon in BW OU with the same effectiveness as a supporter as Ferrothorn. With a great defensive typing, good stats, and a fantastic support movepool that includes Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Knock Off, it is an invaluable addition to offensive and defensive teams alike. The ability to absorb powerful hits from and check Dragon-type attackers like Latios, Kyurem-B, Dragonite, and Salamence gives Ferrothorn many opportunities to switch in, as does its ability to take powerful Water-type attacks like Hydro Pump from Choice Specs Keldeo and Starmie. Once in, it can set entry hazards, remove the foe's item, or use either of its two powerful STAB moves. However, it must always watch out for a Scald burn from bulky Water-types and Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W and Jellicent, since being burned greatly reduces its utility. Burn is so fundamental in breaking Ferrothorn that most rain teams spam Scald versus it just to fish for the 30% burn chance. Ferrothorn must also watch out for Trick Latios, since being Choice-locked basically removes it from the game. Its other drawbacks are its Fighting weakness, 4x Fire weakness, and lack of reliable recovery.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Lum Berry or Rawst Berry can be used to nullify a burn from Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp or Politoed's Scald before immediately retaliating with Power Whip. Shed Shell can be used on more defensive teams to let Ferrothorn Spikes stack with no fear of Magnezone, but the lack of Leftovers recovery cripples its ability to check Pokemon like Choice Specs Latios, and Shed Shell also forces it to play more conservatively versus Knock Off users so it doesn't lose to Magnet Pull. Rocky Helmet can be used on more offensive teams to better punish U-turn from Landorus-T and Rapid Spin from Excadrill and Tentacruel, but normally Ferrothorn gets more use from another item. Chople Berry can be used to survive a hit from Keldeo or Terrakion and KO back with Power Whip, but the lack of Leftovers recovery again makes Ferrothorn struggle in some matches. Protect can be used to stack Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery and scout opposing Choice item users, but it is difficult to fit on Ferrothorn's moveset. Endeavor has some merit on more offensive teams to keep pressuring the opposing team after a couple of entry hazards are down, but this is heavily dependent on good predictions. In the opposite direction, Rest can be used to fully restore Ferrothorn's utility and remove status, since some teams have difficulty in dealing with it outside of stalling for a burn, but in most games Ferrothorn doesn't have the free time necessary to wake up from the sleep. A Impish or Relaxed nature with 48 or 88 Defense EVs can be used to have more balanced defenses, but Ferrothorn normally prefers being able to better enter against Choice Specs Latios. With this in mind, a set with a Careful or Sassy nature and 252 Special Defense EVs to optimize the Latios matchup is possible, but this leaves Ferrothorn a bit vulnerable to Earthquake from Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill. More offensive sets with Choice Band or Swords Dance are possible but not worth using, since this function is better executed by other Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Magnezone: Magnezone can trap Ferrothorn with Magnet Pull and defeat it in any weather with Hidden Power Fire and Sunny Day or use it as setup fodder with Substitute and Charge Beam.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran resists both of Ferrothorn's STAB moves and threatens it out with a Fire-type move, allowing it to set up Stealth Rock or a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Thundurus-T</strong>: Thundurus-T resists both of Ferrothorn's STAB moves and can safely set up a Substitute versus Ferrothorn that lack Gyro Ball. Further, it can set up with Agility or Nasty Plot versus any Ferrothorn variant and threaten it out with Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Reuniclus</strong>: Reuniclus can set up Calm Mind with almost no risk versus Ferrothorn, since Power Whip isn't a 2HKO. It can also set up Trick Room easily and threaten to KO Ferrothorn with a Life Orb-boosted Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Getting Ferrothorn burned is one of the best ways to deal with it, since burn reduces its Attack stat to mediocre levels and puts it on a timer. Will-O-Wisp users like Rotom-W and Mew threaten Ferrothorn, as do Scald burns, which are the only way for defensive Water-types like Politoed, Tentacruel, and support Starmie to deal with it. Tentacruel deserves a special mention, since Substitute Tentacruel always defeats Ferrothorn if the rain is up. Also, having Spikes on the field heavily reduces the number of times Ferrothorn can switch in, especially if it was hit by Knock Off, reducing its effectiveness as a supporter throughout the game.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Breloom can switch into Ferrothorn, set up a Substitute, and use a boosting move or threaten it out with Drain Punch. However, it must beware of Knock Off and Thunder Wave if its Toxic Orb hasn't activated, as well as Gyro Ball and Worry Seed. Strong Fighting-types like Keldeo and Terrakion threaten an immediate KO with Secret Sword or Close Combat, respectively. Mienshao forces Ferrothorn out immediately with High Jump Kick, and Toxicroak can use Ferrothorn as Substitute fodder, since it can outstall Gyro Ball's PP with rain support.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Moves: Outside of rain, Fire-types like Volcarona and Victini and Pokemon that can use powerful Fire-type moves like Garchomp, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon can immediately threaten Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Pokemon like Jellicent, Skarmory, and Mew can nullify almost all of Ferrothorn's impact by preventing Spikes, Stealth Rock, or other support moves with Taunt. They are also not bothered by Ferrothorn's attacking moves because of their typings or access to Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Trick: Pokemon like Latios and Latias can cripple Ferrothorn by passing it a Choice Specs, Choice Scarf, or Flame Orb.</p> <p><strong>Xatu: Xatu's Magic Bounce blocks any entry hazards from Ferrothorn, and it can enter on any of Ferrothorn's moves and outstall it with the combination of Reflect, Roost, and Night Shade.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Standard",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Since Ferrothorn is the best Spikes user in the tier, Spikes is mandatory on all of its movesets, and the move also gives it something to do after switching in on a foe that can't touch it. Knock Off's main functions are crippling opposing Ferrothorn blocking it from hazard stacking while recovering HP with Leftovers and discouraging Breloom and Gliscor from switching in for fear of having their Toxic Orbs removed. Knock Off also makes Heatran and Thundurus-T, two notorious Ferrothorn checks, afraid of switching in directly, since both of them hate losing Leftovers. If your team has other ways of dealing with opposing Ferrothorn, Leech Seed is an option to deal passive damage and heal, but it can be dangerous, since there are a lot of Substitute users in the tier and it gives Grass-types and Magic Guard users a free switch-in. Power Whip and Gyro Ball are Ferrothorn's best attacking options, hitting the majority of the standard metagame for at least neutral damage. Each of these two moves has its merits; the former primarily slams Water-types, such as Rotom-W, Jellicent, Starmie, Politoed, and Keldeo, and punishes Excadrill and Tentacruel that try to use Rapid Spin. The latter is generally more effective against faster Pokemon and those that resist Power Whip such as Latios, Dragonite, Kyurem-B, and Breloom and, unlike Power Whip, it breaks a Substitute from Thundurus-T. Be aware that Gyro Ball has low PP. Because Ferrothorn's Attack stat is less than impressive without any investment, there are several alternatives to running both attacking moves. Stealth Rock is a good option, since Ferrothorn can enter several times in a match to lay entry hazards, and using it also frees up your teammates' moveslots. Worry Seed puts pressure on Gliscor and Breloom that will try to set up on Ferrothorn and wins the matchup against opposing Ferrothorn when used after Knock Off. Worry Seed also lets Ferrothorn escape Magnezone's Magnet Pull; this is most effective in rain, which forces Magnezone to either use a weakened Hidden Power Fire or give Ferrothorn a free Worry Seed turn by using Sunny Day. If those moves are not needed, Thunder Wave has merit as a method of crippling faster powerful threats that often enjoy switching into Ferrothorn, but it doesn't pair well with Gyro Ball.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With a Careful nature, 208 Special Defense EVs optimize Ferrothorn's bulk and let it survive three Draco Meteors from Choice Specs Latios so it has more opportunities to lay Spikes. If using Gyro Ball, then a Sassy nature with 0 Speed IVs is optimal.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Let Ferrothorn absorb hard-hitting special moves like Draco Meteor from Latios to have opportunities to lay entry hazards. Use Ferrothorn as an opposing Ferrothorn check if your team has difficulties with it; Knock Off is Ferrothorn's second most important move in this situation. Keeping opposing Ferrothorn from recovering HP via Leftovers is extremely helpful in all games. You can also double switch Ferrothorn into a Pokemon that doesn't like to stomach a Power Whip, like Rotom-W or Politoed, so it can use Spikes or Knock Off freely. Take advantage of Ferrothorn's defensive capabilities early-game to lay entry hazards or cripple opposing Pokemon as quickly as possible. Pay attention to whether Iron Barbs damage can prevent Rapid Spin or U-turn spam from opposing Pokemon. Try to avoid getting Ferrothorn burned, since it reduces a lot of its defensive and support potential by putting it on a timer and making its attacks very weak. Be wary of Tentacruel when the rain is up, as it can easily defeat Ferrothorn if it successfully fishes for a Scald burn, and Substitute Tentacruel can PP stall Power Whip and win the matchup with no trouble at all.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rotom-W adds another Water-type check to the team, especially for Keldeo, and helps Ferrothorn by bringing it in safely via Volt Switch or burning opposing Pokemon like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Excadrill, and opposing Ferrothorn. Other Keldeo checks and switch-ins to Fire-type moves like Jellicent, Tentacruel, Gastrodon, Slowking, and Seismitoad are also very good partners. Jellicent in particular makes an interesting combination with Ferrothorn, since they together resist every attacking type in the game outside of Flying and Ground. Jellicent is also capable of spinblocking after Ferrothorn sets entry hazards. Ferrothorn also benefits from teammates that can scare off the Steel-types that give it trouble, namely Skarmory, Heatran, and Excadrill. Landorus-T and Gliscor are awesome partners, since both can check Excadrill, check Fighting-types like Terrakion, and free up Ferrothorn's Stealth Rock moveslot, letting it to be more effective in the match. Politoed also deserves a special mention, since Ferrothorn has formidable defensive synergy with rain teams; its Fire weakness is halved, and it is an awesome Dragon sponge for rain teams. Hard-hitting Pokemon like Latios, Alakazam, Reuniclus, Thundurus-T, Keldeo, Terrakion, Garchomp, and Tyranitar love the extra damage Spikes provides, which makes most 3HKOs become 2HKOs and 2HKOs become OHKOs. Latios particularly is one of Ferrothorn's best teammates, helping keep Keldeo and Heatran in check and loving the Spikes and Knock Off support Ferrothorn provides.</p> "

  "Chandelure": {
    "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced around the time BW was the main generation. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to the current BW OU metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Chandelure is a mixed bag in many ways. It sports an incredible 145 base Special Attack, but its other base stats are much less impressive, especially considering that it is vulnerable to Stealth Rock and sandstorm damage. While its typing is solid offensively, especially in the sun, it also gives Chandelure key weaknesses that attract dangerous threats such as Terrakion and Landorus-T, all of whom can easily revenge kill, or even set up on, the rather slow Chandelure. Nonetheless, the luring Pokemon has some useful immunities to Fire-, Fighting-, and Normal-type attacks. Overall, a team's inclusion of this peculiar cocktail of wallbreaking power and vulnerability to revenge kills can be very rewarding with solid back-up and careful switching.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Two unmentioned moves that may come to mind are Flame Charge and Will-O-Wisp. Indeed, Flame Charge seems like a perfect move to fix Chandelure's Speed, but Volcarona is generally better at this because it is faster, stronger, and specially bulkier after a single Quiver Dance boost than Chandelure is after a Flame Charge boost. A Will-O-Wisp support set seems viable until one realizes that Chandelure is about as bulky as Starmie, does not have a very reliable recovery move, and does not have the Speed, typing, or coverage to make up for its shortcomings. Heatran and Jellicent are much better for the burn supporting role due to their formidable bulk and great defensive typing; Heatran even lures many of the same Pokemon that Chandelure does.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>In the sun, there is no hard counter in the strictest sense of the word, but Tyranitar and Politoed can switch into a STAB move and cause problems with Sand Stream and Drizzle, respectively. Porygon2 also comes to mind, being immune to both of Chandelure's STAB moves if it carries Trace, though a Choice Specs or Life Orb Hidden Power Fighting will still hit it very hard. Snorlax works similarly thanks to Thick Fat giving it a resistance to Fire. If the sun isn't up, or if Chandelure lacks Choice Specs, Water-types such as Kingdra, Dragon-types such as Dragonite, and special walls such as Blissey and Chansey are great counters.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>The combination of relative frailty and middling Speed leaves Chandelure with little natural staying power, and Substitute works to fix this. Behind this precious shield, Chandelure can make great use of its awesome offensive power with no worry of being crippled by any single-hit offensive move. Very few Pokemon can take Chandelure's STAB moves very well, so this set can be particularly dangerous to offensive teams that may try to use death fodder in the hope of minimizing the damage caused. Tyranitar and Hydreigon that eagerly switch in can be duly punished with a shot or two of Hidden Power Fighting, while Pain Split can be of use if Blissey is more of an issue for the rest of the team.</p> <p>There are several factors to consider when choosing the item and nature. Timid is usually the best nature here because with it, Chandelure can outrun Timid Politoed and Adamant Dragonite. With Leftovers, 4 HP / 0 SpD Politoed can be 2HKOed by Shadow Ball much of the time (44.1% - 52.2%), and with Life Orb, 252 HP / 0 SpD Dragonite is 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage. With Leftovers, a Modest nature does not guarantee a 2HKO on 252 HP / 252 SpD Careful Tyranitar with Hidden Power Fighting (44.6% - 52.5%), but it does guarantee it on 252 HP / 76 SpD Careful Tyranitar (50.5% - 60.4%) where Timid does not (46.5% - 55.4%). This consideration is, of course, moot with Life Orb. Finally, when considering Life Orb, one should strongly consider the residual damage that Chandelure will be taking from Stealth Rock, Spikes, and sandstorm, on top of the Substitute damage.</p> <p>The main purpose of Substitute Chandelure is to make the most out of one switch-in, so the focus of its teammates should be to maximize the opportunities for it to switch in and set up a Substitute. Virizion is a good example of a teammate that can lure in opposing Pokemon carrying strong Fire- and Ice-type moves on which Chandelure can capitalize. Hydreigon is another great example, luring in Fighting- and Ice-type attacks, and allowing a free switch-in for Chandelure with U-turn. However, Hydreigon may also attract strong Dragon-type attackers, such as Latios and Salamence.</p> <p>It is helpful to minimize the residual damage done to Chandelure. If its team is not directly utilizing sandstorm or hail, Ninetales's Drought is a good way to negate weather damage, and boosts the power of Chandelure's Fire Blast. A Rapid Spin user is another possibility, as Chandelure is vulnerable to all entry hazards. Forretress is a particularly good option for this role because it can lure in Fire-type attacks on which Chandelure can switch in. Conversely, entry hazards not only help Chandelure to land KOs, but also potentially lure in Forretress, whose attempts to use Rapid Spin Chandelure can block (though Starmie will still pose problems).</p> <p>One of the big draws of this set is that it can remove or cripple Tyranitar fairly easily. Doing this in conjunction with another weather inducer will largely neuter sand-reliant opponents. Additionally, the opponent will have lost a great specially defensive, mixed offensive tank. This opens up opportunities for a variety of special attackers, such as Heatran, and walls, such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Chandelure is an extremely powerful wallbreaker who can leave most opponents really hurting. STAB Fire / Ghost is complemented nicely by Hidden Power Fighting and Energy Ball, the former mainly for Tyranitar and Hydreigon, and the latter mainly for Water-type switch-ins such as Politoed. Immunity to the very common Fire- and Fighting-type attacks is extremely helpful for switching in, and Chandelure can spinblock against Forretress.</p> <p>Sunny weather is where Chandelure truly shines. Its Overheat becomes absurdly strong, surpassed only by Sheer Force Darmanitan's Flare Blitz and Solar Power Charizard's Fire Blast, and its Fire Blast is almost as strong, though it does fall short of Victini's V-create and Heatran's Eruption. Unlike Darmanitan and Charizard, however, Chandelure suffers no recoil or recoil-like damage and has useful immunities to Fighting and Fire. This means that, barring entry hazard damage, Chandelure can potentially switch in multiple times and keep firing off its Fire-type STAB.</p> <p>The following calculations aim to demonstrate the sheer power of Choice Specs Chandelure in the sun:</p> <p>Modest Overheat:</p> <ul> <li>vs 4/0 Latios: 93.4% - 109.9% (OHKO after Stealth Rock) <li>vs 248/8 Gyarados: 77.1% - 90.8% (OHKO after Stealth Rock)</li> <li>vs 252/252+ Dragonite: 56.7% - 66.8% (2HKO after Stealth Rock + Leftovers)</li> <li>vs 248/0 Jellicent: 72.5% - 82.4% (2HKO)</li> <li>vs 252/0 Latias: 66.8% - 78.8% (2HKO)</li> <li>vs 252/0 Blissey: 65.7% - 77.5% (2HKO, guaranteed after Stealth Rock + Leftovers)</li> <li>vs 252/0 Chansey: 55.4% - 65.2% (2HKO after Stealth Rock + Spikes)</li> <li>vs 4/0 Kingdra: 54.5% - 64.0% (2HKO after Stealth Rock + Spikes + Leftovers)</li> </ul> <p>This means that the problem of missing 2HKOs is largely not a factor when choosing between Overheat and Fire Blast. Instead, Overheat vs Fire Blast is mostly a matter of accuracy vs the ability to stay in on revenge kills. However, even -2 Overheat is quite powerful in the sun, more so than many other attacks.</p> <p>Speed EVs can be adjusted to outpace certain threats. The listed EV spread outruns 252 Spe Politoed while rounding down Stealth Rock damage; 152 Spe Modest still outruns 216 Spe Timid Magnezone while rounding down Stealth Rock damage, and 224 Spe Modest outruns 208 Spe Naive Cloyster. A Timid nature misses out on some of the above mentioned KOs, making Fire Blast more favored.</p> <p>Ninetales is an almost required teammate considering the power boost that it gives, as well as the removal of many of Chandelure's drawbacks. Grass-types such as Virizion and Steel-types such as Scizor tend to be good teammates not just for Chandelure but for a sun team as a whole, due to their good match-ups against Tyranitar, Politoed, and weather abusers in general. Ferrothorn is particularly promising because it is blessed with both types, and Chandelure's typing complements Ferrothorn's very well. Additionally, Ferrothorn's Spikes can guarantee 2HKOs on Chansey and Kingdra if Modest Overheat is being used. A Rapid Spinner such as Forretress can be very helpful, though many do not fare very well against Jellicent. Although Chandelure can 2HKO specially defensive Tyranitar with Hidden Power Fighting, it will definitely appreciate a different teammate to deal with this very common threat, such as Conkeldurr or Gliscor, both of whom also deal with common revenge killers effectively. Offensively, sweepers such as Volcarona highly appreciate the removal of the aforementioned threats.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>While Chandelure is not necessarily slow, adding a Choice Scarf turns it into an extremely effective revenge killer. At 387 Speed, this allows it to outspeed a sizable portion of the unboosted metagame, as well as a small selection of Choice Scarf users. Chandelure's power is greatly boosted by sunshine, and defensive sun teams will enjoy having a Chandelure around to crush opposing sweepers, and even though this set lacks the nuclear power of the Choice Specs variant, it'll still hit hard enough to be an effective deterrent. Chandelure's typing and reasonable defenses can give it many opportunities to switch in, which means that you may not necessarily be waiting for a revenge kill, but instead switching into a safe attack and then striking back at the opponent for a handy KO, regardless of whether they switch. The only real choice to make on this set is between Fire Blast and Overheat. While Overheat suits the nature of a Choice item more, in having to attack then switch instantly, Chandelure is not the sort of Pokemon that likes to keep jumping in and out. As a result, Fire Blast is a preferred choice, as Chandelure can switch in, Fire Blast away more than once to whittle down the opposing team, and then switch out to safety.</p> <p>Without a doubt, Water-types (especially in the rain) and Tyranitar are Chandelure's biggest problems. Fortunately, if used on a sun-based team, Chandelure will have an abundance of Grass-type teammates ready to take these threats down. This will make Chandelure's sweep easier, and give your defensive Pokemon a much easier time. Other team support comes obviously as follows: Ninetales provides endless sunshine; Steel-types such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Forretress lure in many Fire-type moves from which Chandelure can obtain a Flash Fire boost; and Pokemon such as Dragonite, Salamence, and Gliscor lure in Ice-type attacks and take down specially defensive Pokemon that are causing problems for Chandelure. Finally, due to being locked into one attack, Chandelure is likely to be switching in and out a lot. Being weak to Stealth Rock, this can be problematic for the longevity of Chandelure. Blissey is an effective provider of Wish, and can sponge many of the special Water-type attacks aimed at Chandelure.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>While Calm Mind Chandelure faces stiff competition with other special sweepers, particularly Volcarona, it holds the distinction of being able to 2HKO 252 HP / 0 SpD Blissey and Chansey in the sun after just one boost. It is also somewhat bulkier than Volcarona and does not suffer nearly as much from Stealth Rock. While the Substitute and Choice Scarf sets lack the power to break through defensive checks, and the Choice Specs set is horribly vulnerable to maneuvers involving Protect or death fodder, Calm Mind Chandelure suffers from neither of these issues, able to attain wallbreaking power or launch an attack without worrying about being locked into the wrong move. However, the need to OHKO the opponent is more pressing due to the turn spent boosting. A middling base 80 Speed doesn't help matters, making Chandelure vulnerable to a host of faster attackers.</p> <p>If using Life Orb, Flamethrower is sufficient, albeit barely, to 2HKO Chansey and Blissey in the sun after Stealth Rock damage. Substitute is suggested mainly to block status and set up on Blissey and Chansey, while Hidden Power Fighting can be used to KO Tyranitar. Substitute is a great move in general to compensate for the lack of recovery, but using it on a Life Orb set is unwise due to the large amount of self-inflicted damage that would result.</p> <p>The choice of item and nature brings significant consequences to Chandelure's utility on a team. A Timid nature allows Chandelure to outrun Timid Politoed and Adamant Dragonite, but a Life Orb is required to OHKO either of them with Shadow Ball and Stealth Rock after a Calm Mind boost (86.3% min for 4 HP / 0 SpD Politoed, 71.8% - 84.7% for 252 HP / 0 SpD Dragonite). A Modest nature is plausible to try to OHKO 252 HP / 252 SpD Careful Tyranitar after Stealth Rock damage and one round of Leftovers recovery (84.2% min) while guaranteeing the OHKO on 252 HP / 76 SpD Careful Tyranitar under the same conditions (99% min). Leftovers exchanges all of these KOs for a much more lasting presence that emphasizes breaking defensive teams. In this case, Fire Blast is the preferred STAB to ensure the 2HKO on Blissey and Chansey.</p> <p>Chandelure's main concerns are landing OHKOs and not fizzling out before doing anything useful. For the former, Stealth Rock and Spikes are very valuable to ensure the OHKOs on Politoed and Tyranitar, especially if Chandelure has a Timid nature. Steel-types, such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Bronzong, and Jirachi, are excellent for setting up hazards because they attract Fire-type attacks into which Chandelure can switch. For the latter, Rapid Spin users, such as Forretress, come to mind due to Chandelure's Stealth Rock weakness. Ninetales helps to fulfill both requirements, powering up Chandelure's STAB moves enough to beat Blissey and Chansey while removing the residual damage from sandstorm.</p> "

        "name": "Sunny Day",
        "description": "<p>Through the use of Sunny Day, Chandelure can get past some of its usual checks and counters, such as Politoed and Tyranitar, while providing a sun team with a valuable backup sun inducer or a weatherless team with a way to combat opposing weather. Fire Blast is Chandelure's main weapon, hitting incredibly hard with boosts from Life Orb and sunlight. This variant is also notable for performing better against bulky Water-types than most of the standard Chandelure sets due to a strong Solar Beam and weaker Scalds. Shadow Ball is an option over Solar Beam to hit Latios and Latias, both of which otherwise wall this set when sun isn't in play. The last slot belongs to a Hidden Power; Hidden Power Ground can be used to reliably hit Fire-types that resist Solar Beam and Fire Blast, but barring Fire Blast's accuracy, it is only really useful for Heatran, as a sun-boosted Fire Blast can still KO most of the Fire-types in OU. Hidden Power Fighting can be used to hit Heatran as well, and it's also a reliable option for hitting Tyranitar on the switch. Chandelure can run both Solar Beam and Shadow Ball, but should only do so if your team has reliable means of removing or exploiting the opponent's Heatran, such as Terrakion.</p> <p>Timid is the recommended nature as it allows Chandelure to outspeed Timid Politoed and Adamant Dragonite. However, Modest can be used if more power in general is desired or if your team doesn't fear Dragonite and Politoed. Life Orb is the main item option as with it, Chandelure can OHKO 252/76+ Tyranitar with a Modest Hidden Power Fighting when sand isn't up. Leftovers is an option for durability, and it helps compensate for Chandelure's Stealth Rock weakness. Although Fire Blast can OHKO certain variants of Dragonite and Salamence after Stealth Rock, it's inaccurate, so Hidden Power Ice can be used to reliably hit them. However, Hidden Power Ice should only be used against Salamence and Dragonite, as a sun-boosted Fire Blast will hit Latios, Latias, and Haxorus harder. Pain Split can be used to recover off Life Orb and Stealth Rock damage from common switch-ins such as Blissey, but this leaves Chandelure easily walled. Memento and Heat Rock give Chandelure a more supportive role as they can be used to aid a sun sweeper's setup or to provide a sun sweeper with a large enough window to sweep. Memento can also be useful in situations where you know Chandelure is going to die to Stealth Rock. Expert Belt can be used for a balance between power and durability; it also allows Chandelure to bluff a Choice item. Colbur Berry eases prediction against Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar and Snorlax. Air Balloon grants Chandelure a third immunity, meaning it has more switch-in opportunities, but Chandelure will severely miss the power from Life Orb or the recovery from Leftovers.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support gives Chandelure more chances to switch in. Forretress is a good choice for a spinner as it can also provide hazards, which can net Chandelure more KOs. Forretress also serves as bait for Flash Fire boosts. Ninetales can be used as a partner so Chandelure can hit Water-types with Solar Beam right away. Because it's weak to Stealth Rock, Chandelure loathes residual damage from sand or hail, which Ninetales eliminates upon entry as opposed to having Chandelure remove it itself. Since Chandelure could get rapidly worn down by Stealth Rock, Life Orb, and any other possible residual damage, Chansey could be used as a Wish passer, as it appreciates Chandelure removing sand and hail. Chandelure can also switch into Fighting-type attacks aimed at Chansey. Finally, due to Chandelure's mediocre Speed, paralysis support can be used to aid a sweep. Chansey is a good candidate for spreading paralysis for reasons mentioned above.</p> "

  "Volcarona": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written a long time ago. As such, information regarding this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW OU metagame in general may no longer be accurate. A <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/volcarona-qc-0-2.3685491/\">revamp</a> is currently being worked on for this analysis.</p> <hr /> <p>As one of the few vanguards of two oft-maligned types in OU, Volcarona is one hot Pokemon. Despite what would normally be considered a crippling Bug / Fire typing, Volcarona has the perfect combination of stats, movepool, and typing to make it a top-tier threat. With a whopping 135 base Special Attack, 100 base Speed, great dual STAB, and access to one of the best boosting moves in the game in Quiver Dance, Volcarona has everything it needs to make a huge impact. While it operates best in the sun, it can even take charge in the rain, and still has plenty of tools in sand as well.</p> <p>That said, even with everything Volcarona has going for it, it's not some kind of magic bullet in the metagame. It's quite frail on the physical side, and while it resists most of the priority attacks in the metagame, it's still hard-pressed to deal with anything it can't kill in one hit or outspeed. It also possesses a crippling Stealth Rock weakness, so if it doesn't sweep the first time through, it rarely gets a second chance. Still, if it gets any space to do its thing, it can make any game a runaway. The game is never over when Volcarona's around.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Specs set with U-turn can be utilized effectively. Volcarona's massive 135 base Special Attack lets it power through pretty much anything, and U-turn can be extremely useful to capitalize on Volcarona's tendency to force switches. However, a Choice set on a Pokemon with a 4x Stealth Rock weakness is rather suspect, so it has to be played with care. A mono attacker with Sunny Day, Quiver Dance, Fire Blast, and either Roost or Morning Sun can be effective, especially against Rain teams. Between Quiver Dance and Sunny Day, Volcarona can almost set up in the face of opposing Water-types, and Politoed fails to put a damper on Volcarona's sweep potential. Finally, a straight offensive set with dual STAB, a coverage move, and Roost can be used for a Starmie-esque set. Volcarona is remarkably bulky, and being able to heal off residual damage can keep Volcarona in the fight for a remarkably long time.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>With its 4x weakness, Stealth Rock is easily Volcarona's biggest check in OU. It's hard for Volcarona to set up at 50% HP, and even harder at 1% if it's forced out. Keeping Stealth Rock on the field is the easiest way to reduce Volcarona's effectiveness in the long term. Terrakion in the sand is probably the most significant check, as it resists both STABs and has super effective Rock STAB to take it out. It can also outspeed +1 Volcarona with Choice Scarf, or simply sponge an attack and set up a Rock Polish. Heatran is also especially effective, as it's essentially immune to both STABs. However, Hidden Power Ground can be troublesome, and if Heatran is the only Volcarona check on the team, this can make it especially deadly. Chansey can wall Volcarona effectively outside of the sun, but with sun support, Volcarona can muscle through with Fire Blast, so be careful. Toxic on Chansey can make it more effective, putting a death timer on more defensively oriented sets. Snorlax has huge HP and Special Defense, resists Fire with its Thick Fat ability, and can slam Volcarona hard with its powerful STAB Body Slam and Return.</p> <p>There are some more nonstandard Volcarona counters out there as well. Azumarill in the rain is the ultimate counter to Volcarona, as it has plenty of bulk and a STAB Aqua Jet to deal with Volcarona. Any of the Flying-type Pokemon that resist Volcarona's dual STABs, such as Gyarados, Salamence, and Dragonite, can help deal with it, but they have to watch out for Hidden Power Rock, as well as Volcarona's raw power. Tyranitar can cancel out Drought, lay down Stealth Rock, and OHKO Volcarona with its Rock STAB, but its weakness to Bug makes it a shaky check at best and terrible if Volcarona already has some boosts.</p> <p>When not carrying Giga Drain, a check against Water-types of all stripes is suggested, especially Jellicent and Keldeo, which also resist Bug. Note that while Timid Scarf Keldeo can outspeed Volcarona, its Hydro Pump fails to OHKO at full HP, and if sun is involved, it fails to even 2HKO. As mentioned before, Tentacruel is an exceptionally good teammate, absorbing Toxic Spikes, spinning away rocks, and sponging Water-type attacks. Rain is often considered a \"counter\" to Volcarona, but in many cases, rain can be more of a liability against it. Against the standard sets, Volcarona loses its most powerful STAB while the rain exacerbates its Water weakness. However, against sets packing Hurricane and/or Giga Drain, the rain can actually be counterproductive.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Quiver Dance",
        "description": "<p>This set makes full use of Volcarona's massive offensive potential. Between an obscene 135 base Special Attack, Quiver Dance, Life Orb, and a STAB Fire Blast or Bug Buzz, Volcarona hits with nuclear force, wiping most foes off the map in one hit. Bug Buzz is the primary STAB, since it's powerful, accurate, reliable, and weather-independent. Fire Blast is the preferred secondary STAB due to its power, but Fiery Dance gives it a 100% accurate Fire-type move, as well as a 50% chance to boost its Special Attack even further. Finally, Giga Drain is the most powerful option against rain teams (and especially Politoed), and can help heal off Stealth Rock damage and preserve Volcarona's decent bulk. However, Hidden Power Ground is an option in the last slot, as it hits Heatran and Tentacruel, two common Pokemon in OU that resist Volcarona's dual STAB.</p> <p>Hidden Power Rock is a decent choice for the fourth slot, as it hits the many Fire-resistant Flying types in OU, such as Salamence, Dragonite, and Gyarados. Substitute is a solid option for sun teams that can control the weather and simply muscle through opponents and would rather have a way to gain or keep momentum. As for items, Life Orb is the preferred item, as it provides Volcarona with the power it needs to secure OHKOs with its neutral moves. However, Lum Berry can allow Volcarona to set up on Body Slam, Thunder, or Thunder Wave, and Toxic. Timid is the preferred nature for straight up speed, but if you really want to crank up the power, Modest not only guarantees that +1 Giga Drain OHKOes Choice Specs Politoed, but also combines with Life Orb to secure a 2HKO on 252/252+ Chansey in the sun with Fire Blast.</p> <p>A specialized version of this set is also viable; with a spread of 100 HP / 48 Def / 252 SpA / 108 Spe with a Modest nature and a Passho Berry, Volcarona can lure in and set up on numerous Water-types eager to counter it. Specifically with one boost, Volcarona can survive a Hydro Pump from Choice Specs Keldeo (or Choice Scarf Keldeo in the rain) without Stealth Rock, and recover its lost health with Giga Drain. An alternative spread of this is 136 HP / 16 SpA / 248 SpD / 108 Spe, which gives Volcarona an 87.5% chance of surviving Specs Keldeo's Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock at +1.</p> <p>Ninetales is the most obvious teammate, providing sunlight to fuel Volcarona's powerful Fire-type attacks. Beyond that, the main targets for teammates are anything not covered by the move in the fourth slot. With Hidden Power Ground, anything that can wear down bulky Water-types is important. This includes entry hazards, specifically Stealth Rock, since it's important to deal with dangerous Flying-types, especially the ones mentioned above. Regardless of the last move, two things are needed above all: something to deal with Chansey, and something to deal with Stealth Rock. Strong physical attackers can deal with Chansey, though they have to be wary of Toxic or getting whittled down by Seismic Toss. Stealth Rock can be eliminated by a solid user of Rapid Spin, such as Forretress (which also provides hazards of its own), Tentacruel, or Donphan, the latter of which works especially well on sun teams. It can also be kept off the field by a Magic Bounce user, such as Xatu or Espeon. Finally, a strong check to Scarf Terrakion is suggested, as it can switch in on any of the first three moves with impunity, outspeed, and OHKO Volcarona with ease. Landorus-T is an impeccable one, sponging Terrakion's attacks with relative ease, laying down Stealth Rock, and seizing momentum with U-turn.</p> "

        "name": "Hurricane",
        "description": "<p>While this bug seems like more of a sun-lover, it's perfectly at home in the rain as well. Hurricane gives it a strong attack to use in the rain, plowing through rain teams that think they've effectively neutered Volcarona. Bug / Flying is remarkably effective coverage, and when in the rain, Hurricane is one of Volcarona's strongest tools. Fire Blast may seem like an odd choice, but it wards off Skarmory, Jirachi, Forretress, and other Steel-types that would otherwise wall you in the rain, and gives dual STAB in case of sand. However, Hidden Power Water gets pseudo-STAB in the rain, and also hits a number of notable Pokemon. It KOes Terrakion in the rain at +1 with Leftovers, hits Landorus-T hard, and prevents Heatran from walling Volcarona both in and out of the rain.</p> <p>Substitute is a solid choice in the last slot, as it eases prediction and can be helpful against Heatran. Giga Drain can make Volcarona more effective against opposing rain teams, and is best used over Bug Buzz with Hurricane as the primary attack. Leftovers are the preferred item, as this is a more supportive sweeper and may need to switch in multiple times or sponge an attack or two while setting up. However, Life Orb is still a solid choice for power at all costs. Note that Hidden Power Water is most important alongside Leftovers, as Life Orb's power allows this Volcarona to pick up some crucial KOs with just its STABs and Hurricane. Since this set relies on a non-STAB Hurricane as its primary offensive tool, Modest is the preferred nature in order to squeeze out as much damage as possible. However, Timid is still effective, especially against teams where Volcarona can't pick up more than 1 boost.</p> <p>As this is a rain-based Pokemon, Politoed is an obvious supporter. However, if you're just looking for a Volcarona that takes advantage of opposing rain, Politoed isn't necessary. As with every Volcarona set, a way to keep Stealth Rock off the field is important. Forretress can also take advantage of Rain to diminish its Fire weakness, letting it take weaker Hidden Power Fires. It also provides entry hazards, which are important to allow Volcarona to achieve as many Hurricane KOs as possible. A check to Scarf Terrakion is also hugely important, as it can switch into either Quiver Dance, Fire Blast, or Bug Buzz and shut Volcarona down. Landorus-T is an exceptional offensive check to Scarf Terrakion, both threatening it and tanking its attacks with ease. Since this set is almost 100% walled by Heatran, it's important to have something that can deal with Heatran. Alternately, Tentacruel can ward off Heatran, carries Rapid Spin, and benefits greatly from the presence of rain. Finally, Starmie can resist Heatran's STAB, Recover off the damage, and spin away entry hazards.</p> "

        "name": "Bulky Quiver Dance",
        "description": "<p>While Quiver Dance makes Volcarona an absolutely incredible offensive sweeper in its own right, its combined offensive and defensive buff also makes another option available to Volcarona. 85 base HP is remarkably good, and with heavy defensive investment and Roost, Volcarona can buy itself plenty of time to boost up and blaze through the opposing team. While Volcarona is still susceptible to burst damage from offensive teams, defensive investment and Roost allows it to outlast a number of more defensive checks, and with enough Quiver Dances, Volcarona has the power to blow through pretty much everything. To top it off, the durability of this set means that Flame Body has a chance to kick in, and if the opponent's physical Volcarona check gets burned, the game could be over then and there. Bug Buzz is the primary STAB, being the most reliable offensive option that Volcarona has. Fiery Dance gets the spotlight here as well, as it allows Volcarona to keep amping up its offense once it's got a couple Quiver Dances under its belt.</p> <p>As always, Fire Blast is available if the power is really necessary, but since this set aims to set up slowly and reliably, it can afford the drop in power. A mono-attacking set is also an option, replacing either attacking move with Substitute. Fire is the preferred STAB when used alongside Ninetales, but Bug is useful for its lack of immunities. EV-wise, this set has a fairly simple spread. 16 Speed with a Timid nature allows Volcarona to outspeed base 130s at +1, or +1 base 110s at +2—the latter is especially effective for preventing Choice Scarf Latios from stopping a sweep. Defense is maximized, and the rest goes into HP, to provide the maximum physical bulk.</p> <p>As with every Volcarona set, sun support is extremely useful, as it gives Volcarona a much needed punch on its Fire attacks, and also dampens the effectiveness of Water-type attacks. This is especially notable for a set like this one, as many Water attacks will fail to outdamage Roost after a couple Quiver Dances. A Rapid Spinner is also good for removing Stealth Rock, though the presence of Roost on this set makes it somewhat less important. Screen support can allow Volcarona to get the first couple boosts under its belt, especially considering the extreme defensive investment. Finally, there's the standard Volcarona counters to deal with. Heatran is especially troublesome, so a teammate that can deal with it is important. Jellicent is also an issue, though much less of one in the sun. Additionally, strong physical attackers like Terrakion and Landorus-T can prove troublesome. For this reason, Forretress can be a useful ally, as it not only provides a check to these strong attackers, but can spin away Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes. Landorus-T also provides a strong physical check, but lacks the ability to Rapid Spin.</p> "

Against more defensive teams, this set can be devastating, as they simply don't have the firepower to deal with Volcarona quickly. With the offensive investment and powerful STABs, it can easily deliver the pain to opponents once a couple Quiver Dances are up.</p> <p>The Speed investment allows this Volcarona to outspeed base 130s at +1 and +1 base 110s at +2, which is important to outspeed Choice Scarf Latios and other fast Pokemon. Landorus-T or another similar Terrakion check is also extremely important, as no amount of Resting will stop Terrakion from coming in and destroying Volcarona with its Rock STAB. Hazards are also extremely useful, as this set often needs the extra damage to seal the deal. A Rapid Spin user is nearly obligatory, as Stealth Rock needs to be gone in order to allow Volcarona the most time to set up. Finally, wallbreakers of any stripe are useful, as this set only gets one shot at sweeping, and it needs all potential problems removed beforehand.</p> "

  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>There's so much more to Gengar's malevolent exterior—in fact, Gengar is even more terrifying in practice than its appearance. Gengar still makes a potent offensive threat in BW OU thanks to its power, unpredictability, and excellent offensive movepool. Its set of immunities help it switch into common moves with impunity, giving it ample opportunities to come in and wreak havoc. Despite Gengar's positive traits as a sweeper, it does have two notable drawbacks: its paper-thin defensive stats, which make it take massive damage even from neutral attacks, and its weakness to Dark-type moves, which leaves it vulnerable to Pursuit if it isn't hiding behind a Substitute. However, Team Preview does allow for the scouting of possible Pursuit users, making the latter drawback less threatening. Don't let Gengar's atrocious defensive stats discourage you though; its offensive potency can definitely disrupt unprepared teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With such a diverse movepool, Gengar can easily catch any of its counters off-guard with the appropriate move. Gengar can get around Chansey, its best counter, with a combination of Mean Look and Perish Song. It can also use Taunt to prevent Chansey from healing.</p> <p>Gengar can also pull off a myriad of other sets. Gengar can use a Choice Scarf very effectively thanks to its stellar Speed, high Special Attack, and great movepool, but it risks getting trapped by the likes of Tyranitar. Substitute and Focus Punch to take care of dedicated special walls like Blissey and Heatran if your team is in need of a great lure. You can combine Counter and Focus Sash for a real surprising but effective set. Thanks to Gengar's terrible defenses, pretty much any attack will OHKO it, allowing Gengar to do huge amounts of damage back with Counter. If you want to get really fancy, use Destiny Bond on the same set to get a bonus KO. Gengar's physical movepool is actually really good, unfortunately its Attack stat is not, so a completely physical set is not advised.</p> <p>In addition to the moves listed on the sets, Gengar has quite a few great attacking options to spare. Thunderbolt is a great attack in general and helps counter Skarmory. Thunder is an option if you're using a rain team, since Gengar does have a resistance to Grass. Hidden Power Ice can be used on any set to check Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Salamence. Hidden Power Fire serves as a great lure to the omnipresent Ferrothorn. Sludge Wave hits Grass-types harder but is otherwise a poor coverage option in a Steel-type ridden metagame. Energy Ball and Giga Drain are 100% accurate deterrents to Politoed and Tyranitar, but neither come close to OHKOing them. Grass-type moves would also help Gengar get around Gastrodon who does surprisingly well against Gengar. If your team is loaded with status inflictors such as Toxic Spikes, both Hex and Venoshock suddenly become viable attacks. Clear Smog and Perish Song aren't great but they're Gengar's only phazing options. Finally, Grudge can be an interesting way to mess with things like Terrakion by draining all of its Stone Edges, but moves like Destiny Bond and Disable are better for this.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gengar is one of the few Pokemon with both a great movepool and the stats to use it, which is why it's been OU since the first generation. With that said, there are still a good number of ways to get around Gengar should you encounter one. The easiest way is to use strong priority. Scizor's Bullet Punch is a clean OHKO on Gengar. Any Sucker Punch user can also score a clean OHKO against Gengar, although you must watch out for Substitute and Will-O-Wisp. Even strong neutral priority like Mamoswine's Ice Shard or Azumarill's Aqua Jet does enough to force Gengar out or KO it outright. The second best way to attack a Gengar is with a strong user of Pursuit. Scizor and Tyranitar can take Gengar's attacks and OHKO with Pursuit even if Gengar doesn't switch. Weavile and Heracross aren't seen much in OU but they can also checkmate Gengar with Pursuit.</p> <p>Gengar's defenses are so poor that any attack it doesn't resist will 3HKO it at worst. For example, Landorus-T can survive a Shadow Ball and KO with Stone Edge. Blissey's Ice Beam or Flamethrower can 3HKO Gengar, but it must watch out for sets like Pain Split, Disable, and Destiny Bond. Pokemon like Celebi and Jirachi can survive its attacks and OHKO with Psychic. Conkeldurr usually has max HP to score an OHKO with Payback, and it can also mess with Disable sets by using Mach Punch. Tentacruel only cares about Thunderbolt, but it can use Scald and shrug off Shadow Ball with its high Special Defense. That is the general formula for directly countering Gengar, decent Special Defense and a solid neutral or super effective hit. Bulky Water-types like Politoed, Vaporeon, and the aforementioned Tentacruel fit this bill.</p> <p>Checking Gengar is much easier than directly countering it. Almost every Choice Scarf user in OU has a move that will outspeed and OHKO Gengar. This includes, but is not limited to: Politoed, Latios, Terrakion, Tyranitar, Rotom-W, Heatran, Haxorus, and Infernape. Pokemon that are naturally faster than Gengar can also do a great job, such as Starmie, Tornadus, Azelf, and Jolteon. Of course, all of these Pokemon have incredible difficulty finding a chance to switch in. Gyarados, Salamence, and Dragonite can set up a Dragon Dance or two on Gengar if they've invested in HP. Volcarona can set up Quiver Dances if Stealth Rock is not up.</p> ",

        "name": "Bulky Will-O-Wisp",
        "description": "<p>Although traditionally a Pokemon geared towards offense, Gengar is able to pull off a very effective bulky set in OU. Its horrible defensive stats are somewhat remedied by a solid defensive typing and Will-O-Wisp, which allows Gengar to spread burns around the opposing team and utilize its good set of resistances and immunities to sponge attacks. This variant of Gengar works well in OU because many common switch-ins to Gengar's other sets, such as Tyranitar, Scizor, and Jirachi, hate being burned. The tried-and-true combination of Shadow Ball and Focus Blast gives Gengar all the coverage it needs to carry an offensive presence. Finally, the last move is a choice between Substitute and Protect. Substitute can protect Gengar from status and some weaker attacks, and it is typically the more useful option, as even with bulk investment Gengar is rather frail by OU standards and does not enjoy taking direct hits. Being a Pokemon with such great offensive presence, Gengar naturally forces a lot of foes out, allowing it to easily set up a Substitute. On the other hand, Protect is useful for scouting purposes against foes holding a Choice item, especially those carrying Pursuit, as well as giving Gengar a free turn of Black Sludge recovery and racking up another turn of burn damage on the foe.</p> <p>Because this Gengar focuses more on longevity than offense, its HP is maximized rather than its Special Attack. This allows Gengar's Substitutes to survive hits such as Choice Band Scizor's U-turn and burned Jirachi's Iron Head, and it also gives Gengar a very good chance to survive +2 Life Orb Lucario's Bullet Punch after Stealth Rock damage. Next, Gengar's Speed EVs are maximized to make use of its good Speed tier, and the rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack to increase Gengar's offensive presence slightly.</p> <p>This Gengar has decent longevity, so it appreciates entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn to give it a spinblocking purpose. Ferrothorn can sponge Psychic-, Ghost-, and Dark-type attacks aimed at Gengar, and it can also set up entry hazards on common answers to Gengar, such as Tyranitar, Chansey, and specially defensive Jirachi. Additionally, Ferrothorn enjoys having dangerous opposing setup sweepers such as Scizor, Breloom, and Substitute + Dragon Dance Dragonite burned, as these Pokemon could otherwise easily set up on Ferrothorn. On the offensive side, Pokemon such as Alakazam, Reuniclus, Latios, and Latias, which share similar checks with Gengar, appreciate having these Pokemon burned and can help Gengar wear them down.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Substitute Attacker",
        "description": "<p>As Shadow Ball and Focus Blast grant Gengar perfect neutral coverage, Gengar can use Substitute to its advantage in many ways. By using Substitute, Gengar gains protection from Pokemon such as Jirachi, Scizor, and Tyranitar, some of its most common switch-ins. Meanwhile, behind the Substitute, Gengar can cripple these common switch-ins, as well as others, such as specially defensive Hippowdon, which is otherwise a great defensive answer to Gengar.</p> <p>Gengar also makes for a fantastic user of the combination of Substitute, Pain Split, and Life Orb. Once Gengar gets low on HP due to Substitute and Life Orb, it can simply use Pain Split to simultaneously recover its health while damaging the opponent. In addition, Pain Split allows Gengar to easily stall out Chansey, which can otherwise stall Gengar out in return with little trouble.</p> <p>One other trick that Gengar can pull off with Substitute is with Disable. Some dangerous Pokemon such as Terrakion and specially defensive Jirachi have just one move on their movesets to threaten Gengar with. Against such Pokemon, Gengar can simply go for Substitute as they use their only attacking move, which Gengar can promptly Disable, granting Gengar an opportunity for a free Substitute as these Pokemon switch out.</p> <p>As Gengar is the best offensive spinblocker, it is an excellent choice for heavy offense teams that want a spinblocker. Gengar can also use a third attack; Hidden Power Ice, Hidden Power Fire, Thunderbolt, and Thunder are all options to cover important threats such as Dragonite, Scizor, and Gyarados. Should Gengar be running Disable, Toxic Spikes can be considered, as they can wear the foe down while Gengar uses Substitute and Disable. You should also have your own entry hazards in order to take advantage of Gengar's spinblocking; Ferrothorn and Heatran do this well, as they lure Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, which Gengar can switch into. Because Gengar cannot prevent Starmie from spinning entry hazards, Weavile and Tyranitar make for good teammates, as they can trap it.</p> <p>Gengar's teammates are largely dependent on what it runs in the last slot. If Gengar chooses to use Will-O-Wisp, then Pokemon such as Terrakion, Latios, and Latias make for good partners, as they appreciate having Scizor, specially defensive Jirachi, and specially defensive Hippowdon crippled. If Gengar runs Pain Split, it will likely be weakening special walls such as Chansey that enjoy switching in on it. Special sweepers such as Thundurus-T and Volcarona will enjoy having these Pokemon eliminated or severely weakened, as this makes it easier for them to sweep. Finally, Gengar using Disable is more of a glue Pokemon; as such, it does not need any specific teammates.</p> "

  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnezone has one job in the BW OU metagame, and it does that job well: trap and remove Steel-type Pokemon, particularly Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill. Thanks to Magnezone's typing and ability, it can come in on most Steel-type Pokemon without much trouble and remove them. This makes Magnezone an enabler for Pokemon that are stopped by Steel-types, such as Latios, Garchomp, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Amoonguss; making it the cornerstone of the famous DragMag style, where Magnezone clears the way for a collection of Dragon-type Pokemon to fire off powerful attacks. In addition, its ability to trap common entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory and a common spinner and wallbreaker in Excadrill can make it a valuable teammate and take pressure off your spinner by reducing the need to spin as soon as possible. Also, thanks to its solid bulk, it can take weaker hits or resisted attacks from Pokemon such as Politoed and Latios in a pinch and get an attack off. However, Magnezone does not have much of an offensive presence beyond removing Steel-types due to its low Speed, and it has weaknesses to common attacking types, harming its overall viability.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A set consisting of Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Fire, Flash Cannon, and Thunder Wave with a Chople Berry can be used to survive a hit from Pokemon like Alakazam, Keldeo, and Terrakion and KO them with Thunderbolt or Flash Cannon or cripple them with Thunder Wave. However, it does not offer as much utility as other sets and is less consistent. Thunder Wave seems like a good option to cripple faster Pokemon that might try to come in, but none of Magnezone's sets have space for it other than Choice Scarf. Choice Specs is an option to OHKO Ferrothorn without any setup, but it is easy to take advantage of and does not really accomplish anything that Sunny Day Magnezone does not already accomplish. Barrier is also an option for the last slot on the Substitute + Charge Beam set, as it allows Magnezone to survive strong physical attacks such as Outrage from Kyurem-B, Garchomp, and Dragonite, as well as Keldeo's Secret Sword and Breloom's Drain Punch, but it promotes more long-term setup than trying to trade two Pokemon for one. Custap Berry is an option to take your opponent by surprise and KO a weakened Pokemon, as Magnezone has a tendency reach the activation benchmark over the course of a game, but it is not consistent. Salac Berry is an option on the Substitute + Charge Beam set to attempt to sweep faster teams after racking up Special Attack boosts, but it lacks consistency, still is not particularly fast, and comes with the heavy opportunity cost of Leftovers recovery. Magic Coat is an option for Magnezone to reflect Spikes back at a trapped Ferrothorn, but it usually is not worth the moveslot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon do not really care about whatever move Magnezone throws at them and can KO it with a Ground-type STAB move. Excadrill can also come in on any move other than Hidden Power Fire and KO Magnezone, but it needs to be wary of Air Balloon + Magnet Rise variants. Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus-T can come in easily on Electric-type moves and Hidden Power Fire and KO Magnezone, but they need to be careful of Flash Cannon or Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types such as Latios, Garchomp, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon can switch in on one or more of Magnezone's moves and KO it with their move of choice.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Terrakion, Mienshao, and Breloom can outspeed Magnezone and KO it with their STAB Fighting-type moves. However, they cannot switch in easily against Magnezone. In addition, Chople Berry sets can invalidate these checks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Pokemon such as Latios, Alakazam, and Starmie can outspeed and deal heavy damage to or KO Magnezone with the correct move after chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Magnet Pull Circumvention: Worry Seed on Ferrothorn and Shed Shell on Skarmory can invalidate Magnet Pull and allow them to switch out of Magnezone, defeating the purpose of running it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon: Heatran, Chansey, Amoonguss, and Cresselia take little damage from anything Magnezone throws at them and can chip it back or outright KO it in Heatran's case. In addition, bulky setup sweepers such as Reuniclus can shrug off most attacks from Magnezone and proceed to set up against it. Tyranitar can also come in against almost any move Magnezone has, but it needs to be careful of Flash Cannon and chip damage from Volt Switch.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt allows Magnezone to knock out Skarmory without any trouble. Hidden Power Fire is used to allow Magnezone to take out most other Steel-types, particularly Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Jirachi. Sunny Day clears rain and sand and increases the power of Hidden Power Fire, allowing Magnezone to trap and KO Ferrothorn when it was raining previously, 2HKO Excadrill, and do significantly more damage to Jirachi. Magnet Rise in tandem with Air Balloon allows Magnezone to trap Excadrill, which can no longer hit it with Earthquake.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Modest nature is chosen to deal as much damage as possible, notably increasing the damage done to Excadrill and giving Magnezone an easier time dealing with Leech Seed + Protect Ferrothorn and Wish + Protect Jirachi, while Timid does not hit many relevant benchmarks. Air Balloon allows Magnezone to set up Magnet Rise against Excadrill so that it can be trapped and removed and also allows Magnezone to dodge stray Earthquakes. For example, the combination of Air Balloon and Magnet Rise prevents Landorus-T from revenge killing Magnezone after the latter has removed its target.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Magnezone's role is to trap and remove Steel-types, and it should be played as such. Magnezone can come in for free against Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Jirachi lacking U-turn and proceed to take them out. Magnezone should only come in on a free switch against Excadrill, however, as offensive variants can potentially pop its Air Balloon on the switch with Iron Head or Rapid Spin, allowing it to be KOed with Earthquake on the next turn before it can use Magnet Rise. In addition, in a one-on-one situation, Excadrill will use Iron Head to try to pop the Air Balloon and make Magnezone flinch, making it unable to use Magnet Rise safely. Magnezone will have to switch back out if this happens. Try to bring in Magnezone on a U-turn, Volt Switch, or double switch, as some players will bring in their Steel-type and switch it back out while Magnezone comes in to keep it at bay. After Magnezone has done its job, it can still serve a small purpose in taking a weak hit and attacking back or being sacrificed to bring in a sweeper unscathed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Any Pokemon that appreciates the removal of Steel-type Pokemon will appreciate Magnezone as a teammate. Wallbreakers such as Latios, Alakazam, Kyurem-B, and Mamoswine all appreciate the removal of Ferrothorn so that they can go to town on the other team with their powerful attacks. Gliscor, Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Salamence all enjoy the removal of Skarmory, which can otherwise stop them in their tracks. In addition, entry hazard setters such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn appreciate Magnezone's ability to remove one of the best spinners in the tier in Excadrill. Bulky teammates such as Tyranitar or Jirachi will enjoy the removal of Ferrothorn and Skarmory, which can otherwise set hazards and put more pressure on your spinner. Icy Wind Jirachi both lures in Excadrill and allows Magnezone to beat it every time, as it can no longer outspeed Magnezone and hit it before it gets a chance to use Magnet Rise. Other Jirachi sets make good partners as well, as it can lure in Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory and bring in Magnezone with U-turn to trap them easily. Landorus-T and Gliscor can check Excadrill, removing some of the pressure on Magnezone to trap it, appreciate the removal of Skarmory, and can lure it in if running U-turn.</p> <p>Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Dragonite, Latios, and Salamence get a special mention here, as they form the \"DragMag\" strategy and can quickly overwhelm an opposing team after the removal of their Dragon-type answer. In particular, Garchomp, Dragonite, and Salamence really prefer the removal of Skarmory, though removing Ferrothorn allows them to fire off Outrages without fear of being walled or taking Iron Barbs damage. Latios appreciates the removal of Ferrothorn in particular, which resists everything it runs except for the occasional Hidden Power Fire.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt allows Magnezone to quickly remove Skarmory. Volt Switch allows Magnezone to gain momentum on an opposing switch, allowing you to bring in your check to whatever is brought in, provided their switch-in is not a Ground-type or Thundurus-T. The choice of Hidden Power comes down to what you would rather take care of. Hidden Power Fire can be used if Ferrothorn and Scizor are very threatening. On the other hand, Hidden Power Ice is useful for revenge killing Pokemon such as Garchomp, Salamence, and Dragonite when they're locked into Outrage or lack any Speed boosts. Finally, Flash Cannon has solid neutral coverage and is therefore good for cleaning towards the end of the game, notably hitting Tyranitar and Mamoswine harder than anything else Magnezone has. Thunder Wave is another option that allows Magnezone to cripple faster Pokemon on the opposing team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Speed boost from Choice Scarf allows Magnezone to function as a revenge killer against every relevant unboosted Pokemon up to Timid Tornadus while still letting it trap Steel-types.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Magnezone can come in for free against Skarmory and can remove it with Thunderbolt. It can also come in against Scizor locked into Pursuit or Bullet Punch and take it out with two Thunderbolts or a Hidden Power Fire if there is no rain. Additionally, Magnezone can come in and beat Ferrothorn if it's running Hidden Power Fire and there is no rain. If the opponent has no Ground-type or it is sufficiently weakened, feel free to spam Volt Switch early and often to maintain offensive momentum and chip away at the opponent's check to Magnezone, allowing it to come in later and clean up more easily against slower teams. Also, thanks to its good bulk, it is able to come in on a weaker attack and attempt to damage something or try to gain momentum with Volt Switch.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Magnezone is not as self sufficient as its other sets, so while it does offer support, it requires some support of its own. Nothing it has hits Ground-types really hard, outside of Hidden Power Fire against Excadrill, so strong Water- and Grass-types like Keldeo, Starmie, and Breloom can be useful in this regard. Also, if running Hidden Power Ice, Magnezone lacks the ability to deal with Ferrothorn, so checks to that are helpful. Interestingly, Breloom can fill both of these roles and is great for absorbing status for the team and punching holes. On the other hand, Magnezone provides a lot of support to its team. Choice Scarf Magnezone takes care of Skarmory and Ferrothorn with little trouble, which allows Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Latios to go nuts on the opposing team. Landorus-T can also check Excadrill, lure in Skarmory, and bring Magnezone in versus it with U-turn. Removing Skarmory and Ferrothorn also makes spinning as soon as possible a less pressing issue, as quickly KOing them with Magnezone means they will not get as many entry hazards up. Jirachi is a great partner, as it lures in Ferrothorn and Skarmory and can pivot into Magnezone with U-turn, which can then trap them easily. Gliscor checks Excadrill and Landorus-T, greatly appreciates the removal of Skarmory, and can also lure it in to bring in Magnezone if running U-turn, making it a great partner as well.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + Charge Beam",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute allows Magnezone to set up all over Ferrothorn and get a hit in against the opponent after their Steel-type is removed, notably making them more reluctant to bring in a Ground-type like Garchomp, Gliscor, Excadrill, or Landorus-T. Charge Beam allows Magnezone to boost its Special Attack against Ferrothorn, both allowing it to be removed with ease and enabling Magnezone to trade for at least one other Pokemon on the opposing team. Hidden Power Ice has fantastic coverage alongside Charge Beam, allowing Magnezone to hit Ground-types such as Gliscor, Garchomp, Landorus-T, and specially defensive Excadrill harder than anything else it has. Do note, however, that +6 Hidden Power Ice will not OHKO specially defensive Excadrill. Thunderbolt is used in the last moveslot to take out Skarmory more quickly than Charge Beam should Magnezone's stallbreaking capabilities not be required, limiting the entry hazards it can set up, and is Magnezone's go-to move after setting up because of its greater power and perfect accuracy. Flash Cannon can be used in the last slot for its solid neutral coverage, but most of its targets are hit harder by Hidden Power Ice, with the exception of Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers is the item of choice to allow Magnezone to set up as many Substitutes as possible and increase its longevity in case your opponent tries to chip it down. Magnet Pull traps Steel-types, allowing Magnezone to set up against them. A Modest nature improves Magnezone's damage rolls against bulky Pokemon, giving it a better chance to KO them if you are unable to reach +6. Alternatively, a spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 24 SpA / 84 SpD / 144 Spe allows Magnezone to survive a Hydro Pump from Choice Specs Keldeo, endure a Hydro Pump from Choice Scarf Keldeo in rain or take a rain-boosted Surf from Choice Specs Latios and KO it with a +2 Hidden Power Ice. These Speed EVs allow Magnezone to outspeed everything up to specially defensive Heatran, including Politoed, Jellicent, and Breloom that are not running Speed investment. This spread is notably effective when run alongside Barrier, though Barrier is not particularly common.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Magnezone set plays as a wallbreaker and trapper. Magnezone can come in for free against almost any Ferrothorn, Skarmory, or Jirachi. Be wary of Knock Off and Leech Seed from Ferrothorn or paralysis from Jirachi's Body Slam or Thunder, as the removal of Magnezone's Leftovers or constant chip damage from Leech Seed makes it far more difficult for it to set up against them, and paralysis will severely inhibit its ability to set up. When facing Skarmory, it is best to take it out with Thunderbolt as quickly as possible, as most Skarmory will use Whirlwind after they see a Substitute, and preventing Spikes is of high priority.</p> <p>This Magnezone set requires aggressive plays such as double switching, as most players will not willingly keep their Ferrothorn in when they see you have a Magnezone. Double switching is especially important because there are not many Pokemon that invite Ferrothorn in and have Volt Switch or U-turn, with the only two being Rotom-W and Jirachi. The goal with this Magnezone set is to try to apply pressure on the opposing team early and trade for Ferrothorn and at least one other to shape the game in your favor.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As this set is more focused on wallbreaking and less focused on removing Steel-types efficiently, the opponent can set up more entry hazards against this Magnezone set than others. Thus, a spinner such as Excadrill or Starmie is helpful to keep entry hazards off of your side of the field. This set lacks coverage for Excadrill, so checks to it such as Landorus-T and Gliscor are helpful. In addition, Pokemon that take advantage of Steel-types being removed make great teammates, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Mamoswine, Kyurem-B, and Latios. Rotom-W is a good partner, as it invites Ferrothorn in and can pivot to Magnezone with Volt Switch, and it is also an excellent VoltTurn partner with Landorus-T. Rotom-W is also a good Excadrill check, but it needs to be careful of Mold Breaker variants. Please note that this set does not fit particularly well on DragMag teams but rather on rain and sand teams to remove walls and apply heavy offensive pressure afterwards with powerful boosted attacks.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Heatran has amazing defensive utility thanks to its typing and Flash Fire, which make it immune to sandstorm, Toxic, and Fire-type attacks. These qualities let it check Steel- and Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Amoonguss, and Jirachi very well. Heatran also has great support options like Stealth Rock, Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, and Taunt that it can easily mix and match to effectively support its team, as its sets aren't very team dependent. Its offensive presence is also fantastic thanks to high-Base Power moves like Magma Storm and Earth Power, which let it punish and effectively wear down its checks such as Water-types, Garchomp, and Tyranitar. However, Heatran has a noticeable lack of recovery outside of Leftovers that makes it very vulnerable to entry hazards, which makes it more difficult to switch into and consistently check what it needs to. This problem is further compounded by the fact some Pokemon that Heatran can normally beat such as Volcarona run coverage specifically for it, which leaves it quite pressured. Another issue is that some of the best Pokemon in the metagame, including Excadrill, Garchomp, and especially Politoed, all threaten Heatran immensely.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf is a decent option on sand teams to give Heatran a secondary form of speed control, but such a set is quickly worn down and these teams would usually prefer a bulkier set with more longevity. Choice Specs seems good on paper for wallbreaking; however, the moves this set locks into are usually extremely punishable; Heatran's defensive utility also decreases dramatically, and offensive sun teams, where this set shines best, aren't very optimal in the metagame. Such a set is also slow and easy to force out.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Tentacruel, Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Politoed all threaten Heatran with super effective moves and have the type advantage against it. Politoed, in particular, can summon rain to weaken Heatran's Fire-type moves while strengthening Water-type moves. However, all of these Pokemon can be worn down by status, residual damage from Magma Storm, and entry hazards over time.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Gliscor, Excadrill, Garchomp, and Landorus-T can all destroy Heatran with super effective STAB moves. They can even set up, or in Excadrill's case, spin away Stealth Rock as Heatran switches.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Magma Storm lets Heatran punish its switch-ins thanks to the trapping effect and residual damage. It's especially potent in tandem with sand. Fire Blast, on the other hand, is stronger and more accurate, which makes it more consistent. Protect lets Heatran scout Choice-locked attackers like Latios and Landorus-T, get free Leftovers recovery, and get more residual damage on foes with Magma Storm. Earth Power lets Heatran hit opposing Heatran, Tyranitar, Terrakion, and Tentacruel while giving it another attack to use should Heatran need to preserve Magma Storm's PP. Hidden Power Ice hits the Dragon- and Ground-types of the tier, mainly Latios, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus-T, hard on the switch. Will-O-Wisp lets Heatran cripple switch-ins like Garchomp, Tyranitar, Politoed, and Tentacruel and wears them down much faster. Taunt can be used over Protect to let Heatran defeat Chansey with Magma Storm and helps a lot against sun stall teams. However, this makes Heatran unable to rack up free residual damage or Leftovers recovery and leaves it unable to scout moves from Choice-locked attackers.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment lets Heatran outspeed Adamant Breloom, Modest Politoed, and most Rotom-W, as Rotom-W typically opts for a slower spread. Leftovers is Heatran's only form of recovery; it has an easy time recovering thanks to Protect, the many switches it forces, and its immunities to sand, poison, and burn damage. Air Balloon makes Heatran a solid offensive answer to most Dragon-types, mono-Earthquake Gliscor, and most opposing Heatran; it also lets Heatran stay in on Tyranitar, meaning you can burn and weaken it for teammates like Latios or Thundurus-T to take advantage of, and it makes Heatran immune to Spikes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to keep Heatran as healthy as possible so it can check what it needs to consistently, take a super effective hit in a pinch, and come in to pressure the opposing team more often. Be cautious about coming in directly on Pokemon Heatran checks that have options to punish it, namely Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Latios as they can use Stun Spore, Knock Off, and Surf or Trick respectively. Attempt to keep entry hazards off your side of the field if possible, as they hurt Heatran's longevity and make it more difficult to switch in. Try to get and keep your own entry hazards up as they make switching into Heatran even more punishing than it already is, especially if sand is up. If Heatran is running Hidden Power Ice, it can be used if predicting a switch to a Ground- or Dragon-type if it isn't too risky to do so in a given situation. Don't be afraid to throw out Magma Storm if given a free turn, as it punishes almost everything that comes in on Heatran. However, its low PP must be kept in mind. Use Protect to scout Choice-locked attackers like Latios and Landorus-T, regain health via Leftovers, and rack up more residual damage on the foe. However, be cautious of using Protect against Pokemon that can punish its use by setting up or healing. Avoid letting Heatran get paralyzed, as it will leave Heatran very vulnerable to Pokemon like Jirachi and Breloom that it could check otherwise. If Heatran has Will-O-Wisp, use it when predicting a switch to checks like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar is an excellent partner for this set due to its ability to set up Stealth Rock and sand while checking and potentially trapping Pokemon like Jellicent and Starmie that Heatran can struggle with. Water-types like Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Jellicent are good partners as well, as they can check opposing Water- and Ground-types like Keldeo, Gliscor, and Landorus-T, while Heatran handles Grass- and Dragon-types like Amoonguss and Latios for them. They can even spread status, namely burn, to make Protect on Heatran more effective and switching into it harder. Pokemon that can set up entry hazards, like Tyranitar, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn make for good partners to punish the opposing team as much as possible. Pokemon like Tyranitar, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn are good options for this. Latios can soft check Pokemon like Keldeo, Gliscor, Rotom-W, and Politoed and appreciates Heatran's ability to weaken or cripple Tyranitar and beat most Steel-types, making Latios much more difficult to switch into. Amoonguss and Poison Heal Breloom have good offensive and defensive synergy with Heatran, as they can handle Water-types such as Politoed, Jellicent, and Keldeo. Ground-types like Gliscor and Excadrill take advantage of Heatran wearing down, crippling, or trapping their checks. Both of them can also spread Toxic, piling on the residual damage the foes have to take and suffocating them as a result. Pokemon that appreciate Heatran's balance breaking capabilities and match up well against offense are good partners. Choice Scarf users like Keldeo, Landorus-T, and Garchomp pair well with Heatran for this reason. Spinners like Excadrill and Starmie work well with Heatran, as they have good offensive synergy with it and improve its longevity, making it easier for Heatran to switch in and punish its foe.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + Protect",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute lets Heatran punish switches and take advantage of Pokemon that can't do much damage to it while making it easier for it to spread status. Protect lets Heatran scout Choice-locked Pokemon if it's not already behind a Substitute, get a free turn of Leftovers recovery, and rack up free poison and potentially sand damage in tandem with Substitute. Toxic allows Heatran to punish most of its switch-ins by putting them on a timer and synergizes well with Substitute and Protect because these moves make it easier to rack up free residual damage with the extra protection provided. Will-O-Wisp can also be used to more reliably spread burns to Pokemon like Tentacruel and Garchomp, and it synergizes well with Substitute and Protect for the same reasons as Toxic. Earth Power can be used over Toxic or Will-O-Wisp to punish opposing Heatran as well as wear Tentacruel down more quickly, although this means Heatran can't wear down other Pokemon as reliably. Finally, Hidden Power Ice is an option to OHKO Garchomp, Landorus-T, and non-Special Defensive Gliscor while maintaining the pressure on Latios and Dragonite.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>8 HP and 100 Special Defense EVs make sure Rotom-W's Volt Switch does not break Heatran's Substitute, forcing Rotom-W to use Hydro Pump to break it and making Heatran adept at PP stalling Rotom-W. 244 Speed EVs and a Timid nature are used to outspeed Adamant Excadrill. Leftovers helps Heatran recover health after using Substitute and also works well in tandem with Protect.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Heatran is meant to punish standard sand teams by wearing them down while being tough to KO thanks to Substitute and Protect. Try to keep Heatran as healthy as possible so it can come in on what it checks and set up Substitute consistently. Be cautious about coming in directly on Pokemon Heatran checks that have options to punish it, like Ferrothorn and Amoonguss, as they can cripple Heatran on the switch with Knock Off and Stun Spore, respectively. Try to keep entry hazards off your side of the field if possible, as they hurt this set's longevity. Attempt to set up Substitute when given a free turn or on Pokemon that Heatran naturally beats, like Amoonguss and Jirachi, so it can more easily spread status and wear down the opposing team. Heatran can even set up Substitute on weaker Water-types like Jellicent, which can't break its Substitute in one hit. Use Toxic or Will-O-Wisp if behind a Substitute or predicting a switch to a check susceptible to it, mainly Water- and Ground-types. Lava Plume can be used if predicting a switch to a Pokemon immune to Toxic or as a catch-all play that's usually low-risk and high-reward, especially behind a Substitute. Protect should be used to scout Choice-locked attackers if Substitute isn't up, get free Leftovers recovery, and rack up more residual damage on the foe. Alongside Substitute, it also lets Heatran PP stall moves with low PP, most notably Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and Alakazam's Focus Blast; these attackers can't do anything of note to Heatran if they run out of their respective moves' PP.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar is a fantastic partner due to setting sand, which becomes incredibly suffocating alongside Heatran's methods of passive damage. Tyranitar also has the ability to set up Stealth Rock while also checking and potentially trapping Pokemon like Starmie and Tentacruel that Heatran can struggle with. Water-types like Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Jellicent are good partners as well, as they can check opposing Water- and Ground-types such as Gliscor and Politoed as well as opposing Heatran, while Heatran checks most Grass-types like Amoonguss and Ferrothorn for them. They can even spread status themselves if Heatran lacks it. Entry hazard setters like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Garchomp make good partners to punish the switches from the opposing team as much as possible. Pokemon that appreciate Heatran's ability to wear down, inflict status on, or outright beat bulkier Pokemon and match up well versus offense are good partners. Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T, Keldeo, and Garchomp pair well for this reason. Spinners like Excadrill and Starmie work well with Heatran, as their support makes it easier for Heatran to switch in and pressure their checks in return. Ground-types like Gliscor and Excadrill take advantage of Heatran wearing down and crippling their checks, namely Rotom-W and Jellicent, while providing utility in Taunt and Rapid Spin, respectively; Gliscor even switches into Fighting-types. Amoonguss and Breloom provide checks to Water- and Ground-types while appreciating Heatran handling and setting up on Steel- and Grass-types and wearing them down or potentially beating counters like Latios and Amoonguss. Latios can soft check Pokemon like Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Politoed and appreciates Heatran's ability to put Tyranitar on a timer with Toxic and beat other Steel-types.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Heatran's typing and bulk let it set up Stealth Rock pretty easily against most bulky Pokemon. Lava Plume ensures Heatran isn't Taunt bait and gives it a spammable STAB move that has a good chance to burn potential switch-ins like Tentacruel and Garchomp. Roar lets Heatran phaze setup sweepers like Reuniclus and Calm Mind Jirachi, which it can struggle against under rain while also punishing the foe with more residual damage. Will-O-Wisp lets Heatran guarantee a burn on most of its switch-ins, namely Tentacruel, Latios, Tyranitar, and Garchomp, which makes it easier to wear them down. Toxic lets Heatran cripple all its switch-ins except Tentacruel and Gliscor and synergizes well with Protect. Protect lets Heatran scout Choice-locked Pokemon, recover health with Leftovers for free, and rack up residual damage. Taunt can be used over Stealth Rock, as it lets Heatran stop setup sweepers like Reuniclus and Jirachi, prevent entry hazards from Pokemon like Tyranitar, and deny use of healing moves from Pokemon like Reuniclus, Slowbro, and Slowking. However, this move is quite team specific and removes one of this set's greatest qualities in being a great Stealth Rock setter.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP / 252 SpD with a Calm nature allow Heatran to shrug off hard-hitting treats like Latios and Alakazam. Leftovers is Heatran's only form of recovery and works well with Protect.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to keep Heatran as healthy as possible so it can switch into and wall what it needs to consistently. Be cautious about coming in directly on Pokemon Heatran appears to check, like Volcarona and Gengar, as they can punish it with super effective coverage. Try to keep entry hazards off your side off the field if possible, as they hurt Heatran's longevity and make it more difficult to switch into what it's supposed to. Set Stealth Rock up when given a free turn from a forced switch or a Pokemon Heatran walls to keep pressure on the opposing team. Use Toxic or Will-O-Wisp to cripple checks susceptible to it, mainly most Water- and Ground-types. If lacking Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, it isn't a bad idea to fish for a Lava Plume burn on the switch. Use Protect to scout Choice-locked attackers like Latios and Landorus-T, regain health from Leftovers, and potentially rack up more Toxic poison or sand damage on the foe. However, be cautious of using Protect against Pokemon that can take advantage of its use by setting up or healing. Avoid letting Heatran get paralyzed, as it will leave Heatran unable to check what it's supposed to, mainly Jirachi and Reuniclus.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Water-types like Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Jellicent are good partners, as they can check opposing Water- and Ground-types as well as opposing Heatran and have good defensive synergy with Heatran. Pokemon that can set up Spikes make for good partners as well to punish switches from the opposing team as much as possible. Ferrothorn is a decent option, thanks to the fact that it's a good Water-type check, takes pressure off Heatran to switch into Pokemon like Latios, and can even provide Knock Off support. Tyranitar is a good partner due to it setting up sand while also checking and potentially trapping Pokemon like Jellicent, Tentacruel, and Starmie that Heatran can struggle with; this is appreciated especially for the latter two, as they can spin away the Stealth Rock Heatran sets up. Tyranitar not needing to run Stealth Rock also makes it easier to keep healthy, as it won’t need to take a hit to set them up and can instead run other sets like Choice Scarf more effectively. Amoonguss and Poison Heal Breloom provide a Water- and Ground-type check while appreciating Heatran switching into most Steel- and Dragon-types for them and setting up Stealth Rock. Excadrill and Gliscor are good partners, as they can provide Rapid Spin support and a switch into Fighting-types, respectively, while taking advantage of the poison and burn damage Heatran spreads with their own Protect. They can also spread Toxic poison in tandem with Heatran to force more residual damage on the foe. Spinners like Excadrill and Starmie work well with Heatran, as they have good offensive synergy with it and increase its longevity, making it easier to switch and pressure the opponent. Pokemon that appreciate Heatran's ability to set Stealth Rock and match up well against offense are good partners. Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T, Mienshao, and Keldeo pair well for this reason. Latios can soft check Water-types like Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Politoed and appreciates Heatran's ability to poison or burn Tyranitar, putting it on a timer, and beat most Steel-types.</p> "

        "name": "Sunny Day Trapper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Magma Storm is able to trap Heatran's natural checks. This, alongside Sunny Day to set up sun and one-turn Solar Beam, allows Heatran to threaten bulky Water-type Pokemon and instantly win the weather war against Politoed. Other targets for Magma Storm include Slowbro, Slowking, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon. The last move is dependent on the team's needs. Earth Power is useful to defeat opposing Heatran, have a perfect accuracy move to hit Excadrill and Magnezone, and have a one-turn move to damage Tyranitar, but using it means Heatran is setup fodder for Dragon-type Pokemon. Hidden Power Ice lets Heatran defeat even specially defensive Gliscor that switch into Magma Storm, and it does heavy damage to Dragon-types that are not threatened by Heatran's Fire- and Grass-type coverage. Leftovers is the preferred item because it mitigates entry hazard damage, but Air Balloon lets Heatran safely trap and defeat Gastrodon and Seismitoad.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>160 Speed EVs let Heatran outspeed Adamant maximum Speed Scizor, uninvested support Landorus-T, and standard specially defensive Excadrill as well as Speed tie with standard specially defensive Gliscor. 96 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature let Heatran 2HKO specially defensive Gliscor with Hidden Power Ice after a Magma Storm, even after Poison Heal.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to bring Heatran onto the field as soon as possible, since this set loses its surprise potential after the early-game. Use Heatran to lure out its natural checks and counters for the Magma Storm + Sunny Day combo to start opening holes in the opposing team. Do not be afraid to use Magma Storm when Heatran is on the field, since this set relies more on Magma Storm's trapping ability than prediction. Its ideal targets are defensive Politoed and Starmie, or a bulky Water-type like Slowking, Slowbro, or Jellicent. If Heatran is at full HP, it can even risk Sunny Day + Solar Beam versus Gastrodon and Seismitoad, since it has about a 50% chance to not be OHKOed by a Ground-type move from either. If using Air Balloon, be careful to keep it intact as long as possible, since scaring away Excadrill, Garchomp, and Gliscor is a huge feat. Always run Hidden Power Ice if using Air Balloon so as to not be overpowered by the tier's Dragon-types. Remember to have Steel-type Pokemon as teammates, since this set has noticeably less defensive presence against powerful wallbreakers like Latios, Alakazam, and Reuniclus.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar is Heatran's best partner, as it negates rain while forming a phenomenal anti-Psychic-type core with Pursuit. While more passive, Hippowdon and Ninetales are also possible partners to get rid of rain. Pokemon that utilize VoltTurn, like Rotom-W, Magnezone, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Scizor, help safely bring Heatran onto the field, and they love the offensive synergy Heatran provides with Magma Storm's trapping ability. Water-type checks like Latios, Ferrothorn, Breloom, and Jellicent are also very good partners, since you need a backup plan in case Magma Storm misses. Celebi is a phenomenal partner, since it can set up Stealth Rock, bring Heatran safely into battle via Baton Pass, and help check Keldeo, Rotom-W, and offensive Starmie.</p> "

  "Ninetales": {
    "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced around the time BW was the main generation. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the current BW OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>When one looks at Ninetales, the first thing to come to mind is its relative lack of utility outside of Drought. Ninetales is fairly useless outside of its ability, so the sun it provides should be the only reason to run it. While Ninetales doesn't have an expansive movepool or a good stat distribution, it can run a few viable sets that allow it to just barely pull its weight. If you want to pack Ninetales on a team, you need to make sure that you provide adequate support to keep Ninetales alive, as sun teams are generally dependent on Drought support.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There are a few sets that Ninetales used to be able to run effectively but have declined in use since the release of BW2. One of these is Choice Specs, which makes Fire Blast really pack a punch. However, being locked into one move is terrible for a Pokemon that needs to maintain versatility in attacking, and Ninetales still isn't all that powerful. Similarly, a pure Nasty Plot set with Energy Ball over Solar Beam and Hidden Power Ice over Sunny Day might seem viable, but Ninetales fails to sweep effectively, and Nasty Plot only works with Sunny Day alongside it. A Calm Mind booster is another of those sets; in theory, it should allow Ninetales to tank hits and dish them out, but it doesn't quite work that in practice. Multiple boosts are needed to accomplish that goal, and Ninetales has difficulty setting up that many boosts before fainting. The last set is one with 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature utilizing Disable, a la SubDisable Gengar. Disable could mess with Pokemon that only have one move with which to hit Ninetales hard. However, unlike Gengar, Ninetales cannot to take sufficient advantage of the free turn(s) it might gain, thus it is inferior to any of Ninetales's other options. Toxic could be used in place of Will-O-Wisp as a status move to deter bulky Water-types and weather inducers from switching into Ninetales. On the other hand, it lacks the crippling halving of Attack that Will-O-Wisp boasts, making it a much less effective option overall.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best form of defense against Ninetales is another weather starter, as Ninetales is used solely for sun. If sun is taken off the field, sun teams will be immediately crippled. The two biggest threats that come to mind are Tyranitar, who can threaten to OHKO it with its powerful STAB Rock-type attacks or pick it off with Pursuit, and Politoed who can decimate it with its Drizzle-boosted Water-type moves. However, Ninetales does have some sort of defense against the two weather starters: both are 2HKOed by Solar Beam, while Tyranitar is also crippled by Will-O-Wisp. Ninetales can also use Sunny Day as they switch in to regain momentum. In short, weather inducers have to be careful against Ninetales, especially offensive variants. The only weather inducer that can switch in risk-free against most Ninetales is Hippowdon, but it can be silenced by Nasty Plot-boosted Solar Beam.</p> <p>Other than weather inducers, there are a few Pokemon that can beat Ninetales. If you want to completely wall it, Blissey and Chansey are your best friends, as they can take any hit and slowly kill it with Toxic and Seismic Toss. Blissey would do well to watch out for Nasty Plot-boosted Fire Blast, however. Tentacruel also walls it and is able to set up Toxic Spikes, Toxic Ninetales directly, or use Rapid Spin, all for free. Heatran also walls Ninetales and can set up Stealth Rock or straight-up attack with Earth Power. The defensive set is fair game for Gastrodon, but note that the offensive set would OHKO it with Solar Beam if it attempted to take a hit. Terrakion can take any attack other than Solar Beam and OHKO with Stone Edge or Close Combat. Volcarona can set up for free and demolish Ninetales; sun-boosted Fire Blast and Hidden Power Rock 2HKO Ninetales even without Quiver Dance boosts. Even defensive Ninetales has a small chance to be OHKOed by +1 Hidden Power Rock, while offensive variants are always OHKOed by both +1 Hidden Power Rock and +1 Fire Blast. Victini always OHKOes offensive Ninetales with Choice Band V-create and defensive variants over half the time, while taking a pittance from any attacks Ninetales might throw at it. Defensive variants are also easily taken care of by Gliscor.</p> <p>Other than opposing weather, Dragon-types are the best way to defeat Ninetales. Kyurem-B can take anything Ninetales has other than a burn and blast it to pieces. Garchomp is similar; Yache Berry variants can take even Hidden Power Ice. Latios and Latias also wall and can KO Ninetales. Dragon Dance set-up sweepers that carry Substitute or hold a Lum Berry can set up on and destroy Ninetales along with its teammates. These include Substitute + Dragon Dance Gyarados, Lum Berry Dragon Dance Haxorus, Lum Berry Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Substitute + Dragon Dance Dragonite. These Pokemon only win if Ninetales does not carry Roar, however. Salamence can also beat Ninetales, no matter what the set—Dragon Dance, mixed, Choice Scarf, it doesn't matter.</p> <p>As you can see, beating Ninetales is quite easy. Even if you don't have any of these Pokemon, you can always resort to pounding Ninetales with powerful attacks or hitting it with priority from Breloom or Choice Band Dragonite.</p> ",

        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<p>While it might seem strange to use a defensive set on a Fire-type, especially one that isn't all that bulky, Ninetales is the MVP of a sun team, as it brings the sun the team relies on. Many sun teams fall flat on their face with another weather in play, so it is imperative for Ninetales to outlast opposing weather inducers. Having a good pivot is always handy, and Ninetales fulfills that role decently. Ninetales can switch into most Grass-, Ice-, Fire-, and Bug-type attacks, as well as Scalds from bulky Water-types. Ninetales still isn't that bulky though, so invested sun-boosted Fire-type attacks from the likes of Darmanitan, Victini, and Volcarona will still hurt.</p> <p>Flamethrower occupies the first slot as the STAB move of choice, sporting perfect accuracy and decent power in sun. It allows Ninetales to wear down Pokemon with something other than residual damage and prevents it from being Taunt or setup bait. Next, Will-O-Wisp lets Ninetales check a ton of physical attackers, such as Dragonite, by outspeeding and crippling them. Sunny Day is completely irreplaceable, as it steals the momentum back from the switch in of an opposing weather inducer; seizing this momentum gives you an immediate advantage and forces your opponent to rethink their game plan. The last slot is a toss-up between two moves. Roar is usually preferred for deterring setup sweepers, especially SubCM Latias, which is a huge threat to most sun teams. Toxic is another option that enables Ninetales to cripple opposing Politoed, Tyranitar, and Hippowdon that just love to switch into it. The final option listed is Substitute, and with good reason. It aids in spreading burn and lets Ninetales use Sunny Day against Tyranitar. Jirachi, Ferrothorn, and Forretress are just a few Pokemon that Ninetales can set up a free Substitute on. All of these moves are excellent; pick the one that is best for your team.</p> <p>The EVs give Ninetales some much-needed bulk, with enough Defense investment to survive an Outrage from Choice Scarf Garchomp after Stealth Rock. 136 Speed EVs and a Timid nature let it outrun Modest Hydreigon and more importantly, Adamant Haxorus and Jolly Toxicroak, who can be rendered useless with a well timed Will-O-Wisp. These EVs provide an equilibrium between Speed and bulk, but the spread can be altered to put more emphasis on either. 16 EVs can be moved from Speed to Defense to guarantee Life Orb Breloom's +2 Mach Punch never OHKOes, while the Defense EVs can be moved to Special Defense to help Ninetales withstand powerful hits from foes like Calm Mind Latias and Politoed.</p> <p>The fourth moveslot is in no way limited to the options listed on the set. Protect is useful for scouting and gaining extra Leftovers recovery. Pain Split is a decent option to both provide recovery and a means of wearing down the opponent. Hidden Power Rock can be used to break Heatran's Air Balloon, which gives teammates such as Volcarona the ability to hit Heatran with Ground-type attacks.</p> <p>Support is the difference between life and death for defensive Ninetales, as it is incapable of operating without a few types of support. The first is Magic Bounce or Rapid Spin. Ninetales is weak to Stealth Rock and vulnerable to all other entry hazards, so needless to say, it is very helpful to keep them off the field. Xatu is best for Magic Bounce because of its Ground immunity; its advantages over a spinner are its ability to provide momentum and paralysis support. Forretress and defensive Starmie are the best sun team spinners. Forretress can take physical Dragon-type attacks and non-STAB Earthquakes aimed at Ninetales as well as set up Stealth Rock or another hazard. Starmie is good because it can take at least two hits from most variants of Terrakion, Recover up, and force it out. Magma Storm Heatran can help deal with weather inducers and a whole slew of other Pokemon. Heatran also has a useful Dragon resistance and can set up Stealth Rock, so it is a useful partner in general. Bronzong can take most attacks that would severely hurt Ninetales due to Levitate and its rare set of resistances. It can also set up Stealth Rock, which is always useful. Last but definitely not least is Latias, who has near-perfect type synergy with Ninetales; Dragonite is similar but unfortunately shares a Rock weakness. Sun teams appreciate Latias's resistances immensely, while Latias can provide Wish or even Healing Wish support to aid Ninetales in its quest to stay alive.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While keeping Ninetales alive for as long as possible is certainly important, it requires quite a bit of support to take hits on its own. Additionally, it has difficulty winning weather wars by itself. However, with an offensive set, Ninetales can both win the weather war and pose an offensive threat. While it doesn't hit that hard with base 81 Special Attack, sun-boosted Fire Blast hits everything it needs to.</p> <p>Solar Beam is the main draw of this set; 2HKOing Tyranitar and Politoed is no small feat. It also hits most Water-types for decent damage, so it isn't limited in use to just weather inducers. However, its major fault is that it leaves Ninetales defenseless if another weather comes into play. This is where Sunny Day comes in; if you can pull it off as Tyranitar or Politoed comes in, they either switch out or foolishly stay in, only to lose a large amount of health to Solar Beam. However, there is no margin for error when using Sunny Day. One misprediction will leave Ninetales helpless to do anything; thus, you must be aggressive in your use of the move. Next on the highlight reel is Fire Blast. Fire Blast hits considerably hard with 252 Special Attack EVs and sun backing it. The power is not amazing but gets the job done; it 2HKOes frail resists and most neutrally hit offensive Pokemon.</p> <p>The last slot has quite a few viable options. Hidden Power Ice is the preferred choice to hit Dragon-types hard as well as OHKO Landorus-T and Gliscor without the risk of missing. Will-O-Wisp is an amazing move on Ninetales because of its potency against physical attackers that would otherwise be able to defeat Ninetales with ease. The final option is Nasty Plot, which might seem to be an April Fools' joke on a Pokemon with base 81 Special Attack; however, this is not the case. In sun, a boosted Fire Blast 2HKOes Blissey, which is no small feat for a special attacker. A boosted Solar Beam can OHKO Tyranitar and Politoed, Ninetales's two worst foes. Nonetheless, it cannot be emphasized enough that Ninetales is not a sweeper; it's a utility attacker and should be played to its strengths; bypassing opposing weather starters while also maintaining an acceptable offensive presence.</p> <p>A Timid nature is preferred to outrun neutral base 100s, positive base 90s, and everything below, but Modest is also viable for the added power it provides. Timid should definitely be chosen if using Hidden Power Ice, however, so that Ninetales can get the jump on Salamence that do not run a positive Speed nature. Leftovers is the item of choice because passive recovery helps keep Ninetales alive, which is crucial for sun teams. It also gives Ninetales more Stealth Rock switch-ins. Concerning the last slot, there are two other moves that could be run; Protect can be used to augment Leftovers recovery and scout foes, and Hidden Power Ground can be used to hit Heatran, a major threat to most sun teams.</p> <p>Magic Bounce or spinner support is 100% necessary because this set already has enough survivability issues even without entry hazards in the mix. For the offensively minded players that would use this set, Xatu fits the bill perfectly, as it can set up screens to protect sun sweepers and maintain momentum with U-turn. However, Rapid Spin support is still the more reliable option. The two spinners that are best on sun are differentiated by one factor: Forretress has a Dragon resistance and Donphan a Rock one; whichever your team is more weak to is the one that you should use. Forretress also has slow Volt Switch going for it, while Donphan can provide offensive presence and the ability to pick off weakened Dragon-types. Additionally, you will need Heatran removed for Ninetales to function properly, so a bunch of moves scattered among Ninetales's teammates is necessary.</p> <p>Bronzong and Latias share beautiful defensive synergy, with Bronzong setting up Stealth Rock to help bring weather inducers into KO range and Latias providing Wish support to keep Ninetales in decent health. Magma Storm Heatran remains an excellent partner, possessing the ability to trap most Pokemon that threaten Ninetales.</p> "

  "Tentacruel": {
    "overview": "<p>Tentacruel finds its niche as a utility Pokemon on rain teams. Thanks to its good typing, decent stats, and fantastic ability in Rain Dish, Tentacruel is nearly impossible to KO in rain and can check the Pokemon it is supposed to throughout long matches while providing Rapid Spin support and spreading status. Tentacruel's access to Rapid Spin allows it to support Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock such as Tornadus, Thundurus-T, and Volcarona as well as any grounded Pokemon that gets worn down quickly by Spikes. In addition, it does not even have to spin to remove Toxic Spikes. However, Tentacruel's reliance on Black Sludge and Rain Dish for recovery leaves it vulnerable to residual damage, as a burn from Keldeo's Scald or Knock Off from Ferrothorn will leave it far more easy to wear down with entry hazards and U-turn. In addition, when sand is up, Tentacruel has a net recovery of zero per turn. It also is very reliant on Scald to threaten switch-ins and is very passive without it. However, on the right team, Tentacruel's support capabilities make it a great choice.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sludge Bomb is an option for Tentacruel's last slot to 2HKO Breloom and deal a decent amount to Celebi, but it does not hit much else and does not provide as much utility against bulkier teams. It also hits Latios for a reasonable amount of damage and has the chance to poison it. Similarly, Ice Beam is an option to hit Dragon-types such as Latios on the switch and deal heavy damage to Dragonite if it tries to set up, but again it does not offer as much utility as Tentacruel's other moves. Venoshock is another option that allows Tentacruel to OHKO most Breloom but lacks targets outside of it. Finally, Knock Off is an option to remove items such as Leftovers on the opposing Pokemon, leaving them more vulnerable to chip damage, but it leaves Tentacruel unable to defeat Jellicent and does not limit the longevity of every Pokemon that comes on the field as much as Toxic does. Also, an offensive set could be used consisting of Scald or Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, Giga Drain, and Rapid Spin to pick off unsuspecting Water-types such as Gastrodon and Seismitoad and beat Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo, which other Tentacruel cannot, but it lacks consistency and cannot switch into most Keldeo reliably. Also, offensive sets are usually outclassed by Starmie.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Jellicent: Jellicent is easily the best Ghost-type in OU and therefore a huge roadblock in terms of spinning. It is also immune to Scald thanks to Water Absorb. Though Tentacruel can beat it if it manages to land a Toxic, if Jellicent switches in on a single layer of Toxic Spikes and as a result does not get badly poisoned, Tentacruel will not be able to get past it.</p> <p><strong>Sand</strong>: Sand both deactivates Rain Dish and cancels out Leftovers recovery, making Tentacruel far more vulnerable to the entry hazards it has to switch in on and remove. As Rain Dish is one of the things that make Tentacruel capable of doing its job, this is of paramount importance. In addition, Tyranitar can threaten Tentacruel with Crunch and Pursuit to wear it down quickly in conjunction with sand. However, Tyranitar and Hippowdon cannot switch in easily, as they fear a burn from Scald while also taking chip damage from it and can be annoyed by a combination of Toxic and Protect.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Though they cannot prevent Tentacruel from using Rapid Spin, Water-types such as Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Starmie can come in on Tentacruel relatively safely and threaten it back with their move of choice or potentially burn it, allowing them to beat Tentacruel in a one-on-one situation.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types such as Latios and Hydreigon can come in against Tentacruel with little fear and proceed to fire off a free Draco Meteor. Similarly, Garchomp can do the same but with an Earthquake or Outrage and requires a Lum Berry to avoid a Scald burn or Toxic poison. Dragonite and Salamence can also come in against Tentacruel and set up for free if they have a Lum Berry, making them serious threats as well.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn: Ferrothorn takes very little damage from Tentacruel's Scald and is immune to Toxic. It can also hit back at Tentacruel, removing its Black Sludge with Knock Off and significantly hampering its longevity, especially if sand is active. In addition, it can hit Tentacruel hard with Power Whip and set entry hazards in Tentacruel's face. However, Ferrothorn is not a primary switch-in to Tentacruel, as a burn from Scald is absolutely catastrophic for it, allowing Tentacruel to sit on it as long as rain is up. It also wears Ferrothorn down very quickly for Tentacruel's teammates and causes Ferrothorn to deal significantly less damage. In addition, Substitute variants of Tentacruel can stall out Power Whip's PP and can try to land a Scald burn in the case Power Whip misses against its Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Reuniclus does not care about anything that Tentacruel can throw at it and can proceed to set up with Calm Mind or threaten Tentacruel immediately with Psychic or Psyshock. Additionally, while it can not switch in, Alakazam can immediately threaten Tentacruel. Starmie is also capable of threatening Tentacruel immediately with Psyshock and Thunder.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types such as Breloom and Celebi do not mind most things Tentacruel can throw at them and can proceed to set up, though they must be wary of the occasional Venoshock or Sludge Bomb. Amoonguss can also wall Tentacruel easily and paralyze it with Stun Spore and chip it with Giga Drain if sand is up or Tentacruel is burned. It also absorbs Toxic Spikes.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Utility",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is Tentacruel's most spammable move, as it has decent power under rain and can cause problems for switch-ins that would otherwise come in easily on Tentacruel, such as Latios, and make them much easier to deal with thanks to burn damage. It notably allows Tentacruel to burn and beat Ferrothorn and Amoonguss, which otherwise cause many problems for it. Rapid Spin allows Tentacruel to provide support for entry hazard-weak teammates and is used well by Tentacruel thanks to its good bulk. Protect allows Tentacruel to scout the move of opposing Choice item users and grants Tentacruel a free turn of recovery, which adds up fast due to the combination of Black Sludge and Rain Dish. Toxic is the best move in the last slot, as it allows Tentacruel to take down Jellicent so it can spin reliably and also cripples Pokemon that resist Scald, including but not limited to Keldeo, Latios, and Rotom-W. Toxic Spikes is an option on Tentacruel to weaken any Pokemon that comes in until they are removed and is particularly useful for winning the weather war against Tyranitar or the occasional Ninetales. It is also better against Natural Cure users such as Starmie, Celebi, and Chansey, as they will just get poisoned again even after switching out to remove status. However, if Jellicent switches in on one layer of Toxic Spikes and as a result does not get badly poisoned, Tentacruel will not be able to break through it by itself. Substitute is an option to block status and Leech Seed, allowing Tentacruel to beat Ferrothorn more reliably and PP stall certain Pokemon in a pinch in combination with Protect. Substitute also allows Tentacruel to beat other Tentacruel by spamming Scald to try to burn them. It can also let Tentacruel force out bulky Starmie, though Tentacruel does not necessarily win, force out Life Orb stall offensive Starmie, and fire off a free Scald against a faster foe if Tentacruel sets up on the switch. In addition, it can use it in attempts to land a Scald burn on Ferrothorn, making it much less likely to break its Substitutes. It also notably beats Amoonguss, which can not break Tentacruel's Substitutes and is then susceptible to being burned by Scald if it stays in. However, Substitute means Tentacruel can not harm Water-immune Pokemon and also makes it totally useless against a healthy Jellicent.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Tentacruel to outspeed every Pokemon up to Jolly Landorus-T, including all Mamoswine and all non-Choice Scarf Excadrill. EV spreads with less Speed can be run if you feel safe towards Landorus-T and Excadrill. 96 Speed EVs and a Timid nature are enough to outrun Jolly Mamoswine and all Dragonite, allowing Tentacruel to use Toxic before it can use Substitute. The 72 remaining EVs can go in either Defense or Special Defense, which is mostly up to preference. Placing them in Defense allows Tentacruel to take hits slightly better from Pokemon such as Scizor and Ferrothorn, but placing them in Special Defense improves damage rolls against Latios and Choice Specs Keldeo.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to bring Tentacruel in against Pokemon such as Keldeo or other defensive Pokemon such as Politoed, Skarmory, specially defensive Heatran, and burned Ferrothorn and spin to clear entry hazards. Be wary of Ferrothorn, however, as Knock Off can hurt Tentacruel's longevity, and it can deal a good chunk to Tentacruel with Power Whip if it does not fear Scald burns. In addition, switching into Politoed is not optimal if it can be avoided, as Scald burns can severely inhibit Tentacruel's ability to spin and check the Pokemon it needs to, and Politoed can also use Refresh to remove any status you afflict upon it. If entry hazards are not an immediately pressing issue and the opponent has Dragon-types or a Jellicent, feel free to use Toxic in order to cripple them as they switch in. If your opponent's main switch-in to Tentacruel is Ferrothorn, use Scald often to chip it down and potentially burn it. Burning Ferrothorn is doubly beneficial for Tentacruel, as it means that Ferrothorn really cannot do much damage back and reduces Tentacruel's future burden of clearing entry hazards. Depending on the matchup and situation, you may be forced to be a bit more cavalier with Tentacruel. For example, if Stealth Rock and Spikes are present on your side of the field, spinning may be more of a pressing issue than if there is only Stealth Rock up, unless you have multiple Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon such as Thundurus-T, Tornadus, Gyarados, Kyurem-B, and Volcarona.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Politoed is the best partner for Tentacruel, as it provides rain support for Tentacruel's Scald and Rain Dish. In return, Tentacruel can remove entry hazards for Politoed, as it is vulnerable to all three types. Ferrothorn has excellent type synergy with Tentacruel and can provide support for your team by means of entry hazards. Also, it can provide counterplay against Reuniclus in the form of Worry Seed if you inflict Toxic on it. Thundurus-T, Tornadus, and Volcarona are all great offensive Pokemon on rain teams and are all vulnerable to Stealth Rock, as well as Spikes and Toxic Spikes in Volcarona's case. Thundurus-T also threatens Jellicent, which is one of Tentacruel's biggest roadblocks when attempting to spin. Breloom is a good partner for Tentacruel, as it can threaten Jellicent, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn, all of which are problems for rain teams in general and Pokemon Tentacruel cannot beat unless they are inflicted with status on the switch. Jirachi makes a good partner because it counters Reuniclus and it can switch into Latios, which is otherwise a huge threat to Tentacruel. Mamoswine is a good teammate for Tentacruel as well, as it can pick off Thundurus-T, Tornadus, Dragonite, Latios, and Garchomp with Ice Shard, all of which pose a large threat to Tentacruel. In return, Tentacruel's Rapid Spin support will keep Mamoswine from being worn down too quickly as a result of entry hazard and Life Orb damage.</p> "

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>Slowbro has many talents to offer a team, even in the OU tier. The fact that Slowbro is one of the best Fighting-type checks is often overlooked; it can handle Terrakion, Keldeo, and Conkeldurr quite well. It's also an excellent physical Dragon-type check; Garchomp, Salamence, and Dragonite are heavily dented or OHKOed by Ice Beam. Slowbro also has a fantastic ability in Regenerator, which greatly increases its walling capabilities. Not only does Slowbro get a recovery move in Slack Off, but it also has amazing physical bulk to back it up. Though mediocre, Slowbro's Special Defense can allow it to survive a strong blow. Slowbro does not only shines on the defensive side, as its Special Attack is high enough to make use of, especially when combined with its great coverage. Slowbro can also turn its horrid Speed into a powerful weapon thanks to Trick Room. There's more: Slowbro is one of the few Psychic-types that doesn't mind taking a Pursuit from the likes of Tyranitar and Scizor.</p> <p>However, Slowbro has many flaws that make it undesirable to some players. It is extremely slow, so it cannot outspeed any notable threats besides Ferrothorn. Slowbro is also outmatched by certain Water-types when it comes to team support; Jellicent is a much better option in that department. All in all, while Slowbro has some flaws, it possesses many qualities that make it a great choice on a variety of teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There are very few other options for Slowbro. It can run a Life Orb tank set, which Regenerator complements quite nicely, healing any damage incurred by Life Orb's recoil; such a set would run Slack Off, Surf, and two coverage moves. Slowbro can run a Calm Mind set, but it needs several boosts to have a chance of sweeping, providing more time for a powerful attacker to come in and cripple Slowbro, and is outclassed for the most part by Jirachi and Latias as a bulky boosting sweeper. Finally, Grass Knot can be used on offensive sets if your team has trouble with Gastrodon</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Celebi, Chansey, Blissey, and Gastrodon are the best counters to Slowbro. They can brush off anything that defensive Slowbro can do and beat it one-on-one. Latias, Latios, Amoonguss, Starmie, Rotom-W, and Jellicent are also good checks to offensive Slowbro, as they can wall the majority of its attacks and defeat him without difficulty. Slowbro is lacking in the Special Defense department, so special attackers, such as Jolteon, Thundurus-T, and Magnezone, are the best offensive checks. While Breloom cannot switch into Slowbro's Psychic-type attacks, it can OHKO Slowbro with Bullet Seed if it hits at least three times. Choice Band Tyranitar is the only Pursuit user Slowbro actually has to worry about, as Tyranitar can 2HKO Slowbro with Pursuit. Ferrothorn, defensive Politoed with Toxic, Kyurem-B and Kyurem with Substitute, Tentacruel with Toxic in rain, SubCM Jirachi, Hydreigon, and Ninetales are all good checks as well; most of them cannot wall or switch into some of Slowbro's attacks, but they can land a KO on Slowbro in the right situation. Finally, anything that can seriously injure Slowbro but can't switch into it prevents Slowbro from switching in, making it much more difficult to use effectively. For example, Scizor's STAB Bug-type moves can seriously dent Slowbro. However, it must be wary of Flamethrower and Fire Blast. It might be difficult to wear down Slowbro, as it constantly heal itself with Regenerator, but any powerful special attacker will usually take it down in one shot.</p> ",

        "name": "Physical Wall",
        "description": "<p>With access to an amazing ability in Regenerator, a reliable healing move in Slack Off, a great defensive typing, and a respectable Defense stat, Slowbro works well as a physical wall. This set allows Slowbro to counter almost every Fighting-type, including Terrakion, Conkeldurr, and Lucario. In fact, Breloom is the only physical attacker in OU that can OHKO Slowbro at full HP without any set-up. Scald is Slowbro's primary STAB move, potentially crippling the opponent with its 30% burn chance. Ice Beam is a great coverage move, especially against Dragon-types; in particular, Salamence and Dragonite are OHKOed after Stealth Rock damage with Ice Beam, while Garchomp is 2HKOed by it. There are two alternatives for the third moveslot. Psychic allows Slowbro to counter dangerous Pokemon such as Conkeldurr, SubDD Gyarados, Toxicroak, and Cloyster, which it would otherwise lose against one-on-one. On the other hand, Thunder Wave is a great option to cripple fast special attackers that like to switch into Slowbro, such as Latios and Rotom-W, and gives it a means of supporting the entire team. Slack Off fills the final moveslot, allowing Slowbro to stay in prime condition while enhancing its ability as a physical wall by lengthening its lifespan.</p> <p>19 Speed IVs ensure standard Conkeldurr outspeeds Slowbro so the latter never takes full damage from Payback, Conkeldurr's most powerful attack against it. Psyshock can be used as a secondary STAB move in this set, as it hits Calm Mind Keldeo, Terrakion in the sand, and Gyarados harder than any other move Slowbro has. Toxic can be used to cripple Pokemon that like to switch into Slowbro, such as Latias, Jellicent, and Cresselia. Flamethrower is a viable option as well; it 2HKOes Ferrothorn outside of rain, OHKOes 248/0 Scizor 81% of the time, and brings 252/0 Forretress down to its Sturdy. However, Fire Blast does even more damage in exchange for less accuracy, OHKOing every variant of Scizor bar the bulky Swords Dance set. Thanks to Regenerator, you have the option of replacing Slack Off with another move; be warned though that this significantly decreases Slowbro's longevity.</p> <p>Despite having a decent Special Defense stat, Slowbro always appreciates partners that can sponge powerful special attacks for it. Blissey and Chansey are fantastic special walls that can take special attacks for Slowbro, while Slowbro covers the physical Fighting-type attacks they are weak to. Celebi is a great partner for Slowbro, as it covers its Electric and Grass weaknesses and is able to take on many of the special attackers that it cannot, such as Latios, Latias, and Thundurus-T. However, Celebi shares Bug-, Dark-, and Ghost-type weaknesses with Slowbro, so be sure to carry a teammate that covers those types. Amoonguss has Regenerator and solid defensive synergy with Slowbro, allowing them to form an effective Regenerator core. Amoonguss can also handle Breloom, a major threat to Slowbro. Heatran combined with Slowbro and Amoonguss forms a potent defensive Fire / Water / Grass core; it can also deal with Magnezone and specially defensive Celebi, which threaten the rest of the core. Finally, Breloom, Scizor, and Choice Band Tyranitar are massive threats to this set if they manage to get in safely; Skarmory handles all three of them while being able to set up Spikes in certain situations.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Although Slowbro is widely known for its formidable bulk, it can still make use of its respectable base 100 Special Attack with Choice Specs. With Trick, Slowbro has the ability to cripple opposing walls by exchanging items with them. Slowbro also doesn't mind switching in and out of entry hazards thanks to Regenerator, which makes it stand out from fellow Choice item users. Furthermore, it can still take advantage of wonderful bulk; this Slowbro's ability to take hits and dish them out makes it unique.</p> <p>Surf is powerful, being Slowbro's primary STAB move. Fire Blast is a great coverage move against the many Steel-type Pokemon roaming the OU metagame, including Ferrothorn. It can also handle Grass-types such as Breloom. The secondary STAB move chosen in the third moveslot depends on your preference. Psyshock helps Slowbro break through special walls; while Psychic cannot achieve this, it is stronger and can OHKO most Conkeldurr. The final moveslot presents another choice. Trick is the recommended option, ruining the foe's strategy by forcing it to stick to one move. However, Ice Beam and Shadow Ball are both useful coverage moves to have against Dragon-, Psychic-, and Ghost-type Pokemon that would otherwise wall Slowbro, such as Latios, Latias, Hydreigon, Jellicent, and Starmie, so it depends on what threatens the rest of your team.</p> <p>Regardless of Speed investment, Slowbro won't outspeed anything significant, so 252 EVs are placed in HP to give it as much bulk as possible, while 252 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature maximize its power. Regenerator is the ability of choice, allowing Slowbro to switch in and out freely without being too affected by entry hazards. 19 Speed IVs make Slowbro slower than standard Conkeldurr, letting it avoid double damage from Payback, Conkeldurr's strongest attack against it. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast; while it lacks the raw power Fire Blast provides, it has higher accuracy, which makes it more reliable.</p> <p>Teammates that can take advantage of the Pokemon that Slowbro lures and destroys are good partners. Slowbro can lure Ferrothorn onto the field and defeat it with Fire Blast, so any Pokemon that benefits from having Ferrothorn removed will work well with Slowbro; Choice item-holding Keldeo, Double Dance Thundurus-T, and Kyurem-B are a few examples of note. Because Slowbro is going to be switching in and out often with this set, Choice Band Tyranitar's Pursuit is dangerous, so having partners that can defeat Tyranitar, such as Landorus-T and Terrakion (though has to be wary of Superpower in Terrakion's case), are recommended. Slowbro is vulnerable to faster Electric-type attackers such as Thundurus-T and Jolteon, so using Gastrodon and Celebi as partners is recommended. Celebi can also handle Jellicent, a Pokemon that is difficult for Slowbro to defeat thanks to its great bulk, while not being bothered by a stray Toxic or Will-O-Wisp. When Psyshock is not used, Slowbro has difficulty defeating special walls, such as Blissey and Jellicent, so physical attackers, such as Terrakion and Breloom, work well with Slowbro. Latios and Calm Mind Latias both give Slowbro trouble, with the latter being able to set up against Slowbro. Specially defensive Jirachi can handle both of them, walling them easily and potentially paralyzing them with Body Slam or Thunder Wave.</p> "

With its offensive presence, formidable bulk, and access to healing via Regenerator, Slowbro has all the necessary tools it needs to function as a successful offensive Trick Room user. This set is mostly used late-game to clean up any scraps its team's sweepers may have left. However, thanks to Regenerator, Slowbro is one of the few Trick Room sweepers that can be useful throughout the entire game due to its ability to act as a pivot and hit-and-run attacker. Trick Room allows Slowbro to outspeed nearly every Pokemon in the OU tier bar Ferrothorn. Surf is Slowbro's main STAB move, while Psyshock or Psychic are the options for its secondary STAB—a choice between power and \"mixed\" attacking. The choice for the final move depends on the coverage needed; Ice Beam nails Dragon- and Grass-types, while Shadow Ball hits Jellicent and Starmie for great damage while still covering some Dragon- and Grass-types, such as Latios, Latias, and Celebi.</p> <p>Life Orb enhances Slowbro's power, and it doesn't have to worry about the recoil damage thanks to Regenerator healing any excess damage Slowbro might have incurred. A Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs minimize Slowbro's Speed, allowing it to move before almost every OU threat under Trick Room. An EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA can be used if you wish for Slowbro to play a more defensive role, making it more of a pure Trick Room supporter. If that path is taken, it's advised to drop one of Slowbro's attacks for Slack Off to maintain its lifespan. Leftovers should be replaced with Life Orb as well if Slowbro runs the defensive EV spread. Finally, Fire Blast is an option in the final moveslot to deal with Steel-types, specifically Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Many slow hard hitters appreciate being paired with Slowbro, as it can set up Trick Room for them. Examples of such Pokemon are Magnezone, which can remove Ferrothorn, making it easier for Slowbro to sweep; Conkeldurr, which can get past Ferrothorn and Jellicent easily; and Reuniclus, which is another excellent Trick Room sweeper that can clean up after Slowbro weakens the opposition. Ferrothorn and Forretress can be used with Slowbro as well for a more defensive route, as they can make use of their Speed to set up entry hazards. They also can take numerous attacks that are super effective against Slowbro, such as Ghost-, Bug-, Grass-, and Dark-type moves. Entry hazards to weaken the adversary are also appreciated; Ferrothorn is a great entry hazard setter to pair with Slowbro, covering its weaknesses quite well. Slowbro has no way of reliably defeating Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Jirachi, so Heatran and Magnezone are prime choices to handle them; the former can roast almost every Steel-type it encounters, while the latter can trap and kill the Steel-types quite easily with Hidden Power Fire.</p> "

Perhaps the second most viable set that Magneton can run is a SubCharge set consisting of Thunderbolt / Charge Beam / Substitute / Hidden Power Ice. However, it takes too long to set up, and the only Steel-type that this set can really beat is Ferrothorn. Magneton can use Thunder Wave to decent effect, as it can slow down faster threats such as Terrakion. However, Magneton is too frail to use this move effectively. Magneton can also use Signal Beam and Hidden Power Ground to hit Celebi and Heatran, respectively, but outside of these specific situations, these moves are not very useful. Finally, Magneton can use its alternate ability, Analytic, to boost its power if it attacks last, but this prevents Magneton from fulfilling its main niche in the OU environment: trapping Steel-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Although Magneton's Special Attack stat is great, its subpar movepool and defenses mean that it isn't very difficult to counter. Gastrodon is able to withstand whatever Magneton dishes out at it and threaten it out with Earth Power. Chansey and Blissey are able to withstand even the most powerful of Magneton's attacks, heal off the damage with Wish, and wear it down with Seismic Toss. Apart from the rare Signal Beam, Celebi isn't fazed by anything Magneton carries. Specially defensive Heatran falls into a similar category as Celebi with the exception that it can immediately threaten Magneton with Lava Plume. Ferrothorn must watch out for Hidden Power Fire, but apart from that, it is able to take whatever Magneton throws at it and set up entry hazards. Latios and Latias can take even a super effective Hidden Power Ice and either heavily dent Magneton with a rain-boosted Surf or use it as setup bait with Calm Mind. Specially defensive Hippowdon can take up to two Hidden Power Ices and OHKO Magneton with Earthquake. Ground-types in general make solid answers to Magneton, as they can block Volt Switch and only fear Hidden Power Ice. Finally, if you lack any defensive answers to Magneton, then revenge killing it with either Breloom or faster Choice Scarf users, such as Terrakion, is always an option.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With this set, Magneton is able to trap and revenge kill a variety of Steel-types, including Lucario, Skarmory, and Forretress. Magneton's higher Speed allows it to get the jump on threats, such as +1 Dragonite and Starmie, that could easily destroy Choice Scarf Magnezone. Volt Switch functions as Magneton's main STAB move, giving it the ability to maintain momentum and escape out of unfavorable situations. Hidden Power Ice is a key coverage move in Magneton's arsenal, as it keeps Dragon-types such as Salamence, Garchomp, and most notably, +1 Dragonite in check. Hidden Power Fire can be used to eliminate Ferrothorn, a threat that would otherwise completely wall this set, and it is also useful to OHKO Scizor before it can U-turn out or KO Magneton with Superpower. However, it leaves Magneton unable to revenge kill Dragon Dance Dragonite, which would otherwise be one of its main advantages over Magnezone. Thunderbolt functions as Magneton's alternate Electric STAB move and is very useful in situations where switching out is unfavorable. Its higher Base Power is also helpful against Steel-types such as Lucario and Scizor if Magneton lacks Hidden Power Fire. In the final slot, Flash Cannon is used to hit Terrakion, Tyranitar, Mamoswine, and Kyurem-B for super effective damage. It is also Magneton's best move against Ground-types if it lacks Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Magneton to outspeed everything up to +1 Dragonite. Because this particular Magneton set lacks power, entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Forretress, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn is recommended. While it's not required, rain support from Politoed is recommended if Magneton is not using Hidden Power Fire, as it allows Magneton to use its more powerful STAB move, Thunder, and neutralizes its Fire weakness. Latias and Latios are also amazing partners for Magneton, as they not only have perfect defensive synergy but can also punch large holes into the foe's team without Steel-types there to stop them. Scizor is a very good partner because of its ability to sweep teams once Steel-types are removed. It also can bring Magneton in safely with a slow U-turn. Magneton can also function in a playstyle known as DragMag, where it works together with its evolution, Magnezone, to eliminate all of the foe's Steel-types, allowing Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Garchomp to sweep the foe's team.</p> "

  "Cloyster": {
    "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced around the time BW was the main generation. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to the current BW OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>In BW, Cloyster received a gift it could only have dreamed of in previous generations: Shell Smash. With one of the best boosting moves around, Cloyster now finds itself being able to perform an entirely different role as a very threatening sweeper. Taking Cloyster's Skill Link ability into account, it essentially has a 125 Base Power Icicle Spear and Rock Blast, which at +2 Attack will destroy anything that lacks a resistance to it or great bulk. Its Water-type move of choice also makes sure that Steel-types aren't surefire counters, as a +2 STAB Hydro Pump or Razor Shell will inflict huge damage to most of them.</p> <p>However, Cloyster isn't without its flaws. Its Ice typing leaves it with crippling weaknesses to Stealth Rock and Mach Punch, as well as only a neutrality to Bullet Punch. With Breloom and Scizor being so prevalent, vulnerability to priority is a major issue. Cloyster also has trouble getting past bulky Water-types, such as Jellicent and Vaporeon, which can burn or phaze it and thus prevent a sweep, as well as Keldeo, one of the most threatening Pokemon in the OU tier. All in all, Cloyster takes some skill to use effectively, but when set up, it is extremely dangerous.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Explosion could see use on one of Cloyster's sets, but with the mechanics change in BW, it is much less effective and thus better off not being used. Cloyster can potentially use a defensive utility set with Rapid Spin and Spikes support, but Cloyster's terrible Ice typing undermines this role. Also, a Choice Scarf set can come in handy for checking faster threats such as Dragonite, Virizion, Tornadus, Latios, and Infernape, among others. However, it is generally not recommended, as Cloyster's lack of power is usually its downfall without Shell Smash to boost its stats.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Being part Ice-type is a double-edged sword for Cloyster. On one hand, it gains an awesome STAB move, but on the other, it takes 25% damage from Stealth Rock whenever it switches in, and is liable to being hit by both Spikes and Toxic Spikes. For this reason, having Stealth Rock on the field is a good first answer to Cloyster. A Bullet Punch from Choice Band Scizor will 2HKO Cloyster after it has taken Stealth Rock damage, while the only thing Cloyster can do back is Hydro Pump, which fails to OHKO Scizor even at +2, leaving aside the fact that it has shaky accuracy; if rain is up, however, Scizor will be easily OHKOed. Mach Punch users are also Cloyster's worst enemies; Life Orb Adamant Breloom has a fairly high chance to OHKO without Shell Smash's Defense drop after Stealth Rock damage, while unboosted Conkeldurr can 2HKO. As Cloyster is incredibly fast after Shell Smash, there aren't many Choice Scarf users that can outspeed it after it gets a boost. However, Latios can do so and will send the clam sinking back to the briny depths with Draco Meteor.</p> <p>Generally speaking, bulky Water-types and Steel-types can handle Cloyster. Bulky Rotom-W resists Cloyster's STAB moves and can take a Rock Blast. It can promptly OHKO Cloyster with Thunderbolt, making it a good switch-in to it in general. Jellicent and Tentacruel also have the capability to annoy Cloyster greatly. Both can use Scald on Cloyster and hope for a burn, among other options; Will-O-Wisp from Jellicent will help prevent Cloyster from being a huge problem, while Tentacruel can use Toxic, which will quickly wear Cloyster down when used in tandem with Protect. Slowbro is another bulky Water-type that can tank anything Cloyster can throw at it and target its weaker Special Defense stat with Psychic or Flamethrower; it can also use Thunder Wave on Cloyster to cripple it for the rest of the game. Keldeo deserves a special mention for being an offensive Water-type that can survive +2 Cloyster's offensive artillery with some health to spare.</p> <p>Skarmory can't do much actual damage to Cloyster, but can Whirlwind it out to prevent the immediate problem, getting rid of Cloyster's stat boosts. Specially defensive Jirachi can quite easily take Cloyster's Water STAB move and retaliate with Thunder on a Calm Mind version or Body Slam and Iron Head on a physical version. Ferrothorn can take a +2 Icicle Spear and either hit back with Power Whip or cripple Cloyster with Thunder Wave. Thanks to Unaware ignoring Shell Smash boosts, Quagsire can take Icicle Spear nicely and Toxic Cloyster back, or even hope to burn it with Scald. A slightly unusual but effective option to deal with Cloyster is specially defensive Heatran; if Hydro Pump is favored over Razor Shell on Cloyster, it will be unable to OHKO Heatran even at +2. In return, Heatran will OHKO Cloyster with Lava Plume after Stealth Rock damage. Take note, however, that if rain is up, Heatran will be destroyed by any Water-type move from Cloyster.</p> ",

        "name": "Shell Smash",
        "description": "<p>Cloyster's main set is one that can sweep most teams with ease; in fact, it's a liability to have a bulky Ground-type when your opponent has a Cloyster. This set is best used on an offensive team, where other sweepers can open up holes in defensive cores for Cloyster to take advantage of. Shell Smash doubles Cloyster's Attack, Special Attack, and Speed to threatening levels. Icicle Spear is the perfect move for Cloyster; because of Skill Link, it will always hit five times, effectively making it a 125 Base Power STAB move. Rock Blast offers great coverage with Icicle Spear, hitting Fire-, Water-, and Ice-types for at least neutral damage.</p> <p>In the last slot, Ice Shard is preferred to prevent Choice Scarf Latios and Breloom from revenge killing Cloyster, as well as providing a useful priority check against Landorus-T, Tornadus, Thundurus-T, and Dragon-types. However, you may also choose a Water-type STAB move to hit Steel-types, among others, hard. After a Shell Smash, Razor Shell OHKOes Tyranitar and Heatran without rain and Scizor with rain after Stealth Rock damage. Razor Shell also inflicts the most damage to specially defensive Jirachi, and it can wear down physically bulky opponents with its 50% chance to lower their Defense by one stage. Hydro Pump is the preferred option for getting past Skarmory, Forretress, and non-specially defensive Scizor since it hits their weaker Special Defense; however, it loses out on taking out specially defensive Tyranitar and Heatran with Stealth Rock support.</p> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Cloyster to outspeed Choice Scarf Latios with Hidden Power Fire. Full investment in Attack bolsters the power of Icicle Spear, Rock Blast, and Razor Shell greatly. If Cloyster is running Hydro Pump, a Naive nature should be used to boost Speed while not detracting from Hydro Pump's power.</p> <p>Never-Melt Ice augments the power of Cloyster's signature multi-hit and priority moves. Other alternative items include White Herb to restore Cloyster's high Defense, cushioning it from priority attacks, such as a Breloom's Mach Punch, and Keldeo's unboosted Secret Sword (watch out for its STAB Hydro Pump, though). Focus Sash allows Cloyster to set up on even the most powerful of special attackers, but due to the abundance of entry hazards, sandstorm, and priority, Focus Sash is easily broken without proper Rapid Spin and weather support. Cloyster can usually find setup opportunities without the aid of Focus Sash, as well. Life Orb grants Cloyster some notable KOs after a Shell Smash, such as on Ferrothorn with Icicle Spear and bulky Rotom-W with Rock Blast.</p> <p>If using Cloyster on a sun team, Hidden Power Fire should be used instead of the Water-type attack, as it can hit Steel-types while getting pseudo-STAB. However, this leaves Cloyster walled by Heatran, which already gives sun teams problems, so using Cloyster on a sun team is not recommended. That said, using Cloyster in conjunction with rain support from Politoed is an excellent decision. By boosting the power of Hydro Pump or Razor Shell, rain allows Cloyster to defeat checks such as Conkeldurr, specially defensive Jirachi, specially defensive Forretress, and Magnezone after it sets up.</p> <p>Dual screens are also great support for Cloyster; with Reflect up, Cloyster can survive Jolly Choice Band Terrakion's Close Combat, even after switching into one layer of Spikes. Espeon is a fantastic partner, as its ability, Magic Bounce, bounces back entry hazards and Taunt, which gives Cloyster an easier time setting up. Entry hazard support is also greatly appreciated, as with just Stealth Rock up, Cloyster can OHKO Choice Scarf Rotom-W and Choice Scarf Politoed most of the time. Both Forretress and Ferrothorn have good synergy, but Forretress can also utilize Rapid Spin to aid Cloyster. Another useful teammate is Magnezone, since it can trap and KO troublesome Pokemon such as Scizor, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn, giving Cloyster a much easier time sweeping.</p> "

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>While Chansey was once completely outclassed by her older sister Blissey, Eviolite has transformed her into one of the most bulky Pokemon in the entire game. Eviolite boosts both of Chansey's defensive stats by 50%, making her a fantastic mixed wall. The only downside to holding Eviolite is that it forces Chansey to lose out on precious Leftovers recovery; however, this is essentially a non-issue, as with an efficient EV spread, Chansey is still able to take hits better than Blissey ever could. As if all this weren't enough, Chansey is able to act as an amazing team supporter thanks to Wish's new mechanic, which heals teammates with 50% of the user's max HP. Since Chansey's HP stat is tremendous, she can pass massive 352 HP Wishes to any Pokemon on her team, keeping them completely healthy throughout the duration of the match.</p> <p>However, it isn't all good news for the Egg Pokemon. Chansey is still severely hindered by her downright-terrible base 35 Special Attack stat, forcing her to rely upon Seismic Toss and Toxic to deal damage to opposing Pokemon. This means that Ghost-types with Substitute, especially the ever-dangerous Gengar, will be a tremendous problem for her to take on (and to a lesser extent, Pokemon who can utilize 101 HP Substitutes). Additionally, while Chansey is ridiculously bulky, physical STAB Fighting-type attacks, such as Terrakion's Close Combat, will still take her down in a flash. Overall, Chansey is an amazingly bulky wall who can take almost any attack thrown at her with aplomb, so you should utilize her as such.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Counter is a pretty cool option, as thanks to Chansey's incredible HP stat and low Defense stat, Counter will often net a KO on physical attackers. Light Screen is an okay option, as it allows other teammates to easily tank special attacks, but this role is often better filled by Cresselia and Bronzong. Skill Swap can be used to stop Reuniclus from destroying your team. Psych Up has some value in that it can go through Substitutes and thus steals defensive boosts such as a Quiver Dance or a Calm Mind boost from a Jirachi, Reuniclus, or Celebi, but it has little use outside of that.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The large list of Fighting-types in OU are the best way to keep Chansey in check; Terrakion, Breloom, Keldeo, Infernape, Conkeldurr, and Lucario are all Pokemon that can switch in pretty easily and force Chansey out. However, some of these must be wary of Thunder Wave on the switch. Conkeldurr is probably the most consistent Fighting-type switch-in, as it doesn't care about Toxic or Thunder Wave. Any strong physical attacker with high-powered STAB attacks or Fighting-type coverage can usually muscle past Chansey. Strong Ground- and Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Choice Band Dragonite, and Double Dance Landorus-T can easily get past Chansey or force it out.</p> <p>Calm Mind Reuniclus gives Chansey hell thanks to Magic Guard and Recover, and can easily get past Chansey with Psyshock. Stallbreakers such as Gliscor, Reuniclus, and Gengar easily force Chansey to switch. Gliscor is immune to status thanks to Poison Heal and can Taunt Chansey due to its higher base Speed. Reuniclus has Magic Guard and can use Chansey as setup bait. Gengar is immune to Toxic and Seismic Toss and can use Chansey's own health to its advantage via Pain Split and can also carry Taunt. Magic Bounce users such as Xatu and Espeon can easily bounce back status inducing moves and Stealth Rock. Finally, Trick users such as Latios and Rotom-W cripple Chansey by replacing her beloved Eviolite with a handicap.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Chansey is a great option if your team is in need of a cleric or Wish passer. This is mainly due to Chansey's incredible bulk, allowing her to tank nearly any special attack, and a lot of unboosted physical attacks. This set is often compared to Blissey, who is less bulky but has the advantage of being viable on sand and hail stall teams as well as a usable Special Attack stat. However, on rain and sun stall teams, Chansey is the better choice thanks to her superior bulk.</p> <p>Soft-Boiled keeps Chansey healthy throughout the match, as without Leftovers recovery, Chansey gets worn down pretty easily by residual damage in the form of entry hazards, sand, hail, and repeated attacks. Aromatherapy allows Chansey to heal her teammates and prevents Chansey from being Toxic stalled, allowing Chansey to further support the team. Aromatherapy should be used in conjunction with Soft-Boiled. However, Chansey is also a very viable Wish passer thanks to her incredible HP stat. Protect should be used instead of Aromatherapy if you plan to use Wish with Chansey, as it allows Chansey to heal herself and scout out the opponent. Wish allows Chansey to fully heal many Pokemon regardless of whether they invest in HP themselves thanks to Chansey's incredible HP stat. Toxic allows Chansey to wear down the opponent, and is Chansey's main way of damaging the opponent. Seismic Toss prevents Chansey from becoming complete setup bait by sweepers (especially most Substitute users trying to avoid Toxic), and allows her to reliably damage the opposition without worrying about her low offenses.</p> <p>The EVs have been heavily invested in both HP and physical defense, making Chansey one of the best mixed walls in the tier. Investing into physical defense also means that Alakazam and Latios have no chance in getting past Chansey with Psyshock, as well as always avoiding the 2HKO from Hydreigon's Superpower. Wish can be paired with Soft-Boiled to reduce Chansey's dependence on receiving her own Wish, but Protect is generally better, as it allows you to scout your opponent and Toxic stall. Thunder Wave is an option to better deal with fast sweepers such as Volcarona while also statusing Fighting-types such as Lucario and Terrakion on the switch. Chansey can also use Stealth Rock, as Chansey forces a lot of switches pretty nicely. Stealth Rock also allows you to stall out Gengar, which can often be troubling for Chansey.</p> <p>Chansey functions well on stall and other defensive teams that appreciate Chansey's ability to heal her teammates from status. Politoed is a great partner, as Politoed prevents sand and hail damage from wearing down Chansey, while Chansey heals Politoed of any kind of status. Latias also has great synergy with Chansey, as it takes on Fighting-type attackers such as Breloom and Keldeo, both of which can easily muscle through Chansey. Pairing Skarmory up with Chansey creates a very neat core, though this core has become less effective this generation thanks to mixed attackers such as Keldeo, Infernape, Hydreigon, and Kyurem-B. Dragonite is a very viable tank on rain teams, as with Multiscale and Dragon Tail it can wall just about any special attacker that Chansey can't, such as Reuniclus, Keldeo, and Jirachi. Bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Ferrothorn are great partners for Chansey, mainly because they can easily switch into physical attacks, set up entry hazards, and force switches with Stun Spore and Leech Seed, respectively. Be careful when using both Ferrothorn and Chansey together, as they do share a Fighting-type weakness.</p> <p>Chansey also functions really well on sun stall teams. Ninetales really likes Chansey's ability to switch into rain-boosted attacks easily, while also keeping Ninetales free from status. Slowbro is a pretty good partner, as the two have good synergy together. Be careful however, as using both Slowbro and Chansey can make you very weak to Breloom. Cresselia is a sturdy wall on sun teams and has nice synergy with Chansey, but their roles often overlap with each other, meaning there can be some redundancy. Donphan and Forretress are two spinners that fit very nicely on sun teams. Donphan has its Water weakness reduced and checks physical attacks pretty nicely, while Forretress can tank just about any physical attacker while also providing support in the form of entry hazards and Rapid Spin. Sableye is the best option for a spinblocker on sun teams, and shares excellent synergy with Chansey. Sableye is also one of the best counters to Reuniclus, a Pokemon that often gives Chansey a headache, while it can also burn physical attackers, taking pressure off of Chansey.</p> <p>Entry hazards are annoying for Chansey to switch into, so having a spinner is important. Donphan, Tentacruel, and Forretress can both Rapid Spin and appreciate Chansey's huge Wishes and her ability to come in on special attacks. They also can set up entry hazards, wearing down the opposing team. Finally, Landorus-T is one of the best switch-ins to Terrakion and Scizor, two Pokemon that often use Chansey as setup bait.</p> <p>The main advantages of using Chansey over Blissey are that Chansey has much better overall bulk and can actually take quite a few physical attacks. Blissey, however, has Leftovers, making her a much better choice on sand hail teams, as the recoil from sand and hail really undermines Chansey's bulk. This means Chansey is more viable on sun and rain teams, meaning Ninetales and Politoed are the best partners for Chansey.</p> "

  "Starmie": {
    "overview": "<p>Starmie is one of the best offensive spinners in OU and a staple on many offensive teams. Starmie's great Speed, decent power, and broad coverage make it a great revenge killer that is difficult for all but dedicated special walls to switch into; this difficulty is only magnified under the common field condition of rain. With Analytic, even these dedicated special walls might quickly find themselves overwhelmed. Thanks to these traits, Starmie can get past every OU spinblocker. Aside from functioning as an offensive spinner, Starmie can perform defensive duties, as it has access to the combination of Recover and Natural Cure, something that no other spinner has, giving it great durability and many chances to clear the field of entry hazards.</p> <p>Even though Starmie's typing gives it good STABs, it also gives it an unfortunate weakness to Pursuit, which Tyranitar, an ubiquitous Pokemon, can capitalize on. Another problem for Starmie is that, even though it is not easy to wall, Pokemon that wall it are very popular. Ferrothorn and specially defensive Celebi are both omnipresent Pokemon that can shut down Starmie while carrying Stealth Rock themselves (and Spikes in Ferrothorn's case), preventing Starmie from using Rapid Spin as long as they are on the field. Finally, Starmie is frail, even for an offensive Pokemon, meaning that it fails to find as many switch-in opportunities as it would want in a metagame where rain-boosted Water-type attacks are everywhere.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Starmie can use a dual screens set, but it faces major competition from Azelf, which has Stealth Rock and Taunt over Starmie, making it a more successful Pokemon in that role overall. However, Starmie does have some advantages over Azelf, and those are Water-type STAB, Recover, Natural Cure, and Rapid Spin, so make sure to take advantage of them. Hidden Power Fire can be used on any set if Starmie is being used on a sun team, mainly to hit Ferrothorn and Scizor, two Pokemon that can hit Starmie hard and Starmie can't properly damage otherwise under sun, and even outside of it in Ferrothorn's case. Hidden Power Grass and Grass Knot are options for teams that struggle with Gastrodon and Rotom-W while still hitting most Water-types, such as Jellicent and Politoed. However, Starmie loses coverage on Flying-types and Tentacruel, leaving it easier to wall in general. Signal Beam can be used on any offensive set to 2HKO Celebi, one of Starmie's hardest enemies to remove. When used on a hail team, Starmie can opt to use Blizzard over Ice Beam, increasing its damage output. Thunder Wave allows Starmie to support its team and cripple some of its usual switch-ins, including Latias, Kyurem, and Kyurem-B. Starmie can also support its team by changing the weather to more favorable or less threatening conditions with Rain Dance or Hail. This strategy is usually only effective if the opponent's weather starter is down, though. Rain Dance powers up Starmie's Water-type STAB moves but is redundant against rain teams, while Hail is only usable to cancel out the opponent's weather but is effective against all of the most popular weathers.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Chansey and specially defensive Celebi are the best counters to Starmie, as they are able to handle every single one of Starmie's sets with no worries, except for the rare Trick and the even rarer offensive sets with Analytic. Ferrothorn completely walls Starmie, can punish the use of Rapid Spin with Iron Barbs, and can OHKO back with Power Whip while only fearing a Scald burn from defensive variants, which admittedly troubles Ferrothorn a lot. Blissey can take on most Starmie variants easily, fearing only Psyshock from Life Orb and Choice Specs variants and Trick. Calm Mind Latias can switch into anything Starmie has, except for Life Orb-boosted Ice Beam, and start setting up on it, making it an excellent check to Starmie. Defensive variants of Kyurem-B wall most offensive sets of Starmie and can set up on them, but can't switch into defensive Starmie so well, in fear of a Scald burn, which would neuter Kyurem-B. Kyurem makes for a very good switch-in to defensive Starmie, as unlike Kyurem-B it doesn't mind getting burned, and can set up a Substitute to comfortably start attacking. All offensive versions of Kyurem and Kyurem-B can also check offensive Starmie with Leftovers pretty well, avoiding the 2HKO from all of its moves even with Stealth Rock up. All Jellicent variants are also very good checks to Starmie, walling Starmie's defensive set and preventing Rapid Spin from working. Furthermore, physically defensive Jellicent walls offensive Starmie sets with Psyshock while specially defensive Jellicent walls offensive Starmie sets with Thunderbolt (Thunder 2HKOes both variants easily though). Rotom-W, especially the specially defensive set, is an excellent switch-in to Starmie, resisting Hydro Pump and not fearing any of its coverage moves aside from Life Orb or Choice Specs-boosted Psyshock and Thunder. Amoonguss is a good check to Starmie that lack Psyshock, as it is able to switch into anything but Ice Beam and 2HKO Starmie with Giga Drain. Any Starmie set that lacks Ice Beam can be taken advantage of by the various Dragon-types that reside in OU, such as Dragonite and Latios.</p> <p>Pursuit users have the potential to eliminate Starmie under certain circumstances. Tyranitar can trap and KO Starmie with Pursuit, provided it switches in as Starmie uses Rapid Spin or comes in for free in some other way and avoids getting burned from Scald. Scizor can do the same with Pursuit as long as it too gets in for free but fails to trap Life Orb and Choice Specs Starmie in rain, as those sets can OHKO with Hydro Pump. Weavile is the only Pursuit user that has the advantage of outspeeding Starmie, but like other Pursuit users, it struggles to switch into Starmie, as Hydro Pump from offensive variants threatens to OHKO and Scald from defensive sets can neuter Weavile with a burn. Finally, most faster Pokemon can revenge kill Starmie. For example, Jolteon, Alakazam, Choice Scarf Latios, Choice Scarf Terrakion, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T can all dent or OHKO Starmie, but most of them can't switch in safely.</p> ",

If accuracy is preferred over power, Surf is the next choice, but the power difference is very big and causes Starmie to miss out on many OHKOs and 2HKOs. Thunderbolt gives Starmie coverage on Water-types and is especially important as it 2HKOes physically defensive Jellicent, ensuring that Starmie can later use Rapid Spin. On the other hand, Psyshock gets STAB, hits some Pokemon that resist Water-type moves, such as Tentacruel, Breloom, and Keldeo, for super effective damage and allows Starmie to 2HKO specially defensive variants of Jellicent and Rotom-W, Kyurem-B, and Blissey, all after Stealth Rock damage. Ice Beam covers the Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Starmie's main STAB, 2HKOing most of them with a few exceptions, namely Ferrothorn, Kyurem, and Kyurem-B. Rapid Spin is Starmie's most important feature, as it clears its side of field of entry hazards, helping Starmie's teammates switch in more easily, especially those that are weak to Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Analytic is an excellent option for this set, taking advantage of the switches that Starmie forces to hit switch-ins very hard. With Stealth Rock and rain support, Analytic gives Starmie the ability to 2HKO many of its common switch-ins without even the need for prediction. In particular, Hydro Pump on a switch to specially defensive Rotom-W, specially defensive Celebi, and 252 HP Latias, followed by the appropriate coverage move, makes short work of these would-be checks or counters (one layer of Spikes is needed to get the 2HKO on Celebi). With Analytic, Life Orb, and Stealth Rock up, Starmie can also 2HKO specially defensive Jellicent with Thunderbolt, provided it switches into Starmie.</p> <p>Life Orb versus Leftovers is a choice between power and survivability. Life Orb combined with the power boost from Analytic makes Starmie a heavy hitter that is very difficult to switch into and devastating when paired with rain, but sacrifices the longevity given to it by Leftovers, a necessary item for Starmie on sand teams to keep residual damage from getting out of hand.</p> <p>If using Leftovers, Natural Cure is an alternative option over Analytic to protect your Rapid Spinner from being prematurely crippled by a status condition. Natural Cure will allow Starmie to switch into the likes of defensive Politoed and specially defensive variants of Heatran and Jirachi with relative ease. Recover is an option over Ice Beam to allow Starmie to last longer in the match and switch into bulky Water-types easier. However, Starmie usually needs all of its coverage moves, so fitting Recover in can be hard. If using Starmie on a rain team, Thunder is a great move for the second slot, as it allows Starmie to always 2HKO all Jellicent variants as long as it holds Life Orb, something no other move can achieve (Analytic-boosted Life Orb Thunder always OHKOes physically defensive Jellicent after Stealth Rock damage). If Starmie's team has problems with Ferrothorn, Hidden Power Fire can OHKO it in sunny weather with the help of Life Orb. However, it has little use outside of hitting Ferrothorn, as Hydro Pump handles most Steel-types anyway, and Starmie likes to be in rain, where Hidden Power Fire is neutered. Hidden Power Grass and Grass Knot can be used in the second slot, still covering Water-types while also hitting Gastrodon and Rotom-W hard, though the latter only with Hidden Power. Grass Knot 2HKOes Gastrodon and Jellicent, while Hidden Power Grass 2HKOes Rotom-W and Gastrodon. Expert Belt can replace either of the two two main items to take advantage of Starmie's great super effective coverage, but Starmie will miss the extra power on neutral hits that Life Orb provides and the survivability Leftovers offers.</p> <p>Starmie enjoys partners that can beat Ferrothorn, Gastrodon, Chansey, and Blissey, the only Pokemon that hard wall Starmie. Breloom is the best Pokemon for this role, easily beating all of those Pokemon one-on-one. Terrakion and Lucario are good choices as well, though they can't set up on Gastrodon like Breloom can. Scizor can either threaten those Pokemon immediately with a Choice Band set or threaten for a sweep with a Swords Dance set, while also dealing with Celebi, a big obstacle to Starmie. Politoed is a good teammate as rain boosts the power of Hydro Pump and allows Starmie to use Thunder, making Starmie even more difficult to wall. Kyurem-B and Kyurem are also problematic for Starmie, especially variants with Substitute and Roost, so Scizor, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn are good partners to help against them. Jirachi and Ferrothorn can also set up entry hazards, which Starmie appreciates to get many OHKOs and 2HKOs, such as the guaranteed 2HKO on 252 HP Latias with Ice Beam and the almost guaranteed 2HKO on 56 HP Kyurem-B with Psyshock. Outside of rain, Heatran is another Pokemon that works very well with Starmie, having good defensive synergy with it, setting up Stealth Rock, and dealing with some of Starmie's worries, such as Celebi, Ferrothorn, and Kyurem-B that lack Earth Power. Finally, Keldeo forms a potent offensive combo with Starmie, especially on rain teams, where one of them weakens the opponent's Water-type checks and counters and the other one sweeps later in the match.</p> "

        "name": "Bulky Rapid Spin",
        "description": "<p>Starmie has a big niche in OU as both the fastest spinner and the only one with access to reliable recovery. This set makes the most of both qualities, allowing Starmie to be a reliable team supporter with enough Speed to check a variety of threats with its good movepool and typing. Rapid Spin and Recover are a given on this Starmie set, allowing it to keep its side of the field free of entry hazards while having decent longevity. Scald is Starmie's main form of offense, and the burn chance allows it to threaten Pokemon that would otherwise use it as setup fodder, such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Gyarados.</p> <p>There are several options that Starmie can use in its fourth moveslot. Psyshock allows Starmie to handle Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Terrakion, and Breloom, as well as OHKO Gengar and prevent it from spinblocking Starmie. Toxic is another solid option, as many of Starmie's common switch-ins, such as Jellicent, Gastrodon, Calm Mind Latias, Ninetales, and bulky Tyranitar, hate being poisoned. Toxic also allows Starmie to outstall Chansey, Blissey, specially defensive Celebi, and opposing Starmie in a one-on-one situation. Finally, Ice Beam is a solid option that allows Starmie to threaten powerful offensive threats it outspeeds such as Thundurus-T, Dragonite, Garchomp, Tornadus, and Nasty Plot Celebi. However, it is important to keep in mind that forgoing Psyshock will prevent Starmie from checking Keldeo.</p> <p>Starmie's HP is maximized, which is necessary for a bulky set, because Starmie has a naturally low base HP stat. 32 Defense EVs are used to avoid the OHKO from Choice Band Terrakion's Stone Edge and Ferrothorn's Power Whip, the latter meaning that Starmie can outstall a burned Ferrothorn in a one-on-one situation. The Speed investment allows Starmie to outspeed all Pokemon up to Tornadus, which includes key targets such as Gengar and Keldeo. Finally, 4 EVs go to Special Attack in order to guarantee the OHKO on uninvested Gengar with Psyshock.</p> <p>As for other move options, Thunder is an option in Starmie's fourth slot on rain teams because it does good damage to Gyarados and opposing Starmie while retaining coverage on Keldeo. It also allows Starmie to deal meaningful damage to Jellicent. However, bulky Starmie is typically outclassed on rain teams, defensively by Tentacruel and offensively by its own offensive sets, as both are more reliable at removing opposing spinblockers and fulfill additional defensive or offensive roles under rain. Reflect Type allows Starmie to comfortably spin on its usual switch-ins, Ferrothorn and Tyranitar, as well as check Pokemon such as Scizor and Amoonguss. However, it has little application beyond those Pokemon and leaves Starmie unable to threaten other important Pokemon such as Keldeo and Gengar.</p> <p>Hard-hitting Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Tyranitar are great partners for Starmie. The former can remove Pokemon that prevent Starmie from doing its job, such as Ferrothorn and Jellicent, while the latter can beat Latios, Latias, and Celebi, which usually see bulky Starmie as setup fodder. In return, Starmie can check Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion. Ferrothorn is another good partner because of its great defensive synergy with Starmie and ability to take powerful hits from the likes of Latios, Latias, Tyranitar, Gyarados, offensive Starmie, and Kyurem-B, while Starmie can beat Fire- and Fighting-types in return. Finally, Poison Heal Breloom can beat Jellicent, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar, all of which give bulky Starmie problems, and it appreciates having Spikes removed from its side of the field to stick around longer, as it does not have any reliable recovery.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Specs equipped, and possibly a boost from rain and Analytic, Starmie is able to 2HKO most of OU with just Hydro Pump, minimizing the need for prediction against all but a few targets. To illustrate Starmie's raw power, with Analytic boosting its first hit, a Choice Specs Hydro Pump in the rain scores a 2HKO even on a specially defensive Rotom-W (after Stealth Rock damage)! Surf still hits very hard while being much more reliable, but the power drop is quite noticeable. Psyshock deals with some of the Pokemon that can avoid the 2HKO from Starmie's Water-type attacks, such as Blissey and specially defensive variants of Jellicent, while also OHKOing many important Pokemon, including Keldeo, Breloom, and Tentacruel (the last after Stealth Rock). On the other hand, Thunderbolt has the advantage of 2HKOing all Jellicent variants with the help of Stealth Rock and OHKOing Gyarados, but has less utility in general than Psyshock. Trick makes Starmie even harder to switch into, crippling any defensive answer to it, including the omnipresent Ferrothorn and Celebi, and is one of the main distinguishing features of Starmie over the other common Water-type Choice Specs wielder, Keldeo. Furthermore, by getting rid of Choice Specs with Trick, Starmie gains the advantage of being able to switch moves and is able to use Rapid Spin without becoming utter setup bait. Rapid Spin works well with Trick, as after Starmie cripples one of its counters with it, it can work as a spinner too, allowing Starmie to effectively fill three main roles for its team: hard hitter, lure, and spinner. However, if Rapid Spin support is not important for Starmie's team, then Ice Beam is the next best option to deal with the Grass- and Dragon-types that check Starmie, such as Celebi and Latias.</p> <p>Very few Pokemon can avoid the 2HKO from Starmie's Hydro Pump in rain, making Politoed a very good teammate. The presence of rain also allows Starmie to use Thunder, which hits just as hard as a STAB Psyshock and has a nifty 30% paralysis chance, which can screw over some of Starmie's common switch-ins, such as Latios, Latias, and Kyurem-B. Analytic is a great option over Natural Cure, especially in rain, where Analytic-boosted Hydro Pump and Thunder become lethal; to give you an example, with the Analytic boost, Thunder always OHKOes physically defensive Jellicent and rain-boosted Hydro Pump deals 51.7% - 60.79% to standard Ferrothorn. These calculations are not surprising, given that Starmie is hitting harder than Choice Specs Keldeo when Analytic is activated. While this set doesn't have any real counters due to the extreme power that rain and Choice Specs-boosted Water-type attacks provide, and Trick's ability to cripple would-be defensive counters, bulky Grass- and Dragon-types are still problematic to Starmie. Terrakion, Weavile, Breloom, and Scizor are all great offensive partners for Starmie, as they can take advantage of Starmie's common switch-ins, such as Celebi, Ferrothorn, and Latias, and even trap most of them in Weavile's and Scizor's case. On the defensive side, Celebi and Ferrothorn can both handle the Electric- and Grass-type attacks that threaten Starmie while also setting up entry hazards to help Starmie get certain OHKOs and 2HKOs, such as the nearly guaranteed 2HKO (98.83% chance) on specially defensive Jellicent with Thunderbolt and the guaranteed 2HKO on Blissey with Psyshock, both after Stealth Rock damage. Finally, any offensive Pokemon with similar counters to Starmie makes for a good partner, as this Starmie is a fine lure due to its unexpectedly strong attacks and Trick, which cripple many of its common check and counters, especially those that lack reliable recovery, such as Ferrothorn and specially defensive Rotom-W. Choice Scarf Keldeo, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Swords Dance Feraligatr are all Pokemon that can sweep easily after Starmie successfully weakens the opposing team.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>While Starmie doesn't have the highest Special Attack around, its great Speed and wide coverage allow it to become a decent revenge killer that can outspeed the whole metagame when holding a Choice Scarf. Hydro Pump is Starmie's main STAB, OHKOing Pokemon such as Terrakion and Landorus-T and also allowing Starmie to sometimes clean up late-game if rain is present. Surf is more reliable but misses the guaranteed OHKO on Terrakion and makes it much harder for Starmie to clean up. Ice Beam takes care of the plethora of boosting sweepers weak to it, such as Salamence, Dragonite, and Garchomp, while also hitting Grass-types super effectively. Thunderbolt deals with Gyarados and Keldeo to an extent, while hitting most other Water-types for solid damage. Trick rounds out the set and makes sure that Starmie isn't easy to switch into, especially by defensive teams.</p> <p>Psyshock can be used over Thunderbolt to take advantage of the fact that Starmie outspeeds Choice Scarf Keldeo, as Psyshock can OHKO it after a bit of residual damage, unlike Thunderbolt, which barely deals over half to Keldeo and struggles to do any real damage to it if it has acquired any Calm Mind boosts. Psyshock also hits Venusaur harder than anything else Starmie can use, usually OHKOing it after Life Orb or Stealth Rock damage. Given that Choice Scarf Starmie outspeeds standard Venusaur under sun, it can be very helpful in a tight situation. Thunder can replace Thunderbolt if Starmie is being used on a rain team, as the extra power and improved paralysis chance are always appreciated. Rapid Spin can also be used over Thunderbolt for teams that can already deal with Water-types and have only one slot to dedicate for both a spinner and a revenge killer.</p> <p>Starmie needs to have Ferrothorn, Celebi, Latias, and sturdy Water-type resists taken care of in order to work effectively. The classic Starmie partners work well, which means that Scizor, Terrakion, and Breloom are all great choices. Politoed is also a very beneficial teammate to power up Starmie's main STAB and give it some sweeping potential after Water-type resists have been weakened or eliminated.</p> "

  "Gyarados": {
    "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced around the time BW was the main generation. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the current BW OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Gyarados is easily one of the most threatening sweepers in the OU tier. While it hasn't changed much from DPP, nothing needed to be changed; Gyarados is still a monster. It has two STABs with great coverage and above-average stats across the board, in addition to two stellar abilities in Intimidate and Moxie. Gyarados is most commonly seen sporting a bulky Dragon Dance sweeper set, allowing it to set up on and tear apart many Pokemon. On the flip side, Gyarados can also run a more defensive RestTalk set aiming to utilize Gyarados's numerous resistances and the immense physical bulk granted by Intimidate. Gyarados can even utilize rain perfectly with its terrifying double-STAB Waterfalls. Unfortunately, the popularity of Electric-type attackers in general makes Gyarados's life difficult. Additionally, Gyarados has rather lackluster initial Speed, meaning it can be forced out easily, a problem that is compounded by its Stealth Rock weakness. Gyarados can also still be outsped and OHKOed by many Choice Scarf users after a Dragon Dance. However, physical Water-type attackers are a rare commodity, in OU at least, making Gyarados a tough competitor in today's metagame.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Gyarados really doesn't have any other options worth considering. Aqua Tail could be used over Waterfall on Dragon Dance sets for a bit of extra power, but its lower accuracy makes it usually not worth it. Fire Blast could potentially see use as a means for Gyarados to bypass opposing Steel-types on sun teams. While Scald might seem tempting for a bulky set, its lack of power and reliance on the burn chance makes it a gimmicky option. Flail wants Gyarados to be at low HP to be of any use, which isn't very ideal. Wacan Berry could be worth a shot, but Gyarados still dies to most Electric-type moves anyway. Bounce and Outrage might be worth a look on Choice sets, but they have detrimental lock-in effects that make them not worth your while.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Countering Gyarados is a unique challenge due to a combination of Waterfall's flinch rate, permanent rain being common, and the looming threat of a Moxie Attack boost. Because of this, unlike most sweepers, it's not a reliable strategy to sacrifice a Pokemon to check Gyarados later. Despite this, Gyarados has quite a few counters. The foremost of these is Ferrothorn, who can take pretty much any attack and break Gyarados's Substitutes with Power Whip. Additionally, it can set up Stealth Rock, which makes Gyarados's life miserable. Skarmory is also difficult to break through and can phaze out Gyarados, negating any boosts it has obtained. Rotom-W is also a good response, especially if it carries Thunderbolt. Gyarados really can't hit Rotom-W hard at all outside of a Choice Band-boosted Double-Edge. Opposing defensive variants of Gyarados also fare well, as they can phaze your Gyarados out. Kyurem-B is another solid counter, boasting the ability to take any hit, even Stone Edge in a pinch (and bypass Bounce with Substitute) and OHKO with Fusion Bolt in return. Finally, Porygon2 can shake off everything Gyarados can throw at it, possibly even Intimidate Gyarados with Trace, and OHKO back with a Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Any Pokemon that can outspeed Gyarados after a Dragon Dance is a pretty good check. These Pokemon include Choice Scarf Terrakion and Choice Scarf Thundurus-T. Jolteon can only outspeed non-Jolly Gyarados variants that are at +1, but it is still usable. While Thundurus-T and Jolteon resist Bounce, none of them can safely switch in out of fear of Waterfall. Pokemon that resist or are immune to Water, such as Gastrodon, Starmie, Cloyster, Celebi, and Toxicroak, are also good checks. None of them, especially Celebi and Toxicroak, particularly enjoy taking a Bounce, however. For this reason, combine them with a Pokemon that resists Flying to take the hit. Perish Song Celebi is particularly effective when paired with such partners. Toxicroak is only useful against the Substitute + Dragon Dance variant, and only if it runs Substitute itself. Also, Gyarados is not a fan of residual damage. Offensive sets are limited in their ability to switch in due to Gyarados's weakness to Stealth Rock, while defensive sets have a harder time walling certain threats after taking Stealth Rock damage. Sandstorm, Toxic, and Leech Seed also take their toll on Gyarados, wearing it down or removing its Leftovers recovery. If all else fails, a surprise Electric-type move, such as Thunder Punch on Jirachi or Hidden Power Electric on Keldeo, will do in a pinch.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Bulky Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>This is Gyarados's bread-and-butter set this generation, being able to set up on a multitude of Pokemon. Dragon Dance is just an amazing move for Gyarados, boosting its Attack to unbelievably high levels and patching up its underwhelming Speed. Gyarados's many useful resistances give it plenty of opportunities to set up, as does Intimidate, which allows it to take various neutral attacks such as Ice Shard, Icicle Crash, and Crunch. On top of this, Substitute enables Gyarados to avoid status, revenge killers, and Volt Switches. In a metagame full of those three things, Substitute makes it much less of a burden to set up. All walls that don't carry phazing moves are going to be in trouble against Gyarados, and as long as its Substitute is up, revenge killers such as Terrakion will be unable to finish it off without falling to Waterfall.</p> <p>The other, less common variant of this set runs Taunt, which is geared specifically toward walls. Taunt renders walls unable to phaze, recover health, use a status move, or Perish Song. It is essential if you wish to beat Skarmory or Hippowdon with Gyarados, as both can take a +1 Waterfall and phaze Gyarados out. Additionally, it allows Gyarados to beat Perish Song Celebi paired with a Steel-type to take a Bounce, one of the most common cores used to handle Gyarados. As for the attacking moves, Gyarados's STABs generally provide enough coverage. Waterfall, especially with a rain boost, can put heavy dents in any Pokemon unlucky enough to be on the receiving end of it. Bounce has nice coverage with Waterfall, most notably hitting bulky Water-types, and ensures Gyarados's Substitute isn't broken while it attacks, only faltering against Thunder in rain while Gyarados is in the air.</p> <p>The EVs allow Gyarados to outrun Jolteon at +1 and prevent Jirachi and burned Ferrothorn from breaking a Substitute with Body Slam and Power Whip, respectively. The HP number achieved increases the healing received from Leftovers, and the remaining EVs are pumped into Attack for more power. Waterfall is obviously irreplaceable on this set, but Bounce isn't. Stone Edge can be used to hit Rotom-W, opposing Gyarados, and Dragonite harder, in addition to being more reliable against Substitute Kyurem-B, but Bounce is generally more useful.</p> <p>The ability choice is one of vital importance. Intimidate allows Gyarados to reduce the power of its foes upon switching in, allowing for easier setup and better match-ups against Pokemon such as Scizor, while Moxie boosts Gyarados's Attack with each kill, making it much more potent offensively. The choice really depends on whether you want a more offensive or defensive Gyarados. Do note, however, that Intimidate ensures Substitutes can't be broken by attacks such as lead Mamoswine's Ice Shard and Choice Scarf Jirachi's Ice Punch.</p> <p>The biggest threats to Gyarados are Perish Song Celebi, Substitute Toxicroak, Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, Kyurem-B, and defensive Politoed. Perish Song Celebi can easily tank even boosted Waterfalls and with a partner who resists it, Bounce is inconsequential, as Celebi can just switch out as Gyarados lands, while Perish Song will eventually force Gyarados out. Toxicroak and Kyurem-B variants with Substitute can set up a Substitute the instant they come in, and replace it whenever Gyarados breaks it with Bounce, while Waterfall is not a problem for either of them. In the meantime, both Pokemon can boost with Bulk Up and Hone Claws respectively and eventually get past Gyarados and probably its remaining team too. Defensive Politoed has Protect to foil Bounce and can tank a few Waterfalls due to its resistance, while using Perish Song to force Gyarados out. Bulky Rotom-W is a fantastic check, as it resists both Water and Flying, and can simultaneously threaten Gyarados and gain momentum with Volt Switch. Finally, Ferrothorn can use Leech Seed the turn that Gyarados hits it with Bounce (as long as Gyarados isn't behind a Substitute) and then slowly stall it out, with Power Whip and Iron Barbs further helping drain Gyarados's life, or just slowly kill it with Power Whip and even shut down Bounce if Ferrothorn has Protect.</p> <p>Specially defensive Celebi makes a good partner, being able to handle Rotom-W and Politoed especially well and deal with other Electric-types too. Celebi can also deal with the Toxicroak variants that trouble Gyarados as long as it carries Psychic, and finally can even force Hone Claws Kyurem-B out with Perish Song if it gets shuffled in. Politoed is almost mandatory, because the rain it brings amplifies the power of Waterfall, which allows Gyarados to 2HKO Skarmory and OHKO 252 HP Jirachi, Choice Scarf Rotom-W, Garchomp, and Magnezone with a boost. SubCM Jirachi and Wish + CM Jirachi both have great synergy with Gyarados, countering Toxicroak and Kyurem-B, using Ferrothorn as set-up bait, having perfect defensive synergy, and being able to heal Gyarados with Wish. Skarmory can be a bit of a pain for Gyarados; Choice Specs Politoed can OHKO it with Surf. Alternatively, Jolteon and Thundurus-T can OHKO it with Electric attacks, and can also switch into Choice-locked Electric attacks aimed at Gyarados, while Gyarados can switch in on Ground-type attacks aimed at Jolteon. Both can also dispatch Perish Song Politoed with ease, and Jolteon can even pass Gyarados a Substitute. Magnezone makes a great partner for dealing with Ferrothorn and Skarmory. Alternatively, burning Ferrothorn will prevent it from breaking Gyarados's Substitutes, so Rotom-W, which can lure it out and burn it, is an effective choice. Finally, Rapid Spin support is appreciated, as having Stealth Rock off the field allows Gyarados to switch in with much greater ease. Starmie is the best choice for a spinner, as it can deal heavy damage to bulky Water-types and Skarmory. Substitute Tentacruel is a very good choice as well, and can deal with Ferrothorn and Politoed, two Pokemon that trouble Gyarados.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>This Gyarados tosses aside easier setup for greatly increased offensive potential. After just one Dragon Dance, Gyarados can outspeed pretty much the entire unboosted OU tier and becomes nigh-impossible to wall. It has no trouble punching massive holes early- to mid-game, softening up the opponent's team to the point where another Pokemon can sweep. Furthermore, when you factor in the sheer power of this set, it needs much less support than other sets. You won't have any issue getting Gyarados in, either, due to the prevalence of Fighting moves in the metagame.</p> <p>Naturally, Waterfall is the main move, ripping apart pretty much every Pokemon in the tier with rain and Dragon Dance boosts. Bounce is of course Gyarados's other STAB move, hitting Grass-types that resist Waterfall—such as Celebi—hard, as well as dealing heavy damage to all common Dragon-types. Without having to mess with a non-attacking move to set up, Gyarados also has room for a coverage move. Stone Edge hits Kyurem-B, Rotom-W, and Dragonite for heavy damage, while Earthquake hits Magnezone, Tentacruel, Toxicroak, Jirachi, and Heatran, which is especially useful in sun.</p> <p>There are important distinctions between the two nature choices on this set; while Jolly allows Gyarados to outrun Jolteon and Choice Scarf Politoed at +1 and Jolly Mamoswine without a boost, Adamant gives a noticeable power buff. Jolly also makes Gyarados much faster unboosted, but the loss in power is significant against foes such as Ferrothorn as well as for hole-punching. For the item, Life Orb is usually best, boosting Gyarados's power even higher, which is what this set is all about. However, Lum Berry helps immensely against status users such as Ferrothorn and Jirachi and lets Gyarados avoid an untimely Scald burn. With Normal Gem, Double-Edge nets some critical KOs on specially defensive Rotom-W, max HP Latias, and Kyurem-B after a Dragon Dance and Stealth Rock damage. However, Double-Edge is illegal with Moxie, so Gyarados must forgo the free Attack boosts. Return boosted by Normal Gem allow Gyarados to make use of Moxie, but it would fail to reliably KO these threats at +1 without some prior damage. Finally, Intimidate can be used over Moxie to aid in setting up, but it really just gets away from the whole point of this set: power. The only reason to use it is because Double-Edge is unfortunately illegal with Moxie.</p> <p>Politoed provides a free boost to Waterfall and can get rid of unfavorable weather conditions, but this set has plenty of power without it. Rapid Spin support from the likes of Starmie and Tentacruel is essential with Life Orb, as Stealth Rock damage piled on with Life Orb recoil means Gyarados dies too quickly. Suicide leads that carry Taunt, such as Terrakion, Skarmory, and Mew, also work to prevent Stealth Rock. Without Substitute, Gyarados also has a lot of trouble against revenge killers. Latios, Terrakion, and Salamence can all outrun Gyarados, even if it has a +1 boost. Scizor can utilize its powerful Bullet Punch to deal with most revenge killers. Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi and Swords Dance Scizor are Pokemon that can take advantage of weak Choice Scarf users and set up. Ferrothorn and Jellicent are difficult for Gyarados to get past, so Magnezone and Nasty Plot Celebi with Hidden Power Fire are good partners.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While Gyarados is no doubt a deadly sweeper, it can also function as an effective revenge killer. With a Choice Scarf attached, Gyarados can outrun many notable threats, just barely outpacing +1 Adamant Dragonite and having enough bulk to tank boosted priority moves, such as Breloom's Mach Punch. Even better, thanks to Moxie, Gyarados can function as a late-game cleaner a la Choice Scarf Salamence. Rain-boosted Waterfall and Moxie are Gyarados's main advantages over other Choice Scarf users. The other moves are for rather specific targets. Ice Fang is the best move Gyarados has to hit Dragon-types, such as Dragonite, Salamence, Latias, and Latios. Stone Edge hits Volcarona and Kyurem-B hard; it is necessary for the former under sun and doesn't carry the risk of activating Flame Body. Finally, Earthquake does solid damage to Tentacruel and Toxicroak.</p> <p>Adamant is almost always the preferred nature; the only time Jolly is useful is on rain teams that have trouble against Jolteon. A move worth consideration is Outrage. Outrage can OHKO Latias and Kyurem-B after Stealth Rock damage, which is a feat Ice Fang simply can't manage. Unfortunately, it has a rather nasty lock-in side effect that pretty much ensures Gyarados will die the next turn.</p> <p>Rain support is non-negotiable with this set, as otherwise Gyarados is completely outclassed by Salamence. Rapid Spin support is another requirement because it ensures Gyarados can switch in and out freely. Starmie is the best choice, as it can hit bulky Water-types for good damage and soften up opponents to set the stage for Gyarados. After taking Hydro Pumps from Starmie, the opponent will often be ill-equipped to handle Gyarados. Other options include Tentacruel, which can Toxic bulky Water-types, and Forretress, which can set up entry hazards and take physical hits well. Unfortunately, the former has a hard time against spinblockers. It is important to note that Gyarados isn't an amazing revenge killer; it's best used to sweep late-game. Therefore, you probably shouldn't use Gyarados as your sole Choice Scarf user. In any case, bulky Water-types, Ferrothorn, Latias, Kyurem-B, and Celebi are perfect stops for this set. Your own Celebi can take care of bulky Water-types, while Scizor can deal with Ferrothorn, Latias, Kyurem-B, and Celebi, as well as use Bullet Punch to help Gyarados with its revenge killing duties.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Although it is an effective attacker, Gyarados can also perform well with a defensive set. With solid bulk, a great typing, and Intimidate, Gyarados has all the tools it needs to be a good bulky Water-type. However, Gyarados is a bit different from your usual bulky Water-type, as it doesn't have reliable recovery. On the bright side, resistances to Fighting, Bug, and Steel, as well as an immunity to Ground make Gyarados a stellar pivot. Consequentially, Gyarados is also a perfect counter to Scizor, Mamoswine, and Volcarona outside of sun. In order to be healthy enough to deal with these threats, Gyarados unfortunately must rely on RestTalk, which is a rather shaky combination, especially with this generation's sleep mechanics. On the other hand, it does make Gyarados much more sturdy. Just be sure to avoid resting while foes such as Jolteon are still alive, as Gyarados hates being forced out while asleep. Waterfall provides Gyarados with a reliable attacking move. The last slot gives Gyarados a phazing move, which helps against setup sweepers and allows Gyarados to spread entry hazard damage. Roar is 100% accurate and can hit through Substitute, while Dragon Tail isn't affected by Taunt and can hit Magic Bounce users.</p> <p>As Gyarados is meant to challenge physical attackers, its EVs make it as physically bulky as possible. While Gyarados should usually run Rest and Sleep Talk, this scenario is different if a good Wish passer and Rapid Spin user are paired with it. If that is the case, RestTalk should be replaced with Taunt and Thunder Wave. The former helps against defensive Pokemon, while the latter can cripple offensive Pokemon. However, in order to run those, you again need to have a Wish passer and Rapid Spin user. For the Wish passer, Jirachi is best used because of its great defensive synergy with Gyarados, particularly helping against Kyurem-B; Terrakion and Scizor also work for that purpose. For the Rapid Spin user, Forretress is best, as it can take the Outrages that Gyarados cannot. A Pokemon that can trap Ghost-types, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar, is useful to ensure Forretress can spin. Additionally, Heal Bell Celebi makes a great partner, as it counters Thundurus-T and other Electric-types that threaten Gyarados. Heal Bell can also wake up Gyarados if it is sleeping, which is helpful. Finally, Ferrothorn can set up entry hazards and take Electric- and Rock-type attacks, making it a good partner.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This set sacrifices the ability to sweep for raw power right off the bat. With a Choice Band and Intimidate, Gyarados makes for an amazing offensive pivot. This is no surprise combined with Gyarados's Fighting and Water resistances and Ground immunity. Most importantly, Gyarados can switch into threats such as Volcarona and Mamoswine. Once it is in, Gyarados can hit the foe with a powerful attack. It plays as a sort of hit-and-run, all-purpose attacker; the best term here is \"hard-hitting tank.\" Gyarados's rain-boosted Waterfalls strike fear in the hearts of its opponents. Boasting a fairly high flinch rate and perfect accuracy, Waterfall is almost always the superior move choice. However, Aqua Tail allows Gyarados to OHKO certain foes, such as defensive Landorus-T and Choice Scarf Jirachi. Double-Edge is mainly used to hit a lured-in Rotom-W, though no bulky Water-type other than Jellicent appreciates being hit by it. Ice Fang is preferred in the third slot to hit Grass-types such as Celebi and Breloom, being the only move on this set that can OHKO the latter; it also hits Dragon-types hard. Stone Edge, on the other hand, does a boatload of damage to Kyurem-B and opposing Gyarados. Finally, Earthquake deals heavy damage to Jirachi, Ninetales, Tentacruel, and Toxicroak.</p> <p>The EVs allow Gyarados to outrun Adamant Breloom while still being powerful enough to dish out heavy damage; the remaining EVs are placed in HP to give Gyarados a little bulk. Avalanche can be used instead of Ice Fang for a harder hit, but negative priority is a major detriment, as Gyarados doesn't want to take any unnecessary damage. Bite can 2HKO Jellicent and Celebi and deal solid damage to Starmie and Latios.</p> <p>Rain support is a necessity for Gyarados, as otherwise it just doesn't hit hard enough to be justified over another Choice Band user, such as Dragonite or Terrakion. Additionally, Gyarados has a rather nasty Stealth Rock weakness, so because it intends to switch in and out a lot, Rapid Spin support is required. Life Orb Starmie is the best choice, as it can beat most bulky Water-types; unfortunately it adds yet another Electric weakness to the team. Breloom, specifically the SubPunch variant, is another choice to beat bulky Water-types. It can set up a Substitute against Jellicent and KO it, which Starmie cannot do; Gastrodon, Tentacruel, and Politoed are also vulnerable to it. Finally, be sure to have Pokemon such as Terrakion or Jirachi to deal with Kyurem-B.</p> "

Ditto's repertoire has expanded, however, and it is now capable of something much more. With Imposter, Ditto can be known as the greatest revenge killer of all time, using its opponents moves against it. With Team Preview being a staple in the BW metagame, opponents will be hesitant to set up once they see Ditto in your party. Although Ditto is an imposing threat to any team, its HP is downright pitiful. Unfortunately for Ditto, HP is the one stat Imposter does not copy, so Ditto will be forever stuck with its 48 base HP. Ditto also has little to no use against opposing stall teams as when Ditto transforms, it will be little more than a Choice Scarf stall Pokemon; not the most useful thing in the world. Ditto is a risk—use its power with caution.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Nope.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ditto has no real counters as Ditto will transform into whatever it switches into. If you want a literal counter to Ditto, then Zoroark is the premier Ditto counter as Imposter fails to copy Zoroark. The best way of handling an opposing Ditto is to not use setup moves such as Dragon Dance, as they will only be used against you. Without boosted stats, Ditto is little more than the typical Choice Scarf Pokemon. Substitute will block Imposter from activating and cause Ditto to be useless.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Imposter allows Ditto to copy its opponent's every aspect (except HP and IVs). From moveset to pixel design all the way to stat boosts, Ditto shares the same exact traits. Ditto does a particularly good job of defeating set-up attackers. With a Choice Scarf attached, Ditto is not only able to copy all stat boosts, but also able to outspeed the Pokemon it is copying. This is particularly useful against Dragon-type Pokemon, as these Pokemon will carry a move that will lead to their downfall. Never again will Salamence and Dragonite try setting up on you, as they know that if they boost, Ditto is ready to do what it does best.</p> <p>HP is the only stat that you need to invest in, but make sure you don't forget to. Imposter does not copy HP values, so whatever you invest is whatever you will get. The IV stat is also something you need to pay close attention to as IVs also do not get copied by Imposter. This means that if you IV your Ditto to have Hidden Power Ice, it will have Hidden Power Ice after you transform. The given IVs ensure that you will have Hidden Power Ice, while also keeping the lowest Speed possible. You may be wondering what the point is in having low Speed IVs, and the reason is for the rare Ditto mirror-match. That is, if two Ditto are sent out at the same time, Imposter won't do anything and both Ditto will face a PP stall battle. The slowest Ditto will win due to not dying from Struggle recoil. Max Special Defense is being used in the rare occurrence that you switch into a Zoroark (Imposter doesn't work on Zoroark), but either way you have no chance of beating Zoroark if you switch into it.</p> <p>In terms of teammates, Ditto appreciates Pokemon that can set up entry hazards. Pokemon such as Skarmory and Forretress are good candidates as both can set up Spikes and are good pivots if Ditto ever needs to switch out. Forretress is particularly useful as it can clear any hazards on your side of the field. Any grounded Poison-type is also a useful partner for Ditto as it is susceptible to Toxic Spikes depending on what it transforms into. In all actuality, you shouldn't be basing your team off Ditto as it is more of a glue Pokemon that aims to KO setup users. Do be warned, however, that there are some setup users that can beat Ditto due to their bulk. Volcarona is an example of this as Quiver Dance boosts its Special Attack and Special Defense. Due to Volcarona's higher HP, it would win the encounter.</p> "

The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>With Wish's new mechanics and Vaporeon's massive HP stat, Vaporeon can really benefit your team by healing off any damage that it may have taken. Vaporeon also got a nifty new toy in Scald, allowing it to burn unsuspecting physical sweepers. Vaporeon can still utilize its Baton Passing capabilities with Acid Armor, Aqua Ring, and its new move Work Up. However, because the new generation both introduced more Pokemon who can hit Vaporeon hard (such as Virizion and Thundurus-T) and allowed older threats (such as Breloom and Rotom-W) to maintain their presence in the tier, Vaporeon will have difficulty walling to its full potential. In addition, Vaporeon is susceptible to all forms of entry hazard damage. Vaporeon is in for a tough time, but with help from teammates and the new tools it has received, it is fully capable of doing its job well.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Surf may be used over Scald on defensive sets for more power in lieu of the 30% burn chance. A Choice Specs set combined with Vaporeon's often overlooked base 110 Special Attack is plausible but is not without its downfalls. If you decide to use Hidden Power Fire, Vaporeon has difficulty with Water-type Pokemon. If you use Hidden Power Electric or Grass, Vaporeon has trouble with Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ferrothorn loves switching in on Vaporeon as it can use Leech Seed to sap Vaporeon's massive HP stat and heal huge amounts of damage it may have taken. From there, it can freely set up entry hazards or attack with Power Whip. Skarmory can come in easily because of Roost, but getting burned by Scald severely hampers his walling capabilities. Shaymin, Breloom, Virizion, Zapdos, and many other Pokemon all can come in on Vaporeon and threaten with a super effective STAB attack. Latios doesn't mind coming in on an Ice Beam because of his massive Special Defense. From there, he can freely launch Draco Meteors.</p> <p>Without Roar, Vaporeon has trouble with boosting Pokemon. Jirachi and Espeon can both utilize Calm Mind and Wish to slowly boost up in front of Vaporeon. Jirachi's Steel typing means it's immune to Toxic, while Espeon has Magic Bounce to bounce it back. Reuniclus has Magic Guard, so it's immune to entry hazards and Toxic and can Calm Mind in Vaporeon's face. Virizion can also Calm Mind and use Giga Drain to heal off any damage it may have taken. Conkeldurr can use Bulk Up and Drain Punch to set up and doesn't mind a burn due to Guts. Both Blissey and Chansey can come in and stop Vaporeon cold, as Vaporeon can't break either of them. They also possess Toxic to reduce Vaporeon's walling capabilities and Natural Cure, Aromatherapy, and Heal Bell to rid themselves of harmful statuses.</p> ",

        "name": "Wish Support",
        "description": "<p>This set utilizes two of the fifth generation's gifts to Vaporeon. With a defensive EV spread, Vaporeon can tank multiple hits from opposing Pokemon. Scald serves as Vaporeon's STAB move and has a handy 30% chance of burning the opposing Pokemon, which is great for crippling physically based Pokemon who think they will be getting a free switch-in. Wish heals an amount equal to 50% of Vaporeon's max HP to a teammate. That, combined with Vaporeon's large base 130 HP stat, means that it will be healing much of your team for at least 50%. Protect serves as a scouting move and ensures that Vaporeon gets healed by its own Wish.</p> <p>There are several options for the last moveslot. Roar is the primary choice because Vaporeon can phaze out counters such as Ferrothorn and cause extra residual damage. Ice Beam is there for Hydreigon, Dragonite, Breloom, and any other Pokemon who resist Scald or take little damage from it. Finally, Toxic, in conjunction with Protect, enables Vaporeon to stall out Pokemon it walls. However, this may clash with the burn chance from Scald.</p> <p>Haze can be used in the last spot to erase an opponent's boosts, but Roar is generally better since it also forces them out. Hidden Power Electric can be used to hit Gyarados but only scratches other Water-type Pokemon due to its low Base Power; Toxic is generally a better answer to enemy Water-types. Vaporeon can use Heal Bell to be the ultimate team supporter by providing status removal in addition to Wish-passing.</p> <p>Ferrothorn can switch in and begin setting up entry hazards without much trouble due to Vaporeon's inability to seriously damage it. Skarmory does a similar job but uses Roost to heal off the damage from Scald. Donphan is a good choice for a partner as it can remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin and is immune to Electric-type attacks. Vaporeon can also switch into Water-type attacks aimed at Donphan. Breloom and Virizion can be dangerous if Vaporeon doesn't catch them on the switch with Ice Beam. Gliscor is a great counter for both of them as it wields an immunity to Spore with Poison Heal, has the Defense to take their attacks, and can hit them back with a STAB Acrobatics.</p> <p>Ferrothorn also serves as a good partner. Vaporeon can easily take the Fire-type attacks aimed at Ferrothorn, while Ferrothorn can handle both the Electric- and Grass-type moves headed Vaporeon's way. Ferrothorn can also lay down entry hazards, which Vaporeon can abuse with Roar. Heatran is also an option to scare away Grass-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn. Vaporeon can also absorb the Water-type attacks aimed at Heatran. Additionally, Vaporeon dislikes Toxic Spikes because of the gradual residual damage it brings. Forretress has good defensive synergy with Vaporeon and can Rapid Spin away entry hazards.</p> "

        "name": "Hydration Wall",
        "description": "<p>While Vaporeon can attempt to use Hydration for its offensive potential, this set aims to use the combination of Hydration and Rest to turn Vaporeon into an unbreakable wall. The purpose of this set is to take incoming attacks, support the team, and deal out decent damage. With this physically defensive spread, Vaporeon's defenses become nearly balanced, allowing it to wall both special and physical threats with extreme proficiency. Additionally, the combination of Vaporeon's fantastic recovery in Rest and its immunity to status makes attempts to wear it down over time futile and allows the Pokemon to function as a surprisingly effective stallbreaker. Just remember that Vaporeon is slower than most threats, so use Rest early and often.</p> <p>Scald is Vaporeon's main STAB attack, which hits very hard for a defensive Pokemon. This is thanks to its impressive base 110 Special Attack and the boost Scald acquires from the rain. The burn chance is an added boon that can greatly increase its walling potential. The choice between Roar and Wish is a tough one and mainly hinges on what your team needs more. If you need a reliable shuffler and phazer, Roar is the way to go. If you need a nearly invincible team healer, Wish is the move you should choose. Toxic is usually the preferred option in the final slot, allowing Vaporeon to beat the likes of Blissey and Porygon2 in a stall war while also making it much easier to wear down other Pokemon. Ice Beam is also an option if extra security against Dragon-types, Breloom, and other assorted threats is necessary.</p> <p>Hydration Vaporeon is a greatly underestimated defensive threat. While all the other walls in the tier can only wall Pokemon that fail to 2HKO them, Vaporeon has the ability to wall any Pokemon who cannot OHKO it since it can recover all its HP in one turn with Rest. As such, the number of Pokemon it can wall is extremely high, as these calculations demonstrate. Even super effective attacks are possible to wall. All the below calculations include Leftovers recovery.</p> <ul> <li>252 SpA Choice Scarf Rotom-W Volt Switch vs 252 HP/0 SpD Vaporeon: 44.61% - 53.02% 3HKO <li>252 SpA Choice Specs Rotom-W Volt Switch vs 252 HP/0 SpD Vaporeon: 66.59% - 78.88% 2HKO</li> <li>252 Atk Conkeldurr Drain Punch vs 252 HP/252+ Def Vaporeon: 30.39% - 35.78% 4HKO</li> <li>252 +1 Atk Conkeldurr Drain Punch vs 252 HP/252+ Def Vaporeon: 45.26% - 53.23% 2-3HKO</li> <li>252 Atk Haxorus Outrage vs 252 HP/252+ Def Vaporeon: 50% - 59.05% 2-3HKO</li> <li>252 Atk Choice Band Haxorus Outrage vs 252 HP/252+ Def Vaporeon: 75% - 88.58% 2HKO</li> <li>8 SpA (Defensive Calm Mind) Virizion Giga Drain vs 252 HP/0 SpD Vaporeon: 33.62% - 40.09% 3-4HKO</li> <li>8 +1 SpA (Defensive Calm Mind) Virizion Giga Drain vs 252 HP/0 SpD Vaporeon: 51.08% - 60.13% 2-3HKO</li> <li>252 SpA Choice Specs Latios Draco Meteor vs 252 HP/0 SpD Vaporeon: 76.94% - 90.73% 2HKO</li> </ul> <p>Vaporeon is gifted with a wide array of useful moves to abuse. While Rest is non-negotiable, all the other moves can be substituted out for other options. Surf is viable over Scald for the minor power boost (which is amplified by the rain). However, it usually lands the same OHKOs and 2HKOs that Scald lands, and that burn chance is hard to give up. The final two moveslots are where you can get really creative. Haze can be used over Roar, especially if you don't have much in the way of hazard support. Acid Armor can be used with a specially defensive EV spread, turning Vaporeon from a bulky Water-type into an immovable object. However, in order to do this, you have to give up either an attacking or a support option to make room for Acid Armor. Baton Pass can pass Acid Armor boosts and ease Wish passing, so it is worth consideration if you're running either move. Rain Dance can be used to effectively mess with opposing weather inducers as they switch in, but it is dead weight against teams without weather. There are many other moves Vaporeon can use effectively in the last two slots, so it can be worth the time to take a look at its movepool and pick whatever moves work best for your team. The 8 EVs in Speed are specifically used to outspeed and Toxic Jellicent before it can Taunt you, so you can move the Speed EVs into Special Defense if you're not running Toxic.</p> <p>It goes without saying that Drizzle Politoed is absolutely vital for using this set effectively, as Rest is more of a liability than a benefit without rain. In order to ensure that Politoed and Vaporeon's roles don't overlap, it is recommended you run a Choice item on Politoed. The other kinds of support that Vaporeon needs largely depend on what moves you choose to use. If Vaporeon has Roar, hazard support is great since this Vaporeon is an extremely effective shuffler. If Toxic is not used, then Toxic Spikes support is nearly vital. Even when it does have Toxic, Toxic Spikes can give Vaporeon the ability to beat threats it normally would not be able to get an attack in against, such as Choice Band Haxorus. Forretress can lay all sorts of entry hazards and covers Vaporeon's Grass-type weakness, so it fills that role well. If you don't have Roar, then something to deal with stat boosters is vital, as Vaporeon becomes setup bait for many of them. In terms of type synergy, Virizion and specially defensive Jirachi make great teammates; they can absorb the powerful Electric- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Vaporeon, while Vaporeon can absorb the Fire-type and physical attacks aimed at them. Virizion is also a great counter to Ferrothorn, who causes Vaporeon a lot of trouble.</p> <p>Ferrothorn, in addition to being a formidable enemy, is a great ally as it can lay entry hazards for Vaporeon to abuse and resists Vaporeon's weaknesses. Tentacruel and Toxicroak completely wall Vaporeon and can use it as setup fodder, so a Psychic-type attacker can make a great partner. Latias and Latios make great partners in this respect because they also have great type synergy with Vaporeon, though they need to watch out for a boosted Sucker Punch from Toxicroak. Rain-abusing Dragonite can also help deal with those two if you give it Thunder and Hurricane, and it can shrug off any Grass-type moves thrown at Vaporeon. Ground-types can also threaten both Toxicroak and Tentacruel with their STAB moves and take those dangerous Electric-type attacks, but be careful not to amplify your Grass-type weakness too much when picking one.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Hydration Tank",
        "description": "<p>Though it is mostly played defensively, an offensive Vaporeon isn't a completely irrational idea due to its often overlooked base 110 Special Attack and usable attacking movepool. This generation, Vaporeon can reach the peak of its offensive prowess thanks to the advent of permanent rain (which boosts the power of Vaporeon's Water-type moves) in OU and its brand new ability: Hydration. In spite of some redundancy with Drizzle Politoed, who shares the same typing, Vaporeon becomes an incredibly powerful and annoying force in the rain with the added ability to recover from low health instantly and ignore status completely through Hydration and Rest. The strategy is simple: Plow through any opponents in the way, using Rest when necessary. To avoid becoming death fodder for the next target, the use of Rest should be well-timed, such as when Vaporeon's health dips below 50% or before KOing the opposing Pokemon.</p> <p>Vaporeon's main weapon is its chosen Water-type move due to the stacked boosts it receives from STAB, Life Orb, and the rain. Hydro Pump would be the preferred choice for raw power, coming close to 2HKOing the likes of Blissey and even Ferrothorn with some entry hazard damage. If Hydro Pump's low accuracy and PP do not appeal to you, Surf is a reliable alternative at the cost of power. The other attacking moves should only be used in certain situations; Ice Beam hits Dragon- and Grass-type foes super effectively, while Hidden Power Grass provides coverage against opposing Water-types, especially Gastrodon and Quagsire. Speaking of which, other Hidden Powers are less useful due to the popularity of said Pokemon (and Gastrodon's ability to wall rain-based teams), so replacing Hidden Power Grass is not recommended.</p> <p>If it wasn't apparent enough already, Vaporeon requires as much power as possible, so maximize its Special Attack with 252 EVs and a Modest nature first. 44 EVs are put in Speed to get the jump on base 70s that don't invest in Speed, and the rest are poured into Defense to improve Vaporeon's tanking capabilities. If maximum Special Attack seems excessive, some EVs can be transferred from Special Attack to either Defense or Speed for more bulk or to outspeed certain Pokemon, respectively. The reason that HP isn't touched is because Vaporeon has high HP as it is, and its average Defense would be a weakness otherwise.</p> <p>As previously stated, Vaporeon needs to be paired up with Drizzle Politoed to maximize its potential. Doing so, however, results in an unfortunate typing overlap and overall redundancy. If you still wish to use Vaporeon, Politoed should cater to a defensive role. At this point, defensive synergy is desperately needed to cover up your team's Electric- and Grass-type weaknesses. You may consider using Dragon- or Grass-type teammates of your own to rectify this issue. For example, Ferrothorn stands out for its ability to provide entry hazards and paralysis support, both of which are beneficial for the power- and speed-starved Vaporeon. For Dragon-types, Dragonite and Latios are good choices, capable of sponging strikes aimed at Vaporeon and replying with their respective wallbreaking attacks. Additionally, as Vaporeon can lure and take out counters to rain (Blissey, Gastrodon, and weather inducers, to name a few), Pokemon that can take advantage of their absence are also highly recommended.</p> <p>Vaporeon itself has a few problems bypassing some dedicated walls, especially Ferrothorn (if Vaporeon can't manage to 2HKO) and opposing bulky Water-types. Offensive support is necessary to defeat what Vaporeon can't. Therefore, employing teammates with Fighting- or Electric-type attacks can fend off these threats. On a Drizzle team, Toxicroak, Breloom, and Thunder users should naturally suffice. Additionally, Toxic Spikes support, preferably from Tentacruel or Roserade, allows Vaporeon to gain more KOs and bring down defensive Pokemon simply by using Rest and attacking constantly.</p> "

  "Jolteon": {
    "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced around the time BW was the main generation. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the current BW OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Arguably the most effective of Eevee's myriad evolutionary paths, Jolteon possesses a blistering Speed stat of 130, giving it a distinct advantage in the OU metagame by allowing it to run circles around every unboosted Pokemon. Jolteon's 110 base Special Attack and access to STAB Thunder make it a powerhouse in the rain, Thunderbolt has plenty of power and classic reliability, and Volt Switch makes it easy to keep up the momentum that Jolteon's speed creates by coming into key threats, such as Keldeo, Thundurus-T, and Starmie. On top of all that, Jolteon's ability, Volt Absorb, allows it to absorb Thunders and Volt Switches from the opposing team.</p> <p>That said, Jolteon isn't without its flaws. While Jolteon's Thunderbolt and Thunder gives it plenty of offensive presence, its coverage moves are weak and few in number, making it tough for Jolteon to take on the increasingly common Electric resistances that Thunder's power is forcing into the forefront. Furthermore, Jolteon has defenses resembling a wet paper bag, and while it can absorb a Thunder or Volt Switch, one wrong prediction could lead to a whole lot of pain and a useless Jolteon. Jolteon also struggles against common threats, such as Ferrothorn and Hippowdon, which stop it from spamming its powerful STABs. Additionally, Jolteon sees heavy competition in the form of Thundurus-T, which can offset its poor speed with Choice Scarf and Agility, while packing unparalleled power. Finally, Choice Scarf makes it easy to find a Pokemon capable of outspeeding Jolteon, making sweeps unlikely. Still, Jolteon has a combination of speed and power that lets it take on some of OU's more prominent threats, and while it's not a Pokemon for every team, it brings plenty to the table.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Jolteon's movepool is pretty bad, so it does not have many other options. Hidden Power Grass hits Mamoswine, Quagsire, and Gastrodon, but of the three, only the first is common, and it also has Ice Shard, so hitting it on the switch is the only real viable option. Charge Beam and Work Up can be used to try a boosting sweeper role, but there are other Pokemon that do this better, such as Latias and Thundurus-T. Jolteon's Dream World ability, Quick Feet, is not bad, but having an Electric immunity is far more useful than an unreliable and unnecessary boost to Jolteon's Speed. Some other moves, such as Toxic, Thunder Wave, Wish, and Protect, can be used, but Jolteon can't afford to lose a coverage move to run them.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Blissey and Chansey are Jolteon's best counters, easily switching into anything it throws at them while recovering HP with Soft-Boiled and Wish. Ferrothorn is also a great counter, as Jolteon can't do much to it while it sets up hazards. Mamoswine and Gastrodon don't fear Jolteon at all and can easily dispose of it with Earthquake, although they will have trouble if Jolteon is running Hidden Power Grass. Specially defensive Hippowdon takes little damage from anything Jolteon can throw at it and can KO back with Earthquake. If Jolteon is locked into an Electric-type move, common Ground-types, such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T, can easily set up on it. Kyurem and Kyurem-B can also switch in on anything Jolteon throws at them and easily KO it back with the proper move. Since Jolteon is frail, it is easily felled by powerful priority moves, such as Breloom's Mach Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. Choice Scarf users that outspeed Jolteon, such as Hydreigon and Salamence, can surprise the Lightning Pokemon and KO it with ease. In general, anything that can take a hit from Jolteon and hit it back with a STAB move will usually defeat it.</p> ",

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Between its great type coverage, solid Special Attack, and blazing fast Speed, Jolteon has carved itself out a decent niche in the OU metagame. 130 base Speed, which allows it to outspeed common +1 threats such as Dragonite, makes Jolteon an excellent revenge killer without having to saddle itself with a Choice Scarf. While its lack of bulk makes it hard for Jolteon to get in, once it's there it can have a real impact.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is Jolteon's main STAB move, hitting everything that doesn't resist it for great damage and easily sweeping late-game. If rain support is present, Jolteon gains access to the powerful Thunder, cranking up its damage output and giving a threat of Paralysis to anything that switches in. Volt Switch lets Jolteon seize momentum and scout out the opposing team. Signal Beam is Jolteon's best coverage move, hitting Celebi, Abomasnow, and Tyranitar, as well as Psychic-types such as Reuniclus. Hidden Power Ice completes Jolteon's pseudo-BoltBeam coverage, hitting Hippowdon and Landorus-T, as well as Dragon-types, such as Garchomp and Dragonite.</p> <p>The EVs are simple, maximizing Speed and Special Attack. The item choice, however, is tough. Jolteon can use Choice Specs for the amazing power it provides, but it can also go for Life Orb to leverage its coverage. Expert Belt is also a decent choice- it can fake Choice Specs, and abuse Jolteon's excellent coverage. However, it comes at the cost of neutral Thunderbolt's power, which is something that Jolteon really depends on. Shadow Ball can be used over Signal Beam for more power against Ghost-types like Gengar. However, Signal Beam is obligatory alongside Thunder, as without it, Jolteon has a huge gaping weakness against Tyranitar. Finally, Baton Pass can be used on Life Orb sets to escape Tyranitar's Pursuit and scout against Ground-types or Volt Absorbers, but the damage from Volt Switch makes it a much more appealing option.</p> <p>Jolteon is best paired with Pokemon that attract Electric-type attacks, especially Water-type Pokemon. Gyarados and Politoed are great teammates, as the former is immune to Ground, while the latter also provides eternal rain, allowing Jolteon to run Thunder instead of Thunderbolt. Breloom also works well, resisting Ground and being able to take out Chansey and Ferrothorn. U-turn users such as Landorus-T and Scizor are also great partners because they form a VoltTurn core with Jolteon. Landorus-T is also immune to Jolteon's only weakness, and has Intimidate to lessen the blow from incoming physical attacks.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Baton Pass",
        "description": "<p>As a blazing fast revenge killer, lots of Pokemon are quick to get out of Jolteon's way. Substitute abuses this to the extreme, easing prediction and allowing Jolteon to pass its Substitutes to other members of the team. For instance, if the opposing Pokemon does switch out, Jolteon has basically earned free protection against the switch-in, giving it an opportunity to attack that foe or pass its Substitute to another teammate. If the foe does stay in, Jolteon can simply strike it down with the correct move. As this set takes two moveslots for Substitute and Baton Pass, Jolteon will have to resort to the classic pseudo BoltBeam combo, providing excellent coverage in Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p>This set's largest advantage over other sets is its access to reliable scouting, easily taking momentum from any situation without risking Volt Switch being blocked by a Ground-type. More often than not, Jolteon can also find opportunities to pass Substitutes to one of its teammates, surely earning your team the upper hand. Beware, however, that once Jolteon's strategy has been revealed, the opponent will likely attempt to break Jolteon's Substitutes to decrease its health. Do not be overzealous with Substitute if you cannot afford to.</p> <p>This set can provide utility for a lot of teams, as Jolteon's excellent Speed, when maximized, allows it to outrun +1 Adamant Dragonite and Gyarados, filling a revenge killing role when needed. Passing Substitutes is a great support tactic for any attacker, giving the receiver protection and chances to set up. Thunder is an obvious option for Drizzle teams, while Charge Beam can also be used for STAB to possibly pass special attack boosts. This, however, usually isn't necessary and makes Jolteon an initially less effective revenge killer.</p> <p>The preferred item is Leftovers, which prevents residual damage from piling up with entry hazards and weather damage. Life Orb is the other choice, equipped in order to maximize Jolteon's power for its own sweep. Keep in mind that this, in turn, cuts down on the amount of Substitutes Jolteon can make, so Jolteon's item choice should come from testing with your own team. Magnet is another alternative that can provide extra STAB power for Jolteon, and it also both avoids the residual damage Life Orb would cause and disguises Jolteon as a Choiced sweeper. On the same note, Expert Belt can also be considered for providing power without recoil, though keep in mind that with only Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice in tow, Jolteon won't be hitting much super effectively.</p> <p>Scizor is an ideal example of a teammate that appreciates being passed a Substitute; it can use it to switch in safely and set up on a vast amount of Pokemon that can wall this Jolteon, including Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and Blissey. Another possible teammate would be Gyarados, which can complete the classic \"GyaraJolt\" combo, and discourages the opponent's attempts to catch Jolteon with a Ground-type attack. Generally, strong physical attackers have the best direct synergy with this Jolteon. It's best if you bring this set out as early as possible, as it's less effective the longer the game drags on, and there might not be as many opportunities to set up.</p> "

  "Dragonite": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW OU metagame in general. A <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/dragonite-wip.3677738/\">revamp</a> is currently being worked on for this analysis.</p> <hr /> <p>In BW, Dragonite rose from the shadows of its competitors due to being gifted with the rare Multiscale. With Multiscale, Dragonite has gone from an outclassed niche Pokemon to one of the most dominant offensive and defensive threats in the metagame. It can fill almost any role and is one of the few Pokemon that can claim to work on any team due to its endless movepool and well-distributed stats. However, residual damage, particularly a nasty Stealth Rock weakness, limits Multiscale's effectiveness. A slightly below-average Speed holds it back as well, though Multiscale helps mitigate this flaw somewhat. Speedy threats such as Choice Scarf Salamence and Thundurus-T don't do it any favors either. Regardless of these downfalls, Dragonite defines the OU metagame with its great bulk and power, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragonite's movepool contains a plethora of other options. Although the lack of an Attack boost makes it an inferior alternative to Dragon Dance, Agility can turn Dragonite into an untouchable monster, with only Choice Scarf Pokemon with base Speed above 108 being faster after the Speed boost. Heal Bell can be used on a bulky set to allow Dragonite to function as a cleric or even to help set up Dragon Dance; however, Substitute is better for that and Dragonite's moveslots are cramped as it is, not to mention that it is incompatible with Multiscale thanks to being a move solely found on Dragonite in Pokemon XD. Haze can have some potential use to check setup sweepers, but Dragon Tail is superior due to it shuffling around the opponent and spreading entry hazard damage, though Haze might see the light of day on teams that struggle with last Pokemon setup sweepers. Tailwind can be used in a similar vein to Agility and to support the team, but once again Dragon Dance is superior for boosting the power of Dragonite's attacks. The gimmicky Icy Wind can be used to lower the opposing Pokemon's Speed and follow it up with a powerful attack, but an attacking move followed by Extreme Speed is a more effective strategy.</p> <p>Although Superpower is superior in most cases, Brick Break can be used with more consistency and breaks through dual screens, but unfortunately it is not very powerful. Stone Edge is a very niche option solely viable to OHKO Volcarona without any chance of being burnt by Flame Body. Dragon Rush might seem to be a decent option over Dragon Claw for more power, but the much lower accuracy makes the increased power not worth it for most teams.</p> <p>A mixed set composed of Draco Meteor, Fire Blast, Superpower, and Extreme Speed can be used to decent effect, but other sets are generally more effective and the set itself is inferior to Hydreigon and Salamence. It does have a few things that it boasts that separate it from the two, including that it lures in physical walls thanks to its most common set being Dragon Dance, Extreme Speed for priority, and lack of reliance on Outrage to hit special walls hard. Other than that, its inferior Special Attack and Speed make it a worse choice. Multiscale can't even save Dragonite here, with at maximum there being only one turn of it and most of the time it being already broken.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to Dragonite's extreme diversity it has no hard counters, but many checks exist. Faster Choice Scarf users, such as Keldeo, Terrakion, Kyurem, Salamence, Latios, Haxorus, and Thundurus-T, can outspeed and OHKO Dragonite once Multiscale is broken even if it has set up, with a few even being able to OHKO Dragonite through Multiscale. Landorus-T and Gyarados make decent switch-ins due to Intimidate and can take a neutral Outrage, and with a Steel-type teammate such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Heatran, or Forretress to sponge Outrages creates a core that Dragonite cannot hope to break. Steel-types and walls with high physical bulk that can switch in on Outrage, such as Jirachi, Heatran, Skarmory, Hippowdon, Ferrothorn, and Gliscor, beat most physical Dragonite sets, though even they must be wary of the proper coverage move that might be used specifically to beat some of these threats.</p> <p>Slowbro and Tangrowth make excellent switch-ins thanks to Regenerator allowing them to make up for any mistakes, and outside of mixed and special sets Dragonite cannot OHKO either of them. Both are able to take a super effective coverage move and then switch out to something that resists it, while coming out of the scenario pretty much unscathed. The very rare Porygon2 makes a perfect counter, copying Multiscale with Trace and being able to take any hit not named Superpower. Quagsire is another rare Pokemon that can beat Dragonite, though the only set it beats is Dragon Dance all thanks to Unaware. Defensive Cloyster is another of these rare Pokemon that can beat Dragon Dance sets, having massive physical bulk as well as Icicle Spear which has four times its usual effectiveness and ignores Multiscale due to being a multi-hit move. Choice Scarf Ditto is another option but only actually beats and revenge kills the offensive Dragon Dance set. Stealth Rock is usually one's best line of defense against any Dragonite, negating Multiscale, and combining it with a sturdy spinblocker such as Jellicent will make Dragonite's life quite difficult. Attempting to figure out Dragonite's set early on is key, as its versatility makes it very difficult to deal with later in the game if its set is not yet known. Overall, the best ways to deal with Dragonite are revenge killing, priority, prediction, and something that can absorb a few hits, and most all teams worth their stuff have, at the very least, one of these methods in place.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>This set is more oriented towards the hit-and-run strategy. It is similar to Scizor in this aspect, except that Extreme Speed has better general coverage and around the same amount of power as Bullet Punch. With a Choice Band, Dragonite becomes a monster, capable of blasting apart walls and tearing large holes in both offensive and defensive cores. Outrage is the primary offensive tool of this set, capable of steamrolling through everything that is not a bulky Steel-type and puncturing through the highest of defenses. Extreme Speed is a huge boon to Choice Band Dragonite, allowing it to act similar to Scizor in that it can pick off almost any weakened Pokemon that does not resist it. Fire Punch has excellent coverage with Outrage, hitting the Steel-types that resist it hard, but Waterfall is the superior choice in rain due to being boosted by the weather. Earthquake rounds out Dragonite's coverage by smacking Heatran and Jirachi in rain, though Superpower is actually a very competitive alternative. It does heavy damage to Tyranitar, Blissey, and Chansey, and has arguably better coverage too, hitting most Pokemon that Earthquake hits and more. However, Jirachi in rain and Metagross will then wall Dragonite, but outside of rain Fire Punch deals a decent amount of damage and the right support can make them a non-issue.</p> <p>The EVs and nature are very simple, providing maximum offensive power with an Adamant nature, and securing many vital KOs. A Jolly nature can be run to outspeed Timid Heatran but has little use outside of that. Aqua Tail is an option over Waterfall, but Waterfall has perfect accuracy and the extra power isn't all that needed. Dragon Claw is the last move that might be considered, as locking Dragonite into Outrage with opposing Steel-types still alive is risky, and Earthquake or Superpower might not be needed due to offensive Heatran being 2HKOed by Outrage. It is much easier to toss around Dragon Claws than it is to toss around Outrages, with there being little risk attached to Dragon Claw and high risk attached to Outrage. However, Dragon Claw lacks the massive power that Outrage has and just cannot achieve the same KOs, so most of the time it will just be on the set and be a wasted moveslot that could be better spent on a coverage move.</p> <p>For this set to function, removing Stealth Rock is vital, as it needs to be played as a hit-and-run Pokemon that will be switching in and out a lot. Forretress can provide Rapid Spinning utility as well as set up entry hazards that Dragonite enjoys to weaken its checks. Starmie is another option that can deal with spinblockers and threaten many of Dragonite's checks. Paralysis support is quite helpful due to Dragonite's below-average Speed. The most notable example is Jirachi, which has a multitude of other uses such as Stealth Rock, Wish to help with switching into attacks, and excellent defensive synergy. Chansey is great as well and can provide cleric support to remove detrimental status such as paralysis or burn. Celebi is another great choice and can also provide cleric support but lacks the defensive synergy to be the best partner that it can be. Pokemon that can utilize the holes that Dragonite punches, such as Scizor and Terrakion, enjoy Dragonite's help to aid in their respective methods of sweeping.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>While in previous generations Dragonite was often overlooked in favor of the much faster Salamence, Multiscale gives it a major boost that puts it on the forefront of Dragon Dance sweeping. With Multiscale, provided that Stealth Rock is off the field, Dragonite is the only Dragon-type that can claim to have a guaranteed turn of setup, which rivals Salamence and Haxorus only wish they could have. It can even set up on and KO Starmie and Latias, both of which would otherwise have their way with slower Dragon-types. Once set up, very few Pokemon in OU can take on the menace that is boosted Dragonite, allowing it to rip apart teams if left unchecked.</p> <p>There are two choices for Dragonite's STAB move: Outrage and Dragon Claw. Outrage is much more powerful, so powerful that it 2HKOes offensive Heatran with a +1 boost, meaning that with it and Fire Punch Dragonite can hit every Pokemon in OU for a large amount of damage. Dragon Claw is another option, having much less power but giving Dragonite the option to switch moves. Dragon Claw pairs well with Extreme Speed, as the combination of the two allows Dragonite to continue its sweep against faster revenge killers, such as Keldeo, Thundurus-T, Latios, and Haxorus. Earthquake is another option that allows Dragonite to beat Pokemon that rain teams in particular often have trouble with such as Tentacruel, Jirachi, and Heatran. Lastly, Roost can be run in order to optimize Dragonite's access to Multiscale to obtain more boosts and increase overall longevity.</p> <p>The given EV spread is ideal for Dragonite to have the maximum Speed and power. A Jolly nature will reduce its power significantly, but it allows Dragonite to outspeed Timid Choice Scarf Politoed and Timid Jolteon at +1, as well as Choice Scarf Terrakion and Choice Scarf Latios at +2. A bulkier spread of 252 HP / 44 Atk / 212 Spe is also usable in order to try and stack many boosts and then sweep. In this case, Roost is vital in order to increase longevity, as is Dragon Claw so that Dragonite is not disadvantaged by being locked into a move when it is not quite so powerful. However, this sort of Dragon Dance set has a lot of issues that it did not have in the past, as fast revenge killers such as Terrakion, Keldeo, Thundurus-T, as well as super effective priority from Mamoswine make it much harder for a set that needs time to operate to actually obtain the time that it needs to setup. In addition, the power loss is very noticeable and Dragonite becomes much easier to wall.</p> <p>Lum Berry is the preferred item to ward off burns from Scald and paralysis from the likes of Ferrothorn that Dragonite might want to set up on. Leftovers is another option to lessen the effects of residual damage, and is particularly useful under sand and hail to prevent them from getting in the way of Multiscale. The last item that might be considered is Life Orb, as although it does negate Multiscale, the OHKOs on Vaporeon and Jellicent as well as the 2HKO on Skarmory with +1 Fire Punch might be well worth it. As far as moves are concerned, there are a few other decent choices. First off, Waterfall is superior to Fire Punch on rain teams, but then Stealth Rock support and Life Orb become necessary for Dragonite to break Steel-types, and Ferrothorn will then always beat Dragonite sans those running Superpower, which has drawbacks that make it undesirable in most cases. Fire Blast can be used to break through Skarmory and Ice Punch can be used to hit Landorus-T, Gliscor, and opposing Dragonite harder, but usually Dragonite is better off simply running Earthquake and Fire Punch.</p> <p>As far as support is concerned, Rapid Spin is a must in order to maintain Multiscale, with Forretress, Starmie, and Donphan being your best choices. Stealth Rock is important as well, securing many KOs and wearing down Dragonite's counters, with Landorus-T and Ferrothorn being excellent choices for the job. Weather support is appreciated to boost the power of Fire Punch or Waterfall and to remove sand, which is detrimental to Multiscale, with sun being optimal for the former and rain for the latter. Rotom-W makes a good partner, as it can switch into Dragonite's best defensive checks, such as Skarmory, Gliscor, and Landorus-T, force them out with the threat of Hydro Pump, and then use Volt Switch to get back out to Dragonite who can deal with common switch-ins to Rotom-W. Magnezone is a decent partner as well, making it much easier to get Skarmory out of the way due to the very specific conditions that Dragonite needs to beat Skarmory, as well as beating Ferrothorn if Waterfall is chosen over Fire Punch and having excellent type synergy with Dragonite.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Substitute + Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>The main goal of this set is to deal with the three main things that standard Dragon Dance Dragonite is stopped by: status, revenge killers, and residual damage from sand. While usually Dragonite will have to choose which issue to overcome, with this set it can have it all, with beating revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Haxorus lacking Dual Chop, Choice Scarf Keldeo, Choice Scarf Terrakion, and Choice Scarf Thundurus-T being icing on the cake. Without having to worry about status and being protected from faster revenge killers and priority, Dragonite can easily boost all the way up to +6 provided it gets in against a slower wall or Pokemon that cannot hit it for much damage. Most teams lack a way to prevent this from happening other than denying Dragonite momentum, which can be easily gained with a simple slow Volt Switch or U-turn. Once Steel-types are removed, this set is a nightmare for stall, as other than Roar and Whirlwind, such teams usually lack ways of stopping this set from setting up to +6 and unleashing its untold fury upon their mightiest and bulkiest walls. The SubRoost strategy finds its home on this Dragonite set, allowing Dragonite to maintain Multiscale and have an even easier time setting up. Dragon Claw is the sole attack, boasting a large amount of power after a few boosts. While Dragonite might have a bit of trouble finding time to actually switch in and set up Substitute, the moment it does spells doom for all of its opposition.</p> <p>The given EV spread is the best possible option, with maximum investment in HP for the best overall bulk with enough Defense EVs for Dragonite's Substitutes to survive Iron Heads from specially defensive Jirachi as well as enough Special Defense EVs to take Thunders from the same Jirachi. The given Speed EVs combined with a Jolly nature serve to outspeed Alakazam at +1. 80 Special Defense EVs can be invested to stall out Ice Beams from Choice Specs Politoed. Otherwise, there aren't any other great choices for EVs that do not cause Dragonite to forfeit key investments in other areas.</p> <p>Although this set is more self-sufficient than other sets, it still needs the correct support to bypass counters and function with more ease. As far as counters are concerned, Skarmory is a huge issue due to its high Defense, resistance to Dragon Claw, and access to Whirlwind to phaze Dragonite out. Other Steel-types and physical walls can be bypassed with the correct setup sequence, though there are some Pokemon that can overcome Dragonite through other means, such as Perish Song users, Ice Punch Metagross, or Unaware Quagsire. Hippowdon and Heatran with Roar can take a boosted hit easily and phaze it out, while Shell Smash Cloyster ignores Substitute and Multiscale with Icicle Spear. Generally speaking, before sending Dragonite out to sweep, ensure that the aforementioned defensive threats are eliminated. Magnezone is notable for its ability to trap and eliminate Steel-types, though Skarmory with Shed Shell might prove problematic. Rather than going with the conventional trap-and-kill route, one can simply employ Pokemon that can lure in or punch through these counters; prime examples include Choice Band Terrakion and Magic Bounce Espeon with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is not as necessary because of Substitute and Roost, but it is still appreciated to ensure Multiscale is activated from the start. Starmie is notable above all others due to its ability to use Rapid Spin, absorb status with Natural Cure, and break down physical walls that Dragonite might encounter. Dragonite in turn can set up on threats that wall Starmie, including, but not limited to, Gastrodon lacking Ice Beam, Jellicent, Blissey, and Rotom-W. Forretress and Tentacruel are also good choices because of their stellar defenses, great typing, and access to entry hazards. Speaking of which, residual damage is instrumental to Dragonite's success; it will often find itself in situations where it will have to stall out certain foes before doing anything else, which applies mainly to walls such as Quagsire and Hippowdon. These foes are easily stalled out with Toxic Spikes support, which Forretress and Tentacruel can easily provide.</p> "

        "name": "Rain Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>All it takes is one look at Dragonite's offenses and movepool to see that it can make an excellent mixed attacker in rain. It boasts coveted access to both Hurricane and Thunder with STAB to boost the former. There are other reasons that it works well in rain, such as covering the Grass-type weaknesses that many members of most rain teams tend to have without being weak to Electric-type attacks, which is a solid advantage over such Pokemon as Tornadus. It does not take much to get Dragonite in, and once it gets in it blasts holes, boasting downright amazing coverage and tearing apart common threats to rain teams.</p> <p>Due to this set being built for rain, Hurricane overtakes Dragonite's Dragon-type STAB as the main spam move of choice, boasting 100% accuracy in rain as well as a high Base Power and excellent neutral coverage. The next slot is all preference; Aqua Tail gains a sort of pseudo-STAB in rain and does solid damage to most Pokemon that resist Hurricane, with notable hits being the OHKO on 252 / 0 Heatran 81% of the time, the OHKO on 0 / 0 Thundurus-T after Stealth Rock, the 2HKO on 252 / 0 Jirachi 65% of the time after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, the 2HKO on Blissey after Stealth Rock, and the 2HKO on Tyranitar outside of rain. While Superpower might seem like a much more inferior option when put up against how well Aqua Tail does against a variety of threats, Superpower OHKOes Tyranitar, OHKOes Blissey after Stealth Rock, and 2HKOes Chansey, all of which are very relevant and notable checks to rain, and although lowering stats is a drawback, the draw is still there for smacking those three Pokemon hard. However, it does then leave Dragonite open to Jirachi if it forfeits Earthquake, and Earthquake and Superpower have redundant coverage when used together.</p> <p>Thunder is in the third slot due to the fact that it has perfect accuracy in rain and deals super effective damage to Pokemon that rain teams struggle with, such as Tentacruel, as well as allowing Dragonite to lure in and KO Skarmory expecting a physical Dragonite. The solid 30% paralysis chance can be helpful in a clutch, giving the Latias, Latios, and other fast Pokemon that can take a Thunder second thoughts on switching in. The last slot is all a tossup, as it won't be used very much at all. Extreme Speed allows Dragonite to pick off faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users and can be combined with another move that could potentially surprise the opponent. Earthquake hits a few things that Aqua Tail and Superpower fail to hit and gives Dragonite a great tool against sun teams that are otherwise challenging for rain teams to beat. Roost can be useful to keep Dragonite alive longer and possibly repair Multiscale, but its use is limited, and the use of Life Orb breaks Multiscale anyway. Every move that can be put in the last slot does have some potential use, but in actuality it isn't all that much and the best move to pick is the one that will handle something that your team struggles with.</p> <p>Where EVs are concerned, there are enough Speed EVs to outspeed Timid Magnezone and maximum EVs in Special Attack to pump up Dragonite's spammable STAB as well as Thunder, with the remaining EVs placed in Attack to make Dragonite's physical moves a bit more powerful. As far as other moves are concerned, Outrage is an option in the final slot for a more powerful physical attack, boasting STAB, that hits special walls such as Chansey, Gastrodon, and Blissey, but the lock-in is detrimental and usually ends up with a dead Dragonite and a wasted moveslot, having quite redundant coverage.</p> <p>Due to this set packing Hurricane, Thunder, and possibly Aqua Tail, it is easy to see that Politoed is necessary for the rain support it provides. Another type of support that helps is the much aforementioned Rapid Spin, especially due to this set's vulnerability to residual damage as well as its general hit-and-run playstyle. Starmie is a top-notch teammate for this Dragonite set, being excellent at taking advantage of rain in itself and having the potential to beat checks to Dragonite such as Latios, Mamoswine, Scizor, and Thundurus-T. It also pairs well with Pokemon that need certain Pokemon removed in order to sweep such as Toxicroak, Latios, and Scizor, all of which struggle with certain Pokemon that this Dragonite can remove. Thanks to its low Speed, Dragonite will often be forced out, so any sort of Pokemon that has good type synergy with Dragonite, such as Forretress, Ferrothorn, and Jirachi, makes an excellent teammate as a pivot to take attacks aimed at Dragonite. Paralysis support is optional but is greatly helpful, with Jirachi, Chansey, and Celebi being great choices for the job, the latter two boasting a nice defensive synergy with Dragonite. Notice that a lot of Dragonite's support is optional, as it is one of the best standalone Pokemon for punching holes in teams in existence.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While many Dragonite sets aim to break holes, this set aims to deal with many common threats to rain teams thanks to its numerous resistances and the all-important Multiscale. Thanks to being made for rain, it has the ability to hit back hard as well, which is a key advantage over the Multiscale shuffler set. Out of every single set contained in this analysis, this set is the best at taking advantage of Multiscale, taking advantage of Roost to stall out even super effective attacks from some of the most monstrous attackers in existence. Dragon Tail is able to be used at key times if Multiscale is intact, as well as STAB Hurricane and perfectly-accurate-in-rain Thunder to hit back hard.</p> <p>Hurricane hits quite hard thanks to STAB, even without investment, with the 30% confusion chance being ever-present and always a headache for opposing Pokemon. Thunder has decent coverage with Hurricane and has a very nice 30% chance of paralysis, allowing Dragonite to cripple many sweepers completely and even create an unreliable but still deadly parafusion combination with Hurricane. Rain stall teams often struggle with bulky Water-types, such as Jellicent, Vaporeon, and Tentacruel, and Thunder allows Dragonite to beat them. Dragon Tail prevents Dragonite from being set up on and can be pulled off to save a battle from the fires of defeat, being able to be used as a revenge killer for setup sweepers not behind a Substitute. It would be remiss not to mention Roost, which is supremely important for keeping Dragonite in a decent range of health and abusing Multiscale. Bringing Dragonite without it would be a tragic mistake.</p> <p>The given EVs provide Dragonite with the maximum possible special bulk in order to maximize the number of threats that it can wall. Investment in Special Attack might be desired to better handle Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi, but the loss in special bulk is usually not worth it and makes it harder for Dragonite to act as the excellent pivot that it is. Earthquake can be used in order to hit some troublesome Pokemon to rain teams such as Jirachi, Heatran, and Tyranitar, the former being a nightmare to most rain stall teams. Substitute is an option to be used over Thunder to turn this set into a rain-based version of the Multiscale shuffler set in order to protect Dragonite from status, but the coverage and paralysis chance that Thunder offers will be sorely missed.</p> <p>Due to the fact that this set is made for rain stall and has two attacks that rely on rain to be reliable, Politoed is a mandatory partner. Entry hazard support from the likes of Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory are also beneficial to this set due to the fact that Dragon Tail shuffles around the opposing team. The latter also checks Dragon- and Ice-types and counters and KOes Swords Dance Virizion with Brave Bird, all of which are troublesome for Dragonite. A spinblocker, such as Gengar, Jellicent, or Sableye, can be helpful in order to make sure these vital hazards are not spun away. Cleric support from the likes of Chansey and Celebi is useful because Dragonite is quite vulnerable to status and Toxic is pretty much instant death for this since it will usually be staying in for long periods of time. Wish support from Blissey, Chansey, or Jirachi can aid greatly in keeping Multiscale intact and all of them have great type synergy with Dragonite. The three also check Water-types with an Ice-type attack for coverage that are a major headache for Dragonite. Amoonguss is a great partner because it checks Water-types and Thundurus-T which Dragonite struggles with. Lastly, a check to Terrakion, such as Starmie, Scizor, or Breloom, is useful due to the fact that Terrakion's Stone Edge does heavy damage to Dragonite.</p> <p>While it has been discussed that Dragonite is excellent on rain stall, it has not been discussed why this is true. First off, it can take on many threats to rain stall such as bulky Water-types and Calm Mind sweepers, the most notable two being Jirachi and Keldeo. In addition, Dragonite is not just another weak wall—it is a legitimately powerful force with STAB Hurricane and the powerful Thunder that many rain stall teams tend to lack. Multiscale makes it an excellent pivot for such teams, allowing it to switch in on attacks even the mightiest of walls cannot take. It has Dragon Tail to beat setup sweepers. Dragonite provides a full package that is exceptionally useful for rain stall teams. This Dragonite set is an excellent tool for rain stall and should be considered for any team utilizing the playstyle.</p> "

        "name": "Tank",
        "description": "<p>This Dragonite set can take on a variety of roles for a team, including paralysis spreader, sweeper, lure, and a check to some of the top threats of the metagame. Thunder Wave allows Dragonite to support slower teammates as well as itself, which most importantly means that it gets more opportunities to use Roost, possibly reactivating Multiscale in the process, allowing it to survive an otherwise fatal hit. With Thunder Wave slowing opposing Pokemon down, Dragonite can invest all of its EVs in bulk and power, making it so Dragonite can function as an effective tank. In a similar vein with Tinkerbell Celebi, Dragonite should aim to spread paralysis early-game and fire off strong attacks later. While Dragonite's 100 base Special Attack doesn't seem like much, it is more than enough to hit a pretty decent majority of the metagame hard thanks to high-power attacks in Draco Meteor and Fire Blast.</p> <p>Due to the heavy threat level of the omnipresent Dragon Dance and Choice Band variants of Dragonite, this set can also act as an effective lure, dealing heavy damage to physical walls such as Slowbro, Gliscor, and Skarmory that might switch in expecting to take an Outrage only to meet a Draco Meteor or a Fire Blast, paving the way for physical sweepers, such as Terrakion and Scizor, to sweep. Luring in physical walls is something rain variants of Dragonite cannot do, as special attacks such as Hurricane and Thunder might be expected under these conditions. If Dragonite is using Leftovers and Thunder Wave happens to be revealed before either of Dragonite's attacks are, it can effectively bluff being the Multiscale shuffler set and surprise foes with a powerful attack, as Multiscale shuffler Dragonite typically does not invest in its offenses. Draco Meteor is Dragonite's strongest attack, and thanks to the STAB boost it receives, only a handful of non-Steel-type Pokemon are able to switch in to it and live to tell the tale. Fire Blast provides excellent coverage alongside Draco Meteor, with the combination of the two attacks only resisted by Heatran. Flamethrower is a viable alternative to Fire Blast, but the drop in power is noticeable. However, if sun support is provided, Flamethrower is generally the better option, as with the sun boost, Flamethrower gets all the KOs Fire Blast would, in addition to having perfect accuracy.</p> <p>To get a sense of this Dragonite's effectiveness as a lure, here are some damage calculations against its common switch-ins:</p> <ul> <li>Life Orb Draco Meteor vs 252/0 Gliscor 97% - 114% <li>Life Orb Draco Meteor vs 252/0 Slowbro 82% - 97%</li> <li>Life Orb Draco Meteor vs 252/0 Hippowdon 84% - 100%</li> <li>Life Orb Draco Meteor vs 252/0 Quagsire 97% - 115%</li> <li>Life Orb Fire Blast vs 252/0 Cloyster 95% - 112%</li> <li>Life Orb Fire Blast vs 252/252+ Skarmory 83% - 99%</li> <li>Life Orb Fire Blast vs 252/216+ Ferrothorn 118% - 139%</li> <li>Life Orb Fire Blast vs 252/92+ Bronzong 68% - 80%</li> </ul> <p>Life Orb is the item of choice to obtain the given amounts of damage listed above. Leftovers is an option to increase Dragonite's survivability, but without Life Orb, Dragonite misses out on a significant amount of OHKOs and 2HKOs, becoming a less effective lure as a result. However, if this Dragonite is used on a sandstorm or hail team, Leftovers will be necessary to mitigate the residual damage. The EVs provided give Dragonite an HP number not divisible by four, guaranteeing that it can switch in on Stealth Rock four times as opposed to three without fainting. The remaining EVs are invested in Special Attack, and a Modest nature is used so that Dragonite can hit as hard as possible and also help obtain the above amounts of damage.</p> <p>If the Special Attack drops from Draco Meteor are an issue, Dragon Pulse can take its place. Dragon Pulse allows Dragonite to stay in longer, thus alleviating its need to switch into Stealth Rock. However, the drop in power is noticeable, and Dragonite loses out on a number of KOs. Dragonite has access to some useful support options, such as Heal Bell and Light Screen, but has trouble fitting them into the set. Additionally, Heal Bell is incompatible with Multiscale, and giving up Multiscale is not recommended under any circumstances. Draco Plate can be used to power up Draco Meteor while maintaining Multiscale, but Dragonite is usually better off boosting both attacks with Life Orb or healing with Leftovers.</p> <p>This set has severe difficultly breaking through Heatran and Blissey, both of which can Toxic and stall out Dragonite. Thanks to the boost in Special Defense it receives from sand, Tyranitar can also wall Dragonite, breaking its Multiscale with sandstorm damage, and threatening Dragonite with its powerful Stone Edge. Tyranitar would also gladly absorb a Thunder Wave, as this allows it to switch in on Scalds from bulky Water-types and not have to risk becoming crippled by a burn. Terrakion makes an excellent partner as it and Dragonite share decent type synergy, and Terrakion can scare off or set up on all three of the aforementioned threats. Dragonite can also eliminate some of Terrakion's checks while providing paralysis support for it to take advantage of with Swords Dance, Rock Polish, or a combination of both. Ninetales is a fine partner to consider because the sun it provides eliminates residual damage caused by opposing hail and sand while boosting the power of Dragonite's Fire-type attack. Dragonite must be cautious of opposing Ground-types as they can switch into Thunder Wave. Two Ground-types in particular that give Dragonite problems are Gastrodon and Landorus-T, both of which can retaliate with 4x super effective Ice-type attacks. However, Landorus-T can't take a hit from Dragonite and Gastrodon will fall to two consecutive Draco Meteors if it takes a little prior damage.</p> <p>As Dragonite is weak to Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin support is obviously appreciated, especially for Life Orb variants, which can be worn down quite quickly. Based on the damage calculations above, entry hazards of your own can help Dragonite net more KOs. Forretress can provide both entry hazards and its Fire-type weakness grants Dragonite more opportunities to switch in. Jirachi makes an excellent partner to this set, as the two resist all of each others' weaknesses and Jirachi can provide much appreciated Wish support. Cleric support can prove useful for healing Dragonite of status, but is not a necessity as Dragonite is immune to Toxic Spikes. Furthermore, the only Pokemon in OU that can safely status Dragonite without being KOed by Draco Meteor or Fire Blast are Blissey, Heatran, and specially defensive Jellicent.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Rain Sweeper",
        "description": "<p>This set, yet another one of Dragonite's rain-utilizing variant, functions as a more independent sweeper rather than a support unit or wallbreaker. Specifically, it makes use of the odd Agility, doubling Dragonite's average Speed which allows it to outrun and take out faster opponents. Keep in mind, however, that this set also invests heavily in Speed, making Dragonite actually quite fast as is; therefore, Agility should only be used if dangerous Choice Scarf Pokemon or otherwise faster threats are present.</p> <p>Thanks to the sheer power of Dragonite's Hurricane and Thunder, backed up by investment and Life Orb, Dragonite can lure in and greatly weaken or KO most of its regular checks and counters. Hurricane 2HKOes standard Ferrothorn with one layer of Spikes, and scores many OHKOs against a large list of offensive threats not resistant to it, such as Salamence, Starmie, and Keldeo (the first two after Stealth Rock damage). Thunder complements Hurricane with additional coverage, especially against the more defensive Water- and Flying-types such as Jellicent, Vaporeon, and Skarmory. The last move depends on personal preference. Aqua Tail breaks down a number of threats, mainly Blissey, Heatran, and most Steel- or Rock-types in the rain, and Tyranitar in sandstorm. Surf is an alternative with perfect accuracy and special damage output, and is generally a better option against most physically defensive Steel-types and Landorus-T. Superpower does most of the things Aqua Tail does, except it is less reliant on weather, takes out Kyurem-B, and ensures that you can win the weather war by OHKOing Tyranitar right off the bat. However, it misses on super effective coverage against Ground-types, which means Dragonite will have a harder time with Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Landorus-T.</p> <p>A Naive nature is preferred here, as the extra Speed points allow Dragonite to outrun a number of important Choice Scarf users, mainly Keldeo, Terrakion, and Latios, after an Agility boost. The increased Speed also generally makes Dragonite more offensively functional and less reliant on Agility in dire situations. A Rash nature, on the other hand, offers more special power and allows Dragonite to attain even more KOs overall. A prime example of this is against 4/0 Kyurem-B, which has an 18.75% chance of being OHKOed by Rash Hurricane after Stealth Rock damage, but can always survive Naive Hurricane. However, keep in mind that +2 Rash Dragonite falls just short of Choice Scarf Terrakion and Keldeo by a single point, which makes it fairly easy to revenge kill considering these variants are very common. If using Surf, use a Timid or Modest nature instead to avoid the Defense drop.</p> <p>A common issue with this set is its inability to KO many Dragon-types in time. While most Dragon-types still dislike taking Hurricane, others, such as Latios and Kyurem-B, can survive and use their respective Dragon-type STAB to revenge kill Dragonite. Therefore, Dragon Pulse is a perfectly valid alternative on this set, OHKOing a number of Dragon-types after Stealth Rock damage. Finding a moveslot for it, however, can be difficult due to the importance and coverage of the listed attacking moves. A good way to get around this is by pairing Dragonite with teammates that also utilize Thunder, such as Rotom-W, and replacing Thunder with Dragon Pulse.</p> <p>Politoed is obviously a required teammate as Hurricane, Thunder, Aqua Tail, and Surf are very reliant on rain support. Politoed should also preferably have Encore or Perish Song in its arsenal in order to force switches, and thus give Dragonite more leeway in setting up. Rapid Spin support is also essential to preserve Multiscale, granting Dragonite even more valuable setup opportunities. This is especially important considering Life Orb puts Dragonite on a timer, and Dragonite itself won't last for long overall. In the rain, good Rapid Spin users include Starmie, which can also utilize the rain offensively, and Tentacruel, which also handles many defensive counters to Dragonite. Speaking of which, even though Dragonite can 2HKO defensive Pokemon, it needs hazard support to do so (especially if Dragonite is running a Naive nature). Sadly, even with the usual Stealth Rock or Spikes support, it also needs additional offensive support to ensure a smooth sweep, as it is easily vulnerable to status and stray attacks while attacking or setting up Agility. Choice Band or Substitute + Swords Dance Terrakion is a particularly good example, as it handily beats and scares off Chansey, Blissey, and defensive Tyranitar, while maintaining good offensive momentum. Keldeo and Gyarados also do a fine job against these threats in addition to Jirachi, while also taking advantage of the rain themselves.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Multiscale Shuffler",
        "description": "<p>While it might seem unorthodox for such a powerful offensive threat, this set is extremely effective with the right support. The goal is to shuffle the opposing team in order to rack up entry hazard damage as well as damage from Dragon Tail, possibly spreading paralysis if it has a chance or instead utilizing that slot to hit Steel-types hard that otherwise do well against Dragonite. Dragonite has an excellent set of resistances and has excellent bulk that is bolstered by Multiscale, having even more bulk than the titan of special walls, Blissey, with Multiscale intact. This set is best for teams built around entry hazards and residual damage, and functions poorly if used like a normal phazer, though if Multiscale is intact it gets the chance to phaze anything not behind a Substitute, barring a Dragon Tail miss.</p> <p>This set has a very simple setup process. First, come in on a resisted move or one that Dragonite is immune to and make sure that the opposing Pokemon cannot deal heavy damage to Dragonite. Next, the goal is to set up a Substitute and attempt to stall with Substitute and Roost while using Dragon Tail every time Dragonite gets a chance. Thunder Wave is usually the modus operandi in order to achieve this, but if paralysis support is already provided, Dragonite can run Flamethrower to deal with the ubiquitous Steel-type switch-ins that are not fazed by entry hazards, such as Skarmory due to its access to recovery and Ferrothorn because of Iron Barbs, making it so Dragon Tail also deals damage to Dragonite if it connects. Forretress is another Steel-type that is problematic, mainly due to being able to spin away the hazards that are vital to this set's success.</p> <p>The given EVs maximize special bulk to ensure that Dragonite takes the least amount of damage from most attacks, particularly most Ice-type attacks. The only other option that might be considered for this set is Fire Blast over Flamethrower, boasting a great deal more power that is particularly useful if 80 EVs are invested in Special Attack from HP in order to 2HKO even the most specially defensive of Skarmory. However, the much higher PP that Flamethrower packs is much more useful as Flamethrower, if used, is a great source of damage for Dragonite. It will need to be spammed in order to actually KO most targets, however, so the lower PP of Fire Blast is a major issue.</p> <p>As with every other Dragonite set, this set greatly appreciates Stealth Rock being removed, and if Dragonite is a team's only phazer it is of utmost importance in order to keep Multiscale intact. Forretress can both provide Rapid Spin support and lay the hazards that this Dragonite set requires to work. Starmie is another option that can also sweep teams weakened by Dragonite's parashuffling due to its amazing coverage. It should also be mentioned that Dragonite is setup fodder for many entry hazard users, which increases the need for a spinner. Entry hazards are needed for this set to make the most of the opposing team being shuffled around, so a good hazard layer such as Ferrothorn or Jirachi is of vital importance to be paired up with Dragonite. Ferrothorn has great defensive synergy and can aid in Dragonite's quest to wear down the opposing team due to its hazards, Leech Seed, and Iron Barbs ability. Jirachi is also noteworthy because it can set up Stealth Rock and pass Wishes to Dragonite, which makes switching in much easier, and has great defensive synergy with Dragonite, one important advantage over Ferrothorn being that it resists Dragonite's Ice-type weakness that Ferrothorn takes neutral damage from. A spinblocker, such as the more offensive Gengar, sturdier Jellicent, or generally annoying Sableye, is useful to prevent these hazards from being spun away.</p> <p>Wish and cleric support are quite helpful, as they aid with switching in and remove harmful status that Dragonite might have received through a misplay or by not having a Substitute up against a status user. The aforementioned Jirachi as well as Blissey and Chansey work well in this regard. If Thunder Wave is being used, something to trap and eliminate Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and other Steel-types is useful. Magnezone is the best choice for the job, doing so with ease. If Flamethrower or Fire Blast is being used, paralysis support is heavily beneficial. The many times aforementioned Jirachi can provide this support as well as Celebi, Chansey, Blissey, and Ferrothorn. Cloyster and Mamoswine trouble this set, and for that matter, all Dragonite, so a Pokemon to beat them is a worthwhile investment. Ferrothorn is an excellent choice, providing other types of helpful support as well, but Rotom-W can beat both as well and has excellent type synergy with Dragonite. By now, you, the reader, have probably absorbed the fact that this Dragonite set requires much more support than other sets. It might seem like a waste of time, but in practice, with the needed support Dragonite will win games. It is all based on how much effort one is willing to put in to make it work.</p> "

  "Mew": {
    "overview": "<p>With its balanced stats, solid level-up movepool, and access to literally every tutor move and TM in the game, it's no surprise that Mew is an easy contender for the title of \"most versatile Pokemon.\" Access to some of the most sought-after support moves, including Will-O-Wisp and Taunt, makes Mew one of the most impressive support Pokemon. However, it's not just the threat of top-notch support that makes Mew so difficult to deal with. Mew's versatility gives it so many different and viable sets to choose from--ranging from support to Baton Pass user, sweeper, and even lead--that Mew has plenty of viable sets, each of which requires the correct answer to prevent it from just taking over the game. Mew is a Pokemon that tests your opponent's reactions first and foremost, and if they react poorly, there will be hell to pay.</p> <p>However, where it shines in versatility it lacks in focus. Its mediocre Speed stat puts it at the mercy of several notable Pokemon, including Keldeo and Latias, and its rather average offensive stats make it difficult to sweep. Still, the threat of these options means that even just seeing Mew puts the opponent on the back foot, and with the right followup, it's easy to ride that advantage to victory.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mew is the king of other options. Seriously, it's not an exaggeration to suggest that Mew can pull off just about any moveset. It has one of the largest movepools in the entire game, second only to Smeargle; however, unlike Smeargle, it has the stats to back them up. Even so, it can be difficult to find sets outside of the ones that are listed that Mew can run without being outclassed or just flat-out mediocre at. A stand-alone Swords Dance set is possible with a moveset consisting of Flame Charge, Drain Punch, and Baton Pass. This unconventional moveset gives Mew the ability to set up Swords Dances and bypass Tyranitar, Scizor, Heatran, and other Steel-types, as well as pass along the boosts to another physical attacker. The support set can utilize either Roar or Dragon Tail for phazing. Mew can also use a Transform set, which can be handy when dealing with an opposing boosting sweeper. To sum it up, Mew gets nearly everything, so go nuts, pick four moves, and see what works for you. If you can imagine it, Mew can probably make it happen.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Countering Mew can be a difficult task due to its staggering versatility. Scouting out its moveset instead of blindly switching in is recommended. Heatran hard-counters support sets, as it resists Psychic-type attacks and is immune to Will-O-Wisp. In fact, if Heatran switches into a Will-O-Wisp, it can retaliate against Mew and its teammates with its boosted Fire-type moves. Strong special attackers are generally suited to taking on Mew. Both Latias and Latios can switch in with little to no trouble and fire off their powerful STAB attacks; however, Mew can actually stall out Choice variants with Soft-Boiled and Special Defense investment. Calm Mind Latios and Latias, on the other hand, can use Mew as setup fodder. Thundurus-T is capable of overpowering Mew with its powerful Electric-type moves or even potentially set up with Nasty Plot or Agility, as Mew cannot OHKO it with Ice Beam. Hydreigon can switch into Mew without worry and fire off its powerful Dark- or Dragon-type STAB moves. Rain sweepers such as Keldeo and Tornadus can similarly overwhelm Mew with their rain-boosted attacks.</p> <p>Lead sets can be dealt with by Tyranitar, who can switch into Mew and OHKO it through its Focus Sash because of Sand Stream. Scizor, Heatran, and assorted Steel-types can also switch in and handle it. That said, knocking Mew out and preventing Mew from setting up Stealth Rock are two very different things. Because of Mew's access to Magic Coat and Focus Sash, it is pretty much guaranteed to set up Stealth Rock. Magic Bounce users, such as Espeon and Xatu, are the best stops to Mew, but both of them need to carry a strong attack to actually damage it. Otherwise, Magic Bounce users can be used to break Mew's Focus Sash and switch into a Pokemon that can OHKO it afterwards. The opponent can always predict this, however.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Mew's counters are separated into two groups: those who can counter it if it lacks Fire Blast, and those who can counter it if it lacks Dark Pulse. Specially defensive Jirachi, for example, is a hard counter to the former Mew, as it can switch in, cripple Mew with Body Slam, and stall out Mew with a combination of Iron Head and Wish. Bulky Swords Dance Scizor can switch into Mew and hit it with a STAB Bug Bite, which easily brings Mew into Bullet Punch's KO range. On the other hand, Mew that lack Dark Pulse can be beaten by Latias, Latios, and Starmie.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Support",
        "description": "<p>Support Mew functions as a top-notch supporting Pokemon with access to effective tools to help it in almost any given scenario. Taunt puts slower defensive Pokemon in an unfavorable position by forcing them to attack, and it can occasionally prevent faster Pokemon from setting up. Will-O-Wisp can burn foes, which constantly saps them of their health and utterly cripples physical attackers. Both moves have wonderful synergy with each other, as the combination of Taunt and burn typically renders a slower Pokemon completely useless. Ice Beam targets a large proportion of OU Pokemon for super effective damage. It's particularly effective against the likes of Garchomp, Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Thundurus-T, who number among the best setup sweepers in the tier. On the other hand, Psychic is more effective against Substitute users and is stronger against the likes of Terrakion, Toxicroak, and Conkeldurr. That said, Ice Beam is usually the better choice, as it's useful for dealing with a wider range of threats. You'll want to maximize Mew's effectiveness by bringing it on the field as quickly and efficiently as possible. Keeping it near max HP at all times is imperative to succeeding with Mew, as it is usually only capable of checking powerful threats when it's healthy.</p> <p>A specially defensive spread can be used to improve Mew's effectiveness against special attackers. This in turn makes it more useful against a wider variety of Pokemon, as Mew can already somewhat deal with incoming physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp, and it can now keep up with strong special attackers. Keep in mind that Will-O-Wisp is not a substitute for physical defense, however, and thus this spread is ineffective against powerful, fast physical attacking Pokemon. Maxing out Mew'd Defense EVs can noticeably increase Mew's physical defense, but you're better off sticking with listed spread as it ensures that Mew is capable of outrunning Jolly Breloom, Adamant Dragonite, and Adamant Gyarados. Night Shade grants Mew the ability to deal consistent damage and is very useful against Substitute users, such as Latias, who would ordinarily set up on Mew. Light Screen strengthens Mew's Special Defense, making it all the more difficult for your opponent to break through Mew, but it comes at the cost of a precious moveslot.</p> <p>Despite having terrific prowess on the physically defensive side, Mew is somewhat vulnerable on the special side; special attackers (especially ones whose attacks are boosted in the rain) are by far the biggest threats to Mew. Pokemon that can deal with Heatran are almost mandatory teammates, as Heatran can effortlessly switch into Mew and turn into a liability for as long as it is active. Tyranitar makes for a good partner as it can usually take on most special attackers, as well as Heatran, and it comes with the added bonus of being able to defeat Latios and Latias, both of whom are strong checks to Mew in their own right. Starmie is a decent partner, as it can also check Heatran and has utility against the likes of Keldeo, who can decimate Mew with Hydro Pump.</p> <p>Mew stands tall as one of the best stallbreakers in the tier, as it is capable of dismantling the most common stall cores on its own. It struggles mightily against rain stall, however, as the prevalence of Scald makes it difficult for Mew to stay on the field. As such, you should strongly consider carrying anti-rain stall measures, such as specially defensive Hippowdon, Celebi, and Starmie.</p> "

        "name": "Lead",
        "description": "<p>Mew's near-limitless movepool and balanced stats make it an effective lead, especially on hyper offensive teams that cannot afford to make room for a Ghost-type Pokemon. With access to Taunt and Magic Coat, Mew beats nearly every other lead in the game and has the advantage of bulk over lead Azelf, whose frailty mandates use of a Focus Sash. Mew's solid bulk allows it to carry a Normal Gem, which secures more significant KOs, such as the near-guaranteed OHKO on defensive Xatu.</p> <p>Taunt shuts down slower opponents, preventing them from setting up their own entry hazards or boosting their stats. Magic Coat, on the other hand, bounces back Stealth Rock and Taunt from faster leads such as Terrakion, Aerodactyl, Azelf, Infernape, and opposing Mew. Taunt gets priority over Magic Coat because it doesn't necessarily stop hazards from being set up; it merely blocks them for a turn. This means that an opponent can continuously use Stealth Rock until Mew runs out of Magic Coat PP. In addition, Taunt is invaluable for completely shutting down opposing suicide leads, such as Forretress and Skarmory. Tailwind is handy for momentum, particularly if Mew is used as a suicide lead. It can set up Stealth Rock quickly, use Tailwind to increase its Speed, and follow up with an Explosion to clear the way for your next switch-in to use the remaining two-turn Speed boost.</p> <p>Zen Headbutt is a decent alternative to Tailwind; it's the strongest physical STAB move in Mew's repertoire and serves as a deterrent to Gengar or Terrakion attempting to switch in and absorb an Explosion.</p> <p>Care must be taken with this particular set. If your opponent has Espeon, Xatu, or Starmie, it is best to save Mew and lead with something else. Explosion is a high-risk high-reward move, especially if your opponent has a Ghost-type on their team. Though a free switch-in might retain you momentum, do not forget Explosion's huge Base Power.</p> <p>Checks to this set include Life Orb Gengar, Choice Specs Latios, and Choice Band Garchomp and Terrakion, all of whom outspeed Mew and threaten it with high-powered STAB attacks. Scizor makes quick work of opposing Gengar and can also handily check Starmie, who is notoriously hard to deal with. Though it shares a Bug-type weakness with Mew, Tyranitar can be a handy partner. In addition to setting up permanent sand, Tyranitar is a good counter to Espeon and Xatu while being a reasonable check to Starmie and Latios so long as it avoids a Water-type move, trapping all four with Pursuit or outright KOing them with Crunch. Gengar also falls prey to Tyranitar, but Tyranitar must be wary of Focus Blast. Dragonite--and just about any other sweeper--appreciates Mew's ability to set up Stealth Rock; additionally, Dragonite can switch into opposing Landorus-T's Ground-type attacks should you wish to save Mew's Explosion. Rotom-W is another Pokemon who appreciates a free switch-in on Earthquake and makes quick work of Landorus-T with its STAB Hydro Pump.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<p>Mew is capable of taking the offensive with Nasty Plot, and it is difficult for opponents to outright counter due to its excellent coverage and high power. Nasty Plot boosts Mew's Special Attack to 598, which gives Mew enough power to OHKO or 2HKO most of the metagame. Psyshock allows Mew to take out special walls such as Chansey and Blissey, as well as other Pokemon that invest in Special Defense. Keep in mind, however, that because it targets Defense, physically defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T and physically defensive Hippowdon are capable of surviving a boosted Psyshock. Psychic, on the other hand, OHKOes both the aforementioned defensive Grounds, and its higher Base Power allows it to score more OHKOs in general. Aura Sphere provides Mew with good coverage, as very few Pokemon resist both Psychic and Fighting. In particular, Aura Sphere allows Mew to beat Tyranitar, one of the most common and prominent special tanks in the metagame.</p> <p>The final slot is up to you and mainly dependent on what your team can handle. Dark Pulse lets Mew take down opposing Psychic-types, such as Latias, Latios, Starmie, and Reuniclus, while Fire Blast lets Mew KO Steel-types neutral to Fighting-type moves. Jirachi, Forretress, Scizor, and Skarmory are all OHKOed by +2 Fire Blast. Fire Blast also lets Mew OHKO standard Landorus-T after Stealth Rock and deal heavy damage to physically defensive Hippowdon after a boost, which effectively eliminates Psyshock's weakness. The biggest advantage to using Nasty Plot Mew over any other special sweeper is its unpredictability. Its counters are mainly based on its final coverage move. For example, Latias and Starmie can check Mew if it's using Fire Blast, while bulky Steel-types, particularly Scizor and Jirachi, can just as easily counter Mew if it's using Dark Pulse.</p> <p>To show the power that Mew can bring to the table, here are some calculations. Unless stated otherwise, assume Mew has a Life Orb and one Nasty Plot boost:</p> <ul> <li>Psyshock vs 252/252+ Blissey 72% - 84.9% <li>Psyshock vs 252/252+ Chansey 53.3% - 62.8%</li> <li>Aura Sphere vs 252/252+ Tyranitar 101% - 118.8%</li> <li>Dark Pulse vs 248/8 Jellicent 89.57 - 105.7%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs 244/0 Landorus-T 92.41 - 108.94%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs 252/0 Hippowdon 88.1% - 103.8%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs 252/252+ Jirachi 103% - 121.3%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs 252/252+ Celebi 100.99 - 119.05%</li> <li>+0 Fire Blast vs 252/216+ Ferrothorn 109.1% - 128.4%</li> </ul> <p>Leftovers is a good alternative to Life Orb as it increases Mew's overall survivability, but it comes at the cost of some firepower. A Lum Berry is useful as it allows Mew to avoid status once, which helps in taking out Pokemon that rely on status to beat Mew. A Modest nature and a spread of 220 HP / 252 SpA / 36 Spe can be used to increase Mew's bulk and further boost its damage potential, securing a few more OHKOs at +2 (such as Garchomp and Gastrodon), but this reduces Mew's Speed and its ability to outspeed certain threats. Specifically, Mew now fails to outrun max Speed Haxorus and Hydreigon, and it also misses out on the Speed tie with opposing base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Salamence, Volcarona, Celebi, and Jirachi.</p> <p>Mew has a couple of extra moves at its disposal. Giga Drain can be used over a coverage move to OHKO the likes of Politoed, Rotom-W, Jellicent, and Gastrodon after a Nasty Plot boost, which is significant as each of these Pokemon can potentially avoid the OHKO from +2 Psyshock. Calm Mind bolsters Mew's defense and prevents it from being checked as easily by special attackers. It's difficult to take the offensive with Calm Mind as Mew's boosting move due to its comparatively lower power boost, however. Baton Pass is an interesting move to use on Nasty Plot Mew. It weakens Mew's ability to sweep by replacing a coverage move, but it allows Mew to make a hasty retreat should a counter switch into it. Mew can simply pass along those Nasty Plot boosts, making it a hybrid sweeper and team player. Baton Pass also helps Mew differentiate itself from other powerful Nasty Plot users such as Thundurus-T. Soft-Boiled gives Mew reliable recovery and is effective against stall teams that rely on wearing down opposing sweepers. Soft-Boiled works particularly well with Life Orb because it allows Mew to keep its power without compromising its bulk. Unfortunately, as with Baton Pass, it cuts down on Mew's sweeping ability by eating up a moveslot.</p> <p>Similarly to any other sweeper, Mew appreciates the presence of entry hazards to achieve several OHKOs. Blissey is typically OHKOed by a boosted Psyshock if Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes are on the field. Reliable entry hazard users, such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn, are good partners to Mew for this very reason. While Nasty Plot Mew is incredibly difficult to outright counter, it has several checks that keep it from being a top threat. The Pokemon that can check Mew are completely dependent on Mew's coverage moves. Specially defensive Jirachi is a strong counter if Mew isn't carrying Fire Blast, while Latias and Latios are very reliable counters if Mew lacks Dark Pulse. Faster Pokemon, such as Latias, Latios, Starmie, and Gengar, can switch into a resisted attack or Nasty Plot and force Mew out with their powerful STAB attacks. Choice Scarf Tyranitar is a solid partner for Mew because it can counter Latias and Latios and check Starmie and Gengar. Bulky Scizor is also capable of checking Latias, Latios, and Gengar. Additionally, unlike Tyranitar, it doesn't summon sandstorm, keeping Mew from taking extra residual damage.</p> "

  "Xatu": {
    "overview": "<p>Xatu has a niche in the OU metagame as the best Magic Bounce user and one of the best sources of entry hazard control. Xatu is able to completely shut down passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Hippowdon while also being a soft check to most Ground- and Grass-types. However, it has mediocre base stats, a shallow offensive movepool, and an exploitable defensive typing that makes it vulnerable to a lot of the metagame's offensive threats, including very effective Stealth Rock users like Garchomp, Heatran, and Jirachi. Once these Pokemon set Stealth Rock, Xatu's Stealth Rock weakness becomes a thorn in its side.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Xatu needs Reflect or Feather Dance to stand a chance against Tyranitar, so other moves should only be considered over U-turn or Toxic. Heat Wave is Xatu's best way to damage Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Excadrill, Scizor, and Forretress but has very low utility in general, especially in rain matchups. Hidden Power Ice can better deal with Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T, but it's very weak outside of those targets. Psychic and Air Slash are Xatu's best STAB options, and they can be used as emergency Breloom answers, but they are normally very weak. Protect can be used to scout Choice-locked Pokemon, but it lets Tyranitar easily Pursuit trap Xatu even with Reflect or Feather Dance, so you may as well run it in that moveslot. Skill Swap can be used to defeat any variation of Poison Heal Gliscor and make Xatu an emergency check to Poison Heal Breloom and badly poisoned Reuniclus, but losing Magic Bounce enables the opposing team's entry hazards. Thunder Wave, Light Screen, and Wish are Xatu's other support options for more defensive builds, but Toxic is generally the preferred move in those teams. Leftovers can be used if the extra damage of Rocky Helmet isn't needed, but this turns Xatu into a very passive Pokemon and lets Tyranitar fish for Crunch Defense drops. A set with dual screens, U-turn, and Light Clay is also possible, but this is done better by Espeon because of its base Speed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Offensive Stealth Rock users: Xatu's biggest issue is its Stealth Rock weakness, so Stealth Rock users that can KO or threaten it out are problematic. Heatran can heavily damage Xatu with Magma Storm or Lava Plume, effectively defeating it or scaring it away to use Stealth Rock. Terrakion threatens an immediate KO with Stone Edge, letting it freely set up Swords Dance, Substitute, or Stealth Rock. Jirachi can threaten to KO Xatu with Thunder or Iron Head flinches to safely set up Stealth Rock, but sets reliant on the latter must be wary of Reflect + Rocky Helmet. Offensive Ground-types like Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Excadrill scare Xatu away with strong attacks or setup moves in order to safely use Stealth Rock. Mold Breaker Excadrill in particular can set up Stealth Rock freely.</p> <p><strong>Rain Pokemon: Politoed loves using Xatu as a way to safely activate Drizzle, and it 2HKOes Xatu with Scald. With rain up, Tentacruel and Starmie can freely use Rapid Spin or their STAB moves with almost no penalty against it. Tornadus threatens Xatu out with Hurricane, so it can grab momentum with Substitute, Tailwind, or U-turn. Keldeo also threatens an immediate KO with its Water-type attacks in rain. Jirachi can freely set up a 101 HP Substitute on Xatu and threaten it with perfect accuracy Thunder.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Reuniclus can use Xatu to set up Calm Mind or Trick Room with almost no penalty, and it threatens Xatu with Thunder, Hidden Power Ice, or Shadow Ball; however, chip damage from Night Shade and U-turn can force Reuniclus to spend a turn healing. Volcarona can use Xatu to safely set up Quiver Dance, but it needs to watch out for Toxic if it's lacking Lum Berry. Gliscor can set up Swords Dance on Xatu with almost no penalty, since it can outstall Feather Dance's PP and heal Night Shade damage with Protect + Poison Heal, but it must be wary of the rare Hidden Power Ice or Skill Swap. Poison Heal Breloom can use Xatu to set up Swords Dance or Bulk Up, as it can use Protect + Poison Heal to negate Night Shade damage; however, Xatu wins if sand or hail is up, or if it's carrying Skill Swap or a STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar: Choice Scarf Tyranitar can heavily damage Xatu before it can set up Reflect, effectively defeating it. Slower Tyranitar can also defeat Rocky Helmet Xatu by using Ice Beam or Stone Edge, or a non-Rocky Helmet variant with a Crunch Defense drop, opening opportunities to set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Powerful Dragon-types like Latios, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon threaten an immediate KO with their STAB moves. Pokemon like Dragonite, Latias, Kyurem, and Salamence can use Xatu as setup fodder for Substitute, Calm Mind, or Dragon Dance.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Rotom-W can heavily damage Xatu with Hydro Pump or steal offensive momentum via slow Volt Switch. Magnezone scares Xatu away immediately with Thunderbolt or Volt Switch. Thundurus-T can force Xatu out to safely set up Substitute or Agility.</p> ",

        "name": "Utility",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Roost is Xatu's best recovery move and can help it by removing its Volt Switch weakness. Night Shade breaks Substitute and does good damage to the vast majority of the metagame. Reflect and Feather Dance have basically the same function: weaken Tyranitar so it can't Pursuit trap Xatu. They also have the utility of softening physical offensive pressure for Xatu's teammates. Reflect has more PP and helps Xatu's teammates even if the foe switches out, so it's generally superior, but Feather Dance never needs renewal turns and can be stacked, helping Xatu stall out Tyranitar that get Crunch Defense drops or use moves that don't activate Rocky Helmet like Stone Edge and Ice Beam. Feather Dance is also less exploitable by Swords Dance sweepers like Gliscor and Breloom. U-turn is Xatu's best option to keep momentum and avoid being setup fodder, since it is a bit frail and passive, but Toxic can be used to remove a bit of Xatu's passivity if its teammates don't care about the momentum U-turn generates. However, Toxic makes Xatu vulnerable to Reuniclus and Celebi. Rocky Helmet, alongside Reflect or Feather Dance, lets Xatu outstall a Tyranitar that tries to Pursuit trap it, as well punish Landorus-T's U-turn, Breloom's Facade, Skarmory's Brave Bird, and Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP and 184 Defense EVs let Xatu never be 2HKOed by standard Tyranitar's Crunch, even with sand damage, after Reflect or Feather Dance. 72 Speed EVs make Xatu faster than all Tyranitar. Impish is the prefered nature if U-turn is being used. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 208 Def / 48 SpD with 30 Speed IVs can be used to underspeed utility Gliscor so it can't set Stealth Rock after Xatu's U-turn, and to never be 2HKOed by Naive Landorus-T's Hidden Power Ice, even with sand up, but this spread makes Xatu susceptible to being trapped by fast offensive Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Xatu's main function is to prevent entry hazards, so don't be afraid of sending Xatu out against hazard setters. Play smart with switches, U-turn, and Night Shade so opposing Pokemon can't grab momentum or use Xatu as setup fodder. Use Roost when Xatu must be active to block a crucial entry hazard that can prevent its teammates from setting up or Choice Scarf cleaning. If facing Tyranitar, use Reflect or Feather Dance as soon as possible to avoid being KOed by Crunch or Pursuit. Be wary of Knock Off users like Ferrothorn and Seismitoad, since they can effectively lure Xatu in and remove its item, allowing it be trapped by Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Xatu fits best in balance teams. In those structures, it's common to see bulky Water-types or Water-immune Pokemon like Seismitoad, Jellicent, and Slowking as well bulky Steel-types, like Heatran and Ferrothorn. Offensive Ground-types like Excadrill, Gliscor, Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Landorus-T use the offensive momentum Xatu can generate with U-turn. Excadrill in particular is an awesome option, as it can use Xatu's Magic Bounce to drop Rapid Spin for a setup move in Substitute or Swords Dance. Pokemon that love having Spikes users neutered, like Hippowdon, Jirachi, Scizor, Amoonguss, and Celebi, are also valuable teammates, since they can cover some of Xatu's type weaknesses. Xatu also finds itself as a central piece of most sun-oriented teams. In those, Pokemon like Ninetales, Cresselia, Chansey, and Blissey are very good defensive partners. More offensively, Pokemon like Victini, Dragonite, Kyurem-B, Kyurem, Salamence, and Ditto love Xatu's hazard control. Xatu's most ingenious partner, however, is Volcarona, which despises Stealth Rock and can use Reflect for more setup opportunites.</p> "

  "Politoed": {
    "overview": "<p>Politoed is one of the most prominent Pokemon in BW OU for one reason: its ability to put permanent rain on the field. This alone makes it one of the best support Pokemon in the metagame, as it brings out the full potential of Pokemon such as Keldeo, Tentacruel, Tornadus, and Thundurus-T. In addition, Politoed is capable of spreading status around the opposing team, allowing you to wear it down far more easily. Politoed's main shortcoming is its middling stats, as it is not capable of dishing out or soaking up significant amounts of damage. Its mediocre defensive stats are exacerbated by its vulnerability to all types of entry hazards and lack of reliable recovery.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Politoed can run Defense EVs to serve as a switch-in to Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Tyranitar and reduce Pursuit damage, but its Special Defense is often more valuable to allow it to handle Pokemon such as Latios, Reuniclus, and Alakazam. Ice Beam is an option to damage Pokemon such as Breloom, Latios, and Dragonite on the switch, but it is hard to fit onto a set and these Pokemon are better handled by Politoed's teammates anyway. Perish Song puts Pokemon such as Calm Mind Reuniclus and Substitute + Dragon Dance Dragonite on a timer and can be used to force out other Pokemon, but it isn't as immediately effective as Encore. An offensive set with Special Attack EVs, a Modest nature, and an item such as Water Gem—with Thief to steal a Leftovers after using the Gem—is an option to surprise the opponent and deal heavy damage with a powerful Hydro Pump. However, it significantly compromises Politoed's bulk and longevity, and, as not fainting is the name of the game with Politoed, it is not recommended. A Choice Scarf set can be used to surprise and outspeed an opposing Pokemon and KO them, acting as a decent cleaner late-game and crippling Pokemon with a fast Encore, but it compromises Politoed's longevity and Politoed isn't really fast or strong enough to be a good Choice Scarf user anyway. A Choice Specs set can be used to deal heavy damage out of the gate with Hydro Pump, but it sacrifices longevity and there are better wallbreakers for rain teams anyway. Both Choice Scarf and Choice Specs can leave Politoed extremely vulnerable to Pursuit, making it tougher to keep rain up over the course of a game. A Rest + Chesto Berry set can be run, but it sacrifices a moveslot and the passive recovery of Leftovers, and Rest can only be used once without sacrificing a significant amount of momentum. Custap Berry can also be run with Endeavor to catch the opponent off-guard and significantly cripple a Pokemon, but it lacks consistency. Focus Blast and Fighting Gem can be used to hit Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Tyranitar hard and give solid neutral coverage otherwise. In addition, Psychic can be used to hit Tentacruel, Breloom, and Toxicroak, but it is hard to justify over Politoed's other moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Weather Changers: Ninetales can switch into Politoed's Scald relatively easily and replaces rain with sun, nullifying Politoed's main supportive capability. Tyranitar and Hippowdon also change the weather in addition to canceling out Politoed's Leftovers recovery, and Tyranitar can also use Pursuit to quickly wear Politoed down, but they can't enter directly into a Scald.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Poison Heal Breloom and Celebi can switch into boosted Water-type attacks without taking much damage. In addition, they don't fear a Scald burn or Toxic and can use Politoed as setup fodder. Ferrothorn is immune to Toxic, scares out Politoed with Power Whip, and can set up entry hazards in its face. Amoonguss is immune to Toxic and can scare it out with Giga Drain. However, Ferrothorn and Amoonguss both hate being burned by Scald.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types such as Latios, Hydreigon, and Kyurem-B take little from Scald and can respond with their powerful STAB moves. Dragonite can threaten Politoed immediately with a Choice Band Outrage or set up with its Substitute + Dragon Dance set. Latias and Kyurem can use Politoed as setup fodder for Calm Mind or Substitute, respectively. However, none of them appreciate a Scald burn, Toxic, or Encore.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon: Pokemon such as Jellicent and Gastrodon are immune to Scald, can wall Politoed that are not carrying Toxic, and can cripple it with Taunt or Will-O-Wisp in Jellicent's case or Toxic in Gastrodon's. Seismitoad can wall Politoed all day, as it often runs Refresh, and can cripple Politoed with Toxic, Knock Off, or a Scald burn. Toxicroak is immune to Scald and Toxic, but it needs to be careful of Encore.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types such as Thundurus-T and Rotom-W can deal heavy damage to Politoed with their STAB moves. In addition, Rotom-W can switch into Politoed relatively safely, as it resists Water.</p> <p><strong>Status-resistant Pokemon: Pokemon such as Chansey, Blissey, and Celebi take little from Scald and can shrug off burns or Toxic with Natural Cure or Aromatherapy. Reuniclus, thanks to Magic Guard, takes no damage from status and can set up on Politoed lacking Encore or attack it directly if running Thunder. Defensive Starmie and Milotic resist Scald and can shrug off any status with Recover + Natural Cure or Refresh, respectively.</p> ",

        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald packs a decent punch when boosted by rain. One of its most important aspects, though, is its burn chance, meaning it can cripple Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Tentacruel that can't afford to be chipped down. Protect allows Politoed to stall for additional Leftovers recovery and burn or Toxic damage. In addition, it can be used to scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Latios, allowing you to play around them more safely. The last two moveslots depend on your personal preference and team. Refresh is an excellent move to help deal with Pokemon such as Tentacruel, Heatran, and opposing Politoed that spread status, allowing your Politoed to stay in the game longer. Notably, it allows you to use Politoed as your main switch-in to opposing Scalds so that you do not need to risk Politoed's teammates being burned. Encore is an option to deal with Pokemon such as Calm Mind Reuniclus and Substitute Breloom, which otherwise set up on Politoed for free. Toxic can be used to cripple Politoed's other switch-ins such as Latios, Jellicent, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W. Note that while running Toxic + Encore is viable, it leaves Politoed worn down very quickly by passive damage such as status, sand, and entry hazards, and thus Politoed will require more caution switching into status users.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers improves Politoed's longevity and alleviates its vulnerability to entry hazards. A specially defensive EV spread allows Politoed to take hits from the numerous powerful special attackers in BW, such as Latios, Reuniclus, and Alakazam, and allows it to better handle chip damage from moves like Rotom-W's Volt Switch. Running additional Speed EVs is an option to get the jump on slower Breloom variants and use Encore against them, as Breloom can quickly become a problem for rain teams.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Politoed's primary objective in a game is to avoid being KOed and keep rain up. Therefore, it is critical to be mindful of its HP. That said, rain teams tend to be more offensive in nature, so it is likely that Politoed will be called upon to act as a temporary buffer against opposing threats. Take care when using Protect or Encore, as either can give a free switch to an opposing Tyranitar, both replacing rain with sand and giving Tyranitar a chance to use Pursuit on Politoed, which can go a long way in winning the weather war. As it runs Protect, Politoed is great at scouting Choice item users such as Latios and Keldeo, so you can double switch Politoed into them and play around them. Feel free to use Scald liberally, as the chip damage even without a burn can be significant, and landing a burn can be huge against Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Latios, and Rotom-W.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>A great many Pokemon pair well with Politoed's rain. Politoed's best partner is arguably Tentacruel, which becomes one of the most difficult to KO Pokemon in the game when rain is active thanks to Rain Dish and is almost mandatory on rain teams. Tentacruel can use Rapid Spin to clear entry hazards, improving the longevity of its entire team, and has similar switch-ins to Politoed, meaning they can wear down each other's checks with repeated Scalds and Toxics. Toxicroak is another Pokemon that greatly benefits from rain healing it, and it is an excellent counter to opposing rain teams. Tentacruel and Toxicroak are both solid switch-ins to opposing Keldeo as well, which can cause tremendous damage under rain. Ferrothorn and Jirachi have their Fire weaknesses reduced by rain, can set up entry hazards, and are great switch-ins to opposing Dragon-types such as Latios that can do major damage otherwise. Ferrothorn can also use Knock Off to remove the Leftovers of other Pokemon, most notably other Ferrothorn, making it easier for your offensive Pokemon to break through them and for Politoed and Tentacruel to chip them down with Scalds and burns. Breloom also has its Fire weakness alleviated by rain, and it can switch into Pokemon such as Rotom-W that threaten Politoed and notably pairs well with Jirachi. The most prominent offensive teammate for Politoed is Keldeo, which becomes an immensely powerful wallbreaker with Choice Specs or a great cleaner with Choice Scarf, and it can run other sets to take advantage of Politoed's rain as well. Starmie and Gyarados are also Pokemon that can take advantage of the power boost to Water-type moves granted by Politoed's rain. Thundurus-T and Tornadus have perfect accuracy with Thunder and Hurricane, respectively, in rain, and both Pokemon can force damage onto an opposing Tyranitar, helping keep rain up. They can also provide some defensive utility, switching into Ground-types such as Excadrill and Landorus-T. Latios is another Pokemon that is found on a large number of rain teams, checking opposing Keldeo and Thundurus-T, crippling Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Reuniclus with Trick, and overall causing mayhem for the opposing team with its powerful attacks. In addition, its Surf is powered up by rain, making Surf a valuable tool for late-game cleaning, and it benefits from Pokemon like Thundurus-T and Tornadus weakening Tyranitar. Dragonite appreciates the removal of sand and the reliable spinning that Tentacruel provides, which let it make better use of Multiscale with its Choice Band, mixed attacker, and Substitute + Dragon Dance sets. Kyurem and Kyurem-B also appreciate the removal of sand and are capable of switching into Grass- and Electric-types that threaten Politoed to force them out. Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Mamoswine can check Thundurus-T and set up Stealth Rock. Mamoswine can also pick off Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Latios with Ice Shard, and it takes little from Ice-type attacks thanks to Thick Fat, making it a decent offensive check to a weakened Thundurus-T.</p> "

  "Espeon": {
    "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced around the time BW was the main generation. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the current BW OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Espeon has long been relegated to the role of cutest Pokemon in the game, only being used in ultimate cutemon teams. This was in large part due to it being outclassed by other Psychic-types, such as Alakazam and Azelf. However, Dream World has granted Espeon a second chance in its Pokecareer in the form of Magic Bounce. Magic Bounce allows Espeon to act as a team supporter, bouncing back most non-attacking moves, most notably Stealth Rock, Taunt, and Roar. It also has a handy base 110 Speed and an impressive Special Attack, allowing it to outspeed and OHKO potent threats such as Terrakion and Keldeo with ease. Unfortunately for Espeon, its physical bulk is poor, meaning that a single misprediction can result in its death. This is further compounded by the fact that Espeon's main counters—Tyranitar and Scizor—all get a fair amount of usage. Espeon is also largely outclassed by Xatu in a general support role, but still finds a niche setting up screens for hyper offense teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Espeon can choose to run an offensive Calm Mind set, working off its high base 130 Special Attack, but its lack of physical bulk will often leave you disappointed when you try setting up. In addition, offensive Calm Mind does not use Espeon's fantastic ability Magic Bounce to the best of its ability, the biggest thing Espeon has over other Psychic-types, making it somewhat outclassed by them. Morning Sun can be useful, especially when used in tandem with Drought Ninetales, but the common usage of other weather starters also makes it unreliable. At first glimpse, Espeon looks like a good Choice Specs or Choice Scarf user, but it really isn't. Its movepool is rather shallow and getting locked into a Psychic-type move is an incredibly bad idea, especially with Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Scizor running around.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Espeon's main counters are Tyranitar and Scizor. Tyranitar can come into basically anything with impunity and KO with Crunch if Espeon chooses to stay in, or Pursuit if it lacks Baton Pass and tries switching out. Scizor hits Espeon's lower Defense stat with a powerful U-turn, but must be wary of Espeon carrying Hidden Power Fire. Heatran is also an excellent counter as it can switch into all of Espeon's moves, fearing only the occasional Hidden Power Ground. Volcarona makes an excellent switch-in because of the fact that it has high Special Defense, tanking any move Espeon throws at it, and can promptly KO with Bug Buzz or simply set up Quiver Dance boosts.</p> <p>Generally speaking, anything faster with a strong physical attack should do well against Espeon. This includes Pokemon such as Weavile, which has no problem with dispatching Espeon, and Choice Scarf Salamence, which will promptly KO Espeon with an Outrage.</p> ",

        "name": "Dual Screens",
        "description": "<p>When you combine Espeon's ability to reflect hazards and set up dual screens, it becomes a very good team supporter. Espeon is most effective when brought in on an entry hazard setter such as Forretress or Ferrothorn, bouncing back any hazards they attempt to set up. Espeon can then proceed to set up screens to ensure that if the foe does try attacking, it does significantly less damage. However, you should be cautious of switching Espeon in blindly, as a Gyro Ball from Forretress or Ferrothorn will put a major dent into it and greatly reduce its longevity. As such, when you do attempt to set up screens, it is recommended to set up Reflect first, as it helps to boost Espeon's poor Defense and gives it additional protection from common switch-ins such as Tyranitar and Scizor.</p> <p>Espeon's often overlooked base 130 Special Attack ensures that it is not setup fodder for rampant threats such as Thundurus-T and Keldeo. Psychic is the preferred STAB over Psyshock as it is naturally stronger and allows Espeon the ability to beat Bulk Up Conkeldurr. Although Psyshock is slightly weaker, it does allow Espeon to beat Calm Mind Keldeo and Terrakion in sandstorm, as it hits their weaker Defense stat. Baton Pass might seem like an odd choice, especially when Espeon is lacking any boosting move, but it is incredibly useful. Baton Pass allows Espeon to escape the clutches of Pursuit users, as Pursuit does not hit Espeon if it uses Baton Pass beforehand. Combine this information with the fact that Espeon's main two switch-ins, Tyranitar and Scizor, are both Pursuit users, and Baton Pass can often save Espeon from death. However, if running away from your problems doesn't tickle your fancy, then Hidden Power Fire is a usable option over Baton Pass. Hidden Power Fire allows Espeon to KO Scizor before it can use U-turn or Pursuit, and with a Reflect up, Bullet Punch doesn't do nearly enough to KO Espeon. Unfortunately, Hidden Power Fire also leaves Espeon incredibly vulnerable to Tyranitar, almost always resulting in Espeon's demise.</p> <p>The EV spread is fairly straightforward; simply maximize HP and Speed to give Espeon as much bulk as possible while retaining max Speed. A Timid nature is essentially required as it allows Espeon to outspeed potent threats such as Landorus and Thundurus-T. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 68 Def / 188 Spe can be used to gain more physical bulk and still be able to outspeed Jolly Garchomp. However, this spread loses out on the ability to outspeed prominent threats such as Terrakion and Keldeo, which can very well be the difference in a battle. Light Clay is also required, as it extends the amount of turns Reflect and Light Screen will be up from five to eight. Hidden Power Ground is an option in the fourth slot in order to hit Heatran for major damage while also getting some damage on Tyranitar, while Hidden Power Fighting can be used to hit Tyranitar hard, although not hard enough to OHKO it.</p> <p>Good teammates for Espeon are Pokemon that enjoy dual screen support and the lack of entry hazards such as Stealth Rock. Fast, frail sweepers such as Salamence and Haxorus are good partners for Espeon, as they are able to come in and Dragon Dance with additional bulk. Volcarona is also a good partner as it greatly appreciates Stealth Rock being absent and can then proceed to use Quiver Dance and wreak havoc. In terms of beating Espeon's common switch-ins, Heatran is a nice teammate for Espeon, as it is able to roast Scizor, while also being able to burn Tyranitar with Will-o-Wisp and KO opposing Heatran with Earth Power.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<p>Although Espeon is typically seen and used as a support unit, this set takes advantage of its fantastic Special Attack and Speed stats, allowing Espeon to pose as a formidable special attacker while still being able to utilize Magic Bounce effectively. This variant also doesn't lose momentum as often as the other sets due to its splendid power and coverage, and offers a greater chance of luring and beating opponents that would normally stay in against Espeon. Psyshock is the preferred STAB move on this set as it reliably attains more kills against relevant threats; this includes an OHKO on Terrakion in sandstorm and Calm Mind Keldeo, and a 2HKO against special walls such as Gastrodon and Blissey. On the other hand, Psychic is an overall more powerful option for physical walls such as Gliscor and Hippowdon. Hidden Power Fire is nigh-mandatory; boosted by Life Orb and investment, it wipes out Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Forretress, Skarmory, and Scizor, all of which are number one targets for this set.</p> <p>In the third slot, Signal Beam is chosen as it has good coverage with Psyshock and hits Dark- and Psychic-types such as Hydreigon and Celebi super effectively. Grass Knot can be used over Signal Beam for a chance to 2HKO 252 HP/0 SpD Tyranitar and OHKO Gastrodon and Hippowdon, but note that Espeon should not risk staying in front of a healthy Tyranitar. The last slot ultimately determines how Espeon performs against its regular counters. Baton Pass allows Espeon to scout and virtually be immune to slower Pursuits, especially those coming from Tyranitar, Scizor, and Metagross. Protect is an equally useful alternative which eases prediction and scouts the opponent's next possible move; this is especially useful against Metagross, Scizor, and other priority users, most of whom might use their respective priority attacks rather than Pursuit or any other move.</p> <p>As far as other options go, Hidden Power Ground specifically hits Heatran, which walls this set otherwise, but leaves Espeon helpless against a host of important Steel-types this set was designed to win against. Calm Mind is another option to boost Espeon's offense even further, allowing it to break through some defensively-oriented threats and cores while preventing opponents attempting to accumulate Life Orb recoil. Keep in mind that Espeon might not find time to effectively utilize the boost as, without the protection of Protect or Baton Pass, its sweep is often stopped short by Choice Scarf users and priority.</p> <p>Espeon should obviously be paired with teammates that benefit from the lack of entry hazards on its side of the field. Again, due to its expanded coverage and power, it is recommended to choose Pokemon that can clean up after it, namely late-game sweepers and attackers such as Choice Scarf Keldeo and Dragon Dance Dragonite. It should be noted that Espeon is hard-walled by Heatran and defensive Latias; reasonably bulky Water-types, such as Gyarados, Rotom-W, and Keldeo, can take care of Heatran, while specially defensive Jirachi easily handles Latias. Espeon also pairs well with teammates that can take moves such as Bullet Punch and Pursuit, as it can escape them with Protect or Baton Pass, respectively. Rotom-W, Cobalion, Gyarados, Keldeo, Jirachi, Volcarona, Magnezone, Scizor, and Heatran do not mind these two moves at all, and can also take most other forms of priority reasonably well. Bulky Volcarona in particular stands out, as it can set up on these moves easily and put immediate pressure on the opposing team after a Quiver Dance boost, and also appreciates Espeon's ability to keep Stealth Rock away.</p> "

  "Slowking": {
    "overview": "<p>With its useful typing, good defensive stats, and awesome ability in Regenerator, Slowking claims its spot in BW OU as one of the very few effective counters to Keldeo. Due to its high Special Defense, Slowking can also shrug off special hits from top tier threats like Latios, Alakazam, and Tornadus. Its problems are its very low Speed and average physical bulk, which make Slowking a target for U-turn users like Landorus-T and Scizor as well as powerful physical attackers like Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Garchomp.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast to have a perfectly accurate move, but its power loss is big, and it can prevent Slowking from KOing its main target, Ferrothorn. Future Sight can be used alongside Dragon Tail to force damage on Pokemon that are weak to it, like Breloom and Keldeo, but the randomness of Dragon Tail makes this a bit unreliable. Toxic is another option, but Slowking's moveslots are valuable, and spreading status is normally done better by other Pokemon. Protect lets Slowking get out of KO range against strong Pokemon like Keldeo and Mamoswine while also letting it scout for Choice-locked moves and stack Leftovers recovery or sand damage, but it's hard to find a moveslot for it. Calm Mind can be used on a physically defensive set to have a backup cleaner, but this job is better done by Slowbro or Reuniclus. Nasty Plot can be used to more effectively threaten sand teams, but it costs a valuable move slot and can struggle to get KOs even at +2 due to Slowking's relatively low Special Attack. Lack of power is also why offensive Trick Room sets struggle to be worthwhile. Grass Knot can be used to KO Gastrodon and Seismitoad while doing decent damage to Jellicent, but it lacks other targets. Signal Beam can be used to pressure Celebi while damaging other Psychic-types but hits little else. Magic Coat, Block, or Disable can be used as a way to defeat other balance structures, but it's very difficult to find a moveslot for them. Reflect can be used to prevent Slowking from being Pursuit trapped by Scizor and Tyranitar while supporting its teammates with the Defense boost, but Pursuit users are normally afraid of being burned by directly switching into Scald anyway. Hail is an option on weatherless teams to remove sand, rain, and sun. Eject Button can be used alongside a Pursuit user to instantly remove Latios, but the lack of Leftovers reduces Slowking's utility throughout the game, especially if sand is up. A set with Choice Specs + Trick can be used to get surprise KOs or to cripple Slowking's common switch-ins, but it becomes very mediocre once the surprise factor wears off. A set with maximum Defense investment and a Bold nature maximizes Slowking's defensive utility against sand at the expense of its reliability against rain offense</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>VoltTurn users: Rotom-W can burn Slowking with Will-O-Wisp, use it as a Pain Split target, or directly damage it with Volt Switch, only fearing a Scald burn or the rare Toxic. Scizor threatens to OHKO Slowking with Choice Band or Life Orb-boosted U-turn, but it must watch out for a Scald burn or Fire Blast. Landorus-T can heavily damage Slowking with Earthquake and U-turn, but it can't directly switch into Slowking. Tornadus similarly uses Hurricane and U-turn but it also doesn't like to directly switch into an attacking move or Thunder Wave. Thundurus-T and Magnezone can threaten Slowking immediately with Volt Switch or a stronger Electric-type move, but they have a hard time switching into an attacking move.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit: Tyranitar creates a deadly mind game with Crunch and Pursuit, especially if it's a more offensive variant. Scizor and Weavile also force Pursuit mind games. However, all of those Pokemon must watch out for a Scald burn and, if running Choice items, can be effectively scouted with Protect should Slowking be running it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Celebi takes little damage even from Fire Blast and can use Slowking to heal, set up Stealth Rock or Nasty Plot, or threaten it immediately with a Grass-type move. Ferrothorn can deal massive damage to Slowking with Power Whip, remove its item with Knock Off, or use it to stack entry hazards, but it must be wary of Fire Blast or a Scald burn. Amoonguss can wall any Slowking lacking Psyshock or Fire Blast. Breloom can threaten an immediate OHKO with Technician Bullet Seed or heavily damage Slowking with Seed Bomb from Poison Heal sets, but it can't switch into Psychic, Fire Blast, or Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Kyurem-B only cares about Scald burns and Thunder Wave, and it threatens an immediate OHKO with Outrage or Fusion Bolt. Choice Specs Hydreigon threatens a 2HKO with Dark Pulse, but it must be wary of Ice Beam and Thunder Wave. Latios and Latias can set up Calm Mind on any Slowking lacking Dragon Tail, Thunder Wave, or the rarer Toxic. Similarly, Dragonite can use non-Dragon Tail Slowking to set up Dragon Dance or Substitute, as Ice Beam isn't an OHKO if Multiscale is active. Kyurem can use any Slowking to set up Substitute and can PP stall it with Roost and Protect. Swords Dance Garchomp and Dragon Dance Salamence can use Slowking to set up if they are holding Yache Berry, or if Slowking is lacking Ice Beam or Dragon Tail.</p> ",

        "name": "Special Wall",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Slack Off lets Slowking wall Keldeo, Latios, Alakazam and Reuniclus. Scald is Slowking's best offensive move option due to its ability to cripple Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and bulky Water-types. Dragon Tail lets Slowking phaze Pokemon that can try to set up on it, like Calm Mind Reuniclus and Latios. Alternatively, Ice Beam is Slowking's best option to not be setup bait for Substitute users like Dragonite, Garchomp, and Breloom while still pressuring Latios and specially defensive Gliscor. Fire Blast is mainly for Ferrothorn, which can otherwise use Slowking to stack Spikes. It also nails other Grass-types like Celebi and Breloom. However, Psyshock is an option that lets Slowking damage Water-types, especially Keldeo, Jellicent, and Tentacruel, while also hitting Terrakion and defeating Toxicroak, Amoonguss, and Breloom. Finally, Thunder Wave keeps dangerous setup sweepers like Quiver Dance Volcarona in check while crippling other fast threats like Alakazam, Latios, Keldeo, and Tornadus for Slowking's teammates. While Dragon Tail + Ice Beam is also a viable option, this combination requires specific support to work considering it leaves Slowking exploited by Water-types and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP with 180 Special Defense EVs alongside a Calm nature let Slowking avoid a 2HKO from Choice Specs Keldeo's Hydro Pump in rain after Stealth Rock and avoid an OHKO from +1 Volcarona's Bug Buzz without entry hazard damage. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 232 Def / 24 SpD with a Calm nature can be used to improve Slowking's general utility and still take Substitute Thundurus-T's Thunder while not being 2HKOed by Mamoswine's Earthquake and reducing Pursuit damage. However, this spread leaves Slowking unable to check Volcarona or Choice Specs Keldeo in rain if Stealth Rock is up. A Bold nature can also be considered because it makes it easier to take Tyranitar's Pursuit and other physical attacks from Pokemon like Gliscor, Mamoswine, and Garchomp while still being able to take on threats like Keldeo, Alakazam, and Latios.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Slowking to wall strong special attackers like Keldeo, Latios, and Alakazam, and use Slack Off as soon as its HP drops below 67% because it usually needs to be at full health to safely check those Pokemon. Spam Scald early-game to burn Pokemon that can otherwise freely switch into Slowking, like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Be smart with when you use potential coverage moves because it's the surprise factor that will make them work most of the time. If using Psyshock, Ice Beam, or Fire Blast, only reveal them when you're sure Slowking will get the KO or permanently cripple its targets. Use Dragon Tail if a Pokemon that can normally use Slowking as setup fodder enters the field, like Reuniclus, Latias, or Volcarona, and if Spikes is up, as Slowking can force a lot of switches. Avoid getting Slowking statused, since burns and poison make it easier to KO and paralysis can keep it from using Slack Off.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Slowking is vulnerable to all entry hazards, so using it alongside Rapid Spin support is a must. Because of this, its best partner is Mold Breaker Excadrill, which can also deal with Slowking's Electric-type weakness and even defeat Rotom-W. Pokemon that can switch into Rotom-W and other Electric-types like Latios, Poison Heal Breloom, Amoonguss, and Celebi are important partners. Slowking also loves to be paired with Tyranitar because it can remove Reuniclus, one of Slowking's biggest problems, while setting up sand to help it defeat rain structures and helping Slowking check Latios. Other Pursuit users like Scizor and Weavile are also usable. Slowking needs entry hazard support to be used effectively, especially Spikes, so Ferrothorn or Skarmory is strongly recomended. Other Stealth Rock users like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Heatran are also very good choices. On the offensive side, Pokemon that can help with setup sweepers that Slowking can't deal with are appreciated. Choice Specs or Choice Scarf Latios is an awesome partner because it can check Thundurus-T and cripple setup Pokemon with Trick. Choice Scarf Garchomp can check Volcarona and help against Thundurus-T and DragMag teams. Dragonite can also be used to check Volcarona and revenge kill setup sweepers with Extreme Speed, but it isn't quite as good on sand teams. Mamoswine can deal with weakened Thundurus-T and Dragon-types with Ice Shard and loves Slowking's defensive support. Magnezone can trap and remove the two most common Spikes users, Ferrothorn and Skarmory, while pressuring Excadrill if using Choice Scarf or Air Balloon.</p> "

Unown is a solid staple in any team and it will not deceive you. The ability to OHKO Toxicroak with its superior Psychic-type powers will come in handy when you have to face the troublesome rain teams that plague the current metagame. All of the OU powerhouses will, ultimately, fall to Unown's might.</p> <p>You could run a Timid nature, but Unown does not need to be fast; remember, it has the superb Hidden Power at its disposal. However, the all-powerful Unown will probably have just one chance to attack before it faints, so it may need the Speed against faster foes.</p> <p>Because Dark-types are mean to Unown and will try to Crunch its feeble body, it's generally a good idea to team it up with bullies such as Conkeldurr or Terrakion, who will gladly take the attack and answer with a brutal, well-thrown Fighting-type move. Lucario, the OU Fighting-type outcast, will gladly help Unown as well with its powerful Extreme Speed. The mean Ghost-types of OU, Gengar and Jellicent, as well as the hyped-up but less powerful Psychic-types, Alakazam and Reuniclus, may try to hit Unown with a pesky Shadow Ball; therefore it is recommended to pair Blissey or Chansey with Unown, as they will gladly take Shadow Ball. Steel-types that can deal with these opponents are also helpful, such as Skarmory and Heatran, as they are friendly towards Unown and respect it enough to protect its life and vanquish its foes. Unown will enjoy any type of support your team can give: Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes, Light Screen, Reflect, and spreading paralysis help it shine and let it do its work. In fact, it's highly recommended that you enact your support before letting Unown unleash its fury because, as they say, you'd be better safe than sorry.</p> <p>Unown might not look like the fittest member of your team, but it is a really solid Pokemon that's remained throughout the years because it's never had to change at all! Unown's great power, coverage and movepool allow it to sweep unprepared teams that are unaware of its might.</p> "

Should you choose to take the more powerful choice and try a Modest nature instead, almighty Unown can still outspeed Jolly Gyarados, Timid Heatran, Jolly Breloom and Jolly Cloyster, allowing it to utterly destroy these enemies with the Hidden Power of choice.</p> <p>There are no more options for this set, for Unown runs Hidden Power and only Hidden Power, its pride does not allow it to try other moves. It won't need any other attacks, anyway, as it's the perfect revenge killer and will just need to switch in and deal huge damage to its foe, then run away while a teammate deals with the remnants of the opposition.</p> <p>This set requires the same teammates and help as The Most Almighty Unown, so you'd better read the additional comments there to see how can you utilize the utmost power of Unown.</p> "

  "Forretress": {
    "overview": "<p>When one thinks of Forretress, one word springs to mind: utility. Forretress's role in OU is defined by its use of the semi-exclusive Rapid Spin to clear entry hazards from the field. With Rapid Spin, it extends the longevity of a wide range of Pokemon such as Dragonite and Thundurus-T. The use of Rapid Spin also acts as a line of defense against teams that heavily rely on residual damage from entry hazards. In addition, Forretress occupies a unique niche among Rapid Spin users in that it has access to all three entry hazards. This makes Forretress flexible; it can allow your Pokemon to sweep or to stall. Perhaps what sets Forretress furthest apart from other spinners is its Steel typing and high Defense, making it one of the best Pokemon to tank the powerful Outrages and other physical moves thrown around in the OU tier.</p> <p>Forretress is not without its severe disappointments. While it is the spinner that can fill the most roles on a team, it is also the easiest to spinblock. Forretress's lack of powerful offensive moves outside of Gyro Ball means OU's premier spinblockers—Jellicent and Sableye—will have no problem coming in and tanking (if you can even call it that) a hit to block Rapid Spin. While Forretress can do little back, Jellicent and Sableye will be more than happy to cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, while Gengar can wreck it with a powerful special move. The same lack of offensive presence means Forretress is setup bait for the numerous sweepers in OU. Thus, a solid plan for dealing with setup sweepers is necessary when running Forretress. Lastly, Forretress lacks any means of reliable recovery outside of Leftovers, so it is very prone to being worn down by the hazards it is designated to remove and the hits it is designated to tank. Altogether, Forretress's support can open many doors for your team, but without a solid plan for dealing with setup sweepers or spinblockers, your team itself might be opened.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Forretress can run a specially defensive spread in order to better sponge special attacks, particularly those from Dragon-types and Gengar. However, when considering that Forretress still takes over 50% from Latios's Specs Draco Meteor (non-choice special dragons often carry a move to cripple Forretress ) and that bulky Water-types can now burn Forretress with Scald, the niche that Specially Defensive Forretress had is now lost. Forretress can also run a multitude of different items effectively. Forretress can be used as a lead with Mental Herb to make it impossible to Taunt or OHKO; meanwhile, it can set up both Spikes and Stealth Rock while stopping opposing suicide leads with Rapid Spin. Red Card can be used with Sturdy to prevent Forretress from becoming setup bait, and it gives you the freedom to set up as many hazards as you want while the opponent uselessly sets up. Lastly, Shed Shell can be used to prevent Magnezone from trapping you. Note that with Volt Switch and proper prediction, Forretress can already prevent trapping from occurring.</p> <p>Forretress can play around with either its hazards or attacking options and run a couple of other moves. Explosion can be used as a last ditch effort to prevent a Pokemon from setting up and to get a teammate in unscathed. However, the power nerf to Explosion this generation makes it an unappealing option. Toxic can be used to spread status and to cripple Sableye and Jellicent who might try to spinblock Forretress.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Jellicent, Sableye, and Gengar deserve a special place among Forretress counters because they block Rapid Spin, which is Forretress's primary purpose. It should be noted that Gengar will take hefty damage from Forretress's Gyro Ball if you predict the Gengar switch-in correctly. Heatran can come in on most of Forretress's moves and wipe it off the face of the earth with its Fire-type STAB. Other Fire-types such as Volcarona and Infernape can do the same. Gothitelle and Magnezone can trap Forretress and prey on its 4x Fire weakness to OHKO with HP Fire. Gothitelle can also Trick Forretress to lock it into a move where he is extremely easy to set up on. However, Forretress with Volt Switch have a chance to escape if the trappers do not immediately use HP Fire. Ferrothorn can come in on Forretress and proceed to set up hazards of its own, baiting Forretress to spin them. In the long run, Ferrothorn will beat Forretress one-on-one with a combination of Iron Barbs and Leech Seed should the Forretress not carry Pain Split. Donphan takes little from Hidden Power Ice or Gyro Ball and can spin away all of its hazards while slowly chipping at its health with Earthquake. Gliscor can set up a Swords Dance or Substitute on Forretress and eventually force it out with repeated Earthquakes if Forretress does not have Hidden Power Ice. It can also prevent hazard setup with the use of Taunt. Thundurus-T, Garchomp, Jirachi, and Terrakion can all set up on Forretress quite easily if it lacks the proper moves to do significant damage to them. Lastly, with proper prediction, Xatu and Espeon can reflect the hazards Forretress sets up and hit back with a fatal Heat Wave or Hidden Power Fire.</p> ",

        "name": "Rapid Spin",
        "description": "<p>Forretress's placement on a team should be for one reason alone: Rapid Spin. Without Rapid Spin, other Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory are superior choices. Forretress's secondary function outside of Rapid Spinning is to tank hits, especially physical ones, for its teammates. With maximum Defense investment, Forretress becomes a handy tool to take the powerful Outrages thrown by Dragons and easily spins against opposing Pokemon that rely on weaker physical moves.</p> <p>Rapid Spin with an accompanying hazard of choice will allow Forretress to support its teammates whether it is in the endeavor of sweeping or stalling. Spikes is the more exclusive of the two entry hazards listed and is more effective in wearing down the spinblockers Forretress has to combat. However, if your team is lacking a Stealth Rock user, Stealth Rock can be used instead of Spikes. Volt Switch is perhaps the best attacking move in Forretress's arsenal; not only can it be used to escape Magnezone, but it can also be used to act as a pivot for your team. Forretress is the slowest user of Volt Switch in the game, so it can effectively tank a hit for a teammate and switch out with Volt Switch to make sure your frailer, but more offensively inclined, Pokemon can come in safely. In the last slot, Forretress can run one move to prevent becoming setup bait for certain Pokemon. Forretress's low Speed and Steel typing makes Gyro Ball its most powerful move. On the other hand, Hidden Power Ice is more effective in taking on Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Dragon-types 4x weak to Ice. However, it is a very weak move and generally misses out on Terrakion, Kyurem-B and Tyranitar in terms of coverage.</p> <p>A Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs give the most powerful Gyro Ball possible and the slowest Volt Switch possible, which enables Forretress to get a safe switch-in for another Pokemon when facing a variety of targets. If you are using Hidden Power Ice, you should use 44 Special Attack EVs with a Bold nature to 2HKO 200 HP Landorus-T after Leftovers. Another alternative EV spread has 144 Attack EVs, which can be used to OHKO Terrakion after two switches into Stealth Rock and to OHKO minimum HP Magnezone and Heatran with Earthquake. However, using 144 Attack EVs compromises so much on bulk that it's not worth using. As for other alternative moves, Toxic Spikes can be used over an attacking move or a hazard. By having two hazards on Forretress, one can choose the hazard in a battle that most appropriately fits the situation (i.e. Spikes or Toxic Spikes). It should be noted, however, that Toxic Spikes has very limited use in OU, more so than in other tiers. 27 Pokemon in OU are not affected by Toxic Spikes (29 if counting the benefits gained by Conkeldurr and Breloom with their appropriate abilities), so in many battles, they will find little use at all. Additionally, running an extra hazard over a move will compromise Forretress's ability to spin well and can make it more likely to become setup bait. Earthquake can be used over an attacking move to prevent Jirachi or Lucario from setting up on you. Earthquake also does heavy damage to Heatran and Magnezone, who would otherwise switch in freely. Pain Split lets Forretress have a semi-reliable means of recovery and mitigates the need for a Wish passer. In addition, Pain Split allows Forretress to beat Ferrothorn one-on-one, whereas otherwise Ferrothorn could win and prevent Rapid Spin with a combination of Leech Seed and Iron Barbs. In the item slot, Custap Berry can be used instead of Leftovers so Forretress can hang on with Sturdy and effectively pull off a priority Rapid Spin or a hazard of choice.</p> <p>When selecting teammates for Forretress, its tendency to become setup bait, susceptibility to spinblockers, and lack of reliable recovery should be kept in mind. Pokemon with the ability Intimidate, such as Gyarados, Salamence, and Landorus-T, are good partners because they mitigate the initial boosts of Pokemon attempting to boost their attack against Forretress. Choice Scarf users and priority users are also good teammates, because if a Pokemon sets up on Forretress while Forretress Volt Switches out, they can proceed to KO even boosted threats. Phazers also do well to prevent boosted threats from making an impact on your team if they set up on Forretress. Pokemon with powerful Pursuits make great teammates since they can remove the spinblockers that Forretress has a lot of trouble with. Tyranitar is the best because it can cover Forretress's nasty Fire-type weakness and provide Sandstorm for additional residual damage. Wish passers are great assets to Forretress because they prevent it from being worn down by the physical attackers it is supposed to tank and the hazards it is supposed to remove. Vaporeon, Blissey, and Chansey get the nod over other Wish passers due to their large HP stats and their ability to take special moves that might otherwise overwhelm Forretress.</p> "

        "name": "Custap Lead",
        "description": "<p>While Forretress is generally seen rocking a defensive set meant to provide quick entry hazards or Rapid Spin support, it can also function as an ideal lead. For teams that look to gain momentum as early as possible, Forretress can lay down some early-game entry hazards to pave the way for a sweep later on. While Forretress does not seem like a very functional lead due to its low Speed, the secret to its success lies in the Custap Berry. With a Custap Berry and Sturdy, Forretress can generally stack at least two layers of entry hazards, which is very helpful for most teams when trying to dent the opponent.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is nearly mandatory on any dedicated lead for good reason—it ensures that opposing threats, such as Volcarona, Salamence, and Dragonite, must think twice before entering the battlefield. Spikes is generally the preferred choice for the second moveslot because it helps wear down grounded Pokemon, weakening walls for end-game sweeps. However, some prefer Toxic Spikes to cut down the durability of opposing Pokemon, though Spikes is generally the better choice in this metagame due to the plethora of Rapid Spin users, Steel-type Pokemon, and Poison-type Pokemon.</p> <p>Explosion comes in handy for when Forretress reaches low health. With a Custap Berry, Explosion will hit the opponent before Forretress takes damage (unless attacked by a priority move). Explosion allows Forretress to spinblock and keep its entry hazards on the field; additionally, it forces the opponent into an unfavorable matchup once Forretress goes down. Rapid Spin is a good option for Forretress's final moveslot because it allows Forretress to disregard opposing Pokemon that try and stack entry hazards and gives Forretress a free Rapid Spin when Custap Berry activates. Gyro Ball also works in the final slot because it prevents opposing setups and does a bit of damage without having to actually sacrifice Forretress.</p> <p>Forretress's EVs are tailored to give it as much Attack as possible to bolster the firepower of its Explosion and Gyro Ball. Maximum Defense investment plays to Forretress's strength and allows it to lay entry hazards against the Pokemon it would normally check. The IVs used might appear to be strange, but they have a special purpose—18 Special Defense IVs ensure that Forretress survives a Scald in the rain from an opposing defensive Politoed, even with a turn of burn damage; a majority of the time, Scald will put Forretress into Custap Berry activation range.</p> <p>As far as other moves go, Forretress can use Toxic in order to poison a key Pokemon early on, but Toxic generally won't see much use. Volt Switch is also worth looking at for its utility in gaining momentum; however, it also won't see much use due to Forretress's niche as a suicide lead. It does help against teams with Taunt or Magic Bounce users, but aside from that, it won't be of much use.</p> <p>In terms of teammates, lead Forretress thrives as a lead for offensive teams that look to lay hazards early and sweep later on. Useful teammates include Ghost-types to spinblock if need be. A prime example of a teammate for an offensive team that can spinblock is Gengar; a Choice Scarf variant can outpace and KO nearly any spinner that threatens to rid the field of hazards, and while it can't switch into many attacks, it can come in on a well-predicted Rapid Spin. Forretress needs to have a Pokemon that can quickly take down Espeon and Xatu in order to successfully lay hazards without any obstructions; for this reason, Weavile, Tyranitar, and Scizor work very well. They all pack Pursuit and can shorten the lifespan of Magic Bounce users, allowing Forretress to set up its entry hazards, which help a teammate's sweep, without leaving stray hazards on your own side of the field. Getting rid of Taunt users should be a priority as well, but they do not hamper Forretress as much as Magic Bounce users.</p> <p>When considering offensive teammates that can take advantage of the entry hazards Forretress brings, just about any Pokemon that can clean up in the late-game will do the trick. SubSalac Terrakion, Double Dance Thundurus-T, Choice Scarf Keldeo, Choice Scarf Jirachi, Swords Dance Breloom, Quiver Dance Volcarona, Dragon Dance Salamence...the list goes on and on! In fact, you'll be hard-pressed to find an offensive Pokemon that does not fit well with lead Forretress.</p> "

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Scizor is a Pokemon that almost has it all, and it's hence no wonder that it's one of the best Pokemon in OU. Thanks to its excellent Attack stat and Technician ability, Scizor is the strongest priority user in OU and can pick off many menacing offensive threats such as Kyurem-B, Dragonite, Terrakion, and Salamence. Scizor also gets STAB U-turn, to hit everything that doesn't resist it hard while keeping momentum in its team's favor. Furthermore, Scizor has good coverage moves such as Superpower and Acrobatics, allowing it to hit Pokemon that resist its STAB moves for at least neutral damage and making the task of countering it much more difficult. Pursuit allows Scizor to take out many of the Psychic- and Ghost-types that it scares away, such as Latios, Latias, and Gengar, shielding many teams that have problems with those threats. Swords Dance only adds to its offensive potential, transforming it from a revenge killer and heavy-hitter into a deadly late-game sweeper that can KO many offensive Pokemon with just a +2 Bullet Punch. To top it off, Scizor has an excellent defensive typing that leaves it with only one weakness and multiple useful resistances, has instant recovery in Roost, and can invest in HP to become very bulky thanks to Bullet Punch mitigating its Speed issues. All these traits combine to make it not only an offensive asset, but also a defensive one.</p> <p>Scizor does have its downsides though. While it might only have one weakness, it is a very exploitable quadruple weakness to Fire. This means that even uninvested Hidden Power Fire from Pokemon with good Special Attack such as Latias and Celebi will OHKO, or at least come close. Scizor's priority, while strong, has a bad offensive typing as it is resisted by the ubiquitous Water-types and therefore by a big portion of rain teams. Further consider that Scizor is neutral to Water moves—which are boosted in rain—and has mediocre special bulk, and it's no wonder that Scizor gets OHKOed by many offensive Water-types, such as Starmie, Keldeo, and Choice Specs Politoed. Keldeo itself, another top-tier threat in OU, gives Scizor a very hard time as it resists Scizor's most-used moves, Bullet Punch and U-turn, and can obliterate it with powerful Water attacks. Finally, Scizor's choiced sets are easy to wall with physically bulky Pokemon such as Skarmory, Forretress, Jellicent, and Landorus-T, and it often gives those Pokemon chances to harass Scizor's team with entry hazards or status.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The combination of Wacan Berry and Natural Gift provides Scizor with a one-time use 90 Base Power Electric-type attack, which is useful for all the bulky Water-types and Skarmory that like to switch into Scizor. However, it's mostly outclassed by Acrobatics, which already OHKOes most Water-types at +2 and can be used multiple times, unlike Natural Gift. Night Slash and Pursuit can be used on any of the Swords Dance sets if Jellicent is a big problem for Scizor's team, but that's the extent of their usefulness. Pursuit has the added benefit of trapping potentially annoying Pokemon and has only 10 less Base Power than Night Slash thanks to Technician. Brick Break is an option for the offensive Swords Dance set if one detests the stat drops that Superpower causes, but Superpower is still stronger even at -1, which usually makes it the better option. Also, Brick Break fails to do any significant damage to Skarmory, which can phaze Scizor effortlessly. Occa Berry can be used to lure and KO Pokemon that depend on Hidden Power Fire to OHKO Scizor, such as Latios, Latias, Magnezone, Alakazam, and Gengar. Lum Berry can fit on the offensive Swords Dance set to set up more easily on Pokemon such as defensive Politoed and Jellicent, but Scizor needs to forfeit Acrobatics and use Bug Bite, which means it then fails to OHKO some of the bulky Water-types that Lum Berry helps it set up on, making it often counterproductive.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Physically defensive Skarmory is probably the best Scizor check in OU. It fully counters any set aside from the offensive Swords Dance set, against which it is a very good check as it takes only ~50% from +2 Superpower and can then phaze Scizor with Whirlwind. Jellicent, Tentacruel in rain, and Landorus-T are the next best answers to Scizor. They counter any set without Swords Dance, while Tentacruel and Landorus-T can check the offensive Swords Dance set too, as both are faster and can revenge kill a weakened Scizor. Jellicent and Tentacruel can also beat bulky Swords Dance Scizor too, as it can't hurt them fast enough to avoid getting burned.</p> <p>Keldeo and Gyarados are the best offensive checks to Scizor, easily taking everything except Acrobatics and denting or OHKOing it back with rain-boosted Water-type attacks. Offensive Heatran is in a similar boat, but fears Superpower instead, while defensive Heatran can act as a secondary Choice Band Scizor switch-in and a bulky Swords Dance Scizor counter. Forretress walls any non-boosting set but is setup fodder for any boosting set and is a big momentum loser if Scizor goes for U-turn, making it a mediocre Scizor check. Timid Magnezone outspeeds and OHKOes any Scizor set that doesn't utilize a Jolly nature or Choice Scarf, and can safely switch into anything except for Superpower. Speedy Rotom-W is a good check to Swords Dance sets, as it can either neutralize Scizor with Will-O-Wisp or just OHKO with Hidden Power Fire, but it is unable to switch into boosted Bug-type attacks. Lastly, any strong Water-type will be able to put a big dent in Scizor, especially if rain is up, while not caring about even +2 Bullet Punch, which means that Pokemon such as Starmie and Choice Scarf Politoed are good revenge killers to use against Scizor.</p> <p>As for team types, rain and sun teams tend to fare well against Scizor. Rain teams are filled with Water-type Pokemon that can either outspeed and OHKO Scizor (offensive Water-types such as Starmie, Keldeo, and Gyarados) or take a hit and then cripple Scizor in return (bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Tentacruel), while sun teams similarly are full of Pokemon with Fire-type attacks and have multiple checks to Scizor's most-used moves (U-turn and Bullet Punch), such as Ninetales, Heatran, Volcarona, and Landorus-T.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>This has been Scizor's flagship set since the Platinum era for good reason. Scizor is one of the few Pokemon that can actually do serious damage with U-turn, which is why it is used not only as a scouting tool but as a strong spammable attack that does a lot of damage to anything that doesn't resist it, and even to some that do. U-turn also combines nicely with Scizor's great typing and bulk to make it a very useful pivot, which uses its low Speed to bring in teammates safely against faster opponents or forced switches. Bullet Punch is Scizor's revenge killing weapon; by shaving off a huge amount of health from all offensive Pokemon that don't resist it, it makes Scizor a great check to Pokemon such as Latios and Terrakion. Superpower hits Steel-types that resist Scizor's STAB moves for at least neutral damage and OHKOes some of them, namely Magnezone and Heatran. Superpower is also Scizor's best option against Keldeo, dealing ~79% damage. Pursuit prevents Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Latios, Latias, Gengar, and Celebi (that lack Baton Pass) from switching out, often putting them in a checkmate position, as Scizor is a good switch-in to all of those Pokemon. If Pursuit's trapping abilities are not needed, Quick Attack is a fine alternative that helps Scizor revenge kill offensive Pokemon that resist Bullet Punch, such as Gyarados, Keldeo, Thundurus-T, and Volcarona. To illustrate its power, Quick Attack KOes offensive Volcarona after Stealth Rock 87.5% of the time.</p> <p>Scizor's HP EVs minimize Stealth Rock damage and the 8 leftover EVs go to Special Defense because Scizor switches into special attacks more often than it does physical ones. Bug Bite can be used in the last slot for a strong Bug STAB move that doesn't force it out, making dealing with Pokemon such as Reuniclus and SubCM Jirachi much easier, but its use ends there. Night Slash is useful to catch Jellicent on the switch, 2HKOing even the most physically bulky sets, but Jellicent usually invests enough Speed EVs to outrun uninvested Scizor sets, so Scizor would have to sacrifice a lot of bulk to make sure it will outspeed Jellicent. If Scizor's team lacks a solid switch-in to Choice Specs Latios, an EV spread of 248 HP / 92 Atk / 168 SpD with an Adamant nature can be used, allowing Scizor to always avoid the 2HKO from Draco Meteor even with Stealth Rock in play and eliminate Latios with Pursuit. This spread also makes Scizor a much safer switch-in to Alakazam, Latias, and Gengar, especially if used in rain, where these Pokemon cannot OHKO Scizor with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>Scizor greatly appreciates Rapid Spin support, as U-turn is the move it will be using most of the time. Offensive Analytic Starmie pairs well with Scizor, as not only it is able to beat both OU spinblockers, Jellicent and Gengar, it can also beat most Pokemon that give Scizor trouble, such as Skarmory, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, Gliscor, Jellicent, Keldeo, Gyarados, and Tentacruel. Scizor returns the favor by doing huge amounts of damage to Blissey, Chansey, Celebi, and Ferrothorn, paving the way for Starmie to clean up. They also share wonderful defensive synergy, with Starmie resisting Scizor's lone weakness and Scizor resisting three of Starmie's weaknesses: Grass, Dark, and Ghost. Tentacruel is another Rapid Spinner that has very good synergy with Scizor on rain teams. Similarly to Starmie, Tentacruel can beat all the Ghost-types in OU with a SubToxic set, ensuring the removal of hazards. It also checks many of the Pokemon that stand in the way of Scizor, such as Keldeo, Heatran, and Skarmory.</p> <p>As one of the best U-turn users in OU, Scizor also finds itself a home in VoltTurn chains. A teammate to take on Water and Fire attacks is also a necessity, as Scizor struggles against Water-types, Drizzle-boosted Water attacks, and any Fire attack in general. For these reasons, partners such as Rotom-W, Thundurus-T, and Celebi are very beneficial for Scizor. They are able to beat not only bulky Water- and Ground-types that annoy Scizor, but Skarmory too, and also have U-turn or Volt Switch to continue the chain. Rotom-W is the best of these, as aside from the aforementioned advantages, it can also easily switch into Water- and Fire-type attacks aimed at Scizor. Finally, Latios and Latias can both beat the Pokemon that trouble Scizor and can tank Fire and Water attacks.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>With access to Swords Dance and Bullet Punch, the Technician ability, a base 130 Attack stat, and a ton of setup chances, it's no wonder why Scizor is one of the best physical sweepers around. Thanks to Bullet Punch, Scizor can mitigate its low Speed and OHKO many faster offensive Pokemon that don't resist Bullet Punch at +2, such as Terrakion, Latios, Salamence, and Dragonite (with all bar Terrakion requiring prior Stealth Rock damage). Acrobatics, when backed up by a Swords Dance boost and Flying Gem, becomes a very powerful move capable of taking out several of Scizor's usual checks and is strong enough to be useful even after Flying Gem has been consumed. Namely, at +2 and after Stealth Rock damage, it OHKOes Jellicent, Tentacruel, and Gyarados, while also dealing a minimum of 70% damage to Offensive Pivot Landorus-T after Intimidate. Superpower handles the Pokemon that resist the combination of Acrobatics and Bullet Punch, such as Heatran, Magnezone, Skarmory, and Rotom-W, and provides perfect neutral coverage in OU when combined with Acrobatics with the exception of Thundurus-T.</p> <p>A Jolly nature enables Scizor to outspeed Adamant Breloom, Timid Magnezone, and uninvested Celebi and Jirachi that might carry Hidden Power Fire, so it's a viable alternative over Adamant. If one prefers more power in Scizor's Bullet Punch, Life Orb and Metal Coat are both excellent choices to use over Flying Gem. Life Orb is better used with Spikes and Stealth Rock support, as one layer of Spikes combined with Stealth Rock allows +2 Bullet Punch to OHKO Jolteon, Garchomp, any Volcarona, and KO 252 HP Latias 75% of the time. Metal Coat makes Bullet Punch strong enough to get the OHKO on offensive Latias after a Swords Dance boost and Stealth Rock damage. Both items should be used with Bug Bite over Acrobatics, as the latter works only with one-time-use items. Although resisted by many of Scizor's checks, Bug Bite has a constant and reliable 135 Base Power after STAB; with a Life Orb boost, it hits neutral targets harder than Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics does. For example, it deals much more damage to Hippowdon, Rotom-W, and Vaporeon, and greatly helps teams that are weak to Reuniclus, easily OHKOing offensive sets and 2HKOing Calm Mind variants.</p> <p>This set loves Stealth Rock support. For example, after a boost and with Stealth Rock up, Scizor can OHKO Jellicent with Acrobatics and Latios and Salamence with Bullet Punch. Lead Tyranitar is an excellent partner to set up Stealth Rock, as it not only lures and weakens Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Landorus-T for Scizor to sweep, but it also sets up a sandstorm to help bring many offensive Pokemon into Bullet Punch's OHKO range. Stealth Rock Garchomp is also a good Pokemon to pair with this Scizor, as it is able to weaken the aforementioned Pokemon and can easily switch into and threaten to OHKO Heatran, a very good Scizor check. Specially defensive Celebi checks all the Water-types that threaten Scizor and is a reliable Stealth Rock setter as well.</p> <p>Physical sweepers with similar counters are the best offensive partners for Scizor. This way, Scizor can either weaken the opposing team for another sweeper to clean up, or the partnered physical sweeper can do the softening up and Scizor the cleaning. Lucario is one of the best physical sweepers to pair with Scizor, as Scizor lures and eliminates almost every Pokemon that hinders Lucario's sweep, such as Landorus-T, Jellicent, Tentacruel, and Gyarados. Offensive Gyarados is another physical sweeper that benefits from the absence of bulky Water-types such as Tentacruel and Jellicent. It has very good defensive synergy with Scizor too, as it is able to check most Fire-types that threaten Scizor while Scizor can deal with Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Celebi. Rotom-W is always a nice teammate and can attract Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Celebi for Scizor to set up on, safely bringing Scizor in with Volt Switch. Any Keldeo variant works well with this Scizor, which is adept at taking out bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Tentacruel, making it much easier for Keldeo to sweep the opposing team. In addition, Keldeo beats every Pokemon that Scizor can't OHKO at +2, with the exceptions of bulky Water-types, which Scizor can take out on its own anyway.</p> "

        "description": "<p>What this set lacks in power, it makes up for with its strong defensive presence, which gives it much more setup chances than the offensive Swords Dance set and allows it to be a mix of a sweeper and a check to all the offensive Psychic- and Ghost-types of OU. With this EV spread, Scizor fully counters any Gengar and Alakazam without Life Orb and Hidden Power Fire even with Stealth Rock up, and can even counter Life Orb version of those two as long as Stealth Rock is off the field. It is also a fantastic counter to any Calm Mind Jirachi and a great check to Latios and Latias, as unlike the Choice Band set it isn't 2HKOed by Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor and has reliable recovery to stay healthy. In general, this set aims to switch in against the Pokemon it checks and stay healthy with Roost in the early-game, then later go for a sweep if possible.</p> <p>Swords Dance gives Scizor the power it needs to become threatening and clean up weakened teams. Bullet Punch deals with anything faster that can threaten Scizor, and even without a lot of Attack investment or a boosting item, it still hits pretty hard after a boost, OHKOing Latios after two Stealth Rock rounds and Breloom with Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes up. Bullet Punch is Scizor's classic revenge killing tool for any dangerous offensive threat, although it's not so powerful on this set and can only be used to pick off very weakened Pokemon, unless they are weak to it, such as Terrakion and Mamoswine. Bug Bite is Scizor's source of power against slower Pokemon and the Psychic-types it walls. U-turn is a good alternative Bug move for Scizor, despite its seemingly bad synergy with Swords Dance at first glance. U-turn enables Scizor to keep momentum early- and mid-game while also avoiding one of this set's biggest enemies, Magnezone. While Scizor will have a harder time sweeping late-game without Bug Bite, it can still pull it off as Bullet Punch often will be enough to clean up offensive teams. Finally, Roost is what makes this set work, by giving Scizor the durability it needs to check the Pokemon it is supposed to and attempt a sweep whenever the circumstances allow it.</p> <p>Leftovers is the best option for this set, as it allows Scizor to avoid the 2HKO from Gengar and Alakazam's Focus Blast after Stealth Rock damage and increases its overall tanking ability. However, if one wants Scizor to have a better chance at sweeping and a stronger revenge killing tool, Iron Plate is a great option that allows Scizor to OHKO Latios, Dragonite, and Salamence with +2 Bullet Punch, and offensive Volcarona with the help of Stealth Rock, and Breloom without it. Iron Plate also allows Scizor to fake a Choice Scarf set early-game if used in conjunction with U-turn. An EV spread of 156 HP / 252 Atk / 100 Spe Adamant can be used to outspeed slow Pokemon such as specially defensive Heatran, defensive Politoed, and Vaporeon, so Scizor can hit them first and possibly OHKO them while retaining some bulk.</p> <p>Rain support enhances this set's performance to great levels. Under rain, Scizor doesn't have to worry about a surprise Hidden Power Fire from Latios, Latias, Celebi, Gengar, or Alakazam, and can even avoid the 2HKO from some of these if they have no boosting item. It also means that non-Choice Specs variants of Magnezone can no longer 2HKO Scizor, so Scizor can either U-turn out or start boosting in Magnezone's face if it lacks Charge Beam. Tentacruel is an excellent teammate for Scizor, as this particular set gives free switch-ins to Skarmory and Heatran, which can set up entry hazards and hinder Scizor's team. Tentacruel can easily switch into both Heatran and Skarmory, while also acting as a good check to Water-types that Scizor fears, such as Keldeo and Politoed. Specially defensive Celebi counters most Water-types that give Scizor trouble and can also set up Stealth Rock to help Scizor sweep late-game. Rain Volcarona with Hidden Power Water can lure and weaken many of the Pokemon that prevent Scizor from sweeping, such as Skarmory, Tentacruel, non-Choice Scarf Keldeo, Heatran, and Jellicent, and therefore makes for a fantastic offensive partner. Rotom-W, Latios, and Latias all check Water-types pretty well and have great defensive synergy with Scizor, while Rotom-W also has Volt Switch to complement Scizor's U-turn.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>This set performs a role reminiscent to that of Choice Scarf Tyranitar: its aim is to deal damage to threats, and possibly trap and kill them, before taking damage itself. Because of its low Speed, it is limited to revenge killing threats at and below the base 120 mark, which fortunately is enough to outrun and kill Alakazam. Specifically, Scizor's main targets include fast Psychic- and Ghost-types, the latter of which can be exploited by U-turn, while both fall to Pursuit if they choose to flee. Keep in mind that this is a very specialized set that should only be used on teams that need a fast way to dispose of Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, Starmie, and Alakazam without losing momentum.</p> <p>Outside of these threats, Scizor can simply choose to spam its STAB U-turn to scout and deal decent damage to nearly anything that switches in. Bullet Punch is still useful without a power boost, but is significantly weaker than on other sets and should only be used in desperate situations. Iron Head can be used for more power in this case, but it lacks the valuable priority Bullet Punch offers. Finally, Superpower is used to surprise and KO Steel-type counters, such as Magnezone, Heatran, and Lucario, and for greater coverage in general. Bug Bite can be used instead to deal greater damage to Psychic-types that choose to stay in, though U-turn and Pursuit are usually enough to do the job anyway.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is absolutely required on this set, as Adamant Scizor is unable to outrun even Espeon and Latios. Maximum Speed lets Scizor tie with opposing Choice Scarf Scizor. Another attack to consider for this set is Aerial Ace, which nails Volcarona, Infernape, Breloom, and Keldeo, but otherwise compromises coverage.</p> <p>Since this Scizor can instantly trap and kill the likes of Gengar, Latias, Latios, Starmie, and Alakazam, Pokemon that benefit from their removal absolutely love being paired with it. Hyper offensive teams that use dual hazard suicide leads such as Skarmory and Forretress and Gengar as their spinblocker appreciate Scizor's ability to trap and KO Starmie, which could otherwise get past Gengar. Calm Mind Keldeo, Swords Dance Lucario, Mienshao, and Terrakion are just a few examples of sweepers that could work on such teams, and additionally, they are all decent stallbreakers that can break through walls that Choice Scarf Scizor can't dent.</p> <p>This set also requires Stealth Rock support to work effectively, as Pursuit isn't enough to even KO certain fleeing Pokemon; Latios, for instance, only goes down to Pursuit after two Stealth Rock switch-ins. Tyranitar and Hippowdon are good Stealth Rock users to pair with Choice Scarf Scizor, as the sandstorm they induce helps bring down the Pokemon that Scizor needs to check to KO range. Furthermore, other revenge killers in the form of Focus Sash users, priority users, or other Choice Scarf Pokemon are necessary, as this Scizor is easily set up on by many Pokemon. Focus Sash Alakazam, Mamoswine, and Breloom are all excellent choices depending on your team.</p> "

        "name": "Trapper",
        "description": "<p>Because of its typing and movepool, Scizor is naturally able to switch in and take on the Psychic- and Ghost-type threats of OU. This set capitalizes on this very aspect, and is designed specifically to allow Scizor to switch in and eliminate them from play easily. Although the Choice Band set does this job as well, using Life Orb instead means Scizor won't become setup bait for dangerous sweepers that would normally take advantage of it being locked into Pursuit. The heavy investment in special bulk, in combination with Roost, also makes Scizor surprisingly durable by allowing it to tank and recover from Psyshock, Psychic, Draco Meteor, Shadow Ball, and other coverage moves repeatedly. Keep in mind, however, that this set lacks the overall power and coverage of the Choice Band set, so use this set only if your team desperately need threats such as Alakazam, Latios, Latias, Espeon, and Gengar out of the way. Outside of its trapping role, Scizor still does its usual duties with Bullet Punch, a reasonably strong priority that picks off weakened threats, and U-turn, which helps maintain offensive momentum and compensate for Scizor's lack of coverage.</p> <p>The EV spread is highly specialized; 112 EVs in Attack, along with an Adamant nature, allow Scizor to OHKO a fleeing Latios after Stealth Rock damage with Pursuit, and Gengar with Bullet Punch after Stealth Rock damage, Substitute, and two rounds of Leftovers. The rest of the EVs are put into HP and Special Defense, as most of the threats Scizor traps are usually specially oriented. You can also consider a much bulkier spread along with Leftovers to switch in more easily on the likes of Gengar and Latios; 248 HP / 28 Atk / 236 SpD avoids 2HKOs from Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor and Life Orb Gengar's Focus Blast most of the time.</p> <p>Life Orb is an essential item to this set; however, there are notable alternatives if the recoil from Life Orb is undesirable. Boosting items include Dark Gem, which boosts the power of Pursuit only, and Expert Belt, which boosts the power of super effective hits. Occa Berry is also viable, as it saves Scizor from otherwise fatal KOs from the reasonably common Hidden Power Fire. Be wary that these items further decrease Scizor's physical power, lowering its utility against threats outside of Pursuit targets.</p> <p>If it wasn't apparent enough already, this Scizor is designed to pair well with Pokemon that appreciate the removal of fast Psychic- and Ghost-types. Examples of Pokemon that benefit from this include Terrakion and Keldeo, both of which are easily stopped by Latias, Latios, and Alakazam, and Lucario, which has trouble beating Gengar without using Bullet Punch. If Scizor isn't holding an Occa Berry, Politoed is a good teammate, as the rain it summons lowers the power of Fire-type moves aimed at Scizor, which is extremely helpful if Latios, Gengar, and other Pursuit targets happen to carry Hidden Power Fire, so Scizor can tank and trap them if needed. This set is also walled by Steel-types due to the lack of Superpower, giving Pokemon such as Skarmory, Jirachi, Heatran, and Ferrothorn opportunities to set up. Your own Heatran can deal with these threats with its Fire-type STAB and Earth Power while Magnezone can trap most of them thanks to Magnet Pull. Rotom-W is also a decent counter to many of them, and also completes the VoltTurn combo with Scizor. Preferably, it should have Hidden Power Fire to lure in and beat Ferrothorn, and should invest in bulk to take the common Fire- and rain-boosted Water-type attacks aimed at Scizor.</p> "

  "Skarmory": {
    "overview": "<p>Skarmory takes flight once more to block almost every physical hit thrown at it. Steel / Flying is an awesome type combination that only has two crippling weaknesses, while Sturdy has received a nice buff that allows Skarmory to take an otherwise fatal hit if it's at full health. Finally, no other wall packs a recovery move, access to Spikes and Stealth Rock, a phazing move, and a unique typing like Skarmory. The metagame may have slowly geared itself towards special attackers, such as Reuniclus, and some physical attackers have acquired new ways to get around Skarmory, but Skarmory still gets the job done.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock can replace Spikes on the defensive sets if you want Skarmory to set up as quickly as possible. Drill Peck can replace Brave Bird if the recoil turns you off. Toxic helps Skarmory eliminate threats and works well against certain Pokemon, such as Politoed, and Jellicent switch-ins. Rocky Helmet deserves a special mention because it can easily punish Pokemon like Scizor using U-turn or Outrage users. Don't bother with any stat-up moves; Skarmory is already vulnerable to Taunt and lacks the movepool to use them effectively anyway.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Magnezone is the textbook definition of a counter to Skarmory. It traps Skarmory with Magnet Pull, uses STAB Electric-type attacks to OHKO Skarmory, and resists every usable attack in Skarmory's movepool. Outside of Shed Shell, the only chance Skarmory has against Magnezone is Whirlwinding if Sturdy is active.</p> <p>Zapdos is immune to Spikes, packs STAB Thunderbolt, can heal itself with Roost, and can even counter-phaze if necessary with Roar. All of the Rotom formes have Will-O-Wisp and STAB Thunderbolt going against Skarmory and avoid passive damage from Spikes thanks to Levitate. Politoed changes the weather and attacks with powerful neutral Water-type attacks. Fire-types hate entry hazards in general but counter Skarmory very well. Heatran hates Spikes, but it can shut down the process with Taunt and singe the metal birdie with STAB Fire Blast. Ninetales doesn't get Taunt but, it will scare it away just as quickly and can spread burns with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Another way to deal with Skarmory is to just get rid of its entry hazards. Starmie can use Rapid Spin to blow away Skarmory's entry hazards, use Recover to shrug off Brave Birds, and threaten Skarmory with Thunderbolt or its Water-type move of choice. Forretress can exploit Skarmory to lay hazards of its own, and it can also use Rapid Spin. Tentacruel does the same thing. Espeon and Xatu might not like taking Brave Birds, but they can reflect Spikes back with their Magic Bounce ability.</p> <p>Since Skarmory is a defensive Pokemon, it's hard to directly counter it because it will only come out of the nest when it knows it's safe. This makes the concept of luring vital to getting through Skarmory. For example, a stat-booster like Gyarados or Gliscor can use Taunt to beat Skarmory when they would otherwise be walled. Scizor can use Swords Dance and Superpower on an unsuspecting Skarmory. Jirachi can use Thunderbolt in a similar fashion. Pokemon like Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Salamence can use Fire Blast to surprise it. Generally, you want to attack its weaker Special Defense with an Electric- or Fire-type move.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Tried and true, this still stands as Skarmory's best set. After Skarmory makes its presence known on the battlefield, the opponent will likely run away in fear of the metal bird's superb Defense. Skarmory should first lay Spikes to force the opponent to make a rather painful decision when switching in and out of the battlefield. Roost can wear out Life Orb users, such as Metagross and Gyarados, while keeping Skarmory in shape for the next assault. Whirlwind is great for either phazing Pokemon such as Bulk Up Conkeldurr or merely shuffling for extra entry hazard damage. Brave Bird ties it all together by giving Skarmory a high Base Power STAB move that handles threats nicely, especially Fighting-types such as Breloom and Toxicroak. If you're deathly afraid of being set up on by Wobbuffet or want to prevent other Pokemon from setting up, Taunt may be a superior choice over Brave Bird.</p> <p>224 HP EVs allows Skarmory to regain Sturdy after switching into Stealth Rock and receiving two layers of Leftovers recovery. 252 Defense EVs maximizes Skarmory's physical walling prowess, while 32 Special Defense EVs help Skarmory withstand some resisted Special Attacks. Leftovers is the preferred item to give Skarmory recovery on the side while keeping it closer to full health. If being trapped by Magnezone is an issue, Shed Shell can ensure that Skarmory can escape from such a dangerous situation.</p> <p>The pink blobs, Blissey and Chansey, make great partners for Skarmory; they take special attacks comfortably and can cripple foes with Toxic or Thunder Wave. Having access to Aromatherapy helps in situations when Skarmory got burned. Wish can help Skarmory stay at full health at all times, which can be very annoying with Sturdy guaranteeing opponents a 2HKO at best each time. While Jellicent does attract Electric-type moves, it's a great partner to have thanks to its awesome typing; it takes on Fire-types such as Heatran and Infernape nicely while using Will-O-Wisp to help Skarmory take on physical threats better. Gliscor is a cool partner since it can switch into most Fighting-types with relative ease. Provided that another Pokemon sets up Spikes, Skarmory can opt to use both Brave Bird and Taunt. Additional indirect damage from Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes, or sandstorm works great alongside Spikes.</p> "

        "description": "<p>The banning of Deoxys-D brought a dearth of effective leads that can set Stealth Rock and Spikes quickly and reliably. Enter Custap Lead Skarmory: the second-fastest Pokemon allowed in OU that gets access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes, bested only by Smeargle. With a maximum Speed of 262, Skarmory can outrun many common leads, and even without much investment in Defense Skarmory still has respectable physical bulk, allowing it to comfortably tank physical blows as it sets entry hazards up. Even if the opponent should happen to lead with a specially-based Pokemon, the combination of Sturdy and Custap Berry nearly guarantees that Skarmory will get Stealth Rock and at least one layer of Spikes up. This combination of traits are also its main draw for use as an entry hazard-setting lead over the slightly faster Smeargle, which has to rely on Focus Sash to take a hit, robbing it of the benefits brought about by Custap Berry.</p> <p>This Skarmory works similarly to Deoxys-D and other suicide leads: it aims to set up Stealth Rock and as many layers of Spikes as possible before fainting. The other two moves help Skarmory's situation versus opposing leads. Brave Bird prevents Skarmory from being complete Taunt bait while acting as a means by which Skarmory can KO itself from 1 HP so an opposing spinner can't spin away Skarmory's entry hazards. Taunt stops slower leads from setting up entry hazards while giving Skarmory a 50% chance of preventing any opposing Breloom from using Spore on it due to a Speed tie.</p> <p>The given EVs and nature maximize Skarmory's Speed and the power of Brave Bird, with the last four EVs placed in Defense. However, if Whirlwind is used over Brave Bird, then the Attack EVs can be moved to HP, bolstering Skarmory's overall bulk. The option of minimizing Skarmory's HP, Defense, and Special Defense IVs is available if one wants to activate Skarmory's Custap Berry more quickly, but keep in mind that this is not advised as even resisted special attacks, such as Alakazam's Psychic, would then 2HKO Skarmory without activating the Custap Berry.</p> <p>Whirlwind is a mostly inferior option that can be used to phaze out setup sweepers, but Brave Bird and Taunt tend to cover what Whirlwind would be useful for. Tailwind can be used when Skarmory is about to faint to speed up its teammates for four turns. Endure can also be used over Brave Bird, as Skarmory isn't always guaranteed to be knocked into Custap Berry's activation range. While it may seem contrary to use any other item on a set named \"Custap Lead,\" Mental Herb can be used over Custap Berry to negate one use of Taunt, allowing Skarmory to set up entry hazards without worry for a couple of turns.</p> <p>Problem Pokemon for Skarmory include the two Magic Bouncers, which render Skarmory useless, the five spinners in OU, which can easily negate Skarmory's work, and opposing lead Terrakion and Sableye, both of which can Taunt Skarmory before it can retaliate. Pokemon with Trick are also a problem as they rob Skarmory of its valuable Custap Berry. While practically any offensive Pokemon can work with Skarmory, those that can eliminate the aforementioned Pokemon make for especially great teammates. Gengar in particular is a highly recommended teammate as it is the most offensive spinblocker available. Alternatively, Magnezone can be used to trap and kill the spinners directly.</p> "

  "Kingdra": {
    "overview": "<p>While Kingdra has taken quite a few steps back in BW with the Drizzle + Swift Swim ban, it still remains a potent threat due to its ability to counter rain teams. With rain-boosted Water-type moves and Swift Swim in hand, Kingdra can outspeed and decimate opposing rain teams by turning Politoed into a massive liability. Rain teams are often stuck with the difficult choice of cutting off a major source of their power by refraining from bringing out Politoed early or risking getting destroyed by Kingdra. Despite being an absolutely terror for rain teams, it isn't seen as much as one might expect because it competes with the many other OU Dragon-types for a spot on a team. It has a hard counter in the extremely common Ferrothorn and it is somewhat weak without rain support. It has a useful quadruple resistance to Fire and Water, which makes it a handy check to both powerful sun threats such as Victini and rain threats such as Keldeo and Choice Specs Politoed. One should also not discount its bulk, as Kingdra can take common attacks, such as Terrakion's Close Combat, quite nicely. Overall, while Kingdra isn't the best Pokemon in the world, it stands tall as the ultimate counter to rain teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Kingdra can run quite a few more sets, but none are as effective as any of the ones listed. A mixed Rain Dance set is viable, but a rain-boosted Waterfall isn't what it used to be in a metagame filled with physically bulky Steel-types and Water-immune Pokemon. The main draw would be to beat special walls, but mixed Kingdra can't even beat Chansey; all you would really gain is a weaker Hydro Pump. A mono-attacking set with Outrage as the attack could work in a similar vein to CroCune, but it also has trouble sweeping, and being asleep, even with Sleep Talk, is undesirable with BW's sleep mechanics. Additionally, having one's only attack being Outrage is undesirable. A Double Dance set with both Dragon Dance and Rain Dance is yet another set that seems great on paper, as it theoretically allows Kingdra to use whichever setup move is best for the situation. However, there is really no need for that, as both Rain Dance and Dragon Dance are amazing tools and don't need to be used in tandem; rather, you're just wasting a moveslot. You can run a Dragon Dance Kingdra set with Disable and Protect or Substitute over conventional moves, with Outrage as the sole attack. Disable would prevent foes from 2HKOing Kingdra with a move if it is their only move to hit Kingdra, provided Kingdra is slower, but it's not worth being left with Outrage as Kingdra's only attack, and Protect or Substitute is needed to sweep.</p> <p>Bounce might seem a usable move to spread paralysis, but it provides no additional coverage and is really better used by Gyarados, as Kingdra lacks the STAB to make good use out of it. Sniper can be used over Swift Swim on any of the sets other than Rain Dance if you want to use permanent rain to boost Kingdra's STAB Water-type attacks, but in doing so you've pretty much defeated the purpose of using Kingdra. Kingdra's viability relies on the fact that it can effectively combat rain due to Swift Swim; without Swift Swim, you might as well use another Dragon-type.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Clad in spiked armor, Ferrothorn is the bane of Kingdra's existence. Kingdra's Hydro Pumps and Draco Meteors do pittance while Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs edge Kingdra ever closer to death. Power Whip breaks Kingdra's Substitutes and Thunder Wave can completely cripple Kingdra. Ferrothorn can set up entry hazards in the time Kingdra is out. If rain is up, forget Hidden Power Fire, which only 2HKOes anyway; no Kingdra can score an OHKO. Ferrothorn's partner in crime—Jellicent—is just as good a counter, taking negligible damage from every attack in Kingdra's arsenal other than Draco Meteor. Jellicent can reply back with a burn, or worse, Taunt. Jellicent can Recover stall Draco Meteor, so the only way Kingdra will win is if it hits Jellicent with Dragon Pulse as it switches in and follows up with a Draco Meteor.</p> <p>Gastrodon can take special sets and cripple non-Substitute Dragon Dance ones with Toxic or burn. Another is defensive Politoed, who can take on Dragon Dance variants fairly well, as it can force Kingdra out with Perish Song. The final is Rotom-W, who can cripple Dragon Dance variants with Will-O-Wisp, and if specially defensive, it can handle special variants adequately enough. The major issue that arises is Substitute + Dragon Dance and ChestoRest Kingdra, who doesn't have to worry about status and thus turns these three Pokemon into setup fodder. Notable bulky Grass-types include Celebi and Amoonguss, specially defensive Celebi and Amoonguss can handle special Kingdra fairly well, and Amoonguss can Spore all variants except Substitute ones. Choice Specs and even Life Orb Draco Meteors do tons to both bulky Water- and Grass-types though, so be wary of that.</p> <p>Of course, you can always take the easy way out and use a revenge killer. Well, it's actually not that easy with Kingdra. Kingdra has some considerable bulk; it can tank some attacks, such as Choice Scarf Terrakion's Close Combat and Choice Scarf Keldeo's Secret Sword. For this reason, you will need a Choice Scarf Dragon-type to revenge kill Kingdra. Latios is preferable, as Kingdra needs two Dragon Dances to outpace it. You can also use Salamence, who has the benefit of turning Kingdra into a liability with Moxie. The only other way you're revenge killing Kingdra with a non-Dragon-type is with Terrakion, both of whom can only shorten and not end Kingdra's life. Also, remember that you're simply not revenge killing Kingdra in rain, so you'd better have a decent answer to it. The Choice Specs set is much easier to revenge kill, as it has no way of boosting its Speed unless you have rain. If you do have rain, try to force it out before bringing out Politoed. The only way to revenge kill Kingdra in rain is with powerful priority, such as Technician Breloom's Mach Punch, Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed, and Life Orb Mamoswine's Ice Shard, and they only KO if Kingdra's been weakened.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Rain Dance",
        "description": "<p>This set makes great use of Kingdra's offensive capabilities. In the rain, Kingdra is essentially a faster Life Orb Latios, boasting similar Special Attack with an insanely powerful Water-type STAB, enabling it to do something Latios can only dream of doing: sweep with its most powerful move. To put this into perspective, very few Pokemon in OU aren't 2HKOed by either Hydro Pump or Draco Meteor. Kingdra is adept at disrupting weather teams due to its ability to set up rain at any time. However, the limited turns of rain in conjunction with a Life Orb puts Kingdra on two timers; Kingdra does not last very long, so you must make the most of the time it has.</p> <p>When it comes to choosing a STAB move, you need to make a choice between Hydro Pump and Surf. A difference of 30 Base Power might not seem like much, but it makes a significant difference in practice as, accounting for rain and STAB, Hydro Pump has 270 Base Power and Surf 213. For this reason, Hydro Pump is recommended despite its tendency to miss: it punches massive holes in just about everything, 2HKOing even Ferrothorn with some prior damage. There goes Kingdra's biggest \"counter\"! If the accuracy really bothers you, by all means use Surf, but prepare to be disappointed by the lowered damage output.</p> <p>Draco Meteor is the key to Kingdra's success, though just one use of it ends its sweep. That debilitating factor is beside the point, however, when you take into account its ability to 2HKO most bulky Water-types. Hydro Pump just cannot break bulky Water-types, especially Jellicent, and the goal of this Kingdra is to hit as hard as possible in the limited time it has; thus, Draco Meteor fits perfectly. Heck, you don't even have to go for two Draco Meteors if you're worried about missing or being even more vulnerable to set up; you can choose to use Dragon Pulse followed by Draco Meteor for the 2HKO. That way, Kingdra's second move will still hit hard if you pick something else.</p> <p>Finally, the last slot is a toss-up between three moves. Just remember, it's not some filler move you'll never use. Surf might seem like the craziest idea to even consider pairing with Hydro Pump, but it gives you the best of both worlds: power and accuracy. When you don't need the power of Hydro Pump, you can go for Surf, and vice versa. Additionally, Surf gives Kingdra a reliable move with which to sweep late-game. Ice Beam has three main benefits: firstly, it lets Kingdra 2HKO Celebi, Amoonguss, and other Grass-types; secondly, it reliably KOes Landorus-T and Gliscor outside of rain; thirdly, it takes down Salamence and Dragonite without the need to use Draco Meteor. The final option is Dragon Pulse, which is similar to Surf in that it is a more reliable alternative to Draco Meteor. It is extremely useful for times when Kingdra needs to hit Water-types but doesn't want to render itself helpless in the turns following. However, keep in mind that a resisted rain-boosted Hydro Pump is just as powerful as a neutral STAB Dragon Pulse, so it's all for the accuracy.</p> <p>The given EVs allow Kingdra to outrun Choice Scarf Latios in the rain and Jolly Breloom, Adamant Dragonite, and Adamant Gyarados outside of it. The HP EVs provide an optimal number for taking Life Orb and entry hazard damage. Dropping the Speed EVs for bulk is a decent option; specifically, 176 Speed EVs lets Kingdra outrun Choice Scarf Garchomp in the rain. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is also viable to allow Kingdra to outspeed more Pokemon without a Swift Swim boost, but it comes at the cost of Draco Meteor never OHKOing Keldeo. As for the item, Life Orb is far preferred for the much-needed power boost, but there are other choices if you want Kingdra to survive longer. Leftovers stands out due to providing passive recovery, but it leaves Kingdra a bit lacking offensively. Splash Plate is another option if you want survivability but power on Kingdra's main Water-type STAB. The difference in power is still present in Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse, but that's a sacrifice you will have to make.</p> <p>There are two more options for the last moveslot: Hidden Power Fire and Signal Beam. As previously mentioned, Kingdra's worst enemy is Ferrothorn; however, you'll notice that Ferrothorn has a double weakness to Fire. This makes Hidden Power Fire a decent option to catch Ferrothorn off guard, but there are two issues: it doesn't hit anything else hard and is counter-productive with rain. For Hidden Power Fire to surprise Ferrothorn and do a good amount of damage to it, rain must not be up. Recall how Kingdra relies on the speed and power boosts from rain to accomplish much of anything? Yeah, this is pretty much the sole reason Hidden Power Fire is not a top pick for the last slot, but it is significant enough not to deter use. Signal Beam is an option to hit Celebi hard, but that's about it.</p> <p>Teammates are needed for just about every Pokemon to be successful, and Kingdra is no exception. First, you're going to want other fast sweepers that benefit from the removal of weathers other than the one they prefer. You're also going to want a way around Ferrothorn. Magnezone or Magneton make the best course of action to deal with it. After you get around Ferrothorn, you'll also need a way to remove Blissey, Chansey, and other specially defensive threats. These Pokemon are typically handled well by Fighting-type Pokemon. Keldeo is the best Fighting-type teammate, as Secret Sword demolishes Kingdra's counters and Keldeo has an extraordinarily powerful Hydro Pump of its own to weaken threats, which sets the stage for Kingdra to come in and clean up. Physical Fighting-types, such as Terrakion and Breloom, can also work. Scizor can also beat Chansey and Blissey, and furthermore can checkmate Grass-types, such as Celebi and Amoonguss, that are a nuisance for Kingdra to deal with. Thundurus-T can do the one thing Kingdra cannot: break walls. Its immunity to Thunder Wave and resistances to Grass and Steel give Thundurus-T the ability to set up on Kingdra's worst nemesis, Ferrothorn; it can also break bulky Water-types with ease. Generally, you're going to want multiple ways to defeat bulky Grass- and Water-type Pokemon, as they are major threats to Kingdra. Last but not least, Kingdra is ruined by entry hazards due to how quickly they stack up with all the other damage Kingdra takes throughout the course of a match. The solution is Rapid Spin support, which can be provided by Starmie or Tentacruel—both of who also benefit from rain.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>The main issue other Kingdra sets have is the need to waste a turn setting up. While the boost obtained in that turn is certainly appreciated, it also leaves Kingdra open to its opponent's attacks. How do you fix this issue? It's simple; just throw on a pair of Choice Specs! With Choice Specs, Kingdra is able to go out easily and attack, but not have anything to lose by switching back out. It isn't on any timer and hits like a freight train. This immediate offensive presence surprises foes that expect Kingdra to spend a turn setting up and not damaging them. Additionally, it lifts the burden on Kingdra to sweep. Instead, Kingdra can fulfill a role as a supporting attacker, hitting hard early- to mid-game and relying on its resistances to Fire and Water as a pivot; after that, it can sit back and watch the credits roll as its teammates finish off the opposing team. If Kingdra manages to survive that long, it can even do that itself.</p> <p>The first two moves are there for power. Every good Choice Specs user has a powerful STAB move or two, and Kingdra is no exception. With fantastic coverage together, little can stand in Kingdra's way. If you see a Pokemon that resists one move, most of the time you can pick the other, it's that simple. Hydro Pump is also useful to dismantle rain teams. However, both Draco Meteor and Hydro Pump have debilitating drawbacks, specifically an awful Special Attack drop and imperfect accuracy. While they are excellent moves to punch holes for most of the game, when late-game comes around, these drawbacks make them undesirable choices. The final two slots provide that reliability. Basically, pick a STAB move and Ice Beam. Ice Beam is needed to 2HKO specially defensive Celebi and do a ton to Amoonguss, while the STAB move is for reliable late-game cleaning. Surf is usually preferred because it hits many common threats hard and is quite powerful in rain, but Dragon Pulse has perfect neutral coverage against all foes bar Steel-types.</p> <p>The given EVs enable Kingdra to outrun Jolly Breloom and Cloyster, while a Modest nature gives it a chance to OHKO Dragonite through Multiscale, as well as land OHKOs on Magnezone, Keldeo, Skarmory, and bulky Starmie, and a 2HKO on physically defensive Ferrothorn after Spikes damage. However, a Timid nature is also viable as it allows Kingdra to Speed tie with Modest Hydreigon and revenge kill Adamant Haxorus. To reach this Speed benchmark, move the HP EVs to Speed. Without 252 EVs in Speed, you are better off with a Modest nature, plain and simple. Anyway, as you should know by now, Ferrothorn is Kingdra's worst enemy. With Choice Specs, Hidden Power Fire would actually do quite a bit to it. However, the move fails to damage specially defensive Celebi significantly and does pittance in rain, the favored weather of both Ferrothorn and Kingdra, which makes removing Ferrothorn a job best left to Pokemon specialized to do so, such as Magnezone.</p> <p>Choice Specs Kingdra is a top-notch rain counter, though its inability to set up rain on its own can be a hindrance at times. Consider using Pokemon that can set up rain the old-fashioned way, such as Tornadus, who has access to priority Rain Dance and can double as a special attacker, or Bronzong, whose massive bulk usually enables it to set up Rain Dance reliably; the latter can also easily bring Kingdra into battle with Explosion. Keep in mind that Choice Specs Kingdra is setup bait for the likes of Volcarona, Cloyster, and SubCM Jirachi after having used Draco Meteor or Ice Beam. Specially defensive Rotom-W can deal with all three to an extent, while Nasty Plot Thundurus-T, Swords Dance Scizor, Hippowdon, Tyranitar, Choice Specs Magnezone, and Garchomp can deal with Jirachi specifically. Additionally, Thundurus-T and Scizor, as previously mentioned, have the ability to set up on Ferrothorn. The last item you need for Kingdra to work at its best is entry hazards, which discourages switching. Ferrothorn is your best bet to set them up.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>A classic set from DPP, Substitute + Dragon Dance Kingdra is still as effective as ever. Kingdra has plenty of special attacking prowess, but physical sets are just as effective due to how amazing Dragon Dance is as a boosting move. Aside from the Attack boost, the lack of reliance on rain for a Speed boost is huge. The basic premise of the set is to set up on defensive Pokemon, weakened Pokemon, or a Choice-locked Fire- or Water-type attack. Defensive threats, such as Jirachi and Jellicent, are the easiest to take advantage of. Between Leftovers and Substitute, Kingdra can laugh off their weak attacks and status moves. After Kingdra has set up a couple of Dragon Dances, it is all set to sweep. Substitute makes it far easier to set up, blocking status, Trick, and revenge kills. The offensive moves are pretty obvious as well, consisting of only Kingdra's STABs, which are all it really needs. Waterfall is reliable, has a nifty chance to flinch, and brings rain teams to their knees. Outrage is for when Waterfall just isn't enough; it has ungodly power after a Dragon Dance or two and hits most Pokemon that resist Waterfall hard. Be sure to use discretion with Outrage, however, as being over-reliant on it against Water-type resistors will inevitably lead to a Steel-type such as Skarmory coming in and putting Kingdra in its place.</p> <p>The EV spread enables Kingdra's Substitute to survive a Body Slam from specially defensive Jirachi as well as outspeed Jolteon after one boost, Choice Scarf Latios after two, and Jolly Breloom with none. The 40 HP EVs lessen Life Orb recoil and the remaining EVs are placed in Attack. With this spread, Kingdra achieves a perfect balance between bulk, power, and speed.</p> <p>Despite all the pros of physical Kingdra, there is also one major con--it is much easier to wall. Armed with only its STABs, Kingdra needs Steel-types removed to get its job done. Ferrothorn can break Kingdra's Substitutes, cripple it with status, and take any attack that might come its way. Scizor forces Kingdra to use Substitute lest it take massive damage, and Skarmory can take any attack bar Waterfall after multiple boosts. Additionally, Steel-types make it basically impossible to use Outrage effectively, as they can absorb the hit and force Kingdra into confusion, stopping it right in its tracks. Having one Magnezone or Magneton is essentially a requirement if you want Kingdra to sweep, as they can trap and KO Steel-types. Magnezone is bulkier, but Magneton has more Speed and so can double as a revenge killer. Pokemon that lure out and weaken Steel-types, such as Haxorus and Kyurem-B, are also appreciated as partners. Be sure to get rid of Toxic Spikes (among other entry hazards), as poison limits the time Kingdra has to set up, especially alongside Substitute. Dragon Dance Kingdra is best fit on a team with other offensive Pokemon, such as Thundurus-T, Dragonite, and Volcarona, due to its susceptibility to revenge killing and being worn down. It also greatly appreciates Rain Dance support, as that provides Kingdra with a hefty boost to Speed that can come in handy if it can't nab a Dragon Dance.</p> "

        "name": "ChestoRest",
        "description": "<p>The biggest problem Dragon Dance Kingdra suffers from is being worn down. ChestoRest is a tried-and-true combination that gives Kingdra the ability to fully heal itself once with no repercussions. It tosses aside worry of being hit by status while boosting, which eliminates a large pool of Kingdra's counters. Furthermore, it boasts the ability to take some hits while setting up and be at full health afterwards to stop what few revenge killers can deal with a boosted Kingdra. Kingdra has the resistances it needs to set up easily against most Pokemon that cannot hit it too hard. The goal of this set is to boost as many times as possible, heal up, and sweep with Outrage and Waterfall, which provide all the coverage Kingdra needs in most cases. One thing you must not do, however, is attempt to sweep with only one or two boosts; this Kingdra doesn't have the power necessary to do so.</p> <p>The EVs allow Kingdra to, as all Dragon Dance sets do, outrun Jolteon after one Dragon Dance and Choice Scarf Latios after two. With the investment in bulk, Starmie's Ice Beam has only the slimmest chance to 3HKO, giving Kingdra the opportunity to set up all over it. Beware of Psyshock, however, which easily 2HKOes. The leftover EVs are placed into Attack to boost the power of Kingdra's attacks with an Adamant nature to supplement. These EVs are designed to give Kingdra the ability to obtain multiple boosts.</p> <p>For all the neat things this Kingdra set does, one it does not is beat Ferrothorn. Ferrothorn still walls Kingdra to hell and back, so consider packing Magnezone or Magneton to trap it. You should also carry a Fire- or Fighting-type or two to have another way around Ferrothorn and other Steel-types, since they tend to stop this set cold. The final threats you must be prepared for are Perish Song and Whirlwind users; you should eliminate them immediately. Politoed is the most common Perish Song user, and Skarmory and Hippowdon the most common Whirlwind users. Thundurus-T, Celebi, Roserade, and Breloom are optimal choices to deal with these threats. Lastly, you can't go wrong with giving Kingdra Rain Dance support, as the Speed increase and boost to Water-type moves is invaluable.</p> "

        "name": "Mixed Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>While Dragon Dance Kingdra usually attempts to obtain multiple boosts, that doesn't bode well for fighting more offensive teams. Such teams most often have Pokemon that can KO or completely cripple Kingdra as it foolishly attempts to set up. The goal of this set is to fix that issue; it has powerful attacks and a Life Orb in order to do so. This gives Kingdra the ability to hit everything hard, including physical walls that the other Dragon Dance sets struggle against. Examples of foes that are no longer a problem are Skarmory, Scizor, and last but not least Ferrothorn; many more can be defeated after a boost or two.</p> <p>This set's wide coverage is the main reason it is so good. The biggest decision you will have to make is between Waterfall and Hydro Pump. Waterfall is more accurate, has a chance to flinch, and can be boosted by Dragon Dance, but Hydro Pump hits Skarmory much harder and can OHKO Hippowdon; it all comes down to what you want Kingdra to beat. The second attack is not nearly as difficult a choice. You should use Hidden Power Fire unless for whatever reason you don't care so much about beating Ferrothorn; in which case replace it with Draco Meteor, which gives Kingdra an alternative to Outrage against Water-resistant foes, such as Breloom, Starmie, Slowbro, Latios, and Hydreigon, among many others.</p> <p>The EVs guarantee that Kingdra's +1 Outrage OHKOes 4/0 Dragonite through Multiscale and has a decent chance to also OHKO bulkier variants; they also provide Kingdra with enough Speed EVs to outrun Jolteon after one Dragon Dance, and Breloom, Mamoswine, and Adamant Gyarados before. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Attack to power up Kingdra's special moves. Life Orb is far preferred for the power boost, but Lum Berry is also an option to combat status users such as Ferrothorn, though the power difference is noticeable and Kingdra has difficulty stacking boosts to make up for said power difference. A specially based set of a similar nature is also possible, with Dragon Dance being used mostly for its Speed boost and to lure physical walls. Having a boosted Outrage to use when Kingdra is at -2 from Draco Meteor is also nice. An EV spread of 16 Atk / 252 SpA / 236 Spe with a Rash nature, Hydro Pump, Outrage, Draco Meteor and a fourth move of your choice for the attacks, and a Life Orb would be the set you would want.</p> <p>Kingdra is best used with offensive Pokemon such as Swords Dance Scizor and Swords Dance Lucario, who benefit from the weakening of certain walls and otherwise-annoying Pokemon. Kingdra doesn't usually run special attacks with Dragon Dance, so this set can effectively lure them in and KO them. If using Draco Meteor over Hidden Power Fire, be sure to pack a Magnezone, Magneton, or Gothitelle to trap Ferrothorn. Even if running Hidden Power Fire, however, it is ideal to have an alternative way around Ferrothorn, for example Terrakion or Keldeo, due to Ferrothorn's sheer popularity in rain. Something for Choice Scarf Salamence, who can easily revenge kill Kingdra at +1, such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, or Bronzong, is also needed. Finally, insurance against other common revenge killers, such as Terrakion and Keldeo, is advised, as the lack of defensive investment makes Kingdra easily revenge killed.</p> "

  "Donphan": {
    "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced around the time BW was the main generation. Information contained in the analysis regarding this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the current BW OU metagame in general is no longer accurate.</p> <hr /> <p>Donphan has access to Rapid Spin, a move that is commonly sought out because of its important ability to remove entry hazards from the field. Donphan separates itself from most spinners by not only having bulk, but also the ability to be offensive. Sporting a great base 120 Attack and powerful moves such as Earthquake, Stone Edge, and Head Smash, Donphan can function decently as a bulky offensive spinner. Donphan can even use Ice Shard, which is a useful tool against Dragon-types and Landorus-T that sets it apart from most bulky spinners. Sturdy is a pretty useful ability that allows Donphan to always survive an attack while at full health, which somewhat makes up for its measly Speed stat. Donphan can also be a great check to most variants of Terrakion, capable of taking Close Combats and Stone Edges quite nicely. Its overall great physical bulk lets it function as not only a sponge, but also as a check against physical attackers, a feat that most spinners fail to achieve. Even though Donphan has a few useful traits, it is by no means a good Pokemon. It is widely outclassed by other spinners and finds it difficult to stay alive. Overall, Donphan is a very niche Pokemon, and should always be considered as a last resort if none of the other spinners seem to work on a team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Donphan gets a few other toys in addition to the set listed above. It can augment its nice Attack with a Choice Band, but essentially loses its niche as a user of Rapid Spin. Its physical movepool is actually pretty neat, even including Seed Bomb, which can be used to hit bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon and Rotom-W on the switch. Stone Edge is always an alternative to Head Smash, as it sacrifices power in exchange for no recoil. Donphan's support movepool is rather nice as well. Toxic and Roar rack up residual damage and mess with many of Donphan's common switch-ins. Counter is surprisingly good on Donphan as well; Donphan's great Defense as well as Sturdy allow it to absorb huge amounts of damage from physical attackers and dish it right back out. Knock Off is very situational, but can be useful against walls carrying Leftovers or offensive Pokemon that completely rely on their item.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ghost-types are the biggest defense against Donphan, as they ultimately prevent Donphan from doing its job by blocking Rapid Spin. Sableye and physically defensive Jellicent can burn Donphan with Will-O-Wisp, and can also take at least one Head Smash it if has to from the rare Lum Berry variants. Gengar is capable of switching into most of Donphan's moves and can either wear it down with its strong Special Attack moves, or set up a Substitute on it. Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory can all set up on Donphan if it lacks Fire Fang, and can chip Donphan's health away or phaze it out. Defensive Water-types, such as Politoed, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W, are capable of forcing Donphan out with their STAB Water-type moves. Breloom and Celebi can take all of Donphan's moves, even Ice Shard, and can OHKO Donphan with their respective STAB Grass-type moves or set up on it. Kyurem-B is a great check because it ignores Sturdy with Teravolt and can KO Donphan with Ice Beam. Air Balloon Heatran can actually check Donphan as well, doing massive damage with Fire Blast in the process. Latias can beat down Donphan with Surf or set up Calm Minds on Donphan, as Ice Shard fails to even 4HKO it, and Latias can just recover the damage anyways. Any powerful special move has the potential to pretty much always 2HKO Donphan. Generally, your main goal when dealing with Donphan is to get some damage on it (usually with entry hazards) in order to break Sturdy. Without Sturdy, any strong special attacker is a great check to Donphan, since they're pretty much guaranteed to OHKO it.</p> ",

        "name": "Rapid Spin",
        "description": "<p>This is the only set Donphan should ever be using in the current metagame. The main purpose of this set is to take advantage of Donphan's above average physical bulk in order to take as many hits as possible, which in turn should hopefully keep Donphan alive for a majority of the match. Rapid Spin is the only reason to use Donphan, so it is obligatory on this set. As Donphan is surprisingly bulky and is quite capable of taking powerful physical moves, Donphan finds it easy to come into these attacks in order to use Rapid Spin. Earthquake is Donphan's only STAB move, and coming off of its base 120 Attack, hits pretty hard. For example, Donphan ends up being a great Terrakion check because of its ability to deal heavy damage to Terrakion with it. Donphan is also a really good check to Choice Band Tyranitar, and it is easily capable of 2HKOing Tyranitar with Earthquake. Stealth Rock is the most important move in the game, and Donphan is a great Stealth Rock user, since it's almost guaranteed to set up Stealth Rock due to Sturdy. Ice Shard is another great move to have on Donphan to give it more of an offensive presence instead of just Earthquake alone, and it is a great move to deal solid damage to Salamence, Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor.</p> <p>Donphan's EV spread can be tailored to fit your needs, but the given EV spread and nature are highly recommended in order to keep Donphan alive for as long as possible. With this spread, Donphan can avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Terrakion's Close Combat and the OHKO from +2 Lucario's Close Combat after Stealth Rock. It is possible to make Donphan more offensive with the simple change of moving its EVs in Defense to Attack and giving it an Adamant nature, but Donphan will become more susceptible to physical attacks. Another viable EV spread Donphan can run is 128 HP / 252 Atk / 128 Spe with an Adamant nature and a Lum Berry, which allows Donphan to outpace specially defensive Jellicent and 2HKO it with Earthquake. Lum Berry is used to bypass the possible Will-O-Wisp that Jellicent will most likely try to cripple Donphan with. Head Smash is a powerful move to use as an alternative to Stealth Rock if you do not need it, and it deals huge damage to Flying-types and easily 2HKOes Gengar. Fire Fang can be used to deal significant damage to Spikes users, such as Forretress and Ferrothorn, that may try to set up on Donphan. Toxic is an option to cripple common switch-ins such as Politoed and Jellicent, while Roar can be used to prevent set up sweepers from boosting up on Donphan. Odor Sleuth can be used to bypass spinblockers, but Donphan will lose out on a valuable coverage or support move.</p> <p>Donphan is best used on a sun team because it can check a great deal of problematic Pokemon, such as Terrakion, Salamence, and Choice Band Tyranitar, while providing Rapid Spin support. Still, Donphan is still quite viable on other weather based teams, such as hail, sand, and even rain, because of its ability to check physical Dragon-types. Specifically, access to priority Ice Shard easily let's it check some of the most dangerous Dragon-types in the tier including Salamence, Dragonite, and Garchomp. As Donphan is the only spinner that's actually vulnerable to Toxic Spikes, a grounded Poison-type partner and or Blissey with Heal Bell can fix that problem quite easily. Additionally, Blissey can use Wish to make up for Donphan's lack of recovery. Due to Donphan's poor Special Defense, Jirachi or specially defensive Jellicent can be great partners for Donphan, Jellicent having the additional bonus of blocking spinners from removing Donphan's Stealth Rock. Volcarona and Victini will greatly appreciate the help from Rapid Spin and the resistance to Rock-type attacks. Heatran is also a viable partner to protect Donphan from Grass- and Ice-type attacks.</p> "

  "Blissey": {
    "overview": "<p>Say hello to Blissey, considered to be the best special wall throughout the generations. Sadly, with generation 5, Blissey's usefulness has diminished. Powerful special sweepers were brought into the metagame along with the introduction of Psyshock, meaning Blissey cannot be the special wall it once was. Keldeo, Alakazam, Latios, and Jirachi are all special attackers that Blissey just can't seem to handle. Blissey also faces stiff competition from Chansey, who has a lot more bulk whilst holding an Eviolite. Jirachi and Celebi also give Blissey competition as a special wall, as they have offensive presence and a much better typing. However, unlike Chansey, Blissey can hold Leftovers, allowing it to negate the residual damage from sand, hail, and entry hazards, making it much harder to wear it down. Its HP is the highest of any Pokemon and it can make use of it with massive Wishes that can heal more than 300 HP for its teammates. Blissey is considered to be the best cleric in OU, thanks to its fantastic support movepool and incredible special bulk. While Blissey isn't perfect, and is often setup bait for a lot of sweepers, it's usually the best cleric for weather stall teams, and must be considered when building a stall team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is a move that literally every team must have, but there are so many Pokemon that learn it, so Blissey should rarely ever need it. Stealth Rock also allows you to stall out Gengar, but has little use outside of that. Blissey also has many other special attacks, but it really does not have the space for them, and they are pitifully weak for such a low uninvested Special Attack.</p> <p>Blissey can use Calm Mind to boost its high Special Defense and its mediocre Special Attack, but it is still weak to physical attacks and is often forced out pretty quickly. Light Screen is an option, but is better left to Pokemon like Cresselia or Bronzong that have access to Reflect as well. Serene Grace increases the chances of secondary effects, like Ice Beam's chance to freeze, but Natural Cure is generally the better option because Blissey generally does not stay in for too many turns. Natural Cure also allows Blissey to recover from poison, which would otherwise cripple it. Counter and Gravity are less orthodox options, but can work due to Blissey's insane HP stat.</p> <p>Specifically, Gravity also allows you to use more powerful moves on Blissey, such as Thunder, Blizzard, and Fire Blast, but it's gimmicky at best. Skill Swap can be used to stop Reuniclus from destroying your team, but Blissey is hit hard by Psyshock. Psych Up has some value in that it can go through Substitutes and this steals defensive boosts like a Quiver Dance or a Calm Mind boost from a Jirachi, Reuniclus, or Celebi, but it has little use outside of that. Blissey has some gimmicky options in Defense Curl, and Charm, but Blissey has better things to do.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The large list of Fighting-types in OU are the best way to keep Blissey in check; Terrakion, Breloom, Keldeo, Infernape, Conkeldurr, and Lucario are all Pokemon that can switch in pretty easily and force Blissey out. However, they must be wary of Thunder Wave. Any strong physical attacker with high-powered STAB attacks or Fighting-type coverage can muscle past Blissey. Kyurem-B has a titanic base 170 Attack and a strong STAB in the form of Outrage, while Blissey can't scratch it back. Strong Ground- and Dragon-types like Garchomp, Choice Band Dragonite, and Double Dance Landorus-T can easily get past Blissey or force it out.</p> <p>Jirachi is immune to Toxic and can set up 101 HP Substitutes to allow it to get multiple Calm Minds in without getting worn down by Seismic Toss. It can also paralyze Blissey and flinch it down with Iron Head, or even trick a Choice Scarf onto it. Other bulky Calm Mind sweepers like Reuniclus also give it hell thanks to Magic Guard and Recover. Stallbreakers like Gliscor, Reuniclus, and Gengar easily force Blissey to switch. Gliscor is immune to status thanks to Poison Heal and can Taunt Blissey due to its higher base Speed. Reuniclus has Magic Guard and can use Blissey as setup bait. Gengar is immune to Toxic and Seismic Toss and can use Blissey's own health to its advantage via Pain Split and can also carry Taunt.</p> <p>While Blissey used to take on most Psychic-types easily, with the release of Psyshock, it's a much different story. Latios, Alakazam, and Reuniclus can get past Blissey easily with this attack, as it attacks Blissey on its much lower physical defense. Other Trick users, like Latios and Rotom-W, cripple Blissey by replacing its beloved Leftovers with a handicap.</p> ",

Soft-Boiled is another option to reduce Blissey's reliance on Wish for recovery, and is generally a better option if you're using Blissey as a cleric instead of a Wish passer.</p> <p>Aromatherapy allows Blissey to heal its teammates and prevents Blissey from being Toxic stalled, allowing Blissey to further support the team. Toxic allows Blissey to wear down the opponent, and is Blissey's main way of damaging the opponent, which works well in conjunction with Protect. Thunder Wave has been slashed to better deal with fast sweepers like Volcarona while also statusing Fighting-types such as Lucario and Terrakion on the switch. Seismic Toss prevents Blissey from becoming complete setup bait by sweepers (especially most Substitute users trying to avoid Toxic), and allows it to reliably damage the opposition without worrying about its low offenses. However, Flamethrower hits most Steel-types immune to Toxic hard, such as Forretress, Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Keep in mind that it fails to guarantee a 2HKO on Ferrothorn and is less effective in a rain-filled metagame.</p> <p>The EVs have been used to maximize defenses while a Calm nature is used to allow it to absorb special attacks more easily. Wish can be paired with Soft-Boiled to reduce Blissey's dependence on receiving Wish, but Protect is generally better, as it allows you to scout your opponent and Toxic stall as well as gain some health back with Leftovers. If you decide to use Blissey without either Wish or Aromatherapy, Flamethrower can be used in the second slot in tandem with Seismic Toss. Fire Blast can be used in place of Flamethrower to 2HKO Skarmory and Ferrothorn, but its measly amount of PP is an issue for a defensive Pokemon, and is useless when facing rain teams.</p> <p>Blissey functions well on stall and other defensive teams that appreciate the utility of Wish and can cover Fighting-types and physical attackers in return. Jellicent fits stall teams nicely, as Jellicent spinblocks and can come in on Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Infernape which often switch in on Blissey. Meanwhile Blissey can heal Jellicent from status. Latias also has great synergy with Blissey, as it takes on Fighting-type attackers such as Breloom and Keldeo, both of which can easily muscle through Blissey. Pairing Skarmory up with Blissey creates the \"SkarmBliss\" core. Unfortunately, this core has become less effective this generation thanks to mixed attackers such as Keldeo, Infernape, Hydreigon, and Kyurem-B. Bulky Grass-types such as Celebi, Roserade, and Amoonguss can all check Keldeo, and at the same time check Breloom, making them pretty decent partners for Blissey.</p> <p>Entry hazards are annoying for Blissey to switch into, so having a spinner is important. Tentacruel and Forretress can both Rapid Spin and appreciate Blissey's huge Wishes and its ability to come in on special attacks. However, Tentacruel is only a good spinner in rain, so defensive Starmie is also a very viable option, as Starmie has decent synergy with Blissey, being able to come in on Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion. Ferrothorn can check Dragon Dance users, as well as Latios and Kyurem-B, but they share a Fighting weakness, meaning that you have to be careful when using both Ferrothorn and Blissey on the same team. Finally, Landorus-T is one of the best switch-ins to Terrakion and Scizor, two Pokemon that often use Blissey as setup bait.</p> <p>The main advantages of using Blissey over Chansey is that Blissey is better in weather-based teams, so Hippowdon, Abomasnow, and Tyranitar all make for good partners. If you're using a rain or sun team, or a weatherless team, be sure to check if Chansey isn't a better option for your team. Also be wary that pairing Blissey with Tyranitar or Abomasnow increases your weaknesses to Fighting-type attacks, so make sure you cover their weaknesses.</p> "

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW OU metagame in general. A <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/tyranitar-revamp-wip.3679099/\">revamp</a> is currently being worked on for this analysis.</p> <hr /> <p>With Pokemon Black and White 2 came the Therian formes and Keldeo, all of which have bolstered the power of rain teams and worn down Tyranitar's prominence like waves against a cliff. Some older threats, such as Breloom and Mamoswine, have had new life breathed into them by their Dream World abilities. A few new Pokemon have also been added to Tyranitar's list of headaches due to their new access to Superpower (courtesy of the move tutors, who have decided not to give Tyranitar much to improve its admittedly already impressive movepool). The same Fighting-types that troubled Tyranitar before still remain in OU, ready to pounce on it at any moment. The general pace of the metagame has increased, making Tyranitar's life in OU more difficult to maintain than ever before.</p> <p>However, Tyranitar maintains a powerful and respectable niche as one of two automatic sandstorm inducers, which is important due to the ubiquity of weather in OU. While Hippowdon may give Tyranitar a substantial amount of competition for a team slot, the tyrant has many advantages up its sleeve: increased special bulk under sandstorm, a better movepool, and the ability to smite many of its would-be counters on the switch with its raw power and impressive versatility. Tyranitar's ability to support potent sweepers, such as Terrakion, while fending off powerful specially based threats, such as Latios, Reuniclus, and Tornadus, further expand its niche in OU. Overall, while many new threats have conspired to dethrone the tyrant, they have yet to succeed, for Tyranitar has retained an iron grasp on its throne as one of the many kings of OU.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar can make use of its good mixed coverage and access to Stealth Rock to run an offensive Focus Sash lead set that can safely get up entry hazards while catching common checks like Breloom, Scizor, and Landorus-T off guard. The support set can opt to run Custap Berry in conjunction with Ice Beam and a more offensive spread in order to surprise Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp, but it becomes less reliable against Alakazam and Tornadus. Similarly, if Chople Berry isn't needed and the team prefers a defensive approach, Leftovers can be used to give Tyranitar access to passive recovery, which greatly improves its longevity and ability to switch into offensive Heatran over time. Tyranitar can run some niche sweeping sets with its access to Dragon Dance and Curse, but these sets are generally inconsistent due to Tyranitar's inability to set up over time with its crippling Fighting-type weakness. Among the support moves offered by Tyranitar, Roar and Dragon Tail can be used to phaze opposing Pokemon, but it is generally a wasted moveslot and done better by Skarmory. Taunt is another option that can be used with Speed investment to block Spikes from Pokemon like Skarmory and annoy bulky foes like Jellicent.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Naturally, Fighting-types, which resist Tyranitar's STAB moves and possess STAB on moves that target Tyranitar's largest weakness, are its best counters. Among them, Terrakion and Breloom are best suited to dealing with it thanks to the former's access to Justified and the latter's powerful Technician-boosted Mach Punch. However, Terrakion must beware of a stray Superpower, and Breloom must avoid Fire Blast or Ice Beam. Keldeo stands as a respectable counter, threatening Tyranitar with a powerful Secret Sword. Conkeldurr can use its own immense bulk to turn Tyranitar into setup fodder or force a KO on it with its powerful moves. While it must watch out for the same moves as Terrakion, Lucario is endowed with a 4x resistance to Tyranitar's STABs and has access to Close Combat.</p> <p>However, Fighting-types are not the only way to halt a Tyranitar's rampage. While it may not have a resistance to its Dark STAB, Hippowdon's massive physical bulk and access to reliable recovery in the form of Slack Off allows it to stall Tyranitar out ad infinitum. Gliscor, thanks to its massive Defense, Poison Heal, and powerful Earthquake, works well as a Tyranitar counter. While Landorus-T may not have Poison Heal, it does have both Intimidate, which allows it to sponge even the strongest of hits from Tyranitar, and a massive base 145 Attack stat, making its Earthquake absurdly powerful. Steel-types also possess a resistance to its STAB moves and the ability to smack one of its weaknesses. Among them, Jirachi and Scizor stand out, with the latter only fearing an unexpected Fire Blast. Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Forretress work as well, but they all must watch out for Fire Blast (and, in the case of Ferrothorn, Superpower).</p> <p>It's much easier to check Tyranitar than it is to counter it thanks to its rather low Speed and horrendous defensive typing. While it won't enjoy a powerful Crunch or Superpower, Garchomp can come in and threaten to KO with Earthquake or use it as setup fodder. Users of Will-O-Wisp, such as Mew and Sableye, can easily nullify its gigantic Attack stat. Other opposing weather inducers, Politoed and Abomasnow, are massive pains for Tyranitar to deal with since they carry super-effective STAB attacks and rob Tyranitar of its Special Defense boost. Thanks to the Superpower tutor Hydreigon is also a good check, as it resists Tyranitar's Dark-type STAB and Fire Blast. Mamoswine, while not a newcomer to this list, is now an even better check thanks to Thick Fat, which improves its ability to switch in on Tyranitar.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Tyranitar's high stats, important ability in Sand Stream, and access to Stealth Rock allow it to support its team. Stealth Rock is very important in punishing opponent's switches and racking up damage on Pokemon such as Tornadus and Thundurus-T. With enough investment into special bulk, Tyranitar is capable of checking many dangerous special attackers in the tier, such as Latios, Tornadus, and Thundurus-T. Pursuit allows Tyranitar to trap and remove these Pokemon for its teammates, while Crunch allows Tyranitar to threaten bulkier Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Reuniclus and Jellicent. Tyranitar's last moveslot improves its coverage. Superpower allows Tyranitar to deal significant damage to Excadrill, Heatran and Hydreigon, as well as being Tyranitar's best bet against Fighting-type switch-ins such as Terrakion and Keldeo. Fire Blast can roast common Steel-type switch-ins such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory and also prevents the latter three from laying entry hazards on Tyranitar.</p> <p>The HP investment maximizes Tyranitar's bulk, and maximum Special Defense EVs help Tyranitar take hits from Pokemon it can trap such as Tornadus, Latios, and Thundurus-T, as well as make the most out of the Special Defense boost it receives from the sand. Another EV spread worth using is 252 HP / 88 Atk / 168 SpD with an Adamant or Brave nature, as it allows Tyranitar to always 2HKO Calm Mind Reuniclus after Leftovers recovery. Chople Berry allows Tyranitar to check various special attackers that use Focus Blast as a coverage move to hit Tyranitar, such as Alakazam, Tornadus, Thundurus-T, and Reuniclus.</p> <p>With Tyranitar's wide movepool, there are many other options that can be used with this set. Ice Beam is the most useful of these and can be used to hit Gliscor and Landorus-T, some common switch-ins to Tyranitar, for massive damage. Earthquake is another option Tyranitar can use, OHKOing Heatran and 2HKOing Tentacruel and, after some chip damage, Jirachi. Tyranitar can also use Thunder Wave to lure and cripple certain checks to it, such as Keldeo and Terrakion.</p> <p>Thanks to its massive defenses, Hippowdon doesn't fear anything from this set aside from the rare Ice Beam. Hippowdon can stall Tyranitar out with Slack Off or deal massive damage to it with Earthquake. Fighting-types have always been the bane of Tyranitar's existence, and this generation has only added to the myriad of Pokemon that counter Tyranitar reliably. Pokemon such as Keldeo, Conkeldurr, and Breloom can all threaten Tyranitar with their STAB attacks, but Terrakion deserves a special mention, as it can OHKO Tyranitar even through its Chople Berry. Psychic-types such as Latios and Reuniclus can switch into Fighting-type attacks and threaten these Pokemon with Draco Meteor and Psychic, respectively. Keldeo appreciates Tyranitar's ability to Pursuit trap many of its common checks such as Latios and Jellicent, and in return it can threaten bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Landorus-T, which threaten Tyranitar. Breloom is in a similar boat, and it can also threaten bulky Water-type Pokemon. Both Keldeo and Breloom also appreciate Tyranitar keeping opposing weather sweepers at bay by providing sandstorm, allowing them to fare better against powerful Water-type attacks. Skarmory is also a good partner, as it appreciates Tyranitar's ability to check dangerous special attackers and the residual damage it provides against the opposing team with Stealth Rock and sandstorm, which Skarmory can further take advantage of by setting up Spikes and shuffling the opposing team with Whirlwind. Thanks to its good physical bulk and typing, Skarmory can also handle many of the Fighting- and Ground-types that Tyranitar hates.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>This is similar to the quintessential Choice Scarf set that can be seen on many offensively inclined Pokemon, but Tyranitar's Choice Scarf set is special because it can outpace and trap many common, threatening Pokemon, ranging from offensive Psychic-type behemoths such as Latios to frail weather sweepers such as Sawsbuck and Starmie. However, it fails to outpace Alakazam, who is capable of OHKOing with Focus Blast; in fact, comparatively low speed for a Choice Scarf user is this set's largest shortcoming. Pursuit is listed first because this set's primary purpose is to trap and kill off weakened Pokemon. Crunch lets Tyranitar get a harder hit on Jellicent and Reuniclus, Pokemon that can usually tank a Pursuit if they don't switch. Stone Edge is Tyranitar's most powerful STAB move and gives it the power to revenge kill Flying-type Pokemon and unboosted Volcarona. Superpower is useful for catching opposing Lucario and Terrakion off-guard, provided they don't have a Choice Scarf as well.</p> <p>If revenge killing opposing Gliscor and Landorus-T is something your team desperately needs, then Ice Beam and a Hasty nature can be used. Fire Punch can be used to throw Scizor off its hinges, but it doesn't exactly get the best neutral coverage and leaves Tyranitar open to Heatran. Fire Blast can be used with a Hasty nature to hit the aforementioned Pokemon with a stronger attack on the special side, but it has little utility outside of that. Earthquake can be used to get a stronger hit on Jirachi and Metagross, but is a lackluster option otherwise.</p> <p>Since this Tyranitar is weaker than its Choice Band counterpart, it is more prone to being walled and forced out by physically bulky Pokemon, such as Hippowdon and Skarmory. As such, powerful partners, such as Choice Band Terrakion or Choice Specs Latios, should be used alongside it. Entry hazards are always appreciated due to the reduced power of this set; in particular, they allow Tyranitar to gain exceptional mileage when utilized on stall teams, which already utilize plenty of hazards and typically employ walls that can defeat the Fighting-types that plague Tyranitar. Alternatively, if a more offensive team style is desired, then Terrakion or Scolipede can be used to guarantee the presence of hazards.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>When equipped with a Choice Band, it is easy to see why Tyranitar is one of the most-feared Pokemon in OU. Boasting an absolutely massive 604 Attack, not many Pokemon will have business switching in on it. Opposing weather inducers not named Hippowdon will fear switching into its powerful attacks, making this set ideal for those that want to win the weather war decisively. Stall teams will be hard-pressed to keep up with its onslaught due to the sheer power it possesses, and offensive teams won't like having to sacrifice one of their team members so another one can receive a free switch-in.</p> <p>Despite its accuracy, Stone Edge is Tyranitar's main STAB move solely for its power; it is capable of OHKOing or 2HKOing those that lack a resistance to it and even some that do. Crunch is a more accurate move that lets Tyranitar make short work of Jellicent, Reuniclus, and Celebi. Pursuit gives Tyranitar the ability to trap and kill the frail Psychic- and Ghost-types that would rather not stay in on any of Tyranitar's attacks. Superpower is the best move to use in the last slot due to its ability to brutalize Steel-types and other Pokemon that resist its STAB moves. Superpower also gives Tyranitar the ability to land a crippling blow on Terrakion, Keldeo, and Breloom—three of its biggest enemies—on the switch.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Tyranitar's power while giving it the ability to outpace uninvested base 70s. The remaining EVs are placed into HP to give Tyranitar more bulk. Aqua Tail can be used over Superpower to smack Pokemon like Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Donphan around, but that is usually better left to teammates. Ice Punch can be used to get a surprise blow on powerful Dragon-types, but most are already hit hard enough by Stone Edge, and the main Dragon-types Tyranitar should be facing—Latios and Latias—are scared witless by Crunch and Pursuit. Fire Punch is a great move for those that want to nab a surprise KO on Scizor and Ferrothorn, two of Tyranitar's most common checks. Earthquake provides mostly redundant coverage, but it still can see some use if your team is vulnerable to Jirachi, Tentacruel, or Metagross. More often than not, however, Superpower is the better option.</p> <p>This set has few guaranteed counters, due to its sheer power, but it unfortunately does have plenty of checks. The foremost among these is physically defensive Hippowdon, who can switch in fearing little other than a boosted Aqua Tail, which is fairly rare on Tyranitar, and stall it out with Slack Off or go for the kill with Earthquake. Landorus-T and Gliscor function almost as well as Hippowdon, but both must watch out for Stone Edge as well as Aqua Tail. While Breloom, Terrakion, and Keldeo won't enjoy taking a Superpower, they can switch in on Tyranitar's STAB moves and force it out with the threat of powerful Fighting-type moves. Teammates such as Latios, Latias, and Reuniclus make great checks and counters to those Fighting-types. This also works in reverse; Keldeo and other Fighting-types appreciate Tyranitar's ability to annihilate Latios and Latias, and in turn, Tyranitar appreciates their ability to lure in Psychic-types, most of which are easy prey for it. While Garchomp will not enjoy eating a STAB Crunch, it can easily switch into Tyranitar's other moves and threaten it with its STAB Earthquake. Other offensive monsters, such as Terrakion, enjoy the sandstorm and wallbreaking power that Tyranitar brings along. As Tyranitar has trouble with physical walls that resist its STAB moves, Pokemon such as Heatran form great partnerships with it. If special bulk is prioritized, then an EV spread of 252 HP / 36 Atk / 220 SpD can be used at the expense of quite a bit of power.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW OU metagame in general. A <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/celebi-wip.3679813/\">revamp</a> is currently being worked on for this analysis.</p> <hr /> <p>As with most legendary Pokemon, Celebi is blessed with great base stats all around. It also has a good and synergetic typing, an awesome ability that lets it act as a status absorber, and a phenomenal movepool. These traits allow Celebi to play many roles, depending on your team's needs. It can be a sturdy special wall that handles many prominent threats, such as Keldeo, Thundurus-T, Sheer Force Landorus, and Breloom, with a large repertoire of utility moves, consisting of Stealth Rock, U-turn, Perish Song, Thunder Wave, Heal Bell, and Baton Pass. Or it can take the offensive route and utilize its good coverage, bulk, and resistances to set up with Nasty Plot, making it quite hard to wall. It can even use a Choice Scarf set to revenge kill troublesome threats, a Baton Pass set to assist your sweepers, or a tank set to combine the offensive and defensive roles.</p> <p>However, the list of its flaws is as big as the list of its advantages. Its typing leaves it with a whopping seven weaknesses, one of them being a quadruple weakness to Bug moves. This means that it is prone to both Pursuit trapping and to U-turn, which is never a good thing. As with most Grass-types, it struggles quite a bit against sun teams, but don't let its flaws disappoint you. With the right teammates Celebi can really shine, and prevent those pesky rain teams that are everywhere from overwhelming you.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Grass Knot can be used instead of Giga Drain and Leaf Storm on the specially defensive and offensive sets respectively. Grass Knot hits most of the Pokemon in OU that are neutral to Grass moves for good damage, and doesn't drop your special attack, but it has pitiful power against Rotom-W. This is a big downfall, as countering Rotom-W is one of Celebi's main jobs. Grass Knot also hits Keldeo and Politoed for less damage than Giga Drain, limiting its usefulness even further. However, Grass Knot has some notable advantages, such as OHKOing Terrakion, and 2HKOing most Tyranitar, Gyarados, Jellicent, and Hippowdon after Stealth Rock, making Celebi more difficult to use as setup bait. Celebi can use a physical set with Swords Dance, but its physical movepool is limited, as the only viable physical moves it has are Seed Bomb, Zen Headbutt, U-turn, and Sucker Punch, making it struggle for coverage. As most Grass-types, Celebi can use a SubSeed set to annoy the opponent, but with the abundance of Pokemon that don't care about this strategy, such as Gliscor, Ferrothorn, and Scizor, this set will only waste Celebi's potential most of the time. Celebi has access to Calm Mind to take advantage of its already good special bulk and simultaneously raise its Special Attack, but many dominant Pokemon can OHKO Celebi even with a Calm Mind boost so it's usually not worth it. Celebi gets Reflect, Light Screen, and Healing Wish, all good qualities for a dual screen set. It also has the bulk, the resistances, and reliable recovery, enabling it to switch in multiple times and last throughout the game, to set up screens, and bring a teammate in safely and fully healed with Healing Wish. However, its 4x weakness to U-turn and its other weaknesses to common attacking types make it unappealing for this role, as it can be OHKOed by many Pokemon before it has the chance to set up. Finally, Trick Room can be used on any non-Choice Celebi to support a dedicated Trick Room team, but its high speed and the limited viability of such teams usually prevent this move from being more than a mediocre choice.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>When looking to check or counter Celebi the first way that comes to mind is to capitalize on its many weaknesses. Pokemon that can OHKO it or severely dent it, and can switch in safely, are generally a very good way to deal with Celebi. Faster Pokemon with STAB super effective moves, such as Gengar, Volcarona, Choice Scarf Heracross, Abomasnow, and Ninetales, all destroy Celebi, but have to be wary of Thunder Wave, Psychic, Earth Power, and Hidden Power Fire in Abomasnow's case. Dragon-types, such as Kyurem, Kyurem-B, Salamence, Dragonite, Latios, and Hydreigon, handle Celebi pretty well, as long as they avoid Psychic, Thunder Wave, and U-turn on the switch. Lastly, Steel-types, such as Heatran, and Scizor, are proficient at handling Celebi, but have to beware of Earth Power, and Hidden Power Fire, respectively.</p> <p>Then we have the Pokemon that usually wall Celebi and can't outright OHKO it, but can set-up on it, making it a liability for its team. Such Pokemon are Forretress, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Latias, Lucario, Reuniclus, and Thundurus-T. Celebi can threaten all of them though, with the right move. Forretress, Skarmory, and Lucario fear Hidden Power Fire, Latias and Reuniclus are shut down by Perish Song, Latias and Lucario dislike Thunder Wave, Lucario and Thundurus-T are hit hard by Psychic, and Lucario hates Earth Power.</p> <p>Another public enemy for Celebi are sun teams in general, which usually pack Fire-type moves on at least half of their members, as well as Fire-type Pokemon that can at worst 2HKO Celebi. Celebi also cannot hurt many of the Pokemon that are commonly found on sun teams such as Ninetales, Volcarona, and Victini.</p> <p>Finally, there are the Pokemon that can revenge kill Celebi, but can't switch into it really well. Such Pokemon are U-turn Landorus, Terrakion with X-Scissor, Tyranitar with Pursuit, Mamoswine, Garchomp, and AcroBat Gliscor. Generally, any Pokemon that can outspeed Celebi and hit it with a Bug move, or a super effective STAB move is a good revenge killer.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<p>With its good stats, typing, ability, and access to Recover, Celebi is able to check a lot of threats, namely Keldeo, Thundurus-T, Sheer Force Landorus, Starmie, Rotom-W, Politoed, Calm Mind Jirachi, and Calm Mind Latias. Giga Drain is the standard STAB move that gives Celebi a bit of recovery, and allows it to hit the Water-types it walls for super effective damage. Psychic is the other STAB move that Celebi can use instead of Giga Drain, and has its own unique advantages. Psychic lets Celebi deal better with Pokemon such as Thundurus-T, Breloom, Tentacruel, Conkeldurr, and Amoonguss, while still hitting some targets of Giga Drain for super effective damage, namely Keldeo and Terrakion. However, when using Psychic, Celebi has a harder time against Water-type Pokemon that can hit it hard, such as Life Orb Starmie and Choice Specs Politoed, because it cannot damage them quickly enough and may succumb to a critical hit or a freeze. If dealing with Water-types more reliably is of utmost importance, then use Giga Drain, otherwise you are better off with Psychic, which is useful against a wider array of threats. Recover is used for reliable recovery, and combined with Natural Cure, makes Celebi very difficult to take down. U-turn is a good move for any defensive Pokemon, especially Celebi, allowing it to be an excellent pivot and to scout for any Pokemon looking to kill Celebi with Pursuit, such as Tyranitar and Scizor. However, Baton Pass is preferred to enable Celebi to escape from Pursuit without taking damage.</p> <p>In the last slot there are three utility moves that can be used. Perish Song is a rare and useful move with shallow distribution and allows Celebi to counter many set up sweepers, such as Calm Mind Jirachi, Calm Mind Keldeo, Substitute Dragon Dance Dragonite, Calm Mind Latias, and Calm Mind Reuniclus, essentially acting as a phazing move. Perish Song also synergizes well with U-turn, as when the opponent is forced to switch out, in the last turn of Perish Song, you can easily scout the switch-in with U-turn, gaining the upper hand. Thunder Wave is another excellent move that helps Celebi deal with a multitude of Pokemon. The ubiquitous Scizor loves to switch into Celebi, and Thunder Wave cripples it significantly. Same goes for Latios, Latias, Hydreigon, Kyurem, Kyurem-B, and Dragonite. Finally, Stealth Rock is always an option, and Celebi is one of the most reliable users of the move and finds plenty of opportunities to set it up, but many Pokemon learn this move, and you should better utilize moves that are semi-exclusive to Celebi, or help Celebi more with its role.</p> <p>The Speed EVs are used to outrun maximum Speed Timid Magnezone, and the rest are put into HP and Special Defense to maximize special bulk. Hidden Power Fire can be used in the last slot to hit Scizor, Forretress, and Ferrothorn hard. Watch out though, as Hidden Power Fire can't OHKO Scizor, so you'll need some damage on it beforehand; two switches into Stealth Rock will be enough. Also beware that Hidden Power Fire's usefulness is seriously hurt by the prevalence of rain teams. Hidden Power Ice is another viable choice for Celebi to hit Dragon-types, Thundurus-T, Gliscor, and both formes of Landorus for super effective damage, but Psychic is usually better for this role, as it has almost the same power as a super effective Hidden Power Ice. The only case where Hidden Power Ice is significantly stronger is against Pokemon 4x weak to it, or against Pokemon resistant to Psychic, meaning Latios, Latias, Hydreigon, Landorus, Landorus-T, Gliscor, Dragonite, Salamence, and Garchomp. Still, most of those targets are dealt with better by Thunder Wave or U-turn. Ultimately, Hidden Power Ice should be used only if not running Psychic, as Thunder Wave works way better with Psychic than Hidden Power Ice for the aforementioned reasons. Heal Bell lets Celebi act as a cleric, giving it yet another way to support its team. Baton Pass is an alternative to U-turn if you want to escape from slower Pursuit users, mainly Scizor and Tyranitar, but sometimes the extra damage from U-turn will be missed, and Baton Pass doesn't pair well with Perish Song, since you have to switch manually. A spread of 252 HP / 192 SpD / 64 Spe with a Calm nature can be used to outspeed Jolly Scizor so that it can either dent it with Hidden Power Fire or get out safely with U-turn. Celebi can also run a defensive set geared more towards Defense to help your team with threats such as Dragonite, Terrakion, Salamence, Conkeldurr, and to tank Pursuits from Scizor and Tyranitar more easily. Finally, a Sassy nature can be used in order for U-turn to pack a bit more of a punch. In this case, move the Speed EVs in whatever defensive stat benefits you the most.</p> <p>Heatran is possibly the best Celebi partner out there as it has almost flawless defensive synergy with it, with Rock being the only type that the two don't resist together, and also beats many Pokemon that can set up on Celebi or OHKO it, such as Scizor, Forretress, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Forretress works well with Celebi too, as it can set up on most Steel-types that threaten Celebi and get rid of their hazards. Rotom-W works amazingly with Celebi because it covers Celebi's Ice, Fire, and most importantly Flying weaknesses, meaning that it is a decent counter against Heatran, Celebi's arch enemy. Rotom-W can also deal with most Steel-types that Celebi attracts by either burning them or outright killing them. Lastly, the two together form a little VoltTurn core. Tentacruel is an interesting partner in rain, providing a reliable switch-in to Scizor, having good defensive synergy with Celebi, and getting rid of hazards that Steel-types love to set up against Celebi. Choice Scarf Tyranitar is another good partner with Celebi as the latter attracts Latios, Latias, Espeon, and Gengar for the first to trap. Choice Scarf Tyranitar also handles any Dragon-type that would like to switch into Celebi, as well as other offensive threats, such as Volcarona and Lucario, provided Celebi brings him in safely with U-turn. Gliscor or Landorus-T can handle or at least check any physical Dragon-type, Terrakion, Scizor, specially defensive Heatran, and opposing Landorus-T, all of which trouble Celebi, making it another good teammate. Gastrodon can check most Fire-types that threaten Celebi decently.</p> "

        "name": "Baton Pass",
        "description": "<p>While this might look like a dedicated Baton Pass set, in reality, it is a variation on the standard specially defensive Celebi. With its excellent defensive stats, reliable recovery, and Grass typing, Celebi takes on Water-types in rain as well as anything. Baton Pass is already a decent move on defensive Celebi even with nothing to pass, as it acts like U-turn while also allowing Celebi to escape Pursuit, so giving it a boosting move only requires a small investment--just one moveslot. Celebi is easily walled by a variety of Pokemon, as it lacks offensive investment and has STAB moves with poor neutral coverage. This set allows Celebi to do some real damage--by letting something else do it instead!</p> <p>As for which boosting move to use, that depends largely on your team. Nasty Plot is probably the best option, as Special Attack boosts are most useful to Celebi and Choice Scarf Keldeo is by far the best receiver available. Calm Mind might allow Celebi to set up multiple boosts, or at least set up on powerful special attackers at lower risk. Substitute is useful to a wider variety of Pokemon, but will usually be broken as Celebi passes. It's a lower risk, lower reward option. Don't forget, of course, that you don't have to use your boosting move every time you bring Celebi in. The priority should generally be to maintain Celebi's health such that it can continue to wall special attackers. Lastly, you need to choose which STAB move to use. With the exception of Tyranitar, Psychic typically does more damage to Celebi's counters, but Giga Drain is still a good option, as it hits Tyranitar and Water-types harder and the recovery provided is handy.</p> <p>While of course you want as much investment in Special Defense as possible, some investment in Speed is sensible. In order to escape from Scizor and Tyranitar, Celebi needs to go first, after all. 32 Speed EVs put Celebi ahead of all Tyranitar, while 64 EVs allow Celebi to outrun all Scizor. Especially with Calm Mind, even more Speed can be useful, as it allows Celebi to boost its Special Defense before taking a hit. As far as alternative moves go, Swords Dance is a decent option, which would be run alongside Zen Headbutt or Seed Bomb. The physical STAB moves are certainly less effective than the special ones, however.</p> <p>When picking your receivers, you should consider more than just which Pokemon would benefit the most from a boost to Special Attack or a Substitute. You need to consider which Pokemon are likely to switch into Celebi and which attacks they are likely to use. Most notably, Celebi attracts U-turn and Pursuit users, like Scizor and Tyranitar. Therefore, being able to take these moves comfortably is important. It's also worth noting that U-turn could leave your receiver facing a counter immediately--you want a receiver that is hard to counter, that can at least do some damage, even if it doesn't manage to sweep every time. The best receiver by far is Keldeo, particularly the Choice Scarf variant, thanks to its resistance to Dark and Bug, almost unmatched Speed, and phenomenal power. If rain should be up, virtually nothing short of a Water-immune Pokemon will stop it. Calm Mind receivers could perhaps even set up further; for example, an Agility Thundurus-T with boosts from both Calm Mind and Agility would be very potent. Receivers of Swords Dance can use priority moves for a potential sweep; Lucario, for instance, can do a lot of damage with +2 Extreme Speed, but often finds it tricky to set up a Swords Dance for itself (you should still give it Swords Dance though--receivers are best off self-sufficient). It's always worth packing a few decent recipients for flexibility. Remember, though, that this is a specially defensive Celebi first, so there are some great partners that are not necessarily the best receivers. Heatran, for instance, has typing that complements Celebi's perfectly from a defensive standpoint.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Celebi's good bulk and Special Attack, transforming it into an offensive tank. While at first glance it may seem inferior to Latias in the tank role, which boasts better typing, Speed, and coverage, Celebi is quite different due to its Grass STAB, Natural Cure, better physical bulk, ability to utilize Thunder Wave to a much greater extent than Latias, U-turn, Earth Power, and the ability to beat the most common Pursuit users, Tyranitar and Scizor. Leaf Storm is the primary move of the set and packs a lot of power due to the offensive investment, Life Orb, and STAB. The Special Attack drop might seem offsetting, as it makes Celebi set-up bait for a host of threats, but fits very well with this set's hit and run nature. Earth Power is used for coverage against Steel- and Fire-types, such as Heatran, Jirachi, and Ninetales, while hitting many Pokemon that resist Leaf Storm, such as Scizor, Forretress, and Volcarona for neutral damage. Psychic provides Celebi with a reliable STAB move to work with, while still covering some Pokemon that would want to switch into Leaf Storm. Some other targets of Psychic are Dragonite, Salamence, Breloom, and Thundurus-T (the latter two in particular are important as you can usually switch into them with little worry). Hidden Power Fire gives Celebi coverage against Steel- and Grass-types, the most important being Scizor, Ferrothorn, Breloom, and Forretress.</p> <p>In the next slot a utility move of your choice is chosen, allowing Celebi to act as a great team player. Thunder Wave works amazingly on Celebi, as no Ground-type would want to switch into it, almost making sure that something is going to get paralyzed. Thunder Wave also incapacitates some of the most common switch-ins to Celebi, namely Latios, Salamence, and Dragonite. However, U-turn makes Celebi's checks and counters take damage from entry hazards and U-turn itself, while getting forced out by your switch-in. U-turn also deals pretty good damage to some Pokemon weak to it, such as Tyranitar, Latios, Latias, and Celebi, and helps mitigate the Special Attack drops caused by Leaf Storm. Recover rounds off the set and enables Celebi to last throughout the match, as entry hazards and Life Orb recoil would take their toll pretty quickly on Celebi otherwise.</p> <p>Maximum Special Attack and a Modest nature allow Celebi to hit as hard as possible, while the Speed EVs enable it to outspeed everything up to maximum Speed Mamoswine. The rest of the EVs are thrown into HP for bulk. Life Orb gives Celebi some needed power, as base 100 Special Attack does not exactly make for a powerhouse, and makes Leaf Storm a force to be reckoned with if the opponent doesn't resist it; for example, it OHKOes 4 HP Garchomp 56.25% of the time after Stealth Rock, one of the most bulky offensive Pokemon in OU. On the other hand, Leftovers enhances Celebi's ability to take hits, and makes Celebi spend less time using Recover. Except for Leaf Storm and Recover, all the other slots are pretty flexible, so mix and match them depending on your team. If you decide to use two coverage moves, then the best combo is Psychic and Hidden Power Fire, to deal with most of Celebi's switch-ins, namely Ferrothorn, Scizor, and some Dragon-types. Giga Drain is a more reliable STAB move, and if using it, you can forgo Recover for an extra coverage move. However, the power drop is huge, as Leaf Storm has almost double the Base Power of Giga Drain, so you won't be able to dent most Pokemon that don't resist Grass like you could with Leaf Storm. Hidden Power Ice can be used to OHKO Dragonite (after Stealth Rock), Garchomp, Salamence, Gliscor, and both formes of Landorus, but Celebi already hits pretty hard, if not OHKOing, most of those Pokemon with Leaf Storm and Psychic. A more defensive spread of 236 HP / 252 SpA / 20 with a Modest nature can be used, as Celebi doesn't miss the extra Speed in a lot of situations. With that spread it is advised to use Thunder Wave to help Celebi outspeed faster foes. You can also use a spread with 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe and a Timid nature to Speed tie with neutral natured base 100s.</p> <p>Celebi enjoys partners that can deal with the Pokemon that its coverage moves don't cover, Chansey and Blissey, as well as any faster Pokemon that can revenge kill it. Such Pokemon are usually Dragon-types, Steel-types, and faster Pokemon with super effective moves such as Gengar and Alakazam. Specially defensive Celebi also walls this set if it lacks U-turn. Rotom-W is a great teammate that has excellent defensive synergy with Celebi, handling many Pokemon that threaten Celebi, such as Heatran, and forming a VoltTurn core. Heatran has flawless defensive synergy with Celebi, with only Rock-type moves not being resisted by those two, and takes care of Dragon-types to an extent, while countering Scizor and most Volcarona; Heatran also provides Stealth Rock which helps Celebi to get certain OHKOs and 2HKOs. Finally, Choice Scarf Terrakion is capable of revenge killing most of the Pokemon that scare Celebi out, while being able to switch in directly against some of them, such as Volcarona and Heatran, due to the good defensive synergy between Celebi and Terrakion, and is able to OHKO Blissey and dent Chansey, making it a valuable partner.</p> "

        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Celebi can take advantage of the many free switches that it gets against Pokemon such as Keldeo, Politoed, Rotom-W, and Sheer Force Landorus by either setting up with Nasty Plot or hitting hard the switch-in with the good neutral coverage provided by three attacking moves. Unlike the specially defensive set, this set has a lot of offensive pressure, and unlike the offensive set, this set has better coverage, Speed, and power (after a Nasty Plot). Without Nasty Plot it wouldn't be able to sweep because Steel-types, such as Jirachi and Scizor, could ordinarily take a hit and then cripple back, however at +2 they are OHKOed by the appropriate coverage move. Giga Drain is a solid STAB move which also restores Celebi's health, which can extend its sweep further. Earth Power mainly takes care of Heatran and Jirachi, while having a chance to OHKO Scizor and Forretress with Stealth Rock after a boost. Hidden Power Fire is used to get past most Steel- and Grass-types such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Psychic is a strong STAB move that allows Celebi to hit Dragonite, Salamence, and Thundurus-T for neutral damage, while also OHKOing Gengar and Breloom, making it the best move for the last slot. Recover helps Celebi to survive even longer and possibly enables it to try to sweep more than once. Lastly, Hidden Power Ice is able to OHKO Dragonite and Salamence without a boost, while hitting Latios, Latias, Hydreigon, and Thundurus-T hard, but is usually outclassed by Psychic.</p> <p>A bulkier spread can be used, with 220 HP / 180 SpA / 96 Spe and a Modest nature, where the Speed EVs allow Celebi to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Dragonite; with this spread Celebi has an easier time switching in and gets more set-up opportunities, but is then outsped by many offensive Pokemon that it could beat otherwise, such as Heatran and Ninetales. No matter what three attacking moves Celebi runs, it will always be walled by something, so keep that in mind. Baton Pass can be used to let Celebi pass the boost to a teammate when it is walled, acting as both a sweeper and a supporter. Leaf Storm is an option over Giga Drain for the immediate power, but you will find that it doesn't work so well with Nasty Plot, and often contrast with this set's purpose.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Scizor and Choice Scarf Terrakion work very well alongside Celebi, as they are able to handle most Pokemon that wall it while also revenge killing the Pokemon that can set-up on it or outright OHKO it. Tentacruel has good defensive synergy with Celebi while also providing Rapid Spin support and handling many Pokemon that Celebi fears, such as Scizor and Skarmory, if Celebi isn't running Hidden Power Fire. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can trap problematic Pokemon for Celebi, such as Gengar, Latios, and Latias, making it easier for Celebi to sweep. Specially defensive Jirachi makes for a good partner, as it can pass Wishes to Celebi, allowing it to try and sweep more than once, and checks many Pokemon that Celebi fears, namely Gengar, Latios, and Latias.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Celebi is a decent user of Choice Scarf due to its good Speed, bulk, and utility moves, namely U-turn and Trick. Leaf Storm is Celebi's main STAB move to dent Pokemon neutral or weak to it such as Keldeo, Terrakion, and Landorus. Hidden Power Ice is used mainly for the Dragon- and Flying-types that Celebi can outspeed and OHKO with it, while Hidden Power Fire deals with any Steel-type except Heatran. Earth Power handles Heatran, Lucario, Jirachi, Magnezone, and Infernape, and generally offers good neutral coverage with the other moves, while Psychic provides Celebi with a secondary STAB move that hits certain Pokemon such as Gengar and Breloom hard. Lastly, U-turn allows Celebi to scout while keeping momentum, while Trick cripples walls such as Blissey, Chansey, and Jirachi.</p> <p>A Modest nature can be used for more power, but Celebi will fail to Speed tie with +1 Speed base 100s, so keep this in mind.

Starmie, Forretress, and Tentacruel are capable of filling this role and have decent synergy with Celebi.

    "overview": "<p>Because of its offensive stats, coverage, and two fantastic abilities, Breloom keeps its title as one of the most powerful threats in BW OU, even if it can't use Spore anymore. While Technician turns Breloom into one of the most fearsome threats to balance teams, Breloom really shines with its Poison Heal sets, which let it counter all bulky Water-types by blocking status. However, Breloom has pitiful HP and Special Defense, mediocre base Speed, and the inability to fit all of the moves it wants on most of its sets.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stun Spore and Toxic can be used over Protect on Poison Heal sets or as the last move of the Choice Band set to spread status, but the shaky accuracy of Stun Spore and the lack of targets for Toxic make both mediocre options. Worry Seed can be used to defeat poisoned Gliscor and Reuniclus and to remove Amoonguss's Regenerator, but it doesn't have any other important targets. Other sets can be used if your team can afford a more customized Breloom: maximum Attack Superpower on a Poison Heal set gives Breloom greater offensive power alongside a surprise factor, but reduces Breloom's defensive utility versus Water-type Pokemon. A more defensive approach with Leech Seed and Protect or Substitute is also possible, but makes Breloom very passive versus Amoonguss, Celebi, and Reuniclus. Swords Dance sets with Technician alongside Life Orb or Fighting Gem were used a lot in the past, but the loss of Spore made them a lot easier to outplay. A Choice Scarf set can be used to grab surprise KOs against faster foes, especially Alakazam because of Bullet Seed, but the lack of Spore also makes this a very fringe option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Amoonguss: Amoonguss doesn't fear any STAB attacks from Breloom, can heal any damage it deals with Regenerator, and can heavily damage it back with Sludge Bomb. However, Amoonguss must watch out for Facade and Choice Band Stone Edge because it is slower than Breloom.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Reuniclus has enough bulk to take any hit from Breloom and threaten to KO it with Psychic. Celebi can take any move used by Breloom, heal with Recover, and threaten to KO Breloom with Psychic, set Stealth Rock, or get momentum with Baton Pass. Cresselia can shrug off Breloom's attacks with Reflect + Moonlight, deal decent damage with Psychic or Ice Beam, or steal Poison Heal with Skill Swap. Latios and Latias take little from Breloom's STAB moves, and Latios threatens to OHKO it back with Draco Meteor. Alakazam can't switch in directly, but it also threatens an immediate OHKO with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Defensive Flying-types like Skarmory, Gliscor, and Landorus-T take little damage from Breloom's STAB moves and can threaten to OHKO back with a STAB Flying-type move or set entry hazards. More offensive Flying-types like Tornadus, Dragonite, and Salamence can use Breloom to set up Substitute or Dragon Dance, or they can threaten an immediate OHKO with their STAB moves. Thundurus-T can use Breloom to set up Substitute and Agillity or immediately threaten it with Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: If using Facade, Breloom can't touch Ghost-type Pokemon like Jellicent and Gengar. However, they need to scout for a Grass-type move, since Seed Bomb 2HKOes Jellicent and heavily damages Gengar.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance is the preferred move to boost Breloom's Attack to insane levels and to immediately threaten Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Reuniclus. However, Bulk Up is an option if your team prefers a more controlled game pace, as it reduces damage from Excadrill's Iron Head and Keldeo's Secret Sword. Protect lets Breloom scout moves, activate Toxic Orb, and stall for Poison Heal recovery. Drain Punch contributes to Breloom's longevity by healing it while doing damage. The last slot is based on team preference: Facade is the best move to heavily damage bulky Pokemon like Amoonguss, Gliscor, and Reuniclus, while Seed Bomb targets Jellicent at the cost of not doing much damage to Latios, Celebi, Amoonguss, and Thundurus-T. If Breloom doesn't need the extra longevity from Drain Punch, Superpower can be used to have a stronger attack without needing any boosts.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>236 HP and 212 Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature maximize Breloom's bulk and Poison Heal recovery. 60 Speed EVs let Breloom outspeed standard specially defensive Heatran. Another possible EV spread is 236 HP / 36 Atk / 176 SpD / 60 Spe with an Adamant nature to OHKO standard Tentacruel with Facade after a Swords Dance.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avoid switching Breloom into Scald and Will-O-Wisp users before Toxic Orb has activated, as burns nullify Poison Heal. Because of this risk, leading with Breloom and using Protect Turn 1 is normally the best opening play possible. Use Breloom to steal momentum from Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W, which don't want to take any of Breloom's moves or give it a chance to freely set up. If your opponent has fast and powerful Breloom switch-ins like Latios and Thundurus-T, expect these Pokemon to switch in and use Facade on the switch to weaken them. Take advantage of Breloom's versatility as both a threat to balance teams with its setup options and a VoltTurn punisher that scares away Rotom-W and Ferrothorn, taking offensive momentum from your opponent throughout the game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Breloom set has very good synergy with sand teams, since Poison Heal removes the residual damage from sand and lets Breloom counter Pokemon that trouble this structure, like Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, Politoed, and Tentacruel. Tyranitar is an amazing partner, as it sets up sand and can Pursuit trap Psychic-types such as Latios, Latias, Reuniclus, and Alakazam. Good answers to Excadrill, like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Skarmory, are also very good options, since Sand Force-boosted Iron Head immediately threatens Breloom that have not boosted with Bulk Up. Latios, Alakazam, Reuniclus, Mamoswine, and Garchomp are some of the most common offensive Pokemon that capitalize on Breloom's wallbreaking. Breloom also functions on rain teams as a way to force out Rotom-W. Rain Pokemon like Politoed, Tentacruel, Starmie, Keldeo, and Jirachi have very good defensive and offensive synergy with Breloom. Jirachi and Breloom in particular cover each other's weaknesses.</p> "

Seed Bomb is the best option to hit Jellicent and heavily damage Tyranitar and Politoed without needing a Substitute.

Take advantage of Substitute + Protect, especially if there is no sand, to PP stall even Pokemon that could normally defeat Breloom like Latios, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. Do not be afraid to use Focus Punch behind Substitute, since even Pokemon that resist Fighting-type attacks receive massive damage from it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since this set forces a lot of switches from your opponent, its best partners are entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Skarmory for Spikes and Tentacruel for Toxic Spikes. Good Stealth Rock users like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Heatran, and Gliscor are also very good choices. If using Facade, Tyranitar is one of Breloom's best friends to Pursuit trap Jellicent. Scizor can Pursuit trap Psychic-types and safely bring in Breloom with U-turn. Other VoltTurn users are also amazing options. Pokemon that provide paralysis support, like Alakazam, Latias, and Jirachi, are very valuable, since full paralysis activating at the same time as Breloom sets up a Substitute has game-changing effects. If Breloom is using Seed Bomb, Psychic-types or strong special attackers, like Latios, Alakazam, Reuniclus, Hydreigon, and Tornadus, are needed to remove Amoonguss, which counters Breloom. If it is used outside of sand, remember to partner Breloom with weather-neutralizing Pokemon like Sunny Day Magnezone and Heatran so it can use the lack of sand damage to PP stall its foes.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Enter Salamence. This is a Pokemon that was deemed too powerful for DPP OU, which is a testament to just how good it is. That doesn't explain everything about Salamence's power, though. In Black and White, the Dream World gods decided for whatever reason that this already powerful Pokemon needed even more muscle, so they gave it Moxie. Thanks to this ability, Salamence will progressively become more difficult to wall. So, are you thinking you can just send out a physical wall and expect all your Salamence problems to go away? Well, that's not how it works. Salamence has great mixed attacking stats, so you should probably think twice before switching that physical wall in. Okay, so, what does Salamence struggle with then? Answering that question is simple. It faces a lot of competition from Dragonite, who is much bulkier thanks to its stats and access to Multiscale. Additionally, the once unrivaled MixMence now has to compete with the newcomer Hydreigon, who boasts a higher Special Attack stat and access to Superpower. Salamence is also easily revenge killed by Mamoswine and Choice Scarf users such as Keldeo. Rest assured, however; Salamence is guaranteed to be a formidable opponent on the battlefield.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Before considering any other Salamence set, you really need to ask yourself why you want to use it. The first thing that comes to mind is a Choice Specs set, but you really have no reason to use Choice Specs Salamence over Hydreigon or Latios, both of whom sport higher Special Attack. You could also pull off a Mixed Dragon Dance set similar to what it used in DPP Ubers, although the loss of Attack for Outrage is very noticeable; additionally, being walled by Heatran or Skarmory depending on your move choice is not very appealing. Thanks to Intimidate, Salamence seems like it could pull off a Bulky Dragon Dance set. This set is okay, but there's a Pokemon called Dragonite who has an ability called Multiscale that makes it more bulky and overall a better option. You could also run a Substitute set, which can abuse Moxie effectively and ease prediction against Steel-types. However, be aware that using Substitute in conjunction with Life Orb is counterproductive. Salamence can also run a bulky support set, but why would you use that over Dragonite?</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>If you're actually looking for a foolproof counter to Salamence, forget about it. There are none. However, some Pokemon can come close. Porygon2 is the closest you can get to a true counter thanks to its massive bulk with Eviolite, but with Stealth Rock and some prior damage (a common reality considering Porygon2 has no Leftovers), it will be 2HKOed by a combination of Draco Meteor and Outrage if Porygon2 Traces Moxie. However, if it Traces Intimidate, Porygon2 will always beat it. Hippowdon, Slowbro, Donphan, and Cloyster can all switch in on physical variants of Salamence, but they will lose to MixMence. Quagsire and Cresselia can take on physical variants of Salamence, but both have trouble against MixMence; in Quagsire's case, Salamence can actually take advantage of it as Unaware ignores the Special Attack drops from Draco Meteor. In Cresselia's case, Salamence will do a lot of damage with a combination of Draco Meteor and Outrage. Skarmory and Bronzong can both switch in easily if they are on Rain teams, though it should be noted that Salamence may be found on weather teams itself. Additionally, physical variants of Salamence do not like facing Landorus-T thanks to Intimidate.</p> <p>While countering Salamence is pretty much impossible, checking it is actually very easy. Choice Scarf users with greater than 100 base Speed, such as Terrakion, Latios, Keldeo, and Garchomp, all threaten Salamence immensely, and Choice Scarf users in this speed tier are very common. Mamoswine can also revenge kill it thanks to priority Ice Shard, no matter how many Speed boosts Salamence gets. Scizor can switch in and 2HKO Salamence with Bullet Punch while it's locked into Outrage. Similarly, Choice Band Dragonite 2HKOes with Extreme Speed, although Salamence needs to be heavily weakened if you're going to attempt to revenge kill it with Choice Band Dragonite. It should be noted that all of these revenge killers will have a hard time switching in, as they are all hit hard or OHKOed by the appropriate move.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Some may believe that they are wasting Salamence's massive offensive potential by giving it a Choice Scarf. In fact, it's quite the contrary. By utilizing Choice Scarf in tandem with Moxie, Salamence becomes both a great revenge killer and a deadly late-game sweeper. Outrage already hits hard, but add on some Moxie boosts and you've got a real powerhouse. However, going for Outrage early-game is about as smart as intentionally sticking your hand in boiling water. To get around that problem, this set also uses Dragon Claw for those times when Salamence shouldn't be locking itself into Outrage. Earthquake provides Salamence with coverage against Heatran and Jirachi; additionally, Earthquake hits Tyranitar hard without resorting to Outrage. In the last slot, Fire Blast is used to prevent Skarmory, Forretress, and Ferrothorn from having a field day. However, should you be running Salamence on a Rain team, it is better to run Aqua Tail instead in order to hit Pokemon such as Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Volcarona.</p> <p>This set should never be used without Moxie, as Intimidate is simply much less beneficial. Rock Slide is useful for OHKOing Volcarona, but otherwise doesn't do much else except for revenge killing weakened Thundurus-T. If Salamence is using Aqua Tail over Fire Blast, it should run a Jolly Nature, and the four Special Attack EVs should be moved to Special Defense. As Salamence may be switching in and out a lot, which means taking 25% from Stealth Rock, it is a good idea to run Rapid Spin users such as Starmie and Forretress alongside it. Additionally, Spikes support from Skarmory or Forretress can help it Salamence get the OHKOs it needs in order to prepare a sweep. Support from Magnezone and/or other Dragon-types is also helpful in order to weaken or eliminate Steel-types before Salamence goes for a late-game sweep.</p> "

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>Feast your eyes on one of the best Dragon Dance users in BW2 OU. With Dragon Dance, Moxie, and Outrage now legal on the same set, this already powerful set is now so powerful it's ridiculous. Outrage at +1 already hits everything that isn't a Steel-type hard, so how about a +2 Outrage, or even a +3 Outrage? Despite the sheer power behind Outrage, Dragon Claw is always a viable alternative in order to avoid being locked into your STAB move against a Steel-type. For covering said Steel-types, Earthquake is used for hitting Heatran and Jirachi, while Fire Blast is used in order to hit Skarmory, Forretress, and Ferrothorn. However, if Salamence is being used on a Rain team, Hydro Pump is an option to OHKO Gliscor after Stealth Rock; additionally, Hydro Pump still hits Skarmory and Forretress on their weak Special Defense.</p> <p>Unlike Choice Scarf Salamence, both abilities have their uses on this set. Intimidate brings Salamence more setup opportunities, but loses out on the powerful Moxie snowball effect. As for the item choice, Lum Berry is generally more useful as it allows Salamence to temporarily dodge status or get out of Outrage confusion for free. However, if using Dragon Claw over Outrage, it's probably best to use Life Orb as this increases damage output. When it comes to other items, the two that stand out the most are Dragon Gem and Yache Berry. Dragon Gem brings some extra power to its STAB, which may help kick-start the Moxie snowball effect. On the other hand, Yache Berry is an interesting item option which allows Salamence to avoid getting OHKOed by Mamoswine's Ice Shard.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Salamence has a couple more move options not yet mentioned. Aqua Tail is not as good on this set as it is on the Choice Scarf set, although it does have a notable advantage over Hydro Pump: Aqua Tail's power is boosted by Dragon Dance and Moxie boosts, while Hydro Pump's power is not. Roost is another option that allows Salamence to recover from Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock damage, although Salamence gets very few opportunities to successfully use Roost.</p> <p>Mamoswine is perhaps the greatest threat to this set as it can easily revenge kill Salamence with Ice Shard, regardless of how many boosts it has. Therefore, Salamence should have teammates that can beat it; Pokemon that can do so include Scizor, Keldeo, and Rotom-W. Additionally, Salamence greatly enjoys Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Starmie and Forretress because of its Stealth Rock weakness.</p> "

        "name": "MixMence",
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf and Dragon Dance variants of Salamence both have something in common, despite being completely different sets—they both hate facing Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Slowbro. So, the legendary MixMence returns, ready to take such physical walls and eat them for breakfast. By using Draco Meteor, physical walls that did so well against other variants of Salamence can no longer switch in on it. While Skarmory, Forretress, and Ferrothorn may think they are safe switching into Draco Meteors, they are definitely not going to switch in to Fire Blast thanks to their weaknesses to it. To finish it off, Earthquake is used to hit Heatran and Jirachi.</p> <p>The EV spread ensures every variant of Hippowdon is 2HKOed by this set, with maximum Speed to ensure a Speed tie with Volcarona, opposing Salamence, and other base 100s such as Celebi and Mew. Intimidate is a useful ability to help Salamence switch in on physical attacks, although Moxie powers up Outrage, which can be valuable. Dragon Dance can be used over Fire Blast or Earthquake in order to trick Pokemon such as Slowbro into thinking you're not a Mixed set, and potentially sweeping late-game.</p> <p>Of all the other moves MixMence can use, the two most notable are Roost and Brick Break. Roost allows it to recover from Life Orb recoil, although there are very few cases where Salamence can successfully use Roost. Brick Break hits Blissey and Chansey without resorting to Outrage, but without significant Attack investment and Stealth Rock, its low 75 Base Power doesn't even cut it against targets like Tyranitar.</p> <p>So, what should MixMence's teammates be? Well, you'll need Rapid Spin support because of that Stealth Rock weakness, so Starmie and Forretress are great partners. Additionally, sweepers who want walls like Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Jellicent weakened or removed appreciate MixMence's help tremendously. Sweepers that benefit from the weakening or removal of these walls include Agility Metagross, Swords Dance Lucario, Swords Dance Scizor, and Double Dance Terrakion.</p> "

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Although it faces competition from other Dragon-type special attackers in the tier, Salamence has the tools necessary to carve out a niche for itself. While it is outclassed in terms of Speed by Latios and Latias and raw power by Hydreigon, Salamence's mix of physical bulk with Intimidate, amazing coverage, surprise value, and resistances to common moves such as U-turn and Mach Punch allows it to use a specially attacking set to great effect in BW OU.</p> <p>Draco Meteor is Salamence's main STAB move, having great neutral coverage in the tier and hitting any Pokemon that doesn't resist it for heavy damage. Fire Blast is a great coverage move alongside Draco Meteor, being able to KO Steel-types that try to switch in on Salamence's Draco Meteor, such as Ferrothorn and Scizor, as well as roasting Grass-types like Breloom. Hydro Pump allows Salamence to lure and OHKO physical walls such as Hippowdon and Landorus-T, common switch-ins to Choice Scarf Salamence. It also allows Salamence to hit Tyranitar and Heatran for super effective damage. Finally, Roost increases Salamence's longevity and lets it make the most of its good bulk and typing by healing off damage from Life Orb recoil, resisted hits, and Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Salamence's Speed is maximized to make good use of its Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed threats such as Hydreigon and Kyurem-B. Salamence's Special Attack is also maximized with a Modest nature so it can hit as hard as possible. A Timid nature could be used, but Salamence generally needs all the power it can get to attain OHKOs against Pokemon such as Hippowdon and specially defensive Breloom.</p> <p>An alternative item, Expert Belt prevents Salamence from being worn down quickly by Life Orb recoil and allows it to bluff a Choice item while still retaining most OHKOs and 2HKOs it would get with Life Orb. However, it significantly decreases the power of Draco Meteor and requires entry hazards to be set up for Salamence to get certain OHKOs, making it a less viable option.</p> <p>This Salamence set appreciates Tyranitar as a teammate, as it can Pursuit trap Latios and Latias, which can outspeed and OHKO Salamence. Choice Band variants of Tyranitar can also threaten special walls such as Chansey and Blissey. In return, Salamence can check Fighting-types such as Breloom and also threatens Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, Gliscor, and Hippowdon, Pokemon that can usually switch into Tyranitar with ease. Breloom is another good partner, as it can help deal with bulky Water-types such as Jellicent, which can wall Salamence given enough Special Defense investment. It also deals with Chansey and Blissey and can threaten Rock-types, such as Terrakion, with Mach Punch. In return, Salamence can lure and beat physical walls such as Landorus-T and Skarmory and check Pokemon such as Amoonguss, which can hinder Breloom's attempts to sweep. Choice Scarf Jirachi is also a great partner for Salamence, as Jirachi can check fast threats such as Latios, Latias, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Terrakion, and it is free to spam Iron Head once Salamence lures and removes the physical walls that stop it.</p> "

  "Metagross": {
    "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced around the time BW was the main generation. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the current BW OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Metagross is a Pokemon with four important shortcomings. For starters, its typing grants it only mediocre STAB coverage, which prevents it from being able to brutalize some of the popular threats in the tier, such as Rotom-W and Skarmory. Secondly, a base 70 Speed stat is underwhelming in a fast-paced metagame, and many threats can outspeed and cripple Metagross before it does anything. Thirdly, four-moveslot syndrome is a problem for many Pokemon, but in Metagross's case, it can often leave one wishing desperately for a fifth moveslot; you'll want Thunder Punch for Gyarados and bulky Water-types, but it may not be worth giving up Hammer Arm, especially when you'll need STAB moves and Earthquake to cover your other threats. Finally, though it only has two weaknesses, both Fire- and Ground-type moves are commonly seen, notably on Volcarona and Landorus-T, which means Metagross's staying power is limited. These issues are not enough to keep Metagross down, however. It has the bulk to set up Stealth Rock quite easily and a gargantuan Attack stat to smash some heads in. The quad core supercomputer may have taken a hit in its effectiveness, but Metagross is still a great check to the myriad of Dragons locking themselves into Outrage.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Metagross has a plethora of other moves that can be programmed into its hard drive. First off, Gravity, while gimmicky, negates the Ground-type immunities of Skarmory, Rotom-W, and Bronzong. It turns those three serviceable counters into Earthquake fodder while patching up Meteor Mash and Zen Headbutt's accuracy. Trick can be utilized alongside either Choice Band or Choice Scarf to cripple a bulky wall, but Choice Scarf Metagross is rather mediocre. It requires a Jolly nature to be effective, and even then, it loses to Jolteon by one point. Choice Band Metagross is rather satisfied with its coverage moves and already has problems giving up a slot for Trick. You can also Trick an Iron Ball, but do bear in mind that it only removes Levitate, not a Flying typing, from a Pokemon.</p> <p>Hone Claws was briefly mentioned on the Agility set, but it can be used on its own as well. It does fix the accuracy issues of Meteor Mash and Zen Headbutt while also raising Metagross's Attack stat, but it certainly won't make Metagross faster. Be sure to have paralysis support or be able to Baton Pass an Agility boost or two to make the move worthwhile. Rock Slide also appreciates Hone Claws, but its usefulness is limited. It does retain coverage against Dragonite, Gyarados, and a good number of Fire-types, but its Base Power is quite low, and Earthquake is usually the better choice to combat Fire-types (particularly Heatran and Infernape). RestTalk might seem like a good idea, but Metagross's typing leaves it with underwhelming STAB moves, and switching out can be costly due to the sleep mechanics in this generation. In a similar vein, Reflect and Light Screen are best left to other Pokemon, such as Xatu and Espeon, who can block Taunt thanks to Magic Bounce.</p> <p>Magnet Rise sounds cool until you realize that its effects are temporary and that Metagross already suffers more than enough from four-moveslot syndrome. If you're really annoyed by Meteor Mash, there are two other options for a Steel-type STAB. The first is using Iron Head, which has a considerable power drop; it really should only be considered on the Agility set to take advantage of the flinch rate. The second is Gyro Ball, which forces Metagross to use an Iron Ball to become considerably slower and make it worthwhile. Block and Explosion with a Normal Gem can be used for a trapping Metagross. Finally, it has been mentioned that Metagross sports a good base 95 Special Attack. However, while STAB Flash Cannon and Psyshock / Psychic sound appealing, the only other special attacks available are Grass Knot, Shadow Ball, Icy Wind, Signal Beam, and Hidden Power. Aside from Hidden Power, a lot of Steel-types stop the combination cold too easily, and Metagross has no way to boost its Special Attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>How do you confound a supercomputer? You pit it against a slowpoke, otherwise known as Slowbro. The worst Slowbro can take is a Choice Band Thunder Punch, and even then, that damage is mitigated thanks to Regenerator and Slack Off. Slowbro can stay in and cripple Metagross with Thunder Wave, fire off repeated Scalds while fishing for the chance to burn it, or severely damage Metagross with Fire Blast. While it can't pierce Metagross's defenses, Skarmory is an able check, fearing only the rare Thunder Punch. While Brave Bird won't do anything, Skarmory can take the opportunity to set up Spikes or Whirlwind it away. With the combination of Substitute, Protect, and the ability Poison Heal, Gliscor is a source of grief for any Metagross lacking Ice Punch (and is one of the few reasons Metagross considers carrying the move at all). Choice Band Meteor Mash can clock in over 50% damage on Gliscor, so it must be wary of it, particularly if it lacks Roost. Rotom-W returns as twice the bugger that it was in DPP; because of its typing switch, Metagross can hit Rotom-W with Hammer Arm, but this combined with the dominant weather of rain make STAB Hydro Pump and STAB Thunder or Thunderbolt painful for Metagross to take. If that wasn't enough, Will-O-Wisp can completely eliminate any chance of Metagross carrying out a sweep. Zen Headbutt can be painful for Rotom-W to face, though, so it must be wary on the switch.</p> <p>While it can't switch into Earthquake and Hammer Arm, Heatran can prove to be troublesome to Metagross; it can burn Metagross with Will-O-Wisp, fish for the opportunity to burn with STAB Lava Plume, or go for the kill on offensive sets with STAB Fire Blast. Choice Band Metagross, in particular, must be careful in the presence of Magnezone, and Magneton. A wrong move can prove the end for Metagross. Donphan can stomach a Meteor Mash from a non-Choice Band Metagross and scare it away with STAB Earthquake. Mixed variants are risky due to their propensity to carry Grass Knot. Other bulky Water- and Steel-types can be a major pain to Metagross depending on its move choices. Rain-boosted Scalds can be annoying for Metagross to take, especially when there's a 30% chance for Metagross to have its Attack halved. Jellicent can Will-O-Wisp Metagross and use Recover to help keep itself alive. Steel-types, such as Ferrothorn and Forretress, can set up their entry hazards to further annoy Metagross's team. Ferrothorn can be a major drag with Leech Seed and the occasional Thunder Wave, while Forretress can take most hits from Metagross while wearing it down with Earthquake if it carries it.</p> <p>Weather teams are a particular nuisance to Metagross's sheen. Sun teams help in diminishing the power of Water-type moves, but it is a double-edged sword as it doubles Metagross's Fire-type weakness. Rain teams don't do it any favors either besides eliminating Metagross's Fire-type weakness. While comfortable in sandstorm, Metagross faces significant threats here. A max HP and Defense Impish Hippowdon can take most attacks from Metagross and either Slack Off the damage or threaten Metagross with STAB Earthquake.</p> ",

        "name": "Stealth Rock",
        "description": "<p>This is the standard set for Metagross in the OU metagame. Its typing and bulk allow it to set up Stealth Rock with ease. Afterwards, Metagross has the option of slugging an opponent with the bone-crushing power of Meteor Mash. In addition to being its STAB move of choice, the chance of raising Attack is always a boon for something with such a high Attack stat. In order to complement its bulk, Pursuit and Earthquake are added in the other moveslots. Latios and Latias are popular choices in OU, but their typings beg Metagross to switch in on a resisted hit and chase them down with Pursuit. This tactic is a useful one if they are locked in on a resisted move by a Choice item; it also helps out against Celebi and Gengar. Metagross can also be used to check Tornadus as it resists Hurricane and takes pitiful damage from Superpower.</p> <p>Earthquake has the benefit of smacking around Jirachi, who would otherwise wall Metagross and do as it pleases. It also serves as a deterrent to any Tentacruel trying to Rapid Spin entry hazards away and any Heatran not holding an Air Balloon on the switch. However, if one would prefer an easier time against Ferrothorn while keeping pressure on all manner of Heatran, Hammer Arm is an acceptable choice. Although you only neutrally hit Jirachi and now miss out on any meaningful damage against Tentacruel, you also have a better move to hit Rotom-W with as it switches in.</p> <p>In order to retain as much bulk as possible, Leftovers is really the only item to consider. Metagross is meant to lay down Stealth Rock when needed thanks to its handy resistances and excellent bulk. There are other choices if you would prefer to survive a super effective hit. An Occa Berry lessens the damage from Specially Defensive Heatran's Lava Plume and lets Metagross survive a Fire Blast from offensive Heatran. However, both are swiftly KOed by Earthquake anyway. When Occa Berry is paired with Rock Slide, it makes quick work of Volcarona attempting to set up and sweep. With a Shuca Berry and Ice Punch, Metagross can survive an Earthquake from Landorus-T most of the time and KO back. Ice Punch also lets Metagross hit Dragonite, Haxorus, Salamence, and Garchomp locked into Outrage. For an added bonus, Life Orb Salamence with no other boosts to its Attack fails to KO Metagross with Earthquake, dealing 70.05 - 82.96%; in other words, a healthy Metagross with the appropriate item can remain on the field and eliminate a threatening foe. Gliscor is also deterred from switching into Metagross. This should, however, only be considered if Metagross isn't being used to KO Pokemon with Pursuit or if you have solid checks to Calm Mind Jirachi. Air Balloon can be used instead of Shuca Berry to give Metagross a temporary immunity; meanwhile, a Lum Berry can be used to shake off an annoying burn from the likes of Tentacruel's Scald. However, these one-time use items are inferior to Leftovers in ensuring a long-lasting supercomputer.</p> <p>If you wish for more Attack, consider an older spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe. You lose special bulk but gain more power behind your attacks. There is also the option of outrunning 0 Spe Heatran by distributing 60 EVs into Metagross's Speed, thus enabling it to get the jump on Heatran for the quick KO. If you wish to take Metagross in a more suicidal role, Normal Gem plus Explosion can be considered with max Attack EVs for a near OHKO on Gliscor switch-ins, dealing 84.18% - 99.15%; with Stealth Rock on the field, Explosion would have a 75% chance to OHKO. Life Orb can give Metagross more power behind its moves, but longevity is thrown out of the window. Bullet Punch is an option to let Metagross revenge kill threats such as Mamoswine and Weavile. Unfortunately, it just doesn't hit very hard even with STAB and that awesome 135 Attack stat backing it.</p> <p>Skarmory and Forretress are the largest pests for Metagross. Because it rarely carries Thunder Punch, Skarmory can come in on Metagross and set up Spikes or simply Whirlwind it away; Forretress fears very little from Earthquake, can also set up entry hazards of its own, and can simply Rapid Spin away Metagross's Stealth Rock. It can even deal some damage with an Earthquake of its own. Donphan's great Defense and high HP make it an excellent switch-in, and it can spin Stealth Rock away, set up its own, or wallop Metagross with STAB Earthquake. Bulky Water-types, such as Vaporeon and Jellicent, can take repeated Hammer Arms and Earthquakes and burn with Scald (or, in Jellicent's case, Will-O-Wisp); rain-boosted Scald makes the situation a little more dangerous. In terms of offensive Pokemon, Life Orb Starmie's Hydro Pump deals 53.84 - 63.46% outside of the rain and 80.76 - 95.32% in the rain. With all of these Pokemon factored in, Celebi is a great partner for Metagross. Hidden Power Fire takes care of Skarmory and Forretress, while STAB Giga Drain or Leaf Storm makes easy work of the myriad of Water-types and Donphan. If Celebi carries Hidden Power Ice, Gliscor is also easily taken care of, as defensive Celebi is capable of a 2HKO (dealing 72.31 - 85.87% damage). It should be noted that Leaf Storm also does a good number to Gliscor, with offensive versions of Celebi capable of an OHKO. Thunder Wave support also helps Metagross take on faster threats.</p> <p>If you're playing with Metagross in the rain, Thundurus-T and Tornadus can shred most of these Pokemon with their STABs while possibly switching in freely thanks to their immunity to Earthquake. If you're using Tornadus, it needs Focus Blast for Skarmory, though standard Skarmory also loses to a combination of Taunt and Hurricane. Choice Scarf Terrakion can revenge kill a +1 Volcarona and can put some dents in some of the bulky Water-types. Rotom-W complements Metagross nicely; Rotom-W takes away some of the pain of dealing with bulky Water-types, resists Fire-type attacks, and is immune to Ground-type attacks thanks to Levitate. Meanwhile, Rotom-W appreciates Metagross's resistance to Grass-type attacks from foes such as Celebi (provided Celebi also lacks Earth Power or Hidden Power Fire). Finally, the usual support that helps most Pokemon is greatly appreciated, such as Wish support from the likes of Vaporeon or Latias, entry hazards in the form of Spikes provided by Ferrothorn, and spinblocking from Jellicent or Sableye. The latter two can also provide burn support, lessening the damage taken from physical Ground-type attacks.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>If you'd prefer to hit like a nuke right off the bat, this Metagross set is programmed to do just that. As mentioned before, base 135 Attack is horrifying to face, and Metagross wields nearly unmatched power when equipped with a Choice Band. Meteor Mash remains Metagross's primary STAB move, hitting a great number of opponents hard. The chance to raise its Attack, though rare, makes the prospect of attaining further boosts beyond Choice Band possible. Bullet Punch might seem somewhat redundant with Metagross wielding a much more powerful STAB move, but there are a few good reasons it belongs on this set. Though weaker than CB Scizor's Bullet Punch, it is still strong enough to deal significant damage to potential threats such as Mamoswine and Terrakion. It also serves as a way to bypass Metagross's underwhelming Speed, allowing it to double as a revenge killer. As a better choice for hitting Mamoswine and Terrakion—not to mention Jirachi and Heatran—on the switch, Hammer Arm takes precedence in the third spot. The Speed drop can also be beneficial in one-on-one situations with Skarmory. If Skarmory decides to Roost, a Choice Band Hammer Arm will deal 64.07 - 75.44% damage.</p> <p>In the final slot, there are three possibilities. Zen Headbutt serves as a secondary STAB move and makes sure Conkeldurr doesn't survive. It also serves to batter bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Rotom-W. In addition, it is the best choice to combat Volcarona aside from the rare Rock Slide. If such threats are covered by another teammate, Pursuit can be used to increase Metagross's utility value; if you opt for Pursuit, though, it is recommended you go with maximum HP EVs. Finally, Thunder Punch is an option to hit Slowbro while maintaining coverage on both Skarmory and Jellicent. The given EV Spread also lets Metagross outrun defensive Gyarados, making Thunder Punch a viable commodity for a quick KO. However, do note that Metagross will then have more difficulty against Gastrodon and no guarantee of a 2HKO against Slowbro; Thunder Punch deals 47.71 - 56.34% damage to Slowbro, so Stealth Rock damage is required for the guaranteed 2HKO.</p> <p>Ice Punch is viable to hit an incoming Gliscor or Garchomp hard. It is also a more reliable option to hit Dragon-types locked into Outrage. Though the nerf to it from BW is a bit disappointing, a Choice Band Explosion is not to be scoffed at, leaving a massive dent in or outright KOing Pokemon that don't resist it. Trick is also an option if you want to cripple a wall, but Metagross appreciates the boost provided by Choice Band too much to want to lose it. Trick is better served on a set with Choice Scarf in any case.</p> <p>Slowbro is one of the best counters to Metagross as it only fears Thunder Punch. Pursuit does mediocre damage unless Slowbro switches out; in any case, due to Regenerator, Slowbro can easily recover off any damage taken by simply fleeing. Bulky Steel- and Water-types can switch into a predicted Meteor Mash or Bullet Punch and take advantage of the situation quickly with entry hazards, STAB Scalds, or Will-O-Wisp. Heatran can easily incinerate Metagross with Fire Blast. Because this Metagross locks itself into one move, it is susceptible to being revenge killed, particularly from trappers such as Magnezone, and Magneton.</p> <p>With these problems in mind, entry hazard support, particularly Stealth Rock, is essential in keeping the KOs consistent. Celebi comes to mind yet again, easily handling Slowbro and other bulky Water-types thanks to STAB Leaf Storm or STAB Giga Drain. It also has access to Earth Power, which can help out against Heatran in spite of sharing the same weakness to Fire as Metagross. Psychic prevents Substitute + Protect Gliscor from impeding Metagross while also combating troublesome bulky Fighting-types such as Bulk Up Conkeldurr. Celebi can even set up Stealth Rock on its own if it needs to support its team or use Heal Bell if Metagross is crippled with a burn. Rotom-W is another great partner because it breaks bulky Water-types as well as most Steel-types thanks to its excellent dual STABs. Being immune to Earthquake and resisting Fire-type attacks provides great type synergy with Metagross, who returns the favor with its resistance to Grass-type attacks. On the offensive side, Hydreigon is a great Pokemon to pair with Metagross; while Fire Blast can possibly be nerfed in the rain, Hydreigon carries two powerful STAB types that rip through most of Metagross's issues. In return, Metagross handles the faster, frailer Pokemon that threaten Hydreigon and takes Ice-type attacks. Surf can also be used if you're pairing Metagross and Hydreigon with a rain team. While an awkward pairing, Magnezone can trap some of the troublesome Steel-types that plague Metagross's stampede while handling bulky Water-types nicely.</p> "

        "name": "Agility",
        "description": "<p>Agility makes Metagross run twice as fast, and with a Jolly nature, it enables Metagross to outspeed Choice Scarf Terrakion. Combine this with Metagross's awesome resistances to most priority attacks and you have a very scary sweeper for opponents to handle, especially if they also happen to be running a fully offensive team. Zen Headbutt is the primary STAB move in order to nail Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, Virizion, and Keldeo while preventing Conkeldurr from setting up any Bulk Ups. It also carries a somewhat useful 20% flinch rate that can come in handy in a pinch. Earthquake prevents Heatran and Jirachi from stopping your sweep, as both would be able to take on any other move Metagross would otherwise carry. Meteor Mash rounds out the set, providing a much more powerful hit against the likes of Latios and Latias, while Tyranitar and Mamoswine are easily dispatched by the powerful STAB move. The chance of gaining an Attack boost (which shouldn't be relied on) only furthers the prospect of a very scary sweeper indeed.</p> <p>The given spread enables a +2 Metagross to outspeed a positive natured base 108 Speed Pokemon wielding a Choice Scarf. This group includes the Musketeer trio, Keldeo, and Infernape. Unfortunately, it falls one point short of a Speed tie with positive natured base 110 Speed Pokemon with Choice Scarf such as Gengar, Latios, and Latias. However, should any of those bring along Hidden Power Fire, Metagross will outspeed them by one point. Alternatively, one could run an Adamant nature instead. This makes Ice Punch a viable choice versus defensive Gliscor as it is guaranteed an OHKO with the aid of Stealth Rock. The increase in power comes at the cost of only outspeeding positive natured base 95 Speed Pokemon carrying Choice Scarf, though.</p> <p>Ice Punch is only noteworthy because Gliscor can be a major pain for a team to take out. If used over Zen Headbutt, Keldeo becomes a serviceable check to Metagross. It also equals Meteor Mash's Base Power if Meteor Mash hits neutrally and Ice Punch hits for 2x super effective damage. Thunder Punch can be considered over Zen Headbutt if you're completely desperate to hit bulky Water-types or Starmie during the sweep. On that topic, Thunder Punch is really only useful against Starmie and Gyarados as Starmie can take an Earthquake and put a severe dent in Metagross with a Life Orb-boosted Hydro Pump. Gyarados is immune to Earthquake and resists Meteor Mash, so it utilize its decent bulk to KO a weakened Metagross. Slowbro will still laugh at the damage taken from Thunder Punch and easily heal or deal significant damage to Metagross. This is also true for Adamant variants, given that Slowbro only takes up to 48.73% damage from an Adamant Life Orb Thunder Punch.</p> <p>Bulky Steel-types and bulky Water-types such as Slowbro really prove to be a pain to this Metagross. This is emphasized heavily because this Metagross is attempting to sweep teams. In fact, any teams that have considerable amounts of bulk—particularly Stall teams—are going to give Metagross hell, especially since it can't always rely on a boost to its Attack. Gliscor, once again, sticks out its tongue at Metagross; as this is the least flexible set, Ice Punch is even less feasible, though Meteor Mash can still hit Gliscor for decent damage. Slowbro and Skarmory carry the award for \"biggest blocks\" to this Metagross set, especially if it lacks Thunder Punch. Celebi is once again a premier partner, being able to set up Stealth Rock and clear out bulky Water-types. Hydreigon also partners well because it carries Fire Blast and/or Earth Power for Steel-types and scares Slowbro away with STAB Dark Pulse. Rotom-W's synergy with Metagross proves useful yet again, crippling Scizor with Will-O-Wisp and creating an opening for Metagross to set up Agility on the weakened bug. Its Electric typing is a boon too, clearing the path of most Water-types in a similar manner to Celebi, not to mention handling most Steel-types thanks to STAB Hydro Pump.</p> <p>Entry hazards are necessary in order to make the most of this particular set. When it comes to setting up entry hazards, Crustle is probably your best bet; it doesn't share the nasty weaknesses that Metagross, Hydreigon, and Rotom-W suffer from and can also set up Stealth Rock if necessary. Magnezone can prove to be a huge help for Metagross since it traps the nasty Steel-types that otherwise nerf this set even harder. In fact, Steel trappers in general aren't a bad idea to carry for Metagross's team as they can help make sweeps easier by removing most of the problematic Pokemon. Wobbuffet has an added bonus of using Encore to lock a Pokemon onto a move that Metagross can, more than likely, set up on.</p> "

        "name": "Mixed",
        "description": "<p>This set is a rather interesting twist on the normal Metagross, making use of that nice base 95 Special Attack. In doing so, it allows it to beat some of its counters. Meteor Mash should be familiar to many at this point as it is Metagross's most powerful STAB move. Because most Steel-types are comfortable taking an Earthquake or Hammer Arm, they forget about Metagross's special moveset. Hidden Power Fire handles most of these problems, 2HKOing Physically Defensive Skarmory and Ferrothorn while OHKOing both Physically Defensive Forretress and Scizor. Specially Defensive Skarmory has a 66.41% chance of being 2HKOed by Hidden Power Fire, while Specially Defensive Forretress requires Stealth Rock on the field for the guaranteed OHKO. This combo is resisted by bulky Water-types, though, so Grass Knot makes for a nasty surprise. It is useful for the 2HKO achieved on physically bulky Pokemon such as Jellicent, Slowbro, and Hippowdon. In the final slot, another physical attack is the best choice, with Zen Headbutt easily dispatching Conkeldurr and Tentacruel. It is also the better choice against Rotom-W, who laughs at every other move Metagross throws at it, even Grass Knot. If you'd rather take on Heatran and Jirachi, Earthquake is an option. It also retains super effective coverage against Tentacruel.</p> <p>The given spread enables Metagross to remain an offensive presence, both physically and specially. If you wish to outspeed specially defensive Heatran, 60 Speed EVs are necessary; it is best to pull those from Metagross's Attack EVs. This also makes Earthquake the better move in the fourth slot. If you would prefer to take care of Gliscor and Garchomp more easily, Ice Punch is available. However, this makes Rotom-W difficult to defeat, as Grass Knot will not be hitting it hard enough. This also makes Heatran a rock-solid counter.</p> <p>Expert Belt is an option to retain Metagross's durability in the long run. However, recall that the boost from Expert Belt is only granted if a move hits super effectively. As mentioned previously, Heatran or Rotom-W will really hamper this set. Gliscor can too without Ice Punch, and lack of Zen Headbutt or Earthquake also makes Tentacruel laugh at Metagross. Therefore, depending on what Metagross brings to the table, it needs these potential threats taken care of. Tyranitar or Hydreigon can handle Heatran well enough, as both carry moves that severely dent it. Tyranitar must be wary of the potential burn, which can cut the power of Earthquake or Low Kick. Tyranitar gets the added bonus of keeping Hidden Power Fire's Base Power intact, eliminating infinite rain thanks to Sand Stream. Hydreigon with Surf or Draco Meteor can easily crush most variants of Gliscor. Celebi, meanwhile, handles Rotom-W nicely. If it carries Psychic it becomes a deterrent to any Tentacruel attempting to wall Metagross.</p> "

  "Latias": {
    "overview": "<p>Since Latias was unbanned in Black and White, her performance has generally been unimpressive. It is not hard to see why, however, since her brother Latios and newcomer Hydreigon are the general go-to Pokemon for \"powerful special attacking Dragon-type\". What a lot of people overlook is Latias's higher defenses, which allow her to play a more effective support role. With new threats such as Thundurus-T and Keldeo being introduced in Black and White 2, Latias is one of the few Pokemon that can take them on while still remaining an offensive threat in the long run. Her resistances to common attacking types, namely Water, Electric, Grass, Fire, Psychic, and Fighting, as well as an excellent Ground immunity, allow her to switch in easily and put a stop to many potential threats. When her counters are removed, she can easily sweep late game. However, problems do still exist. Her Psychic typing, which grants her the excellent Fighting-type resistance, is a double-edged sword, as it makes her vulnerable to Pursuit. Her inability to hurt common Spikers such as Ferrothorn outside of weak Hidden Powers make her a big target for Spikes-stacking teams as well. Still, as long as you play Latias carefully, there will generally be a place for her on virtually any team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Latias can run a pure support set with Wish and Roar, but her relatively low HP stat means she's generally outclassed in such a set by Blissey, Chansey, Jirachi, and Vaporeon. Latias can also use a Choice Scarf set, but is such a set is largely outclassed by Latios, who boasts the higher firepower required for revenge killing various Pokemon. If Latias is to use a Choice Scarf, it is a good idea to use Healing Wish on it to differentiate herself from Latios, allowing her to pull off a fast revival of a crippled teammate in a pinch. Latias can even run a very gimmicky physical set with Hone Claws / Outrage / Earthquake / Sucker Punch, but is outclassed by pretty much every physical Dragon-type in OU.</p> <p>Latias has a number of other moves she could use. Hidden Power Fighting can be used to hit Tyranitar harder than all of her other moves, but since it still doesn't do that much to Tyranitar, Latias is better off with her other options. Psycho Shift and a Flame Orb can be used to spread burns, but Latias generally has better things to do than that. Similarly, Latias can use Rain Dance or Sunny Day as a backup weather inducer, but this is generally unnecessary. Reflect Type is an interesting option to put on the Calm Mind set, as it allows Latias to copy the typings of her counters and hopefully resist their attacks, but is very easily played around. Safeguard can be used to block status, but Substitute and Refresh are generally better options because they are not turn-limited. Safeguard does, however, allow Latias to prevent paralysis from specially defensive Jirachi without having to predict between Substitute and Recover.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Tyranitar is definitely Latias's number one enemy. It takes little from any of her attacks, even Hidden Power Fighting, and checkmates her with Crunch and Pursuit. Even if Latias uses Reflect and invests heavily in her physical defense, she will generally lose to it. Blissey and Chansey are probably the next on the list, since they do not take much from any of Latias's attacks and can cripple her with Toxic. They will need to watch out Trick, though. Specially defensive Jirachi laughs at Latias's assaults and can paralyze her with Body Slam or Thunder Wave, then proceed to flinch her to death with Iron Head. Ferrothorn easily takes on any Latias that doesn't use Hidden Power Fire (which won't even do much in rainy weather) and can use Leech Seed and Gyro Ball to take her out. Be aware of Substitute + Calm Mind variants, however, since skilled Latias players would be able to stall out Gyro Ball and then proceed to set up in Ferrothorn's face. If Latias lacks Hidden Power Fire, Scizor will make Latias cry by checkmating her with U-turn and Pursuit. Aside from Hidden Power Fire, Scizor will also have to watch out for a rain-boosted Surf or Thunder from the offensive set, as they hurt substantially. If Latias lacks Surf, Heatran can use Roar to force Latias out or cripple it with Toxic, while Skarmory can do a similar job if she uses Substitute or Psyshock as her secondary moves.</p> <p>Latias is generally difficult to revenge kill on the special side due to her huge special bulk. Physically, however, she is much more vulnerable, which means she can be revenge killed by Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Garchomp, Salamence, and Kyurem-B. Mamoswine can pick off weakened Latias with Ice Shard, while the rare Weavile can checkmate her with any of Ice Punch, Night Slash, or Pursuit.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<p>This set may seem more suited for Latios, which sports a much higher Special Attack stat. However, Latias's higher bulk allows her to come into play more often and dish out powerful hits. While Latios is a powerful wallbreaker, Latias is more of an offensive pivot and special tank. Even without investing in Special Defense, Latias is still bulky enough to take special attacks without much fear. She can easily take a Hidden Power Ice from Life Orb Thundurus-T and OHKO with Draco Meteor. One common complaint is that Latias is too weak initially, needing at least two Calm Minds to hit relatively hard. However, with maximum investment to Special Attack and holding a Life Orb or Choice Specs, Latias is still extremely powerful. Do not forget that it was her Choice Specs set that got her banned in DPP—Draco Meteor smashes everything that does not resist it. Psyshock is the preferred move in the second slot as it KOes Fighting-types, most notably Keldeo and Terrakion. Surf is the generally the best coverage move in the third slot, as it gets pseudo-STAB in the rain, as well as letting Latias KO Landorus-T without having to resort to Draco Meteor. However, Hidden Power Fire is also perfectly acceptable, as it lets Latias OHKO Scizor when it's not raining and allows Latias to deal lots of damage to Ferrothorn. It works even better if you are using a sun team, since it gets a boost in the sun.</p> <p>Life Orb is generally the preferred item since it allows her to switch attacks and use Roost to stick around for longer. However, the extra power that Choice Specs brings is hard to ignore. For example, with Choice Specs equipped, Latias has a very high chance of OHKOing offensive Dragonite through Multiscale with Draco Meteor, as well as OHKOing Conkeldurr with Draco Meteor. It also allows Latias to cripple walls with Trick.</p> <p>If you are using a rain team, Thunder is a very powerful alternative to Psyshock, as it does a lot of damage to bulky Water-types and many Steel-types as well as still doing heaps of damage to Keldeo without having to resort to Psyshock. It also carries a 30% paralysis rate. The last moveslot should depend on what item Latias is equipped with. Roost is Latias's best option if Life Orb is used, since it would allow her to switch in repeatedly and recover lost health. Trick is the preferred move if Choice Specs is equipped, to allow Latias to cripple walls. If neither of these moves appeal to you, Dragon Pulse can be used as a reliable Dragon-type STAB attack. In terms of other coverage moves, Thunderbolt can be used if you don't find Thunder reliable enough, while Hidden Power Fighting can be used to hurt Tyranitar.</p> <p>The EV spread used is just a simple 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe spread, with a Timid nature to outspeed all the Fighting-types that sit at base 108 Speed, as well as Thundurus-T and all the Pokemon at base 100 Speed, while still hitting as hard as possible. Max Speed and a Timid nature is essential to outpace all those threatening Pokemon, but Latias can slide some her Special Attack into HP depending on how bulky you want her to be, all the way up to a spread of 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe.</p> <p>Tyranitar and Scizor still cause huge problems for Latias, especially after a Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor, although Scizor needs to watch out for Hidden Power Fire as well as rain-boosted Surf. Specially defensive Steel-types such as Jirachi and Ferrothorn (especially in the rain) can give Latias trouble as well. Chansey can take Psyshock all day and stall Latias out, but must watch out for Trick. Garchomp is an excellent Pokemon to take on all of the aforementioned threats, especially Jirachi. Other physical attackers that can take out Chansey and most of Latias's threats include Landorus-T, Terrakion, and Gyarados. Heatran is also a good Pokemon to switch into the aforementioned Steel-types. Magnezone is useful for trapping Ferrothorn with Substitute and Charge Beam. Since many bulky Steel-types in OU carry entry hazards, Rapid Spin users are always welcome on a team with Latias, including Tentacruel, Forretress, Starmie, and Donphan.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>This set is probably the one that takes the most advantage of Latias's fabulous qualities. Her respectable Special Attack, base 110 Speed, and fantastic Special Defense allow her to switch in repeatedly over the course of a match to either take hard hits or to set up for a sweep. She is probably the only Pokemon in OU that can check all of Keldeo, Breloom, Infernape, Terrakion, Thundurus-T, and a variety of sun and rain sweepers at the same time, all the while remaining a long-term offensive threat. One thing to always remember is that Latias is not a Pokemon that you would pull out and immediately try to sweep with, but is instead used to defend against the aforementioned threats and only attempt to sweep when all her counters have been eliminated. Unlike Latios, who specializes in immediate firepower, Latias is better known for her role as a supporting sweeper. Calm Mind and Roost allow Latias to switch in constantly into many threats while boosting her Special Attack as well as her already massive Special Defense repeatedly. Dragon Pulse is her main STAB attack. The last move is extremely variable, and depends on what role Latias is playing in the team and what kind of EV spread she is running.</p> <p>Calm Mind Latias is one of those sets that can have all sorts of variation, depending on what role she is playing on the team. The set shown above presents the most balanced option. The EV spread used allows Latias to take two Choice Specs-boosted Icy Winds from Keldeo after Stealth Rock damage, while maintaining maximum Speed to outspeed all the Pokemon in the base 108 Speed tier. Substitute is the preferred option in the last slot, not only to avoid status and Leech Seed, but also to protect herself from Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Scizor. It also potentially stalls out Gyro Ball from Ferrothorn, allowing her to set up with relative impunity. Hidden Power Fire allows Latias to deal a lot of damage to both Scizor and Ferrothorn, who both give her a lot of trouble. Be aware that the imperfect IV used for Hidden Power Fire would mean she can no longer speed-tie with other Pokemon that sit on 110 base Speed. Psyshock, on the other hand, allows Latias to deal with Fighting-types, especially Keldeo in a Calm Mind war, more easily. While Latias has no problem against Choice-locked Keldeo, she may run into problems against Calm Mind Keldeo if she does not run Psyshock, as Secret Sword bypasses Latias's special bulk, and will be able to take her down if Keldeo has obtained enough boosts.</p> <p>Latias can also use a more defensive set. With an EV spread of 252 HP / 228 Def / 28 Spe and a Bold nature, she can take Fighting-types on a lot more easily, especially Breloom and Choice Band Terrakion. The EV spread allows her to outspeed max speed Pokemon with base 70 Speed using a positive nature, such as Timid Politoed and Jolly Breloom. If you do decide to use this spread, decent options in the last slot are generally support moves. Reflect allows Latias to cushion Pursuit, as well as potentially set up on Tyranitar that do not use Crunch and do not invest much in Attack. Substitute is again a very good option on physically defensive Calm Mind Latias, as well as Roar to force out set-up sweepers such as Calm Mind Reuniclus. Refresh is another option, as it allows Latias to heal status such as burns from switching into Scald, as well as allowing her to set up on Blissey and Chansey much more easily. However, being unable to block Leech Seed, while not giving her Pursuit and U-turn protection generally makes Refresh an inferior option to Substitute. The main reason that such a spread is not as recommended as the primary spread shown above is because Latias is generally too slow with this spread. The metagame has many fast threats that Latias desperately needs to outspeed in order to defeat them, such as Nasty Plot Thundurus-T and Keldeo.</p> <p>Another way to run Calm Mind Latias is to run a fully offensive set. With an EV spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe, a Timid nature and a moveset of Calm Mind / Dragon Pulse / Hidden Power Fire / Grass Knot can be used. While this may be completely outclassed by Latios, this set really shines when used in tandem with her brother. There are two ways to use such a set. One is to use Latios to severely weaken Latias's counters so Latias can roll through later, or to equip a Colbur Berry on Latias, allowing her to deal major damage to Latios's counters, namely Tyranitar, Jirachi, Ferrothorn, and Scizor. This would allow Latios to follow up and sweep unimpeded. Obviously, there are downsides to such a strategy, since both Latias and Latios share the same typing and very similar stats, making your team doubly weak to whatever counters both Latias and Latios.</p> <p>Pursuit is definitely Latias's worst enemy, and generally comes from either Tyranitar or Scizor. Even with Substitute, it is difficult to avoid getting Latias trapped consistently, since prediction does go both ways. This is why Fighting-types are excellent teammates to use alongside Latias to set up on Pursuit users. Lucario, Terrakion, Keldeo, Breloom, Infernape, Virizion, and Conkeldurr are all excellent contenders. Intimidate users are also good, as well as physically bulky set-up sweepers and Steel-types, such as Gyarados, Landorus-T, Salamence, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Scizor. In exchange, Latias resists most of their weaknesses and tanks special hits without much trouble at all.</p> <p>Other Pokemon that give Latias trouble are bulky Steel-types such as Scizor, as well as Blissey and Chansey. Ferrothorn is the next biggest culprit, as it takes little from any of Latias's moves, even Hidden Power Fire if it is raining, and can respond with Leech Seed and Gyro Ball while setting up hazards at will. If Latias has Substitute, she can, with good prediction, PP stall out Gyro Ball and set up in Ferrothorn's face, but this is rather risky play all the same. Specially defensive Jirachi takes very little from Latias's attacks and can use Body Slam to paralyze her, then take her out with Iron Head. If Latias lacks Surf, Heatran also resists most of her options, while being able to phaze her with Roar or cripple her with Toxic. For this reason, Dugtrio and Magnezone are good teammates for Latias in order to trap and remove the Steel-types that most trouble her and her team. Dugtrio can OHKO Heatran and heavily damage Jirachi, as well as taking out Tyranitar. Magnezone, on the other hand, can trap and OHKO Scizor and Skarmory, and as long as it avoids Leech Seed or Thunder Wave, it can trap and set up on Ferrothorn using Substitute and Charge Beam. Since many of these bulky Steel-types pack entry hazards, Rapid Spin users are also good teammates. Tentacruel is a Rapid Spin user that synergizes well with Latias, as it resists Latias's Ice-type and Bug-type weaknesses, while Latias resists or is immune to all of Tentacruel's weaknesses. Forretress also synergizes well with Latias due to its resistance to physical Dragon-type attacks, as well as U-turn and Crunch. Other decent Rapid Spin users include Donphan and Starmie. As for Blissey and Chansey, the aforementioned physical attackers can easily set up on them.</p> "

        "name": "Dual Screens",
        "description": "<p>Latias's natural bulk and speed make her a solid dual screen user. While some people may again question why not use Latios due to his ability to soften blows further with Memento, Healing Wish differentiates Latias from her twin brother. With Healing Wish, Latias can sacrifice herself to bring back a crippled sweeper to give it a second chance at sweeping. As long as you don't end up getting said sweeper KOed, you can usually attempt a sweep earlier in the game with one sweeper, hopefully crippling or KOing its counter, then switching it out once crippled. Later in the game, Latias can set up Reflect and Light Screen and then sacrifice herself so that same sweeper can rampage through the opposing team unhindered. Essentially, Latias is a faster, slightly less bulky version of Cresselia, but unlike Cresselia, Latias has a bunch of very nice resistances, as well as offenses that are a threat in their own right. Apart from the three compulsory moves (Reflect, Light Screen, and Healing Wish), Draco Meteor is probably the best fit in the last slot so that Latias is not utter setup fodder. Even without investment, the move is powerful enough to deter frailer set-up sweepers from setting up on Latias.</p> <p>Apart from Draco Meteor, Latias has a number of options she can run in the last slot. Roar can be used to prevent setup, while Wish can be used to give a sweeper a relatively safe switch-in if you are ready to sacrifice Latias at the time. Thunder Wave can also be used to cripple potential revenge killers, or even give your sweeper an easier time in setting up with potential paralysis.</p> <p>Good teammates to Dual Screens Latias fall into two categories: sweepers and Pokemon that can take full advantage of dual screens and Healing Wish, and Pokemon that synergize well with Latias in general. Swords Dance Terrakion, Garchomp, Lucario, Breloom, Dragon Dance Salamence, Dragonite, Gyarados, Nasty Plot Thundurus-T, and Quiver Dance Volcarona are all excellent recipients of dual screens and Healing Wish. General Pokemon that work well with Latias are Pokemon that can switch into her weaknesses, especially Pursuit. Heatran pretty much synergizes perfectly with Latias, while Fighting-types are generally first on call when it comes to switching into Pursuit.</p> "

  "Latios": {
    "overview": "<p>Latios is one of, if not the, best wallbreakers in the metagame thanks to its insanely strong, nearly unresisted STAB Draco Meteor. This makes sets utilizing Choice Specs very difficult to switch into, let alone wall. This is further compounded by Trick crippling almost every defensive answer. It also has a great Speed tier that allows it to outspeed prominent threats like Keldeo, Terrakion, and Garchomp. This makes it a great Choice Scarf user, as it can outspeed all other Choice Scarf users and boosted sweepers. Latios's decent bulk and typing let it check Pokemon like Keldeo, Thundurus-T, Breloom, and Gliscor relatively well, which is made even easier due to its immunity to Spikes. It can even run Recover to aid its ability to check these Pokemon and mitigate sand and Stealth Rock damage. It's also great on rain teams, where it can hit most Steel-types hard with boosted Surf. Latios can also work on sand teams thanks to sand damage wearing down some of its counters and its ability to check and remove many Pokemon that pressure sand teams well, namely Breloom, Heatran, and Gliscor. However, despite its incredible strength, Draco Meteor leaves Latios incredibly exploitable after being used and usually forces it out. This is especially bad due to Tyranitar being very common and being able to easily Pursuit trap it after Draco Meteor has been used. Latios is also very vulnerable to many common residual damage sources like sand and Stealth Rock, which impedes its ability to stay healthy throughout a match, come in to attack, and check the things it should be able to.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Dragon Dance set with Ground Gem, Earthquake, and Ice Beam can be used as a lure to dent Latios's counters in Jirachi and Tyranitar while also outspeeding all common Choice Scarf users in the tier when boosted. This set should only be used on teams utilizing Magnezone, however. An Expert Belt or Life Orb set with Draco Meteor, Surf, Roost, and Hidden Power Fire can be run to hit Pokemon like Ferrothorn that can take one move from Latios but not another while retaining good damage overall. Expert Belt also helps Latios retain more longevity and lets it bluff a Choice item set, while Life Orb sets are able to do more damage to a broader range of targets. A Trick + Flame Orb set can be used as a lead on rain teams to lure in and cripple switch-ins like Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn, helping its teammates that have a hard time breaking these Pokemon and potentially gaining an advantage in the weather war. However, it lacks the power or Speed boost of Choice item sets. Also, common leads that run Protect, like Breloom and Gliscor, ruin this set's surprise value and leave it easily handled. A set utilizing dual screens with Memento and Light Clay can be used to aid hyper offense teams.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Tyranitar: Tyranitar is the best Latios counter in the metagame because it can take at least one hit if healthy and easily trap Latios with Pursuit after a Draco Meteor or Dragon Pulse while getting a guaranteed Pursuit trap if it can get in via a double switch or sacrificed teammate. Specially defensive Tyranitar deters Draco Meteor spam with the threat of trapping Latios and has an easier time coming in on it. However, it has to be careful to not come in on a Choice Specs-boosted Surf with Stealth Rock down, as it has a low chance to 2HKO Tyranitar, although the chance is very low. The Choice Scarf set, on the other hand, is able to trap Latios easily, as it can take any hit from the Choice Specs set after Stealth Rock without having to take an extra hit if Latios isn't Choice Scarf itself. However, it needs to be careful coming into Choice Scarf Latios with Stealth Rock down, as it can 2HKO this Tyranitar. It should also be noted non-Choice Band Tyranitar is unable to OHKO Latios with Pursuit if it doesn't switch, so correct prediction is required.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn, Jirachi, Bronzong, and Scizor can take multiple hits and get up entry hazards, cripple Latios with status or, in Scizor's case, use U-turn to gain momentum or Pursuit to trap Latios. Defensive Heatran and Excadrill can take multiple Draco Meteors but must watch out for Surf.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Regenerator Pokemon: Specially bulky Pokemon with Regenerator, namely Slowking and Amoonguss, can take any hit, even a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor, and make it much easier for the opponent to pivot around Latios as a result. Slowking and Amoonguss can even cripple Latios with paralysis, making it risky for Latios to just throw out a Draco Meteor while they're in. However, Amoonguss must watch out for Psyshock, and Slowking needs to be wary of Trick.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey can take any hit and heal off the damage with Soft-Boiled while crippling Latios with Toxic or Thunder Wave, although it must watch out for Trick, Psyshock, and boosted Draco Meteor if it's worn down.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers and Priority</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf users, Alakazam, Tornadus, and Mamoswine can all force Latios out thanks to their powerful attacks.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is what makes Latios such a brutal wallbreaker, as it's nearly unresisted and can even break down some bulky resistant foes like Ferrothorn over time. Surf lets Latios do good damage to Pokemon that can come in on Draco Meteor like Heatran, Excadrill, and Tyranitar. It can also do great damage to Pokemon like specially defensive Jirachi in rain. Trick cripples switch-ins, including Ferrothorn, Jirachi, Tyranitar, and Chansey, while aiding teammates attempting to break through defensive cores. However, it should only be used if the extra power from Choice Specs isn't needed in the game. Trick also lets Latios potentially gain Leftovers, which nullifies sand damage and makes it easier to stay in if sand is up. Dragon Pulse is a safe move to lock into and spam due to its lack of a stat drop and perfect accuracy, which makes it a good late-game cleaning tool as well as a good move to use when wanting to not risk a miss. It also lets Latios save PP on Draco Meteor, which is especially nice against Pokemon that commonly run Protect like Breloom, Politoed, and Gliscor. Recover allows Latios to mitigate sand and entry hazard damage while making it easier to check Keldeo, Thundurus-T, and Breloom long-term. It's worth noting that Recover should only be used on sets with Trick. Psyshock is able to 2HKO Chansey after Stealth Rock while also OHKOing Tentacruel and Terrakion in sand. However, it leaves Latios as bait for Tyranitar, which is immune to Psyshock and is able to easily Pursuit trap Latios. Hidden Power Fighting lets Latios have a way to super effectively hit Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, and Excadrill but doesn't hit much else and makes Latios run an imperfect Speed IV, leaving it outsped by opposing Latios lacking it as well as the uncommon Gengar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature is used over Modest despite Modest letting Latios break through Tyranitar and other walls more easily in order to retain the ability to outspeed Keldeo, Garchomp, and Terrakion while also Speed tying opposing Latios</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Attempt to get Latios in safely through a double switch, a sacrifice, or VoltTurn support; it doesn't want to take too much damage despite its decent bulk and typing, as it will make it harder to fire off attacks and can potentially get it Pursuit trapped by a healthy Tyranitar. If Latios gets low on health, it may be best to throw out an attack to hit something hard and sacrifice it or use it as fodder later. Scout for Stun Spore Amoonguss as well as unexpected Choice Scarf users, as they can catch Latios off guard and cripple it. Use Trick as you predict the opponent to bring in a Pokemon that walls Latios and can be properly crippled by it, like Jirachi or Ferrothorn. However, don't use Trick if the power of Choice Specs is needed. Additionally, don't use Trick if predicting a Tyranitar to come in unless it helps further progress for a Pokemon like Alakazam, as it will lead to Latios being Pursuit trapped. Attempt to weaken Latios's checks so it can pressure the opponent even further and potentially sweep late-game with Surf or Dragon Pulse. It's also important to remove or at least wear down Tyranitar so Latios can't be Pursuit trapped.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rotom-W brings another Keldeo and Gliscor check, easing the pressure off Latios to handle them, supplies a slow Volt Switch to bring Latios in safely, and burns Tyranitar and Ferrothorn to make it easier for Latios to break through them. Wallbreakers like Keldeo, Landorus-T, and Terrakion can break through Steel-types for Latios so it can easily spam Draco Meteor and or Dragon Pulse late-game. Bulky Steel-types like Jirachi, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory can check opposing Dragon- and Steel-types, while Latios can pressure and handle Fire- and Fighting-types for them. Entry hazards, particularly Spikes, are great with Latios, as its switch-ins are all incredibly vulnerable to them. Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, Excadrill, Heatran, and Skarmory can all get up entry hazards. Excadrill can also pressure opposing Steel-types and Tyranitar while supporting Latios with Rapid Spin so it can come in more easily. Meanwhile, Latios handles Gliscor and Breloom and wears down Skarmory for Excadrill. Politoed can remove sand to increase Latios's longevity, power up its Surf to make it pressure most Steel-types more effectively, and cripple switch-ins to Latios with status, while Latios can pressure many of Politoed's switch-ins. Magnezone can trap and remove Steel-types for Latios, making it particularly brutal to handle for many teams. Other Dragon-types like Garchomp and Kyurem-B work well with Latios to wear down each other's checks, especially in tandem with Magnezone on DragMag teams. Alakazam and Reuniclus can make good partners thanks to Latios usually wearing down or crippling mutual checks like Tyranitar and Jirachi. Alakazam, in particular, is a good partner due to Latios letting Alakazam potentially beat Tyranitar without breaking its Focus Sash. Tyranitar, particularly the Chople Berry set, can trap opposing Latios and Alakazam while bringing sand and Stealth Rock to wear down some potential switch-ins. In return, Latios can soft check Keldeo, Gliscor, and Breloom for it. Tornadus can take advantage of Latios wearing down Tyranitar and most Steel-types so it can spam Hurricane freely mid- and late-game.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor, even when unboosted, is a powerful attack that can do good damage to offensive Pokemon. Surf synergizes well with potential rain support, can hit Steel-types like Heatran and Excadrill hard, and deals good damage to boosted Volcarona in rain. Trick cripples switch-ins trying to take advantage of the fact that this Latios is weaker and help its teammates break through defensive cores. Dragon Pulse gives a spammable late-game STAB attack if you're not able to afford a potential miss or if the power of Draco Meteor isn't necessary to nab a KO. It also makes the matchup against DragMag teams even better because the power of Draco Meteor isn't needed to take out most members of those teams. Recover is an option that gives Latios the ability to more efficiently handle Keldeo and Breloom in the long run, although it should only be used with Trick. Alternatively, Psyshock can OHKO Terrakion in sand and nails Keldeo, Tentacruel, and Breloom while also doing good damage to boosted Volcarona outside of rain. Thunder has perfect accuracy in rain and gives Latios a way to hit boosted Gyarados, Keldeo, and Politoed without having to lock into Draco Meteor. However, it's very exploitable and doesn't hit anything besides Water- and most Flying-types hard enough.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature is used over Modest, as it allows Latios to outspeed all other Choice Scarf users and boosted sweepers in the tier.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Latios as a hit-and-run revenge killer to handle threats that would otherwise sweep your team. Attempt to use Trick on defensive Pokemon that can impede Latios or its teammates if the Speed boost from Choice Scarf isn't needed. Getting Latios in via VoltTurn, a double switch, or a sacrifice to check what it needs to and not take unnecessary damage so it can take a hit mid- or late-game is the most optimal scenario. If coming in directly with Latios, get it in on attacks it resists or is immune to like Choice Scarf Keldeo's STAB attacks or Earthquake. If the opposing team is weakened enough, Latios can sweep late-game if it still has its Choice Scarf and doesn't need to lock into Draco Meteor. If the opponent is using Tyranitar and Latios is on a rain team, try to eliminate or weaken Tyranitar to win the weather war and make this Latios much more effective. This Latios is very good against DragMag teams, so, if up against one, try to wear down or take out the Steel-types so Latios can very easily clean. As this Latios will be coming in on setup sweepers like Thundurus-T, Breloom, and Reuniclus often, it's expected that it'll be taking damage, so try to not make it take too much unneeded chip damage, as it needs to be healthy for Thundurus-T, Keldeo, and Dragon Dance users. Staying healthy is also important for getting Trick off in the long game against Pokemon like Jirachi and Reuniclus.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Latios works very well on offensive rain teams, so Politoed is a great teammate. The defensive variant, in particular, is a good partner, because it can wear down common Latios switch-ins via status. In return, Latios can handle more offensive teams for it and cripple potentially problematic Pokemon like Ferrothorn with Trick. Tentacruel and Starmie, if this set is being used on rain, can use Rapid Spin to increase Latios's longevity while being better switch-ins to other Water- and Fighting-types. Tentacruel can lay down Toxic Spikes or spread poison with Toxic to wear down switch-ins, while Starmie can break holes in the opposing team so Latios can sweep late-game. Tyranitar, particularly the Chople Berry set, is also a good partner on non-rain teams, since it can bring sand and Stealth Rock to wear down some potential switch-ins to help get Latios closer to a late-game sweep. Excadrill is a good spinner on sand teams and takes on Tyranitar and Steel-types for Latios while also taking advantage of Latios's ability to offensively pressure Keldeo. Keldeo takes advantage of Latios threatening Jellicent, Tentacruel, and Amoonguss while also beating down Steel-types, Chansey, and Tyranitar and breaking other walls that can impede a Latios sweep, while Latios can handle boosted sweepers Keldeo may not be able to handle like Dragonite. Ferrothorn can set Stealth Rock and Spikes to help Latios sweep and consistently switch into Water- and Dragon-types to ease the pressure off of Latios to switch into them. Thundurus-T is another good wallbreaker and potential late-game cleaner that appreciates Trick support to let it set up on and beat its checks while having sweeping potential itself with Agility. Ground-types like Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Garchomp can take down Steel-types and potentially set Stealth Rock to facilitate a sweep for Latios. In return, Latios can threaten physical walls like Gliscor and Slowbro. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock and use Toxic or Will-O-Wisp a cripple a potential check, namely Tyranitar or Slowking, while also checking Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Jirachi. In return, Latios can come in on Water- and Ground-types as well as keep a potentially boosted Volcarona in check to lift the burden off of Heatran to handle it. Magnezone is able to trap the Steel-types that can easily impede a sweep from this set, which helps Latios clean through much more easily late-game. Rotom-W brings another Keldeo and Gliscor check, easing the pressure off Latios to handle them, supplies a slow Volt Switch to bring Latios in safely, and burns Tyranitar and Ferrothorn to make it easier for Latios to break through them for a sweep late-game.</p> "

        "name": "Colbur Berry",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Even unboosted, Draco Meteor threatens to 2HKO almost all non-resistant Pokemon in the tier. Surf hits Steel-types like Heatran and Excadrill and lets Latios deal good damage to common Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T without dropping its Special Attack. Recover lets Latios check Heatran, Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Thundurus-T more reliably. The last move depends on Latios's teammates; Roar is better paired with Spikes setters and its main use is to phaze Tyranitar, which will try to Pursuit trap Latios after Draco Meteor, but it also phazes Calm Mind users like Reuniclus. Hidden Power Fire is the better option on teams that want to bait in Ferrothorn, since it is the natural defensive Latios switch-in, and deals good damage to Skarmory and Jirachi, but the Speed IV drop makes Latios always lose to opposing Latios and Latias that lack the move.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Colbur Berry lets Latios escape from Tyranitar's Pursuit via Roar at least once. If Latios hasn't already used Draco Meteor, it can instead deal massive damage to Tyranitar with Surf followed by Draco Meteor, which KOes offensive Tyranitar with Stealth Rock on the field.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Since Colbur Berry Latios has a one-time escape from Tyranitar, use it early-game to exert offensive pressure on slower Pokemon like Breloom, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. Try to have entry hazards on the field as quickly as possible, since Latios forces a lot of switches. Use Roar if you predict a switch to a Pokemon Latios can't deal much damage to, like Ferrothorn or Jirachi, especially if Spikes is up. Do not be afraid to use Draco Meteor if it will grab a KO, since players usually remove Latios by sacrificing a weakened Pokemon to Draco Meteor and then bringing Tyranitar in to Pursuit trap it—which fails spectacularly against this specific set. If using Hidden Power Fire, correctly predict a Ferrothorn switch-in to not let it use entry hazards, Gyro Ball, or Knock Off against Latios. Only reveal Hidden Power Fire in the correct moment, since it loses a lot of its effectiveness when the surprise factor is gone.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Colbur Berry Latios wants Spikes on the field, so Ferrothorn and Skarmory are its best partners. Ferrothorn also provides Stealth Rock and Knock Off support to help Latios break through defensive Pokemon. Skarmory provides Taunt support to block opposing entry hazards and can form a unexpected double phazer core with Latios. Other Stealth Rock users like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor are also very good teammates; Gliscor especially, since it can also offer Knock Off, Taunt, or U-turn support, as well as good offensive synergy if running Swords Dance. Tyranitar is great to Pursuit trap Psychic-types that can try to use a non-Choice Specs or Choice Scarf Latios to set up Calm Mind, like Reuniclus. Tyranitar also deals with opposing Latios, which can be problematic if using Hidden Power Fire because of the Speed IV drop. Pokemon that can spread status like Rotom-W, Heatran, Giscor, Jellicent, and Mew support Latios well with the extra damage that a burn or a poison provides. Pokemon that can prevent opposing entry hazards from going up, either via Magic Bounce like Xatu or by trapping like Magnezone, are good partners. Rapid Spin support from Excadrill is advised, especially if not using Hidden Power Fire and therefore sacrificing power against Ferrothorn. Offensively, partners that like Colbur Berry Latios's ability to bait in and damage Tyranitar, like Reuniclus and Alakazam, are very good choices. Breloom is amazing to capitalize on a Ferrothorn switch-in to set up Swords Dance, Bulk Up, or Substitute or threaten an immediate KO with Technician sets. Breloom also provides interesting defensive synergy with Latios against rain structures with the stacked Water and Electric resistances. Mamoswine is another good offensive option, since it can deal with Dragon-types and Thundurus-T with Ice Shard, and it can capitalize on Latios's Roar or Hidden Power Fire to finish off weakened teams with its Substitute set.</p> "

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind- and Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor does a ton of damage to almost everything in the metagame, most notably Tyranitar, but it should be used carefully as to not waste the Dragon Gem. Surf lets Latios do good damage to Heatran and Excadrill, which could otherwise come in directly and take advantage of it. Recover allows Latios to mitigate sand and entry hazard damage while giving it an easier time setting up and making it easier to check Keldeo, Gliscor, and Breloom. Dragon Pulse gives Latios a STAB attack that doesn't lower its stats and makes it able to sweep late-game with Calm Mind. Hidden Power Fire pressures Steel-types, notably being able to OHKO Ferrothorn and 2HKO specially defensive Jirachi after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes most of the time. However, the associated IV drop makes Latios outsped by other Latios lacking Hidden Power Fire as well as the uncommon Gengar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Dragon Gem allows Latios to wallbreak efficiently and break through walls with Calm Mind-boosted Draco Meteor, mainly Tyranitar, but also Pokemon like Celebi and Slowking. If Latios is running Hidden Power Fire over Recover, Lum Berry can be considered to heal off status from Pokemon like Heatran, Rotom-W, Amoonguss, and Politoed so it can set up more easily.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Latios mid-game to slam walls with Dragon Gem- and Calm Mind-boosted Draco Meteor. Be sure to use it on the correct target to soften up the main threat for your sweeper or cleaner. Attempt to set up on switches and Pokemon that can't do much to Latios, like Gliscor and Heatran, as well as Pokemon locked into attacks Latios resists or is immune to. Try to get Latios's checks to switch in directly with the threat of Choice Specs Draco Meteor as you use Calm Mind and slam them with Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor. If Latios gets low on health and has Recover, use it in conjunction with Calm Mind to stay healthy before and after setting up with Latios in situations where the opportunity is presented to you. Be sure to get up entry hazards so Latios can take out the things it's meant to, mainly specially defensive Tyranitar, Heatran, and Excadrill.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Latios variant mainly fits on offensive rain teams that appreciate Tyranitar being lured in and removed from the game. As such, Politoed, mainly the defensive variant, is a very good partner that also makes it easier for Latios to come in by removing sand while bringing a backup switch-in to Water-types to lift the burden off of Latios. Starmie benefits majorly from Tyranitar being lured in and taken out early on so it can easily break holes in the opposing team without fear of being Pursuit trapped, and its ability to spin away Stealth Rock makes it easier for Latios to get on the field. Tornadus is able to more freely spam Hurricane with Tyranitar gone thanks to rain being easier to maintain while also removing items from Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Jirachi with Knock Off, and it can get Latios in safely with U-turn. Jirachi, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn can check opposing Dragon- and Steel-types and get up Stealth Rock early-game, while Latios can pressure and handle Fire-types and some Steel-types for them as well as pressure spinners. Magnezone is able to trap and remove Ferrothorn so Latios is more likely to destroy Tyranitar or another wall its teammates would like gone. It also lets Latios run Recover or Dragon Pulse as opposed to Hidden Power Fire. Other Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp appreciate Latios considerably wearing down their checks and general walls so they can sweep without much stopping them mid- and late-game. Reuniclus is able to put immense pressure on the opposing team late-game with a potential Tyranitar out of the picture. Ground-types like Garchomp and Excadrill can all pressure opposing Steel-types while also taking advantage of Latios taking out or severely weakening checks like Slowbro, Gliscor, and Skarmory for them.</p> "

  "Jirachi": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW OU metagame in general. A <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/jirachi-qc-1-2.3682326/\">revamp</a> is currently being worked on for this analysis.</p> <hr /> <p>Heralded as perhaps the most annoying Pokemon ever to grace the game of Pokemon, Jirachi is a tough competitor in the OU metagame. Its versatility is its main strength; Jirachi can run a variety of sets, from Calm Mind to specially defensive to revenge killer and everything in-between. Jirachi's best sets are SubCM and specially defensive, as the former is a highly potent sweeper and the latter is a good wall with a ton of utility and useful resistances. With its devastating paraflinch strategy, Jirachi can tear apart even the most threatening of Pokemon and cause its opponents to forfeit in sheer rage. Not to mention, Jirachi fits in perfectly with rain teams, the best weather in OU. Unfortunately, it is vulnerable to common Ground-types in the metagame and is handicapped versus common sun threats. However, none of this is enough to knock Jirachi off its pedestal as one of the best Pokemon in the OU tier.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Despite its expansive movepool, there are only a few other sets Jirachi can run effectively. The first of these is a Choice Specs set with Doom Desire; even though Doom Desire has the turn delay, it hits very hard with Choice Specs backing it. Jirachi has a number of other coverage moves to incorporate into such a set. The second is a lead variant with Stealth Rock and Wish and heavy investment in HP and Speed. Another is a Gravity supporter, which is useful for, naturally, Gravity-based teams. Dual screens could work as well with Jirachi's great resistances, as could Cosmic Power to make Jirachi nearly impenetrable and Refresh to heal off status. However, at this point you might as well just use a better Jirachi set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While it is impossible for any one Pokemon to counter every possible Jirachi, there a few that can handle most. Heatran is the foremost of them, being able to wall and phaze out almost all Calm Mind Jirachi and shut down the other sets. Ground types in general are the quintessential checks to Jirachi. Fast or offensive Ground-types such as Garchomp, Gliscor, and Mamoswine can usually switch into most Jirachi variants and force it out with their powerful Ground-type moves. Slower, bulkier Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Landorus-T can usually take anything Jirachi can throw at it, and retaliate with Earthquake or even phaze it out in Hippowdon's case. Gastrodon is another one, as bar the occasional Grass Knot or Energy Ball, it can wall Jirachi and wear it down with Earth Power and a Scald-induced burn. Specially defensive Swords Dance Scizor can deal with every Jirachi set that lacks a Fire-type move; Choice Band Scizor can deal with some sets but falters against boosted Jirachi.</p> <p>Though it is fairly difficult to deal with most Jirachi in one Pokemon, there exist plenty of checks to certain sets. Ferrothorn can wall pretty much all Jirachi, even Hidden Power Fire variants in the rain, but also can do little in return other than set up Spikes. Forretress and Skarmory are in the same boat in that they cannot do much to Jirachi other than set up Spikes, though the latter can phaze it out in an emergency situation. Calm Mind Latias can deal with certain variants depending on whether it runs Roar or Refresh, the former allowing it to beat all Calm Mind Jirachi and the latter allowing it to take on variants that aim to spread status. Celebi can wall and Perish Song Calm Mind Jirachi and check other variants. Opposing Jirachi can also be a bit of a pain, as they each put the other stalemate position. Magnezone is an annoying foe for specially defensive Jirachi, as Jirachi can do practically nothing to Magnezone while it proceeds to setup on it, or 3HKO it with Choice Specs-boosted Thunderbolt. Many bulky Water-types including Jellicent, Tentacruel, RestTalk Gyarados, and specially defensive Rotom-W can wall Choice Scarf and other physical Jirachi; Rotom-W can even deal with unboosted Calm Mind Jirachi fairly well, wearing it down with a burn from Will-O-Wisp.</p> ",

        "name": "SubCM",
        "description": "<p>Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi is a terror to behold, setting up frighteningly easily with its myriad of resistances. Especially in rain, Jirachi is practically untouchable on the special side after a Calm Mind or two. Defensive Pokemon that do not carry Perish Song or a phazing move, such as Ferrothorn and Blissey, provide numerous opportunities for Jirachi to set up, which brings up its slightly disappointing power at first to a more than acceptable level. Substitute makes revenge killing, status, and Leech Seed futile attempts against Jirachi.</p> <p>The first attacking move of choice is Thunder, which obviously requires rain to be usable. Rain is a great asset for Jirachi due to the high paralysis chance and power of Thunder and the mitigation of Jirachi's Fire weakness. Rain does make Water-type attacks hurt, however, so there is merit to using Jirachi with other weathers, in which case Thunderbolt should be used. In any case, Thunder is crucial to hit bulky Water-types such as Jellicent hard. The second attacking move is a toss-up between three options; Psyshock provides a surefire win in Calm Mind wars and hits Blissey, Chansey, Toxicroak, and Breloom, while Flash Cannon has excellent neutral coverage, which Psyshock somewhat lacks. The other option is Water Pulse, which allows Jirachi to employ a devastating parafusion strategy. Just be sure to use it in rain so it hits hard enough.</p> <p>The EV spread gives Jirachi a decent amount of bulk and enough Speed to outrun neutral natured base 100s. It is possible to maximize Speed in order to outspeed Nasty Plot Celebi and tie with Salamence, but it's really not worth it. Another alternative is a spread of 252 HP / 236 Def / 20 Spe with a Bold nature to allow Jirachi to handle Kyurem-B, Terrakion, Salamence in rain, Choice Band Tyranitar, and other physical threats much better. It lacks the Speed to set up as effectively, however, so use discretion. As for alternative moves, Grass Knot is a good option, as it allows Jirachi to smack Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Tyranitar hard. Psychic is also an option to hit bulky Ground-types, such as Hippowdon and Gliscor, harder than Psyshock.</p> <p>A few teammates are needed with Jirachi. The first thing is rain support; as for numerous reasons mentioned above, Jirachi functions much better in the weather. Entry hazards are also pretty important, as they help wear down foes and prevent Pokemon with the Sturdy ability and Dragonite from messing up Jirachi's sweep. Landorus-T has good defensive synergy with Jirachi and can check Garchomp—a troublesome Pokemon for Jirachi—while Celebi can check Ground-types, and Ferrothorn has the secondary use of providing Spikes and can tank the powerful Water-type attacks that Jirachi cannot. Specially defensive Heatran can take pretty much any attack Jirachi throws at it and phaze it out, so a Pokemon such as Terrakion or even Politoed is helpful to eliminate it. Terrakion can also punch through Celebi, Blissey, Chansey, and Gastrodon. Lastly, a cleaner such as Choice Scarf Keldeo is useful to have around just in case Jirachi dies before finishing its sweep. Keldeo is best because it helps Jirachi by softening up Blissey and Chansey and demolishing Heatran, while Jirachi can dispose of Jellicent, Tentacruel, and Latias fairly easily (aka all of Keldeo's counters).</p> "

        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<p>Jirachi's great typing, high Speed and defenses, ability to efficiently wear down foes, and the metric ton of support it provides all make it a great team player. This set utilizes rain as well, as it drastically lowers the damage done by weak Fire-type attacks and enables Jirachi to run Thunder, although it does make Hydro Pumps and Surfs hurt way more. Jirachi is a perfect counter to numerous common threats, including Latios, Latias, Gengar, and Kyurem-B. It also, of course, utilizes its notorious paraflinch strategy to do so, with the two attacking moves being used for that purpose. Body Slam works well in any weather and can paralyze Volt Absorb Pokemon and Ground-types, but Thunder packs much more of a punch. Thunder Wave can't hit Volt Absorb Pokemon and Ground-types, like Thunder, and does no damage and doesn't help against Substitute users, but it is the only option that paralyzes 100% of the time. As for Wish, it provides two significant benefits in providing Jirachi with semi-reliable recovery and supporting Jirachi's teammates. The last move is a bit of a toss-up; Protect is useful to scout, turn Wish into reliable recovery, and get an extra turn of Leftovers recovery, while U-turn can not only scout but also get a teammate in safely and maintain momentum. Stealth Rock is a good option if no other teammate can set it up, as Jirachi's numerous resistances make it easy to do so.</p> <p>The only important thing to note about EVs is that they allow Jirachi to outrun Adamant Breloom and Magnezone. An alternative spread with all of the Special Defense EVs moved to Defense is viable to better take on physical Dragon-types, Terrakion, and other physical threats, being just as useful as the listed spread. On the other hand, the moves are very customizable. Healing Wish is a good option to heal a teammate when Jirachi has extended past its usefulness. Fire Punch is a decent attacking option for non-rain teams in order to hit Ferrothorn and Forretress for a good amount of damage.</p> <p>For partners, rain support is helpful to mitigate Jirachi's Fire weakness, and is mandatory if running Thunder. A Pokemon that can take physical attacks well, mainly Earthquakes and Close Combats, is also helpful; Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Latias (only for the attacks mentioned) are good choices. Latias can also deal with Nasty Plot Thundurus-T. Celebi is a good partner specifically to deal with Ground-types; other options include RestTalk Gyarados (who can also deal with Heatran and Volcarona) and Rotom-W (who can also deal with Heatran and benefits from Wish support). Heatran and Volcarona are particularly bothersome for Jirachi, making Terrakion a good partner.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>This set is particularly good at revenge killing Dragon-types. Jirachi is much bulkier than the average Choice Scarf user and has numerous resistances, which allows it to switch into a number of attacks. This set's biggest flaw is its lack of power; base 100 Attack simply doesn't always cut it, so Jirachi is easily walled and set up on. Regardless of its lack of power, Jirachi is still an amazing Choice Scarf user. Iron Head's high flinch rate allows Jirachi to hax its way past numerous opponents, and it is very useful for picking off weakened foes. The first coverage move of choice is Ice Punch because it hits Celebi, Gliscor, Dragonite, and many others for super effective damage. The third slot is a choice between two options; U-turn allows Jirachi to scout to obtain better match-ups and Fire Punch hits Ferrothorn for good damage. The other choice on this set is which non-attacking move to use. Trick can cripple walls, most notably Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Chansey, Blissey, and bulky Water-types (such as Jellicent and Slowbro), and can mess up slower sweepers, such as offensive Trick Room Reuniclus. Crippling these Pokemon makes it easy for a teammate to set up. On the other hand, Healing Wish makes Jirachi an amazing supporter; once it has extended its usefulness, Jirachi can revitalize a crippled teammate, which gives this option tons of merit.</p> <p>For the nature, Jolly is preferred to tie with Choice Scarf Salamence, +1 Volcarona, and outrun +1 Jolly Haxorus, but Adamant brings some compelling power to the table. It really depends on whether your team can handle those aforementioned Pokemon. If some bulk is desired, less Speed EVs can be run, such as 128 (enough to outrun +1 Adamant Haxorus), but the lowest this set should go is 96 (enough to outrun +1 Adamant Dragonite). Two other attacks can be run; namely, Thunder Punch to hit Gyarados and Keldeo and Zen Headbutt to hit various Fighting-types. Meteor Mash is an option over Iron Head for a little bit of extra power, securing KOs on standard Mamoswine, standard Substitute Kyurem-B, and standard Terrakion.</p> <p>As for support, this Jirachi doesn't need much. Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Scizor are the most important Pokemon to get rid of for Jirachi; an offensive Landorus-T such as a Choice Band variant can take hits from many of these Pokemon due to Intimidate and is able to steamroll through them. Magnezone is another good choice because it can efficiently trap and KO Ferrothorn and Scizor. Celebi is also a good partner because it can dispatch Jellicent. Swords Dance Scizor and Agility Thundurus-T can set up on Jirachi; Heatran can deal with the former and Mamoswine with the latter.</p> "

        "name": "Superachi! (Offensive Calm Mind)",
        "description": "<p>This set, a mainstay from the fourth generation, is a full-out offensive Calm Mind sweeper. It only needs 1-2 boosts to sweep, which is a massive advantage over other Calm Mind sets, and has space for an extra coverage move. All that's needed is a few Pokemon out of the way and then Jirachi can sweep. Because of this, it can be run on practically any offensive team. This set has two variants: one with Psychic, Grass Knot, and Hidden Power Fire, and one with Flash Cannon, Thunderbolt, and Hidden Power Ground. The first one boasts the hard-hitting Psychic to hit Fighting-types, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and a number of other threats hard, as well as the ability to break Gastrodon with Grass Knot. Grass Knot hits most other Water-types as well, including Jellicent, Slowbro, Gastrodon, and Starmie, as well as Tyranitar. Hidden Power Fire hits, naturally, Ferrothorn, Forretress, Skarmory, and other Steel-types. The second variant boasts the great neutral coverage of Flash Cannon and the ability to OHKO Heatran. Thunderbolt retains coverage on Jellicent, Slowbro, Starmie, Skarmory, and Forretress. Picking which variant to use is determined on what support you're willing to provide.</p> <p>Modest is the preferred nature to give Jirachi some immediate power to work with, most notably guaranteeing the OHKO on Gliscor with +1 Life Orb-boosted Psychic. Timid is viable for isolated cases such as Jolly Haxorus and Kyurem-B, but those are only, well, isolated cases. As for the item, there are a bunch of choices. The ones listed are Life Orb, which provides more power, and Leftovers, which allows Jirachi to get more boosts and bluff other Calm Mind variants. Other options include Shuca Berry to take a Ground-type attack from foes such as Garchomp and Landorus-T, and Expert Belt to take advantage of this set's great super effective coverage. Lastly, since the second variant of this set can be run in rain, Thunder is a viable option for its paralysis chance and significant increase in power.</p> <p>Support isn't really a big deal with this set; just get rid of most faster Pokemon so Jirachi can sweep securely, possibly leaving some foes such as Alakazam and Latios for Jirachi to set up on. The first variant of this set needs Heatran gone, which makes Pokemon such as Terrakion a good partner (who can also provide Stealth Rock support), while the second needs Gastrodon gone, so Celebi is a good partner for it. The only other significant choice is Choice Band Tyranitar, as it nullifies the effects of rain and can Pursuit trap Celebi, which is a nuisance for unboosted Jirachi.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + Status",
        "description": "<p>This set allows Jirachi to showcase its defensive, offensive, and supportive capabilities all at once, giving it the ability to function as a great pivot and wear down opponents with ease. Substitute and a status, as the set name implies, are vital to this set. Substitute provides a buffer against faster opponents and opposing status. The status is a choice between paralysis and Toxic. The former can cripple faster Pokemon, which helps slower teammates, and, with Iron Head, forms Jirachi's signature paraflinch strategy. The latter helps against walls, such as Hippowdon, Jellicent, Gastrodon, and Landorus-T, and works in tandem with Iron Head to wear down slower Pokemon quickly. Toxic helps many offensive Pokemon handle their worst nemeses. The last move is reserved for Fire Punch, which hits Ferrothorn and Forretress where it hurts.</p> <p>The EVs for this set allow it to fulfill its many duties, providing some bulk, power, and the ability to outspeed all Mamoswine, Dragonite, and Breloom, as well as Adamant Lucario. Running more Speed is a decent option to consider; good benchmarks include enough for Adamant Kyurem-B and defensive Ninetales. Zen Headbutt can be run over Fire Punch to hit Fighting-types hard, being boosted by STAB and having the same high flinch chance as Iron Head.</p> <p>This Jirachi prefers to be in sandy weather, as facing or being on a rain or sun team proves detrimental in different ways. Rain weakens Fire Punch, while sun amplifies Jirachi's Fire weakness. Slower sweepers, such as Swords Dance Scizor, make great partners if Jirachi runs paralysis, while Pokemon that function great with certain walls removed, such as Keldeo, are best if Jirachi runs Toxic. If not running Toxic, make sure you have a Pokemon such as Thundurus-T or Celebi to eliminate Jellicent, Hippowdon, and other defensive behemoths. Another good partner for non-Toxic variants of this set is Kyurem-B, who benefits from paralysis support and, with the moves Fusion Bolt, Ice Beam, and Earth Power, can deal with most of the aforementioned walls. It can even get rid of Tentacruel and Zapdos, which is extremely helpful.</p> "

        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>As is the case with many Pokemon that can run both physical and special options, Jirachi can run a mixed set effectively. Between the surprise factor of Expert Belt and great coverage, Jirachi can hit a variety of Pokemon hard. In addition, Jirachi's resistances and aforementioned coverage make it one of the best Shell Smash recipients in the game. The attacks are fairly straightforward; Iron Head is used because its flinch chance is just too good to pass up. It also hits Kyurem-B, Blissey, Chansey, Reuniclus, and Tyranitar hard. Fire Punch is the preferred Fire-type move so Jirachi can run a different Hidden Power type, hitting Ferrothorn, Forretress, Lucario, and Celebi hard. Hidden Power Ice is essential for hitting Dragon-types, such as Latios, Latias, Salamence, and Dragonite, and bulky Ground-types such as Gliscor and Landorus-T. Ice Punch is an option to hit Dragonite, Latios, and Latias harder, and that allows Jirachi to run Hidden Power Fire, which hits Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory harder than Fire Punch.</p> <p>The last moveslot prevents this set from being walled by Water-types. Thunderbolt is the overall better option, as it hits most Water-types, namely Tentacruel, Jellicent, Starmie, Politoed, and Keldeo, harder than Energy Ball, while also solidly two-shotting Skarmory. Energy Ball does come in handy versus Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and physically defensive Hippowdon, but otherwise offers poor super effective coverage for Expert Belt to take advantage.</p> <p>The EVs allow Jirachi to OHKO Scizor with Fire Punch after Stealth Rock damage and outrun neutral natured base 100s. A Naive nature is chosen so Jirachi can take priority moves better, which is especially important if it is passed a Shell Smash. Speaking of being passed a Shell Smash, Drain Punch is standard in that situation over the Fire-type move to hit Terrakion, Blissey, Chansey, and some others hard while providing some recovery. Energy Ball may be preferred if Jirachi is a recipient of Shell Smash boosts, as the move easily eliminates Unaware Quagsire. Zen Headbutt is another viable coverage option to hit Fighting-types super effectively, also boasting STAB and the same flinch chance as Iron Head. If you opt for Energy Ball, make sure you are packing either Drain Punch and Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fire to have a proper answer to physical Steel-types.</p> <p>One can always opt for Thunder over Thunderbolt for the markedly more powerful Electric option with a 60% chance paralysis rate that would complement well with Jirachi's STAB Iron Head and its high flinch rate. Icy Wind may also be used to not only save Hidden Power for a different type, but to lower the opposing Pokemon's Speed to render the switch-in vulnerable to Iron Head flinch or a super effective coverage move.</p> <p>As has been mentioned numerous times, this Jirachi is an amazing recipient of Shell Smash, which makes Gorebyss, Mew, and Smeargle great partners. Entry hazards are also pretty helpful; Froslass is particularly useful, because it can prevent opposing hazards from being laid down on your side of the field for the potential Smeargle partner. This set also enjoys Terrakion being partnered with it, as it can smash apart opponents for Jirachi to clean late-game. Using a Pokemon such as Rock Polish Landorus-T is another option to punch some holes early-game. Otherwise, this Jirachi is just fine on its own. It is great at luring in and eliminating pesky walls which helps teammates, examples being Gastrodon for Keldeo and Thundurus-T, Skarmory for Mamoswine and Terrakion, and Ferrothorn for Swords Dance Scizor that lack Superpower.</p> "

        "name": "Wish + Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>While SubCM excels on more offensively-oriented teams, this set does best on more defensive, slower-paced teams. Jirachi will have some trouble against some powerful offensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T, but that's a small price to pay for the ability to support and sweep. Wish, of course, is the move that makes this all possible, allowing Jirachi to heal itself and support its teammates; in fact, the latter is its focus until late-game. Depending on whether or not you run it in rain, Jirachi can even spread paralysis. All of these traits together allow it to live practically forever if played correctly. The rest is standard fare for Calm Mind Jirachi. Use Thunder in rain and Thunderbolt outside it in order to hit bulky Water-types. Psyshock helps against an annoying Pokemon for defensive rain teams, Toxicroak, and helps against Calm Mind Latias. Flash Cannon has great coverage, and Water Pulse allows for parafusion.</p> <p>The EVs give Jirachi some bulk to take on physical threats much more easily and outspeed Breloom and Magnezone. An EV spread of 252 HP / 108 Def / 148 Spe with a Timid nature is also viable to outrun neutral natured base 100s and a good number of other Pokemon, like Timid Rotom-W and Jolly Toxicroak. Two other choices for the last move are Grass Knot to hit Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Tyranitar, and Psychic to hit bulky Ground-types, such as Hippowdon and Gliscor, harder than Psyshock.</p> <p>This set can't boost as easily as SubCM, so Jirachi is going to need some support. If you want to run Thunder and / or Water Pulse, obviously bring a Politoed. Getting threats like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Mamoswine out of the way is important, so Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Gyarados are good partners. A hard hitter, such as Terrakion, is helpful to weaken teams for Jirachi; Terrakion can demolish Heatran, Blissey, Chansey, and Gastrodon, and can punch huge holes into the opposing team. This set is geared toward balance and stall teams that need their Jirachi to support and sweep, as this set does. Other than rain, sand is a good weather to use with Jirachi because it helps wear down opposing Pokemon while Jirachi takes no damage from it. Stall teams always need some sort of attacker, and having one that doesn't sacrifice defensive synergy can be essential.</p> "

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>With the huge presence of Water-type Pokemon and rain teams in OU, Gastrodon stands out as being one of the most reliable counters to them in the entire metagame. Its ability, Storm Drain, not only makes Gastrodon immune to Water-type moves, but also grants it a Special Attack boost every time it is hit by a Water-type attack. On top of that, Gastrodon's fantastic defensive typing gives it four resistances, an immunity to Electric-type moves, and only one weakness--Grass. It even has access to reliable recovery in the form of Recover. The combination of all these useful attributes makes Gastrodon a good pick for rain, sandstorm, and weatherless teams alike because of its ability to completely wall common Pokemon such as Politoed, Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Starmie, while also checking Thundurus-T.</p> <p>Although Gastrodon has the qualities of a great defensive Pokemon, it's by no means perfect. Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Celebi, and Breloom are certainly not uncommon, and they all threaten to KO Gastrodon with their respective Grass-type STAB. Gastrodon is also extremely slow, and is thus forced to rely on its bulk more than it wants to in order to stay alive. Nevertheless, Gastrodon's useful attributes make it one of the best defensive counters to rain teams in the metagame.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>As Gastrodon is such a niche Pokemon in OU, there aren't too many other viable options over in moves already listed above. Clear Smog is an option to keep sweepers from setting up on Gastrodon, but Toxic is preferred, as Clear Smog's does little damage anyway. Memento can be used to heavily weaken the opposing Pokemon and allow a teammate to potentially set up on it, but Gastrodon is too slow to use it effectively. Counter and Mirror Coat are gimmicky strategies that are very hard to fit onto its defensive set, but they can work with proper prediction. Stockpile might seem like an interesting move to make Gastrodon really hard to KO, but it doesn't really accomplish anything outside of pointless stalling, and Gastrodon can just be phazed anyway. Sand Force can make Gastrodon's Earth Power and Earthquake very powerful in the sand, but Gastrodon has to forgo its best and only niche in countering rain teams, which is one of the only reasons to use it in the first place.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Although Gastrodon's defensive typing, Storm Drain ability, and access to Recover might make it seem nearly unbreakable, there are many Pokemon that can take it on. Any Grass-type Pokemon with a STAB Grass-type move can prey on its 4x weakness and easily OHKO pretty much any variant of Gastrodon, as it is 4x weak to it. Ferrothorn, Roserade, and Celebi are some of the best defensive counters to Gastrodon in the game, while Breloom is one of its best checks. Ferrothorn and Roserade can even set up Spikes all over Gastrodon, as they fear nothing from it. Offensive variants of Gastrodon can be somewhat difficult to switch into, especially when it's in the rain and has nabbed a +1 Special Attack boost. Specially defensive Celebi is probably one of the most reliable counters to it because it's never OHKOed by Ice Beam and can threaten Gastrodon the following turn with Giga Drain. With some investment in Special Defense, Ferrothorn is a solid counter to the offensive set, as it can avoid the 2HKO from any move. It must be wary of Scald from the defensive set though, as which can burn Ferrothorn. Special walls with access to Natural Cure or Heal Bell can easily wall any variant of Gastrodon, even if it carries Toxic. Anything with Toxic, such as Blissey, Chansey, and Jellicent, can heavily cripple Gastrodon, because it depends so much on its bulk and recovery to stay alive.</p> <p>Thundurus-T, one of the common Pokemon Gastrodon is commonly called on to check, can easily lure and KO it with Grass Knot. Even though Gastrodon's defensive set is designed to wall them, it still fears powerful physical and special attackers. Choice Specs Latios threatens to OHKO physically defensive Gastrodon with Draco Meteor, while Choice Band Kyurem-B and Dragonite can easily 2HKO it with Outrage. SubCM Latias can easily set up on defensive Gastrodon, even it if has Ice Beam. Calm Mind Jirachi can also set up on defensive Gastrodon if it's running Earth Power over Earthquake.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<p>This set aims to patch up Gastrodon's lackluster Defense stat so that it can take on physical attackers more efficiently. Because of its ability to stop a majority of rain teams in their tracks, defensive Gastrodon fits well on teams that have a weakness to common rain threats such as Starmie, Keldeo, and Thundurus-T. It should be noted that with full investment in Defense, Gastrodon is capable of avoiding the 2HKO from Choice Specs Keldeo's Secret Sword, which is quite a feat. It can also avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Tyranitar's Crunch and Garchomp's Outrage, and then disposes of them the following turn. Earthquake is the primary Ground-type move of choice for a number of reasons. It deals more consistent damage to the likes of Jirachi, while also keeping the Calm Mind variants from setting up on Gastrodon. Earthquake is also useful for its ability to always 3HKO every variant of Tyranitar, a Pokemon that Gastrodon will commonly be walling. Earth Power is still an option, as it has the advantage of benefiting from Storm Drain's Special Attack boost. Scald is a staple on any bulky Water-type, and Gastrodon is no exception. The chance to burn physical attackers such as Kyurem-B and Tyranitar is just too hard to pass up, as it makes Gastrodon much harder to break. Toxic is a very useful utility move to cripple opposing bulky Water-types, such as Jellicent and opposing Gastrodon, that would normally wall Gastrodon with ease, while also keeping sweepers from potentially setting up on it. Ice Beam on the other hand gives Gastrodon much-needed coverage against Dragon-types that it will often go up against, such as Salamence, Dragonite, and Garchomp. Recover is obligatory, because without it, Gastrodon wouldn't last very long at all.</p> <p>Because of Gastrodon's decent mixed bulk, it can be EVed in many different ways depending on what you want it to wall. 252 HP / 84 Def / 172 SpD with a Calm nature is a more specially defensive spread that can better handle special attackers such as Latios, while still retaining some physical bulk for Terrakion and Keldeo. Although a full-blown specially defensive set seems tempting to better handle Choice Specs Latios, it's not recommended, because Gastrodon is otherwise very susceptible to being 2HKOed by Keldeo, Tyranitar, and Terrakion.</p> <p>Incidentally, some of the best teammates for Gastrodon are Grass-types. Ferrothorn, Celebi, and Breloom can all switch into Grass-type attacks with relative ease and set up on them. Breloom has the advantage of being able to beat Ferrothorn, one of the greatest roadblocks to Gastrodon. To maximize Gastrodon's walling capabilities, a Rapid Spinner is recommended, because it is very susceptible to entry hazards such as Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Tentacruel is probably the best spinner for the job, as it can absorb Toxic Spikes, spin away hazards, and switch into the move Toxic itself. Steel-types such as Scizor and Heatran can easily switch into Grass-types and threaten them with a STAB U-turn or Fire Blast, respectively. Calm Mind Latias and Jirachi can set up on pretty much any Grass-type in the tier that threatens Gastrodon.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This set takes full advantage of Storm Drain to pose as a surprisingly effective offensive threat. The goal of this set is simple; switch into a Water-type attack so that Gastrodon can receive a Special Attack boost and proceed to spam coverage moves to bust holes into the opposing team. One advantage that this set has over the defensive set is the sheer surprise factor. Most players don't expect to see an offensive Gastrodon, so they often let their guard down, which can lead to unexpected OHKOs and 2HKOs. Although offensive Gastrodon can effectively run a number of different items to varying success, the two listed above have been proven to be the most effective.</p> <p>Surf is the most powerful Water-type STAB move that Gastrodon can learn. A rain-boosted +1 Surf can 2HKO Keldeo, despite it resisting the attack. Here are some calculations showcasing Surf's surprising power, assuming a +1 Special Attack boost, rainy weather, and Mystic Water as Gastrodon's held item:</p> <p>Surf vs. 4/0 Breloom: 275-324 (104.96 - 123.66%) -- guaranteed OHKO</p> <p>Surf vs. 0/4 Keldeo: 197-232 (60.99 - 71.82%) -- guaranteed 2HKO</p> <p>Surf vs. 56/0 Kyurem-B: 198-234 (48.88 - 57.77%) -- guaranteed 2HKO after Stealth Rock</p> <p>Surf vs. 252/0 Politoed: 182-214 (47.39 - 55.72%) -- guaranteed 2HKO after Stealth Rock</p> <p>Surf vs. 72/0 Latias: 144-171 (45.14 - 53.6%) -- guaranteed 2HKO after Stealth Rock</p> <p>Earth Power gives Gastrodon STAB Ground-type coverage against the likes of Tentacruel, Toxicroak, and Jellicent, which all resist or are immune to its Water-type STAB. Moreover, a +1 Earth Power has a slight chance of 2HKOing Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock, which can prevent it from freely switching into Gastrodon. Ice Beam gives this set near-perfect coverage by hitting Grass-types such as Celebi on the switch and Dragon-types such as Salamence and Latios harder than anything else. Recover is once again heavily stressed because it greatly improves Gastrodon's longevity and makes it a more efficient attacker. Due to its very low Speed stat, Gastrodon will oftentimes be taking a hit before dealing one, so Recover is all the more important.</p> <p>The given EV spread gives Gastrodon as much power as possible while also giving it enough bulk to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Keldeo's Secret Sword. Although offensive Gastrodon can effectively run a number of different items to varying success, the two listed above have been proven to be the most effective. Wise Glasses give a 10% boost to all of Gastrodon's attacking moves, while Mystic Water boosts its Water-type attacks by 20%. Leftovers is probably the most viable of all the other options, as it gives Gastrodon a constant source of recovery while also potentially bluffing a defensive set. However, Gastrodon is relatively weak without any kind of boosting item, so the loss of power will be noticeable. A Life Orb can be used if Wise Glasses aren't powerful enough for you, but Gastrodon hates taking extra damage from recoil. If you do choose to run Life Orb, make sure to use an EV spread of 104 HP / 152 Def / 252 SpA to still avoid the 2HKO from Scarf Keldeo's Secret Sword and to also hit a Life Orb number to minimize recoil. A Choice Specs set can be used for more instant power and the ability to 2HKO even Blissey and Ferrothorn with +1 Surf in the rain. The biggest problem with Choice Specs, however, is that Gastrodon really doesn't like being locked into one move; it likes prefers the freedom of switching moves, as well as the ability to use Recover reliably. When running Choice Specs, Hidden Power Grass should be used over Recover to hit Rotom-W, Jellicent, Politoed, and other Gastrodon harder than anything else. Scald can be used over Surf for a chance to burn physical attackers, but the power drop is noticeable. Rain Dance can be used in the fourth slot for a last-ditch effort to win the weather war, but the loss of reliable recovery is usually not worth it. If outspeeding Chansey is important, a spread of 160 HP / 252 SpA / 96 Spe can be used, but Gastrodon becomes more susceptible to being 2HKOed by Keldeo's Secret Sword.</p> <p>When choosing teammates for offensive Gastrodon, you should always first consider Politoed, as Surf loses out on so much power that you really shouldn't be using offensive Gastrodon without Politoed anyway. Ferrothorn is once again a recommended partner because it can tank powerful attacks that threaten Gastrodon while also absorbing Toxic and resisting Grass-type moves. Ferrothorn can also provide Gastrodon with entry hazard support, which can make it all the more threatening. Toxicroak pairs well with Gastrodon because it can set up on Breloom, Ferrothorn, and Celebi that lack Psychic, while Tornadus can bust through Jellicent and Celebi with Hurricane for Gastrodon.</p> "

  "Garchomp": {
    "overview": "<p>Garchomp is one of the most versatile Pokemon in the OU metagame. Sporting great stat distribution across the board, an amazing typing, and above-average bulk, Garchomp is capable of filling many roles for a team. Garchomp's great Attack and Speed stats are augmented by powerful STAB moves, such as Outrage and Earthquake, that allow it to hit the majority of the tier for major damage with its STAB moves alone. While Ground / Dragon is a very good typing offensively, it cannot be disregarded defensively either. With an immunity to Electric, key resistances to Fire- and Rock-type moves, and above-average bulk, Garchomp is capable of checking strong attackers such as Thundurus-T, Tyranitar, and Heatran. However, while Garchomp has a good Speed stat, base 102 Speed just isn't what it used to be. Powerful threats such as Keldeo, Latios, and Terrakion are just some of the dangerous Pokemon that outspeed Garchomp. While Garchomp's Ground / Dragon typing is generally good defensively, it does remove its Water- and Grass-type resistances while only amplifying an Ice-type weakness that quite a few common Pokemon can exploit. Regardless, Garchomp is a very serious threat. It can begin to wreak havoc at a moment's notice, so be sure you have a way to handle it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Garchomp can utilize a Choice Band set to hit incredibly hard and function as a wallbreaker with more immediate power than its other sets, but it prefers using Swords Dance so it can switch between Dragon- and Ground-type moves against teams with cores like Ferrothorn and Thundurus-T. A combination of Protect, Toxic, and Rocky Helmet can cause incredible amounts of passive damage to physical attackers in conjunction with Rough Skin. Garchomp's only form of recovery is Rest, but this is far from reliable given the sleep mechanics in BW.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Garchomp is incredibly difficult to outright counter due to its versatility and wide movepool. Skarmory and Bronzong are generally the best choices, as they resist Outrage and are immune to Earthquake. Just make sure to keep them away from Fire Blast, especially from the mixed set. Outside of these two, however, dealing with Garchomp defensively largely comes down to prediction, as most defensive checks take one STAB move really well but can easily fall to the other. Steel-types such as Heatran, Jirachi, Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Forretress can all take Outrage pretty well. However, all of them can be swiftly eliminated with Earthquake or Fire Blast. Landorus-T and Gliscor are immune to Earthquake, but repeated Outrages can take their toll, while a Draco Meteor from the mixed set maims both of them on the spot.</p> <p>Using Speed to beat Garchomp is generally the safer route to take thanks to its movepool dealing with most defensive responses. Latios and Latias naturally outspeed Garchomp and can OHKO it with their powerful Draco Meteors. Choice Scarf Latios is most notable, as it will outspeed Garchomp even if it's benefiting from a Choice Scarf or Salac Berry boost. Choice Scarf Dragon-types such as Salamence, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon can destroy Garchomp with their powerful Outrages and Draco Meteors as long as Garchomp isn't benefiting from a boost in Speed or a Substitute. Mamoswine can bypass Garchomp's high Speed with Ice Shard, but Yache Berry variants can survive the attack and retaliate. Weavile isn't nearly as common as Mamoswine, but it too has Ice Shard to bypass boosted Speed, while Ice Punch allows it to KO Yache Berry variants. Priority from the likes of Breloom, Scizor, and Lucario can finish off Garchomp, but they need it to be weakened a fair bit, as Garchomp's physical bulk is nothing to scoff at.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With a great base 102 Speed and high-powered STAB moves, Garchomp makes for a great Choice Scarf user that is capable of revenge killing virtually every Speed-boosting sweeper in the OU tier. Outrage is Garchomp's strongest move and it is the ideal move to clean up with once Steel-types have been removed. Earthquake is a strong, reliable STAB move that does serious damage to Steel-types. Dual Chop is a secondary STAB move that can improve its matchup against Multiscale Dragonite and Focus Sash Alakazam, two large threats to offensive teams. Stealth Rock is a solid filler move that can be used alongside Stealth Rock Tyranitar in particular to enable Tyranitar to focus on checking important threats like Latios and Thundurus-T rather than having to set up Stealth Rock and check them simultaneously. If Dual Chop's slight chance of missing is worrisome, Dragon Claw is a good alternative filler for the fourth moveslot, as it has the same effective Base Power; however, it lacks the ability to punish Substitute Thundurus-T and beat Focus Sash Alakazam. Fire Blast can be used to hit Skarmory much harder than its STAB attacks can while also having a solid damage boost against Ferrothorn. Finally, Rock Slide is another coverage move that allows Garchomp to consistently revenge kill Volcarona without having to lock into Outrage and doesn't require any chip damage.</p> <p>Jolly is the given nature, but if you decide to use Fire Blast over Stone Edge, Naive should be used instead. Choice Scarf Garchomp is best classified as a glue Pokemon for offensive teams, as it provides these teams with a solid revenge killer and late-game cleaner in one teamslot. This set struggles with bulky Steel-types, as Choice Scarf Garchomp lacks the power of most of its other sets. Magnezone is a great remedy for this, as it can utilize Magnet Pull to trap and remove such bulky Steel-type Pokemon. As Choice Scarf Garchomp is a solid late-game cleaner, teammates that can weaken bulkier Pokemon are solid options. Latios, Terrakion, and Kyurem-B make good teammates here. While Garchomp is a fast Choice Scarf user, Keldeo, Terrakion, and Latios are all faster. As such, Breloom and Mamoswine have powerful priority moves that can keep these threats from running rampant on Garchomp's team.</p> "

        "description": "<p>When one looks at Garchomp's stat distribution, a Stealth Rock setter probably isn't the first thing that comes to mind. However, this exploits Garchomp's high offensive presence and above-average bulk to create a powerful Stealth Rock user for offensive teams to use. Stealth Rock is the obvious first move, as Garchomp's high offensive presence will deter the likes of Espeon and Xatu from trying to come in to block it. From there, Garchomp can proceed to inflict some serious damage on the opposing team. Outrage is Garchomp's strongest move, and is the move of choice whenever the opponent lacks a Steel-type to take it. Dragon Claw is a decent alternative that can be used for reliability at the cost of power. Earthquake is here to deal with the Steel-types that want to try taking Garchomp's Dragon-type STAB. It also swiftly eliminates Tentacruel, a common Rapid Spin user on rain teams. Fire Blast deals with Skarmory and Bronzong reliably as well as Forretress, another common Rapid Spin user. If these Steel-types don't cause your team problems, Swords Dance is a good option to allow Garchomp the ability to set up and sweep teams later in the match.</p> <p>The EV spread is simple, with the 4 extra EVs going to Special Attack. If Swords Dance is used, these EVs should be allocated to Defense and the nature should be changed to Jolly. Rocky Helmet is the primary item choice, as it will prevent any spinner from successfully removing hazards if they are at 29% HP or below, as they must survive any passive damage incurred from using Rapid Spin to remove the entry hazards. Focus Sash is an alternative if you're using Garchomp as more of a dedicated lead. This allows Garchomp to always beat opposing lead Terrakion, another common Stealth Rock user for offensive teams.</p> <p>This Garchomp can work very well on sun teams, as the sun powers up Garchomp's Fire Blast, thus making Ninetales a good teammate. Sun sweepers such as Volcarona appreciate Garchomp's ability to not only set up Stealth Rock reliably, but to also be able to weaken or outright KO many of their checks and counters to ease their sweep. Outside of sun teams, Garchomp can work quite well in \"Double Dragon\" cores. Kyurem-B, Dragonite, and Haxorus are solid Dragon-types to use in this type of a core with Garchomp. This Garchomp can beat most spinners, but it can have a hard time with Donphan and Starmie. For this reason, Jellicent is a great spinblocker, as it generally beats these two one-on-one while also being able to handle Forretress if Garchomp forgoes Fire Blast. Steel-types such as Heatran and Jirachi share good defensive synergy with Garchomp. Both have benefits, with Jirachi providing Garchomp with Wish support and Heatran being able to work on sun teams.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its high base 130 Attack and solid base 102 Speed, Garchomp makes for a deadly Swords Dance sweeper. After a single boost, Garchomp can, at worst, 2HKO the entire tier with its STAB moves alone, bar Skarmory and Bronzong. Swords Dance boosts Garchomp's Attack stat to let it hit at megaton levels of power. Outrage crushes all but the most defensive of Steel-types. However, due to the lock-in effect, Outrage is not always the right move. For this reason, Dragon Claw can provide a safer, albeit weaker, alternative that doesn't lock Garchomp in. Earthquake provides great power and reliability, as it gets rid of the likes of Ferrothorn and Jirachi, which can otherwise tank an Outrage or two. Despite this being a physical set, Fire Blast is still preferred, as it 2HKOes Skarmory and OHKOes Scizor without the need to boost, unlike Fire Fang. This can allow Garchomp to sort of wallbreak for itself if the need arises. If you're using Garchomp on a rain team, Aqua Tail is a solid move to hit all Steel-types, sans Ferrothorn, while also smacking Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Landorus-T without having to lock Garchomp into Outrage.</p> <p>Naive is the preferred nature to lessen Garchomp's reliance on Stealth Rock to 2HKO Skarmory and OHKO Scizor with Fire Blast. If Fire Blast isn't used, Jolly is the better option. The item choice with this set gives Garchomp the ability to get past certain threats. With a Yache Berry, Garchomp is able to survive unboosted Ice-type coverage moves from the likes of Choice Scarf Jirachi, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Keldeo. On the other hand, Lum Berry allows Garchomp to shrug off a paralysis or burn that could otherwise quickly end its chances of sweeping. Life Orb is an alternate hold item to juice up Garchomp's attacks even more and lessen the need to use Swords Dance to inflict severe damage. Dragon Gem allows Garchomp to lure in and KO tough physical walls, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon, that rely on their sheer bulk to stomach an Outrage.</p> <p>Swords Dance Garchomp fits very nicely onto \"DragMag\" teams. Magnezone and Magneton can trap and remove Steel-types and use Volt Switch to give Garchomp an easier time switching in. Salamence, Haxorus, and Dragonite are good Dragon-types to use on such teams, as they can team up with Garchomp to overwhelm their checks and counters should Magneton and Magnezone be unable to trap all of the opposing Steel-types successfully. Garchomp appreciates Wish support from Jirachi and Vaporeon to give it more opportunities to set up and sweep. Jirachi has better defensive synergy with Garchomp thanks to its Dragon-type resistance, but Vaporeon has Heal Bell to lessen the need for Garchomp to run Lum Berry to avoid status ailments. Strong physical attackers such as Terrakion and Kyurem-B can be used to weaken physical walls for Garchomp, thus lessening the need for it to spend a turn setting up with Swords Dance.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>This is a different take on Swords Dance, as it forgoes a coverage move to ease setup against defensive threats through the use of Substitute. Thanks to Substitute, Garchomp is able to more reliably set up on defensive threats that rely on status to cripple Garchomp to beat it, while also protecting Garchomp against common revenge killers such as Latios, Keldeo, and Terrakion. Outrage is the primary STAB move, as it will take out most things after a Swords Dance boost. However, because this Garchomp will generally be low on HP when it sweeps, a single turn of confusion could end Garchomp's chances of sweeping. For this reason, Dragon Claw is a safer alternative, but it lacks the power that Outrage has. Earthquake fills out the set by crushing any grounded Steel-type that tries to take Outrage.</p> <p>Salac Berry should almost always be used on this Garchomp, as the Speed boost makes it incredibly difficult to take down while smart use of Substitute can easily activate the Berry. Leftovers is an option to get passive recovery that can allow for setting up a couple more Substitutes, but this set has a hard time sweeping without a Salac Berry boost. This set absolutely needs Skarmory and Bronzong out of the way to have a chance at sweeping. Magneton and Magnezone can easily trap and remove these two Steel-types as long as neither is carrying a Shed Shell. While they can't trap these Steel-types, Heatran, Rotom-W, and Thundurus-T fare very well against them in most cases. Mamoswine can use Ice Shard to bypass a Salac Berry boost, meaning it will take out Garchomp if it lacks a Substitute. Rotom-W and Kyurem-B are solid responses to Mamoswine, as the Ice Shard will be very predictable. Faster Choice Scarf users that can still outspeed Garchomp after the Salac Berry boost include Keldeo, Terrakion, and Latios. Scizor can check Terrakion and Latios with Bullet Punch and Pursuit, respectively, while a Latias or Latios of your own can deal with Keldeo most of the time.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While most Garchomp run around throwing out powerful physical attacks, this set takes advantage of that by using heavy Special Attack investment and Draco Meteor to catch many of its typical responses off-guard. Even with more of a focus on Special Attack, Garchomp's strong offensive presence makes it a reliable user of Stealth Rock for more offensive-minded teams. Draco Meteor is the chosen Dragon-type STAB move for this set. Due to the heavy Special Attack investment, this allows Garchomp to deal serious damage to the likes of Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon, all of which typically rely on their sheer physical bulk to tank Outrage and Earthquake. Earthquake is still the Ground-type STAB move despite the focus on Special Attack. This gives Garchomp a reliable physical STAB option to deal with special walls that may want to try their luck after Garchomp reveals Draco Meteor. Fire Blast rounds off the set by crushing Steel-types like Forretress, Skarmory, and Bronzong that could take on this set with relative ease otherwise.</p> <p>As this set uses Draco Meteor to catch some of Garchomp's usual counters off-guard, maximum Special Attack investment is used to make Draco Meteor, as well as Fire Blast, as strong as possible. Naive is used so the power of Earthquake isn't gimped. While Rocky Helmet is an option to quickly rack up damage on Rapid Spin and U-turn users, this set really needs the power provided from Life Orb to have the kick it needs behind Draco Meteor. Should you be using this set on a rain team, Surf should be used over Fire Blast.</p> <p>As this Garchomp set is great at flushing out the likes of Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon and blasting them with Draco Meteor, it stands to reason that teammates that benefit from them being KOed or significantly weakened are great choices. Terrakion is a prime example of this, as those are quite possibly the three best answers to most Terrakion sets. Lucario, Salamence, and Haxorus are other choices that can take advantage of these defensive stalwarts being weakened or outright KOed. While this Garchomp is great at removing physical walls, the opponent may be inclined to bring in a special wall after seeing Draco Meteor. For this reason, Volcarona, Starmie, and Latios can make for good teammates, as Earthquake still ruins Chansey and Blissey. Ninetales is a good teammate, as the sunlight it provides powers up Garchomp's Fire Blast, while Garchomp can still handle Terrakion quite nicely. As with most other Garchomp sets, Steel-types such as Jirachi and Heatran are good options to soak up the Dragon- and Ice-type moves aimed at Garchomp.</p> "

Stealth Rock is the only entry hazard Garchomp has access to, but it is very important in punishing the opponent's switches and racking up damage on Pokemon such as Volcarona, Thundurus-T, and Dragonite. Physically defensive EV investment provides solid bulk overall and allows Garchomp to check physical attackers such as Terrakion, Jirachi, Scizor, and Tyranitar. Earthquake is Garchomp's strongest Ground-type STAB move and is fully needed to hit the listed physical attackers, and Dragon Tail allows Garchomp to phaze defensive Pokemon and keep momentum against offensive Pokemon. Fire Blast can be used to prevent Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory from setting hazards up and hits offensive Steel-types, such as Scizor, while Toxic allows Garchomp to wear down its most common checks in Hippowdon, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T.</p> <p>Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin provides a solid defensive backbone for Garchomp, allowing it to deal heavy damage to physical attackers while not attacking itself, especially against U-turn spammers. The given EVs allow Garchomp to take as many physical moves as possible and bully users of recoil while running enough Speed EVs to outspeed Skarmory, Breloom, and Toxicroak; however, you can opt for a maximum HP and Defense spread because it allows Garchomp to take multiples hits from Terrakion and Gyarados. Some specially defensive bulk could be worth considering as well for moves such as Hidden Power Ice from Landorus-T, Volcarona, and Keldeo. Endure can be used to make full use of Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin and help Garchomp stay alive in a pinch. Rest allows Garchomp to easily recover from status inflictions; however, make sure you are running a cleric to rid Garchomp of its sleep. Swords Dance can be an option, as it allows Garchomp to easily KO defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon with Earthquake; however, Surf is better against rain teams because it can hit Donphan, Landorus-T, and Gliscor without any setup. Garchomp doesn't have a recovery move outside of Rest, so having a Wish user can be an asset. Psychic-types appreciate Garchomp's presence, as it can weaken most Steel-types such as Jirachi, Scizor, and Metagross with Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin damage.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Giving Riolu its own OU analysis may seem like a joke at first glance thanks to its bantam base stats, none of which exceed 70, but the Dream World has bestowed upon it a gift that makes common annoyers such as Jirachi and SubProtect Gliscor seem like pleasures to battle against: Prankster. With Prankster and its access to Copycat and Roar, Riolu can take on a niche as a priority phazer, something that no other Pokemon in the entire game can emulate. In addition, with the aforementioned combination of Prankster and Copycat, Riolu can also serve as an emergency revenge killer against severely weakened Pokemon.</p> <p>However, not all is good for this little jackal, for there remain quite a few ways of derailing its Copycat-Roar strategy. Just like any Pokemon with Prankster, Magic Bounce Pokemon can turn Riolu's strategy on its head (in this case, by reflecting its priority phazing back upon it). In addition, Pokemon with Magic Guard can afford to be tossed around by Riolu, thanks to their immunity to hazard damage. Also, Protect users and faster priority attacks throw Riolu off, since Protect always goes before priority moves. In addition, even with an Eviolite attached to it, Riolu is incredibly frail, so it requires an immense amount of support to get off that first Roar. However, it would be absurd to disregard Riolu as a threat, because once it gets that first Roar off, Riolu can win the game for you.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Riolu doesn't exactly have much to abuse with Prankster other than Agility, Iron Defense, Toxic, and Screech. Agility bolsters Riolu's Speed, allowing it to Copycat a Roar before Breloom's Mach Punch or Mamoswine's Ice Shard hits it, and Iron Defense braces Riolu for attacks such as Terrakion's Close Combat or Garchomp's Earthquake. Toxic helps break bulky walls and gives Riolu a way to annoy the opponent even after Copycat runs out of PP. If Riolu is paired up with a physical attacker, Screech is an option that helps force even more switches. Crunch hits both Magic Bouncers super effectively, but is otherwise an unreliable option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Riolu's largest fears are Xatu and Espeon, since they can turn Riolu's Copycat + Roar game against it, while also resisting Riolu's STAB and carrying moves that hit it super effectively. Alakazam, Reuniclus, Bronzong, and Gliscor don't exactly mind being phazed by Riolu, thanks to their abilities and typing. Also, Mr. Mime and other Pokemon with Soundproof will stop the chain in its tracks, thanks to their immunity to Roar. With the given EV spread, Riolu can Copycat a Roar against slower priority users such as Choice Band Scizor, but its priority phazing strategy falls flat against any Pokemon with a priority move and Speed greater than 169. Examples of such Pokemon are Dragonite, Mamoswine, Breloom, and anything with Fake Out and Extreme Speed, moves that transcend the priority given to Riolu's moves by Prankster. Protect ruins Riolu's Copycat + Roar game for the exact same reasons as Fake Out and Extreme Speed.</p> ",

After hazards have been laid down, Riolu can use Roar and Copycat to severely weaken, and in many cases, even sweep the opponent's team. Copycat and Roar are placed in the first two moveslots, as they form the crux of Riolu's strategy. Drain Punch gives Riolu a means of attacking when Copycat runs out of PP, and Substitute provides Riolu with a safety blanket against priority moves and status.</p> <p>The EVs and nature, factoring in the Eviolite boost, give Riolu 283 HP, 216 Defense, and 231 Special Defense, and enough Speed to Copycat a Roar before Scizor Bullet Punches Riolu into oblivion. Alternatively, a faster spread of 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe can be used with a Timid nature and Focus Sash if you want Riolu to outpace threats up to Adamant Breloom, which Riolu outspeeds by one point. Some EVs can be allotted to Special Attack if you need Riolu to Copycat attacks such as Starmie's Thunder and Latios's Draco Meteor. Riolu can run Sunny Day or Rain Dance if opposing weather is a bother to it.</p> <p>Due to the nature of Riolu's strategy, entry hazards are mandatory when using it. Crustle stands out among all those that can supply the hazards demanded by Riolu, since it can get Stealth Rock and at least one layer of Spikes down quickly with Custap Berry, thanks to its low speed for a Spikes user. A spinblocker can and should be used to keep hazards up on the opponent's side of the field so Riolu can phaze with little difficulties. Among the spinblockers available, Gengar works best, due to its incredible speed and offensive prowess. Tyranitar is a fantastic partner, since it can easily remove Xatu and Espeon from play, though it should be noted that Sand Stream renders Focus Sash useless. Riolu enjoys having a late-game sweeper like Salamence or Breloom that can clean up the remains of teams that Riolu has chewed through.</p> "

The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>One of the most threatening sweepers in DPP OU, Lucario has returned to the BW OU battlefield with some new toys. BW increased Extreme Speed's priority to +2, which means Mach Punch Infernape, among other such Pokemon, can no longer check it. In addition, the Dream World gave Lucario an ability it can actually make good use of: Justified. With this ability, Lucario gains an Attack boost upon getting hit by any Dark-type attack, which it can easily switch into thanks to its 4x resistance to Dark. Lucario also has a rare 4x resistance to Stealth Rock, which makes it difficult to wear it down with entry hazards. Its Steel typing brings it an immunity to Toxic; it therefore doesn't have to worry about poison damage prematurely ending its sweeps. However, there are many Pokemon capable of beating Lucario, such as Terrakion and Conkeldurr. Lucario also has four moveslot syndrome, which prevents it from covering every single relevant threat. Despite its flaws, however, Lucario is a deadly sweeper that will destroy any team not prepared for it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With good offensive stats and a good movepool, Lucario has quite a few more options. Stone Edge can be used on the Swords Dance set in order to hit Gyarados, while still hitting Pokemon such as Dragonite hard. As Lucario's Special Attack stat is actually higher than its Attack stat, a Nasty Plot set might seem appealing at first glance. However, too many faster Pokemon—including Alakazam and Starmie—resist Vacuum Wave, so it is not as effective as the Swords Dance set. An Agility set might seem appealing as it can beat typical revenge killers such as Terrakion and Choice Scarf Tyranitar, but it is very weak and Breloom can easily revenge kill it with Mach Punch. Calm Mind boosts Lucario's Special Defense while also raising its Special Attack, but Lucario's frailty makes this a pointless endeavor and Keldeo does Calm Mind better anyway.</p> <p>Lucario can use Choice sets to decent effect, particularly Choice Specs. However, the likes of Latios, Scizor, and Terrakion do these better. Lucario can make use of an Air Balloon to set up on Pokemon such as Landorus-T Choice-locked into Earthquake, but it will miss the extra damage output from Life Orb, making its damage output noticeably lower against Pokemon such as Skarmory. Lucario has another ability, Steadfast, which boosts its Speed by one stage when it is flinched. However, because flinching moves are almost always paired up with paralysis, Steadfast is not a good choice.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Physically defensive Unaware Quagsire is one of the few physical walls that can take on Lucario and live to tell the tale. It cannot reliably switch in on Close Combat, but thanks to Unaware, it ignores Lucario's stat boosts, and can easily take Close Combat and retaliate with Earthquake. Hippowdon too can sponge +2 Close Combat and OHKO Lucario with Earthquake, but it will be severely weakened afterwards, and will fall to +3 Close Combat. Gliscor is capable of taking anything but Ice Punch, and can also OHKO Lucario with Earthquake; faster variants of Gliscor can check even Ice Punch Lucario. Sableye, although uncommon, can burn Lucario with Prankster Will-O-Wisp before Crunch does massive damage to it, which makes Lucario much easier to deal with.</p> <p>There are other Pokemon that can check Lucario, depending on which moves it uses. In particular, Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Salamence, Landorus-T, and Gyarados, can come in on Lucario as it uses Swords Dance, take +1 Extreme Speed, and OHKO with the appropriate move. However, if Lucario carries Ice Punch, Salamence and Landorus-T must be careful of switching in. Jellicent and Slowbro can both comfortably wall and force out Lucario that lack Crunch, while Reuniclus can OHKO it with Focus Blast. Gengar can check Lucario that lack Bullet Punch and OHKO it with Focus Blast.</p> <p>If all else fails, revenge killing Lucario is always an option. Celebi and Jirachi only need 176 Speed EVs to outspeed neutral-natured Lucario, and can both take a boosted Extreme Speed and OHKO Lucario with a super effective attack. Choice Scarf users such as Heatran, Terrakion, and Tyranitar also outspeed Lucario, and can take it on due to their resistance to Extreme Speed, though the latter two must look out for Bullet Punch.</p> ",

As soon as Lucario sets up a Swords Dance boost, not many Pokemon will be able to take its attacks. Even Skarmory is almost always OHKOed by a +2 Close Combat after Stealth Rock, which is a testament to how powerful a boosted Lucario is.

If Gliscor and Landorus-T threaten the team, Ice Punch is the preferred option; however, if you need Lucario to handle Jellicent, Reuniclus, and Slowbro, use Crunch instead.

However, a Jolly nature is not that useful outside of these threats because most Pokemon who use Speed-boosting natures to outspeed Lucario will get nailed by Extreme Speed; the increase in power is generally more useful.</p> <p>High Jump Kick is worth considering over Close Combat due to its ability to deal more damage to certain physical walls, such as Hippowdon and Skarmory. With High Jump Kick, Lucario has a decent chance to OHKO Hippowdon at +2 after one layer of Spikes, and will always OHKO Skarmory after Stealth Rock. However, its 90% accuracy makes it less appealing, especially considering Lucario loses 50% of its health if it misses. In addition to this, Pokemon such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Politoed might be seen using Protect, which makes High Jump Kick even more risky to use. Using High Jump Kick means Lucario no longer suffers from defense drops, but the defense drops due to using Close Combat do not really matter because Lucario isn't surviving any non-resisted hit regardless.</p> <p>Lucario's ability choice comes down to the user's preference. Justified is generally more useful as this allows it to gain an additional Attack boost upon switching in on Dark-type attacks. In addition, although there are few users of Dark-type attacks in OU, the only common user of flinching moves in OU, Jirachi, cannot reliably beat Justified Lucario. However, Inner Focus is still worth considering because this gives Lucario a better chance against Jirachi.</p> <p>As Lucario has poor defenses, the best way for it to set up is to use teammates that attract Crunch and Pursuit, such as Latios, Latias, and Gengar. If Lucario isn't using Bullet Punch, enemy Gengar are solid checks that can OHKO Lucario with Focus Blast; Choice Scarf Tyranitar can in turn trap Gengar with Pursuit. Conkeldurr will also prove to be difficult for Lucario to handle, as it can take even +3 Extreme Speed and OHKO with Mach Punch. Slowbro is a good teammate to handle Conkeldurr as it can take care of Conkeldurr with STAB Psychic. As Slowbro is also slower than Conkeldurr, Payback will only hit it for a low 50 Base Power. Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Dragonite, Choice Band Terrakion, and mixed Salamence can wear down physical walls such as Slowbro and Hippowdon, which makes it easier for Lucario to sweep. Spikes support from the likes of Skarmory can also help Lucario muscle through physical tanks, including the aforementioned Slowbro and Hippowdon.</p> "

  "Hippowdon": {
    "overview": "<p>In BW2, a reliable way to keep rain off the field is more important than ever, and this is where Hippowdon comes in. Hippowdon is the single most durable weather inducer, as it has titanic physical bulk and reliable recovery. Aside from being a useful asset in weather wars, Hippowdon is one of the best physical walls in OU, capable of going toe-to-toe with some of the most notorious physical attackers in OU such as Terrakion, Dragonite, and Lucario.</p> <p>Despite its defensive prowess and ability to combat weather teams, Hippowdon is not without its flaws. Its mediocre special bulk and weaknesses to common special attacking types, namely Water, Grass, and Ice, leave it exposed to Pokemon with such attacks. Hippowdon is also quite slow and will need to take two hits when switching in before he gets a chance to do anything, limiting the amount of switch-in opportunities it gets. Finally, even though Hippowdon's Attack is big for a defensive Pokemon, it is easy to set up on with Pokemon that have Taunt or don't mind Earthquake.</p> <p>All in all, Hippowdon is a superb defensive Pokemon that provides valuable team support with few weaknesses that can be covered by its teammates and can cause big trouble to any team not prepared for it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hippowdon can take the role of a tank and take advantage of its Dream World ability, Sand Force, by using a set with max Attack and HP and a moveset of Earthquake, Stone Edge, Ice Fang or Superpower, and Slack Off, but it is usually outclassed by Landorus-T and Garchomp, both of which can actually outspeed Pokemon and are better at keeping momentum. Rock Slide or Stone Edge can be used on the physically defensive set to deal with Gyarados, Volcarona, and Thundurus-T better, but this set has no business staying in against them anyway. Finally, Stockpile makes Hippowdon very difficult to OHKO after a few boosts, but powerful special attackers still 2HKO it, and defensive Pokemon can Toxic it or phaze it out while Hippowdon itself can't do much damage back, making Stockpile a gimmick at best.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Xatu is probably the best counter to Hippowdon, as it is immune to Earthquake, bounces back Stealth Rock, and has Toxic to put Hippowdon on a timer. The easiest way to bring Hippowdon down is with special Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks. Rotom-W, Celebi, Breloom, Taunt Gyarados, defensive Politoed, and SubRoost Kyurem-B can all switch into Hippowdon with ease and force it out. There are more special attackers that can dent Hippowdon, if not OHKO it, such as Keldeo and offensive Starmie, but they have to avoid Earthquake, which does serious damage to them. Other problematic Pokemon for Hippowdon are those that don't mind its attacks and can set up hazards or cripple it with Toxic such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Bronzong. Hippowdon is often the target of lure strategies due to its resilience and difficulty to bring down, so using mixed attackers, such as Salamence, Ice Beam Tyranitar, and Grass Knot Thundurus-T, is a good way to eliminate or weaken Hippowdon. Finally, Trick, Toxic, burns, and accumulated damage from Spikes are all good ways to hamper Hippowdon's ability to function as a wall.</p> ",

        "name": "Physical Wall",
        "description": "<p>This set trades the ability to handle some special Pokemon and to fare better against weather inducers to become the most physically bulky Pokemon in OU. Hippowdon is able to wall the strongest physical attackers in OU, such as non-Choice Band Terrakion, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Swords Dance Lucario. Earthquake hits many of the Pokemon that Hippowdon walls for super effective damage and is a strong attack that prevents any offensive Pokemon not resistant or immune to it from setting up on Hippowdon. Hippowdon can force many Pokemon out and has reliable recovery, thus making for a very reliable Stealth Rock setter. Ice Fang hits what Earthquake can't, including Dragonite, Salamence, and Landorus-T, while Whirlwind prevents anything that doesn't care about Hippowdon's attacks from setting up and works well with entry hazards.</p> <p>Toxic is useful for crippling Rotom-W, Politoed, and Landorus-T, all of which are common switch-ins to Hippowdon. Sand Force can be used for any team that doesn't want sandstorm, such as sun teams, where Hippowdon handles many of the Pokemon that give them trouble, including Terrakion and physical Dragon-types. This set doesn't need any other dedicated physical walls as teammates, as it covers the physical side very well. What it needs are partners that can deal with the few physical Pokemon that can get past Hippowdon, namely Gyarados, Mamoswine, and Breloom. Rotom-W covers the first two Pokemon and has good defensive synergy with Hippowdon, while specially defensive Celebi counters Breloom, checks Gyarados with Perish Song, and handles most special attacks aimed at Hippowdon. Speaking of Celebi, Pokemon that can sponge special attacks are obligatory teammates, so specially defensive Ferrothorn and Amoonguss are good choices as well. Lastly, Rapid Spin support greatly aids Hippowdon, as the common entry hazard setters all easily set up on it, hindering its effectiveness as a physical wall. Starmie and Forretress are the best options; Starmie can take some weaker Water-type attacks and check Gyarados and Mamoswine, while Forretress checks Mamoswine and sets up entry hazards that Hippowdon can take advantage of with Whirlwind.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Mixed Wall",
        "description": "<p>Hippowdon has excellent physical bulk even when uninvested, so with the added special bulk Hippowdon becomes a great mixed wall that is difficult for many special attackers to OHKO without a strong STAB move. This set is also probably the best counter to any Calm Mind Jirachi, which is annoying for any team to deal with, and can switch into defensive variants of Ninetales and Politoed with relative ease, giving fierce competition in the weather war. Despite the lack of Defense investment, Hippowdon can still handle many physical attackers, such as Dragonite, unboosted Terrakion, and Toxicroak, well. Earthquake, backed up by a good base 112 Attack and STAB, hits any Pokemon without lot of physical bulk and not resistant or immune to it hard. Stealth Rock is a necessity for any team, and Hippowdon finds ample opportunities to set it up against the multitude of Pokemon that it walls. Everything that doesn't mind Earthquake is phazed by Whirlwind, making it very hard for stat boosters to set up in front of Hippowdon, but Ice Fang allows Hippowdon to immediately take care of Pokemon that it checks, such as Dragonite, Garchomp, Salamence, and Landorus-T; it also allows Hippowdon to break the Air Balloon that many Heatran carry.</p> <p>A Careful nature is the best choice to avoid certain OHKOs and 2HKOs from specific Pokemon—Volcarona, Latias, Thundurus-T, and Jolteon—but Impish is a perfectly viable option for teams that have those threats covered. Toxic cripples many popular switch-ins to Hippowdon, such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and defensive Politoed, making it a good option if Hippowdon has a moveslot to spare. Rock Slide and Stone Edge are decent alternatives to Ice Fang as they still hit a few Flying-types for good damage, while being particularly useful against Thundurus-T and Volcarona, two Pokemon that Hippowdon checks well. Rock Slide is more reliable and has more PP, whereas Stone Edge can OHKO most Volcarona after sandstorm damage and Thundurus-T after sandstorm and Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Hippowdon's best teammates are those that can take strong Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks as well as very powerful special attacks such as Latios's Draco Meteor. Specially defensive Celebi is a great partner, as it counters most Water-types as well as Breloom and Life Orb Latios. Latias has similar resistances to Celebi and handles most of the Pokemon that Celebi does, making it an equally valuable partner for Hippowdon. Rapid Spin support is essential for Hippowdon because most hazard setters, namely Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Forretress, easily set up on it. Starmie and Forretress both have decent defensive synergy with Hippowdon and protect the team from hazards. This set also appreciates Pokemon that can take hits from or at least check powerful physical attackers that can break through Hippowdon, such as Choice Band Terrakion and Swords Dance Lucario, so Gengar, Jellicent, and defensive Gyarados pair well with Hippowdon. Spikes and Toxic Spikes setters are natural candidates for teammates of Hippowdon, as its ability to easily switch in and start phazing with Whirlwind quickly racks up entry hazard damage. Forretress, Ferrothorn, and Roserade are all good Pokemon for this role and have good overall synergy with Hippowdon. Finally, a Ghost-type Pokemon to protect those hazards is useful, and Jellicent is the best Pokemon for this role, covering Hippowdon's weaknesses, except for Grass-type attacks, well.</p> "

  "Toxicroak": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Toxicroak is a Pokemon designed to function well on rain teams. It takes no damage from Water-type attacks, has passive recovery under rain, and has access to two boosting moves, Swords Dance and Bulk Up, as well as good coverage options, allowing it to check or bust through many Pokemon that rain teams struggle against such as Ferrothorn, Chansey, Tentacruel, Keldeo, and Breloom. With a bulky set, it is also a useful check to one of the tier's most threatening Pokemon, Terrakion. However, other than its Attack, Toxicroak has poor stats and it relies a lot on rain to be useful. Depending on the set it runs, Toxicroak is also walled by common OU Pokemon such as Jellicent, Hippowdon, Gyarados, and Skarmory. At the end of the day, Toxicroak is an instrumental Pokemon for rain teams that helps them overcome some of their most common weaknesses, and even though it has some significant flaws, its positive traits make up for them with the right support.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxicroak has access to Nasty Plot and Vacuum Wave, allowing it to use a special set to decent success, but Toxicroak's low Special Attack makes such a set have few merits outside of the surprise factor. Work Up is another option, if only for hitting with both physical and special priority, but it is a gimmick at best; Swords Dance is better for wallbreaking anyway. Toxicroak can take advantage of its second STAB by using Poison Jab, to hit Pokemon such as Celebi, Gyarados, and Volcarona for better damage than with any other move, but it leaves Toxicroak helpless against the numerous Ground-types that are found in OU. Although situational, Toxic can cripple quite a few of Toxicroak's checks and counters, namely Jellicent, Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon, making it a decent option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Physically defensive Hippowdon, RestTalk Gyarados, Jellicent, and Sableye are the best counters to any Toxicroak set. Garchomp, Kyurem-B, Landorus-T, Intimidate Salamence, and Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi are some of the best checks to Swords Dance Toxicroak, as they can switch into most of its moves, survive even a +2 Sucker Punch, and OHKO back. The Bulk Up set is less prone to revenge killing and more prone to getting walled, as it is very weak without a couple of boosts under its belt. For this reason, physically defensive Skarmory, Reuniclus, Slowbro, and Volcarona are good counters to that set. As for revenge killing, any Pokemon that outspeeds Toxicroak, can live a +2 Sucker Punch, and OHKO Toxicroak in return works; Pokemon that fit this criteria include Kyurem-B, Landorus-T, and Choice Band Scizor. Faster Substitute users such as Alakazam and Gengar, can bypass Sucker Punch and dent Toxicroak with their STAB moves. Finally, sun teams are troubling for Toxicroak as they take away its passive recovery and make it lose HP each turn, reducing its lifespan.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>With unresisted neutral coverage and a good Attack stat, Toxicroak is very hard to wall after a boost. It's not difficult for Toxicroak to get an opportunity to use Swords Dance, as it can easily switch into many Pokemon that are problematic for rain teams, namely Keldeo, Ferrothorn, Chansey, and Tentacruel, and gain a free boost as they switch out. A notable advantage of Toxicroak over other sweepers is that it can't be worn down under rain (making Politoed a mandatory teammate) thanks to Dry Skin and Drain Punch, making it much more difficult to play around. Drain Punch gains STAB and allows Toxicroak to remain healthy even after taking severe damage, while packing serious power at +2 Attack. Sucker Punch complements Drain Punch nicely, providing almost unresisted neutral coverage, good Base Power, and priority, preventing Toxicroak from getting revenge killed by faster threats, including Latios, Starmie, and Alakazam. Finally, Ice Punch covers the few threats that the other attacking moves don't, maiming Gliscor, Landorus-T, Garchomp, Dragonite, and Hippowdon.</p> <p>The Speed EVs allow Toxicroak to outspeed Jolly Breloom, and the rest are thrown into Attack and HP. An Adamant nature is usually the better option, as both Toxicroak's Attack stat and the Base Power of its STAB move leaves something to be desired, and Sucker Punch helps against many faster Pokemon anyway. However, with a Jolly nature, Toxicroak outspeeds Jolly Mamoswine, Timid Heatran, and SubToxic Gliscor variants, all important targets that could otherwise OHKO Toxicroak. If you find Drain Punch's power lacking, Cross Chop is an option that allows Toxicroak to OHKO 252 HP Jirachi after a boost, preventing it from paralyzing Toxicroak; unfortunately, the lowered accuracy is a letdown.</p> <p>Toxicroak should always be used on rain teams, so Politoed is an obligatory teammate. Stealth Rock and Spikes support are useful for Toxicroak, as with them on the field it can secure the OHKO or 2HKO on various threats after a boost, including Haxorus, Choice Scarf Politoed, and Salamence with Sucker Punch; 252 HP Jirachi and Volcarona with Drain Punch; and Gyarados with Ice Punch. Ferrothorn is an excellent partner that can set up both entry hazards and switch into many Pokemon that Toxicroak struggles against such as Hippowdon, Gyarados, Garchomp, and Kyurem-B. Celebi also has good defensive synergy with Toxicroak, sets up Stealth Rock, and takes care of Hippowdon and Gyarados with a specially defensive set. Offensive Starmie and Choice Scarf Keldeo are able to outspeed and KO almost everything that checks or walls Toxicroak, creating a very potent offensive duo. Generally, Swords Dance Toxicroak thrives in rain offense teams that need a way to handle Keldeo, Terrakion, Chansey, Blissey, Tentacruel, Breloom, and Ferrothorn, all Pokemon that Toxicroak can set up against easily.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Bulk Up",
        "description": "<p>With Bulk Up and significant HP and Defense investment, Toxicroak is able to become a formidable bulky sweeper. Being immune to Scald and Toxic is always nice for a physical sweeper that plans on staying in for a long time, and Toxicroak's resistances allow it to set up against a variety of Pokemon such as Terrakion, Keldeo, Tentacruel, and Conkeldurr. To top it off, Drain Punch and Dry Skin ensure that Toxicroak will almost always be in good shape. After a single boost, it is almost impossible to take down Toxicroak from the physical side, and most Pokemon that can—mainly Ground-types—are all afraid of Ice Punch. Drain Punch is Toxicroak's STAB and healing tool, while Ice Punch hits common switch-ins to Toxicroak for super effective damage, including Gliscor, Dragonite, Garchomp, and Landorus-T. Sucker Punch provides Toxicroak with almost unresisted neutral coverage, bar opposing Toxicroak, when combined with Drain Punch, and has priority, but it can leave Toxicroak struggling against Pokemon that don't care about Drain Punch and have non-attacking moves, namely Jellicent, Disable Gengar, and Perish Song Celebi. Substitute rounds off the set by giving Toxicroak a way to avoid status, revenge killers, and Leech Seed, and is almost penalty-free as Dry Skin and Black Sludge heal Toxicroak for 18.5% of its health each turn.</p> <p>The HP and Defense EVs prevent any Terrakion variant from 2HKOing Toxicroak after Stealth Rock in rain. 12 Speed EVs are used to outspeed defensive Rotom-W, allowing Toxicroak to set up a Substitute before it gets neutered by status, and the rest of the EVs are thrown into Attack. Swords Dance is an alternative to Bulk Up, to pose a more immediate threat, but the unboosted physical defense of Toxicroak will allow many faster physical attackers to get past it. Payback is the only attacking move that can break through Jellicent, so it is a solid choice that still offers the excellent neutral coverage given by Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Rain is what makes this set last long enough to be dangerous, so Politoed should be used as a teammate. Because Hippowdon, Skarmory, Jellicent, Celebi with Psychic, and Reuniclus all counter Toxicroak, any Celebi variant pairs very well with it to cover its weaknesses to Ground- and Psychic-type moves. Nasty Plot Celebi can set up against Hippowdon, Jellicent, and Reuniclus and proceed to wreak havoc, while the specially defensive set with Perish Song beats all of the previously mentioned Pokemon bar Skarmory. Toxicroak also loves Toxic and Toxic Spikes support to get past many of the Pokemon that wall it, particularly Jellicent, Hippowdon, and Slowbro. Tentacruel is an excellent partner with access to Toxic, Toxic Spikes, and Rapid Spin to support Toxicroak. Bulky Starmie with Toxic is a good lure for Jellicent and Slowbro, and is also able to clear the field of any entry hazards that Skarmory or Hippowdon may have set up against Toxicroak.</p> "

        "name": "SubPunch",
        "description": "<p>A middle road between the Swords Dance and Bulk Up sets, SubPunch Toxicroak has both immediate power and bulk. Substitute protects Toxicroak from status, lets it use Focus Punch safely, and works well with Dry Skin. Sucker Punch is useful priority and coverage against Starmie, Celebi, Alakazam, and many faster Pokemon in general, while also allowing Toxicroak to set up a Substitute against a foe and then kill it the next turn with Sucker Punch, keeping its Substitute intact. Payback is stronger than Sucker Punch against faster foes, and more reliable, but it doesn't have priority and is too weak against any Pokemon slower than Toxicroak. Ice Punch covers the Ground- and Flying-type Pokemon that prey on Toxicroak such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Dragonite.</p> <p>12 Speed EVs allow Toxicroak to outspeed defensive Rotom-W and set up a Substitute before it is afflicted with status. Attack is maximized, and the rest of the EVs go to HP. Life Orb gives Toxicroak some much needed power, while Black Sludge improves its durability and its ability to PP stall with Substitute. Drain Punch can be used over any coverage move in order to have a reliable STAB move, just in case Toxicroak needs to attack with a STAB move without a Substitute.</p> <p>Politoed support is a requirement for this set to work. Celebi helps Toxicroak against most Ground- and Psychic-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Reuniclus. Scarf Thundurus-T and Jolteon beat Jellicent, Garchomp, Landorus-T, and many faster Pokemon that can OHKO Toxicroak. Finally, Terrakion is a fine partner and forms a dual Fighting-type core with Toxicroak, where each Pokemon weakens the other's counters.</p> "

        "name": "Toxic Stall",
        "description": "<p>This set takes a more stalling approach and makes use of Toxicroak's unique traits. Firstly, its superb defensive typing allows it to counter some of the most threatening Pokemon in OU, Keldeo and Tyranitar; second, Dry Skin provides it with extra healing under rain; and third, it can lure and cripple most of its counters with Toxic. For example, Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Jellicent, and Sableye, common checks or counters to the other sets, all despise Toxic and can easily get Toxic stalled to death with the use of Protect or Substitute. This set also helps significantly rain teams to win the war of attrition against Hippowdon, which otherwise is quite a pain to take down.</p> <p>Protect works well with Dry Skin and Toxic; it enhances Toxicroak's ability to stall for Toxic damage and heal, allows Toxicroak to heal big amounts of health under rain, and gives it the ability to scout for Choice-locked attacks. Substitute works better against slower opponents and prevents status from the likes of Jellicent, Rotom-W, and Amoonguss, enabling Toxicroak to beat them one-on-one. Substitute also eases prediction and ensures that Toxicroak will hit the incoming Pokemon with the right move. Drain Punch hits many Pokemon that are immune to Toxic—such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Magnezone—hard, and provides Toxicroak with another way to keep itself healthy. Bulk Up lets Toxicroak defeat some of its counters, namely Tentacruel, specially defensive Jirachi, and Skarmory in a last-Pokemon situation, while also making Toxicroak a bigger threat in the long term. It is also worth noting that Toxic + Drain Punch + Bulk Up is a great combination as it is walled only by a few Pokemon viable in OU, those being Skarmory, Starmie, Xatu, Celebi with Psychic or Perish Song, Espeon, Gengar, Reuniclus, and Gliscor, and of those, only a handful of these are commonly seen. On the other hand, Ice Punch scores super effective hits on some Pokemon that check or counter Toxicroak, such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Dragonite, making sure that Toxicroak won't become setup bait for any of those Pokemon. For example, Toxic does nothing to Dragon Dance Dragonite with Lum Berry and doesn't KO Swords Dance Garchomp quickly enough to prevent it from doing serious damage to Toxicroak's team.</p> <p>12 Speed EVs are used to outspeed uninvested Rotom-W and set up a Substitute before Rotom-W statuses Toxicroak, or to hit it for some decent damage with Drain Punch. The rest of the EVs go into HP and Defense to allow Toxicroak to hard-counter Keldeo and Terrakion. Sucker Punch is an option on the last slot if Toxicroak's team is desperately in need of priority, but Bulk Up and Ice Punch provide more utility overall.</p> <p>Politoed is a necessary teammate in order to allow Toxicroak to stall properly. While hard counters to this set are few, they all wall Toxicroak completely and make it a liability, so teammates to deal with those Pokemon are important. Weavile deals with Gengar, Celebi, Starmie, Xatu, Espeon, and Reuniclus to an extent, trapping them with Pursuit or hitting them hard if they stay in. Choice Scarf Scizor can trap some of those Pokemon too and can switch into most of them easily, while getting its Fire weakness halved in rain.</p> "

Old threats, specifically Breloom, have become better equipped to punish it. However, Abomasnow is still viable as a weather starter in OU, as its unique typing offers four key resistances and its solid offensive movepool lets it check and hit a wide variety of threats such as Garchomp, Heatran, and Rotom-W.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Giga Drain can be used on the mixed and physical sets over Wood Hammer for extra recovery. However, it is not recommended, as Wood Hammer is just so much more powerful than Giga Drain. Focus Blast may also seem like a logical choice on the mixed set; however, its shaky accuracy makes it an unfavorable choice. Additionally, Earthquake and Hidden Power Fire have similar coverage to Focus Blast, making it redundant. Abomasnow does have access to Swords Dance, but due to its abysmal Speed stat, it cannot fully take advantage of a +2 boost to its Attack stat. Equipping Abomasnow with Choice Specs or Choice Band might seem like a decent idea, but they would require excess switching, which is not recommended for a Pokemon with a Stealth Rock weakness. The same is true for Choice Scarf Abomasnow, which is outsped by positive natured base 115s and other Choice Scarf Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The downside of Abomasnow's typing is its crippling weakness to Stealth Rock, which arguably functions as the most reliable check to Abomasnow. Fire-, Steel-, and Fighting-types, such as Volcarona, Metagross, and Terrakion, make for reliable checks to Abomasnow due to their super effective STAB moves. Opposing weather starters, such as Ninetales and Tyranitar, also make for solid checks to Abomasnow despite having to watch out for Earthquake and Wood Hammer, respectively. Jirachi, Scizor, and Terrakion function as the best checks to Abomasnow and hail teams, being able to heavily damage the opposition while resisting key attacking types, such as the STAB of opposing Ice-types.

Ice Shard also hits Dragon-type Pokemon hard, especially Dragonite, Salamence, and Garchomp due to their 4x weakness to Ice-type attacks. Hidden Power Fire allows Abomasnow to melt Steel-type foes, mainly Ferrothorn and Scizor, which could otherwise wall Abomasnow's STAB combination. The last moveslot is mostly preference-based, as Protect allows Abomasnow to scout its opponent, potentially locking a Pokemon carrying a Choice item into a move while racking up some extra hail damage, which can be the difference between an OHKO and a 2HKO. However, Earthquake can be used to heavily damage Fire-type Pokemon, like Heatran and Ninetales on the switch, two Pokemon that typically cause hail teams problems.</p> <p>With the given EV spread, Abomasnow's Attack is maximized; significant investment is run in Special Attack to OHKO Scizor with Hidden Power Fire. The EVs also allow Abomasnow to outspeed minimum Speed Politoed and Skarmory. In terms of moves, if you do opt for Earthquake over Protect, an alternate EV spread of 240 Atk / 120 SpA / 148 Spe is recommended, as it allows Abomasnow to outspeed specially defensive Heatran and decimate it with Earthquake. Blizzard can be run over Hidden Power Fire if your team is capable of dealing with Steel-types, as it gives Abomasnow a move that allows it to break through physical walls, such as Skarmory and Gliscor, and hit incoming Grass-, Dragon-, and Ground-types.</p> <p>Because of its typing, Fire- and Fighting-types are a huge bane to Abomasnow, making partners like Heatran, Jellicent, Gengar, and Reuniclus excellent choices. Jellicent and Heatran also have the advantage of checking faster variants of Scizor, which would typically outspeed and KO Abomasnow with Bug Bite or U-turn. Heatran also has access to Stealth Rock, making it harder for switch-ins to check Abomasnow. Jellicent can burn opposing Scizor, Terrakion, Jirachi, and other common physically-oriented checks to Abomasnow with Will-O-Wisp, giving Abomasnow more opportunities to switch in. These four Pokemon also work well on hail teams as a whole, checking opposing Heatran, Jirachi, Terrakion, and Scizor, some of the largest threats to the playstyle. Abomasnow's crippling weakness to Stealth Rock makes Starmie and Tentacruel solid partners to it. Access to Rapid Spin and having great type synergy with Abomasnow—both resist the two types that threaten Abomasnow—make them excellent partners. Pokemon that can take advantage of the hail brought about by Abomasnow's Snow Warning, such as Kyurem and Kyurem-B, also make excellent partners, as the ability to fire off 100% accurate Blizzards makes them extremely threatening.</p> "

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Abomasnow makes for a very adept physical attacker thanks to its powerful STAB Wood Hammer, priority Ice Shard, and surprise factor, as it's typically expected to be using Blizzard and other special attacks. Ice Shard is arguably the most useful move on this set, as it hits many opponents in OU hard, 2HKOing and even OHKOing a large number of threats. Here are some calculations to exemplify its usefulness:</p> <ul> <li>Ice Shard vs. 0/0 Dragonite (Multiscale in-tact): 37.15% - 44.58%</li> <li>Ice Shard vs. 0/0 Dragonite (Multiscale broken): 74.3% - 89.16%</li> <li>Ice Shard vs. 200/0 Landorus-T (With Intimidate): 35.77% - 43.36%</li> <li>Ice Shard vs. 200/244 Landorus-T (Without Intimidate): 53.11 - 62.87%</li> <li>Ice Shard vs. 0/0 Garchomp: 67.22% - 80.67%</li> <li>Ice Shard vs. 4/0 Latios: 45.69% - 54.3%</li> <li>Ice Shard vs. 0/0 Salamence: 83.38% - 99.09%</li> <li>Ice Shard vs. 252/184+ Gliscor: 41.8% - 50.84%</li> </ul> <p>Abomasnow's alternate STAB move, Wood Hammer, is equally as punishing, as its sheer power makes it difficult to switch into. It hits Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types, such as Jellicent, Gastrodon, and Tyranitar, hard, giving teammates more opportunities to sweep. Earthquake can be used over Wood Hammer, as it allows Abomasnow to hit Heatran and Ninetales switch-ins, as well as Electric-types, such as Magnezone, Jolteon and Raikou. Leech Seed provides Abomasnow with a somewhat reliable form of recovery, recovering 12.5% HP on top of what Leftovers recovers. It can also function as a sort of phazing move, as it discourages many opposing Pokemon from staying in for too long. Protect further bolsters Leech Seed's recovery effect, allowing Abomasnow to recover 37.5% of its HP after two turns (with Leftovers of course) while forcing the opponent to take more residual damage via hail and Leech Seed. Protect also allows Abomasnow to scout the opposition, locking opponents that carry a Choice item into a move.</p> <p>The listed EV spread maximizes Abomasnow's Attack and bulk while giving it enough Speed to outrun minimum Speed Politoed. However, if you prefer an Abomasnow with more bulk, a spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD can be utilized in order to switch in against Water- and Electric-type attacks. A Life Orb can be used over Leftovers if more power is desired, as it can make the difference between a 2HKO and an OHKO, most notably the KO on Dragonite with Multiscale broken. Unfortunately, the lack of Leftovers recovery and additional recoil damage are unfavorable for Abomasnow.</p> <p>Because this variant lacks Hidden Power Fire, teammates such as Magnezone and Heatran are recommended, as they are capable of removing Steel-types, specifically Scizor, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn. Carrying Magnezone or Heatran also makes dealing with faster Scizor variants easier, as Choice Scarf and 252 Speed Scizor variants outpace and KO Abomasnow with U-turn or Bug Bite. Tentacruel and Heatran are able to deal with Fire-type threats and synergize well with Abomasnow. Tentacruel has access to Rapid Spin and Toxic Spikes, adding to the residual damage and removing Stealth Rock, giving Abomasnow an easier switch in. Pokemon that function well on hail teams, such as Reuniclus, Jellicent, and Kyurem, also make for solid partners, as they all benefit from Leech Seed's recovery and residual damage, while countering common Abomasnow checks, specifically Scizor and Terrakion.</p> "

  "Weavile": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Weavile is not the most versatile Pokemon in OU, it functions very precisely with the combination of Ice Shard and a speedy Pursuit, making it one of the best revenge killers for Latios and Latias on offensive teams, as well as a good general Dragon slayer and supporter for Pokemon such as Keldeo and Lucario (through the elimination or weakening of their checks with Pursuit). Another thing that Weavile has going for it is that it can trap and KO Starmie, helping Spikes-stacking offensive teams keep their hazards intact. However, Weavile is frail, meaning that most strong neutral STAB attacks will OHKO it. Furthermore, it's defeated by common priority moves such as Scizor's Bullet Punch and Breloom's Mach Punch, weak to Stealth Rock, which, when combined with the mandatory Life Orb that Weavile holds, seriously limits its longevity. Finally, Weavile is easy to wall for both offensive and defensive teams with common Pokemon such as Keldeo, Jirachi, and Skarmory.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fake Out and Counter can be used with Focus Sash on a lead set to break any Focus Sash from other leads and OHKO anything physically based that Weavile cannot otherwise threaten with Counter, but dedicated leads are very situational in this generation and the same holds true for Weavile. Taunt can be used to prevent defensive Steel-types from taking advantage of Weavile if your team has a big problem with entry hazards, but this is its only use. Swords Dance is an option to capitalize on the switches that Weavile forces and attempt some late-game cleaning, but it's a very risky strategy that will probably result in Weavile being KOed with a wrong prediction, not to mention that Weavile is not such a good cleaner anyway with prevalent Pokemon such as Keldeo and Scizor cutting its sweep short. Punishment is useful against Calm Mind users such as Jirachi and Latias, but is inferior to Night Slash in all other cases.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Skarmory, Forretress, Wish Jirachi, Keldeo, Chansey, and Vaporeon are hard counters to Weavile, easily walling it and either using it as setup bait or just OHKOing it. Scizor can easily switch into anything bar Low Kick (which 2HKOes offensive variants with two rounds of Stealth Rock damage) and OHKO Weavile with Bullet Punch or set up on it. Metagross is on a similar boat, but has the advantage of not being 2HKOed by Low Kick after two rounds of Stealth Rock damage (with Leftovers factored in). Most bulky Water-types, such as Politoed, Tentacruel, and Rotom-W, are good checks to Weavile, as they avoid the 2HKO from Night Slash and threaten back with rain-boosted attacks or status. Hippowdon walls any set that lacks Ice Punch, which in turn 2HKOes even physically defensive variants with the help of Stealth Rock. Offensive Pokemon such as Gyarados, Infernape, and Conkeldurr are perfect checks to Weavile, as they don't care about most of its moves and can either set up on it or OHKO it with Mach Punch in Infernape and Conkeldurr's case. Finally, everything faster than Weavile can usually OHKO it due to its frailty and common weaknesses, and the same holds true for most priority moves other than Ice Shard.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Pursuit is the move that separates Weavile the most from Mamoswine, which also has Ice Shard and hits much harder. Pursuit enables Weavile to weaken or eliminate many problematic Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Starmie, Celebi, and Gengar, and for this reason makes Weavile a very good team player. Ice Shard gives insurance against faster threats, such as Choice Scarf Salamence, +2 Thundurus-T, and +2 Landorus-T, and allows Weavile to OHKO a slightly weakened Breloom (it deals 75.57 - 89.31% to 4 HP Breloom) before it can KO back with Mach Punch. Night Slash is Weavile's strongest and most reliable move and deals with any Psychic- and Ghost-type that decided to stay in. It is also Weavile's strongest option against Pokemon such as Jirachi, Rotom-W, and Tentacruel. On the other hand, Ice Punch allows Weavile to OHKO Gliscor, offensive pivot Landorus-T (even after Intimidate), and Amoonguss (the last two need Stealth Rock for the guaranteed OHKO), and 2HKO Hippowdon and Donphan after Stealth Rock. Low Kick provides almost perfect neutral coverage with Night Slash and deals with some of the Steel-types that plague Weavile, namely Scizor, Ferrothorn, Magnezone, and Heatran, all of which are either OHKOed or 2HKOed with the help of Stealth Rock. It also OHKOes some offensive Pokemon that Weavile outspeeds, such as Terrakion, Hydreigon, Kyurem-B, and Mamoswine.</p> <p>An alternative EV spread of 252 Atk / 28 SpD / 228 with a Jolly nature can be used to always survive a Hydro Pump from Life Orb Starmie, but this scenario is very rare and the Speed tie with opposing Weavile is usually more important. Choice Band can be used over Life Orb if the extra power it provides is needed and allows Weavile to sometimes avoid the guessing game involving Pursuit and Night Slash when facing a Psychic- or Ghost-type. However, it makes Weavile easier to play around and to set up on after it KOes something, so make sure to have the defensive backbone to deal with such threats.</p> <p>Weavile fits better on offensive teams that appreciate the combination of its Pursuit-trapping and Ice Shard revenge killing abilities. Those kinds of teams include Spikes-stacking hyper offensive teams that rely on Gengar to spinblock, where Weavile eliminates Starmie if it manages to get past Gengar, and rain offense teams with Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Keldeo and Agility Thundurus-T, which appreciate Celebi, Jellicent, Latios, and Latias gone or weakened. This means that suicide hazard leads such as Skarmory or Forretress are good partners when combined with Gengar. Keldeo is one of the best offensive partners to Weavile, as not only is Weavile taking care of Keldeo's checks and counters (Celebi, Starmie, Jellicent, Latios, and Latias), but Keldeo also takes on some of the best counters to Weavile, such as Scizor, Skarmory, and Forretress. Thundurus-T, Lucario, Starmie, and any sweeper that benefits from the absence of Psychic- and Ghost-types is also a good offensive partner for Weavile. Lastly, Rapid Spin support always helps a Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon, and Weavile is no exception. Tentacruel is the best option for rain teams and has nice defensive synergy with Weavile, covering threats such as Scizor, Keldeo, Skarmory, and Forretress.</p> "

  "Gliscor": {
    "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced around the time BW was the main generation. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the current BW OU metagame in general. A revamp is currently being worked on <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/gliscor-wip.3687478/\">here</a>.</p> <hr /> <p>Since its release in the fourth generation, Gliscor has been one of OU's premier physical walls. Its stellar defensive typing gives it a useful resistance to Fighting-type moves and an immunity to Ground-type moves, making it a solid check to Pokemon like Terrakion, Breloom, Landorus-T, and Lucario. Though BW2 brought with it a whole host of new threats for Gliscor, such as Keldeo and Technician Breloom, as well as solid competition in the form of Landorus-T, it still manages to find a solid niche as one of the best physical walls in OU. While Landorus-T has the edge in checking physical threats due to its Intimidate ability, Gliscor has the clear edge in sustainability. Between its Dream World ability, Poison Heal, and access to Roost via the BW2 tutors, Gliscor is like a bad meal- you just can't keep it down. It can also make use of Baton Pass to give its teammates Substitutes or Swords Dance and Agility boosts, or it can go offensive with an Acrobatics set.</p> <p>However, Gliscor does have plenty of problems as well. Its lackluster HP and Special Defense stats mean that even weak special attacks will be doing major damage to it. Its 4x weakness to Ice-type moves is also a hindrance, as some physical Pokemon, such as Lucario, Mamoswine, and Conkeldurr, can use Ice-type coverage to break through Gliscor without much difficulty. Gliscor also faces major competition from Landorus-T, which, between its Intimidate ability and massive 145 base Attack, finds itself significantly more suited to the metagame. Despite these flaws, Gliscor still has some key niches, such as its SubToxic set and a more sustainable pure defensive set, which help it carve out a place in the OU metagame.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Gliscor has a few other useful options. A set using Fling and Acrobatics sounds tempting at first, as Gliscor can poison the opponent and then have a 110 Base Power Flying-type STAB for the remainder of the match, but this is usually inferior to the SubToxic set, as it can only Toxic one Pokemon, after which the move is useless. Acrobatics should only be used on the AcroBat set, as it has the most damage output there. Facade is another powerful attacking option on some of Gliscor's defensive sets, but STAB Earthquake is usually better, and Gliscor is strapped for move slots anyway. Knock Off is a decent support option, as it can cripple many of the Pokemon that like to switch into Gliscor such as Rotom-W, Jellicent, Gengar, Politoed, and Skarmory. But, like Facade, Gliscor has a hard time finding a slot that can be given up for Knock Off, and usually there are better uses for the move slot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gliscor is very susceptible to Taunt users, because it relies heavily on passive damage to take down foes. Skarmory is probably the best Gliscor counter, as it is immune to Toxic and Earthquake, resists Acrobatics, takes pitiful damage from Ice Fang, and can Whirlwind out Gliscor that are behind a Substitute. Taunt Gyarados can prevent Gliscor from setting up a Substitute and can proceed to Dragon Dance or Waterfall the switch-in. Sableye can Taunt Gliscor to prevent it from doing anything and Recover stall its Earthquake PP. It can even Will-O-Wisp Gliscor's AcroBat set, and its defensive sets before Toxic Orb has activated. Forretress and Ferrothorn, though unable to do much actual damage, can freely set up entry hazards on any Gliscor that lacks Taunt. Cloyster can OHKO any Gliscor set with Icicle Spear, though it must watch out for Toxic and Taunt. Mamoswine is in a similar boat, as it can do major damage with Icicle Spear as well, though it is not always a guaranteed OHKO because it might only hit twice.</p> <p>When not behind a Substitute, Gliscor is much easier to deal with. Because Gliscor has such abysmal Special Defense, any powerful special attacker can do major damage to it. Gengar is one of the better counters to the defensive and SubToxic sets, as Gliscor can only hit Gengar with Ice Fang and Gengar can hit it hard with Shadow Ball or even the occasional Hidden Power Ice. Rotom-W with Hidden Power Ice is immune to Earthquake, resists Acrobatics, and can OHKO all Gliscor sets, though it does have to watch out for Toxic, because it can easily be worn down once poisoned. Air Balloon Heatran is \"immune\" to Earthquake and Toxic and can OHKO and 2HKO with Hidden Power Ice and Fire Blast, respectively. Thundurus-T can set up on Gliscor that lack Substitute and OHKO with Hidden Power Ice, fearing only Toxic and Ice Fang. Latios and Latias are decent checks, as they are immune to Earthquake, giving them a free switch-in opportunity, and can OHKO with Surf.</p> ",

        "name": "SubToxic",
        "description": "<p>With its massive bulk and above-average speed, this set sits at the pinnacle of OU stall. Between Substitute and Toxic, Gliscor is extremely good at killing time while Toxic slowly wears down the opposing Pokemon's HP. Protect also lets it stall out your opponent's PP, meaning Pokemon that rely on low PP moves to hit Gliscor like Rotom-W's Hydro Pump will not be able to take it down. Furthermore, Poison Heal's 12.5% HP recovery means that Gliscor loses no net HP while stalling, and the Toxic also renders it immune to harmful status, especially burn. This Gliscor set finds it easy to switch in on Choice-locked attacks such as Terrakion's Close Combat and Garchomp's Earthquake, which give it a free opportunity to set up a Substitute. Once Gliscor gets behind a Substitute, it becomes much harder to KO. Only multi-hit moves like Icicle Spear and Bullet Seed can actually pose a threat, since they can actually brute force their way through the Substitute and hit Gliscor itself.</p> <p>Earthquake gives Gliscor a STAB move to hit Pokemon that are immune to Toxic such as Heatran, Lucario, and Jirachi. While Protect is in many ways the key to this set, Roost and Taunt also fill key roles in Gliscor's gameplan. Roost lets Gliscor recover large amounts of health if it has been weakened though the course of the battle. This is especially useful in tandem with Poison Heal, as Gliscor can recover 2/3 of its health in one turn. Using Taunt means Gliscor won't be setup bait for entry hazard setters such as Skarmory, Forretress, and Ferrothorn, and it can prevent slower Taunt users such as Jellicent from stopping its stall cold.</p> <p>Gliscor's EVs allow it to outspeed max Speed Landorus-T, as well as specially defensive Zapdos and Adamant Lucario. With this Speed, Gliscor can OHKO Lucario with Earthquake after Stealth Rock and can alternate between Substitute and Protect until Zapdos and Landorus-T run out of Hidden Power Ice and Stone Edge PP, respectively. The EVs also make Gliscor's HP reach a multiple of eight, which means it will gain the maximum amount of health possible from Poison Heal. The rest is put into Defense to maximize its physical bulk.</p> <p>Since it relies so heavily on Toxic to deal damage, this set has serious issues with defensive Steel-types. While Forretress, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn pose no offensive threat to it, Gliscor can't do much to them either. However, their real threat lies in their ability to set up entry hazards, or in the case of Skarmory, phaze Gliscor out with Whirlwind. Because of this, Gliscor appreciates a strong Fire-type to eliminate these threats before trying to stall. Magnezone is also a great partner, because it can trap and KO all of the Steel-types mentioned above. Rotom-W with Hidden Power Ice can also be a problem for Gliscor one on one, as it can only be hurt through Toxic damage, and those that carry Rest will be impossible to take down. Because of this, Celebi makes a great partner as well. It can tank many of the special attackers that threaten Gliscor, such as Starmie, Keldeo, Choice Scarf Politoed, Latios, and Thundurus-T. Heatran, Celebi, and Gliscor make an excellent defensive core, covering all of each other's weaknesses. Good teammates also include Tyranitar and Abomasnow, as Gliscor appreciates the added damage that sand and hail bring. Gliscor fits well into teams based around both of these weathers, with each having advantages over the other. In hail, Gliscor still gains 6.25% of its health back when poisoned, while most of its opponents will lose additional health. Sand allows Gliscor to recover the full 12.5%, but there are many more Pokemon immune to sand damage than hail damage. Sand damage, in addition to Toxic damage, will quickly rack up and can make Toxic stalling much easier for Gliscor. Tentacruel makes an excellent partner for Gliscor, as they have great synergy and Tentacruel can provide Toxic Spikes support, which means Gliscor won't have to waste a turn poisoning the opponent.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With this set, Gliscor takes advantage of its fantastic defensive typing and above average bulk to put a stop to many of the physical attackers in of OU. For example, it is one of the few Pokemon in OU that can reliably switch into Choice Band Terrakion, having only a 6% chance of being 2HKOed by Stone Edge after Stealth Rock. At first glance, this set might seem to be outclassed by Landorus-T, but Gliscor still has one major advantage that sets it apart: reliable recovery. Not only does Gliscor get Poison Heal to recover 12.5% of its HP at the end of each turn, but it also has Roost, which lets it recover a monstrous 62.5%. This alone sets it apart from Landorus-T, which suffers from a lack of reliable recovery. In addition, Gliscor is immune to status, which means that it can safely wall Jirachi, and doesn't fear switching into Will-O-Wisp or Spore after Toxic Orb has been activated. Gliscor's access to Taunt also sets it apart, meaning slower defensive threats can't set up on it. Earthquake is the main STAB move, and it lets Gliscor hit the likes of Terrakion for super effective damage. Because Gliscor has decent Speed for a wall, Taunt is a good option for the second slot. It allows Gliscor to shut down most other common walls that rely on support moves and prevents things like Skarmory, Forretress, and Ferrothorn from setting up entry hazards against Gliscor and Swords Dance Scizor from boosting. Toxic is another option, which lets Gliscor wear down bulky Water-types such as Politoed, Rotom-W, and Jellicent, which love to switch in on Gliscor and can 1-2HKO with Hydro Pump or Scald. Ice Fang lets Gliscor do damage back to Pokemon like Choice Scarf Salamence and Garchomp after it tanks their Outrage. It also gives Gliscor a way of hitting Breloom, which otherwise can set up a Swords Dance and KO with Bullet Seed. However, U-turn is another option to make Gliscor a defensive pivot for your team and grab momentum from the physical attackers that will switch out when Gliscor comes in.</p> <p>Protect is a decent option over Roost, as it lets Gliscor scout Choiced special attackers that can switch in on it such as Keldeo and Latios. It also helps to wear down opponents if they have been poisoned, though the SubToxic set is usually better at doing this. This set makes a great addition to any hail team, which commonly have problems with Terrakion and other Fighting-types. In addition, Gliscor has a pseudo-immunity to hail, as it still recovers 6.25% of its health at the end of every turn.</p> <p>The given EV spread lets Gliscor outrun Adamant max Speed Scizor to prevent it from setting up with Taunt. The HP investment makes its health a multiple of eight so it regains the maximum amount of HP from Poison Heal possible. The rest is put into its Defense. If your team desperately needs a Pokemon to set Stealth Rock, Gliscor can opt for that over Taunt, but it really appreciates the ability to shut down slower defensive Pokemon.</p> <p>Heatran and Celebi make great partners for Gliscor, as they all cover each other's weaknesses perfectly and Gliscor's physically defensive spread complements their specially defensive ones well. Rotom-W can also make a good teammate, as it can form a VoltTurn core with Gliscor and tank all the rain-boosted Water-type attacks and 4x effective Ice-type attacks aimed at it. Tyranitar also makes a great partner for Gliscor, as Gliscor resists Tyranitar's 4x weakness to Fighting and Tyranitar can provide sand support to further wear down the opponents that Gliscor is walling. Tyranitar can also eliminate Latios and Latias, which can otherwise be troublesome for Gliscor.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This set is Gliscor's best attempt at an offensive set. While this, similarly to Gliscor's defensive sets, might seem outclassed by double booster Landorus-T, Gliscor still has a few advantages over it. One of this set's main selling points is Gliscor's access to STAB Acrobatics. When used with a Flying Gem and backed by STAB, Acrobatics becomes a 247 Base Power attack. At +2, a Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics is going to hurt even Pokemon that resist it. While Landorus-T has trouble taking on Celebi, Latios, Breloom, and Hydreigon, Gliscor can OHKO all of them with a Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics. Even Rotom-W, one of the best counters to Gliscor, takes a minimum of 75% from it. The other major reason to use this set over Landorus-T is that its ability, Hyper Cutter, means that it can't be stopped by Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Gyarados. The former is OHKOed by +2 Flying Gem Acrobatics, and the latter is OHKOed even without Flying Gem. Earthquake is this set's other main STAB and lets Gliscor hit things that resist Acrobatics such as Jirachi and Heatran. Substitute lets Gliscor get a free shot in on something faster than it such as Keldeo or Latios. Agility is another option over Substitute, as Gliscor can sweep many teams at +2/+2.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Gliscor's Attack and Speed, giving it the best shot at sweeping. A Jolly nature is tempting to use on this set, as it lets Gliscor outspeed the standard Ninetales set and Neutral base 100 Pokemon such as Volcarona, but Gliscor really needs the power that Adamant provides, and Substitute protects Gliscor from Ninetales, Volcarona, Salamence, and Jirachi. Furthermore, Gliscor can do serious damage to them with Acrobatics or Earthquake from there. Fire Fang can be used over Earthquake, as it lets Gliscor beat things like Skarmory, which otherwise can set up on or Whirlwind out Gliscor, ending its sweep. But Fire Fang's coverage is generally not as useful as Earthquake's, the drop in power is definitely noticeable, and STAB Earthquake actually hits harder than a super effective Fire Fang. Poison Heal can be used instead of Hyper Cutter, as Gliscor can switch in on a predicted Toxic and recover most of the HP lost from Substitute, but Hyper Cutter is much more useful and Poison Heal is far too situational.</p> <p>Starmie is a great partner for AcroBat Gliscor, as it can Rapid Spin the entry hazards that Pokemon such as Skarmory and Forretress might set up and can threaten Jellicent and Politoed with a Life Orb Thunderbolt. Technician Breloom with Focus Punch also deserves a mention, as it can beat Skarmory, Latios, and Latias with a Fighting Gem-boosted Focus Punch and Rotom-W and Jellicent with Bullet Seed. Mixed attackers such as mixed Salamence and mixed Jirachi can lure in common counters to Gliscor such as Hippowdon and Rotom-W and remove them, allowing it to sweep. Thundurus-T is also a great partner, as it takes down bulky Water-type Pokemon and generally breaks holes in the opponent's team, which Gliscor can then take advantage of to clean up.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While Gliscor is mainly used as a defensive Pokemon, this set can surprise the opponent by helping you grab momentum, a Substitute, and possibly a few boosts for teammates. The main objective of this Gliscor set is to set up a Substitute and then Baton Pass it to a teammate that can then use it to set up. Thanks to Gliscor's fantastic natural bulk, complemented by Poison Heal, and immunities to Electric, Ground, and status moves, it can find many opportunities to do so. Passing a Substitute can also be useful for getting frailer sweepers in without having to take a hit. Lucario, Breloom, Thundurus-T, and other defensively weak setup sweepers find a free switch-in very useful and can set up on common switch-ins to Gliscor such as Ferrothorn, Forretress, Rotom-W, Politoed, and Skarmory. Earthquake is the STAB option of choice, as Gliscor still has the bulk to set up on Choice Scarf Terrakion. The last option is the most important, and it really depends on what your team needs most. Taunt is the primary option, as it prevents Politoed from using Perish Song, Skarmory from using Whirlwind, and Jellicent from using Taunt itself. This will make it much easier for Gliscor to set up a Substitute and pass it along. However, Swords Dance and Agility are also decent options depending on your team's needs. Swords Dance, when used in tandem with Substitute, can be useful for passing to strong physical attackers such as Breloom, Terrakion, and Lucario in addition to getting them in safely with Substitute. Agility is a more universal boost, as it can be passed to special and physical sweepers alike, including Nasty Plot Thundurus-T, Choice Specs and Expert Belt Keldeo, Swords Dance Lucario, Terrakion, and Kyurem-B.</p> <p>The given EVs let Gliscor outspeed max Speed Landorus-T, specially defensive Zapdos, and Adamant Lucario, increasing the number of Pokemon that Gliscor can set up a Substitute on. The HP EVs make Gliscor's health a multiple of eight to maximize the HP recovered from Poison Heal, and the rest is put into Defense. Celebi makes a great partner with Gliscor, as it can absorb the Water attacks that Gliscor hates, and Gliscor can pass Substitutes and Agility boosts to Celebi, which can then boost itself with Nasty Plot. Lucario, Terrakion, Breloom, and Salamence all appreciate being able to come in for free thanks to Substitute and appreciate an intact Substitute even more.</p> "

  "Mamoswine": {
    "overview": "<p>Mamoswine's STAB combination hits almost the entire OU metagame for neutral or super effective damage, making it an excellent wallbreaker that can fit on a variety of teams and is difficult to deal with defensively. Ice Shard enables Mamoswine to also check many of the metagame's top threats, such as Landorus-T, Latios, and Garchomp. Thick Fat is also decently useful, especially if Mamoswine is used on a rain team to further reduce its Fire weakness. Mamoswine has subpar defensive stats and is weak to a lot of common attacks, which can make it hard to bring and keep in play. Its Speed is only decent, which makes it rather easy to revenge kill with faster Pokemon that aren't weak to Ice Shard unless it is behind a Substitute.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Life Orb is an alternative item for Mamoswine, although the recoil wearing it down makes it easier to play around. A Focus Sash set with Stealth Rock and Endeavor can be used on hyper offense teams that want Stealth Rock up immediately. However, this set has limited use and is outclassed by other Focus Sash leads. Stealth Rock can also be used on other sets if no teammate has a slot for it. Icicle Spear is an alternative Ice-type STAB attack that has perfect accuracy and punishes Substitute users like Breloom, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Thundurus-T but has unreliable power. Knock Off is a usable support option, although Mamoswine would often prefer to use stronger attacking moves. Chople Berry can be used to let a healthy Mamoswine survive Terrakion's Close Combat and Alakazam's or Thundurus-T's Focus Blast, but this doesn't have good interactions with Substitute, and a set with four attacks generally prefers an attack-boosting item. A set with Salac Berry alongside Substitute can be used to give Mamoswine a chance to sweep, but it generally prefers an item with more consistent benefits. Metronome is a decent option alongside Substitute, but it can be hard to get a significant boost with. A Choice Scarf set with Icicle Spear can be used to better check fast threats like Focus Sash Alakazam and faster Substitute users. However, this set is a lot weaker than wallbreaking ones.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Rotom-W is one of the best counters to Mamoswine thanks to its Ground immunity and Ice resistance. However, it needs to consecutively hit Hydro Pump to beat Substitute Mamoswine reliably. Other bulky Water-types such as Politoed, Milotic, and Slowbro can also switch in and threaten Mamoswine out; however, Choice Band-boosted Earthquake can be hard to switch into, especially if entry hazards are up. Offensive Water-types like Keldeo and Starmie can outspeed Mamoswine and threaten it with super effective STAB moves, although they usually can't switch into Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Pokemon such as Alakazam, Terrakion, and Volcarona naturally outspeed Mamoswine and threaten to KO it as long as they're not in KO range of Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Physically defensive Skarmory can switch into Mamoswine. Although not as common, Bronzong is a good switch-in thanks to Levitate. Scizor and Forretress can take anything except Choice Band Earthquake and threaten Mamoswine back with Bullet Punch or Gyro Ball, respectively. If holding Air Balloon, Magnezone and Heatran can beat Mamoswine that lack Superpower. Additionally, Choice Scarf Magnezone can switch into a predicted Ice-type attack and threaten to OHKO with Flash Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types: Calm Mind Reuniclus isn't 2HKOed by any Mamoswine move except Earthquake from a Choice Band set, and it threatens to KO Mamoswine with Focus Blast; however, it must be cautious with Icicle Crash flinches. Mew outspeeds all Mamoswine sets, can burn it with Will-O-Wisp, and breaks Mamoswine's Substute with Psychic or a Fighting-type move, but it must watch out for Choice Band Earthquake. Cresselia can outstall Mamoswine if there is no sand or rain up using the combination of Moonlight, Reflect, and Toxic, and it can break Mamoswine's Substitute with Psychic, but Cresselia must be wary of flinches from Choice Band-boosted Icicle Crash.</p> ",

        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute eases prediction and protects Mamoswine from Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, and Stun Spore. Notably, Substitute means Rotom-W needs to land Hydro Pump consecutively in order to beat Mamoswine. Ice Shard picks off faster Pokemon such as Latios and Garchomp. It can also be used to check weakened setup sweepers like Agility Thundurus-T and Dragon Dance Dragonite as long as Mamoswine isn't in KO range of the latter's Extreme Speed. Never-Melt Ice allows Mamoswine to OHKO offensive Garchomp with Ice Shard and 3HKO Gastrodon, Ferrothorn, and specially defensive Skarmory with Icicle Crash. Leftovers is an alternative that provides Mamoswine with passive recovery and gives it more opportunities to use Substitute.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An Adamant nature is preferred for increased damage output, Jolly can be used to outspeed Adamant Excadrill and maximum Speed Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mamoswine should be used as a wallbreaker, possibly paving the way for a teammate to clean up late-game. It's often best to bring Mamoswine in using a pivot or after a teammate has fainted so that it can stay healthy. However, some situations let it directly switch in, such as against passive Pokemon like Gliscor and Skarmory or against Tyranitar and Landorus-T when you predict they will use Stealth Rock. Mamoswine can then use Substitute as it forces a switch, preventing the opponent from switching around Mamoswine's attacks. Substitute is especially risk-free against Pokemon that can't break it, like BoltBeam Reuniclus. Substitute can also be used to block status moves like Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W and Jellicent as well as Toxic from Chansey, and it can be used to stall out moves like Hydro Pump from Rotom-W and Gyro Ball from Ferrothorn if they're already low on PP, especially if Mamoswine is running Leftovers. If Mamoswine isn't behind a Substitute, choosing whether to use Icicle Crash or Earthquake can be tough. If the opponent has Ground-immune Pokemon, it's often safer to use Icicle Crash. Earthquake is best used once Ground-resistant and immune Pokemon are removed or weakened. Ice Shard should be used to check and revenge kill faster Pokemon like Latios, Thundurus-T, and Garchomp. If the opponent has a setup sweeper like Dragon Dance Dragonite or Agility Thundurus-T, it can be important to keep Mamoswine intact to check them. Many offensive teams lack faster Ice-resistant Pokemon, making Ice Shard a great tool against them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mamoswine fits best on bulky offense teams due to its offensive presence. VoltTurn support from Pokemon like Rotom-W and Landorus-T is great for bringing it in safely. The former is also a good check to Water-types that Mamoswine can struggle with. Ferrothorn and Amoonguss can also check Water-types for Mamoswine. Additionally, the former can set up entry hazards to wear down Mamoswine's checks, while the latter can slow foes down with Stun Spore to support Mamoswine's merely decent Speed. Mamoswine is a decent option on rain teams, with Politoed's rain and Thick Fat both decreasing the damage it takes from Fire-type attacks. Politoed and Tentacruel can use Toxic to poison Rotom-W and other bulky Water-types for Mamoswine. Tentacruel and Starmie can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards that wear Mamoswine down. Tornadus is also a good teammate on rain teams that can wear down Rotom-W and other Pokemon for Mamoswine, use U-turn to bring it in safely, and use Tailwind to help it outspeed the opposing team. Knock Off users like Ferrothorn, Gliscor, and Seismitoad help Mamoswine by crippling the likes of Rotom-W and opposing Ferrothorn.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Choice Band Mamoswine rivals Kyurem-B in sheer destructive power. Superpower is Mamoswine's best option for hitting Rotom-W, and it hits Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Kyurem, and Kyurem-B for super effective damage. Additionally, it can hit Steel-types like Air Balloon Heatran and Air Balloon or Magnet Rise Magnezone. Ice Shard can be used to pick off faster Pokemon that have been weakened. It's also great for checking Speed-boosting setup sweepers, especially if they're weak to it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An Adamant nature is usually preferred for increasing damage output; however, Jolly can be used to outspeed Adamant Excadrill and maximum Speed Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to bring Mamoswine in using pivots or double switches so it can safely start wallbreaking. Correctly predicting your opponent's switches is ideal, but Icicle Crash is usually a safe move to use, as nothing is immune to it and Choice Band allows it to hit any neutral Pokemon hard. Earthquake is usually ideal to use once Ground-immune and resistant Pokemon have been weakened or removed. If the opponent has a faster Pokemon like Latios or Alakazam, or a Speed-boosting Pokemon like Dragonite or Thundurus-T, it can be important to keep Mamoswine from fainting to check them with Ice Shard. This is especially true against offensive teams, which usually lack a faster Ice-resistant Pokemon. Try to avoid status moves like Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, which severely hinder Mamoswine.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Mamoswine set fits best on more offensive teams. VoltTurn support from Pokemon like Rotom-W and Landorus-T is useful to bring Mamoswine in safely. Ferrothorn can set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes for Mamoswine while switching into Water-types and using Knock Off to remove Leftovers from Rotom-W. Landorus-T can set up Stealth Rock and check offensive Fighting-types that threaten Mamoswine out. Amoonguss is another decent check to offensive Water- and Fighting-types, and it can use Stun Spore so Mamoswine can outspeed the opposing team. Mamoswine normally forces in bulky Water-types and can wear them down with its raw power; Pokemon that appreciate this, such as Keldeo and Heatran, can work well with it. Late-game cleaners that can take advantage of Mamoswine weakening the opposing team are decent options; Swords Dance Scizor, Agility Thundurus-T, and Choice Scarf users like Keldeo and Latios are good picks. Rapid Spin support from Tentacruel or Excadrill can be useful, as this Mamoswine set likes to switch in multiple times.</p> "

  "Rotom-Wash": {
    "overview": "<p>Having an awesome defensive type combination alongside a fantastic ability, Rotom-W is one of the best defensive pivots in the BW OU metagame and the foundation of the classic VoltTurn strategy. With solid base 107 in both defenses, an okay base Speed, and a great support movepool with Volt Switch, Will-O-Wisp, and Thunder Wave, Rotom-W is the primary choice for most sand structures to check powerful Ground-types like Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Mamoswine. It does this while maintaining the utility of taking strong Water-type hits from foes like Keldeo and Starmie. Rotom-W also benefits from sand building pressure on special walls, helping it keep up the team's offensive momentum. It does have a low base HP and a very shallow offensive movepool, but Rotom-W still is one of the most solid options for any sand team and a great choice even outside of sand.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Ice can be used over Hydro Pump on the defensive set to give Rotom-W BoltBeam coverage, have a more accurate move that can't be PP stalled via Substitute, and still have a form of healing in Pain Split, but this makes Rotom-W weak to Heatran and Mamoswine, two Pokemon that it is normally used to counter. Hidden Power Flying can be used over Pain Split to instantly defeat Poison Heal Breloom and deal decent damage to Amoonguss and Celebi, but it doesn't have any targets outside of this. In a same vein, Hidden Power Fire can be used to heavily damage Ferrothorn, but this needs very good prediction and you lose a valuable moveslot for it. Signal Beam can be used on a non-Choice item set to demolish Celebi and deal heavy damage to Latios and Reuniclus while not risking a miss from Hydro Pump, but it doesn't have targets outside of this. Rest alongside a Chesto Berry is the only other form of healing Rotom-W has, but the loss of Leftovers makes it struggle in sand. Thunder Wave paralysis is another status Rotom-W can spread to help its teammates, but Will-O-Wisp is almost always the better option. A physically defensive Rotom-W set can also be used to better handle Landorus-T's U-turn, Garchomp's Outrage, and Keldeo's Secret Sword, but the Special Defense loss greatly hurts its utility function. A Choice Specs set in rain can be utilized to have an insanely strong Hydro Pump and perfectly accurate Thunder, but other Pokemon can do this better.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Breloom with Poison Heal active can use Rotom-W as a setup fodder for Bulk Up, Swords Dance, or Substitute, since the only move it fears is the rare Hidden Power Flying. Amoonguss can enter in front of Rotom-W anytime and scare it off with Giga Drain, but Amoonguss alone is unable to stop a VoltTurn chain. Celebi doesn't care about anything Rotom-W can do because of Natural Cure, and it can steal the momentum with Leaf Storm, Nasty Plot, or Baton Pass. Ferrothorn can use Rotom-W to stack Spikes, since there is nothing Rotom-W can do to it except a Will-O-Wisp burn, and Rotom-W fears Power Whip in retaliation or having its item removed with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Kyurem-B outspeeds defensive Rotom-W and threatens an immediate KO with Outrage. Latios and Hydreigon can come in on any Rotom-W set and immediately fire off Draco Meteor to heavily damage it, but Latios must watch out for a Volt Switch into a Tyranitar that Pursuit traps it. Latias can use any Rotom-W set to set up Substitute and Calm Mind or help its teammates with Tailwind or Healing Wish. Dragonite can use Rotom-W to set up Dragon Dance, either by hiding behind a Substitute or having a Lum Berry.</p> <p><strong>Gastrodon and Seismitoad: Gastrodon is immune to both of Rotom-W's STAB moves and can heal off burn damage with Recover while poisoning or burning it with Toxic or Scald. Seismitoad can do the same thing; it's also immune to both STAB moves, shrugs off a Will-O-Wisp burn with Refresh, and threatens Rotom-W with Knock Off, Toxic, or a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Electric-immune Pokemon like Gliscor, Mamoswine, Garchomp, Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Thundurus-T can use Substitute to outstall Hydro Pump's PP, especially if they are carrying Leftovers or running Protect, or fish for a miss with Hydro Pump's shaky accuracy. Pokemon with high Special Defense, like Heatran and Terrakion in sand, can set up Substitute that isn't broken by Volt Switch and then outstall Hydro Pump's PP or fish for a miss. Dragon-types like Dragonite, Kyurem-B, and Kyurem can set up Substitute versus any standard Rotom-W variant and immediately threaten it or its teammates.</p> ",

        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch is the most important move, since it lets Rotom-W keep the offensive momentum while checking Water-types and Ground-types, as the latter will not stay in due to fearing a stray Hydro Pump or burn. Will-O-Wisp lets Rotom-W spread burn to severely cripple Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Garchomp, and Tyranitar. It also helps defeat specially defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss, Latios, and opposing Rotom-W, as the extra damage puts those Pokemon in KO range faster, especially alongside sand damage. Pain Split is the best healing option Rotom-W has and works well with its low base HP, but it's a bit unreliable in the later stages of the match. Because of this, using Hidden Power Ice over Pain Split is an option to help Rotom-W's troubles with Dragon-types, Poison Heal Breloom, and specially defensive Gliscor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>20 Defense EVs let Rotom-W always survive two Secret Swords from Choice Scarf Keldeo without Stealth Rock. An alternative spread of 248 HP / 100 Def / 160 SpD is also possible to take less damage from U-turn spam while still not being 2HKOed by Alakazam's Psychic after Stealth Rock and sand damage, but this weakens Rotom-W's function as a check to rain threats. Rotom-W can run reduced Speed IVs to bring in teammates more safely with a slower Volt Switch, but at least 14 IVs are recommended to outspeed standard specially defensive Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Rotom-W early-game to spread burn as soon as possible. Its STAB moves alongside Will-O-Wisp scare away a good portion of the metagame's threats; use this knowledge with Volt Switch to keep the offensive momentum, either by bringing an entry hazard stacker like Ferrothorn or a hard-hitting Pokemon like Landorus-T. Landorus-T can further keep the pressure with U-turn, forming a VoltTurn core. Do not fear bringing Rotom-W in front of a strong special attacker like Keldeo or Alakazam, since you can recover its HP with Pain Split; this is most effective early-game because most of the opposing Pokemon will be at full health. Beware of opposing Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, and Scald burns, since poisoning or burning Rotom-W, alongside sand damage, is the easiest way of putting it into KO range.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar is the primary partner, since it sets sand and can Pursuit trap Pokemon that give Rotom-W trouble like Latios and Amoonguss. Landorus-T and Gliscor are amazing options, as both can help Rotom-W with Stealth Rock and Knock Off support, checking Mold Breaker Excadrill and Poison Heal Breloom, and forming a VoltTurn core with U-turn. Ferrothorn provides Spikes and Knock Off support alongside a Dragon-type check if used with Gyro Ball or another rain check if used with Power Whip. Powerful offensive Pokemon like Latios, Alakazam, Reuniclus, Excadrill, Garchomp, and Terrakion love the slow Volt Switch Rotom-W provides to enter the field safely. Other U-turn users, like Jirachi, Scizor, and Mienshao, or Baton Pass users, like Celebi, are also valid team choices.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to deal good damage while avoiding opposing attacks and sand damage, which is useful because Rotom-W's low HP makes it a bit frail. Hydro Pump is mandatory, since it's Rotom-W's best attacking move and defeats foes that are immune to Volt Switch like Excadrill and Mamoswine. Hidden Power Ice checks Pokemon that normally love to use Rotom-W as setup fodder, like Dragonite and Garchomp, while dealing good damage to Pokemon that resist both of Rotom-W's STAB moves, like Latios, Breloom, Hydreigon, and Amoonguss. Trick is Rotom-W's best option to stop setup sweepers like Reuniclus or cripple Pokemon it can't naturally defeat, like Ferrothorn, Celebi, and Gastrodon. Thunderbolt deserves a mention to possibly replace Trick or Hidden Power Ice, since having a Electric-type STAB move besides Volt Switch is useful in some matchups.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With a Timid nature, 224 Speed EVs let Rotom-W outspeed standard bulky Choice Scarf Landorus-T and creep Adamant Kyurem-B after it gives up its Choice Scarf with Trick.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to avoid getting Rotom-W damaged by Stealth Rock or sand, since this would reveal its lack of Leftovers and you want to bluff a more defensive set to have maximum effectiveness with a Choice Scarf. This is particularly important early-game, as this is where you can grab a surprise KO against a Pokemon like Garchomp and Landorus-T or cripple a Pokemon like Ferrothorn or Gastrodon with Trick. However, if Rotom-W is your team's only failsafe for fast threats, then be careful when using Trick, since this can leave you very weak to setup Pokemon like Dragonite and Reuniclus or fast, hard-hitting Pokemon like Keldeo and Latios.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Rotom-W set hates the chip damage sand provides, so it's best used in a weatherless or rain structure. Politoed is a powerful partner, since it tanks strong Water-type attacks and can summon rain to boost Rotom-W's deadly Hydro Pump. Partners that can capitalize on the offensive momentum Rotom-W generates like Breloom, Landorus-T, Latios, Kyurem-B, and Scizor are very good options. Keep in mind that you must have ways to deal with strong special attackers like Latios, Alakazam, and Thundurus-T, so Pokemon like Jirachi and Celebi are also good partners.</p> "

  "Cresselia": {
    "overview": "<p>Ever since her debut in DPP, Cresselia has always had difficulty competing in OU. The transition to BW2 is no different; new threats, such as Drizzle Politoed, put a hamper on Cresselia's effectiveness, while old threats, namely Scizor and Tyranitar, are still prominent in today's metagame. Despite Cresselia's stupendous defenses, her lackluster typing and barren movepool keep her from functioning as the defensive juggernaut she was meant to be. However, BW2 wasn't entirely unkind; along with Drizzle Politoed, Drought Ninetales also took center stage. Under the sunlight, Moonlight, an otherwise mediocre recovery move, restores Cresselia's health by a staggering 67%. This, along with her excellent ability, Levitate, allows Cresselia to wall some of the most powerful Pokemon in OU, such as Garchomp and Terrakion, both of which are troublesome Pokemon for sun teams. With infinite sun rays guiding her, Cresselia becomes an incredible asset to her team and a phenomenal mixed wall.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There are a few other methods Cresselia can use to heal herself. RestTalk is one; however, it is rather unreliable and forces Cresselia to acquire two move slots to be used effectively. A Chesto Berry can be used with Rest and Recycle; it's slightly more reliable, but it gives Cresselia a severe case of four moveslot syndrome. Psycho Shift and Flame Orb can be used on the defensive set, giving Cresselia the opportunity to spread burns and cripple her counters. Psycho Shift can also be used with RestTalk to spread sleep. Solar Beam can work on a set using both RestTalk and Psycho Shift; it will never be picked by Sleep Talk and can be used fairly well on the sun teams Cresselia is found on. Speaking of status afflictions, Cresselia can use Safeguard to fend them off. Sunny Day is an excellent way to grab momentum from opposing weather inducers. Finally, Cresselia can use an offensive or defensive Calm Mind set, but it is outclassed by other Psychic-types, such as Jirachi and Reuniclus.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best way to beat Cresselia is to change the weather to sand, hail, or rain. Under these weather conditions, Cresselia loses most of her defensive merits, as Moonlight can no longer restore Cresselia's health by 67% and instead recovers a measly 25%. The two best counters to Cresselia are Choice Band Tyranitar and Heatran. Tyranitar can remove Cresselia's favored weather condition, take very little damage from any of her attacks, and threaten to 2HKO, while also dealing big amounts of damage if it uses Pursuit as Cresselia switches out. Heatran is the next best if not the best counter, as Heatran takes nothing from any of Cresselia's attacks and can either 2HKO Cresselia with a sun-boosted Fire Blast or stall it out with Toxic. Politoed is a good check, just like Tyranitar, as it removes Cresselia's favored weather condition, and can threaten it with a powerful rain boosted Hydro Pump, though it has to watch out for an incoming Toxic, as it will be easily worn down.</p> <p>Outside of altering the weather condition, Calm Mind Latias with either Substitute or Refresh is very threatening to Cresselia and her team, as it can use Cresselia as setup bait and proceed to demolish her party. Either variant of Kyurem is capable of turning Cresselia into a liability by setting up on it. Defensive Starmie doesn't care about anything Cresselia can do, and can eventually burn it with Scald, limiting her longevity. Provided that sun is up, Fire-types such as Volcarona and Victini are good checks, as they can switch-in relatively easy and greatly threaten Cresselia. Reuniclus is a decent check, thanks to Magic Guard and its well rounded bulk, Reuniclus can potentially outstall Cresselia while taking very little from any of her attacks. Celebi can set up with either Calm Mind or Nasty Plot and proceed to beat Cresselia or pass the boosts along to a proper recipient. As long as Cresselia lacks Hidden Power Fire, Steel-types such as Scizor, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn make excellent counters as well. Scizor can also destroy Cresselia with its Bug-type STAB attacks. Jirachi and Ferrothorn can use Cresselia as setup bait. Thanks to its ability, Prankster, Sableye can effectively shut down Cresselia and heal off any acquired damage, though Toxic will cripple it. Speaking of Toxic, it is another way to beat Cresselia, as she has very few methods of removing the status affliction. Finally, bulky Taunt or Substitute users such as Gyarados make good counters to Cresselia as well.</p> ",

Moonlight is Cresselia's only reliable recovery move; together with Toxic and sunlight, Cresselia can stall out most physical and special attackers in the tier. Cresselia can use Ice Beam to slay Dragon-types, rather than stall with Toxic and Moonlight, ensuring more longevity. Psychic is the most reliable STAB attack, used to take out the Fighting-types that plague the tier. Hidden Power Fire dents Scizor and various other Steel-types; without it, they could set up on Cresselia. Scizor can even Pursuit trap Cresselia if it's lacking Hidden Power Fire, thus dealing considerable damage. Reflect does a few things: allow Cresselia to wall physical attackers more easily, soften the impact of Tyranitar's and Scizor's Pursuit, and provide a temporary defensive wall for Cresselia's teammates. When using Psychic, Cresselia can counter almost every Fighting-type in OU.</p> <p>The EVs are maximized in Defense so that Cresselia can wall powerful physical attackers, such as Terrakion, Garchomp, and Lucario. However, Cresselia can run 40 Special Attack EVs to OHKO Choice Band Scizor after Stealth Rock with Hidden Power Fire in the sun. 0 Speed IVs with a Relaxed nature and Trick Room in the fourth move slot can be used to support Trick Room Victini and Quiet Eruption Heatran. If Cresselia is utilizing Hidden Power Fire, then the IVs should be changed to 2 Atk / 30 SpA / 30 Spe, minimizing Confusion and Foul Play damage while retaining a strong Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>Thunder Wave is an acceptable option over Toxic. With Thunder Wave, Cresselia can cripple fast sweepers, such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and Alakazam, making it easier for her teammates to sweep. Due to the fact the Cresselia often lures in status moves and Taunt, Magic Coat can be used to bounce back entry hazards and those same incoming status afflictions. Moonlight is often dependent on optimal weather conditions to work; as such, Cresselia can utilize the well-known ChestoRest strategy as a single, reliable healing method to restore her health and remove status afflictions.</p> <p>Sun support is recommended if you intend on using Cresselia. Without sun support, Cresselia will be hindered by the presence of other weathers, as Moonlight's recovery becomes a measly 25%. Moreover, under the sunlight, Moonlight becomes a 67% healing move, optimizing Cresselia's defensive potential. Sun teams also appreciate Cresselia's presence, as she can wall troublesome Pokemon, namely Mamoswine and Terrakion, as well as taking on Latios and Dragonite. In return, common sun sweepers, such as Victini and Darmanitan, can lure out and weaken opposing weather starters and check the Steel-types that hinder Cresselia. Chansey also works well with Cresselia by providing Wish support and relieving Cresselia of status afflictions with Heal Bell. Chansey also has the added benefit of being one of the few sun Pokemon that can beat Calm Mind Latias, which also troubles Cresselia. Rapid Spin support from Tentacruel and Forretress, or Magic Bounce support from Xatu and Espeon, can help keep Ninetales healthy, which in return benefits Cresselia by sustaining the sunlight. This allows Cresselia to use moonlight to its fullest potential. Entry hazard support from Forretress is helpful in breaking down the opposing team. Finally, other excellent partners include Pokemon that deal with Tyranitar, such as Terrakion.</p> "

        "name": "Dual Screens",
        "description": "<p>Cresselia's incredible bulk along with her signature move, Lunar Dance, set her apart from other dual screen users, making her a great supporter for a variety of offensive teams. Reflect and Light Screen go hand in hand, improving the overall defensive prowess of her teammates. Lunar Dance is a game-changing move; sacrificing Cresselia, Lunar Dance restores an injured sweeper back to full health. When backed by the support of Cresselia's dual screens, a once frail and injured sweeper has enough health and bulk to set up. Due to Cresselia's phenomenal bulk, Lunar Dance is best used mid-game, as Cresselia will normally have more than one opportunity to set up dual screens. In the final slot, Thunder Wave can be used to cripple faster sweepers, giving a teammate more opportunities to set up. Ice Beam is also useful for its ability to weaken Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Salamence.</p> <p>With Reflect activated, the given EVs allow Cresselia to survive two Crunches from Choice Band Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and outspeed Adamant Breloom, thus giving Cresselia more chances to set up dual screens. The Attack IVs are zero so that Cresselia will take minimal confusion and Foul Play damage. Cresselia can opt for a 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD defensive spread with a Relaxed nature, 0 Speed IVs, and Trick Room in the fourth slot to act as a reliable dual screens user for Trick Room teams.</p> <p>Cresselia can utilize quite few other options in the fourth move slot. Psychic can be used as a reliable STAB to dent Fighting-types. Toxic can be used to cripple walls, thus allowing her teammates to run through the opposing team more easily. Magic Coat is also an option so that Cresselia isn't Taunt bait. This Cresselia partners well with frail setup sweepers; Volcarona and Salamence can all both dual screens effectively to accumulate boosts and ravage through the opposing team. Thundurus-T and Lucario are also excellent partners for Cresselia, as they can also take advantage of the extra bulk provided by dual screens to set up Agility and Swords Dance, respectively.</p> "

  "Victini": {
    "overview": "<p>Victini isn't just cute; its V-create is among the most powerful attacks in the game, with only Darmanitan's Flare Blitz as competition. This makes it an excellent choice on sun teams. Its ability, Victory Star, improves the accuracy of its moves by 10%, allowing it to use its great movepool more reliably. Additionally, with Pokemon such as Technician Breloom, Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Regenerator Amoonguss making a strong showing in the OU metagame, Victini has plenty opportunities to come in and start firing off V-creates.</p> <p>However, like all Pokemon, Victini suffers from flaws. First and foremost, rain being the most popular weather slightly hurts Victini's potential. Heatran and Tyranitar both consistently sitting in the top 10 of OU usage isn't doing it any favors, as both can easily come in on Choice-locked V-creates and make Victini's life difficult. It also suffers from a vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards, limiting the number of times it can switch in. Victini also faces competition from Darmanitan, although Victini does have many advantages over it, such as better defenses, Bolt Strike, and an arguably better STAB move. Regardless, if you underestimate Victini, it will show you exactly why it is called the Victory Pokemon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Victini can run a special set as it has a wide special movepool containing a plethora of moves such as Blue Flare, Psychic, Focus Blast, and Thunder. However, special sets are generally outclassed by Volcarona, Heatran, and Chandelure. Zen Headbutt hits a few Pokemon, such as Toxicroak, Keldeo, Amoonguss, Tentacruel, and Terrakion, without lowering Victini's stats, but it is not good coverage-wise. Although a mixed set could work, physical variants of Victini will hit harder because of the sheer wallbreaking power of a maximally invested V-create. A support set can work, as Victini has access to Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, but this set is discouraged due to Victini's relatively poor defensive typing. However, Will-O-Wisp can make it easier to get past Slowbro. Substitute can be used to help against revenge killers such as Terrakion and Garchomp. Sunny Day makes Victini much more self-sustaining; for example, Sunny Day and Focus Blast can be used to beat Tyranitar. However, these options may cause Victini to lose out on important coverage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to its versatility and power, there are no foolproof Victini counters. Dragonite and defensive Salamence are the closest you can get to Victini counters, although both are still hit very hard by a Choice Band V-create. Bulky Water-types, especially Politoed, can work as switch-ins to V-create, but all of them except Politoed must be wary of switching in on V-create under sun. Additionally, bulky Water-types must be careful about switching in on Bolt Strike. Out of all of the bulky Water-types, Slowbro and Politoed can switch in the most easily thanks to Regenerator and Drizzle, respectively. Hippowdon can tank hits from Choice Scarf variants, but must look out for Choice Band and Final Gambit variants. Flash Fire users, such as Heatran and Chandelure, can switch in on V-create thanks to their immunity, but Heatran needs to watch out for Brick Break and Chandelure will take a heavy hit from Bolt Strike due to its frailness.</p> <p>It is much easier to check Victini than it is to counter it. Terrakion, Salamence, Garchomp, and Tyranitar can all check Victini with ease as they can all hit it for super effective damage. V-create's side effect of lowering Speed often eliminates the need for a Choice Scarf to revenge kill Victini.</p> ",

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<p>An encounter with this set will show just how hard it is to switch in to V-create; V-create blasts through standard physical walls, such as Skarmory and Forretress, and even OHKOes defensive Gliscor in sun. Not even Hippowdon can switch in safely, as it is 2HKOed by V-create. However, the stat drops of Defense, Special Defense, and Speed that occur after using V-create are very easy to take advantage of, as many Pokemon will outspeed and OHKO it. Bolt Strike is used to hit bulky Water-types, OHKOing even the bulkiest of Politoed and Jellicent after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKOing Rotom-W without a Speed drop. While the unreliable 85% accuracy might make you wary of using it, remember that Victory Star boosts it to a much more reliable 93%. Brick Break is Victini's best option to hit Heatran and Tyranitar. For the last move, U-turn maintains momentum and eases prediction when using Victini.</p> <p>To demonstrate the power of V-create, here are some damage calculations against Pokemon who resist it and/or are very bulky (all calculations assume Choice Band and an Adamant Nature):</p> <ul> <li>V-create vs. 252/244+ Hippowdon: 62.14% - 73.09% <li>V-create vs. 252/0 Gastrodon: 64.78% - 76.29%</li> <li>V-create vs. 0/0 Salamence: 73.11% - 86.1%</li> <li>V-create vs. 0/0 Garchomp: 58.82% - 69.46%</li> <li>V-create vs. 248/216+ Jellicent: 46.65% - 55.08%</li> <li>V-create vs. 0/0 Keldeo: 68.11% - 80.18%</li> <li>V-create vs. 0/0 Rotom-W: 78.51% - 92.56%</li> </ul> <p>The move tutors from Black 2 and White 2 gave Victini the move Trick, which gives it the ability to cripple many of the Pokemon commonly found on stall. However, Trick doesn't do much for Victini as it's already hard to wall in the first place. The EV spread maximizes Victini's power and Speed, while the last four EVs are placed into Defense so Victini can switch into Stealth Rock four times instead of three. Choice Band is the preferred item due to the lack of recoil and higher damage output compared to Life Orb, though Life Orb allows Victini to switch moves while keeping similarly high power. However, Life Orb recoil means Victini will be weakened far more quickly. Other item options include Fighting Gem and Charcoal. Fighting Gem can bluff a Choice item, as well as making Brick Break hit Heatran and Tyranitar hard. Charcoal can also be used, as it boosts V-create's damage output by 20%, and allows Victini to bluff a Choice item and avoid recoil.</p> <p>The three best switch-ins to Victini are Dragonite, defensive Salamence, and Heatran. Mamoswine and Starmie are therefore excellent partners, as they can take on all three at once. Ninetales is Victini's best friend, boosting the already powerful V-create to a godlike power level; for example, Victini's Choice Band V-create 2HKOes Kingdra under sun. You could also use Victini with other weather inducers that are not named Politoed, but it works best with Ninetales. Rapid Spin users, such as Forretress and Excadrill, are good partners to eliminate entry hazards, although Espeon and Xatu are also effective at preventing entry hazards due to Magic Bounce. Grass-types, such as Breloom and Virizion, and Dragon-types, such as Dragonite, are excellent partners as well, as they help weaken and eliminate Water-types for Victini.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf, Victini becomes a great revenge killer and scout. Although it may seem overshadowed by other Choice Scarf users at first glance, its access to U-turn and a powerful STAB move in V-create gives it a niche over them. Even without a boosting item, V-create is still extremely powerful, especially with Drought support. Bolt Strike allows Victini to revenge kill Tornadus-T and Gyarados in the rain, while also picking off weakened Politoed. U-turn helps maintain momentum as well as making Victini's life easier by giving it an easy way of escaping from its counters. In the last slot, Trick is generally the best choice as it cripples most walls, which are particularly troublesome without any sort of power boost. However, Brick Break is Victini's only way of hitting Heatran and Tyranitar hard, although its low damage output makes it discouraging. Flare Blitz can be a useful move to revenge kill a Pokemon and potentially sweep late-game without lowering Victini's Speed.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is preferred because it allows Victini to outspeed Choice Scarf Rotom-W while still having respectable power; for example, Adamant Victini's V-create is just as powerful as Jolly Darmanitan's Flare Blitz. Due to the lower damage output compared to other sets, Hippowdon is an excellent counter to this set as it can take V-creates and stall Victini out; therefore, carrying powerful Grass-types such as Breloom is recommended. Heatran is also a problem, as it can switch in with ease, and bulkier variants are not even 2HKOed by Brick Break. Therefore, Fighting-types, such as Terrakion, and Dragon-types, such as Hydreigon and Garchomp, are great partners. With this set, Ninetales support is essentially mandatory as Victini will really need the extra power boost to V-create due to its lack of a power-boosting item. Forretress is a great partner as well, as it can both set up hazards and remove them, both of which are useful assets and increase Victini's effectiveness tremendously.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Victini is often seen punching giant holes in the opposition using its absurdly powerful V-create, but this set takes advantage of Victini's formidable special movepool that fulfills a prominent wallbreaking role as well. The main difference between this set versus Victini's physical wallbreaking counterpart is the fact that physical Victini is used in a more hit-and-run type of fashion due to V-create's stats-reducing drawback. Furthermore, physical variants typically lack the type coverage this set offers. This makes it more prone to being forced out by the opponent, unlike special Victini which is harder to play around with due to its vast type coverage and powerful attacks, two of which have a good chance at causing either burn or paralysis status. It also takes out the Pokemon that commonly switch into physical Victini, such as Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Heatran.</p> <p>Blue Flare is Victini's unique STAB attack of choice, scorching foes with more power than Fire Blast, and with Victory Star, it reaches a reliable accuracy of 93.5%. Focus Blast provides additional coverage against Tyranitar and Heatran, two extremely common Victini switch-ins, whereas Thunder maims the plethora of Water-types, such as Politoed, Tentacruel, and Jellicent. Again, thanks to Victory Star, both Focus Blast and Thunder's shaky accuracy is marginally accommodated for. However, if you feel the need to run Thunderbolt, which is much weaker but boasts perfect accuracy regardless of weather, it's a decent alternative. The final slot is open to Glaciate, an excellent move that Kyurem generously allowed Victini to play with. Not only does it obliterate the omnipresent Dragon-types, it also provides handy Speed-reducing utility that can be game-changing by easing prediction. For instance, Victini can Glaciate an incoming Terrakion expecting to sponge its Blue Flare, but because Victini will now outspeed the naturally faster Terrakion, it can then take Terrakion out with Focus Blast. Furthermore, in cases where Victini just misses out on scoring an OHKO against a faster target, Glaciate can be used to inflict the needed damage and allow Victini to outpace the threat for the KO, meaning Victini only has to take one hit rather than two.</p> <p>Using Life Orb and a Modest nature are recommended to produce the most damage output possible, as Victini ends up hitting ridiculously hard with its high-powered attacks. Although, if you despise losing Speed ties against max Speed Salamence and Jirachi as well as being outpaced by max Speed Hydreigon, a Timid nature is perfectly viable to consider. Expert Belt is also worthy of being used if you prefer longevity over power, especially considering the fact that Victini's moveset provides amazing type coverage. Do note, though, that using Expert Belt prevents Victini from securing certain 2HKOs, such as against specially defensive Hippowdon with Blue Flare, 232 HP Rotom-W with Focus Blast, and offensive Latias with Glaciate. In terms of other attacking options, Grass Knot can be used to hit Gastrodon and specially defensive Hippowdon very hard, which can otherwise cause nuisances with their impressive bulk and instant recovery. It's also possible to use Victini's signature and stronger Fire-type attack in V-create over Blue Flare, allowing it to become a decent mixed attacker to obliterate Blissey, which otherwise walls this Victini. If V-create is used, be sure to use a defense-reducing nature of your choice rather than an Attack-reducing nature.</p> <p>Because Victini is vulnerable to every entry hazard, it's strongly recommended to provide Rapid Spin support to remedy this. Tentacruel and Forretress are both great options to consider, as they are two of the most reliable spinners in OU and offer great support with their own entry hazards. Ferrothorn is another potent entry hazard user that Victini greatly appreciates, as it can secure certain KOs against the likes of Latias, Jellicent, and Hippowdon. It is worth noting that Tentacruel and Ferrothorn form the sturdy Fire / Water / Grass core with Victini, offering great synergy with each other. Due to this set working great as a wallbreaker, Pokemon that can clean up the weakened opposition are encouraged for use. For this reason, Choice Scarf Terrakion, double booster Thundurus-T, Swords Dance Lucario, and Alakazam are excellent candidates to consider as they are some of OU's finest late-game sweepers; they also appreciate Pokemon that this Victini is good at weakening or removing altogether, such as Hippowdon, Jellicent, and Latias. Lastly, Pokemon that can defeat Blissey is encouraged; Choice Band Tyranitar and Scizor are superb answers, as they can potentially get rid of it with Pursuit if you sense it switching out or Superpower should it stay in.</p> "

        "name": "Trick Room",
        "description": "<p>At first glance, Victini's stats indicate that it should be taking advantage of its base 100 Speed either with a Choice Scarf or Choice Band. However, Victini lies south of such threats as Thundurus-T and Terrakion on the Speed tiers, both of which are perfectly capable of wearing a Choice Scarf of their own. Luckily, Victini has a deadly tool up its sleeve that makes these Pokemon (as well as many others) cower in fear: Trick Room. With support from Stealth Rock and Ninetales's Drought, Victini OHKOes a huge amount of offensive and defensive threats alike with V-create alone. As a bonus, Victini's Speed is lowered by one stage every time V-create is used, allowing it to \"outspeed\" even the slowest of Pokemon after multiple V-creates. Putting all of these factors together, it's not hard to see that Victini is the ultimate late-game cleaner. Victini has just enough bulk to bluff a Choice Scarf on a revenge kill late-game, using Trick Room on the free turn while your opponent switches. From there, Victini can start blasting away with V-create on your opponent's Pokemon who have likely taken previous damage throughout the battle.</p> <p>Unfortunately, V-create cannot hit quite everything, especially Heatran, who gets a free boost from it. Bolt Strike and Brick Break supply adequate back up in the rare cases where V-create just isn't powerful enough. Brick Break almost always 2HKOes all variants of Heatran and Bolt Strike does the same to Politoed in the rain. In the sun and against every other Pokemon besides Flash Fire users, even a resisted V-create is almost twice as powerful as a neutral Bolt Strike and has only slightly less power than a super effective Bolt Strike. Note that Victini needs Trick Room in its set, as like Reuniclus, it is a standalone sweeper. It cannot perform its pillaging duties without a full 4 turns of Trick Room, so switching Victini in is not an option.</p> <p>Victini's stat spread is standard fare for a Trick Room sweeper. A Brave nature with 252 Attack EVs is used to maximize Victini's Attack stat while minimizing its Speed in conjunction with 0 Speed IVs. The remaining EVs are invested into Victini's already decent bulk. Flame Plate is used to get the most power out of V-create--the move it will be using most frequently--while avoiding recoil damage from Life Orb. Life Orb seems viable in order to give a boost to Victini's other attacks, but the recoil really adds up and hinders its cleaning abilities. Finally, Muscle Band is an option to give a slight boost to all of Victini's moves, but since V-create will be used more often than not, Flame Plate gives Victini a more consistent boost in power.</p> <p>If the above claims seem like ridiculous hyperbole, take a brief look at the following calculations to see just how well a \"not very effective\" move can out-muscle and clean up the most important threats:</p> <ul> <li>V-create (sun) vs. 4/0 Latios: 96.35 - 113.24% <li>V-create (sun) vs. 4/252 Chansey: 109.03 - 128.5%</li> <li>V-create (sun) vs. 4/252+ Chansey: 100 - 117.75%</li> <li>V-create (sun) vs. 4/0 Rotom-W: 94.62 - 111.57%</li> <li>V-create (sun) vs. 0/0 Dragonite (Multiscale broken): 78.01 - 91.95%</li> <li>V-create (sun) vs. 0/0 Salamence: 87.91 - 103.32%</li> <li>V-create (sun) vs. 248/216+ Jellicent: 55.83 - 66%</li> <li>Brick Break vs. 252/0 Tyranitar: 68.31 - 81.18%</li> <li>Brick Break vs. 4/0 Tyranitar: 80.7 - 95.9%</li> <li>Brick Break vs. 248/0 Heatran: 37.4 - 44.15%</li> <li>Brick Break vs. 0/0 Heatran: 44.58 - 52.63%</li> <li>Bolt Strike vs. 252/252+ Politoed: 58.85 - 69.27%%</li> <li>Bolt Strike vs. 0/0 Politoed: 101.86 - 120.49%</li> <li>Bolt Strike vs. 248/216+ Jellicent: 60.04 - 70.96%</li> </ul> <p>Ninetales is the first support Pokemon that comes to mind when considering any variant of Victini, and Trick Room is no different. It boosts V-create to unbelievable levels and also adds protection against weak Water-type attacks. In addition, a reliable hazard setter should be used to set up Stealth Rock, as it turns many of the above calculations into possible or guaranteed OHKOes. Terrakion is a good option to set up Stealth Rock with its base 108 Speed. Ferrothorn can also be used as a backup physical attacker in case Victini faints at some point during its rampage, but Victini will usually be cleaning late in the game so this is hardly an issue. Trick Room Victini does not have many direct counters; the best option is Hippowdon, who can switch in and take 49.52 - 58.57% from V-create, still underspeeding after the Speed drop and OHKOing Victini with Earthquake. If the sun isn't shining, physically defensive Slowbro can take on Victini, stalling its Trick Room turns and wearing it down with repeated Scalds, recovering any damage taken with Slack Off. Heatran is another option, as its defensive variants are at worst 3HKOed, but offensive variants don't stand much of a chance.</p> "

        "name": "Final Gambit",
        "description": "<p>Victini also has access to Final Gambit, an effective way of guaranteeing a KO early-game. Although it looks similar to the Choice Scarf set, it plays differently, as it attempts to sacrifice itself to eliminate a crucial member of the opponent's team as opposed to revenge killing. Final Gambit is especially useful for eliminating opposing weather inducers, allowing its team to win the weather war. U-turn is useful on this set because it scouts for Ghost-types looking to switch in on Final Gambit. Despite the lowered Attack investment, V-create still does acceptable damage thanks to its high Base Power. For the last moveslot, Trick cripples Ghost-types, Blissey, and Chansey who will likely switch in looking to tank a Final Gambit. Because Victini is weaker, it will not mind losing the Scarf.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is used on this set to ensure that Victini uses Final Gambit before the opponent attacks. Bolt Strike can be used to hit the bulky Water-types who are hit super effectively by it, although it is very weak with no Attack investment. If Victini is not being used to lead, entry hazards will severely cripple its effectiveness, as this weakens Final Gambit. Although you should be using this set as a lead, Rapid Spin users or Magic Bounce Pokemon are appreciated if Victini is not being used as a lead. As Ghost-types can switch in to block Final Gambit, Pursuit users, such as Tyranitar and Scizor, are helpful to eliminate them. If Ninetales is used alongside Victini, Chlorophyll sweepers work well with Victini assuming Final Gambit hits any possible opposing weather inducer, as they will be able to sweep without worrying about an opposing weather inducer coming in.</p> "

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Excadrill is one of the best Pokemon in the tier. Its excellent defensive typing and decent natural bulk make it able to switch into Pokemon like Latios, Tyranitar, Reuniclus, Tornadus lacking Focus Blast, and Jirachi. It is hard to wear down because of its 4x resistance to Stealth Rock and immunity to sand; this means Excadrill recovers more health from Leftovers and can effectively run Protect, making it even harder to wear down. It is incredible offensively because it's so strong and has good STAB attacks, which makes it hard to defensively answer, and Sand Force and Mold Breaker further this by changing how the opponent has to approach handling Excadrill. Because of these things and being able to threaten the most common entry hazard setters in the tier, mainly Tyranitar, Heatran, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn, it's the best spinner in the tier. This ability to support its team so well makes Excadrill work with many of the best Pokemon in the tier, and as such, it fits on a wide variety of teams and is pretty much always useful in a game. However, it doesn't have the greatest natural Speed tier, so it can be offensively checked by Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Keldeo. It also has common weaknesses, which means it needs to be careful around the Pokemon it usually wants to come in on, mainly Latios and Tyranitar, since they run super effective coverage. On top of this, good checks like Air Balloon + Magnet Rise Magnezone, Garchomp, Landorus-T, Keldeo, Rotom-W, Skarmory, and Gliscor are also quite common, which limits its overall viability and ability to come in.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance + Rapid Spin can be used on rain teams, as it grants them a Jirachi and Reuniclus answer that can give entry hazard control.

However, it breaks upon taking any hit and leaves Excadrill without Leftovers recovery or even a boost to Speed like Choice Scarf would grant. Air Balloon is best used on a Swords Dance + 3 Attacks set with Iron Head, Earthquake, and Rock Slide. Choice Band Excadrill can be a fierce wallbreaker, especially with Sand Force. However, Excadrill doesn't have a move that isn't very punishing to lock into and much prefers getting Leftovers recovery so it can come in throughout the game much more easily.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Skarmory: Skarmory is the best Excadrill answer in the tier.

However, Excadrill can use Rapid Spin or attempt to flinch Skarmory down in a pinch it if it's not Rocky Helmet, while Skarmory can't actually hurt it if back should it lack Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor can all take at least one hit from Excadrill and take it out with Earthquake or, in the former two's case, set Stealth Rock. However, Garchomp and Landorus-T are vulnerable to being worn down over time, and Gliscor can get flinched down should it come to that.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-W: Rotom-W hard walls all Sand Force sets lacking Rock Slide, forces Excadrill out with the threat of Hydro Pump, and uses it as an opportunity to use Will-O-Wisp or Pain Split. However, it can't handle Mold Breaker variants and can take a decent chunk from Sand Force-boosted Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Other Water-types</strong>: Politoed, Keldeo, and Gyarados are able to switch into Excadrill at least once and take it out with super effective STAB attack. However, Politoed needs to be healthy to win the weather war and as such can't take too many hits and is outsped if lacking Choice Scarf, Keldeo takes a lot from Earthquake despite being able to take a hit, and Gyarados is weak to Stealth Rock, so it's easily worn down.</p> <p><strong>Magnezone: Air Balloon Magnezone can get in on a predicted Earthquake or after a KO, use Magnet Rise as Excadrill breaks the Air Balloon, then take out Excadrill with Hidden Power Fire. However, it's vulnerable to being flinched by Iron Head from the Sand Force set as it uses Magnet Rise. It's worth noting Choice Scarf Excadrill locked into any non-Earthquake move is trappable by all Magnezone sets.</p> <p><strong>Thundurus-T</strong>: Thundurus-T is a decent soft check that can take at least one Sand Force-boosted Iron Head reasonably well and force Excadrill out with the threat of Focus Blast. It can also set up a Substitute on a forced switch should it have Substitute as well, and Substitute makes Thundurus-T beat defensive sets. However, Substitute + Agility sets can't beat the Sand Force set due to lacking the proper coverage to do good damage to it while taking quite a bit from Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Breloom, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth can take at least one hit and cripple or take out Excadrill with super effective coverage or status. However, they're also liable to be worn down, especially Ferrothorn due to its lack of recovery and tendency to get burned and lose Leftovers to Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Garchomp, Landorus-T, Keldeo, Thundurus-T, and Alakazam can all outspeed Excadrill and take it out with powerful super effective coverage, and all of them can take at least one hit. However, they often have a hard time switching in and can struggle to take on the Choice Scarf set.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Protect in tandem with Leftovers lets Excadrill stay at high health as well as scout potentially Choice-locked Pokemon like Landorus-T, Terrakion, Tyranitar, Latios, and Garchomp. Rapid Spin lets Excadrill greatly support its entry hazard-susceptible teammates as well as itself and uses the move well thanks to being very hard to spinblock. Rock Slide has some potential utility with Sand Force sets due to doing a good amount of damage to Rotom-W, Thundurus-T, and Skarmory while also denting Gyarados quite heavily. However, it's hard to fit and doesn't have much utility outside of these specific targets.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sand Force is the preferred ability on this set, as it lets Excadrill nail a 2HKO on Ferrothorn and Reuniclus with Earthquake while also 2HKOing Choice Scarf Landorus-T that don't have much bulk investment and Poison Heal Breloom with Iron Head. A Jolly nature can also be used for teams especially weak to Timid Heatran while also outspeeding Adamant Dragonite and Mamoswine. However, this leaves Excadrill unable to get the important damage benchmarks mentioned above. Mold Breaker lets Excadrill use Earthquake more freely against teams that rely on Rotom-W or Latios as their primary pivot to Earthquake. A spread of 252 Atk / 124 SpD / 132 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used to outspeed maximum Speed Jolly Tyranitar, Adamant Breloom, and Modest Politoed and take attacks like Draco Meteor from Latios better.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Attempt to get Excadrill in via a double switch or into resisted or weak attacks like Tyranitar's Crunch, Reuniclus's Psychic or Hidden Power Ice, and any of Amoonguss's attacks. Use Protect to scout a Choice-locked Pokemon, gain health from Leftovers, and rack up residual damage with sand and a potential Toxic poison or burn. If you need to spin away entry hazards, do it on a forced switch or a weak or resisted attack like Reuniclus's Hidden Power Ice. Do not take a lot of unnecessary damage; this set doesn't have as much bulk, meaning it may be unable to take an important hit such as Latios's Dragon Pulse late-game if its health dips too low. If up against a rain team, use Excadrill to spin Ferrothorn's entry hazards away throughout the game and force chip damage on Politoed to aid in winning the weather war. Excadrill can also threaten Tentacruel out should it be healthy enough, since Scald doesn't OHKO it. If predicting a counter such as Skarmory, Gliscor, or Rotom-W if Excadrill is running Sand Force to come in, switch into an answer to these Pokemon to maintain momentum and pressure. Pay attention to which Pokemon heals from Leftovers first against opposing Excadrill and Heatran because whether Excadrill can offensively answer them is contingent on it being faster. If Excadrill is slower, switch out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar is this set's best partner, as it lets Excadrill run Sand Force while also setting Stealth Rock and trapping potentially problematic Pokemon such as Alakazam, Jellicent, and Thundurus-T. It can even attempt to lure in and OHKO Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Skarmory with Ice Beam and Fire Blast to make Excadrill even harder to check. Excadrill, meanwhile, can act as a backup Reuniclus measure and handle most Steel-types that may give Tyranitar a hard time based on its coverage. Latios can check Keldeo, Gliscor, and Rotom-W while also busting holes in other walls alongside it. In return, Excadrill is able to handle or heavily damage Tyranitar and most of the Steel-types that trouble Latios. Keldeo makes for an excellent partner because it beats the Ground- and Steel-types Excadrill can't, namely Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Skarmory. The Toxic + Protect set, in particular, is an excellent partner, as it spreads more residual damage, which Excadrill can take advantage of with Protect, and lets it break through Pokemon like Rotom-W and Thundurus-T over time. Meanwhile, Excadrill handles Reuniclus, non-Stun Spore Amoonguss, and Latios to an extent so Keldeo can more easily spread Toxic poison while also spinning; this is particularly helpful due to Keldeo's lack of recovery outside of Leftovers, which is usually getting negated by sand. Rotom-W takes on opposing Sand Force Excadrill, Politoed, Choice Scarf Keldeo, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Mamoswine while burning said Pokemon; except for Gliscor; and even gets Excadrill in safely via Volt Switch. Excadrill can threaten Pokemon such as Reuniclus, Tyranitar, and Latios in return. It can even bait Latios into locking into Surf so Rotom-W can come in and get off a free Pain Split or Will-O-Wisp. Poison Heal Breloom can take care of Choice Scarf Keldeo, Rotom-W, Politoed, and Gliscor lacking a Flying-type move, while Excadrill can handle Reuniclus and Tornadus. Ferrothorn is able to set entry hazards, can use Knock Off to remove Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Politoed so Excadrill's damage sticks more in the long-term, and is a good Water-type and Latios switch-in. Excadrill is able to check Reuniclus and Jirachi in return while spinning away Spikes so Ferrothorn is able to check Latios more easily throughout the game. Reuniclus enjoys Excadrill's ability to handle the Steel-types that trouble it, mainly Jirachi and opposing Excadrill, to facilitate a Calm Mind sweep while also taking advantage of Excadrill handling Tyranitar very well. Reuniclus is able to beat Toxic + Protect Keldeo, Gliscor, and Skarmory for Excadrill while even beating Choice Band Terrakion in tandem with Excadrill, as Excadrill can scout what move Terrakion locks into with Protect and takes Stone Edge, while Reuniclus takes Close Combat.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rapid Spin lets Excadrill support teammates weak to entry hazards and itself and uses the move well because it can force switches well and take a hit or two from common Stealth Rock setters like Tyranitar and Jirachi. Toxic is able to cripple the majority of Pokemon that can switch into Excadrill, such as Politoed, Landorus-T, Tangrowth, Hippowdon, and Jellicent, while also nailing other miscellaneous threats like Keldeo, Garchomp, Thundurus-T, and Latios. Alternatively, Excadrill can viably use Stealth Rock thanks to effectively threatening spinners. Additionally, its overall bulk in tandem with Protect and Leftovers lets it stay healthy and scout potentially Choice-locked Pokemon like opposing Excadrill, Mienshao, Tyranitar, Landorus-T, and Latios.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This EV spread outspeeds uninvested Landorus-T as well as maximum Speed neutral nature Tyranitar. The rest of the EVs guarantee maximum Leftovers recovery and make Excadrill able to come in on Latios, Tyranitar, and Tornadus more comfortably while taking at least one super effective attack from them and most other special attackers.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Excadrill is meant to stay around throughout the game and dissuade Pokemon such as Latios from spamming their STAB moves and makes pivoting around them and Tyranitar easier for its team. When up against Ferrothorn, avoid spinning away its entry hazards before scouting for Knock Off or Leech Seed, as these moves make it so Ferrothorn will win the matchup. It's also a better idea to play out the game and wear Ferrothorn down over time with residual damage from burn or entry hazards so Excadrill can KO it and spin away the entry hazards for good. Use Protect to get back health and scout a Pokemon that has good potential to be Choice-locked like Latios, Tyranitar, or Landorus-T. Pay attention to which Pokemon heals from Leftovers first against Pokemon like Rotom-W and opposing Excadrill because whether Excadrill can offensively answer them is contingent on it being faster. If it's slower, it should switch out. When expecting a switch into a Pokemon that can check Excadrill, like Gliscor or Skarmory, switch Excadrill out as they come in to not lose momentum.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rotom-W takes on opposing Sand Force Excadrill, Politoed, Choice Scarf Keldeo, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Mamoswine while burning said Pokemon, except for Gliscor, and even gets Excadrill in safely via Volt Switch. Excadrill can switch into Reuniclus, Tyranitar, and Latios in return. It can even bait Latios into locking into Surf so Rotom-W can come in and get off a free Pain Split or Will-O-Wisp. Tyranitar can run Stealth Rock, letting Excadrill more freely run Toxic while also trapping potentially problematic Pokemon such as Reuniclus, Jellicent, and Thundurus-T. It can even attempt to lure in and KO Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Skarmory with Ice Beam and Fire Blast so Excadrill is not as easily answered, and sand chips down some of its answers. Excadrill, meanwhile, can act as a backup Reuniclus switch-in and handle most Steel-types that may give Tyranitar a hard time based on its coverage. Reuniclus enjoys Excadrill's ability to handle Pokemon that trouble it, mainly Jirachi, Tyranitar, and opposing Excadrill, to facilitate a Calm Mind sweep. Reuniclus is able to beat Toxic + Protect and Choice Scarf Keldeo, Gliscor, and Skarmory for Excadrill while even beating Choice Band Terrakion in tandem with Excadrill, as Excadrill can scout what move Terrakion locks into and takes Stone Edge, while Reuniclus takes Close Combat. Heatran can work together with Excadrill on Toxic + sand-based teams to suffocate the opponent over time with residual damage. Heatran also handles Breloom, Ferrothorn, and Scizor while setting Stealth Rock, which lets Excadrill run Toxic more freely. Latios can check Keldeo, Gliscor, and Rotom-W while weakening Ferrothorn and the opposing team in general. In return, Excadrill is able to handle most of the Steel-types that trouble Latios and comes in on and handles Tyranitar. Keldeo makes for an excellent partner, as it beats the Ground- and Steel-types that Excadrill can't handle, like Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Skarmory. The Toxic + Protect set in particular is a great partner, as it spreads more residual damage that Excadrill can take advantage of with Protect. Meanwhile, Excadrill handles Alakazam, Reuniclus, and Latios to an extent for Keldeo so it can more easily spread Toxic poison while spreading Toxic poison itself. Ferrothorn is able to set entry hazards, use Knock Off to remove Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Politoed so Excadrill's damage sticks for longer, and be a good Water-type and Latios switch-in. Excadrill is able to check Reuniclus and Substitute Jirachi in return while spinning away Spikes so Ferrothorn is able to check Latios more easily throughout the game. Substitute + Dragon Dance Dragonite is a great partner for Excadrill, as it takes advantage of Excadrill removing Stealth Rock to very easily get up a Substitute on many Pokemon while also liking Excadrill handling Jirachi and Gyro Ball Ferrothorn to an extent and badly poisoning bulky Water-types. Amoonguss can take care of Keldeo, Rotom-W, Politoed, and Gliscor if running Hidden Power Ice, while Excadrill can handle Reuniclus, Substitute Jirachi, and Latios for it.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rapid Spin lets Excadrill assist its teammates, and, because this set is much faster than the others, it's also able to safely generate more switches to spin on. However, Excadrill is easily exploited when locked into Rapid Spin. Rock Slide should mainly be used on Sand Force sets, as it gives Excadrill a good move to hit Rotom-W while also targeting Thundurus-T and Gyarados. Toxic is an option to cripple Landorus-T, Slowbro, Hippowdon, Tangrowth, and other offensive switch-ins. However, it’s incredibly punishable to lock into and doesn’t work on other common counters like Gliscor and Skarmory.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sand Force is the preferred ability on this set because it lets Excadrill 2HKO Ferrothorn and Reuniclus with Earthquake in sand while also 2HKOing Choice Scarf Landorus-T that don't have much bulk investment and Poison Heal Breloom with Iron Head. An Adamant nature should be used with this ability. Mold Breaker lets Excadrill use Earthquake more freely against teams that rely on Rotom-W or Latios as their primary pivot to Earthquake. Adamant is able to get the aforementioned 2HKOs with Sand Force, while Jolly can outspeed Pokemon like +1 Jolly Dragonite, slower variants of Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and opposing Adamant Excadrill.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Don't recklessly lock into Rapid Spin, as it leaves Excadrill very exploitable. It can even let any Magnezone set come in and trap it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar is this set's best partner, as it lets Excadrill run Sand Force while also setting Stealth Rock and trapping potentially problematic Pokemon such as Alakazam, Jellicent, and Thundurus-T. It can even attempt to lure in and KO Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Skarmory with Ice Beam and Fire Blast to make Excadrill even harder to check. Meanwhile, Excadrill can more effectively clean and check faster threats thanks to the power boost with Sand Force. Latios can check Keldeo, Gliscor, and Rotom-W while also busting holes in other walls that could potentially halt a sweep. In return, Excadrill is able to revenge kill most of the non-Protect Steel-types that trouble Latios as well as Tyranitar. Keldeo makes for an excellent partner, as it beats the Ground- and Steel-types that Excadrill can't, like Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Skarmory, and potentially spread residual damage. Excadrill can take advantage of this to open up a late-game sweep for it as it wears down Pokemon like Rotom-W and Thundurus-T over time that could force Excadrill out. Meanwhile, Excadrill can revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Latios and Choice Scarf Politoed for Keldeo. Rotom-W takes on opposing Excadrill, Politoed, Choice Scarf Keldeo, Gliscor, Gyarados, and Mamoswine while even getting Excadrill in safely via Volt Switch. It can also spread burn with Will-O-Wisp so the opposing team gets weakened for a late-game sweep. Excadrill handles faster teams in return. Poison Heal Breloom can take care of Choice Scarf Keldeo, Rotom-W, Politoed, Gliscor, and slower teams more reliant on passive damage, while Excadrill can pressure Reuniclus, Amoonguss, and the faster offensive teams Breloom can struggle with. Ferrothorn is able to set entry hazards and can use Knock Off to remove Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Politoed so Excadrill's damage sticks for longer to set up a sweep. Ferrothorn also acts as a good Water-type check and Latios switch-in. Reuniclus enjoys Excadrill's ability to handle the Steel-types that trouble them, mainly Jirachi and Ferrothorn, while it can also take advantage of it handling Tyranitar very well.

    "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced around the time BW was the main generation. Information contained in the analysis is no longer accurate in regards to this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the current BW OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Equipped with the highest Attack stat out of all Fighting-types in the game and three amazing abilities to further bolster its offensive presence, Conkeldurr is a fearsome attacker in OU and one reason why every team needs a reliable Fighting-type answer. Moreover, Conkeldurr is supplied with a vast movepool, including a priority move in Mach Punch and the elemental punches, making it difficult to wall. Conkeldurr is also backed up by its reasonable durability, unlike most other Fighting-types, and a boosting move in Bulk Up to make it even harder to deal with. It also holds a low enough Speed stat to become a formidable Trick Room sweeper. However, despite being a powerful Fighting-type, Conkeldurr still faces stiff competition from its Fighting-type counterparts, such as Breloom, Lucario, Terrakion, and even the special attacking Keldeo, all of which have an excellent secondary typing to give them an additional STAB attack to use, significantly higher Speed to better fulfill a sweeping role, and Swords Dance in the cases of the former three. Additionally, even with Conkeldurr's high base 105 HP, its measly base 65 Special Defense makes it susceptible to the plethora of high-powered special attacks, such as Draco Meteor, Hydro Pump, and Psychic, that plague the OU metagame. Worst of all, however, is Conkeldurr's lack of Close Combat, forcing it to rely on the much weaker Drain Punch and Mach Punch as its notable STAB attacks.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Band set can become a neat revenge killer with Mach Punch and can hit walls extremely hard with Superpower or Hammer Arm; however, it's not worth it, as it's not difficult for the opponent to switch into a Fighting resist and is thus very reliant on prediction. Using Breloom or Terrakion are better options due to their complementary secondary typing. A Substitute + Focus Punch set with Iron Fist can be used to decent effect, as Conkeldurr is the strongest SubPunch user in the game. The only downside to this is it's difficult to use because Conkeldurr always has to be behind a Substitute to use its only STAB move and when the opponent realizes your strategy, they won't allow Conkeldurr to set up unharmed Substitutes; you're better off running an offensive set for the immediate power and no reliance on Substitute. In terms of other attacking options, there isn't much to consider. Conkeldurr can use Low Kick for heavier foes but will sorely miss the power against lighter targets, such as Jirachi. Force Palm can also be used for the 30% paralysis chance to make up for Conkeldurr's lack of Speed, but it's illegal with Mach Punch, a priority move too good to pass up when coming from base 140 Attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>It's quite difficult to reliably deal with Conkeldurr without potentially taking a lot of damage due to its huge Attack and excellent coverage. Bulky Psychic-types, such as Celebi, Latias, Reuniclus, Slowbro, and Mew, are some of the best go-to switch-ins, as they take minimal damage from Payback and can retaliate with Psychic; however, some must be cautious of Conkeldurr's coverage moves. Physically defensive bulwarks, such as Hippowdon, Skarmory, Jellicent, and Gliscor, are also effective Conkeldurr checks, but they also need to be wary of its coverage moves. Offensive Gliscor can also pound Conkeldurr with Acrobatics, as can Scizor. Using strong special attackers to puncture through Conkeldurr's low Special Defense is another method to check Conkeldurr, especially under the appropriate weather; these include Latios's Draco Meteor, Keldeo's rain-boosted Hydro Pump, Dragonite's Hurricane, and Volcarona's sun-boosted Fire Blast. It's more difficult to handle Conkeldurr physically due to its high Defense and access to Bulk Up, but using strong Choice Band attackers, such as Garchomp and Dragonite for their powerful Outrage, Landorus-T with its Earthquake, and Breloom with Low Sweep work well when Conkeldurr is weakened enough, and they can all tank a boosted Mach Punch.</p> ",

        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This is Conkeldurr's generic all-out attacking set, pounding the OU metagame with powerful coverage attacks backed up by its gargantuan Attack stat. This Conkeldurr specializes in wallbreaking and can function as an excellent partner for Trick Room teams. While its STAB attacks are not boosted by Sheer Force and thus cause Life Orb damage, Drain Punch actually heals said damage, and Mach Punch will be used sparingly.</p> <p>Drain Punch is this set's primary attack, backed by STAB and a Life Orb boost while recovering Conkeldurr's HP. Thunder Punch and Ice Punch are Conkeldurr's coverage moves; the former is particularly useful against bulky Water-types, such as Jellicent, while Ice Punch is handy versus bulky Ground- and Grass-types, most notably Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Celebi, as well as the many Dragon-types. Mach Punch is used to chip off the last portion of the foe's health without having to take a hit. It also comes in handy when facing faster Pokemon with Fighting-type weaknesses, such as Kyurem-B and Tyranitar. Fire Punch is an alternative to defeat Jirachi, Scizor, Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Metagross much more easily and is recommended if Conkeldurr is being used on a Trick Room team.</p> <p>The HP and Special Defense investment allows Conkeldurr to better handle special attackers, specifically allowing it to survive standard Life Orb Latias's Draco Meteor and Psyshock. 20 Speed EVs are used to outpace Hippowdon so that Conkeldurr can 2HKO it before it can use Slack Off. Note that 0 IVs and a Brave nature should be used if there is Trick Room support and that Hammer Arm is a great option if Conkeldurr is used on a Trick Room team to outspeed more enemies. Iron Fist is an interesting alternative ability for this set because it boosts all of Conkeldurr's attacks, but it causes Conkeldurr to suffer from recoil. It should be noted, however, that Iron Fist Hammer Arm packs an absurd amount of power, 2HKOing or OHKOing almost everything. It's also possible to run Guts with Flame Orb if you are fearful of potential burn or poison status, making Conkeldurr a reliable status absorber on offensive teams that don't run cleric support.</p> <p>Reuniclus and Tyranitar pair up great with Conkeldurr; Tyranitar can remove many of Conkeldurr's checks, such as Gengar and Latias, while Reuniclus can set up Trick Room and has good synergy with Conkeldurr. Reuniclus can also absorb detrimental status with its Magic Guard ability. Conkeldurr struggles to defeat Pokemon such as Skarmory, which can retaliate with Brave Bird, and Sableye, which can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, so it is ideal to have Pokemon that can remove these counters. Strong special attackers, such as Latios, Heatran, and Keldeo, are decent choices for this, as they can hit both of these Pokemon hard with their appropriate STAB attacks. Conkeldurr is also vulnerable on its special side, so Pokemon that can tank certain special attacks such as Psychic and Draco Meteor are recommended. Jirachi fits the bill perfectly, as it is able to withstand many special attacks aimed at Conkeldurr and provide it with Wish and paralysis support.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Bulk Up",
        "description": "<p>With Bulk Up, Conkeldurr can boost its already sky-high Attack and great Defense to impressive levels. Its natural bulk also makes it easy to boost up against many Pokemon, such as Scizor, Tyranitar, Gliscor, and Mamoswine, making it a challenging threat to take down without powerful super effective attacks. Conkeldurr often takes repeated hits due to its low Speed, and Drain Punch offers a relatively strong STAB attack and a means to recover the lost HP Conkeldurr takes from boosting up, which is the main reason why Bulk Up Conkeldurr can be a difficult threat to take out. Mach Punch compensates for Conkeldurr's low Speed and provides a means to pick off weakened foes, and with such a high Attack stat, Conkeldurr hits quite hard with it. Ice Punch is used for its excellent type coverage in tandem with Conkeldurr's STAB moves, disposing of common checks such as Gliscor, Celebi, Dragonite, and Landorus-T, among many other Fighting-type resistant Pokemon.</p> <p>Max Attack with an Adamant nature is used to ensure that Conkeldurr hits as hard as possible, capitalizing on its Bulk Up boosts. The Special Defense EVs compensate for Conkeldurr's low special bulk, specifically allowing it to have a high chance at surviving a rain-boosted Hydro Pump from Keldeo and Draco Meteor from Life Orb Latios. The lack of heavy HP investment is to maximize Drain Punch healing. However, it is possible to reduce the offensive playstyle and run an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD with a Careful nature for the higher special bulk, making Conkeldurr even harder to take down both specially and physically after Bulk Up boosts; Choice Specs Latios, one of the strongest special attackers in the game, cannot even OHKO Conkeldurr with Draco Meteor with this spread. In terms of other attacking options, Payback is the only notable move over Ice Punch in order to hit Jellicent and Slowbro, which otherwise wall Conkeldurr, super effectively.</p> <p>Guts is the preferred ability for several reasons. It basically acts as Conkeldurr's safety net against status, such as paralysis from the likes of Jirachi and Celebi, Toxic Spikes, and Will-O-Wisp and Scald users, turning Conkeldurr into an absolute menace should it get statused. Guts Conkeldurr is also a great addition on offensive teams that don't typically run cleric support to act as a status absorber. However, Iron Fist still holds valuable traits as well. The immediate and consistent 20% power boost to Conkeldurr's entire moveset is useful outside Bulk Up, and when Conkeldurr does acquire some boosts, its Mach Punch becomes all the more threatening, capable of OHKOing threats such as Heatran, Terrakion, and Kyurem-B after Stealth Rock damage and one Bulk Up boost.</p> <p>Jellicent is a massive roadblock to Conkeldurr's success, as it walls all of Conkeldurr's moves outside of the unrecommended Payback and can severely hamper Iron Fist Conkeldurr or stall out Guts Conkeldurr with Will-O-Wisp. For this reason, Celebi works very well as a partner because it can take status without worry, thanks to Natural Cure, and can provide Thunder Wave support to allow Conkeldurr to outpace naturally faster threats. It can also take on Psychic-type attacks aimed at Conkeldurr from the likes of Starmie and Latias. Swords Dance Scizor with Acrobatics is also an excellent way to take out Jellicent and even Tentacruel, luring them both in to be promptly annihilated. Physically defensive walls, such as Skarmory and Hippowdon, are also going to be problematic. Powerful attackers that can break through these Pokemon work great, such as Hidden Power Fire Latios, Choice Specs Keldeo, and Taunt Gyarados. A more surefire answer to Psychic-type Pokemon is highly recommended, as Celebi often cannot do much back to Latios, Latias, Alakazam, and Starmie or is weak to their coverage attacks. Specially defensive Jirachi is a phenomenal choice to consider, as it can take these Pokemon very well and is generally a great switch-in to the many powerful special attacks that Conkeldurr would rather not take. It can also provide Wish support in case Conkeldurr is not at sufficient HP to boost up and spread paralysis status in a variety of ways. In terms of more offensive partners, Choice Scarf Tyranitar is an excellent candidate to pair with Conkeldurr, as it can outpace and dispose of Latias, Latios, Gengar, Espeon, and Celebi with its STAB Crunch and Pursuit, all of which can halt Conkeldurr's brutality.</p> "

  "Reuniclus": {
    "overview": "<p>Reuniclus's claim to fame is its ability to destroy fast offensive teams by turning their Speed against them or relatively weak stall teams by using them as setup fodder. Its ability, Magic Guard, aids it in this task, as it means that Reuniclus cannot be worn down by Life Orb recoil or statuses such as Toxic. This, when combined with above average bulk, a high Special Attack stat, instant recovery, and a resistance to ever-common Fighting-type moves, makes Reuniclus a dangerous Pokemon to handle. Despite these quirks, Reuniclus sometimes struggles to stand out. The main source of its competition comes from the Dream World, which gave the much frailer but more powerful and faster Alakazam Magic Guard. In addition, old foes such as Latias, who sports a Dragon typing, are still common in the metagame and give Reuniclus competition for a slot for a Psychic-type. When Reuniclus isn't in Trick Room, it is painfully slow, and its weakness to Pursuit and U-turn makes it susceptible to common Pokemon like Tyranitar and Scizor. Despite these flaws, Reuniclus is still a solid Pokemon that can devastate unprepared teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Reuniclus has a few other options to consider. A Life Orb + 3 attacks set with Recover might seem like a good idea at first, but this is a scenario in which Alakazam is more useful, mainly because it is much faster than Reuniclus and won't be forced to take repeated hits. Due to the ubiquity of rain, Thunder is an option to hit Water-type Pokemon for massive damage. Energy Ball and Grass Knot provide similar utility, but the main issue with these moves is that Reuniclus doesn't have the space in its moveset. Regenerator is a great ability, but Reuniclus can generally take more advantage of Magic Guard, as it doesn't switch out very often. Reuniclus can play defensively and provide support with moves like Thunder Wave or Dual Screens, but its subpar defensive typing makes other Pokemon better at this. Finally, Trick can pull off some interesting strategies, such as Tricking a Flame Orb onto the opponent as a lure, but this requires a lot of prediction to pull off, as a burned Reuniclus is a rather easy way to indicate that the opponent should avoid switching in their Scizor.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Reuniclus can be difficult to counter when it has set up, but there are numerous Pokemon that can defeat it both before and afterwards. Jirachi is probably the best counter, as it takes very little damage from any of Reuniclus's moves and can wear it down with repeated Iron Heads or set up on it. Latias resists almost everything Reuniclus can throw at it, and even if it has Shadow Ball, Latias can avoid the 2HKO and recover off the damage fairly easily. Specially defensive Celebi avoids a 2HKO from Shadow Ball as well, meaning that both can stall out Trick Room turns. Latios is similar to Latias, and even though it won't take Shadow Balls as easily, its powerful STAB Dragon-type moves can power through Reuniclus. Slowking's large Special Defense allows it to take repeated hits, and thanks to Regenerator and Slack Off it is easy for Slowking to heal off damage from Shadow Ball. Due to Hidden Power Fire being pretty uncommon, Scizor can usually deal with Reuniclus fairly easily and OHKO it with a STAB Bug-type move, catch it as it flees with Pursuit, or finish it off with a strong Bullet Punch.</p> <p>Volcarona easily OHKOes Reuniclus with Bug Buzz and isn't weak to any of its moves, though it must watch out for Psyshock, which preys on its mediocre physical bulk. Tyranitar takes a lot of damage from Focus Blast, so it cannot take down the Trick Room set reliably, but against the Calm Mind set, with a Choice Band, it can usually OHKO with Crunch or catch it on the switch with Pursuit. Unless there is a variation in Reuniclus's Calm Mind set, Sableye completely walls that particular Reuniclus, and can Taunt it so it is unable to use Recover. Psychic-types such as Mew can come in thanks to its resistances to Psychic and Focus Blast and Taunt Reuniclus to prevent it from using Calm Mind. Victini also resists Calm Mind Reuniclus's attacks, and it can severely damage Reuniclus with either V-create or U-turn. Without Psyshock, Blissey and Chansey can wall the Trick Room set, but be warned that they are often setup fodder for the Calm Mind set. Anything with Sucker Punch is a pain for the Trick Room set, but unfortunately the only Pokemon commonly seen in OU with the move happens to be Toxicroak, which is easily OHKOed by a STAB move. Finally, despite Reuniclus's decent bulk, powerful physical attackers like Choice Band Garchomp can 2HKO it with powerful STAB moves. Because Reuniclus is very slow, it will get worn down rather easily, as it will have to take a hit from nearly everything before it can retaliate as long as it isn't under Trick Room conditions.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Trick Room",
        "description": "<p>While Trick Room is rarely deemed a viable strategy within the Overused tier, Reuniclus has all the tools it needs in order to use a Trick Room set well. Offensive teams that depend on their Speed to succeed tend to struggle against Reuniclus when it uses this set, and with a pathetic Speed stat of 58 with 0 IVs and a Quiet nature, everything in OU is outsped under Trick Room with the exception of Ferrothorn, who is incapable of dealing very much damage to Reuniclus. In addition, its ability prevents it from being worn down by weather, its own Life Orb, or a status, meaning that you have to survive its blows if you want to defeat it.</p> <p>The ever tricky decision of Psychic or Psyshock applies here for the main STAB option. Generally, Psychic is the preferred option, as ironically many physical walls, such as Gliscor and Hippowdon, will be able to stall Reuniclus out of Trick Room turns since it doesn't have a strong enough special move to hit them with. However, Psyshock is still useful in order to get past Terrakion in sandstorm, as well as Gastrodon, Blissey and Chansey. Focus Blast is needed to hit Dark-types and Steel-types hard and hits Tyranitar, a Pokemon that can usually deal a lot of damage to Reuniclus, especially hard. Shadow Ball is the preferred option in the last slot, as it hits Latios, Latias, and Celebi harder than anything else Reuniclus has. However, outside of the rain, Hidden Power Fire hits Scizor and Jirachi hard, and it still hits Celebi relatively hard (just remember to set the Speed IV to 2). It also gives a reliable way to finish off Ferrothorn and Forretress as it will not miss, like Focus Blast often does.</p> <p>The listed EVs maximize Reuniclus's overall bulk while still giving it maximum Special Attack. A Life Orb is the preferred item in order to boost Reuniclus's damage output, and a big advantage that Reuniclus has over other Life Orb users is that Magic Guard negates the recoil damage from it, meaning that Reuniclus is free to use it without drawbacks. Recover is usable here, as it can recover health if a wall is trying to wear down Reuniclus with repeated attacks, but the lack of residual damage wearing Reuniclus down, as well as a lack of coverage with only two moves, makes this a usually rather poor choice.</p> <p>Psychic-types such as Celebi, Latios, Jirachi, and Latias are capable of taking even a super effective hit from Shadow Ball, or Hidden Power Fire in the case of Jirachi. Due to this, Tyranitar is a good partner for Reuniclus, as with the exception of Jirachi, it can hit them hard and potentially OHKO with Crunch or, if they flee, it can Pursuit them for similar results. In addition to this, Reuniclus is immune to sandstorm damage, meaning that Tyranitar's ability to summon it only helps Reuniclus wear down the opponent. Because Reuniclus is one of the only Pokemon that is viable in OU to set up and take advantage of Trick Room, other slow, powerful Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and, once again, Tyranitar work well as they can deal massive damage when under these conditions while also being difficult to outspeed.</p> <p>If Psychic is used over Psyshock, Blissey and Chansey are capable of stalling out Trick Room turns with their massive Special Defense and their instant healing. Fighting-type Pokemon can easily prey upon the two's weakness to their STAB attacks. Pokemon like Breloom are capable of OHKOing them easily, but two Pokemon that stand out as Fighting-type partners are Lucario and Terrakion due to their ability Justified. Due to this, if Reuniclus were to be in danger of being hit by a Dark-type move that is not Pursuit, these Pokemon can switch in and get an Attack boost, making them more powerful. On a similar note, Fighting-types can also deal with Tyranitar reliably, which is useful as it can take a Focus Blast from Reuniclus with enough investment, if it even hits at all. Scizor is also a common threat to Reuniclus and will most likely try to use U-turn on it to do a lot of damage or Bullet Punch it to finish it off and ignore the Trick Room conditions; Heatran takes very little damage from either move and can OHKO Scizor. Trick Room Reuniclus should be used as a late-game sweeper, ideally after you've worn down your opponent's team.</p> "

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>When Reuniclus was first introduced, this set was considered to be nearly unbreakable, due to its demolition of stall teams and large bulk with enough boosts. However, stall teams have become rather uncommon in BW2, thanks to new threats like Keldeo and Technician Breloom being able to power through them easily. Additionally, even with maximum bulk, certain things like Choice Band Garchomp are still able to 2HKO Reuniclus with their powerful STAB moves, and it doesn't have very many resistances. Despite this, Reuniclus is still one of the best stallbreakers in the OU tier thanks to its access to an instant recovery move, as well as Magic Guard, which means it cannot be worn down by Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, sandstorm damage, and other residual damage. Because stall teams are generally weak, Reuniclus can set up Calm Minds and then begin to power through them. It isn't only stall teams that Reuniclus can set up on; it can also up on things like Conkeldurr that cannot hit it hard.</p> <p>Calm Mind allows Reuniclus to take more hits on its uninvested Special Defense and makes it hit harder. When the opponent begins to put notable damage upon Reuniclus, Recover can heal 50% of its health, which also means there is more time to set up Calm Minds. Psyshock is a decent option over Psychic mainly to defeat Calm Mind Latios and Latias, but it has little utility other than that, as it isn't required to beat special walls such as Blissey. Focus Blast is used to get past Dark- and Steel-types, especially Tyranitar.</p> <p>This set maximizes Reuniclus's physical bulk, and the more investment it has in its physical bulk, the more likely it is to avoid an OHKO from Choice Band Tyranitar's Crunch. Leftovers is preferred in order to naturally recover health as it is setting up. Even though Reuniclus doesn't take any residual damage, the extra healing is still appreciated. However, a Life Orb can be used as Magic Guard means that Reuniclus won't take any damage from it, which essentially gives it a free boost, and even though this particular Reuniclus doesn't invest in its Special Attack, the boost can still be appreciated.</p> <p>Because Reuniclus will get outsped by Tyranitar and Scizor, both of which can deal massive damage to it, Reuniclus needs partners to take their STAB moves. Preferably, get these Pokemon eliminated as fast as possible so that Reuniclus can boost late-game and sweep. Tyranitar can be OHKOed by Fighting-type Pokemon such as Terrakion, and Scizor can be dealt with by using Fire-types like Heatran. Infernape can OHKO both Tyranitar and Scizor as it has access to Fighting- and Fire-type STAB moves, but it is incapable of switching in as easily thanks to its subpar bulk. This set's coverage isn't hitting Psychic-type Pokemon very hard, so support from Tyranitar is appreciated as it can defeat Celebi, Latios, and Latias with its STAB Crunch or Pursuit. Jirachi, a Psychic-type which Tyranitar struggles against, is taken care of by powerful Ground-type moves from Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Garchomp and Landorus-T. Note that Hippowdon and Tyranitar's Sand Stream is an additional way to wear down the opponent.</p> "

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<p>Amoonguss is a great pivot in BW OU thanks to its solid typing and defensive stats alongside its ability to recover HP every time it switches out thanks to Regenerator. Due to this combination, it is a great switch-in to Pokemon such as Keldeo, Breloom, Politoed, Rotom-W, and Thundurus-T. Unfortunately, Amoonguss is held back by its susceptibility to entry hazards and its passivity making it fodder for setup sweepers and entry hazard setters, and it is a big momentum drain as well.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Specially defensive EV spreads can be used to better handle Pokemon such as Keldeo and Thundurus-T, but they compromise Amoonguss's ability to deal with Breloom, Landorus-T, and the like. Worry Seed is an option that allows Amoonguss to pressure Pokemon such as Gliscor and Reuniclus, but its situational nature makes it very hard to justify over Amoonguss's other moves, all of which are important. Toxic would work well in conjunction with the sand that is usually present with Amoonguss, but most of Amoonguss's switch-ins are Steel-types, rendering it useless against them. Venoshock can be used to OHKO most Breloom but is generally useless in most other matchups. Protect allows Amoonguss to scout Choice item users, but it takes up a valuable moveslot and does nothing to mitigate Amoonguss's passivity.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types do not take much damage from Amoonguss and can deal heavy damage to it in Heatran's case or set up entry hazards in Ferrothorn's and Skarmory's cases. Ferrothorn can also remove Amoonguss's Black Sludge with Knock Off, which means it can be worn down quickly with sand up. Jirachi can set up a Substitute or Stealth Rock against Amoonguss and use Wish to recover health or support its teammates. Scizor also does not mind Amoonguss most of the time, but it does fear Hidden Power Fire, as do other Steel-types to a lesser extent.</p> <p><strong>Gliscor: Specially defensive Gliscor can withstand Hidden Power Ice and doesn't mind anything else that Amoonguss can throw at it, notably blocking Stun Spore with its Toxic Orb, although uninvested Gliscor does take significant damage from Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Alakazam and Reuniclus can threaten to KO Amoonguss. Reuniclus is particularly problematic, as it does not mind paralysis too much, can comfortably stomach any attack Amoonguss throws at it, and can even set up if Amoonguss lacks Clear Smog.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Special attackers like Latios and Tornadus, provided they switch in against the correct move, can threaten to OHKO Amoonguss and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types such as Latios, Dragonite, and Garchomp can force Amoonguss out and take little from most of its moves aside from Hidden Power Ice, but they need to be wary of Stun Spore.</p> <p><strong>Volcarona: Volcarona resists Giga Drain and Hidden Power Ice, takes little from Hidden Power Fire and Clear Smog, and can shrug off a Sludge Bomb poison or Stun Spore with Lum Berry. This means that it can set up in Amoonguss's face and threaten to sweep.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Defensive Pivot",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stun Spore allows Amoonguss to cripple Pokemon such as Latios, Excadrill, and Terrakion on the switch and open the door for slower wallbreakers to blow holes in the opposing team. In particular, it can absolutely ruin Pokemon such as Latios that can generally take a hit from Amoonguss otherwise. However, it only has 75% accuracy, which can be game changing on occasion. Giga Drain allows Amoonguss to beat threats such as Keldeo and Politoed, and it conveniently can help Amoonguss recover HP when sand is up, which is expected because Amoonguss often ends up on sand teams. The choice of Hidden Power is relatively team dependent. Hidden Power Ice is generally the preferred option, as it hits Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor very hard and does non-negligible damage to Latios and Thundurus-T, making it more difficult for them to come in and force Amoonguss out. Hidden Power Fire is an option, however, if pressuring Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Excadrill, and the rare Scizor helps the team more, but it doesn't hit much else and is weakened in rain to the point where it is best to switch out anyway. Sludge Bomb is recommended in the last slot as a stronger STAB move that can poison switch-ins, making it a good general purpose move, and it most notably does major damage to Breloom, which Amoonguss is often tasked with handling. Clear Smog is another option that makes Amoonguss better at handling Pokemon such as Swords Dance Breloom, Calm Mind Keldeo, and Calm Mind Reuniclus, but it is less useful than Sludge Bomb in most matchups. In addition, Clear Smog must never be used alongside Hidden Power Fire, as such a set allows free Substitutes for Thundurus-T and Dragon-types such as Dragonite.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Regenerator lets Amoonguss stick around over the course of long games. The EVs are placed in Defense to make Amoonguss a better check to Breloom and an acceptable switch-in to Pokemon such as Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Amoonguss is best used to switch into Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Breloom and force them out while spreading paralysis. Depending on its moveset, it can also come into Pokemon like Gliscor and Landorus-T and pressure them. Amoonguss's presence can also force mindgames against Terrakion, but it does not want to come in on Stone Edge. One must be careful when dealing with Ferrothorn because of Knock Off, which removes the Black Sludge Amoonguss needs to compensate for its vulnerability to all types of entry hazards, which are very widespread in BW, and sand, which is problematic because Amoonguss is most often used on sand teams. Be careful when playing against Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Heatran when not running Hidden Power Fire, as Amoonguss lets them switch in relatively freely, allowing them to set up entry hazards, set up a Substitute, or fire off a threatening attack like Lava Plume or Brave Bird. Jirachi can also use Wish freely.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rapid Spin support from Excadrill and Starmie is very helpful, as Amoonguss is still quite vulnerable to entry hazards despite Regenerator. In return, Amoonguss can spread paralysis, making it easier for Excadrill to break down the opposing team and switch into Pokemon like Keldeo that threaten it. Tyranitar is a good partner, as Amoonguss can handle Pokemon such as Keldeo and Breloom that threaten it, and Tyranitar can in turn handle Latios, Alakazam, and Reuniclus. Magnezone is an excellent teammate, as it can remove the Steel-types that otherwise switch into standard Amoonguss freely. Keldeo threatens Pokemon such as Heatran and appreciates Amoonguss's ability to paralyze its faster checks like Latios and Tornadus. Heatran threatens many of the entry hazard setters in BW OU and has excellent defensive synergy with Amoonguss. Slowbro and Slowking also have good synergy with Amoonguss, notably forming a Regenerator core to keep both Pokemon healthy throughout the game. Slowking, or another bulky Water-type like Rotom-W, Gastrodon, or Jellicent, is also helpful because Amoonguss is not capable of beating Keldeo under rain on its own. Pokemon that generally appreciate the paralysis support Amoonguss provides, such as Dragonite, Garchomp, Terrakion, Mamoswine, Gliscor, and Reuniclus, make good teammates as well.</p> "

  "Jellicent": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW OU metagame in general. A <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/jellicent-qc-0-2-gp-0-2.3680621/\">revamp</a> is currently being worked on for this analysis.</p> <hr /> <p>If facial hair is any indication of a Pokemon's viability, it should come as no surprise that Jellicent frequently finds a spot on teams. However, Jellicent has more than just supreme stubble to back it up, including fantastic Special Defense and HP stats, reasonable physical bulk, reliable recovery, and a unique typing. Jellicent's typing is certainly one aspect that distinguishes it from the norm: not only can it stand as a bulky Water-type, but it can use its Ghost typing to fill the small gap last generation's Rotom formes left in our hearts. It also allows Jellicent to take on the myriad of new Fighting-type Pokemon, and effectively cripple them by inducing status, such as a burn.</p> <p>Offensively, Jellicent has a few things going for it. It has a decent Special Attack stat that can be used to fire off STAB Water-type moves in the rain for passable damage. While its Speed may initially appear to be lackluster, it isn't terrible for a defensive Pokemon, and Jellicent can outrun and Taunt many defensive threats, including Blissey, Forretress, and Hippowdon. Unfortunately, the \"Floating Pokemon\" is grounded; Jellicent will often have to rely on Recover because it takes full damage from entry hazards. This includes the largely threatening Toxic Spikes, which, just like Toxic, can greatly hinder Jellicent from doing its job.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Pain Split is a less reliable method of recovery that can damage the opponent, but Recover is generally the safer option. Hydro Pump has higher power than Surf and Scald, but its low PP and accuracy mean Jellicent won't be able to tank for very long. Energy Ball or Hidden Power Electric can be used to deal with Water-types, the latter of which allows Jellicent to take on the otherwise problematic Gyarados. Hidden Power Fire could be used to hit Forretress or Ferrothorn, but Will-O-Wisp and Taunt are usually enough to keep them at bay. Night Shade allows Jellicent to hit more consistently, like Blissey with Seismic Toss, and also means it can break some Substitutes that would otherwise be unbreakable. Lastly, Jellicent can set up Trick Room on a team built around said strategy.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Grass-types can usually switch in to Jellicent without being threatened. Celebi and Shaymin both have Natural Cure, so they don't care about Will-O-Wisp or a burn from Scald. If Breloom is able to activate its Toxic Orb, it can often threaten Jellicent. However, it must beware of Hex or Ice Beam because of its low Special Defense. Virizion can't shrug off a burn like the other three can, but will fare very well against more offensive Jellicent as it can switch into most of its moves with relative ease and force Jellicent out with Giga Drain.</p> <p>Rotom-W can deal quite a bit of damage to Jellicent, and it resists Surf and Scald. Jolteon can also be a threat if it can switch in at the right time or come in to revenge kill. Choice Band Tyranitar puts Jellicent in a checkmate position, as it can use Pursuit if Jellicent is predicted to flee. Ferrothorn also can threaten with Power Whip. However, both of these Pokemon must watch out for an aptly-timed burn. Latias is typically manageable, but should it have Calm Mind and Refresh, it will be able to set up. Sun is a huge inconvenience to Jellicent, as it not only weakens its STAB move of choice, but limits its ability to take on threats such as Volcarona.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Utility Counter",
        "description": "<p>Jellicent's typing is arguably its most endearing quality, and allows it to be a fabulous switch-in to a variety of threats. Jirachi (especially with Body Slam) will be hard pressed to do much of anything, Heatran will be forced out, and Choice-locked Azumarill will often even heal Jellicent if it has Water Absorb. Jellicent also serves as a fine answer to Politoed, who will be able to do little more than give Jellicent that signature dumb stare. Will-O-Wisp is Jellicent's defining move, allowing Jellicent to inflict burn and cripple physical attackers without relying on Scald's shaky 30% burn chance. A burn halving the opponent's Attack complements Jellicent's Special Defense well. Will-O-Wisp combined with its second move Taunt, Jellicent also wears down slower Pokemon who rely on a recovery move, including Slowbro, Blissey, Vaporeon, Quagsire, and Hippowdon.</p> <p>Recover is one of Jellicent's most important moves, as it would be on any defensive Pokemon. Thanks to Jellicent's high Special Defense, it is capable of stalling out Draco Meteor from Latios, Latias, or Dragonite using Recover. The final moveslot offers Jellicent different offensive options. Scald possesses the utility to burn opponents while dissuading Fire-types from switching in. Night Shade offers consistent damage regardless of Jellicent's lack of EV investment in offense. Shadow Ball allows Jellicent to immediately threaten Starmie's elimination, compounding the difficulty in spinning away entry hazards laid by Jellicent's team. The EV spread is simple, optimizing its lower physical defense. 248 HP EVs allow Jellicent to take less damage from Spikes.</p> <p>Bold is the primary nature, as it works well with the EV spread and makes Jellicent more reliable in handling Landorus-T. However, a Calm nature could be used as it cushions Jellicent from Draco Meteors to a greater extent. If Skarmory is a problem, 84 Speed EVs allow Jellicent to outspeed and Taunt minimum Speed Skarmory. Finally, the ability slot is up for grabs. Water Absorb is a great all-around ability, especially if members of the team often lure in a Water-type attack. It also allows Jellicent to switch into Scald, which could otherwise potentially burn Jellicent and greatly hinder its usefulness. Cursed Body has more situational uses, but is still viable. For example, choice-locked users will typically be unable to do much to the combination of Cursed Body + Recover, and Calm Mind Reuniclus will often be beaten one-on-one.</p> <p>If burning the opponent isn't a priority for Jellicent because of Scald's 30% chance or you need a move to cover threats such as Latios, then Toxic is a viable alternative. It also allows Jellicent to much more quickly defeat opposing Jellicent. However, Toxic is generally the lesser option and may clash with Scald's ability to inflict burns. It also means that Jellicent will have no way of handling stronger physical attackers and will lose every day of the week. Ice Beam could be used over Taunt to hit Gliscor harder while also scaring away Grass-type switch-ins such as Virizion or Breloom. Shadow Ball hits Psychic and Ghost types, notably Starmie and opposing Jellicent, harder than Surf or Scald will, and is an option in that respect, especially on a dedicated rain team where another offensive Water-type move is redundant. Hex could be used over Shadow Ball if Jellicent finds a lot of time to inflict status upon the opponent.</p> <p>This set works well for teams that need a reliable spinblocker, as Jellicent can take most of them on with relative ease. Ferrothorn makes a good teammate in that regard, as it can lure in Fighting- and Fire-type moves while setting up hazards that Jellicent can protect. Jellicent also does well taking out Fire- and Water-type Pokemon, so teammates that enjoy the removal of such types, such as Skarmory and Scizor, would be well off with Jellicent as a partner. It should be kept in mind how offensively weak this Jellicent is, because if Jellicent isn't using a coverage move like Energy Ball or Ice Beam, it is badly walled by Water-types or Grass-types, respectively. A strong Dragon-type, such as Dragonite, can usually handle both of these strong defense-types and Jellicent can in return resist Ice-type attacks directed at them. Blissey and Snorlax make good teammates defensively, as they can lure in Fighting-type attacks while boasting an immunity to Ghost-type attacks. Hydreigon is in a similar position; Jellicent serves as a good answer to most of the Pokemon that would threaten it.</p> <p>It is important to note that this set, with the right prediction, can shut down Tyranitar and Ferrothorn with the combination of Will-O-Wisp and Taunt. If such a switch-in is predicted, it is wise to use Will-O-Wisp to prevent Crunch or Power Whip from doing too much damage, and then using Taunt to prevent the inevitable Stealth Rock or Spikes.</p> "

This set's niche is for a more concentrated form of stall, as this set's primary objective is to tank hits, inflict status, and slowly wear the opponent down. This set is extremely viable over other walls such as Blissey and Chansey because of Jellicent's arguably better typing, dual STAB, and the ability to spinblock against nearly every Rapid Spin user. To add to that, Jellicent has a great ability in Water Absorb, which provides it with valuable recovery whenever it is hit with a Water-type move.</p> <p>Scald provides a strong, special STAB attack and a chance for a nasty status affliction. Recover allows Jellicent to survive much longer in tandem with Leftovers, and is a necessity for this set. The choice between Toxic and Will-O-Wisp is one based on preference. Toxic allows Jellicent to stall out dangerous threats faster than Will-O-Wisp, but doesn't give the Attack drop which enables Jellicent to stay in on physical threats. Toxic is the preferred option because it hits Volcarona (a dangerous special threat), and absorbing physical attacks is not this set's goal. The fourth moveslot is a toss-up between Shadow Ball and Ice Beam, although Shadow Ball is generally better due to its ability to hit Latias, Latios, and Celebi much harder than Ice Beam. It also provides super effective coverage on Alakazam, Gengar, and other Jellicent, while hitting Dragon-types neutrally. Ice Beam can be used for coverage against Dragonite, Salamence, and Grass-types, however, if one wishes.</p> <p>The EV spread allows for maximum special bulk, with the 36 Defense EVs guaranteeing that Starmie's Psyshock will never 2HKO Jellicent. In addition to the moves already listed, Jellicent has several other attacking options. Surf can be used for a higher damage output, although it doesn't score any additional KOs and loses a helpful chance to inflict status. Energy Ball can hit both Gastrodon and Quagsire super effectively while still mainting good coverage alongside Scald. Night Shade can be used in place of Shadow Ball for consistent damage, although Blissey and Chansey are immune to it. Compounding upon the aforementioned offensive options, Jellicent can be tweaked for a more defensive niche too. Jellicent can reliably set up Trick Room to help teammates, although this is relatively gimmicky because there are superior offensive options for such a role. Taunt and more Speed EVs can be used to mimic the Utility Counter set, although it involves taking Special Defense away, which is not recommended. Jellicent can also use its Cursed Body ability to disable an opponent's move. Finally, Jellicent can add more EVs in Defense to increase its overall bulk. 60 Defense EVs avoid the 2HKO from Mixed Infernape's Stone Edge and 140 allow Jellicent to live after taking two Stone Edges from Scarf Terrakion.</p> <p>Excellent teammates for this set are ones that lay down hazards while resisting Jellicent's weaknesses. Examples of these are Ferrothorn, Heatran, Celebi, and Skarmory. This set also enjoys teammates that can get rid of Pursuit users such as Scizor and Tyranitar; these include one's own Scizor, Magnezone, and Terrakion. Gliscor also makes a great teammate because it can tank physical hits that Jellicent cannot while the two also cover each other's weaknesses quite well. Common counters to this set include Pokemon that abuse Substitute to avoid status, as well as Pursuit users. Jellicent can counteract these problems by carrying the proper coverage moves against key Pokemon.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>If you ever thought Jellicent was just a bulky Water-type that happened to be able to block Rapid Spin, think again. While its stats do not immediately show it, if you dig deeper and examine Jellicent's movepool and the Pokemon that tend to switch into it, it's quite clear that Jellicent can be a surprisingly effective lure and wallbreaker. The biggest catch behind a Choice Specs set is Jellicent's access to the precious Water Spout (which is barely seen on any Pokemon outside of the mighty Kyogre), as well as STAB Shadow Ball, which tends to hit its common switch-ins, such as Latias and Celebi, for super effective damage. Powered by Politoed's rain, Jellicent's Water Spout reaches an astounding 337 Base Power, rivaling the damage output of Choice Specs Palkia's Hydro Pump. Between Water Spout and Shadow Ball, it is difficult to find a Pokemon that can stomach Jellicent's assaults.</p> <p>Below are just a number of damage calculations that demonstrate Jellicent's power. All calculations involving Water Spout assume rainy weather (unless stated otherwise), and Jellicent's HP is at 100%:</p> <ul> <li>Water Spout vs 4 HP / 252 SpD Calm Blissey: 40.81% - 48.29% <li>Water Spout vs 112 HP / 0 SpD Rotom-W: 79.18% - 93.31%</li> <li>Water Spout vs 4 HP / 0 SpD Latios: 68.54% - 81.13%</li> <li>Water Spout vs 252 HP / 208 SpD Ferrothorn: 47.44% - 55.97%</li> <li>Water Spout vs 0 HP / 0 SpD Virizion: 56.04% - 65.94%</li> <li>Water Spout vs 252 HP / 0 SpD Reuniclus: 121.70% - 143.16%</li> <li>Water Spout vs 252 HP / 192 SpD Sassy Tyranitar (Sand): 75.74% - 89.60%</li> <li>Water Spout vs 252 HP / 92 SpD Ninetales (Sun): 78.86% - 93.14%</li> <li>Shadow Ball vs 252 HP / 0 SpD Latias: 70.88% - 84.07%</li> <li>Shadow Ball vs 220 HP / 0 SpD Celebi: 80.81% - 95.96%</li> </ul> <p>As seen above, with some entry hazard support, Jellicent can OHKO or 2HKO most Pokemon in the metagame. In the third slot, Jellicent can utilize a secondary Water STAB attack to fall back on when its HP gets low. Surf is the most reliable option, while Hydro Pump is still immensely powerful in the rain at the cost of accuracy. Scald can be used for the burn chance, but it is generally not preferred, as the lack of power seems counterproductive on a wallbreaking lure.</p> <p>The last slot is optional. Ice Beam allows Jellicent to hit Dragonite, which can be very problematic if it is at full HP (due to Multiscale), Virizion, and other Grass-types for super effective damage. Energy Ball, on the other hand, deals 4x effective damage against Gastrodon, which is immune to Water Spout and has enough Special Defense to take on Shadow Ball and Recover off the damage; it also hits Vaporeon harder than Shadow Ball does.</p> <p>The EV spread is used so Jellicent outspeeds minimum Speed Skarmory and swiftly OHKOes it with Water Spout before it can set up hazards (if Sturdy is not active). A Modest nature and max Special Attack are for maximum damage output, while the remaining EVs go into HP for bulk. Water Absorb is obviously the preferred ability, as it can allow Jellicent to recover off hazard damage, thus powering up Water Spout.</p> <p>As shown by the damage calculations, Jellicent highly appreciates entry hazard support. With a layer of Stealth Rock and Spikes, Jellicent can 2HKO Blissey in the rain with full powered Water Spouts, while with Stealth Rock alone, it can 2HKO Ferrothorn and Rotom-W most of the time. A Ferrothorn of your own is Jellicent's best friend, as it resists all of the Water- / Ghost-type's weaknesses and easily sets up multiple layers of entry hazards. Jellicent can block Rapid Spin to further put pressure on the opponent. However, entry hazards on Jellicent's side of the field greatly cuts its effectiveness, as they reduce Water Spout's power. Donphan is a decent partner that has good synergy with Jellicent and Ferrothorn, and can set up Stealth Rock while spinning away entry hazards. Starmie is a great offensive Rapid Spinner to use alongside Jellicent, as it can spin away entry hazards while Jellicent lures in Starmie's counters and deals heavy damage to them. Fast Taunt users, Espeon, and Xatu are also good teammates, as they can prevent entry hazards from going up in the first place.</p> <p>Obviously, Politoed is a great friend of Jellicent's, as it provides endless rain for Jellicent to spam Water Spout with. Blissey is also a fantastic partner, as it is immune to opposing Shadow Balls, can take Thunderbolts and Giga Drains with absolute ease, and can pass giant Wishes to heal Jellicent. In return, Jellicent can switch into Fighting-type attacks that are aimed at Blissey. Latias, Celebi, and Virizion can easily switch into Electric- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Jellicent. As mentioned before, Dragonite can be a very problematic Pokemon to deal with if Stealth Rock is not up, as Multiscale allows it to tank Water Spout and potentially Ice Beam with a lot of Special Defense investment. It can then use its powerful Dragon-type STAB to heavily damage Jellicent. Jirachi, Bronzong, and Skarmory are all excellent checks to Dragonite.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced around the time BW was the main generation. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the current BW OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Haxorus's name isn't the only cool thing about him. Sporting a massive base 147 Attack, Haxorus has the ability to OHKO or 2HKO nearly everything in the game, even without entry hazard support. In addition, access to amazing moves such as Dragon Dance, Swords Dance, Outrage, and several great coverage moves including Superpower and Aqua Tail, make him both devastating and unpredictable. Unfortunately, he has meager defenses and a disappointing Speed stat which can sometimes cause him to be brushed aside in favor of his Dragon-type brethren, namely Garchomp, Salamence, Dragonite, and Kyurem-B. Haxorus faces considerable competition from Kyurem-B in particular, as both Pokemon are strikingly similar; possessing overkill Attack stats and similar Speed stats, but Kyurem-B possesses far greater durability and a great Special Attack stat. Despite these shortcomings, Haxorus's sheer power and incredible offensive coverage often merits him a spot on a team, as very little can safely switch into this behemoth.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf was once a staple on Haxorus, but has been made largely unnecessary with the introduction of Kyurem-B. It still takes neutral damage from Stealth Rock, and it isn't weak to common priority moves, so if a strong and fast physical Dragon-type is needed, feel free to use it. Haban Berry might seem attractive on paper, but it's rather underwhelming in practice as Haxorus is still usually OHKOed by most Dragon-type moves. As mentioned earlier, Rivalry Haxorus is a significant gamble, but one with a huge payoff. If an Attack boost is achieved, Haxorus is capable of potentially 2HKOing Pokemon it wouldn't dream of 2HKOing with Choice Band-boosted Outrage, such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock. The inverse is also true, and Haxorus loses out on many potential OHKOs if Rivalry is used. Since genders are randomized, the odds of achieving an Attack boost are 50% at best (keep in mind that some players selectively choose their genders for each Pokemon), so it isn't a very good ability to use in a serious match. Unnerve is completely worthless on Haxorus, since he doesn't face Pokemon that typically use resist Berries. Haxorus's movepool is fairly limited, and most viable options have already been covered. Dragon Tail is a decent option on the Choice Band set, but its negative priority coupled with Haxorus's poor defenses makes it a relatively risky choice. Other than that, there aren't many other useful moves for Haxorus to take advantage of.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The list of Pokemon that can switch into Haxorus safely is unfortunately (or fortunately!) quite sparse due to his ridiculous Attack and powerful STAB. Skarmory is as close to a counter as they come, as it can come in on most Outrages and Roost off the damage. Skarmory should watch out for the Swords Dance set however, as it risks getting OHKOed by +2 Fighting Gem Superpower after a bit of prior damage or 2HKOed by +2 Aqua Tail in the rain. Other Steel-types such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Forretress are also fine choices to take Haxorus's Outrages, although they all lack Skarmory's combination of stellar Defense and reliable recovery and can be picked off by Haxorus's coverage moves. Revenge killing Haxorus with a faster Pokemon is often the safest way to take him out. There are numerous fast and strong Pokemon such as Latios, Garchomp, Salamence, and Terrakion that can reliably revenge kill Haxorus assuming they avoid a super effective attack. Flying-types such as Tornadus can come in unharmed if Haxorus is lured into using Earthquake and OHKO back with an appropriate attack. Strong priority moves such as Bullet Punch, Mach Punch, and Ice Shard can damage Haxorus quite badly as well. Mamoswine and Weavile get special mentions because Haxorus is weak to their STAB priority Ice Shard, while Scizor is another fine choice because it resists Haxorus's STAB Outrage.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>In a metagame filled with increasingly powerful physical threats, Swords Dance Haxorus still represents the absolute gold standard for one-turn power in OU. Haxorus is flat out uncounterable at +2--to put things in perspective, even Skarmory can't stop Haxorus once he gets going. When the opportunity presents itself, set up Swords Dance on something he can force out, usually by bluffing a Choice Band set. +2 Outrage will devastate anything that's unlucky enough to switch in; everything in OU (barring Skarmory and Forretress) is flat out 2HKOed by +2 Outrage at worst. Prominent physical walls such as Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Tangrowth all face potential OHKOs from +2 Outrage with a bit of prior damage (or none if Life Orb is used). Superpower might seem counterproductive on a boosting set, but its high Base Power is needed in order to defeat any Skarmory or Forretress that might switch in. Fighting Gem temporarily gives Haxorus Fighting STAB on Superpower, which lets him overcome the Steel-types that aren't fazed by Outrage or Earthquake, such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Forretress. Substitute offers Haxorus protection against status and also grants him (a few) setup opportunities. It also provides Haxorus utility against faster paced offensive teams, since he isn't going to get very far with just Swords Dance. As those teams are less likely to use pure defensive Pokemon, he doesn't even need the power boost from Swords Dance and can do some damage with just Substitute.</p> <p>Aqua Tail gets an exceptional power boost in the rain, and is a staple for Haxorus on rain teams. Fighting Gem Superpower becomes completely superfluous alongside Aqua Tail, as Skarmory and Forretress are effortlessly 2HKOed by +2 Life Orb Aqua Tail in the rain and some other Steel-types such as Jirachi or Scizor are actually OHKOed. Low Kick makes for a great alternative to Superpower, as it's capable of dealing with most of the Steel-types that trouble Haxorus, and Aqua Tail can still cover Steel-types that take negligible damage from Low Kick. Earthquake nets a little bit more coverage, and is more potent against Steel-types such as Jirachi, Metagross, and Bronzong. It's also useful in situations where the Fighting Gem doesn't need to be used, and benefits significantly from Mold Breaker.</p> <p>There are several alternatives to the items listed on the Swords Dance set; Draco Plate provides a power boost to Outrage that is almost comparable to Life Orb but without the recoil, notably allowing Haxorus to always OHKO Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Tangrowth with +2 Outrage and a layer of Spikes. Mystic Water strengthens Aqua Tail and makes it frighteningly powerful under rain, granting Haxorus the 2HKO on Skarmory and OHKOs on both Landorus-T (after an Intimidate) and Gliscor after a Swords Dance. Salac Berry can boost Haxorus's Speed, but it can be tricky to actually pull off in a match, although if Haxorus can take one strong hit that just barely won't OHKO him, or if Substitute can bring it safely into Salac Berry range, a +2 Attack, +1 Speed Haxorus is utterly devastating. A bulkier spread consisting of 92 HP / 200 Atk / 216 Spe is available, which noticeably increases Haxorus's durability while keeping his Attack and Speed stat mostly intact. Keep in mind however, that if Haxorus's Attack is lowered, he'll lose some potential OHKOs (most notably against Skarmory at 87% HP), and by lowering his speed, he risks getting outsped by Kyurem-B. Taunt will ensure that no matter what Skarmory will lose to Haxorus in a one-on-one match-up. It's also somewhat effective against Forretress, as it prevents Forretress from setting up.</p> <p>Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Skarmory are appreciated, as they push physical walls such as Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Forretress into OHKO range. U-turn users that lure out Skarmory are great partners to this set, as even the nonexistent damage that U-turn deals to Skarmory (in addition to Stealth Rock damage when it switches out) can make the difference in OHKOing Skarmory when it switches into Haxorus later in the game. Haxorus can work well with Reflect and Light Screen, as screens allow Haxorus to come in early, soften up the opposing team, and then prepare the opposing team for another sweeper. The increased bulk makes it much easier to use Haxorus to its fullest potential as a wallbreaker. Swords Dance Haxorus is a great partner to most Dragon-types, since he can lure and weaken/KO most, if not all, of their checks. Latios, Garchomp, and Kyurem-B are some of the Dragon-types that love having their checks and counters weakened or eliminated before going wild. A Haxorus with a Swords Dance under its belt is a huge threat--slower Pokemon are almost always devastated by Haxorus's overkill Attack and he is effective against stall teams or teams with strong defensive cores. Of course when all is said and done, Haxorus is still utterly useless in the face of faster Pokemon. Remember to use this set with discretion, as a Choice Band set might be the better choice for the team. It's a matter of ease of use versus potential; Choice Band is easier to use, and is much more effective early on, but can be easily stopped by hard counters or revenge killed. Swords Dance requires a bit more finesse and might not be useful early on, but it can rewarding when pulled off correctly.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Haxorus and Choice Band go together like peanut butter and jelly, as it boosts Haxorus's already amazing Attack to an absurd 648. There are very few Pokemon that can claim to counter Choice Band Haxorus, as virtually everything gets at best 2HKOed by an appropriate attack. Even the bulkiest physical walls, including Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Tangrowth, will be unable to keep up with Haxorus's onslaught, and because many Steel-types are 2HKOed by him as well, Haxorus is as close to \"uncounterable\" as they come.</p> <p>Even though Choice Band Outrage is incredibly powerful, Haxorus's coverage moves should be used to weaken his checks before really cutting loose with Outrage. One of the strongest physical Fighting-type moves, Superpower, has been made available to Haxorus, and with it comes the ability to utterly destroy most Steel-type switch-ins. For example, Ferrothorn, a Pokemon that was once a good check to Choice Band Haxorus, is now hard-pressed to switch into Haxorus, as Superpower will easily OHKO with a bit of prior damage. Superpower is actually as strong as a STAB Dragon Claw, so it's a good idea to use it in situations where Haxorus needs to do damage without being locked in. Earthquake is a bit weaker than Superpower, but complements Outrage well by nailing grounded Steel-types, and thanks to Mold Breaker, Levitate users such as Bronzong, Gengar, and Rotom-W must think twice about switching in. Aqua Tail is used solely to deal heavy damage to Skarmory, Forretress, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, all of which face being 2HKOed from switching into a rain-boosted Aqua Tail. It should go without saying, however, that Aqua Tail demands the use of Politoed as a partner to function and is practically useless without the boost from rain. Dragon Claw exists as a weaker alternative to Outrage; it may not kill everything, but it's still a damaging move option that doesn't lock Haxorus in.</p> <p>In order to appreciate the sheer power of Choice Band Haxorus's Outrage, here are some damage calculations against some of the premier physical walls and Steel-types that resist it:</p> <ul> <li>-1 Outrage vs. 200/244 Landorus-T: 54.74 - 64.49% <li>Outrage vs. 252/184+ Gliscor: 64.69% - 76.27%</li> <li>Outrage vs. 252/252+ Hippowdon: 54.29% - 63.81%</li> <li>Outrage vs. 248/252+ Vaporeon: 75.16% - 88.77%</li> <li>Outrage vs. 252/0 Scizor: 51.45% - 60.47%</li> <li>Outrage vs. 252/48+ Ferrothorn: 34.94% - 40.91%</li> <li>Outrage vs. 252/0 Jirachi: 43.81% - 51.49%</li> <li>Outrage vs. 0/0 Heatran: 52.01% - 61.30%</li> </ul> <p>A Jolly nature allows Haxorus to always outspeed Kyurem-B and most variants of opposing Haxorus and Hydreigon. In truth, there isn't much point to using a Jolly nature on Choice Band Haxorus, as the extra Speed isn't worth the large drop in power, nor is it worth the irreparable damage to one's pride. Haxorus's movepool is sparse, but Dual Chop and Rock Slide are worth considering over Dragon Claw. Dual Chop can be used to break opposing Substitutes, but its accuracy can be off-putting. Rock Slide lets Haxorus hit Gyarados, Volcarona, and Zapdos without locking himself into Outrage, but they are still hit hard by Dragon Claw, and Rock Slide can give Steel-types free switches. Another option that should be considered is Rivalry. Although Mold Breaker is great when used with Earthquake, Rivalry can be used for an extra boost. The 25% increase in power is very significant considering Haxorus's amazing Attack--for example, with one layer of Spikes, Outrage will usually 2HKO the standard Relaxed Ferrothorn. However, this can easily backfire, as the 25% penalty in Attack can prevent Haxorus from getting the OHKO on Pokemon who would ordinarily be OHKOed by Mold Breaker Haxorus.</p> <p>Although Haxorus is going to be hitting everything hard with Outrage, it still has trouble with the bane of most physical attackers: Skarmory. Skarmory can come in on any of Haxorus's attacks and proceed to Roost off the damage or set up Spikes thanks to its amazing Defense. Other than Skarmory, there aren't really any other true Haxorus counters. Bronzong, Ferrothorn, and defensive Jirachi are decent checks, but although they can usually take two Outrages, they will fall to a well-predicted Earthquake or Superpower. Magnezone is one of the best partners for Haxorus because it can easily trap and kill most Steel-types with Magnet Pull. It also has solid synergy with Haxorus, as it can take Ice- and Dragon-type attacks aimed at the giant salamander. Haxorus is prone to being revenge killed by the likes of Mamoswine, Weavile, and Scizor thanks to their powerful priority attacks. An allied Scizor can be helpful in this situation to take Ice Shards and Bullet Punches aimed at Haxorus. Pairing Haxorus with Pokemon that can take advantage of Haxorus's ability to KO most Steel-types and physical walls works quite well. Pokemon such as Latios will absolutely love having Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Heatran out of the picture so it can spam Draco Meteor with little to no fear. Choice Band Haxorus tends to get picked off after it has KOed a Pokemon, though smart play and proper positioning can allow Haxorus to stick around longer and potentially get even more KOs.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While it should be fairly obvious that Haxorus makes great use of either Dragon Dance or Swords Dance, each set is somewhat ineffective against specific types of teams, which limits Haxorus's utility if certain threats haven't been eliminated. By using both moves on the same set, however, Haxorus gains the ability to set up flexibly and destroy almost any team after the appropriate boost. For instance, using Swords Dance enables Haxorus to break through walls and bulky attackers on slower defensive teams, while Dragon Dance is reserved for offensive teams with faster Pokemon. If possible, Haxorus should find opportunities to use both boosting moves to become faster and even stronger, though his sweep might be at risk if he attempts to boost again. After either dance, practically every Pokemon in OU is 2HKOed, if not instantly vaporized, by any combination of Outrage, Low Kick, or Earthquake (except for Skarmory).</p> <p>This set can be tweaked in a few ways; if bulk is desired, 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe is a viable alternative, as it allows Haxorus to outspeed positive base 130s after a Dragon Dance boost. Because setting up is more crucial than ever, Lum Berry is ideal to heal off status and Outrage-induced confusion, giving Haxorus opportunities to set up in front of status-reliant foes. As far as power-boosting items are concerned, Draco Plate is the preferred item, compromising between Haxorus's decent bulk and Life Orb's detrimental recoil. Even then, Lum Berry tends to be the better choice in most instances because of the popularity of defensive status users in the metagame, especially Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Seeing as one can choose whichever boosting move to use for the appropriate situation, very little is completely safe from this set. To play this set correctly and avoid Outrage-induced confusion, however, bulky Steel-types, especially Skarmory and Forretress, in addition to Jirachi if Low Kick is used, need to be eliminated beforehand. For starters, Magnezone is an instant solution to these threats due to its ability to trap and eliminate them immediately. Dual screens support from the likes of Latios and Espeon (preferably with Hidden Power Fire to weaken Steel-type counters) is still a good team option to consider, providing more setup opportunities and a form of insurance against possible revenge killers. It would also be advisable to pair Haxorus with alternative offensive teammates that can take advantage of the damage that Haxorus causes if he finds himself attacking and fainting too early in the game.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Haxorus is by no means slow, but his awkward base 97 Speed means he'll always be outpaced by common Pokemon such as Garchomp, Latios, Terrakion, and Keldeo. As such, Haxorus can make great use of Dragon Dance to boost his already sky-high Attack along with his mediocre Speed in order to outpace and KO faster threats that he would otherwise lose to. Although finding an opportunity to set up may be difficult for a fragile Pokemon such as Haxorus, and other Dragon Dance users are generally better, the benefits to setting up with Haxorus can be quite substantial, as the combination of speed and power make Haxorus incredibly hard to stop. After a single Dragon Dance, Haxorus reaches a terrifying 648 Attack and 427 Speed, enough to outpace every common Pokemon without a Choice Scarf. With a Dragon Dance under his belt, Outrage will 2HKO virtually everything in the game. Earthquake will nail all other Steel-types besides Skarmory--even Bronzong isn't safe thanks to Mold Breaker. Low Kick provides Haxorus with additional coverage against Ferrothorn, which doesn't take that much damage from +1 Earthquake, and Air Balloon Heatran. Taunt, on the other hand, can prevent some untimely phazing, or prevent status users from completely crippling Haxorus. Lum Berry is a great item that allows Haxorus to avoid being hit by status or to immediately snap out of confusion after using Outrage. Yache Berry is handy for weakening Ice-type moves and preventing Haxorus from being picked off by Ice Shard users.</p> <p>Life Orb is a powerful, albeit risky item for this set. Haxorus's teammates should focus on either eliminating his counters or creating an opportunity for him to set up a Dragon Dance. Magnezone deserves an obvious mention for its ability to turn Skarmory into fried chicken through the use of Magnet Pull and Thunderbolt. Choice Scarf Rotom-W is also an excellent partner, as it has little to fear from Skarmory, Bronzong, and most other Haxorus checks. Rotom-W can also use Trick to cripple an incoming Pokemon, which will subsequently give Haxorus a chance to use Dragon Dance as the Tricked Pokemon is forced to switch out. Haxorus is extremely susceptible to revenge killing by priority users such as Mamoswine, Weavile, and Scizor, all of which Rotom-W can check decently as well. An allied Skarmory can add some more insurance as most priority users are physically inclined, while Haxorus will appreciate Skarmory's ability to set up Spikes. Pokemon that can set up dual screens will be immensely useful for Haxorus due to his poor defenses. Azelf, Latios, and Espeon are all very good choices thanks to their great Speed, and with the proper investment, they still possess the bulk to set up dual screens more than once.</p> "

  "Mienshao": {
    "overview": "<p>Mienshao has a number of traits that set it apart from its main competitor in OU, Terrakion. A what's essentially an immunity to passive damage thanks to Regenerator and better wallbreaking abilities thanks to the ability to use special attacks make Mienshao a better dedicated wallbreaker than Terrakion and a perfect weapon to use against defensive teams. Aside from being a better wallbreaker than Terrakion, which is Mienshao's main niche in OU, Mienshao has a few more aces up its sleeve. Thanks to Reckless, Choice Scarf Mienshao is more powerful than Choice Scarf Terrakion and has better cleaning potential, but it needs a ton of support, especially in the removal of Ghost-types, which prevent Mienshao from spamming its main STAB. Finally, with access to Regenerator and Baton Pass, Mienshao can provide free switches for its teammates with its SubPass set, something that Terrakion can't do.</p> <p>Although Mienshao has quite a few appealing attributes, it is not without flaws. Mienshao is extremely frail, and thus cannot take even the weakest of hits comfortably. This means that Mienshao must get a free switch-in to come in, forcing it to act as more of a hit-and-run attacker. Mienshao's main STAB, High Jump Kick, has a nasty side effect, chipping away 50% of its health each time it fails to land. With the prevalence of the move Protect and Ghost-types, such as Jellicent and Gengar, Mienshao has to be very careful. It also faces slight competition from Terrakion for a teamslot, as they fill similar roles, not to mention that Terrakion is faster than Mienshao. Nevertheless, Mienshao is very unique compared to other Fighting-types in the tier and can pose a huge threat when used correctly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There are not that many other options for Mienshao, as most of its movepool is quite useless. A Choice Band can used to power up High Jump Kick to even higher levels, but the Life Orb set has similar power, and this set is mostly outclassed by Terrakion anyway. A Bulk Up set sounds tempting, but Mienshao is too frail to take advantage of the Defense boost and will find it very hard to safely set up. An offensive Calm Mind set could work, seeing as Mienshao has access to Grass Knot, Hidden Power Ice, and Aura Sphere; however, it is inferior to its other sets, and there are much better users of Calm Mind out there anyway. Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge on all of its sets if you hate the accuracy of Stone Edge, but the loss in power is easily noticeable. Taunt can help out its Baton Passing set, but it forces it to give up a coverage move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Mienshao is extremely frail, so a single powerful blow can easily take it out, even from full health. Anything that can outspeed it can probably check it with little-to-no problem. Gengar can outspeed Mienshao and OHKO with Shadow Ball. Latios and Latias can threaten it with pretty much all of their moves, but they cannot reliably switch into High Jump Kick. Landorus-T, physically defensive Hippowdon, and Gliscor are all great counters to Choice Scarf Mienshao locked into anything other than Hidden Power Ice. Celebi can come in on the Choice Scarf set's High Jump Kick, but it has to watch out for U-turn. Jellicent is by far one of Mienshao's greatest counters, as it can come in on High Jump Kick and threaten it with Will-O-Wisp or even Scald. Sableye is arguably even better than Jellicent, as it fears none of Mienshao's moves and cannot be Pursuit trapped by Tyranitar or Scizor. Starmie can also outpace Mienshao and survive a High Jump Kick from the Choice Scarf set if need be. Tornadus can revenge kill with Hurricane as long as Mienshao isn't holding a Choice Scarf.</p> ",

        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<p>If there is one set that really sets Mienshao apart from the other Fighting-types in OU, it would have to be this one. This set takes all of Mienshao's useful traits and mixes them all together. Because Mienshao has the ability to utilize its Special Attack, this set runs special moves that provide coverage on most of its common switch-ins, particularly Gliscor, Landorus-T, Jellicent, and Hippowdon. Regenerator is really useful here, as it helps mitigate Life Orb recoil every time Mienshao switches out. High Jump Kick is Mienshao's only STAB move and it is put to good use on this set by hitting everything very hard, 2HKOing and OHKOing most unresistant foes while decimating Tyranitar, Blissey, and Ferrothorn. Be cautious when using this move when Ghost-types are around, or else Mienshao's health will be instantly halved by recoil. Also make sure to be wary of using this move against Pokemon that commonly carry Protect, such as Ferrothorn, as this will also incur the recoil. The next move is a tough choice between Grass Knot and Stone Edge. Grass Knot is usually preferred because it messes with Mienshao's common counters, such as Jellicent and physically defensive Hippowdon, both of which wall this set quite well. Stone Edge still has its merits against Volcarona and Gyarados though, so it all depends on what threats you need Mienshao to cover. Hidden Power Ice is one of this set's greatest selling points, as it can KO Gliscor and Landorus-T and prevent them from completely walling this set while also dealing super effective damage to Garchomp, Salamence, and Dragonite. U-turn rounds off the set by allowing Mienshao to create some much-needed momentum in addition to having outstanding synergy with Regenerator.</p> <p>Because this set depends a lot on Mienshao's special attacks, a Naive nature should always be used to get the best out of both offensive stats. Fake Out is an option for dealing damage right off the bat and picking off weakened foes, but it is pitifully weak, and Mienshao misses the coverage provided by Grass Knot or Stone Edge. Reckless can be used if you want really powerful High Jump Kicks, but Regenerator is much more useful as it mitigates Life Orb recoil. Partner-wise, Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Scizor come to mind, as they can Pursuit trap Ghost-types relatively easy. Bulky Psychic-types, such as Celebi, defensive Starmie, and Latias, are also quite problematic for this set because Mienshao has nothing to really hit them hard with, but Tyranitar can deal with them quite easily. Choice Scarf Tyranitar also has the ability to outspeed and trap Gengar, Latias, and Latios while also bringing in sand for extra residual damage to help Mienshao guarantee a few 2HKOs, most notably on physically defensive Jellicent with Grass Knot after Stealth Rock. Latias and Latios are really nice teammates because they can outspeed Keldeo and Terrakion, both of which outspeed Mienshao and threaten it. Because Mienshao is so frail, bulky teammates, such as specially defensive Celebi, Hippowdon, specially defensive Heatran, and Landorus-T, are choices, having the added bonus of being able to set up Stealth Rock.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>A Choice Scarf sacrifices Mienshao's ability to switch between moves in order to allow it to become a potent revenge killer. Mienshao's Speed stat combined with a Choice Scarf allows it to outspeed all positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon at +1, letting Mienshao revenge kill the likes of Salamence, Haxorus, and Volcarona, which commonly boost their Speed. Ability-wise, Reckless is almost always preferred, as it allows Mienshao's High Jump Kick to 2HKO even Skarmory after Stealth Rock, a feat that Choice Scarf Terrakion can only dream of. Regenerator still has its merits though, especially if your team lacks a Rapid Spin user. Unlike Terrakion, Mienshao has access to U-turn, which lets it gain much-needed momentum against common switch-ins, such as Jellicent and Hippowdon, while also dealing a huge chunk to Celebi. High Jump Kick hits very hard when boosted by Reckless, and oftentimes Mienshao will find itself sweeping with it at the end of the game, OHKOing pretty much everything that's weak to it and 2HKOing almost everything else. A few notable 2HKOs that High Jump Kick boosted by Reckless achieves are ones on defensive Skarmory after Stealth Rock damage, offensive Latias, and specially defensive Jirachi. Standard Ferrothorn and Breloom are always OHKOed as well. Stone Edge is very important to OHKO Gyarados and Volcarona in particular, both of which can wall all of Mienshao's other moves. Hidden Power Ice is Mienshao's hidden weapon against Gliscor and Landorus-T, which are very common switch-ins against Fighting-types in general. Hidden Power Ice has other uses though, such as OHKOing Dragonite after Stealth Rock and allowing Mienshao to take out Salamence 100% of the time after Stealth Rock, unlike Stone Edge, which misses quite frequently.</p> <p>A Naive nature should always be used on this set because Mienshao does not want Hidden Power Ice to be weakened if it were to run Jolly. Grass Knot is still very much viable on this set because Jellicent and Hippowdon are both very problematic, but it should only be used if you do not need Mienshao to handle Gliscor or Landorus-T. Unlike the all-out attacking set, Choice Scarf Mienshao requires a lot more prediction to use. Due to the prevalence of Jellicent, Gengar, and users of the move Protect, Mienshao has to be very careful when locking itself into High Jump Kick, lest it receive a nasty 50% drop in health due to recoil. To remedy this, Tyranitar and Scizor are stressed on this set as partners. Both of them can trap Jellicent and Gengar with Pursuit, allowing Mienshao to use High Jump Kick without having to worry about it missing due to these Ghost-types. Not only are Scizor and Tyranitar useful for trapping Ghost-types, but they are also useful for trapping bulky Psychic-types, such as Latias and Celebi, which are very problematic for this set. Entry hazard support is stressed heavily on this set, as it secures a few important 2HKOs, such as Skarmory and Latias, while also securing OHKOs on Keldeo and Breloom. Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Forretress are all great users of Spikes. Both Kyurem and Kyurem-B are fantastic teammates because their powerful Ice-type STAB lets them deal with Hippowdon and Landorus-T, allowing Mienshao to run Grass Knot over Hidden Power Ice if you want to.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Baton Pass",
        "description": "<p>Mienshao can utilize its above-average Speed stat and Regenerator in order to become a great Baton Passer. The main goal of this set is to set up a Substitute or a Swords Dance on a predicted switch and then Baton Pass to a suitable recipient. Because Mienshao forces a lot of switches, it will find numerous opportunities to set up. Regenerator is always preferred on this set to mitigate Life Orb recoil, health lost from Substitute, and because Mienshao will be switching in and out quite frequently. The choice between Substitute and Swords Dance depends on your team. If you wish to pass free protection to a sweeper that can set up on its own, then Substitute is preferred; however, if something on your team would appreciate a +2 Attack boost, then Swords Dance is obviously the better choice. High Jump Kick is used to give Mienshao a means of attacking, KOing Tyranitar and Blissey with ease. Although this set is meant to support other teammates, Mienshao can still pose a threat behind a Substitute or with a Swords Dance boost if it has to. Stone Edge is useful for all-around great coverage, preventing Volcarona, Gyarados, and Salamence from setting up on Mienshao.</p> <p>There really isn't too much more to say about this set, as it is pretty straightforward. Mienshao can either pass a Substitute to teammates in order to ease up prediction and provide a free switch-in opportunity, or pass a +2 Attack boost to a suitable recipient. Swords Dance requires more prediction, however, especially if your opponent has a faster check to Mienshao that could keep it from passing.</p> <p>Mienshao's teammates for this set differ depending on what you want Mienshao to be passing. If Substitute is being used, Scarf Tyranitar is one of the best teammates, as it is able to deal with everything that troubles Mienshao due to its ability to come in risk-free. Nasty Plot Celebi also appreciates the free protection that Substitute gives, being able to easily switch in on Jellicent and Hippowdon while still keeping its Substitute intact. Kyurem-B is a fantastic teammate if Mienshao runs Substitute due to Kyurem-B's great bulk and useful resistances to Water and Grass, allowing it to keep the Substitute from breaking. This will let Kyurem-B run an extra coverage move if it wants, as it wouldn't have to run Substitute thanks to Mienshao. Calm Mind Latias and Reuniclus are both deadly behind a Substitute, making them both great partners to this set as well. If Mienshao is running Swords Dance, fast physical attackers are obviously preferred. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can safely switch into fast Psychic-types, such as Latios and Latias, threatening to decimate them with Crunch or trap them with Pursuit. Poison Heal Breloom can easily switch into Scald from Politoed and Jellicent while posing an instant offensive threat to the opposing team. Dragon Dance Gyarados, especially offensive variants with Lum Berry, appreciate the boost and can easily take any move that Hippowdon and Jellicent might throw at them while easily OHKOing them at +2.</p> "

  "Hydreigon": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW OU metagame in general. A <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/hydreigon-ou-qc-0-2.3687781/unread\">revamp</a> is currently being worked on for this analysis.</p> <hr /> <p>Hydreigon belongs to the special group of Pokemon that can boast they possess no true counters: they potentially carry a move that can OHKO or 2HKO any Pokemon in the game, and as such are virtually impossible to switch into. Its peers include such wrecking balls as Deoxys-A, Excadrill, and Salamence. He also has Levitate, garnering many of the benefits his Flying-type brethren possess with nearly none of the drawbacks. Hydreigon is even gifted with excellent attacking and defensive stats as well as a movepool to make any Pokemon leaf-green with envy, so why does he struggle in OU? The answer is simple: Hydreigon's base 98 Speed. While very far from bad, he falls just short of the myriad of faster Pokemon. Hydreigon's secondary Dark typing only makes things worse, giving it weaknesses to Fighting- and Bug-type attacks while doing nothing to improve its STAB coverage or alleviate its Dragon and Ice weaknesses. Hydreigon is not an easy Dragon to use, and isn't always the right one, with many of his peers being faster, more powerful, or both, but don't be afraid to give it a try; this ferocious hydra just might surprise you.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hydreigon's offensive movepool is enormous; it has access to nearly every single respectable attacking move in the game, which gives it a myriad of options to choose from. On the physical side, Hydreigon has access to Acrobatics, Crunch, Dragon Tail, Outrage, and Head Smash. One can choose to use a Choice Band set mostly consisting of these moves, however, it's mostly outclassed by other Choice Band using Dragon-types. Hydreigon has access to Thunder Wave and can use it on any given set to cripple attackers; however, it's not that useful, as most of its common switch-ins are barely impeded by Thunder Wave. Hydreigon can use a defensive set consisting of Taunt / Thunder Wave / Dragon Tail / Roost, and act as sort of defensive tank that spreads paralysis strikingly similar to the parashuffle set that Dragonite employs. Truthfully, Taunt is a fairly large reason to use Hydreigon over Dragonite, as Taunt prevents opposing Pokemon from setting up entry hazards on it, though usually you're much better off using Dragonite or any of Hydreigon's other sets. Make no mistake: these moves and sets are in Other Options for a reason. It's not because the moves themselves are poor, but because a large number of these moves are significantly outclassed by the ones already listed in the above sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Counters? There aren't any! The closest thing to a concrete counter now is Chansey, but even then it's easily 2HKOed by Superpower with some prior damage (a common reality when you consider that Chansey doesn't use Leftovers). Nothing else can touch Hydreigon on a good day. Tyranitar is always OHKOed by Superpower, and Ferrothorn and Jirachi are scorched by Fire Blast. Heatran is OHKOed by Earthquake, and it takes a ton of damage from Superpower and everything else is at best 2HKOed by Draco Meteor. Fortunately, Hydreigon is fairly easy to check in the current BW metagame. Breloom and Keldeo are common and every single one of them can destroy Hydreigon with their powerful Fighting-type moves. The ever-popular Terrakion exists at every corner, waiting to turn Hydreigon into a liability since it is forced to switch out from its powerful Close Combats. It's also naturally outsped and KOed by Latios and Latias. Outside of fast offensive checks, you can rely on good old fashioned priority to take it down. Breloom, Mamoswine, and Scizor are decent choices, though they should only bother trying to take on Hydreigon when it has been weakened as Hydreigon's 92 / 90 physical defense is nothing to sneeze at.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Life Orb Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Hydreigon shines in a metagame where Psychic-types are common, with its combination of a higher damage output, great coverage options, and good bulk and typing differentiating it from other special attackers. Additionally, its Speed, while far from terrific, is perfect for it to threaten Pokemon commonly used on sand balance teams, which are extremely prevalent in BW OU.</p> <p>This Hydreigon set is highly customizable and can be tailored towards your team's needs. Dark Pulse and Roost are the only necessities, as Dark Pulse allows Hydreigon to adequately threaten the bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types in the tier that it is relied on to beat, while Roost gives it decent longevity, as damage from Life Orb and possibly sandstorm can wear it down very quickly. Hydreigon's good bulk and typing allow it to use Roost against many Pokemon that can't adequately damage it, such as defensive Starmie and Celebi. Next, Hydreigon should choose a coverage option that allows it to hit Steel-types, which could otherwise easily switch into its Dark-type STAB moves, super effectively. Flamethrower allows Hydreigon to roast Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Jirachi, and Scizor, while Focus Blast can deal massive amounts of damage to Heatran while still retaining super effective coverage against Ferrothorn. Focus Blast also has the benefit of hitting other Dark-types, such as Tyranitar or opposing Hydreigon. Draco Meteor is an option over either of these moves, as it is Hydreigon's strongest STAB move and has great neutral coverage throughout the tier.</p> <p>Hydreigon's Speed should be maximized to take advantage of its decent Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed Kyurem, Kyurem-B, Nasty Plot Celebi, and Adamant Haxorus, as well as Speed tie with Jolly Toxicroak, all without needing to use a Speed-boosting nature. Hydreigon should have a Modest nature and maximum EVs in Special Attack to increase its damage output. The remaining four EVs can be placed into Special Defense to slightly raise Hydreigon's special bulk, as it will be often switching into weak Scalds or Giga Drains from Pokemon such as Starmie or Celebi; however, if Hydreigon is running Superpower, the four EVs should be placed into Attack and a Mild nature should be used, allowing Hydreigon to 2HKO most Chansey after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Hydreigon has several more attacking options that it can utilize, the main one being the aforementioned Superpower over Focus Blast. Superpower can deal heavier damage to special walls such as Blissey, Chansey, specially defensive Heatran, and Tyranitar. However, Hydreigon is very prone to being burned, as many of the Pokemon it usually switches into carry Scald or Will-O-Wisp, so Focus Blast is generally preferred. For special options, Dragon Pulse is a reliable STAB attack that has good neutral coverage; it can be used over Dark Pulse if your team has alternative ways of handling Psychic- and Ghost-types. If Hydreigon is being used on a rain team, Surf can be used to hit Pokemon such as Heatran, Tyranitar, or Hippowdon super effectively, as it receives a damage boost in the rain. Finally, Hydreigon has access to Fire Blast, and the extra power over Flamethrower can be useful against Pokemon such as Jirachi and Celebi (if Hydreigon is using Dragon Pulse), or in matchups against rain teams. However, Hydreigon usually has enough firepower to break through such Pokemon with Flamethrower and thus appreciates that move's reliability.</p> <p>In terms of team options, defensive Starmie is a good partner, as it checks Keldeo and is able to switch into Fighting- and Ice-type moves aimed at Hydreigon. It can also OHKO Gengar, which threatens Hydreigon. In return, Hydreigon can remove Pokemon such as Jellicent and Ferrothorn, which prevent Starmie from doing its job of keeping your side of the field free from entry hazards. Ferrothorn itself is a good teammate, as Hydreigon appreciates Spikes support, which lets it secure 2HKOs against bulky Pokemon such as Jirachi, Politoed, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. Ferrothorn can also beat fast threats to Hydreigon such as Latios, Latias, and offensive Starmie; Hydreigon, in turn, can beat Celebi and Reuniclus, which often render Ferrothorn setup bait.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<p>Substitute goes hand-in-hand with Hydreigon's excellent coverage and ability to force switches. Instead of viciously attempting to tear its opponents apart, this set adopts the tried and true method of whittling down its foes into KO range. Substitute lets Hydreigon scout its checks, protects it from status effects, and most important of all, protects Hydreigon from taking hits. Hydreigon's mere presence forces Pokemon out, so you will have no trouble setting up Substitutes on forced switches. In other cases, its typing allows it to set up Substitutes on Pokemon that can't really damage it, such as Rotom-W and Celebi. Dragon Pulse is a step down from Draco Meteor, and its disappointing Base Power leaves a lot to be desired; however, it's a reliable STAB move that generally deals sufficient damage. Focus Blast and Fire Blast are awesome coverage moves that ensure that Hydreigon hits everything in OU for at least neutral damage. Hydreigon is still capable of beating its most common checks, such as Tyranitar and Heatran, but dedicated special walls such as Blissey and Chansey are out of Hydreigon's reach. Roost is a decent alternative to Fire Blast, as it helps stave off Substitute recoil, and is a flat out requirement if you're planning on using Life Orb, as Substitute and Life Orb recoil (and other forms of passive damage) eventually take their toll on Hydreigon.</p> <p>Life Orb was previously mentioned as an alternative to Leftovers on Hydreigon. With a Life Orb equipped, Hydreigon trades longevity for power, but note that Life Orb basically forces Hydreigon to rely on Roost which could cost it some coverage. A Timid nature, is as always, an option for those who want Hydreigon to outspeed Jolly Haxorus, Gliscor, and opposing Modest Hydreigon. These threats are exceedingly rare, however, and you're weakening a set that already needs all the power it can get. Dark Pulse can deal with Jellicent and Mew who invest in Special Defense, as well as Reuniclus. However, it's far too weak and specialized to be of any use on average. Work Up might seem like a lesser option, but when you're safely behind a Substitute and Hydreigon gets going, you can really get some damage against the opposing team. With Work Up, Superpower with a Rash or Timid nature can be used over Focus Blast. If you're worried about consistency, Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast. It's noticeably weaker than Fire Blast, though; Flamethrower fails to 2HKO specially defensive Jirachi, for example. In the same vein, Earth Power can be used over Focus Blast to grant Hydreigon reliable coverage against Heatran and Tyranitar. If the above recommendations are of any indication, this set relies on too many imperfect accuracy moves, so replacing one of them might not seem like a bad idea in practice.</p> <p>Above all else, this set appreciates having multiple entry hazards on the field. As Hydreigon is prone to causing switches, and most of its checks are grounded, Spikes users are ideal partners. Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory are relatively good Spikes users each with the ability to perform another task for your team, whether it be tanking hits, walling, or spinning. Forretress stands above the rest, since it has incredible defensive synergy with Hydreigon, resisting its Ice-, Dragon-, and Bug-type weaknesses, and is capable of Rapid Spinning.</p> <p>This set is useful for players who want a wallbreaking Dragon-type that takes neutral damage from Stealth Rock and can switch into weak Grass-, Electric-, and Water-type moves. This set is also useful on offensive teams, but it tends to fit better on balanced teams where its disappointing Speed isn't as much of a detriment. Hydreigon helps most Pokemon by virtue of wearing down and defeating most walls, but Pokemon such as Latios especially appreciate this set for its ability to lure most of its checks and beat them down one-on-one. In comparison to the mixed attacker set, this set is actually more dangerous against offensive teams. Whereas offensive teams could easily revenge kill the mixed attacker set using Pokemon such as Terrakion, it's a struggle to actually remove Hydreigon once it's behind a Substitute, and it usually ends up with the opponent losing at least one Pokemon to remove its Substitute. Unfortunately, this set suffers against stall teams as they tend to carry dedicated special walls that can beat this set. Hydreigon will never break through Blissey or Chansey, so running a dedicated counter is helpful. Strong Fighting-types are as always the solution to avoid being walled by pink blobs; running any of Terrakion, Breloom, or Conkeldurr should suffice.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs promotes a different way of playing with Hydreigon, which focuses on a more extreme hit and run playstyle, therefore overriding Hydreigon's standard role of wallbreaking. Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor pretty much steamrolls anything that isn't a dedicated special wall or a Steel-type, and even then most Steel-types take heavy damage from Draco Meteor. Focus Blast is the most important coverage move on this set, and knowing when to use Focus Blast is the key to being effective with it; it lets Hydreigon power its way through most of the Steel-types in OU in addition to OHKOing all variants of Tyranitar and Heatran, as well as 2HKOing Blissey most of the time after Stealth Rock damage. Fire Blast targets Jirachi and hits Ferrothorn even harder, though you should avoid using this move in general because it's very easy for the opponent to capitalize on. Tyranitar, Politoed, Heatran, and Dragon-types can switch in and put your team at a massive disadvantage. Only use Fire Blast when you absolutely need to remove Jirachi or Ferrothorn.</p> <p>U-turn is a useful move to scout its checks and gain momentum, though, on average, Hydreigon is usually better off attacking. Dark Pulse is a fairly strong and consistent STAB move, though it's similar to Fire Blast in that it's too easy for the opponent to abuse; however, Dark Pulse is particularly effective against Reuniclus and Jellicent. This set is easier to use than the other Hydreigon sets, but therein lies the problem; the mixed attacker set is more effective at netting KOs because of its ability to switch moves. Choice Specs is easier to use in general, as you can spam Draco Meteor to get meaningful damage on most of the OU metagame, but don't be tricked into thinking that this is acceptable, because you're better off using the mixed attacker set if you want to simply KO things. If you're going to use the Choice Specs set, it's for its 20% boost in power and lack of recoil in comparison to the mixed attacker set.</p> <p>Giving Hydreigon a Choice Scarf makes it capable of revenge killing faster threats, which is an obvious use it has over the Choice Specs set. On the other hand, Choice Scarf Hydreigon is completely inferior at actually KOing opponents, and it's useless in the face of sturdy Pokemon. It's somewhat of a hybrid set, and is a gimmicky version of Choice Specs that can only KO weakened Pokemon or Pokemon that are weak to Hydreigon's coverage moves, but at the same time Hydreigon is also a gimmicky Choice Scarf user with suboptimal Speed and a spammable STAB move. What makes Choice Scarf Hydreigon so difficult to justify using is that, looking at the set as one whole, cohesive experience, it's sorely lacking and is a definite crutch. However, it does exactly what it's intended to do, and that hasn't stopped a large number of players from using it. Surf is a legitimate option over Fire Blast on rain teams; it's a pseudo-STAB move under the rain that's effective against Heatran, Jirachi, and the rest of the Steel-types, while also maintaining some effectiveness against Tyranitar as well. Earth Power can be used over Focus Blast as a weaker, albeit more consistent, coverage move that targets Tyranitar and grounded Steel-types such as Jirachi and Heatran. You give up at ever being able to defeat Blissey without Focus Blast, however. Superpower might seem like a weird option on a Choice Specs set, but a neutral natured 0 Atk Superpower can 2HKO Blissey and almost always OHKO Tyranitar after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Because Choice Specs Hydreigon is a useful battering ram that can basically be used on any team, it doesn't necessarily need much team support to be of any use. Choice Specs Hydreigon appreciates having entry hazards up since it can turn 3HKOs into 2HKOs and 2HKOs into OHKOs with them. Since Blissey and Chansey are full stops to this set, so carrying appropriate checks can do wonders, such as Keldeo and Breloom. Fortunately, since Chansey is forced to rely on Eviolite, wearing it down with hazards and passive damage is fairly easy; it only needs a little passive damage in order to be 2HKOed by Focus Blast. You can also rely on Stealth Rock and a single layer of Spikes to guarantee the 2HKO.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Taunt allows Hydreigon to stallbreak, limiting the recovery of its common switch-ins such as Chansey, Blissey, bulky Water-types, and more, while also allowing Hydreigon to beat various Pokemon that rely on status to wear down foes, such as Gliscor. Dark Pulse is Hydreigon's main attack, letting it threaten bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types, such as Jellicent, Celebi, Mew, and Reuniclus. Dragon Pulse is another option, as it offers superior neutral coverage and has a higher Base Power, but Hydreigon usually prefers Dark Pulse to threaten the aforementioned Pokemon. Hydreigon's next move allows it to threaten Steel-types. Focus Blast allows Hydreigon to beat Heatran and also nets coverage on opposing Dark-types, while Flamethrower allows it to KO Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Scizor. Finally, Roost offers Hydreigon increased longevity and helps it make use of its good typing and decent bulk.</p> <p>Leftovers is a viable option on Hydreigon, as it increases Hydreigon's longevity while sacrificing some of its offensive presence. In a similar vein, you can opt to use a bulkier spread with more emphasis on HP; however, since Hydreigon primarily fulfills an offensive role with stallbreaking being secondary, it usually appreciates the extra damage output provided by a Life Orb as well as maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed. This investment allows Hydreigon to hit as hard as possible while outspeeding key threats such as Kyurem-B, Nasty Plot Celebi, and Timid Heatran.</p> <p>Earth Power is usable as Hydreigon's coverage move, and it retains most of the coverage of Focus Blast. However, Focus Blast is preferred due to its ability to hit a wider variety of Steel- and Dark-types for heavier damage, especially Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Tyranitar.</p> <p>Heatran is a good partner to Hydreigon because it can check Latios and Latias and provide Toxic and Stealth Rock, helping Hydreigon stall Pokemon out with Taunt. In return, Hydreigon can beat bulky Water-types, Chansey, Blissey, and Gliscor, all of which give Heatran trouble. Like most Hydreigon sets, bulky Starmie is a great partner, handling Keldeo and switching into Fighting- and Ice-type moves aimed at Hydreigon. In return, Hydreigon can remove the Pokemon that prevent Starmie from keeping its side of the field free from hazards, namely, Jellicent and Ferrothorn. Hydreigon can also remove other threats to Starmie such as Tyranitar and Celebi.</p> "

  "Terrakion": {
    "overview": "<p>As part of the new legendary foursome (don't forget PONY, people!), Terrakion boasts a unique type combination and some pretty beastly base stats to take advantage of it offensively. The great type coverage granted by its STAB moves alone essentially allows Terrakion to do whatever it wants with its last two moveslots. Because of these factors, Terrakion can be one of the best stat-boosters in the game, one of the best Choice Band users in the game, or one of the best revenge killers in the game when equipped with a Choice Scarf. With this offensive diversity, Terrakion is one of the best offensive threats in the game that every team should be prepared for, and everyone should consider using.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>I'm sure you've already looked through Terrakion's moveset and thought, \"Whoa it learns Calm Mind!\" Yes, yes it does learn Calm Mind. It's arguably Terrakion's best set; however, for some reason, the Quality Control guys won't let me list it first in this analysis. In a similar (and more serious!) vein, Terrakion also learns Work Up. The only use for it would be to lure Gliscor into a +1 Hidden Power Ice. The problem with that idea is that using Work Up as your opponent switches to Gliscor is a dead giveaway that you're rocking Hidden Power Ice. If you want Terrakion to act as a Gliscor lure, you're much better just pumping a ton of EVs into Special Attack so that it doesn't see it coming until it's already dead. Terrakion can also make use of Protect on some sets, which can be used to scout against Choice-locked Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Scizor; however, in order to use this, it sacrifices an important moveslot for a move that is only useful in a niche situation, and as such Protect is usually inferior to Terrakion's standard options.</p> <p>Terrakion also learns Taunt, which obviously makes a Taunt/Swords Dance set an option. However, most of Terrakion's counters are simply going to attack it straight up, meaning there are very few situations in which Taunt would be anywhere near useful. Maybe against Skarmory I guess? Yeah, that makes sense.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>If there was an award in OU for \"most difficult Pokemon to switch into,\" here's your winner. Slowbro is probably the best check you'll find in OU, although a Stone Edge boosted by a Choice Band or a Swords Dance boost will hit like a truck. Gliscor and Landorus-T are also good checks, though they will be taking a ton from Stone Edge from those sets. Mew, Reuniclus and Jellicent also fall into the similar category. There is light at the end of the tunnel though; Terrakion needs to hit two consecutive Stone Edges to KO any of these Pokemon. Hippowdon can also tank a hit and Slack Off. You may be inclined to use Skarmory as your Terrakion counter, but despite its good Defense, Skarmory is ravaged by a Close Combat from the Choice Band or Swords Dance set, allowing it to only deal with Terrakion that lack Attack boosts.</p> <p>Terrakion can be hard to check because of its great Speed. Scizor and Azumarill are two Choice Band users that can stop any Terrakion set dead in its tracks with their STAB priority attacks. Infernape can also do a good chunk of damage with Mach Punch; Conkeldurr can do the same and can also, at high health, survive a non-boosted Close Combat and go for the OHKO with Drain Punch after Stealth Rock. Latios and Tornadus can outspeed and hit Terrakion hard with Psyshock or Hurricane, respectively. Gengar and Starmie can smash it with Focus Blast and Hydro Pump, while Espeon can hit it hard with Psychic. Gengar deserves a special mention because it can Disable Stone Edge, crippling Terrakion instantly. Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-W and other Terrakion are also fantastic checks.</p> <p>Ironically, Terrakion's best counters litter the lower tiers, with examples being Golurk, Nidoqueen, Claydol, and Tangrowth. If you're feeling desperate, then one of these is your best bet.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Stop me if I'm talking too much about how great Terrakion's offensive typing is, but the Choice Band set truly exemplifies just how fantastic its STAB moves really are. Choice Band Terrakion essentially boils down to, \"Click its appropriate STAB for the situation and watch things take massive amounts of damage.\" Additional factors, such as great Speed, a resistance to Stealth Rock, and solid bulk make Terrakion arguably the best Choice Band user in the OU metagame.</p> <p>Because Terrakion's STAB moves are just so balling, the last two moves in the set serve very limited functions. X-Scissor hits the bulky Psychic-types a bit harder than Stone Edge does, while also having the upside of being 100% accurate. Sacred Sword is a solid option in the fourth moveslot for situations in which you want to use your Fighting-type STAB without being forced to lower Terrakion's defenses. Quick Attack, normally a terrible option on just about everything that learns it, is somewhat viable on Terrakion. Because Terrakion doesn't need a coverage move in that last slot, Quick Attack becomes a solid situational, last-resort move if you need to knock that last 15% off Latios.</p> <p>Earthquake is extremely redundant with Close Combat, but it nails a couple things slightly harder and doesn't lower your defenses. However, because Choice-locked Earthquake without STAB is generally a terrible option, you're often better off with Sacred Sword as your situational move of choice; that or either Double Kick can be favorable aiding against threats like Focus Sash Mamoswine and those behind a Substitute. Rock Slide is also a viable option, as it allows you to take advantage of a more accurate Rock-type STAB that can fish for a flinch if you ever need one.</p> <p>Generally, an Adamant nature is ill-advised on any Terrakion set that doesn't have Rock Polish since it means you will be outpaced by a large number of threats (as well as losing the speed tie with Virizion and Infernape). But on Choice Band Terrakion, the extra power can be very welcome against Pokemon such as Gliscor and Slowbro.</p> <p>The same Pokemon that pair up well with the Double Boosting set also pair well with Choice Band Terrakion. In this case, however, Terrakion is generally best suited as the Pokemon that does the damage necessary to open holes in the opponent's team. The sheer damage that even bulkier Pokemon like Gliscor take from Terrakion's STAB moves make it nearly impossible for those defensive Pokemon to stay around long enough to wall the subsequent Landorus-T.</p> "

        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Due to the popularity of Terrakion's Choice sets, many of its checks and counters often rely on it being locked into one move. With this set, Terrakion is able defeat these Pokemon by using either its STAB attacks or coverage moves. Close Combat and Stone Edge function as Terrakion's bread-and-butter STAB moves, getting nearly unresisted coverage in the OU tier. Hidden Power Ice is a key coverage move in Terrakion's arsenal, 2HKOing its two primary counters, Landorus-T and Gliscor, as well as OHKOing a weakened Dragonite or Salamence without risking a miss with Stone Edge. Earthquake is primarily used to hit Toxicroak, Tentacruel, and Jirachi for super effective damage. However, Protect allows Terrakion to scout against revenge killers, most notably Scizor and Breloom.</p> <p>X-Scissor is Terrakion's most powerful attack against Psychic-types such as Latias, Latios, and Celebi. However, a super effective X-Scissor is only slightly more powerful than a STAB Stone Edge, and oftentimes, the Pokemon that Terrakion would want to hit with X-Scissor are faster and carry a super effective attack, reducing X-Scissor's overall utility. Despite its low Base Power, Quick Attack is an option to defeat extremely weakened Pokemon that are either faster or carry a super effective priority move. Substitute is an option over either Earthquake or Protect, as it allows Terrakion to capitalize on the switches it forces and defeat faster Pokemon by using either its STAB attacks or Hidden Power Ice. However, Substitute in tandem with Life Orb recoil will wear down Terrakion relatively quickly, making it a mediocre option in comparison to Protect. Terrakion can also utilize an Expert Belt to bluff a choice item and function as an even better lure for Landorus-T and Gliscor; However, the extra power boost that Life Orb provides is generally more useful.</p> <p>Because this set lacks the power of Terrakion's Choice Band set, entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Skarmory and Forretress is recommended. Due to Terrakion's ability to lure and defeat Gliscor and Landorus-T, Dragon Dance Dragonite, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Swords Dance Lucario are exceptional partners. Due to Terrakion's weakness to common priority, such as Bullet Punch and Mach Punch from Scizor and Breloom, respectively, Pokemon that can defeat these priority users, such as Thundurus-T, Zapdos, and Volcarona are also excellent partners. Keldeo is another excellent partner, as Terrakion is able to defeat nearly every one of Keldeo's counters, allowing the pony to sweep later in the game.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Stealth Rock",
        "description": "<p>While other Terrakion sets are more focused towards sweeping and punching holes, this set focuses more on supporting its teammates by setting up Stealth Rock. Terrakion makes for an excellent user of Stealth Rock due to the many switches it forces with its heralded STAB moves. This Terrakion set is best used in the lead position, as it can get up Stealth Rock right off the bat and threatens common weather inducing and entry hazard-setting leads. With Taunt, it can also stop most setup sweepers that might choose to lead in their tracks. Another reason why Terrakion is an excellent user of Stealth Rock is that it can beat a common spinner—Forretress—as well as Espeon and Xatu which reflect Stealth Rock and Taunt. Very few Stealth Rock users can beat Espeon and Xatu, so this is a major advantage over other users. In addition, Terrakion is pretty much the only Stealth Rock user not named Tyranitar that is legitimately threatening to sun teams and their most common methods of preventing Stealth Rock from being set up, namely Forretress and Xatu. Stone Edge and Close Combat hit most of a sun team for heavy damage and Stealth Rock is a pain for Fire-types such as Volcarona, Victini, and Ninetales on said teams. Terrakion is also not setup bait for opposing entry hazard setters, unlike Ferrothorn and Forretress. Swords Dance can be used over Taunt to bluff one of the more traditional Terrakion sets and to provide immediate pressure in the lead position and later in the game after Stealth Rock has already been set up. As a final note, Stealth Rock Terrakion is often unexpected, which gives it more opportunity to set it up.</p> <p>The EVs are fairly obvious, with maximum investment in both Attack and Speed for Terrakion to function as efficiently as possible. A Jolly nature is used to best utilize Terrakion's high Speed stat, but an Adamant nature is an option, allowing Terrakion to always OHKO standard Breloom. However, this would cause Terrakion to be slower than other Terrakion, Keldeo, and other Pokemon with 95 base Speed or above that choose to run positive natures, as well as making it impossible to test whether opposing Salamence are using a Choice Scarf or not with Terrakion's Focus Sash, but it is often worth the trade-off should one desire Terrakion to hit harder. Speaking of Focus Sash, it guarantees the setup of Stealth Rock in the lead position and allows Terrakion to stay in and go for the KO on opposing Starmie and Jolteon, among other Pokemon that outspeed it.</p> <p>Where other move options are concerned, there are two that can boost Terrakion's effectiveness in certain situations. Substitute can be used to allow Terrakion to beat every common spinner, including Forretress, Starmie, and Tentacruel. In that case, a Stone Plate may be used to boost the power of Stone Edge or a Fist Plate to boost the power of Close Combat due to the fact that Substitute makes Focus Sash unusable. However, Focus Sash already does this and more, so Substitute is very niche and usually less effective than Focus Sash + Taunt. X-Scissor is an option to OHKO Celebi, but its use would be solely for that purpose and so is not recommended unless one's team has trouble with Celebi. Lastly, a Rock Gem can be used to OHKO bulky Starmie and 2HKO standard Tentacruel, but Focus Sash again has a myriad of uses that make Rock Gem inferior.</p> <p>In the realm of support, there is nothing mandatory as Terrakion does very well as a standalone Pokemon. However, there are many optional forms of support that are beneficial to Terrakion. A spinblocker, such as Gengar, Jellicent, or Sableye, is helpful because Terrakion will have trouble setting up Stealth Rock multiple times due to its reliance on Focus Sash. Toxic Spikes support may be helpful if one wants Terrakion to beat bulky Water-types, with the two best users being Tentacruel and Forretress. There are many Pokemon that partner well with Terrakion thanks to its overwhelming power and utility. Since this Terrakion is a nightmare for sun teams, Tyranitar loves it as a partner, freeing up a moveslot for another coverage move and in return providing a 50% boost to Terrakion's Special Defense. Dragonite boasts excellent defensive synergy with Terrakion and enjoys Stealth Rock not being set up as well as having Ferrothorn removed. Latias is in the same boat as Dragonite and always beats Starmie, a major threat to Terrakion if its Focus Sash is already broken. Politoed enjoys the fact that Terrakion can remove its two most common rival weather inducers, Tyranitar and Ninetales, both of which hinder Politoed and its teammates. Lastly, it should be mentioned that every team pretty much requires Stealth Rock in one way or another, and Terrakion is an amazing user of it.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Besides Gliscor, Slowbro, Landorus-T, and a few obscure counters that struggle to reach even 2% usage in OU, the only way to deal with Terrakion is through status or revenge killing. Now, imagine if it had a way to get around status users and revenge killers--that would be a sight to behold wouldn't it? If this behemoth managed to set up, the opponent would surely be stuck between a rock and a hard place. Well, why are you still imagining? Substitute + Swords Dance Terrakion does just that! With Substitute, the terracotta warrior can now block those ever so annoying Thunder Waves, Will-O-Wisps, and Toxics. Furthermore, Substitute acts as a buffer against annoying revenge killers, such as Alakazam and Starmie, who now must waste a turn breaking the Substitute, and are destroyed by a powerful STAB move in return. Most importantly, though, Terrakion is cushioned from priority moves, such as Scizor's Bullet Punch, and with its newly found fly swatter, can crush the red bug in cold blood.</p> <p>While Substitute is certainly the distinguishing move on this set, it is important to note that without Terrakion's fantastic stats, movepool, and offensive typing, this set wouldn't be nearly as effective. Swords Dance skyrockets Terrakion's Attack to terrifying levels. Even Gliscor and Slowbro must think twice about coming in, because if they are damaged prior to the encounter, a +2 Stone Edge can still break through. Its Fighting- and Rock-type STAB combination provides fantastic coverage, resisted only by a select few lower-tier Pokemon. Close Combat is Arceus's gift to Fighting-types; backed by Terrakion's immense power, it is one of the most fearsome moves in the metagame. Stone Edge rounds off this brute's set, allowing it to barbarically tear apart opposing teams.</p> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment further oil this killing machine. A Jolly nature is preferred to Speed-tie with opposing base 108 Pokemon; with Substitute protecting Terrakion from potential revenge killers, you may fall to temptation and use an Adamant nature, but keep in mind that the longer you can preserve that Substitute, the more time you have to dismember your opponent's Pokemon. The extra power would certainly make Terrakion an even more formidable attacker, but being outsped by base 100 Pokemon is a real turn off. 4 Defense EVs rather than 4 HP EVs seems trivial at first, but 4 HP EVs give Terrakion 324 HP, which only allows it to make three Substitutes. You never know when a fourth Substitute can come in handy.</p> <p>Rock Gem is the primary item, as it allows a boosted Terrakion to OHKO Gliscor with Stone Edge, and also allows you to feign a Choice item early on. Alternatively, a Life Orb can be used to bluff a Double Dancer set, although Substitute and Life Orb recoil could build up very quickly. If you use Substitute conservatively though, this set will still serve you well. Leftovers can be used, although the element of surprise is key for this set, and Leftovers is a dead giveaway that you're running Substitute. Salac Berry trades Speed for power, giving Terrakion a +1 boost if it ever gets low on health. You can use this to your advantage by repeatedly using Substitute, though you have to make sure opposing Breloom, Lucario, and Scizor are removed first. In any case, Terrakion is so powerful that it could probably pull its weight even without an item, so don't fret too much about the choice of item.</p> <p>This set is incredibly self-sufficient, and doesn't need much in terms of support. However, it would be wise to pair it with another powerful physical attacker, such as Landorus-T or Lucario, to form a one-two punch. Wish support can come in handy, especially if using Life Orb, as Terrakion will often wear itself out with Substitute. Chansey and Blissey are ideal candidates, as they can also check troublesome Psychic-types, such as Starmie and Alakazam. Do keep in mind that Terrakion remains helpless against the likes of Scizor when not behind a Substitute, so Magnezone can be used to dismantle it. Bulky Psychic-types, such as Slowbro and Reuniclus, are swiftly eliminated by Scizor and Tyranitar. Tyranitar also happens to summon permanent Sandstorm, which gives Terrakion a nice 50% Special Defense boost. Finally, the only Pokemon that can put a full stop to this set are obscure threats, such as Golurk, Nidoqueen, and Claydol. As laughable as these Pokemon may seem, it would be a catastrophe if your Terrakion sweep fell short because of them. It would be wise to carry a powerful Water-type, such as Gyarados, Starmie, or Rotom-W, to clear the ruffian's path.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Double Dancer",
        "description": "<p>As mentioned in the Overview, Terrakion has amazing offensive typing, and combined with its bulk, has the freedom to do what very few other Pokemon in the game are able to: run a double boosting set. This gives Terrakion the versatility to be a fantastic weapon against both offensive and defensive teams. Against offensive teams, Rock Polish allows Terrakion to use its great STAB moves and the boost from Life Orb to run through them. Against slower, defensive teams, Terrakion can amplify its raw power with a Swords Dance, since it is unlikely to require the Speed boost. Also, it isn't that uncommon to find yourself in a situation where you are able to boost both Speed and Attack.</p> <p>Air Balloon versus Life Orb is the biggest question you have to ask yourself when using Double Boosting Terrakion. Air Balloon is extremely useful for setting up in those frequent situations where you need to avoid an Earthquake. The most obvious scenario is getting an extra boost against Gliscor. Life Orb, on the other hand, adds to Terrakion's raw power, allowing it to nail a number of KOs that it normally wouldn't get. It really comes down to personal preference and which item is best suited for your team. Choose wisely!</p> <p>Whether to choose Adamant or Jolly is another difficult choice. Jolly is preferred for the ability to outpace positive base 100 Speed Pokemon before a Rock Polish boost, and to tie other base 108s, most notably Virizion, Infernape, and obviously other Terrakion. The power boost from an Adamant nature is very welcome, however, so if you're fine losing the jump on a few notable Pokemon, feel free to go with that. You could also run a slightly bulkier spread with Leftovers if that floats your boat. However, the standard 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe spread generally works best.</p> <p>With an Adamant nature, Terrakion makes great use of the item Rock Gem, bestowing Stone Edge the extra 50% power buff to overcome even the most durable physical walls. To illustrate, after a Swords Dance, a Rock Gem-boosted Stone Edge scores an OHKO on Gliscor most of the time without Stealth Rock, as well as gaining a good chance to cleanly score an OHKO on Slowbro and Tangrowth after Stealth Rock. However, Rock Gem is only one-use, so there is a real chance that Terrakion would use up its Gem to revenge kill a death fodder rather than for wallbreaking. Rock Gem also does not help against Hippowdon, the premier physical tank of OU. Air Balloon is a more useful one-time item in this regard, and Life Orb provides a more consistent power boost than Rock Gem. Terrakion also must run Adamant nature to net the amazing kills on Gliscor, Tangrowth, and Slowbro, and this speed drop undoubtedly hampers its sweep.</p> <p>Terrakion already has fantastic coverage with its two STAB moves, but you can always drop one of the boosting moves for a coverage move, the best option being X-Scissor. X-Scissor gives you a slightly stronger, 100% accurate move against a few of the Psychic-types that can slow Terrakion down a bit (especially Claydol). Earthquake is generally a terrible option, as its coverage is extremely redundant with Close Combat, so don't run that on this set.</p> <p>Terrakion can function as either a Pokemon that opens holes for the rest of your team, or one that takes advantage of the holes opened by other threatening sweepers. Generally, the best sweepers to pair with Terrakion are those that fare well in sand. Landorus-T is the most prominent sweeper that comes to mind. Landorus-T can stick Hidden Power Ice on its set to take out Gliscor or run Swords Dance and Life Orb to absolutely eviscerate Slowbro or Reuniclus. Terrakion itself can muscle its way through Gliscor, which allows Landorus-T to have a field day. Because Terrakion shares a number of weaknesses with either two of those sweepers, you should also consider pairing Terrakion with some sweepers that offer nice resistance-pairing. Choices include Gyarados, which resists Fighting-, Water-, Steel-, and is immune to Ground-type attacks; or Latios, which also provides several compatible resistances while potentially baiting Dark-type attacks.</p> "

Close Combat and Stone Edge are your two powerful STAB moves and X-Scissor covers bulky Psychic-types. The fourth slot is, once again, essentially useless, so run whatever you feel like.

Flying is a very good offensive type with few Pokemon that resist it in OU, and Tornadus makes excellent use of it with STAB Hurricane, base 125 Special Attack, and base 111 Speed. Most Steel-, Rock-, and Electric-types looking to tank a Hurricane can get promptly smashed by Focus Blast or Superpower, which means that walling Tornadus is not an easy feat. Furthermore, Tornadus has U-turn, a staple on special attacking sets, which lets it build up damage on its few counters and keep momentum. Tornadus can also use a physical set with Acrobatics, adding a bit to its versatility. To top it off, non-Choiced sets can put Prankster to use, which gives Tornadus many utility options, such as priority Tailwind and Rain Dance, letting it act as a crutch for its team or just take advantage of those moves by itself.</p> <p>Despite the positive qualities of Tornadus, it has flaws that should be taken into account. A Stealth Rock weakness and general frailty are Tornadus's biggest problems, and prevent it from coming in as much as it would like, while also necessitating the use of a spinner. Due to its frailty, it can also be easily revenge killed with faster Pokemon or priority. Finally, while Tornadus has only a few counters in OU, some of them are really popular, such as Jirachi and Rotom-W, which means that Tornadus will often fail to break past defensive cores by itself and therefore requires even further support to function.</p> <p>So, all in all, Tornadus is very good at its job—wallbreaking and cleaning up—but it needs a lot of support to function, making it a high maintenance Pokemon that cannot be slapped on any team.</p> ",

However, unlike most other Choice Scarf users, Tornadus has a nasty Stealth Rock weakness, lacks power, and has trouble switching into anything even remotely offensive because of its frailty. A pure support set with Rain Dance and Damp Rock can be used on dedicated Rain Dance teams to allow Swift Swim Pokemon to wreck havoc. Torment can be used on any non-Choiced set to mess with Choice item users, as after they land a hit or KO something Tornadus can force them to use Struggle with priority Torment. When running this move it is advised to use Protect or Substitute alongside it to better deal with Choice item users. Hidden Power Ice is an option to hit Zapdos, Thundurus-T, and Dragonite harder than any other move, while Grass Knot deals with Hippowdon without the need to gamble on Hurricane's 70% accuracy in sand and hits Gastrodon harder than anything else.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Most bulky Steel-types that resist Hurricane and are neutral to Fighting are good counters. Jirachi, Metagross, and Bronzong are all such Pokemon, with Jirachi being the best due to its reliable recovery. Specially defensive variants of Rotom-W and Zapdos are good short-term counters but may fail to wall Tornadus multiple times, the first due to lack of reliable recovery, and the latter because of its weakness to Stealth Rock and Tornadus's access to U-turn. Chansey and Blissey wall the Choice Specs set, but they both detest Superpower from the second set, which 2HKOes the former with Life Orb and the latter without it, and they outright lose to the third set. Specially defensive Heatran and any Tyranitar are good checks to the Choice Specs set, as they can easily tank multiple Hurricanes but must be careful to not get hit by Focus Blast, which 2HKOes the former and OHKOes the latter; Tyranitar has the added benefit of trapping Tornadus with Pursuit. Jolteon and Choice Scarf Thundurus-T can take a hit from Tornadus, outspeed, and OHKO it, so they can be used as one-time checks. Any faster Pokemon and priority users can usually OHKO Tornadus after Stealth Rock, except for weak Pokemon, such as defensive Starmie. Finally, taking away rain makes Tornadus much more manageable, as Hurricane's accuracy drops to 50% or 70% depeding on the weather, making it a very risky move to use.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set should always be used on rain teams, where Tornadus becomes a fearsome attacker and takes care of several Pokemon that trouble rain teams in general, such as Celebi and Amoonguss. Hurricane has perfect accuracy under rain and decimates everything that doesn't resist it not named Chansey or Blissey. Focus Blast takes care of some Pokemon that don't mind Hurricane, such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Magnezone, and 2HKOes 252 HP Jirachi after Stealth Rock most of the time. U-turn racks up entry hazard damage on Tornadus's counters and helps deal with Jirachi, Heatran, and Tyranitar. Air Slash is used to have a reliable STAB outside of rain, while Heat Wave almost OHKOes Ferrothorn in rain and 2HKOes Jirachi outside of rain.</p> <p>Defiant is used so that in the case that a stat drop occurs to Tornadus (via Intimidate mainly) it can at least get a powered up U-turn, as Prankster is completely useless on this set. Hidden Power Ground can be used to OHKO offensive Heatran, OHKO 248/252+ Heatran 43.75% of the time after Stealth Rock, and do a minimum of 40% damage to specially defensive Jirachi.</p> <p>Politoed is a mandatory partner in order for Tornadus to spam Hurricane. Rapid Spin support is also essential, so Starmie and Tentacruel both make good teammates; furthermore, both like to be in rain, where they can beat every spinblocker. Both spinners can also deal with Heatran and Bronzong, Pokemon that check or counter Tornadus; keep in mind that Tentacruel is the best spinner for Tornadus due to its ability to simultaneously be resilient and get past any spinblocker, while Starmie has to choose one of those. Ferrothorn can use specially defensive Jirachi, Chansey, and Blissey as setup bait, handles the Ice, Electric, Water, and Rock attacks aimed at Tornadus, and can lay both Spikes and Stealth Rock, helping Tornadus do its job better. Garchomp deals with any Pokemon that can keep Tornadus in check except for Bronzong, and can lay Stealth Rock as well. Because Tornadus fears pretty much every Pokemon faster than it, a fast revenge killer pairs well with Tornadus. Choice Scarf Keldeo is the best revenge killer for rain teams and can clean up easily after Tornadus has softened the opposition.</p> "

        "name": "Prankster",
        "description": "<p>While this set still relies on Hurricane's excellent power and neutral coverage to do damage, the item options allow Tornadus to change moves, unlike the first set, and thus better take advantage of Prankster and the interesting uses it has. As usual, the first few turns that Tornadus gets in should be used to spam Hurricane, which still hits very hard even without the Choice Specs boost, unless there are Pokemon that can take multiple Hurricanes. Focus Blast nails many of the Pokemon that resist Hurricane, such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Magnezone, and provides excellent neutral coverage. On the other hand, Superpower gives the same coverage as Focus Blast, but with Life Orb has the benefit of 2HKOing Blissey, 2HKOing Chansey after Stealth Rock 38.67% of the time, and cleanly OHKOing 252 HP Tyranitar, as well as having perfect accuracy. Keep in mind that Superpower should only be used with Life Orb, as otherwise it is too weak to do anything that Focus Blast can't already. U-turn racks up damage on Tornadus's checks and counters, especially with the help of entry hazards, and is the best move to use when hard counters to Tornadus are on the opposing team, such as Jirachi, Rotom-W, or Bronzong. Taunt can be used over U-turn and is useful for shutting down the recovery of walls, enabling Tornadus to weaken or beat some of its best checks, namely specially defensive Skarmory and Chansey. Taunt is also useful for preventing setup from Pokemon such as Bronzong, Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi, and Agility Thundurus-T, which could otherwise turn Tornadus into a liability.</p> <p>For the last slot there are three choices. Tailwind is the best option overall, as it gives to the whole team a +2 Speed boost for three turns and has priority thanks to Prankster, meaning that no matter how fast a Pokemon gets, Tornadus can sacrifice itself in order to set up a Tailwind and allow its teammates to revenge kill the dangerous sweeper. Tailwind can even let Tornadus and its teammates get a last-minute sweep against normally faster Pokemon, and turns hard hitting Pokemon such as Choice Band Kyurem-B and Choice Specs Keldeo into absolute beasts for two turns. Rain Dance allows Tornadus to better combat sand and sun teams and alleviates the constant pressure on Politoed to keep rain up; Rain Dance can also act as a last resort option against Chlorophyll and Sand Rush sweepers in their preferred weather, allowing the rest of Tornadus's team to deal with them. Finally, Substitute protects Tornadus from status, priority, and revenge killers and can scout for Choice-locked attacks, even those with priority (Choice Band Scizor). Substitute should always be used with Leftovers, as otherwise Tornadus dies too fast.</p> <p>Each item pairs well with certain moves. Sharp Beak is best used with Focus Blast and Superpower should always be used with Life Orb, as the Life Orb boost does not allow Focus Blast to OHKO or 2HKO anything that it couldn't before, making the recoil unneeded, while Superpower is too weak without Life Orb to do any real damage. As with Leftovers, it should only be used when running Substitute, for reasons already explained. As for natures, Timid is the best option unless running Superpower, where Naive becomes the most beneficial.</p> <p>Politoed is once again a partner that Tornadus can't live without. The same goes for Rapid Spin support, so Tentacruel and Starmie are the best friends of Tornadus. Starmie fits better on offensive teams which appreciate the power that Starmie brings to the table while Tentacruel is best used in balanced and defensive teams due to its great longevity. Entry hazard support is also a good idea to allow Tornadus to wear down its counters faster with U-turn and also allow it to get a bunch of OHKOs and 2HKOs. Ferrothorn, Celebi, and Garchomp can set up Stealth Rock (and Spikes in Ferrothorn's case) and switch into many of the Pokemon that scare Tornadus out, such as Keldeo, Thundurus-T, Jolteon, Jirachi, and Rotom-W. Toxic Spikes greatly aid sets with Substitute to get past Chansey and Blissey, and can be provided by Tentacruel. Lastly, a hard hitting partner to take advantage of Tailwind is a good idea. Choice Specs Keldeo and Choice Band Garchomp both have good defensive synergy with Tornadus and are very difficult to wall.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Acrobatics",
        "description": "<p>Tornadus has a good base 115 Attack and a strong physical STAB in Acrobatics, which allow it to be used outside of rain with a physical set. Flying Gem-boosted Acroabatics is almost as powerful as Terrakion's Life Orb Close Combat, OHKOing many offensive Pokemon with ease. Furthermore, Acrobatics transforms Tornadus into a very good Chansey and Blissey lure, as the first is 2HKOed by a combination of Flying Gem Acrobatics and Superpower after Stealth Rock while the latter is easily 2HKOed by any attacking move of Tornadus. Superpower provides good neutral coverage with Acrobatics and lets Tornadus OHKO any Tyranitar, 2HKO 248/0 Heatran after Stealth Rock, and deal with Chansey and Blissey by the ways already mentioned. Bulk Up makes Tornadus harder to revenge kill with priority and physical Choice Scarf users and makes Tornadus harder to wall, giving it some much-needed utility against balanced and stall teams. On the other hand, Taunt provides a way to prevent setup of any kind while also allowing Tornadus to weaken or get past certain Pokemon that rely on recovery to deal with it, such as Hippowdon and Skarmory. In the last slot, Tailwind is an excellent option that benefits from Prankster and makes Tornadus a useful crutch for its team under dangerous situations, allowing your team to deal with any speedy sweeper that can get past your team's defense; it can also allow Tornadus to do some late-game cleaning against very weakened offensive teams. Bulk Up is mentioned after Tailwind because it is a viable option if Tornadus has opted for Taunt in the third slot. Taunt + Bulk Up turns Tornadus into a potent stallbreaker that can get past defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Hippowdon much more reliably than with Taunt alone.</p> <p>Heat Wave is an excellent choice in the third or fourth slot to lure and beat many Steel-types that feel confident switching in after Acrobatics has been revealed. Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Forretress are all 2HKOed after Stealth Rock by any combination of Tornadus's moves that involves Heat Wave, while even 252 HP Jirachi can be 2HKOed by Heat Wave with Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. U-turn can be used in the last two slots for better switch initiative and is useful on teams that use a lot of entry hazards to rack up damage on Tornadus's counters. Substitute offers status protection, shields Tornadus from priority and revenge killers, and allows Tornadus to scout Choice-locked moves and stall for Life Orb damage; be careful, as Substitute and Stealth Rock damage can add up very fast, and avoid using this move when Tornadus's counters are still alive. Brick Break should only be used on sets that use Bulk Up, as it still gives Tornadus much-needed Fighting coverage but doesn't put to waste Bulk Up's hard-earned boosts. However, Brick Break's power is quite low and fails to do any significant damage even to Pokemon weak to it without a boost, so only use it if you plan on using Tornadus as a boosting sweeper.</p> <p>The best teammates for this set are hard hitters that can take advantage of Tailwind and outspeed most of the metagame, as well as Pokemon that benefit from the weakening or elimination of Pokemon that Tornadus lures. Choice Band Garchomp, Choice Band Terrakion, Life Orb Keldeo, and Life Orb Starmie are all powerful Pokemon that enjoy not having to worry about Blissey, Chansey, Hippowdon, and Skarmory, and can put the two turns that Tailwind lasts to great use. Teammates to weaken Steel-types that resist Acrobatics, mainly Jirachi, Skarmory, and Bronzong, are very helpful. Magnezone can trap and KO all of them, Fire Blast Garchomp can lure and weaken them, and Swords Dance Haxorus can just muscle past them. Finally, Rapid Spin support is nice to have but not mandatory, as Tornadus is not meant to come in multiple times or take many hits anyway. Starmie is the best option for offensive teams.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>With insanely high Special Attack, important Ground and Electric immunities, powerful attacks in Thunder, Focus Blast, and Grass Knot, and good utility moves in Agility, Nasty Plot, and U-turn, Thundurus-T finds itself as one of the best assets for an offensive team. Its flaws are its mediocre Speed stat for an offensive Pokemon, reliance on inaccurate moves, and need for Rapid Spin support to relieve its Stealth Rock weakness.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A double dance set with Nasty Plot + Agility is viable, but it's difficult to get both boosts without a dedicated team to support it. A Nasty Plot + 3 Attacks set turns Thundurus-T into a fearsome balance breaker; however, it needs dedicated team support, since its mediocre bulk and Speed make it an easy target for revenge killers. Knock Off can be used alongside Substitute or Protect to help Thundurus-T's teammates by crippling defensive Pokemon, but Thundurus-T normally does this by just using a more powerful move. Volt Switch is a possible move in a four attacks set, but Thundurus-T normally prefers the coverage of Focus Blast + Grass Knot. Similarly, U-turn can be used to act as an offensive pivot and to heavily damage Celebi, but it forces Thundurus-T to lose some bulk by running a Hasty nature, or it risks not doing enough damage to defensive Celebi. Superpower can be used in a mixed set to have a perfect accuracy Fighting-type move that also threatens Chansey and Blissey, but the Defense drop alongside a Hasty nature makes Thundurus-T very weak to Pursuit. A Choice Scarf set can have interesting surprise effects, since almost all players expect Leftovers or a slower set from Thundurus-T, and it still is powerful enough to break through defensive cores. However, once the surprise factor fades away, it becomes a mediocre Pokemon because of the Stealth Rock weakness. Ice Gem can be used to OHKO opposing Thundurus-T and heavily damage Latios, but it doesn't have many more important targets. Similarly, Expert Belt can be used to improve Thundurus-T's damage output, but being sand- and Stealth Rock-weak reduces a lot of its utility during the game. Yache Berry and Lum Berry improve Thundurus-T's utility in very specific matchups, but this is generally worse than just holding Leftovers. Finally, Salac Berry and Petaya Berry can be used alongside Substitute + Nasty Plot or Substitute + Agility, respectively, to drastically improve Thundurus-T's sweeping potential, but being sand-weak makes this a fringe strategy.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Weather Inducers: Tyranitar can take at least one Focus Blast if using Chople Berry, or it can surprise KO Thundurus-T with Stone Edge if using a Choice Scarf set. Tyranitar also sets up sand, making it more difficult for Thundurus-T to wallbreak with shaky Thunder accuracy and effectively removing its Leftovers recovery. Hippowdon can also set up sand and only fears Grass Knot if using a specially defensive set, but it needs to be wary of a 2HKO from Hidden Power Ice if using a physically defensive set. Ninetales sets up sun, drastically dropping Thunder's accuracy and supporting teammates like Cresselia, which shrugs off even neutral Electric-type hits because of its massive bulk. Abomasnow sets up hail and can threaten to finish off a weakened Thundurus-T with Ice Shard, but it has mediocre defenses and can't switch directly into Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Specially defensive Celebi takes little damage from Hidden Power Ice, heals away the damage with Recover, and can use Thundurus-T to set up Stealth Rock, Nasty Plot, or Swords Dance. Amoonguss can pivot around Thunder and Focus Blast and play mind games with Sludge Bomb + Stun Spore, but it doesn't like to take Hidden Power Ice, especially if it got damaged by entry hazards. Ferrothorn can check Thundurus-T sets that don't have Focus Blast and can break Thundurus-T's Substitute with Gyro Ball.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Gastrodon can wall Thundurus-T with Recover, but must fear an OHKO from Grass Knot. Seismitoad similarly checks Thundurus-T, but it needs to be played more carefully, since it doesn't have reliable recovery. Excadrill can be used to pivot around Thunder and Hidden Power Ice, and it can clear entry hazards or break Thundurus-T's Substitute with Sand Force-boosted Iron Head before being KOed by Focus Blast if using a Jolly nature. Mamoswine can't directly switch into any move outside of Thunder or Hidden Power Ice, but it can be used to finish off a weakened Thundurus-T with Ice Shard. Mamoswine can also safely set up Substitute on Thundurus-T variants without Focus Blast or Grass Knot.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Latios can switch into any move Thundurus-T can use at least once, scare it away with Draco Meteor or Dragon Pulse, and heal with Recover, but it needs to fear Thunder paralysis. Similarly, Latias can take every move Thundurus-T uses and heal away the damage with Recover, but it further takes little damage from Hidden Power Ice, can set up Calm Mind, and can shrug off Thunder paralysis with Refresh. Kyurem-B and Kyurem can take one Focus Blast and immediately KO Thundurus-T with Outrage and Ice Beam, respectively. Hydreigon outspeeds any Thundurus-T set that doesn't use a Timid nature and threatens to KO it with item-boosted Draco Meteor, but it needs to be wary of Focus Blast. Garchomp and Dragonite fear Hidden Power Ice if they are not using a Yache Berry, but Garchomp outspeeds Thundurus-T and can be used to revenge kill it, while Dragonite can finish off a weakened Thundurus-T with Extreme Speed or set up Dragon Dance if Multiscale is intact. However, Dragonite needs to be wary of Thunder paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Fast Offensive Pokemon: Terrakion outspeeds Thundurus-T and threatens an immediate OHKO with Stone Edge, but it can only switch into Hidden Power Ice, since it fears Thunder paralysis or a KO from Focus Blast. Keldeo can KO any Thundurus-T variant in rain that isn't behind Substitute, but it can't switch into an Electric-type move. Alakazam can't switch directly into Thundurus-T but can be used to finish it off once it's weakened. Alakazam can also use Encore to force Thundurus-T into an undesired move so a teammate can finish it off or capitalize on it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey: Chansey and Blissey take virtually nothing from any move that Thundurus-T has and can retaliate with Toxic or Seismic Toss. However, they must watch out for Nasty Plot sets and the rare Knock Off and Superpower.</p> ",

Thunder is the best offensive option, as Thundurus-T should be paired with rain, and its 30% paralysis chance is a potential death sentence for offensive checks like Latios and Alakazam, but Thunderbolt can be safely used even outside of rain. Hidden Power Ice forms BoltBeam coverage and OHKOes Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. It also damages Latios, Breloom, Amoonguss, and Celebi and 2HKOes Dragonite and opposing Thundurus-T. Focus Blast is the preferred move in the last moveslot to pressure Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Kyurem-B, but Agility lets Thundurus-T be a late-game cleaner instead of a wallbreaker. Nasty Plot can be used to turn Thundurus-T into the best balance breaker of the tier, allowing it to mow down natural checks like Celebi and Gastrodon, but this removes some of its offensive pressure versus teams with fast and hard-hitting Pokemon like Alakazam and Terrakion.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>104 HP EVs alongside 144 Defense EVs make sure that Ferrothorn's Power Whip and specially defensive Jirachi's Body Slam never break Thundurus-T's Substitute in one hit. 4 Special Defense EVs make unboosted Latios's Draco Meteor never OHKO Thundurus-T. 208 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Adamant Kyurem-B. Leftovers mitigates damage taken from sand, Stealth Rock, and Substitute usage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Play aggressively with double switches to bring Thundurus-T in front of a Pokemon it scares away like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Excadrill, or Power Whip Ferrothorn so it can safely set up Substitute. If using Focus Blast, bring in Thundurus-T as soon as possible to maximize its function as a wallbreaker, since there are almost no Pokemon that can stomach BoltBeam + Fighting-type coverage. If using Agility, try to keep Thundurus-T healthy during the match to have a better sweep chance in the endgame. Use every possible opportunity to get chip damage on the opposing team, as the lack of Focus Blast makes the task of beating Pokemon like Excadrill, Ferrothorn, Mamoswine, and Tyranitar much more difficult.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Politoed is Thundurus-T's best partner, since it sets up rain to give Thunder perfect accuracy. Politoed also offers Encore support to allow free Substitutes. Thundurus-T loves entry hazard support to amplify its role as wallbreaker or cleaner, so Ferrothorn, which can use both Stealth Rock and Spikes, is an amazing partner. Ferrothorn also provides Knock Off support to help with Thundurus-T's wallbreaking. Tentacruel and Excadrill provide Rapid Spin support, and Tentacruel also helps with Thundurus-T's Ice-type weakness and can take rain-boosted Water-type hits. Offensively, Choice Specs or Choice Scarf Latios and Keldeo take advantage of Thundurus-T's wallbreaking capacities to finish off weakened teams. Dragonite and Mamoswine are also very strong offensive partners that can help break through defensive cores with Choice Band sets, revenge kill setup sweepers with priority moves, or finish off weakened teams with their Substitute sets. Jirachi can offer Stealth Rock and Wish support, and it can paralyze Thundurus-T checks with Body Slam while being an answer to Latias and Latios. Latias, similarly to Latios, can capitalize on Thundurus-T to finish off opponents with a Choice Scarf set, or it can directly support Thundurus-T with Thunder Wave or Healing Wish. Celebi forms a rare but successful core, since it can remove Electric-immune Pokemon like Gastrodon and Seismitoad while supporting Thundurus-T with Stealth Rock or Nasty Plot + Baton Pass. Mew is not a common sight in the tier, but it can also support Thundurus-T in hyper offense structures with dual screens or Baton Pass sets.</p> "

Thunder is the best option in rain, but Thunderbolt is the ideal move if using this set on a sand or weatherless team. Hidden Power Ice gives BoltBeam coverage and KOes Electric-immune Pokemon like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and opposing Thundurus-T. The last move is team dependent; Focus Blast defeats Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Kyurem-B, and Kyurem, while Grass Knot should be used if Gastrodon, Seismitoad, or Hippowdon is problematic. Both options deal with Tyranitar and Mamoswine.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>24 HP EVs optimize Leftovers recovery from residual damage, and, with 104 Special Defense EVs, let Thundurus-T survive powerful special hits like Draco Meteor from non-Choice Specs Latios, rain-boosted Surf from Choice Specs Latios, and Hidden Power Ice from opposing Thundurus-T after Stealth Rock. 152 Speed EVs let it outspeed Adamant Excadrill to OHKO it with Focus Blast before it can use Rapid Spin. Leftovers negates sand damage so Thundurus-T can't be defeated by Protect stalling.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avoid taking unneeded damage with Thundurus-T, since it needs its HP to safely set up Agility. Use Thundurus-T as a hit-and-run Pokemon early-game to distribute damage while preserving its health. Only set up Agility when the opposing team is weakened enough to be swept or when you must remove a specific Pokemon, like Latios or Alakazam, to win with Thundurus-T's teammates. This set works better in the hands of an aggressive player, since it's heavily dependent on good predictions, like double switches, to do its job.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Even if this Thundurus-T prefers more offensive Pokemon as partners, Politoed still is its best partner, since it sets rain to give Thunder perfect accuracy alongside creating setup opportunities with Encore. Entry hazard setters like Jirachi and Ferrothorn also check Latios and other Psychic-types. Hard-hitting Pokemon like Latios, Keldeo, Starmie, Kyurem-B, and Mamoswine can weaken the opposing team to allow an Agility sweep. Rapid Spin support from Tentacruel, Excadrill, or Starmie is required as well. Pokemon that can safely bring Thundurus-T into play via U-turn or Baton Pass like Landorus-T, Scizor, Gliscor, Jirachi, and Celebi are good partners. Scizor also helps by Pursuit trapping Psychic-types that can trouble Thundurus-T, like Alakazam. Celebi deserves a special mention, since it can use Baton Pass + Nasty Plot to basically end the game if Thundurus-T sets up Agility as well. In hyper offense structures, fast Taunt and entry hazard users like Azelf, Terrakion, Mew, and Skarmory are the ideal partners. Mew and Azelf can also provide dual screens support for a better Agility sweep. Magic Bounce Espeon and Xatu can also provide dual screens support while reflecting entry hazards.</p> "

Hidden Power Ice is used to OHKO Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor while damaging Grass- and Dragon-types. Focus Blast hits Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Heatran, Kyurem-B, and Kyurem. Protect is used to scout Choice-locked Pokemon, like Latios, Keldeo, and Tyranitar, and to restore a bit of HP in rain with Leftovers.

Since this Thundurus-T is faster than usual, it can even unexpectedly KO maximum Speed Landorus-T, Jolly Excadrill, and standard Tentacruel before they have a chance to set up entry hazards or use Rapid Spin.

Afterwards, Thundurus-T can steal offensive momentum or switch to an entry hazard setter.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Thundurus-T, ideally, is used in rain structures to give Thunder perfect accuracy, so Politoed is its best partner. If using Grass Knot, use Pokemon that love having Gastrodon and Seismitoad removed, like Starmie, Keldeo, and Mamoswine. If using Focus Blast, use powerful Dragon-types that want Steel-type Pokemon gone, like Latios, Dragonite, and Salamence. Ferrothorn is a very good partner, since it can check Latios and provide entry hazard and Knock Off support. Rapid Spin from Tentacruel or Excadrill is always advised. Tentacruel can also set Toxic Spikes, which has awesome synergy with Protect. Pokemon that can bring Thundurus-T in via U-turn like Jirachi, Landorus-T, and Scizor, or via Baton Pass like Celebi, are also very good options. Choice Scarf Scizor deserves a special mention, since it can capitalize on Thundurus-T's Protect scouting to effectively Pursuit trap Latios. Since this Thundurus-T also functions well in sand, especially if using Focus Blast + Grass Knot, partners that can profit from the removal of bulky Ground-types, like Tyranitar, Heatran, Gliscor, Garchomp, Alakazam, and Reuniclus, are very good choices as well.</p> "

Its solid 89 / 90 / 80 defenses are enhanced further by Intimidate, making it one of the few Pokemon capable of confronting Terrakion head-on, and it still has access to Swords Dance and Rock Polish to present a credible physical threat. On top of that, its massive Attack means that Landorus-T doesn't need much investment to pack a punch. Altogether, while it's not the offensive behemoth that was expected, it's still a solid Pokemon that has earned a well-deserved spot in the OU metagame.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Landorus-T has some options that seem decent at first glance, but have some notable issues. With its power, Substitute gives Landorus-T a new dimension of offense, easing prediction and allowing it to throw around its exceptional neutral coverage. Bulk Up provides a more balanced approach to a boosting set, but Landorus-T would really appreciate more Speed to secure more Bulk Ups and be a more potent threat after boosting to pull this off effectively. Swords Dance is in the same boat, with its potency being very Speed-dependent. RestTalk has been a classic combination on Pokemon like Landorus-T, most notably Gyarados, but the changed sleep mechanics in Generation 5 have made it largely ineffectual. Rock Tomb is an option on some sets to make up for the lack of Speed, but its low Base Power makes it extremely unappealing.</p> <p>An offensive EV spread can be used on the Offensive Pivot set for a more offensive Stealth Rock user similar to how Terrakion is often used. However, Terrakion is a more potent user of this type of set due to its superior speed, since it is more than capable of being an offensive threat without boosting moves or items due to its impeccable two-move coverage. Landorus-T's middling Speed makes it a bit more dependent on specialized spreads, Choice items, and setup moves to do its damage, and there's simply no room for Stealth Rock on an offensive set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>There's really no such thing as a \"hard counter\" to Landorus-T. Skarmory comes closest, as most Landorus-T sets will be entirely unable to break through it, but Gravity turns that matchup on its head. Virizion can easily sponge Hidden Power Ice, but its mediocre physical defense means that it can't switch into too many Earthquakes throughout the match. Bulky variants of Latias can easily take a Stone Edge and recover off the damage, but U-turn is still unfriendly, as whatever follows Landorus-T is likely to force Latias out and prevent it from Recovering. Gliscor fears nothing except Hidden Power Ice, but is deathly afraid of said move, so make sure to scout out the set before sending Gliscor in headlong. Slowbro is probably the best counter, as it can take anything Landorus-T throws at it and recover it off passively with Regenerator. However, watch out for U-turn, especially if paired with a Pursuit user to eliminate Slowbro on the way out.</p> <p>Landorus-T's Speed tier renders it much easier to confront offensively than its alternate form. Notably, Salamence outspeeds it and packs an Earthquake immunity, though Stone Edge and Hidden Power Ice do a number on it. Thundurus-T does the same, and will easily destroy Landorus-T with Hidden Power Ice. Jirachi can be hard to switch in, but it can eliminate it with Ice Punch or play flinch games in a pinch. Faster variants of Celebi often carry Hidden Power Ice, which also deals with Landorus-T with ease. Last, but certainly not least, Mamoswine can use Ice Shard to bypass Landorus-T's Speed advantage and take it out. It can also Icicle Crash against bulkier sets, which Landorus-T is unlikely to survive.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Pivot",
        "description": "<p>Admittedly, 145 base Attack doesn't scream for tons of defensive investment, but Landorus-T has all the tools it needs to play the role of offensive pivot and steal momentum away from opposing teams. Its solid bulk and Intimidate let it stop many offensive threats cold, including Terrakion, a Pokemon with few real offensive answers. It's also a stellar user of Stealth Rock, as Landorus-T's bulk lets it easily lay down Stealth Rock, and its power makes it hard to Taunt against. U-turn is stellar for stealing momentum away from opponents, and Earthquake and Hidden Power Ice combine to give solid offensive coverage as well as protection against some top threats, such as Terrakion and Dragonite.</p> <p>Since Landorus-T's base Attack is so high, it can spend all of its EVs on bulk and Speed. 88 Speed EVs with a Naive nature allows Landorus-T to outrun a number of notable threats, including Adamant Dragonite, Modest Heatran, Jolly Breloom, and standard Tentacruel, all of which this set can dispatch with ease. The rest goes into bulk, which combines with Intimidate to give Landorus-T the ability to tank all but the most vicious of OU's most prominent physical attackers and respond in kind. Additionally, even without any investment in Attack, Landorus-T reaches 326 Attack, which is even more than a fully invested Gliscor with an Adamant nature can muster. It also has a solid 105 Special Attack, which gives a super effective Hidden Power Ice enough teeth to deal with targets like Gliscor, Garchomp, and Breloom.</p> <p>Stone Edge is an option over Hidden Power Ice, as it works off of Landorus-T's significantly higher Attack stat. Notably, it deals much more damage than Earthquake to Kyurem-B, and is also incredibly useful for taking on Thundurus-T, which otherwise has carte blanche to set up on this set. However, its accuracy is a real letdown, and it hurts Landorus-T's efficacy against Gliscor, Tangrowth, and other Landorus-T. Additionally, without investing in Attack, Stone Edge misses some important KOs, especially Dragonite. Note that when using Stone Edge, a Jolly nature is preferred. If you already have a Stealth Rock user on your team and you're so inclined, Landorus-T is a great user of Gravity, since it can make use of Gravity Earthquake itself, as well as U-turn to other teammates who benefit from Gravity. While Landorus needs every bit of its bulk, there are faster options. 104 EVs outspeed maximum Speed Tyranitar, while 144 EVs outspeed neutral-natured Heatran. Landorus-T can also opt for a more defensive spread, consisting of 252 HP / 252 Def for greater durability and the ability to survive some of OU's most vicious physical attacks.</p> <p>This Landorus-T is a star on bulky offense, since it's a Stealth Rock user that most Magic Bounce users would never dream of switching into. As a result, it works best with offensive teammates, especially ones that profit well from offensive momentum. It's great for starting Volt-Turn, making it a great teammate for Rotom-W, which also provides Water and Ice resistances. Hydreigon is also a solid teammate for this reason, though a shared Ice weakness can be an issue. Since this Landorus-T lacks recovery, Wish support is highly suggested. Jirachi is one of the best teammates, since Landorus-T is immune to Ground, resistant to Fighting, and neutral to Fire. Vaporeon is also an excellent option, since it provides Water and Ice resistances, while Landorus-T is immune to Electric and neutral to Grass. Finally, Landorus-T's ability to force switches means that it makes great use of entry hazards.</p> "

        "name": "Double Booster",
        "description": "<p>Landorus-T's respectable bulk, useful ability in Intimidate, and key resistance to Fighting and immunity to Ground and Electric attacks make it a perfect candidate for a double boosting set. The main selling point of this set is its flexibility. With a Swords Dance boost, Landorus-T can rip through slower, more defensive teams while Rock Polish lets it clean up weakened, faster teams. Due to the aforementioned attributes, it is not uncommon for Landorus-T to grab multiple boosts and decimate unprepared teams. While Terrakion might seem like the superior double booster due to its higher Speed and access to STAB Stone Edge, Landorus-T sports a higher base Attack and has a much easier time setting up on common walls such as Forretress and Ferrothorn thanks to Intimidate and its lack of weaknesses to their STAB moves. Unlike Terrakion, Landorus-T is also not weak to common priority moves such as Mach Punch and Bullet Punch, although Ice Shard will quickly dismantle it.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Landorus-T's Attack while allowing it to outspeed everything up to Adamant Toxicroak at +0 and common Choice Scarf users such as Keldeo and Latios after a Rock Polish. The remaining EVs are invested in HP for added longevity. If Toxicroak is not a concern, 184 Speed EVs are sufficient, with 24 EVs moved to HP for even more bulk. Alternatively, Landorus-T can simply opt to run max Speed with an Adamant nature to outpace Adamant Lucario and Timid Heatran without a boost at the cost of bulk.</p> <p>As is the case for most sweepers, entry hazard support tremendously helps this set, as not only does Landorus-T naturally forces a lot of switches, but entry hazards also help it achieve OHKOs on some bulkier Pokemon. Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory are all fine choices in this regard. Although Earthquake and Stone Edge provides near-perfect coverage in OU, this set still has trouble muscling through several common walls, notably Gliscor, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Skarmory. Thus, partners that can soften or lure these walls are highly recommended. This includes common OU Pokemon such as Choice Band Terrakion, Expert Belt Jirachi, Ice Punch Lucario, and Technician Breloom, all of which naturally attract these Pokemon. Note that as the last Pokemon, Landorus-T can potentially beat Skarmory and Hippowdon as they can no longer phaze it.</p> <p>Leftovers is the item of choice as the extra recovery is very helpful when setting up in front of walls or tanking priority moves. Alternative items for this set include Lum Berry, Yache Berry, Life Orb, and Earth Plate. Lum Berry is especially useful for setting up on Jirachi without fearing a Body Slam paralysis, as well as Will-O-Wisp or Scald burns from bulky Water types, which despite being super effective, can usually be tanked by Landorus-T outside of rain. Yache Berry can be used to take an Ice Shard from Mamoswine, Weavile, or Donphan trying to cut short Landorus-T's sweep. Finally, Life Orb and Earth Plate are useful items that boost Landorus-T's power, the former giving a more significant boost at the cost of HP. However, keep in mind that Leftovers is still the preferred item on this set as it also helps Landorus-T in checking and setting up on the premier physical attacker in the game, Terrakion, as well as other physical attackers such as non-Ice Punch Lucario and Jirachi.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>91 base Speed is plenty to warrant a Choice Scarf set, especially considering that unlike its Incarnate version, Landorus-T doesn't have to rely on weather for its physical damage output. Earthquake is basic STAB, though it's iffy on a Choice set due to its relatively common immunities. U-turn is also a given, as it's excellent for keeping momentum after Landorus-T forces a switch. Stone Edge provides solid neutral coverage, while Hidden Power Ice pounds Dragon-types, wards off Gliscor and opposing Landorus-T of all stripes, and can break down Tangrowth. On the other hand, Superpower is the best option against Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Bronzong. It also hits Air Balloon Heatran, which is useful. Remember to use the right nature—Naive for Hidden Power Ice and Jolly for Superpower.</p> <p>Punishment is cute against some boosting Pokemon, and can be especially good against opponents such as Reuniclus and Calm Mind Latias, who become incredibly dangerous after a couple of boosts and need overwhelming power to take down. Explosion is an option, as it provides solid neutral coverage and plenty of punch as a last-ditch attack. EVs are very basic: Attack is maximized to provide maximum offensive power, and Speed is maxed with a Jolly nature to give Landorus-T enough Speed to outspeed +1 neutral-natured base 100s.</p> <p>As with any Landorus-T set, this works best on bulky offense. Intimidate and good resistances give it plenty of chances to switch in, and as primarily a speedy hit-and-run Pokemon, it doesn't take a lot of support to make it effective. That said, Stealth Rock is always an issue, as it makes it harder for Landorus-T to switch in repeatedly. Starmie is the best spinner for the slot, as it provides crucial resistances to Water and Ice, and Landorus-T can switch into Electric attacks, especially Thunder, and come out unscathed. Wish support from Jirachi is also nice, as it helps Landorus-T leverage its bulk and ability to switch in.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Gravity",
        "description": "<p>An unorthodox setup set, Gravity wrecks a lot of top Landorus-T counters. Without their Ground immunities, Pokemon such as Skarmory, Bronzong, Gliscor, and Balloon carriers lose the ability to switch into Landorus-T with impunity. On top of that, Stone Edge is 100% accurate in Gravity, temporarily making it not the worst move in the game. Finally, Hidden Power Ice blows up the few defensive Pokemon not crippled by Gravity, such as exceptionally bulky Gliscor, Tangrowth, and some other Grass-types. Alternatively, U-turn can be used to hit Grass-types and pass Gravity to other abusers on the team.</p> <p>Spikes provide double duty here, as not only does Landorus-T greatly appreciate the chip damage, but Gravity renders many normally unaffected fliers and levitators vulnerable to them. Ferrothorn provides a longer-lasting presence, can also spread Thunder Wave, and resists Water for Landorus-T. As icing, Ferrothorn gains 100% accurate Power Whip and Leech Seed, two moves it relies on to be effective.</p> <p>Special mention here goes to teammates that can effectively make use of Gravity. Starmie comes to mind, as it can use Hydro Pump and Thunder with 100% accuracy without requiring Rain for the latter, and Starmie brings with it useful resistances. Mamoswine doubles up on the Ground-type threat, which is both a blessing and a curse due to shared weaknesses. Still, if Landorus-T can break through Ground resistances, Mamoswine can be a real terror. Between Earthquake with no immunities and 100% accurate Icicle Crash and Stone Edge, Mamoswine is a far more reliable offensive threat with Gravity in effect.</p> "

  "Kyurem": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW OU metagame in general. A <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/kyurem-ou-qc-0-1.3682049/\">revamp</a> for this analysis is being worked on at the moment.</p> <hr /> <p>Ever since its introduction, Kyurem has been a pretty rare sight in OU, and looking at its stats, it's not exactly clear why; these stats are absolutely on par with those of the many Uber legendaries. Base 130 attacking stats stand out in particular. On top of this, Dragon and Ice are great offensive types individually, if not fantastic in combination. So, you ask again, why? Well, defensively, its Ice typing is a severe liability, leaving it extremely vulnerable to entry hazards and common attacks. This cannot be stressed enough: Kyurem hates entry hazards of all kinds, which makes Rapid Spin support almost compulsory. This can be somewhat counteracted by Kyurem's fantastic natural bulk, though; Kyurem's defensive stats would be considered good for a wall, and can allow it to switch into Water-, Grass-, and Electric-types with ease. Unfortunately, however, there is more bad news: Kyurem's Speed stat falls agonizingly short of Hydreigon, Haxorus, and a multitude of base 100s. Despite the extremely welcome addition of Earth Power, its movepool is rather lacking in comparison to other Dragons in OU; Kyurem lacks a good boosting move, as well as Earthquake and Fire-type moves. Altogether, this makes an outright sweep rather unlikely.</p> <p>So, what is Kyurem good for? What does it have over other Dragons? Well, Kyurem's main niche is the ability to function effectively in hail, in which it can fire off monstrous Blizzards. Additionally, Ice STAB can prove useful in eliminating Grass-types and OHKOing Dragonite through Multiscale. Thanks to the addition of Roost from a BW2 move tutor, Pressure has become a much more valuable ability, too. Don't forget that it has the best overall power and the best overall bulk of any OU Dragon-type (other than Kyurem-B), and that it isn't weak to Pursuit or U-turn. Overall, Kyurem is definitely not the best Dragon in OU, but it definitely has a niche, and with the right support, can be very rewarding.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Although Kyurem might have a very impressive Attack stat, its physical movepool is barren. Outrage, Dragon Claw, Dragon Tail, Zen Headbutt, and Stone Edge are pretty much the extent of its physical attacking movepool. Hone Claws is a somewhat viable boosting move; it can boost the power of Kyurem's physical moves and give Blizzard respectable accuracy outside of hail. A bulky set with Substitute, Hone Claws, Protect, and either Dragon Claw or Dragon Tail is fairly notable as it can easily dispatch Chansey and Blissey, and can wear other problematic opponents down with residual damage. Glaciate, Kyurem's signature move, is also viable; it can be used on the switch to slow down opponents before hitting them with the appropriate move. However, Substitute is usually the superior move, as it is also effective against slower opponents, and can protect Kyurem from status moves and priority attacks. A Life Orb set also performs fairly well in the lead position, so there is no real need to use a \"lead\" set featuring Glaciate and Endeavor. The entire concept of a lead is rather outdated anyway.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>When it comes to countering Kyurem directly, its mixed and Choice Specs sets are the most problematic. Most of Kyurem's checks are Steel-types, as they resist Blizzard and Draco Meteor—indeed, the majority of common Steel-types can check the Choice Scarf set. When it comes to genuine counters though, Bronzong is by far the best, as it is also immune to Kyurem's premier coverage move, Earth Power. At full health, however, it's worth noting that the SubRoost set can often stall Bronzong out of Gyro Ball PP. Scizor is also a very strong check, fearing only the rare Hidden Power Fire or Choice Specs Blizzard, and dealing 90% minimum with Choice Band-boosted Bullet Punch. Specially defensive Jirachi is a reasonable switch-in, but a Life Orb Earth Power has a chance to 2HKO, and with hail and entry hazards, even the SubRoost set can present problems.</p> <p>Special walls also make good checks to Kyurem. Tyranitar can take pretty much anything but Focus Blast, although it does struggle to take Draco Meteor + Outrage from the mixed set as well. It will remove hail too, rendering Blizzard inaccurate. Blissey and Chansey stop the Choice sets cold, but Blissey fears a 2HKO from Outrage. Chansey, taking 40.9-48.15%, is at risk only in hail or with entry hazards. Neither of these can break through the SubRoost set either, with Pressure burning through their Seismic Toss PP. However, they might be able to PP stall Kyurem out depending on the conditions; Toxic Spikes, or hail in the case of Chansey, will usually lead to defeat.</p> <p>Finally, you can exploit Kyurem's slightly disappointing Speed to revenge kill it; just be wary of Kyurem's excellent natural bulk. A super effective STAB attack, such as Infernape's or Terrakion's Close Combat, or a Dragon-type attack from Hydreigon, Latios, or Haxorus, should OHKO Kyurem comfortably.</p> ",

        "name": "SubRoost",
        "description": "<p>Rather than focusing solely on Kyurem's massive Special Attack stat, this set utilizes its above-average bulk, its nice set of resistances, and its Pressure ability. Substitute eases prediction and prevents Kyurem from being crippled by status or revenge killed easily. Kyurem can make 101 HP Substitutes, or ones that will only fade after two hits of Seismic Toss or Night Shade. Weaker moves, such as Scald and Volt Switch, usually won't break the Substitute either thanks to Kyurem's resistances and above-average defenses. When combined with Roost, Substitute can even be used to stall out the opponent's PP with Pressure, which is especially effective if only one or two moves can break Kyurem's Substitutes. Pokemon you might expect to beat Kyurem, such as Bronzong, can be rendered useless as their attacking PP disappears.</p> <p>Though this set might be less powerful than some of the others, it should not be forgotten that Kyurem has an impressive base 130 Special Attack stat and very good neutral coverage. Its STAB move, Ice Beam or Dragon Pulse, will of course be its staple attack. Ice Beam (or Blizzard if using Kyurem in hail) probably offers better super effective coverage, but the neutral coverage of Dragon Pulse is unparalleled. Earth Power is an excellent coverage move in either case, hitting every Steel-type but Skarmory, which is covered by Ice Beam, and Bronzong, which can be dealt with by PP stalling. Focus Blast might have disappointing accuracy and PP, but it has perfect neutral coverage with Dragon Pulse, and is therefore a strong choice.</p> <p>The given EVs grant Kyurem 404 HP, which allows it to make bulky 101 HP Substitutes, and give it enough Speed to outrun Jolly Mamoswine and Dragonite, as well as Adamant Lucario and Landorus-T. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack to let Kyurem hit as hard as possible. If you wish to run a little more Special Attack, you can lower Kyurem's Speed EVs to 216 for Adamant Lucario or 224 for Adamant Landorus-T. If outrunning Adamant Haxorus, Modest Hydreigon, and Jolly Landorus-T is a major concern, you can use a Timid nature instead, but this set is already rather weak compared to other Kyurem sets. Hidden Power Fire can be used instead of Earth Power in order to hit Scizor and Ferrothorn much harder, but leaves Kyurem walled by the likes of Heatran. You'll need to add 4 extra EVs to Speed when using it due to the imperfect IV required. Life Orb is an option if you prefer a boost in power, offering a chance to 2HKO specially defensive Jirachi and Choice Band Scizor with Earth Power, but the residual damage will build up too fast, causing Kyurem to use Roost far more often than without.</p> <p>As far as teammates are concerned, you might wish to consider Abomasnow, as its ability, Snow Warning, allows Kyurem to spam one of the most powerful Blizzards in the game. The extra hail damage is also very helpful when stalling, for example allowing Kyurem to beat Chansey. Be warned, however, that Blizzard has lower PP than the alternative moves. Toxic Spikes are also highly helpful when PP stalling, as they let Kyurem beat Blissey and a whole host of other Pokemon with recovery. Tentacruel is a good Pokemon to set up Toxic Spikes, as it also has access to Rapid Spin and covers Kyurem's weaknesses. Rapid Spin is crucial, since Kyurem is weak to every kind of entry hazard (as is Abomasnow). If not using Tentacruel, you should consider another Rapid Spin user such as Starmie. Scizor, and some other Steel-types depending on your choice of coverage move, can take at least one of Kyurem's moves and KO it with their STAB moves. Therefore, Magnezone is a decent choice, since it can trap and KO Steel-types, including Scizor and Jirachi.</p> "

        "name": "Choice",
        "description": "<p>Given that Kyurem's STAB moves are very powerful and resisted by fairly few Pokemon, a Choice set is a very good option. A Choice Scarf will boost Kyurem's slightly disappointing Speed stat to one which beats the entire unboosted metagame, including all of the genies' Therian forms, letting it act as a revenge killer and late-game cleaner. Choice Specs, on the other hand, allows Kyurem to smash through defensive Pokemon with its monstrous power, but might cause it to be forced out by faster Pokemon. Generally, spamming Blizzard in hail is Kyurem's best option, as this move is powerful and without drawbacks. Ice Beam is significantly weaker, and so will probably not act as Kyurem's main attacking move, but it does not necessitate hail. Draco Meteor might be even stronger than Blizzard, but the Special Attack drops will often force Kyurem out, which is not ideal for a Pokemon so weak to entry hazards. Nonetheless, this hits Fire- and Water-types a lot harder than Blizzard does, and is fairly reliable outside of hail. Steel-type Pokemon resist all of these moves, however, so Focus Blast and Earth Power are great options for the remaining two slots. Earth Power hits all Steel-types but Bronzong and Skarmory for at least neutral damage, and is especially effective against Jirachi and Heatran. Focus Blast, on the other hand, provides a good super effective hit on Tyranitar and Ferrothorn. Forgoing one of these moves for Dragon Pulse is viable, as this move is great for late-game cleaning due to its perfect accuracy and excellent coverage.</p> <p>The spread on this set is really simple: Special Attack, and hence Kyurem's damage output, is maximized, as is Kyurem's Speed, which allows it to tie opposing Kyurem and Darmanitan and to outrun Landorus-T. Running a Modest nature is also a decent idea, to give Kyurem's attacks extra power, but the Choice Scarf set will miss out on outrunning Scarf Landorus-T, +1 Adamant Haxorus, and +1 Modest Volcarona, among other things. As far as alternative moves go, you could consider Hidden Power Fire to hit Scizor, Forretress, and Ferrothorn, though in that case you might as well drop Kyurem's Speed EVs to 228 just to outrun Landorus-T (because of the imperfect Speed IV required). Outrage is also a possibility in conjunction with a Naive nature, as it allows Kyurem to deal more damage to Blissey, Chansey, and Pokemon with boosted Special Defense, such as +1 Volcarona and Keldeo.</p> <p>As far as team support is concerned, Abomasnow should be your first consideration. Kyurem is the only dragon that benefits from hail, where its Blizzard gains perfect accuracy, and the opponent's Leftovers are cancelled. Rapid Spin support is also near-compulsory due to Kyurem's massive entry hazard weakness and frequent switching. Starmie would be a decent choice, as the two have good defensive synergy. You might also want to consider Magnezone, as Kyurem has trouble with Steel-types, especially Scizor and Jirachi.</p> "

        "name": "Special Life Orb",
        "description": "<p>This set aims to make the best use of Kyurem's excellent Special Attack without sacrificing too much of its durability or coverage. The combination of power and flexibility offered by a Life Orb is hard to resist, and with the addition of Roost, the additional residual damage need not be overwhelming. Blizzard is Kyurem's main STAB move in hail, as it is very powerful, virtually drawback-free, and has decent coverage. Ice Beam is significantly weaker, but is clearly the superior option if you are using Kyurem outside of hail. Draco Meteor, on the other hand, is Kyurem's ace in the hole. Offering enormous power and near-perfect coverage, it hits any Fire- or Water-type that might attempt to take Kyurem's Blizzard. Unfortunately, its side-effect will usually force Kyurem out, which is far from ideal for a Pokemon so weak to entry hazards. Focus Blast and Earth Power provide coverage on Steel-types and Tyranitar. Earth Power notably falls short against Ferrothorn and Tyranitar, but hits Jirachi much harder and is significantly more accurate. Roost allows Kyurem to recover off damage from Life Orb and entry hazards, and allows Kyurem to make some use of its bulk and Pressure ability.</p> <p>The EVs on this set allow Kyurem to outrun positive-natured Landorus-T, maximize Special Attack, and then give Kyurem a touch more bulk so that it can take better advantage of Roost. A Modest nature with 236 Speed EVs is an option to outrun positive-natured base 80s, such as Mamoswine and Venusaur, but Kyurem will instead only outrun neutral-natured Landorus-T, and will also miss out on neutral-natured Hydreigon and Haxorus. The only other notable move option is Hidden Power Fire, which will deal great damage to Scizor, Forretress, and Ferrothorn, but will leave Kyurem walled by Tyranitar and Heatran.</p> <p>Chansey and Blissey are extremely annoying for this set to face, as they wall Kyurem completely and can cripple it with Thunder Wave or Toxic. You might want to find a way to lure them in, for example Tricking them with Latios or Rotom-W. As Scizor and Jirachi can also be problematic, support from Magnezone can be considered. Abomasnow is as always a good partner for Kyurem, as it allows an accurate Blizzard and provides useful residual damage on the opponent. A Rapid Spin user is also greatly appreciated, due to Kyurem's severe entry hazard weakness; Starmie and Tentacruel are therefore both good partners.</p> "

        "name": "Mixed",
        "description": "<p>This set makes full use of Kyurem's monstrous attacking stats to break through walls, opening up gaping holes in the opponent's team. Draco Meteor is phenomenally powerful, threatening all but Steel-types and dedicated special walls with an OHKO. Even the few Pokemon that survive will then have to contend with the possibility of Outrage; despite the minimal Attack investment, this still hits as hard as that from a maximum Attack neutral-natured Life Orb Flygon. Outrage will 2HKO all Blissey and will give Kyurem a good chance to break through Chansey in hail, or with entry hazards. Of course, both of these moves have large drawbacks, so Blizzard is a great move to have, providing a strong, reliable move to use in hail. It also hits Grass- and Flying-types super effectively; for example, Kyurem can easily OHKO Dragonite through Multiscale. Ice Beam is the better move on teams without hail, though of course this is to forgo one of Kyurem's main advantages over other Dragons. Outside of hail, Dragonite, Salamence, Hydreigon, or Latios might prove a better choice due to their superior Speed and typing, though they do lack Kyurem's power and bulk. However, since it received Earth Power from a BW2 Move Tutor, Kyurem doesn't have the same trouble with Steel-types that it used to. Earth Power completes Kyurem's neutral coverage outside of Bronzong, and notably OHKOes Heatran and 2HKOes specially defensive Jirachi some of the time.</p> <p>All in all, this set is extremely powerful, but can be worn down rather quickly, given the Life Orb and Kyurem's crippling weakness to entry hazards. Notably, though, it isn't forced to switch as often as the Choice set is; this Kyurem only needs to come in once to cause havoc.</p> <p>The spread on this set allows Kyurem to outrun positive-natured Landorus-T and Lucario, as well as neutral-natured Hydreigon and Haxorus. Special Attack is then maximized to give Draco Meteor and Blizzard maximum punch, and the remainder is placed into Attack to boost the power of Outrage. A Hasty nature provides the required boost to Speed without hurting Kyurem's offenses; a Defense-hindering nature is chosen as most of Kyurem's resistances are specially oriented. Kyurem can quite easily switch into Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type Pokemon this way. A Naive nature could be used instead to let Kyurem better take some physical priority moves, but Kyurem shouldn't be taking these anyway. A Mild nature with 236 Speed EVs can be used to give Kyurem more power and outspeed positive-natured base 80s, such as Venusaur and Mamoswine, but Kyurem loses out against all of the aforementioned Speed targets.</p> <p>The moves on this set are also somewhat flexible. Focus Blast is an alternative to Earth Power, as it allows Kyurem to hit Tyranitar considerably harder while still hitting most Steel-types, especially Ferrothorn. Hidden Power Fire might require the addition of 4 Speed EVs, but it provides a very strong hit on Scizor, Forretress, and Ferrothorn while still doing moderate damage to the likes of Jirachi. It is also by far Kyurem's best attack against Bronzong.</p> <p>As far as teammates are concerned, Abomasnow is highly recommended, as it provides Kyurem with a 100% accurate Blizzard and cancels the opponent's Leftovers. Rapid Spin support, for example from Starmie, is also recommended, due to Kyurem's (and Abomasnow's) huge entry hazard weakness. Trapping problematic opponents can also be effective; Magnezone can trap Scizor, Ferrothorn and Forretress.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW OU metagame in general. A <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/kyurem-black-wip.3678735/\">revamp</a> is currently being worked on for this analysis.</p> <hr /> <p>Despite having stats worthy of Ubers residency, Kyurem-B was determined by suspect test voters to be simply OU, falling just short of its White counterpart. It all comes down to a few reasons: average Speed and defensive typing, in addition to a less-than-ideal offensive movepool. These combined flaws make Kyurem-B extremely vulnerable to common super effective attacks from many faster Pokemon or priority users in OU. Its Ice typing also makes it annoyingly weak to all forms of entry hazards, which greatly lessens its effectiveness if not supported by entry hazard control. Kyurem-B's worst flaw, however, is its horrible physical movepool, which is basically limited to Fusion Bolt, Dragon Claw, and Outrage, often making it dependent on special moves for coverage. This isn't taking into account massive competition with other Dragon-types in OU, some of which boast a higher Speed stat and/or better movesets than Kyurem-B.</p> <p>While these very flaws constantly threaten Kyurem-B's presence in OU, it is still very much an undeniable threat. Its typing still gives it good resistances to Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks, which are valuable in a metagame dominated by rain. Kyurem-B is also one of the few Dragon-types not weak to Ice-type attacks, allowing it to easily dispatch Pokemon that are normally very reliant on Ice Beam, Ice Shard, or Hidden Power Ice for checking Dragon-types. These are all amplified by relatively good natural bulk, which stops Kyurem-B from being easily revenge killed. Given the right set of attacks and backed up by its amazingly massive base 170 Attack and 120 Special Attack stats, Kyurem-B can bring ruin to pretty much every Pokemon and every type of team in OU. One can even go as far as saying Kyurem-B is the overall most powerful and bulkiest Dragon-type in OU, and although it certainly isn't the best, it most certainly distinguishes itself.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>As barren a wasteland as Kyurem-B's movepool is, its offensive and defensive stats are good enough to find alternate uses of what is available to it. For example, Kyurem-B's underrated base 120 Special Attack stat and fairly diverse special movepool are more than enough to make up a dedicated special attacking set with either Life Orb or Choice Specs. Using a purely special set also maximizes coverage, leaving little room for Kyurem-B to get walled or stalled out thanks to any combination of Earth Power, Focus Blast, Hidden Power Fire, and Roost. Arguably and ironically, such a set could be pulled off better by Kyurem, which sports a slightly higher Special Attack stat, although Kyurem-B's reputation as a deadly physical attacker can often net many surprise kills.</p> <p>On the physical side, Kyurem-B has alternative physical attacks available to it, including Stone Edge, Zen Headbutt, Iron Head, and Shadow Claw. These moves, however, offer over-specific or redundant coverage that is purely outclassed by the coverage given from special attacks. Since Game Freak was too stupid to give Kyurem-B a good physical Ice-type attack, it can resort to Freeze Shock as a filler option, although using it leaves Kyurem-B vulnerable for a turn and allows the opponent to take advantage of this opportunity by going for a KO or setting up. Interestingly enough, a Choice Band Freeze Shock can OHKO Ferrothorn. Kyurem-B can also use Hone Claws to boost its physical power and the accuracy of Blizzard, but its typing and Speed leaves it very little opportunities to set up successfully.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Saying Kyurem-B has no counters would be a dramatic exaggeration. Regardless, due to its ridiculously high offensive stats and available coverage options, it practically has no hard counters or switch-ins per se. Players must therefore rely on soft counters to combat specific sets, all of which have their own set of checks and counters. The closest thing to a complete stop are physically defensive variants of Jirachi, which sports the overall bulk to take both special and physical attacks from Kyurem-B. In return, Jirachi can either paralyze with Thunder Wave or Body Slam, or simply chip off Kyurem-B's health with Iron Head or Flash Cannon. With entry hazards and hail in effect, however, every Jirachi can get 2HKOed by either Life Orb Fusion Bolt or Earth Power. Similarly, Ferrothorn is either resistant or neutral to Kyurem-B's main moves, and can reply with Thunder Wave, Leech Seed, or Gyro Ball. Non-Gyro Ball variants struggle pathetically against Substitute sets, and Kyurem-B can use either Hidden Power Fire or Focus Blast to dispatch it quickly. Ferrothorn can also easily be worn down from taking repeated Ice Beams, Blizzards, and other attacks from Kyurem-B's teammates. All in all, physically defensive Steel-types (except for Skarmory due to its weakness to Fusion Bolt) can handle physically-based sets well, although a coverage move like Earth Power or Focus Blast can prematurely end the likes of Forretress, Cobalion, and Metagross.</p> <p>Checking Kyurem-B is a far more common and arguably more practical way of dealing with it, as its typing and average Speed leave it vulnerable to a host of common threats in OU. Specifically, Kyurem-B is revenge killed easily by attacks from faster enemies; examples include Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse from Latios, Latias, and Hydreigon; Outrage from Haxorus and Salamence; Close Combat or Stone Edge from the Swords of Justice; Secret Sword from Keldeo; Iron Head from Jirachi; and Focus Blast from Tornadus and Alakazam. The secondary Ice-typing also makes it weak to common priority moves, especially Mach Punch from Breloom and Conkeldurr and Bullet Punch from Scizor and Metagross. If Kyurem-B mispredicts with an ineffective move or is locked into Outrage, it becomes easy pickings for the aforementioned attackers. These Pokemon, however, must tread carefully when it comes to the Choice Scarf set, Substitute sets, or sets with resistance Berries, because Kyurem-B can then ruin common checks and switch-ins.</p> <p>Finally, entry hazards in general impair Kyurem's ability to sponge hits and make it more prone to revenge killing. Even with uninvested defenses, Kyurem-B still has enough bulk to survive random attacks at full health. Even Choice Band Scizor stands no chance at OHKOing 4/0 Kyurem-B, managing only 82.86 - 98.2% with Bullet Punch, while Substitute Hydreigon only stands a fair 25% chance of an OHKO with Dragon Pulse. Laying out Stealth Rock or at least one layer of Spikes ultimately makes these OHKOs happen. Toxic Spikes also get a good mention, as they add to the amount of residual damage offensive sets suffer and also limit the number of times Kyurem-B can cycle between Roost and Substitute.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>More often than not, Kyurem-B's presence causes the village peasants to run for the hills, only for their steel-clad cavalry, musketeers, dragons, and dragon slayers to suddenly switch in and ruin its rampage. Using Substitute with a couple of coverage moves, however, enables Kyurem-B to scout and bring ruin to these presumed \"safe\" switch-ins and counters. Thanks to its bulk, resistances to common Electric-, Grass-, and Water-type attacks, and a fearsome offensive presence, setting up a Substitute should be relatively easy, especially in the face of Starmie, Politoed, Jellicent, Rotom-W, and Celebi. Besides scouting for dangerous threats, Substitute also protects Kyurem-B from status and otherwise dire attacks. Beware that once this strategy has been revealed, the opponent will likely be eager to break future Substitutes, so Kyurem-B's health might be compromised.</p> <p>This set is physically-based, so Fusion Bolt and Dragon Claw are the main moves on this set, dealing huge damage to almost every relevant OU threat, save specific Steel-types. Ice Beam can be used over Dragon Claw or as a third attacking move to KO physically bulky Ground-types such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, Donphan, and Hippowdon. It also serves as a better option against Grass-types such as Celebi and Breloom, which Dragon Claw fails to KO. For the last slot, Roost is particularly quite useful with Life Orb, allowing Kyurem-B to hit hard while staying healthy. Hidden Power Fire is a nice alternative to KO Scizor, Forretress, and Ferrothorn outside of the rain, and works especially well Kyurem-B has set up a Substitute to take a Bullet Punch from Scizor. If Kyurem-B uses a third attacking move, Leftovers is mandatory to recover health lost from taking damage and using Substitutes.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Kyurem-B to create 101 HP Substitutes, so its Substitutes cannot be broken by a single Seismic Toss or Night Shade. It also guarantees that Kyurem-B can outrun all Pokemon on the positive base 80 Speed range and below, including Mamoswine, Dragonite, and Adamant Lucario. The remaining are placed in Attack to make Kyurem-B as powerful as possible, although in exchange for a mere 16 EVs from Attack, its Speed can be maximized. Investment in Special Attack is hardly necessary, as Ice Beam and Hidden Power Fire are only used to hit specific targets. If using a special move, a Lonely nature is preferred to avoid lowering the power of special attacks; otherwise, use an Adamant nature. Other moves to consider for this set include Earth Power and Blizzard. Earth Power is a specific option used only for Heatran and Magnezone, although Fusion Bolt can simply 2HKO Heatran and Dragon Claw is a more powerful option against Ground-weak threats such as Tyranitar and Terrakion. Blizzard is a stronger option that should only be used in hail, although Ice Beam is accurate in every weather, and is thus basically foolproof.</p> <p>Since this set's success lies in Substitute, Kyurem-B needs to avoid passive damage to set up and attack without risk. Entry hazards are especially annoying because they lower Kyurem-B's health and limit the number of Substitutes it can make, so entry hazard control is definitely required. This can be achieved with a Rapid Spin user such as Starmie, Tentacruel, and Forretress, all of which sport a resistance to at least one of Kyurem-B's weaknesses. Pairing Kyurem-B with a Magic Bounce user also works, although both users fall prey easily to Tyranitar, a common user of Stealth Rock. Speaking of which, sandstorm is also detrimental to Kyurem-B's health, so it is a good idea to pack a weather inducer to summon beneficial weather. Kyurem-B works particularly well in hail, where it can utilize a perfectly accurate STAB Blizzard and hit harder with Hidden Power Fire if rain isn't present. Abomasnow can also easily beat Politoed, Hippowdon, and weakened Tyranitar in a weather war. Be wary that using Kyurem-B and Abomasnow on the same times doubles up on Rock- and Fighting- type weaknesses, so both must be provided with outstanding defensive synergy from teammates. If hail isn't your team's forte, Kyurem-B can also fit on sun- or rain-based teams, where it can be used as a countermeasure against most opposing weather teams. Sun, in particular, offers offensive backup against Ferrothorn and other troublesome Steel-types in the form of boosted Fire-type attacks.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Kyurem-B's average Speed often makes it vulnerable to deadly attacks from faster Pokemon, but everybody knows the solution to such a crisis: a Choice Scarf! Thanks to the boosted Speed and the ridiculous power behind its attacks, it can act as both a decent revenge killer and a mid- to late-game cleaner. The main reason to use Kyurem-B over similar and faster Choice Scarf users such as Salamence and Terrakion is that it packs much more wallbreaking power at the start thanks to its higher base Attack stat and Dragon-type STAB while still outrunning many relevant offensive threats. Kyurem-B can even ignore Dragonite's Multiscale ability, OHKOing it even at full health. With these things in mind, Kyurem-B will have little problem mowing down both offensive and defensive teams with Steel-types out of the way.</p> <p>In situations where physical Dragon-type STAB won't do the trick, Kyurem-B should use Fusion Bolt along with either Ice Beam or Earth Power. Fusion Bolt is a no-risk option that's stronger against Flying- or Water-types than Outrage and is also especially useful if physical contact can be detrimental, such as against Flame Body Volcarona. The choice between Ice Beam and Earth Power depends on which threats are more dangerous to the team. Ice Beam is generally a better option in terms of coverage, covering bulky Ground-, Grass-, and Flying-type threats and ensuring Gliscor can't attempt to stall the faster Kyurem-B out with Substitute and Protect. Because Fusion Bolt no longer has the power to 2HKO Heatran, Earth Power can instead be used to deal a larger amount of damage to it. Keep in mind that Fusion Bolt is still a stronger option against Jirachi, despite the fact that Jirachi is weak to Earth Power.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is recommended on this set to outrun or tie with as many opponents as possible, especially boosted threats such as +1 Adamant Haxorus, +1 Modest Volcarona, and the occasional Choice Scarf Kyurem and Rotom-W, and maximum investment in Speed is also a requirement for this reason. If these threats are of no concern to your team, Kyurem-B can instead use an Adamant nature to boost its overall physical power and still outrun all +1 Gyarados and Dragonite. Investment in Attack is obviously beneficial; however, since Kyurem-B's Attack stat is already naturally high, it can afford to go bulky and sacrifice EVs, unlike other Choice Scarf users. The EVs can be relocated from Attack or Speed to a defensive stat of your choice besides HP (because Kyurem-B also happens to have naturally high HP as well), although too much investment could be detrimental offensively. A decent benchmark is 188 Speed with an Adamant nature, allowing Kyurem-B to revenge kill threats as fast as Modest Choice Scarf Rotom-W.</p> <p>A novel option that Kyurem-B can use to some sort of effect is Fling. Using Fling allows Kyurem-B to switch moves once its Choice Scarf is gone, which is beneficial if it's required to alternate between Dragon Claw and Fusion Bolt (especially when slower Steel-types are present). Most of the time, this will not be the case because of teammates and Outrage's locking side-effect, and Kyurem-B will miss the coverage offered by Ice Beam or Earth Power.</p> <p>As Kyurem-B is using either Dragon Claw or Outrage most of the time, it is recommended to remove Steel-types to make cleaning up faster. Kyurem-B is especially in trouble if Ferrothorn, Forretress, and other physically defensive Steel-types are present, because they sponge all of the attacks on this set with ease. Therefore, Magnezone, or Magneton can make good partners since they can eliminate these Steel-types. If the conventional trap-and-kill route doesn't work for its team, using offensive Pokemon with Fire-, Fighting- and Ground-type attacks is a nice alternative. In this case, attackers such as mixed Hydreigon, Terrakion, and even Infernape are beneficial, because they can break through most types of teams with the power and coverage they have. Finally, since Kyurem-B is vulnerable to getting revenge killed by Moxie Choice Scarf Salamence, it would be wise to have insurance against it. A physically defensive Steel-type of your own does well by absorbing boosted Outrages; choices for this include but are not limited to Jirachi, Forretress, Cobalion, and Skarmory, all of whom also offer additional support in the form of Stealth Rock or, as in Forretress's case, Rapid Spin.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Say hello to the world's most powerful Outrage, and possibly the most powerful Choice Band user to date in the history of Pokemon. While Kyurem-B certainly isn't the best Choice Band user due to its decidedly average coverage, it makes up for this flaw through pure wallbreaking power, all thanks to that legendary Attack stat. In any case, the battle plan is simple: just click Outrage and witness destruction unfold. Even Steel-types like Jirachi, Heatran, and Metagross find themselves 2HKOed by Outrage. Obviously, there are situations where being locked into Outrage is very risky or unnecessary, so Dragon Claw is a safer and more reliable alternative. If the opponent's Steel-types are still present, Fusion Bolt should be enough to 2HKO many of them, save Ferrothorn, while taking care of Water- and Flying-types more reliably than Outrage overall. In the last slot, Ice Beam is used simply to KO Gliscor and Landorus-T, both of whom might attempt to sponge and stall out physical attacks. It also 2HKOes Hippowdon, eliminating the need to use Outrage on it.</p> <p>Maximized Attack and Speed with either nature allows Kyurem-B to hit hard and fast as possible. While Kyurem-B can reach its maximum offensive potential with an Adamant nature, a Jolly nature allows it to outrun and beat certain threats before they can cripple or attack it. Assuming maximum Speed, such targets include Ninetales, Rotom-W, Haxorus, Hydreigon, Lucario, and opposing Kyurem. While both natures lower the power of Ice Beam, it is still powerful enough to OHKO its small selection of targets, so one need not worry about using a hindering nature.</p> <p>For better or worse, the technical fun doesn't stop here! Thanks to Kyurem-B's naturally high Attack stat, one might choose to invest in a stat other than Attack. While doing so takes away some power, it should be noted that with a neutral nature and zero investment, Kyurem-B boasts an Attack stat of 376, which is statistically more powerful than a fully invested Jolly Salamence or Terrakion. That being said, creative liberties can be taken with the EV distribution. For instance, a spread of 252 HP / 96 Atk / 28 Def / 60 SpD / 72 Spe with an Adamant nature allows Kyurem-B to survive a list of specific attacks at full health: an unboosted Terrakion's Close Combat, Focus Blasts coming from Choice Specs Tornadus and Life Orb Thundurus-T, a Secret Sword from Choice Specs Keldeo, and two Hydro Pumps from Choice Specs Politoed. Surviving these attacks, of course, requires entry hazards to be removed, so Rapid Spin support is mandatory with this spread. Outside of this, Kyurem-B's Speed can also be modified to beat a specific Speed tier. A good benchmark is 148 Speed EVs, which beats max Speed Adamant Dragonite and Jolly Breloom. One can even opt to not invest in either Attack or Speed at all, and instead invest in either Defense or Special Defense to create a bulky, hard-hitting tank. Even with the lowered Speed, Kyurem-B is still fast enough to outrun many defensive threats, so one shouldn't be afraid to get creative with EVs.</p> <p>There are a couple of ways to use this set depending on the team's playstyle, but as odd as it might sound, it is often best played in a reckless manner. A STAB Outrage or Dragon Claw coming from Choice Band Kyurem-B will obviously rip a few holes, so using these moves early-game could significantly soften the opponent's team. Even if Kyurem-B gets revenge killed, it has likely already done its job by eliminating or weakening a significant part of the other team. If Team Preview shows physically defensive Steel-types or potential revenge killers, it is probably best to play it safe and abstain from Outrage unless using it is absolutely necessary. Unlike other sets, Rapid Spin support and Steel-type trapping aren't totally necessary (but still very helpful) due to this set's reckless nature and sheer power. It is still recommended to pack offensive support against Steel-types like Ferrothorn or Skarmory, since a misprediction could fatally spoil Kyurem-B's wallbreaking streak.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Substitute Shuffler",
        "description": "<p>Considering Kyurem-B's hyper offensive nature, it's not hard to raise an eyebrow at this set. One shouldn't be quick to dismiss it, however; with the massive amount of defensive and even offensive threats that have trouble hurting Kyurem-B, this set can potentially become a major menace and annoyance, especially to stall and balanced teams. The game plan is as follows: Kyurem-B should switch into a threat that can't damage it heavily (preferably a Water-, Grass- or Electric-type, or a Pokemon locked into one move), then use Substitute to prevent dire damage and status. From there, Kyurem-B can do one of two things: use Roost to heal off damage and stall the opposition, or set up and attack with Hone Claws and Dragon Tail. With one boost up its sleeve, Dragon Tail becomes perfectly accurate and more deadly, despite the negative priority and the possible presence of Steel-types. Ice Beam can be used over Hone Claws if Substitute + Protect Gliscor proves to be a problem, and can be used as a secondary attack if Dragon Tail's negative priority is disadvantageous. Keep in mind that Kyurem-B is usually faster than common phazers such as Skarmory, Heatran, and Gyarados; therefore, Kyurem-B's Dragon Tail will hit and force the opponent out first if both parties use a phazing move on the same turn.</p> <p>This Kyurem-B should always operate behind a Substitute if possible to avoid being revenge killed or crippled by Trick or status. If the opponent successfully switches to a check with Kyurem-B not behind a Substitute, it is highly advised to abandon the boosts and switch out immediately. If behind one, however, simply use Dragon Tail to phaze it, badly disrupting the other team's momentum. This is especially deadly on a team utilizing multiple entry hazards, ensuring Kyurem-B's checks and counters won't live very long if switched in carelessly.</p> <p>The EV spread is a specialized recipe that discourages substitutions and deviations; specifically, it prevents Kyurem-B's Substitutes from being broken by specific attacks. The given Speed EVs allow Kyurem-B to outrun max Speed neutral-natured Breloom and Politoed, but 16 EVs can be relocated from Defense to Speed to outrun Jolly Tyranitar. If Ice Beam is used, a Sassy nature must be used to preserve its power. If such is the case, a spread of 252 HP / 92 Def / 136 SpD / 28 Spe should allow Kyurem-B to at least outrun 0 Speed Rotom-W and use Substitute before it can burn with Will-O-Wisp. Below is a list of calculations demonstrating how monstrous this Kyurem-B's bulk really is:</p> <ul> <li>0 SpA Heatran Lava Plume vs. 252 HP / 136+ SpD Kyurem-B: 20.48 - 24.44% <li>252 SpA Life Orb Starmie Ice Beam vs. 252 HP / 136+ SpD Kyurem-B: 21.14 - 25.11%</li> <li>0 SpA Starmie Psyshock vs. 252 HP / 64 Def Kyurem-B: 17.84 - 21.14%</li> <li>0 SpA Politoed Ice Beam vs. 252 HP / 136+ SpD Kyurem-B: 11.89 - 14.09%</li> <li>252+ SpA Life Orb Celebi Earth Power vs. 252 HP / 136+ SpD Kyurem-B: 22.24 - 26.43%</li> <li>252 SpA Choice Specs Jolteon Signal Beam vs. 252 HP / 136+ SpD Kyurem-B: 20.7 - 24.44%</li> <li>252 SpA Choice Specs Keldeo Secret Sword vs. 252 HP / 64 Def Kyurem-B: 85.9 - 100.88%</li> <li>252 Atk Choice Scarf Terrakion Close Combat vs. 252 HP / 64 Def Kyurem-B: 80.61 - 95.15%</li> </ul> <p>As with all Kyurem-B sets, this one suffers from passive damage, but even more so because of its reliance on Substitute. If Toxic Spikes are present and Kyurem-B becomes poisoned, the poison damage will limit the amount of free time Kyurem-B has to cycle between Substitute, Roost, and Dragon Tail. Therefore, it is highly advised to pair it with a grounded Poison-type to absorb the Toxic Spikes if Rapid Spin support is unavailable. Nidoqueen certainly stands out because it offers additional defensive support in the form of Toxic Spikes, Stealth Rock, and its valuable resistances to the Rock- and Fighting-type attacks aimed at Kyurem-B. Tentacruel is still a good choice in this case as it offers Rapid Spin support to fend off other hazards besides Toxic Spikes. Sandstorm is also detrimental towards Kyurem-B's survival, so pairing it up with either Drizzle Politoed (to reduce damage from Fire-type attacks) or Abomasnow (to add to the amount of damage non-Ice-types will take) can instantly solve the problem.</p> <p>As mentioned before, this set can be very deadly if used in conjunction with entry hazards, even though it doesn't need them most of the time. Skarmory is a prime candidate to consider, being able to lay out multiple layers of hazards early-game without much trouble. Notably, Skarmory can also take on several Kyurem-B checks and counters comfortably. Forretress is another hazard user that offers a valuable resistance to Dragon-type moves, in addition to Rapid Spin support. For an odd yet exceptionally viable twist on teammates, Golurk (of all things) fares very well with this set; not only does it counter Terrakion thanks to its convenient typing, but it can also set up Stealth Rock and attract Water- and Grass-type attacks for Kyurem-B to switch into.</p> "

        "name": "Specially Based Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This is arguably Kyurem-B's most powerful set, capable of bringing down nearly any threat it comes across thanks to its high offensive stats and coverage in four moveslots. Many physical walls coming in to sponge a predicted Fusion Bolt or Dragon-type move will find themselves getting heavily damaged--if not OHKOed--by a strong special attack. This set doesn't need to stay on the battlefield for long; it only needs a couple of chances to switch in and destroy any opposition, so it's almost entirely self-reliant.</p> <p>Ice Beam is the main move due to STAB and its fantastic coverage against common Grass-, Ground-, and Dragon-types in OU. Threats that resist Ice Beam, especially Steel-types, should be covered by Earth Power and/or Hidden Power Fire. Earth Power is mainly for KOing Jirachi and Heatran, while Hidden Power Fire ensures Kyurem-B can safely dispatch Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Scizor outside of the rain. Draco Meteor is worth considering because of the massive power it offers, and using it also allows Kyurem-B to use a Dragon-type move without resorting to Outrage. It can replace either Earth Power or Hidden Power Fire if either is unnecessary. The last slot is reserved for a physical Dragon-type move; Outrage powers through several specially defensive Pokemon, especially Blissey, Chansey, and Gastrodon among others. Dragon Claw is the next best alternative, but has notably less power against Chansey and requires a Life Orb to make up for a loss in power.</p> <p>Since this set is specially based and Kyurem-B's Attack is already naturally high, it simply requires maximized Special Attack and Speed to do the job. The nature is a matter of power versus Speed; if outrunning threats such as Haxorus, Hydreigon, Ninetales, and Jolly Lucario is mandatory, choose the Hasty nature. Otherwise, the Mild nature is preferred for maximum offensive potential. Investing a slight amount of EVs in Attack will not gain any new KOs of note. A sturdier alternative for this set is 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 Spe with a Modest nature, which makes Kyurem-B significantly more bulky at the cost of physical power and Speed (now being only able to outrun Adamant Mamoswine and Dragonite). Other boosting items include Draco Plate and Expert Belt, both of which increase Kyurem-B's attacking power without depleting its health. A Chople Berry, Babiri Berry, or Haban Berry allows Kyurem-B to lure in certain attackers (such as Keldeo, Breloom, Scizor, and Salamence), survive their attacks, and retaliate with the appropriate move at the cost of attacking power. Using any of these items makes for an efficient offensive bluff. As for attacking moves, Fusion Bolt can go over the options in the third slot as an alternative physical attack without spamming Dragon Claw or Outrage, although at this point Kyurem-B is better off using its physically based sets. Its main benefit is hitting defensive Water-types hard without having to resort to the less effective Outrage. Roost compromises coverage, but allows Kyurem-B to live longer, especially as it is easily worn down by entry hazards and Life Orb recoil. Finally, Focus Blast is a nice coverage option to hit Ferrothorn in the rain and OHKO all Tyranitar not holding a Chople Berry.</p> <p>This set aims to debilitate integral parts of the opposing team before switching out or fainting. To make its job easier and increase its longevity, Rapid Spin support is beneficial, so Starmie, Tentacruel, and Forretress are still good teammates. Additionally, if Kyurem-B uses one of the resistance Berries, it can be paired with offensive partners that appreciate the removal of certain Pokemon from the game. Keep in mind that using these Berries isn't necessarily the best way to get rid of threats, so having alternative ways to deal with Salamence, Terrakion, Keldeo, and other revenge killers would be ideal.</p> "

        "name": "Physically Based Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This is yet another mixed attacking set, which aims to break down a different selection of targets with dedicated investment in Attack and a different set of moves. Thanks to the increased power of physical attacks, Dragon Claw, Outrage, and Fusion Bolt are the main moves, while special attacks should only be used when required. Fusion Bolt notably 2HKOes common defensive Steel-types, especially specially defensive Jirachi and Heatran, eliminating the need for Earth Power. Dragon Claw by itself is already powerful enough to dent, if not OHKO, most non-Steel-types, so it is generally favored over Outrage despite the power difference. Using Outrage allows Kyurem-B to always net an OHKO on all Blissey, and often 2HKO some Steel-types despite their resistance to it. This, of course, comes at the cost of freedom, leaving Kyurem-B vulnerable to revenge killers and healthy Steel-types. As for special attacks, Ice Beam is still a required option, because, even without investment, it OHKOes many physically defensive Ground-types and can still muscle past all variants of Celebi.</p> <p>The last slot is up to preference and team support. Since this set is physically based, Ferrothorn and Forretress wall Kyurem-B more easily, making Hidden Power Fire a good option to deal with them outside of the rain. With proper prediction, it also kills off its arch-nemesis Scizor on the switch-in. This set also suffers residual damage from Life Orb recoil and entry hazards, which Roost can easily patch up at a moment's notice. Due to its good resistances and fearsome offensive presence, Kyurem-B can find many opportunities to heal off damage. Finally, Earth Power is still Kyurem-B's best weapon against Magnezone, which resists all three main attacks.</p> <p>The EVs are as simple as on the previous set; simply maximize Attack and Speed with either nature, depending on your preference for Speed or power. Even with minimal investment, Kyurem-B's Special Attack is still more than enough to KO the necessary threats. While the Lonely nature maximizes Kyurem-B's incredible physical offense, the Hasty nature allows it to potentially outrun and KO threats in odd Speed tiers. Such threats include max Speed Adamant Haxorus, Modest Hydreigon, Timid Rotom-W, Jolly Lucario, and the standard defensive Ninetales.</p> <p>The other items mentioned on the previous set are still usable here for situational instances, such as Haban Berry for luring in opposing Dragon-types. This set, however, relies heavily on the boost offered by Life Orb, especially considering that without it, 252/0 Jirachi cannot be 2HKOed by Fusion Bolt. As far as other moves are concerned, Dragon Tail is worth mentioning as it can stack up entry hazard damage on switch-ins, although Kyurem-B's general vulnerability, in combination with Dragon Tail's negative priority, makes this a lesser option. Blizzard, as always, can be used over Ice Beam if used in Hail, while Focus Blast hits Ferrothorn super effectively in any weather.</p> <p>While this set doesn't need much in terms of defensive support, keep in mind that due to its hyper offensive nature, it still heavily appreciates Rapid Spin users as it can be easily worn down. Starmie, Tentacruel, and Forretress are as usual the best choices for this because they sport decent defenses and a couple of resistances to common super effective attacks aimed at Kyurem-B. This Kyurem-B also notably functions best as a powerful early-game wallbreaker that should vaporize as many significant threats as possible. Sweepers and other offensive Pokemon that appreciate the elimination or weakening of walls include--but are definitely not limited to--Calm Mind Latias, Latios, Swords Dance Lucario, Keldeo, Jirachi, and Celebi. Notice that Kyurem-B pairs well with special sweepers in general due to its coverage, and that it doesn't necessarily have to stay alive for a majority of the match.</p> "

  "Keldeo": {
    "overview": "<p>With a great base 129 Special Attack and a good base 108 Speed, Keldeo has all the tools it needs to punch holes in opposing teams with relative ease. With Secret Sword, it becomes one of the only special attackers in the entire metagame capable of getting past Chansey and Blissey. While Keldeo has great coverage with its STAB moves, Hydro Pump and Secret Sword, it has a very shallow movepool. In fact, what walls Keldeo is usually determined solely by the moves it runs. Although Keldeo is usually limited to running its STABs and a Hidden Power of choice for coverage, it's not a one-trick pony. With a great boosting option in Calm Mind, the ability to run power-boosting items such as Life Orb or Choice Specs, and the ability to speed up with Choice Scarf, Keldeo can definitely wreak havoc on opposing teams while having the ability to fulfill multiple different roles.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Keldeo's other options are almost as shallow as its movepool. While Keldeo has access to a great boosting move in Swords Dance, its low base Attack doesn't do it many favors. Keldeo can also use Rain Dance to change the weather instantly (without provoking a weather war) and boost the power of Surf and Hydro Pump, though Drizzle Politoed does a better job at this because it can simply switch in and change the weather; not to mention Drizzle-induced rain is permanent. In short: if you aren't using one of the above sets, there is probably a Pokemon that you should be using instead of Keldeo.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Keldeo's counters are generally split into two groups: those that can wall it no matter what, and those that can wall some of its sets, but not all. Perhaps the best Keldeo counter out there is Slowking; despite its lower tier status, it remains a very effective way to always beat Keldeo (provided it runs Psyshock). However, other options to take down Keldeo do exist. Amoonguss does very well, and with Regenerator, it can constantly switch out to regain health. However, should Keldeo be behind a Substitute and have a sufficient amount of boosts to where Giga Drain will not break the Substitute, the Amoonguss user is in bad condition. The same applies to Celebi, as specially defensive versions with Perish Song completely shut down Keldeo; however, Celebi is ineffective against Keldeo that use Hidden Power Bug. Latias with Psyshock can generally switch into Keldeo, and with a 252 HP / 252 Spe spread and a Timid nature, it won't be 2HKOed by Keldeo's Choice Specs Icy Wind. For this reason, it remains a good check to Keldeo, but it won't be able to take on another Pokemon reliably after the skirmish. Jellicent is in the same boat—it's a great check to Keldeo as it is immune to both of Keldeo's STAB attacks with Water Absorb and can badly poison Keldeo with Toxic, but Keldeo can run Hidden Power Ghost to take on Jellicent, so one should be wary. It should be noted that Keldeo's SubCM set cannot touch Jellicent at all, though it can attempt to stall out the jellyfish.</p> <p>Keldeo has many more checks than counters, though. With a great base 108 Speed, one probably should wonder why—this is because there are many faster Choice Scarf Pokemon that can easily prey on our favorite pony's weaknesses, and with other faster threats looming, Keldeo cannot always sweep as quickly as it would like. Alakazam, Latios, and Starmie are great users of Psyshock that can get by Keldeo with ease, even if it happens to be at +6. Additionally, Tornadus outspeeds Keldeo, and with Hurricane, it can decimate it; Jolteon does the same with Thunder or Thunderbolt. Most dedicated revenge killers can get by Keldeo, including, but not limited to, Thundurus-T, Terrakion, and Rotom-W. However, one must keep in mind that most of these Pokemon cannot switch into Keldeo, and even though many resist Keldeo's attacks, rain-boosted, STAB, Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump will mercilessly annihilate all of them. Of course, most of these Pokemon are not checks to Keldeo at all if it chooses to carry a Choice Scarf, so one must be wary and scout out the Keldeo set before attempting to revenge kill it.</p> <p>Finally, a few more Pokemon can stand up to Keldeo's wrath. Even at +1, Roserade can OHKO Keldeo with Leaf Storm. Swords Dance Virizion can attack Keldeo's unboosted Defense with Leaf Blade, though Secret Sword will do a big chunk of damage should Keldeo win the Speed tie. Tentacruel with Toxic can wear down any Keldeo set except for SubCM set, which will actually beat Tentacruel. Similarly, Toxic Spikes do a number to hamper Keldeo's survivability, and the setup sweeper sets find it very hard to play through Toxic. Finally, Dragonite does well against Keldeo, but one always needs to be wary of Hidden Power Ice; also, one should remember that even though Dragonite resists Hydro Pump, Choice Specs and rain are two factors to keep in mind before attempting to tank!</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf equipped, Keldeo might lack the wallbreaking power of its other sets, but instead becomes a powerful revenge killer and late-game sweeper for use on rain teams. At 129, Keldeo has the highest base Special Attack stat of all Water-type Pokemon available in OU; this and its excellent Speed clearly make it the best Pokemon for the job. Though running both of its STAB moves together might seem strange, Keldeo really doesn't need to use much else, and doesn't have many other options anyway. Surf is the staple move, but often the additional power of Hydro Pump will be required to revenge kill a specific threat. Secret Sword is relatively weak, but it will help to deal with troublesome opponents such as Blissey, Chansey, and Ferrothorn, 2HKOing all three. Other than that, Keldeo has very few options besides Hidden Power. Hidden Power Ice is the best, as it allows Keldeo to revenge kill threats such as Dragonite, which it will outrun even after two Dragon Dances. Even when super effective, Hidden Power Ice is still not significantly more powerful than a resisted Hydro Pump in the rain, but it will hit targets such as Breloom more accurately, and is more effective against them outside of rain.</p> <p>As Keldeo tends only to spam Water-type attacks, a variety of other moves can be used in place of Hidden Power Ice, though none are frequently useful. Hidden Power Psychic mauls Toxicroak, which would otherwise completely wall Keldeo, while doing a little more to Tentacruel, Breloom, and Amoonguss. However, using this requires the use of a 30 Speed IV, causing you to lose out on a Speed tie with opposing Keldeo and Terrakion. Hidden Power Electric will OHKO all common Gyarados variants after Stealth Rock damage, and will do significantly more damage to Jellicent while Hidden Power Grass will do good damage to Gastrodon and the aforementioned Jellicent. Focus Blast could potentially be used for its good power, but won't break through Chansey and Blissey, which was part of the point of Secret Sword in the first place. Scald could be used for its spectacular secondary effect, while Toxic could be used to cripple some opposing walls (such as Jellicent). As far as support is concerned, Politoed should be the number one teammate; it provides the power that Keldeo really needs, even if it stacks up your team's weaknesses a bit. Other teammates should be used to remove Keldeo's hard counters, of which there are a fair few. Most critical are Jellicent, Amoonguss, and Tentacruel. Finally, it's worth supporting Keldeo with entry hazards, because they let Keldeo revenge kill Dragonite, and help to wear down Water-resistant Pokemon as you hit them with repeated Surfs and Hydro Pumps. If you manage to take down those few very troublesome Pokemon, not much can handle Keldeo's barrage of rain-boosted Water-type attacks.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Keldeo is meant to break down walls with its ruthlessly strong rain-boosted Hydro Pump. However, that's not to say it cannot sweep if all Pokemon on an opponent's team are slower than Keldeo, the immediate power granted by Choice Specs certainly can allow Keldeo to smash through teams. Generally, the move Keldeo will use most often is Hydro Pump, and Secret Sword provides a solid secondary STAB attack that allows Keldeo to rip through Ferrothorn and Chansey. The choice between Hidden Power Ghost and Hidden Power Electric is dependent on what your team needs; Hidden Power Ghost surprises Jellicent and hits Latios for heavy damage, but Hidden Power Electric can still hit Jellicent and take down opposing Water-types such as Politoed and Tentacruel. However, Hydro Pump hits most Water-type Pokemon hard even if they resist it, so one should take all relevant damage outputs into account before making a choice. Icy Wind in the last moveslot allows Keldeo to hit Latios that try and switch in super effectively, with the added effect of lowering their Speed. Surf provides a reliable STAB move to use late-game though, so the last moveslot depends on preference.</p> <p>Rain support really allows this set to shine, as it provides another boost to Keldeo's already-powerful STAB Hydro Pump. Even most Dragon-types that resist Water-type attacks will fall to Keldeo's onslaught. Because Keldeo will do a lot of switching as a result of being locked into one move, having a spinner to remove entry hazards is very helpful, though not always necessary as Spikes are not too common and Toxic Spikes are even less common. However, the durability of this set is greatly raised when one pairs it with a spinner such as Tentacruel or Excadrill, so Rapid Spin should always be considered. As far as other options go, Hidden Power Grass is viable to hit Gastrodon, but it doesn't really provide much other than that. The moveset is much looser for Choice Specs Keldeo than any other Keldeo set because it simply is supposed to break walls, so depending on the walls you need to remove, you can mix and match moves.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Toxic + Protect",
        "description": "<p>Toxic lets Keldeo punish and wear down many of its switch-ins like Latios, Jellicent, and Politoed. It's especially potent alongside the sandstorm that Tyranitar provides. Protect allows Keldeo to rack up Toxic and burn damage, scout Choice-locked moves, and, if sand isn't up, recover health with Leftovers. Scald lets Keldeo potentially cripple switch-ins immune to Toxic like Tentacruel and Amoonguss, and provides it with a spammable STAB attack that can still cripple other Pokemon. Secret Sword gives Keldeo a secondary STAB move and lets it punish switch-ins resistant to Scald and certain Toxic absorbers that Scald isn't effective against, like Ferrothorn and Chansey.</p> <p>Keep Keldeo healthy so it can check the Pokemon it's supposed to like Heatran, Gliscor, and Tyranitar. If you predict a switch to a Pokemon that hates taking a burn, but absorbs Toxic, such as Tentacruel and Amoonguss, use Scald on the switch to fish for a burn. However, if you predict your opponent to switch to a Pokemon that hates taking Toxic, use Toxic as they switch in. Try to keep sand up, as the chip damage it provides is part of what makes this set so hard to deal with in the first place. Get up entry hazards with a hazard setter when given the opportunity so you can further chip down the Pokemon that switch into Keldeo and make switching into Keldeo even harder. Don't use Protect on Pokemon that can take advantage of it, like Spikes or Stealth Rock Ferrothorn and Toxic Spikes or Substitute Tentacruel. Use Protect to scout what move a Pokemon potentially holding a Choice item will lock into as well as accumulate more residual damage alongside Toxic or burn.</p> <p>Tyranitar, especially the Chople Berry variant, is an excellent partner for Keldeo, since it can Pursuit trap many of Keldeo's checks and counters, like Latios, Alakazam, and Reuniclus, while getting up Sandstorm; as the chip damage it provides is a big component of what makes this set work to begin with. Tyranitar can also get Stealth Rock up to punish switch-ins further. Psychic-types like Reuniclus, Latios, and Alakazam can all punish Tentacruel and Amoonguss while appreciating the fact that Keldeo can check Tyranitar and Steel-types and the constant chip damage from sand and the status effects Keldeo can spread. Heatran beats Amoonguss, has good defensive synergy with Keldeo, and can even use Magma Storm to trap Pokemon as well as accrue additional chip in addition to status and sand. It also appreciates Keldeo checking Tyranitar and spreading status to make Pokemon faint to residual damage more quickly. Excadrill can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards, which helps Keldeo and its teammates come in much more easily while handling Jirachi and Reuniclus lacking Focus Blast. It benefits from Keldeo beating Ground- and Steel-types like Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Skarmory as well. Ferrothorn and Skarmory can get up Spikes, which punishes switch-ins even further on top of the residual damage that Keldeo generates. Ferrothorn switches into Latios and can even use Knock Off to remove potential Leftovers from the Pokemon that can switch into Keldeo, while Skarmory switches into Ground-types and prevents Spikes from going up on your side of the field with Taunt.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<p>While Choice sets are very effective on Keldeo, it is also excellent as an all-out attacker. The main advantage of this set is the ability to switch moves; this is huge, as Keldeo often needs to switch up moves in order to hit the foe for heavy damage and surprise them with its unexpected coverage attacks. Hydro Pump is devastating to almost all of Keldeo's foes, especially when boosted by rain, while Secret Sword allows Keldeo to nail Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and Chansey. For the Expert Belt set, it is highly recommended to use Hidden Power Grass as Keldeo's Hidden Power of choice. Hidden Power Grass can surprise Gastrodon and OHKO it; it also helps against Jellicent and Rotom-W, two common checks to Keldeo. Icy Wind fills the last slot so that Keldeo always has good coverage with which to hit Latios and Latias and to slow down faster threats, such as Starmie and Tornadus. It also provides a way to KO Landorus-T with less risk than Hydro Pump.</p> <p>There are a couple other options for the Hidden Power, namely Electric and Psychic. Hidden Power Electric's main use is to OHKO Gyarados while maintaining coverage versus Politoed and Jellicent. The latter gives Keldeo a way to hit Toxicroak and Tentacruel consistently. Surf is a decent choice over Hydro Pump if you really dislike the accuracy, but it does not pack the same raw power. Keldeo is a very good Pokemon in its own right, but there are a few support options that let Keldeo live up to its full potential. Politoed, while not mandatory, is certainly very helpful for Keldeo, as rain makes its Hydro Pump insanely powerful. Alternatively, Pursuit Tyranitar is helpful to take down Jellicent, Latias, and Latios. The most important support for this set is entry hazards. As you generally use Keldeo on offensive teams, reliable hazard setters, such as Ferrothorn, do the trick. One of the larger issues for sets lacking leftovers is entry hazards wearing it down, so a Rapid Spin user, such as Excadrill or Tentacruel, is recommended. Lastly, sweepers that do well against weakened teams, such as Garchomp, Thundurus-T, and Gyarados, make excellent partners, as this Keldeo excels at breaking down the opponent's team.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind allows Keldeo to boost its Special Attack to ridiculous levels, letting it muscle through common checks like Tentacruel and Politoed, more easily than other variants. Hydro Pump is the preferred Water-type STAB move on this set due to its greater power than Scald allowing it to net some notable KOs, specifically against Garchomp and Reuniclus. Secret Sword is a consistent Fighting-type STAB move that allows Keldeo to heavily damage specially defensive Pokemon like Chansey and Ferrothorn that can switch into Hydro Pump. For the last slot, Hidden Power Ghost or Hidden Power Dark is the preferred coverage move of choice due to the ability to hit both Gastrodon and Latios, two of Keldeo's most common checks. Hidden Power Dark has the added benefit of not lowering Keldeo's IVs in exchange for being less effective against fringe targets, namely Toxicroak. If Hydro Pump's poor accuracy is unappealing, Scald can be used instead as a more consistent STAB move that can cripple common answers to Keldeo like Amoonguss and Tentacruel with a burn, but the power decrease is quite noticeable. Substitute can be used over Hidden Power Ghost alongside Toxic Spikes from another teammate, but the lack of immediate power against Hidden Power Ghost's targets is very noticeable, specifically against Jellicent and Gastrodon. Alternatively, Hidden Power Grass can be run to hit Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Jellicent at the same time, but the coverage is sorely missed against Latios.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers increases Keldeo's longevity over the course of the match, counteracting damage taken from sand and entry hazards, allowing it to check Pokemon like Tyranitar and Gliscor more consistently. Alternatively, Lum Berry or Water Gem can be used to bluff a Choice Scarf set, making it easier to set up Calm Mind, and have their own useful effects in giving a buffer against status or a one-time powerful attack in rain.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is fairly straightforward, functioning as a wallbreaker that performs particularly well against balance teams. Use rain-boosted Hydro Pump and Secret Sword to wear down the opposing team early-game. Then, once the opposing team has been adequately weakened, send in Keldeo on a Pokemon that it threatens, such as Excadrill or Gliscor, and either use Calm Mind or Substitute on the switch or scout depending on the situation and sweep if possible. It should be noted that Calm Mind and Substitute can be used in a similar fashion early-game to break the opposing team, but they aren't necessarily as efficient as attacking in some of those situations, particularly because Keldeo's HP can be essential for checking key threats like Gliscor and Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Keldeo fits well on both rain and sand teams that want an effective wallbreaker to break down defensive Water- and Grass-types. Politoed makes for an excellent partner, as rain boosts Hydro Pump's power significantly and makes it very dangerous to switch into without an immunity. If using Substitute, Toxic Spikes Tentacruel is an amazing partner, as Toxic Spikes can wear down Pokemon like Jellicent and Gastrodon that are problematic for Keldeo to deal with otherwise. Agility Thundurus-T is an effective partner, as it appreciates Keldeo's ability to break down Grass-types like Amoonguss and Ferrothorn that would trouble it otherwise. If opting for a coverage move over Substitute, Keldeo fits particularly well on offensive sand teams due to its ability to punch holes in teams and put pressure on Latios, making Tyranitar less required to check it. Late-game cleaners like Calm Mind Reuniclus and Choice Scarf Garchomp also appreciate Keldeo's ability to punch holes in teams in general to make way for a potential sweep.</p> "
