Defog is an option, as Mega Charizard Y has a good matchup against common entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Heatran, but its extreme vulnerability to Stealth Rock along with it losing to hazard setters like Garchomp makes it an unreliable Defogger. It also dislikes giving up an important moveslot for it.</p> <h1>Mega Charizard X</h1> <p>On more offensive teams that do not require Mega Charizard X's longevity and defensive utility, you can remove Roost and use both Dragon Claw and Earthquake.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Mega Charizard Y</h1> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Stealth Rock halves Mega Charizard Y's health, severely limiting its ability to switch in and wallbreak.

The former two are particularly difficult to deal with due to their good bulk and access to recovery.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar are huge threats to Mega Charizard Y, as they can switch in and override sun with sand to weaken its STAB move and force Solar Beam to charge, and they then proceed to either KO it with their Rock-type moves or damage it as it tries to switch out with Pursuit. However, they must watch out for Scorching Sands burns and the rare Focus Blast. Pelipper is similarly dangerous, as it can switch in on Mega Charizard Y, override sun with rain, and proceed to either KO it with its Water-type moves or pivot out to a dangerous teammate.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex: Toxapex resists Fire while not being weak to Solar Beam, letting it check Mega Charizard Y well although Scorching Sands and Future Sight support threaten it to a degree.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Garchomp can revenge kill Mega Charizard Y; however, they, with the exception of Garchomp, cannot switch in on it at all.</p> <h1>Mega Charizard X</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Physically bulky Water-types like Slowbro, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini can take Mega Charizard X's STAB moves with ease and pressure it with their own STAB moves, but they must watch out for the rare Thunder Punch and, in Toxapex's case, Earthquake. Toxapex can also be 2HKOed by +1 Dragon Claw into Earthquake, while Tapu Fini is 2HKOed by +1 Flare Blitz after some chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Landorus-T can weaken Mega Charizard X with Intimidate and threaten it with Earthquake, forcing it to switch. Hippowdon can switch in and force Mega Charizard X out with Earthquake or phaze it, removing its boosts.

        "description": "<p>Mega Charizard Y is a ferocious wallbreaker in National Dex because of its sky high Special Attack stat, great ability in Drought, and passable Speed tier that lets it threaten much of the metagame. Drought sets Mega Charizard Y apart by boosting its Fire-type moves, weakening Water-type moves, ands also letting it use Solar Beam effectively, which makes it a Fire-type that is able to threaten out bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Slowking. Mega Charizard Y's typing and access to Roost let it check Pokemon like Rillaboom and Mega Scizor reliably throughout a game . Flamethrower has perfect accuracy and high PP, but Fire Blast has explosive power, easily OHKOing Landorus-T and possibly Zapdos as well as 2HKOing offensive Garchomp. Solar Beam complements Mega Charizard Y's STAB move well, severely denting bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and Slowbro that may try to switch in on Flamethrower or Fire Blast. Scorching Sands rounds off its coverage by OHKOing offensive Heatran while also 2HKOing physically defensive Toxapex after Stealth Rock, and its burn chance can ruin Tyranitar. Focus Blast is an option to replace Scorching Sands, notably hitting Tyranitar extremely hard while retaining the ability to smack Heatran. However, it has terrible accuracy and it also leaves Mega Charizard Y completely helpless against Toxapex without Future Sight support, so it is generally not advised. Roost lets Mega Charizard Y heal off residual damage and check Pokemon like Rillaboom throughout the game. A Timid nature is chosen to outspeed Pokemon like non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Hydreigon, and Tapu Lele.</p> <p>Mega Charizard Y absolutely hates Stealth Rock, as its health is halved by it, so good Defoggers like Corviknight, Zapdos, and Synthesis Kartana are absolutely mandatory partners for it. Blissey and Chansey are also huge thorns in Mega Charizard Y's side, as it cannot 2HKO them due to their massive special bulk, so Pokemon like Swords Dance Gliscor and Kartana that can take advantage of them are good partners. Heatran is also a good choice to trap and remove them. Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar, Weavile, and Aegislash can greatly pressure Mega Latias, which can potentially use Mega Charizard Y as setup fodder, and also force damage onto Blissey. Mega Charizard Y struggles with Toxapex, especially if running Focus Blast, so Slowbro and Slowking can pressure it with Future Sight and Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Heatran can beat it directly. Due to Mega Charizard Y's only passable Speed tier, it is prone to getting revenge killed by faster threats like Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny, so pivots like the aforementioned Slowbro and Blissey can both switch in on these Pokemon and give it free switches via slow pivoting. Similarly, faster pivots like Tapu Koko can lure in bulky Grass-types like Ferrothorn that give Mega Charizard Y free turns while also helping wear down their shared checks, like Blissey. Due to how prolific Mega Charizard Y is as a wallbreaker, late-game cleaners Kartana make good partners for it, as it can break through their checks like Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Entry hazard support from the likes of Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Garchomp helps force damage onto Mega Charizard Y's checks, mainly Toxapex, as it can 2HKO it with Scorching Sands after Stealth Rock.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Mega Charizard X is a dangerous wallbreaker and setup sweeper thanks to its near-unresisted STAB combination that is further boosted by Tough Claws and Dragon Dance. At +1, Mega Charizard X outspeeds Choice Scarf users below base 100 Speed such as Landorus-T and Tapu Lele. Its typing lets it switch in on and force out common Steel- and Grass-types such as Corviknight, Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Rillaboom, granting it setup opportunities. Flare Blitz deals serious damage to common Ground-types such as Gliscor and Landorus-T. Dragon Claw is preferable in the second moveslot to not be walled by other Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Mega Latias. However, this leaves it walled by Heatran and more easily checked by Mega Diancie and Tyranitar. Earthquake provides a way to hit Toxapex, and Steel-types weak to it such as Excadrill and Magnezone without taking recoil from Flare Blitz, while also OHKOing Heatran and Mega Diancie after a Dragon Dance and 2HKOing Mega Tyranitar after Stealth Rock. Thunder Punch could be used to hit bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Pelipper more effectively, but it gives worse neutral coverage. Roost recovers HP lost from Flare Blitz recoil and residual damage, letting Mega Charizard X check Grass-types like Rillaboom more easily. A Jolly nature is better to outspeed Pokemon below base 100 Speed like Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, Hydreigon and Kyurem.</p> <p>Mega Charizard X functions as a early- or mid-game wallbreaker that can take advantage of Steel- and Grass-types such as Corviknight, Mega Scizor, Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn, which benefits Pokemon like Rillaboom, Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Tapu Koko. In return, they can pressure some of its checks like Slowbro, Tapu Fini, Toxapex, Tyranitar, and Mega Diancie. Due to Charizard's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock prior to Mega Evolving, entry hazard removers such as Zapdos, Corviknight, and Tapu Fini are mandatory partners. Tapu Fini can also protect Mega Charizard X from status through Misty Terrain, giving it more opportunities to setup Dragon Dance. Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp, Clefable, and Gliscor chip some of boosted Mega Charizard X's answers; offensive Landorus-T turns from a decent check to a likely OHKO, Toxapex becomes a likely 2HKO, and Tapu Fini becomes a guaranteed 2HKO. Garchomp can also break through Landorus-T and Gliscor with its Z-Move to help Mega Charizard X sweep. Due to its Ground weakness after Mega Evolving, checks to Ground-types like Rillaboom, Tangrowth, and Corviknight make good teammates, with the latter also providing Defog support and Rillaboom pressuring common checks like Tapu Fini, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Slowbro. It's important to note that Rillaboom's and Tapu Fini's terrains make Earthquake and Dragon Claw too weak to use, respectively.</p> "

Calm Mind makes it an extremely potent Pokemon against bulky teams that do not have a way of preventing it from setting up freely. Thunder is largely preferred over Thunderbolt because of its extremely high paralysis chance, letting Clefable cripple Pokemon such as Heatran, and its ability to easily 2HKO Toxapex without any Calm Mind boosts. Alternatively, Flamethrower hits Steel-types that annoy Clefable like Excadrill, Mega Mawile, Melmetal, and Mega Scizor, but Clefable's easily walled by Heatran and Toxapex without Thunder.

Calm Mind makes Clefable a much bigger threat and potential wincon while also allowing it to threaten Defoggers such as Zapdos and Tapu Fini more effectively to keep Stealth Rock up. Knock Off allows Clefable to cripple a vast majority of Pokemon, such as Zapdos, Ferrothorn, opposing Clefable, and Heatran. Alternatively, Thunder Wave provides speed control and still lets Clefable cripple Pokemon that want to switch in, such as Mega Scizor and Heatran.

Calm Mind allows Clefable to be a potential wincon for stall teams. Flamethrower allows Clefable to hit Pokemon that resist Moonblast such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight very hard.

However, it's typically not worth forgoing the defensive utility to run this set, as it still cannot break through threats like Mega Scizor, Heatran, and Galarian Slowking, and hail teams usually pack more than enough offensive pressure. A set dedicated to setting Aurora Veil can be used on hyper offense teams, as Alolan Ninetales can provide immediate dual screens support unlike other Pokemon, which have to set Light Screen and Reflect separately, but it is generally a much worse dual screens setter than Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl, as it has no way to prevent Defog.

However, Alolan Ninetales is extremely weak and has terrible bulk, which is further exacerbated by its horrid Stealth Rock weakness.

Aurora Veil allows Alolan Ninetales to provide increased opportunities to switch in for teammates like Arctozolt, as well as let partners like Volcanion and Corviknight more comfortably check threats such as Heatran and Mega Medicham. Pain Split serves the dual purpose of providing Alolan Ninetales with a form of recovery to aid its poor longevity so that it can more consistently provide Hail support and wearing down bulkier teams due to its low HP stat. Encore prevents threats like Mega Latias and Clefable from taking advantage of its passivity, as well as letting teammates like Arctozolt, Volcanion, and Mega Diancie switch in unpunished. Freeze-Dry is a solid STAB option that allows Alolan Ninetales to threaten Ground- and Water-types and prevent the likes of Gastrodon, Pelipper, and Gliscor from completely taking advantage of it.

Volcanion in particular checks Ash-Greninja together with Alolan Ninetales thanks to its immunity to Water. Finally, Alolan Ninetales's severe weakness to Stealth Rock basically mandates extremely strong entry hazard control.

Ice Beam is another option that lets Slowbro threaten Ground-types such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T better, but causes it to struggle to check other physical attackers. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Slowbro ignore damage from entry hazards, which is key in keeping it healthy throughout longer games. It can also run Rocky Helmet to punish physical attackers like Mega Medicham, Urshifu-R, and Mega Lopunny, but this makes its longevity much worse. A Relaxed nature with 0 Speed EVs ensures the slowest possible Teleport, guaranteeing a speed tie in Teleport mirrors against opposing Slowbro and Slowking.</p> <p>Slowbro tends to fit on bulky offense builds, where it can be paired with other Pokemon with pivoting moves, such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, and Corviknight. Fast and frail wallbreakers such as Tapu Koko, Ash-Greninja, Weavile, and Kartana appreciate Slowbro pivoting them onto the field safely and providing Future Sight support, which lets them more easily KO their checks like Landorus-T, Toxapex, Corviknight, and Tangrowth. Due to Slowbro's weakness to Electric-types such as Magnezone and Tapu Koko, pairing it up with Ground- and Grass-types that can switch into these Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth makes for a solid defensive backbone. Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Assault Vest Tangrowth deserve a special mention, as they are able to check Ash-Greninja, which Slowbro tends to let in for free. Pokemon that resist Dark such as Clefable and Kommo-o make for good teammates, as they're able to switch into Dark-type moves from the likes of Tyranitar, Greninja, and Hydreigon, which threaten Slowbro. Lastly, Blissey forms a stellar defensive core alongside Slowbro, as its ability to switch into special attacks directed at Slowbro, alongside its access to Teleport, lets these two cover most offensive Pokemon while keeping up momentum.</p> "

However, it faces heavy competition for the Mega slot on hyper offense teams from Mega Gyarados, Mega Garchomp, and Mega Scizor, which are much better because they bring defensive utility to a team, whereas Mega Pinsir has next to none. It also cannot hit all of the metagame for significant damage at once, as it only has room for one coverage move; Close Combat variants are walled by Zapdos, while Stone Edge variants struggle with Steel-types such as Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Melmetal.

Mega Pinsir's unfortunate Speed tier also leaves it outpaced by several common Pokemon that survive even a +2 Quick Attack; Mega Latias, Kartana, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, and Jirachi all fall into this category. Mega Pinsir's horrible 4x weakness to Stealth Rock also complicates matters, as it can require a lot of support and careful play to get around.

However, Galarian Zapdos faces stiff competition from other wallbreakers and sweepers like Mega Pinsir and Hawlucha, which have a better setup move in Swords Dance and better Speed. Additionally, as a Defog punisher, it's outclassed by Bisharp and Serperior, with the former having priority to deal with faster foes an the latter having better support moves and offensive utility. Bulk Up makes it difficult to revenge kill Galarian Zapdos with common priority moves like Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch and Mega Lopunny's Fake Out. Substitute ensures safe setup opportunities, while Taunt can be used to prevent Haze or Toxic from Toxapex and Whirlwind from Hippowdon. Thunderous Kick and Brave Bird provide great coverage only resisted by Zapdos, Tapu Koko, and Aegislash. Flyinium Z provides a strong Supersonic Skystrike that, at +1, ensures an OHKO on Tapu Fini, Clefable, Tapu Koko, and Toxapex, though the latter two need some chip damage to be OHKOed. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Pokemon below base 100 Speed like Kyurem, Landorus-T, and Mega Garchomp.</p> <p>Galarian Zapdos fits best on hyper offense teams with teammates that appreciate a wallbreaker that can weaken Corviknight and Zapdos like Rillaboom and Mega Scizor. Entry hazard support from Landorus-T or Mew is vital for Galarian Zapdos to get important KOs against certain foes like Mega Scizor and Toxapex. Since Galarian Zapdos isn't very bulky, dual screens support from Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko help it find setup opportunities. Zapdos is a big problem for Galarian Zapdos, so teammates that weaken or KO it like Mega Gyarados and Rillaboom are great teammates as well. Galarian Zapdos really appreciates Sticky Web support so it can outspeed revenge killers such as Ash-Greninja and Tapu Koko and punish Defog attempts from Corviknight and Zapdos; consequently, Shuckle is a phenomenal teammate, as it sets both Sticky Web and Stealth Rock.</p> "

A plethora of Pokemon it wants to check, such as Mega Mawile, Kartana, Rillaboom, and Mega Scizor, often carry Knock Off, which Moltres does not want to switch into, as it relies heavily on its Heavy-Duty Boots to avoid its crippling Stealth Rock weakness, making it a poor check in the long run. Mystical Fire allows Moltres to check Mega Charizard Y and Calm Mind Clefable more easily. Scorching Sands is a fantastic coverage move, as it notably 2HKOes Heatran and can also punish Garchomp and Mega Tyranitar due to its burn chance. Flame Body is chosen to cripple physical attackers like Rillaboom, Kartana, Mega Scizor, and U-turn from Corviknight and Mega Lopunny.

Furthermore, it also sports a solid defensive typing, as well as really good overall bulk, which allows it to pivot into Pokemon like Kartana, Greninja, and Landorus-T and live super effective and strong attacks like Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt, Mega Lopunny's Close Combat, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's Moonblast. However, Galarian Moltres has faults which limit its capabilities to be consistent throughout a match, such as its Stealth Rock weakness, being relatively weak without a boost, and its mediocre Speed stat before an Agility boost that leaves it outsped by the likes of Kartana, Tapu Lele, and Mega Lopunny. Its lack of recovery also means that it is easily worn down and can't always take advantage of its bulk. Taunt allows it to use would-be checks like Toxapex and Blissey as setup fodder and break past Unaware Clefable to ease the stall matchup.

Fiery Wrath provides Galarian Moltres with a consistent STAB option, hitting common Flying-type resistant Pokemon like Corviknight, Heatran, and Zapdos.

Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp are stellar teammates, as they can absorb the Electric-types attacks from Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Zapdos that Galarian Moltres brings in. Lastly, due to Galarian Moltres's lack of consistent recovery and weakness to Stealth Rock, pivots like Corviknight, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W are excellent partners that can help bring it in safely.</p> "

However, it tends to falter against many common defensive Pokemon, such as Slowking, Corviknight, and Heatran, and is generally outclassed as a setup sweeper by the likes of Tapu Lele, Hydreigon, and Reuniclus. Meanwhile, Body Press gives Mew a way to pressure both Dark-types and Heatran in one slot. Furthermore, Toxic lets Mew wear down the likes of Zapdos, Hydreigon, and Mega Latias. However, these options tend to be less useful than the other options Mew has available. Flare Blitz can be great on the suicide lead set for preventing Excadrill from removing hazards through Rapid Spin while also helping Mew KO itself, but its use outside of pressuring Excadrill is pretty barren, making it a worse option than Explosion overall. Skill Swap can be used over Explosion to let Mew set entry hazards against Magic Bounce users such as Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie, although it's generally an extremely fringe option due to them being very uncommon. Focus Sash can be used over Red Card to guarantee one layer of hazards.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-types such as Ash-Greninja, Hydreigon, Tyranitar, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar are able to threaten Mew out with their STAB moves.

Ice Beam allows Mew to threaten various Ground-types, notably Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Mega Garchomp, while also letting it hit Rillaboom.

Will-O-Wisp lets Mew punish physical attackers like Tyranitar, Urshifu-R, Weavile, and Melmetal while also punishing Corviknight attempting to Defog on it. Taunt lets it prevent Defog attempts from Corviknight and Tapu Fini and block status-inflicting and recovery moves from the likes of Blissey, Toxapex, and Clefable. Knock Off lets Mew force progress by removing opposing held items, notably Heavy-Duty Boots, making its Spikes matter more in the long term, as well as Leftovers from the likes of Heatran and Tapu Fini. Rocky Helmet is the preferred item choice, as it allows Mew to punish Mega Medicham, Weavile, and Mega Swampert. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to let Mew ignore opposing entry hazards. However, Leftovers's passive recovery aids Mew in staying healthy. Mew can also use a Colbur Berry to either absorb Knock Off from the likes of Kartana and Mega Mawile or safely switch out of Pursuit from foes like Mega Tyranitar and Weavile.

While Mew is able to soft check physical attackers such as Mega Garchomp, Excadrill, and Hawlucha, it's quite easily overwhelmed and appreciates having teammates to form a defensive backbone with it; Toxapex, Gliscor, and Corviknight are able to help relieve some pressure for Mew. Additionally, these cores appreciate Mew's ability to consistently handle Mega Medicham for them.

Priority from the likes of Rillaboom, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny also presents issues, while Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain removes Aqua Jet from the equation entirely. Chip damage from Iron Barbs and Rocky Helmet doesn't help either, as it can quickly wear down Azumarill into range of other priority users. While Azumarill can break through and OHKO slow Water-resistant Pokemon like Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth after Stealth Rock damage, these Pokemon are often paired with teammates that can deal with Azumarill more naturally, such as faster Water-resistant Pokemon like Mega Latias and Kartana or powerful priority users like Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham. These drawbacks leave Azumarill as a very inconsistent sweeper with no real niche in the metagame.</p> <p>Z-Belly Drum fully heals Azumarill before its use, ensuring Azumarill receives the boost and therefore giving it its best shot at potentially sweeping opposing teams. If your team already has a Z-Move user, Sitrus Berry is an option that can give Azumarill a bit more health after setting up in a best-case scenario, but such scenarios are quite rare, and the loss of health from Belly Drum makes it much harder for Azumarill to find opportunities to set up while also preventing it from effectively checking Weavile and Ash-Greninja. Knock Off is the preferred last move in order to OHKO Toxapex and Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock damage. This set works best on hyper offense and rain teams, as Azumarill can theoretically work as an early-game wallbreaker on hyper offense, while rain significantly boosts the power of Aqua Jet and gives it more favorable rolls against threats like Zapdos and Garchomp, which can make it easier for Azumarill to sweep via giving Aqua Jet. However, both playstyles have far better options available to them; hyper offense can utilize numerous other, more consistent sweepers, such as Kommo-o, Rillaboom, and Volcarona, while Mega Swampert, Ash-Greninja, and Manaphy are all far superior rain sweepers.</p> "

Encore is vital because it can lock foes into Defog or a stat-boosting move, such as Corviknight, Zapdos, Rillaboom, and Mega Garchomp, allowing Shuckle to more easily set up hazards while also making it easy for its teammates to revenge kill them. Mental Herb is the item of choice for Shuckle to securely set up at least one hazard, as it is very susceptible to Taunt from Pokemon such as Grimmsnarl, Tapu Koko, and Mew; however, that can be replaced with Red Card, which can force out strong attackers and disrupt U-turn and Volt Switch from Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Rillaboom, and Landorus-T. Bisharp is an essential teammate for Shuckle, as Defiant helps it easily deter Defoggers such as Corviknight and Zapdos, and it's a very threatening wallbreaker and setup sweeper. Serperior's Contrary also pressures Defog. Shuckle's Sticky Web support heavily supports a multitude of slow yet powerful wallbreakers, such as Thundurus-T, Mega Scizor, and Mega Heracross.</p> "

Spikes helps wear down the opposing team and makes it easier for Skarmory’s teammates to sweep.

Clefable can check dangerous setup sweepers that threaten Skarmory like Mega Heracross and Mega Latias thanks to Unaware.

Teleport allows it to safely pivot in teammates like Ash-Greninja, Mega Medicham, and Mega Mawile and take advantage of the many switches that it forces; Blissey's ability to viably hold Heavy-Duty Boots also makes it hard to wear down via entry hazards, unlike its pre-evolution Chansey. Toxic allows Blissey to chip away at threats such as Mega Latias, Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Zapdos. Targeting Mega Latias is especially important, as Blissey is one of the few Pokemon that can reliably come in on it and cripple it in the long term with Toxic. It must be noted, however, that Toxic forces Blissey to use Teleport more often, as it invites Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Corviknight, Aegislash, and Kartana to easily pivot in. Thunder Wave is another good choice for the last move, as it allows Blissey to effectively cripple offensive Pokemon like Mega Mawile and Kartana. It also gives Blissey a weapon against a couple of the select few special attackers that otherwise handily beat Blissey, such as Alakazam, Reuniclus, a reckless Gengar on the switch, and Calm Mind Clefable. Stealth Rock can be run over a status move if your team can't fit a Stealth Rock setter elsewhere, but Blissey is even more passive than normal without Toxic or Thunder Wave and can easily be taken advantage of by threats such as Mega Latias, Corviknight, and Aegislash.</p> <p>Blissey finds its home on balanced and bulky offensive teams. There it should be used to pivot into threats such as Heatran and Ash-Greninja and regain momentum with Teleport while also spreading status. Blissey really hates powerful physical attackers like Garchomp, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Medicham. A physically bulky partner is therefore appreciated. Slowbro and its Mega Evolution are very solid switch-ins to Fighting-type attacks, are capable of checking many of the tier's physical attackers, and can also form a very strong double Teleport core with Blissey. Corviknight effectively rounds out the Slowbro + Blissey core, taking on the likes of Kartana, Mega Scizor, Rillaboom, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar, as well as offering Defog support and additional pivoting support with U-turn. Zapdos is another option that meets the previously mentioned positives bar checking Weavile and Mega Tyranitar, and it can also provide pivoting support with Volt Switch if desired. Toxapex can also handle Mega Lopunny and can beat other powerful physical attackers that Blissey dislikes like Mega Scizor and Mega Mawile. Blissey's Teleport makes it a very solid pivot, which is appreciated by Pokemon like Mega Medicham, Greninja, and Weavile. The latter two are also capable of revenge killing Gengar, a special attacker that completely shuts down Blissey, with Weavile in particular heavily limiting additional threats such as Mega Medicham with Pursuit. Physical walls, such as Landorus-T and Toxapex, appreciate Blissey taking on special attackers they can't handle, such as Ash-Greninja, Heatran, and Tapu Koko. Thunder Wave variants of Blissey can also be paired with slower wallbreakers that appreciate the paralysis support, such as Mega Mawile, Garchomp, Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Heracross. Toxic variants of Blissey dislike Steel-types, with Landorus-T, Victini, and Garchomp helping out in that category.</p> "

Stone Edge is Tyranitar’s main STAB move, being extremely hard to switch into due to its sheer power. Crunch is Tyranitar’s most spammable move due to the tiers‘s lack of sturdy Dark-resistant Pokemon, and it also KOes Pokemon like Mega Latias and Slowbro that can live a Stone Edge comfortably and retaliate. Pursuit lets Tyranitar trap Ghost- and Psychic-types that it forces out, such as Aegislash and Mega Latias.

Earthquake lets Mega Tyranitar nail Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Magnezone without dropping its Attack and Defense, and it gives it near-perfect neutral coverage.

Tapu Lele is much more useful in matchups outside of bulky teams while still maintaining the ability to tear down balance teams, has the ability to hold items to further increase its power, and boasts a stronger Psychic-type STAB attack under Psychic Terrain. Mega Gardevoir also is unable to outperform Clefable, Reuniclus, Tapu Fini, or Mega Latias as a Fairy- or Psychic-type Calm Mind sweeper, due to their respective individual advantages over it such as an immunity to damage from status, access to recovery options, or better bulk.

Taunt is used to cripple Chansey, Blissey and Slowking by preventing their recovery, letting it break past these Pokemon, as well as preventing it from being statused, which can cut into its longevity and its nifty Speed tier. Trace is the chosen pre-Mega Evolution ability in order to potentially give Gardevoir a free switch in against the likes of Heatran or Gastrodon. Healing Wish and Will-O-Wisp can also be used to utilize Mega Gardevoir’s vast supportive options; however, running these moves severely limits Mega Gardevoir’s wallbreaking capabilities, and as a result it is greatly outperformed by Pokemon such as Clefable and Mew due to their superior recovery options and longevity. Pokemon that appreciate Mega Gardevoir wallbreaking early-game, such as Rillaboom and Bisharp, serve as great teammates. Mega Gardevoir should never be used on any serious team as the few advantages it has over its other competitors don't even come close to outweighing the cons.

Magnezone is a terrific partner alongside Mega Latios, removing pesky Steel-types such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor.</p> "

A specially defensive set with Iron Head / U-turn and two of Stealth Rock / Wish / Protect lets Jirachi act as a solid pivot that can provide Wish and Stealth Rock support while fulfilling an important defensive niche in checking Psychic- and Fairy-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Heatran, Mega Scizor, Aegislash, and Ferrothorn take very little damage from Jirachi’s Iron Head and U-turn. Mega Scizor, Firium Z Heatran, and Ghostium Z Aegislash are particularly dangerous, as they’re immune to Trick, while Ferrothorn can wear down Jirachi with Iron Barbs. However, specially defensive Heatran and Ferrothorn must be wary of Trick, as losing their Leftovers and being Choice-locked does them no favors.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Toxapex and Slowbro don’t mind Iron Head and don’t even need to risk a flinch while healing thanks to Regenerator. In the meantime, both can burn Jirachi, Toxapex can remove its Choice Scarf with Knock Off, and Slowbro can set up Future Sight or Teleport out. Jirachi is able to Trick them, though.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Volcarona, Heatran and Mega Charizard Y easily stomach all of Jirachi’s attacks and hit back with their powerful STAB moves. All three can also avoid Trick provided the former two run a Z-Crystal.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Garchomp, defensive Landorus-T, and Gliscor are capable of switching into Jirachi and eliminating it with STAB Earthquake. The former two can wear down Jirachi with Rough Skin or Rocky Helmet, respectively, while Gliscor easily switches in thanks to Poison Heal and it not caring about Trick after its Toxic Orb has activated. Garchomp and Landorus-T need to be wary of Trick, however.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Most Electric-types easily switch into Jirachi thanks to their Steel resistance, and hit it hard with their STAB moves. Zapdos is especially troubling, as it has the potential to paralyze Jirachi with its ability, ruining its Speed. Magnezone can trap Jirachi locked into Iron Head and remove it with Thunderbolt. Rotom-W despises Trick, but it easily takes Iron Head and cripples Jirachi with Will-O-Wisp.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Jirachi is a solid Choice Scarf user due to its decent Speed and access to a reliable and disruptive move in Iron Head. On top of that, Jirachi boasts a good defensive typing and great utility in U-turn, Trick, and Healing Wish. Iron Head is Jirachi’s main tool to revenge kill numerous Pokemon in Tapu Lele, Weavile, and Mega Diancie. In conjunction with Serene Grace, Iron Head can situationally defeat a wide range of additional threats as well, including Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Tapu Koko. As Jirachi’s damage output is mediocre outside of Iron Head, the remaining three moves are dedicated to utility in order to make the best out of Jirachi’s solid defensive typing. U-turn allows Jirachi to capitalize on switch-ins and preserve momentum while letting its offensive teammates in for free. Healing Wish lets Jirachi completely heal a weakened teammate at the cost of sacrificing itself, offering offensive partners a second chance to break open or clean up the opponent’s team. Trick can allow Jirachi to cripple nearly every switch-in to it, as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos don’t like being locked into a move. Serene Grace gives Iron Head a 60% flinch chance, making it quite spammable against Pokemon that don’t resist Steel.</p> <p>Jirachi’s ability to fully heal a teammate is incredible for a number of offensive teammates, such as Mega Mawile, Garchomp, and Swords Dance Kartana. Its ability to cripple Pokemon like Toxapex, Heatran, and Slowbro with Trick and pivot out of them with U-turn is also fantastic for the aforementioned partners. Jirachi can act as a solid check to Fairy- and Psychic-types such as Clefable, Mega Diancie, and Tapu Lele, so Pokemon that may struggle with these threats like Mega Latias, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny make good teammates. As Jirachi lacks the necessary longevity to continuously withstand these Fairy- and Psychic-types, additional soft checks such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight are advisable teammates. Jirachi cannot reliably revenge kill Pokemon like Kartana, Mega Scizor, and Ash-Greninja, so counterplay to these threats like bulky Landorus-T, Corviknight, and Blissey is essential. In addition, all of these Pokemon can form a pivoting core with Jirachi. Jirachi baits in Pokemon that aren’t bothered by its moves and can take advantage of it, like Heatran, Zapdos, and Mega Scizor. Jirachi’s best way of making progress against these Pokemon is either crippling them with Trick or pivoting out of them with U-turn into teammates that can exploit such as Garchomp, Greninja, and Tapu Koko.</p> "

Toxic and Thunder Wave can be run over U-turn in order to harass defensive answers, but they aren’t worth dropping the ability to reliably pivot on most teams. Quick Attack and Facade can be offensively useful, but only situationally. Healing Wish is an option but faces competition from Choice Scarf Jirachi, which boasts a better defensive typing, as well as the ability to effectively cripple walls before sacrificing itself.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls: The likes of Toxapex, Bold Clefable, and defensive Zapdos can easily take all of Mega Lopunny’s attacks. However, all of these must be at or near full health, cannot switch in whatsoever if Future Sight also hits that turn - and bar Static Zapdos - are susceptible to a loss of momentum from U-turn. Slowbro can afford chip damage, but its Psychic typing exacerbates the effectiveness of Mega Lopunny’s U-turn. This can lead to scenarios where the combination of Return and U-turn either forces Slowbro to waste turns using Slack Off or risk being excessively whittled down over the course of the match.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Faster attackers such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Excadrill in sand, and Mega Swampert in rain can take advantage of Mega Lopunny’s defensive woes and either KO it outright or take advantage of the forced switch into a passive wall. However, none of these can switch (added space) in reliably, and they are additionally susceptible to being chipped down by Fake Out with the exception of Excadrill.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves: Attackers with priority moves, such as Ash-Greninja, Weavile, Mega Medicham, and Rillaboom, can easily revenge kill Mega Lopunny due to its awful defensive attributes. However, they cannot come in directly, struggle with Fake Out, and - with the exception of Rillaboom - require significant chip damage to actually KO Mega Lopunny.</p> ",

Fake Out can force respectable chip damage onto faster threats and priority users, like Rillaboom and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and even slower attackers that it brings to KO range like Mega Medicham. U-turn takes advantage of how easily Mega Lopunny can force switches by keeping up momentum on the likes of Slowbro, Clefable, Toxapex, and Slowking. Ice Punch can be run over U-turn to handle Gliscor and Landorus-T more effectively, but Mega Lopunny loses out on a lot of offensive utility. Limber can prevent paralysis before Mega Evolving.</p> <p>Mega Lopunny fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate the Speed and ability to pivot on forced switches that it provides. As such, wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Kyurem, Ash-Greninja, and Choice Band Victini make excellent partners, and Mega Lopunny can clean up holes in cores they make. Similarly, setup sweepers such as Reuniclus and Nasty Plot Hydreigon also appreciate being pivoted into passive Pokemon such as Slowbro. Mega Lopunny’s defensive stats are quite subpar, so walls like Clefable and specially defensive Heatran are good partners. Pivots such as U-turn Greninja variants, Rotom-W, and Choice Band Rillaboom make great options as well to get Mega Lopunny in safely. Slowking and Slowbro deserve special mention, as they can fulfill the aforementioned defensive role while using Future Sight + Teleport to let Mega Lopunny break through almost all common counterplay options, such as Toxapex, Zapdos, and Tangrowth. Magnezone can trap and remove common switch-ins to Mega Lopunny, like Mega Scizor and Corviknight, and pressure others like Clefable and Toxapex. Entry hazards from the likes of Ferrothorn, Greninja, and Garchomp are fantastic with Mega Lopunny in order to maximize the pressure it places on defensive cores and chip down foes into Fake Out range faster. Clefable especially makes an excellent partner, as it can fulfill hazard-setting duties and also support Mega Lopunny defensively,</p> "

Furthermore, Mega Lopunny's extremely high Speed stat allows it to utilize Power-Up Punch extremely well, as it is hard to revenge kill, and teams often rely on defensive checks to it. However, due to this set lacking the ability to pivot on defensive switch-ins, it is forced to rely on Encore to break down its defensive checks, which can sometimes prove inconsistent due to its predictability once the set is revealed, such as relying on Corviknight or Clefable to instantly use their recovery move when they get attacked instead of retaliating. Power-Up Punch allows Mega Lopunny to function as a potent cleaner in the late-game. Encore functions alongside Power-Up Punch to use passive Pokemon such as Clefable, Toxapex, and Skarmory as setup fodder by locking them into their recovery to boost its Attack stat with Power-Up Punch as these Pokemon are left unable to retaliate. Limber is the chosen ability to allow Lopunny to avoid paralysis before it Mega Evolves to let it pressure Static Zapdos.</p> <p>Power-Up Punch + Encore Mega Lopunny fits on a wide array of team archetypes, from offense to balance. Due to its ability to lure and eliminate or severely chip down multiple key threats such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Clefable, teammates like Weavile, Ash-Greninja, and Kyurem work extremely well with it, as they complement each other offensively. Ash-Greninja and Weavile, in particular, also help secure Mega Lopunny's shakier matchup against offensive teams. Although Mega Lopunny can lure and eliminate these Pokemon, it is unable to beat them in a 1v1 scenario; thus, the likes of Tapu Koko, Heatran, and Victini are common partners. Furthermore, the aforementioned Pokemon can also threaten the likes of Zapdos, Moltres, and Tangrowth, which can cause issues for Mega Lopunny. Pokemon which can set entry hazards such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Clefable, and Landorus-T are stellar partners, as the additional chip damage generated by the hazards allows Mega Lopunny to break its checks like Corviknight much easier, as well as wear down foes for it to clean late-game. Lastly, as Mega Lopunny can't switch into offensive threats due to its poor defensive capabilities, defensive pivots such as Corviknight, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W are necessary alongside it, and they can also switch into the likes of Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Landorus-T, which can revenge kill it.</p> "

Due to its stellar bulk and good defensive ability in Rough Skin, Garchomp can also run a defensive Stealth Rock set with a Rocky Helmet in tandem with Rough Skin to rack up chip damage against opposing physical attackers, However, this set is outclassed in this role by Rocky Helmet Landorus-T and is unsuitable for checking anything in the long run. Garchomp can also run a mixed Life Orb set with Draco Meteor or Fire Blast to bait in and punish physical walls that would usually give Garchomp problems, though Garchomp’s poor Special Attack makes the set difficult to pull off consistently, and this set is also outclassed by its Mega Evolution. A mixed offensive Stealth Rock set with Draco Meteor and Fire Blast not only lures and beats common Mega Garchomp answers such as Tangrowth and Skarmory, but it also sets up Stealth Rock and overpowers common entry hazard control options such as Mega Sableye, Corviknight, and Kartana. However, this set becomes easy to counterplay after it's been revealed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon: Pokemon that have good physical bulk and don't take super effective damage from any of Garchomps common moves like Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Hippowdon can survive any unboosted hit from Garchomp and force it out with status or super effective coverage moves. Pokemon with Unaware such as Clefable and Quagsire can also completely stop Garchomp from wallbreaking.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Naturally fast Pokemon or Choice Scarf users like Greninja, Tapu Koko, Landorus-T, Weavile, and Ice Beam Latias can revenge kill Garchomp. Priority users like Rillaboom, Mega Medicham, and Mega Scizor can also knock out a weakened Garchomp but they don't enjoy the chip from Rough Skin.</p> <p><strong>Status: Garchomp absolutely hates status conditions, as all of them severely cripple its wallbreaking capabilities and defensive utility. Scald burns from Slowbro, Slowking or Gastrodonseriously limit its wallbreaking potential, while Toxic poisoning from Clefable, Blissey, or Gliscor will seriously dent its longevity.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory and Corviknight: Garchomp cannot reliably break either Skarmory or Corviknight without Continental Crush. Iron Defense or Bulk Up variants of these two will completely wall Garchomp; not only can they clear Garchomp's Stealth Rock with Defog, but they can set their own hazards up as well.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type attacks</strong>: Mega Garchomp's crippling weakness to Ice-types leaves it vulnerable to the likes of Weavile and Kyurem, both of which outspeed and force it out. Faster Pokemon that tend to run Ice-type coverage moves such as Greninja, Mega Latias, and Zeraora can also revenge kill Mega Garchomp, unless its Speed has been boosted.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Because of Scale Shot's lowering of Defense, it leaves Mega Garchomp vulnerable to be revenge killed by physical priority moves from the likes of Mega Medicham, Rillaboom, Mega Lopunny, Mega Scizor, and Weavile.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: The likes of Buzzwole, Landorus-T, and Slowbro temporarily hinder Mega Garchomp with status. The former two are also prone to Intimidate shuffling, and Buzzwole and Slowbro threaten Mega Garchomp with Ice-type coverage moves. Tangrowth gets chip damage on Mega Garchomp between Rocky Helmet and Hidden Power Ice. Slowbro, with its insane Defense stat, eats most hits from Mega Garchomp.

It also has some solid defensive utility with its typing, letting it provide an Electric immunity and check common Pokemon like Heatran and non-Hidden Power Zapdos. Swords Dance allows Garchomp to beat a lot of common Defoggers like Zapdos, Corviknight, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, allowing it to easily keep Stealth Rock up. Rockium Z with Stone Edge gives Garchomp a strong Rock-type move to beat Defoggers like Zapdos and Corviknight. Alternatively, Dragonium Z with Outrage allows Garchomp to deliver a harder hit on physically defensive Pokemon like Landorus-T, Tangrowth, and Slowbro, and it can also catch a Mega Latias expecting a Stone Edge off guard. However, having a much worse matchup against Corviknight and Skarmory and the lack of a spammable STAB move once Devastating Drake has been used, make Dragonium Z an inferior option overall. Rough Skin is the preferred ability on most sets, as it punishes physical attackers like Mega Scizor, Rillaboom, Mega Medicham, and Hawlucha.</p> <p>Due to its role as both a wallbreaker and Stealth Rock setter, Garchomp fits best on offensive teams, where it can be paired up with teammates that enjoy its ability to break down or threaten out bulkier Pokemon like Toxapex, Zapdos, and Blissey. Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Ash-Greninja, Mega Lopunny, Mega Mawile, and Mega Medicham make for stellar teammates, as they benefit from its ability to break down defensive foes like Zapdos, Slowbro, and Corviknight. The former three can also bring Garchomp in safely on defensive Pokemon, allowing it to set up Stealth Rock or use Swords Dance easily. Garchomp is very easily forced out by faster offensive Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja, Weavile, Kartana, and Tapu Koko, so Pokemon that can deal with them, like Tapu Fini, Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Gastrodon make for solid teammates. Tapu Fini is an especially good partner for non-Outrage sets, as Misty Terrain can let Garchomp freely switch into bulky Water-types like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Slowking without fearing a Scald burn. Due to it beating many of the common Defoggers in the tier, Garchomp pairs well with Spikes users like Ash-Greninja and Ferrothorn, as it can threaten opposing Defoggers and keep Spikes on the field.

Mega Garchomp struggles in a similar fashion against opposing Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tapu Bulu who are able to pivot into Scale Shot and prevent it from boosting its Speed. Running partners that can deal with these threats, such as Bisharp and Gengar, makes for good synergy. Volcarona switches into Ice- and Fairy-type attacks directed towards Mega Garchomp, which creates opportunity for it to set up. In return, Mega Garchomp beats common Volcarona checks such as Toxapex, Blissey, and Heatran.

With a Choice Scarf, Magnezone can also revenge kill threats such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Lele, which would otherwise be able to outspeed and KO it. However, due to its low Speed even with Choice Scarf, Magnezone mandates secondary revenge killing which can make teambuilding with it harder. Magnezone also often needs a Steel-type teammate, adding more overlap and stacking weaknesses, as it's too frail to have the defensive properties most Steel-types have. Volt Switch lets it maintain momentum while escaping unfortunate situations, as well as chipping down Steel-types like Heatran and Melmetal, which Magnezone can’t consistently trap and remove. Hidden Power Fire lets it OHKO Kartana and beat Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Steel Beam dents common checks such as Garchomp, Gliscor, Mega Latias, and Hydreigon, and it can KO Magnezone to safely bring in a check for more offensive pressure. Alternatively, Flash Cannon is a relatively spammable Steel-type STAB move, which allows it to pressure the likes of Mega Tyranitar and Tapu Lele better, although it means Magnezone is walled by Gliscor and Pokemon like Mega Latias that can easily recover off the damage dealt. The given EV spread allows Magnezone to survive a unboosted Sacred Sword from Kartana.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Magnezone can fit on a variety of teams from balance to offense teams due to its unique trapping capability. The likes of Tapu Lele, Mega Lopunny, and Kyurem appreciate it removing Steel-types such as Corviknight, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor for them, with the former two also functioning as proper revenge killers, which Magnezone is too slow to do. Pokemon such as Garchomp and Tapu Fini appreciate it removing Kartana. Landorus-T is an amazing partner for Magnezone, luring in and pivoting out of Corviknight and Skarmory to consistently trap them with Magnezone, and the pair form a potent VoltTurn core. Landorus-T can also pivot into and out of Kartana for Magnezone to safely trap it. Other Steel-types such as Corviknight and Mega Scizor also are solid partners, as they provide the defensive Steel-type utility that Magnezone is unable to, such as checking the likes of Rillaboom, Tapu Lele, and Weavile. Ground-immune and resistant Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Tangrowth, and Gliscor are needed alongside Magnezone due to its 4x Ground weakness. Lastly, Knock Off users such as Landorus-T, Weavile, and Clefable can assist Magnezone in trapping Corviknight and Skarmory, luring them in and removing Shed Shell if they run it.</p> "

Electrium Z is the preferred item, as it can help alleviate pressure from Heatran while still safely trapping Mega Mawile. Steelium Z alongside Steel Beam is another option, most notably dealing heavy damage to Landorus-T, Gliscor, Tyranitar, and Mega Tyranitar.

A set utilizing Infestation and Worry Seed can trap Gliscor and remove its Poison Heal. This also allows Tangrowth to more easily run Hidden Power Fire. Earthquake can be used over Sleep Powder to surprise Heatran, Tapu Koko, and Magnezone on the switch while allowing Tangrowth to more effectively check Excadrill. Stun Spore can also be used to push paralysis onto threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Corviknight. Rock Slide can be used over Sleep Powder, as it nails Mega Charizard Y, Moltres, and Volcarona as they switch in, but Tangrowth's other moves tend to be more consistently useful.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Mega Charizard Y easily breaks through Tangrowth and takes minimal damage from anything bar the extremely rare Rock Slide. Mega Charizard X, Heatran, Victini, and Moltres are threatening as well, but the latter three dislike Knock Off, and the former three have to be careful to not blunder into an Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Flyinium Z Landorus-T can lure in and dispose of Tangrowth as it switches in, but it can't set up on it due to the threat of Hidden Power Ice. Hawlucha, Zapdos, and Mega Pinsir can also use their STAB moves to break through Tangrowth. Tangrowth also can't do much to defensive Flying-types like Corviknight and Zapdos except remove their item or potentially put them to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type Coverage: Weavile and Kyurem are capable of busting through Tangrowth with their powerful STAB moves, although Weavile will take heavy damage due to Rocky Helmet if it uses Triple Axel on Tangrowth, and neither wants to eat Knock Off. Ice-type coverage from Slowbro and Mega Latias can also prove problematic.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Tangrowth's meager special bulk means that strong special attackers such as Mega Latios, Kyurem, and Tapu Lele can all break through it with relative ease, although they must watch out for Sleep Powder and coverage moves, and they should confirm that the Tangrowth is not a rarer Assault Vest variant. The lack of special bulk also leaves Tangrowth wide open to Future Sight from the likes of Slowbro and Slowking, which can prevent it from effectively dealing with physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Mega Venusaur completely walls Tangrowth and can threaten it with Sludge Bomb. Amoonguss doesn't love taking Knock Off but also effortlessly forces out Tangrowth.

It also has access to useful utility moves such as Sleep Powder and Knock Off, which can punish Pokemon such as Heatran, Zapdos, and Kyurem that would switch in rather freely otherwise. Unfortunately, Tangrowth doesn't effectively deal with some very common physical attackers, such as Victini, Mega Scizor, and Weavile, and its terrible special bulk leaves it open to threats such as Kyurem, Tapu Lele, Life Orb Clefable, and Heatran. A lack of reliable recovery also leaves it open to very powerful physical wallbreakers such as Dragonium Z Garchomp, Mega Mawile, and Mega Medicham. Knock Off cripples common switch-ins such as Heatran and Zapdos. Hidden Power Ice is the preferred coverage move, dealing big damage to Landorus-T and Garchomp while also working together with Giga Drain to force Gliscor to spam Roost in order to avoid fainting. Hidden Power Fire can also be used, however, to force immediate damage onto Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Kartana, but losing pressure on the aforementioned Ground-types is very detrimental. Sleep Powder allows Tangrowth to put a foe out of commission completely, therefore giving a teammate a free switch in and punishing a threat such as Mega Latias, Corviknight, or Clefable. Rocky Helmet allows Tangrowth to chip down physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Mawile, and Kartana, therefore making it less passive overall. A Relaxed nature is preferred, as Tangrowth uses both of its attacking stats and its Speed is already very low.</p> <p>Tangrowth fits on balance teams that need a very sturdy check to physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny, Kartana, and Rillaboom. Ground-types work well with Tangrowth, as they appreciate Tangrowth taking on Water- and Grass-types like Rillaboom, Kartana, and Mega Swampert. They are capable of blocking Volt Switch from the likes of Tapu Koko and Magnezone, as Tangrowth is not a suitable check to any of these on its own. Examples such as Garchomp and Gliscor work well to check the aforementioned while also switching into Heatran. These Ground-types can also can set Stealth Rock, which is important for Tangrowth, as it allows its team to better pressure dangerous Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Victini, and Heatran. Tangrowth's special bulk is meager, so having a very bulky specially defensive wall is recommended. Specially defensive Heatran pairs well with Tangrowth, as it can take on threats such as Zapdos, Life Orb Clefable, and Tapu Lele. Mega Tyranitar can also help Tangrowth out against Heatran, Reuniclus, and Mega Latias. Slowking can deal with threats such as Heatran and Tapu Lele. Tapu Fini also pairs well with Tangrowth due to it taking care of Ash-Greninja as well as Heatran, while Blissey can also act as a general sponge to Ash-Greninja, Kyurem, Tapu Koko, and Mega Charizard Y. These teammates appreciate Tangrowth taking care of dangerous physical attackers, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, Mega Lopunny, and Rillaboom. Tangrowth needs good entry hazard removal on its side, as hazard damage can put it in range of some of the tier's stronger wallbreakers, such as Weavile and Swords Dance Mega Mawile. Zapdos, Tapu Fini, and Excadrill are all potentially good partners as a result. Additional checks to physical attackers Tangrowth can't deal with are also beneficial; Toxapex or Melmetal can take care of Weavile, while Corviknight can work with a revenge killer that can finish off Ground-types, such as Weavile or Ash-Greninja, to deal with Swords Dance variants of Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. Teammates like Swords Dance Garchomp and Mega Mawile appreciate Sleep Powder giving them a setup opportunity.</p> "

Future Sight is a support option that, in conjunction with U-turn, boosts teammates' wallbreaking capabilities but lowers Victini's immediate offensive presence. Bolt Strike hits bulky Water-types like Slowking and Tapu Fini much harder while still pressuring specially defensive Toxapex, although it means Victini can't pressure the likes of Garchomp and Kommo-o consistently. Toxic allows it to check the likes of Mega Latias, prevents Pokemon such as Volcarona from setting up on Blue Flare variants, and punishes switch-ins like Slowbro and Slowking. Encore discourages Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Mega Latias from trying to set up on it. This can make Pursuit trapping Mega Latias much easier due to Weavile and Tyranitar not needing to fear Aura Sphere.

Suicide lead variants of Landorus-T can aid Victini in this role by setting up Stealth Rock and exploding on key defensive targets like Zapdos.

Victini likes to get in unharmed so it can take advantage of its bulk as best as possible, so pivots like Corviknight, Blissey, and Slowbro make good teammates.

Air Balloon reverses the matchup against Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. However, these matchups aren't worth being stonewalled by Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Zapdos. A suicide lead set consisting of Stealth Rock / Earthquake / Rapid Spin / Toxic or Steel Beam can be used on hyper offensive teams to guarantee Stealth Rock, thanks to Mold Breaker, and to keep hazards off its side of the field. However, such a set is generally outclassed by Landorus-T, which brings a nuclear Explosion to the table, and Mew, which brings Spikes and Taunt. A specially defensive set can be used to check a myriad of Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele while providing Rapid Spin, but it is easy to wear down and overwhelm.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types: Corviknight, Zapdos, and Mega Charizard Y are immune to Excadrill's Earthquake and take its Iron Head decently well, while they can all retaliate with super effective coverage. Mega Charizard Y can also remove potential sand, causing Excadrill to be slower than it. However, the former must be wary of Substitute variants if it lacks Body Press, and the latter two are shattered by +2 Normalium Z.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: When unboosted by sand or Rapid Spin, Excadrill sits are at a poor Speed tier. As a result, faster Pokemon like Garchomp, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Lopunny are capable of revenge killing it. Ash-Greninja in particular has a powerful Water Shuriken to dispatch of Excadrill even when its boosted. However, none of these Pokemon can switch into Excadrill directly and cannot beat it if its Speed is boosted.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Physically defensive Tangrowth is incredibly difficult for Excadrill to break if it has used its Z-Move, and Tangrowth can wear Excadrill down with Rocky Helmet and Giga Drain or neutralize it with Sleep Powder. However, Tangrowth can be crippled by Toxic long-term. Rillaboom, while unable to switch in directly, deals heavy damage to Excadrill with a priority Grassy Glide.

        "description": "<p>Excadrill is a cornerstone on sand teams, serving as a capable wallbreaker and sweeper for the archetype thanks to its high Attack, access to Swords Dance, and doubled Speed under sand. Additionally, its solid bulk and fantastic defensive typing give it many opportunities to set up against the likes of Clefable, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Koko. Swords Dance alongside a Z-Move lets Excadrill clean up weakened defensive Pokemon like Slowbro, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Fini. Giga Impact gives it access to Breakneck Blitz, allowing Excadrill to break through common Pokemon like Zapdos as well as chipped Slowbro and Tangrowth after a boost. Rapid Spin can be used if Excadrill's team can't fit Defog elsewhere and gives Excadrill the ability to limit Stealth Rock Clefable, patch up its Speed without the need for sand, and remove entry hazards for Pokemon weak to them like Mega Charizard Y. Toxic can be used in the fourth slot to wear down Slowbro, Tangrowth, Landorus-T, and Zapdos, especially alongside sand damage. Substitute is an option to use non-Body Press Corviknight as setup fodder. Leftovers allows for Excadrill to take advantage of its solid defensive typing, giving it easier setup on Pokemon like Clefable and Tapu Koko. However, forgoing Normalium Z can be detrimental against teams carrying Slowbro, Zapdos, and Tangrowth. Jolly is the preferred nature to Speed tie with opposing Excadrill, but if adequate Excadrill counterplay is on your team, Adamant can be used for its higher power, which is notable for dispatching Slowbro and Tangrowth a bit easier.</p> <p>Excadrill necessitates sand to function properly, so either Tyranitar or Mega Tyranitar are mandatory alongside it. Mega Tyranitar is also a great Stealth Rock setter, chipping Excadrill's answers into the range of its attacks. Both Tyranitar formes are also notable for being able to beat Zapdos one-on-one for Excadrill and having Pursuit to cripple Mega Latias. Corviknight effortlessly walls Excadrill, so teammates that can deal with it, such as Zapdos and Magnezone, make excellent teammates. Both are also notable for tearing open physically defensive Tangrowth, which would otherwise halt Excadrill's sweep. Swords Dance and Choice Band Kartana sets are also capable of forcing damage onto Corviknight and Zapdos, causing them to falter at checking Excadrill. Faster Pokemon like Ash-Greninja and Mega Lopunny can exploit Excadrill's mediocre Speed outside of sand, with Ash-Greninja revenge killing it even under sand with Water Shuriken, so partners such as Toxapex, Slowbro, and Corviknight are needed to help remedy this issue. Ferrothorn and Ash-Greninja are notable partners for their ability to set Spikes, allowing Excadrill to pressure Pokemon that would otherwise check it like Tangrowth. Calm Mind Clefable and Reuniclus are solid partners for Excadrill, as they appreciate Excadrill dismantling Steel-types that can halt their sweep. They also provide a solid defensive backbone which Excadrill can fall back on once sand has run out.</p> "

Thunder alongside Electrium Z nails Slowking and Toxapex. Thunder is also able to spread paralysis, but it does not hit Dark-types, which leaves Reuniclus more vulnerable to Pursuit.

Due to Reuniclus's inability to touch Mega Sableye as well as bad matchup against Aegislash, teammates such as Calm Mind Clefable and Mega Mawile make for solid partners. Reuniclus's Pursuit weakness is also a nuisance, but if paired with Mega Latias, the pair can easily overwhelm opposing Pursuit trappers such as Weavile, Tyranitar, and Mega Tyranitar. Reuniclus can struggle with strong special attackers like Ash-Greninja, Volcarona, and Gengar, especially if it is unboosted. Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Heatran, and Kommo-o can deal with these Pokemon.

This is especially effective considering most Grass-types, as well as the sleep blocking Tapu Fini, cannot safely switch into Amoonguss. This also makes Pokemon that would otherwise be able to absorb Sludge Bomb easily, such as Corviknight and Toxapex, hesitant to switch in due to the threat of Spore. Hidden Power Fire hits Kartana and Ferrothorn while also applying some chip to other Steel-types, such as Mega Scizor, Magnezone, and Mega Mawile.

Zeraora, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Choice Scarf Victini check offensive threats like Weavile and Tapu Koko, which prove troublesome for Hydreigon. Blissey tends to render Hydreigon useless offensively, so pairing it up with Pokemon such as Kartana, Mega Scizor, and Mega Lopunny helps out Hydreigon.</p> "

Psychic hits many of its checks, such as Toxapex and Kommo-o. Volcarona can also run Hidden Power Ground to hit one of its best counters in Heatran, but this causes it to falter against Pokemon like Toxapex and Kommo-o. Heavy-Duty Boots maintains Volcarona's defensive utility through Stealth Rock and gives it better opportunities to set up; meanwhile, Psychium Z allows it to deal incredible neutral damage with a Shattered Psyche at the cost of taking entry hazard damage. Flame Body can punish physical attackers like Rillaboom, Mega Scizor, and Mega Mawile, while a Timid nature lets it naturally outspeed Pokemon like Kyurem, Excadrill, and Urshifu-R, as well as Choice Scarf Landorus-T after a Quiver Dance boost. Modest can be used if more power is desired, grabbing notable KOs such as Kommo-o, Mega Tyranitar, and Garchomp, but Volcarona ends up easier to revenge kill by the likes of Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Mega Garchomp before a boost.</p> <p>Volcarona mainly fits on hyper offense, teams as they appreciate the defensive utility and firepower it brings; in return, Volcarona appreciates hyper offense teammates weakening its checks and counters, as there are a lot of situations where it cannot set up and sweep. Entry hazards delay it if it's been hit by Knock Off, and a healthy Tyranitar, Garchomp, or Heatran can take a hit and KO it back. Good examples of powerful teammates are Bisharp, Rillaboom, Garchomp, and Mega Medicham. Meanwhile, cleaners like Hawlucha, Rillaboom, and Mega Gyarados can clean up late-game after Volcarona has broken through the opposing team. Serperior makes a stellar offensive core with Volcarona as Volcarona handles many of Serperior's checks such as Heatran, Corviknight, and Amoonguss, and Serperior's Glare can give Volcarona better opportunities to set up. Hazard control is also incredibly important when using Volcarona, encouraging teammates like Kartana, Corviknight, Excadrill, and Tapu Fini. Non-Heavy-Duty Boots variants used on HO absolutely need hazard removal through the likes of Excadrill or Regieleki to function. Leads such as Taunt Mew and Excadrill can stop Stealth Rock from being on the field, which Volcarona appreciates, and dual screens support through Grimmsnarl or Tapu Koko makes Volcarona harder to take down and give it more opportunities to set up. Lastly, Gliscor can freely set up on Volcarona's best counters: Heatran, Toxapex, and Blissey.</p> "

Bulky sets carrying Fly with Flyinium Z and U-turn can be useful, as they allow Landorus-T to threaten immediate damage onto offensive Pokemon, such as Mega Medicham and Rillaboom. It also takes advantage of the standard bulky pivot sets tending to lure in Tangrowth. However, the loss of Toxic and Rocky Helmet makes this set worse against Pokemon such as Mega Latias and Mega Mawile.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Slowbro is capable of forcing damage onto Landorus-T and potentially burning it with Scald while also eating unboosted hits rather comfortably, although it fears Toxic and a boosted Supersonic Skystrike. Offensive Water-types such as Ash-Greninja, Manaphy, and Mega Swampert are all capable of threatening Landorus-T with their STAB moves as well, although Ash-Greninja can't switch into any set and the other two must be careful of Z-Moves or Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type Coverage: Landorus-T's quadruple Ice weakness means that any Ice-type move will deal heavy damage, if not OHKO.

In addition, Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Mega Medicham can carry Ice-type moves, allowing them to threaten Landorus-T with enormous damage.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon: Corviknight only fears Knock Off from the Choice Scarf and Defensive sets and can proceed to remove Landorus-T's Stealth Rock rather comfortably.

Its ability to act as a team's Ground-type and answer to fast threats alongside its generally good power and utility moves makes it very easy to put on many teams. It gives teams offensive and defensive weapons against threats such as Heatran, Toxapex, and Tapu Koko. U-turn allows Landorus-T to keep up the momentum and take advantage of the switches it forces from common Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Toxapex, and Heatran. Stone Edge 2HKOes Zapdos, OHKOes Moltres, and allows Landorus-T to revenge kill Mega Charizard Y. Knock Off, on the other hand, removes important items from the likes of Slowbro, Zapdos, Moltres, Tapu Fini, and Tangrowth. Punishment allows Landorus-T to deal with Calm Mind Mega Latias, 2HKOing it after a Calm Mind, as well as Calm Mind Reuniclus. It works especially well with teammates that force Mega Latias to use Calm Mind multiple times, such as Corviknight. Explosion allows Landorus-T to deal more damage to certain threats, such as Garchomp, Gliscor, Kommo-o, and Rotom-W; however, keep in mind that all of them require chip damage before being KOed. Defog can be used if the role compression of having revenge killing and hazard removal in the same teamslot is needed. Unfortunately, being locked into Defog gives foes free turns. Hidden Power Ice can be used to threaten opposing Landorus-T and Garchomp. Earth Power can work on teams that are desperately in need of a reliable Kartana revenge killer and need Landorus-T's role compression. A neutral nature and 76 Special Attack EVs should be run in this case in order to secure the OHKO on Kartana. 244 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature are used to outrun Arctozolt in Hail.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types, such as Slowbro and Toxapex, work well with Landorus-T. Slowbro can also form a pivoting core with Landorus-T with Teleport, while Toxapex is capable of taking on Ash-Greninja for Landorus-T. These Water-types also appreciate Landorus-T's Electric immunity, and Toxapex also appreciates the Ground immunity. Strong wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, Kyurem, and Tapu Lele appreciate Landorus-T solidly handling fast threats for them and pivoting them in with U-turn. Mega Mawile and Kyurem are capable of taking advantage of Slowbro, a physical sponge that can generally pivot into Landorus-T safely, and Kyurem can additionally deal with Zapdos. Choice Scarf Landorus-T will get worn down over the course of a game, so having Defog support in the form of Corviknight, Zapdos, or Kartana is very helpful. Corviknight can also force Mega Latias to use Calm Mind multiple times, which can work well with Punishment Landorus-T.</p> "

U-turn is useful, as it lets Landorus-T pivot out of bad matchups against Corviknight and Slowbro. Toxic is used to punish threats such as opposing Landorus-T, Mega Latias, Kyurem, and Slowbro that might look to come in on Landorus-T. Hidden Power Fire is a viable option for teams that need a buffer against Kartana. Rocky Helmet is preferred to punish U-turn from the likes of opposing Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, and Corviknight, as well as general contact moves from threats such as Mega Medicham and Mega Mawile. 144 Speed EVs allows Landorus-T to outrun Modest Heatran. Alternate Speed investments, such as 16 Speed EVs for Tyranitar or 88 for Bisharp, are viable if you want Landorus-T to have more bulk, but missing out on Modest Heatran can be detrimental considering how common it is.</p> <p>Defensive Landorus-T finds its place on more offensive builds that appreciate it checking threats such as Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny while also keeping up momentum and setting Stealth Rock. Landorus-T is very effective at spreading residual damage onto threats such as Landorus-T and Mega Mawile, which fast offensive Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Weavile enjoy, as it allows them to get past these threats much more easily. Landorus-T has no recovery and somewhat mediocre special bulk, both of which make it vulnerable to special attackers such as Clefable, Heatran, and Tapu Lele. The good special bulk of Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Slowking makes them decent partners as a result. Other Water-types, such as Tapu Fini and Slowbro, also enjoy Landorus-T's defensive presence.

Swords Dance boosts Landorus-T's Attack to titanic levels, allowing Earthquake to do enormous damage to even bulky neutral targets and making Explosion much more powerful, notably allowing it to OHKO Zapdos, Gliscor, and Slowbro while doing over 50% to Corviknight.

Landorus-T is a great lead, as it matches up well against the vast majority of entry hazard removal options. The only notable ways to stop Landorus-T from getting Stealth Rock up are a faster Taunt user, such as Mew, or a Magic Bounce user such as Mega Sableye. Hyper offense teams utilizing Choice Scarf Victini can also make Victini the lead instead, as Landorus-T tends to trade Stealth Rock with opposing Stealth Rock setters, and it can be therefore more valuable at times to deny the opponent's Stealth Rock first and send in Landorus-T next. This pair can also take two foes with it quite easily. Staple sweepers on hyper offense such as Mega Gyarados, Belly Drum Kommo-o, Mega Garchomp, and Rillaboom are good teammates, as they all appreciate Stealth Rock wearing down the opposition and Landorus-T opening up a big hole with Explosion early-game.</p> "

Swords Dance Landorus-T is also one of the best Pokemon for breaking stall teams, as the immense power combined with a Z-Move makes checking Landorus-T quite hard for them, even with Unaware Pokemon such as Clefable and Quagsire. Fly with Flyinium Z allows Landorus-T to smash through common defensive Pokemon like Slowbro and Tangrowth after a boost. Stone Edge with Rockium Z, on the other hand, lets Landorus-T directly threaten common Defoggers like Corviknight and Zapdos while also allowing it to break through Rotom-W with greater efficiency. It also still has enough power to OHKO Tapu Fini at +2. Its targets are rather limited, however, which makes Flyinium Z the overall superior choice. The Rockium Z set also faces competition from Garchomp, which sits at a significantly better Speed tier that gives it the jump on Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Hydreigon, but Landorus-T retains a niche due to compressing a Ground immunity and getting better damage rolls against Corviknight.</p> <p>Late-game cleaners are excellent partners for Landorus-T, as they greatly appreciate Landorus-T weakening or straight up removing bulkier Pokemon while also setting up Stealth Rock.

U-turn variants of Ash-Greninja can also be employed to get Landorus-T in safely and exploit Pokemon such as Toxapex and Blissey. Mega Lopunny appreciates Landorus-T’s ability to weaken Corviknight and Zapdos, letting them wreak havoc later on. Landorus-T appreciates pivot support that can get it in safely. Blissey, Mega Scizor, and Slowbro are good partners as a result. Magnezone also stands out as an exemplary partner, as it can take out Corviknight and Skarmory for Landorus-T, allowing it to use its Z-Move on other targets.

Teammates that appreciate the removal or denting of Pokemon such as Corviknight, Rotom-W, and Zapdos work well as partners for the Rockium Z set.

This pairs nicely with Pressure and Roost, allowing it to effectively PP stall these targets. Freeze-Dry has high PP and super effectively hit Water-types like Slowbro, Slowking, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini that'd resist its other Ice-type STAB options, and Earth Power covers the Steel- and Fire-types that resist Freeze-Dry like Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Victini. 56 HP EVs give Kyurem 101 HP Substitutes so that Seismic Toss from Blissey and Chansey can't break it in one hit.</p> <p>Fast pivots with U-turn like Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, Jirachi, and Greninja make excellent teammates to Kyurem by baiting in bulky passive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Slowbro, Tangrowth, and Chansey and giving Kyurem a free switch to set up Substitute.

As a result, Kyurem greatly appreciates having teammates like Magnezone and Heatran that can deal with the Steel- and Fairy-types that can threaten it. Magnezone is notable due to its ability to completely trap and remove Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn with Magnet Pull. Because of Kyurem's lack of immediate power, it's also very much setup fodder for Pokemon like Calm Mind Mega Latias, Clefable, and Reuniclus, so Pokemon that can stop these setup sweepers make for good teammates.

In addition, it‘s a terrific wallbreaker thanks to its incredible offenses and good Speed in conjunction with colorful coverage. Diamond Storm is preferred over Power Gem to wear down specially defensive Pokemon like Blissey, Toxapex, and Slowking. Moonblast is a powerful STAB move that easily dispatches Pokemon like Garchomp and Mega Latias while also hitting physical walls like defensive Landorus-T quite hard. Mystical Fire is crucial coverage, as it targets Corviknight and Ferrothorn and discourages Mega Scizor from switching in. Instead of Stealth Rock, Earth Power can be used to snipe Heatran and do more damage to Mega Mawile and Excadrill. Encore can also be used in this moveslot to, for example, lock Corviknight into Defog or Tapu Fini into Calm Mind, allowing Mega Diancie to exploit the switch or revenge kill them. Magic Bounce deters status moves and entry hazards, allowing Mega Diancie to take advantage of passive Pokemon like Mega Sableye and Blissey. 132 Special Attack EVs allow it to 2HKO Corviknight with 72 Special Defense EVs after Stealth Rock, with the remaining EVs going into Attack for better damage rolls against Pokemon like Blissey and Heatran.</p> <p>Mega Diancie fits on bulky offense teams that appreciate its monstrous wallbreaking power and Stealth Rock. Magnezone is a phenomenal teammate thanks to its ability to completely remove Steel-types, allowing Mega Diancie to forgo Mystical Fire entirely. Because of Mega Diancie’s frailty, pivots that can bring it in like Blissey, Slowking, and Corviknight make solid partners. Blissey can also paralyze offensive answers to Mega Diancie such as Greninja and Ash-Greninja, Slowking can use Future Sight to make its attacks indirectly stronger, and Corviknight can check defensive Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor that Mega Diancie can’t break through on its own. Wallbreakers and late-game cleaners such as Swords Dance Kartana and Kyurem appreciate Stealth Rock and Mega Diancie’s ability to wear down several defensive Pokemon, such as Blissey, Heatran, and Mega Scizor. Kartana in particular loves Mega Diancie pressuring Zapdos, Mega Latias, and Corviknight, while Kartana uses the defensive Ground-types that Mega Diancie baits in as setup fodder. Mega Diancie can form solid entry hazard stacking cores with Ferrothorn, Greninja, and Ash-Greninja thanks to their collective ability to beat down Defoggers so that entry hazards can stay up. Ferrothorn can also annoy several of Mega Diancie's checks like Heatran and Blissey with Toxic, Leech Seed, and Knock Off, while Ash-Greninja can beat down the checks it shares with Mega Diancie like Ferrothorn and Toxapex.</p> "

However, a lot of the time, Gastro Acid is less useful than simply running Haze and Toxic. Shed Shell can be useful to escape Heatran's Magma Storm, however; in most situations, the passive recovery from Black Sludge is better. Physically defensive variants can be used to better check Pokemon like Hawlucha, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Mawile, but Toxapex is generally best used to tank special hits. Papaya Berry is an option that allows Toxapex to sponge a hit from foes like Mega Medicham, Latias, and Tapu Lele and cripple them with Toxic, Knock Off, or a Scald burn; however, this tends to be incredibly situational. Lastly, Baneful Bunker can be used to scout moves from Choice-locked foes like Greninja, Landorus-T, Magnezone, and Tapu Lele, as well as punish physical attackers like Mega Medicham and Zeraora.

Scald burns physical attackers and discourages Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Mega Medicham from switching into Toxapex.

Some of the more common Ground-types in the tier like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor must be wary of being OHKOed by Hidden Power Ice, but the Ground-types that aren't weak to Ice, like Gastrodon and Excadrill, completely wall Tapu Koko.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Defensive Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and the rare Assault Vest Tangrowth resist Tapu Koko's main STAB type and are bulky enough to stomach Dazzling Gleam and Hidden Power Ice relatively easily as well. Amoonguss and Tangrowth are particularly pesky, capable of neutralizing Tapu Koko's progress with Volt Switch due to Regenerator. Although not able to switch in safely, Rillaboom can check Tapu Koko in a pinch as well, owing to its resistance to Electric-type attacks and access to strong priority. However, barring Amoonguss and Tangrowth, none of these Grass-types can maintain a positive or even neutral momentum trade against Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Walls: Blissey and Chansey sport tremendous special bulk, which allows them to hold Tapu Koko off for a while.

        "description": "<p>Because of its stellar Speed, good offensive prowess, and access to a strong Volt Switch, Tapu Koko is one of the best offensive pivots in the tier. It has a relatively poor Special Attack stat, but its ability to summon Electric Terrain in tandem with the use of a Choice Specs makes up for that. Hidden Power Ice lets Tapu Koko hit the Ground-types that are immune to its Electric-type moves like Garchomp, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon. This is incredibly important; a well-timed Hidden Power Ice will cleanly OHKO the former two Ground-types and force the latter two out, and the resulting mind games drastically improve Tapu Koko's ability to generate momentum with Volt Switch. Volt Switch lets Tapu Koko scout the opponent and gain free momentum once the opponent's Ground-type has been removed. Dazzling Gleam gives Tapu Koko a good neutral option against Pokemon that resist Thunderbolt but aren't very threatened by Hidden Power, like opposing Tapu Koko, Hydreigon, and Kyurem. Alternatively, it can run Roost to improve its longevity in more drawn-out games against Pokemon that it forces out, such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Slowbro. However, Roost forces Tapu Koko to switch out, thereby losing momentum. Grass Knot is another option that lends Tapu Koko the ability to pressure Gastrodon and Mega Swampert much harder, but it is inferior to Dazzling Gleam otherwise.</p> <p>Due to its role as a fast pivot that can generally keep up momentum well, Tapu Koko fits very well on more offensive teams, but it's a fine fit on balanced teams as well. Tapu Koko pairs particularly well with teammates that can bait in Water- and Flying-types such as Toxapex, Slowbro, Tapu Fini, Corviknight, and Zapdos. Such teammates include the likes of Heatran, Ash-Greninja, Greninja, Mega Lopunny, Rillaboom, and Mega Scizor. Moreover, all of these partners bar Heatran are capable of creating pivoting cores with Tapu Koko courtesy of their access to U-turn, with Greninja and Ash-Greninja amplifying progress made through pivoting with Spikes as well. Water-, Grass-, and Ice-types such as Ash-Greninja, Kartana, Rillaboom, and Kyurem can easily pressure most of the metagame's Ground-types, including the ones that are particularly annoying for Tapu Koko such as Gastrodon, Mega Swampert, and Excadrill. On the other hand, Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran take advantage of Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss, which can otherwise keep Tapu Koko at bay for extended amounts of time. Due to Tapu Koko's tendency to force plenty of switches and rack up damage with Volt Switch, good entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and the aforementioned Heatran, Greninja, and Ash-Greninja make for good teammates that can greatly speed up the rate at which Tapu Koko can break teams down. Tapu Koko also likes having strong physical wallbreakers on its side to deal with the more specially defensive Pokemon that check it such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Gastrodon. Pokemon like Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, and Hawlucha make for great teammates to pressure these special walls, with the latter two also having great synergy with Electric Terrain. Lastly, as Tapu Koko is quite frail and prone to revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Rillaboom, and Ash-Greninja as a result, it appreciates a defensive backbone that can sponge up hits from these threats. On bulky offense teams, Pokemon such as bulky Landorus-T, Slowbro, Corviknight, and Blissey can provide said backbone while also maintaining momentum with their pivoting moves. On balanced teams, the likes of Toxapex, Clefable, and Corviknight can fulfill the same objective.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With a strong STAB move in Double Iron Bash, an ability that further boosts its power, and amazing coverage options, Melmetal is a potent tank that can be difficult to switch into. These perks alongside its massive physical bulk allow it to stay in on threats and potentially trade KOs, check common Pokemon such as Calm Mind Clefable, Weavile, and Tapu Lele, and cripple potential switch-ins with Thunder Wave. However, Melmetal has a terrible Speed tier, requiring a lot of investment to even outspeed slow threats, which can cut into its bulk. Its special bulk is also quite mediocre, and in conjunction with its lack of recovery, this leaves Melmetal easily worn down. Melmetal’s STAB typing is also lackluster, meaning it is relatively easy to pivot into by a majority of the tier. Thunder Punch allows Melmetal to nail Water- and Flying-types that can switch into Double Iron Bash, such as Corviknight, Toxapex, and Slowbro. Earthquake is a strong coverage option that always 2HKOes Toxapex while also hitting Heatran. However, Superpower can be used to maintain the ability to hit Heatran while nailing Ferrothorn, which doesn't mind Melmetal's other coverage options. Thunder Wave gives Melmetal the ability to paraflinch checks like Corviknight, Toxapex, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor or wear them down to assist teammates in overwhelming them. Leftovers is used to increase Melmetal's longevity, letting it check Pokemon such as Clefable and Tapu Fini better, while Protective Pads is an option to ignore adverse contact effects like Skarmory’s, Landorus’s, and Tangrowth’s Rocky Helmet, as well as Volcarona’s Flame Body and Zapdos's Static. The given EV spread allows Melmetal to outspeed a paralyzed Heatran, with the rest in Special Defense to maximize its special bulk.</p> <p>Melmetal fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate its solid defensive utility, being able to check Fairy- and Ice-types such as Clefable and Weavile, and its strong wallbreaking capabilities. Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Mega Latios, and Mega Latias make solid partners, as they appreciate Melmetal's ability to spread paralysis and check Fairy- and Ice-types. In return, they cover Melmetal's weaknesses to Fire- and Ground-types: Garchomp checks Fire-types like Heatran, and Mega Latios and Latias check Ground-types like opposing Garchomp. Due to Melmetal’s lack of reliable recovery, Grassy Terrain support from the likes of Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu is greatly appreciated, and in return, they both pressure Flying-types such as Corviknight and Zapdos to aid Melmetal in wallbreaking. Grassy Terrain also weakens opposing Earthquakes, allowing Melmetal to stay in and pressure Ground-types better. Strong entry hazard support from the likes of Greninja, Clefable, and Landorus-T augments Melmetal's ability to pressure opposing teams, as the constant chip damage quickly wears down its checks that try to pivot around it. Tapu Fini is a stellar partner, as its Misty Terrain prevents Melmetal from being statused by the likes of Mega Sableye’s Will-O-Wisp and adverse contact effects like Zapdos’s Static. However, it does prevent Melmetal from paralyzing grounded Pokemon such as Heatran and Mega Scizor, which can prove costly in games. Lastly, fast revenge killers fast revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Ash Greninja, Glare Serperior, and Tapu Koko all work well with Melmetal, as they can take on the faster threats that Melmetal can't due to its low Speed.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Iron Head is an option over Brave Bird or Body Press, allowing Corviknight to defeat Calm Mind Clefable while still hitting Mega Tyranitar and Kyurem decently hard. Iron Defense in tandem with Body Press can be used on stall teams to keep pace with Swords Dance Garchomp and Landorus-T, but this role is often better filled by Skarmory or Quagsire. Taunt can be used to shut down passive Pokemon like Toxapex, Hippowdon, and Clefable while also blocking any attempt to set up and blow past Corviknight. Unfortunately, Corviknight's other moves have much greater opportunity costs than Taunt has benefits. Shed Shell can be used to escape Magnezone, but losing Leftovers or Rocky Helmet is extremely detrimental, and having little use against teams without Magnezone makes it very matchup dependent.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon and Coverage: Magnezone, Tapu Koko, and Zeraora all use Corviknight as a free entry point thanks to their Flying resistance. The first in particular poses a huge threat to Corviknight, as it can trap it and remove it from the game. Similarly, Pokemon like Clefable and Mega Mawile often run Electric-type coverage that can beat down Corviknight.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Heatran and Mega Charizard Y are easily capable of breaking past Corviknight with their STAB moves. The latter in particular can repeatedly come in if Stealth Rock is not on the field thanks to Roost. However, both must be wary of switching into too many Brave Birds or Body Presses, or of Corviknight using them to pivot into a wallbreaker like Mega Medicham or Tapu Koko.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Ground-types: Landorus-T and Excadrill are normally walled by Corviknight, but if they decide to run Substitute, they can use it as setup fodder. As Corviknight cannot touch them without the proper move and U-turn can't break their Substitutes, they can simply set up safely behind a Substitute and break past it. It should be noted that Bulk Up and Iron Defense sets can set up alongside these Pokemon, making them non-issues.</p> ",

Its good matchups against common entry hazard setters in Garchomp, Landorus-T, Mega Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn, alongside Pressure to deplete the PP of their entry hazards, make it a fantastic Defogger. Brave Bird is preferred to threaten Rillaboom, Garchomp, Mega Medicham, and Landorus-T, but Body Press can be used if one's team is weak to Pokemon like Excadrill and Kartana, or if one wants to secure the Mega Tyranitar matchup while discouraging Heatran from switching in. U-turn allows Corviknight to take advantage of the Pokemon it checks by granting free switch-in opportunities to teammates, preserve momentum against Pokemon that seek to take advantage of it such as Heatran and Mega Charizard Y, and escape Magnezone on the switch.</p> <p>Pressure allows Corviknight to PP stall entry hazard moves of passive setters, such as Ferrothorn and Clefable lacking Calm Mind, as well as PP stall other Pokemon like Gliscor and Mega Tyranitar. 184 Defense EVs with an Impish nature allow Corviknight to not be OHKOed by +2 Continental Crush from Landorus-T, with the remaining EVs going to Special Defense to let it switch into Tapu Lele, Mega Latias, and Clefable better. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 44 Def / 212 SpD with an Impish nature allows Corviknight to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Tapu Lele's Hidden Power Fire while also letting it withstand +2 Garchomp's Continental Crush. 0 Speed IVs with a Relaxed nature allows Corviknight to grab as much momentum as possible against Pokemon like Clefable. Leftovers prevents Corviknight from being worn down too quickly. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet can be used to punish U-turn from the likes of Mega Scizor, Landorus-T, and Mega Lopunny.</p> <p>Corviknight is heavily threatened by Fire-types like Heatran and Mega Charizard Y. Therefore, bulky Water-types like Slowbro, Slowking, Gastrodon, and Toxapex can form strong defensive cores with it. Gastrodon can also deal with a major roadblock in Zapdos; Slowbro and Slowking can form a pivot core with Corviknight; and Toxapex enjoys Corviknight checking most Ground- and Psychic-types. Corviknight has a mediocre matchup against Electric-types and Pokemon with Electric-type coverage, such as Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Mega Mawile. Teammates that can take these threats on, such as the aforementioned Gastrodon in Tapu Koko's case and Heatran in the case of the latter two, pair well with it. Corviknight can form pivot cores with Pokemon like Landorus-T and Mega Lopunny, with both appreciating Corviknight's ability to lure in Steel-types that they can take advantage of such as Aegislash, Magnezone, and Heatran. Pokemon that appreciate Corviknight's ability to get them in unscathed, such as Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, and Weavile, make great partners. Weavile in particular is great at strengthening the matchup against Ground-types that Corviknight cannot properly force out, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor.</p> "
