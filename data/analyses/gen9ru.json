      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Enamorus-T is a potent wallbreaker, capable of punching holes in any team with its powerful Moonblasts. Earth Power synergizes well with Moonblast, dealing super effective damage against the Fire-, Poison-, and Steel-types that resist Fairy such as Jirachi, Fezandipiti, and Volcanion. Mystical Fire offers coverage against foes that resist Fairy whose typing or ability grant them more resistance to Ground such as Amoonguss, Forretress, and Bronzong while also providing an option to prevent opposing Calm Mind users from boosting their Special Attack. Healing Wish allows you to sacrifice Enamorus-T to fully heal and remove status from an important teammate such as a chipped sweeper like Cobalion or Thundurus-T or an important part of its team's defensive core. 116 Speed EVs allow Enamorus-T to outspeed uninvested base 60 Speed Pokemon such as Empoleon and Swampert. 136 HP EVs result in slightly less damage taken from Stealth Rock. Tera Fairy boosts its already incredible Moonblasts to another level, turning 2HKOs into OHKOs against targets such as Hippowdown and Iron Leaves and dealing enough damage to where Moltres cannot outheal it with Roost. Tera Ground guarantees OHKOs against the Fairy-resistant foes weak to Ground, while also turning Enamorus-T's Poison, Rock, and Electric weaknesses into resistances or immunities.</p> <p>Choice Specs Enamorus-T fits best on balanced teams with VoltTurn support from Pokemon such as Thundurus-T, Galarian Zapdos, and Jirachi to get it in safely. Due to its low Speed, Enamorus-T is best brought in against the slow walls it wants to threaten or Pokemon that lack the moves to deal with it effectively, including Hippowdon and Slowbro. The standard moveset struggles to hit Fairy-resistant foes that are immune to Ground, most notably Moltres and Rotom-H, so Enamorus-T appreciates teammates that can either answer them or remove their Heavy Duty Boots, like Trick Gardevoir or Knock Off Cyclizar and Galarian Zapdos. When paired with Sand Stream Hippowdon, Enamorus-T can opt to use Weather Ball, which cleanly OHKOes Moltres and does significant damage to Rotom-H, but due to the move's reliance on the weather it is usually not worth sacrificing the flexibility of another move. Due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, Choice Specs Enamorus-T wants entry hazard control, such as Rapid Spin Cyclizar or Forretress. Enamorus-T is also a great option for team styles that mitigate or take advantage of its low Speed, such as Sticky Web from Araquanid or the less viable Trick Room set by Cresselia, due to its immediate power and access to Healing Wish.</p>"
