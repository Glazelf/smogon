        "description": "<p>Cobalion is relatively unique in its role and stat spread, being both very physically tanky with a good defensive typing while also being relatively speedy. These attributes allow Cobalion to reliably serve as both a defensive pivot and a setup sweeper at the same time. Cobalion's typing lets it take advantage of common physical attackers like Cyclizar, Bisharp, and Kleavor, setting up Iron Defense in front of them to minimize the damage it takes from them while also threatening them back with a powerful Body Press. Heavy Slam lets Cobalion hit Fairy-types that don't typically mind a Body Press, like Fezandipiti and Gardevoir. Taunt gives Cobalion protection from status moves like Whirlwind from Hippowdon and Stun Spore from Amoonguss, while also preventing bulky setup Pokemon like Slowbro and Tera Water Fezandipiti from setting up against it. Alternatively, Cobalion can reliably set Stealth Rock using its high Speed and imposing offensive presence. Cobalion may choose to forgo Heavy Slam for Stone Edge as a way to effectively lure Moltres, a common Pokemon that gives Cobalion a great amount of trouble. While Leftovers greatly benefits Cobalion in its role as a sand-immune bulky setup sweeper and offsets Stealth Rock damage, Rocky Helmet allows Cobalion to serve as a perfect counter to Maushold while also punishing U-turn from the likes of Cyclizar, Jirachi, and Kleavor. 252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature lets Cobalion outspeed threats like Mienshao, Fezandipiti, and Galarian Zapdos. Tera Ghost inverts Cobalion's Fighting weakness, letting it take on would-be threats like the aforementioned Fighting-types as well as opposing Cobalion. Tera Ghost also lets Cobalion effectively block Rapid Spin from Cyclizar.</p> <p>Cobalion is often found on balance teams and teams with bulky offenses due to its well-rounded nature and versatility. Amoonguss, Fezandipiti, and Slowbro serve as sturdy long-term counterplay to Fighting-types like Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao. Cobalion also pairs well with Flying-types like Noivern, Salamence, and Moltres, which take on Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks aimed at Cobalion. In return, Cobalion can pivot into Rock-type attacks and Knock Off to preserve their Heavy-Duty Boots. Specially defensive Hippowdon can set up Stealth Rock for Cobalion to freely run Taunt, while Rocky Helmet Cobalion can act as a physical wall for it. Specially defensive pivots like Assault Vest Cyclizar and Empoleon are great partners for Cobalion, compensating for its poor Special bulk and offering Knock Off support to remove opposing Rocky Helmet and Heavy-Duty Boots while providing momentum via U-turn and Flip Turn, respectively. Healing Wish from Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Lunar Dance from Cresselia allows Cobalion to serve as a defensive wall early in a game, then receive a new lease on life as a setup sweeper later on. Jirachi is a fellow Steel-type that can take on Special attackers that overwhelm Cobalion over the course of a game like Gardevoir, Fezandipiti, and Reuniclus.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>While its Special Attack might not seem that threatening at first, Cobalion uses its good Speed stat, natural bulk, and defensive type combination to fire off many hits on metagame staples like Mimikyu, Cyclizar, and Kleavor. Its STAB attacks can hit most Pokemon in the tier for huge neutral or super effective damage. It easily threatens out common Fairy-types like Gardevoir, Fezandipiti, and Mimikyu as well as naturally bulky targets like Volcanion and Jirachi, which it can usually 2HKO. STAB Vacuum Wave lets Cobalion be an effective revenge killer against weakened sweepers like Revavroom and Maushold. Volt Switch allows it to pivot out on checks like Moltres, Slowbro, and Basculegion-F to bring in a teammate that threatens them. With Focus Blast, Cobalion can notably always OHKO Assault Vest Cyclizar with standard EVs and Kleavor. On the other hand, Aura Sphere boasts perfect accuracy; it might miss out on some important OHKOs such as the aforementioned Assault Vest Cyclizar and Kleavor, but it can still OHKO important targets such as opposing Cobalion. Both Focus Blast and Aura Sphere highly weaken one of the best checks to physically oriented Cobalion sets, Hippowdon. Tera Fighting is used for even more damage on its Fighting-type STAB attacks, and Tera Electric grants Cobalion an immunity to paralysis from Pokemon such as Jirachi, lets Cobalion hit even harder with Volt Switch, and removes its weakness to priority Mach Punch from Breloom and Conkeldurr.</p> <p>Choice Specs Cobalion can fit on many archetypes, including hyper offense, bulky offense, and balance. It can bait out the checks to Cobalion's IronPress set such as Hippowdon and Moltres, which clears the way for physical threats like Revavroom and Maushold. It can also provide opportunities to bring in frail teammates like Gengar and Barraskewda through Volt Switch. Cobalion is one of the few special attackers that can threaten Fezandipiti and Chansey for decent immediate damage without setup, forcing them to heal off the damage every time they switch into its attacks, which lets it safely switch into teammates that can threaten them out like Bisharp, Okidogi, and Galarian Zapdos. Special cleaners and sweepers like Jirachi, Gardevoir, and Blastoise enjoy getting their main checks weakened by Cobalion as well. Choice Specs Cobalion enjoys support from entry hazard setters like Forretress, Hippowdon, and Empoleon to chip down its targets as well.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Cobalion sets itself apart from other physical setup sweepers such as Terrakion and Revavroom by trading sheer breaking power in exchange for a fantastic defensive profile, which lets it also act as an answer to many common Pokemon and find plenty of switch-in opportunities. Stone Edge nails Flying-type Pokemon such as Moltres and Salamence that would normally answer Cobalion's other sets. Leftovers allows it to shrug off Stealth Rock damage, as well as resisted attacks such as Maushold's Population Bomb and Jirachi's Iron Head, which, in conjunction with its good defensive typing and natural bulk, lets Cobalion get many opportunities to enter the field throughout the game. Air Balloon is an option that allows Cobalion to switch aggressively into Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon early in the game. Note that Hippowdon variants without Stone Edge cannot hit Cobalion while its Air Balloon has not been popped yet, which turns them into setup fodder. After its Air Balloon has been popped, Cobalion can act as an excellent Knock Off absorber due to it not having to worry about losing its Leftovers, its Dark resistance, and its Justified ability giving it an Attack boost. Tera Ghost turns the tables against Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mienshao, Terrakion, and opposing Cobalion by turning Cobalion's Fighting weakness into an immunity. Tera Flying follows this idea but turns Cobalion's Fighting weakness into a resistance while also granting an immunity to Ground, which helps against Ground-type attacks such as Hippowdon's and Krookodile's Earthquake or Revavroom's High Horsepower. Tera Fighting elevates Close Combat's power even higher, which can help it break past common answers such as Hippowdon while removing Cobalion's Fighting and Ground weaknesses. Cobalion does not need to Terastallize to function efficiently, but it is a fairly common Tera user, as it appreciates the ability to combine its natural bulk with another typing to answer different matchups and create setup opportunities against would-be checks.</p> <p>This set is one of the cornerstones of the bulky offense archetype due to Cobalion's typing and bulk, which lets it act as a check or counter to a variety of common Pokemon. Thanks to Swords Dance and its great Speed tier, it can threaten KOs or break defensive cores. This set requires the opponent's physical walls to already be chipped decently in order to efficiently break apart balance cores, so Spikes support from Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Deoxys-D, and Forretress is very appreciated. Moltres provides an immunity to Ground-type attacks and a resistance to Fighting-type attacks, acts as a pivot with U-turn, and spreads burn through Flame Body and Will-O-Wisp to further chip at walls. Fezandipiti brings a 4x resistance to Fighting-type attacks and is adept at breaking down walls through poison and Taunt while Cobalion answers the Steel-types that Fezandipiti struggles against, but be wary that both Fezandipiti and Cobalion are weak to Ground-type attacks. Special attackers threaten Cobalion due to its lackluster Special Defense, so Pokemon such as Assault Vest Cyclizar, specially defensive Empoleon, and Gastrodon are good teammates. Grass Knot Jirachi can bait in and smack bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Quagsire while being a solid switch-in against Choice Scarf Gardevoir. Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos are powerful wallbreakers that share checks with Cobalion and help overwhelm said checks. Healing Wish support from teammates such as Gardevoir and Jirachi circumvents Cobalion's lack of a recovery option and can also heal off status, allowing for more aggressive plays and extending its longevity.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Shift Gear Revavroom is one of the most threatening late-game sweepers in the tier, as with its access to Shift Gear and great defensive typing, all it needs is one boost to offensively overwhelm most of the tier. Setting up is made easier with its ability, Filter, which allows it to take a Flamethrower from defensive Moltres. Revavroom also has access to useful coverage moves that allow it to threaten Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-types. Nevertheless, Revavroom is quite frail, as its poor Special Defense and reliance on Air Balloon to set up can be exploited by Ground-types, especially Hippowdon, Rhyperior, Quagsire, and Krookodile, as they can take a +1 hit from full HP and OHKO it back.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Revavroom can opt to run Tera Blast Grass, which threatens Water- and Ground-types such as Slowbro, Quagsire, Hippowdon, and Rhyperior. Temper Flare is also an option to take down Steel-types with a Ground immunity such as Bronzong and Tera Steel Rotom-H, as well as helping against opposing Revavroom. Temper Flare can also be boosted with Tera Fire, making Revavroom immune to burn. Finally, Taunt is a solid option to completely wall and set up on Quagsire and Whirlwind Hippowdon with Air Balloon as well as to block Will-O-Wisp from Moltres. Tera Flying + Taunt is a good combination to completely shut down Whirlwind Hippowdon and Quagsire even after Air Balloon breaks. Revavroom can also opt to run Leftovers + Magnet Rise to get rid of its Ground weakness and set up on Ground-types more easily. Clear Amulet can also be used to block Intimidate from Krookodile and Salamence. Toxic is an option to put bulky Fire- and Water-type switch-ins on a timer. Toxic Spikes allows Revavroom to take advantage of the free turns it generates. Toxic and Toxic Spikes could be used on a Choice Scarf Revavroom set, which could be a decent source of role compression also capable of pivoting using Parting Shot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Levitate Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types with Levitate are immune to Gunk Shot and High Horsepower and resist Iron Head. As such, Pokemon such as Bronzong and Tera Steel Rotom-H are the sturdiest answers to Revavroom.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Revavroom fails to KO bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Quagsire, and Palossand even after a Shift Gear boost, and they threaten to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Cobalion</strong>: Tera Ghost Iron Defense Cobalion is a solid check to it, resisting all of its attacks and threatening Revavroom with Body Press. Even if Cobalion does not Terastallize, a boosted High Horsepower fails to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Moltres</strong>: Bulky Moltres can survive a boosted Gunk Shot and threaten huge damage or burn Revavroom back with Will-O-Wisp. Moltres also commonly runs Tera Steel, which lets it absorb Gunk Shot.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Quagsire, and Gastrodon deal with Revavroom quite well, potentially burning it with Scald in Slowbro's case or outright KOing it with Ground-type STAB moves in Quagsire and Gastrodon's cases. They do lose to Tera Grass variants, however.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shift Gear": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Revavroom is a one-dimensional Pokemon that focuses solely on setting up with Shift Gear and sweeping the opposing team. With an Adamant nature, a single Shift Gear lets Revavroom outspeed all relevant Choice Scarf users. Revavroom has access to Gunk Shot and High Horsepower, which give it excellent coverage; Gunk Shot nearly or straight-out KOes defensive staples like Moltres, Fezandipiti, Chesnaught, and Rotom-H after one Shift Gear, while High Horsepower hits Steel- and Poison-types, which resist or are immune to Gunk Shot. Iron Head gives it a reliable STAB move that also hits Ground-types. Tera Ground gives Revavroom an additional STAB move in High Horsepower, which allows it to grab crucial OHKOs such as Cobalion, Volcanion, and Fezandipiti after one Shift Gear boost.</p> <p>Revavroom is a staple on hyper offense teams, and its role is usually to clean late-game. Therefore, it prefers wallbreakers and other setup sweepers such as Terrakion, Basculegion-F, Shell Smash Blastoise, and Yanmega as partners. The usual gameplan with Revavroom is wearing down Steel- and Fire-types with it, allowing another sweeper such as Mimikyu or Blastoise to clean. The opposite is also true, as Blastoise and Yanmega can weaken bulky Ground- and Water-types for Revavroom to sweep late-game. Revavroom should usually be brought in after a teammate has been KOed to ensure that Air Balloon remains intact and it is at near full health, as it is frail defensively.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Assault Vest Cyclizar can safely switch into most special attackers and provide opportunities for its teammates to enter the game thanks to U-turn. Rapid Spin clears entry hazards while also granting Cyclizar a boost to Speed, which helps it outspeed most Choice Scarf users in the tier like Gardevoir and Gengar. It also gives even a paralyzed Cyclizar the opportunity to pivot out of slower opponents like Empoleon and Hippowdon. Knock Off can hit the tier's Pyschic-types such as Reuniclus and Slowbro for decent damage while also threatening the frail Ghost-types like Gengar and Hisuian Zoroark. Draco Meteor can be used to hit physical walls like Hippowdon and Slowbro. Dragon Tail is great at forcing opposing setup sweepers like Cresselia and Slowbro out. Facade can take advantage of status like burn or paralysis that Cyclizar may be inflicted by throughout the course of a game from opposing Moltres, Slowbro, and Thundurus. Assault Vest helps with its otherwise low natural bulk, which is also helped significantly by Regenerator recovery. Timid maximum Speed Cyclizar is faster than the majority of the tier, and the bulk provided allows it to survive a +2 Modest Blastoise Ice Beam along with taking two Ice Beams or Sludge Waves from other threats such as Basculegion-F and Gengar, respectively. Tera Fairy flips Cyclizar's weakness to Dragon-type moves into an immunity and gives a resistance to Fighting-type moves, helping against opposing Cyclizar, Salamence, and Slither Wing. Tera Steel makes Cyclizar resistant to Fairy- and Ice-type moves from the likes of Gardevoir and Empoleon, respectively. Tera Ghost makes it immune to Normal-type, allowing it to stop Rapid Spin attempts from opposing Cyclizar, while adding an immunity to Fighting-type attacks as well.</p> <p>Assault Vest Cyclizar can reliably slot onto balance or bulky offense teams as the main form of entry hazard removal while also providing item removal and pivoting. It can also be used on stall teams, though these structures often want another hazard removal option such as Defog Talonflame to reliably maintain hazard control. Cyclizar pairs well with other Regenerator Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Mienshao, and Slowbro, creating teams that are very difficult to break offensively and can provide pressure through status, hazard chip, and gradual damage. Strong offensive teammates like Crawdaunt, Conkeldurr, and Volcanion appreciate Cyclizar giving them free entry points. While Cyclizar can often keep hazards off the field, it is advised to still run hazard-resilient or Heavy-Duty Boots teammates, such as Amoonguss, Cobalion, and Mienshao, since Cyclizar may struggle against teams with Ghost-types like Palossand or Mimikyu. Assault Vest Cyclizar can struggle to retain HP against hazard-stacking archetypes, being unable to remove hazards against teams utilizing Tera Ghost on their hazard setters. To mitigate this dynamic, Cyclizar relies on pivoting into teammates who can apply offensive pressure to deny hazards from being established, like Basculegion-F, Gardevoir, and Volcanion.</p>"
