        "description": "<h1>Set Information</h1> <p>U-turn does heavy damage to Pokemon such as Mew and Starmie as well as respectable damage to switch-ins such as Melmetal and Rhydon to weaken them into KO range of Mega Beedrill's other coverage moves or its teammates' attacks. Poison Jab is Mega Beedrill's second STAB attack, which is important to hit Pokemon that resist U-turn such as Zapdos and Poliwrath. Poison Jab also comes with a chance to poison foes, which can help wear down your opponent's team even more. Drill Run provides excellent coverage to hit Melmetal and Rhydon for solid damage on a predicted switch. It also OHKOes Alolan Dugtrio from full health. Roost is used to heal off Stealth Rock damage on a predicted switch by the opponent while also maintaining Mega Beedrill's ability to pivot with U-turn in the longer run, taking advantage of the switches Mega Beedrill will force as opportunity to heal. An Adamant nature is chosen because Mega Beedrill only misses out on outspeeding Modest Mega Alakazam and Adamant Mega Aerodactyl, which are quite rare. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed these threats, but the power difference is noticeable. 29 HP IVs allow Mega Beedrill to switch into Stealth Rock four times without fainting.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Early-game, attempt to wear down Mega Beedrill's checks with U-turn while gaining momentum for yourself. Beedrill generally shouldn't be brought in on any attack because of its frailty, so another U-turn or Teleport user is ideal to bring it in such as Mew, Zapdos, or Alolan Exeggutor. Try to keep Stealth Rock off the field for as long as possible, as it wears down Beedrill extremely fast because of U-turn bringing it in and out of the field very frequently. Playing aggressively and clicking Drill Run on predicted switches to Melmetal or Rhydon can also pay off if you have another sturdy switch-in to them that you can bring in with U-turn on the next turn, as this wears them down much faster than just spamming U-turn.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dragonite is a very potent partner of Mega Beedrill because of its ability to clean late-game after Beedrill wears down Melmetal into range of its Earthquake. Rhydon is the preferred Ground-type to pair with Mega Beedrill because of its ability to take on Mega Aerodactyl as well as consistently set Stealth Rock for Beedrill to take advantage of. Mew is an excellent partner for Beedrill because of its ability to form a U-turn core with it by coming in on common Pokemon such as Poliwrath and Melmetal that had previously switched into Beedrill's U-turn. Mega Beedrill can also help check threats to Mew such as Mega Gyarados and Gengar. Alolan Exeggutor is a good partner for a similar reason to Mew, being able to beat Poliwrath and do heavy damage to Melmetal while potentially making use of Teleport to bring Mega Beedrill right back in or dish out an attack depending on the situation.</p>"

In addition, unlike its main competitors in Nidoqueen and Rhydon, Sandslash's Ground neutrality allows it to check threatening Pokemon like the aforementioned Ground-types and Alolan Dugtrio. However, Sandslash has very lacking special bulk, leaving it vulnerable to common Pokemon like Starmie, Mega Alakazam, and both Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y. It's hard to justify Sandslash over Rhydon sometimes due to its lower Attack stat and lack of Rock typing, making it more passive overall. It also doesn't check Zapdos as well as Nidoqueen or Rhydon due to the former's Toxic immunity and the latter's super effective STAB Rock Slide.</p>",

Swords Dance can be used over Toxic to allow Sandslash to break through Zapdos on its own, as well as making it a better answer to Melmetal, but it's generally inferior to the hit-and-run nature of Toxic and leaves Sandslash helpless against Mew. If running Swords Dance, Sandslash should use an Adamant nature to maximize its offensive presence, giving it better odds of KOing Melmetal at +2.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Poliwrath, Mega Gyarados, and Starmie can all cause issues for Sandslash, being able to take its attacks and threaten it out with their own.

Toxic allows Sandslash to cripple Pokemon that would otherwise take it on, like Starmie, Mew, and Reflect Zapdos. An Impish nature is chosen over Adamant to give Sandslash an easier time switching into the likes of Rhydon and Mega Beedrill.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Sandslash can come in on Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl and Rhydon to try to find opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Toxic should be used liberally early-game to cripple Sandslash's main checks like Mew and Starmie.

However, Alolan Sandslash's Speed stat and special bulk force it to rely a lot on Ice Shard to sweep, forcing it to be mostly played late-game. Furthermore, Ice / Steel gives it a double weakness to Fire and Fighting and a weakness to Ground, making Alolan Sandslash very weak to common coverage moves.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Set Information</h1> <p>Swords Dance gives Alolan Sandslash a much-needed boost in Attack to sweep. Ice Shard lets Alolan Sandslash sweep through weakened teams after a boost and makes it an excellent revenge killer against Dragonite. Earthquake offers some vital coverage, 2HKOing Melmetal after a boost and dealing massive damage to Alolan Muk even without a boost. Ice Punch is Alolan Sandslash's most powerful viable attack, which is useful for hitting Gyarados on the switch as well as OHKOing Sandslash and having a 68% chance to OHKO non-Impish Rhydon after Stealth Rock when boosted.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Since Alolan Sandslash is so reliant on Ice Shard to sweep, it's usually best to save sending out Alolan Sandslash until late-game, when sweeping with it becomes a feasible win condition. There are a few times where Alolan Sandslash can revenge kill certain Pokemon with Ice Shard, particularly Pokemon weak to it such as Dragonite. Switching into Alolan Sandslash early is acceptable in these cases, though setting up Swords Dance is risky. While Alolan Sandslash has an excellent range of resistances, keeping it as healthy as possible increases the chances of sweeping by allowing it to take one big hit without resorting to priority, such as Melmetal's Earthquake.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock setters are extremely important, since chip damage is key to setting up a sweep for Alolan Sandslash. Mew is an excellent example thanks to its Fighting-type resistance and ability to deal with Poliwrath. Other options like Aerodactyl, Rhydon, and Alolan Dugtrio still work, though you should note that the latter two share a lot of checks with Alolan Sandslash. Starmie and Mega Gyarados are particularly good options for covering Alolan Sandslash's Fire-type weakness (and Fighting-type weakness in Starmie's case). You'll want some checks to some of Alolan Sandslash's biggest threats if you want to sweep. Poliwrath is one of the most notable ones due to its Ice-type resistance and good defensive typing, but Water-types in general such as Starmie and Mega Gyarados can be problematic, and general defensive coverage against Fighting-, Fire-, and Ground-type attacks is recommended. This makes Zapdos an excellent teammate for its resistance to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks and ability to hit Water-types hard. Psychic-types such as Mew and Starmie often scare Poliwrath out, though they must watch out for Toxic, while a Poliwrath of your own will do fairly well against Mega Gyarados and Fire-types. While it shares a Fire-type weakness, Mega Venusaur does particularly well against Poliwrath and Mega Gyarados.</p>"

Unfortunately, Nidoqueen shares these traits and outclasses it defensively, and Alolan Dugtrio overshadows it in terms of Speed and therefore often in offensive presence. Nidoking therefore acts as a versatile midground choice with greater power than both, greater Speed than Nidoqueen, and a better movepool and tanking ability than Alolan Dugtrio. Its reduced bulk compared to Nidoqueen gives Nidoking a worse matchup against many common metagame threats such as Alolan Dugtrio, Melmetal, and Mega Charizard X, but its range of attacking options and solid power make it near impossible to consistently switch into. Due to its increased offensive capability, it is less prone than Nidoqueen to being exploited by Pokemon like Cloyster and Gyarados, which can use Nidoqueen for a somewhat free turn. Before its set is properly scouted, many major metagame threats risk heavy damage from one of Nidoking's coverage options or being hamstrung by its perfectly accurate Toxic.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Superpower pressures Nidoking to switch out after use, but it KOes Snorlax after Earthquake, OHKOes Alolan Sandslash, OHKOes Eevee-S after Stealth Rock damage, and deals significant damage to Mega Gyarados. Surf guarantees an OHKO on Rhydon and Golem, which can otherwise take a hit and hit hard in return. Ice Beam is a slightly weaker alternative to Ice Punch that more reliably KOes Alolan Exeggutor after Stealth Rock damage and Sandslash after Earthquake. Substitute's HP cost can hinder Nidoking's ability to repeatedly switch into the likes of Zapdos and Alolan Muk, and the move can come at the cost of coverage, but it greatly eases the prediction typically required to handle Nidoking's switch-ins. Dragon Tail is hard to fit, but with good prediction, it can chip down and rack up Stealth Rock damage on switch-ins such as Starmie, Gyarados, and Mew. A Jolly or Naive nature can be used to guarantee that Nidoking outspeeds uncommon Jolly or Timid variants of Mega Gyarados and Mega Venusaur, but the power decrease is significant and decreases Nidoking's potential as a wallbreaker in most matchups.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew is able to switch into any Nidoking set and threaten it out with Psychic or Scald. However, it must be wary of a potential Toxic when switching in or Megahorn if it is weakened.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gyarados</strong>: Though Nidoking can potentially OHKO Gyarados with Thunderbolt if it switches in before Mega Evolving, Mega Gyarados can stomach Nidoking's Earthquake and Ice Punch and threaten an OHKO with Waterfall.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Starmie is capable of switching in on Earthquake or Ice Punch and recovering off the damage while heavily threatening Nidoking with its STAB moves, although it must be wary of switching into Megahorn. Poliwrath, Mega Blastoise, and Vaporeon have even less immediate fear of Nidoking, but they lack recovery and can be outsped, making them more vulnerable to fainting to repeated hits.</p> <p><strong>Fast Revenge Killers</strong>: Though Nidoking's coverage largely lacks safe switch-ins, its middling Speed tier allows it to be easily revenge killed by fast attackers like Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Alakazam, and Alolan Dugtrio.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Mega Venusaur cannot switch in and safely handle Nidoking on-on-one, but if given safe entry, such as from Zapdos's U-turn, it can beat Nidoking while remaining relatively healthy overall.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Earthquake is a spammable STAB option, hitting almost any grounded target hard and punishing Zapdos's Roost attempts. Ice Punch does great damage to Flying- and Grass-types, such as Zapdos, Dragonite, and Alolan Exeggutor, that can handle Earthquake. Toxic is a good midground option when you are unsure of the opponent's switch-in and a reliable means of threatening Mew, which can easily shrug off Earthquake. Alternatively, Megahorn can be used to catch certain switch-ins, KOing a weakened Mew, usually OHKOing Starmie, and 2HKOing Mega Gyarados. Stealth Rock provides invaluable support for any team not packing another setter and aids Nidoking in breaking targets such as Zapdos and Melmetal, while Toxic or Thunderbolt can be opted for instead if they are not already being run. Thunderbolt with a Naughty nature takes advantage of Gyarados that are hesitant to Mega Evolve and become vulnerable to Earthquake and Megahorn, usually OHKOing it after Stealth Rock, and can also OHKO Cloyster, which otherwise uses Nidoking as setup fodder. Adamant is the preferred nature for Nidoking when not running Thunderbolt, notably giving it extremely favorable odds to 2HKO Melmetal on the switch with Earthquake.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Nidoking is best used as a wallbreaker that can be adapted to any strategy and soften defensive backbones for its teammates. Its true strength comes from its unpredictable coverage, often in the form of moves not listed on its main set that are specifically tailored for luring in and taking out Pokemon your team struggles with. As a result, it's generally best to not reveal information about your set until it is necessary. Nidoking outspeeds many Pokemon that would try to come in to scare it out or set Stealth Rock. In those cases, predicting is unnecessary, as Nidoking can simply hit them the next turn. If running Stealth Rock, Nidoking should be played more conservatively until it successfully sets up the entry hazard; if not, it can be used more recklessly, but it should still be preserved if needed to answer Zapdos. Setting Stealth Rock against Zapdos is ideal, as it is unable to significantly punish Nidoking for doing so. Nidoking can be brought in fairly safely versus Pokemon such as Zapdos, Alolan Muk, and Electrode, as they rarely carry moves that can significantly threaten it. While it can be tempting to sacrifice a heavily weakened Nidoking, its decent Speed tier, resistance to Stealth Rock, and powerful Earthquake mean that it can still be valuable for revenge killing tanks like Rhydon and Melmetal.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Beedrill and Zapdos are amazing partners for Nidoking, luring in and pivoting on Pokemon such as Melmetal, Rhydon, and Nidoqueen that Nidoking can then heavily threaten with Earthquake. Mew appreciates Nidoking as a partner that can absorb Toxic for it, making its defensive roles easier to perform, while Nidoking appreciates U-turn granting it safe entry against Mew's switch-ins such as Alolan Muk and Zapdos. Mew can also soft check threats like Starmie and Alolan Dugtrio. Pokemon such as Starmie and Poliwrath greatly benefit from Nidoking freely switching into every move from Zapdos bar Drill Peck and dishing out strong attacks. Starmie also has synergy with Nidoking, switching into Alolan Dugtrio and opposing Poliwrath, while Poliwrath can provide a valuable switch-in for Mega Gyarados if Nidoking needs to be preserved. Melmetal makes for a great teammate, as it can handle Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Alakazam. In return, Nidoking can be switched into Zapdos that attempt to check Melmetal. Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Alakazam also appreciate Nidoking's support in weakening foes into range of their attacks and crippling Mew with Toxic.</p>"

It's one of the few Pokemon with access to Nasty Plot, which, alongside its unique typing that gives it solid coverage with just its STAB moves, makes it quite threatening on paper. Its ability to outrun Pokemon like Mew and Zapdos helps with this, and access to support moves that give it setup opportunities like Encore and Hypnosis makes it even scarier, as it can potentially incapacitate one of its counters. Unfortunately, its low Special Attack means that even after a boost, it's too weak to OHKO most targets. Its attacks have a low Base Power, too, which doesn't help matters at all. On top of all this, it doesn't have a great way to hit Steel-types, which is massively problematic in a metagame dominated by Melmetal. All of this combined means that Alolan Ninetales is pretty hard to justify on a team and leaves it generally outclassed by similar setup sweepers like Mega Alakazam and Nasty Plot Mew, as well as other niche setup sweepers such as Alolan Persian and Alolan Raichu.</p>",

Ice Shard can be used over Dark Pulse to help with revenge killing Dragonite, but Alolan Ninetales has an awful Attack stat, so it doesn't really do that much damage. Blizzard can be used over Dark Pulse too, being a very powerful attack that outdamages a super effective Dark Pulse if the target doesn't resist Ice, and it also outdamages a neutral Dark Pulse on the likes of Melmetal. Its accuracy can be disappointing, though.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Melmetal is a perfect counter to Alolan Ninetales, being able to stomach any of its hits and OHKO it in return with Double Iron Bash. While Alolan Sandslash can't OHKO Alolan Ninetales, it can take attacks and retaliate with Earthquake for some damage.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Alolan Muk is a good defensive answer to Alolan Ninetales, using its great special bulk to tank hits and do a lot of damage in return with Fire Blast or the rare Poison Jab. Mega Beedrill and Gengar can't switch into Alolan Ninetales, but they can both outspeed and revenge kill it with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: While rare, certain Fire-types can handle Alolan Ninetales quite well.

        "description": "<h1>Set Information</h1> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Alolan Ninetales's Special Attack to threatening levels, allowing it to break through frailer Pokemon and clean up weakened teams. Ice Beam nets good coverage on the tier and hits Pokemon like Rhydon and Nidoqueen very hard. Dazzling Gleam is used a secondary STAB attack that breaks through Dark-types like Mega Gyarados. Dark Pulse is the most consistent option in the last slot, getting a harder hit on Mew and Melmetal. Encore can also be used, as locking a foe into a move like Stealth Rock can give Alolan Ninetales setup opportunities. Hypnosis is another option, potentially incapacitating a check like Melmetal; its shaky accuracy makes it unreliable, though.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bring Alolan Ninetales in via VoltTurn support or on double switches; it's not bulky enough to switch into anything, and its poor defensive typing doesn't help it. Bringing it in when a teammate faints works too. Try to set up on Pokemon that cannot OHKO Alolan Ninetales like Sandslash, Substitute Mega Gyarados, and Zapdos. Don't set up until Pokemon like Melmetal and Mew have been weakened significantly, as they can easily grind Alolan Ninetales's sweep to a halt. If a faster revenge killer like Mega Beedrill or Mega Aerodactyl is still alive on the opponent's team, try to take it out before attempting to sweep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Good Melmetal checks are always necessary, but this is doubly true when using Alolan Ninetales. Pokemon like Mega Gyarados, Zapdos, and Poliwrath are all great teammates for this reason. Contrarily, teammates that appreciate Melmetal being weakened like Dragonite, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Aerodactyl are excellent, as Alolan Ninetales is one of the most reliable ways of forcing chip damage on Melmetal. Melmetal itself is also a good teammate, being able to handle Pokemon like Mega Beedrill and Mega Aerodactyl for Alolan Ninetales. Starmie is a good teammate thanks to its ability to handle Fire-types like Mega Charizard X, as well as acting as a backup check to Melmetal. Nasty Plot Mew is an effective teammate that shares many checks with Alolan Ninetales; this means that they can break through Pokemon like Melmetal and Alolan Muk for each other, enabling their partner's sweep. Stealth Rock support is helpful when using Alolan Ninetales, as many of its best offensive checks like Mega Aerodactyl are weak to it. Setters like Rhydon, Sandslash, and Nidoqueen are all good teammates. Dual screens support from Electrode can be helpful to give Alolan Ninetales more setup opportunities, as the boost in bulk makes Alolan Ninetales quite tough to take down.</p>"

  "Primeape": {
    "overview": "<p>Primeape distinguishes itself among the various Fighting-types in LGPE OU by virtue of its access to U-turn, allowing it to function as a fearsome pivot that can take advantage of common checks such as Mew and Zapdos. This, in tandem with Primeape's access to plentiful coverage options and a strong Low Kick, gives it a decent niche as an all-out attacker. Furthermore, Primeape's decent Speed tier enables it to be effective against common foes like Dragonite and Gyarados. However, its Speed stat is not amazing and leaves it susceptible to prominent threats such as Mega Alakazam, Mega Aerodactyl, and Starmie. Furthermore, Primeape faces competition from other Fighting-types such as Poliwrath, Machamp, and Hitmonlee that possess better defensive or offensive capabilities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Poison Jab threatens Clefable, but the loss of better coverage moves or U-turn is not ideal. Bulk Up can turn Primeape into a fearsome offensive presence, but it is generally inconsistent due to Primeape's subpar Speed stat and mediocre defenses. Toxic is able to cripple Mew as it switches in, but Primeape struggles to fit the move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew outspeeds Primeape and can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp or KO it with Psychic. However, Mew should be wary of potentially switching into a U-turn or being inflicted with Toxic poison.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Although Mega Alakazam, Starmie, and Mega Aerodactyl cannot directly switch into Primeape due to the fear of U-turn or Ice Punch, they can easily outspeed and revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos takes minimal damage from Low Kick and can 2HKO Primeape with Drill Peck. However, it dislikes switching into an Ice Punch or Rock Slide and must be wary of carelessly using Roost due to Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Mega Venusaur's impressive bulk allows it to absorb hits—even Ice Punch—from Primeape and 2HKO it back with Mega Drain or Sludge Bomb.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Set Information</h1> <p>Low Kick is Primeape's most powerful STAB move, 2HKOing Melmetal and Rhydon while also dealing with prominent threats such as Mega Gyarados and Snorlax. Ice Punch OHKOes Dragonite and pressures Zapdos, Nidoqueen, and Mega Venusaur. Earthquake allows Primeape to break through common foes like Mega Charizard X, Alolan Muk, and Gengar; deals more damage to neutral targets like Mew on a missed prediction; and can potentially threaten Zapdos after Roost. Thunder Punch serves as coverage for Water-types such as Gyarados, Poliwrath, and Vaporeon and OHKOes Mega Charizard Y after Stealth Rock damage. U-turn allows Primeape to function as an offensive pivot, establishing momentum by switching out against checks such as Mew and Zapdos. An Adamant nature is preferred for the damage output, although a Jolly nature can be utilized to outspeed Nidoking and neutral-natured variants of Mew and Zapdos.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Primeape is best utilized early- and mid-game as a wallbreaker, threatening common Stealth Rock setters such as Rhydon, Nidoqueen, and Alolan Dugtrio with super effective coverage to prevent Stealth Rock from being set up. Primeape should utilize U-turn to retain offensive momentum, allowing it to escape from checks such as Mew and Zapdos while bringing in a suitable answer such as Alolan Muk against the former or Rhydon against the latter. Furthermore, Primeape can take advantage of its various coverage options to weaken its numerous checks, although that requires careful predictions.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alolan Muk synergizes well with Primeape, serving as a check to Psychic-types such as Mew, Mega Alakazam, and Starmie. In return, Primeape can threaten Rhydon, Alolan Dugtrio, and Melmetal, which give Alolan Muk trouble. Partners like Starmie can switch into the aforementioned foes and weaken them, ensuring that Primeape can KO them consistently. Ground-types such as Nidoqueen, Alolan Dugtrio, and Rhydon provide Stealth Rock support to weaken foes while serving as checks to Zapdos, with Alolan Dugtrio also checking the aforementioned Psychic-types. Melmetal and the aforementioned Rhydon also function as physical walls against notable revenge killers such as Mega Aerodactyl. Powerful wallbreakers and sweepers such as Mega Alakazam, Mega Beedrill, and Gengar can take advantage of U-turn from Primeape to safely switch into battle and threaten its checks such as Mega Venusaur and Mew. Mega Beedrill is a notable partner, providing U-turn support to safely bring Primeape into battle while Primeape can return the favor by pressuring Melmetal.</p>"

Poliwrath also has a solid offensive movepool, including strong STAB attacks in Superpower and Waterfall, coverage moves like Earthquake, and more consistent methods of damaging the foe like Seismic Toss and Low Kick. However, the presence of Psychic-types such as Starmie, Mega Alakazam, and Mew and Flying-types such as Zapdos and Dragonite makes Poliwrath a complete liability at times. It is also weak to Electric-type moves, which are quite common in the metagame, and its rather mediocre Speed tier gives Pokemon such as Zapdos and Starmie the potential to easily take it out. Lastly, Poliwrath lacks reliable recovery, so it is prone to being worn down over time.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Poliwrath has access to Hypnosis, which is rare among Pokemon of its type and can be utilized to cripple common switch-ins like Mega Venusaur. It's rather inaccurate, though. Ice Punch can serve as a good coverage move against Dragonite and Mega Venusaur, but it otherwise has little use. Rest can be used in conjunction with Eevee-S to give Poliwrath recovery, but it isn't the most reliable, since at minimum this strategy takes four turns to execute. A more defensive set can be utilized to take advantage of Poliwrath's good bulk and defensive typing, but this set often lacks firepower and as such can be quite passive.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Mew and Starmie can easily outspeed Poliwrath and take it out, in addition to not taking much damage from Poliwrath's moves. They do fear Toxic, however.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite doesn't appreciate Toxic or the niche Ice Punch, but it can switch in on Poliwrath's other moves and take advantage of it by setting up with Agility.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos is one of the most notable counters to Poliwrath, as it resists Poliwrath's Fighting-type STAB attacks, is immune to Ground, outspeeds it, and can easily take it out with Thunderbolt. Electrode doesn't like switching into most of Poliwrath's moves, but it similarly can outspeed Poliwrath and 2HKO with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Mega Venusaur can tank any hit from Poliwrath and easily recover with Mega Drain. It is also immune to Toxic.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Set Information</h1> <p>Strong STAB options such as Superpower and Waterfall allow Poliwrath to not remain too passive in a match. Alternatively, Low Kick can be used over Superpower as a reliable option against Pokemon like Melmetal, Mega Gyarados, and Snorlax and avoids lowering Poliwrath's stats, although one must note it's not the strongest attack against certain Pokemon like Eevee-S. Scald similarly can be used over Waterfall with a Relaxed nature to deal as much damage as Earthquake on Melmetal, hit physically defensive Pokemon harder, and spread burns, which can be devastating to many of the Pokemon Poliwrath checks. Toxic is used to cripple common switch-ins to Poliwrath like Mew, Starmie, and Zapdos. Seismic Toss provides a more reliable method of damage output against Pokemon that resist Poliwrath's STAB moves like Clefable and Mega Venusaur, in addition to being a damaging move that's still reliable when Poliwrath gets burned. Alternatively, Earthquake is notable for hitting Alolan Muk and Mega Charizard X. An Impish nature is used to increase Poliwrath's bulk, giving it more opportunities to switch into the Pokemon it checks without lowering its damage output or Speed. However, when using Scald over Waterfall, Relaxed is preferred, which still gives a Defense boost while dropping Speed, one of Poliwrath's less important stats.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Poliwrath's resistances to Steel, Rock, and Dark and good bulk can be utilized to easily switch it in on Pokemon like Melmetal and Mega Gyarados. Superpower is mainly used as a strong attacking option if there are no better options. It is recommended to switch out Poliwrath after Superpower has been used, since the stat drops make Poliwrath easier to take advantage of. Earthquake is generally to be used when a Pokemon like Alolan Muk or Gengar is switching in rather than as a regular attack. When against Melmetal, Poliwrath can use either Scald or Earthquake to soften it up before using Superpower. However, one must be wary of Thunder Punch.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alolan Muk can take advantage of the Psychic-types that generally counter Poliwrath thanks to its Dark typing, in addition to being a reliable check to Gengar. In return, Poliwrath can handle Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados and Melmetal. Eevee-S's Sparkly Swirl can be used to heal status off Poliwrath, as Poliwrath doesn't like being paralyzed or burned. It also means that Poliwrath can more freely utilize moves like Rest. Mega Aerodactyl or even regular Aerodactyl can take care of the Flying-types that Poliwrath struggles with while also setting up Stealth Rock to increase the potency of Poliwrath's damage output.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Alakazam and its Mega counterpart are both terrifying revenge killers that can swiftly sweep teams, especially late-game. An outstanding base 150 Speed stat after Mega Evolving enables Mega Alakazam to outspeed the entire metagame bar Mega Aerodactyl and Electrode, which both Speed tie it. Mega Alakazam also packs great power alongside a decent special movepool to complement it, with options such as Shadow Ball and Dazzling Gleam alongside its STAB attack allowing it to hit the majority of the metagame for at least neutral damage. Calm Mind further increases its offensive prowess to frightening levels. Unfortunately, despite great Special Defense, Mega Alakazam bears little to no defensive presence due to abysmal HP and Defense, meaning it will often rely on foddering a teammate or pivoting in order to come in safely. Checks such as Melmetal and Alolan Muk are seen on a majority of teams, meaning that Mega Alakazam can often struggle to break through teams carrying the aforementioned threats unless they have been significantly worn down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute can be a great way to punish switches, as it allows Mega Alakazam to get off at least two hits in the majority of cases. However, foregoing coverage options can hamper Mega Alakazam's ability to dent checks such as Alolan Muk and Melmetal. Encore can be used to lock opposing Pokemon into non-harmful moves such as Stealth Rock and recovery options as well as generally weak moves that do not dent Mega Alakazam greatly. However, as with Substitute, Mega Alakazam often lacks the ability to pull off this option without risking a worse matchup against its checks.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Alolan Muk</strong>: Alolan Muk is one of the only viable Dark-types in the tier apart from Mega Gyarados, meaning it can switch into Mega Alakazam's STAB Psychic safely, while its additional Poison typing offers it a neutrality to Dazzling Gleam. However, Alolan Muk is prone to being worn down and can be chipped enough to the point where Mega Alakazam can KO.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Dugtrio</strong>: Alolan Dugtrio can threaten to revenge kill Mega Alakazam with Sucker Punch before it even has the chance to retaliate, however it cannot switch into Mega Alakazam's coverage moves safely unless it is at near full health.</p> <p><strong>Melmetal</strong>: While Melmetal may not posses the greatest Special Defense, its typing still offers it the chance to tank STAB Psychic from Mega Alakazam at least twice, while it can OHKO Mega Alakazam with its own STAB move in return. However, Shadow Ball can still severely dent Melmetal, especially if Mega Alakazam is offered the chance to set up a Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Snorlax</strong>: Chansey and Snorlax's high special bulk enables them to switch into Mega Alakazam comfortably, as they can usually avoid being 2HKOed, while the former can cripple Mega Alakazam via Thunder Wave, and the latter can threaten to OHKO it with Facade. However, Snorlax's lack of reliable recovery means it cannot switch into Mega Alakazam repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gyarados</strong>: Once Mega Evolved, Mega Gyarados can check Mega Alakazam by switching into Psychic and Shadow Ball with little remorse and threaten to OHKO it in return with Crunch. However, it must look out for Dazzling Gleam, especially when Stealth Rock is up, as Mega Alakazam can easily 2HKO it.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Set Information</h1> <p>Psychic is Mega Alakazam's most powerful STAB option and can break through the majority of its targets while providing a small chance to lower the foe's Special Defense to ease breaking through it. Dazzling Gleam hits Alolan Muk for neutral damage, providing Mega Alakazam the chance to chip it down every time it is forced in. It also has the added benefit of 2HKOing Mega Gyarados after Stealth Rock damage, enabling Mega Alakazam to circumvent an otherwise nuisance to it. Shadow Ball complements Psychic well, targeting Steel- and Psychic-types such as Melmetal and Mew that resist Psychic. Calm Mind can boost Mega Alakazam's offensive presence even further, enabling it to sweep late-game once checks such as Alolan Muk and Melmetal have been significantly weakened. Recover can be useful as a means to increase Mega Alakazam's longevity; however, its poor defenses deny it many chances from doing so often. Furthermore, using Recover forces Mega Alakazam to forego one of its coverage options, meaning that it can have a much more difficult time sweeping when dealing with opposing checks. A Timid nature enables Mega Alakazam to outspeed as many threats as possible alongside letting it Speed tie with Mega Aerodactyl. A Modest nature can be used to offer Mega Alakazam the chance to score 2HKOs against the likes of Melmetal and Snorlax after Stealth Rock. However, this leaves Mega Alakazam outsped by Mega Beedrill and loses out on the Speed tie against Mega Aerodactyl and Electrode.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Alakazam should not be directly switched into attacks, as the majority of moderately strong attackers threaten to OHKO it. Therefore, it is advised to bring it in safely through slow pivoting or by foddering off another teammate. While Mega Alakazam should be spamming its STAB attack the majority of the time, Dazzling Gleam and Shadow Ball should be used to target common switch-ins such as Alolan Muk and Melmetal which Mega Alakazam often forces in and can chip down severely with repeated attacks. Calm Mind should be used versus special attackers or when Mega Alakazam can force a switch out, as its meager defenses dissuade it from stacking boosts safely. Additionally, Mega Alakazam shouldn't set up until checks such as Alolan Muk and Snorlax are in range of boosted attacks, preventing any halts in a sweep. Beware of priority users such as Sucker Punch Alolan Dugtrio, as it can threaten to KO Mega Alakazam before it can even inflict any damage itself.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Team members such as Nidoqueen and Poliwrath that can help deal with checks such as Alolan Muk and Melmetal are much appreciated. Other offensive threats such as Dragonite, Melmetal, and Alolan Dugtrio can help apply pressure to Mega Alakazam's common switch-ins, while they appreciate Mega Alakazam's ability to revenge kill threatening foes such as Mega Beedrill and Starmie. Alolan Dugtrio also provides Stealth Rock support, which can get crucial chip damage on the opposing team. Pivots such as Mew and Zapdos enable Mega Alakazam to come in more frequently without needing to sacrifice another teammate in order to bring it safely. Mew can also effectively lure in and remove some of Mega Alakazam's checks such as Alolan Muk when running coverage options such as Earthquake and set up moves such as Bulk Up, increasing Mega Alakazam's sweeping potential.</p>"

  "Machamp": {
    "overview": "<p>Machamp has a lot of competition as a niche Fighting-type Pokemon in LGPE OU, with Poliwrath providing greater defensive utility thanks to its additional Water typing, Hitmonlee having a more spammable STAB move in High Jump Kick and a better Speed tier, and Primeape providing an effective pivot with its access to U-turn. What Machamp offers is a midground between Poliwrath and Hitmonlee, with very similar bulk to Poliwrath and attacking power similar to Hitmonlee—in fact, its coverage moves hit harder than Hitmonlee's thanks to its superior Attack stat. This extra level of offensive threat compared to Poliwrath makes it better at forcing Mew to switch in and risk taking a Toxic. Its lack of a Water typing also has upsides defensively and notably allows it to trade blows with standard Zapdos and Mega Venusaur far better than Poliwrath can. These traits combine to make Machamp a respectable tank that excels at handling many Pokemon one-on-one and is capable of specifically threatening popular Pokemon like Melmetal, Rhydon, Snorlax, and Alolan Muk. Machamp's main downside is its extremely poor matchup against Mew, which comfortably counters it even when inflicted with Toxic and is on almost every competitive team. Having such a consistent switch-in greatly limits Machamp's ability to perform the damage trades it is used for, but when supported by its teammates against Mew it can still perform respectably.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Poison Jab can be used to hit Clefable hard and occasionally poison a switch-in such as Mew, but it is extremely hard to justify over any standard option due to how redundant it is otherwise. Encore can be used to catch opposing Pokemon off guard by, for example, locking them into using Earthquake or Roost and then exploiting that with the likes of Swords Dance Dodrio, but Machamp's slowness and tendency to force offensive responses make it quite poorly suited for this role. Rock Slide deals great damage to Mega Charizard Y and Moltres, but this is fairly unimportant, as these Pokemon are destroyed by Stealth Rock and can potentially have their Roosts punished by Earthquake. Thunder Punch deals the most damage to Starmie and Poliwrath out of any of Machamp's options, handily 2HKOing both after Stealth Rock damage and making it hard for Starmie to safely use Recover, but Earthquake 2HKOes Starmie lacking Reflect after Stealth Rock damage anyway and Poliwrath is hit almost as hard by Low Kick while not posing much of a threat in return. Facade can enable Machamp to threaten Scald Mew, especially if Mew is also taking Toxic damage, but it is entirely useless if Scald fails to burn Machamp and can be hard to fit on a moveset.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon</strong>: Mew can take any of Machamp's attacks with ease, heal with Roost, and threaten back with Psychic, Scald, or Will-O-Wisp; it dislikes being inflicted with Toxic, but it counters Machamp even when that is accounted for. Mega Alakazam, Starmie, and Alolan Raichu don't take Earthquake as well as Mew does, but they can switch in on Machamp's STAB attack if necessary and threaten it with a powerful Psychic. Exeggutor can switch in on Machamp's STAB attack and Earthquake with ease and retaliate with Psychic or Sleep Powder, but it is a risky check, as it Speed ties with Machamp and is 2HKOed by Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Mega Aerodactyl</strong>: While not a switch-in, Mega Aerodactyl can pick off a weakened Machamp with Wing Attack quite easily. If the Machamp has set up with Bulk Up, however, this may prove more difficult.</p> <p><strong>Clefable</strong>: While many Pokemon can handle Machamp one-on-one, Clefable is unique among Pokemon that aren't Psychic-type for not being weak to any of Machamp's attacks, letting it avoid a 2HKO from any of its moves after Stealth Rock and retaliate with a strong super effective STAB Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Mega Venusaur can handle Machamp decently, resisting its STAB attack, tanking Ice Punch respectably, and threatening it with Sleep Powder, but it can struggle to do enough immediate damage in return to win one-on-one.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Set Information</h1> <p>Low Kick, while weaker against many targets, is Machamp's most spammable STAB option and deals massive damage to Melmetal. Superpower is an alternative that isn't as spammable but guarantees a hard hit against anything that doesn't resist it, making it more suited to a hit-and-run playstyle. As such, it should never be used alongside Bulk Up. Ice Punch provides near-perfect coverage when paired with Machamp's STAB attack, most importantly threatening Zapdos and Mega Venusaur. Earthquake OHKOes Gengar, 2HKOes Starmie and Mega Charizard X, does more to Alolan Muk and Nidoqueen than any other option, and punishes Zapdos using Roost, making it the best option for maximizing Machamp's immediate offensive capabilities. Bulk Up can be quite fearsome if Mew is dealt with, making Machamp capable of feats such as OHKOing Melmetal with Low Kick, but Machamp's low Speed means that sweeping is very unlikely, and it requires smart use in order to be effective. The same is true for Substitute, which lets Machamp more safely punish predicted switches or guard against revenge killing. Toxic is vital for punishing Mew, which can otherwise easily switch in and wall Machamp with no risk, and also improves Machamp's ability to threaten Zapdos and Starmie.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Machamp's low number of resistances means that it isn't a good switch-in to most Pokemon, but its solid bulk makes it capable of taking on prominent Pokemon such as Rhydon, Melmetal, and Mega Gyarados one-on-one. As such, it is often most effective when provided safe entry via a slow U-turn or after a KO. Opponents may try to use Zapdos, Mew, and Starmie as midground switch-ins that can heal off hits; predicting this and using Toxic greatly increases Machamp's effectiveness. As most other bulky Pokemon are slower than Machamp or don't heavily threaten it, predicting them to switch in is not as vital. When facing down healthy Melmetal and Rhydon, Bulk Up can be used to guarantee an OHKO on them on the following turn while taking as little damage as possible in the process—however, if damage on these targets is important for teammates, it may be smarter to immediately attack them, as they would be likely to switch out after you use Bulk Up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Machamp struggles immensely with Psychic-type Pokemon, and as a result their best answer, Alolan Muk, makes for a great teammate. In return, Alolan Muk appreciates Machamp's ability to threaten Ground-types like Nidoqueen, Rhydon, and Alolan Dugtrio one-on-one. Machamp benefits greatly from U-turn users that can help it switch into favorable matchups safely, most notably Mew and Zapdos; these two in particular greatly appreciate Machamp's proficiency at tackling the likes of Mega Gyarados, Alolan Muk, Alolan Dugtrio, and Nidoqueen one-on-one, which are some of their most prominent switch-ins. Mew can also provide Stealth Rock support to help in wearing down Machamp switch-ins like Zapdos and opposing Mew. Mega Beedrill is another pivot and can make use of Machamp to apply further pressure to its most common defensive answers, namely Melmetal and Rhydon, and put Zapdos in range of its Poison Jab. In return, Machamp greatly appreciates Mega Beedrill's ability to outspeed and threaten its best answer, Mew, with massive damage. Melmetal is a great secondary measure for handling Mega Alakazam and Wing Attack Mega Aerodactyl, two Pokemon that Machamp fears, and in turn it appreciates not being the team's only tank so its valuable HP can be preserved.</p>"

It even has Sucker Punch in order to pick off frail or weakened Pokemon that could otherwise outspeed and KO it, like Mega Alakazam and Starmie. Victreebel's main flaw is its lack of coverage, which leaves it walled and destroyed by the omnipresent Melmetal. Outside of its offenses, Victreebel's stats are extremely lacking, meaning most fast Pokemon can KO it easily if they survive a Sucker Punch, and most bulky Pokemon can do the same if they survive Power Whip.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Leech Life is an option for Victreebel over Poison Jab or Sleep Powder, as combined with Swords Dance, the recovery it provides can allow Victreebel to survive an extra attack from tanks like Alolan Muk. However, the move's typing does not do Victreebel many favors offensively, and dropping STAB move for it is generally not recommended.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Melmetal</strong>: Melmetal can take any attack Victreebel throws at it, even at +2. It also threatens an OHKO after Stealth Rock with Double Iron Bash.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar commonly carries Will-O-Wisp and resists all of Victreebel's STAB attacks, allowing it to shut down Victreebel without being consistently beaten by Sucker Punch. In addition, Gengar can take advantage of a predicted Sucker Punch or Sleep Powder by setting up Substitute and become difficult to remove without sacrificing a Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite can use its resistance to Power Whip to set up Agility and heal off any damage with Roost, though it must be wary of taking a Sleep Powder or +2 Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew is the only viable Psychic-type in the tier that is not OHKOed by a +2 Sucker Punch. It also frequently carries Taunt, Roost, and Will-O-Wisp to stop Victreebel from punishing it with Sleep Powder or Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Drill Peck Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos resists Power Whip, has excellent bulk, and carries Roost, so it can frequently stop Victreebel from running rampant.</p> <p><strong>Mega Aerodactyl</strong>: If Mega Aerodactyl is carrying Wing Attack, it is capable of OHKOing Victreebel after Stealth Rock.

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Sucker Punch allows Victreebel to overcome its poor Speed stat by outprioritizing the faster Pokemon that attempt to deal with it offensively such as Mega Venusaur, Mega Beedrill, Starmie, and Mega Alakazam. Power Whip threatens Pokemon like Rhydon, Golem, and Sandslash with an OHKO and forces them out. Swords Dance allows Victreebel to attain an immense Attack stat and forces the opponent to play around the possibility of a +2 Sucker Punch and a +2 Power Whip at the same time. While somewhat unreliable, Sleep Powder allows Victreebel to put any non-Grass-type out of commission as it comes in to deal with Victreebel, granting it turns to set up and become extremely offensively threatening. Poison Jab forgoes these turns in favor of a strong, spammable STAB move that can be useful against slower teams and notably helps with KOing weakened Zapdos and Dragonite. While an Adamant nature is preferred for its significant power increase, a Jolly nature can be useful for avoiding a Speed tie with Poliwrath and outspeeding neutral natured Nidoqueen and Eevee-S.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Victreebel is generally very prediction reliant and only becomes truly threatening versus neutral targets when it has set up with Swords Dance. Due to this, Victreebel should be brought in versus Stealth Rock or Toxic users that are slower than it, like Rhydon and Poliwrath, on the turn they use their status moves. Setting up Victreebel when there are obvious Grass-type answers like Venusaur on your opponent's team is a good idea, as at +2, Victreebel can beat them one-on-one with Sucker Punch if Stealth Rock is up. If your opponent lacks a Grass-type but has an otherwise excellent switch-in for Victreebel, like Charizard or Melmetal, using Sleep Powder can not only shut down a potent threat but also give you several turns to swap around or boost. In situations where the opposing Pokemon is in range of a Sucker Punch and you've already revealed it, using Sleep Powder or Power Whip can be a good way to punish a cheeky switch.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Aerodactyl appreciates Victreebel's ability to draw in Melmetal and Venusaur and chip them into range of its moves with Power Whip and Sucker Punch, respectively. Zapdos benefits from Victreebel's ability to pressure Ground-types like Rhydon and Sandslash, and, in return, Victreebel appreciates Zapdos's U-turn for free entry into a favorable matchup against incoming Ground-types. In addition, Zapdos is one of the only Pokemon in the metagame that can switch into all of Melmetal's attacks, which Victreebel lets in for free. Mega Beedrill is a powerful U-turn user that can bring Victreebel into favorable matchups, as it tends to bait in Rhydon. It also appreciates Victreebel's ability to lure in Melmetal and put it to sleep, hindering its ability to counter Mega Beedrill throughout the game.</p> <p>Alolan Dugtrio, Mega Charizard X, and Sandslash particularly appreciate Starmie being removed, which Victreebel is capable of baiting in and OHKOing with a +2 Sucker Punch. Other Water-types, like Mega Gyarados and Vaporeon, can be heavily pressured by Victreebel, but it generally cannot safely come in on either.</p>"

  "Golem": {
    "overview": "<p>Golem competes with Rhydon as a Stealth Rock setter due to the two of them having identical typing and similar Attack and physical bulk. It distinguishes itself from Rhydon with its access to Explosion, allowing it to devastate most of its switch-ins while maintaining offensive momentum. Furthermore, a slightly higher Speed stat allows it to outspeed Sassy Alolan Muk while running an Impish nature. However, Rhydon's better HP and Attack stats let it perform better as a Stealth Rock setter and physical wall throughout a battle. Golem's selling point in Explosion and otherwise worse offensive presence mean that the user often has to sacrifice their Ground-type to leave a significant mark, leaving them more vulnerable to threats like Zapdos, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Aerodactyl and making Golem the less reliable option for this role overall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder Punch and Fire Punch provide coverage against Water- and Grass-types, respectively. However, Golem cannot take full advantage of both moves due to its low Speed, making them fairly unreliable when compared to Explosion. Toxic can be utilized to cripple switch-ins to Golem such as Mew, Poliwrath, and Starmie.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Mega Gyarados, Poliwrath, and Starmie outspeed Golem and pressure it immensely with their STAB moves. Starmie is a notable counter, exploiting Golem's poor special bulk with Scald and shrugging off Earthquake damage with Recover. However, all three of them should be wary of directly switching into an Explosion or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Alolan Exeggutor take minimal damage from Golem and can KO it with Mega Drain. The former is also immune to Toxic, making it harder to bypass.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Will-O-Wisp from Gengar and Mew weaken Golem's offensive capabilities, while Toxic from Pokemon such as Zapdos and Nidoking puts it on a timer, limiting its ability to switch in and check these threats.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew outspeeds Golem and can OHKO it with Scald. Furthermore, it can limit Golem's offensive and Stealth Rock setting capabilities with other options such as Will-O-Wisp and Taunt.</p>",

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h1>Set Information</h1> <p>Stealth Rock allows Golem to fulfill its role as an entry hazard setter and support its teammates. Earthquake is a spammable STAB move that threatens Alolan Muk, Rhydon, Melmetal, and Gengar. Rock Slide complements Earthquake by serving as coverage against prominent threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Beedrill, and Zapdos. Explosion provides immense damage against most targets and generates momentum by allowing you to switch in a check or counter to the foe. An Impish nature increases Golem's overall longevity, while Adamant increases the effectiveness of Explosion and notably allows Golem to reliably OHKO Zapdos and Mega Aerodactyl after Stealth Rock damage with Rock Slide.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Ideally, Golem should be utilized early-game to set up Stealth Rock as soon as possible. It can switch in on foes such as Zapdos and Mega Beedrill to safely get up Stealth Rock, wearing down future pivots. However, Golem should be wary of switching directly into U-turn. After getting up Stealth Rock, Golem can be preserved as a check to the aforementioned Zapdos and Mega Beedrill. Golem can lure in opposing Water-types such as Poliwrath and Starmie and can utilize Explosion or Toxic to weaken them for the remainder of the battle.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Water-types such as Poliwrath and Starmie threaten Golem; checks to them such as Zapdos and Mega Venusaur are appreciated, allowing Golem to safely get up Stealth Rock. Offensive threats such as Mega Beedrill, Mega Charizard Y, Mega Gyarados, and Starmie appreciate Golem's ability to wear down and check Zapdos. Burn spreaders such as Mew, Eevee-S, and Gengar impair opposing threats such as Melmetal and Poliwrath, allowing Golem to potentially avoid a KO. Mew is a notable partner, threatening Mega Venusaur with Psychic and crippling Starmie with Will-O-Wisp while stopping recovery with Taunt. Snorlax can complement Golem by serving as a special wall and status absorber, empowering its own Facade. Melmetal possesses great synergy with Golem, checking Mega Beedrill and Mega Aerodactyl, allowing Golem to utilize Explosion without compromising the team's defensive backbone.</p>"

  "Dodrio": {
    "overview": "<p>Dodrio is a niche setup sweeper, carving itself a place in the meta thanks to its solid Speed tier, decent Attack stat, and access to Swords Dance. After it has attained a boost, Dodrio can cleave through weakened teams with ease thanks to its strong Drill Peck and good coverage in Jump Kick. Unfortunately for Dodrio, getting that boost in the first place can be quite the challenge thanks to its poor bulk and lacking defensive utility, and even if it manages to set up a Swords Dance, it can struggle to break through common Pokemon like Zapdos, Melmetal, and Rhydon. It's also outsped by some of the fastest Pokemon in the metagame, like Mega Aerodactyl, Starmie, and Mega Beedrill, all of which can revenge kill it; the latter must be wary of a boosted Quick Attack, though. This typically results in Dodrio struggling to find a place on teams over other setup sweepers like Mega Alakazam and Mew.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Facade can be used over Drill Peck as a stronger Normal-type STAB move that can also take advantage of status, giving Dodrio the ability to power through some Pokemon it'd otherwise struggle with like Zapdos and Will-O-Wisp Mew. Forgoing Drill Peck leaves Dodrio totally walled by Gengar, though, and means it struggles to break through Mega Venusaur and Poliwrath. Thrash can be used over Quick Attack on teams with heavy paralysis support, with its raw power allowing Dodrio to crush common checks like Zapdos and Mew, but its lock-in effect can be dangerous if the opponent still has a Pokemon like Melmetal or Gengar. Toxic can also be used to lure Pokemon like Zapdos and Mew, but once again, Dodrio struggles to fit the move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos is Dodrio's best counter, taking very little damage from any of its attacks and threatening it back with a strong Thunderbolt. It can switch into Dodrio at any point in the game and use it as an opportunity to heal any damage it may have taken with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Melmetal</strong>: Melmetal takes next to nothing from any of Dodrio's STAB attacks and can stomach a boosted Jump Kick thanks to its titanic physical bulk. It can then smack Dodrio in return with a powerful Double Iron Bash.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Sandslash and Nidoqueen can easily switch into Dodrio and threaten it with Toxic or Rock Slide, being able to tank a boosted Drill Peck thanks to their solid bulk. A healthy Rhydon can also check Dodrio, but must be wary of a boosted Jump Kick.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Alakazam, and Starmie are all capable of revenge killing Dodrio, with the former also being able to switch into it. They must be wary of a boosted Quick Attack if they have been weakened, though.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h1>Set Information</h1> <p>Swords Dance boosts Dodrio's Attack to frightening levels, enabling its sweep. Drill Peck is a strong STAB attack that allows Dodrio to break through many physically bulky Pokemon, like Mega Venusaur, Poliwrath, and Mega Charizard X. Quick Attack is a useful tool that prevents Dodrio from being revenge killed by the likes of Mega Beedrill and Mega Alakazam. Jump Kick provides great coverage with Dodrio's STAB attacks, hitting Pokemon like Melmetal, Rhydon, and Alolan Sandslash for massive damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Dodrio is a straightforward Pokemon. Finding setup opportunities for Dodrio can be difficult, but it can be done on Pokemon that cannot OHKO it like Alolan Exeggutor, Poliwrath, and Snorlax; it should be wary of Toxic, though. Dodrio also forces switches against the likes of Mega Venusaur and Victreebel, giving it chances to boost up with Swords Dance. Try to weaken Dodrio's most common checks in Melmetal, Mew, and Zapdos before setting it up, as Dodrio cannot break these Pokemon alone and will usually faint when trying to. If needed, Dodrio can be used early-game to weaken these Pokemon for teammates like Dragonite, giving them opportunities to sweep later on.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Ground-types that can help with Melmetal and Zapdos like Sandslash and Nidoqueen are excellent partners for Dodrio, as it cannot break these threats without support. These Pokemon can also land a Toxic on Mew, making it much more difficult for Mew to reliably check Dodrio. Nidoqueen in particular is a very helpful partner, weakening opposing Pokemon with Super Fang and putting them in range of Dodrio's attacks. Dragonite can be used alongside Dodrio, as they share many checks like Rhydon and Sandslash and can often break through them when paired together. Dodrio can be used on teams that feature dual screens support from Electrode. The added bulk allows Dodrio to set up on many more Pokemon, like Mega Gyarados, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Beedrill. Electrode can also prevent Stealth Rock from going up with Taunt, with its blistering Speed ensuring it outspeeds all Stealth Rock setters other than Mega Aerodactyl, which it Speed ties with. Mew is a great teammate that can switch into and deal with Pokemon that frustrate Dodrio, like Zapdos, and ensure they remain weakened with Taunt preventing their recovery moves. It can also check Melmetal, burning it with Will-O-Wisp or Scald or just weakening it with Flamethrower. Thunder Wave support is extremely useful for Dodrio, preventing revenge killing from the likes of Starmie and Mega Alakazam. Common users like Melmetal, Starmie, and Mega Gyarados all pair well with Dodrio for this reason.</p>"

  "Cloyster": {
    "overview": "<p>Cloyster's viability is solely carried by Shell Smash, which lets it outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and double its offensive stats in a single turn. To complement this, it has strong STAB options that cover each other well and a Defense stat that lets it set up in front of many physical attackers, notably tanking any hit from Melmetal after Stealth Rock, as well as from Dragonite and Mega Aerodactyl. It also has Self-Destruct, which lets it sacrifice itself to OHKO or heavily damage Pokemon that could otherwise take it on like Alolan Muk and Mega Gyarados. Unfortunately, Cloyster's poor offensive movepool utilizes its lower Special Attack stat and leaves it unable to meaningfully damage Water-type Pokemon without using Self-Destruct, which can make handling it quite easy. Its abysmal special bulk limits its setup opportunities, and it faces competition from Omastar, which is vulnerable to revenge killing from the metagame's fastest Pokemon due to its poor Speed but is much more powerful and can even support its team with Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Cloyster's limited movepool does not offer it many options. Running Hydro Pump and Surf on the same set can offer both power and reliability, but dropping Self-Destruct is not recommended. Ice Shard is also an option, capable of picking off weakened Pokemon that outspeed Cloyster like Mega Beedrill, boosted Dragonite, and Mega Aerodactyl, but its low Base Power makes it a poor option for sweeping compared to Cloyster's standard attacking moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Starmie, Poliwrath, Mega Gyarados, and the rare Mega Blastoise can deal with Cloyster well. Ice Beam and Hydro Pump will do very little to them, but boosted Self-Destruct will OHKO Starmie and do massive damage to the others, which cannot recover that lost health.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Alolan Muk, Mew, Melmetal, Chansey and Snorlax can stomach a Hydro Pump, though Mew and Melmetal must be healthy and don't appreciate losing that much health. Alolan Muk, Chansey, and Snorlax are bulky enough to take more than one boosted Hydro Pump but must be careful of Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: When priority move users like Alolan Dugtrio's Sucker Punch are present, Cloyster should avoid being put into their KO range, as they will end Cloyster's sweep swiftly without it getting the chance to do damage. Also beware of the rare Pikachu-S, as it can take Cloyster out with some prior damage using its STAB priority.</p>",

      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h1>Set Information</h1> <p>Shell Smash lets Cloyster outspeed fast Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Alakazam and boost its damage output to KO Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Zapdos. Hydro Pump somewhat mitigates Cloyster's low Special Attack, while Surf is a somewhat weaker option that lets Cloyster accurately finish off Pokemon that resist Ice Beam where Hydro Pump is not necessary; it also deals reliable damage to Pokemon when needed and allows Cloyster to be a more consistent wincon. Ice Beam offers a 100% accurate STAB attack that prevents Grass-types and Dragonite from walling Cloyster. Self-Destruct takes advantage of the Attack boost from Shell Smash to blow past special walls like Alolan Muk, Snorlax, and Chansey as well as Water-types like Mega Gyarados, Starmie, and Poliwrath.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Do not use Cloyster early on, as your opponent will be able to use their best or most convenient check and finish Cloyster off with minimal harm to their team. Cloyster performs much better later on, when its answers are limited and it can potentially use Self-Destruct on your opponent's counterplay and open the door for another Pokemon to win. When using Self-Destruct, be mindful of how much your opponent would be rewarded for predicting Self-Destruct and saving their check, as it might be worthwhile to predict this and simply use another attack. A key to using Cloyster is deciding whether it will be more effective to have Cloyster weaken walls such as Alolan Muk and Melmetal to support its fast, offensive teammates or to wallbreak with said teammates to enable a sweep with Cloyster. This is largely dependent on your matchup— if your opponent has multiple healthy checks to Cloyster, attempting to sweep with it is unadvised.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cloyster is a spectacular partner for Mega Alakazam, as all of Alakazam's defensive checks are commonly used to check a boosted Cloyster. Cloyster can put these Pokemon into KO range of Mega Alakazam's coverage with Hydro Pump, or outright remove them with Self-Destruct in the case of Snorlax and Alolan Muk. Cloyster can also capitalize on any wallbreaking that Mega Alakazam does to sweep later on. Starmie works well with Cloyster in a similar way, but it comes with more similar coverage and utility without taking a Mega slot. Pokemon that deal with the Water-types that stump Cloyster can be useful, and Zapdos matches up well against Mega Gyarados and Poliwrath. Nasty Plot Mew is also a great special attacker that can take advantage of Cloyster's ability to force damage on many of its best answers while also setting up freely on Poliwrath. Any Pokemon that appreciate the chunks of health Cloyster often rips out of Melmetal are options, most notably Mega Beedrill, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Gyarados. Mega Gyarados also pressures Water-types like Poliwrath.</p>"

It is also, without question, the swiftest support Pokemon around. Electrode's capabilities of setting up dual screens, using Taunt to stop Stealth Rock from going up, and crippling threats with Thunder Wave before the majority of the metagame can even move make it a valuable asset for offensive teams. However, outside of its great Speed, the rest of its stats are lackluster by LGPE OU standards. Electrode relies on Reflect and Light Screen to withstand multiple attacks throughout the match, as it's helplessly frail without them. As an Electric-type, it's offensively outclassed by Zapdos, which sports much greater attacking stats, Drill Peck to deal with Grass-types, and U-turn for keeping momentum.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Explosion, when running a Jolly nature, can be used instead of Foul Play or Thunderbolt to gain offensive momentum by allowing a teammate to come in safely after Electrode has served its purpose, and it can heavily chip Pokemon Electrode normally wouldn’t be able to hit very hard, such as Chansey, Nidoqueen, Mega Venusaur, and Sandslash. Toxic can put Pokemon such as Mew, Rhydon, Zapdos, and Chansey on a timer, but it's hard to justify using it on Electrode's moveset over its more consistent options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Rhydon, Nidoqueen, and Alolan Dugtrio are immune to Thunderbolt, should Electrode run it, and can OHKO in return with STAB Earthquake or 2HKO it with Reflect up. This forces Electrode to choose whether to use Taunt to prevent the usage of Stealth Rock or Reflect to survive the incoming attack. Alolan Dugtrio is 2HKOed by Foul Play, however.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Victreebel, Exeggutor, and Alolan Exeggutor easily take most of what Electrode can throw at them. However, Exeggutor is 2HKOed by Foul Play after Stealth Rock, and none of these Pokemon appreciate being paralyzed by Thunder Wave. Victreebel must also watch out for a potential Foul Play after a Swords Dance boost, which will use Victreebel's boosted Attack against it and dish out major damage.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls, including Chansey, Snorlax, and Alolan Muk, hardly take any damage from Electrode's attacks and can stall out Reflect and Light Screen turns in front of it. Snorlax in particular can hit Electrode very hard with Earthquake, and Chansey beats Electrode with Seismic Toss. Electrode that opt for Foul Play over Thunderbolt will also have a difficult time getting past Alolan Muk, which can retaliate with Crunch. Chansey must watch out for the rare Explosion, however, as Electrode can use Taunt to stop it from using Soft-Boiled and then Explosion to put it at a dangerously low amount of health.</p>",

Thunder Wave can cripple fast offensive Pokemon such as Mega Alakazam, Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Beedrill, and Starmie. Foul Play allows Electrode to damage Ground-type Pokemon, most notably being able to 2HKO Alolan Dugtrio. Alternatively, STAB Thunderbolt hits Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Gyarados, Starmie, and Mega Charizard Y super effectively while also damaging Melmetal more than Foul Play, but it leaves Electrode completely walled by Ground-types.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Electrode can be used as a lead to set up dual screens, use Taunt to prevent Stealth Rock and other status moves from being used, and cripple fast Pokemon with Thunder Wave if running it. It's an effective lead against opposing leads such as Aerodactyl, Mew, and Clefable, since it is faster than all of them unless Aerodactyl Mega Evolves, and Taunt can stop whatever status moves they plan to use. Prioritize setting up whichever of Reflect or Light Screen is appropriate for the foe in front of Electrode. Leading against Ground-types such as Rhydon, Nidoqueen, and Alolan Dugtrio can put Electrode in a tricky situation, so it's wise to lead with a different Pokemon that can handle them more easily. Saving Electrode for a later point in the match can be beneficial to get off a critical move before going down, such as a last-ditch Thunder Wave against Mega Beedrill to have a teammate revenge kill it the next turn or one of Reflect or Light Screen to help setup sweepers (spacing) withstand heavier hits.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Setup sweepers such as Mega Pinsir and Alolan Sandslash utilize the added defensive bulk from Electrode’s dual screens to safely set up with Swords Dance and also take advantage of Thunder Wave slowing down the opposing team to ensure a potential sweep. Nasty Plot and Bulk Up variants of Mew also appreciate dual screens support, becoming virtually unstoppable thanks to its already impressive bulk being augmented by this support. Frailer Pokemon such as Mega Beedrill, Mega Aerodactyl, Starmie, and Gengar highly appreciate Electrode's lightning-fast dual screens support letting them take hits that they normally wouldn't take very well. Even bulkier Pokemon such as Melmetal, Mew, Zapdos, and Nidoqueen appreciate dual screens, which let them become near-impenetrable defensive threats. Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon such as non-Mega Gyarados, Mega Charizard X and Y, and Dragonite appreciate Electrode's efforts to prevent Stealth Rock from going up with Taunt. If Thunder Wave is being used, slower wallbreakers such as Mega Gyarados and Melmetal greatly benefit from the speed control. Ground-types are the bane of Electrode's existence and are capable of setting Stealth Rock in front of Electrode if it prioritizes Reflect over Taunt or as it switches out. Taunt Mew makes for an excellent stopgap to Ground-type Stealth Rock setters, especially if it also runs Scald.</p>"

Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Moltres appreciate Exeggutor deterring the aforementioned Ground-types from setting Stealth Rock and providing them more opportunities to attack, threatening Exeggutor checks such as Melmetal and Mega Pinsir in return. Poliwrath is a notable partner, taking on checks to Exeggutor such as Chansey, Melmetal, and Snorlax; in turn, Exeggutor provides measures against checks such as Starmie, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Alakazam.</p>"

Hitmonlee's coverage in Rock Slide and Earthquake lets it threaten would-be answers like Zapdos and Nidoqueen, while Toxic allows it to lure in and cripple Mew, which would otherwise wall it. Unfortunately, Hitmonlee's physical bulk is extremely poor, leaving it entirely unable to switch in on many of the physical attackers it aims to pressure, such as Melmetal, Rhydon, and Mega Gyarados, as well as weaker Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Poliwrath. Due to its middling Speed, Hitmonlee also is vulnerable to a plethora of popular revenge killers, including Mega Beedrill, Alolan Dugtrio, and Starmie. It is also vitally outrun and threatened by prominent Pokemon in the base 100 Speed tier, namely Mew, Zapdos, and Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y, regardless of its nature, and it struggles to significantly threaten Mega Venusaur at all.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Poison Jab provides coverage for Clefable, but it comes at the expense of coverage for more relevant Pokemon. Facade can be used to exploit status, but its power is lacking, as it is unable to 2HKO Mew even when Hitmonlee is statused. Substitute can potentially protect Hitmonlee from revenge killing attempts after it claims a KO, but it can be difficult to set up and maintain.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mew and Starmie</strong>: Mew and Starmie can switch in and heal off any damage Hitmonlee does to them while also threatening it with status or Psychic. However, both must be wary of Toxic, which will limit their effectiveness.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos isn't hurt too badly by High Jump Kick and can threaten Hitmonlee in return with Thunderbolt or Drill Peck, but it dislikes being afflicted with Toxic, can be threatened by Bulk Up variants as it switches in, and has to be careful when using Roost due to High Jump Kick and Earthquake dealing massive damage.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Mega Venusaur can comfortably tank any attack from Hitmonlee and fire its own back.

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Hitmonlee's High Jump Kick is a spammable STAB move thanks to the rarity of Protect and Ghost-types. Rock Slide's coverage complements High Jump Kick, allowing Hitmonlee to threaten Flying-types such as Zapdos. Earthquake provides coverage for Poison-types like Nidoqueen and Gengar, is Hitmonlee's strongest attack versus Mega Venusaur, and acts as a more reliable option for picking off weakened targets due to its perfect accuracy. Toxic lets Hitmonlee lure in and cripple Mew, saving it from being complete fodder. Alternatively, Bulk Up allows Hitmonlee to more easily break targets like Starmie lacking Psychic and Zapdos lacking Drill Peck, as well as augmenting its lacking Defense to potentially survive revenge killing attempts from the likes of Alolan Dugtrio, Mega Aerodactyl lacking Wing Attack, and Mega Beedrill, but dropping Toxic means Hitmonlee will require support to deal with Mew. An Adamant nature is preferred due to the rarity of relevant Pokemon, most notably Jolly Mega Gyarados, that a Jolly nature would let Hitmonlee outrun.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hitmonlee should be brought in as often as possible throughout a game in order to maximize the amount of damage it can deal to the opposing team. This can be done with good predictions or support in the form of U-turn or Teleport. If it is safe to do so, going for Toxic early in a battle in order to status troublesome Pokemon like Mew and Zapdos as they switch in can give you a great advantage. Spamming High Jump Kick is a viable option, as it greatly wears down any switch-ins alongside Stealth Rock. As a result, coverage can be reserved for when it is absolutely necessary or for hard predictions.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As a wallbreaker, Hitmonlee greatly appreciates Stealth Rock support in order to help wear down would-be answers. Nidoqueen, Rhydon, and Alolan Dugtrio can all provide this support while also acting as great responses to Zapdos. Melmetal and the aforementioned Rhydon are very useful teammates, being able to switch in on physical attacks aimed at Hitmonlee from the likes of Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Beedrill. Both also act as very effective wallbreakers, forming a powerful offensive core with Hitmonlee that can help soften the opposing team. Late-game sweepers like Dragonite, Mega Alakazam, and Alolan Sandslash greatly benefit from Hitmonlee's ability to wear down the opponent's defensive core in advance. Alolan Muk exploits Mew, Hitmonlee's most common answer, as well as helping to take on other Psychic-types like Mega Alakazam and Starmie. Mega Gyarados can also fill a similar role, trading a better typing for greater firepower and its own Water resistance. Pivots utilizing U-turn make for great teammates, allowing Hitmonlee to switch in safely on Pokemon it can threaten. Mew, Zapdos, and Mega Beedrill are the best examples, with all three often drawing in Pokemon vulnerable to High Jump Kick, such as Mega Gyarados, Rhydon, and Melmetal.</p>"

Thanks to its bulk and access to Soft-Boiled to keep itself healthy, it is able to take on special attackers lacking physical moves such as Mega Alakazam, Starmie, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y. Chansey also is an effective status inducer with either Toxic or Thunder Wave due to how effective it is at forcing switches and access to utility moves like Teleport, can be very useful to gain momentum for the team and bring its teammates in safely against any of it's checks. However, a terrible Defense stat makes Chansey unable to take any physical attacks well; Pokemon like Mega Beedrill, Melmetal, Mega Gyarados, and Snorlax can OHKO it with their attacks. Chansey also struggles with potential mixed attackers like Mega Charizard Y and Mega Venusaur for the same reason, being 2HKOed by their Earthquake. It even struggles against weak physical attacks from Zapdos and Mew, two Pokemon it is supposed to check, being heavily dented by their U-turn, and gets shut down by Calm Mind Mew, as Taunt turns it into setup fodder.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock can be used if the team needs a Stealth Rock setter; however, this makes Chansey more passive, as it becomes unable to either spread status around to impair threats such as Rhydon, Poliwrath, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Aerodactyl or to gain momentum for the team with Teleport. Shadow Ball can be used to enable Chansey to break Gengar's Substitute and take care of it; however, it does not do much else. Reflect is an alternative to Teleport that lets Chansey take weaker physical attacks better and support its team in taking hits from physical attackers, most notably Melmetal, but it is often inferior to simply bringing in an answer to a physical threat via Teleport. Sing can let Chansey put a switch-in out of commission, but it is often too unreliable to be worth risking.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Physical attackers such as Melmetal, Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Gyarados can OHKO Chansey with their STAB attacks due to Chansey's minuscule Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Calm Mind Mew gives Chansey trouble due to Taunt shutting down its utility moves.

It also allows Chansey to directly combat special attackers utilizing recovery, such as Mega Alakazam and Nasty Plot Mew. Thunder Wave can be used to slow down fast Pokemon like Gengar, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Beedrill as well as hinder Pokemon that are immune to Toxic like Melmetal and Alolan Muk, making it easier for Chansey's teammates to take care of them. Teleport allows Chansey to safely pivot away from special attackers it can sponge hits from, keeping up momentum in the face of potential physically offensive switch-ins that Chansey can't handle. A Calm nature is used in order for Chansey to be as specially bulky as possible to soak up attacks from Pokemon like Mega Alakazam, Starmie, and Mega Charizard Y on the switch for its teammates.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Chansey can be used early- or mid-game to force its threats to come out and use Teleport to gain momentum on them or spread Toxic or Thunder Wave. Switch Chansey into special attackers like Zapdos, Mega Alakazam, and Starmie or bring it in on a predicted switch. Use Teleport on a predicted switch to a Pokemon that can threaten Chansey, like Melmetal, Mega Gyarados, or Mega Beedrill, so a teammate can come in and take care of it. Use Toxic or Thunder Wave on predicted switches, the former to put a timer on Pokemon such as Zapdos, Poliwrath, and Rhydon, and the latter to slow down offensive switch-ins like Mega Gyarados and Gengar. Chansey can also use Seismic Toss in order to chip down Pokemon that commonly can switch into it such as Melmetal, Zapdos, and Alolan Sandslash. Be careful around potential mixed attackers such as Mega Charizard Y, Zapdos, and Mega Venusaur, as Chansey gets 2HKOed by a physical attack from these. Do not leave Chansey in on Mew if it has Taunt, as Chansey will get chipped down and be unable to heal itself. Chansey should also be wary of a potential U-turn from Mew, as it can heavily dent it. Do not let Chansey get hit by Toxic, as this will impair its ability to take special attacks and wear it down a lot faster.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Many Pokemon appreciate Chansey soaking up all special attacks for them and providing them a safe switch-in with Teleport. Chansey appreciates Zapdos and Mega Venusaur being able to come in and tank a variety of physical attacks, including Fighting-type attacks from Poliwrath. Both of them can also help take care of Mega Gyarados, a major threat to Chansey. Mew is great to pair with Chansey because it can handicap powerful physical attackers like Melmetal, Mega Gyarados, and Dragonite with Will-O-Wisp. Rhydon acts as a great answer to Zapdos, checks many physical attackers including Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Beedrill, and has a potent offensive presence to help offset the passivity of the more defensive teams Chansey often appears on. Melmetal appreciates Chansey walling special attacks from Zapdos, Gengar, and Starmie that it does not take well and getting it in safely with Teleport to threaten physical attackers. On more offensive teams, Mega Beedrill can benefit from Chansey safely pivoting it into Mew to fire off attacks. If Chansey is running Thunder Wave, teammates that can spread Toxic are useful; Poliwrath is proficient at this, as it threatens most Pokemon immune to the move, and it also helps take on threats to Chansey such as Melmetal and Rhydon.</p>"

Combine this with access to status-spreading moves that cannot be blocked by Taunt such as Sizzly Slide, Sappy Seed, and Buzzy Buzz, and you have an excellent support Pokemon. However, Eevee-S's unremarkable typing, low offensive power, poor defensive stats, and lack of immediate recovery mean it doesn't last long on the battlefield. Eevee-S's low survivability further means that its valuable cleric powers can only be used so many times per match.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Baddy Bad is an interesting alternative to Sizzly Slide that can also be used in conjunction with it to avoid a 2HKO from Melmetal that lack Superpower. However, Eevee-S has a hard time fitting it in its moveset.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Venusaur and Mega Venusaur</strong>: Despite Eevee-S's access to Sizzly Slide, Venusaur's immunity to Sappy Seed is very problematic for Eevee-S, especially since Venusaur can use Sleep Powder to ruin its cleric abilities. Even worse, it can outspeed Eevee-S and cripple it with Sleep Powder if using a Timid nature.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew benefits from getting burned, since this protects it from Toxic, and Roost means a burn won't reduce its survivability by much. Meanwhile, Psychic does plenty of damage to Eevee-S. Mew is also capable of setting up on Eevee-S with Nasty Plot.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos benefits from getting burned almost as much as Mew for the similar reason of shielding it from Toxic, while Thunderbolt will always 2HKO Eevee-S. Zapdos is also a common user of Substitute, which takes advantage of predicted Sappy Seeds.</p> <p><strong>Mega Charizard X</strong>: Not only does Mega Charizard X not care about burns, it also has Roost to shrug off Sappy Seed and has plenty of power to KO Eevee-S. It must watch out for Buzzy Buzz, however.</p> <p><strong>Facade users</strong>: Pokemon such as Snorlax, Melmetal, and Alolan Muk can get themselves intentionally burned, giving them an easy way to KO Eevee-S with boosted Facade.</p> <p><strong>Eevee-S</strong>: Opposing Eevee-S dramatically reduce your own Eevee-S's ability to effectively spread status due to their own usage of Sparkly Swirl.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Due to Eevee-S's mediocre Speed stat, it's fairly easy to revenge kill. Special attackers are especially problematic, since they don't particularly care about getting burned by Sizzly Slide.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Getting Substitute up against Eevee-S can be devastating due to its low damage output and habit of using resisted moves to inflict status.

        "description": "<h1>Set Information</h1> <p>Sparkly Swirl is Eevee-S's status-relieving attack. Sappy Seed potentially lets Eevee-S restore some of its own or its teammates' health while also aiding Eevee-S in some matchups, such as against Snorlax, Zapdos, and Mew. Sappy Seed is also notable for doing good damage to Rhydon, Mega Gyarados, and Poliwrath. Sizzly Slide allows Eevee-S to spread burns and punish physical attackers that would otherwise switch in such as Melmetal, Dragonite, and Alolan Muk. Protect pairs well with Sappy Seed, letting Eevee-S stall while restoring additional health. Buzzy Buzz may conflict with spreading burns, but its ability to spread paralysis is very useful against common specially offensive switch-ins such as Mega Alakazam and Starmie. Glitzy Glow is also notable for being the only way to buffer Eevee-S against special attacks while being a decent support option in general.</p> <p>A Jolly nature allows Eevee-S to outspeed some slower Pokemon that often use neutral Speed natures, such as Dragonite and Venusaur. While lowering Eevee-S's Special Attack may seem strange, its special attacks aren't used for damage output, so higher general bulk is far more preferable. A Careful nature is also a reasonable option for better Special Defense, potentially allowing Eevee-S to avoid a 2HKO from Zapdos or Mew after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When Eevee-S is safely in and your team is status free (usually early-game), its main job is to spread status. Eevee-S is most safe to do this against slower foes such as Alolan Muk. Note, though, that even burned foes like Melmetal can still inflict significant damage against Eevee-S. When up against slower physical attackers, Eevee-S should usually burn them first with Sizzly Slide and then use Sappy Seed. However, against Pokemon that benefit from being burned, such as Mew and Zapdos, use Sappy Seed if Eevee-S must stay in. Also note that some Pokemon such as Melmetal and Snorlax may use Facade to take advantage of burns.</p> <p>Eevee-S's main purpose may be to lift status from your team, but don't be reckless with it. Eevee-S doesn't last very long, so use Sparkly Swirl either when Eevee-S isn't in much danger or if lifting status from certain teammates is more important than Eevee-S's safety. Additionally, be wary of Substitute use if you're forced to keep Eevee-S in on unfavorable matchups. If facing common Substitute users such as Mega Gyarados and Gengar, consider using a move that may break their Substitute instead of inflicting favorable status.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Eevee-S's cleric powers make using Rest a viable option for teammates, so pairing bulky Pokemon that lack recovery with Eevee-S is a great idea. Melmetal, Alolan Muk, and Snorlax are particularly good options for this, but Poliwrath is also notable for helping against Mega Gyarados. Dragonite is an especially good partner for Eevee-S; not only does it resist the occasional Fighting-type attack aimed at Eevee-S, but Eevee-S's Sparkly Swirl support also makes Dragonite far less scared of status, meaning it can be more effectively used as a tank when it's unable to sweep.</p> <p>U-turn users are a helpful way to get Eevee-S in safely. Zapdos is an excellent example and benefits from Toxic removal due to its use of Roost. Mew also does a good job of getting Eevee-S in with U-turn, and as a bonus, it often lures Alolan Muk in for Eevee-S to take advantage of. Mega Beedrill is a more offensive alternative that can potentially put its checks like Melmetal in a position to get burned.</p>"

As Electrode and Mega Alakazam are the only two Pokemon that can even Speed tie with it, Mega Aerodactyl can often sweep a softened team without taking any hits. However, its typing makes it vulnerable to Stealth Rock and priority moves like Aqua Jet and Ice Shard. Due to its mediocre bulk, it can also struggle with breaking past bulkier Pokemon like Melmetal and Mega Gyarados, as it generally will not survive a super effective STAB attack after Stealth Rock damage. Because its STAB attacks have relatively low Base Power, Mega Aerodactyl generally struggles to sweep before chip damage has been spread across the opposing team. Mega Aerodactyl generally does its best work in a late-game cleanup, when its threats are properly softened.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Replacing Wing Attack or Crunch with Roost will give Mega Aerodactyl some longevity and offset repeated switches into Stealth Rock, but it sacrifices the ability to deal with common late-game threats like Mega Alakazam, Poliwrath, Mega Venusaur, Mew, and Starmie. Taunt can allow Mega Aerodactyl to temporarily stop Stealth Rock and other status moves, but Mega Aerodactyl risks being hit hard if your opponent did not select one of those moves. Wing Attack could be replaced with Fly in order to deal more damage in a single hit, but Wing Attack has a higher overall damage output and can't be exploited as easily.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Melmetal</strong>: Melmetal's tremendous HP, excellent Defense, and good defensive typing allow it to shrug off all of Mega Aerodactyl's STAB attacks and only leave it slightly vulnerable to Earthquake.

Threats like Dragonite only require a small amount of chip damage before Rock Slide will reliably OHKO them. Earthquake gives Mega Aerodactyl a method of responding to threats like Rhydon and Melmetal, doing over 50% to the former and over 33% to the latter. Crunch allows Mega Aerodactyl to have a favorable matchup with Mega Alakazam (which either needs to win a Speed tie and land a critical hit, or survive a near-guaranteed OHKO and win a Speed tie on the next turn) and Starmie. Wing Attack allows Aerodactyl to threaten foes that otherwise give it trouble due to their bulk or typing, such as Mega Venusaur and Poliwrath. Roost is an option that allows Mega Aerodactyl to restore its HP if necessary and tank moves that would normally hit it super effectively. The preferred nature is Jolly, as it improves Aerodactyl's odds versus standard Mega Alakazam, Mega Beedrill, and Electrode while also allowing it to outspeed the rare Modest Mega Alakazam. However, Adamant allows Mega Aerodactyl to secure many KOs more easily while only opening it up to being consistently outsped by the aforementioned Pokemon and opposing Mega Aerodactyl—of which, only opposing Mega Aerodactyl can OHKO it after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Pokemon that check Mega Aerodactyl will usually be extremely heavy hitters, so it can be difficult to bring a teammate in on their attacks and expect it to do anything other than get KOed on the next turn. This means that this set is generally reserved for late-game unless your opponent has failed to set up Stealth Rock or doesn't have any Pokemon with super effective priority moves or an equal Speed tier. Mega Aerodactyl can also act as an effective revenge killer due to its perfect neutral coverage and amazing Speed, so don't be afraid to use it earlier on if a situation calls for it. Mega Aerodactyl's mediocre bulk and focus on speedy physical attacks mean that burn and paralysis will largely render it useless. Thus, it’s generally not safe to bring it in on or leave it in against a foe that threatens these status ailments and isn't in its KO range. Finally, this set requires a fair amount of chip damage on bulky foes like Rhydon, Melmetal, Clefable, and Mega Gyarados. Keep this in mind when selecting teammates, as often, a teammate merely needs to get a single attack off on one of these threats to bring it into KO range of Mega Aerodactyl's coverage moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because of the limited number of Pokemon that can survive an attack from Mega Aerodactyl after a small amount of chip damage and Stealth Rock, it has a very diverse range of potential teammates. Starmie, Poliwrath, and Zapdos are excellent options, as they can easily answer and chip down Mega Aerodactyl's main threats. Pokemon with strong Fire-type attacks are always appreciated by Mega Aerodactyl, as they can chip Melmetal into Earthquake's KO range. Mega Aerodactyl truly appreciates Stealth Rock support because many  foes that would otherwise check Aerodactyl, like the common Zapdos, will be taken out by a single Rock Slide after Stealth Rock damage. Nidoqueen is especially effective, as it can set up Stealth Rock against Zapdos and spread consistent chip damage with Super Fang. Dragonite's standard Agility set can support Mega Aerodactyl extremely effectively as well, as they both can lure in and damage Melmetal to help out the other.</p>"

Finding an opportunity to switch in Aerodactyl for free and using Taunt to block a predicted status move will usually provide the opportunity to set Stealth Rock while maintaining Aerodactyl's health.

In addition, Mega Gyarados plugs the weak spots Aerodactyl has to Starmie and Rhydon. As Gyarados and Aerodactyl share an Electric weakness, it's usually beneficial to have a Ground-type, such as Nidoqueen. The chosen Ground-type also appreciates Aerodactyl providing Stealth Rock, as it gives it room to increase its coverage.

Mew also has some of the best mixed bulk in the entire game, enough to avoid a reliable OHKO from any unboosted attack, while also being backed up by reliable recovery. As a result, it can effectively wall or at worst check a majority of the metagame with the right set. Its offenses are average by the metagame's standards but are enough to let it deal respectable damage both physically and specially. The Psychic typing is great, exploiting the low number of Pokemon that resist it greatly while also not having too many noteworthy weaknesses. Mew's movepool is possibly its most notorious feature, however; with amazing coverage options both physically and specially, great utility, and setup options that bolster its decent offenses as well as the aforementioned recovery Roost provides, Mew is extremely versatile and can run more viable sets than any other Pokemon by a large margin, excelling in most of the roles it assumes. Despite its numerous oppressive qualities, Mew does have significant weaknesses that keep it from being overwhelming. Most Mew sets are extremely vulnerable to being worn down by Toxic, and some faster Mega Evolutions such as Mega Beedrill and Mega Pinsir can dispatch of most sets easily after minimal prior damage.

Mew sets using Will-O-Wisp can instead use Toxic or Thunder Wave depending on what suits your team best, but burn is generally the most useful status for Mew in order to wall specific physical threats. A Calm Mind set with multiple attacks can be run similarly to the standard Nasty Plot set; however, the greater boost provided in fewer turns by Nasty Plot is generally more desirable for such sets. Mew has two possible dual setup variants in Calm Mind + Barrier and Bulk Up + Amnesia paired with Rest and a single attacking move, but these are prone to being knocked out by critical hits while trying to set up and generally take too long to become effective in a battle. Self-Destruct can be used as a way to lure special walls, opening up opportunities for special sweepers, but this can be risky to pull off and sacrifices Mew entirely. Dual screens provides valuable team support and can even be paired with Transform; when the correct screen is up, Transform will allow Mew to take on foes one-on-one that may otherwise give it trouble. However, a set without Transform severely lacks utility outside of setting screens, a feat Electrode often pulls off better. Furthermore, while interesting, Transform sets can often be redundant; Mew can beat many Pokemon one-on-one anyway and is often better than whatever it could Transform into.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Alolan Muk</strong>: Alolan Muk is immune to Psychic and does a good job of dealing with Nasty Plot sets especially—while defensive pivot Mew can burn Muk, it might be afflicted with Toxic in return.</p> <p><strong>Mega Beedrill</strong>: Mega Beedrill can reliably dispatch of Mew after some chip damage, hitting it very hard with U-turn or X-Scissor. It must be wary of Psychic or a burn, though.</p> <p><strong>Mega Pinsir</strong>: Mega Pinsir outspeeds Mew and threatens it with an X-Scissor while also providing the double threat of setting up a Swords Dance on a switch.</p> <p><strong>Mega Charizard X</strong>: Mega Charizard X absorbs Will-O-Wisp, and if running Toxic, it can wear down defensive Mew effectively.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax and Chansey</strong>: Snorlax and Chansey do a good job of sponging attacks from standard Mew sets, with Chansey statusing them in return and Snorlax threatening an extremely powerful Facade if burned.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Other Pokemon that may let Mew switch in safely, such as Poliwrath, often run Toxic to severely lower its longevity.</p>",

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h1>Set Information</h1> <p>Psychic is this set's best mono-attacking option thanks to its significant damage output versus the majority of the metagame. Will-O-Wisp is great for allowing Mew to easily deal with most physical attacks, while Flamethrower gives Mew a good way to immediately threaten Melmetal for teams especially vulnerable to it. Roost is key to the set's survivability, allowing Mew to be used liberally throughout the match and wall out many threatening Pokemon. U-turn allows Mew to gain momentum, either to escape an unfavorable matchup or to give the user better offensive pressure versus the opposing Pokemon. Taunt allows Mew to protect itself from common counterplay in Toxic at the cost of U-turn's momentum. A Timid nature allows Mew to act first and therefore safely heal, pivot or use Will-O-Wisp in more matchups, while Bold sacrifices a few of those matchups for a better defensive presence that allows it to more safely deal with threats such as Melmetal.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mew should generally be brought in versus Pokemon that either are unable to deal significant damage to it or are weak to Psychic. Once it's in, you can use Psychic to put on immediate pressure, burn the opponent if they are a physical attacker that may be problematic for your team, heal Mew if it is safe and necessary to do so, or use U-turn if you expect a switch to something that can deal with Mew. Mew can be used for checking many offensive threats that can't hit it with a super effective STAB attack in a pinch, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Dragonite, Rhydon and Starmie. It can also be used to threaten a burn on Melmetal, but it will take a lot of damage in the process. Always make sure to keep Mew healthy enough to deal with key threats that the rest of your team might struggle with. Trying to avoid getting statused helps greatly with this.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>While this set fits on almost any team composition and as a result works well with most things, there are a few Pokemon that synergize especially well with Mew. Zapdos appreciates Mew's ability to check and threaten Alolan Dugtrio, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Rhydon and completes an effective U-turn core. Melmetal benefits from Mew's ability to take Fighting-, Fire-, and Ground-type attacks and the safe switches U-turn provides while itself providing a useful Toxic immunity. Alolan Muk provides a great response to Mega Alakazam, which otherwise gives Mew a lot of trouble, and also provides a Toxic immunity.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h1>Set Information</h1> <p>Psychic and Thunderbolt are usually the best options for this set's attacks, providing strong unresisted coverage among common Pokemon other than the frail Alolan Dugtrio. Fire Blast gives Mew a better matchup versus Alolan Dugtrio, Melmetal, and Alolan Sandslash as well as providing unresisted coverage for niche options like Exeggutor and Magneton, but it comes at the expense of either coverage for Mega Gyarados and Starmie or longevity in Roost. Nasty Plot allows Mew to quickly boost its damage output to very threatening levels. Roost makes setting up versus weaker attackers a safe option. A Timid nature is heavily recommended, giving Mew better odds of victory versus Pokemon with base 100 Speed. Modest's damage increase doesn't change many matchups enough to be worthwhile.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mew should ideally be kept healthy until opposing special tanks are weakened and potential revenge killers are either knocked out or paralyzed; it can win quite easily in such a scenario. Bring Mew in versus a Pokemon that it can force out, such as Venusaur or Poliwrath. You can also bluff a Will-O-Wisp in order to get more setup opportunities. Use this first turn to set up. If your Mew is still healthy and is pressured to either switch or be knocked out, don't be afraid to preserve it; Mew's bulk means it can set up multiple times in some games. This set isn't as negatively affected by Toxic as other Mew sets, as Pokemon that rely on Toxic to damage Mew may give it multiple setup opportunities and as a result the potential to knock out several Pokemon before fainting.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Nidoqueen is an especially effective partner for Nasty Plot Mew, as Stealth Rock damage paired with Super Fang puts many bulky Pokemon in range of boosted attacks. It also checks Alolan Muk and Chansey quite effectively. Electrode provides extremely useful support by threatening paralysis on Pokemon that outspeed Mew and bolstering Mew's bulk to ridiculous levels with dual screens. Thunder Wave Melmetal provides further paralysis support while also checking Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Beedrill, two Pokemon that can revenge kill Nasty Plot Mew. Mega Aerodactyl provides an offensive check to Mega Beedrill while also appreciating Mew's ability to break holes in the opponent's team earlier in the game itself.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h1>Set Information</h1> <p>Scald is the best attack for this set, having high PP, no immunities, and the chance to burn physical threats that may otherwise give it trouble. Calm Mind bolsters Mew's offensive and defensive presence, allowing it to deal better with strong special attackers such as Gengar and Mega Alakazam that may otherwise give it trouble. Taunt prevents Mew from being disrupted by status such as Toxic poison and paralysis from slower foes, both of which can ruin this set's effectiveness, while Roost provides vital longevity. A Timid nature is recommended, allowing Mew to outspeed and Taunt as many Pokemon as possible in order to avoid having its sweep ended by Toxic.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If your opponent has an Alolan Muk, attempting to get a Scald burn on it early in the game is advised. Be careful to not let it land a Toxic on Mew unless you have Eevee-S for support, as this will completely shut it down for the rest of the match. If you expect a slower opponent to try and inflict a harmful status on Mew or use their own setup, use Taunt to prevent it. Due to Mew's bulk, this is entirely safe against many Pokemon. When in a position where Mew can't be immediately 2HKOed or statused, you can start to set up Calm Mind. Use Roost when necessary. Once you've set up enough, start attacking. If the opponent has a defensive pivot Mew or a standard Mega Charizard X, try to bait them into burning your Mew—being burned is good for any Mew set, as it prevents Toxic, but especially for this one.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Nidoqueen and Nidoking make great partners for this Mew set thanks to their Toxic immunity and positive matchup versus Alolan Muk. Eevee-S provides much appreciated cleric support to enable more reckless play. Mega Aerodactyl's ability to offensively check Mega Beedrill  is appreciated by this set as much as any other.</p>"
      },
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h1>Set Information</h1> <p>Scald is the most common mono-attacking option for Stealth Rock Mew, compressing damage and the potential to burn into a single slot. Stealth Rock is provides invaluable support for this set's teammates. U-turn allows this set to act as a pivot, which helps combat its relative passivity, while Taunt shuts down other Stealth Rock leads such as Nidoqueen as well as miscellaneous Toxic users. Roost keeps Mew healthy throughout the match, allowing it to check threats such as Mega Aerodactyl despite its set being focused on setting Stealth Rock. A Timid nature allows Mew to set up Stealth Rock before being attacked by as many Pokemon as possible, making it optimal for this set.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is usually most effective as a lead; nothing can reliably OHKO Mew, and it has a solid Speed tier, so it almost always gets to set up Stealth Rock. Your priority should usually be setting up Stealth Rock. However, if an opportunity to gain a significant advantage appears, such as being able to OHKO Rhydon, you should consider taking it first. Try not to entirely sacrifice Mew if possible, as there's a good chance it could be useful later in the game as a defensive measure. If you expect the opponent to switch a physical attacker such as Alolan Muk, Mega Gyarados, or Melmetal in on Mew, you can try to burn it with Scald.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pairing another Pokemon that is often used to set up Stealth Rock with this Mew helps to make the set less obvious, decreasing the chance of the opponent expecting a Mew lead and responding accordingly. Alolan Dugtrio, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen are especially good options thanks to their decent Speed and positive matchups versus Alolan Muk. Fast offensive Mega Evolutions that come in often throughout a game, most notably Mega Beedrill, are especially good partners for a reliable Stealth Rock setter, as they enjoy having their answers being further worn down. Mega Beedrill's ability to help respond to opposing Gengar is notable, as experienced players may be aware that Gengar can switch in on Mew's Scald and force a bad situation.</p>"
