  "Blastoise": {
    "overview": "<p>With Shell Smash in its arsenal, Blastoise is capable of sweeping weakened teams and is a staple on offensive playstyles. It has enough natural bulk to secure setup opportunities on passive Pokemon like Sylveon and Vaporeon, and its Speed is crucially high enough to prevent Choice Scarf users like Passimian and Rotom-C from revenge killing it after setting up. Its defensive counterplay is limited, as Toxic users like Bronzong and Vaporeon are unable to deter Substitute variants, and tanks like Stealth Rock Copperajah and Dragalge are only able to KO it with chip damage; they may even inadvertently buff Blastoise by weakening it into Torrent range. Nonetheless, Blastoise is likely to sustain noteworthy damage when setting up, which in turn makes it easier for the aforementioned walls and priority users like Decidueye and Sirfetch'd to deal with it. Some bulky Pokemon like Assault Vest Copperajah, Haze Mantine, and specially defensive Dhelmise check Blastoise even without prior chip damage. Blastoise will also struggle to set up against offensive teams that pressure it with faster wallbreakers and sweepers as well as against teams with ample entry hazard and Knock Off support to make Blastoise much more vulnerable to revenge killers like Goodra and Choice Scarf Heliolisk.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Blastoise may opt for a defensive utility set that offers Rapid Spin, Flip Turn, and status support, although this set is less effective than other defensive Water-types like Mantine and Vaporeon. Life Orb has the niche of picking up more OHKOs at +2, like against Dragalge and Silvally-Ghost, but these KOs are also obtainable with entry hazard damage. This makes Life Orb usually not worth the recoil combined with the lack of White Herb. Aura Sphere hits notable targets like Heliolisk and Assault Vest Copperajah, but outside of the improved matchup for these threats, Blastoise has better options for sweeping.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Despite being passive, Mantine and Vaporeon use Haze and recovery to outlast Blastoise and prevent it from sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: A handful of special tanks and Assault Vest users like Copperajah, Dhelmise, and Goodra are capable of surviving a hit and OHKOing Blastoise. Other walls such as Escavalier and Guzzlord can stomach a boosted hit as well, but with usually only weaker attacks and Toxic to threaten Blastoise, they are more situational checks.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Heliolisk is one of the only Choice Scarf users capable of revenge killing Blastoise and can even tank a boosted hit if Thunderbolt fails to OHKO. Priority users like Sirfetch'd and Decidueye dispatch Blastoise when its in Torrent range, and offensive Water-types like Starmie check non-Dark Pulse variants.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Entry hazards and Knock Off wear down Blastoise and make it much more susceptible to being KOed, thus expanding its revenge killers and limiting its setup chances.</p> ",

Knock Off support from Passimian and Guzzlord is another great way to wear down Blastoise's defensive checks such as Mantine and Copperajah.

Additionally, it fails in the face of common physical attackers like Tyrantrum, Golurk, and Diancie.

Moreover, Vaporeon has great utility options in Wish, Heal Bell, and Toxic to support its partners, and it is able to scout attacks with Protect. Unfortunately, Vaporeon faces lots of competition from Sylveon; despite Vaporeon's ability to pivot with Flip Turn, Sylveon is an overall superior defensive Pokemon that can also pass Wishes and defensively answer offensive Water-types like Starmie and Inteleon. Also, Vaporeon's passivity leaves it easily exploited by threats like Rotom-C, Vileplume, and Decidueye. Furthermore, even with a lot of investment in its bulk, Vaporeon's Defense is still lacking, which leaves it vulnerable to strong physical wallbreakers.</p> ",

A more specially defensive EV spread lets Vaporeon better fend off Pokemon such as Starmie and Blastoise.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Both Decidueye and Dhelmise threaten Vaporeon with their STAB options, but they have to be careful about switching into Vaporeon and getting burned by Scald.

Additionally, with Teleport, Xatu can guarantee safe entry for both potent wallbreakers and setup sweepers, which has made it the staple dual screens setter on hyper offense teams and sets it apart from other dual screens setters like Espeon. Where Xatu comes short, though, is in its passivity. Despite Teleport helping it keep up momentum, its low offensive prowess still causes it to cede turns to potent wallbreakers like Starmie, Tyrantrum, and Guzzlord. Additionally, its poor defensive stats make it less effective at directly switching into coverage attacks from the likes of Sirfetch'd and Machamp and force it to use Roost very frequently to stay healthy.

    "overview": "<p>Absol is an effective wallbreaker because it's incredibly strong and has great coverage; very little can safely switch into it. Furthermore, unlike other wallbreakers with a somewhat average Speed tier, Absol's access to Sucker Punch gives it extra security against frail revenge killers like Salazzle, Heliolisk, and Starmie. Defensively, though, Absol offers very little despite its typing being passable; it just lacks the bulk to make use of its resistances to Ghost and Dark as much as its main competition in Guzzlord, which is much bulkier and has an even better defensive typing. As a result, Absol also struggles getting into battle without aggressive play and pivot support, limiting the amount of chances it has to wallbreak. Absol also can have a rough time dealing with foes like Diancie, Sylveon, and Mudsdale if it lacks the proper coverage move or chance to set up.</p> ",

Choice Band sets cannot switch between moves but have great raw power and lack the constant chip damage of Life Orb.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Toxicroak is one of the better offensive checks to Absol because it resists Dark and Fighting and easily dispatches Absol with Drain Punch. Other Fighting-types like Sirfetch'd, Machamp, and Passimian can deal with Absol too, with the former also having First Impression to avoid sustaining major damage from Absol, but they're much more vulnerable to Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Mudsdale has the raw bulk to take multiple attacks from Absol and beat it one-on-one with Earthquake. Vileplume is a shakier answer, needing to be at full health to contend with Absol, but can take two Knock Offs and recover health back with Strength Sap. Arcanine detests losing its Heavy-Duty Boots, but its bulk combined with Intimidate lets it easily wall Absol.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Sylveon and Diancie are both good Knock Off switch-ins that threaten to KO Absol with their STAB attacks.

Do note, though, that because of how fragile Absol is, Iron Tail's miss chance is even more punishing and it's very hard to find good setup opportunities with Swords Dance.

Mudsdale also lacks passivity issues thanks to its high Attack and strong moves in STAB Earthquake and Body Press, the latter of which can take advantage of Stamina boosts. Mudsdale is otherwise far too easily to overwhelm with common special attackers like Starmie, Blastoise, and Nasty Plot Salazzle.

  "Glastrier": {
    "overview": "<p>Glastrier's immense Attack stat, backed up by a good STAB move and extremely useful coverage options, makes it capable of breaking through most foes. Its bulk is nothing to sneeze at either, and it can create extremely tanky Substitutes to protect itself from status and weaker hits from the likes of Vileplume and Vaporeon. Glastrier's two main problems are its poor defensive typing and very low Speed; these leave it vulnerable to the powerful STAB moves and coverage attacks of most other wallbreakers such as Sirfetch'd and Exploud, so its defensive utility is less than it appears on paper. Glastrier is also unable to make progress against certain answers such as Diamond Storm Diancie, Quagsire, and Arcanine without a lot of support. Worse yet, other stallbreakers like Salazzle and Growth Vileplume boast superior typings and Speed, so it is hard to justify Glastrier on teams given it offers little in comparison.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Iron Defense + Body Press is another way to sweep and is better versus Mudsdale and Copperajah in exchange for being worse versus Sylveon and Vileplume. Glastrier can run a brutal Choice Band set to immediately pressure the opposition; however, such a set is very prone to getting forced out due to Glastrier's low Speed and common weaknesses as an Ice-type. Offensive sets can drop Substitute for an extra attack, making Glastrier very hard to wall, but losing Substitute makes Glastrier more vulnerable to status and revenge killers. Taunt can be used to deny the recovery and utility moves of Pokemon like Quagsire at the cost of setting up. Endure + Custap Berry can also be used over Substitute for a surprise KO versus revenge killers. High Horsepower provides coverage for Doublade, Salazzle, and Arcanine but is otherwise inferior to Close Combat.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types: Diancie is a huge concern for Glastrier given Diamond Storm breaks its Substitute and can increase Diancie's Defense. This attack can stop Glastrier sweeps while allowing Diancie itself to sweep with Body Press. Other Rock-types like Tyrantrum and Aerodactyl are threatening revenge killers with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Not all walls succumb to Glastrier's boosted attacks; Unaware Quagsire especially stops all sweeps. Running into Haze Mantine, Arcanine, Doublade, or Weezing is bad news, too, given their typings and access to status moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Wallbreakers like Sirfetch'd, Toxicroak, and Machamp are tough for Glastrier to deal with without a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Faster Wallbreakers: Utilizing powerful STAB moves or super effective coverage, Pokemon like Goodra, Duraludon, Sylveon, and Exploud are all capable of putting decent amounts of pressure on Glastrier; the latter two even go through Substitute with their sound-based STAB attacks. Others like Salazzle and Starmie resist all of Glastrier's moves if it opts for Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage and Status Ailments: All entry hazards wear down Glastrier, making it harder to rely on its bulk to beat revenge killers. Similarly, being inflicted with status makes sweeping nigh impossible.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Glastrier should use Substitute on forced switches or in front of passive Pokemon; the given EV spread allows Glastrier to make beefy 101 HP Substitutes that Vaporeon's Scald won't break. The EV spread also allows it to outspeed Vaporeon and other uninvested walls such as Guzzlord and Vileplume. Close Combat is the overall best coverage move available, blasting through Steel-types like Copperajah and Escavalier and hitting Water-types like Vaporeon for good neutral damage.</p> <p>Partners like Talonflame and Passimian easily draw in targets like Vaporeon and Mudsdale for Glastrier to safely set up versus; their status moves and Knock Off support, respectively, give Glastrier an easier time breaking through foes and performing a late-game sweep. Vaporeon is an excellent partner, protecting Glastrier from Fire-type attacks and passing Wishes to augment its stellar bulk. In return, Glastrier can take advantage of Pokemon that like to switch into Vaporeon like Vileplume. Glastrier is threatened by Fighting-types, so partners like Garbodor, Talonflame, and Xatu are appreciated; the latter two also provide entry hazard control.</p> "
