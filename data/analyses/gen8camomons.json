However, this set is very slow and opens Cresselia up to crippling status moves like Toxic. Cresselia can also forego Calm Mind and use Trick instead to cripple opposing defensive Pokemon with its Black Sludge and provide counterplay to opposing Trick users. However, this is inconsistent, since many defensive threats hold Black Sludge as well, and an incorrect timing of the move could result in Cresselia holding undesirable items like a Choice Scarf. Cresselia's great bulk and access to recovery also make it a reliable Trick Room setter to support slower offensive teammates like Glastrier and Melmetal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mold Breaker Ground-types and Thousand Arrows</strong>: Earthquake Haxorus and Excadrill are big threats to Cresselia, as their ability Mold Breaker allows them to hit with a super effective STAB move. Thousand Arrows from Zygarde-10% also bypasses Levitate. However, none of these threats are able to OHKO Cresselia without boosting to at least +2 Attack.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Cresselia is walled and forced out by offensive and defensive Steel-types like Mew, Hydreigon, Garchomp, and Melmetal. They are immune to Toxic, resist Cresselia's main STAB move, and can punish it with their Steel-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-type attackers like Tapu Lele and Psychic Volcarona threaten out Cresselia's Toxic set and can hit other sets for strong neutral damage.</p> <p><strong>Clefable</strong>: Cresselia is forced out by all versions of Clefable. Dark / Poison Unaware Clefable ignores Calm Mind boosts and can't be poisoned, while offensive Magic Guard Clefable can set up with Calm Mind and quickly use up Cresselia's Moonlight PP.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Cresselia's impressive bulk and useful ability in Levitate along with access to reliable recovery, status, and setup moves make it a defensive behemoth that is difficult to wear down and break through. Its Poison typing from Toxic pairs nicely with Levitate, making it immune to both the poison status and Ground-type attacks while leaving it with only two weaknesses. Toxic puts offensive threats like Fire / Grass Volcarona and Hydreigon on a timer to prevent them from using setup moves effectively. Moonblast is a spammable attack that grants Cresselia a Fairy typing, which gives it an immunity and stacks useful resistances with its Poison typing. Moonlight is Cresselia's reliable recovery and keeps it healthy. Calm Mind keeps Cresselia from being overly passive and allows it to set up on other passive Pokemon like Blissey and Slowbro, or boost alongside opposing Calm Mind users like Electric / Dragon Latios, wearing all the aforementioned Pokemon down with Toxic as it sets up. Thunder Wave is another option that punishes offensive threats that Toxic can't, like Poison-type Garchomp, Latias, and Naganadel. It provides a great defensive typing with only one weakness thanks to Levitate and useful resistances to Flying- and Electric-type attacks that Toxic variants take neutral damage from. Shadow Ball gives Cresselia another unique typing with multiple immunities, mainly to high-powered Normal-type attacks like Extreme Speed, Facade, and Boomburst. It also allows Cresselia to have more coverage when it sets up with Calm Mind, but it makes Cresselia vulnerable to Ghost-type STAB moves like Shadow Claw and Shadow Ball, which are commonly seen on Facade and Boomburst users like Heracross and Noivern. Black Sludge is the item of choice for Poison-type Cresselia, as it increases Cresselia's longevity and punishes Trick users, while other Cresselia sets opt for Leftovers. A Bold nature with full investment in HP and Defense allows Cresselia to take on numerous physical attackers like Landorus-T, Lycanroc-D without Iron Head, and most unboosted Extreme Speed users outside of Zygarde-10% with Thousand Arrows.</p> <p>While Cresselia is bulky, it is still vulnerable to high-powered neutral attacks like Guts-boosted Facade from Heracross and Triple Axel from Choice Band Pheromosa. Each of these attacks can 2HKO Cresselia with prior damage, so it is important to pair Cresselia with teammates that can stomach these hits like defensive Water / Poison Slowbro and Normal-resistant Pokemon such as Steel-type Buzzwole. These teammates also help cover Cresselia's few remaining weaknesses to types like Poison, Psychic, or Steel, depending on Cresselia's typing. Magnezone can pair with Cresselia to trap and eliminate Steel-types like Buzzwole and Scizor. While Cresselia can use Calm Mind to combat certain opposing setup threats, others like Psychic Volcarona and Taunt Spectrier can quickly overwhelm it. Defensive Dark / Poison Pokemon such as Unaware Clefable and Toxapex make great partners for Cresselia to handle the setup threats that can break past it.</p>"

Clefable can choose to run an alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 Spe with a Bold nature in order to outspeed threats such as Conkeldurr, Rhyperior and Melmetal; however, this does hamper Clefable's ability to take physical hits somewhat.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Threats such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Ground / Flying Mew, and Water / Ground Salamence are immune to Thunderbolt and can all hit Clefable super effectively with their strong physical Ground-type STAB attacks, potentially OHKOing it in the majority of cases. However, none of the aforementioned threats easily switch in into offensive Clefable's Fairy-type STAB.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical wallbreakers such as Landorus-T, Lycanroc-D, Urshifu, and Dracovish can all heavily threaten Clefable. Lycanroc-D and Urshifu in particular can usually switch into Unaware Clefable quite safely and threaten to heavily dent it in return, though both struggle to break offensive Clefable.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Although they cannot do that much in return, walls such as opposing Unaware Clefable, Chansey, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking can take on Magic Guard Clefable's boosted attacks and pivot into powerful breakers that can threaten it in return.</p> <p><strong>Poison- and Steel-Types</strong>: Poison- and Steel-types have ample opportunity to switch in via Unaware Clefable's Toxic or offensive Clefable's Moonblast. Those that resist Knock Off such as Steel / Fighting Melmetal, Dark / Poison Toxapex, and Dark / Poison Tornadus-T do particularly well against Unaware Clefable, while Poison / Electric Latias and Steel / Ground Melmetal are able to switch into offensive sets safely.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Calm Mind Sweepers</strong>: Calm Mind users such as Electric / Poison Latias, Cresselia, and Magearna can boost alongside Clefable and potentially outdamage it and beat it one-on-one.</p>",

With Knock Off and Toxic, Clefable can cripple various opposing threats, and it utilizes an amazing defensive typing with only one weakness. Clefable can be used as a dedicated Stealth Rock setter, since it can annoy common Defog users such as Tornadus-T, Mew, and Salamence by statusing them and removing important items such as Heavy-Duty Boots via Knock Off. Seismic Toss is a more consistent damaging option that lets Clefable effectively wear down opposing threats that either resist Knock Off or are immune to Toxic such as Cresselia, Latias, and opposing Clefable. Aromatherapy is another option that enables Clefable to cure itself and its teammates from status, which can be crucial on more defensive teams. Black Sludge provides Clefable with passive recovery, which can enable it to better survive hits from stronger threats such as Fleur Cannon Magearna and Choice Specs Tapu Lele. Heavy-Duty Boots is an alternative item option that enables Clefable to switch in more proficiently without needing to take entry hazard damage.</p> <p>Clefable appreciates teammates that can handle physically offensive threats such as Landorus-T, Pheromosa, and Lycanroc-D. Thus, partners such as Mew, Slowbro, and Landorus-T all make great choices. Mew and Landorus-T in particular can provide Clefable with entry hazard support, enabling it to wear down targets more quickly in tandem with Knock Off + Toxic. Offensive teammates such as Tornadus-T, Garchomp, and Rillaboom also pair well with Clefable, as Clefable can help wear down their checks and enable them to break through the opposing team more easily. Entry hazard removal is also crucial for Clefable due to its susceptibility to both Stealth Rock and Spikes if it does not run Heavy-Duty Boots. Partners such as Latias, Defog Mew, and Avalugg all pair well with Clefable in this regard.</p>"

Thunderbolt compliments Moonblast well by targeting threats that resist Fairy like Steel / Flying Mew, Water / Poison Latias, and Fire / Flying Tornadus-T. Flamethrower can be used as a secondary STAB option over Thunderbolt, enabling Clefable to target checks such as Ferrothorn and Steel / Ground Garchomp. Life Orb boosts Clefable's power without the drawback of recoil thanks to its ability. As Calm Mind already boosts Clefable's Special Defense, a Bold nature and investment in HP and Defense enable it to sponge as many physical moves as possible.</p> <p>Thunderbolt Clefable struggles against specially defensive walls like Ferrothorn, Steel / Ground Kommo-o, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking. Thus, partners such as Swords Dance Garchomp, Lycanroc-D, and Heracross all make amazing teammates. Flamethrower Clefable struggles with Steel / Ground Pokemon immune to Fire-type attacks such as Coalossal and Heatran; thus, partners that can threaten them out like Landorus, Pheromosa, and Water / Dragon Hydreigon are very valuable additions alongside it. Due to the more offensive nature of this set, backup defensive pivots such as Mew, Blissey, and Buzzwole are much appreciated to keep opposing wallbreakers such as Haxorus and Melmetal in check.

An alternative spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe can be used to slightly increase Arcanine's bulk while ensuring it still outspeeds threats like Rillaboom and offensive Magearna. Leftovers can be used to increase Arcanine's longevity, though Life Orb's immediate power is generally preferred. Normal / Fighting Arcanine with Close Combat can be used to hit Steel-types without recoil, though this set needs Crunch to hit Ghost-types. Wild Charge can be used to hit bulky Water-types such as Mew, Slowbro, and Galarian Slowking, though the recoil makes this option riskier.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Steel / Ground Heatran is the most reliable check to Arcanine, as it has high bulk, is Normal-resistant, and can threaten to KO Arcanine; even Normal / Fire Arcanine is unable to threaten Heatran due to Flash Fire.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Both offensive and defensive Ghost-types are a massive threat to Arcanine. Defensive Ghost-types such as Slowbro, Galarian Slowking, and Cresselia are able to wall Arcanine well, though they can be vulnerable to Normal / Dark Arcanine. On the other hand, offensive Ghost-types like Latios, Alakazam, and Heracross are able to take advantage of Arcanine's Speed tier and their Ghost immunity to threaten it.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex</strong>: Toxapex threatens Arcanine with Toxic, walls all of its sets, and prevents it from setting up with Haze.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Steel-types</strong>: Defensive Steel-types like Mew, Reuniclus, and Salamence are able to check Normal / Fairy Arcanine well and threaten to KO it with their STAB attacks, though they are vulnerable to Arcanine's Normal / Fire sets.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Salamence, and Mew make great checks to Normal / Fire Arcanine and threaten to KO it with their STAB attacks while also being passable checks to other Arcanine sets as well.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Fire-type Arcanine is prone to residual damage from Life Orb and Flare Blitz, and often wears itself down throughout the match, making it easier to revenge kill or even causing itself to faint.</p>",

Flare Blitz can be used to provide Arcanine with a Normal / Fire typing, which lets it break Steel-types such as Mew, Reuniclus, and Magearna. Flare Blitz should be used in conjunction with Heavy-Duty Boots and Intimidate to eliminate Arcanine's weakness to entry hazards. Crunch lets Arcanine hit Ghost-types; this option can be used as either a STAB option that grants it a Normal / Dark typing or a coverage option on Normal / Fire sets. Morning Sun provides Arcanine with recovery and increases its longevity as a wallbreaker. Arcanine becomes a powerful setup sweeper with Howl; this allows it to break past walls and sweep offensive threats with ease. Life Orb increases the power of Arcanine's attacks and increases its wallbreaking power. Toxic is another option to hinder its bulkier checks such as Slowbro and Salamence.

Paired with Tapu Lele, Alakazam is threatening in Psychic Terrain with Expanding Force and Focus Blast as well as immunity to Extreme Speed. However, Psychic Terrain-based teams require a lot of support to perform well. Alakazam can use Recover over Taunt or Encore to shake off any damage taken, but it is generally too frail to see much benefit from reliable recovery. Other team support options for the last move include Knock Off, Toxic, and Thunder Wave. Teleport is another option that allows Alakazam to pivot as its checks switch in, but Alakazam lacks the bulk to be a reliable pivot. Focus Sash sets can run Counter as the last move in order to revenge kill setup sweepers and faster threats like Haxorus and Rillaboom, but it is prediction reliant and misses out on Ghost-type attackers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Foes</strong>: Alakazam is quite frail and can be KOed by faster offensive threats like Dragapult, Pheromosa, Spectrier, and Naganadel. Focus Sash sets can beat these foes one-on-one, though, if Alakazam is still at full health.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks</strong>: While Alakazam is immune to Extreme Speed, users of other priority moves like Rillaboom, Scizor, and Lycanroc-D can OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Poison / Dark Walls</strong>: Ghost / Fairy sets can struggle to break past specially defensive Poison / Dark types like Unaware Clefable, Toxapex, and RegenVest Tornadus-T. Clefable and Toxapex are vulnerable to Taunt, which prevents recovery moves and Haze, but they can use Knock Off to remove Alakazam's Life Orb to reduce its damage output.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey's massive special bulk and common typings like Normal / Ghost and Normal / Fairy allow it to check Alakazam fairly well, although Normal / Fairy variants can be 2HKOed by +2 Focus Blast, and Blissey is generally vulnerable to Taunt.</p>",

Focus Blast complements Shadow Ball well, allowing Alakazam to 2HKO Dark / Poison Clefable and hit other Dark-types like Lycanroc-D and Hippowdon, although Alakazam has to watch out for Sucker Punch from the former. While Focus Blast provides a strong yet inaccurate secondary STAB move, Dazzling Gleam has less power but lets Alakazam hit Normal / Ghost types like Blissey and more reliably hit threats like Normal / Dark Arcanine and Heracross. Nasty Plot allows Alakazam to 2HKO specially defensive checks like RegenVest Galarian Slowking and Tornadus-T with Focus Blast. Taunt prevents checks like Blissey and Clefable from healing or using status moves, which can allow Alakazam to break past them with boosted attacks. Encore is a less reliable option that locks foes into recovery or status moves, which gives Alakazam an opportunity to set up with Nasty Plot. Life Orb benefits from Magic Guard nullifying its recoil damage. Focus Sash is another option on more offensive teams, as it gives Alakazam an opportunity to revenge kill setup sweepers or use Nasty Plot.</p> <p>Other special setup sweepers like Latias, Galarian Slowking, and Volcarona appreciate Focus Blast Alakazam's ability to break past Unaware Clefable and certain RegenVest users like Slowking and Galarian Slowking, as this gives them opportunities to set up and sweep as well. These teammates also benefit from Alakazam's ability to absorb Toxic, which would otherwise put them on a timer. Alakazam is outsped by threats like Tornadus-T, Naganadel, and Pheromosa, so defensive teammates like Clefable, Mew, and Salamence can help check these threats while controlling entry hazards to support the team. Alakazam is prone to revenge killing from priority users like Rillaboom, Scizor, and Sucker Punch Lycanroc-D; Mew and Salamence can also help check these threats.

Iron Defense doubles the power of Body Press and makes Slowbro even more physically bulky. When running Scald, Toxic can be used over Body Press to provide a solid defensive typing and help Slowbro avoid being poisoned itself, but this makes Slowbro very passive and vulnerable to Taunt.

Shadow Ball Slowbro gains two great immunities to Fighting-type attacks like Close Combat and strong Normal-type moves like Extreme Speed, Facade, and Boomburst, allowing it to switch into attacks from threats like Entei, Heracross, and Kommo-o to scout and heal with Regenerator. Scald offers no immunities but gives Slowbro a number of useful resistances to Fire, Ice, and Water, which allow it to check physical threats such as Triple Axel Pheromosa, Fire-type Entei, and Aqua Tail Garchomp. Body Press takes advantage of Slowbro's naturally high defense and makes for a powerful attack that requires no offensive investment. Slack Off lets Slowbro recover without needing to switch out, which comes in handy against passive Pokemon like Blissey. Rocky Helmet lets Slowbro punish physical attackers by chipping away at their health, after which Slowbro just heals as it switches out. Leftovers is another option, but it is not as useful as Rocky Helmet because Slowbro already has two methods of healing. Heavy-Duty Boots is a third item option that allows Slowbro to pivot while Spikes and Toxic Spikes are on the field and reduces chip damage. A Relaxed nature with full defensive investment maximizes Slowbro's physical bulk and increases the power of Body Press, while minimum Speed lets Slowbro deal with Trick Room attackers and have the slowest possible Teleport for momentum.</p> <p>Slowbro appreciates specially defensive teammates such as Dark / Poison Unaware Clefable and Toxapex to handle the special attackers that force it out.

Opposing Dark / Poison Clefable and Toxapex can also cripple Slowbro with Toxic and Knock Off, so physical wallbreakers like Garchomp and Melmetal make great offensive teammates that can pressure them.

Magnezone is another particularly threatening Electric-type check, as it can trap and OHKO Scizor.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Fire-types</strong>: Offensive Fire-types like Heatran, Hydreigon, Volcarona, and Tornadus-T are solid offensive checks, as they outspeed Scizor and resist its Bullet Punch. However, they usually cannot switch into Scizor without the risk of taking massive damage from its Dual Wingbeat.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew is a great defensive check to Scizor with both its bulky Water- and Steel-type sets. Water-type Mew is able to check Scizor more effectively than other bulky Water-types, as it is faster than Scizor and can more properly threaten it with Scald or Will-O-Wisp. Steel-type Mew resists both of Scizor's STAB moves but is reliant on Will-O-Wisp to properly beat it.</p>",

Dual Wingbeat provides Scizor with a Steel / Flying typing, which is a solid defensive typing to maximize its setup opportunities, and allows it to hit bulky Water-types like Mew, Toxapex, and Latias. Additionally, Dual Wingbeat Scizor is able to check threats such as Rillaboom and Landorus-T by threatening to OHKO them. Swords Dance allows Scizor to break past walls like Mew and Toxapex. Roost keeps Scizor healthy against its bulkier checks and allows it to properly check Fairy / Poison Cresselia. Life Orb is used to boost Scizor's power even further and works well in conjunction with Roost. Technician boosts both of Scizor's STAB attacks, which allows it to 2HKO the majority of the unresisted metagame.</p> <p>Scizor is able to threaten faster threats like Pheromosa, Spectrier, and Tornadus-T, so slower Pokemon like Latias, Hydreigon, and offensive Mew appreciate its speed control. Ground-type partners like Garchomp and Hydreigon pressure some Electric-types that threaten Scizor; it should be noted though that Ground-immune Electric-types like Latias and offensive Mew require these partners to have strong secondary STAB attacks to properly beat them. Scizor is able to complement Ground-types by being a solid offensive check to Rillaboom, though it cannot switch in safely to Superpower variants. While Scizor is able to break past bulky Water-types, they are often able to threaten it out with Scald or coverage options; specially attacking Dragon-type partners like Latias, Latios, and Dragapult are able to switch into these threats without being hindered by Scald burns.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Feint is a solid option for Heracross's third moveslot that allows it to take down faster offensive threats, and even some Extreme Speed users at +2, though the lack of coverage moves makes Heracross easier to wall. A Fighting-type Heracross with Close Combat as its main STAB move is an option, with a Fighting / Dark typing being used the most. Dark / Fighting Heracross has less breaking capability than Heracross's main sets, as it doesn't have the powerful STAB Facade at its disposal. Normal / Fighting Heracross is an option as well for Fighting-type Heracross, though this set is starkly worse against Ghost-types. Spikes is a strong option on any Heracross set over Swords Dance to offer team support and chip potential switch-ins, though losing Swords Dance limits its breaking capability.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Salamence</strong>: Defensive Steel / Flying Salamence is a reliable check to Heracross's sets since it resists Facade, can tank any of Heracross' coverage moves comfortably, and generally runs Rocky Helmet to further chip Heracross. Additionally, Salamence is able to remove hazards that either Heracross or its teammates set with Defog, which can make it even more difficult for Heracross to make progress.</p> <p><strong>Buzzwole</strong>: Similarly to Salamence, a bulky Steel / Flying Buzzwole is able to wall Heracross, and Buzzwole is able to more reliably check Swords Dance sets compared to Salamence by virtue of Bulk Up.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ghost-type Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Ghost-type Pokemon such as Ghost / Fairy Cresselia and Ghost / Fighting Slowbro are some of the best checks to some of Heracross's sets, though both of these Pokemon lose to Normal / Ghost Heracross.</p> <p><strong>Tornadus-T</strong>: Tornadus-T is a huge offensive threat to Heracross and any of its sets are able to stop Heracross from sweeping, though it cannot reliably switch into any of Heracross's moves. Even if Heracross has Sticky Web support, Flying-type Tornadus-T sets are solid offensive checks to Heracross.</p> <p><strong>Latios</strong>: Latios is another great offensive check to Heracross by virtue of its Speed tier and immunity to Sticky Web via Levitate. Every variant of Latios is able to cleanly OHKO Heracross, and Ghost-type variants of Latios are also able to switch into Heracross's Facade, though this is risky given Latios is OHKOed by the rest of Heracross's coverage.</p> <p><strong>Dragapult</strong>: Dragapult an offensive check to Heracross that fits onto many teams. It has multiple options to OHKO Heracross and gains momentum on switch-ins by pivoting out. As with other offensive checks, Dragapult cements itself as a reliable check as it can nullify Sticky Web with Clear Body.</p>",

Shadow Claw and Knock Off both allow Normal-type Heracross to break through Pokemon resistant or immune to Normal. STAB Shadow Claw is able to hit common defensive Ghost-types, such as Ghost / Fighting Slowbro, and a Normal / Ghost typing makes Heracross immune to Fighting- and Normal-type attacks such as Boomburst, Close Combat, and Extreme Speed, each of which is threatening to Heracross's other sets. Knock Off is the main coverage choice for Ghost-type Heracross, as it hits opposing Normal / Ghost Pokemon and offers great support by removing items. On the other hand, Close Combat is the coverage option of choice on Dark-type Heracross to hit Steel / Fairy Pokemon such as Magearna and Reuniclus, and it heavily damages Pokemon resistant to Normal that have already had their items removed. Swords Dance allows Heracross to break opposing teams much more effectively and break past walls it normally could not.</p> <p>Heracross has limited defensive counterplay, but against offensive teams, it generally relies on extensive support from teammates like Latios and Dragapult, which are much faster and able to dismantle most of Heracross's offensive checks effectively. Clefable and Dragon / Fairy Necrozma can act as defensive switch-ins to Heracross's offensive checks such as Dragapult, Latios, and Fighting / Flying Tornadus-T. Additionally, Sticky Web support from Araquanid is a highly effective strategy to weaken Heracross's offensive checks considerably. For the few defensive Pokemon that give Heracross a hard time, strong special attackers such as Electric / Fairy Clefable and Fighting / Flying Tornadus-T are able to break past them. They also provide support with Stealth Rock and pivoting, respectively, both of which increase Heracross' breaking capabilities. It's important to note that, in any game, Heracross is constantly losing HP due to the effects of Flame Orb, so it's important to make the most of every turn it's on the field.</p>"

Thunder Wave is an option to hinder attackers such as Garchomp, Tornadus-T, and Latias, although Toxic is generally the more reliable status move for Blissey. 8 HP / 252 Def / 248 SpD is an alternative EV spread that allows Blissey to more reliably wall special attackers at the cost of some physical bulk. Blissey can run Aromatherapy and Toxic to gain a Grass / Poison typing, which allows it to wall metagame threats such as Latias, Cresselia, and Electric / Fairy Clefable. However, outside of walling these threats, that typing is not a desirable defensive typing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off users such as Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, and Heracross as well as Clefable and Toxpex can threaten Blissey.

Heal Bell is another option that gives Blissey a pure Normal typing, provides a neutrality to U-turn and Knock Off, and lets it act as a cleric. Seismic Toss provides valuable chip damage against offensive Pokemon such as Dragapult, Landorus-T, and Pheromosa. Toxic is used to to put foes on a timer while allowing Blissey to check setup sweepers with recovery such as Volcarona, Mew, and Tornadus-T. Stealth Rock is an alternate option that allows Blissey to fill the role of a entry hazard setter.

Dragon Tail offers good utility and keeps Salamence from being set up on.

Superpower completes its Bug / Fighting typing, which allows it to check threats such as Rillaboom and Lycanroc-D. Iron Tail is an alternative that gives Landorus-T a Bug / Steel typing; this option allows it to properly check Heracross and Cresselia, although it cannot properly check the aforementioned threats that Bug / Fighting sets can. Knock Off acts as both a solid coverage option that hits Ghost-types like Latias, Blissey, and Reuniclus, and a support tool that removes items. Stealth Rock is an option to damage foes on the switch in and pairs well with Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots. Landorus-T does struggle against some common Defoggers such as Latias, Mew, and Salamence, so Defog can be used instead if you have another Stealth Rock user on your team. Rocky Helmet is useful for chipping down foes like Rillaboom, Lycanroc-D, and Heracross, while Leftovers can be used for passive recovery. 16 Speed EVs ensure that Landorus-T can outspeed maximum Speed neutral-natured threats like Tyranitar, Clefable, and Aegislash.</p> <p>Strong special wallbreakers such as Latias, Latios, Hydreigon, and Tornadus-T appreciate Landorus-T's entry hazards and U-turn support; Landorus-T can pivot against checks like Slowbro and Mew and bring in these partners to threaten them. Landorus-T is a solid check to Rillaboom, so bulky Water-types like Mew, Slowbro, Salamence, and Latias make good partners and check Fire-types that threaten Landorus-T in return. Landorus-T is weak to Flying- and Fairy-types such as Tornadus-T and Cresselia, so it appreciates support from Steel-types like Heatran, Reuniclus, and Mew. Even with Leftovers, Landorus-T is prone to being worn down, so partners with Wish such as Latias, Salamence, and Vaporeon are able to keep it healthy.</p>"

U-turn allows Landorus-T to gain momentum on potential switch-ins and chip them heavily. Knock Off is a useful coverage option that can remove items and allows Landorus-T to OHKO Ghost-type Latios and Heracross. Explosion is a useful tool that can OHKO a wide range of Pokemon in a pinch, but losing Landorus-T in the process makes this a risky option. Defog and Stealth Rock can also be useful options to control entry hazards on the field against faster teams, but they run the risk of losing momentum in the process. Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature in combination with a Choice Scarf are required to outspeed threats such as Spectrier and Pheromosa.</p> <p>Slower attackers such as Hydreigon, Heracross, and Choice Band Victini appreciate Landorus-T's ability to remove faster threats like Latios, Lycanroc-D, and Spectrier.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lycanroc-D can increase its damage output by running Iron Tail instead of Iron Head, but this has the cost of having unreliable accuracy. Drill Run is another coverage option that allows Lycanroc-D to hit defensive Steel- and Fire-types, but it is not as useful in a metagame where Flying-types and Levitate are common. A Rock-type Lycanroc-D with Accelerock provides alternate Tough Claws-boosted priority that can hit foes more reliably than Sucker Punch, but its power is much weaker and it leaves Lycanroc-D running Stone Edge, which isn't boosted by its ability and has shaky accuracy. Psychic Fangs allows Lycanroc-D to hit Poison-type walls like Cresselia and Latias reliably, but the prevalence of Dark-types in the metagame makes using this move harder to justify.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Poison-types</strong>: Bulky Poison-type Pokemon like Toxapex, Latias, and Cresselia each have methods of checking and stalling Lycanroc-D thanks to their access to recovery, useful abilities, and status-inflicting moves like Scald from Toxapex and Toxic from each.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: With Life Orb being its best item, Lycanroc-D is constantly chipping its own health. Outside of Steel-type variants, Lycanroc-D is open to chip damage from every entry hazard, and running contact moves to take advantage of Tough Claws means Rocky Helmet effectively punishes it. Too much chip damage over a battle can severely limit Lycanroc-D's opportunities to cause damage.</p> <p><strong>Extreme Speed</strong>: Although Steel-type Lycanroc-D resists Extreme Speed, all other variants take neutral damage from it and are easily 2HKOed by unboosted hits. +1 or Choice Band-boosted Extreme Speed from Adamant Entei or Lucario can OHKO Lycanroc-D with a favorable roll or after minor chip damage.</p>",

Combine this with its nice Speed, a plethora of strong physical contact moves, and access to priority, setup, and Stealth Rock, and it becomes one of the scariest wallbreakers in the metagame. Crunch grants Lycanroc-D a Dark typing and STAB on Sucker Punch. Iron Head notably covers the Fairy-types aiming to wall Dark-type moves while Play Rough covers the Dark- and Fighting-types hoping to check Dark-type attacks. Close Combat is a third option for the secondary STAB move that provides a much higher Base Power and hits Normal- and Steel-types even harder, but it leaves Lycanroc-D unable to hit Pokemon with Fairy and Poison typings, like Cresselia, as easily. Sucker Punch provides Lycanroc-D with powerful priority to take on faster offensive threats like Dragapult, Tornadus-T, and Naganadel. Lycanroc-D is a great Stealth Rock setter thanks to its breaking potential forcing the opponent to switch often. Swords Dance is another option that quickly makes Lycanroc-D even more threatening and can potentially lead to sweeps with a stronger Sucker Punch. Life Orb provides Lycanroc-D with the most immediate power, but it wears it down over longer battles and can put it in range of even resisted hits like Extreme Speed due to its poor bulk. Focus Sash is an option, particularly if you're running Lycanroc-D as a lead, to allow it to use Stealth Rock or Swords Dance safely. A Jolly nature is needed to outspeed threats like Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Terrakion and Speed tie with Latios and Latias.</p> <p>While Lycanroc-D has various methods of breaking through walls, team support is very important to optimize its damage output and opportunities to come in. Lycanroc-D's most common typings are able to hit most defensive typings at least neutrally, but they can struggle to break past certain combinations like Water / Poison, Dark / Poison, and certain Fairy and Flying typings. Strong special attackers like Dragon / Electric Latios and Ground / Steel Hydreigon can help Lycanroc-D pressure threats like Toxapex, Latias, and Cresselia. Lycanroc-D is able to target certain faster threats with Sucker Punch, but it is unable to take on most Extreme Speed users, since its defenses are frail. Bulky Normal-type checks like Ghost / Dragon Salamence and Ghost / Fighting Slowbro can take on Extreme Speeds aimed at Lycanroc-D and chip their users with Rocky Helmet. Lycanroc-D also appreciates teammates like Tornadus-T and Dark-type Heracross that can remove opposing Rocky Helmets and, in Tornadus-T's case, remove entry hazards with Defog to cut down on the residual damage Lycanroc-D takes.</p>"

Water / Poison Toxapex can also utilize Knock Off over Haze, but without Haze it fails to check Calm Mind Clefable and Latias.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-type Attackers</strong>: Ground-type attackers such as Landorus-T, Melmetal, and Heatran easily break past Toxapex. However, Scald from Water / Poison Toxapex can somewhat deter physical Ground-types.</p> <p><strong>Tapu Lele</strong>: Tapu Lele is a huge threat to Water / Poison Toxapex due to its powerful Psychic-type attacks. Choice Specs Tapu Lele is especially threatening, as it's also difficult for Toxapex's partners to deal with, and it can even break Dark / Poison Toxapex in some cases.</p> <p><strong>Garchomp</strong>: Garchomp breaks past Toxapex with little effort. Offensive Stealth Rock sets, such as Ground / Steel and Dragon / Steel, are generally immune to Toxic, and some run Lum Berry to avoid a burn from Scald as well. After just one Swords Dance, any Garchomp set can 2HKO either Toxapex set.</p> <p><strong>Heracross</strong>: Heracross can break past either Toxapex set easily with STAB Guts Facade. Additionally, thanks to Guts, Heracross doesn't care about burns from Scald. It can fear Knock Off if Flame Orb hasn't activated yet, but otherwise it is a solid check to Toxapex.</p> <p><strong>Hydreigon</strong>: Most of Hydreigon's type configurations do not struggle with Toxapex at all. While Hydreigon generally runs Ground-type, it sets itself apart from other Ground-type attackers, as its Water / Dragon set breaks Toxapex as well. Ground / Steel Hydreigon in particular is able to threaten Toxapex without fear of being poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Attackers</strong>: Electric-type attackers such as Tapu Koko, Latios, and Clefable are all able to threaten Toxapex in some way, though they can struggle to break past Dark / Poison Toxapex in some cases. Clefable is less secure, as it can't break past Dark / Poison Toxapex reliably and runs the risk of Toxapex using Knock Off. Choice Specs Tapu Koko can 2HKO Toxapex if Stealth Rock is up or gain momentum with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Substitute and Taunt</strong>: Since Toxapex is passive, relying heavily on chipping opponents with Toxic damage and usually needing mulitple hits to break Substitutes, Substitute and Taunt are both strong tools to exploit it.</p>",

Regenerator and Recover give it multiple tools to increase its longevity. Knock Off gives Toxapex its Dark typing while providing valuable team support. Toxapex's Poison-type moveslot is flexible, with Toxic Spikes providing the most team support. Toxic is a secondary option that more immediately poisons foes like Heavy-Duty Boots Volcarona and affects Flying-type and Levitate foes. Baneful Bunker is a less common option that allows Toxapex to scout moves from Choice item users and physical attackers or stall another turn of burn or poison damage. Haze is necessary to effectively stop special attackers such as offensive Clefable, Steel-type Magearna, and Poison-type Latias from setting up, as each is immune to Toxic damage. Haze also allows Toxapex to check a number of setup sweepers in a pinch, though it has to be cautious to not lose too much HP in the process.</p> <p>Toxapex fits on most playstyles, but it truly thrives on balance and bulky offense teams, providing crucial support for both.
