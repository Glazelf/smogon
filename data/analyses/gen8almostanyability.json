Zapdos's EVs can vary significantly, mostly depending on what it wants to outspeed. As mentioned above, 72 Speed EVs allows Zapdos to outspeed Modest maximum Speed investment Heatran, allowing Zapdos to either pivot out via U-turn or deal a large amount damage with Weather Ball, while 56 Speed EVs allow Zapdos to outspeed Adamant Tapu Bulu and then KO it with Hurricane. Maximum Speed investment can also be run on Zapdos to help its team's matchup against Tapu Lele, Genesect, and Adamant Zarude. Additionally, Zapdos can opt to run a more defensive spread to better fit into its role as a check to physical attackers such as Talonflame. Defog can also be run on Zapdos, but it is usually not a good option, as Zapdos already struggles with fitting all of the moves it wants.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Blissey: Blissey, one of the tier's most common special walls, is very problematic for Zapdos, as it takes very little damage from both Hurricane and Thunder. This means that without an extreme amount of luck, Zapdos is never able to break it.</p> <p><strong>Desolate Land Users</strong>: Many Desolate Land users are able to comfortably switch in on Zapdos, taking its rain away and reducing the accuracy of its STAB attacks to 50% while also changing Weather Ball from a super effective hit to a resisted one.</p> <p><strong>RegenVest</strong>: Pokemon holding Assault Vest are difficult for Zapdos to break, as they take very little damage from Zapdos's attacks and can heal themselves easily thanks to Regenerator. Most of them, such as Silvally-Dragon, Swampert, and Jirachi, resist or are immune to either Thunder or Hurricane, allowing them to slowly pivot out against Zapdos and bring in a powerful breaker that threatens Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Rock- and Ice-types: While Zapdos is bulky enough to take neutral hits without much investment, it is still weak to powerful breakers with super effective STAB moves such as Terrakion and Mamoswine that usually outspeed and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Volt Absorb Corviknight: Zapdos has a very hard time breaking Volt Absorb Corviknight, as it either resists or is immune to both of its STAB moves and can slowly pivot against Zapdos with U-turn to bring in a breaker that threatens Zapdos out.</p> ",

Zapdos's STAB moves allow it to hit almost every relevant Pokemon for at least neutral damage while also having a 30% chance to cripple something with paralysis or confusion. Weather Ball is another attacking option, most notably hitting Desolate Land Heatran for significant damage. U-turn allows Zapdos to pivot out on a predicted switch to a counter, which is a great trait to have in a momentum-reliant tier like AAA and allows it to still make progress against teams with reliable answers to it. Roost gives Zapdos significant longevity and allows it to absorb hits over the course of a longer battle. Zapdos's EVs are very customizable and can be changed depending on what a team needs it to do. The given spread maximizes Zapdos's bulk and power while still outspeeding Modest Heatran.</p> <p>Zapdos can fit on many different team archetypes because of its ability to take neutral hits while threatening powerful attacks back. If Zapdos is not running Weather Ball, it is very weak to Desolate Land users such as Heatran, as it resists Hurricane and takes neutral damage from Thunder, as well as lowering the accuracy of both of those moves to 50% due to the harsh sun. Thus, Zapdos appreciates Pokemon such as Assault Vest Silvally-Dragon that can switch in on the Fire-types safely and then pivot out. Zapdos pairs very well with Pokemon that can threaten specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Assault Vest Swampert that take neutral damage from its STAB attacks. Good partners for this include Zarude and Terrakion. These attackers pair very well with U-turn, as they are able to take advantage of the momentum Zapdos creates. In return, Zapdos can threaten their walls such as Corviknight and Kommo-o.</p> "

Magic Guard avoids every form of chip damage, including Stealth Rock, Rocky Helmet, Toxic, Life Orb, and Brave Bird recoil, allowing it to fire off powerful attacks with low risk. Brave Bird is a strong Flying-type STAB move that has good neutral coverage and 2HKOes common defensive staples such as Tapu Fini, Swampert, and Mandibuzz, while hitting Kommo-o super effectively. Thunderous Kick works particularly well in conjunction with Brave Bird, hitting Steel-types such as Heatran and Corviknight that resist Brave Bird; it also drops the foe's Defense, easing predictions, and lets Galarian Zapdos KO physically defensive Tapu Fini after Stealth Rock by following up Thunderous Kick with Brave Bird. Thunderous Kick is also good at wearing down Dauntless Shield users that can't reliably threaten Galarian Zapdos such as Hippodown and Skarmory lacking Brave Bird. U-turn allows Galarian Zapdos to keep momentum even against its checks such as Zapdos and Dauntless Shield Mew, while chipping them a bit. It also severely damages Mew after a Defense drop, forcing it to recover health. Taunt is a neat option to shut down Pokemon such as Corviknight and Mew that would try to heal or burn Galarian Zapdos with Will-O-Wisp, allowing it to wear them down through the course of a game; however, Taunt is risky because the opponent might use Brave Bird or Ice Beam instead. Close Combat is another option to pass through Flash Fire Corviknight easily, as well as OHKOing some threats such as Ferrothorn or physically defensive Heatran that Thunderous Kick doesn't KO. A Jolly nature is usually preferred to at worst tie with opposing Zapdos, allowing Galarian Zapdos to Taunt it or kill it if it's weakened, but an Adamant nature can be used to maximize damage while still outspeeding defensive Zapdos.</p> <p>Galarian Zapdos fits best on balance teams that can bring it in several times in order to wallbreak efficiently. It likes partners like Barraskewda, Zygarde-10%, and Lucario that share checks with it in order to overwhelm them, especially in conjunction with Taunt. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Heatran is greatly appreciated in order to wear down Galarian Zapdos's checks. Pokemon that can take advantage of Zapdos and Mew such as Desolate Land Heatran, Inteleon, and Tapu Lele are also good teammates. Galarian Zapdos appreciates strong answers to Pokemon that threaten it out such as Tapu Lele, Talonflame, and Azelf, so partners like Jirachi and Flash Fire Corviknight are good teammates.

Stone Edge allows Garchomp to OHKO Volcarona and threaten Flying-types, such as Zapdos, Mandibuzz, and Talonflame, that are immune to Earthquake.

Scale Shot is a good Dragon-type STAB move that can break through Flying-types, such as Landorus-T and Zapdos, while boosting Garchomp's Speed, making it very hard to revenge kill without priority moves. Stone Edge is another option to hit Tapu Bulu and Flying-types without lowering its Defense. Stealth Rock capitalizes on the switches Garchomp forces as well as its ability to heavily damage most Defoggers with its coverage. Fire Fang and Stone Edge are also viable options to hit Corviknight and Tapu Bulu better, especially in conjunction with Swords Dance. An Adamant nature is preferred to maximize damage rolls on Tapu Fini and Swampert, but a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Pokemon with base 100 Speed, such as Zapdos.

However, because it needs to rely on Draining Kiss for recovery instead of Roost, this set doesn't have as much longevity as the standard two attack set.

Draining Kiss acts as Togekiss's main STAB move, and despite its Base Power, its damage output can be increased greatly with Life Orb and Nasty Plot. Togekiss is able to effectively outspeed the entire metagame, meaning Pokemon that can effectively revenge kill it are few and far between, being limited to Fairy resistant Pokemon and Dazzling or Psychic Surge Pokemon. This gives Togekiss a uniquely good matchup versus pivot-heavy bulky offense teams that do not carry an offensive Fire- or Steel- type. Togekiss is also able to set up on and brute-force its way through passive switch-ins such as Corviknight and non-Toxic Blissey. In the late game, Togekiss especially shines as a setup sweeper and wincon when the opponent's team is sufficiently weakened. Because Roost is also a healing move, it benefits from the +3 priority boost provided from Triage as well, allowing Togekiss to sponge some attacks with its above-average bulk and excellent typing and allowing it to act as a check to key threats such as Zarude and Garchomp. Due to Togekiss's narrow niche and need for heavy chip damage on Pokemon that resist its moves to execute a successful sweep, it should be considered as a specialist, only being brought in when a KO can be guaranteed or to pressure exceptionally weak foes out. For coverage moves, Togekiss mainly chooses between Flamethrower and Psyshock. Flamethrower allows it to pressure and beat Steel-types more effectively, while Psyshock allows Togekiss to put a dent into special walls like Blissey and Poison-types like Toxapex. A Modest nature with maximum Special Attack investment aim to maximize Togekiss's offensive capabilities; since it is priority-reliant, Speed and HP investment can be customized, but the current spread allows it to outpace defensive Heatran.</p> <p>Because of its fast Fairy-type attacks, Togekiss acts as an excellent teammate for those that struggle to outpace Dragon-, Fighting-, and Dark-types like Garchomp, Galarian Zapdos, and Zarude. Bulky pivots like Regenerator Swampert and Blissey are both able to weaken those fast threats while switching into Togekiss to clean up with Draining Kiss. Togekiss also pairs nicely with offensive powerhouses like Tinted Lens Latios and Primordial Sea Barraskewda, which can put easily exploitable dents into an opponent's team composition, giving Togekiss a greater opportunity to overwhelm the opponent in the endgame. Because Fire-types are going to be some of Togekiss's first switch-ins, Fire resist-resistant teammates to tank attacks from Fire-types like Volcarona and Heatran are essential teammates. Regenerator Garchomp and Swampert are good teammates to tank attacks while also setting up Stealth Rock. On a similar note, setup sweepers that share the same offensive checks also make great teammates for Togekiss—Sheer Force Genesect and Triage Tapu Bulu can help clear the way for Togekiss by threatening to sweep unless a Fire-type is brought in to revenge kill them, in which case they can chip it low enough that Togekiss can clean up in the lategame, or vice versa. Pokemon that are able to set up hazards and pivot out slowly are also essential teammates for Togekiss, as their hazards weaken Togekiss's offensive switch-ins and allow for more wiggle room for Togekiss to set up Nasty Plot and execute a sweep. Finally, physically offensive Ground-types like Landorus-T or Garchomp are able to threaten Togekiss's common Steel-type counters such as Assault Vest Jirachi, as well as harming specially defensive walls like Blissey, enabling Togekiss's late-game cleanup.</p> "

Close Combat damages Pokemon like Barraskewda and Zarude that would otherwise stay in on Cobalion, and it can also deter Magic Bounce Blissey.

Ground-types like Swampert will often switch into Cobalion as it attempts to pivot with Volt Switch, blocking the pivot and forcing a manual switch. Teammates like Zarude and Dhelmise can handle them. Magic Bounce users like Mew stop Cobalion from setting Stealth Rock, forcing it to switch to a teammate like Corviknight that can deal with them.

A Sniper set with Laser Focus allows Terrakion to beat every common defensive switch in, but once the set is revealed the foe can stay in and attack to deny the Laser Focus turn.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dauntless Shield Users: Dauntless Shield Mew and Hippowdon are two of the few reliable switch ins to Adaptability Terrakion, as they are not 2HKOed by any move even with Stealth Rock up and can heal reliably, counter back with strong super effective attacks, or inflict Terrakion with status.

Rock- and Fighting-type STAB moves have near-perfect coverage by themselves, making Adaptability a fantastic damage amplifying ability for it. With a Choice Band equipped, very few defensive walls can safely switch into Terrakion. Dauntless Shield Mew is one of the most reliable answers as it is never 2HKOed by any of Terrakion's common moves without a critical hit, but even Dauntless Shield Corviknight fails to check Terrakion reliably as Stealth Rock damage is enough to let it get 2HKOed by Close Combat. Terrakion's base 108 Speed is enough to outpace all common defensive Pokemon and a number of common breakers, including Genesect and Tapu Lele, giving it plenty of Pokemon to force out if brought in via a slow pivot or after a KO. While Terrakion will almost always be using its STAB moves, Earthquake is a 100% accurate option to hit Toxapex without getting PP stalled, Megahorn lets Terrakion 2HKO Dauntless Shield Mew after Stealth Rock, and Toxic is a nice option to cripple walls that Terrakion cannot 2HKO like Dauntless Shield Mew and Hippowdon. Stealth Rock is also an option to let Terrakion get entry hazards up on a predicted switch if the opponent has a reliable answer to it. Terrakion runs maximum Speed and Attack investment with a Jolly nature to take advantage of its Speed tier and maximize the number of Pokemon it beats one-on-one.</p> <p>Terrakion fits well on bulky offense teams that can provide it with many opportunities to switch in and fire off strong attacks. While almost nothing can safely switch into Terrakion, it is also true that Terrakion does not want to switch in on many Pokemon either. Therefore, slow pivots like Corviknight, Swampert, and Blissey provide the safe switch in that Terrakion needs and make excellent teammates. Defensive pivots also make good teammates as Terrakion is often forced out after it gets a KO due to its mediocre bulk and only slightly above-average Speed. Good offensive teammates include fast physical attackers that like to take advantage of the weakened or broken defensive cores that Terrakion creates such as Barraskewda, Zarude, and Genesect. Other good offensive teammates include Azelf and Tapu Koko, as they can draw out and pivot on RegenVest Pokemon that Terrakion can beat easily; Azelf can also set up Psychic Terrain to protect Terrakion from Triage. Lastly, Terrakion appreciates entry hazard support, as many of its checks can only check it from high health, and hazards help whittle them down until they can no longer switch in.</p> "

Consequently, strong physical attackers like Terrakion, Zarude, and Garchomp fit well with the pairing, as they greatly benefit from Corviknight being weakened. Focus Sash variants do not require much support, as their main goal is to set up Stealth Rock and use Explosion, but Life Orb variants, being less of suicide leads, appreciate Desolate Land users like Volcarona to take on Water-types like Swampert and Barraskewda. Life Orb Landorus-T especially enjoys teammates like Terrakion and Garchomp, as they burden walls like Corviknight and Tapu Fini to check both them and Landorus-T; this pressure on the walls lessens the need for Landorus-T to heavily chip them but sacrifice itself via Explosion.</p> "

Thanks to its high Base Power moves and Life Orb, which have their recoil negated by Magic Guard, Talonflame hits surprisingly hard despite having a low Attack stat.

Additionally, it resists every common Triage move and Grassy Glide, making it difficult to revenge kill with priority. Swords Dance amplifies Talonflame's offensive presence, and it can often find time to set up safely against either offensive threats it forces out, like Volcarona and Zarude, or defensive stalwarts that are unable to KO it back like Corviknight and most Mew.

Since it is immune to all entry hazards, Talonflame doesn't require hazard control, and Magic Guard means it can't be worn down by stray Toxics or Rocky Helmets (although it does fear paralysis). Since its bulk is not fantastic, it does appreciate slow pivots like Swampert and Corviknight to bring it in safely; in exchange, it forces out foes like Cinderace or Volcarona that may have tried to come in on them. There are some common switch-ins that frustrate Talonflame, however; Primordial Sea Zapdos in particular can't be hit neutrally and forces it out, so teammates that can handle Zapdos like RegenVest Swampert, Blissey, and Silvally-Dragon are always appreciated.

Thousand Arrows hits Flying-types such as Corviknight and Skarmory, easing predictions significantly. It can make progress in most cases by using Thousand Arrows, which hits a significant amount of the metagame for neutral damage and has no immunities. Toxic is used to cripple common switch-ins to Zygarde-10%, such as Dauntless Shield Mew and Hippowdon, wearing them down throughout the game. Glare can be used to spread paralysis to help slower teammates beat their checks and to thwart recovery chance from its own checks. Outrage hits most Ground-resistant Pokemon for strong damage, but it is unreliable, as it locks you into it. Extreme Speed is useful priority to finish off weakened Pokemon that are faster than Zygarde-10%, such as Tapu Koko and Barraskewda. This EV spread maximizes Zygarde-10%'s offensive prowess while utilizing its high Speed tier to pressure threats like Terrakion.</p> <p>Zygarde-10% is a good addition to teams that want to remove Steel- and Fire-type foes for its teammates. Its ability to hit common defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight is greatly appreciated by offensive partners such as Zarude. It is also able to beat Fire-types like Heatran that would give common offensive Pokemon such as Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko trouble. Zygarde-10% has poor bulk and is easy to revenge kill with common priority moves from Pokemon such as Zarude and Triage Tapu Lele, so it needs a strong defensive backbone that can switch into these threats, such as Corviknight, Blissey, and Jirachi. Pokemon that can pivot to bring Zygarde-10% onto the field safely, such as Corviknight, Tapu Koko, and Mew, also make strong teammates. Pokemon such as Tapu Lele can assist in breaking down common switch-ins to Zygarde-10% such as Dauntless Shield Mew, Kommo-o, and Tapu Fini. Stealth Rock users such as Mold Breaker Heatran also help Zygarde-10% by chipping down its common switch-ins over the course of the game. Zygarde-10% also enjoys having reliable entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Corviknight or and Tapu Fini to prevent it from accumulating chip damage throughout the game.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its fantastic defensive typing and bulk, in conjunction with priority recovery and stat clearing with Haze, Prankster Toxapex is a great physical wall and setup deterrent. Its typing provides important resistances to Fire-, Fighting-, and Water-types, checking dangerous physical attackers like Cinderace, Terrakion, and Barraskewda. Toxapex is also one of the few reliable switch-ins to physical Genesect, but it must watch out for special variants. Toxapex's most significant role lies in deterring setup with Prankster Haze, which stops dangerous threats like BellyBurden Kommo-o, Cosmic Power Mew, and Quiver Dance Volcarona from making progress. It can also serve as an emergency check to threats it does not outright beat like Dragon Dance Power Construct Zygarde-10% and Swords Dance Garchomp by sacrificing itself to remove their boosts. Recover also benefits from Prankster, allowing Toxapex to switch in, sponge a hit, and heal off the damage before taking a second one. Knock Off provides utility by removing items, which can be especially useful against Choice Band users and defensive Pokemon that rely on utility items. The last move slot is more flexible; Scald threatens physical attackers that might consider staying in with a burn, Toxic Spikes help wear down offensive teams, and Toxic weakens potential sweepers. Black Sludge is the preferred item to provide extra recovery, while Rocky Helmet is an option to punish physical attackers, especially if Toxapex is the main Barraskewda switch-in. Maximum HP and Defense investment is necessary to repeatedly switch into dangerous physical attackers, while zero Speed IVs allow Toxapex to outspeed opponents in Trick Room; this is especially important to remove Marowak-Alola's Thick Club with Knock Off.</p> <p>Toxapex is best utilized on balance and bulky offense teams that want to counter a wide range of opposing setup sweepers without devoting space to an elaborate defensive core. Toxapex is a great backstop when an attacker gets forced out; Prankster Haze removes the threat of the opponent using the free turn to set up, and Prankster Recover, plus Toxapex's great bulk, makes it difficult to KO. As such, Toxapex makes a great partner to Choice item wallbreakers such as Terrakion and Azelf. These wallbreakers also appreciate Toxapex's Knock Off and Toxic Spikes, as they wear down the opposing team even faster. Toxapex can also cover for other passive defensive partners like Blissey by denying sweepers that can set up on Blissey. Due to its Ground weakness, Toxapex is unable to check Garchomp, Landorus-T, or Zygarde-10%, so a secondary physically defensive switch-in like Intimidate Corviknight or Dauntless Shield Mew is appreciated. Toxapex is also a poor switch-in to Psychic- and Electric-type attacks, but these tend to be specially-oriented and should be handled by a special wall like Jirachi instead. Since Toxapex is heavily reliant on using Recover to stay healthy, it is vulnerable to entry hazards and opposing pivots. Reliable Defog support from Corviknight and the ability to punish pivots with entry hazard support&amp;mdashwhich includes its own Toxic Spikes&amp;mdash is strongly advised. Since Toxapex does not have access to a pivot move and can often be a momentum drain, it pairs well with other defensive pivots, such as Corvikinght and RegenVest Jirachi, which can generate momentum.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Calm Mind is a great alternative over U-turn, changing Tapu Koko's role from an offensive pivot to a formidable setup sweeper. It can also run Grass Knot to 2HKO specially defensive Swampert, or OHKO physically defensive variants, though forgoing one of its STAB moves limits its power. It can run a physical Magic Guard set with Wild Charge, Brave Bird, U-turn, and Roost or Toxic; this set can beat special walls like Heatran, but is otherwise outclassed by the listed sets. Primordial Sea has a good niche in checking Fire-types, mainly Talonflame, and a perfectly accurate Thunder, while still offering decent power and revenge killing ability; however, it is unable to check other key Fire-types like Cinderace and Entei and is largely outclassed by Zapdos, which offers better bulk, higher power, and amazing coverage. Levitate is a decent alternative on Calm Mind sets, as it beats Tapu Koko's biggest check in Landorus-T, and turns other Ground-types into setup fodder. Refrigerate Hyper Voice is another niche to beat Ground-types that is able to swiftly eliminate the likes of Landorus-T and Garchomp, though Ice-type coverage sees limited use otherwise. Additionally, both lets forgo Magic Guard, making them more susceptible to being worn down.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Common Ground-types such as Landorus-T can switch into any move other than Facade and force out Tapu Koko with a Ground-type move. Specially defensive Garchomp can tank a Dazzling Gleam and KO back.</p> <p><strong>Volt Absorb</strong>: Volt Absorb users like Corviknight and Toxapex can also switch into any attack, but have to watch out for Taunt denying their recovery.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Tapu Koko crumbles to any faster Pokemon, such as Azelf, Barraskewda, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Choice Scarf Genesect, given its middling bulk. The latter two can also switch into Electric- and Fairy-type attacks, respectively. Priority users, namely Zarude and Dhelmise, threaten to OHKO Tapu Koko with Grassy Glide.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Steel-types: Ferrothorn resists Tapu Koko's dual STAB move combination and threatens to 2HKO or set up Spikes. RegenVest Jirachi can soak up any attack and bring in a revenge killer via U-turn; Heatran take little from any of Tapu Koko's attacks and threatens to trap it using Magma Storm; however, non-Regenerator Heatran has to be careful not to take too much chip as its only source of recovery is Leftovers.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With blazing speed, strong STAB move combination, access to Roost, and a useful set of resistances, Tapu Koko is one of the best offensive pivots in the tier. Its Speed tier allows it to revenge kill key threats such as Talonflame, Terrakion, and Latios. Dazzling Gleam is a good secondary STAB move that reliably hits Pokemon that resist Thunderbolt such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Kommo-o, and Zarude. Magic Guard and Roost give Tapu Koko decent longevity to offensively check threats like Talonflame and Zapdos throughout a game. Life Orb also pairs well with Magic Guard and gives Tapu Koko a free boost to make up for its mediocre attacking stats. U-turn allows it to pivot out of bad matchups such as the aforementioned Ground-types, as well as Heatran and Blissey.</p> <p>Tapu Koko easily fits on bulky offense and balance teams in need of a revenge killer or a pivot. Wallbreakers like Terrakion and Dhelmise are great offensive partners: the former capitalizes on the special walls Tapu Koko forces in, such as Heatran, and is extremely difficult to switch into; the latter covers Tapu Koko's weakness against Ground-types and turns them into setup fodder while also providing Grassy Terrain support. In return, Tapu Koko threatens their checks like Tapu Fini, Corviknight, and Kommo-o. Heatran also deserves special mention, as it is one of the best Stealth Rock setters in the tier and is able to chip down special walls like Landorus-T and Blissey. Furthermore, it lures in and poisons Zapdos, which lets Tapu Koko beat non-Weather Ball variants more reliably. Tapu Koko struggles with Ground-types in general, especially Choice Scarf Landorus-T, so it is necessary to pair it with Flying-types like your own Landorus-T and Corviknight. Wandering Spirit variants are especially helpful, as they can remove Regenerator from Swampert's and Landorus-T, eventually chipping them into KO range of Dazzling Gleam. Both Landorus-T and Corviknight also form potent VoltTurn cores with Tapu Koko and can switch into faster threats like Choice Scarf Azelf and Zarude.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With very few physically defensive walls that resist Fairy-type in the tier, and many of the relevant ones being weak to Electric, Pixilate Facade Tapu Koko excels in putting tremendous pressure onto defensive builds. Facade, when boosted by Flame Orb and Pixilate, is very strong and can 2HKO many neutral foes like Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Swampert. Volt Switch allows Tapu Koko to pivot out of unfavorable matchups like Heatran while hitting Corviknight and Toxapex super effectively; Thunderbolt allows it to actually beat the aforementioned Corviknight and Toxapex, as they can otherwise use a recovery move as Tapu Koko uses Volt Switch. Roost is mandatory to offset burn and entry hazard damage. Taunt prevents its switch-ins like Volt Absorb Corviknight from healing and pairs very well with Volt Switch to weaken foes. Work Up is usable to boost both of Tapu Koko's attacking stats, allowing it to function as a cleaner, though Facade is already strong enough to pick off weakened foes, and boosted Thunderbolt is still weak. A Jolly nature is preferred to preserve bulk; Hasty nature is also an option on Work Up variants, notably being able to 2HKO Toxapex.</p> <p>Tapu Koko fits on most balance and offense teams thanks to its top-notch Speed tier and its ability to keep opposing walls at low health. As such, it pairs well with entry hazards setters like Swampert and Heatran to chip down foes. Tapu Koko pairs well with strong attackers in general, as it is able to either wallbreak early-game or clean up late-game. Zygarde-10% is a prime partner to form a core with Tapu Koko where they both can either wallbreak or clean up; Tapu Koko can Taunt shared checks like Dauntless Shield Mew and keep them at low health, while using Volt Switch against checks like Heatran and Jirachi to bring in Zygarde-10%. Tapu Koko is frail, especially considering burn damage, so it appreciates a defensive pivot to safely bring it in. Vaporeon is remarkably a good partner as it can use Wish + Flip Turn to reliably heal Tapu Koko. A Flying-type like Landorus-T or Zapdos is also essential to alleviate Tapu Koko's glaring weakness to Ground-types; they are also helpful in checking Heatran, which is the single largest roadblock to Tapu Koko given its 4x Fairy resistance.</p> "

U-turn brings in teammates while preserving Tapu Koko to set up screens later in the game. Magic Bounce prevents entry hazards which is particularly useful for hyper offense teams; with Taunt, it is also able to shut down Mold Breaker leads like Heatran and Shuckle. Light Clay allows dual screens to last for an extra 3 turns, giving additional protection for its teammates. Maximum HP and Speed investment allow Tapu Koko to be as bulky as possible while outspeeding every Pokemon up to Talonflame to set up screens before the opponent attacks. 248 Speed EVs is also an option to move after opposing Tapu Koko, allowing it to bring in teammates safely.</p> <p>Tapu Koko is a great asset on hyper offensive teams, as dangerous sweepers like Kommo-o, Genesect, and Togekiss can take full advantage of dual screens to set up Belly Drum, Shift Gear, and Nasty Plot, respectively, and become much harder to revenge kill. However, Tapu Koko might not be able to get both screens up against common Ground-type leads like Swampert, so switch-ins like Dhelmise are necessary to prevent the opponent from freely using Earthquake. Dhelmise also provides useful priority and good wallbreaking potential. Teammates that can pressure Corviknight and Tapu Fini, like Cinderace, are essential to prevent the opponent from bringing in their Defogger once Tapu Koko is switched out.</p> "

Tapu Fini's typing and bulk allow it to serve as a blanket check to prominent physical attackers like Garchomp, Barraskewda, and Terrakion; the use of Rocky Helmet serves as a means for Tapu Fini to switch in and passively limit the amount of times they can attack successfully. Leftovers allows Tapu Fini to slightly increase its passive recovery so that it doesn't have to switch immediately versus opposing attackers. Tapu Fini also serves as one of the most effective counters to Barraskewda, as it can easily restore chip damage from Flip Turn with Regenerator while punishing Barrskewda with Rocky Helmet. Because common Stealth Rock users such as Swampert and Garchomp don't tend to carry moves that are immediately threatening to Tapu Fini, it's able to Defog Stealth Rock away consistently with the option of also removing potential Swords Dance boosts or threatening to burn with Scald.

        "description": "<p>Intimidate Corviknight is one of the most consistent checks to physical attackers in AAA. With its already high natural bulk, fantastic defensive typing, and access to reliable recovery and Intimidate, it is difficult to break through physically without strong super effective hits. Choice Band Terrakion, Zarude, and Garchomp are all dangerous physical attackers that have a difficult time breaking through Corviknight. Additionally, thanks to Intimidate, Corviknight can soft-check threats even when weakened by handing off a now-minus-one attacker to a teammate to check more easily. Corviknight is a fantastic role compressor, as it also offers entry hazard removal and slow pivoting with U-turn. It is very common for Corviknight to come in, eat a weak or resisted hit, and use U-turn as their opponent switches. Brave Bird is the obligatory STAB move and does decent damage to attackers like Kommo-o, Zarude, and Dhelmise if required. It also prevents dangerous set-up sweepers like Volcarona and Kommo-o from setting up for free. Maximum Defense investment is required to ensure Corviknight avoids several key 2HKOs, most notably from Terrakion, and minimum Speed with no IVs allows Corviknight's U-turn to usually go last, bringing in a teammate for free.</p> <p>Corviknight fits well on a wide variety of teams due to its role compression and great defensive attributes, but it especially excels on balance and bulky offense teams that can take advantage of its slow U-turn. Dangerous-but-frail breakers like Terrakion, Tapu Lele, and Barraskewda appreciate Corviknight getting them onto the field safely. While Corviknight can check a wide range of physical attackers, there are a few that it struggles with such as Talonflame and Cinderace. Partners like Primordial Sea Zapdos and Swampert are appreciated as ways to handle these threats. Additionally, even though Corviknight is an excellent Defogger, it struggles heavily to Defog against Heatran, and so it greatly appreciates teammates who reliably force it out like Primordial Sea Barraskewda and Zapdos. Tapu Koko and Zapdos are common switch-ins to Corviknight; therefore, partners like Blissey, which make a fantastic core with it that covers each others weaknesses, are good teammates. Lastly, a second physically defensive partner like Tapu Fini or Dauntless Shield Mew makes a great partner to handle the few physical attackers Corviknight cannot, such as Cinderace and Talonflame.</p> "

        "name": "Wandering Spirit Pivot",
        "description": "<p>Wandering Spirit Corviknight aims to punish opposing Pokemon that rely on their ability, especially Regenerator pivots like Swampert. For example, if Swampert uses Flip Turn on Corviknight, instead of recovering a third of its HP, it loses 16.7%, a massive difference that cripples Swampert's longevity. This also gives Corviknight Regenerator, allowing it to save a turn by not having to heal with Roost. Wandering Spirit is also great at denying Unburden users their speed boost and Triage users their priority; this makes Corviknight a great emergency check to several popular sweepers like Kommo-o and Tapu Lele. It is also effective against Magic Guard users, as it can unexpectedly force them to take Rocky Helmet chip and Life Orb recoil, and users of damage-amplification abilities like Tough Claws and Adaptability. The moveset aims to provide as much utility as possible while abusing Wandering Spirit: Roost gives recovery, Defog removes entry hazards, U-turn provides slow pivoting, and Brave Bird lets Corviknight avoid total passivity. Be careful when attacking with Corviknight, however, as it may give your opponent their ability back if they have already activated Wandering Spirit. It is also worth noting that Wandering Spirit only works on contact moves, so moves like Stone Edge will not trigger it. Maximum defensive EVs ensure it can check as many things as possible, while minimum speed IVs allow for a slow U-turn.</p> <p>Corviknight's biggest asset is frustrating and denying recovery to RegenVest pivots like Swampert, Jirachi, and Silvally-Dragon. Special Attackers such as Zapdos and Tapu Lele make fantastic partners, as they can often blow through opposing teams when their RegenVest checks are at low health. Because this set lacks Leftovers and Intimidate, it is much easier to overwhelm with powerful attacks, so it is important to either back it up with a strong defensive teammate like Dauntless Shield Mew or Kommo-o, or play aggressively enough to deny opposing breakers the chance to get in. In particular Corviknight struggles with attackers that don't mind having their ability removed temporarily like Grassy Surge Zarude or Primordial Sea Barraskewda, or are powerful enough to beat it without an ability like Choice Band Terrakion. Strong answers to these Pokemon, like Dauntless Shield Kommo-o, are highly recommended.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Corviknight, when coupled with an immunity ability, can check a wide range of dangerous special attackers in AAA, and, furthermore, use them as set-up fodder. With Volt Absorb, Corviknight becomes a fantastic switch-in to Tapu Koko and Zapdos, while Flash Fire makes it a great check to Desolate Land Heatran and Volcarona while even checking physical attackers like Cinderace and Talonflame. With access to Bulk Up and Roost, Corviknight is able to function as a fantastic late-game bulky wincon by taking advantage of the free turns it gets. U-turn still provides utility in the early-game and lets it function as a pivot before its checks are removed. The choice of Brave Bird or Iron Head generally comes down to power or sustainability; both STAB moves have no immunities, and while Flying generally has better coverage in AAA, Iron Head's consistency due to its lack of recoil is appreciated. Maximum Special Defense allows Corviknight to check special attackers as well as possible; since this Corviknight can often sweep, it does not run minimum speed, as it can sometimes get a Bulk Up off against slow breakers like Dhelmise.</p> <p>Specially defensive Corviknight is a great option for teams looking to patch up weaknesses to Tapu Koko, Zapdos, or Desolate Land Heatran. It is often found on balanced and bulkier teams as a great defensive pivot and late-game sweeper. Depending on its ability, it either needs teammates to help it beat Tapu Koko and Zapdos, like Assault Vest Swampert, or beat Fire-types, like Tapu Fini. Additionally, even if it is Flash Fire, Corviknight cannot beat Mold Breaker Heatran, so it needs teammates like Zapdos to either beat it outright or wear it down and beat it over the course of the game. This set also does not check physical attackers well nor utilize Defog, so additional team support like Tapu Fini is required to fill these roles.</p> "

Flip Turn is an especially deadly move as Barraskewda can pivot out while massively damaging non-Water-immune checks like Swampert. Barraskewda's other strong STAB moves in Liquidation and Aqua Jet mean that the opponent has to keep their Water-resistant Pokemon healthy so that their team isn't completely overwhelmed. Barraskewda's coverage moves are mostly used as insurance against Water Absorb users like Excadrill and Desolate Land users such as Heatran. Close Combat is the best coverage option due to its high Base Power and ability to hit Heatran and Ferrothorn hard.</p> <p>Barraskewda is often paired with special powerhouses like Sheer Force Tapu Lele, Psychic Surge Azelf, and specially offensive Genesect, which succeed versus Pokemon that check Barraskewda like Tapu Fini and Corviknight. The combination of their special prowess and Barraskewda's pivoting leads to deadly offensive cores. Barraskewda commonly finds itself on VoltTurn cores, synergizing well with Genesect, Landorus-T, and offensive Zapdos. Barraskewda also benefits from teammates that check Fire-types and cover its Desolate Land weakness like Terrakion and Garchomp, which can punish them by setting entry hazards. Since Barraskewda's main job as a pivot and revenge killer involves a lot of switching, it benefits from entry hazard removers and slow pivots. Defensive pivots such as Swampert and Landorus-T are able to preserve momentum and set up entry hazards, softening up foes. Other defensive Pokemon like Dauntless Shield Mew, Intimidate Corviknight, and Tapu Fini are also great partners because of their access to Defog and reliable recovery. Additionally, Magic Bounce users such as Blissey and Mew act as entry hazard deterrents with the option to run slow pivot moves such as Teleport, U-turn, and Volt Switch.</p> "

Ice Fang is another option that is weaker against Dragon-types but also hits Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Garchomp for more damage. Iron Tail over Behemoth Bash offers higher PP but has lower accuracy. Rest + Howl is an option to both threaten offensive foes and set up on passive foes, but it lacks coverage, and the lack of Sleep Talk makes Zamazenta-C very passive when asleep.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Mew comfortably sponges any attacks from Zamazenta-C and can threaten it with Will-O-Wisp or pivot into a revenge killer; Intimidate Corviknight can repeatedly switch into Zamazenta-C, even against Wild Charge, and pivot into a revenge killer; and Toxapex can eliminate Howl boosts, stall out Wild Charge, and burn it with Scald. All of them commonly run Rocky Helmet, which chips down Zamazenta-C very quickly.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos: Zapdos resists both of Zamazenta-C's STAB moves, and threatens it with a strong Thunder, which also comes with paralysis chance.

Furthermore, Rusted Shield cannot be removed, so it is a nice deterrent to Trick users like Azelf and Dhelmise. Its Speed tier also puts it above key threats like Cinderace and Terrakion, making it annoying for offensive teams to handle. Close Combat is Zamazenta-C's strongest STAB move, allowing it to revenge kill Zarude and Terrakion, while also OHKOing Heatran and Blissey. Behemoth Bash notably hits Fairy-types, namely Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Bulu. Wild Charge is its best option against Water- and Flying-types like Tapu Fini, Toxapex, and Talonflame. Howl is Zamazenta-C's only Attack-boosting move, though its bulk usually allows it to boost multiple times. After one boost, it can 2HKO Swampert and Tapu Fini and OHKO Talonflame and Cinderace. Alternatively, running RestTalk with both STAB moves gives Zamazenta-C a source of recovery while alleviating its low PP thanks to Sleep Talk; this sacrifices its ability to boost or hit Tapu Fini, however. A Jolly nature is preferred so that Cinderace and Talonflame cannot revenge kill it.</p> <p>Zamazenta-C best fits on bulkier teams in need of a Pokemon to close out games, as it can clean up after its teammates have sufficiently weakened the opposing team. Its combination of bulk, high Speed, and resistance or neutrality to most priority attacks makes it difficult for offensive teams to revenge kill reliably. It appreciates Wish and Heal Bell support on these teams, notably from Vaporeon, allowing it to come in multiple times throughout a game. To further alleviate Zamazenta-C's lack of recovery, teammates that can bring in Zamazenta-C safely are useful, such as Blissey, Jirachi, and Vaporeon; they also invite in Pokemon like Heatran, Terrakion, and Tapu Koko, all of which Zamazenta-C can force out. It also greatly appreciates entry hazards support from setters like Swampert and Garchomp, which let it rack up chip damage on switches that it forces. Furthermore, these setters can threaten Fire-types like Volcarona and Cinderace, as well as Zapdos, which force out Zamazenta-C. Lastly, it appreciates teammates that can wear down Corviknight and Dauntless Shield Mew, such as Zygarde-10% and Pixilate Tapu Koko, so that it can clean up more easily late-game.</p> "
