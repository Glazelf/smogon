Azelf's coverage moves besides Fire Blast are generally not worth using.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey: Azelf, like many other Pokemon, has trouble breaking Chansey and Blissey, as Expanding Force is a 4HKO on both of them. Psyshock can be used to improve this matchup, but it still doesn't 2HKO. This means that Azelf has to rely on Knock Off or Trick to remove their items and pivoting via U-turn to slowly weaken the two.</p> <p><strong>Zarude</strong>: Zarude is one of the most common Dark-types in the tier, meaning that it can switch in on a Expanding Force and then get a free turn. This creates a coinflip situation on whether your opponent will switch to it every time you bring out Azelf. Further, it has priority that can OHKO Azelf, which won't be able to change moves anyway.</p> <p><strong>Genesect and Heatran</strong>: Similarly to Zarude, both Genesect and Heatran take Azelf's Expanding Forces well This gives them free turns to set up or get powerful attacks off, respectively, forcing Azelf to pivot and predict well. Fire Blast greatly improves this matchup, dealing very good damage to both of them.</p> <p><strong>Terrain Users</strong>: Users of Grassy or Electric Terrain are problems for Azelf, as taking away its Psychic Terrain just about halves Azelf's damage output.</p> ",

Azelf is one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, which, paired with the probability it pivots with U-turn, is very dangerous in a momentum-reliant tier like AAA. Equipped with a Choice Scarf, Azelf is able to outspeed Adamant Unburden-boosted Kommo-o, as well as outspeeding naturally fast Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Talonflame and Barraskewda. This makes it a very reliable revenge killer, but Choice Specs is another option to better Azelf as a fast special wallbreaker. Azelf's ability Psychic Surge makes it a blanket check to many Triage and standard priority users, particularly Togekiss and Tapu Bulu. A Hasty nature takes advantage of Azelf's great speed Speed tier without sacrificing damage from U-turn or Knock Off.</p> <p>Azelf can fit on most teams because of its ability to check Triage and standard priority users while still being an offensive threat. Its less-than-ideal bulk means it appreciates slow pivots from a Pokemon like Swampert or Corviknight to get in safely. Azelf is vulnerable to entry hazards and being slowly worn down, as it lacks recovery as well. It's also weak to Pokemon that can double switch into Expanding Force and force a switch by threatening a KO back, such as Heatran. This, coupled with its tendency to force in special walls, means it pairs very well with Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Kommo-o, which can threaten the Steel- and Dark-types Azelf struggles to break through.</p> "

U-turn can be run over Swords Dance, or more rarely Flare Blitz, to generate momentum even against teams that have solid answers to it, which is always valuable. Talonflame can also conceivably drop Flare Blitz for Will-O-Wisp to cripple some of its switch-ins like Swampert, but the increased coverage is usually preferred.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Primordial Sea Electric-types: Primordial Sea Zapdos and Tapu Koko both have the bulk and typing to switch into Talonflame and force it out with their Electric-type attacks. They also have pivoting and reliable recovery to consistently annoy Talonflame over the course of the match.</p> <p><strong>Flash Fire Corviknight: Talonflame can't hit Corviknight neutrally, and Corviknight can do more than 50% to Talonflame with Brave Bird or use U-turn to bring in a faster threat safely.</p> <p><strong>Unaware</strong>: Unaware Mandibuzz and Mew comfortably avoid being 2HKOed and ignore Swords Dance boosts. However, in a longer game, Talonflame can feasibly stall them out of recovery PP, especially if they lack the ability to punish Talonflame themselves with Foul Play or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Toxapex: Similarly to the Unaware checks above, Toxapex can prevent Talonflame from sweeping as long as it has PP for Recover; additionally, it can remove Talonflame’s Life Orb with Knock Off, which reduces its power considerably. It can also be stalled out of recovery in a longer game, however.</p> <p><strong>Tapu Fini</strong>: Tapu Fini is already found on many teams and can help check Talonflame, but it cannot beat Talonflame by itself.

        "description": "<p>Talonflame has found a welcoming home in Generation 8 Almost Any Ability, being an attacker with good power and coverage that is hard to wear down. In a metagame that has few viable Rock-types, Talonflame's STAB moves provide fantastic coverage, with the only common resistant foes being Primordial Sea Zapdos or Tapu Koko and Flash Fire Corviknight. Thanks to its high Base Power moves and Life Orb, which have their recoil negated by Magic Guard, Talonflame hits surprisingly hard despite having a low Attack stat. For reference, fully physically defensive Swampert cannot safely switch into Talonflame if it is below 80% health, as it risks getting 2HKOed by Brave Bird. Talonflame possesses a great Speed tier for AAA, leaving it only outspeed by Barraskewda, Tapu Koko, and the rare Zamazenta-C. Additionally, it resists every common Triage move and Grassy Glide, making it difficult to revenge kill with priority. Swords Dance amplifies Talonflame's offensive presence, and it can often find time to set up safely against either offensive threats it forces out, like Volcarona and Zarude, or defensive stalwarts that are unable to KO it back like Corviknight and most Mew. Its power, access to setup, and longevity make it particularly effective at breaking down bulkier teams. Talonflame does really need to run maximum Attack and Speed with Jolly to maximize its offensive capabilities.</p> <p>Talonflame fits well on bulky offense or balance teams that want offensive pressure without having to provide much support. Since it is immune to all entry hazards, Talonflame doesn't require hazard control, and Magic Guard means it can't be worn down by stray Toxics or Rocky Helmets (although it does fear paralysis). Since its bulk is not fantastic, it does appreciate slow pivots like Swampert and Corviknight to bring it in safely; in exchange, it forces out foes like Cinderace or Volcarona that may have tried to come in on them. There are some common switch-ins that frustrate Talonflame, however; Primordial Sea Zapdos in particular can't be hit neutrally and forces it out, so teammates that can handle Zapdos like RegenVest Swampert, Blissey, and Silvally-Dragon are always appreciated. Additionally, while Talonflame is fast, most Choice Scarf users Choice Scarf users and a few faster threats—Tapu Koko and Barraskewda—can revenge kill it reliably. Good revenge killers or solid switch-ins to those are strongly advised; Choice Scarf Azelf is especially notable as a great revenge killer that lets Talonflame in often with U-turn.</p> "

With Choice Band and a Terrain-boosted Grassy Glide, Zarude can force out the majority of relevant wallbreakers, such as Tapu Koko and Azelf, as they risk getting OHKOed. U-turn capitalizes on the switches Zarude forces, bringing in offensive partners like Heatran and Blacephalon. Power Whip is the strongest STAB move available, OHKOing or 2HKOing common defensive pivots like Swampert, Tapu Fini, Zapdos, and Toxapex. Darkest Lariat is a spammable STAB move that also bypasses Dauntless Shield boosts, scoring 2HKOs on Heatran, Mew, and Moltres. However, Close Combat is a strong alternative over either Power Whip or Darkest Lariat, allowing it to break through specific checks like Ferrothorn and Incineroar. A Jolly nature puts it above Zapdos and Garchomp, among others, that it can 2HKO on the switch. However, this is not essential; using an Adamant nature instead boosts Zarude's already strong priority move, notably giving a better chance to OHKO Tapu Koko.</p> <p>Zarude provides valuable utility including priority, Terrain control, and passive recovery, making it a great fit on balance and bulky offense teams. As Zarude cannot switch into most attackers, a strong defensive core often helps bring it in safely. Zarude also handily beats Swampert and Tapu Fini, making it a great partner for a multitude of wallbreakers, such as Heatran, Blacephalon, Zapdos, and Tapu Koko. In return, Zarude gives them good switch-in opportunities by using U-turn on the Steel-types it invites in, mainly Corviknight and Cobalion. Zarude appreciates any teammates that can set entry hazards, chipping down foes like Tapu Koko, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight into OHKO or 2HKO range. Teammates carrying Rocky Helmet such as Corviknight and Swampert also provide chip damage, and they can notably punish offensive pivots freely clicking U-turn on Zarude; Wandering Spirit Corviknight is especially valuable, as it can nullify opposing Regenerator on a U-turn. Lastly, teammates running Knock Off are useful to remove opposing Rocky Helmet and Heavy-Duty Boots, respectively allowing Zarude to attack more freely and better chip walls—especially Flying-types—in combination with hazards.</p> "
