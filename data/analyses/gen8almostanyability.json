    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Psyshock can be used to deal more damage to Assault Vest Swampert, Chansey, and Blissey. Azelf's coverage moves besides Fire Blast are generally not worth using.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey: Azelf, like many other Pokemon, has trouble breaking Chansey and Blissey, as Expanding Force is a 4HKO on both of them. Psyshock can be used to improve this matchup, but it still doesn't 2HKO. This means that Azelf has to rely on Knock Off or Trick to remove their items and pivoting via U-turn to slowly weaken the two.</p> <p><strong>Zarude</strong>: Zarude is one of the most common Dark-types in the tier, meaning that it can switch in on a Expanding Force and then get a free turn. This creates a coinflip situation on whether your opponent will switch to it every time you bring out Azelf. Further, it has priority that can OHKO Azelf, which won't be able to change moves anyway.</p> <p><strong>Genesect and Heatran</strong>: Similarly to Zarude, both Genesect and Heatran take Azelf's Expanding Forces well This gives them free turns to set up or get powerful attacks off, respectively, forcing Azelf to pivot and predict well. Fire Blast greatly improves this matchup, dealing very good damage to both of them.</p> <p><strong>Terrain Users</strong>: Users of Grassy or Electric Terrain are problems for Azelf, as taking away its Psychic Terrain just about halves Azelf's damage output.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Azelf has a unique role in AAA as a fast Expanding Force user with both pivoting in U-turn and utility moves such as Trick and Knock Off, which help punish defensive switch-ins like Corviknight and Blissey. Azelf is one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, which, paired with the probability it pivots with U-turn, is very dangerous in a momentum-reliant tier like AAA. Equipped with a Choice Scarf, Azelf is able to outspeed Adamant Unburden-boosted Kommo-o, as well as outspeeding naturally fast Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Talonflame and Barraskewda. This makes it a very reliable revenge killer, but Choice Specs is another option to better Azelf as a fast special wallbreaker. Azelf's ability Psychic Surge makes it a blanket check to many Triage and standard priority users, particularly Togekiss and Tapu Bulu. A Hasty nature takes advantage of Azelf's great speed Speed tier without sacrificing damage from U-turn or Knock Off.</p> <p>Azelf can fit on most teams because of its ability to check Triage and standard priority users while still being an offensive threat. Its less-than-ideal bulk means it appreciates slow pivots from a Pokemon like Swampert or Corviknight to get in safely. Azelf is vulnerable to entry hazards and being slowly worn down, as it lacks recovery as well. It's also weak to Pokemon that can double switch into Expanding Force and force a switch by threatening a KO back, such as Heatran. This, coupled with its tendency to force in special walls, means it pairs very well with Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Kommo-o, which can threaten the Steel- and Dark-types Azelf struggles to break through.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Adamant Tough Claws is rarely run, as Zarude loses priority on Grassy Glide, leaving it unable to revenge kill any attacker, as well as losing passive recovery and Terrain control. On the other hand, however, it provides a decent power boost on all other moves and makes Darkest Lariat very spammable: it now 2HKOes non-Intimidate Corviknight, Zapdos, and Heatran, easing prediction and pivoting.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Corviknight, especially Intimidate variants, takes minimal damage from Zarude; Cobalion outspeeds and forces out Zarude while recovering any chip damage via Regenerator; and other Steel-types like Ferrothorn require noticeable chip damage for non-Close Combat Zarude to break through them.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Resisting Grassy Glide, common Flying-types like Zapdos, Togekiss, and Mandibuzz can either outspeed and force out Zarude or completely wall it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Zarude often finds itself unable to threaten common fast pivots with Grassy Glide, such as Choice Scarf Genesect and Talonflame. Both carry super effective moves to hit Zarude in return. Additionally, Zarude is forced out by U-turn users given its glaring 4x Bug weakness, especially Azelf, which replaces its Grassy Terrain with Psychic Terrain: this often gives free momentum to offensive pivots, as they can freely use U-turn without taking Grassy Glide.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Zarude is a formidable offensive pivot and doubles as one of the strongest priority users in the metagame. With Choice Band and a Terrain-boosted Grassy Glide, Zarude can force out the majority of relevant wallbreakers, such as Tapu Koko and Azelf, as they risk getting OHKOed. U-turn capitalizes on the switches Zarude forces, bringing in offensive partners like Heatran and Blacephalon. Power Whip is the strongest STAB move available, OHKOing or 2HKOing common defensive pivots like Swampert, Tapu Fini, Zapdos, and Toxapex. Darkest Lariat is a spammable STAB move that also bypasses Dauntless Shield boosts, scoring 2HKOs on Heatran, Mew, and Moltres. However, Close Combat is a strong alternative over either Power Whip or Darkest Lariat, allowing it to break through specific checks like Ferrothorn and Incineroar. A Jolly nature puts it above Zapdos and Garchomp, among others, that it can 2HKO on the switch. However, this is not essential; using an Adamant nature instead boosts Zarude's already strong priority move, notably giving a better chance to OHKO Tapu Koko.</p> <p>Zarude provides valuable utility including priority, Terrain control, and passive recovery, making it a great fit on balance and bulky offense teams. As Zarude cannot switch into most attackers, a strong defensive core often helps bring it in safely. Zarude also handily beats Swampert and Tapu Fini, making it a great partner for a multitude of wallbreakers, such as Heatran, Blacephalon, Zapdos, and Tapu Koko. In return, Zarude gives them good switch-in opportunities by using U-turn on the Steel-types it invites in, mainly Corviknight and Cobalion. Zarude appreciates any teammates that can set entry hazards, chipping down foes like Tapu Koko, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight into OHKO or 2HKO range. Teammates carrying Rocky Helmet such as Corviknight and Swampert also provide chip damage, and they can notably punish offensive pivots freely clicking U-turn on Zarude; Wandering Spirit Corviknight is especially valuable, as it can nullify opposing Regenerator on a U-turn. Lastly, teammates running Knock Off are useful to remove opposing Rocky Helmet and Heavy-Duty Boots, respectively allowing Zarude to attack more freely and better chip walls—especially Flying-types—in combination with hazards.</p> "
