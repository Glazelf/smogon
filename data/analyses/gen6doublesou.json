  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gengar makes a name for itself as a strong disruption pick in DOU. Mega Gengar is notable for being the better half of the two viable Shadow Tag Pokemon in the metagame and has a unique assortment of support and disruption moves such as Taunt and Will-O-Wisp that it can use in conjunction with its trapping ability and high Speed, which is enough to outrun the whole unboosted metagame except for Deoxys-A and Mega Aerodactyl; these qualities make it adept at picking off or neutering key threats for its teammates' benefit. Its regular forme is also viable, adept at using a nifty array of resistances and immunities to support teammates with Icy Wind and the aforementioned Taunt and Will-O-Wisp, making it a good check to notable threats such as Mega Kangaskhan and Landorus-T. Both formes are also no slouches offensively, with Mega Gengar even boasting a very high base 170 Special Attack, and their Ghost STAB makes them useful against most Trick Room setters. Both Gengar formes are also frail, however, making them unable to switch in on most hits effectively and being easily KOed by any strong or super effective attack; in particular, Gengar needs a Focus Sash to be actually able to take one hit minimum. Gengar's frailness also makes it easily picked off when at the wrong end of speed control.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Disable prevents foes from using the move they last used, possibly allowing Gengar and its teammate a free turn and generally preventing a foe from attacking with their first attacking option; in tandem with an Encore user such as Whimsicott, Disable Mega Gengar can be frustrating to face due to the possibility of being locked into a Disabled move. Similarly, in conjunction with Substitute, Disable can turn Mega Gengar into a pain to deal with. Focus Blast, despite its terrible accuracy, can serve as a serviceable attack to nab the quick KO on the likes of Mega Kangaskhan, Hydreigon, and Heatran. Perish Song allows Mega Gengar to pressure foes by limiting the turns they can stay on the field and works well with Mega Gengar's ability to deny switching. Skill Swap can also be nifty for giving partners such as Heatran Levitate and passing Mega Gengar's Shadow Tag to a partner.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Dark-types such as Hoopa-U, Hydreigon, and Darkrai can generally take out either Gengar forme with their super effective STAB moves, though the regular forme usually holds a Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Ghost-types can't be trapped with Shadow Tag. Aegislash can also generally take one attack and OHKO back with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Landorus can take out Mega Gengar with ease using their STAB moves. The regular Gengar forme is immune to Ground-type attacks due to Levitate, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Deoxys-A can simply outrun and take out Mega Gengar through its paltry defenses. Kingdra and Ludicolo can be outrun as well but only under rain. Regular Gengar has lower Speed and gets outrun by a few more threats, albeit niche, such as Weavile, Darkrai, and Mega Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks: Priority attacks bypass Gengar's high Speed entirely and simply punch through its low defenses. Talonflame in particular can generally get a KO against a healthy Gengar with its priority Brave Bird. Sucker Punches from the likes of Bisharp and Mega Kangaskhan also hurt Gengar, but they can be played around and neutered with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Gengar relies on its Speed to actually be effective at disrupting foes; without it, it loses effectiveness and becomes prone to getting easily picked off. Tailwind from the likes of Talonflame and Latios can take away Gengar's Speed advantage, while Trick Room from setters such as Cresselia and Hoopa-U can turn the tables against it entirely. Thunder Wave from threats such as Thundurus can take away Mega Gengar's Speed advantage for the duration of a match.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Both Sludge Bomb and Shadow Ball are simply STAB attacks, the former more powerful and able deal a significant amount of damage to non-resisted targets and the latter boasting better neutral and super effective coverage, capable of hitting Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Aegislash and Cresselia super effectively. Will-O-Wisp can neuter physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Landorus-T, while Taunt can stop foes from setting up or supporting with moves such as Trick Room, Tailwind, or Follow Me; in conjunction with Shadow Tag, Mega Gengar can also render certain foes into unswitchable liabilities with either move. Substitute can also be useful to shield Mega Gengar from status moves such as Thunder Wave and strong attacks. These three options can also be used to play around Sucker Punch, with Will-O-Wisp even neutering would-be threats. Protect lets Mega Gengar shield itself from attacks while a partner takes out a threat, stalls field conditions such as Trick Room, and punishes double-targeting.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Mega Gengar go as fast as possbile while still having high damage output. Pre-Mega Evolution, the EV investment lets Gengar Speed tie with threats such as Latios and Mega Diancie.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Gengar should generally aim to make most use of its trapping ability by using it to deny switching, pressuring foes. Mega Gengar's trapping is particularly effective from early- to mid-game, when it can trap and weaken or KO specific foes so that a teammate has an easier time doing its job due to having one less check; for example, Belly Drum Azumarill can smash through a team with ease once Amoonguss is sufficiently weakened or removed through Mega Gengar's ability to guarantee damage. Mega Gengar can also work late-game, when it can clean up opposing teams with its high Speed and excellent Special Attack, but one needs to make sure any faster threats or those with powerful priority have already been removed.</p> <p>Generally speaking, Mega Gengar works well as a lead thanks to its nifty immunity to Fake Out and high Speed; leading Mega Gengar also lets it Mega Evolve quickly, which it should do as soon as possible in order to fully take advantage of its ability. When against certain foes, using Mega Gengar's disruption move can work wonders, as it turns them into liabilities without any chance of escape; for example, burning a Mega Kangaskhan can leave it a liability on the field due to being neutered and unable to switch out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Partners that rely on setting up such as Belly Drum Azumarill and Calm Mind Cresselia appreciate Mega Gengar's trapping abilities, as it can help remove key threats, making smashing through the opposing team easier. Pokemon that can take out Dark-types with ease also serve as good teammates; Fairy-types such as Azumarill and Sylveon and Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion all can take out most Dark-types in the metagame such as Hydreigon and Scrafty. Wide Guard support from the likes of Conkeldurr can be nifty as well, as it can block Landorus-T's Earthquake. Quick Guard from partners such as Scrafty and Keldeo is also appreciated for blocking any strong priority attack, such as Sucker Punch and Brave Bird from Talonflame. Talonflame checks are appreciated as well, as it can simply blast through Mega Gengar's paper-thin defenses while bypassing its Speed with strong priority; the likes of Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Rotom-W all work well for the job. Intimidate from the likes of Scrafty and Landorus-T also work as well because, aside from backing up Mega Gengar's paltry Defense, it can work well in conjunction with Shadow Tag by leaving weakened physical attackers unable to switch out.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sludge Bomb is Gengar's most powerful STAB move and its main attacking move on this set. It has a decent chance to poison the foe, which essentially gives it a chance to break through Focus Sash. Shadow Ball can be used in the second slot to prevent Gengar from being walled by Steel-types. While a set with dual STAB moves can be used, Icy Wind is an option to provide speed control on some teams; sitting at an impressive base 110 Speed, it can outspeed and lower the Speed of other threats that may be initially faster than Gengar's ally. When using only one STAB move, you should consider what coverage your team needs most when debating which one to use. Shadow Ball should not be used when the rest of your team is vulnerable to Dark-types, for instance. Will-O-Wisp makes Gengar a rather reliable Mega Kangaskhan check by allowing it to avoid Sucker Punch and burning it in the same turn. For the fourth slot, Taunt is the best choice, as it allows Gengar to hinder teams that rely on Trick Room or Tailwind while also halting other shenanigans that may hinder the offensive potency of rest of your team, such as an opposing Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp. It also allows Gengar to slow down opposing setup sweepers such as Azumarill and Calm Mind Cresselia.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Focus Sash helps compensate for Gengar's frailty and increases its overall staying power. Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment allows Gengar to hit as hard and fast as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When against Mega Kangaskhan, you shouldn't try to attack it because of the threat of Parental Bond Sucker Punch. Therefore, Will-O-Wisp is the go-to play against Mega Kangaskhan. Gengar shouldn't be directly switched in very often in order to keep its Focus Sash intact, but it can still switch in on Choice-locked Landorus-T's Earthquake or Mega Kangaskhan very easily. Keep in mind that non-Mega Gengar's main purpose is to perform an offensive support role, so you should try to support the offensive powerhouses of your teams with Icy Wind and Will-O-Wisp rather than solely attacking with Gengar. Be wary of using Icy Wind when facing Bisharp, as it will gain a free Attack boost from Defiant and can safely switch in thanks to its resistance or immunity to both of Gengar's STAB moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Both Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y greatly appreciate Icy Wind support to outspeed most of the speedy threats that would otherwise threaten them to a large degree, such as offensive Thundurus, Keldeo, Terrakion, and Latios. Hydreigon not only takes advantage of Gengar's use of speed control but is also able to switch into Psychic-, Ghost-, and Dark-type attacks for Gengar. As Gengar is typically crippled by Thunder Wave and Taunt, Quick Guard users such as Keldeo and Terrakion can prevent Prankster Taunt and Thunder Wave from the likes of Thundurus and Klefki from hitting Gengar. Fighting-types such as these two can also threaten Tyranitar, which breaks Gengar's Focus Sash with Sand Stream. Gengar works well with Fighting-types such as Keldeo or Conkeldurr due to its ability to beat Fairy-, Ghost-, and Psychic-types. Hydreigon, Latios, and other Dragon-types also appreciate Gengar's ability to cripple opposing physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp. Latios in particular benefits from Gengar being able to turn Mega Kangaskhan into dead weight.</p> "

  "Raikou": {
    "overview": "<p>Raikou offers very little over other, more usable Electric-types in Doubles OU such as Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Zapdos; it doesn't have the nifty typing of Rotom-W, can't parallel both the offensive and supportive potential of Thundurus, and lacks access to Tailwind unlike Zapdos. Raikou's only real niche in the metagame is its neat combination of typing, Speed, and bulk; sporting a high base 115 Speed, enough to outrun a major chunk of the metagame, along with solid HP and Special Defense, Raikou makes for a serviceable Electric-type pick that, unlike Zapdos and Thundurus, doesn't have the Ice- and Rock-type weaknesses that their Flying typing brings and has the Speed that Rotom-W and bulky Thundurus cannot boast having. Raikou is also one of the only three relevant Electric-types in the metagame that actually resist Electric-type attacks, the other two being Rotom-H and Raichu, with Raikou having the best combination of Speed and bulk; the typing lets it function as a decent check to opposing Electric-types such as Thundurus and Zapdos. In addition, Raikou also has access to nifty support moves in Snarl and Thunder Wave, the former being useful for weakening the blows of opposing special attackers and the latter letting it provide speed control support to teammates.</p> <p>Still, its Defense is paltry, which leaves it easily whittled down by common physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Diancie, and its lack of an immunity to Ground, unlike other Electric-types in the metagame, leaves it prone to getting taken down by an Earthquake from the very common Landorus-T.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Assault Vest can be nifty for letting Raikou function as a fast sponge for special attacks, but the lack of Protect can prove to be unappealing. Raikou also has access to nifty coverage moves in Shadow Ball, good for Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Aegislash and Latios; Extrasensory, useful to hit Fighting- and Poison-types such as Terrakion and Amoonguss hard; Aura Sphere, which significantly damages Mega Kangaskhan and Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn; and, for sun teams, Weather Ball. However, it is forced to run Rash when running the latter two due to them being event moves, compromising its special bulk and leaving it outrun by common threats Keldeo, Mega Diancie, and Latios. Substitute can be used to soak up a hit for Raikou and let it avoid status from the likes of Amoonguss and Rotom-W. Leftovers can be a viable option over Sitrus Berry on the main set for lasting gradual recovery, and it works well with the aforementioned Substitute to heal back the damage from setting one.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Dragon-types such as Latios and Hydreigon can easily shrug off Raikou's attacks and hit back hard with Draco Meteor or their respective secondary STAB moves, but they have to watch out for Hidden Power Ice, Thunder Wave, and Snarl.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Ferrothorn don't care about Raikou at all and can simply take advantage of its presence, with the former also able to redirect and sponge Raikou's blows.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon</strong>: While they have to be wary of Hidden Power Ice, Ground-types such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Rhyperior are immune to Raikou's STAB moves and can easily KO back with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room: Trick Room can turn the tables against Raikou's Thunder Wave shenanigans and high Speed. Cresselia can easily take anything Raikou can do against it and set Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Defiant, Competitive, and Contrary: Raikou has to watch out for using Snarl if the opponent has a Bisharp or the rare Milotic waiting in the back, as they can easily take advantage of the drop from Snarl and instead turn it into a boost with Defiant or Competitive, respectively. Raikou also has to take care of using Snarl against Serperior, as it can take advantage of it with Contrary.</p> <p><strong>Lighting Rod: Lightning Rod from the likes of Rhydon can redirect Raikou's Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave, limiting its effectiveness.</p> ",

Snarl lets Raikou support its teammates by weakening special attacks, letting them take on opposing special attackers more easily. Thunder Wave lets Raikou provide speed control by paralyzing foes, allowing teammates to outrun foes they normally wouldn't be able to. Protect shields Raikou from damage while also letting it stall out field conditions and allowing it to safely stay in on the field while a partner takes out a threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP provides Raikou with as much bulk as possible, and 232 Speed EVs with a Timid nature let it outrun a significant portion of the metagame, getting the jump on Thundurus and Mega Lucario. The spare EVs are invested into Special Attack in order to provide a slight raise to power. Sitrus Berry provides Raikou with burst recovery, giving it a boost to longevity.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Raikou should only be picked for a team when its combination of high Speed, bulk, and lack of weakness to Rock and Ice is desired, as otherwise it's outclassed by other Electric-types such as Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Zapdos. Raikou has an atypical high Speed for a supporting Pokemon, letting it perform well the double duty of providing usual support and getting clean hits on faster threats in the metagame such as Keldeo and Mega Diancie. Raikou functions well as a bulky switch-in that covers for its frailer teammates; in particular, it works well against opposing Flying- and Electric-types such as Talonflame and Thundurus, as it can switch on their STAB moves moves with ease while also being able to deal significant damage back. Against opposing special attackers, it can be a good idea for Raikou to use Snarl in order to weaken their blows, making them easier to manage for its team; it has to be cautious when the opponent has a Bisharp, though, as it can punish Snarl by taking advantage of the Special Attack drop with Defiant. As needed, Raikou should use Thunder Wave against faster foes to slow them down for teammates to take advantage of and KO later in the match.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Any Pokemon that appreciate Talonflame being dealt with make for good partners; specifically, Grass- and Fighting-types such as Venusaur, Keldeo, and Blaziken all work more freely once Talonflame is taken out. Teammates that can take out Grass-, Dragon-, and Ground-types, threats that wall Raikou, make for good partners as well; Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran can take out opposing Grass-types, Fairies such as Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon can easily dispatch Dragons, and Water-types such as Keldeo and Suicune as well as Kyurem-B can easily deal with Landorus-T. Support through Intimidate or burns from the likes of Gyarados, Landorus-T, and Gengar are is appreciated as well in order to back up Raikou's lack of physical bulk.

Hidden Power Ice provides Raikou with nifty coverage against Landorus-T and Grass-types such as Venusaur and Breloom, though Amoonguss still walls it handily. Snarl lets Raikous provide useful utility by weakening opposing special attackers at a situational basis, while Thunder Wave allows Raikou to support its team by slowing foes down; picking between the two mostly boils down to team needs and preference. Another alternative is Volt Switch, which lets Raikou deal some damage while also letting it switch out, letting it help with positioning and controlling momentum. Protect is useful for defending Raikou from damage and getting field positioning.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Full Speed and Special Attack investment maximizes Raikou's offensive potential, letting it deal as much damage as possible and outrun fast threats such as Thundurus, Mega Diancie, and the less relevant Mega Lucario and Serperior. Shuca Berry allows Raikou to stomach an Earthquake from Choice Scarf Landorus-T and hit back with Hidden Power Ice, though it's an unfavorable roll and thus needs chip damage to secure a KO. Alternatively, Life Orb provides a noticeable boost in damage output, letting Raikou secure crucial OHKOs, such as Hidden Power Ice on Landorus-T and Thunderbolt on Azumarill and Keldeo, and turning it into a more threatening attacker.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Before picking Raikou for a team, one should make sure to consider if the team would do better without the Flying typing's weaknesses; else, Thundurus is just better due to its higher Special Attack stat. Using Raikou offensively is fairly straightforward; make sure to take advantage of its Speed, as Raikou outruns a significant portion of the metagame, including the key base 110 Speed tier. Raikou is best switched in on Flying- and Electric-type attacks from the likes of Thundurus and Talonflame because it can stomach their attacks and deal with them handily. Use Raikou's utility moves as needed. Against opposing special attackers, use Snarl as necessary; however, watch out for Bisharp, as it can easily take advantage of the Special Attack drop with Defiant. When the opponent has the Speed advantage, paralyzing foes with Thunder Wave can even the odds and give teammates a chance to beat threats they ordinarily wouldn't be able to.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Any Pokemon that want Flying- and Electric-types dealt with like Raikou's presence; Grass-, Water-, and Flying-types like Venusaur, Keldeo, and Talonflame all appreciate having said threats gone.

Teammates with Intimidate or the ability to burn foes are great as well, as they can shore up Raikou's physical frailty; Landorus-T and Gyarados can back up Raikou with their Intimidate, and Gengar can neuter opposing physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp. Wide Guard support from the likes of Aegislash is also appreciated in order to block Earthquake from Choice Scarf Landorus-T.</p> "

  "Entei": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting good overall stats, Entei is a solid choice that can take a few hits and maintain good offensive pressure. Entei is a great attacker that makes itself worthwhile with its respectable bulk and solid offensive movepool; specifically, Sacred Fire, Entei's signature move, has a solid 100 Base Power and a 50% chance to burn, deterring physical attackers from switching in. Entei also works as a good sun counter, being able to OHKO both Mega Charizard Y and Venusaur while taking little damage from their attacks. Adding to that, when holding Safety Goggles, Entei is immune to Sleep Powder and can get the KO on Venusaur. However, it loses to threats most other Fire-types would lose to as well. Landorus-T is a cold stop to Entei, although switching in on Sacred Fire is risky for it. Entei also can't touch Heatran or Mega Diancie, while they hit it hard with Earth Power and Diamond Storm, respectively. While Entei has no spread moves to bypass redirectors, besides the suboptimal Snarl, Sacred Fire and Stone Edge allow it to take on the three most common redirectors, namely Jirachi, Amoonguss, and Togekiss. With Safety Goggles, Entei can ignore Amoonguss completely. Be wary, though, as Entei has difficulties switching into attacks it doesn't resist. Lastly, Entei is sadly often outclassed by other Pokemon because of its average stats and movepool, as it faces competition from Talonflame as a strong physical attacker and from Heatran as a Substitute attacker.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shuca Berry can be used to eat an Earthquake from Landorus-T and try to get a burn with Sacred Fire. Sitrus Berry can also be used for more immediate longevity. Life Orb is an option for extra power. Other moves can be useful too, such as Iron Head, which can be used to catch Mega Diancie on the switch, and Snarl, which allows Entei to hit through Substitutes and drop the foe's Special Attack, making it a significant debuffer. Substitute can be used to make Entei a solid cleaner, allowing it to fish for burns on threats that would KO it. When using Substitute, Leftovers should be used for the passive healing. A set using Psych Up can be paired with a Belly Drum Azumarill for the potential of an extremely threatening +6 Attack Entei with strong priority. However, the set is extremely niche and requires a lot of setup.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Water-types such as Rotom-W, Suicune, and Keldeo are a big pain for Entei, as it can't hit them reliably with its STAB attack and has no coverage moves for them.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Most Dragon-types such as Latios and Hydreigon can take a Fire-type STAB attack, but they will get chunked by Entei's coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Rock-types pose a big threat to Entei; even though Terrakion and Mega Diancie don't want to come into a Sacred Fire and risk the burn, they can outspeed Entei and do lots of damage to with their Rock-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-types such as the Landorus formes are a problem as well, as they can OHKO Entei with Earthquake or Earth Power. However, they still risk getting burned by Sacred Fire if they switch in or are outsped.</p> <p><strong>Heatran: Heatran is a pain because of Flash Fire, which stops Entei from using its STAB attack and forces it into using Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Due to Entei being a physical attacker, Intimidate reduces its offensive potential. Notable Intimidate users include Landorus-T, Scrafty, and Gyarados.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: While Entei thrives in sun due to being a Fire-type, rain is extremely detrimental for it, as it will weaken Sacred Fire significantly; additionally, most Pokemon typically found on rain teams such as Politoed, Ludicolo, and Kingdra have an edge over Fire-types, making rain an even more difficult matchup for Entei.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: While Entei has decent bulk, its Speed tier is okay at best and it can't take a lot of hits reliably.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sacred Fire is Entei's go-to attacking move and has a chance to cripple the target with a burn. Stone Edge is used to hit Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame primarily. The third moveslot is for Extreme Speed, which allows Entei to become a strong late-game cleaner, because its +2 priority allows it to outspeed other priority users, such as Talonflame and Bisharp. Protect is a staple move in Doubles. It is used to stall out field conditions, allowing Entei to defend itself while its partner deals with a threat and to scout for the opponent's moves, among many other uses.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread maximizes Entei's Attack and Speed. Adamant is used to obtain maximum power, while Jolly allows it to Speed tie with fully invested base 100 Speed Pokemon, such as Mega Kangaskhan. However, keep in mind that a Jolly nature is illegal when using Extreme Speed. Unfortunately, Flash Fire isn't released, so Pressure has to be used. Safety Goggles is chosen as the item to allow Entei to ignore the effects of powder moves, such as Spore, Sleep Powder, and Rage Powder. This allows Entei to check typical users of such moves, such as Breloom, Amoonguss, and Venusaur.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Entei is good at specific endeavors, such as burning Mega Kangaskhan and removing Mega Charizard Y. Entei is best used in the early-game, when it can spam Sacred Fire and fish for burns. Over the course of the game, the burn damage will stack up, which helps Entei KO the foe later in the game. Sacred Fire's massive burn chance can also help Entei get past Focus Sash users like Bisharp and Weavile. Entei can also come into a predicted Spore or Sleep Powder, and considering powder users are generally Grass- and Bug-types, it can immediately threaten the user.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entei is a strong sun counter, so Pokemon that have trouble dealing with that archetype, such as Kyurem-B, can make for great partners. Entei is also great at removing Grass-types from the field. Water-types such as Keldeo and Suicune can take advange of that and further support Entei with their moves, as together they have strong offensive synergy. Entei can't reliably deal with Heatran and Ground-types, so Pokemon that can deal with those threats are appreciated; again, Water-types such as Suicune and Keldeo are good at this. Wide Guard users such as Aegislash are appreciated, as they can stop Earthquake, Rock Slide, or Muddy Water from hitting Entei. Entei has a lot of trouble with Water-types because it has no meaningful way of damaging them; therefore, Grass- and Electric-types that can beat Water-types make for great partners. Thundurus and Amoonguss are good examples; the former provides speed control with Thunder Wave, hits hard with Thunderbolt, and can also beat Mega Diancie with Flash Cannon, while the latter provides redirection with Rage Powder and boasts the ability to put threats to sleep with Spore.</p> "

Suicune is a great defensive backbone on most teams thanks to its ability to switch in on almost any neutral attack. However, it is weak to one of the most common offensive types, Electric, and its base 90 Special Attack makes it damage output quite underwhelming.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Suicune can also run a more offensive set with an EV spread of 28 HP / 252 SpA / 228 Spe. This spread will outspeed Jolly Breloom and deal as much damage as possible, with some investment in HP as well to grant it some staying power. This set functions well with Sitrus Berry, Life Orb, or other items that boost Water-type attacks. However, this set isn't as effective because Suicune simply doesn't have the offensive stats to be threatening. More times than not, you're better off using a more powerful Water-type such as Keldeo. Mirror Coat can be used in the fourth slot instead of Snarl or Protect, enabling Suicune to surprise foes such as Rotom-W and Charizard-Y. Suicune also has access to Calm Mind and Substitute, giving it the possibility of being a powerful setup sweeper; however, setting up is typically too time consuming, and it would also be better to use a stronger offensive Water-type. Icy Wind can be run for additional speed control, but there usually isn't room for it. Roar is another option to remove setup sweepers such as Mega Kangaskhan as well as Trick Room setters, but it's very situational. Wacan Berry or Rindo Berry can be used to reduce damage from an Electric- or Grass-type attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Bulky Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Zapdos are good checks against Suicune. However, Zapdos and other Electric / Flying type Pokemon such as Thundurus should be cautious of Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Grass-types such as Breloom, Venusaur, and Amoonguss also give Suicune a great deal of trouble, but they should also be cautious of Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt users such as Sableye and Thundurus prevent Suicune from setting up Tailwind, which is typically Suicune's main purpose.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out: Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan and Scrafty also prevent Suicune from setting up Tailwind while the opposing team sets up its own field effects.</p> <p><strong>Defiant, Competitive, and Contrary: Pokemon with Defiant or Comeptitive such as Bisharp and Milotic can switch in on Snarl and sweep with their boost. Serperior can also come in and get a Special Attack boost.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Mega Charizard Y drastically lessen Suicune's impact on the game. Mega Charizard Y can easily switch in on Suicune and diminish its already mediocre offensive presence further due to sun halving the damage of Water-type moves, and it can then proceed to 2HKO it with Solar Beam.</p> ",

        "name": "Bulky Tailwind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Tailwind doubles the Speed of Suicune and its allies for four turns and serves as a good utility move to allow slower Pokemon to become fast offensive threats. Hydro Pump is used to allow Suicune to provide serviceable offensive pressure, having a high chance to OHKO Mega Diancie always 2HKOing Heatran, though it should only be used if Suicune's team is heavily reliant on it to check both Mega Diancie and Heatran. Scald is used as both a STAB attack to soild deal damage and a utility move to possibly burn physical attackers; it also has perfect accuracy, unlike Hydro Pump. Ice Beam provides nice coverage against Dragon- and Flying-types such as Hydreigon and Landorus-T. Snarl provides utility and allows Suicune to support its team by weakening opposing special attackers. Snarl is also great for catching Rotom-W and Thundurus on the switch-in and helping to reduce the opposing team's amount of offensive pressure on Suicune specifically. Snarl, however, should not be used on teams with a notable weakness to Bisharp. Alternatively, Protect keeps Suicune safe for a turn while it waits to reset Tailwind or its partner takes care of a threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sitrus Berry provides immediate recovery, improving Suicune's longevity. Leftovers can be used over Sitrus Berry for more gradual HP recovery, but Sitrus Berry is generally a better fit. The Defense EVs with a Bold nature and Sitrus Berry allow Suicune to avoid the 2HKO from Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Return. The Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Deoxys-A and Mega Aerodactyl when Tailwind is up. The given Special Defense investment allows Suicune to always survive two Thunderbolts from standard bulky Rotom-W with the aid of a Sitrus Berry. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Attack to boost Suicune's power, netting it OHKOs on Landorus-T and Salamence with Ice Beam.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Suicune typically works best early- and mid-game, using Tailwind to either gain or restore momentum. Thanks to its bulk, Suicune is a fantastic switch-in to most neutral attacks, so it has use staying in the back and switching in for a frailer teammate. With Snarl, it's able to severely hinder any powerful special attacker, such as Kyurem-B, and even boosting ones, such as Calm Mind Cresselia. Use Snarl sparingly when the opposing team has Bisharp, as the move activates Defiant, giving Bisharp a +2 Attack boost and allowing it to apply heavy offensive pressure to your team. There are many Pokemon in Doubles OU that don't have a good matchup against Suicune, most notably Steel- and Water-types. Because of this, Suicune can be a great wincon late-game, soaking up hits, possibly burning threats with Scald, and slowing wearing down a foe.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Suicune works fantastic in bulky Fire / Water / Grass cores with Pokemon like Heatran and Mega Venusaur. These types of Pokemon work very well together by having fantastic defensive synergy and typing coverage, providing an extremely solid defensive backbone that can be hard to break. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan can help Suicune set up Tailwind successfully. Amoonguss is a particularly good partner for Suicune, as it can redirect Electric-type attacks while Suicune sets up Tailwind or takes care of opposing Fire- and Flying-types. As Suicune is mainly used for Tailwind, it works well with Pokemon that benefit from it, such as Breloom and Mega Kangaskhan. Pokemon that can deal with opposing Grass- and Electric-type attacks such as Kyurem-B and Landorus-T also make for good partners.</p> "

  "Greninja": {
    "overview": "<p>Greninja is generally a very niche Pokemon on Doubles teams due to its average offenses, which prevent it from getting many of the KOs it should and generally make other Pokemon better for the role of a strong attacker. It is also vulnerable to speed control and priority, as it has very low power and relies on its high Speed to get by, and most Pokemon faster than it can KO or do massive damage to it, such as Talonflame, Deoxys-A, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. It does have a niche on hail teams, however, as Protean allows it to spam powerful STAB Blizzards while its high base Speed allows it to outpace Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Latios, and Thundurus. It is able to beat most Pokemon that hail teams have trouble with as well thanks to its Water-, Rock-, and Fighting-type STAB moves and decent mixed attacking stats.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dark Pulse can be used to hit Aegislash and Jirachi, which can both take a Blizzard or one of Greninja's other coverage moves. Extrasensory can OHKO Fighting-types such as Keldeo, which are some of hail teams' biggest checks. Gunk Shot can be used to hit Sylveon and Gardevoir, both of which have high Special Defense and can take Greninja's special hits. Mat Block should not be used, as it is predictable, lacks priority, and leaves Greninja with only three usable moves after its first turn on the field.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Water-types such as Keldeo and Rotom-W resist Greninja's Blizzard and can easily hit back hard through its paper-thin bulk.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon Not Weak to Fighting-type Attacks: Steel-types also resist Blizzard, though they have to watch out for Low Kick. Mega Metagross and Aegislash can easily take both Blizzard and Low Kick and retaliate for a KO.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: To be able to effectively use its best move, Blizzard, Greninja absolutely needs to have hail up, meaning that opposing weather setters, such as Mega Charizard Y and Politoed, can make it much less effective just by switching in. Sun also weakens Greninja's Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Due to Greninja's low defenses, most powerful Choice Scarf users, such as Landorus-T and Kyurem-B, can OHKO it, making it a liability against teams that have Choice Scarf users. It is also weak to common priority users such as Talonflame and Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Thunder Wave: Since Greninja's best quality is its Speed, being slowed down by the likes of Thunder Wave from Thundurus and Gyarados can easily prevent it from doing its job. Its high Speed will also always make it go last under Trick Room, and Greninja has a hard time dealing with Trick Room setters such as Cresselia and Porygon2, making it lose against these types of teams. When Tailwind is set up by setters such as Suicune, Greninja will be outsped and easily KOed.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard: Two of Greninja's best moves, Blizzard and Rock Slide, are blocked by Wide Guard users such as Aegislash and Conkeldurr.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Blizzard can be very easily spammed under hail, as it can hit both foes with perfect accuracy and is a powerful move. It also has great type coverage against many Pokemon, such as Landorus and Hydreigon. Hydro Pump is used so that Greninja can pick up a quick KO against Rock- and Fire-type Pokemon that threaten Mega Abomasnow. Rock Slide can OHKO Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, discouraging them from switching in. Low Kick is an option to hit Mega Kangaskhan, Ferrothorn, and Heatran more reliably than Hydro Pump for super effective damage. Protect is a staple move in Doubles, allowing Greninja to stall out field conditions or protect itself while its ally deals with a threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>208 Speed EVs with a Naive nature are enough for Greninja to outspeed Whimsicott, Raikou, and more importantly Pokemon such as Thundurus and Mega Diancie. 64 Attack EVs let Greninja OHKO standard Heatran with Low Kick as well as bulky Mega Charizard Y with Rock Slide, while the rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack to power up Blizzard as much as possible. Life Orb significantly boosts Greninja's overall mixed-attacking prowess and offensive potential.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Greninja's main role is using Blizzard while dealing with common checks to hail teams thanks to its coverage. Greninja can be used either to whittle them down early on or to clean up late-game with Blizzard when its checks and other threatening Pokemon have been weakened enough for Blizzard to KO them. Greninja should use its coverage moves to hit many of the threats to the hail archetype, such as using Low Kick against Steel-types and Kangaskhan and using Rock Slide against Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame. Greninja should be brought in when there is a free switch due to its frailty.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Abomasnow is required as a partner for Greninja to work at all, as it sets up hail for Greninja to spam Blizzard, and Greninja wouldn't be viable without its support. Ground-types like Landorus-T and Fire-types such as Heatran and Talonflame are good partners for Greninja, since they can KO the Steel-types that threaten hail teams. Electric-types such as Thundurus are also good partners, since they can beat Water-types, which Greninja struggles against. Quick Guard support from Pokemon such as Terrakion and Virizion is greatly appreciated for Greninja, as it hates taking priority attacks.</p> "

  "Vivillon": {
    "overview": "<p>Vivillon uses Compound Eyes Sleep Powder, its decent Speed, and Tailwind to open up teams that aren't adequately prepared for sleep. Typically, it's used as a lead with a Fake Out user such as Kangaskhan or Infernape and is actually fairly effective at battering opposing teams if they can't deal with Fake Out + sleep leads. Unfortunately, Vivillon needs five moveslots to really be an effective support Pokemon and even then it would be outclassed, and it has less utility in the later game than other sleep inducers because of its lack of offense and reliance on Focus Sash.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Really, there are none. This Pokemon is horribly outclassed at doing everything else.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mega Diancie</strong>: Mega Diancie outruns Vivillon and easily OHKOes with Diamond Storm while also being able to Magic Bounce away Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Safety Goggles</strong>: Common Safety Goggles Pokemon (Volcanion, Heatran, Rotom-H, Jirachi, Aegislash, Togekiss) can ignore all of Vivillon's options and easily knock it out.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Grass-type Pokemon are immune to Sleep Powder and can generally take a Hurricane from Vivillon's low Special Attack. Ferrothorn makes short work of it, provided it's running Gyro Ball or Thunder Wave, and while other Grass-types don't want to take a Hurricane, most are not OHKOed and can put Vivillon to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out: Fake Out leads that outspeed Vivillon's own Fake Out support, or Inner Focus Kangaskhan, force Vivillon to Protect turn 1 and prevent it from getting a free Tailwind, which makes it much less threatening.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks: If you can bring Vivillon to its Focus Sash on the first turn—and every team should be able to—any priority except for Sucker Punch will keep it at bay. Priority Taunt also stops it cold, even if you can't bring it to its Focus Sash.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sleep Powder is the move Vivillon should be spamming. Use it against anything that isn't immune or about to faint to create free turns for teammates. After Tailwind, Vivillon outspeeds the entire metagame; typically, you'll use this when you can so that opposing Pokemon can't outspeed and KO Vivillon before getting put to sleep. Hurricane is Vivillon's best attack, making sure it isn't complete Taunt bait, and it hits sleep-immune Grass-types super effectively and can potentially get lucky and confuse foes. Protect is important to avoid getting ruined by Fake Out and other priority or common anti-lead tactics, but if you plan to use Vivillon less in the lead slot and more later in the game, Rage Powder may be better to serve as suicide support and protect Vivillon's partner after Vivillon has been brought down to Focus Sash.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Speed and Special Attack investment is best because it's not like Vivillon is surviving any hits anyway. Focus Sash is necessary for Vivillon to avoid being easily revenge killed by Pokemon such as Talonflame or even turn 1 KOs from offensive leads. Compound Eyes boosts Sleep Powder's and Hurricane's accuracy to consistent levels, so it's better than Friend Guard.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If the opposing team looks weak to sleep, simply lead with Vivillon and your Fake Out user. If it'll work, Fake Out something and use either Tailwind or Sleep Powder and just keep pounding away until Vivillon falls. If the team doesn't look as weak to sleep, it may be better to use Vivillon as bait to lure out their sleep checks and keep it in the back or double switch with it until they are gone, as it's pretty worthless in the face of sleep checks, especially if you're running Protect.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fake Out is typically used to ensure Vivillon survives turn 1 with its Focus Sash and can go to town on the opposing team. Kangaskhan is the most popular option, as it can boost against sleeping foes, but Infernape and Weavile are also viable choices with their better matchups against many common sleep checks—Weavile can even Knock Off Safety Goggles users before Vivillon sleeps them. Redirection, particularly from Jirachi, which resists Brave Bird, helps Vivillon beat priority users by sleeping them and also pairs well with Kangaskhan. Vivillon works best on more offensively oriented teams, which can make use of the few free turns bought by a sleep lead; obviously, some teammates should be able to handle common sleep-immune and Safety Goggles Pokemon, especially Jirachi and Togekiss, which make Vivillon entirely worthless.</p> "

  "Zygarde": {
    "overview": "<p>For the most part, Zygarde is outclassed and underwhelming in most major aspects. While it may have high bulk, it lacks any viable support move and has very disappointing offenses, which also lets down its unique access to Land's Wrath, a Ground-type spread attack that doesn't hit its partner, unlike Earthquake. Zygarde's typing is also a mixed bag, as, while it does let it take Electric-, Fire-, and Rock-type moves well, it leaves it vulnerable to the numerous Fairy-, Dragon-, and Ice-types in the metagame, including a metagame-defining threat in Mega Diancie. Its ability, Aura Break, also is useless, as both Xerneas and Yveltal are banned from DOU. Zygarde's only notable niche is being an actually viable bulky user of Glare, a move that lets it paralyze foes, including Landorus-T, a very prominent threat that Thunder Wave cannot touch. Despite this, it's generally better to run a Pokemon with Thunder Wave or a different Dragon-type instead, as Zygarde's access to Glare usually can't make up for its numerous downfalls.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Extreme Speed can work as a strong priority attack or to pick off weakened foes, but it doesn't hit very hard, as it is not boosted by STAB and Zygarde doesn't usually run any move or item to boost its Attack. Rock Slide is an alternative over Stone Edge, as it hits both foes, but the power drop compared to Stone Edge is noticeable, and it leaves Zygarde completely helpless against Wide Guard users. Substitute can work as a method of preventing Zygarde from being burned and, with Zygarde's good bulk, can make it difficult to take down. However, all these moves are typically worse than the already bad main set. Safety Goggles can work as an item over Sitrus Berry, as this turns Zygarde into a fantastic check to sun-based teams, but the boost in HP will be greatly missed should this change be made.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir can hit Zygarde extremely hard with super effective Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice, and neither will take much from Zygarde's attacks. Azumarill also has Play Rough to hit Zygarde super effectively and Aqua Jet to get around the Speed loss from a potential Glare.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Dragon-types can switch in on and KO Zygarde, as it doesn't usually carry a STAB Dragon-type attack. Latios and Hydreigon in particular are even immune to Land's Wrath. However, both must be wary of Glare, as they can be slowed down for Zygarde's ally to KO them.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon: Ice-types like Weavile and Kyurem-B can easily OHKO Zygarde with a 4x super effective STAB attack. However, many Ice-types are weak to Rock-type attacks and can be paralyzed, so they must be careful. Ice-type coverage is also common on many Pokemon. Water-type attackers such as Ludicolo and Suicune can outspeed Zygarde in rain or when under Tailwind and OHKO it with Ice Beam, and Ludicolo even resists Land's Wrath. Thundurus and Raikou can outspeed Zygarde and hit it hard with Hidden Power Ice, but Thundurus is weak to Stone Edge and Raikou is weak to Land's Wrath.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-W: Rotom-W is one of the absolute best answers to Zygarde in the metagame. It has Levitate to avoid Land's Wrath, is an Electric-type and thus cannot be paralyzed, and commonly runs Will-O-Wisp to burn Zygarde. Zygarde's only method of damaging Rotom-W is a neutral, non-STAB Stone Edge, so it typically must switch out when facing a Rotom-W.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: Intimidate users and fast Will-O-Wisp users can check Zygarde, as they can weaken its physical attacks. Gengar is immune to Zygarde's STAB Land's Wrath and can burn it without much of an issue.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard: Wide Guard users, such as Conkeldurr and Aegislash, can block Zygarde's Land's Wrath while a partner KOes it without taking damage. Conkeldurr has Ice Punch to severely damage Zygarde beyond just preventing its moves with Wide Guard, and Aegislash can hit hard with its base 150 Special Attack. Both also resist Zygarde's Rock-type coverage and don't mind being paralyzed, as they are already slow.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Land's Wrath is exclusively available for Zygarde and serves as its main STAB attack. It deals passable spread damage to Zygarde's foes without hitting its ally, giving the move a niche over Earthquake. Stone Edge handles the Flying-types that are immune to Land's Wrath, most notably Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame. Glare helps Zygarde carve out a small niche by giving it the ability to paralyze Ground-type foes such as Landorus-T, which Thunder Wave cannot do. Protect is used to help Zygarde scout for the foes' attacks, stall field conditions, and protect itself from damage while its partner deals with a threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>220 HP EVs guarantee that Zygarde will always survive Life Orb Thundurus's Hidden Power Ice, and when coupled with 52 Defense EVs and a Sitrus Berry, the 2HKO from Mega Kangaskhan's Return. The given Speed investment allows Zygarde to paralyze Breloom before it can use Spore and also guarantees that Zygarde will move before Bisharp and Volcanion. The remaining EVs are placed in Attack. An Adamant nature is chosen to give Zygarde a needed boost to its underwhelming power, guaranteeing that Land's Wrath will always OHKO standard Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As Zygarde's only solid attributes are in its bulk, it should spend the majority of its time on the field paralyzing as many threats as possible with Glare. Land's Wrath and Stone Edge should only be used against foes it hits super effectively or against a severely weakened foe to finish it off. Zygarde needs as much of its already middling power as it can get to remain threatening, so it doesn't tend to work well as a lead due to Intimidate users being common leads. Instead, Zygarde works best in the middle of the game, working to paralyze key threats or remove certain targets that prevent its more offensive teammates from cleaning up the opposing team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Steel-types such as Heatran and Aegislash are especially notable teammates to Zygarde, as they can deal with Ice- and Fairy-types and appreciate that Zygarde's Ground-type attack does not hit them. Aegislash also has access to Wide Guard to protect Zygarde from Pixilate Hyper Voice or Blizzard. Bisharp is another key Steel-type that works well with Zygarde, as it deters opposing Intimidate users with Defiant. Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon can take on the Dragon-types that Zygarde is unable to handle, and they appreciate its ability to take on Steel- and Fire-types. Fairy-types also tend to be slow, so Zygarde's access to Glare can lessen that issue. As Zygarde is generally a fairly passive Pokemon, it needs powerful teammates such as Talonflame, Mega Gardevoir, and Hoopa-U to take advantage of the opportunities its bulk and usage of Glare can provide.</p> "

  "Gardevoir": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Gardevoir establishes itself as one of the more flexible Mega options in the DOU metagame. A sky-high Special Attack, decent Speed tier, and excellent offensive typing paired with a powerful STAB move in Hyper Voice make Mega Gardevoir a very good pick for late-game clean-ups that is just as good early on in order to soften up opposing teams for its partners. On top of its excellent offensive prowess, Mega Gardevoir also possesses a wide array of support options, being a great pick for an Encore user as well as for speed control through Trick Room. This allows Mega Gardevoir to pair quite well with redirection moves, speed control, and Intimidate users, meaning it can be an excellent pick on several kinds of team archetypes.</p> <p>However, Gardevoir is held back due to its mediocre pre-Mega base 80 Speed, which often forces it to waste a turn using Protect to safely Mega Evolve. It is also ailed by its terrible base 68 HP and 65 Defense, which allow almost every common physical attacker to 2HKO it at worst and readily OHKO it at best, not to mention that it is vulnerable to every common priority attack in the game. Its terrible HP stat also offsets its excellent base 135 Special Defense, which limits how often it can switch in, even against resisted attacks. Gardevoir is also hindered by the frequency of Steel- and Fire-type Pokemon, which means that, depending on its coverage, it can become Substitute-bait for Heatran or Aegislash.</p> <p>Mega Gardevoir is still a very good choice in the DOU metagame, as very few Pokemon can provide the offensive presence and flexibility that Mega Gardevoir can. However, despite the ease with which its weaknesses can be mitigated, they still necessitate support.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Will-O-Wisp is an option that allows Gardevoir to slow down physical attackers, though this move is best employed through teammates because Gardevoir's frailty means that it will still take significant damage from burned foes. Gardevoir can also make great use of a Substitute to mitigate its lack of bulk, becoming a threatening presence once behind one, though this further increases the need for a redirection partner. Taunt is a viable pick as well, allowing Gardevoir to stop opposing Trick Room setters from setting up, as well as preventing other support moves such as Wide Guard, Tailwind, and Follow Me. Though very niche, Gardevoir can use Imprison, Memento, and Helping Hand to further support its teammates, though the latter two are best used on bulkier Pokemon, and Imprison only really aids against Sylveon. Lastly, Gardevoir can use Telepathy in its base forme in order to come in safely on a partner's spread move such as Earthquake or Explosion and then Mega Evolve safely the next turn, though it doesn't have use outside of that.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-type Pokemon such as Aegislash, Jirachi, and Mega Metagross can easily come in on Gardevoir and proceed to KO it. Heatran can also switch in on Gardevoir's STAB moves with ease, but it has to scout for Focus Blast and Hidden Power Ground beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Gardevoir has no means of dealing with Fire-type Pokemon outside of a neutral Psychic, so they typically force it out. Charizard and Talonflame also beat Gardevoir one-on-one and can switch in on Hyper Voice fairly easily.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Choice Scarf Landorus-T can outrun and do heavy damage to Gardevoir, with U-turn 2HKOing and Earthquake OHKOing it in one-on-one situations. Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Gengar also outrun it and do significant damage. Though not conventionally counters, Pokemon such as Keldeo and Terrakion can outrun and pick off weakened Gardevoir with ease if Gardevoir does not have a form of speed control in play.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks: Priority attacks nullify any form of speed advantage Gardevoir may have, and due to its general frailty, all common priority moves deal significant amounts of damage to Gardevoir. In particular, Brave Bird from Talonflame and Sucker Punch from Bisharp both OHKO Gardevoir, with Gardevoir having little in the way of a play around aside from switching out or relying on a partner to deal with it. Kangaskhan also can do significant damage through Sucker Punch pick off a weakened Gardevoir.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Gardevoir's terrible Defense means that even weaker physical attacks will do heavy damage, and strong physical attackers such as Kangaskhan and Mega Diancie will quickly tear through it.</p> <p><strong>Thunder Wave, Tailwind, and Trick Room</strong>: Due to being reliant on any one form of Speed control, an opposing form can be costly for Gardevoir. Though annoying for all variants, faster Gardevoir in particular should avoid being paralyzed at all costs, as that greatly diminishes their impact on the game. Faster variants are also very ineffective against Trick Room teams due to the low bulk meaning that they can not just take a hit and retaliate. Slower Gardevoir also have a tough time against faster teams without Trick Room being up due to even the bulk investment not granting significant durability. Gardevoir used with Tailwind also dislike opposing Tailwind, as that voids any speed advantage that might be gained by Gardevoir's own team's Tailwind.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard</strong>: Wide Guard prevents Mega Gardevoir from using Hyper Voice freely.</p> ",

Psychic is used in order to bypass Wide Guard and deal with Poison-type Pokemon that resist Hyper Voice, most notably Amoonguss, though Psyshock can be used as an alternative in order to do more damage to Sylveon. Trick Room is used in order to support slower teammates by reversing the conventional turn order, allowing slower Pokemon to attack before faster ones. Protect lets Mega Gardevoir shield itself from attacks while a partner takes out a threat, stall out opposing field conditions, and punish double targets.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EVs on this set allow Gardevoir to always survive a Hasty Life Orb Hoopa-U's Hyperspace Fury, which facilitates setting up Trick Room. With the Special Attack investment and a Quiet nature, Mega Gardevoir can 2HKO non-bulky Mega Kangaskhan with Hyper Voice. Quiet is used over Modest for the drop in Speed, which makes Gardevoir faster in Trick Room. Similarly, 0 Speed IVs should also be used on this set to ensure that Gardevoir can take the most advantage out of Trick Room. Gardevoir's ability pre-Mega isn't really important, as none of them are particularly beneficial, but Trace is sometimes useful for being able to copy a foe's Intimidate.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When using Trick Room Gardevoir, the key is to make sure Trick Room goes up as soon as possible, as this supports not only Gardevoir, but Gardevoir's whole team as well. Once Trick Room has been set up, Gardevoir plays quite similarly to a fast variant, with Hyper Voice now being used as often as possible. However, this set does not have any form of tertiary coverage, meaning it is a lot more dependent on its teammates to cover its weaknesses. One common mistake made when using Trick Room is the assumption that it needs to be set at all times; however, that is not the case, so it is best to remain cognizant of when to set Trick Room and when not to.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Trick Room Gardevoir works brilliantly because it can supplement speed control for itself. Intimidate support can be fulfilled by the likes of Landorus-T, as it can run sets to work on both fast and slow teams, and Scrafty is a very useful partner as well because its Fake Out allows Gardevoir to set Trick Room with greater confidence and it is also a capable check to Steel-type Pokemon. Redirection users also make for some viable team options, particularly Amoonguss, which becomes notably potent by gaining a fast Spore under Trick Room. Trick Room also allows Pokemon such as Hariyama and Rhyperior to become more threatening options for dealing with Steel- and Fire-type Pokemon, with Hariyama also providing Fake Out support. Lastly, Mega Gardevoir also benefits greatly from another form of speed control, with full Trick Room teams preferring another setter such as Hoopa-U or Cresselia and balanced teams preferring an alternate form such as a Tailwind setter like Suicune, as Gardevoir can still outrun a large portion of the metagame if it's using a Modest spread.</p> "

        "name": "Special Sweeper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fast Mega Gardevoir relies heavily on Hyper Voice as its primary mode of offense, with Psychic or Psyshock being used as a secondary STAB move to deal with Amoonguss. Protect is used in order to safely Mega Evolve, stall out opposing field conditions, and scout and punish double targets. Focus Blast is one of Gardevoir's primary coverage options, allowing it to deal significant damage to Kangaskhan, with a 30% chance to OHKO standard set when using a Timid nature and just shy of a 90% chance when using a Modest nature. Hidden Power Ground is another option that grants Mega Gardevoir a more secure method of dealing with Heatran than Focus Blast and can punish opposing Aegislash that try to set up a Substitute on Gardevoir. Encore provides an excellent support option when used in conjunction with a Fake Out user, being able to lock opposing Pokemon into Protect or Substitute.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Mega Gardevoir outrun as much as possible, with the 8 HP EVs allowing it to survive a Sludge Bomb from Landorus and the rest of the EVs invested in Special Attack to hit as hard as possible. If outrunning neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon is not a major concern, a Modest nature can be used instead. A bulkier spread of 72 HP / 108 Def / 220 SpA / 108 Spe with a Modest nature can also be used in order to always survive a Brave Bird from standard Talonflame, as well as a Shadow Ball or Flash Cannon from standard Aegislash, and outrun Jolly Breloom.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Gardevoir is a formidable threat in all moments of the game; however, it is at its best when outrunning and cleaning up worn-down threats with the help of some form of speed control. Typically, when using Mega Gardevoir, the goal is to spam Hyper Voice to take out large chunks of both of the opposing Pokemon's HP until it is forced out or is otherwise incapable of freely using Hyper Voice. Early-game, Hyper Voice can quickly break down the opposing team for Gardevoir's teammates to deal with more easily later on, and late-game, Gardevoir can clean up weakened threats two at a time with ease. Gardevoir's coverage options should only be used if absolutely needed; however, depending on what coverage is being used, Gardevoir is afforded different degrees of freedom. If Gardevoir is using Focus Blast, it may not have to always switch out if an opposing Kangaskhan is on the field if the Gardevoir user is aware of the Speed of both of the Pokemon. Focus Blast and Hidden Power Ground prevent Heatran from safely switching in on Gardevoir and using it as setup bait. Hidden Power Ground and Encore also allow Gardevoir to pressure Aegislash by punishing the Substitute and Wide Guard variants, though these options have to carefully weighed, as Aegislash can punish a bad read much more heavily than Heatran. As already mentioned, Gardevoir benefits greatly from speed control; however, this is especially true because a lot of the key threats it deals with typically outrun it and do significant damage before Gardevoir gets the chance to deal with them, such as Keldeo and Terrakion, which is why Gardevoir works so well with Tailwind to outrun and deal with them effortlessly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Gardevoir set appreciates the presence of an Intimidate user on its team in order to alleviate its bad physical bulk, in particular the likes of Landorus-T and Salamence. Landorus-T is able to quickly beat down bulky Steel- and Fire-type Pokemon, which Gardevoir has trouble with, and Salamence is capable of using its mixed offensive coverage to help tackle some of Gardevoir's weak areas and can also offer speed control through Tailwind, which is a major boon for Gardevoir. Due to its middling Speed tier, Gardevoir likes to lean on the use of speed control options, such as Tailwind and Icy Wind, in order to outrun the opposing team and go to work. Notable options for speed control include Hydreigon, Talonflame, Gengar, and Jirachi, the former two setting up Tailwind and the latter two providing Icy Wind support. Each of those also provide some other area of support such as the ability to to beat Steel-types, cripple physical attackers, or provide redirection. The last key element, redirection, is an essential element of any Gardevoir team, as it provides room for Gardevoir to breathe and get into its offense. Jirachi and Amoonguss are the two most prominent options when looking for a redirector, as the former also has access to speed control and Helping Hand, whereas the latter has a sleep-inducing move with Spore. Gardevoir's team should place emphasis in being able to tackle Fire- and Steel-type Pokemon in particular, so options such as Terrakion, Landorus-T, Keldeo, Volcanion, and Heatran are all good picks.</p> <p>Some other options that Gardevoir teams can make great use of include Fake Out support, as that eases prediction when Mega Evolving and becomes a very disruptive option when used in conjunction with Encore. Infernape works well in this way, as it provides a Fake Out that outspeeds most common Quick Guard users and can deal with other foes that threaten Gardevoir such as Aegislash and Ferrothorn. Quick Guard is another option that Gardevoir greatly benefits from, as it keeps it safe from priority moves such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Bisharp's Sucker Punch, both of which OHKO it with ease, as well as priority Taunts and Thunder Waves.</p> "

  "Gallade": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Gallade is a fast physical attacker that can't flinch, which at first appears to provide a niche for it in Doubles OU, and it boasts nice Attack and Special Defense stats as well. However, Mega Gallade is not as viable as it appears on the surface and is let down by its poor defensive typing and lack of bulk that make it very difficult to switch in even on neutral attacks. Gallade is also quite slow and frail before Mega Evolution, so it has to Protect in order to receive its better stats, which can kill momentum for any team. Mega Gallade is also easily worn down by common Intimidate users like Landorus-T and Gyarados while also facing very difficult matchups against common threats such as Talonflame, Aegislash, Gardevoir, and Sylveon. Even its niche as a check to Mega Kangaskhan isn't necessary when other Mega Evolutions such as Mega Gengar and Mega Diancie can check Mega Kangaskhan while also providing more to support the rest of the team. The Mega Evolution slot for a powerful attacker is often better used on Mega Diancie, Mega Kangaskhan, or even Mega Metagross, rather than spending it on Mega Gallade.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Knock Off allows Mega Gallade to punish Aegislash (but it still loses this matchup) and Latios (which it Speed ties with). Stone Edge lets Mega Gallade hit Flying-types such as Charizard and Gyarados. Ice Punch lets Mega Gallade hit Landorus-T and Thundurus.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Gardevoir in particular completely shuts down Mega Gallade, while other Fairy-types such as Azumarill and Diancie are equally threatening for Mega Gallade and are not threatened to be KOed by it in return.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon: Bulky Psychic-types such as Cresselia offer a host of problems to Mega Gallade, as they can continuously take hits from Mega Gallade and set up Calm Minds or a potential Trick Room. Faster offensive Psychic-types like Deoxys-A also threaten to KO Mega Gallade before it can attack.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame: As the only common user of Flying-type STAB and priority attacker, Talonflame is extremely threatening to Mega Gallade, as it can OHKO it with Brave Bird and will always move first.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash</strong>: Boasting an immunity and a resistance to Mega Gallade's STAB moves and impressive stats both offensively and defensively, Aegislash is a hard counter to Mega Gallade. It easily switches in on any attack and can fire back with Shadow Ball to KO it or lower Mega Gallade's Attack two stages with King's Shield.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: Like any physical attacker, Mega Gallade can be worn down pretty easily by Intimidate and burns. Landorus-T, Gyarados, Rotom-W, and Gengar can all threaten to lower Mega Gallade's Attack and can all take a hit to do so.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Thunder Wave, Tailwind, and Trick Room all threaten to make Mega Gallade move last and take away its niche as a fast Fighting-type. Mega Gallade's underwhelming bulk does not let it take neutral hits well, so moving last is detrimental to Mega Gallade's utility. Pokemon like Cresselia, Thundurus, and Suicune can all consistently give speed control against Mega Gallade, which becomes very problematic.</p> ",

        "name": "Mega Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Close Combat is the primary STAB move and hits Steel- and Normal-types for a lot of damage. Zen Headbutt is a STAB option that doesn't lower Mega Gallade's stats and hits Fighting- and Poison-types, such as Amoonguss and Keldeo, for super effective damage. Quick Guard allows Mega Gallade to block all Fake Out users barring Weavile as well as shield its teammate from Talonflame, while Feint allows Mega Gallade to break through Protect, Quick Guard, and Wide Guard for its teammate to pick off an otherwise protected target. Protect allows Gallade to scout opposing Pokemon's moves, gain its full Speed after Mega Evolution, and stall out field conditions while its partner may be able to handle potential threats.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and a Jolly nature allow Mega Gallade to outspeed Keldeo and Terrakion while Speed tying with Mega Diancie and Latios. Maximum Attack lets Mega Gallade hit as hard as possible. Neither pre-Mega ability is very good, as many common Dark-type attacks that would activate Justified can be potential 2HKOs on Gallade, while activating the Speed boost from Steadfast requires reading a Fake Out correctly and staying non-Mega for longer, which is not a safe option.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Non-Mega Gallade is really bad, so Mega Evolving into the still-mediocre Mega Gallade is important and should be done at the first safe opportunity. Mega Gallade operates at its best when faster threats have been removed, so it often is best used in the mid- or late-game, but it can also be used to punch holes in the early-game. Don't recklessly switch Gallade into attacks, as its low HP stat leaves it fairly frail. Switching into Dark-type attacks to get the Justified boost isn't advised, as many common Dark-type attacks will 2HKO it, such as Hydreigon's Dark Pulse, or even OHKO it, like Hoopa-U's Hyperspace Fury.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Steel-types such as Aegislash and Heatran are able to take on the Fairy-types that threaten Mega Gallade, such as Gardevoir and Diancie. Bisharp gets a special mention, as it also deters Intimidate and is able to beat Ghost-types. These Steel-types also appreciate Mega Gallade's ability to threaten opposing Steel-types. Kyurem-B is able to deal with Flying-types such as Landorus-T and Thundurus that can be bothersome for Mega Gallade, while Mega Gallade is able to threaten Fighting- and Steel-types that deter Kyurem-B. Rain teams appreciate Mega Gallade's ability to deal with common checks to rain such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Dragon-types. Checks to Aegislash and Talonflame are a must-have. Both of these shut Mega Gallade down, so Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Bisharp can be used as checks to Aegislash, and Pokemon such as Rotom-W and bulky Thundurus can be used to check Talonflame.</p> "

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatran possesses a unique Fire / Steel typing and the ability Flash Fire, which grant it nine resistances and an immunity to Fire-type moves, allowing it to switch in on a lot of common threats in the Doubles metagame and serve as a great check for sun offense and Fairy-types. With a high Special Attack stat and good bulk, it serves as a strong offensive support Pokemon, capable of delivering significant damage to the opposing team. However, Heatran is held back by its weaknesses to common offensive types such as Fighting, Ground, and Water. A fairly linear movepool makes Heatran quite predictable, and its middling Speed tier leaves it outrun by common threats when using its faster sets and undersped in Trick Room by common Trick Room sweepers.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A pure Special Attacker set with a Shuca Berry or Life Orb is Heatran's most viable option aside from its Substitute set. Such sets would run Flash Cannon in addition to its dual STABs, which helps Heatran take on Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B as it can stomach their Earth Powers due to the Shuca Berry. Shuca Berry can also be used on the Substitute set, although the usage of Substitute can knock Heatran's health low enough that the Shuca Berry will no longer protect it from any Ground-type moves. Eruption is a decent choice on Heatran, but as it forces Heatran to use a Quiet nature, should only be used on teams featuring Trick Room. Such sets should be paired with Safety Goggles so that they can take on Amoonguss, a major threat under Trick Room.</p> <p>Safety Goggles is a solid item choice on other sets as well, bolstering Heatran's ability to wall Chlorophyll Venusaur and Amoonguss, which might try to put it to sleep. Hidden Power Ice can be useful on the second set for taking on threats such as Landorus and Salamence. Will-O-Wisp can be used to hinder physical attackers on the switch. Ancient Power can be used to beat Talonflame and Charizard, though it is generally a poor choice. Alternatively, Stone Edge takes advantage of Mega Charizard Y's weaker defense and gets the OHKO even with a negative Attack nature. Heatran is one of the few Pokemon that can be used as a Stealth Rock setter, though it should only be used if sun is a major weakness of your team. Choice Scarf can be used to outrun and do heavy damage to Pokemon that normally outspeed Heatran, but Eruption, the move that would be most useful on such sets, forces Heatran to use a negative Speed nature. Air Balloon can be useful in some cases but should be avoided, as it removes Heatran's ability to switch in and out without breaking the Air Balloon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Mega Swampert, and Garchomp can easily OHKO Heatran with Earthquake, and Swampert can also use Waterfall to circumvent a potential partner with Wide Guard. Pokemon with Ground-type coverage such as Mega Diancie, Hydreigon, and Kyurem-B threaten Heatran as well, although only Hydreigon can safely switch in. Mega Charizard Y sometimes uses Hidden Power Ground specifically to beat Heatran, which would otherwise wall its standard set.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Bulky Water-types can take any of its attacks and wear it down. Suicune and Rotom-W can easily take any move Heatran uses and 2HKO back with Hydro Pump, and Gyarados can do the same with Waterfall. Faster Water-types such as Kingdra, Ludicolo (under rain), and Keldeo can all outrun and OHKO Heatran; Keldeo, in particular, can beat it with both of its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Fighting-types, such as Terrakion and Virizion, can beat Heatran with STAB moves such as Close Combat. Bulky Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr and Scrafty are good checks as well; they can easily take its attacks due to commonly using Assault Vest and can 2HKO with Drain Punch to recover most of the damage taken. Mega Kangaskhan with Low Kick can take out Heatran as well.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Rain teams render Heatran relatively useless, as Heat Wave becomes a very weak move, and common rain abusers don't mind Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore</strong>: Substitute Heatran is susceptible to both Taunt and Encore, as they can prevent it from setting up Substitute or lock it into Substitute, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard</strong>: Wide Guard prevents Heat Wave from being used and forces Heatran to either switch out, wait for its partner to handle the Wide Guard user, or use a coverage option.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute shields Heatran from super effective moves and status, giving it room to operate. Heat Wave is the primary attacking move; the goal is to get behind a Substitute and use Heat Wave to wear down the opposing team for Heatran's teammates. Earth Power lets it beat opposing Heatran, which would otherwise wall it, as well as hit Rock-types such as Terrakion if you predict the switch. Protect does a number of things, including letting Heatran scout, stall out field conditions, and survive a deadly attack.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Heatran runs maximum Speed usually to maximize its chance at winning a speed game with opposing Heatran. Investing 24 EVs into HP ensures that Choice Scarf Landorus-T cannot ever break a Substitute with Rock Slide, and the remaining EVs are invested into Special Attack to hit harder. If you find it important to outrun Pokemon which typically sit in the 260 Speed range, particularly Kyurem-B, Charizard, Zapdos, and Breloom, you can use Timid, but against the latter three Pokemon it's typically better practice to use Heatran's partners to give it room to set up a Substitute on them. If you don't need to outrun these threats, Modest allows Heatran to hit as hard as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When using Substitute Heatran, it is better to be patient and wait for a free turn to get behind a Substitute. There are numerous situations in which Heatran can safely set up, such as against support Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Togekiss, Cresselia, and Jirachi. Certain Choice item users, such as Genesect, Landorus-T, and Sylveon locked into Iron Head, Rock Slide, and Hyper Voice, respectively, are good foes to safely set up against. Once Substitute is up, use Protect and Leftovers to allow Heatran to quickly recuperate the HP lost from setting up the Substitute. Use Protect to scout for random Hidden Power Ground and Focus Blast, because common threats such as Sylveon, Charizard, Gardevoir, and Latios occasionally carry them to beat Heatran. A key part of using Heatran is that you should not try to set up a Substitute against a foe that beats Heatran, but if Heatran is already behind a Substitute when a check switches in, feel free to fire off a Heat Wave or Earth Power before switching out (unless their partner can also do heavy damage). Heatran can also switch in and out rather frequently, as it has enough bulk and resistances to do so relatively freely. In certain situations, it can be worth risking a Substitute versus a Pokemon that is capable of breaking it, such as when the opposing Pokemon are more threatened by Heatran's partner or are forced to go for the partner. It can be worth sacrificing a Pokemon to set up a Substitute, depending on how much of a nuisance Substitute Heatran is to the opposing team. For example, versus sun offense, Heatran can be virtually immovable, but against rain, Heatran is more of a liability.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Rotom-W can clear out Terrakion and Ground-types such as Landorus-T. Rotom-W has the added bonuses of a Ground-type immunity and the ability to beat opposing Water-types, and Suicune has Tailwind for speed control. Fairy-types such as Gardevoir, Sylveon, and Diancie can all beat Fighting-types and enjoy having Steel-types cleared out. They also can complement Heatran's Heat Wave with powerful spread moves of their own. Substitute Heatran enjoys redirection quite a bit more than most Pokemon, as it relies on setting up a Substitute to succeed in doing its job. Partners such as Togekiss and Amoonguss can provide redirection and have good defensive synergy with Heatran. They both provide valuable resistances to Fighting, and Togekiss can provide speed control via Tailwind, while Amoonguss can easily absorb Water-type moves and use Spore to create free turns. Thundurus can paralyze faster threats, beat Water-types, and use Prankster Taunt in case opposing teams try to use their own Taunt to stop Heatran from setting up.</p> <p>Partners that provide significant amounts of offensive pressure are also excellent, as they tend to generate a lot of free turns as well as attention from the opposing team. Kangaskhan is a good example, as it can use Fake Out to buy Heatran a turn to set up. Latios can provide Tailwind support, and it threatens most common Fighting-types due to its high Speed and Special Attack and Psychic typing. Cresselia is a great partner, as it can support Heatran in many ways, such as by providing Skill Swap support to alleviate Heatran's Ground-type weakness, using Icy Wind or Thunder Wave for speed control, setting up sun via Sunny Day for a boost to Heat Wave, and beating common threats to Heatran such as Landorus-T, Keldeo, and Terrakion. Levitate and Flying-type Pokemon such as Gengar, Cresselia, Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Zapdos are good partners. Due to being a major liability against rain teams, Heatran prefers partners that can compensate for it against rain. Electric-types and Grass-types, such as Thundurus and Amoonguss, work well in this regard, as do Dragon-types such as Latios and Hydreigon. Mega Charizard Y also helps against rain by being able to change the weather using Drought, providing Heatran with increased Fire-type damage as well. Wide Guard users such as Hitmontop, Swampert, and Aegislash are useful partners, as they can shield Heatran from Earthquake users. Hitmontop also provides useful Intimidate and Fake Out support, Swampert can be useful in dealing with Landorus-T, Terrakion, and opposing Heatran, and Aegislash possesses powerful offenses and a useful Fighting-type immunity.</p> "

  "Aegislash": {
    "overview": "<p>Aegislash is one of the best utility Pokemon in DOU. Its great defensive typing and stats make it a good switch-in to many of the most powerful attackers in the metagame, including Kangaskhan, Metagross, Diancie, and Kyurem-B, four extremely potent offensive threats that are otherwise hard to check and definitely impossible to check with a single slot. Its powerful, nearly unresisted STAB moves are capable of 2HKOing basically anything that doesn't have investment in bulk. It can effectively run multiple different sets: most commonly a Wide Guard support set, but also an offensive bruiser with Life Orb or a late-game cleaning wall with Substitute.</p> <p>However, Aegislash's low Speed and lack of recovery make it vulnerable to being worn down over the course of the match, as it often has to take multiple hits before it attacks: one when it switches in on a hit and another on the turn it attacks. Its weaknesses to the common types of Dark, Fire, and especially Ground don't help its case either; it can take all but the strongest of hits from full health, but once chip damage removes half of its health, its utility is drastically limited. The fact that it is forced to run a unique Protect, King's Shield, doesn't help either. While it can sometimes bluff your opponent into not attacking for fear of a -2 Attack stat drop, or actually get a crucial -2, it's far more likely to let Aegislash get burned, put to sleep, or Encored.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The tank set can run Sitrus Berry to extend its longevity while bluffing Weakness Policy, but generally the threat is less effective than the real thing. When running Life Orb, Aegislash can also use Shadow Sneak to pick off weakened foes, but the attack is rather weak without investment, so Wide Guard is usually more useful. The Life Orb set can also use Sacred Sword over Flash Cannon to hit Bisharp, but as Bisharp is faster and almost OHKOes Aegislash, it's usually better to keep Flash Cannon, which has much better neutral coverage. For example, if the opponent could switch in either Hydreigon or Landorus-T, Flash Cannon will cover both, while Sacred Sword and Shadow Ball cover one each.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Dark-type Pokemon are basically the only Pokemon that can shrug off a Shadow Ball, and all are capable of dealing heavy damage back to Aegislash. As such, they are the best Aegislash switch-ins. Bisharp is especially good for resisting both of Aegislash's STAB attacks. Hoopa-U is easily able to OHKO Aegislash with Hyperspace Fury, which breaks protect and ignores Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Fire-type Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Talonflame are capable of significantly damaging Aegislash and make it much easier for the opposing team to keep it at bay.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Both Landorus and Landorus-T are capable of taking out Aegislash with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore: Taunt from the likes of Thundurus and Gyarados forces Aegislash to stay in Blade forme, keeping it vulnerable to a fatal hit. Unfortunately, Aegislash can simply switch out, not to mention the foe will still have to eat at least one Shadow Ball. Encore is effective on every single one of Aegislash's moves, trapping it either into Blade forme or a useless King's Shield. It's basically a strictly superior version of Taunt versus Aegislash, but the only remotely common users are Politoed, Mega Gardevoir, and Togekiss. Both of these utility moves are especially safe, because King's Shield does not stop them.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: The foe can force Aegislash to switch in on resisted hits and take chip damage until it's within KO range of super effective coverage moves. This is how Aegislash is actually handled in the vast majority of cases. The hits it takes will get to it eventually, and it is much less effective when it can't attack with impunity. Burning Aegislash, possibly with Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon such as Rotom-W, puts it on a short timer so that it is no longer entirely free to alternate between attacking and using King's Shield.</p> ",

        "name": "Wide Guard Tank",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball and Flash Cannon are Aegislash's STAB attacks and complement each other well, only really missing out on Bisharp. Unfortunately, they have very little super effective coverage; Aegislash will pick up many 2HKOs, but very few OHKOs. Wide Guard is a spectacular support move to protect Aegislash's partners from Rock Slide, Diamond Storm, and, less frequently, Earthquake, Hyper Voice, and Heat Wave. It also has the nifty property of making Landorus-T unable to come in on Aegislash, especially if it lacks Stone Edge. Beware of the rarer Knock Off Landorus-T, but it does activate Weakness Policy. Substitute is an option over Wide Guard to take advantage of Aegislash's ability to force switches and to prevent Amoonguss from putting it to sleep, but Wide Guard is typically more useful. Besides, Aegislash doesn't want to dent its own HP because it wants to stay out of the KO range of super effective moves. All Aegislash should have King's Shield because Protect is already great and Blade forme cannot take hits.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Aegislash doesn't need much more complicated investment than maximum HP and Special Attack. With less Special Attack, Aegislash loses the chance to OHKO Kangaskhan at +2, which is pretty important. Because Aegislash mirrors are fairly common, everyone does their own thing with Speed. Some minimize it fully to get the second hit on other Aegislash (to hit while the opposing Aegislash is in Blade forme), others use 4 Speed Modest to get the first hit (even Shield forme Aegislash can take up to 80%), and others use 84 Speed on a Tailwind team to get the jump on offensive Thundurus. In general, less Speed is good so that Aegislash can take more hits in Shield forme, but you should make your own decision based on your team's needs. Weakness Policy takes advantage of Aegislash's ability to take super effective attacks fairly well by providing it with a boost to attacking stats. A useful alternative is Life Orb, which provides Aegislash constant high damage output, useful for securing KOs at the cost of compromising its bulk. Safety Goggles is another item option, allowing Aegislash to counter Breloom, Venusaur, and Amoonguss, but it is useless in all other matchups.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is mostly used as a pivot, switching in on threats, forcing them out, and taking a chunk out of something with one of its STAB attacks. Weakness Policy is used to discourage the opponent from attacking Aegislash with a super effective move that won't KO, which greatly extends Aegislash's lifespan by forcing the opponent to use non-super effective attacks to whittle Aegislash down first before taking it out. As such, it's recommended to keep Aegislash at high enough HP to keep the threat effective. Some important benchmarks are 55% for Mega Diancie's or Kyurem-B's Earth Power, 65% for Heatran's Heat Wave, and 75% for Mega Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch. If your opponent does activate Weakness Policy, something is probably going to faint every time Aegislash attacks, so you should focus on making its rampage last as long as possible. If Aegislash is running Life Orb, it works fairly well at greatly denting foes for teammates to clean up later. Typically this set is used early- and mid-game to keep momentum in your favor and won't survive to the end of the match, though you of course should keep it around if you're relying on it to check a specific threat such as Mega Metagross.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>More than anything, this Aegislash is spectacular with Pokemon that need help with Diancie, such as Mega Charizard Y and Kyurem-B. Honestly, though, it fits on most teams because of its all-around utility. It is awkward on Tailwind teams though, as it will be exposed in Blade forme much more often. This set is great on balanced teams which emphasize defensive synergy, especially if they include fast sleep, redirection, or Fake Out, which are all useful for extending its +2 rampages. More offensive teams would probably prefer Life Orb Aegislash.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute Leftovers",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball and Flash Cannon provide Aegislash with two-move coverage that hits every relevant Pokemon except Bisharp neutrally. Substitute and King's Shield is a classic cleaning wall combination; alternating between the moves with attacks thrown in allows Aegislash to live forever if the Pokemon which can beat it one-on-one are eliminated. Substitute also helps to patch up King's Shield's inability to block status moves, though Aegislash is still vulnerable to Encore and Taunt. In addition, Aegislash can use Substitute along with its ability to force switches earlier in the game to play around its usual switch-ins. Wide Guard is an option that can be used in conjunction with Substitute in order utilize the both the longevity of the Substitute set with the support utility of the Wide Guard set.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers is vital for healing so that Aegislash can fulfill its role as a win condition via Substitute + King's Shield stalling. No more complex investment than maximum Special Attack and HP is necessary; even this comparatively bulky Aegislash is useful for hitting hard. Because Aegislash mirrors are fairly common, everyone does their own thing with Speed. In general, less Speed is good so that Aegislash can take more hits in Shield forme, but this set wants to win the mirror matchup because it has the ability to use Substitute on the opposing Aegislash and bait it into Blade forme or fish for King's Shields. How much creep you run is up to you.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set's main role is to serve as a win condition, cleaning the opponent's team after its counters are removed, simply by being unkillable. Early game, it can be used to blast the opponent's team with powerful Ghost-type moves and check some threats, but be sure to keep it healthy if it's likely to be your win condition.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>More defensive teams, which enjoy Aegislash's defensive traits but typically suffer from a lack of clear win conditions, will get the most mileage out of this set. Of course, this set needs support, and it only works on teams which are adept at clearing out its checks, which is to say Fire-, Ground-, Dark-, and strong Water-type move users. As basically all of these types are fairly popular in the metagame, this set is quite difficult to use; most teams will be better off with the tank set instead. However, it is still viable if the team is able to support it.</p> "

  "Cresselia": {
    "overview": "<p>Cresselia possesses outstanding bulk and an amazing movepool, making it a top-tier threat in Doubles with the ability to take hits well and run many different sets. Cresselia is an effective fit on various types of teams, providing support or offensive presence with moves such as Trick Room, Psyshock, and even Helping Hand. However, it is prone to becoming setup bait, especially for threatening sweepers carrying Substitute. Furthermore, Knock Off is a commonplace move that is very threatening to Cresselia due to the fact that it takes a significant amount of damage from the attack and loses its precious item.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Psychic is an option over Psyshock to hit physically defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss harder. Cresselia makes a great weather supporter with access to both Sunny Day and Rain Dance. Reflect is a useful support option if you want to increase your team's overall physical defense. Light Clay can be used to lengthen the time screens last. Hidden Power Fire lets Cresselia hit Ferrothorn for 4x super effective damage, as it takes very little from any of Cresselia's other attacks. Skill Swap is also a notable choice, as you can pass Levitate to Heatran and not have to worry about opposing Ground-type attacks while Cresselia gains an immunity to Fire-type attacks. You are also able to strip enemies of their useful abilities, such as Huge Power on Azumarill or Parental Bond on Mega Kangaskhan. Safeguard can be used to prevent crippling status conditions like Sleep and Paralysis as well as stop physical attackers from being burned by Will-O-Wisp. Gravity can raise the accuracy of moves such as Hydro Pump, but it also makes Cresselia and Flying-types vulnerable to Ground-type moves. Lunar Dance enables a crippled Pokemon to regain all of its HP with no status for a potential late-game sweep, although this is at the cost of Cresselia.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Dark-types such as Bisharp, Scrafty, Hydreigon and Hoopa-U can counter Cresselia if it is not carrying Moonblast, as they are immune to its STAB Psychic-type attacks. Bisharp and Scrafty can also run Knock Off, which Cresselia despises. Bisharp can even switch into Icy Wind and gain a +2 Attack boost due to Defiant.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Mega Gengar can deal a lot of damage with their super effective STAB Shadow Ball. Mega Gengar must be careful though, as it takes a lot of damage from Cresselias STAB Psychic-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types such as Heatran, Mega Metagross, and Ferrothorn wall Cresselia without Hidden Power Ground. Aegislash can also hit back hard with super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Sleep: Spore users such as Amoonguss and Breloom can stop Cresselia from setting Trick Room by putting it to sleep. Safety Goggles can block Spore, however.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Substitute: Pokemon that carry Substitute such as Heatran can set up on Trick Room Cresselia with ease. Without a Mental Herb, Taunt completely shuts down Cresselia, as it is unable to fulfill its role as a supporter or a Trick Room setter.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Trick Room",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Trick Room gives slower allies a chance to sweep. Cresselia's STAB-boosted Psychic does respectable damage to things which are not weak to its coverage moves, such as Rotom-W. Cresselia should always run Psychic, not Psyshock, because only the former breaks Kyurem-B's Substitute. Ice Beam gives Cresselia extra coverage, dealing 4x super effective damage to common threats such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Hidden Power Ground lets Cresselia 2HKO Heatran, a threat that would normally wall Cresselia, as it resists Psychic- , Ice-, and Fairy-type attacks. Hidden Power Fighting allows Cresselia to deal 4x super effective damage to Bisharp.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The main purpose of this set is to set up Trick Room and hit common threats hard. A Sassy nature and 3 Speed IVs allow Cresselia to function as effectively as possible in Trick Room while still having the maximum power possible for Hidden Power Ground. The EV spread lets Cresselia survive a Life Orb-boosted Knock Off from Bisharp while OHKOing 0 / 4 Landorus-T with Ice Beam. Expert Belt lets Cresselia deal more damage to the Pokemon it hits for super effective damage without compromising its bulk as Life Orb would do. Sitrus Berry increases Cresselia's longevity and lets it set up Trick Room more times and deal extra damage to foes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Trick Room should be set up as early in the battle as possible, as Cresselia functions best under it and it can aid slower partners. You should also attempt to keep Cresselia and a partner that can sweep under Trick Room alive for a possible late-game sweep when the opponent's checks have been removed. Cresselia is great for switching into attacks because its amazing bulk allows it to take multiple hits. Cresselia should also be used to support its partner by getting surprise KOs on checks such as Bisharp and Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As the moveset suggests, Cresselia is great for Trick Room teams, as you will find many opportunities to set up Trick Room with its impressive bulk and hit foes that are weak to Cresselia's attacks for good damage with Expert Belt. You should partner Cresselia with slow, powerful Pokemon such as Mega Mawile, Rhyperior, and Mega Ampharos to get the most out of the Trick Room turns provided. A Fake Out user such as Scrafty or Hitmontop can flinch potential threats to increase the chances of setting Trick Room. Fighting-types also handle the common threats Cresselia has to deal with such as Tyranitar and Bisharp. Earthquake users such as Rhyperior pair well with Cresselia, as they can freely use their STAB attack without hitting Cresselia. Amoonguss can also be a viable partner, as Rage Powder redirects Taunt and aids in setting up Trick Room. It can also put a potential threat to sleep with Spore and benefits greatly from Trick Room.</p> "

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind makes Cresselia a very threatening cleaning wall, as most Pokemon are not able to damage it faster than it can heal itself and very few can take boosted Psyshocks with ease. Even though Dark-types are immune to it, Psyshock is still Cresselia's main attacking option, as Cresselia needs the STAB boost to deal sufficient damage after a Calm Mind or two. Psyshock is recommended over Psychic solely for the mirror match. Moonlight is Cresselia's best healing option because rain and sand are uncommon. As a Trick Room setter, this Cresselia is able to support its team and pull its weight even when it can't use Calm Mind, and under Trick Room, it is able to move first, making it that much scarier. However, Icy Wind can be used instead on the fourth slot in for additional coverage that can still prove support. Hidden Power Ground is also an option, useful for getting past Steel-types such as Heatran and Aegislash.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Cresselia runs maximum HP and Defense EVs because Calm Mind will boost its Special Defense. Safety Goggles is the recommended item because the easiest way to dispatch this Cresselia is to put it to sleep, though Leftovers (with Substitute) and Chesto Berry (with Rest) are also options. If Cresselia is not using Trick Room, 136 Speed EVs may be used so that Cresselia outspeeds Bisharp, granting it the ability to use Moonlight before taking Knock Off and stalling it out. If using Icy Wind, this also allows Cresselia to move before offensive Thundurus and any base 110s after getting a speed drop.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If you plan to win with Calm Mind, it is absolutely critical to avoid letting Cresselia get burned, especially before it has set up, as burns destroy its effectiveness by forcing it to heal almost every turn. The game plan for this set is simple: come in on two foes that can't outdamage Moonlight, set up a Trick Room or Calm Mind, and become virtually invincible. Don't be afraid to set up early; thanks to Cresselia's bulk, it can set up multiple times throughout a match, and setting up is a great way to lure in Cresselia's checks for its partner to dismantle. Cresselia can support its team throughout the match by plugging away with +1 or +2 Psyshocks to soften up the opposing team, and Cresselia has a much easier time sweeping when it has partner support.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because Cresselia is capable of offering Trick Room support, it fits quite well on Trick Room teams as an extremely bulky setter that doesn't fear being OHKOed. In return, it appreciates Fake Out and redirection support, which can give it a much easier time setting up, block Taunt and burns, and help Cresselia get past certain threats such as Kangaskhan. Of course, it wants teammates that can remove Dark- and Steel-types consistently, which means Fighting-, Fairy-, and Fire-types are most effective. On non-Trick Room teams, Keldeo is a very good partner, as it lures in setup bait such as Amoonguss and Venusaur and is able to handle all of the common Dark- and Steel-types.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Icy Wind is a spread move that provides speed control and is 4x super effective against Landorus-T and Salamence. Thunder Wave is also great for permanent speed control and the possibility to immobilize a foe. Helping Hand assists in giving Cresselia's partner a 1.5x power boost, which can be helpful in many situations. Psyshock is a reliable STAB move because more of the Doubles metagame has bulkier Special Defense. Light Screen boosts the team's overall Special Defense significantly or Protect can be used to add more survivability.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Calm nature with maximum HP investment and 112 Special Defense EVs enable Cresselia to be a specially defensive wall that's difficult to take down. With the assitance of a Sitrus Berry, Cresselia can avoid getting 2HKOed by a Shadow Ball from Modest Mega Gengar. Furthermore, the 100 Defense EVs with the Sitrus Berry ensure that Cresselia will survive a Pin Missile from Adamant Mega Heracross, an extremely strong attack, and also let it avoid being 2HKOed by a Double-Edge from Mega Kangaskhan. Safety Goggles can assure Cresselia is not shut down by Spore or Sleep Powder.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The main purpose of this set to provide Cresselia's partner with speed control and a boost to its attacks. However, Cresselia is also extremely useful in switching into most attacks thanks to its impressive bulk. Cresselia should slow the opposing Pokemon down with Icy Wind until its partner is able to outspeed them, before spamming Helping Hand to assist its partner in dealing major damage. Psyshock should only be used if it is super effective against the opposing Pokemon or if the enemy is within KO range.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set is most effective on offensive teams looking for a Pokemon that can take hits and provide speed control to aid with sweeping. Powerful attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Mawile, Landorus, Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, Azumarill, and Keldeo all enjoy speed control for beating faster checks. Speedy Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Keldeo or those with priority moves make good partners, as they can eliminate Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon before they inflict damage towards Cresselia with their powerful Dark-type STAB attacks. Fire-types such as Heatran and Talonflame are also helpful for taking care of annoying Steel-types that will support Cresselia such as Scizor. Earthquake users such as Landorus-T and Garchomp are able to spam Earthquake thanks to Levitate, while also taking care of Steel-types, notably Heatran. Garchomp appreciates speed control as well to outspeed and beat Latios.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>When Mega-Evolved, Mega Venusaur has the ability Thick Fat, which neuters Fire- and Ice-type moves, making it only weak to Flying-, Psychic-, and Teravolt Ice-type attacks. The combination of Thick Fat and its increased stats makes Mega Venusaur a fantastic tank, especially against rain teams, and as a win condition, meaning it's great at winning the game if you remove its checks. Alternatively, non-Mega Venusaur takes advantage of the ability Chlorophyll and its base 80 Speed to outspeed virtually anything when the sun is up. Venusaur has a great movepool with access to powerful STAB attacks as well as the useful support move Sleep Powder. Its non-Mega Chlorophyll set takes advantage of its high Speed to deal good damage and spread sleep, and it has strong offensive synergy with Mega Charizard Y. However, both formes are weak to common Fire- and Psychic-type threats, such as Talonflame and Cresselia, and are also reliant on Sleep Powder and Leech Seed to do anything against Steel-types.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Growth can be run on either set to make Venusaur a huge offensive threat, but it's typically not worth sacrificing a moveslot for. Leaf Storm can be run on Mega Venusaur to get OHKOes it wouldn't achieve with Giga Drain (such as against Rotom-W or Politoed), but it's pretty team-specific and not as reliable as Giga Drain overall. Wide Lens can be used instead of Life Orb to increase Sleep Powder's accuracy, but the decrease in power is very noticeable. Hidden Power Ground is one of Venusaur's few coverage options to hit Steel-types, mainly Heatran, but this is a weakness that's typically better covered by another teammate, since Venusaur does not want to give up any of its moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Powerful Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran threaten non-Mega Venusaur.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon: Psychic-types such as Latios and Cresselia can heavily dent Venusaur with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Common Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Metagross, and Aegislash are immune to Venusaur's Poison-type moves and resist Grass.

It can handily deal massive damage with its Gale Wings Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-B</strong>: Kyurem-B easily handles both formes of Venusaur, as Teravolt ignores Thick Fat.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Sand, rain, and hail remove Venusaur's Speed boost. However, Venusaur fares pretty well against Politoed one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Mega Kangaskhan fares well against Mega Venusaur, as it doesn't care about Mega Venusaur's resistances and deals too much damage for Mega Venusaur to tank, KOing with Fake Out + Double-Edge. However, Mega Kangaskhan doesn't like Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt users such as Thundurus and Sableye disable Venusaur's essential support moves.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Trick Room, Tailwind and paralysis users such as Cresselia, Thundurus, and Jirachi neuter Venusaur's high Speed and put it at a disadvantage.</p> <p><strong>Safety Goggles: Common Safety Goggles users such as Aegislash, Rotom-H, and Cresselia shut down Venusaur's sleep spam strategies, and many of the common Safety Goggles users also have typing advantages against Venusaur.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Giga Drain's recovery adds to Mega Venusaur's already impressive bulk. Sludge Bomb is Mega Venusaur's strongest STAB move, allowing it to deal with threatening Fairies and also possibly poison foes to aid residual damage from Leech Seed. Sleep Powder is an excellent support move in the Doubles metagame, which doesn't have a Sleep clause, and thanks to Mega Venusaur's improved bulk, it's great at spreading sleep. Leech Seed can be used instead of Sleep Powder as a means of both passive damage and recovery for Mega Venusaur and its teammate's switch-ins. Protect keeps Mega Venusaur safe while its partner deals with any possible threats, such as Talonflame. Synthesis is another option, as it provides more reliable recovery and adds to Mega Venusaur's already great bulk. However, it should only be used beside Sleep Powder, as the recovery granted from Leech Seed + Giga Drain is typically enough for Protect to be more useful in the last slot.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Venusaurite is required in order for Venusaur to Mega Evolve. Thick Fat neutralizes Mega Venusaur's biggest weaknesses, Fire- and Ice-type moves, making it only weak against Psychic- and Flying-type attacks. The given HP and Defense EV investment allows Mega Venusaur to live a Life Orb Brave Bird from Talonflame, while 52 Speed EVs let Mega Venusaur outrun standard Rotom-W. The remaining EVs are invested into Special Attack which, with a Modest nature, lets Mega Venusaur deal as much damage as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Venusaur works excellently late-game, as it walls most weakened Pokemon and can then stall with Leech Seed or Synthesis or spam Sludge Bomb. With Sleep Powder, it also can be used early-game to put threats to sleep, allowing you to gain momentum. Mega Venusaur is a fantastic rain counter, able to wall or defeat big rain threats such as Mega Swampert, Kingdra, and Ludicolo. Choosing to not Mega Evolve Venusaur can also help you get an edge against opposing sun teams.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran is a good partner to Mega Venusaur due to the fact that it can dish out a super-effective Heat Wave versus Steel-types that Mega Venusaur would normally have some trouble against, such as Aegislash, Genesect, and Ferrothorn. Heatran also brings some useful resistances to the table that Mega Venusaur appreciates, most notably resistances to Psychic- and Flying-type attacks. Mega Venusaur also helps Heatran in return by being arguably the best counter to Rain teams in the metagame, against which Heatran is often dead weight. Quick Guard users such as Keldeo or Terrakion can assist Mega Venusaur by protecting it from Talonflame's Brave Bird. Keldeo and Terrakion are also capable of getting rid of Mega Kangaskhan, who hits Mega Venusaur too hard to be tanked, and Kyurem-B, who hits Mega Venusaur with a super effective STAB Ice Beam, thanks to Teravolt. Terrakion in particular also helps remove Mega Charizard Y. Furthermore, Keldeo, Terrakion, or other Pokemon that resist Fire-type attacks like Suicune can get rid of certain Fire-types that Mega Venusaur does not fare well against, especially Heatran. In return, Mega Venusaur helps Terrakion and Keldeo by easily switching into Mega Diancie and bulky Water-types. Rotom-W, Thundurus, or other Electric-types can switch into Flying-types for Mega Venusaur, increasing its longevity. Powerful Dark- and Ghost-types such as Bisharp, Aegislash, and Darkrai can get rid of Psychic-type threats, specifically Latios and Cresselia.</p> "

Giga Drain's recovery adds to Venusaur's already impressive bulk and offsets Venusaur's Life Orb damage. Leaf Storm can be used instead to achieve OHKOs that Venusaur wouldn't normally get against Pokemon such as Landorus-T. Sleep Powder is an excellent support move in the Doubles metagame, where there is no Sleep Clause, and Venusaur is almost always guaranteed to go before your target in the sun. It has less-than-ideal accuracy, but it helps maintain momentum by stopping Pokemon which Venusaur cannot KO and makes Venusaur useful against Steel-types, which wall its STAB attacks. Protect keeps Venusaur safe while its partner deals with any potential threats and while Charizard Mega Evolves to get sun up.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Speed investment makes Venusaur one of the fastest Pokemon in the game while sun is up, outspeeding up to Jolly Scarf Landorus-T. Full investment in Special Attack, a Modest nature, and a Life Orb allow Venusaur to become a powerful offensive threat. The remaining EVs are put into HP to allow Venusaur to make the most of its good defensive typing and ability to switch in on Water-types, especially Politoed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Sun is essential for Venusaur to reach its full potential, as its Speed is its greatest asset. It functions best as a lead to apply offensive pressure or to sleep spam threats, allowing you to gain momentum. It's also great at walling Pokemon such as Amoonguss, as its Grass typing makes Venusaur immune to powder moves. Lastly, be cautious against foes that might have Safety Goggles, such as Rotom-H and Cresselia.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Venusaur should always be paired with Mega Charizard Y, as it's the only viable Drought user in the tier. Venusaur and Mega Charizard Y also have excellent synergy. Venusaur checks Rock-types, particularly Mega Diancie and Terrakion, for Mega Charizard Y, as well as Water-types that resist Mega Charizard Y's Fire-type attacks, particularly Politoed, which can replace the sun, and serves as a Trick Room check with Sleep Powder. In return, Mega Charizard Y checks Steel-types, such as Aegislash and Ferrothorn, for Venusaur. Venusaur can also put Pokemon that threaten both Mega Charizard Y and Venusaur to sleep. If the sun is up, Venusaur can switch into resisted hits, as well as Amoonguss and Breloom thanks to Venusaur's immunity to powder moves. Heatran and Talonflame checks are extremely important because they counter both Venusaur and Mega Charizard Y. Good checks include Gyarados, Rotom-W, Quick Guard Keldeo, Landorus-T, and Terrakion. Terrakion checks Rotom-H, Talonflame, and Heatran and has its Water weakness removed in the sun. Venusaur in return checks Fairy- and Water-types that threaten it.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>In Doubles OU, while Mega Charizard Y is one of the top three Mega Pokemon and is one of the best Pokemon in the metagame period, Mega Charizard X serves as more of a niche option and needs heavy team support to work at its best. One of Mega Charizard Y's key selling points is Drought, which gives it excellent utility as a weather setter and, more importantly, complements its already powerful Special Attack by providing a 50% damage boost to its Fire-type moves, which lets its Heat Wave take huge chunks of HP out of any opposing Pokemon that does not resist it. What Mega Charizard X brings to the table is the fact that it is a physical setup sweeper that is immune to burns, though its typing is also very useful, as it reduces Charizard's 4x Rock-type weakness to a 2x weakness, removes its Electric- and Water-type weaknesses (though Drought reduces the Water-type weakness on Mega Charizard Y as well), and gives it a neutrality to Fairy despite it being a Dragon-type. Mega Charizard X also has a very useful surprise factor, as opponents may find their typical Charizard counters, such as Electric-types, ineffective against Mega Charizard X. However, Charizard does have its share of problems, notably its middling Speed when compared to threats such as Mega Diancie and Mega Metagross. Mega Diancie in particular is common and powerful, which forces Charizard teams to play extra carefully. Charizard also has weaknesses to a few common offensive types, with Mega Charizard Y being weak to Electric-, Rock-, and Water-type moves and Mega Charizard X being weak to Rock-, Dragon-, and Ground-type moves. In addition, Charizard does not take neutral hits particularly well, meaning that you have to be careful when bringing Charizard on to the field. Mega Charizard X also has the unfortunate issue of having its best attack, Flare Blitz, wear it down quickly due to recoil.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>On Mega Charizard Y, Fire Blast can be used over Overheat, as it still hits really hard and does not drop Charizard's Special Attack, though it is slightly weaker and has shakier accuracy. Flamethrower can also be used to get around Wide Guard, and it deals significant single-target damage without any of the drawbacks of Overheat or Fire Blast, but it is quite a bit weaker than both. Sunny Day and Tailwind are also interesting choices on Mega Charizard Y; Tailwind makes up for its mediocre base Speed, and Sunny Day provides a way to punish Politoed switch-ins. Focus Blast is an alternative move that provides coverage against Pokemon that can take Charizard's other attacks with ease, such as Heatran and Tyranitar. Mega Charizard X can run Earthquake so that it is not hard countered by Heatran. Fire Punch can be used over Flare Blitz if you do not want to deal with the recoil, but it is much much weaker. Roost can be used for longevity on either Mega Evolution; it is particularly helpful on Mega Charizard X due to the recoil from Flare Blitz. Will-O-Wisp is also an option to punish certain switch-ins, but it is not very reliable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Mega Charizard Y suffers from limited coverage, which lets certain foes such as Latios and Hydreigon switch in and hit it back with minimal risk. They can also OHKO Mega Charizard X with Draco Meteor, though they have to watch out for Dragon Claw.</p> <p><strong>Heatran: Heatran can easily switch in and set up on both Mega Charizard formes, but it only fully counters Mega Charizard Y lacking Focus Blast or Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Politoed completely shuts down Mega Charizard Y, weakening its Fire-type STAB attacks in addition to rendering Solar Beam virtually useless. Tyranitar can easily switch in on Mega Charizard Y, lacking Focus Blast. Mega Charizard X has a slightly better matchup versus opposing weather setters, though rain forces it to rely on Dragon Claw.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Terrakion, Deoxys-A, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Mega Diancie can outspeed and deal massive damage to both Charizard formes, if not outright OHKO them. Maximum Speed Mega Kangaskhan outspeeds standard Charizard and deals massive damage to both formes as well, and Sucker Punch lets it pick off weakened Charizard if it fails to OHKO it. Talonflame can always outrun both forms of Charizard and dish out massive damage. Weather sweepers such as Ludicolo and Excadrill can outrun and OHKO Charizard in rain and sand, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Trick Room lets slow opposing Pokemon such as Rhyperior, Mega Camerupt, and Mega Ampharos outrun and deal massive damage to, if not OHKO, both Charizard formes. With Tailwind support, Pokemon that would normally be beaten by Charizard, such as fast Rhyperior, are able to outspeed and KO it. Neither forme wants to be hit with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock and Wide Guard: Although it's uncommon, Stealth Rock severely reduces Mega Charizard Y's staying power, taking just shy of 50% of its HP every time it switches in. Encore can lock Mega Charizard X into Dragon Dance, forcing it to either switch out or stall out. Wide Guard prevents Mega Charizard Y from spamming Heat Wave, which is what it will normally be doing.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Heat Wave provides Mega Charizard Y with a reliable STAB attack, and because it is a spread move boosted under the sun, it allows Mega Charizard Y to deal massive amounts of combined damage against the opposing team. Solar Beam hits the Water- and Rock-type Pokemon that resist Heat Wave for super effective damage. Overheat provides Charizard with a \"nuke\" option, as it is able to deal huge damage against even Pokemon that resist it. Hidden Power Ground can be used to beat opposing Heatran, which otherwise wall it. Lastly, Protect allows Charizard to scout for moves, block Fake Out and status inflictions, and stall out opposing field conditions.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP EVs and 64 Def EVs allow Mega Charizard Y to always survive a Return from Adamant Mega Kangaskhan. 108 Speed EVs ensure that Charizard always outruns maximum Speed Breloom, as well as other positive-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon, which allows it to KO Breloom before being hit by Spore. The remaining EVs are dumped placed into Special Attack to hit as hard as possible. 248 HP EVs are the most EVs possible that still allow Charizard to switch in on Stealth Rock twice, though Stealth Rock is incredibly rare in Doubles OU. Alternative spreads include the traditional 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid or Modest nature, though that spread is not very effective in the current metagame, and another spread of 248 HP / 144 Def / 8 SpA / 108 Spe, which allows Charizard to always survive a Rock Slide from an Adamant Landorus-T and have a 50% chance to OHKO back with Overheat.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y is an incredibly simple Pokemon to use; generally, the hardest part of using it is finding the right time to get it onto the field. However, once Mega Charizard Y is in, the goal is to spam Heat Wave until something on the opposing side forces Charizard out, as a sun-boosted Heat Wave takes large chunks of HP out of both opposing Pokemon, assuming that neither foe resists it. Coverage options are used when needed, though you should be careful when using Solar Beam if the opposing team has a sand or rain setter, as Solar Beam takes two turns to charge instead of one without sun. Overheat should only be used when you desperately need something KOed or if you are okay with switching Charizard out immediately afterwards. Use Protect when needed, such as to scout for an opposing weather setter to switch in before you Mega Evolve Charizard. During weather wars, it is a generally good idea to keep Charizard in the back to switch in once the opposing team has already set their weather, as Charizard can then come in to negate it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Venusaur is an excellent partner for Mega Charizard Y due to Chlorophyll doubling Venusaur's Speed under sun, and they cover each other's weaknesses well. Venusaur can switch in on most common Electric-type attacks easily, and under the sun it can outspeed and deal heavy damage to a lot of common Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon. It also has access to Sleep Powder, so it can act as a buffer against Trick Room teams, which give Mega Charizard Y trouble. Heatran enjoys using sun-boosted Heat Waves and, together with Charizard Y, creates a devastating offensive force under the sun. Aegislash is an excellent partner for Mega Charizard Y, as it is an excellent check to Rock-types (namely Diancie), works well against Trick Room and all other manners of speed control, and also has access to Wide Guard, which helps Charizard against Diancie and Rock Slide users. Scrafty is a good partner due to its access to Intimidate, which helps versus physical attackers, as well as being able to work effectively against Rock-types apart from Diancie. Terrakion is also a good partner, as it can break past the likes of Heatran, Kangaskhan, and Tyranitar with ease, and its own Water-type weakness is mitigated by Drought. Both Rhydon and Rhyperior make for good partners for Mega Charizard Y, as they both have access to Lightning Rod to redirect Electric-type moves from Charizard and are able to beat common Charizard checks, particularly Diancie, with ease. Cresselia is a good option due to its bulk and access to Icy Wind and Thunder Wave, both of which alleviate Mega Charizard Y's issues against fast Pokemon. Calm Mind Cresselia also enjoys Drought, as Moonlight recovers more HP in the sun. Latios also pairs well with Mega Charizard Y and can support it with Tailwind. Landorus-T can support Mega Charizard Y thanks to its ability to beat threatening Rock-types, access to a fast pivoting move and Intimidate, and immunity to Electric-type attacks. Charizard appreciates Wide Guard, with the most noteworthy user being Aegislash. Lastly, Quash / Will-O-Wisp Sableye is a fun partner for Charizard, as Quash allows Charizard to move ahead of Pokemon that can otherwise beat it and OHKO them with Overheat, and Will-O-Wisp can severely cripple physical attackers, which affords Charizard more room to operate, as it then does not have to worry as much about physical attacks.</p> "

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Flare Blitz is Mega Charizard X's strongest attack and can OHKO most of the metagame after one boost. Dragon Claw is a safe move to use if your opponent's team is already weakened, and unlike Flare Blitz, it doesn't have recoil, allowing Mega Charizard X to stick around longer. Dragon Dance boosts Mega Charizard X's Attack and Speed, making it very threatening. Protect allows Mega Charizard X to scout for moves, block Fake Out and status inflictions, and stall out opposing field conditions.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mega Charizard X has maximum Attack investment in order to help it to hit as hard as possible. The Speed investment allows it to outspeed all Deoxys-A at +1, and Hydreigon at +0. An Adamant nature is used over a Jolly one, as Dragon Dance makes up for the initial loss in Speed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The key to using Mega Charizard X is to find a free turn to set up a Dragon Dance before proceeding to break apart the opposing team. Free turns can be found against Electric-types and certain Water-types; for example, both Swampert and Keldeo can deal massive damage to Mega Charizard X, but Suicune struggles to dish out relevant damage to it. A useful thing to remember is that most people assume Charizard will be holding Charizardite Y, so use that to your advantage, such as by setting up on Wide Guard users. Generally speaking, it is best to keep Mega Charizard X in the back until its checks and counters have been weakened or KOed and it is able to set up and clean the rest of the opposing team. Saving it for later also maintains the mind game as to whether it's Mega Charizard Y or Mega Charizard X.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Clefairy and Amoonguss are viable users of Follow Me or Rage Powder and can drastically ease Mega Charizard X's setup; Clefairy can bolster Charizard's Defense thanks to Friend Guard, and Amoonguss can help it set up Dragon Dance with Spore support as well. Aegislash is an excellent partner for Mega Charizard X, as it is an excellent check to Rock-types (namely Diancie), works well against Trick Room and all other methods of speed control, and also has access to Wide Guard, which helps Charizard out against Diancie and Rock Slide users. Scrafty is a good partner due to its access to Intimidate, which helps versus physical attackers, as well as its ability to work effectively against Rock-types besides Diancie. Terrakion is also a good partner, as it can break past the likes of Heatran, Kangaskhan, and Tyranitar with ease. Both Rhydon and Rhyperior make for good partners for Mega Charizard X, as they both have access to Lightning Rod to redirect Thunder Wave away from Charizard and are able to beat common Charizard checks, such as Diancie, with ease. Cresselia is a good option due to its bulk and access to Icy Wind and Thunder Wave, both of which alleviate Mega Charizard X's issues against fast Pokemon. Landorus-T can support Mega Charizard X thanks to its ability to beat threatening Rock-types and its access to both a fast pivoting move and Intimidate, though it has to be careful about using Earthquake, as Mega Charizard X is not immune to Ground-type attacks. Charizard appreciates Wide Guard support, with the most noteworthy user being Aegislash. Defiant and Competitive users such as Bisharp and Milotic can make for good partners for Mega Charizard X by discouraging opponents from bringing in Intimidate users. Bisharp also works well against common Trick Room setters and can put opposing Pokemon that survive a +1 Flare Blitz into KO range thanks to its powerful Sucker Punch. Milotic does a good job at breaking past bulkier Rock-types thanks to its Water typing, and it also beats Heatran, which otherwise walls Mega Charizard X with ease. Water-types such as Keldeo and Azumarill also help to beat Heatran as well; Keldeo can also use Quick Guard to spare Charizard from Prankster Thunder Wave from Thundurus-I.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Raichu is one of the fastest Fake Out users, sporting a base Speed of 110 that lets it outspeed the likes of Mega Kangaskhan and Infernape. It also has Lightning Rod, which neuters opposing Electric-types by redirecting Electric-type attacks, benefiting teams that struggle with foes such as Thundurus. With access to a good utility movepool containing options such as Fake Out, Encore, Nuzzle, and Feint, Raichu controls game flow and provides speed control. On the other hand, its poor bulk leaves it easily KOed by strong attacks such as Mega Kangaskhan's Return and Talonflame's Flare Blitz. In addition, Raichu provides little offensive pressure by itself, as it lacks the ability to deal meaningful damage and is walled by Grass- and Ground-types. Compared to other Electric-types in the metagame—Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Zapdos—Raichu lacks the natural Ground immunity, bulk, and offensive pressure the other options provide, making it a niche option for teams requiring its specific support.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Ice is a possible coverage move, but it's unpopular because Choice Scarf Landorus-T can easily move before Raichu and U-turn out. In addition, Hidden Power Ice doesn't pick up the KO on Landorus-T even with maximum Special Attack investment. Protect is useful on nearly every Doubles Pokemon, and despite its already difficult task of picking only four moves, Raichu can also use it to decent success.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Threats faster than Raichu, such as Talonflame and Landorus-T and even weather sweepers such as Swift Swim Ludicolo and Chlorophyll Venusaur, do not need to worry about a large portion of its utility moves and can threaten to OHKO it, nullifying its ability to properly support its partner.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out: Not running Protect leaves Raichu with little counterplay to opposing Fake Out. In addition, Kangaskhan with Inner Focus can ignore Raichu's Fake Out because it cannot flinch.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Amoonguss and Ferrothorn are generally unafraid of being paralyzed and can slowly take out Raichu.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Landorus are immune to Nuzzle and can simply OHKO Raichu.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Gengar are immune to both Fake Out and Feint.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Nice access to one of the fastest Fake Outs lets Raichu outspeed other Fake Out users and immobilize a foe for a turn nearly without fail, giving Raichu's partner room to set up or go on the offensive without being hindered. Encore locks a foe into the same move for three turns, possibly forcing it to use a suboptimal move. An Electric-type STAB move in the form of Volt Switch or Thunderbolt enables Raichu to still be an offensive threat to frailer foes, such as Talonflame and Azumarill. Volt Switch lets Raichu pivot to refresh Fake Out and bring in a partner; alternatively, Thunderbolt deals more damage and, when combined with more Special Attack EVs, picks up the KO on threats such as Talonflame. In addition, Thunderbolt is a better option for situations where Raichu does not wish to switch out. Nuzzle lets Raichu provide speed control for a team and reduce its tendency to suck momentum, even hitting Mega Diancie where Thunder Wave cannot due to bypassing Magic Bounce in addition to Taunt. Feint breaks Protect, making it a good option for applying offensive pressure while also synergizing with the threat of Fake Out. Feint is especially helpful for partners that use single-target attacks, such as Mega Kangaskhan, which benefit from Raichu breaking Protect.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Lightning Rod redirects Electric-type attacks, neutering the offensive pressure of opposing Electric-types such as Thundurus. Maximum Speed EVs and a Timid nature let Raichu Speed tie with the competitive base 110 Speed tier, which includes threats such as Latios and Mega Diancie. The remainder is put into HP to alleviate Raichu's poor bulk, letting it survive attacks like Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave. An alternative set with maximum Special Attack instead of HP is recommended if using Thunderbolt, to pick up the KO on Talonflame. Air Balloon is useful for discouraging opposing Choice Scarf Landorus-T from locking itself into Earthquake, forcing a U-turn or a Rock Slide, both of which Raichu is relatively unafraid of. On the other hand, Focus Sash is a good catch-all defensive item for surviving any powerful attack, including not only Landorus-T's Earthquake but also Talonflame's Flare Blitz.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Raichu's Fake Out support is key to helping allies set up—such as through Belly Drum, Swords Dance, Tailwind, or Substitute—or to maintain offensive pressure. Due to Raichu's access to Encore, its Fake Out is especially threatening, as foes cannot stall out the Fake Out turn with Protect. Feint can punish Protects as well. Although opposing Pokemon will want to double Protect on Raichu's Fake Out, Encore combined with a high Speed allows Raichu to lock foes into Protect, making them effectively useless for three turns or until they switch out. In addition, Encore is useful for locking foes into Fake Out, which doesn't work after the first turn out, or setup moves such as Belly Drum and Substitute, and for locking foes into resisted moves or Electric-type moves, either for Raichu's partner or itself. Thus, Raichu should be used for building up offensive pressure and providing the necessary support to its partner. With Volt Switch, Raichu can take advantage of its rotational power to keep itself healthy and refresh Fake Out, coming in when the support is needed and avoiding situations where it becomes a momentum sink, unable to impact the field. For example, Raichu can't threaten certain fast threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Talonflame and bulkier threats such as Aegislash and Amoonguss, all of which either outspeed and KO it first or are relatively untouched by anything from its movepool. Be careful when bringing Raichu in on attacks, as its poor bulk and negligible resistances leave it susceptible to being KOed on the switch. Instead, mostly use it as a lead or switch it in after a partner is KOed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Water- and Flying-types, such as Azumarill and Talonflame, that benefit from Lightning Rod incapacitating opposing Electric-types such as Thundurus make for very good partners for Raichu. Fake Out support is good for partners that appreciate the free setup opportunities, such as Belly Drum Azumarill, Power-Up Punch Mega Kangaskhan, and Substitute users such as Heatran and Kyurem-B. Unlike other Electric-types, Raichu has a poor matchup against Talonflame, being outsped and OHKOed by Flare Blitz, so good Talonflame checks such as Landorus-T and Mega Diancie help alleviate this weakness. Raichu is incapable of threatening Amoonguss, so Amoonguss checks and switch-ins that are immune to Spore such as Safety Goggles Jirachi compensate for Raichu's poor Amoonguss matchup. Other Pokemon that can threaten to KO Amoonguss such as Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y also are good options.</p> "

Clefairy also has access to useful support moves such as Follow Me, Heal Pulse, and Helping Hand, which allow it to be a useful addition to a lot of teams. Even though Clefairy cannot viably carry any other items apart from Eviolite, it has a small niche in being slightly bulkier than Clefable with it, which is very useful in many situations, as Clefairy can heal its teammate after taking a hit or redirect very powerful moves that Clefable cannot. Friend Guard also provides an additional damage reduction to powerful spread attacks such as Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave and Landorus-T's Earthquake. However, Clefairy has very bad offensive stats and finds itself restricted to supportive roles only, which makes it Taunt bait.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder Wave can be used as permanent speed control; however, it is blocked by Taunt and can only target one Pokemon at a time. Moonlight can be used to provide recovery and help Clefairy stay around for longer, but it is hindered by rain and is also stopped by Taunt. Moonblast can be used to deal solid damage to Hydreigon and Scrafty while also preventing Bisharp from switching in for an easy boost from Defiant. However, Clefairy can easily redirect moves from Hydreigon and Scrafty anyway, so Icy Wind is usually the more reliable option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Clefairy can easily lose to Steel-types such as Aegislash, Bisharp, and Mega Metagross, as they are all capable of 2HKOing or even OHKOing it. Heatran also sets up for free on Clefairy, as it doesn't care about Follow Me because it uses Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Because Clefairy relies on support moves to be useful and has no offensive presence, it can be made useless when Taunt are used against it.</p> <p><strong>Spread Attackers</strong>: Clefairy is incapable of redirecting spread moves from the likes of Mega Charizard Y, Landorus-T, and Heatran and is usually dead weight against them.</p> ",

Clefairy has very low offensive presence; however, Icy Wind allows it to slow down opposing Pokemon and prevents it from being forced out, even after it has been hit by Taunt. Heal Pulse allows Clefairy to heal its teammates by 50% and help them stay on the field longer when combined with Friend Guard. Alternatively, Helping Hand helps Clefairy's teammates deal more damage and potentially net OHKOs that they usually couldn't get. Protect gives Clefairy longevity, can help provide free turns, and keeps Friend Guard active for longer.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs and 192 Defense EVs coupled with Eviolite allow Clefairy to always survive Life Orb Bisharp's Iron Head, while the remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to allow Clefairy to survive Aegislash's Flash Cannon. Eviolite provides Clefairy with slightly more bulk than Clefable. Friend Guard boosts Clefairy's teammates' bulk and gives it a niche over Clefable. An EV spread of 252 HP / 152 Def / 104 SpD with a Calm nature can be used, as it allows Clefairy to still survive Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge and provides a lot more special bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Clefairy should only be used for Friend Guard to help its teammates set up; otherwise, a different Follow Me user such as Clefable or Togekiss should be used. Friend Guard is only active when Clefairy is on the field, so keeping it safe by using Protect against powerful opposing Pokemon such as Bisharp and Mega Metagross can give its teammate an opportunity to heavily damage them. Follow Me should be used to allow teammates to set up or prevent them from taking damage from powerful attacks. If there is an opportunity for Clefairy's teammate to OHKO an opposing Pokemon, use Helping Hand. Do not be afraid to lose Clefairy, as it has only one job in supporting its teammates, and if it faints while doing so, it means that it has done its job.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Strong attackers that have good bulk such as Mega Charizard Y and Mega Kangaskhan work well with Follow Me and Friend Guard support. Mega Charizard Y can take out the Steel-types that threaten Clefairy and has more opportunities to spam Heat Wave when aided by Clefairy's redirection support. Mega Kangaskhan can set up with Power-Up Punch against the opposing team while Clefairy redirects their moves. Substitute users such as Heatran and Kyurem-B appreciate the ability to set up for free with redirection support, and both of them are very bulky with Friend Guard active. Belly Drum Azumarill can get free turns to set up with Belly Drum and becomes difficult to take down because Friend Guard boosts its already good bulk. Clefairy fits best on offensive teams because it has next to no offensive presence and its teammates appreciate the extra bulk.</p> "

  "Clefable": {
    "overview": "<p>In Doubles OU, Clefable finds itself as an effective Follow Me user thanks to a solid defensive typing coupled with good mixed defenses. However, what separates Clefable from other Follow Me users is its access to Unaware, which lets Clefable ignore the opposing Pokemon's stat changes. This allows Clefable to work as a quick stop to opposing setup sweepers such as Belly Drum Azumarill and Power-Up Punch Mega Kangaskhan, simultaneously stopping the opposing team's strategies and protecting Clefable's partner from taking hits. In addition to that, Clefable has a wide variety of other useful moves such as Thunder Wave, Helping Hand, Icy Wind, Encore, and Safeguard, letting it provide support when Follow Me is unneeded. However, Unaware has the downside of ignoring opposing Pokemon's stat drops too. This means that unless an opposing Pokemon has had its Attack reduced by a burn, Clefable will almost always be taking hits from +0 even against foes at -1 or -2, whereas other Follow Me users take reduced hits from the foes in the same situation. When considering Follow Me users, teams that are in need of a way to stop Pokemon that prefer to set up and sweep should strongly consider Clefable; however, teams that are not in need of that particular niche should instead consider Togekiss and Clefairy as Fairy-type Follow Me users.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Moonlight is an option that allows Clefable to recover HP and continue to redirect hits. Encore can be used to lock threats into unfavorable moves, such as locking Dragon-types into Draco Meteor or Trick Room users into Trick Room. Clefable can use Ice Beam and 92 Special Attack EVs to always OHKO standard Choice Scarf Landorus-T, which does not particularly mind Clefable's redirection; however, this requires giving up Moonblast or Protect. Icy Wind is an alternative form of speed control and has the benefit of not being blocked by Taunt; however, it leaves Clefable even more vulnerable to Bisharp, and Clefable's poor Speed means that it still cannot outrun most relevant threats. Rocky Helmet allows Clefable to land chip damage against physical attackers with Follow Me, though losing the recovery of Sitrus Berry significantly reduces Clefable's overall longevity. Magic Guard can be used to redirect burns away from physical attackers without taking any residual damage and, unlike Unaware, is compatible with Soft-Boiled. Safeguard is an option to block status conditions for the whole team, but Clefable is slower than most common status spreaders aside from Amoonguss. Moves such as Aromatherapy, Heal Pulse, and Healing Wish allow Clefable to fulfill a somewhat clerical role. Healing Wish in particular allows Clefable to completely revive a weakened teammate once Clefable has fulfilled its usefulness in a battle.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-type Pokemon such as Aegislash, Mega Metagross, and Heatran can easily switch into Clefable and either deal severe damage to it or take advantage of it by setting up.

Moonblast is used as the primary attacking option and allows Clefable to KO Dragon-types such as Hydreigon as opposed to just redirecting their attacks. Helping Hand is used to allow Clefable's partners to attain KOs that would normally be out of reach, though Thunder Wave is also an option as a means of providing speed control, crippling opposing sweepers that like to rely on their Speed advantage. Protect is used to stall out field effects, to scout for moves, and to allow Clefable's partner to take out a foe that threatens Clefable.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The HP and Special Defense EVs let Clefable always survive a sun-boosted Overheat from Timid Mega Charizard Y with the remaining EVs put into Defense in order to survive attacks such as Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Double Edge or an Iron Head from Focus Sash Bisharp. Unaware is used to ignore the stat boosts of opposing setup Pokemon, and a Sitrus Berry is used to increase Clefable's overall longevity. Safety Goggles may be used in place of a Sitrus Berry to allow Clefable to redirect Sleep-inducing moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When using Clefable, Follow Me is used primarily to prevent Clefable's partner from taking hits that would otherwise severely damage or KO it and to let it safely KO an opposing Pokemon or set up; however, Follow Me does not prevent the partner from taking damage from spread moves, such as Heat Wave and Earthquake. Helping Hand should be used cautiously, especially if the opposing Pokemon is able to use a guaranteed Protect, so as not to give your opponent a free turn. Helping Hand is best used as a means of picking up a surprise KO against foes that would otherwise survive an attack. Moonblast can be used both as a means of picking up KOs on certain threats and as a way of getting in chip damage to bring opposing Pokemon into KO range of Clefable's partner. It can also be used in situations where Follow Me and Helping Hand either are unhelpful or cannot be used but switching to a different Pokemon is too risky. Clefable can also be used as an emergency check to boosted Pokemon such as a +2 Mega Kangaskhan or a +6 Azumarill, especially if it has a partner that threatens them, as the combination of Follow Me and Unaware negates the stat boosts and prevents the opposing Pokemon from using a priority attacks to take out Clefable's partner. One thing to be aware of is that Unaware Clefable also ignores stat drops, such as ones caused by Intimidate, on the opposing Pokemon, so do not expect Clefable to take hits more easily with a partner's Intimidate.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Setup sweepers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Azumarill like having Clefable as a partner, as it allows them to safely set up and also prevents opposing setup sweepers from threatening them. Kyurem-B also makes for a good partner, as Clefable can effortlessly redirect opposing Fighting- and Dragon-type moves to let Kyurem-B safely set up a Substitute, while Kyurem-B can beat threatening Steel-types with Earth Power, as well as Poison-types such as Venusaur and Amoonguss with Ice Beam. Hydreigon also appreciates how easily Clefable redirects Fighting- and Dragon-type moves, allowing it to attack the opposing team without much worry. Pokemon that are capable of beating Steel-types are especially welcome partners for Clefable, so Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, and Heatran all pair well with it. Mega Diancie is another good partner, as it's a frail Pokemon that enjoys redirection and can easily beat common Taunt users such as Thundurus, Keldeo, and Terrakion.</p> "

  "Rhydon": {
    "overview": "<p>For teams that have issues dealing with Electric-type attacks or paralysis, Rhydon is a good choice for a Lightning Rod user thanks to its incredible Eviolite-boosted bulk that exceeds that of Rhyperior, its evolved form. Rhydon is no slouch offensively either due to its strong STAB spread moves, Rock Slide and Earthquake, and its naturally high Attack stat. However, Rhydon suffers from weaknesses to common types such as Water and Fighting, which compromises its bulk somewhat. Rhydon is also weak to Ground-type moves, but they are not a major issue; the most common Ground-type attack is Earthquake, which is both physical and reduced in power due to being a spread attack, and so it deals pittance to Rhydon. It is also vulnerable to burns and Intimidate, and despite being an excellent choice against most Electric-types, such as Zapdos and Thundurus, it has an awful time against Rotom-W, which is one of the most popular Electric-types. However, Rhydon is not used primarily to check Electric-type Pokemon but rather Electric-type moves such as Thunder Wave, which can come from Pokemon such as Jirachi. Rhydon is also quite slow, with a terrible base 40 Speed; normally, this would be useful with Trick Room, but in Rhydon's case, the Pokemon that appreciate its Lightning Rod support tend to be faster, so that option is not as easy to use. Accordingly, Rhydon should only be used if your team really benefits from Lightning Rod support. If looking for a Pokemon to use under Trick Room, Life Orb Rhyperior should be used over Rhydon due to its much higher damage output.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hammer Arm helps Rhydon check 4 HP Mega Kangaskhan by 2HKOing it. It also hits some other noteworthy Pokemon hard, such as Hydreigon and Ferrothorn, and Rhydon doesn't mind the Speed drop due to its already terrible Speed stat. Superpower is an alternative to Hammer Arm for better power and accuracy, but Rhydon does not enjoy the Attack and Defense drops because it needs the bulk, and it doesn't OHKO Mega Kangaskhan without prior damage. Substitute punishes switching and helps Rhydon avoid burns and Intimidate, though Rhydon has no way of recovering HP. Megahorn deals large damage against Pokemon such as Cresselia, Hydreigon, Latios, and Ludicolo. Fire Punch can be used if you really want to hit Ferrothorn, Genesect, and Scizor harder. Lastly, Rock Blast is an option to more easily get past Pokemon with Focus Sash, such as Weavile, but its damage output is inconsistent.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Water-types such as Keldeo, Suicune, and Rotom-W can easily KO Rhydon with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Amoonguss, Venusaur, and Ferrothorn can all stomach an attack from Rhydon and hit back hard with a super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Bulky Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr can tank Rhydon's attacks and dent it with their own STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: If Rhydon does not run Ice Punch, Landorus-T and Garchomp also become effective checks, though without a boosting item they are very unlikely to 2HKO Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Rhydon's physical prowess is neutered by burn. Sableye outspeeds Rhydon even in Trick Room thanks to Prankster, whereas Gourgeist-S can tank any of Rhydon's attacks. Pokemon such as Scrafty, Landorus-T, and Gyarados can easily weaken Rhydon's STAB moves with Intimidate, though Gyarados must watch out for Rock-type attacks and Landorus-T must watch out for Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard: Wide Guard from Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Aegislash blocks Earthquake and Rock Slide. However, Aegislash should watch out for Drill Run.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is a hard-hitting STAB move that can get around Follow Me users and inflict damage on both opposing Pokemon by virtue of being a spread move. However, Drill Run can be used over Earthquake to avoid hitting Rhydon's partner and avoid Wide Guard users such as Aegislash, though Rhydon should be careful about using Drill Run against Aegislash because of King's Shield. Drill Run is the recommended choice if you don't have at least two Pokemon on your team immune to Earthquake. Rock Slide is another spread move, and it provides good coverage in tandem with Rhydon's Ground-type move, particularly against Flying-types. Stone Edge deals much more damage than Rock Slide against a single target and avoids Wide Guard, but it has worse accuracy. When using Rhydon, it's usually best to run Earthquake with Stone Edge and Drill Run with Rock Slide so that Rhydon has access to a spread move while avoiding having both its STAB moves blocked by Wide Guard. Ice Punch is primarily used for Landorus-T, which is otherwise a big issue for Rhydon. It also hits some other important Pokemon, such as Amoonguss and Hydreigon, harder and more reliably than its STAB moves. Rhydon can also run dual Rock-type or dual Ground-type attacks instead of Ice Punch if Landorus-T is already covered by Rhydon's team. Protect is mandatory to let Rhydon protect itself against its common weaknesses and keep it alive so that it can continue to provide Lightning Rod support.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>184 HP EVs let Rhydon avoid the 2HKO from Landorus-T's Earthquake, and 200 Attack EVs paired with an Adamant nature let Rhydon OHKO Zapdos with Stone Edge. The remaining EVs are placed into its weaker Special Defense stat to maximize its all-around bulk. Lightning Rod is Rhydon's niche, protecting its partners from Electric-type attacks and Thunder Wave. Otherwise, it faces intense competition from other Ground- and Rock-types such as Landorus-T and Terrakion. Rhydon can be used with a Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs to fare better against Trick Room teams. While this is also helpful if using Rhydon with Trick Room, Rhyperior is better suited for Trick Room teams due to its higher damage output; also note that protection from Thunder Wave is generally not helpful for Trick Room teams.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is recommended to have Rhydon on the field when you want to protect one of your Pokemon from a predicted Electric-type attack; use Rhydon's resistances and immunities to switch it in and redirect the incoming attack. Try to keep Rhydon alive until Lightning Rod or its typing is no longer useful; Protect helps here. Outside of Lightning Rod support, Rhydon works well as a physical attacking tank. It is excellent at switching into most physical attacks, especially predicted Fake Outs. Thanks to Eviolite, it can survive most physical super effective attacks, but super effective special attacks from the likes of Keldeo can still OHKO it. It can withstand many special attacks that don't hit it super effectively, but some, such as Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteors, will leave a dent.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Flying-type partners benefit from the redirection of Electric-type attacks and Thunder Wave, particularly from Thundurus. They also have nothing to fear from Rhydon's Earthquake. Notable Flying-types include Gyarados and Mega Charizard Y. Mega Charizard Y provides sunlight to help Rhydon survive physical and weaker Water-type attacks. Gyarados, especially a Dragon Dance variant, appreciates the support that Rhydon provides due to its 4x weakness to Electric-type attacks and can provide Intimidate support to complement Rhydon's physical bulk, letting it survive some physical Water- and Grass-type attacks. Water-types such as Azumarill and Keldeo also enjoy Lightning Rod support, but when pairing them with Rhydon, it is best to switch Rhydon in and out in a hit-and-run manner, as it does not provide much offensive synergy aside from beating grounded Electric-types. Airborne Dragon-types such as Latios and Hydreigon are good partners too, as they resist Grass- and Water-type moves while avoiding Rhydon's Earthquake. Latios also checks Fighting-types for Rhydon and appreciates Rhydon being able to beat Steel-types and Weavile. If not using Ice Punch, Pokemon that check Landorus-T, such as Cresselia, work wonders. Be warned that Lightning Rod also redirects your own Pokemon's Electric-type attacks, so Electric-type Pokemon such as Rotom-W can be counterproductive partners, as they will not be able to check Water-types with Rhydon on the field.</p> "

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "overview": "<p>With solid bulk for an attacker, just enough Speed, a high Attack stat backed up by Parental Bond, and an offensive typing resisted by few relevant threats, Mega Kangaskhan defines Doubles OU. Boasting a Normal typing and attacks strong enough to 2HKO majority of the metagame, Mega Kangaskhan is a dangerous threat to face, as there are few switch-ins to its attacks. Mega Kangaskhan's dominating power is partly thanks to its ability, Parental Bond, which effectively gives Mega Kangaskhan's attacks a 50% power boost and lets it hit twice, breaking and hitting through through Focus Sash and Substitute. Sporting access to a setup move in the form of Power-Up Punch, which, thanks to Parental Bond, is effectively a Swords Dance that deals damage, Mega Kangaskhan is a very dangerous threat, as it can also boost its already high power to astronomical levels; the ability to function both as a dangerous setup sweeper and as a powerful wallbreaker from the get-go defines Mega Kangaskhan's effectiveness and role. Mega Kangaskhan also has access to Fake Out and Sucker Punch; the former lets it buy a turn for a partner or get momentum while also hitting for decent damage, and the latter lets it circumvent its middling Speed and hit faster threats with priority. Sporting high power and the relatively rare Normal typing, which creates few, if any, synergy issues, Mega Kangaskhan makes for a solid strong attacker for any kind of team that has room for a Mega Evolution.</p> <p>However, as Mega Kangaskhan's Speed is only above average, it's outsped and beaten by numerous faster threats, such as Mega Diancie, Mega Metagross, and Keldeo. Mega Kangaskhan's Normal typing also leaves it with few safe switch-in opportunities due to not having any resistances or immunities save for the Ghost-type. The immunity is not even that useful, as Mega Kangaskhan's standard sets lack a way to hit opposing Ghost-types, such as Aegislash and Mega Gengar, save for the unreliable Sucker Punch.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Crunch is an option to let Mega Kangaskhan hit Ghost-types reliably. Facade can let Mega Kangaskhan still be useful even when afflicted with a status ailment. Ice Punch can be used to hit Landorus-T, an annoying foe to Mega Kangaskhan, for the swift OHKO. A Trick Room set, with a 252 HP / 228 Atk / 28 Def EV spread, a Brave nature, and possibly Hammer Arm to let Mega Kangaskhan go \"faster\" by lowering its Speed, can be used if Mega Kangaskhan is being used on a Trick Room team.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Faster Fighting-types, such as Keldeo, Terrakion, and a +1 Blaziken, outspeed Mega Kangaskhan and OHKO it with their respective Fighting-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon:Mega Kangaskhan has notable difficulty against Ghost-types because its way of hitting them, Sucker Punch, can be played around; Aegislash, Jellicent, and Gengar can easily set up against it, with the latter two also being able to simply burn Mega Kangaskhan. If Gengar has Mega Evolved, it can trap Mega Kangaskhan and burn it, essentially turning it into two-on-one situation against Mega Kangaskhan's side. Ghost-types have to be wary of attacking, however, as Sucker Punch damages them significantly.</p> <p><strong>Landorus-T: Choice Scarf Landorus-T lowers Mega Kangaskhan offensive presence through Intimidate and can simply take out Mega Kangaskhan with Superpower after a bit of chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Mega Diancie</strong>: Mega Diancie resists Mega Kangaskhan's STAB moves and can hit it hard with Diamond Storm.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: Intimidate and burns lower Mega Kangaskhan's dominant power to manageable levels, limiting its effectiveness. Landorus-T, Scrafty, and Gyarados can weaken Mega Kangaskhan with Intimidate, with the former two also having Fighting-type moves in tow to significantly damage it. (Mega) Gengar and Rotom-W can burn Mega Kangaskhan with Will-O-Wisp, and it can't hit back at the former.</p> <p><strong>Encore: Encore from the likes of Whimsicott and Politoed can lock Mega Kangaskhan into Fake Out, essentially turning it into a liability on the field.</p> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, Iron Barbs: Pokemon with Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs can heavily damage Mega Kangaskhan with residual damage alone; Ferrothorn can simply switch in on any of Mega Kangaskhan's attacks and chip off about one-quarter of its HP with Iron Barbs; and over one-half if using Rocky Helmet. Rocky Helmet Amoonguss can redirect Mega Kangaskhan's attacks while also dealing noticeable damage.</p> <p><strong>Flame Body and Static: Pokemon with Flame Body have a chance to burn Mega Kangaskhan if it makes contact; Volcarona can redirect Mega Kangaskhan's attacks with Rage Powder while taking advantage of its ability. Zapdos also has a chance to paralyze Mega Kangaskhan if it makes contact through Static.</p> ",

        "name": "Power-Up Punch",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Return is Mega Kangaskhan's most powerful STAB move without any drawbacks. Power-Up Punch boosts Mega Kangaskhan's Attack to higher levels, letting it muscle its way past bulkier targets and OHKO a good portion of the metagame; it's also a decent coverage move against some Steel-types such as Bisharp and Heatran. Sucker Punch lets Mega Kangaskhan get around its average Speed; it also lets Mega Kangaskhan hit Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Gengar, albeit unreliably. Fake Out lets Mega Kangaskhan snag momentum, letting a partner set up for free or deal with foes without much pressure; it also deals decent damage and is useful for stopping a foe from setting up field conditions such as Tailwind and Trick Room. Alternatively, Protect can be used to shield Mega Kangaskhan from attacks in order to buy time to position itself in order to keep its boosts; Protect also lets Mega Kangaskhan stall out field conditions and defend itself while a partner deals with an opposing threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Scrappy allows Mega Kangaskhan to hit Ghost-types before Mega Evolving, letting it use Fake Out on and stop setup from the likes of Jellicent and Chandelure. Inner Focus is an option in order to prevent flinches, letting Kangaskhan surprise opponents and delay foes for a turn without regard for opposing Fake Out users. The EV investment maximizes Mega Kangaskhan's offensive potential, and an Adamant nature boosts its power to higher levels. Alternatively, a Jolly nature can be used in order to outrun other neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon and Speed tie with positive-natured ones, though Mega Kangaskhan will be slightly weaker.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Kangaskhan should apply as much pressure to the opponent's team as it can with its raw damage output and ability to set up with Power-Up Punch. Leading with Mega Kangaskhan can be a good idea in order to grab momentum quickly by using Fake Out while Mega Evolving, providing it with some firepower while simultaneously giving it a free turn to set up and get into a favorable position early. On a similar note, using Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out to get into a good position mid- or late-game can be a good play. Be careful, though, as while Fake Out always seems like the play to make when Mega Kangaskhan first enters the field at any given time, this is not the case; it really depends on in-battle circumstances, and there are times when Return or Power-Up Punch is the better move. Mega Kangaskhan can also utilize Scrappy before Mega Evolving to make Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Jellicent flinch, stopping them from setting up Trick Room.</p> <p>Mega Kangaskhan should only use Power-Up Punch when there's a good opportunity to do so, such as when it's paired with a redirection user or the opponent's active Pokemon aren't threatening; a boosted Mega Kangaskhan applies tremendous pressure, as it can easily blow holes in opposing teams with its extremely powerful attacks. Don't use Power-Up Punch too soon, though, as setting up too early, such as when the opponent still has a healthy counter to Mega Kangaskhan in the back, means that Mega Kangaskhan will just waste a turn using a weak attack when it's forced out in the next few turns. Mega Kangaskhan should use Sucker Punch when it's threatened by a faster foe in order to get the first hit and possibly avoid unnecessary damage; this is especially true when it has Attack boosts, in which case Sucker Punch becomes particularly powerful.</p> <p>Some speed control support such as Tailwind and Thunder Wave works wonders for Mega Kangaskhan, as this lets it outspeed, attack, and KO foes it can't safely beat otherwise, such as Keldeo and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. It's also a good idea to pair Mega Kangaskhan with a redirection user, such as Amoonguss or Togekiss, in order to get safe turns to set up with Power-Up Punch or attack. It's a good idea to take out foes with Intimidate in order to make Mega Kangaskhan's job easier, as these Pokemon can easily come in and soften Mega Kangaskhan's blows to manageable levels. Don't let Mega Kangaskhan get burned, as this greatly will weaken its power, though Power-Up Punch can remedy this somewhat and a burned Mega Kangaskhan can still be useful if it can use Fake Out again to gain momentum.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Being an offensive Pokemon, Mega Kangaskhan appreciates teammates that can remove or match up well against its own checks and counters. Pokemon that can take on Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Gengar serve well; Hydreigon can take out both with its Dark Pulse, and Talonflame can hit both hard with its high-powered STAB moves. Both Hydreigon and Talonflame also fare well against opposing Steel-types, except Heatran in Talonflame's case. Teammates that can beat Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion make for good picks; Latios can outspeed and KO them with its Psyshock, and Aegislash can easily take any of their moves and strike back with its STAB moves. Pokemon that match up well against Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Mega Diancie are also good; bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune can strike back with a STAB move, your own Landorus-T can weaken their blows with Intimidate and KO the latter with Earthquake, and Deoxys-A outspeeds and KOes both of them with Psycho Boost.</p> <p>Teammates that can provide speed control support are handy to have, as they can help Mega Kangaskhan get KOs safely by letting it outspeed a wider range of foes. Tailwind from the likes of Talonflame, Latios, and Togekiss can be helpful, with the latter also having access to Follow Me and Encore, the latter of which can lock defending foes into Protect. Thunder Wave support from Pokemon such as Thundurus is also useful, and Cresselia can set up Trick Room in semi-Trick Room builds. It's important to note that Mega Kangaskhan can help these supporters by nabbing opportunities with Fake Out. Redirection helps Mega Kangaskhan greatly by giving it safe opportunities to set up with Power-Up Punch; Amoonguss can redirect moves with Rage Powder and put foes to sleep with Spore, and Togekiss has Follow Me and boasts additional support in Tailwind. Partners that can take advantage of the free turns Mega Kangaskhan can provide also work well; Substitute users such as Heatran, Kyurem-B, and Aegislash, Belly Drum Azumarill, and Deoxys-A all appreciate the opportunities to set up (or in Deoxys-A's case, attack) brought by Fake Out. Having Bisharp as a partner also works well because, in addition to being able to take out problematic Ghost-types, it takes advantage of any incoming Intimidate users thanks to Defiant.</p> "

        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Double-Edge lets Mega Kangaskhan KO or at least deal significant damage to foes, though it comes at the cost of recoil. Return is a usable alternative if Double-Edge's recoil is unappealing, though it's weaker and contrasts with the set's goal, which is to land swift KOs. Low Kick hits opposing Mega Kangaskhan, Kyurem-B, and Steel-types such as Bisharp and Heatran for heavy damage. Seismic Toss can also be used, always dealing 200 HP damage thanks to Parental Bond, which is enough to 2HKO a good portion of the metagame, and lets Mega Kangaskhan deal consistent damage regardless of type matchups and opposing Attack control in burns and Intimidate. Sucker Punch lets Mega Kangaskhan circumvent its middling Speed; it also hits Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Gengar, albeit unreliably. Fake Out lets Mega Kangaskhan grab momentum and lets a partner freely set up or take out foes without much trouble; it also hits for decent damage and is useful for stopping a foe from setting up field conditions such as Tailwind and Trick Room.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Scrappy lets Mega Kangaskhan hit Ghost-types before Mega Evolving, allowing it to use Fake Out on and stop setup from the likes of Jellicent and Chandelure. Inner Focus can be used in order to prevent flinches, letting Mega Kangaskhan surprise and delay foes for a turn without the need to consider opposing Fake Out. Full Attack and Speed EV investment puts Mega Kangaskhan's offensive capabilities to the highest level, and an Adamant nature lets it attain swift OHKOs, such as with Low Kick on opposing Mega Kangaskhan. A Jolly nature can also be run in order to outrun other neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon and tie with positive-natured ones, though Mega Kangaskhan will hit for noticeably less damage as a result. An alternate EV spread of 144 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 108 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used for considerably more bulk and the same high attacking power while still outrunning most of the same threats that the main spread allows Mega Kangaskhan to, getting the jump on the base 70+ Speed range.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Kangaskhan's goal is, essentially, to wreak as much havoc to the opposing team as possible with its very powerful attacks, allowing teammates to clean up later. Leading with Mega Kangaskhan can be a good idea to punch holes early, with the option to use Fake Out to Mega Evolve and wrest for momentum on the first turn. On a related note, Fake Out can also be useful to attempt to grab momentum mid- or late-game. Watch out, though, as while using Fake Out whenever possible may be tempting, there are times when simply using an attack such as Double-Edge or Low Kick is the better play overall. Mega Kangaskhan can also take advantage of Scrappy by not Mega Evolving immediately, using Fake Out against Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Jellicent to stop them from setting up Trick Room.</p> <p>Mega Kangaskhan should run-and-gun to do as much damage as it can, taking out or at least weakening the checks and counters of its teammates in order to create a win condition with one of them later on; for example, using Mega Kangaskhan's Low Kick to take out Heatran can let your Talonflame be free to pick off foes later on. As Low Kick is generally less seen on Mega Kangaskhan compared to Power-Up Punch, it can be useful for catching opponents off guard and landing a surprise KO. When running Seismic Toss, Mega Kangaskhan can deal consistent damage regardless of the foe's typing or any factors to its Attack, letting it face off against any threat and still deal solid damage with ease. Against a faster foe, use Sucker Punch in order to put some damage in and move first, possibly saving Mega Kangaskhan from unnecessary damage if it attains the KO.</p> <p>Using speed control support such as Tailwind and Thunder Wave can greatly help with Mega Kangaskhan's job, letting it beat down and KO faster threats such as Keldeo and Choice Scarf Landorus-T safely. Take out foes with Intimidate as soon as possible in order to help Mega Kangaskhan perform its job more smoothly, as those Pokemon can easily come in and weaken Mega Kangaskhan's blows. In addition, don't let Mega Kangaskhan get burned, as this will significantly weaken its attacks, turning it into a non-threat for foes to take advantage of; however, a burned Mega Kangaskhan can still be useful if it can use Fake Out again for momentum.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because Mega Kangaskhan is an attacker, it appreciates teammates that can deal with its checks and counters. Teammates that can beat Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Gengar are good picks; both Hydreigon and Talonflame can OHKO them with their own STAB moves while also being able to fare well against Steel-types, except for Heatran in Talonflame's case. Pokemon that can take out Fighting-type foes such as Keldeo and Terrakion also serve well as teammates; Latios can KO them with Psyshock, and Aegislash can take their attacks and hit back with its STAB moves. Teammates that match up well against Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Mega Diancie also work; bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune can take them out with their STAB moves, your own Landorus-T can weaken their blows with Intimidate, and Deoxys-A can outspeed and KO them with Psycho Boost.</p> <p>Teammates that can provide speed control support are great to have, as they can help Mega Kangaskhan outspeed and safely KO a wider range of threats. Tailwind setters such as Talonflame, Latios, and Togekiss are good options, with the latter also boasting great support moves in Follow Me and Encore, the latter of which can lock foes into Protect. Thunder Wave support from Pokemon such as Thundurus is also useful, and Cresselia can set up Trick Room for semi-Trick Room builds. Teammates that can clean up foes after Mega Kangaskhan has weakened them work well; spread move users such as Landorus-T, Heatran, and Terrakion are good choices, and Talonflame can pick off weakened foes with its Gale Wings Brave Bird. Mega Kangaskhan can be a good teammate for Pokemon that want certain threats removed or weakened; for example, Pokemon that dislike the presence of opposing Heatran, Mega Kangaskhan, and Kyurem-B appreciate Mega Kangaskhan's ability to KO them with Low Kick. Partners that can make use of the free turns Mega Kangaskhan can create with Fake Out also work well; Substitute users such as Heatran, Kyurem-B, and Aegislash, Belly Drum Azumarill, and Deoxys-A all appreciate the opportunities to set up (or in Deoxys-A's case, attack) brought by Fake Out. Bisharp can be a good partner, as, in addition to being able to take out Ghost-types, it can take advantage of opposing Intimidate users with Defiant.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>While Mega Pinsir possesses powerful Flying coverage, it faces many pitfalls that prevent it from competing on the level of other Doubles threats. Although it sports a decent Speed tier—outspeeding base 100s—it's held back due to underspeeding critical threats such as Keldeo, Latios, Thundurus, and Mega Diancie. It also loses to and faces heavy competition from Talonflame, which possesses priority and a much better Aegislash matchup while also not taking up a Mega slot, though it lacks Mega Pinsir's power and relative bulk. In addition, Mega Pinsir struggles to do meaningful damage outside of its Flying-type STAB moves; Close Combat is a roll to KO Mega Kangaskhan even with an Adamant nature. Being frail and with no relevant resistances, Mega Pinsir is OHKOed by many neutral STAB attacks, in addition to being brought down by its multiple critical weaknesses such as to Flying- and Rock-type coverage. This combination of poor defenses, typing weaknesses, and mediocre Speed for a frail offensive attacker leaves it outclassed by Talonflame in most situations. However, access to Feint and a very powerful Flying-type STAB move can let Mega Pinsir take advantage of its offensive pressure while also supporting hard-hitting teammates.</p> ",

While a Jolly nature is used to outspeed maximum Speed base 100s and other notable threats such as Landorus, the damage boost from an Adamant nature can be critical in securing several KOs as well as a roll to KO Mega Kangaskhan. Return will also have a roll to KO Landorus-T if Intimidate is prevented, either through coming in while Landorus-T is on the field or by taking advantage of Hyper Cutter, which lets Pinsir play around Intimidate in a similar vein to Clear Body. This lets Pinsir either lead into both without losing Attack or attack on the turn it Mega Evolves without fear of an Intimidate switch-in hampering its damage effectiveness.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Apply offensive pressure with Feint: when Mega Pinsir's team has offensive initiative, it can heavily punish opposing Protects. This, combined with its ability to prevent opponents from stalling out field conditions, such as Tailwind and rain, makes it a potent threat when its team has the upper hand. In addition, Feint can expose Pokemon with faster Mega Evolutions such as Diancie and Metagross as they Mega Evolve, as well as breaking Quick Guard and Wide Guard. Feint should also be used to pick off low-health foes, even priority attackers such as Talonflame, as Mega Pinsir's Feint has higher priority than Talonflame's Brave Bird. Use Mega Pinsir's partner and proper positioning to get Mega Pinsir into situations where it can use Return without fear of Electric-type switch-ins or getting KOed before it can move by threats such as Keldeo and Talonflame. Be sure to consider switching Mega Pinsir out when it's not doing anything effective, such as in bad matchups or when it's weakened by Intimidate.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Pinsir requires heavy support to alleviate its poor matchups. This includes checks to Talonflame such as Thundurus and Landorus-T; checks to Landorus-T such as Azumarill and Deoxys-A; checks to Electric-types, such as Rhyperior and Amoonguss; and Pokemon to take out Aegislash, such as strong Fire-type attackers like Heatran and Blaziken or powerful Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Hoopa-U. Mega Pinsir also benefits heavily from Tailwind support from Zapdos or Suicune, as its Feint stops foes from stalling Tailwind turns with Protect.</p> <p>On the other hand, Mega Pinsir can supplement a team by removing opposing Fighting-types, clearing the way for Pokemon weak to Fighting-types such as Hydreigon and Heatran. Rain teams in general can appreciate Mega Pinnsir's ability to beat Amoonguss, Kyurem-B, and Ferrothorn in one slot, as these are all common rain checks. Offensive single-target hitters that can take advantage of Feint's ability to break Protect such as Deoxys-A and Belly Drum Azumarill can avoid Protect counterplay with Mega Pinsir discouraging an opponent from protecting their Pokemon. Spread attackers such as Landorus-T and Heatran appreciate Feint breaking Wide Guard. Pokemon with Fake Out like Weavile, Infernape, and Scrafty can complement Feint for good combined pressure while also giving Mega Pinsir room to take out a foe.</p> "

  "Gyarados": {
    "overview": "<p>Gyarados is a valuable Pokemon in the Doubles metagame, being able to fulfill either an attacking or supporting role depending on a team's needs. It also fares well in the metagame as it able to check various defensive Pokemon such as Jirachi and Heatran as well as offensive threats such as Talonflame and Landorus-T. It can viably run a Dragon Dance set, which allows it to take a more offensive role by boosting its Attack and Speed, or a Choice Band set for immediate power. It can also run a bulky set that can reliably support its teammates with Intimidate and speed control through Thunder Wave. This versatility gives Gyarados the rare, and valuable, trait of being somewhat unpredictable.</p> <p>Gyarados is a good pick for teams that can fit a supporter or an attacker that can set up or has raw power. This is because usually on most teams Gyarados faces a lot of competition from Choice Scarf Landorus-T, which is better at keeping the pace and checking a multitude of threats. However, Gyarados offers its Water typing and valuable access to support moves such as Taunt and Thunder Wave. Gyarados's usage of speed control also helps make up for its middling Speed, and its solid Water / Flying typing gives it important resistancess against Fire-, Fighting-, and Water-type attacks and an immunity to Ground-type attacks. However, Electric-types such as Thundurus and Rotom formes threaten Gyarados massively.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Crunch is a possible coverage option on the Choice Band set for dealing more damage to Aegislash and OHKOing Latios from full health. It is also nice for hitting other Psychic-types such as Cresselia, Jirachi, and Mega Metagross. Bounce is another option when using Choice Band, notably OHKOing Amoonguss and Keldeo. However, being a two-turn move lets it force Protects and makes Feint support an almost necessary addition. Taunt may be used on the Dragon Dance set to grant Gyarados some added utility, but it sorely misses the additional coverage gained from a secondary attack. Wacan Berry or Charti Berry can be used to halve the damage from an Electric- or Rock-type attack, but both Berries are usually outclassed by Sitrus Berry in terms of improving Gyarados's longevity. Lum Berry can be a clutch option to cure Gyarados of status once, but Safety Goggles is far better against Spore users, while Gyarados still faces massive problems from most burn or paralysis users even with a Lum Berry. Roar can be used to phaze opposing Pokemon, particularly setup Pokemon such as Azumarill and Mega Kangaskhan, as well as Substitute users such as Kyurem-B and Aegislash. Roar can also prevent Trick Room from being set, although less reliably than Taunt.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Electric-type Pokemon such as Thundurus, Rotom-W, and Zapdos all threaten to OHKO Gyarados with a STAB Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Rock-type Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Terrakion can threaten Gyarados offensively but struggle to KO it without prior damage even without Intimidate. Gyarados also threatens back with a super effective STAB Waterfall.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Latios, and Kyurem-B fear little offensively from Gyarados while being able to hit it hard.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Intimidate from opposing Gyarados or Landorus-T weaken Gyarados's attacks. Gyarados also needs to watch out for being burned by Pokemon such as Gengar, Jellicent, and Gourgeist-XL. Rotom-W can also burn Gyarados, but it will usually just use Thunderbolt to KO it instead.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Dragon Dance and Choice Band sets are quite vulnerable to opposing speed control, with Trick Room using Gyarados's Speed boosts against it. Trick Room users such as Jellicent and Gourgeist-XL take little from Gyarados's attacks but need to watch out for Taunt. Tailwind users such as Zapdos also cause problems. Thunder Wave, especially priority ones from Thundurus, effectively neuter offensive Gyarados variants.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Substitute</strong>: Taunt users such as Keldeo can cripple utilitly Gyarados. Thundurus can also Taunt Gyarados, but it will usually just use Thunderbolt for the KO. Kyurem-B can freely set up Substitute against any of utility Gyarados's moves bar Stone Edge.</p> ",

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Waterfall does good damage against most neutral targets and is Gyarados's main attack. Dragon Dance allows Gyarados to boost its Attack and Speed. Stone Edge KOes Mega Charizard Y and drastically improves Gyarados's sun matchup, as well as enabling Gyarados to deal sufficient damage to Kyurem-B. It also hits Thundurus hard, but usually Gyarados is too threatened to attack anyway. Alternatively, Return still hits most Pokemon that resist Water such as Rotom-W, Latios, and Amoonguss for decent damage and has better accuracy. Return is recommended over Double-Edge because as a setup sweeper, Gyarados needs to maintain its longevity. Protect allows Gyarados to stall out field conditions such as Tailwind and Trick room as well as allowing partners to remove threats such as Thundurus.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Life Orb allows +0 Gyarados to OHKO Landorus-T with Waterfall. However, Safety Goggles immensely helps Gyarados against Amoonguss, changing it from a check to setup bait by allowing Gyarados to get around Rage Powder and giving it an immunity to Spore. Intimidate provides valuable support for teammates against physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Landorus-T while also helping Gyarados to set up more easily. 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow it to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T at +1, and standard weather sweepers such as Kingdra and Venusaur at +2. 252 Attack EVs let Gyarados hit as hard as possible. An alternate spread with 168 Speed EVs with an Adamant nature can be used to outspeed neutral Speed-natured base 70s such as Bisharp before a boost, and some additional power and bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Don't set up too early in the match, when Gyarados's counters are still healthy. Gyarados has a better chance of performing well late-game when its checks are worn down. Also, try to avoid letting Gyarados take too much damage before and while setting up, as this can hurt its chances of sweeping by putting it in range of priority attacks such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Gyarados should idealy be brought in on Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Heatran, which provide it with safe setup opportunities. Utilizing partners with redirection moves or Fake Out should also be a priority when aiming to set up. Gyarados can use the fact that people will expect the utility set to its advantage. Gyarados doesn't always need to set up to perform effectively, as sometimes it doesn't need the boosts or the immediate damage can be better when trying to double target a threat for the KO. Protect should be utilized effectively so that Gyarados keeps its boosts while a partner takes care of Pokemon such as Thundurus, which threaten it offensively and has a priority Thunder Wave. Avoid bringing in Gyarados on Defiant users such as Bisharp and Competitive users such as Milotic, as Intimidate will provide them with free boosts that make these Pokemon extremely threatening to Gyarados and its teammates.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Redirection users such as Amoonguss and Jirachi help Gyarados to set up safely. Amoonguss tanks Electric-type attacks better, while Jirachi can deal with Grass-types. Gyarados also removes Fire-types such as Heatran and Talonflame in return. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan can also help Gyarados to set up, while Gyarados also helps Mega Kangaskhan handle Landorus-T. Pokemon that can deal with the Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Thundurus that threaten Gyarados also make for good teammates. Possible partners include Dragon-types such as Kyurem-B, Latios, and Hydreigon as well as Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn. Raichu, Rhydon, and Rhyperior can provide Lightning Rod support to redirect Electric-type attacks by virtue of being on the field. Raichu can also provide Fake Out support to help Gyarados setup, or use Feint to ensure Gyarados will get boosted attacks off. If Gyarados is not carrying Safety Goggles, it especially appreciates support from Pokemon such as Talonflame, Heatran, and Latios, which can reliably beat Amoonguss. Bisharp can serve as a good offensive partner for Gyarados by discouraging Intimidate through Defiant.</p> "

        "name": "Utility",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Waterfall gains STAB and deals large amounts of damage to Water-weak foes such as Landorus-T, Talonflame, and Heatran. Taunt allows Gyarados to cripple Amoonguss and Aegislash, as well as prevent Trick Room and other speed control or status moves. Thunder Wave provides crippling speed control onto a single target and is particularly effective against very fast foes such as Ludicolo and Venusaur under weather and other Pokemon under Tailwind. However, Icy Wind is useful for slowing down both foes but to a lesser extent than Thunder Wave. It also has the benefits of breaking Focus Sashes and providing chip damage as well as getting around Taunt, but its effects being lost when switching out hurts its usefulness. Icy Wind tends to be better for teammates such as Mega Charizard Y and Mega Gardevoir, which both have middling Speed stats and so appreciate attacking first before both foes with strong spread moves. Protect is a staple move in Doubles, allowing Gyarados to stay alive while a partner removes a threat such as Thundurus or stall out field conditions such as Tailwind and Trick Room. However, Gyarados can afford to run Stone Edge instead, allowing it to check Mega Charizard Y as well as preventing Kyurem-B from getting a free Substitute.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP with 208 Defense EVs allow Gyarados to take two -1 Stone Edges from Landorus-T without a Sitrus Berry or two -1 Diamond Storms from Mega Diancie with it. 4 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature allow Gyarados to 2HKO Landorus-T in return with Waterfall while also giving it a good chance to OHKO Mega Diancie. The remaining EVs are put into Speed to outspeed uninvested Rotom formes. Sitrus Berry provides valuable longevity to Gyarados, which allows it to stay healthy and on the field for longer. Safety Goggles is another option that allows Gyarados to switch in and play around Amoonguss and Breloom more safely. Intimidate weakens opposing physical attackers by softening attacks for Gyarados and its teammates.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Intimidate makes Gyarados a great switch-in to physical attackers, particularly the likes of Landorus-T and Talonflame, which it can threaten with Waterfall. Gyarados's main role once it's on the field is exerting speed control with the combination of Taunt and Thunder Wave or Icy Wind to help more offensive teammates. Taunt should also be used to prevent the foe from inflicting status such as burns, paralysis, and sleep. Gyarados can perform well as a lead against Trick Room teams, as it can use Taunt to prevent Trick Room from being set. When using Gyarados, one should be wary of switching it into Defiant users such as Bisharp or Competitive users such as Milotic, as Intimidate will provide them with boosts, making them extremely threatening.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As Gyarados is a support Pokemon, teammates should take advantage of the utility provided in Intimidate, Taunt, and speed control. Mega Charizard Y and Mega Gardevoir both enjoy the speed control that Gyarados provides, while Intimidate also patches up both Pokemon's weaker Defense stat. Setup Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard X benefit from Gyarados's ability to provide support through Intimidate to help provide setup opportunities, as well as its ability to deal with Landorus-T reliably. Mega Kangaskhan also appreciates Gyarados's ability to neuter Amoonguss through Taunt as well as switch into Keldeo and Landorus-T for it. An additional teammate that can KO Amoonguss would still greatly help this combination. Pokemon that can deal with Electric-type Pokemon such as Thundurus have good synergy with Gyarados, making Grass- or Dragon-type Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Hydreigon, Kyurem-B, and Latios good teammates. Lightning Rod users such as Rhydon and Rhyperior can also do this by virtue of being on the field, but they are usually more team-specific options.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Waterfall gains STAB, and with a Choice Band boost it will put a large dent in anything that doesn't resist Water. It notably has a chance to OHKO standard Landorus-T even after Intimidate. Double-Edge provides great neutral coverage alongside Waterfall, hitting most Pokemon that resist Water such as Rotom-W quite hard due to its high Base Power. Stone Edge deals massive damage to Kyurem-B and can cleanly OHKO regular checks to Gyarados in Zapdos, bulky Thundurus, and Mega Charizard Y. Ice Fang hits Dragon- and Grass-types harder than any other move, allowing Gyarados to always KO Latios after one round of Life Orb recoil. It also always 2HKOes standard Rocky Helmet Amoonguss. Despite not being usually recommended on non-Ground-type Pokemon, Earthquake can work well on Gyarados, notably hitting targets such as Aegislash, Jirachi, and Mega Metagross quite hard while avoiding Aegislash's King's Shield mind games. Additionally, hitting both foes is nice for helping a teammate to finish them off; however, Earthquake does leave Gyarados vulnerable to Ground-immune switch-ins due to Choice Band.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Band takes advantage of Gyarados's high Attack stat to allow it to hit like a truck. Intimidate allows Gyarados to still provide defensive utility for its teammates, allowing itself and partners to take physical attacks better. 252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature let Gyarados hit as hard as possible. 168 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed neutral Speed-natured base 70s such as Bisharp and Breloom; however, 228 EVs can be used instead to always outspeed Modest Heatran. The remaining EVs are put into HP to maximize Gyarados's bulk. If Gyarados is being used on a Trick Room team, a Brave nature should be used with the Speed EVs being put into HP instead.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Gyarados is best used when supported by speed control such as Trick Room or Tailwind, where it can break through teams and KO a lot of Pokemon before they can even move. This allows Gyarados to fulfill its main role as a wallbreaker, meaning that it can greatly weaken opposing teams for teammates to plow through them with ease. Gyarados is therefore best taken advantage of early- or mid-game, when it can weaken Pokemon; however, it can do well late-game with the right support or against slower teams. Since Gyarados is usually expected to be running the utility set, it can take advantage of this to catch common switch-ins such as Rotom-W and Thundurus for large amounts of damage. If multiple moves get the KO on a target, choose the move that does best against the remaining members of the opponent's team. One should be wary of switching Gyarados into Defiant users such as Bisharp or Competitive users such as Milotic, as Intimidate will provide them with boosts, making them extremely threatening.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Gyarados's ability to weaken opposing teams make for good teammates. Good examples include Mega Diancie, Mega Kangaskhan, and Bisharp, as Gyarados can weaken Pokemon such as Amoonguss to help them clean later on. The Choice Band set appreciates speed control to take advantage of its power, making Tailwind users such as Zapdos and Latios great partners. Other options include Thundurus, which can provide Thunder Wave support, and Jirachi, which can utilize Icy Wind. Good partners for setting Trick Room include Porygon2, which has great defensive synergy with Gyarados, as well as Cresselia and Gourgeist-XL. Other good teammates include Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon, which can deal with the Electric-types such as Thundurus that Gyarados struggles with. Amoonguss, which can also redirect the foes' attacks, Hydreigon, Kyurem-B, and Latios are good examples. Rhydon and Rhyperior can redirect Electric-type attacks via Lightning Rod, with both Pokemon being good options on Trick Room teams as well due to their low Speed.</p> "

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite its overall disappointing power, Mega Aerodactyl secures a niche in DOU with its fantastic Rock Slide and good matchup with ubiquitous offensive threats. In addition to its good matchups with Mega Diancie and Keldeo, its Speed tier, higher than that of Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T, prevents the latter from repeatedly switching in and threatening teams, and it is one of the few offensive Talonflame checks. Having a better Rock Slide than Landorus-T, in terms of speed, power, and the lack of a Choice lock, gives Aerodactyl significant ability to influence the opponent's decisions and control the field for fear of flinches. Aerodactyl also boasts a fantastic movepool with many support and coverage options, though it lacks the flexibility to use most of them. Statistically, it's very disappointing. Its moves have very low Base Power and its Attack isn't too high, so, for example, it can only OHKO Keldeo with a high damage roll, and its low bulk makes it difficult to use its otherwise good resistances.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Taunt is an option to neuter defensive Pokemon that typically beat Aerodactyl; Stone Edge provides much more powerful (though still unimpressive) Rock-type coverage; Crunch, Fire Fang, and Ice Fang provide specific coverage for threats like Aegislash, Jellicent, and Ferrothorn; and Tailwind provides very useful team support. The problem with all of these moves is that Aerodactyl usually needs its first three moves. Taunt or Tailwind over Wide Guard is a viable option, though these moves are usually easier to fit elsewhere on the team, and a different coverage move over Aerial Ace (or in Ice Fang's case, Aqua Tail) could be used if the team is particularly weak to a certain threat. Aerodactyl can also run a Focus Sash support set with many of its supportive moves, but this is usually not too effective.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types such as Aegislash, Jirachi, and Mega Metagross resist both of Aerodactyl's STAB moves and can hit hard with a super effective STAB move of their own.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune can take anything Mega Aerodactyl can hit with and hit back hard with a super effective Water-type move.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: These drop Aerodactyl's damage output to unusable levels for the most part, though Aerodactyl can actually be used to take out Landorus-T as described above, as well as the other common Intimidate user, Gyarados, which is weak to Rock Slide. Still, they're handy for protecting the rest of the team.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Paralysis absolutely ruins Aerodactyl. Defensive Thundurus and Jirachi can easily paralyze and tank Rock Slide; offensive Thundurus can also paralyze, but Rock Slide will nearly OHKO it. Tailwind and Trick Room from the likes of Suicune and Cresselia also temporarily take it out of commission by taking away its Speed advantage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Faster Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf Kyurem-B or Ludicolo, Kingdra, and Venusaur in their respective weathers, destroy Aerodactyl without even a fear of a Rock Slide flinch.</p> ",

Aerial Ace or Sky Drop is necessary for the chance to OHKO Keldeo and Virizion and take a big chunk out of Amoonguss. Sky Drop is useful as a pseudo-Fake Out with Aerodactyl's fantastic speed, but it makes Aerodactyl easy to pick off on the turn it lands. Aqua Tail OHKOes Mega Diancie and while Landorus-T will be tempted to switch into Rock Slides, the second time it does it will be in Aqua Tail's KO range. It may be tempting to run Ice Fang instead to KO Landorus-T after one Rock Slide, but then your Aerodactyl will be Diancie bait. Wide Guard is a fantastic and poorly distributed support move to protect Aerodactyl's teammates against Rock Slide, Heat Wave, Earthquake, and Hyper Voice. Protect is still Protect and is very useful when leading Aerodactyl against teams with Fake Out, but given how Aerodactyl is usually played it'll often be better to just chance it with Rock Slide and accept the loss if it comes than to give up on Wide Guard.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Aerodactyl needs maximum Attack and Speed with a Jolly nature to outspeed Landorus-T and tie with Deoxys-A while hitting for decent damage. Unnerve prevents the opponent's Pokemon from eating Sitrus or resist Berries, which is almost always useless, as Aerodactyl always Mega Evolves as soon as possible, but Pressure and Rock Head are even more useless.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bring Aerodactyl in when in a position to get a KO, preferably on a sacrifice or free U-turn; try not to bring it in on anything except Earthquake or weak resisted hits like Heat Wave and Fake Out, especially if your opponent has a Talonflame, to keep Aerodactyl out of Brave Bird's KO range. Be careful when you Mega Evolve Aerodactyl, as Landorus-T will outspeed non-Mega Aerodactyl. When in, spam Rock Slide to spread chip damage until Aerodactyl is forced out or KOed, unless Aerodactyl can get a KO with one of its coverage moves. Aerodactyl can be used to force Landorus-T in and chip away at it, so it's fairly good at removing it to support its team. Sky Drop can take a redirector off of the field, allowing Aerodactyl's slower partner to hit its original target.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Aerodactyl can work well on offensive teams, which typically fear Talonflame and give Aerodactyl free switches with their freedom to sacrifice Pokemon, as it is able to keep up the pace while checking common threats to offense. It also fits on certain balance teams, as they will appreciate the field control of its Rock Slide flinches and its ability to outspeed Landorus-T and Diancie, and they are in return able to chip things into Aerodactyl's KO range. Fire-types such as Volcarona and Heatran particularly appreciate the removal of Aerodactyl's typical targets; in return, they can bring things into its KO range with their Heat Waves and remove Steel-types, which hard counter the bird.</p> "

However, Zapdos faces heavy competition from Thundurus, a support Electric-type with Prankster and access to Taunt, though Zapdos has more bulk and Tailwind to differentiate itself. Although Zapdos has few weaknesses, it is checked offensively by common threats such as Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B and walled by Pokemon that resist Electric and don't take much from its coverage moves such as Amoonguss.</p> ",

Similarly, Charti Berry allows Zapdos to take a Rock-type attack more comfortably, but it suffers from being activated on a weaker hit such as Rock Slide. Light Screen improves Zapdos's team's Special Defense but leaves Zapdos either much more passive without an extra coverage move or with reduced longevity if Roost is dropped. Thunder Wave is an alternative option for speed control, but Thundurus is typically the better option if Tailwind is not used. Volt Switch allows Zapdos to switch out after setting up Tailwind and can be used to bring in a heavy-hitting teammate with more safety.

Tailwind allows Zapdos to support its team, doubling their Speed for three turns. This swings momentum in your team's favor, allowing Pokemon with middling to fast Speed to wreak havoc on the opposing side. Hidden Power Ice hits Landorus-T and Dragon-types such as Salamence, Latios, and Hydreigon for more damage than Thunderbolt. Roost provides recovery, and the extra longevity enables Zapdos to set up Tailwind multiple times in the match and check threats more reliably. Roost also removes Zapdos's Flying typing, allowing it to stay in on Rock- and Ice-types that it outspeeds. Heat Wave may be used over Hidden Power Ice, as it  dents Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and provides spread damage; however, the move is somewhat weak, as it fails to break Kyurem-B's Substitute. As such, it is recommended that the move is only used on sun teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan when they hit Zapdos, which allows Zapdos to rack up consistent residual damage on these Pokemon as it recovers with Roost. Sitrus Berry is a staple item in Doubles for bulkier Pokemon, providing a burst of recovery and increasing Zapdos's lifespan. Safety Goggles can also be used to ignore Spore and Rage Powder from Pokemon like Breloom and Amoonguss, making Zapdos an effective switch-in to both. The EV spread allows Zapdos to take two Rock Slides from Adamant Landorus-T after spread reduction and two Ice Beams from Modest Ludicolo. The Speed investment allows Zapdos to outspeed neutral-natured base 70 Pokemon such as Bisharp. The rest of the EVs are pumped into Special Attack along with a Modest nature in order to increase Zapdos's offensive presence. If Keldeo or Landorus-T are especially threatening, 96 EVs may be moved from Special Defense to Special Attack to OHKO them with Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice, respectively. Static lets Zapdos deter attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan from attacking it by threatening to paralyze them.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Zapdos's bulk allows it to be easily switched in during the middle of the game to swing the momentum in your favor. Zapdos is also an effective lead against Mega Kangaskhan, threatening Rocky Helmet recoil damage and paralysis through Static if Mega Kangaskhan uses Fake Out on it. Use Roost liberally against Pokemon that Zapdos either threatens out or that can't harm it if you are predicting Protect or a switch out in order to keep Zapdos healthy. Zapdos gives a solid defensive backbone to a team with its excellent bulk and recovery, so utilize that by switching it into common threats such as Talonflame and Fighting-type moves from Pokemon such as Virizion. Tailwind is far from the only option on the first turn; attack if it makes more sense to do so.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y aids Zapdos with sun for its Heat Wave, allowing it to break Kyurem-B's Substitute, and it appreciates the Tailwind Zapdos provides. Zapdos also beats one of the most common checks to sun teams in Talonflame. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan and Infernape and redirection users such as Jirachi help Zapdos set up Tailwind more easily. Steel-types like Aegislash and Mega Metagross take on Dragon-types and Mega Diancie, two of Zapdos's more difficult matchups. Hard hitters that appreciate Tailwind such as Hoopa-U, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Kangaskhan are able to devastate the opponent's team with their Speed stat doubled. Fighting-types such as Keldeo are able to deal with Ice- and Rock-types such as Kyurem-B and Terrakion that threaten Zapdos with their STAB attacks. Breloom is one of Zapdos's best partners, working extremely well under Tailwind with its ability to incapacitate opposing Pokemon with fast Spores.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Dragonite is a popular choice in Doubles OU. However, despite the wisdom of the crowds, prospective Dragonite users should be advised of its one flaw: it is completely and utterly terrible in every way. The problem is that it's a physical Dragon-type attacker, and being a physical Dragon-type sucks. Dragon Claw is miserably weak, and Outrage is even worse due to its numerous undesirable side effects. Its abilities, Multiscale and Inner Focus, are nifty but not nearly enough to redeem its unfortunate other traits because Multiscale can't withstand the pressure of two foes and Inner Focus is just mediocre in general.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A special attacking set, usually run on a rain team, is sometimes seen and a tiny bit more threatening than the Dragon Dance set, but it's also not good. Hurricane isn't that much better than Draco Meteor (and the two are redundant together) to justify using Dragonite over Salamence, Hydreigon, or Latios, which have much better abilities, Speed stats, and power. Inner Focus Choice Band is the best Dragonite can do, as it then actually gets remotely powerful STAB and priority moves, but with locking into one move, Dragonite's poor Speed tier, and the number of fast Pokemon that resist Extreme Speed (most of them), it is still not a good idea.</p> <p>If you really want to use Dragonite, another option is playing DPP OU, where it's actually good.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Basic Competence</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: Intimidate and burns destroy Dragonite's damage output, and all of the common Will-O-Wisp users (Rotom-W, Rotom-H, Gengar, Talonflame, and Darkrai) can burn it easily before it sets up.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Paralysis prevents Dragonite from being an effective setup sweeper, so it has to be wary of Thunder Wave from the likes of Thundurus and Gyarados.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Aegislash, and Mega Metagross can soak up Dragonite's hits and whittle it down.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir can simply OHKO Dragonite with Pixilate Hyper Voice. Azumarill can easily take any hit from Dragonite and boost with Belly Drum.</p> <p><strong>Mega Diancie: Mega Diancie will destroy any variants without Earthquake with its high Speed and Diamond Storm.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-B</strong>: Kyurem-B can OHKO Dragonite with Teravolt Ice Beam, hitting through Multiscale, before it gets going.</p> ",

        "name": "Disappointing Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>The theory behind this set is that you click Dragon Dance while the foe activates Dragonite's Weakness Policy and then gets swept by a +3 Attack / +1 Speed Dragonite.</p> <p>The reality is that anyone who's at least half an IQ point above imbecile will see this coming from a mile away and elect not to hit a full-health Dragonite with a super effective move, and instead you'll be stuck using something that hits like a wet noodle. +1 Dragon Claw is still weaker than Latios's Draco Meteor, and considering the commonness of Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp in Doubles OU, you'll be lucky if Dragonite even gets to hit that hard. Dragon Claw with Extreme Speed has large gaps in coverage (notably Mega Diancie and also any Steel-type), but if Dragonite uses a coverage move over Extreme Speed to remedy this, it's vulnerable to threats like Talonflame. Additionally, the only coverage move that actually hits all of these Pokemon is Earthquake, and non-STAB Earthquake is like biting into a dinner roll and realizing it expired in 2013.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Weakness Policy is used with Multiscale to tank a hit and boost Dragonite's Attack, as long as your opponent has never heard of Dragonite before. Unfortunately, other items such as Lum Berry really are no better because +1 Dragon Claw isn't scary at all. It needs the Weakness Policy boosts, but it will never get the Weakness Policy boosts. Such is the paradox of being a Dragonite.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Normally, for a Dragon-type, I would say to use its good resistances to switch in on foes that it beats and threaten to hit back hard. However, in the case of Dragonite, 1) switching in on an attack will ruin Multiscale, 2) it can't hit hard, and 3) it doesn't beat anything.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>If you're so dead set on running this set that you've come all the way to this section, why not use it with Magikarp? It's not like your team could get worse. Dragon Dance boosting just isn't that good, but if you really want to do it, you should use Gyarados.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Boasting base 100 stats across the board, Mew stands in the metagame as a fast, bulky, and niche supporter. Mew's claim to fame is its ability to Transform into any Pokemon on the field, particularly boosted teammates such as +6 Belly Drum Azumarill; Transform allows Mew to apply intense pressure on the opposing team by being able to turn into another boosted threat on top of its already-boosted partner. Mew also has access to nifty support moves, such as Tailwind and Will-O-Wisp, letting it back up its team outside of using Transform.</p> <p>Outside of Transform and its ability to support its team, Mew is a horribly niche pick; it should only be used as a glue and role compressor for filling several niches as a last resort due to being mediocre overall. Mew usually lacks an offensive move besides Fake Out, leaving it extremely vulnerable to Taunt and forcing it to rely on acquiring attack moves via Transform to deal damage. Mew can be a momentum killer on the field due to its difficulties with strong, fast Pokemon, as they are able to heavily damage it with ease.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock can be useful to quickly weaken opposing Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y and guarantee some KOs. Super Fang provides Mew with a semi-reliable attacking option, letting it deal chip damage to foes. Ice Beam can be used to swiftly KO Landorus-T, a major threat to physical attackers. Thunder Wave lowers the Speed of foes, letting Mew's teammates outspeed them easily. Trick Room reverses the turn order, giving the Speed advantage to slower Pokemon and letting them move first more often; however, note that priority moves will still move first under Trick Room. Ally Switch is a nifty positioning tool that can let Mew take attacks aimed at its partner by swapping places on the field. Helping Hand lets Mew boost the damage output of its partner, which can be useful to guarantee a KO on a foe. Safeguard can be handy for preventing status moves, such as Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Spore, from hindering Mew's teammates. Safety Goggles can be useful to ignore Spore and Rage Powder from Amoonguss, but Mew will miss the recovery from Leftovers or Sitrus Berry.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Dark-types, such as Hydreigon and Bisharp, can take out Mew with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Ghost-types, such as Aegislash and Gengar, can easily take out Mew with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: As Mew rarely runs other attacking moves, powerful attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Metagross can easily wear Mew down while fearing nothing back, save for Will-O-Wisp in the case of physical attackers.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore: Taunt from common users such as Thundurus and Gyarados can completely shut down Mew, as its primary moveset consists of purely support moves sans Fake Out, which only works on the first turn Mew is on the field. Encore from the likes of Whimsicott and Togekiss can lock Mew into an unfavorable move such as Fake Out, turning it into a liability on the field.</p> <p><strong>Redirection: Redirectors such as Amoonguss and Jirachi can redirect Transform away from its intended target with Rage Powder and Follow Me, respectively.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out gives Mew's partner more freedom to set up or attack by stopping a foe from moving altogether, possibly delaying it from setting up. Transform lets Mew turn into any Pokemon on the field, letting it have presence outside of being a mere supporter; it can also copy stat changes, allowing Mew to stack pressure on the opposing team by using Transform on a boosted partner, such as +6 Azumarill or +2 Mega Kangaskhan. Will-O-Wisp lets Mew cripple opposing physical attackers, lowering their damage output to give teammates opportunities to set up as well as dealing chip damage. Tailwind provides Mew and its team with the Speed advantage, letting them outrun and possibly KO foes they couldn't otherwise. Protect lets Mew stall out field conditions, scout attacks, and shield itself from damage while a partner takes out a particular threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Both of Mew's items aim to prolong its longevity by providing it with recovery; Sitrus Berry is preferred, as the instant recovery is better in the fast-paced DOU metagame, but Leftovers can also be useful by providing continuous incremental recovery. The Speed investment with a Jolly nature lets Mew outrun as many foes as it can without lowering the negligible damage output of Fake Out. The rest of the EVs are invested in HP to maximize its bulk—HP EVs are also the only EVs that carry over after using Transform. 30 Attack and Defense IVs can be used in order to get Hidden Power Ice when using Transform on a Pokemon that runs it, such as Thundurus.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mew's biggest concern once it's on the field is supporting its teammates. Fake Out lets Mew delay foes, hindering their plans as well as giving its teammates opportunities to set up. When Mew's teammates lack the Speed advantage, Mew can use Tailwind to give it to them. Similarly, Mew can use Will-O-Wisp to lower the offensive presence of opposing physical attackers, letting its teammates set up more easily. Once a partner has already set up, for example a +6 Azumarill after setting up with Belly Drum, Mew can Transform into it, giving its side two boosted threats that apply intense pressure to their foes. As Transform goes through Protect, a partner can shield itself from any harm with Protect while Mew uses Transform in order to avoid any unnecessary damage. Mew can also Transform into a foe, letting it take advantage of any utilities they might have such as Intimidate, redirection, and Helping Hand; Mew can also take advantage of matchups this way. Transforming into Amoonguss can also prove to be beneficial in order to provide redirection support while also getting recovery from Regenerator.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that appreciate the support that Mew brings to help them set up make for good partners. Teammates that can set up are highly recommended, as Mew can Transform into them and give its side two boosted threats; both Azumarill and Mega Kangaskhan appreciate the support that Mew brings and can set up with Belly Drum and Power-Up Punch, respectively. Mega Diancie beats Thundurus, which could otherwise Taunt Mew and render it useless; its ability to send back Taunt with Magic Bounce is also a huge boon. Teammates that can take out opposing Dark-types and Aegislash make for good teammates; Fighting- and Fairy-types such as Keldeo, Azumarill, and Sylveon can take out opposing Dark-types with ease, and Dark- and Fire-types such as Hydreigon and Heatran, as well as Landorus-T, make short work of Aegislash. Redirectors, such as Togekiss, Amoonguss, and Jirachi, can be useful to redirect attacks for Mew once it's already Transformed into a boosted setup sweeper; Amoonguss is especially notable for also being able to provide recovery by letting Mew Transform into it and take advantage of Regenerator.</p> "

These stats, combined with low Speed, make it well-suited for being a bulky Trick Room attacker. However, it mandates Trick Room support in order to justify the Mega slot and to reach its full potential. Ampharos also suffers from a limited offensive movepool; this, combined with no spread moves, makes it fairly predictable.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Ice OHKOes Landorus-T, a very common threat, but is of little use otherwise, as STAB Dragon Pulse is more powerful against other Dragon-types. Volt Switch can maintain offensive pressure and potentially avoid incoming super effective attacks whilst inflicting respectable damage. Discharge is a spread attack that pairs well with Ground-types, but it is not powerful enough to achieve several OHKOs and 2HKOs, and the paralysis chance is counterproductive with Trick Room. Thunder can be used on a rain team for extra power. Thunder Wave can slow down foes, letting Ampharos outspeed them outside of Trick Room. Electric Terrain can prevent and wake up grounded Pokemon from sleep, a status that is commonly problematic for Trick Room teams, and increase the power of Ampharos's and other grounded Pokemon's Electric-type attacks. Magnet Rise turns Ampharos's most common weakness into an immunity. Finally, an Agility set can bypass Ampharos's poor Speed without the aid of Trick Room; however, this requires significant Speed investment to make it worthwhile, detracting from Ampharos's bulk.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ampharos's weakness to Earthquake often leads to its demise. Outside of Trick Room, Landorus-T can outspeed and 2HKO it. Inside of Trick Room, Rhyperior can outrun it, has a 56.3% chance to OHKO it with Life Orb Earthquake. Although a partner with Wide Guard can protect Ampharos from Earthquake, it will not protect Ampharos from Drill Run.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Latios, Salamence, and Hydreigon prey on Ampharos's weakness to Dragon, outspeeding and OHKOing it with Draco Meteor. However, under Trick Room, Ampharos outspeeds and OHKOes them with Dragon Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Sylveon is only 3HKOed by Ampharos while it OHKOes with Choice Specs Pixilate Hyper Voice. While Mega Gardevoir is 2HKOed by Ampharos, it OHKOes with Pixilate Hyper Voice.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon: Mega Abomasnow outspeeds Ampharos in Trick Room and 2HKOes with Blizzard. Outside of Trick Room, Kyurem-B and Weavile threaten Ampharos with Ice Beam and Icicle Crash, respectively. Weavile also has Ice Shard to circumvent Ampharos's speed advantage provided by Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Ampharos is very susceptible to Amoonguss, which can redirect all of Ampharos's attacks and avoid being 2HKOed, resists Thunderbolt and Focus Blast, outspeeds Ampharos under Trick Room, and can freely put Ampharos to sleep with Spore. Whimsicott, though uncommon, resists all three of Ampharos's most common attacks, enabling Whimsicott to freely use Encore and other support moves.</p> <p><strong>Speed: Ampharos is far less effective without Trick Room due to its poor Speed, which leaves it prone to get beat down by the majority of the metagame.</p> ",

Focus Blast wrecks common Pokemon that are weak to it such as Tyranitar, Heatran, Kangaskhan, and Scrafty. It also hits Excadrill and Ferrothorn, which resist Ampharos's STAB moves, super effectively. Protect allows Ampharos to scout or evade damage while its partner sets up Trick Room or takes out one of its counters.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Quiet nature and 252 Special Attack EVs provide maximum power. Maximum HP investment provides the best overall bulk. Minimum Speed investment makes Mega Ampharos as slow as possible, benefitting it under Trick Room. Ampharosite is the only reason to use Ampharos; without it, it is outclassed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Ampharos should be used only in Trick Room to take advantage of its low Speed. Use it as a powerful battering ram, taking out or weakening one Pokemon at a time. Try to bring it in after a KO or on a resisted attack to preserve its longevity. Ampharos should be using its high offense and bulk in order to out-muscle opposing Pokemon. For this reason, it should try to avoid super effective attacks even though it can survive most of them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Trick Room support is essential, as it allows Ampharos to get around its only low stat: its Speed. Among Trick Room users, Diancie can strike the Dragon-types that threaten Ampharos while being immune to their STAB attacks, while Cresselia and Gourgeist-XL are immune to or resist the Ground-type attacks that are fired at Ampharos. Cresselia can also use Ice Beam to threaten the Dragon- and Ground-types that threaten Ampharos. Wide Guard support is strongly advised given Ampharos's weaknesses to Earthquake, Blizzard, and Pixilate Hyper Voice. Notable Wide Guard users include Aegislash, which resists the Dragon-, Ice-, and Fairy-type attacks that threaten Ampharos, as well as Conkeldurr and Hariyama, which beat Ice-types with their Fighting-type STAB moves. Azumarill also resists or is immune to Dragon-, Ice-, and Fairy-type moves and can check Dragon- and Ground-types with its STAB moves. Teammates should be able to take advantage of the benefits Ampharos provides in order to justify using Mega Ampharos over other Mega Evolutions. Ampharos checks Flying-types such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Gyarados, benefiting the aforementioned Fighting-types Conkeldurr and Hariyama.

It works well as a bulky Water-type for teams that also appreciate offensive presence, something that other bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Rotom-W lack. In spite of these good traits, Azumarill does possess low Speed, and it is threatened by common Grass- and Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Breloom.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Belly Drum is a high-risk, high-reward move that maximizes Azumarill's Attack and, combined with Aqua Jet, can be deadly. Aqua Jet helps with Azumarill's poor Speed thanks to priority and turns it into a reliable sweeper; a +6 Aqua Jet can OHKO most Pokemon that take neutral damage from it, Mega Metagross and Aegislash being notable exceptions. Knock Off allows Azumarill to get around a few would-be checks like Amoonguss and Ferrothorn, as well as dealing solid damage to highly popular threats Aegislash and Volcanion. Play Rough is Azumarill's best Fairy-type STAB move and allows it to deal respectable damage in the case that it is unable to set up a Belly Drum. Lastly, Protect stalls out field effects and protects Azumarill from its partner's spread moves. It also buys time for its partner to attack.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EVs and an Adamant nature give Azumarill the most overall bulk and most attacking prowess possible. Sitrus Berry improves Azumarill's longevity and acts as recovery for Belly Drum's HP cut. If Azumarill is being used on a Trick Room team, it should be running a Brave nature and a 0 Speed IV to minimize its Speed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Azumarill works best late-game against weakened teams when it can clean up with Aqua Jet. However, avoid switching it into incoming attacks, as otherwise Azumarill will not have enough HP to use Belly Drum. It should only use Belly Drum if Electric-, Steel-, and Grass-type checks have been removed, when there is a teammate with Fake Out or redirection moves on the field, when foes can't threaten or KO it with 75% of its health remaining, or if a double-protect is predicted. Once its checks are removed, Azumarill can go on a rampage and wipe out entire teams with Aqua Jet and Play Rough. After setting up a Belly Drum, Azumarill becomes one of the opponent's primary targets, which you can often take advantage of. By having Azumarill use Protect to soak up hits and switching its partner out to a Pokemon with redirection moves or Fake Out on the same turn, Azumarill is able to better threaten the opposing team on the following turn. Lastly, Azumarill can beat common Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Scrafty, but it doesn't appreciate the Attack drop from Intimidate.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fake Out support can give Azumarill a free turn to set up Belly Drum. Some common Fake Out users include Mega Kangaskhan and Scrafty. Pokemon that can hit Electric-, Grass-, and Steel-types super effectively such as Landorus-T and Kyurem-B are good partners that can cover up Azumarill's weaknesses. Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B are particularly good partners for checking common Electric / Flying type Pokemon such as Zapdos and Thundurus. Heatran and Talonflame are good partners for checking Ferrothorn, which completely counters Azumarill. Heatran can also absorb Will-O-Wisps for Azumarill, allowing it to avoid possible burns. Azumarill can also function on a Trick Room team, where it can work with setters such as Cresselia. Mew can provide Fake Out support to help set up Belly Drum, then it can transform into Azumarill, copying its stats and pressuring the opponent by forcing them to face two +6 Azumarills. Azumarill also enjoys Pokemon with status moves, as paralysis and sleep can help Azumarill set up and sweep. Follow Me or Rage Powder support is also crucial when using Belly Drum, as these moves redirect redirects attacks and give Azumarill time to set up. Jirachi is the primary teammate chosen for Azumarill due to their solid type synergy and Jirachi's ability to redirect Grass-type moves, a weakness of Rage Powder users. Amoonguss is another possible such partner, as it has great synergy with Azumarill, as it can spread status and resists both Electric- and Grass-type moves.</p> "

  "Politoed": {
    "overview": "<p>Politoed's resistance to Fire and ability to induce rain allow it to switch into Heat Wave from Heatran and Mega Charizard Y, which is basically the only edge that rain has over sand and sun: the typing advantage. Politoed is mostly viable as a bulky rain setter, as its 90 / 75 / 100 bulk allows it to survive many hits, and rain's power boost to Scald lets Politoed fully invest EVs into its defenses without losing out on too much power. Outside of being bulky and having Drizzle, it usually fits no other role than supporting. A big downside to Politoed is the fact that it is dead weight in a lot of matchups. Rain teams are always hyper offense, and Politoed does not fit the mold of a hyper offense Pokemon. Even though it is a viable support Pokemon with Helping Hand and Encore, it doesn't offer offensive pressure like Ludicolo and Mega Swampert do. Rain struggles to match the power of many other weather archetypes, which have an easier time maintaining momentum because of the offensive pressure that Mega Charizard Y and Tyranitar can impose on the field. Politoed itself, however, struggles to match the utility or power of other Water-types such as Rotom-W and Keldeo, respectively. Additionally, Politoed gets beaten by the numerous Electric- and Grass-types in the metagame such as Rotom-W and Ferrothorn, and Water- and Grass-types can take advantage of Politoed as well because it cannot threaten them. However, although Water-, Electric-, and Grass-types beat it, they absolutely hate switching into Politoed because rain-boosted Scald is a decently powerful move with a high burn chance. This is especially annoying for Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Ferrothorn because being burned means they will not be able to keep their utility during the game, as well as Ferrothorn losing out on damage.</p> <p>While Politoed is a decent support Pokemon, it can also run a Choice Specs set that can deal tons of damage, even though you'll trade all its utility away for it. Choice Specs Politoed essentially converts Politoed into both a weather setter and a respectable attacker. Because rain often makes Politoed's partner very threatening, having a slower but still hard-hitting Politoed creates a two-on-two situation rather than allowing your opponent to essentially ignore Politoed. That said, Choice Specs Politoed has its strengths but also its weaknesses, such as being unable to switch moves, lacking Speed, and having less bulk.</p> ",

A Choice Specs set with Hydro Pump / Scald / Ice Beam / Focus Blast or Psychic can be used to make up for Politoed's somewhat low offenses, but this makes Politoed a far less reliable setter of rain and only really works on Trick Room teams. Choice Scarf can also be used; although it requires full Speed and Special Attack investment, but you will be able to catch opponents off guard. Note that this set is better suited for teams that aren't reliant on rain and is usually less effective than Politoed's other sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Because sun halves the Base Power of Water-type attacks, opposing Mega Charizard Y and other Fire-type Pokemon don't mind Scald when sun is up. The pair of Mega Charizard Y and Venusaur is able to use strong Grass-type moves on Politoed, and Politoed does hardly any damage in return while sun is up. Hail can also be fairly annoying because Mega Abomasnow resists Politoed's attacks and can do a ton of damage with its Grass-type moves in return.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Thundurus and Rotom-W have the ability to 2HKO Politoed with Thunderbolt, the latter also resisting both of Politoed's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Most Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur can take any attack from Politoed and hit back hard with their STAB moves. Amoonguss doesn't care about Politoed, even if Politoed locks it into an unfavorable move with Encore.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Politoed has trouble with strong attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Gardevoir, and Hydreigon, all of which can take it out with their sheer power.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald provides Politoed with a reliable STAB attack that has a chance to cripple and burn threats such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Metagross, which otherwise could be threatening for your team. Icy Wind is a spread move that drops the foes' Speed by one stage. It's mainly used to support the team, but it does a decent amount of damage to Landorus-T and Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Latios. Helping Hand works well with offensive partners, especially Swift Swim sweepers, by boosting their damage output and letting them get key KOs. Encore is an alternative too, allowing Politoed to lock foes into non-threatening moves such as Protect, Substitute, and Fake Out. Protect lets Politoed scout, stall out field conditions, rack up chip and burn damage, and avoid taking an otherwise deadly attack.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A standard 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD EV spread with a Bold nature allows Politoed to tank as many physical hits as possible and significantly boosts its overall bulk. Sitrus Berry allows Politoed to survive for longer, while Damp Rock allows Politoed to support its team even better by offering more turns of rain. Drizzle immediately sets up rain as Politoed switches in, which is the only reason to use Politoed. You can use 0 Speed IVs and a Relaxed nature on Politoed so that it can lock Trick Room setters such as Cresselia into Trick Room with Encore.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Politoed can use Drizzle to cancel other weather conditions such as sun and sand. Politoed is especially a great switch-in to Mega Charizard Y, as it removes the sun from Drought and forces Mega Charizard Y to switch out with the threat of Scald. It will still have to be careful, though, because if Mega Charizard Y switches back in while Politoed is still on the field, your team is in trouble until rain is up again. It is important to note that to support its teammates as long as possible, Politoed has to stay alive for as long as possible to keep rain up. Use Encore to lock foes into support moves or other harmless moves. Use Helping Hand for a power boost only if necessary. If you use a Pokemon with a sleep-inducing move on your team, be careful with using Scald, as it might burn a foe that you would rather put to sleep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Swift Swim sweepers such as Ludicolo, Kingdra, and Mega Swampert work well with Politoed, because their Speed stats get doubled by Drizzle. Even though Mega Charizard Y doesn't like to face Politoed, a fast and strong Electric-type such as Thundurus, Raikou, or Thundurus-T is often beneficial to get rid of it. Their offensive presence and perfectly accurate Thunder allow them to check other foes besides Mega Charizard Y, such as opposing Keldeo and Talonflame. The only downside to Electric-types is that they have a lot of trouble switching in directly. Bulky Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Mega Mawile, and Aegislash resist Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks and benefit from the rain removing their weakness to Fire. Having a Steel-type on your team also helps to check Kyurem-B, which is often used for beating rain teams. However, Kyurem-B still hits really hard with Earth Power and Steel-types have trouble switching in directly. Intimidate support from the likes of Landorus-T can help Politoed survive longer. Teammates that can check opposing Electric- and Grass-types, such as Kyurem-B and Hydreigon, also work really well because they can soak up attacks aimed at Politoed. Other strong Flying-types such as Talonflame and Togekiss are very useful for cleaning up bulkier Grass-type Pokemon. Fast Dragon-types such as Kyurem-B, Hydreigon, Latios, and Garchomp to an extent are good picks to beat sun teams and opposing rain teams. Surprisingly, Fire-types such as Talonflame and Heatran are great on rain teams because they check Grass-types and are even stronger when rain faces sun. Fairies such as Mega Gardevoir and Mega Diancie are good picks because they can also beat Kyurem-B. Mega Diancie also beats Thundurus and Mega Charizard Y, both of which are big threats to rain too.</p> "

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Scizor might seem like a potent threat; it has only one weakness, it's considerably strong when it sets up with Swords Dance, and it efficiently uses strong priority. Compelling as these reasons may be, Scizor is, simply put, a less-than-mediocre Pokemon in Doubles OU. Despite it having only one weakness, this same weakness leaves it immediately exploitable for any Fire-type or anything with Fire-type coverage, either of which is commonly found on most teams. Common Water-types also threaten it to a lesser extent by virtue of resisting Scizor's Bullet Punch and being able to do considerable damage or burn it with their own STAB moves. Scizor is also the bearer of lackluster STAB coverage and low Speed, forcing it to rely on Bullet Punch as its main STAB move. Due to this, it is usually outclassed by the likes of Mega Metagross and Aegislash as an offensive Steel-type and by Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Diancie as a Mega Evolution. However, Scizor can still be used, albeit with an ounce of viability. It can become a somewhat threatening setup sweeper with Swords Dance and its strong priority boosted by Technician. Furthermore, being primarily a priority attacker, it can avoid being beaten by opposing forms of speed control, and it still beats Mega Diancie.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>For an alternative to Knock Off, Bug Bite could be used for a somewhat strong secondary STAB move that also can nab a Sitrus Berry from an opposing Rotom-W if Scizor is running at least 92 Speed EVs. Aerial Ace could also be used for Keldeo and Amoonguss, as can Superpower for Mega Kangaskhan and Heatran. As Scizor has a decent support movepool, it could also run a support set with moves such as Feint, Tailwind, and Quick Guard.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Talonflame, Heatran, Infernape, and Mega Charizard Y, or Pokemon that commonly carry Fire-type coverage, such as Hydreigon and Salamence, all immensely threaten Scizor by exploiting its prominent weakness to Fire-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: An opposing Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Gengar and Rotom-W stops Scizor dead in its tracks, but Intimidate is not that much of a menace due to Swords Dance outweighing Intimidate's single drop in Attack.</p> <p><strong>Quick Guard: As Scizor primarily relies on Bullet Punch for attacking, Quick Guard users such as Keldeo and Terrakion weaken Scizor's offensive presence and force it to use only Knock Off to attack.</p> ",

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Bullet Punch is Scizor's main attacking move and boasts priority as well a boost from both Technician and STAB. Knock Off provides useful coverage for threats that Bullet Punch cannot hit, such as Aegislash and Jirachi, and is otherwise a useful neutral coverage attack. Swords Dance is the only reason to use Scizor; by boosting Scizor's Attack to threatening levels, it's the best way to prevent Scizor from being outclassed by the likes of Genesect and Mega Metagross. Protect allows Scizor to stall out a turn in order to allow time for an ally to get rid of an opposing threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>As Scizor doesn't really rely on its Speed by virtue of being a priority-based attacker, maximum HP and Attack investment and an Adamant nature are recommended. Scizor can also use 252 HP / 80 Atk / 176 SpD with a Careful nature to avoid the 2HKO from offensive Thundurus, allowing for more setup opportunities, albeit at the cost of less immediate attacking power. Scizor's ability pre-Mega Evolution doesn't really matter, but Light Metal is used for the rare instance that Scizor switches in on a weight-dependent move such as Low Kick.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Before setting up, it's usually a good idea to remove threats to Scizor, mainly Fire-types, in order to maximize its potential on the field. As it is most effective at threatening opposing teams when boosted by Swords Dance, time is money with Scizor, and it should begin to set up as soon as possible. Fortunately, Scizor has relatively good bulk and is able to set up in the face of many common threats, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Diancie, and Kyurem-B. Scizor can also be used as an effective late-game sweeper with its strong priority, as it is able to clean up a weakened team even through opposing speed control. It can also use its strong priority to effectively revenge kill faster foes.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>To be used viably, Scizor mandates teammates that counter opposing Fire-types. For example, Water-types such as Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Gyarados can all be paired with Scizor to discourage opposing Fire-types from switching in. Landorus-T and Terrakion can also heavily threaten opposing Fire-types with their Ground- or Rock-type coverage. By the same token, a check to opposing sun teams, such as your own Fire-type, is also useful. Fire-types also benefit from Scizor threatening Mega Diancie. Examples of good Fire-type partners include Talonflame, Heatran, and Rotom-H. Redirection is also a useful mode of support to use with Scizor so that it has the easiest time setting up. However, some of the most widely applicable redirectors, such as Jirachi and Amoonguss, stack a Fire-type weakness with Scizor. With that in mind, Scizor teams have limited viable redirection options, but some good ones include Togekiss and Clefairy. Wide Guard users such as Swampert and Conkeldurr also benefit Scizor by letting it avoid an opposing Heat Wave, the most common Fire-type attack, which would ignore redirection by virtue of being a spread move.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Despite possessing an enormous base 185 Attack stat, Mega Heracross is held back by an unfortunate Speed tier and an inability to take on a few common threats such as Aegislash and Landorus-T. Its ability Skill Link allows its powerful multi-hit moves to hit many foes for quite a lot of damage and break a potential Focus Sash on Weavile or Breloom. Sadly, weaknesses to common attacking types in Fire, Flying, and Fairy often prevent Mega Heracross from getting off such attacks before being KOed. It's also almost directly outclassed by Mega Kangaskhan, which has better Speed and typing as well as access to priority moves and methods of setup. All in all, your Mega slot is mostly wasted on Mega Heracross.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A couple coverage moves could be worth consideration—Knock Off allows Mega Heracross to hit Aegislash, which normally doesn't fear it at all, and Bullet Seed nails bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune. Sadly, these force Mega Heracross to sacrifice Rock Blast, which lets it take on Flying- and Fire-types that try to switch in. Moxie is a generally inferior ability to Guts, but it can come in handy if Heracross is able to pick off a weakened threat before it Mega Evolves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Faster Fire-types such as Infernape and Talonflame easily OHKO Mega Heracross with their STAB moves, and Talonflame also has priority Brave Bird to circumvent any potential speed control that Heracross's side may have set.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon: Fast Psychic-types like Deoxys-A and Latios can remove Mega Heracross with ease, though they cannot switch in for fear of Pin Missile.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Mega Diancie and Mega Gardevoir outspeed and OHKO Mega Heracross, though they cannot switch in on it. Sylveon is bulky enough to take any of Mega Heracross's attacks with ease and easily knocks it out with Hyper Voice.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash: Aegislash is the only relevant Pokemon that resists all of Heracross's common moves, and it has a colossal Defense stat while in Shield forme that prevents Mega Heracross from dealing more than a small amount of chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: As a physical attacker, Mega Heracross is held back by Intimidate users and any Pokemon that can burn it. Landorus-T, Gyarados, and Salamence also benefit from their Flying-type granting a resistance to Mega Heracross's STAB combo. However, the latter two must be wary of Rock Blast. Gengar is immune to Close Combat and able to outspeed Mega Heracross and burn it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Close Combat is Mega Heracross's primary attack, with high Base Power and perfect accuracy making it a reliable option on all targets that don't resist it. Pin Missile takes advantage of Skill Link and is Mega Heracross's secondary STAB move, taking on Focus Sash users such as Weavile and Breloom as well as Psychic-types like Cresselia that may try to switch in on Close Combat. Rock Blast also takes advantage of Skill Link while nailing the Fire- and Flying-types that might try to defeat Mega Heracross such as Mega Charizard Y and Thundurus. Protect allows Heracross to shield itself from attacks or stall out certain field conditions.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Guts is chosen as the pre-Mega ability so that Heracross has the option to postpone Mega Evolution and fire off boosted Close Combats should it be targeted by Will-O-Wisp. Power is prioritized in Mega Heracross's EV spread, with the remaining EVs split in a variety of possible ways between Speed and HP. Most of the time, Mega Heracross should use maximum Speed to outspeed standard bulky Mega Charizard Y or Mega Gardevoir sets, among others, as there are few relevant bulk benchmarks worth aiming for. However, if you wish to invest a bit more in bulk, there are a few lower Speed benchmarks worth considering. 216 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Mega Heracross to outspeed Breloom and OHKO it with Pin Missile before it is put to sleep by Spore. If Breloom is not an issue, an Adamant nature may be used instead for more power while still outpacing standard Bisharp. If Mega Heracross is being used on a team that features Trick Room, the Speed EVs may be moved to HP and a Brave nature may be used instead.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Heracross can opt to hold off on Mega Evolving as needed in order to take advantage of the higher base Speed, as it outspeeds base 80 Pokemon such as Hoopa-U before it Mega Evolves. However, it should only do so on a turn in which it plans to attack if burned. Use Pin Missile to take on Focus Sash users and Close Combat against Sitrus Berry Pokemon if there's no difference in type effectiveness. Mega Heracross generally operates best as a late-game cleaner when opposing Intimidate users and Flying-types have been removed, though it is also effective at applying pressure early- or mid-game with its sheer power. While Mega Heracross's attacking power is nothing to scoff at, there are few, if any, teams in which it will not be outclassed, so make sure that Mega Kangaskhan would not fit the team in question better.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Speed control is almost essential for Mega Heracross to have a shot at success, so common Tailwind setters like Zapdos and Latios fit well on Mega Heracross teams. Partners to take on Talonflame and Landorus-T are similarly important, so Rotom-W often fits well. Bisharp and Landorus are two solid options that take on both Aegislash and Landorus-T, which wall Mega Heracross. An Aegislash on Mega Heracross's own side of the field provides Wide Guard support to shield it from Heat Wave and Pixilate Hyper Voice and also beats troublesome Fairy-types.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Kingdra's incredible speed in the rain thanks to Swift Swim, unique typing, and access to the spread move Muddy Water make it a top choice for a rain team. It is an exceptional late-game sweeper when backed by the rain boost due to the STAB Water-type spread move combined with its quite decent Special Attack stat. Kingdra's unique typing also gives it many benefits; traditional Water-type checks such as Kyurem-B and Hydreigon are blown back by its secondary STAB move, and defensively, the typing only leaves it with two weaknesses while giving it handy resistances to common attacking types like Water and Fire. However, Kingdra has very mediocre stats across the board, including both defenses. It is wide open to being sniped by priority attacks such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Bisharp's Sucker Punch after only a bit of prior damage. It also faces competition from other common Swift Swim users such as Ludicolo and Mega Swampert; the former can break past bulky Water-types, the bane of Kingdra, and the latter is immune to Thunder Wave, which cripples Kingdra for the entirety of the match. Finally, Kingdra is nearly worthless without its preferred field conditions intact. If it is not raining or the opponent has the speed advantage from using Trick Room or Tailwind, Kingdra is completely ineffective.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Scald is a more reliable option to Hydro Pump with an additional chance to burn but lacks the immediate power that Kingdra desires. Similarly, Dragon Pulse is a more reliable Dragon-type STAB move but suffers the same drawback as Scald. Lum Berry is an option to prevent status, specifically paralysis from Thunder Wave users such as Thundurus. Disable disrupts the opponent's move choices and works quite well with Politoed's common support move of Encore, forcing the foe to Struggle, and Mega Gengar's Shadow Tag ability, disallowing the ability to switch. Ice Beam finishes off weakened Amoonguss without forcing Kingdra to incur Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop but suffers from having largely redundant coverage. Splash Plate increases the power of Kingdra's most spammable option while keeping it healthy and out of range of strong priority, though it gives Kingdra less power and does not boost Draco Meteor's damage output.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters:</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Bulky Grass-types like Ferrothorn and Amoonguss switch into Water-type attacks with ease and are generally Kingdra's best counters, retaliating with Power Whip and Spore, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Kingdra struggles to break through bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Assault Vest Ludicolo, which can proceed to threaten Kingdra or its partner in return.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Azumarill can switch into Draco Meteor thanks to their immunity and stomach a Water-type attack while retaliating with a STAB Fairy-type move.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: When the rain is not up, Kingdra struggles to do anything meaningful to the opposing team, as it loses out on the Swift Swim speed boost. Weather setters such as Mega Charizard Y and Abomasnow, while being directly threatened by Kingdra's strong attacks, are very annoying to deal with, as they get rid of Kingdra's most valuable asset.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: The most effective way of preventing a Kingdra from barreling through a team is a Prankster Thunder Wave from a Pokemon such as Thundurus. A paralyzed Kingdra is unable to do its job and can be easily KOed due to its mediocre defenses. Trick Room, coming from Pokemon such as Cresselia and Reuniclus, and Tailwind, used commonly by Suicune and Hydreigon, also mess with its Speed advantage and prevent it from cleaning up late-game.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks: Due to Kingdra's mediocre defenses, it is unable to clean up late-game when threatened by strong priority attacks such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Bisharp's Sucker Punch.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Muddy Water functions as Kingdra's primary STAB move, dealing significant damage under the rain to neutral targets while also OHKOing many Fire-, Ground-, and Rock-types such as Heatran, Landorus-T, and Terrakion. It also has a 30% chance to drop accuracy, which is useful for having a chance to avoid attacks from slower enemies. Draco Meteor is Kingdra's powerful secondary STAB attack that covers the Dragon-types such as Kyurem-B and Hydreigon that resist Muddy Water. It also dents Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Volcanion that can take Water-type attacks with ease. Hydro Pump is a single-target move that nukes anything it hits, which is useful for finishing off Pokemon that are not in the range for Muddy Water. Because it is not a spread attack, it hits the foes through Wide Guard's protection, allowing Kingdra to hit the common users, Conkeldurr and Aegislash, for massive damage. Protect is a staple move in Doubles, giving Kingdra the ability to stall out field conditions like Trick Room and allowing its partner to improve Kingdra's position. Substitute is a potential option that makes Kingdra exponentially more difficult to deal with. This shields it from status and allows it to avoid getting hit by Sucker Punch from Pokemon like Bisharp and Mega Kangaskhan, as well as taking a strong hit for Kingdra.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>As an offensive powerhouse, Kingdra needs all the investment it can get into Special Attack, so it opts for as much power as possible as well as a Modest nature. Maximum Speed investment is used to tie with opposing Kingdra and outspeed positive-natured base 70s like Breloom when rain is not up or when the opposition is under Tailwind. Swift Swim gives Kingdra the speed necessary to function well. Life Orb allows Kingdra to hit harder while retaining the ability to switch up moves, which is valuable for a late-game cleaner that needs to position itself well on the field with Protect. 152 HP / 160 SpA / 60 SpD / 136 Spe is an option for a more bulky spread with Substitute. This EV spread lets Kingdra's Substitutes survive an Amoonguss Giga Drain while still outspeeding neutral-natured base 70s outside of rain.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to its insane power, spread, and lack of drawbacks, Muddy Water is the main attack Kingdra will be using unless it desperately needs to KO a certain Pokemon currently on the field. Be very wary of using Draco Meteor, as having to switch Kingdra out or leave in a crippled one can lead to a huge loss of momentum. Using Draco Meteor on a switch-in that resists it also gives up a ton of momentum. Note that -2 Kingdra is still a threat with its Water-type moves. Try to save Kingdra for the late-game, as it is very hard for a weakened team to be able to tank rain-boosted Muddy Waters, but make sure priority users such as Talonflame and Thundurus are out of the way first. Sacrificing Politoed after rain has run out in the late-game for a free switch in to Kingdra tends to be an effective maneuver, as it leaves Kingdra untouched with five or eight fresh turns of rain. If using Substitute, attempt to set up it on predicted Protects or Sucker Punches, which are especially easy to predict when the opponent is stalling out rain turns.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Politoed is mandatory with Kingdra, as it provides rain with its ability. Its access to Helping Hand can help Kingdra sweep, and its own Water-type attacks can weaken Kingdra's checks for later. Mega Gengar traps problematic Grass-types with Shadow Tag to get rid of them and can help trap other weather setters like Mega Charizard Y and Abomasnow. Though a somewhat rare situation, it can also prevent the opponent from pivoting around to lure Kingdra into dropping its Special Attack with Draco Meteor. Teammates that take out threats to Kingdra such as Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame are appreciated. Some examples include Terrakion and Mega Diancie. Kingdra requires teammates that can break down bulky Water-types like Suicune. Electric- and Grass-types such as Thundurus and Mega Venusaur work quite well.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Porygon2 is a solid Trick Room supporter because its incredible bulk, lack of many weaknesses, and access to Recover make it very difficult to brute force down for the KO. It takes little damage from most attackers, avoiding 2HKOs from even the heaviest hitters in the metagame such as Mega Charizard Y, and it is able to Recover its HP against weaker attackers. Notably, Porygon2 is one of the rare Trick Room setters without a weakness to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks, letting it set up Trick Room in the face of Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Aegislash, which otherwise trouble Trick Room setters.</p> <p>However, Porygon2 is reliant on Eviolite for its bulk, meaning it is weak to Knock Off and cannot use any other items such as Safety Goggles. As a result, Taunt and Spore completely nullify Porygon2's presence and deny its attempts at setting up Trick Room. Porygon2 also lacks relevant resistances and needs to stay at high HP to be effective, so it needs to use Recover more often than not. This, combined with its mediocre offenses, turns Porygon2 to a huge momentum sink and in turn opens up the opponent to simply ignore Porygon2 and set up or gang up on its partner.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder Wave instead of Trick Room is another option for speed control. However, Porygon2 is generally outclassed by other Thunder Wave users, such as Thundurus and Ferrothorn. Magic Coat denies Taunt, while Protect takes advantage of double targeting, but losing coverage leaves Porygon2 even more of a sitting duck, while losing Recover makes Porygon2 too easy to take down with repeated attacks. Blizzard can be an option over Ice Beam with Mega Abomasnow as a teammate, but note that Porygon2 needs a Quiet nature with 16 Special Attack EVs to guarantee the OHKO on Landorus-T and Salamence. Hidden Power Ground hits most Steel-types hard and particularly punishes Heatran. Alternatively, Thunderbolt has good coverage alongside Ice Beam, notably hitting Keldeo and Azumarill. Finally, Tri Attack is Porygon2's best STAB move that hits most Pokemon equally hard. Unfortunately, this means that Porygon2 is hitting everything for equally little damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Fighting-type moves from the likes of Keldeo, Terrakion, Conkeldurr, and Scrafty can threaten Porygon2 with massive damage, forcing it to switch out. Scrafty and Conkeldurr are notable for functioning well in the Trick Room that Porygon2 can set up, while Keldeo and Terrakion are commonly seen with Taunt, which stops it from using Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Bulky hard hitters that aren't weak to any of Porygon2's moves, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Kyurem-B, Mega Gardevoir, and Sylveon, can mostly ignore Porygon2's damage. In particular, having Pokemon that can do more damage than Porygon2 can Recover off with a single attack, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Overheat Mega Charizard Y, is an efficient way of taking it down.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Common Taunt users such as Thundurus, Gengar, and Keldeo stop Porygon2 from using Trick Room and Recover altogether, leaving it with little to do.</p> <p><strong>Sleep: Spore users such as Amoonguss and Breloom will put Porygon2 to sleep before it can set up Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out: Mega Kangaskhan, Scrafty, and Weavile are commonly seen with Fake Out, and they can delay Porygon2 from using Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Scrafty, Weavile, and Bisharp can Knock Off Porygon2's Eviolite and make it much easier to take down. Without its Eviolite, Porygon2 is easily taken down by most offensive Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Residual damage via Leech Seed from Ferrothorn, Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W and Gengar, or Scald burns from Suicune and Politoed can add up very quickly, forcing Porygon2 to waste more turns using Recover.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Bulky setup Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Calm Mind Cresselia, and Belly Drum Azumarill can ignore Porygon2 for the most part and start setting up. However, physical setup Pokemon such as Power-Up Punch Mega Kangaskhan need to watch out for Foul Play, as it will do a lot of damage to them.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Trick Room lets your slower Pokemon attack first. Recover augments Porygon2's great bulk, lets Porygon stick around to set up Trick Room multiple times over the course of the match, and takes advantage of opposing Protect, a move commonly used to stall out Trick Room turns. Ice Beam is useful against many common Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Amoonguss. Foul Play is another offensive option that punishes Power-Up Punch Kangaskhan and Aegislash and generally deals high damage to the likes of Hoopa-U and Mega Metagross.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs maximize Porygon2's bulk, 160 Defense EVs allow it to survive Life Orb Terrakion's Close Combat from full health, and 76 Special Defense EVs with a Sassy nature let Porygon2 survive a Heat Wave followed by Overheat from Mega Charizard Y with good probability. Finally, 20 Special Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO on Landorus-T and Salamence with Ice Beam. Eviolite is necessary for the additional bulk. Download's Special Attack boost lets Porygon2 take out Substitutes from common users such as Kyurem-B and generally gives it more offensive presence. Trace can copy helpful abilities such as Intimidate and Magic Bounce, but it is equally likely to copy a useless ability.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Setting up Trick Room should be Porygon2's priority whenever it would be advantageous. Be wary of common checks to Trick Room such as Amoonguss and Thundurus: against obvious Spore or Taunt it is generally better to switch out or attack. Porygon2's biggest perk as a Trick Room supporter is that it can reliably set up Trick Room multiple times in a match. Therefore, it is important to use Recover liberally to get its HP back from setup turns so that it has a chance to come in at a later time. However, if it is still at high HP, it is a good idea to switch out to a more favorable attacker that better takes advantage of the Trick Room turns.</p> <p>Generally, Porygon2 is too weak to be used for attacking, so try to not waste turns by using attacking moves. Still, using super effective moves to pick off weakened foes is often worth it. Because only a few Pokemon can deal meaningful damage to Porygon2, it can function as a wincon in the late-game, and if you aim for it to do so, try to keep it as healthy as possible and avoid switching it into a position where it can be knocked out by hard hitters before getting to do anything. For instance, a combination of hard-hitting attacks or super effective moves, such as Mega Kangaskhan's Return and Keldeo's Secret Sword, will take it out before it has a chance to do anything.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fake Out support from Scrafty and Mega Kangaskhan lets Porygon2 overcome opposing Taunt or Spore and gives it some freedom to set up. In addition, Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Scrafty soften up physical hits with Intimidate so that Porygon2 is even harder to take down. It is important to make sure your team has enough slow attackers to take advantage of Trick Room. For instance, Heatran, Mega Camerupt, and Mega Abomasnow are good attackers in Trick Room. They also handle Amoonguss and Thundurus, and the former two can take out problematic Steel-types. It is wise to cover Porygon2's weakness to Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion with Pokemon such as Sylveon and Amoonguss.</p> <p>Due to Porygon2's weakness to classic Trick Room solutions such as Taunt, sleep, and Fake Out, it is necessary to have a backup plan to tackle fast attackers without relying on Porygon2 setting up Trick Room. This is typically done by carrying a secondary Trick Room setter or by having your team be functional outside of it. As for secondary Trick Room setters, Pokemon such as Hoopa-U and Reuniclus provide some offensive presence as well as Trick Room support, while Jellicent or Cresselia provides another sturdy Trick Room supporter that beats opposing Fighting-types. Finally, Talonflame provides strong priority as a contingency plan outside of Trick Room, threatens Amoonguss, and beats Fighting-types such as Blaziken and Keldeo.</p> "

  "Hitmontop": {
    "overview": "<p>Although he might not look the part, Hitmontop can act as a passable supporting Pokemon in Doubles. With access to a wide array of amazing support moves such as Fake Out, Wide Guard, and Feint, Hitmontop will pull his weight in many matches. In addition to that, he has access to Intimidate, which allows him to cripple physical attackers, augmenting his already decent bulk.</p> <p>However, there are a couple of things that hamper Hitmontop in doing what he does best. First and foremost, despite his great defenses, even with Intimidate, he can't take repeated hits very well due to his disappointing HP stat and mediocre defensive typing, which doesn't give him many valuable resistances. He also lacks reliable recovery, another downfall for something that will have to take hits multiple times throughout the battle. Furthermore, he has serious four-moveslot syndrome. Being severely vulnerable to burns and losing to pretty much anything that resists his STAB moves doesn't help his case either. Finally, Hitmontop faces lots of competition from Scrafty, which has a secondary Dark typing that allows it to beat the Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon that Hitmontop struggles against.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hitmontop's movepool has many great moves to utilize outside of what's been listed, and if you can manage to find room on his moveset for one of these, they will surely be helpful. Helping Hand is an excellent option which allows his teammates to hit harder, which is appreciated by many powerful threats that commonly accompany him. Stone Edge is a neat option to hit Flying-types such as Talonflame and Thundurus hard on the switch. An Assault Vest set consisting of Fake Out / Close Combat / Stone Edge / Feint or Sucker Punch and an EV spread of 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe with an Adamant nature is a cool option, but it faces competition from Scrafty, which trades more power and a priority move for more durability and a Dark-type STAB move in Knock Off. Expert Belt with the same spread as the Assault Vest set is an option over the standard Sitrus Berry set, allowing Hitmontop to score some OHKOs he usually wouldn't get, such as an OHKO on Heatran. Stone Edge works especially well on this set, scoring a guaranteed OHKO on 4 HP Thundurus as well as a guaranteed 2HKO on standard Salamence. A Lum Berry may be used to prevent burns and act as a one-time switch-in to Spore.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Landorus-T and Gyarados can weaken Hitmontop with Intimidate and resist Close Combat. Will-O-Wisp cripples Hitmontop by halving its attack, and Ghost-type users such as Gengar and Jellicent are especially dangerous, as Hitmontop can't do anything to them in return.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Mega Diancie, Mega Gardevoir, and Sylveon can easily KO Hitmontop with a super effective STAB move. Togekiss deserves a special mention, as she not only 4x resists Fighting, but she also can redirect Hitmontop's Close Combat thanks to Follow Me, meaning that Hitmontop has no means of doing anything useful while she's on the field.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type: Psychic-types such as Latios and Mega Metagross can heavily dent Hitmontop with their Psychic-type moves while taking anything it can hit back with.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame: Talonflame can take Close Combat and KO with Brave Bird. However, it has to watch out for the Attack drop from Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore</strong>: Taunt users such as Thundurus-I and Aerodactyl can prevent Hitmontop from using Wide Guard and Quick Guard, thus prevent him from doing his job successfully. Encore also stops Hitmontop, as he hates being locked into something like Fake Out, but Encore is a rather rare move.</p> ",

        "name": "Utility",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With this set, Hitmontop is able to disrupt the opponent and protect himself and his allies from threatening attacks as efficiently as possible, giving leeway to his partner to do some serious damage to the opposing team. Fake Out is an excellent move in Doubles, allowing Hitmontop to disarm a dangerous opposing threat right after he switches in. Close Combat is Hitmontop's most reliable STAB attack, dealing decent amounts of damage to anything that doesn't resist it and preventing him from becoming setup bait. The choice between Wide Guard and Quick Guard depends on what your team needs most: Wide Guard is the best option when you are using Pokemon that are threatened by common spread moves like Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Heat Wave, whereas Quick Guard is the preferred option when you're using a team that isn't bulky enough to comfortably take common priority moves, such as Talonflame's Brave Bird, Mega Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch, and Breloom's Mach Punch. Quick Guard also helps defend against Thundurus's Prankster Thunder Wave and against slower Fake Outs. For the last moveslot, Feint is usually the best option, breaking opposing Protects, Wide Guards, and Quick Guards, making it easier for a teammate to deal heavy damage. As a bonus, it can pick off threats that are left with a small amount of HP. Detect can be used if you want to keep Hitmontop safe from harm when the going gets tough. Finally, Sucker Punch is an option to get around Psychic- and Ghost-types, which otherwise fear nothing from Hitmontop. However, it should be noted that Hitmontop doesn't have much offensive prowess, so bulkier Psychic- and Ghost-types can still easily take a Sucker Punch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The recommended EV spread allows Hitmontop to survive Mega Diancie's Moonblast. 208 Attack EVs are used because without them, Hitmontop is rather weak. A more offensive spread of 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe with an Adamant Nature is viable, as it outruns Rotom-W and hits harder, but Hitmontop usually prefers to be bulky and survive longer. Sitrus Berry is the item of choice, as Hitmontop really appreciates some recovery with all the moves he has to tank.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Considering how well he pairs up with common leads and has the ability to support them with Intimidate, Hitmontop makes for an excellent lead, disrupting non-Ghost-type Trick Room setters and breaking Focus Sashes of threats like Terrakion with Fake Out. A special mention goes to Mega Kangaskhan, as Hitmontop can form a threatening double Fake Out core with her. Not only does he function well as a lead, but his bulk also allows him to switch in and out so that he can be used anywhere throughout the game. In order to let him function to his fullest potential, it is recommended to remove opposing Will-O-Wisp users from play as soon as possible. Make sure you switch Hitmontop in when you're sure he's not going to take a powerful hit, as he's worn down rather fast without careful play. Use Close Combat with care: once his defenses have dropped, Hitmontop can't take hits well anymore and needs to switch out immediately.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to the plethora of support options provided by Hitmontop, he can fit on many teams with ease. He works best when used on teams that dislike common spread moves, so he makes an ideal partner for the likes of Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and Ferrothorn, among others. The former two also appreciate Hitmontop's Feint, breaking opposing Protects and Wide Guards and giving them the ability to spam their powerful spread moves fearlessly. Hitmontop doesn't require much support himself, but he does appreciate partners that can get rid of opposing Psychic- and Ghost-types. Therefore, Bisharp and Hoopa-U pair excellently with him.</p> "

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Tyranitar looks like a great Pokemon at first glance. It's the only viable setter of sand, and it has an extensive movepool and considerably high attacking stats. However, Tyranitar is, simply put, a lackluster Pokemon in DOU; its bad typing leaves it susceptible to a vast majority of common threats, such as Landorus-T, Keldeo, and Amoonguss. Furthermore, as Rock-types, Mega Diancie and Terrakion are generally the better pick with their immediate high Speed and more powerful STAB moves. Tyranitar also faces competition as a Dark-type from the likes of Bisharp and Hydreigon, which aren't totally beaten by Landorus-T and are able to fit on a wider range of team styles. Tyranitar's main saving grace is its ability to set sand, which, despite being the main part of a generally inconsistent team style, can be used to support an adjacent Excadrill and break a foe's Focus Sash. Tyranitar can also become a threatening sweeper when Dragon Dance is used in tandem with its decent STAB coverage, but it is so slow that it can't even outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T, its most threatening and most common foe, after a boost.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar can utilize the elemental punches to eliminate some of its usual checks, such as Thunder Punch for Keldeo, but this would require removing one of Tyranitar's important STAB moves and is usually not very useful overall. Thunder Wave could be used for speed control, but Thundurus is a much better user of it. The Tyranitarite may be forgone in favor of a Mega that better fits the team; however, Tyranitar can only utilize a Dragon Dance set well when given the extra defenses of its Mega forme. Assault Vest could also be used to increase Tyranitar's already-boosted Special Defense. Tyranitar can run a specially oriented set with Rock Slide and Shuca Berry or Life Orb to surprise its usual checks, such as Landorus-T, with its extensive movepool and to mitigate its weakness to Intimidate while also posing a bigger threat to Aegislash with Dark Pulse rather than Crunch. Weakness Policy could be used when running Dragon Dance, as Tyranitar has many weaknesses and may survive some super effective attacks.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Tyranitar's suboptimal typing leaves it with many exploitable flaws. Landorus-T is a prominent threat to Tyranitar, as the common Choice Scarf set outspeeds it even after a boost and proceeds to 2HKO it while ignoring an ally's redirection with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon prove to be threatening to Tyranitar with their Pixilate Hyper Voice. Hyper Voice, being a spread move, also cannot be avoided with an ally's redirection.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Fighting-types, such as Keldeo and Terrakion, resist both of Tyranitar's STAB types and OHKO it with their own STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Bulky Water-types, such as Azumarill and Suicune, can tank Tyranitar's hits and do more damage in return.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Breloom, and Amoonguss can survive Tyranitar's attacks and OHKO it back or immobilize it with Spore, in Amoonguss's case.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Tyranitar's boosts are mitigated by opposing Intimidate users such as Landorus-T, Gyarados, and Scrafty. A Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W also halts Tyranitar's sweeping ability.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Even after obtaining a Dragon Dance boost, Tyranitar can still be outsped and OHKOed by Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Superpower Deoxys-A, and Choice Scarf Genesect. Tyranitar needs to use Dragon Dance at least twice to outspeed these threats; otherwise, it is OHKOed or takes heavy damage from them.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Dragon Dance Tyranitar relies on being fast to shoot off its powerful STAB moves before it gets smacked, so any of these forms of speed control hampers it significantly. Thundurus, Salamence, and Cresselia all commonly carry one of these forms of speed control.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard: Wide Guard prevents Tyranitar from consistently spamming Rock Slide. Conkeldurr in particular can use Wide Guard to protect a teammate or OHKO Tyranitar with Mach Punch.</p> ",

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rock Slide is Mega Tyranitar's main attacking move. While relatively weak, it's recommended for its spread coverage and flinch chance, which works notably well after some Speed boosts from Dragon Dance. Crunch functions as Mega Tyranitar's secondary STAB move; it enables Mega Tyranitar to both target a single foe for more damage and threaten the Steel-types that resist Rock Slide, such as Aegislash and Jirachi. Dragon Dance enables Mega Tyranitar to set itself apart from other Rock- and Dark-types by boosting its Attack to impressively high levels, as well as giving it the Speed boost to outpace most Pokemon that would normally threaten it. Protect is a staple move used in doubles formats in order to stall out opposing field conditions such as Tailwind and to scout for enemy attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mega Tyranitar needs to be Mega Evolved in order to use this set well, as the Mega forme has the bulk and offenses to utilize Dragon Dance to its fullest extent. Mega Tyranitar should be running Sand Stream in order to disrupt opposing weather conditions on the switch, break Focus Sashes, boost its Special Defense, and potentially support Excadrill. Although Mega Tyranitar cannot outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T after just one boost, it can still run maximum Speed in order to outspeed other fast Pokemon when boosted, such as Mega Gengar, Darkrai, and Weavile, while still retaining a potent offensive presence. Adamant can be used over Jolly for more power while also still being able to outspeed base 110 Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Latios.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In order to make the most use of Mega Tyranitar's bulk, it should start setting up instantly, when it is at a healthy range of HP. That being said, Mega Tyranitar is best used as a late-game sweeper, when its checks are removed and the rest of the opponent's team is weakened. Use Sand Stream to your advantage, as the ability to break an enemy's Focus Sash is incredibly useful.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Redirection support in order to help Mega Tyranitar grab boosts greatly benefits it. Specifically, redirection users that can both tank Fighting-type attacks and threaten Landorus-T pair the best with Mega Tyranitar. Therefore, Amoonguss, Togekiss, Jirachi, and Clefairy are all viable choices for this role. Excadrill is one of the most advantageous partners for Mega Tyranitar, as it's the only viable user of Sand Rush. Furthermore, its STAB coverage allows it to remove certain checks to Mega Tyranitar, namely Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Mega Diancie. However, Excadrill stacks weaknesses to Fighting- and Water-type attacks. Wide Guard users, mainly Aegislash and Conkeldurr, support Mega Tyranitar by providing an immunity to opposing Earthquake and Pixilate Hyper Voice. Checks to Landorus-T, such as Keldeo and Rotom-W, are also needed on the team in order to allow Mega Tyranitar to function well. Fighting-types pose a massive threat to Mega Tyranitar, so allies such as Latios and Talonflame are valuable to it. Bulky Grass-types and Spore users such as Ferrothorn and Amoonguss also stand in Mega Tyranitar's way of sweeping, so checks to those such as Heatran, Infernape, Talonflame, and most Safety Goggles users support it well. Bulky Water-types threaten Mega Tyranitar's sweep as well, so Pokemon such as Thundurus, Amoonguss, and Rotom-W provide apt support to it.</p> "

Its unique Grass / Dragon typing along with its ability, Lightning Rod, grants it an immunity to Rage Powder, Spore, and Thunder Wave, giving it a very small niche on certain offensive teams, such as those that really, really appreciate an Electric immunity, redirection of Electric-type moves, and immunity to sleep-inducing moves or are especially susceptible to Thunder Wave. However, Sceptile is hurt by its mediocre defenses, as well as its weaknesses to common moves such as Ice Beam, Draco Meteor, and Pixilate Hyper Voice, meaning it has few opportunities to switch in. Sceptile's poor defenses also mean that it is OHKOed by or takes major damage from every common priority attack, rendering its high Speed fairly ineffective in a lot of cases. It is also fairly linear in its options due to a limited movepool.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sceptile can run Substitute to avoid potentially fatal attacks, but this is generally not a good idea because Sceptile already brings little to the table and needs all the coverage options it can get.

Hidden Power Fire can be used to beat Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, but it lowers Sceptile's Speed by 1 point and has little use outside of beating them. Quick Guard lets Mega Sceptile provide additional support to its teammates and can let it get around pesky priority moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Fairy-type Pokemon such as Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir can switch in on Sceptile and either force it out or KO it.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon: Flying-types such as Togekiss and Talonflame can beat Sceptile, with Togekiss redirecting every one of its moves with ease and Talonflame circumventing Sceptile's high Speed with Gale Wings.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon: Ice-type Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Weavile can OHKO Sceptile before it moves with Choice Scarf Ice Beam and priority Ice Shard, respectively, though neither can switch in on Sceptile's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types such as Aegislash, Jirachi, and Mega Metagross can switch in on any of Sceptile's standard moves and proceed to 2HKO or OHKO it; Jirachi can also redirect Sceptile's attacks with ease.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Due to its mediocre defenses, Sceptile can be OHKOed or 2HKOed by any strong neutral attack, such as Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave or Mega Kangaskhan's Return.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Weather sweepers such as Venusaur, Ludicolo, Kingdra, and Mega Swampert can outrun Sceptile and KO it with super effective moves such as Sludge Bomb, Ice Beam, and Ice Punch under their respective weather conditions, though standard Mega Swampert is slower than Timid Mega Sceptile. Faster Choice Scarf users such as Genesect can outrun Sceptile and OHKO it with U-turn or Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind and Trick Room: Sceptile's high Speed all but guarantees that it will be the last Pokemon to move in Trick Room, allowing Pokemon that Sceptile can normally pick off to beat it. For example, under Trick Room, Cresselia can outrun Sceptile and OHKO it with Ice Beam. Tailwind allows Pokemon that Sceptile normally outruns to outspeed it and hit it hard.

If the opponent has a faster threat, always use Protect to safely Mega Evolve first turn. Sceptile should avoid super effective moves as much as possible, as well as common priority moves, almost all of which OHKO or 2HKO it.

Pokemon such as Terrakion and Keldeo work well with Sceptile, as they appreciate having bulky Water-types taken care of, and in return they can provide Quick Guard support to keep priority moves away and work well against threats such as Heatran and Charizard. Bulky Steel-type Pokemon such as Heatran and Aegislash work well with Sceptile, as Sceptile readily handes threatening Ground-types, as well as Water-types for Heatran, and in return they can beat Fairy- and Ice-types, and Aegislash can also provide Wide Guard support for temporary protection against threats such as Heatran, Abomasnow, and Charizard. Jirachi can easily redirect threatening Ice-, Dragon-, Fairy-, and Flying-type moves, while Sceptile can easily beat Ground-types for Jirachi. Boosting attackers such as Gyarados and Volcarona work well with Sceptile; Gyarados provides Intimidate support and beats Fire-types, whereas Volcarona roasts Steel- and Grass-types and both appreciate Thunder Wave being redirected.</p> "

Blaziken also faces direct competition from Talonflame and Infernape, strong Fire-types that are able to attack immediately thanks to their high base Speeds.

A physical set with Flare Blitz instead of Overheat may be somewhat viable, but it doesn't really fare well against Landorus-T or Aegislash when it uses King's Shield. Heat Wave is a useful spread attack, but it comes at the cost of doing a lot less damage. As Blaziken wants to keep all of its Speed boosts, you can also use Fire Blast over Overheat so you don't have to switch out after every Overheat or two, but Fire Blast's lower power misses out on several notable KOs, such as against Aegislash.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Bulky Water-types like to have their way with Blaziken. In particular, Politoed and rain teams in general are not so friendly to Blaziken. Keldeo can also take a Superpower from Blaziken and hit back hard with a Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Latios: Latios can take anything Blaziken can hit it with and OHKO back with a Psyshock.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Anything that can take a hit from Blaziken threaten it greatly as they can easily hit back at its paper-thin defenses. In particular, Blaziken can't touch bulky threats such as Cresselia or Sylveon, both of which hit back with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: While Blaziken most certainly does not mind Icy Wind, it becomes nothing short of dead weight when hit by Thunder Wave or under Trick Room. Opposing Tailwind also restricts it because Blaziken typically uses a single Speed boost to threaten foes that are naturally faster than it, which it can't do when the opposition is under Tailwind. However, Tailwind's duration is short enough that it can be played around, as Blaziken continues accumulating Speed boosts each turn.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks</strong>: While few things will be outspeeding Blaziken in normal circumstances, it falls victim to a lot of common priority moves. Brave Bird from Talonflame instantly destroys Blaziken, while Azumarill's Aqua Jet does a hefty 71.5 - 84.1% to Blaziken. Furthermore, Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out takes out almost half of Blaziken's health while also causing it to flinch, leaving it vulnerable for the rest of the turn. Fake Out threatens Blaziken in general as well. Being left vulnerable for the rest of the turn is very detrimental to Blaziken because of how frail it is.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Overheat is Blaziken's best option for a Fire-type STAB move; it picks up many crucial OHKOs that Fire Blast does not and is not dampened by Intimidate or King's Shield like Flare Blitz. It's recommended that you use Superpower over Low Kick due to Low Kick's inconsistency as opposed to Superpower's reliable 120 Base Power. However, Low Kick is indeed a viable option because Superpower drops Blaziken's Attack as well as its Defense, sometimes forcing a switch on your part and removing Blaziken's Speed boosts.</p> <p>Stone Edge allows Blaziken to eliminate Flying-types that would otherwise threaten it greatly such as Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, provided that Blaziken has Quick Guard support. Alternatively, Blaziken can run Hidden Power Ice in order to OHKO Landorus-T without suffering the Special Attack drop from Overheat. The choice between these two coverage moves is mostly dependent on what kind of support the rest of your team needs more. If your team is rather weak to Landorus-T, then you should consider running Hidden Power Ice. If you're weak to Mega Charizard Y, then consider using Stone Edge instead. Protect is an absolute must for any Blaziken set. Being a Speed Boost Pokemon, using Protect on Blaziken allows it to get a free boost on its Speed stat while also being invulnerable for that turn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb lets Blaziken do as much damage as possible. A Hasty nature is recommended so that Blaziken can take on special attacking Fire-types better, which are basically the only Pokemon it can switch in on. However, Naive Blaziken can tank an Azumarill Aqua Jet after two rounds of Life Orb recoil, while Hasty can only tank it after one. This matters because Blaziken OHKOes Azumarill's two most common partners, Jirachi and Amoonguss, with Overheat. 176 Special Attack EVs let Blaziken OHKO Aegislash in Shield Forme with Overheat as well. 252 Speed EVs are used to outrun Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T after one turn of Speed Boost, and the remaining EVs are placed in Attack to power up Blaziken's physical moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Blaziken starts off with a meager base 80 Speed, which doesn't outspeed most of the threats that it's supposed to be able to take care of, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Landorus-T, and Mega Metagross. The first turn out, you should use Protect if you need to outspeed a threat that's faster than Blaziken. Alternatively, try bringing in Blaziken when you're able to get a free KO in the first turn; by doing this, you aren't forced to Protect on your first turn out while you get the Speed boost up. That being said, it's not usually a good idea to switch in Blaziken in the place of an ally; instead, you might want to bring it in once an ally has fainted. Blaziken works best on offensive teams because of its good STAB coverage and its generally offensive attributes, so consider that when building around it. Although Blaziken has lots of good offensive attributes, you shouldn't try to use it as a sweeper because it doesn't have a lot of staying power. Instead, it works best when assisting its team by targeting and eliminating specific threats.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Quick Guard users such as Keldeo or Terrakion help Blaziken by blocking the priority moves that would otherwise be very harmful to it. Blaziken can't do much against Water-types, so offensive Grass- or Electric-types such as Serperior or Thundurus help it out a lot. Mega Diancie forms a great core with Blaziken and helps get rid of Pokemon that Blaziken normally has trouble with, such as Talonflame, Latios, Keldeo, and Rotom-H. In turn, Blaziken also eliminates some of Mega Diancie's checks, such as Amoonguss, Aegislash, and Landorus-T. However, this duo will need a lot of team support to get around Water-types. Bisharp, Mega Gengar, and Aegislash all help Blaziken by getting rid of Fairy-types and Cresselia. Taunt users such as Thundurus help Blaziken out by stopping the activation of Trick Room.</p> "

  "Swampert": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Swampert is a very niche rain attacker. It's the only viable physical Swift Swim attacker, as well as the only one that can reliably beat Thundurus, Sylveon, and, depending on its coverage, Ferrothorn. Its immunity to paralysis due to its Ground typing means its Speed cannot be crippled like the others'. Also, as a rain sweeper with good natural bulk, it is less weak to priority moves than other rain sweepers, notably Talonflame's Brave Bird and Mega Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch. However, being a physical attacker, Swampert is hindered by Intimidate and burns, and it is extremely weak to Grass-types, more so than other rain staples. Unlike other Swift Swimmers, it needs to Mega Evolve before it gains Swift Swim, usually giving your opponent a free turn. Finally, its secondary STAB move Earthquake is significantly weaker due to its spread reduction, and it also hits Mega Swampert's partner.</p> <p>Aside from its Mega forme, Swampert is also able to find a small niche due to its access to Wide Guard and great anti-meta coverage that allows it to take advantage of the users of spread moves that are stopped by Wide Guard, including Landorus-T, Mega Diancie, Volcanion, and Heatran. Additionally, it matches up quite well against common threats such as Talonflame, Thundurus, Jirachi, and Aegislash. Its bulk is well complemented by a strong defensive typing, making up for Swampert's low Speed that forces it to move last or close to it most turns. Like its Mega counterpart, base Swampert suffers from a lot of competition in its role on teams, primarily from Gastrodon, which offers a reliable form of recovery and a better ability in Storm Drain. Aside from Gastrodon, other bulky Water-types like Suicune and Wide Guard users such as Aegislash and Conkeldurr often fill Swampert's role on teams better than Swampert can. Although its coverage is nothing to be scoffed at, Swampert's Special Attack stat is far from impressive, leaving its attacks quite weak against resisted or neutral targets.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Swampert can run various Speed EVs other than 252 to have some EVs left over for bulk, such as 176 Speed EVs to outspeed Deoxys-A and 144 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T, both under rain. For Swampert's Water-type STAB move, Aqua Tail is slightly more powerful than Waterfall, but it lacks perfect accuracy and a chance to flinch the foe. Mega Swampert's coverage move can also be replaced by Stone Edge or Rock Slide to hit Mega Charizard Y outside of rain, but it is almost always better off with Ice Punch or Superpower. Mega Swampert can forgo a coverage move and run Substitute, as a smart Substitute can significantly boost its field time. Swampert can run Rain Dance over a coverage move in order to reduce your need to rely on Politoed to set rain. If Mega Abomasnow is being used beside base Swampert, Blizzard can provide solid, accurate spread damage that Swampert would otherwise be unable to deal.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Grass-types, namely Breloom, Amoonguss, Ludicolo, and Ferrothorn, resist or take very little damage from both of Swampert's STAB attacks and can either OHKO or cripple it in return.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Bulkier Water-types like Gyarados and Rotom-W resist Mega Swampert's strongest STAB move, Waterfall, take its coverage options with ease, and can do moderate damage to it (especially in rain) and reduce its overall effectiveness.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Because Swampert is a physical sweeper, it is crippled by burns that can be spread by Sableye and Rotom-W, the latter of which can also reliably take Swampert's attacks. It's also hindered by Intimidate, which is best provided by Gyarados and Salamence, as they can usually take Swampert's attacks (Salamence only if Swampert isn't running Ice Punch); Scrafty also can utilize Fake Out to stall rain turns.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Swampert relies heavily on rain and is relatively weak to most sun and hail teams, so replacing its weather hinders its effectiveness tremendously. Mega Charizard Y can set sun and threaten to OHKO Mega Swampert with Solar Beam, while Abomasnow threatens it with a Grass-type STAB move while replacing rain with hail.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind and Trick Room: These moves take away Mega Swampert's speed advantage, crippling its ability to stay productive on the field. Cresselia, Porygon2, and Jellicent can reliably take anything Swampert has to offer and set Trick Room. Whimsicott can set Tailwind really easily in front of Mega Swampert by making use of Prankster and then potentially OHKO it with a Grass-type STAB move, while Suicune and Zapdos can reliably take Swampert's attacks and set Tailwind in front of it.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt users such as Gengar and Gyarados prevent non-Mega Swampert from using Wide Guard to protect its allies.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Waterfall is almost always Mega Swampert's best attack, as it is a reliable and strong physical attack that is boosted by rain. Earthquake is its strongest Ground-type STAB move and also gives Mega Swampert a spread option while providing super effective coverage against Volcanion and Steel-types such as Aegislash. For Mega Swampert's third move, Ice Punch hits Grass- and Dragon-types like Amoonguss and Latios for good damage, which Mega Swampert's STAB moves can't, while Superpower provides solid coverage versus Mega Kangaskhan, Kyurem-B, and Ferrothorn. Protect is necessary because Swampert must safely Mega Evolve before it gains Swift Swim. It also either allows Swampert to stay safe from a threat for a turn while its partner deals with said threat or allows you to safely scout for a threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Running 252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature allows Mega Swampert to hit as hard as possible, while 252 Speed EVs let it outspeed all relevant threats while under rain, including Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Choice Scarf Genesect, and Deoxys-A. For pre-Mega abilities, Damp is superior to Torrent, as you won't ever use Torrent due to Swampert needing to Mega Evolve as soon as possible. Damp can also let Swampert prevent an Explosion while switching in on occasion.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Swampert is only good once it has Mega Evolved and is in rain, because otherwise its damage output is relatively low and its Speed is pretty poor. Because of this, try to maximize its time in rain by bringing it into the drizzle as early possible. When Mega Evolving Swampert, make smart use of Protect so that it can gain the Swift Swim Speed boost without consequences. Mega Swampert is best used as a mid- to late-game sweeper, as it can easily clean up once its threats, such as Grass-types and Water-types, are removed. You can also remove said threats while Swampert is on the field by having another Pokemon that can remove them, like Kyurem-B, Latios, or Talonflame, do so before they threaten Swampert.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>First and foremost, you almost always need Politoed, as Drizzle automatically sets rain so that you don't need to waste a turn doing so. You should also have some answers to Grass-types, such as Kyurem-B and Talonflame, as they will almost always beat Mega Swampert. Swampert is really weak to sun due to it being OHKOed by common sun Pokemon, like Mega Charizard Y with Solar Beam and Venusaur, so bring a few good sun checks, such as Thundurus and Talonflame. If you aren't running Superpower, strong Fighting-types like Terrakion and Conkeldurr are also good to have in order to beat Ferrothorn and Kyurem-B, which are huge threats to rain. Finally, Ground-immune Pokemon like Latios and Talonflame should be on the team so that you can attack with them while Swampert uses Earthquake.</p> "

        "name": "Non-Mega Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald serves as Swampert's primary STAB attack, as it has decent power and can chip away at foes with the helpful chance to burn. Earth Power is Swampert's strongest accurate attack, which grants Swampert helpful coverage against threats such as Volcanion and Steel-types such as Aegislash and Jirachi. Ice Beam fills out Swampert's coverage, giving it an option to hit Grass- and Dragon-types that resist its STAB moves while also allowing Swampert to OHKO Landorus-T and deal significant damage to Thundurus. Although Icy Wind is far weaker than Ice Beam, the speed control it provides can greatly help Swampert's teammates with more middling Speed. Wide Guard protects Swampert's allies from any spread attack and fits well on Swampert's moveset due to its good matchup against spread attackers such as Mega Diancie, Heatran, and Landorus-T. Hydro Pump is a viable alternative to Scald; while the drop in accuracy is quite noticeable, so is the increase in power, granting Swampert the ability to OHKO Mega Diancie without a boosting item.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread, when accompanied by a Sitrus Berry, allows Swampert to avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Aegislash's Shadow Ball or Life Orb Talonflame's Brave Bird. Alternatively, an Expert Belt set increases the power behind Swampert's moves and is usable due to its fantastic super effective coverage, though it loses out on the longevity provided by a Sitrus Berry. A Quiet nature is used instead of a Modest one so that Swampert can hit Aegislash in its Blade forme and improve its functionality inside of Trick Room, and its low Speed means that any investment will rarely help under normal field conditions anyway. Damp prevents the rare Explosion Landorus-T or Genesect from dealing major damage to Swampert's team, or Torrent powers up Scald when Swampert is low on health. Both abilities are situational at best, so the choice between the two rarely makes a difference.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Wide Guard as necessary, otherwise leaning on Swampert's decent coverage to hit many common threats. A lack of Protect can leave Swampert vulnerable to weather sweepers and Fake Out, so it may need to be switched out to avoid taking unnecessary damage. Swampert should generally be saved to beat the threats it defeats especially well, such as Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Heatran. With its solid bulk, Swampert should be able to switch in on those threats and defeat them with ease. However, due to its solid matchup against common leads such as Landorus-T and Thundurus, it can function well as a counter-lead to those threats. Due to its low Speed, Swampert should only rarely be saved for endgame scenarios, as it is unlikely to be able to clean opposing teams.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Any Pokemon that is weak to common spread moves can benefit from Swampert's partnership. Especially noteworthy options include Intimidate users such as Scrafty and Gyarados, which also augment Swampert's bulk, and setup attackers such as Volcarona, Kyurem-B, and Mega Charizard X. Fire-types such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Infernape beat Grass-types and appreciate Swampert's Wide Guard stopping Earthquake and Rock Slide. Heatran synergizes particularly well with Swampert, taking advantage of its Wide Guard support to set up Substitutes and remove threatening Grass-types. Dragon-types tend to perform fairly well against Swampert, so teammates to defeat them such as Sylveon and Mega Diancie can serve Swampert quite well. Ice-types are able to defeat Dragon- and Grass-types, so partners such as Weavile and Mega Abomasnow can operate well with Swampert as a partner. Generally speaking, Swampert's anti-meta coverage and defensive utility allow it to fit fairly well on any team, but there are few teams on which it would not be outclassed, so before adding Swampert, make certain that Gastrodon, Suicune, or other Wide Guard users such as Conkeldurr and Aegislash would not better serve the team.</p> "

  "Ludicolo": {
    "overview": "<p>While the loss of permanent rain was a negative, Ludicolo is still a potent rain attacker; its immunity to powder moves allows it to switch into Spore and ignore Rage Powder, meaning it can get around Amoonguss, a common check to rain teams. Fake Out is an excellent move that lets Ludicolo disrupt opposing strategies, and when rain is up, Ludicolo becomes the fastest Fake Out user in the metagame. However, it does have some problems of its own. For example, while its Water / Grass typing allows it to handle Pokemon such as Rotom-W that normally check rain sweepers, this typing also causes Ludicolo to miss out on some resistances that would've been useful, such as ones to Fire-, Ice-, and Electric-type attacks. In addition, although Ludicolo isn't frail, it's not especially bulky either, so more powerful attacks from Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan can deal heavy damage to it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Moves such as Energy Ball or Grass Knot are alternative STAB options for Ludicolo due to their higher power than Giga Drain (although in the case of Grass Knot the power depends on the target). However, the healing from Giga Drain usually makes it a better move to use than Energy Ball, and it has a more reliable damage output than Grass Knot as well. Scald could be a replacement for Hydro Pump due to its 100% accuracy and 30% chance to burn the target, but a significantly lower damage output than Hydro Pump typically makes it the less desirable choice. Focus Blast allows Ludicolo to hit threats such as Kyurem-B and Ferrothorn that normally have very little to fear from Ludicolo, but its unreliable accuracy makes it difficult to justify over the moves in the main set. A set with Sitrus Berry could work as a bulky pivot, but loses out on Ludicolo's ability to be a threatening sweeper. Substitute is an interesting  option to shield Ludicolo from priority and status, but Ludicolo must then lose out on Assault Vest as well as a potential attacking move, making it hard to justify on a moveset. A set with Leech Seed and Rain Dish could be used, but it lacks much in the way of offensive presence and will usually be KOed by powerful attackers before it can hope to stall one out. Finally, Teeter Dance should not be used due to the fact that it's luck-based and hits Ludicolo's partner, making it an unreliable strategy.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Abomasnow is an excellent counter as it has no problem dealing with Politoed to set up hail, stripping Ludicolo of its preferred weather condition. In addition to this, Abomasnow can comfortably sponge all of Ludicolo's attacks and respond with a powerful attack of its own. Mega Charizard Y is a good check as Drought stops Swift Swim from working while simultaneously weakening one of Ludicolo's main STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Bulky attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan can tank a hit from Ludicolo and deal heavy damage back, making them good checks. Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Kyurem-B can easily take hits from it and wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame: Talonflame is an excellent check to Ludicolo as it has a priority Brave Bird to get around Ludicolo's Swift Swim and OHKO it. <strong>Paralysis and Trick Room</strong>: Thundurus is a good check as it can hit Ludicolo with a priority Thunder Wave, crippling it for the remainder of the match. Bulky Trick Room setters such as Cresselia can turn Ludicolo's high Speed under rain into a major liability, making them excellent checks to it.</p> ",

Fake Out can disrupt strategies by rendering an opposing Pokemon immobile for a turn, potentially allowing a partner to KO them. Hydro Pump is the main STAB attack and is great due to its neutral coverage, high power, and the fact that it gets a 50% boost from rain. Giga Drain is an accurate secondary STAB attack, hitting Water-types that resist Hydro Pump such as Rotom-W or Keldeo; the passive recovery it provides also helps improve Ludicolo's longevity. Ice Beam is a good coverage option to hit the Grass- and Dragon-types such as Amoonguss and Latios that can sponge Ludicolo's STAB attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread grants Ludicolo as much power as possible as well as the ability to outspeed everything up to Choice Scarf Landorus-T when under rain. Assault Vest boosts Ludicolo's special bulk, something that proves even more useful due to the fact that Ludicolo typically lacks room for Protect.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>A good idea is typically to bring in Ludicolo late-game once the opponent's team is weakened, where it can clean up with its Speed granted by Swift Swim and Water-type attacks. Also, if your opponent is carrying a Thunder Wave user such as Thundurus, play cautiously, as a paralyzed Ludicolo is infinitely less threatening than a healthy one. Fake Out is a great tool to use selectively to apply pressure on your opponent, force them into making certain plays, and create free turns for a partner, so make sure you use the move wisely. If you're not planning on using Ludicolo for a late-game sweep (or if you're sure you can keep it in good enough health to achieve said sweep), it makes for a great early-game pivot with its bulk (augmented by Assault Vest) and access to Fake Out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Politoed makes for an almost essential partner for Ludicolo, as the rain from Drizzle activates Ludicolo's Swift Swim ability and gives Hydro Pump a 50% power boost. Also, Politoed has Helping Hand to boost the power of attacks coming off of Ludicolo's middling base 90 Special Attack. Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Mega Diancie appreciate having Ludicolo as a partner due to its ability to handle Water-types such as Rotom-W that are problematic for them. Anything that appreciates the free turns bought by Fake Out, such as Substitute Metagross, could make for a good partner to Ludicolo. Pokemon such as Terrakion and Thundurus that threaten Talonflame are excellent partners as well, as Talonflame can get around Ludicolo's Swift Swim with Gale Wings and KO with a priority Brave Bird. Other good partners are Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Scrafty that can patch up Ludicolo's lower Defense stat.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Pump, when backed by the power boosts from a Life Orb and the rain, puts a large dent in anything that doesn't resist it. Giga Drain hits many common Pokemon that resist Water such as Rotom-W and Keldeo while also healing up any residual damage racked up from Life Orb recoil. Ice Beam provides good coverage against Dragon-types such as Latios and Hydreigon that would wall Ludicolo otherwise. Protect lets Ludicolo stall out field conditions, shield itself from damage, and give teammates room to work.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb increases Ludicolo's damage output to very respectable levels, making it a powerful special attacker when supported by the rain. Its Special Attack is maximized to hit as hard as possible, and the Speed investment allows it to Speed tie with Pokemon such as Adamant Bisharp and Adamant Breloom outside of the rain and outspeed the vast majority of the metagame while inside it. A Timid nature is unneeded to outspeed any additional threats, making Modest the superior choice to boost Ludicolo's offensive potential as much as possible. Swift Swim allows Ludicolo to take advantage of the rain by doubling its Speed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Ludicolo is best used while in the rain, so try to avoid sending it in unless the rain is up. Hydro Pump is Ludicolo's most powerful attack under the rain and should be used as much as possible. While Protect usually would not get a special mention, most opponents will assume Ludicolo is an Assault Vest variant if it has not taken Life Orb recoil and may be caught off guard by the usage of Protect. Similarly, opponents might play around a potential Fake Out if Ludicolo's set has not been revealed yet.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Politoed and Rain Dance users such as Thundurus are mandatory partners for this set, as they provide the rain it requires to function properly. Talonflame beats opposing Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Amoonguss that Ludicolo may have trouble breaking through, while Ludicolo beats one of its main checks, Mega Diancie. Pokemon that beat Flying-types like Talonflame such as Landorus-T, Terrakion, and Mega Diancie are great partners for Ludicolo, with a special mention to Mega Diancie because of its ability to get past Dragon-types that Ludicolo would have to rely on Ice Beam to damage heavily. Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Conkeldurr prey on the most common defensive checks to Ludicolo, Ferrothorn and Kyurem-B.</p> "

  "Breloom": {
    "overview": "<p>Breloom is the fastest Spore user in Doubles OU and can put slower foes to sleep before they can move, so it requires less speed control than other Spore users would. It is a powerful physical attacker that doesn't mind Landorus-T that much, as it takes negligible damage from most of Landorus-T's common moves, such as Earthquake and Rock Slide, and can put Landorus-T to sleep in return, although it does need to watch out for Landorus-T U-turning into a sleep absorber. Breloom also has a strong STAB- and Technician-boosted multi-hit move in Bullet Seed, which can break Focus Sash and deal significant damage to bulky Water-types, as well as access to a STAB- and Technician-boosted priority move in Mach Punch, which can be used to KO Kangaskhan. Its coverage allows it to hit a unique set of threats super effectively, notably most Water- and Steel-types, allowing it to check many bulky Pokemon in the tier. However, Breloom is very predictable: your opponent will almost always know its moveset and will therefore be able to play around it easily. Talonflame is very common in the metagame and OHKOes Breloom. Poor bulk makes it very hard to switch Breloom in safely. It also has a subpar Speed stat that is often used as a benchmark for faster Pokemon to hit.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Life Orb can be used to deal more damage, but Focus Sash is usually the best option because of Breloom's poor bulk. Rock Tomb can be used over one of its two attacks to OHKO Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame on the switch and offer strong coverage in general. Superpower can be used instead of Mach Punch for extra damage if your team has priority covered on several spots, but a priority move is usually better. Breloom can also pull off a decent Choice Scarf set, with Spore / Superpower / Rock Tomb / Bullet Seed as the moveset. However, without the Focus Sash, Breloom's low defenses are even more noticeable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: In addition to being immune to Spore, Grass-types such as Venusaur and Amoonguss also generally wall Breloom and can break its Focus Sash with ease.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Fire-types have the ability to hit Breloom super effectively with their STAB attacks, resist Bullet Seed, and frequently run Safety Goggles to prevent Spore. Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y are particularly notable due to their resistance to Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Any faster Pokemon that can significantly Breloom before it can move is a very good answer to Breloom. However, they need to get a free switch to avoid being hit with Spore. If both foes are faster, they can double target and KO Breloom.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: Reductions in offense are detrimental to Breloom's usefulness, as they lower Breloom's damage output. Burns also break Breloom's Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Safety Goggles and Overcoat</strong>:  Pokemon commonly holding Safety Goggles, such as Cresselia and Gyarados and those with Overcoat, such as Reuniclus, don't mind Breloom because they cannot be put to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Substitute: Taunt users, such as Thundurus and Gengar, are also good for stopping Spore. Damaging weather breaks Breloom's Focus Sash. Substitute users can block Spore and can attack while Breloom or its partner tries to break the Substitute.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Spore puts one opposing Pokemon to sleep for several turns unless it is a Grass-type, has Insomnia, Vital Spirit, or Overcoat, or is holding Safety Goggles. It is also useful against Trick Room teams because Trick Room has negative priority and most setters don't have any item or ability that prevents sleep. Of course, there are exceptions to this, such as Safety Goggles Cresselia and Overcoat Reuniclus. Bullet Seed is a powerful STAB- and Technician-boosted move that allows Breloom to OHKO some Focus Sash users such as Terrakion. However, the multi-hit nature of this move activates Sitrus Berry between hits, turning many potential 2HKOs and 3HKOs into 3HKOs and 4HKOs. Mach Punch hits Steel-types super effectively and deals heavy damage to many prominent Pokemon, most notably Mega Kangaskhan. It also has priority to alleviate Breloom's middling Speed. Protect scouts for attacks and stalls out field conditions. It also blocks Fake Out, which would break Breloom's Focus Sash.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs allow Breloom to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible without any speed control, while 252 Attack EVs allow it to hit as hard as possible. A Jolly nature is optimal to outpace Bisharp, which nearly always runs an Adamant nature. As Breloom is frail, Focus Sash allows it to survive one powerful attack early-game so that it can cripple the foe with Spore. An Adamant nature is an option for a higher damage output, but then Breloom sits at an extremely common Speed benchmark to beat.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Breloom forces two-on-one situations with Spore. Take advantage of these, and don't immediately eliminate the sleeping foes because they take up space on the field while they do nothing, which can give your team free turns. Don't be afraid to let Breloom be taken down to its Focus Sash and put a major threat to sleep with Spore. Breloom is a good lead because it has access to Spore and isn't too bothered by Intimidate. It can weaken slower leads and even beat faster ones with the right partners. However, be wary of clicking Spore mindlessly, as there is a moderate number of Pokemon immune to Spore as well as faster Pokemon with Substitute. Breloom should hardly ever be switched in directly, as it is quite frail, and even if its Focus Sash is intact, it usually isn't worth breaking it to switch in. Despite having access to Mach Punch, Breloom isn't that fast, so opposing priority users will usually attack first. Use Protect to scout attacks, stall out field conditions, and allow its teammate to KO a faster threat.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Speed control such as Tailwind from the likes of Suicune, Togekiss, and Talonflame and Icy Wind from Cresselia helps Breloom move first to use Spore against a greater number of opposing Pokemon. Talonflame gets a special mention because of its Flying-type coverage that allows it to beat Grass-types that generally wall Breloom. Redirection support is also very helpful: in particular, Togekiss can use Follow Me in addition to Tailwind. Despite having access to Rage Powder, Amoonguss isn't a good option because it shares common checks with Breloom, which is bad for team synergy. Setup sweepers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Azumarill, and Calm Mind Cresselia enjoy being able to use sleeping foes as setup bait. Breloom appreciates Pokemon that can switch in and take hits for it, such as Heatran and Rotom-W, which can force Talonflame out. Mega Kangaskhan is a particularly great teammate because of its access to Fake Out, which allows Breloom to safely use Spore, while Kangaskhan appreciates free turns to use Power-Up Punch. Suicune also gets a special mention because it beats Fire-types and Landorus-T in addition to having access to Tailwind.</p> "

  "Hariyama": {
    "overview": "<p>Hariyama faces huge competition as a supportive Trick Room Pokemon from Hitmontop and Scrafty, and as an offensive Trick Room Pokemon from Conkeldurr. Hariyama can perform both roles while only taking up one slot on the team, though the fact that it isn't solely dedicated to one of these roles may compromise its effectiveness. A great Attack stat means Hariyama can hit most threats very hard, especially after Flame Orb has been activated. A diverse movepool allows Hariyama to hit multiple threats and fulfill many roles on a Trick Room team. However, Hariyama's longevity is greatly shortened by Flame Orb and its lack of reliable healing options, as well as its underwhelming defenses. In addition, Hariyama's low Speed stat is a huge liability outside of Trick Room, and Hariyama is also one of the slowest Fake Out users.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Due to Hariyama's underwhelming Speed and poor defenses, Hariyama sadly has little use outside of Trick Room. However, there are some different sets Hariyama can run. A set utilizing Life Orb and Sheer Force can be used to boost the power of elemental punches and Rock Slide. However, take caution that Fake Out will not work on such sets. Hariyama can also use a set with Assault Vest, which can be used in conjunction with Thick Fat to make Hariyama a decent specially defensive tank. Heavy Slam can be used if the team struggles against Fairy-types, as it hits Fairies aside from Mawile, Klefki, and Azumarill extremely hard. Hariyama can use Helping Hand to boost the power of a teammate's attack. Feint can be used, but a set with Feint would be almost completely outclassed by Hitmontop; Hariyama needs to focus on hitting like a truck instead, and therefore prioritizing powerful moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon: Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Latios can easily take a Close Combat and hit back with a super effective STAB move. They have to watch out for Knock Off, however.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Azumarill, Mega Mawile, Sylveon, and Mega Gardevoir are all huge threats, and can easily OHKO Hariyama with their Fairy-type STAB moves, especially if Trick Room is not active.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame: Talonflame can easily OHKO Hariyama with its priority STAB Brave Bird; Hariyama can, however, OHKO a predicted switch-in with Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Hariyama doesn't like Intimidate, as Intimidate greatly reduces its offensive presence, typically forcing a switch. Gyarados, Hitmontop, and Landorus-T are all notable users of Intimidate. Landorus-T has to watch out for Ice Punch, however.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Offensive Trick Room",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out and Protect are both good options to activate Flame Orb in conjunction with their additional utility. Fake Out helps teammates set up Trick Room more easily, and Protect keeps Hariyama alive longer while its teammate sets up Trick Room. Close Combat hits like a truck after Hariyama is burned, heavily damaging or OHKOing Pokemon that don't resist it. Knock Off is a great and powerful Dark-type move; it hits Ghost-types, which are immune to Close Combat, as well as Psychic-types for super effective damage. Access to both Close Combat and Knock Off is Hariyama's biggest niche over Hitmontop and Scrafty. Wide Guard can be used in a similar capacity, negating spread attacks such as Heat Wave, Rock Slide, and Earthquake. Ice Punch allows Hariyama to deal with threats such as Landorus-T, as well as Amoonguss, who loves to mess with Trick Room using its low Speed. Rock Slide can be used if additional coverage is wanted, as it takes care of Pokemon Hariyama otherwise barely could touch, such as Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread is used to maximize Hariyama's attacking power, with the remaining EVs put in Defense and Special Defense to improve Hariyama's general bulk. Flame Orb is used to boost Hariyama's Attack stat by 50% thanks to Guts, while also letting it avoid status ailments such as sleep and paralysis. Hariyama can also use a Sitrus Berry and Guts to absorb Scald and Will-O-Wisp. Flame Orb is used over Toxic Orb as Trick Room attackers can't afford to switch in and out to reduce Toxic's damage; therefore Flame Orb does, in the end, less damage. Thick Fat and Sitrus Berry, together with Rock Slide, can be used to make Hariyama a cool check to Fire-types. 0 Speed IVs and a Brave nature are used to lower Hariyama's Speed as much as possible, allowing Hariyama to outspeed neutral base 30 and faster Pokemon in Trick Room. An Adamant nature and 31 Speed IVs can be used when not using Trick Room, although this results in this set being inferior to Hitmontop.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Trick Room is essential for this set to work properly, as Hariyama's lacking Speed and underwhelming bulk results in faster Pokemon KOing Hariyama before it can attack without Trick Room. Using Fake Out, Hariyama can be easily paired with a Trick Room setter, allowing Trick Room to be set up multiple times throughout the match. Once Trick Room is up, Hariyama becomes a Pokemon that can break down many checks and counters to the team, hitting hard with its STAB and coverage moves. Because of the limited turns of Trick Room and Hariyama's limited longevity because of Flame Orb, Hariyama must be wary of Protect. However, Protect can also be used to Hariyama's advantage, allowing it to freely switch out and bring in a Trick Room setter to come in and set it up again. Hariyama can also predict the Protect, attacking the other Pokemon and leaving the opponent at a disadvantage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Trick Room setters are mandatory. Cresselia is one of the best Trick Room setters in Doubles, and is therefore a great teammate for Hariyama. Jellicent and Chandelure are also great partners, both being able to reliably set up Trick Room with Fake Out support. Something to deal with Talonflame is also strongly appreciated. Heatran is therefore a great teammate, as it resists Brave Bird while also being immune to Flare Blitz. Heatran also beats Amoonguss, who can be really annoying for Hariyama. Mega Ampharos can also be used to stop Talonflame. Bulky and powerful Pokemon such as Mega Abomasnow can help clean up once Hariyama is done blowing holes in the opponent's team. Talonflame also gets a mention as a partner due to its ability to attack first with its Flying-type STAB despite Trick Room, and deal with Amoonguss, which can take Close Combats easily and is also a problem during Trick Room due to its low Speed. Bisharp is another good teammate as its Defiant ability deters Intimidate users from switching in and destroys Psychic-, Ghost-, and Fairy-types, such as Latios, Cresselia, Gengar, Sylveon, and Gardevoir.</p> "

  "Sableye": {
    "overview": "<p>Sableye is a great stop to physical attackers in general, particularly Mega Kangaskhan, as it can burn them using Prankster Will-O-Wisp before they can attack. Prankster Quash gives Sableye the ability to disrupt speedy attackers by allowing its partner to get an attack in before the foe can strike. It fits well on teams with a weakness to physical attackers or teams that aren't quite fast enough and need some support. While it carries Taunt, its main role is not to prevent Trick Room or Tailwind being set up; if this is your aim, Thundurus is a better choice. Its niche over Thundurus is that it fits better on teams with a weakness to physical attackers. Faster Prankster Taunt users threaten Sableye, as it is naturally slower than them. Your team must be able to capitalize on the support Sableye provides, as Sableye has next to no offensive presence. If the opponent is not troubled by Quash or Will-O-Wisp, Sableye becomes dead weight quickly. Its average bulk is quite a drawback. Quash is great against teams with Trick Room or Tailwind, as it nullifies the opponent's Speed advantage and wastes a turn of their field condition.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sableye gets Helping Hand, but it is not an ideal choice and is used better by another Pokemon. Sableye can use Lagging Tail with Trick, as due to Prankster Sableye is seldom affected by Lagging Tail's effect of making the user move last in its priority bracket. Iron Ball can also be used with Trick to remove a foe's Ground-type immunity and halve their speed, which works well with Ground-type teammates such as Landorus-T and Rhyperior. Mental Herb can protect Sableye from opposing Taunts from faster Pokemon such as Thundurus and Whimsicott, allowing Sableye to Taunt them in return. Knock Off lets Sableye remove troublesome items like Sitrus Berry and Leftovers, as well as preventing Sableye from being completely shut down by Taunt. Snarl lowers both foes' Special Attack by one stage, which is effective when combined with the burns from Will-O-Wisp. Mega Sableye is generally not a very good use of your Mega Evolution, as its proficiency at stallbreaking doesn't really apply to Doubles, where stall teams do not exist, and Cresselia is a better Calm Mind user.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon can easily OHKO Sableye with Hyper Voice. Mega Diancie can OHKO Sableye with Moonblast and has Magic Bounce, so it can't be threatened by Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Fire-types such as Infernape and Blaziken also can't be burnt, and as a result, all Sableye can do if it isn't carrying Foul Play is use Quash in the hope that a partner can deal with them. Talonflame can't be burned and can ignore Quash with faster priority.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Sableye isn't particularly bulky, so neutral attacks do take their toll without recovery. Any special attacker that can 2HKO Sableye is a check to it. Sableye can't do anything meaningful to them unless they are weak to Foul Play, and it can't Recover stall against them. Some, like Hydreigon and Latios, can OHKO Sableye, in these cases with Draco Meteor. Slower special attackers such as Rotom-W and Aegislash do not mind Quash; however, Aegislash must watch out for Foul Play. Heatran in particular is troublesome as it can't even be burned for chip damage and it threatens to switch in for a threatened physical attacker partner and gain a Flash Fire boost.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore: Although Sableye's purpose is to disrupt opponents, it can be disrupted quite easily itself. Other Prankster Taunt users such as Thundurus are faster than Sableye, and it is very vulnerable to this. Also, Sableye might be surprised by a Taunt user like Keldeo or Talonflame. Whimsicott can also Encore Sableye into an unfavorable move.</p> <p><strong>Quick Guard: Talonflame and Keldeo can use Quick Guard to block priority moves from Sableye.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Prankster",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Will-O-Wisp allows Sableye to threaten almost all of the physical attackers in the tier, as if they don't switch out they risk being burnt, as well as to wear things down with residual damage. Prankster Quash ignores Tailwind, Trick Room and faster Pokemon, allowing Sableye's partner to move before a threat and take it out. Feint can break Protect and Quick / Wide Guard for a turn, ensuring a KO on something trying to defend, and Taunt lets you prevent status to Sableye and its partners and also stops foes from using Protect. Fake Out can disrupt opposing leads and buy a turn for your Pokemon. Sableye is immune to Fake Out, as well as having the move itself, so it's almost guaranteed that it'll be able to cause an opposing Pokemon to flinch. Protect lets Sableye protect itself from an incoming attack or Taunt while the threat is removed by a partner, whereas Foul Play gives Sableye some damage output without investing in Attack. Recover gives reliable healing and is great for stalling burnt physical attackers. Detect can be used over Protect if you fear Imprison, but Imprison is very rare.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs are used to aid Sableye's fairly poor bulk. 184 Special Defense EVs allow Sableye to live Mega Charizard Y's sun-boosted Heat Wave, as well as Ludicolo's rain-boosted Hydro Pump. The remaining 72 EVs are put into Defense, and with an Impish nature so Sableye can live Bisharp's Life Orb-boosted Knock Off with a little room to spare. Sitrus Berry is used normally to improve Sableye's longevity, but Leftovers can be used alongside Protect for a more gradual form of healing. An alternate spread of 252 HP / 68 Def / 188 SpD with a Careful nature can be used if you want Sableye to take hits from special attackers better, as, when faced with Sableye, physical attackers will usually Protect while their specially attacking partner deals with Sableye. The 68 Defense EVs are used to live Adamant Bisharp's Life Orb-boosted Knock Off in case Will-O-Wisp misses. If using Foul Play, you can drop Sableye's Speed IVs to 0 and use a Relaxed or Sassy nature so that Sableye can OHKO Aegislash with Foul Play by moving after it changes to Blade forme. Sableye will typically be moving with priority anyway, so the decrease in speed is not harmful, except against other Sableye with Taunt.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Sableye has a good match-up against almost every physical attacker in the tier, as they won't want to risk the burn and will either Protect or switch out most of the time. Sableye's role is to disrupt the opponent as much as it can while its teammates take advantage of this and deal damage. Quash can be very effective, as it effectively nullifies all forms of speed control, allowing your Pokemon to use a move that it wouldn't have been be able to otherwise. It also helps while Trick Room is up; for example, Quashing an Amoonguss under Trick Room and Substituting with Sableye's partner to avoid a Spore. Leading with Sableye can be very disruptive to your opponent; however, Sableye can also switch in and support its teammates late-game, thanks to its three immunities.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon whose special bulk is acceptable but whose physical bulk is lacking appreciate the burn support Sableye provides; such Pokemon include Sylveon, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Charizard Y. Slow and powerful attackers that resist Fairy, such as Heatran and Aegislash, are good partners because they can sponge Fairy-type attacks aimed at Sableye and take advantage of the Quash and burn support that Sableye provides. Sableye is threatened by Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran, as it can't burn them, so partners like Heatran and Keldeo fit well to switch into these attacks. Partners like Mega Charizard Y and Mega Abomasnow benefit from Quash, as it can allow Mega Charizard Y to use Overheat on Choice Scarf Landorus-T before being hit by its Rock Slide. Mega Abomasnow is slow, so it can be protected by Quash while it uses Blizzard, but be careful, as using Mega Abomasnow stacks a weakness to Fire-types. Mega Kangaskhan is a good partner, as Sableye can burn the Fighting-types that threaten it, as well as switch into Fighting attacks, use Quash to let Mega Kangaskhan KO a faster threat, and burn a foe, weakening its physical power and allowing Mega Kangaskhan to set up with Power-Up Punch more easily.</p> "

  "Mawile": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting base 105 Attack and Huge Power, Mega Mawile reaches the highest unboosted Attack in the game. Its great typing gives it two immunities and only two weaknesses, although its weaknesses are to two of the most common offensive types, Fire and Ground. Intimidate as a base ability is very useful in bolstering Mega Mawile's large base 125 Defense; however, its base forme's stats are quite poor, so switching it in safely is difficult. Its STAB moves have good neutral coverage but leave it walled by Fire- and Steel-types, such as Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and Aegislash. Mega Mawile works great against the strong Ghost- and Dark-types that typically threaten Trick Room teams, not only because it's slow but also because Play Rough and Sucker Punch will usually either KO them or scare them out. Its low Speed stat is also a problem, making it rely heavily on speed control, but Sucker Punch allows it to bypass this problem somewhat. While Mawile faces competition as a Trick Room Mega Pokemon from Mega Abomasnow and Mega Camerupt, it is the best choice for defeating Hoopa-U, as it can use Intimidate to weaken it or just KO it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Knock Off is an option for Dark-type coverage that doesn't require the enemy to attack and can stop Substitute Heatran from setting up. It also hits Jirachi and Cresselia very hard, as well as being able to reliably damage Aegislash as long as Mawile doesn't hit King's Shield. Rock Slide can be used to hit Fire-types super effectively, while Ice Punch can be used to hit Ground- and Flying-types. Hyper Cutter can be used if you really fear Intimidate before Mawile Mega Evolves. Brick Break has a small chance to OHKO 24 HP Heatran, but this isn't really worth the risk, and it doesn't hit much else for decent damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Mawile struggles against Fire-types, as its only way to hit them for neutral damage is with Sucker Punch, which won't OHKO Mega Charizard Y or Heatran, both of which can OHKO back with Heat Wave. Rotom-H can do the same with Overheat but can also burn Mawile, severely reducing its attack power. Talonflame can OHKO with Flare Blitz. Mega Camerupt also underspeeds Mega Mawile in Trick Room and can OHKO it with both STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types such as Aegislash and Ferrothorn can hit Mawile for neutral damage with their Steel-type STAB moves, and their resistances to both Play Rough and Iron Head make it easy for them to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-types such as Mega Swampert and Landorus-T can outspeed Mawile and hit it hard with a STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Intimidate is an issue for Mawile, as its main selling point is its destructive power. Landorus-T is the main offender, due to its powerful STAB Earthquake. Mawile does not want to be burned, as it loses half its power and is left open to attacks. Burns coming from bulky support Pokemon like Rotom-W and Rotom-H and fast users like Gengar threaten Mawile out.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Play Rough does great damage coming off Mawile's sky-high Attack stat, being able to OHKO Dragon-types like Latios and Hydreigon, Dark-types like Hoopa-U, and Fighting-types like Keldeo and Conkeldurr. Iron Head is slightly less powerful but has a 30% flinch chance and is 100% accurate. The accuracy can be important; if a foe is within KO range, Iron Head is the best option, as it won't miss. Iron Head hits Rock-types like Terrakion, Ice-types like Abomasnow, and Fairy-types such as Sylveon super effectively. Running Swords Dance forces Mawile to forgo Iron Head, but Play Rough OHKOes Mega Gardevoir and has a chance of OHKOing Sylveon anyway, depending on its spread. After a Swords Dance, Mawile becomes incredibly powerful, OHKOing almost anything that doesn't resist Play Rough, as well as OHKOing foes that would normally scare it out, such as Heatran and Mega Charizard Y, with Sucker Punch. Although running Substitute over Iron Head means Mawile can't hit Poison-types such as Amoonguss well, Mawile becomes very dangerous behind a Substitute as it avoids status moves and Intimidate. Sucker Punch lets Mawile somewhat bypass its low Speed stat, and if Trick Room is up, it can be used to move before opposing fast priority attacks such as Talonflame's Brave Bird. It also hits Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively, but you should beware of situations like Gengar using Will-O-Wisp and Aegislash using Substitute to avoid the Sucker Punch. Protect allows Mawile to stay safe while its partner sets up Trick Room or to eliminate a threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Running 252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature maximizes Mawile's Attack, while full HP investment somewhat aids Mawile's low base HP. If you run Swords Dance, an alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 180 Atk / 40 Def / 36 SpD should be used, as it allows Mawile to survive either a -1 Choice Band Talonflame's Flare Blitz or a 252+ Heatran's Heat Wave. If you're using Mawile on a Trick Room team, a Brave nature with a 0 Speed IV should be used for minimum Speed. If being used with Tailwind support, a set 164 Speed EVs is a decent alternative that guarantees Mawile can move before base 111s and below, such as Thundurus and Latios.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Sometimes it is best to hold off on Mega Evolving so that Mawile keeps Intimidate, which can be useful late-game. Mawile should not attempt to attack while in its base forme, as it is far weaker without Huge Power. Mawile works as a good stop to Mega Kangaskhan, as Intimidate combined with its high Defense and resistances to Normal- and Dark-type moves makes it hard for Mega Kangaskhan to do much damage. Dealing with opposing Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp users before bringing Mawile out is important if not using Substitute, as the attack drops will severely cripple it, making it harder for it to do its job. Mawile is also effective late-game once the opposing team has been softened up, because its Sucker Punch is able to pick off weakened targets quite easily. This is especially true for Swords Dance Mega Mawile, because at +2 its Sucker Punch OHKOes conventional checks like Mega Charizard-Y, Landorus-T, and non-Substitute Heatran. Mega Mawile is heavily dependent on speed control due to its low Speed, so Trick Room or Tailwind is required when using it. Alternatively, redirection can help Mawile, but it still has a vulnerability to spread moves like Earthquake and Heat Wave.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Trick Room setters are nice as a form of speed control. Cresselia is the best Trick Room setting parter for Mawile, as it really likes Dark-types being removed and is bulky enough to set Trick Room multiple times throughout the match. Hoopa-U is a great partner, as it can defeat Steel-types for Mawile. Alternatively, Tailwind users can help with Mawile's low Speed. Suicune resists Fire-type attacks and can threaten foes such as Heatran. Latios can switch into both Ground- and Fire-type attacks, set Tailwind, and maintain offensive pressure.</p> <p>Gyarados can switch into both of Mawile's weaknesses and can hit both Fire- and Ground-types super effectively. Politoed makes for an interesting partner, as it weakens the Fire-type attacks that Mawile is weak to and can beat or scare out Mega Charizard Y. Jellicent can beat Fire-types for Mawile, as well as set up Trick Room. Rotom-W has good synergy with Mawile, as it resists Fire-type attacks, is immune to Ground, and can beat foes of these types. Its Will-O-Wisp support is great, as burning opposing physical attackers makes it incredibly hard for them to damage Mawile. Fake Out users fit well on teams with Mawile, buying free turns to set up Trick Room, Substitute, or Swords Dance. Scrafty can provide Fake Out support and Intimidate, and Hariyama can use Fake Out and Wide Guard to protect Mawile from Earthquakes and Heat Waves.</p> "

Its lack of bulk and notable resistances leave it unable to safely switch into attacks and make it prone to getting significantly damaged by any strong blow; if opposing speed control is up, Mega Manectric simply becomes a liability. Its access to Intimidate is quite nifty, however, giving it a way to support its teammates by weakening opposing physical attacks, and its combination of high Speed and super effective coverage makes it decent for late-game clean-up situations. Being an Electric-type is also a boon for a fast attacker, as this means Mega Manectric can't be paralyzed. Despite that, however, Mega Manectric isn't a recommended pick due to costing a Mega Evolution when it's mostly subpar; a different Mega Evolution such as Mega Kangaskhan or Mega Diancie would often yield better results.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Volt Switch can be useful in order to keep Mega Manectric safe while it's picking off threats, but using it means losing a reliable STAB move, a valuable coverage move, or a necessity in Protect. Flamethrower is a weaker alternative over Overheat that doesn't have the Special Attack drop. Snarl can be nifty to support teammates against special attacking foes, but this kind of role would be better done by Raikou, which is bulkier and doesn't cost a Mega slot for a supporting role.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Choice Scarf Landorus-T, a very common threat in the metagame, can both outrun Mega Manectric and OHKO it with Earthquake. Gastrodon and Mega Swampert can take any attack and KO with their respective Ground-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Any strong attacker that can take a blow from Mega Manectric, such as Mega Kangaskhan or Kyurem-B, can hit back for good damage at its paper-thin bulk.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind and Trick Room: Mega Manectric needs the Speed advantage in order to be effective, as it can easily be picked off without it. Tailwind, from the likes of Talonflame and Zapdos, and Trick Room, from threats such as Cresselia and Hoopa-U, are ones to watch out for.</p> <p><strong>Defiant: Bisharp can simply take advantage of Mega Manectric's Intimidate with a boost to its Attack.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is simply Mega Manectric's reliable STAB move. Overheat lets Mega Manectric get quick major damage on Steel- and Grass-types such as Jirachi, Aegislash, and Amoonguss and lets it get the OHKO on Ferrothorn. Hidden Power Ice lets Mega Manectric cover Dragon- and Ground-types such as Hydreigon, Latios, and Landorus-T. Protect shields Mega Manectric from attacks, letting it safely Mega Evolve, stall out field conditions such as Trick Room, and position as needed.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment and a Timid nature are used in order to maximize Mega Manectric's offensive potential and let it outrun Mega Gengar. Lightning Rod is the selected ability in order to let Manectric provide some utility and possibly nab a Special Attack boost pre-Mega.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Manectric should mostly be used as a last-hitter of foes that are in KO range, as, while it is fast, it is also quite frail. Thanks to its Speed and wide coverage, Mega Manectric does well as a cleaner late-game when most foes are already weakened. It can also provide support by threatening KOs on numerous faster foes that ordinarily would be threats to its teammates; an example is it threatening a Keldeo that's pressuring a Heatran partner. While it does have Intimidate to support teammates with, it should be utilized carefully, as Mega Manectric can't take many hits due to its frailty. It can also use its Lightning Rod ability pre-Mega in order to protect teammates from Electric-type attacks and nab a boost; still, it should Mega Evolve as soon as possible because its base 105 Speed leaves it threatened by a good number of foes.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Teammates that can effectively deal with Landorus-T are strongly recommended; Kyurem-B and Water-types such as Keldeo and Rotom-W can all KO it with their respective STAB moves. Spread attackers are also good teammates because they can efficiently weaken an opposing team enough for Mega Manectric to be able to KO effectively; Volcanion and Heatran can do good damage with Heat Wave, Sylveon can hit hard with Hyper Voice, and Terrakion can effectively spread damage around with Rock Slide. Landorus-T can also work, but using both can bring the team a deadly weakness to Bisharp, which can take advantage of the duo's Intimidates. Talonflame is also an effective partner, as they can effectively form a one-two punch that can finish off foes with ease with their high Speed and power.</p> "

It does well against common threats to Trick Room teams, such as Amoonguss and certain Steel-types including Bisharp, Aegislash, and Escavalier, thanks to its typing and ability, which let it severely damage or OHKO them with Heat Wave and/or Fire Blast. Mega Camerupt also has good offensive coverage with its STAB moves, with Heat Wave hitting the Bug- and Grass-types that resist Earth Power and Earth Power hitting the Rock- and Fire-types that resist Heat Wave. However, Mega Camerupt is weak to Ground- and Water-type attacks, two common types in Doubles OU, which also gives Mega Camerupt a bad matchup against rain. Mega Camerupt, straight up, can't touch Water-types. In the end, Mega Camerupt is a decent pick for a Mega Evolution Trick Room sweeper, but it should only be used in Trick Room.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute can be used, as it protects Mega Camerupt from status such as Amoonguss's Spore; it also lets Mega Camerupt take advantage of switches and Protects from the foe. Rock Slide can be used for a spread attack that hits Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Talonflame. Eruption can be used, but its power gets reduced over time, is less reliable, and isn't boosted by Sheer Force. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple physical attackers.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Water-type Pokemon, such as Rotom-W, Gyarados, Suicune, and Mega Swampert, threaten Mega Camerupt with a STAB attack and can easily switch into a Heat Wave.

Earth Power is a secondary STAB attack that hits Rock- and Fire-types for super effective damage, providing great coverage alongside Heat Wave; thanks to Sheer Force, it will always OHKO Shuca Berry Heatran. The third slot is your choice; Fire Blast is an insanely powerful non-spread Fire-type STAB attack commonly used to allow Mega Camerupt to get around Wide Guard users. It OHKOes Landorus-T and hits Pokemon like Latios for only a little less damage than Hidden Power Ice, which hits Dragon-types such as Latios and Hydreigon, while Ancient Power hits Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Talonflame.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs coupled with a Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs makes Mega Camerupt as powerful and as slow as possible. 248 HP EVs increase Mega Camerupt's overall bulk and minimize residual damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Most of the time, Mega Camerupt should be spamming Heat Wave. Use Protect as Camerupt Mega Evolves and as a teammate sets up Trick Room. However, if it is already up, Mega Camerupt doesn't need to use Protect, as normal Camerupt is still pretty slow. Mega Camerupt shouldn't always have to use Protect, however, because if it can safely attack the opponent's Pokemon it will be fine. Mega Camerupt should mostly be used under Trick Room, as its bulk is very valuable, so you shouldn't have it take hits unless you need it to. Use moves appropriately; despite the type advantage, a neutral Fire Blast or Earth Power will do more damage than a 2x super effective Hidden Power Ice or Ancient Power, a 2x resisted Fire Blast or Earth Power will do more damage than a neutral Hidden Power Ice or Ancient Power, etc.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Trick Room users such as Cresselia, Jellicent, and Gothitelle set up Trick Room for Mega Camerupt. Jellicent works especially well, as it can switch into Water-type attacks thanks to Water Absorb, and Mega Camerupt checks Grass-types that threaten Jellicent, while Cresselia can utilize Sunny Day to boost the power of Mega Camerupt's Fire-type attacks. Amoonguss provides Rage Powder support, helping Mega Camerupt avoid Water-type attacks, and also functions well in Trick Room. Amoonguss, however, doesn't like getting burned by Scald, which is often targeted at Mega Camerupt. Helping Hand users such as Cresselia let Mega Camerupt dish out immense damage. Choice Specs Sylveon exerts tons of offensive pressure on the opponent in combination with Mega Camerupt, as Mega Camerupt threatens the Steel- and Poison-types that resist Sylveon's Hyper Voice, with its STAB moves.</p> "

Further aided by its access to Recover granting it the ability to stay on the field for longer than most Pokemon, Milotic can be a good niche pick in the Doubles OU metagame.</p> <p>However, Milotic's poor offensive movepool and resulting lack of coverage leave it walled by common Grass- and Water-types such as Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Because Milotic needs to heavily invest in its Special Attack and defenses in order to be effective, its base 81 Speed can severely hold it back. Finally, without a boost from Competitive, Milotic lacks the offensive presence found in other Water-types such as Keldeo.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Milotic can run Toxic to beat bulky Pokemon it would otherwise have trouble damaging, such as Suicune and Cresselia. Hidden Power Electric is another coverage option for that can be run on the offensive set with no extra investment or on the defensive set with 136 Special Attack EVs to always OHKO 252 HP Gyarados with a Competitive boost. However, this causes Milotic to miss out on using a generally much better move, such as Ice Beam or Recover. Mirror Coat can help patch up Milotic's sparse coverage options and makes use of its naturally high Special Defense, allowing it to take a foe's special attack and return it at the attacker for double the damage, but again, Milotic misses out on running a more reliable move. Milotic can run Choice Scarf to catch opponents by surprise. This set would be best run with a moveset of Scald / Hydro Pump / Ice Beam / Icy Wind and an EV spread of 96 HP / 252 SpA / 160 Spe with a Modest nature, which would allow Milotic to outspeed Mega Lucario while maximizing its damage output and bolstering its bulk. However, using Choice Scarf locks Milotic into one move and forces it to miss out on utility options like Recover and Protect. Another item option for Milotic is Rocky Helmet, allowing it to punish physical attackers. Milotic can also hold a Maranga Berry in order to gain a +1 Special Defense boost when it is hit by a special attack, allowing it to take hits from and stall out even the strongest special attackers in the Doubles OU metagame. However, these two items lack the overall reliability and utility of the ones listed in the main sets, as the former can sometimes activate only a few times in a game, while the latter may not activate at all.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Thundurus can hit it with Thunderbolt or Taunt and is bulky enough to take an unboosted Ice Beam. Rotom-W resists Milotic's whole moveset and can deal significant damage with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Certain Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Ludicolo, and Mega Venusaur take neutral damage from Ice Beam and can KO Milotic with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Water types such as Rotom-W and Keldeo totally wall Milotic and can do big damage to it in return.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-B: Kyurem-B is another special case, as with its good defensive typing and bulk, it can handle any of Milotic's attacks with ease, and Milotic is generally going to be Substitute bait for Kyurem-B unless it has a Competitive boost.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: With its unremarkable base 81 Speed, Milotic is outsped by most of the top Pokemon in the Doubles OU metagame, and Pokemon with a lower base Speed can invest enough Speed EVs to outspeed it. There also isn't much room for investment without giving up some much-needed bulk. Notably, many common Electric- and Grass-types will be faster than Milotic, namely Serperior, Choice Scarf Rotom formes, Thundurus, and Ludicolo.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Sun halves the damage of Milotic's STAB attacks and activates Chlorophyll for Venusaur to take it out. The lingering effects of sun and the fact that Mega Charizard Y and Venusaur can both deal with an unboosted Milotic fairly easily mean that Milotic can be dead weight in many matchups against sun teams.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is Milotic's most reliable STAB move, as it has 100% accuracy, decent power, and a 30% chance to burn the target. Icy Wind provides speed control and can also do good spread damage when Milotic has a Competitive boost. Alternatively, Ice Beam enables Milotic to hit Flying- and Grass-types such as Thundurus and Amoonguss for much greater super effective damage. Icy Wind should be used on teams that require the speed control granted by the move, but Ice Beam is a stronger option on teams that already have speed control options in place. Recover gives Milotic reliable recovery, allowing it to stick around longer and continue to check Intimidate users and provide speed control. Protect allows Milotic to scout for moves, stall out opposing speed control, and avoid taking damage while its partner handles a threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Special Attack EVs allow Milotic to 2HKO Mega Kangaskhan with Scald at +2 and OHKO Landorus-T with Ice Beam when unboosted. The Speed EVs let Milotic outspeed uninvested Rotom formes. Milotic's HP is maximized and the remaining EVs are put into Defense to maximize its bulk. Sitrus Berry provides instant recovery, which is especially handy against Mega Kangaskhan due to the possibility of Parental Bond activating it between hits. Leftovers is an alternative that gives Milotic permanent passive recovery, which can help later in the game as Milotic attempts to stall out opposing Pokemon. Another option is Safety Goggles, which grants Milotic an immunity to Spore and lets it ignore redirection from Rage Powder, allowing Milotic to improve its matchup against Grass-types by avoiding sleep and attacking its intended target.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switching Milotic in when you think the opponent's Intimidate user is going to come in is a good way to get a Competitive boost. Milotic can also switch in on an Icy Wind or Snarl and gain a Competitive boost that way. A +2 Special Attack boost can turn Milotic into a very capable offensive threat that the opponent has to deal with immediately, which can provide an incredible momentum swing in any game. Milotic's bulk, access to recovery, and ability to burn foes with Scald are all very valuable for the mid- and late-game. Milotic can stall out foes with Recover and Scald, allowing you to win games even when you are down or when Milotic isn't in a particularly favorable matchup. The speed control granted by Icy Wind will prove to be consistently valuable as the game goes on into the mid- and late-game, so it is smart to not let Milotic get KOed in the early-game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Physical attackers such as Landorus-T and Mega Kangaskhan benefit from Milotic's deterrence of Intimidate users. Strong attackers with average Speed such as Mega Gardevoir and Hoopa-U benefit from the speed control provided by Milotic's Icy Wind. Milotic will also need teammates like Talonflame and Breloom that can defeat the Pokemon that can do big damage to it while taking very little damage from its attacks, such as Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. In return, these two appreciate Milotic's ability to discourage Intimidate users from switching in.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is Milotic's best STAB move, letting it do serious damage to most Rock-, Ground-, and Fire-types, such as Mega Diancie, Landorus-T, and Heatran, as well as good damage to neutral targets. Ice Beam allows Milotic to hit Flying- and Grass-types such as Thundurus and Amoonguss super effectively. Recover allows Milotic to have a reliable way to recover its health, a trait missed out on by many other Water-types, notably Suicune and Keldeo. Protect allows Milotic to scout for moves, stall out opposing speed control, and avoid taking damage while its partner handles a threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Competitive sharply boosts Milotic's Special Attack every time one of its stats is lowered, allowing it to take advantage of certain abilities and moves such as Intimidate and Snarl. Life Orb increases Milotic's damage output, giving it some much-needed extra power. The Special Attack EVs provided allow Milotic to OHKO 4 HP Bisharp with Hydro Pump at +0 and 4 HP Mega Kangaskhan while at +2. The given Speed EVs let Milotic outspeed neutral-natured, fully invested, base 70 Speed Pokemon, particularly Bisharp. The remaining HP and Defense EVs allow Milotic to survive Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Return.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Milotic is a good option to choose as a lead if the opponent has an Intimidate user such as the very common Landorus-T. There are two different situations in which it is optimal to switch in Milotic. One is when you have two threatening physical attackers on the field and the opponent is going to bring in their Intimidate user to try to lower their Attack. The other situation is when your opponent is going to go for Icy Wind or Snarl, which Milotic takes little damage from and can use to activate Competitive. Remember to take into account that Milotic will only be affected by Intimidate if it comes onto the field before the Intimidate user.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Milotic requires a decent amount of support, so there are a good number of teammate options to keep in mind when using it. For starters, Pokemon that benefit from not having to fear Intimidate are great partners for Milotic, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Diancie, and Landorus-T. Many Grass-type Pokemon, such as Ferrothorn and Ludicolo, are good checks to Milotic, so having a Pokemon to beat them is also beneficial. A good choice to fulfill this role is Talonflame, as it also benefits from Milotic's deterrence of Intimidate users. Opposing Water-types, such as Keldeo and Rotom-W, will also cause trouble for Milotic, as they resist both of its attacks. Good options to beat them are Grass-types such as Serperior and Electric-types such as Thundurus and Zapdos. Lastly, Milotic will benefit heavily from the speed control provided by Tailwind users such as Talonflame, Zapdos, and Latios.</p> "

Dusclops offers support moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Helping Hand, a typing that counters Mega Kangaskhan and beats Fake Out, and the ability to consistently break Aegislash and Heatran Substitutes. However, Porygon2 is usually a better choice for a bulky Trick Room setter with its access to reliable recovery, semblance of an offensive presence, and typing that isn't redundant with that of other setters, and otherwise Dusclops is usually outclassed by Pokemon such as Jellicent, Reuniclus, and Cresselia, which can use their item slot or ability to beat common Trick Room checks such as sleep, Taunt, and super effective attacks.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Disable is a powerful move that often forces out foes. Taunt is reasonably viable as a way of stopping Amoonguss and many other Pokemon once Trick Room is already up and could be used over Helping Hand or even Night Shade, perhaps with enough Speed IVs to outrun Amoonguss before setting Trick Room.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Sleep: Barring the rare Taunt after Trick Room is already up, Dusclops has absolutely no defense against sleep. Because Dusclops will usually rely on its partner (often Fake Out) to keep sleep users at bay on the first turn, and because it usually doesn't run Protect, Fake Out + sleep and Quick Guard + sleep are especially potent. Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur in particular are still quite threatening to Trick Room teams once Trick Room has already been set.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Dusclops has absolutely no defense against Taunt. Because Dusclops will usually rely on its partner (often Fake Out) to deal with Taunt users and because it often lacks Protect, Taunt Gengar, Fake Out + Taunt, and Quick Guard + Taunt are especially troublesome.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: While Dark-types technically don't OHKO Dusclops, they definitely deal a ton of damage to it and often their partner can finish the job. Physical ones can Knock Off its Eviolite as well, though they must beware Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and Rotom-H are immune to Will-O-Wisp and quickly KO Dusclops. Heatran in particular is a great Trick Room check in general and can even fish for a Flash Fire boost.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Aegislash, particularly the Substitute variant, is a great Trick Room check in general and 2HKOes Dusclops. Taunt Gengar and Taunt Mega Gengar also handle it extremely well and ones without Taunt fare decently.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Trick Room is to Dusclops as Drizzle is to Politoed. Will-O-Wisp is often Dusclops's most threatening move, as halving Attack keeps physical attackers at bay and the consistent passive damage is quite useful. Night Shade is necessary to avoid being Taunt bait or giving free Substitutes to Heatran and Aegislash, which can be quite the pain for Trick Room teams. Helping Hand is a great move to help teammates grab OHKOs they wouldn't otherwise get, especially for Trick Room teams, which need to do massive damage on a short timer. Protect is always useful in many ways for positioning, but since Dusclops is so fat and immune to Fake Out it's less important than for most other Pokemon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread allows Dusclops to survive every conceivable unboosted attack—in particular it tanks Life Orb Hoopa-U's Hyperspace Fury. Frisk is incompatible with Helping Hand but otherwise the better ability. Eviolite is the obvious choice of item; if you're running anything else, don't use Dusclops.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Only use Dusclops on full Trick Room teams, as it's worthless besides its ability to set Trick Room. Most teams have a dedicated counter-lead to common Dusclops leads, so if the opponent has things such as Taunt or sleep users on their team you should keep Dusclops in the back and slip it in when its checks are off the field. It's usually a mistake to keep Dusclops on the field wasting precious Trick Room turns after it's used the move—try to pivot to one of your hard-hitting attackers as soon as possible.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fake Out support is neat to completely guarantee that Dusclops doesn't faint in one turn, as well as helping to get around things such as Spore and Taunt, though it's far from perfect at beating those. Mega Kangaskhan, Scrafty, and Hariyama are good Fake Out users for Trick Room, though beware when using Scrafty, as Intimidate will trigger Defiant on Bisharp, which then can OHKO Dusclops with Knock Off. Dusclops will need multiple sleep-immune partners; options include Overcoat Reuniclus, Safety Goggles Fire- or Steel-types, Mega Abomasnow, and Amoonguss.</p> "

High-Base Power moves with nearly unresisted coverage make it a perfect choice for offensive teams that need a way to break more defensive teams and the speed control advantage. Its access to Intimidate as well as useful resistances to Fire-, Water-, and Fighting-type moves also give it defensive utility on a team. However, its typing gives it unfortunate weaknesses to Fairy-type moves coming from threatening Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Mega Gardevoir, as well as the more rare but just as lethal Ice-type coverage on Pokemon like Thundurus and Suicune. These weaknesses, combined with its relative frailty and average Speed, make it an unreliable Tailwind setter in many cases. Additionally, its most common moves come with an unfortunate chance to miss, lowering its consistency and reliability.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Salamence can run a plethora of resist Berries to cover up its weaknesses. Yache Berry covers stray Hidden Power Ices from Pokemon like Thundurus and Blaziken, while Charti Berry allows it to take a Diamond Storm from Mega Diancie or take less from a Rock Slide from Pokemon such as Terrakion and Landorus-T. Rock coverage of its own can be useful for knocking out Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Volcarona. Protect can be used, but Salamence really appreciates its expansive coverage more. Choice Scarf is an option to increase Salamence's Speed immediately; however, Tailwind is generally more useful, and Choice Scarf hinders its ability to effectively utilize its stellar coverage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Many Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon can blast through Salamence with Pixilate Hyper Voice while taking little damage due to their high Special Defense. Azumarill is one of the few Pokemon that either are immune to or resist all of Salamence's common coverage options and can use this to knock Salamence out with Play Rough or set up a relatively safe Belly Drum.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon: STAB Ice-type moves coming from Weavile and Choice Scarf Kyurem-B are among the most efficient ways to deal with Salamence. Ice Shard from Pokemon like Abomasnow and Mamoswine can be threatening; however, Intimidate lowers its damage output significantly, forcing them to come in after Salamence to ensure the KO. Many Electric-types like Thundurus and Zapdos also run Hidden Power Ice, which can catch Salamence for a huge hit. Milotic not only commonly carries Ice Beam, but also gains a huge boost from Competitive if affected by Salamence's Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Fast Rock-type Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Terrakion can hit Salamence for massive damage with their STAB attacks. Rock-type moves used as coverage on Pokemon like Landorus-T can dent it as well.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Trick Room, and Tailwind</strong>: Speed control on the opposing team negates the speed advantage that Salamence provides with Tailwind and makes it a lot more vulnerable to strong attackers. Paralysis from common users like Thundurus and Gyarados allows normally slower Pokemon like Rhyperior and Kyurem-B, even under Tailwind, to knock out Salamence without taking a hit. Trick Room is similarly catastrophic, allowing threats like Sylveon and Hoopa-U to hit Salamence before it attacks. Common Trick Room setters include Hoopa-U and Cresselia, which Salamence can't break due to their amazing special bulk. Though Tailwind does not necessarily allow the opposing team to outspeed Salamence, it evens the playing field and allows the normally faster Pokemon to threaten Salamence before it can fire off another hit. Many common, bulkier Tailwind setters like Suicune and Zapdos can take any hit from Salamence and set it up.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out: Fake Out threatens Salamence due to it usually not carrying Protect, which disrupts its plan and allows the other Pokemon to easily take advantage of the free turn.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is a very high-powered attack that can rip holes through the opposing team. For its power, though, it comes with the drawback of a sharp Special Attack drop, so it should be used sparingly. Fire Blast is Salamence's first coverage move and roasts Steel-types that resist Draco Meteor such as Aegislash and Ferrothorn. Flamethrower may also be used for a weaker but more accurate alternative. Hydro Pump is the second coverage move and KOes the two most common Pokemon that resist the two above moves, Mega Diancie and Heatran. It also covers Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Terrakion that will survive a Draco Meteor. Tailwind doubles the Speed of Salamence's team, providing crucial speed control for offensive teammates. This also allows Salamence to use its coverage to its full potential because it can outspeed and knock out Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Choice Scarf Landorus-T that would otherwise threaten it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Salamence invests its EVs into Special Attack and Speed to maximize its offensive potential. A Timid nature is used to outspeed all non-Choice Scarf variants of Landorus-T and Hydreigon as well as tying with other common base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Mega Kangaskhan. A Modest nature is also viable to hit as hard as possible. Intimidate drops the Attack of the opposing Pokemon, which helps against physical attackers. Life Orb gives Salamence more power on all of its moves while keeping its flexibility in move choice.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Using Fire Blast or Hydro Pump to knock out weakened enemies is generally a better idea than using Draco Meteor, as the Special Attack drop can be crippling and tends to force Salamence to switch out. Setting Tailwind the first turn Salamence is out is generally a good idea to pressure the opponent's team as much as possible, though it is not correct in every scenario. If your team is already faster than the opponent's and Tailwind doesn't improve the situation, do not waste a turn using it. Switching Salamence around as often as possible can circumvent Draco Meteor drops as well as preserve Intimidate to check physical attackers. Try to avoid bringing Salamence in on Defiant and Competitive users such as Bisharp and Milotic, as it gives them an Attack or Special Attack boost, making them a lot scarier to face down. Salamence tends to work well as a lead to get the speed advantage as soon as possible in a match, while Intimidate prevents physical attackers like Mega Kangaskhan and Landorus-T from doing too much damage early on in the game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Offensive partners that can pressure the opponent with the speed advantage that Tailwind provides are the best teammates for Salamence. Notable examples include Mega Kangaskhan, which provides Fake Out support to ease setting up Tailwind, and Keldeo, which can switch into Ice-type moves that Salamence loathes. Steel-types like Aegislash and Heatran are critical on teams with Salamence to switch into its weaknesses, most importantly its Fairy- and Ice-type ones, and to beat Salamence's most dangerous checks like Mega Diancie. Jirachi gets a special mention for resisting all of Salamence's weaknesses and redirecting away dangerous attacks so Salamence can run through the opposing team. Slower Pokemon that would rarely outspeed the other team but pack of a lot of offensive power also mesh well with Salamence's Tailwind support, with Pokemon such as Sylveon and Volcanion fitting into this category.</p> "

  "Metagross": {
    "overview": "<p>Unlike the all-out offensive Mega Evolutions such as Diancie, Charizard Y, and Kangaskhan, Mega Metagross is held back by its poor offensive typing and the low Base Power of its STAB moves. It gives free momentum to the opponent's Steel-types, especially Aegislash, and it can be stopped by common Intimidate users, including Landorus-T. It's also pretty useless after being paralyzed or burned, though unlike Diancie and Charizard Y, it has the bulk to ride out temporary field conditions such as Tailwind and Trick Room. Moreover, with its good defensive typing, high base Speed, and fantastic stats all around, Mega Metagross is still able to serve as an effective speedy attacker, pivot, and utility check to offensive Pokemon such as Keldeo. It's not forced out too easily, except by Aegislash, and it can come in without much difficulty and threaten to deal major damage to offensive Pokemon or potential switch-ins. While the \"big three\" Mega Evolutions mentioned above may provide immense power, they require a lot of support; Mega Metagross, with its high Speed and numerous resistances, provides both some power and some support and is often a great choice for teams not built around a Mega Evolution.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rock Slide is an option to hit Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Volcarona, but does pitiful damage otherwise. Grass Knot is available to hit Suicune and Mega Swampert while getting a Tough Claws boost, although it forces Metagross to use a nature that lowers a defensive stat. Magnet Rise gives Metagross an immunity to Ground and, when combined with Clear Body, stops Landorus-T cold; it also allows Mega Metagross to definitively beat Earth Power users such as Mega Diancie, and Kyurem-B. Refresh is an option to turn the tables on opposing Rotom-W and Thundurus by removing the status conditions they inflict, getting Metagross back in the game. Hone Claws is Metagross's only reliable option to boost its Attack and makes its STAB attacks 100% accurate. Finally, it gets Earthquake. While it does hit the Steel-types that otherwise wall Mega Metagross, Earthquake does not get STAB nor a Tough Claws boost and is incredibly weak as a result, doing barely more to Heatran than Hammer Arm.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: While a non-Mega Metagross can avoid the former with Clear Body, these are very effective ways to neuter Mega Metagross. Landorus-T and Gyarados are significant threats with Intimidate and the ability to cripple or KO it (although Mega Metagross can run Ice Punch and Thunder Punch to beat their respective targets). Sableye, Talonflame, and bulky Rotom-W are the best candidates for burning Metagross; the former two outrun it, while the latter can take a Zen Headbutt.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Bisharp, Heatran, and Aegislash all resist Metagross's STAB attacks and hit it for massive damage in return.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Rotom-H threaten Metagross with boosted Fire attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Darkrai, Greninja, and Hydreigon are notable for their ability to outspeed and hit Mega Metagross with super effective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Gengar and Aegislash both have a decent match up and can destroy Mega Metagross with Shadow Ball. Mega Gengar is even capable of trapping it for a guaranteed revenge kill.</p> <p><strong>Landorus-T: Choice Scarf Landorus-T is a major threat because it outruns Mega Metagross, Intimidates it, and then uses Earthquake; it should be noted, however, that Landorus-T's Earthquake does not OHKO Mega Metagross.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room</strong>: Because a large part of Mega Metagross's viability hinges on its high Speed, it is very vulnerable to speed control. Tailwind from the likes of Suicune and Talonflame lets slower partners get the jump on it and its teammates for a few turns. Thunder Wave from Thundurus permanently slows down Mega Metagross, letting even Aegislash outrun it. Trick Room makes an opposing Mega Metagross very vulnerable to attacks from the likes of Mega Camerupt and Aegislash. Cresselia is the Trick Room setter than can most easily set it in front of Metagross, although there are other viable setters, such as Jellicent.</p> ",

        "name": "Mega Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Mega Metagross's most important moves are its STAB options. Meteor Mash is Metagross's strongest attack and has a chance to boost its Attack and make it even more threatening. Iron Head can be used over Meteor Mash for its greater accuracy and a 30% chance to flinch its target, but has lower Base Power. This drop is noticeable in at least one common instance: Meteor Mash OHKOes standard Kyurem-B, but Iron Head does not. Zen Headbutt is also quite strong and patches the Steel typing's poor offensive coverage. Protect is important because it allows Metagross to safely Mega Evolve and reach Mega Metagross's higher base Speed; it also helps stall out field conditions such as rain and Trick Room.</p> <p>The final moveslot has many possible options. Hammer Arm is a powerful option that lets Mega Metagross damage Steel-types besides Aegislash, OHKO Hydreigon and have a chance at OHKOing Mega Kangaskhan, but must be used cautiously because of its Speed-lowering effect. Ice Punch can be used for the sole purpose of OHKOing Landorus-T, but Mega Metagross's STAB moves will still do hefty damage at -1, so it's not vital. Substitute lets Metagross avoid status moves from the likes of Thundurus, Rotom-W, and Amoonguss and lets it soak up a single hit if set up safely. Substitute also blocks Intimidate, which makes using Substitute on the turn Metagross Mega Evolves a cool strategy—Landorus-T's Intimidate is useless on that turn because of Clear Body, and is useless on the next turns because of Substitute. Bullet Punch is rather weak, but very useful for hitting specific threats. It should only be considered on teams that totally lack priority or are uncomfortably weak to Mega Diancie. If necessary for a team's function, Mega Metagross can drop one of its STAB options for one of these moves, although this is not recommended.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>It may seem that Metagross's ability before Mega Evolving does not matter, as it almost certainly will be Mega Evolving as soon as possible. However, this is untrue—Clear Body renders Metagross immune to the weakening effects of Intimidate, making it futile for Landorus-T and other Intimidate users to switch in. The EV spread is simple but effective. Attack and Speed receive full investment to best suit Mega Metagross's stats and ability. A Jolly nature lets it take advantage of its great Speed tier. There are some alternate EV spreads that can be run; 16 HP / 240 Atk / 252 Spe lets Mega Metagross survive a Sucker Punch from Adamant Life Orb Bisharp and makes Substitutes that can be broken by Adamant Landorus-T's U-turn only with a maximum damage roll. Another possible EV spread is 72 HP / 252 Atk / 184 Spe with an Adamant nature. This bulkier spread is best used on semi-Trick Room teams. It outruns neutral base 101 Speed Pokemon normally, and after a Hammer Arm it will be slower than opposing Rotom-W, so Mega Metagross will outrun it under Trick Room. The Adamant nature gives it a high chance to OHKO Heatran with Hammer Arm and a small chance to OHKO 4 HP / 0 Def Mega Charizard Y with Zen Headbutt, although most Mega Charizard Y are bulkier, so you must be cautious.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If your opponent has a Pokemon that Metagross needs its Speed to dispatch, such as Keldeo or Hydreigon, then it is best to Mega Evolve as soon as possible, even going as far as leading with Metagross to do it, so that you don't need to waste a turn on Protect when you need Mega Metagross ready to switch in. Otherwise, you can wait until you need it to attack to Mega Evolve, sometimes waiting on purpose so that Clear Body can block an Intimidate. Mega Metagross has the bulk to switch in multiple times throughout a match, which it uses to its advantage. Typically, Metagross is best brought in when it can score an OHKO, and then it just uses the appropriate move. Because Mega Metagross's main prey, Keldeo, is typically a cleanup Pokemon, Metagross often comes in after a teammate faints, though its good bulk also lets it come in on weak or resisted hits. Once Mega Metagross is no longer able to OHKO something, or once it's threatened by a Pokemon such as Talonflame, you switch it back out, and it comes back in again later. Metagross gives free momentum to Aegislash and, should it lack Hammer Arm, Heatran. If your opponent has one, you will need to play more aggressively with Metagross than usual, double switching and the like. Substitute Mega Metagross plays somewhat differently from three-attacks, coming in on Pokemon that allow it to set up a Substitute, such as Amoonguss, and only switching once both its Substitute is broken and it cannot KO anything.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Between its incredible offensive presence and its innate defensive capabilities, it's very difficult to find a team that won't benefit from using Mega Metagross. In many cases where a team is not built around a Mega Pokemon, Metagross will often be the best fit thanks to its supportive capabilities. Mega Metagross's best partners are Pokemon that can beat Steel-types and bulky Water-types, as these two groups are perhaps its biggest threats. Hydreigon is an excellent partner here, as it threatens all of Aegislash, Jirachi, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Rotom-W. Mega Metagross greatly appreciates any type of speed control, including Tailwind, Thunder Wave, and even Icy Wind, from partners such as Talonflame, Thundurus, and Cresselia. This allows Mega Metagtoss to outrun foes and lets it get past some Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T. Politoed is a nice partner for those who want to use rain, as it negates Metagross's Fire weakness and allows Swift Swim partners to remove fast attackers and Choice Scarf users. Like all offensive Pokemon, Mega Metagross enjoys redirection support from the likes of Amoonguss and Togekiss to let it avoid attacks and continue its rampage. When building around Mega Metagross, other Pokemon to add are those that enjoy what it has to offer. Hydreigon is again a great partner, as Mega Metagross removes the Fairy-types and Fighting-types that Hydreigon fears, and together the two hit both physically and specially.</p> "

  "Latias": {
    "overview": "<p>With its great bulk, good defensive typing, and access to reliable recovery, Mega Latias carves a niche for itself as a Calm Mind sweeper. However, it faces heavy competition from Cresselia, which does the same thing without taking up a Mega slot. Unlike Cresselia, though, Mega Latias is more immediately threatening, due to its higher Speed and Special Attack and has better resistances thanks to its Dragon typing, making it a serviceable alternative. Without boosts, Mega Latias's damage output is quite underwhelming; due to needing setup to function effectively, Mega Latias is reliant on well-played support, such as redirection and Fake Out, to work well. Another thing to note is that Mega Latias's effectiveness as a sweeper is often dictated by its matchups against opposing teams, in a sense that it is able to easily set up against some teams and will have a hard time doing the same against others. Finally, like any other setup sweeper, Mega Latias needs its checks removed or sufficiently weakened before being able to sweep effectively late-game; in particular, Mega Latias struggles against that numerous Steel-, Fairy-, and Dark-types in the metagame such as Bisharp, Mega Metagross, and Sylveon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A non-Mega Latias set can be run, but it is generally outclassed by Cresselia in most supportive roles and overshadowed by Latios as an attacker. However, it does have a few niches, most notably its Speed compared to Cresselia and the bulk it has over Latios. An offensive set is viable because, although it's weaker compared to Latios, the extra bulk it has can be appealing, letting it switch in and take hits from foes better than Latios; for example, Latios is 2HKOed by Modest Ludicolo's Ice Beam, while Latias only has a 22.6% chance to be 2HKOed from the same hit. Latias can also run Tailwind much like how Latios does, but the extra bulk makes setting it more reliable. A fast dual screens set can be run, and compared to other dual screen users such as Meowstic and Klefki, Latias has higher bulk and better presence offensively. Other niche moves can be used, such as Healing Wish to give a teammate a second chance, Helping Hand to boost a teammate's damage output, and Heal Pulse to give a teammate a nifty jolt of recovery.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Opposing Dark-types such as Bisharp, Darkrai, and Hoopa-U are big threats, as they threaten Mega Latias while being immune to Psychic-type attacks. Hoopa-U can take a Draco Meteor and OHKO with Hyperspace Fury.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Aegislash and Gengar can significantly damage Mega Latias as long as it hasn't accumulated boosts yet. Mega Gengar can trap and KO with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types such as Aegislash and Ferrothorn can easily take a hit, as they resist both of Mega Latias's STAB moves, and hit back hard.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Mega Mawile are immune to Mega Latias's Dragon-type STAB moves and can hit it super effectively, with the former able to hit through Substitutes with Pixilate Hyper Voice.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Thunder Wave takes away one of Mega Latias's biggest assets in its Speed, making it vulnerable to strong attacks and unable to sweep. Fortunately, Thunder Wave is blocked by Substitute. Thundurus can paralyze Mega Latias with Prankster Thunder Wave while also being able to stop setup with Taunt. Trick Room reverses turn order, making Mega Latias vulnerable for a while by taking away its Speed advantage. Cresselia can tank any hit Mega Latias can throw at it and Aromatisse is immune to Mega Latias's Dragon Pulse, making them good for setting Trick Room against it. Tailwind works in the same vein, as it also removes Mega Latias's Speed advantage, but instead of reversing turn order, it doubles the Speed of the opponent's Pokemon. Togekiss has high Special Defense and is immune to Dragon, letting it set Tailwind with ease.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out: As Mega Latias doesn't carry Protect, it can't block Fake Out from the likes of Mega Kangaskhan and Scrafty, stunning it for a turn.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore: Taunt, mostly run by Thundurus, stops all of Mega Latias's forms of recovery and setup, turning it into a sitting duck. While setting up, Mega Latias has to watch out for Encore from the likes of Whimsicott and Politoed, as this instantly turns Mega Latias into a non-factor on the field if locked into a setup move.</p> ",

        "name": "Substitute + Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind boosts Mega Latias's Special Attack to high levels, increasing its damage output, as well as its Special Defense, letting it tolerate opposing special attacks better. Substitute shields Mega Latias from status and lets it set up on strong attackers without fear. Substitute also lets Mega Latias set up while avoiding opposing Sucker Punch users and the possibility of being ravaged by an untimely critical hit. Stored Power gains boosts to its Base Power as more Calm Mind boosts are accumulated. However, as Stored Power is pitifully weak without a boost, Psyshock and Dragon Pulse are usable alternatives to have an attacking option even while without a boost. Psyshock is preferred as it deals more damage to various relevant targets, such as Mega Charizard Y, Amoonguss, and Sylveon, but Dragon Pulse has marginally better neutral coverage. Recover lets Mega Latias regain its health, letting it stay in play and continually set up longer.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature let Mega Latias be as fast possible, Speed tying with opposing positive natured base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and outspeeding threats such as Terrakion and Keldeo. The rest of the EVs are invested in HP and Defense in order to give Mega Latias bulk, helping it take hits better and making setup easier. Latiasite is used in order to Mega Evolve.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is recommended to Mega Evolve as soon as possible in order to take advantage of the increase in bulk, letting Mega Latias shrug off attacks and set up much more easily. Always try to maintain a decent amount of health with Recover, as Mega Latias needs to be healthy in order to position itself to safely set up. Use Substitute as often as possible in order to block possibly crippling damage and status, such as paralysis or sleep, giving Mega Latias safe opportunities to boost with Calm Mind safely. Rack up Calm Mind boosts as much as possible because Mega Latias's unboosted damage output is quite underwhelming and it can't pose a threat at all if running Stored Power. However, before attempting to set up and clean the opposing team, Mega Latias needs its main checks removed or significantly weakened, most notably opposing Steel-, Fairy-, and, most importantly, Dark-types.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Being a setup sweeper, Mega Latias appreciates partners that can help give it safe opportunities to boost. Redirection support is appreciated in order to divert attacks aimed at Mega Latias, giving it chances to set up. Togekiss can redirect attacks with Follow Me while also providing addition support with Tailwind, and Amoonguss can divert hits with Rage Powder and cripple foes with Spore. A partner with Fake Out can disable a foe for a turn, providing a chance to quickly set up. Scrafty boasts access Fake Out while also having Intimidate to soften incoming physical hits. Wide Guard support is useful to block incoming spread moves, most importantly Sylveon's Pixilate Hyper Voice. Aegislash has Wide Guard and a good match-up against Sylveon, which a threat to Mega Latias. Additional speed control support is appreciated, as although Mega Latias has high Speed, it's still outrun by threats such as Darkrai and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Thundurus has Prankster Thunder Wave along with Taunt to stop opposing Trick Room from being set, while Suicune and Togekiss boast Tailwind, with the former also notable for being able to beat opposing Heatran, a threat that walls Mega Latias.</p> <p>Mega Latias also needs teammates that can deal with its checks in order for it to clean up the opposing team effectively. Most importantly, Mega Latias needs support from partners that can remove opposing Dark-types, as they are immune to its Psychic-type attacks. Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion can take out Dark-type foes with ease, and Volcarona can hit them with Bug Buzz while also providing additional Speed in Tailwind or redirection support. Partners that can dent opposing Steel-types, which resist both Psychic and Dragon, are recommended, the most notable being Keldeo and Landorus-T. Teammates that can beat opposing Fairy-types also are appreciated, as Fairy-types can hit Mega Latias super effectively and are immune to Dragon Pulse, with some being able to hit through Substitute with Pixilate Hyper Voice. Aegislash and Heatran fit the role well as they can switch in on Fairy-types with ease and hit back with a super effective move.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>With a combination of high Special Attack and Speed, Latios is a force to be reckoned with in the Doubles metagame. Boasting high power, Latios can severely damage or even KO a significant portion of the metagame with Draco Meteor alone. For an attacker, Latios sports good defensive typing, making it a good switch-in for notable Special attacks such as Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave and Keldeo's Hydro Pump. Latios can also provide invaluable support by providing speed control in the form of Tailwind. However, Latios only has average bulk and is notably physically frail. Its strongest move, Draco Meteor, also has the nasty drawback of weakening Latios's power, meaning Latios is much less threatening once it's fired off the move. Lastly, Latios is easily switched in on and beaten by the numerous Steel- and Fairy-types in the metagame, such as Mega Metagross, Sylveon, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Diancie.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute can be run to play around Sucker Punch and to avoid powerful attacks and status. Hidden Power Fire is an option to nab KOs on common Steel-type switch-ins such as Scizor and Ferrothorn, but it can't get past Heatran due to being nullified by Flash Fire and it forces Latios to give up one Speed IV, leaving it outsped by fully invested base 110s. A Mega set should not be run, as it's outclassed by the Life Orb variant, which hits harder and doesn't use the Mega slot. Recover is an option to give Latios longevity, recovering back health lost so it can stay in play longer. Dragon Pulse can be used instead of Draco Meteor for a Dragon STAB move that doesn't lower Latios' Special Attack. Thunderbolt can be run in order to 2HKO Togekiss while also hitting bulky Water-types such as Gyarados and Politoed super effectively. While seen on some Latios, Ice Beam is not recommended because it has redundant coverage with Draco Meteor, which is stronger and already gets the KO on threats Ice Beam hits super effectively, such as Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Dark-type Pokemon such as Bisharp, Darkrai, and Hoopa-U can easily KO Latios with their respective STAB moves, with Bisharp being able to switch in on Latios's STAB moves and hit back with a priority Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Fairy-types, such as Mega Gardevoir and Diancie, can switch in on Draco Meteor safely and KO back with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-type Pokemon such as Aegislash, Ferrothorn, Mega Metagross, and Heatran can switch in on a majority of Latios's attacks and significantly or, in Heatran's case, gradually damage it. Jirachi can redirect Latios's attacks while being able to take them reliably and completely walling Latios's standard moveset.</p> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan: Mega Kangaskhan deals significant damage with its Normal-type STAB moves while also packing Sucker Punch to bypass Latios's Speed.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room</strong>: As Latios is faster than a majority of the metagame, Trick Room puts it at a disadvantage by making it slower than most Pokemon and highlighting its only average bulk. Cresselia can reliably set Trick Room while taking everything Latios has. Diancie can also set Trick Room without fearing Draco Meteor. Opposing Tailwind takes advantage of Latios's average bulk by making the majority of the opposing team move first. Life Orb Talonflame can set it while hitting Latios hard, and Suicune can tank a Draco Meteor and hit back with Ice Beam. Thunder Wave takes away Latios's precious Speed. Thundurus can paralyze Latios with Thunder Wave while being near-guaranteed to get it off thanks to Prankster. Icy Wind lowers Latios's Speed to manageable levels while also hitting super effectively. Politoed is able to hit with Icy Wind while being bulky enough to take a Draco Meteor.</p> ",

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Latios's most powerful STAB move and is able to KO or at least deal significant damage to most targets. However, it has the drawback of lowering Latios's Special Attack by two stages, so Draco Meteor has to be used carefully or else Latios will easily become setup bait for switch-ins that resist or are immune to Dragon. Psyshock is a secondary STAB move that hits does not lower Latios's power. As Psyshock tagets physical defense, it can also hit foes with lower Defense than Special Defense, such as Mega Charizard Y, and Pokemon holding an Assault Vest harder. Psychic can be used instead for its higher Base Power to hit threats such as Amoonguss and Landorus-T harder. Tailwind lets Latios support its teammates by doubling their Speed, helping them outspeed and KO threats they couldn't safely otherwise. Using Tailwind also lets Latios act while ignoring opposing Sucker Punch, essentially gaining a free turn to set up while avoiding getting KOed. On teams that don't need Tailwind support, Hidden Power Ground is a useful option for OHKOing Heatran and threathening other Steel-types that would otherwise wall Latios, such as Aegislash and Mega Metagross. The final move, Protect, is a staple move, letting Latios stall out field conditions, shield itself from damage, and give teammates room to do work.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb boosts Latios's damage output to higher levels, letting it easily get more KOs. Draco Plate is a usable alternative to still boost Draco Meteor's power but without the recoil, but its lower power boost and limit to Dragon-type moves make it unappealing. The given EV investment maximizes power and Speed. With Timid, Latios outruns many notable threats such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With Latios's high power, it is recommended to blast holes in the opposing team early-game with Draco Meteor. Be wary of using Draco Meteor, however, if the opponent still has healthy Steel- or Fairy-type Pokemon to switch in. Due to Draco Meteor's drawbacks and Life Orb recoil, it's recommended to play Latios as a hit-and-run attacker, switching out after a successful hit in order to shake off the Special Attack drop. In cases when using Draco Meteor is not preferred, such as when Latios doesn't want to incur the Special Attack drop, it can attack with Psyshock instead.</p> <p>Thanks to its nice defensive typing along with Levitate, Latios can function as a switch-in for numerous notable attacks, especially special ones such as Hydro Pump and Heat Wave. It's useful to set Tailwind in cases when Latios can safely do so, such as when it can take any move the opposing Pokemon have or when Latios can threaten to KO. Doing so can maintain momentum and let Latios's teammates be much more dangerous, getting KOs on threats they wouldn't be able to otherwise. Using Tailwind can also let Latios avoid opposing Sucker Punch in a pinch while still being helpful to its team. In the late-game, Latios can function effectively as a cleaner thanks to its high power and Speed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As Latios is an offensive Pokemon, it greatly appreciates teammates that can beat or at least switch in on opposing Pokemon that check it. Steel-types such as Mega Metagross and Heatran make for good partners, as they can switch in on opposing Dragon- and Fairy-type moves safely. Pokemon that can reliably switch in and beat opposing Dark-types are also recommended. Terrakion matches up well against Dark-type Pokemon, as it is able to get an Attack boost by switching in on Dark-type attacks thanks to Justified, while Mega Kangaskhan can nab KOs on a number of Dark-types and at the same time boost its Attack by using Power-Up Punch. Other Fighting-types such as Breloom and Scrafty can also fare well against Dark-type Pokemon, though Scrafty must be wary of giving opposing Bisharp a Defiant boost with its Intimidate. Latios also appreciates Quick Guard to block strong priority attacks such as Sucker Punch and Talonflame's Gale Wings Brave Bird. Again, Terrakion makes a good teammate because it can beat opposing Dark-types while being able to support Latios with Quick Guard.</p> <p>Fake Out support is useful to give Latios a free turn to set Tailwind or get a free turn to hit with Draco Meteor. Mega Kangaskhan has access to Fake Out and is a very strong attacker overall, and Scrafty can provide additional support with Intimidate. Pokemon that work well in Tailwind appreciate Latios as a partner as well. Breloom works well in Tailwind, as the Speed boost allows it to neuter almost any active threat with Spore. Strong attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y also appreciate being able to attack with less risk of being outrun and damaged.</p> "

  "Deoxys-Attack": {
    "overview": "<p>Possessing high Attack and Speed stats along with access to a powerful STAB move in Psycho Boost, Deoxys-A fits very well on hyper offense teams as a check to fast Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Mega Diancie. Its Psycho Boost hits most threats neutrally, which, when combined with Fighting-type coverage, covers a significant portion of the metagame. On the other hand, Deoxys-A has a poor matchup against Mega Kangaskhan, which threatens Deoxys-A with Fake Out and can also OHKO it through its Focus Sash with a Parental Bond-boosted Sucker Punch. In addition, Psycho Boost and Superpower lower Deoxys-A's damage output, making it a poor answer to bulkier threats in the metagame. Its extremely poor defenses leave it susceptible to even the weakest of moves and force it to run Focus Sash to compensate for them. Deoxys-A is especially vulnerable to priority attacks, as they will bring it down to its Focus Sash or finish it off after its Focus Sash has been broken before it can move. Opposing speed control such as Trick Room, Tailwind, and Thunder Wave take away Deoxys-A's Speed, which is its biggest asset.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ice Beam is an option that OHKOes Landorus-T without dropping Deoxys-A's Special Attack like Psycho Boost does. However, the other coverage options typically work better for either giving Deoxys-A the ability to outprioritize other threats or helping it cover Aegislash and Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Latios. Life Orb greatly augments Deoxys-A's damage output, but forgoing Focus Sash sacrifices its ability to take a hit.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon:  Psychic-type Pokemon such as Latios, Cresselia, and Mega Metagross can easily take any attack from Deoxys-A hit back at its paper-thin bulk. They have to be wary of Knock Off, however.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon Not Weak to Fighting-type Attacks: Aegislash, Mega Metagross, Jirachi, and Bronzong can take Deoxys-A's Psychic- and Fighting-type moves easily and capitalize on its frailty.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks: Priority attacks such as Fake Out, Talonflame's Brave Bird, and Mega Metagross's Bullet Punch can outrun Deoxys-A if it doesn't use Extreme Speed, possibly KOing Deoxys-A or its partner before either of them can move.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Certain very fast threats, most notably Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T, nullify Deoxys-A's most important advantage in its Speed; however, such fast threats are uncommon.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Tailwind, Trick Room, and Thunder Wave all reduce Deoxys-A's offensive presence by forcing it to move slower and makes it more prone to getting OHKOed.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: While Psycho Boost is a special move, Deoxys-A still relies heavily on its physical attacks. As such, Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp users such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W, respectively, can heavily cripple it.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psycho Boost OHKOes most Pokemon that it hits neutrally, except for particularly bulky Pokemon such as Suicune and Zapdos. Superpower lets Deoxys-A cover Steel- and Dark-types such as Heatran, Bisharp, and Hydreigon, which resist or are immune to Psycho Boost. Extreme Speed is a +2 priority move, which allows Deoxys-A to move before opposing priority moves, such as Sucker Punch, Talonflame's Brave Bird, and Thundurus's Thunder Wave, letting Deoxys-A revenge kill these priority users or at least deal damage to them before it faints. Knock Off is an option that enables Deoxys-A to hit Psychic-types such as Latios and Jirachi as well as Aegislash, which resists Psycho Boost and is immune to Superpower. Detect is an all-around good move in Doubles OU, allowing Deoxys-A to avoid being targeted while its partner maneuvers to improve the position for it. In addition, Detect can be used to stall out field conditions such as weather, Trick Room, and Tailwind.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximizing Special Attack enables Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost to deal the most damage possible. A Naive nature and maximum Speed EVs let Deoxys-A outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T and some +1 Pokemon, such as Blaziken and Volcarona. The remaining 4 EVs are put into Attack for a slight boost to Deoxys-A's physical moves. An alternative EV spread of 48 Atk / 208 SpA / 252 Spe guarantees an OHKO on Hydreigon with Superpower, and another EV spread of 112 Atk / 144 SpA / 252 Spe can be used to OHKO Latios with Knock Off. A Focus Sash is necessary to try to make the most out of Deoxys-A's abysmal defenses.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Deoxys-A's extremely poor bulk means that it can't switch in on any opposing moves, so bring it into play primarily as a lead or after a teammate faints. Deoxys-A works best against other hyper offense teams, as it is the fastest viable Pokemon in the metagame, outspeeding and KOing many Pokemon before they can act, so utilize it to keep opposing offensive threats such as Keldeo and Landorus-T out of the fight. Avoid using Deoxys-A to confront bulky threats it has difficulty breaking down such as Suicune and Aegislash. In addition, Deoxys-A needs to avoid opposing speed control effects such as Trick Room, Tailwind, and Thunder Wave, as these cripple its offensive pressure by forcing it to move slower. Keep it paired with offensively focused Pokemon so that it can maintain the offensive pressure necessary to keep the opposing team at bay in terms of momentum. When using Deoxys-A be conscious of how the stat drops from Psycho Boost, Superpower, and Intimidate severely cripple its damage output; switching it out allows it to restore its damage output when necessary or convenient. Be aware that possible chip damage from switch-ins with Rocky Helmet or Iron Barbs can break Deoxys-A's Focus Sash or KO it after it has used its Focus Sash should it hit the switch-in with Superpower or Extreme Speed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Deoxys-A appreciates being paired with offensive Pokemon such as Keldeo and Talonflame, which can keep up offensive pressure and appreciate its ability to threaten foes like Mega Diancie. In addition, Pokemon that appreciate Choice Scarf Landorus-T removed, such as Mega Charizard Y and Mega Diancie, greatly benefit from having Deoxys-A as a partner. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan complement Deoxys-A greatly, as it appreciates the free turn that Fake Out provides. Pokemon like Keldeo have good matchups against Aegislash and Mega Kangaskhan, two of Deoxys-A's biggest threats. Keldeo not only can 2HKO Aegislash with Hydro Pump and OHKO Mega Kangaskhan with Secret Sword but also can support Deoxys-A with Quick Guard or Taunt, depending on the set, which alleviates Deoxys-A's weaknesses to priority moves or Trick Room, respectively. Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Gengar help Deoxys-A against Psychic-types such as Jirachi and Cresselia as well as opposing Aegislash.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Infernape sports a great base 108 Speed to tie with common threats, such as Terrakion, as well as beat all the Pokemon in the base 100 Speed tier, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y. It is also one of the fastest Fake Out users, outspeeding most other common users. While it is fast, Infernape still loses to the entire base 110 Speed tier, especially Mega Diancie and Mega Metagross. Its main competition comes from fast Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Keldeo, but unlike them it will beat Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Aegislash 1v1, which is incredibly useful and usually the main draw of using Infernape. Great dual STAB types in Fire and Fighting with decent Attack and Special Attack stats allow it to run a great mixed set with decent support moves. However, while it has a big offensive presence, its terrible defensive typing and lackluster bulk make it easy to take out. Anything faster than Infernape or anything that can take a hit and deal damage back will beat it soundly, as it is frail and won't survive any hit from most attackers.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Focus Sash can be used to survive a hit and retaliate after Blaze is triggered, but Life Orb is necessary for achieving Infernape's many notable KOs, while Focus Sash misses out on several. Quick Guard and Taunt can shut down Trick Room and stop priority attacks such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Fake Out from users slower than Infernape. Feint is an option in the fourth slot that gives Infernape a +2 priority attack for after its first turn on the field, which also breaks Protect or Wide Guard for its teammate.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Infernape survives few hits, so most faster threats such as Talonflame, Mega Metagross, Mega Diancie, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Latios entirely negate its offensive pressure on field.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis and Trick Room: Thunder Wave and Trick Room gets rid of the speed advantage Infernape has over a decent amount of Pokemon. Thundurus, Cresselia, and Gyarados, all common users of these moves, aren't OHKOed by Infernape and thus leave it vulnerable. Jellicent and Chandelure fear neither Close Combat nor Overheat and threaten to set up Trick Room. Cresselia can do the same, despite not resisting Overheat, thanks to its immense bulk.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Infernape struggles against bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Rotom-W, and Gyarados. Azumarill resists both of Infernape's STAB attacks and threatens to set up with Belly Drum.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Infernape's strongest attack, Overheat, is weakened by rain, and strong, Swift Swim-boosted Water-types that it can't outspeed come into play.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With Life Orb, Overheat will secure the KO on several Pokemon, such as Amoonguss and Aegislash, as well as providing a strong Fire-type STAB move that hits nonresistant Pokemon for a lot of damage. Close Combat provides great coverage on common Pokemon, notably OHKOing Mega Kangaskhan and Heatran. Protect is used to avoid taking damage and status and to give Infernape's partner time to remove the possible threats. Fake Out causes the foe to flinch or forces the foe to use Protect in order to free up a turn for Infernape's partner; it also stalls out unfavorable conditions such as Tailwind and Trick Room. Encore will lock the opponent's Pokemon into an inconvenient move, such as Protect or Fake Out, with Infernape's base 108 Speed complementing this rather nicely. Using Encore instead of Protect can be a double-edged sword, however, as without Protect Infernape can't defend itself.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>224 Special Attack EVs allow Infernape to KO foes such as Aegislash, Amoonguss, and Mega Metagross with Overheat. 252 Speed EVs with a Naive nature allow it to Speed tie with Pokemon in the base 108 Speed tier. The remaining 32 EVs are placed in Attack to OHKO Mega Kangaskhan and power up Close Combat in general. Life Orb is necessary for Infernape to get the KOes it's meant to and increases the damage on anything else it hits.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Infernape works well as a lead to support its partner with Fake Out and Encore. Infernape isn't a reliable switch-in to any attack, so it's best to use a free switch to get it in, generally meaning on turn one or immediately after a teammate has been KOed. Infernape threatens Mega Kangaskhan, Heatran, and Amoonguss all at the same time, something rarely found, which is often the main perk of using Infernape. It functions well switching in, getting a KO, and then switching back out or getting sacrificed when it's in an undesirable position.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fake Out and Encore make for great support to help partners such as Belly Drum Azumarill set up. Rock- and Electric-types help deal with the Flying-types that plague Infernape; Electric-types are especially good teammates, as they deal with Water-types as well. Mega Diancie and Thundurus are very useful for these roles; Mega Diancie's Rock-type STAB spread move Diamond Storm and Thundurus's ability to slow down threats such as Mega Metagross with Thunder Wave are invaluable. Rock-types appreciate Infernape's ability to clear out opposing Steel- and Grass-types. Rotom-W is also a good partner because it can help get rid of bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Suicune. Defensive synergy might be less important on a team with Infernape, as Fake Out and Encore support help facilitate switches with the weaker members of your team.</p> "

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon's good typing and bulk, combined with its decent movepool, allow it to be a niche check to some extremely common Pokemon in the Doubles OU metagame, including Landorus-T, Heatran, and Thundurus. Its ability Storm Drain allows Gastrodon to check rain teams and help teammates that are weak to Water-type moves avoid damage. Gastrodon's access to recovery plus its coverage movepool allow it to stay on the field many turns and deal damage to a wide variety of common threats. However, Gastrodon's very low Speed stat means it will always be moving last, and with its poor Special Attack stat, it doesn't really thrive in Trick Room; additionally, Gastrodon often relies on boosts from Storm Drain to be a real offensive threat. This lack of speed and power means that Gastrodon is threatened by strong physical attackers, such as Mega Kangaskhan, when it cannot burn them with Scald. Gastrodon also faces competition from many other Water-types, such as Swampert, which has similar typing, movepool and access to Wide Guard, and Suicune, which is bulkier and can provide speed control. Similarly, Gastrodon has to compete with other common checks to rain teams, such as Kyurem-B and Ferrothorn, which are better Pokemon overall and notably not weak to Grass-type moves from Ludicolo.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Clear Smog is an optional move to run if the team Gastrodon is on seems weak to setup Pokemon, such as Power-Up Punch Mega Kangaskhan, Quiver Dance Volcarona, and Belly Drum Azumarill. Muddy Water is an optional spread attack for Gastrodon; however, this move is weak without a boost from Storm Drain, so it is usually better to stick with Scald. Counter and Mirror Coat make good use of Gastrodon's bulk by allowing it to take an attack and send it back at the user, but by using these moves Gastrodon will have to drop a move that will usually be better because three damaging attacks are far less situational. Blizzard can be used over Ice Beam if Gastrodon is paired with Mega Abomasnow, but the power drop here is definitely noticeable. Icy Wind is another alternative to Ice Beam that provides speed control for Gastrodon's partners, but it removes Gastrodon's ability to deal big damage with its Ice-type attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Grass-type Pokemon, such as Amoonguss and Breloom, will cause a lot of trouble for Gastrodon, as they resist both of its STAB attacks, and Gastrodon is 4x weak to Grass-type attacks, so even defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss will be able to do significant damage to Gastrodon with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Gastrodon is dreadfully slow, with only a base 39 Speed, and as such it will usually be taking damage before moving. When this is combined with its average Defense, Gastrodon severely struggles with strong physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <p><strong>Sun Teams</strong>: Opposing sun teams can be a big threat to Gastrodon, as the sun weakens Gastrodon's STAB water moves and Gastrodon will easily be KOed by a Grass-type move from Mega Charizard Y or Venusaur, the two staple Pokemon on traditional sun teams.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Recover + 3 Attacks",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is Gastrodon's most reliable Water-type STAB move, hitting Fire-types like Talonflame, Volcarona, and Rotom-H. Not only does Scald provide decent power in a STAB attack, its 30% chance to burn can be a big help when facing physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan. Earth Power is Gastrodon's second STAB move, and it hits Rock-types like Mega Diancie, Steel-types like Heatran and Aegislash, and the Water-immune Fire-type Volcanion. Ice Beam provides great coverage on Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Dragon-types such as Latios and Hydreigon, which would otherwise wall Gastrodon, as well as Flying-types like Landorus and Thundurus. Recover allows Gastrodon to restore its health and stay on the field longer than other Pokemon typically would, which can be vital in late-game situations or when taking opportunities of free turns. Alternatively, Protect allows Gastrodon to avoid damage entirely for the turn while its partner handles a threat and scout out an opposing moveset.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>232 HP and 176 Defense EVs let Gastrodon take two Brave Birds from Adamant Life Orb Talonflame, which means Gastrodon can switch in on and defeat it one-on-one. The 52 Special Defense EVs, paired with the given HP EVs, give Gastrodon the ability to survive a Psycho Boost from Deoxys-A. The remaining 48 EVs go into Special Attack to allow Gastrodon to OHKO Salamence and Landorus-T with Ice Beam. A Quiet nature allows Gastrodon to be slower than Aegislash and OHKO it with Earth Power while it is in its Blade forme. This will also allow Gastrodon to outspeed opposing Pokemon on Trick Room teams. Sitrus Berry provides instant recovery of 25% of Gastrodon's health, which helps against double targets and against Mega Kangaskhan due to Parental Bond. Expert Belt allows Gastrodon to do more damage against targets that are hit super effectively, which works well in conjunction with its expansive movepool, and pick up notable OHKOs against foes such as Mega Diancie with Earth Power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Gastrodon's ability redirects all Water-type attacks to itself, so it is a great check to rain teams and helps Water weak teammates avoid taking damage, which can put foes in tough spots. Gastrodon shines by redirecting Water-type attacks and gaining Special Attack boosts, so luring a Water-type attack from your opponent with a Pokemon weak to Water and then switching in Gastrodon is a prime way to use this Pokemon. Gastrodon's bulk and typing give it the opportunity to switch in on many common Pokemon, such as Thundurus, Heatran, and Volcanion, as it will take very little damage from their attacks, and threaten them in return. Recover is great to take advantage of turns where the opponent may double Protect, not target Gastrodon, or use a stat-dropping move, such as Draco Meteor or Superpower. Keep in mind that if Gastrodon's partner uses a non-spread Water-type move, Gastrodon will redirect it too!</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gastrodon's biggest threat is any Grass-type Pokemon or move. Great Pokemon to pair with Gastrodon to threaten Grass-types like Amoonguss or Breloom are Fire-types like Heatran or Blaziken, a Flying-type like Talonflame, or an Ice-type like Kyurem-B. Putting Safety Goggles on Heatran makes it an even better Gastrodon partner, since this allows Heatran to switch into Spores from Amoonguss and Breloom. Even with all of the EVs invested into its physical bulk, Gastrodon could still use help in that area, especially due to the ever-present Mega Kangaskhan. An Intimidate Pokemon, such as Landorus-T or Scrafty, can be a big help. Gastrodon can also use Recover more often if it is taking less damage from physical attackers. Gastrodon is a great partner for Pokemon weak to Water-type attacks, such as Mega Diancie, Landorus-T, and Talonflame. This is also important on the offensive end — if Gastrodon's teammates aren't going to lure Water-type attacks, Gastrodon can't get Storm Drain boosts. Gastrodon handles Electric-types extremely well, so Pokemon that benefit from this, such as Talonflame and Gyarados, fit well with it.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Mega Lopunny gains a Fighting typing, the ability Scrappy, and a unique niche in the Doubles OU metagame. While most Mega Evolutions are designed to be powerful offensive threats, Mega Lopunny takes on a more supportive role. It uses its high Speed to disrupt its foes with Fake Out and Encore while its partner sets up or attacks. Mega Lopunny not only has the fastest Fake Out in the metagame but is also unique in being able to hit Ghost-types thanks to Scrappy, meaning it can stop Pokemon such as Jellicent and Chandelure from setting up Trick Room. Its high Attack and unresisted STAB combination thanks to Scrappy make it very threatening as well. However, Mega Lopunny has pretty bad bulk due to its low defenses and bad defensive typing, and it receives competition from Mega Kangaskhan as a Fake Out user with considerable power. Unless your team is specifically in need of a fast Encore user or has a particular weakness to Ghost-types, Mega Kangaskhan is probably a better fit.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ice Punch can be used to deal big damage to Landorus-T, but it's typically not worth carrying, because Lopunny has better options to run, and it's better to have Ice-type coverage provided by another teammate. Drain Punch is another option for a reliable Fighting-type STAB move, but is generally too weak. Power-Up Punch is an option to run alongside redirection to sweep thanks to Mega Lopunny's unresisted coverage, but this strategy is easily stopped and checked. Facade is an option to prevent Lopunny from being crippled by paralysis and burns, but has considerably less damage output than Return.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Common Intimidate users, such as Landorus-T and Gyarados, lower Mega Lopunny's Attack and are not 2HKOed by any of its STAB moves. Bulky Will-O-Wisp users such as Rotom-W can also eat up an attack from Mega Lopunny and retaliate with a burn.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Mega Lopunny does not have the best bulk, so anything that can take a hit from it and retaliate with a strong neutral or super effective attack can cripple it.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie, Azumarill, and Sylveon can guarantee an OHKO on Lopunny.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon: Psychic-type Pokemon such as Cresselia and Mega Metagross can take out Mega Lopunny with a STAB move, though some such as Latios have difficulty taking an attack from Mega Lopunny.

Return is a powerful, reliable STAB attack that does big damage. Low Kick also does big damage against threats like Mega Kangaskhan and Heatran, but it is generally unreliable due to its low damage output against lightweight foes. High Jump Kick can be used instead, as it does much more damage than Low Kick, but it has devastating recoil upon missing or mispredicting the target using Protect, which is very prevalent in the metagame. Encore can lock foes into a status move, such as Substitute or Protect, making them useless. Protect allows Lopunny to scout and stall out opposing conditions such as rain, Trick Room, and Tailwind, as well as stay safe while its partner takes care of one of its threats.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Lopunnite is required in order for Lopunny to Mega Evolve. Limber is its most useful pre-Mega Evolution ability, as it allows Lopunny to switch into Thunder Waves. Maximum Speed EVs and a Jolly nature let Mega Lopunny Speed tie with Mega Manectric and outspeed Mega Gengar. An Adamant nature could be run instead for extra power, but then Mega Lopunny loses out on outspeeding the above targets. It does, however, still outspeed Pokemon 115 base Speed and below such as Raikou, Terrakion, and Latios. Maximum Attack allows it to hit as hard as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Lopunny works best as a lead so that it can support its teammates with Fake Out and get the Speed boost from Mega Evolving as soon as possible. Lopunny also works well as a revenge killer. Fake Out is usually the best move to use on turn one, as it allows Lopunny to Mega Evolve safely and gives Lopunny's partner a free turn. If a foe uses Protect to dodge Fake Out, Encore them into it. Finally, because Mega Lopunny doesn't have good defenses, try not to switch it into any attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because Fake Out and Encore can be used to buy free turns, setup sweepers such as Belly Drum Azumarill pair well with Mega Lopunny. As the single biggest threat to Mega Lopunny is priority, Pokemon that can threaten common priority users are helpful teammates. For Talonflame you might consider Tyranitar and Rotom-W, while for Breloom you might consider a Talonflame of your own. Mega Lopunny tends to fit best on very offensive teams and relieves a lot of pressure on teammates by outspeeding and threatening many of the fastest Pokemon in the metagame, such as Darkrai, Weavile, and Mega Gengar. Because of this, a slower, powerful partner such as Sylveon also fits well as a teammate, as outspeeding threats becomes less necessary for Mega Lopunny's teammates. Lastly, Defiant and Competitive users such as Bisharp and Milotic can fend off Landorus-T, which, by virtue of Intimidate, is a natural threat to Lopunny. Bisharp in particular also resists Flying, is immune to Psychic, and beats opposing Fairies, all of which threaten Mega Lopunny, though it compounds the Fighting weakness.</p> "

However, Bronzong faces competition from Jirachi, which offers greater bulk and access to support moves such as Follow Me and Helping Hand in lieu of Bronzong's Levitate and better offensive options.

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Skill Swap is useful for weakening Pokemon that rely on their ability such as Mega Kangaskhan and works well in combination with Heatran due to Levitate. Sunny Day can be used to improve a team's rain matchup or help boost the strength of Fire-type teammates. Normal Gem strengthens Explosion but makes Bronzong less reliable at setting Trick Room. Occa Berry allows Bronzong to take a single, strong Fire-type move but is generally worse than Colbur Berry, as Bronzong can't do as much damage in return. Safeguard can be used to provide its team with sleep immunity against Amoonguss; however, it is worth noting that Amoonguss will outspeed Bronzong under Trick Room and can therefore still use Spore that turn. Stealth Rock is a niche non-attacking option that can provide chip damage for teammates as well as weaken the Fire-types that Bronzong hates. Rock Slide can surprise foes that are weak to it such as Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Volcarona, but it needs chip damage on all three to get the KO.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Heatran all resist Gyro Ball and deal large damage to or OHKO Bronzong with their STAB moves. Heatran cannot OHKO Bronzong with Heat Wave but can safely set up a Substitute against it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon such as Aegislash and Bisharp take little from Bronzong's attacks. Both can do high amounts of damage to Bronzong, with Aegislash also being able to freely Substitute up if carrying it.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Common Dark-type Pokemon such as Hoopa-U, Bisharp, and Hydreigon can OHKO Bronzong if it lacks Colbur Berry.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Ghost-types such as Jellicent and Gengar are immune to Explosion and have super effective STAB moves to use against Bronzong. Jellicent also resists Gyro Ball.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt prevents Bronzong from setting Trick Room, leaving it and its teammates vulnerable. Furthermore, common users such as Gengar and Thundurus can hit Bronzong with a super effective STAB move and resist Steel, respectively.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Gyro Ball serves as a strong, STAB Steel-type move that takes advantage of Bronzong's low Speed. Zen Headbutt allows Bronzong to deal with Fighting-types such as Keldeo, as well as Amoonguss. Explosion can be used instead to do good damage against nearly any Pokemon and allow a safe switch in for another Pokemon to take advantage of Trick Room turns. Trick Room allows slower Pokemon such as Bronzong itself to use their low Speed to move first. Protect keeps Bronzong safe while a partner can deal with a threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment with a Brave nature is used to make Bronzong's attacks as strong as possible and works well with Explosion while lowering its Speed for Gyro Ball and Trick Room. Maximum HP investment lets Bronzong usually set Trick Room at least once due to its bulk, notably allowing it to survive Aegislash's Shadow Ball. Safety Goggles provides powder move immunity so that Bronzong can set Trick Room on Amoonguss and reliably beat it if using Zen Headbutt. However, Colbur Berry can be used instead to stomach a single, strong Dark-type attack from the likes of Hydreigon, Bisharp, and Hoopa-U. Finally, an alternate spread of 252 HP / 116 Def / 140 SpD with a Relaxed nature enables Bronzong to take a Dark Pulse from Life Orb Hydreigon without Colbur Berry but comes at the cost of being far weaker offensively.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bronzong makes a good lead, as its primary role is to set Trick Room for itself and its teammates. To perform this role best, Bronzong should avoid taking too much damage before setting Trick Room, as otherwise it can be left too vulnerable to set it. Furthermore, Fake Out and redirection from teammates should be used if Bronzong is damaged or if there are Pokemon threatening it. After Trick Room is set, use Explosion to take advantage of the limited turns the best, which deals large damage and lets a threatening teammate be brought in safely. When using Explosion, use it alongside a Ghost-type or use Protect so that Bronzong does not damage your own Pokemon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bronzong appreciates Fake Out support from Pokemon such as Scrafty and Mega Kangaskhan to assist in setting Trick Room. Strong, slow attackers such as Volcanion and Sylveon can take advantage of the Trick Room that Bronzong has set. Pokemon that can deal with the Dark-types such as Hydreigon that Bronzong struggles with make good teammates, such as Conkeldurr and the aforementioned Scrafty. Amoonguss can provide redirection to help Bronzong safely set Trick Room and take advantage of the speed control to put foes to sleep with Spore before they move. Pokemon that can handle Fire-types such as Heatran, for example Gyarados and Rotom-W, are useful for supporting Bronzong. If using Explosion, Ghost-type teammates such as Jellicent are useful for switching into it without taking damage.</p> "

  "Garchomp": {
    "overview": "<p>Garchomp faces heavy competition from better Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Kyurem-B, and Latios, which have more overall utility, power, and coverage moves. As a Ground-type, Garchomp faces competition from Landorus-T, which possesses more utility. Garchomp's typing, however, gives it a resistance to Fire-type moves, which makes it more reliable against Mega Charizard Y and Heatran. Garchomp's naturally high base Speed allows it to check Mega Charizard Y without needing Choice Scarf, unlike Landorus-T. Its Dragon / Ground typing gives it nearly unresisted STAB coverage; however, Garchomp doesn't hit many Pokemon for super effective damage. It is also pretty easy to switch into Garchomp because it doesn't hit very hard without a Life Orb, and while Garchomp has excellent total coverage, quite a few Pokemon resist one of its STAB types, which makes it pretty easy to tell which one it's going to use. Moreover, it has trouble beating common defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Cresselia, and Amoonguss. Garchomp also has a really bad matchup versus common offensive threats such as Latios, offensive Thundurus, and Mega Diancie; Choice Scarf Landorus-T, however, can handle these offensive threats, and many more, relatively easily. Garchomp is also heavily crippled by Intimidate and burn. Fortunately, a good ability in Rough Skin combined with respectable bulk allows Garchomp to punish weaker contact moves, such as U-turn and Fake Out. Overall, though, Garchomp needs a lot of support to function and should really only be used over Landorus-T if you need a Pokemon that resists Fire.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Garchomp can be used on a sand team; however, there are a lot of better Mega Evolutions that can be used instead of it. Choice Scarf allows Garchomp to beat threats that it normally couldn't, such as Mega Diancie and Latios; however, Landorus-T is usually the better pick as a Choice Scarf user. Lum Berry can be used to cure Garchomp from a crippling status ailment, such as burn or sleep. Poison Jab and Iron Head allow Garchomp to hit Fairy-types, while Fire Blast lets Garchomp hit Ferrothorn. Dragon Rush is a stronger alternative to Dragon Claw, as it guarantees an OHKO on Hydreigon and Substitute Kyurem-B if Garchomp is holding Life Orb. Substitute can be used to block Will-O-Wisp. When using Substitute, Leftovers is the preferred item for Garchomp. Swords Dance turns Garchomp into a fearsome late-game sweeper, while Roar can be used to stop Trick Room setters and setup sweepers.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Garchomp is primarily a physical attacker, so Intimidate and burns will lower its damage output and cripple it immensely, turning it from a fearsome attacker to dead weight. Landorus-T and Rotom-W can easily switch into Garchomp's attacks and cripple it.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Garchomp can be removed by faster Dragon-types, such as Latios and Choice Scarf Kyurem-B.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon</strong>: Ice-types such as Weavile, Mamoswine, and Abomasnow are able to OHKO Garchomp with their Ice-type STAB moves. Pokemon that commonly carry Ice-type coverage moves for Landorus-T, such as Thundurus and Darkrai, can do the same.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir can OHKO Garchomp with their STAB moves too.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard: Wide Guard can stop Garchomp in its tracks, as its best move is a spread move. In particular, Wide Guard Aegislash can completely stop Garchomp, as it resists Garchomp's other attacks.</p> ",

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Garchomp's most reliable Ground-type STAB attack, while Dragon Claw is Garchomp's most reliable Dragon-type STAB attack. Rock Slide, along with Garchomp's other attacks, gives it near-perfect coverage; however, Stone Edge can be used, as it is stronger, bypasses Wide Guard, and ensures an OHKO on Mega Charizard Y regardless of Mega Charizard Y's bulk investment.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Garchomp's EV spread allows it to hit fast and hit hard. Rough Skin is Garchomp's preferred ability, as it allows it to deal chip damage to physical attackers. Rocky Helmet, in conjunction with Rough Skin, allows Garchomp to punish weak contact moves, such as Fake Out and U-turn. It also allows Garchomp to wear down threats, such as Mega Kangaskhan, so that Garchomp can KO them with one of its STAB attacks. Life Orb increases Garchomp's less-than-stellar damage output and can allow it to pick up KOs on Pokemon such as uninvested Hydreigon. Focus Sash allows Garchomp to beat Latios and Mega Diancie one-on-one; however, using a Focus Sash greatly hinders Garchomp's ability to switch in.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switch Garchomp in to weaker contact moves, such as Fake Out, Mach Punch, and Aqua Jet, so that the foe can take Rough Skin and potentially Rocky Helmet damage. Because Garchomp has trouble picking up KOs against most Pokemon, it works best mid- and late-game, when the foe's Pokemon and Intimidate or Will-O-Wisp users have been taken out or weakened, which Garchomp should avoid at all costs. If Garchomp is hit by Intimidate, it is recommended that you switch Garchomp out, as its damage output will plummet, causing it to be dead weight.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Intimidate users work really well with Garchomp, as they can weaken physical attackers and allow Garchomp to take more hits and deal more Rough Skin damage. Steel-types are great partners for Garchomp, as they have near-perfect synergy with it. Most notably, Aegislash and Mega Metagross benefit greatly from the removal of Fire-types such as Heatran and Mega Charizard Y and are able to switch into any Ice-, Fairy-, or Dragon-type move aimed at Garchomp. They can also force out Latios, Mega Diancie, and Kyurem-B, all of which are major threats to Garchomp. Thanks to Defiant, Bisharp deters Intimidate users from coming in, which can allow Garchomp to keep up its damage output. Grass-types, such as Breloom, greatly benefit from Garchomp's ability to remove Mega Charizard Y and Steel-types, most notably Aegislash. Breloom is able to check bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W that Garchomp struggles with; however, if using Breloom, be wary of Ice-types. Any form of speed control allows Garchomp to outrun threats such as Latios, Mega Diancie, and Terrakion and KO them with its STAB moves. Common speed control users are Tailwind Talonflame, which benefits from Garchomp's ability to remove Aegislash and Heatran, and Thunder Wave or Icy Wind Cresselia, which can also provide Helping Hand support. As with anything that uses Earthquake frequently, Pokemon that are immune to it are great partners. Garchomp works really well on sun teams. Under sun, both Mega Charizard Y and Venusaur beat bulky Water-types that Garchomp struggles with, such as Suicune and Rotom-W, and Fairy-types, such as Mega Gardevoir and Mega Diancie. Mega Charizard Y also beats Ice-types that threaten Garchomp, while Garchomp can switch into and beat Rock- and Electric-types that threaten Mega Charizard Y. In return, both Mega Charizard Y and Venusaur benefit greatly from Garchomp's ability to remove Heatran.</p> "

  "Lucario": {
    "overview": "<p>Adaptability coupled with high attacking stats makes Mega Lucario a powerful mixed attacker that is able to deal huge amounts of damage, especially with Close Combat. With its Fighting- and Steel-type STAB attacks, Mega Lucario can make quick work of the two most popular Mega Evolutions in the tier, Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Diancie. Mega Lucario also reaches a great Speed tier that lets it take advantage of its powerful attacks, beating the many base 110 Speed Pokemon as well as max Speed Thundurus. Mega Lucario's movepool is decent, lacking only an accurate, strong physical Steel-type move, which forces it to operate as a mixed attacker and holds it back against the specially defensive Fairy-types in the tier. Sadly, Mega Lucario's already low defenses seem even lower due to the necessity of running a Defense- or Special Defense-lowering nature. This makes Mega Lucario especially susceptible to priority attacks, even if they aren't super effective against it. Those low defenses also make Mega Lucario practically useless if it doesn't have the Speed advantage, as most super effective or strong neutral hits will knock it out.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Iron Tail can be used over Flash Cannon in order to OHKO Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir, but its shaky accuracy and the fact that it's weakened by Intimidate makes it a risky pick. Crunch or Dark Pulse can be used so that Ghost- and Psychic-types cannot wall Mega Lucario, but neither hits very hard without the Adaptability boost applied to many of Mega Lucario's other moves. Bullet Punch grants Mega Lucario a different priority option from Extreme Speed and gets the Adaptability boost. However, the main targets of Bullet Punch are typically better covered by the moves found in the main set. Ice Punch can catch Landorus-T on the switch in and hit Latios harder than any of Mega Lucario's other options. Feint allows Mega Lucario to break Protect, Quick Guard, or Wide Guard to allow its partner more freedom and outprioritize priority users such as Talonflame.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-Type Pokemon: Keldeo and Conkeldurr, among others, can all take any one hit from Mega Lucario and OHKO it in return with their own STAB Fighting-type moves. Conkeldurr even has Mach Punch to potentially OHKO Mega Lucario before it has a change to attack.</p> <p><strong>Fire-Type Pokemon: Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona take very little damage from Mega Lucario's STAB moves and can hit it super effectively in return, but they must be wary of Stone Edge. Volcarona even has a chance to burn Mega Lucario that target it with Close Combat due to Flame Body.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-Type Pokemon: Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir have enough special bulk to survive one Flash Cannon and OHKO Mega Lucario in return with Hyper Voice, even if Mega Lucario is behind a Substitute. Azumarill also takes any of Mega Lucario's attacks handily, and may even set up a Belly Drum, followed by an easy OHKO Mega Lucario with a +6 Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Flying-Type Pokemon: Most viable Flying-types resist Mega Lucario's STAB moves, though a Stone Edge will hurt. Talonflame is especially troublesome for Mega Lucario to face, as its Gale Wings ability allows it to move before Mega Lucario can attack, even if it carries Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash</strong>: Aegislash can shrug off any move from Mega Lucario and hit back hard with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: As Mega Lucario carries primarily physical attacks, Intimidate users such as Gyarados and Landorus-T cripple it. Burns from Will-O-Wisp users such as Gengar and Rotom-W have a similar but more permanent and damaging effect. Although Mega Lucario still hits decently hard at -1 Attack, it is nowhere near as threatening.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: As a frail Pokemon, Mega Lucario is susceptible to faster opponents such as Deoxys-A, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Blaziken with Speed boosts, all of which outspeed and OHKO it. Mega Lucario is also threatened by priority users such as Talonflame and Conkeldurr.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Any form of Speed control, be it Thunder Wave from Thundurus or Gyarados, Tailwind from Talonflame or Suicune, or Trick Room from Jellicent or Cresselia, takes away the Speed advantage that, due to its frailty, Mega Lucario absolutely needs in order to function.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Close Combat is Mega Lucario's most reliable STAB attack and hits really hard with the Adaptability boost. Although Close Combat drops Mega Lucario's defenses, the damage output is easily worth it. Flash Cannon has the benefit of ignoring any Intimidate drops that Mega Lucario may have accumulated and takes on Fairy-types that can stomach a Close Combat. Stone Edge hits Mega Charizard Y as well as Thundurus and Talonflame, all three of which resist Mega Lucario's Steel- and Fighting-type attacks. If carrying Stone Edge, Mega Lucario has the ability to outspeed and OHKO the three most common Mega Pokemon in the tier: Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Diancie, and Mega Charizard Y. Substitute can be used instead of Stone Edge to avoid status effects and Intimidate, as both are crippling to Mega Lucario's effectiveness. Once behind a Substitute, Mega Lucario also gains the ability to survive any one hit and can take advantage of the pressure applied by this buffer. Extreme Speed is also a viable alternative, allowing Mega Lucario to get around Sucker Punch or knock out a weakened priority user such as Talonflame or Thundurus. Detect allows Mega Lucario to stall out field conditions or protect itself while its partner deals with a threat. In this case, Detect is used over Protect to avoid Imprison + Protect users trying to cripple Lucario.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment along with a Naive nature is used to let Mega Lucario outrun Mega Diancie and Thundurus and at least tie with opposing Mega Lucario. 244 Attack EVs are used to guarantee that Mega Lucario can OHKO standard Mega Charizard Y and Mega Kangaskhan, even after an Intimidate drop. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack to power up Flash Cannon. A Naive nature is chosen over a Hasty one to help Mega Lucario against common priority attacks, the majority of which are physical. Inner Focus is used to allow Mega Lucario the option to defer Mega Evolution against a predicted Fake Out and subsequently do lots of damage to the Fake Out user. A more specially based spread of 132 Atk / 124 SpA / 252 Spe can be used if not carrying Stone Edge, as this is the minimum Attack investment needed to OHKO Mega Kangaskhan after an Intimidate drop. The boosted Special Attack investment also grants Mega Lucario a better chance to OHKO Mega Gardevoir with Flash Cannon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Lucario works fairly well during any stage of the game, hitting threats hard until it eventually falls. Against a predicted Fake Out, Mega Evolution should be postponed in favor of getting to move that turn, as non-Mega Lucario still has a chance to OHKO Mega Kangaskhan with Close Combat and will at least Speed tie with Mega Kangaskhan should it choose to not use Fake Out. Otherwise, Mega Lucario commonly needs to use Detect on its first turn out in order to get the Speed boost from Mega Evolving, as it will otherwise be outsped by a large number of common Pokemon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Thundurus works quite well as an offensive partner for Mega Lucario, removing threatening Flying-types such as Talonflame and Landorus-T. Bulky Thundurus sets can also prevent status and Trick Room, which could otherwise reduce Mega Lucario's effectiveness. Togekiss or Amoonguss can operate as a redirector to allow Mega Lucario to set up a Substitute should it be running the move. Togekiss also beats the Fighting-types that Mega Lucario fears as well as opposing Amoonguss, which is one of the best answers to non-Substitute Mega Lucario. Dark-types such as Darkrai, Hydreigon, and Hoopa-U can take on Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Cresselia, Aegislash, and Jellicent, many of which wall Mega Lucario. Since Landorus-T threatens Mega Lucario so much, teammates that beat it such as Gyarados and Suicune come in handy. Wide Guard support from teammates such as Aegislash is appreciated, protecting Mega Lucario from Earthquakes and Heat Waves that would otherwise take it out. Quick Guard support from Keldeo or Scrafty can also come in handy, as Mega Lucario is so frail that many priority attacks will knock it out in one hit. Quick Guard also protects from Thundurus's priority Thunder Wave. Talonflame works quite well with Mega Lucario, scaring out the Fighting-types that it hates and also removing many priority attackers and fast Pokemon. Talonflame also handles Amoonguss and Aegislash, which would otherwise wall Mega Lucario.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Mega Abomasnow has great mixed attacking stats, allowing it to serve as a good wallbreaker. Its poor defensive typing gives it seven weaknesses, including a 4x weakness to Fire, but its respectable 90 / 105 / 105 bulk means it can stand up to non-STAB super effective hits quite well. Resistances to Ground, Water, Electric, and Grass allow it to function as a good rain check. Base 30 Speed means Abomasnow is perfect for Trick Room, and its immunity to Spore is a great asset for a Trick Room attacker.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Earthquake is an option, but without the STAB boost it cannot OHKO Heatran. Wood Hammer can be used over Giga Drain with an alternative EV spread of 168 HP / 88 Atk / 252 SpA in order to OHKO Rotom-W, Jellicent, and Azumarill. Base form Abomasnow can be used with a Focus Sash and maximum Speed investment, allowing it to function well on a team with Tailwind support. Unfortunately, this set lacks the notable bulk that the Mega set benefits from, and hits weaker as well.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Abomasnow cannot take Fire-type attacks. Heatran is the main issue, as it's the most commonly seen Fire-type. Volcarona hits Abomasnow for super effective damage with both of its STAB moves and resists Abomasnow's attacks. Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y completely destroy it as well. Talonflame is a huge threat to Abomasnow, as both of its STAB moves destroy it and Brave Bird ignores speed control. Rotom-H resists both of Abomasnow's STAB moves and can OHKO it with Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types in general wall Abomasnow and should be dealt with before attempting to sweep.

Giga Drain gives Abomasnow a way to get some health back and beat Water-types such as Rotom-W, Politoed, and Mega Swampert. Abomasnow gets access to STAB priority in Ice Shard, allowing it to snipe Pokemon such as Landorus-T outside of Trick Room. Protect lets Abomasnow avoid a hit while its teammate defeats a threat or resets Trick Room.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs boost Abomasnow's natural bulk greatly and 252 Special Attack EVs give Blizzard and Giga Drain maximum power. 0 Speed IVs with a Quiet nature ensure that Abomasnow can take full advantage of Trick Room, and the 4 spare EVs are placed into Attack to boost the power of Ice Shard. Snow Warning is preferred over Soundproof, as although Soundproof gives Abomasnow the most hail turns, it means Abomasnow can't reliably switch into rain until it Mega Evolves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Snow Warning will activate again upon Mega Evolution, so finding the right moment to Mega Evolve can be the key to winning weather wars. Abomasnow works well early-game as a way to soften up walls and late-game as a finisher once its threats are removed. It also likes a clean switch in, as its lower bulk before Mega Evolving makes it risky to come in directly. Be wary of Wide Guard, as it leaves Abomasnow very open to attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Trick Room support is needed for this set to meet its full potential. Chandelure is a great teammate, as it can switch in to Fire-type attacks and set up Trick Room, as well as beat Steel- and Ice-types. Cresselia has the bulk to take attacks aimed at Abomasnow and can boost Abomasnow's Blizzards with Helping Hand. Reuniclus is immune to both hail and Spore thanks to Overcoat, can set up Trick Room, and forms a dual counter to Amoonguss, a big threat in Trick Room. Diancie can set up Trick Room, beat Talonflame, and put a huge dent in Heatran. Talonflame can beat Fighting-types for Abomasnow, and its Gale Wings Brave Bird bypasses Trick Room, so Talonflame isn't held back by it. Heatran walls Steel-types and also has Flash Fire to take Fire-type attacks for Abomasnow. Water-types are required to beat Fire-types; Jellicent can set Trick Room, while Rotom-W beats Heatran and Flying-types. Keldeo can switch in on a lot of moves Abomasnow is weak to and provides Quick Guard to block priority attacks aimed at Abomasnow. Greninja, Genesect, and Kyurem can all use Blizzard well to take advantage of hail, and they also function well outside of Trick Room.</p> "

Unlike most other physical attackers in Doubles OU, Weavile's access to Ice-type STAB moves, in the form of Ice Shard or Icicle Crash, gives it a phenomenal matchup against Landorus-T.

Lacking Life Orb also results in Weavile's STAB moves being rather weak in comparison to those of other hard hitters in the metagame.

Fighting-type coverage easily threatens to KO Weavile and, in the case of Kangaskhan's Power-Up Punch, breaks through Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon Weavile also lacks the ability to hit Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Diancie, both of which can OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon While Weavile is fast, opposing Choice Scarf users, such as Landorus-T and Kyurem-B, can threaten to outspeed and KO it. Deoxys naturally outruns Weavile and hit hard with Superpower. Without Protect, Weavile also lacks the ability to defensively position against threats faster than it.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Being a physical attacker, Weavile is heavily crippled by Intimidate from threats such as Scrafty and Landorus-T and being burned by Will-O-Wisp from, for instance, Rotom-W.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Not running Protect leaves Weavile vulnerable to opposing speed control effects, such as Trick Room and Tailwind. Being in a situation where Weavile moves after the foe exposes its frailness, leaving it vulnerable to being KOed. While Weavile does have priority attacks, they lack the damage output of Weavile's other STAB moves. Thunder Wave also takes away its Speed advantage, limiting its usefulness.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Fake Out",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Weavile possesses the fastest Fake Out in the Doubles metagame, outspeeding other Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan and Infernape, giving Weavile an offensive advantage over these threats. In addition, its high Speed also lets it outspeed most opposing users of Quick Guard and Wide Guard, which have equal priority to Fake Out. Knock Off lets Weavile hit Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Gengar as well as Psychic-types such as Cresselia. It has the added bonus of removing the foe's item, making it difficult to switch into and also potentially clearing Safety Goggles for sleep users. For example, Keldeo, one of Weavile's strongest counters, will be hesitant to switch into a Knock Off and lose its Life Orb. Icicle Crash lets Weavile check Dragon-types such as Hydreigon while also hitting Grass-types for significant damage. In addition, the move's 30% flinch chance combined with Weavile's high Speed gives it a potential out even for its worst matchups. For its remaining slot, Weavile has many options, ranging from Ice Shard for priority damage to Feint, which takes advantage of Fake Out pressure to punish Protect and supplement a partner's offensive pressure, to Low Kick, which can also be run over Icicle Crash, for covering Steel-types while also hitting Kangaskhan. In addition, Weavile can use Protect to help itself position while its partner takes out a foe or to stall out field conditions such as rain, Tailwind, and Trick Room.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Weavile's EVs maximize Attack and Speed, letting it outspeed important threats in the base 110 Speed tier, such as Mega Diancie and Latios, as well as faster threats such as offensive Thundurus and Serperior. Focus Sash alleviates Weavile's multiple weaknesses and frailness by allowing it to take two hits instead of one, whereas Life Orb adds to Weavile's damage output, giving Knock Off a chance to OHKO Aegislash and Fake Out + Ice Shard a chance to KO Landorus-T. While Pressure's PP-lowering ability isn't typically very useful, it allows Weavile to scout opposing Pokemon with similar abilities such as Intimidate, Teravolt, and Mold Breaker for Choice Scarves—Pokemon faster than Weavile with said abilities will have their ability announced first. Pickpocket can be used to steal an item such as opposing Life Orb or Choice Scarf when Focus Sash is used up, but note that it should only be used with a Focus Sash.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Weavile to remove threats such as Aegislash and Latios offensively, clearing the way for a partner. Fake Out should be used to help a partner set up, such as Volcarona with Quiver Dance or Azumarill with Belly Drum, or provide offensive pressure for partners that enjoy Fake Out support, which most often is most convenient at the onset of a battle. Be wary of opponents using Weavile's Fake Out as an opportunity for free switches; in some scenarios, simply attacking can be a much better option. When necessary, switching Weavile out to refresh Fake Out later, especially when it is threatened or lacks the ability to damage foes, can allow it to impact the game later. Avoid using Weavile as a switch-in, as it lacks meaningful resistances and switching it in on attacks will break its Focus Sash.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fairy-types such as Azumarill, Mega Diancie, and Mega Gardevoir, which struggle against Steel-types, appreciate Weavile clearing such threats for them. Pokemon that utilize Fake Out support to take the opportunity to set up, such as Azumarill and Kangaskhan, appreciate Weavile's ability to facilitate a free turn. Weavile itself appreciates partners that deal with opposing Fire-types well, such as Keldeo and Landorus-T. The offensive potential of Fake Out and Feint works best with offense-centric teams; hard hitters such as Deoxys-A and Mega Charizard Y appreciate free turns and Weavile's ability to break Protect and Wide Guard, respectively.</p> "

  "Rhyperior": {
    "overview": "<p>Sky-high attack with strong STAB moves and a decent support ability in Lightning Rod allow Rhyperior to deal tons of damage to common metagame threats such as Mega Diancie, Heatran, and Bisharp, as well as protect its teammates from Thunder Wave and Electric-type attacks. Access to a plethora of good coverage moves in addition to two STAB moves with great neutral coverage also allows Rhyperior to take advantage of its high Attack and Trick Room with its power. A Speed stat of 40 makes Rhyperior an asset to Trick Room teams or teams needing a check to Trick Room, as it underspeeds common Trick Room threats like Aegislash, although it is still undersped by other threats such as Amoonguss and Ferrothorn and its low Speed leaves it susceptible to attacks and burns when Trick Room is not set. Rhyperior is also held back by its low Special Defense stat, which leaves it weak against many special attackers, especially Water- and Grass-types like Keldeo, Venusaur, and Rotom-W. Aside from this, Rhyperior faces direct competition from Rhydon as a Lightning Rod user, which is bulkier while holding an Eviolite and thus able to support its teammates more consistently. Rhyperior is a better pick over Rhydon for teams that need something with offensive presence, and it is also able to hold a wider range of items.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Megahorn allows Rhyperior to hit Latios, Hydreigon, and Cresselia for more than any other move, but its other coverage options tend to be more useful. Fire Punch can work if Rhyperior's team really struggles with Ferrothorn, as it hits Ferrothorn harder than any other move. Rock Blast can be an option to hit Substitute users and Pokemon equipped with a Focus Sash, but Stone Edge usually does more damage as a single-target Rock-type move and Rock Slide is more accurate. Weakness Policy can be an option, as +2 Rhyperior does crazy amounts of damage, and Rhyperior can afford to take even some super effective physical attacks with its high defense. Life Orb, however, provides more consistent damage output. Solid Rock can be used over Lightning Rod to provide Rhyperior with some more bulk, but it should only really be considered on full Trick Room teams that don't mind paralysis and can thus afford to lose the Electric-type redirection. Also, if the team in question is in need of a bulkier version of Lightning Rod Rhyperior, using Rhydon is typically preferable to using Solid Rock Rhyperior. Rhyperior can run an Adamant nature with an EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe on teams with Tailwind, as it prevents Thunder Wave and outspeeds positive-natured base 110 Speed Pokemon and below with the Tailwind boost, but using that spread prevents Rhyperior from capitalizing on its high defensive stats.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Water-type Pokemon such as Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Suicune can simply hit at its meager Special Defense and OHKO with Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Venusaur, and Ferrothorn can hit Rhyperior hard with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Fighting-type Pokemon such as Keldeo, Terrakion, and Conkeldurr can deal significant damage with their STAB moves. Rhyperior can take a hit most of the time due to its high physical Defense, however.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Landorus-T and Landorus can dish out strong damage with their STAB attacks, the latter capable of OHKOing due to capitalizing on Rhyperior's inferior Special Defense.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: As with all physical attackers, Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp will prevent Rhyperior from pressuring the opponent as effectively. Common Intimidate users include Landorus-T and Gyarados, while Will-O-Wisp users include Gengar and Rotom formes.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Rhyperior's low Special Defense stat leaves it susceptible to strong special attackers, with even neutral attacks doing lots of damage. Some examples include Sylveon, Mega Gardevoir, and Hydreigon.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: If Trick Room is not set, Rhyperior will get outsped by the majority of the metagame, and although it's bulky, Rhyperior is easily broken down by faster attacks. Other threats to its success include Pokemon that underspeed Rhyperior under Trick Room like Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Mega Abomasnow.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Rhyperior's primary STAB move and has the perks of hitting both opponents, although it also targets Rhyperior's ally. Drill Run works well for getting around teams that use Wide Guard to protect from Earthquake and is also useful on teams with few Ground-type immunities. Stone Edge is a strong secondary STAB option for single-target attacking and hits Flying-types that avoid Earthquake like Thundurus for super effective damage. Rock Slide is another option for Rock-type STAB that hits both opponents and has a decent chance to cause the foe to flinch when Trick Room is up. Rock Slide is usually preferable to Stone Edge when running Drill Run in order to maintain access to a move with spread damage. Ice Punch is primarily for Landorus-T, which is KOed even after Intimidate. Hammer Arm is also an option to do more damage to Mega Kangaskhan and Ferrothorn. Substitute is another good option for Rhyperior, allowing it to avoid burns or to survive any one hit and retaliate. If neither extra coverage nor Substitute is optimal for Rhyperior's team, it can run dual STAB moves in Rock Slide and Stone Edge or Earthquake and Drill Run, leaving it more flexible with one of its attacking types.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Lightning Rod allows Rhyperior to protect its teammates from any Electric-type moves, providing them useful turns of setup or time to attack. The listed EVs and nature allow Rhyperior to hit as hard as possible with the most bulk possible. A Brave nature is chosen over Adamant for Rhyperior to be more effective under Trick Room, either its own or against opposing Trick Room teams. 0 Speed EVs further improve Rhyperior's effectiveness under Trick Room. Life Orb allows Rhyperior to hit harder, granting it OHKOs against threats like Landorus-T with Ice Punch.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rhyperior's main goal is to take advantage of Trick Room turns by doing lots of damage to the opposing team. If not being used on a Trick Room team, Rhyperior performs similarly due to its reliance on speed control, although it is not completely restricted to being effective during turns with Trick Room set. In this case, Rhyperior's main draw is in Lightning Rod, and it should switch in to protect an ally from Electric-type attacks and Thunder Wave, or cleanly after a teammate falls so as to avoid taking too much damage. If Rhyperior is being used with a teammate that has an Electric-type move, either switch Rhyperior out so that its teammate can attack normally or be sure not to use the Electric-type move, as it will be redirected. Avoid letting Rhyperior take too much damage or trying to use it too much outside of Trick Room, as it will get worn down to the point where it can't be nearly as effective, especially when combined with Life Orb recoil. Be careful with Ground-type STAB moves against Aegislash, as Earthquake is blocked by Wide Guard and Drill Run makes contact, meaning that King's Shield will drop Rhyperior's Attack by two stages. If Rhyperior has Substitute, set one up on a predicted Protect, switch, or slower status move to allow it to still be effective outside Trick Room. However, don't be reckless when setting up a Substitute, as the damage taken in addition to Life Orb damage can whittle Rhyperior down quickly. Avoid Intimidate users and getting hit by Will-O-Wisp, as either will hinder its effectiveness. If running Substitute, setting one up can block both Will-O-Wisp and Intimidate. If Rhyperior is at -1 or -2 Attack due to Intimidate, try to switch it out so that it can be more effective later on in the match. Rhyperior works well either in the mid-game as a wallbreaker or in the endgame as a cleaner, depending on the opponent's team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Trick Room setters like Cresselia, Jellicent, and Gourgeist-XL help Rhyperior fix its Speed issue, and Rhyperior in turn takes care of Aegislash and Bisharp, common threats to these Trick Room setters and others. Any Pokemon that work well on Trick Room but need Heatran removed, like Aegislash, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn, appreciate Rhyperior's presence. Amoonguss and Ferrothorn get a special mention for beating the bulky Water-types that plague Rhyperior. All of those are also good examples of something to soak up Water- and Grass-type attacks, which is necessary to support Rhyperior. Rhyperior works well with Trick Room attackers that struggle with Steel-types and need them removed, like Hoopa-U, Azumarill, and Mega Abomasnow. Azumarill stands out in this category, as Rhyperior provides it safety against Electric-type attacks, allowing Azumarill to set up more easily. Redirectors allow Rhyperior some peace of mind when attacking, among which Amoonguss stands out since it takes Grass- and Water-type attacks quite well. Ground-immune Pokemon of some sort are required to be able to take full advantage of Earthquake; some good choices include the aforementioned Cresselia as well as Talonflame or Mega Charizard Y to beat Grass-types. Defiant or Competitive users like Bisharp and Milotic can discourage Intimidate, thus preventing Rhyperior from having its offenses neutered. Rhyperior checks Talonflame really well, so partners that appreciate its removal like Venusaur and Keldeo work well with Rhyperior on their side. Similarly, Rhyperior checks Thundurus and other Thunder Wave users by preventing them from spreading status. Thus, any quicker Pokemon that need to avoid paralysis like Blaziken and Quiver Dance Volcarona work well as partners.</p> "

  "Togekiss": {
    "overview": "<p>With its great bulk and strong supportive movepool, Togekiss works as a solid option to help the rest of its team shine. Primarily used for its access to Follow Me, Togekiss also has access to multiple methods of speed control that can be used in order to further support its partner, with its niche over other redirectors found in its access to Tailwind. These forms of speed control are especially useful to Togekiss given that its ability Serene Grace grants it the ability to cause its foe to flinch more than half the time, provided it moves first. Not only that, but Togekiss is alone among the redirectors in being immune to Ground-type attacks. Its typing also provides it the ability to take Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-type moves with ease, all of which are common attacking types. However, as a defensively oriented Pokemon, Togekiss fails to provide much offensive pressure. Togekiss also faces lots of competition from other redirectors like Amoonguss, Jirachi, and Clefable, each of which has its own niche.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Protect allows Togekiss to scout for attacks and determine whether redirection is needed. However, Togekiss struggles to find room for the move on its moveset. Leftovers provides gradual recovery that adds up to more health than a Sitrus Berry if Togekiss is on the field for more than four turns, but Doubles is a fast-paced metagame and Togekiss usually won't be out for that long. Leftovers also fails to provide the boost of recovery that may be needed for Togekiss to survive two attacks in a crucial turn. Safeguard and Heal Bell are options for Togekiss to prevent or heal status effects such as burn, paralysis, and sleep, but they are much more situational than the options listed on the main set, and Togekiss can already redirect status moves away from its partner with Follow Me. Charm lets Togekiss lower a foe's Attack severely, opening up the ability to redirect its attacks more safely. However, if that foe switches out, the drops are removed anyway, and if Togekiss's goal is to redirect more attacks, Roost is generally more helpful. Rocky Helmet allows Togekiss to act as a soft check to physical attackers like Mega Kangaskhan and Talonflame by providing chip damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Rock-type Pokemon such as Terrakion and Mega Diancie can maul Togekiss with their STAB moves while handily taking an Air Slash.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types such as Bisharp and Mega Metagross can deal massive damage to Togekiss with Iron Head. Aegislash can also hit Togekiss with Flash Cannon but it hits Togekiss at its much higher Special Defense.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Thundurus resist Air Slash and can deal significant damage with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon: Ice-types such as Kyurem-B and Weavile can threaten Togekiss with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Without the ability to go first, Togekiss can't get Serene Grace flinches and is much less threatening. Thus, all forms of speed control weaken Togekiss's disruptive capabilities. Trick Room teams also hurt Togekiss's effectiveness, as they often have multiple spread attackers. However, Togekiss can try for flinches with Air Slash to prevent Trick Room from being set.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Substitute</strong>: Taunt users such as Thundurus and Gengar can prevent Togekiss from using Follow Me or any of its many other support options, limiting it to only one move. Both also threaten Togekiss with STAB super effective attacks. Substitute users such as Kyurem-B and Heatran can freely set up on Togekiss that lack Encore and can attack both Togekiss and its partner from behind their Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Spread Attacks: Attackers with spread moves like Heat Wave and Rock Slide make Togekiss's primary purpose as a redirector ineffective. Some relevant examples include Landorus-T and Mega Charizard Y.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Follow Me",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Air Slash is Togekiss's best attacking option, as it gets a STAB boost and, with Serene Grace, has a 57% chance to cause a slower target to flinch, factoring in accuracy. Follow Me allows Togekiss to give its partner a free turn to attack or set up safely, without fear. Tailwind and Thunder Wave are Togekiss's options for speed control, either of which allows it to support the team as well as outspeed more foes. Tailwind is unique to Togekiss as a redirector and supports Togekiss's whole side. However, unlike Thunder Wave, it isn't permanent and doesn't have the additional chance to prevent the foe from moving. Thunder Wave should be used to check specific threats for the full game, whereas Tailwind supports the entirety of the team for its limited duration. Encore locks a foe into innocuous moves such as Protect and Fake Out, leaving them unable to hurt Togekiss or its partner. It also goes through Substitute, which can prevent common users like Heatran and Aegislash from being effective in battle. Roost allows Togekiss to stick around longer by providing reliable recovery, whereas Helping Hand takes a more offensive approach and can turn Togekiss's partner's attacks from 3HKOs to 2HKOs and 2HKOs to OHKOs in the right situation.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The listed HP and Defense EVs allow Togekiss to survive a Life Orb Bisharp's Iron Head, letting it redirect the move once from full HP. 60 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T under Tailwind, with the remainder placed in Special Defense for extra bulk. Togekiss's decent base 120 Special Attack means that Air Slash still hits decently hard without investment. Equipping Safety Goggles allows Togekiss to safely redirect Spore from Amoonguss or Breloom, as well as ignore the effects of Rage Powder, making it a perfect answer to both, as Togekiss resists their STAB attacks and can hit them back with a super effective Air Slash. Sitrus Berry is another option and provides Togekiss with an extra HP buffer to survive more hits. This is especially important for turns where Togekiss needs to take two strong attacks for its partner. If using Thunder Wave over Tailwind, you can move the Speed EVs to Special Defense to allow Togekiss to survive a Life Orb Aegislash's Flash Cannon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Togekiss's goal is to be a disrupter or supporter in whatever way best aids its team. There are many different ways to accomplish this: Follow Me, Air Slash flinches, speed control, and either Encore or Helping Hand, depending on the chosen moveset. Try to avoid switching Togekiss in on any strong neutral or super effective attacks—a healthier Togekiss is a much more effective user of Follow Me. Use Follow Me to help Togekiss's partner when it is threatened to give it a chance to either set up or attack. For Togekiss, outspeeding opposing Pokemon is especially useful, granting it a good chance to immobilize them with Air Slash. Thus, setting some form of speed control in either Tailwind or Thunder Wave before attacking is usually a good idea, as getting a flinch with Air Slash can really help generate momentum for Togekiss's team. However, remember that Air Slash flinches are not guaranteed and shouldn't be treated as such. Use Helping Hand if Togekiss's partner is reasonably safe to attack and the boost is absolutely necessary to get the KO. Helping Hand is usually the best option on a turn where Togekiss will likely be outsped and KOed, as its +5 priority provides Togekiss a last-ditch way to support its teammate.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Togekiss partners well with many different Pokemon in the metagame. Notable options include setup Pokemon, especially ones that appreciate speed control like Mega Kangaskhan, Substitute Heatran, and Substitute Kyurem-B. All Pokemon that don't share Togekiss's weaknesses and have lots of offensive presence to make up for Togekiss's lack thereof make for good teammates, especially if they appreciate the speed control it provides. Some examples that fall into this category are Breloom and Hoopa-U. Wide Guard users such as Aegislash protect Togekiss from Rock Slide and Icy Wind as well as discourage spread moves that Togekiss cannot redirect. Togekiss operates best alongside a teammate with the ability to beat Rock-, Steel-, Electric-, and Poison-types that threaten Togekiss out, so Pokemon with Ground-type attacks like Landorus-T, Heatran, Kyurem-B, and Rhyperior are great. Earthquake users such as Landorus-T and Rhyperior get a special mention because Togekiss avoids Earthquake. Pokemon with Intimidate make it easier for Togekiss to do its job redirecting attacks by weakening the incoming physical attacks, so again, Landorus-T works very well beside Togekiss.</p> "

  "Mamoswine": {
    "overview": "<p>In theory, Mamoswine seems to be a Pokemon that is severely underused in the Doubles OU metagame thanks to its great Attack stat and solid Ice- and Ground-type coverage allowing it to OHKO several common Pokemon in the metagame, such as Heatran, Bisharp, Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Amoonguss. In reality, however, its mediocre Speed makes it reliant on speed control, Mamoswine's typing doesn't allow it to switch into many Pokemon and makes it weak to a lot of common types, such as Fighting, Water, and Fire, and Mamoswine faces competition from the likes of Kyurem-B and Landorus-T as an Ice-type and Ground-type, respectively, both of which offer significantly more in terms of coverage and utility.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mamoswine can make use of a Choice Scarf in order to function as a pseudo-Landorus-T on teams that struggle with Defiant Pokemon; however, the lack of damage output and pivoting ability really makes Mamoswine struggle in this role. Knock Off is an alternative support move that can allow Mamoswine to cripple defensive threats by removing their Sitrus Berry or Leftovers. Stealth Rock can cripple opposing Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Focus Sash users.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Intimidate users, such as Scrafty and Gyarados, can switch in, lower Mamoswine's Attack, and then force it out with their STAB options. Sableye can cripple Mamoswine with its Prankster Will-O-Wisp, moving even before the Choice Scarf set.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Rotom-W, don't mind taking a hit from Mamoswine and can force it out with their STAB options. Aqua Jet from Azumarill snipes Mamoswine for good damage. Volcanion, though weak to Earthquake, can tank a hit and OHKO back with Steam Eruption.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Faster Fighting-types, such as Keldeo and Terrakion, can force Mamoswine out with their Fighting-type STAB moves. Mach Punch from Breloom and Conkeldurr can deal massive damage to Mamoswine.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: One of the best ways to beat Mamoswine is to use Pokemon are faster than it to take advantage of Mamoswine's terrible bulk and defensive typing and OHKO it before it can use its powerful STAB options. Deoxys-A can outspeed Choice Scarf Mamoswine and OHKO it with Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard: Wide Guard from Pokemon such as Aegislash can completely stop Mamoswine in its tracks by stopping Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind and Trick Room: Tailwind can allow Pokemon that Mamoswine normally outspeeds, such as Breloom and Bisharp, to outspeed it and OHKO it instead. The same can be said for Trick Room, which turns the fact that Mamoswine can outspeed those threats into a disadvantage.</p> ",

        "name": "Physical Attacker Gone Wrong",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake has great synergy with Mamoswine's Ice-type STAB options by giving Mamoswine the ability to hit Fire- and Steel-types super effectively. Ice Shard can help mitigate Mamoswine's low Speed by allowing it to snipe and deal pretty decent damage to faster threats to it, such as Landorus-T and Deoxys-A. Icicle Crash can be used should Mamoswine want a more reliable Ice-type STAB move. Icicle Spear is another option, as it allows Mamoswine to KO opposing Focus Sash users, such as Breloom. Alternatively, Superpower allows Mamoswine to hit Ferrothorn and Mega Kangaskhan super effectively. Protect allows Mamoswine to scout or guard it from a super effective hit that would most likely OHKO it due to its mediocre bulk.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack EVs with an Adamant nature ensure that Mamoswine has maximum damage output. Maximum Speed EVs allow Mamoswine to outrun Adamant Bisharp, Adamant Breloom, and most fast Heatran; however, a Jolly nature can be used to ensure that Mamoswine will outrun all Breloom and Heatran. Because of this, Jolly Mamoswine should use Icicle Spear in the third moveslot to OHKO Breloom through its Focus Sash. Should Mamoswine choose to run Life Orb, 29 HP IVs optimize Mamoswine's HP for Life Orb. Thick Fat is the chosen ability because it allows Mamoswine to tank Fire-type moves such as Heatran's Heat Wave. Focus Sash is preferred, as it can allow Mamoswine to tank a hit and OHKO a Pokemon that would normally threaten Life Orb Mamoswine, such as Terrakion. Life Orb, however, is an option because it further increases Mamoswine's damage output, such as allowing it to OHKO standard Amoonguss with Icicle Crash and standard Kangaskhan with Superpower. Mamoswine also does not mind the Life Orb recoil, as its defenses are bad to begin with.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to Mamoswine's low defenses and terrible defensive typing, it isn't recommended to switch it into attacks except for weaker spread attacks, such as Rock Slide. Speed control is greatly appreciated, as it can allow Mamoswine to utilize its good coverage options. Ice Shard should be used when Mamoswine is facing a frail, fast threat, such as Deoxys-A. Mamoswine is a bit hard to switch in, so it is best to set the field in favorable conditions for Mamoswine, such as by baiting in Pokemon that can't beat Mamoswine such as Thundurus and Amoonguss, having a good support partner, or setting up speed control, so that it can pressure your opponent's team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y is a great teammate for Mamoswine, as it resists all of Mamoswine's weaknesses except for Water, which is weakened under Drought anyway. Speed control users are generally great partners for Mamoswine. Togekiss can redirect Fighting- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Mamoswine while also providing crucial Tailwind support. Talonflame is a more offensive Pokemon with access to Tailwind; it checks Steel-types that threaten Mamoswine while Mamoswine can check opposing Rock-types and Heatran, which is the one Steel-type Talonflame loses to. Thundurus can provide needed Thunder Wave support and has Thunderbolt to hit bulky Water-types that Mamoswine has trouble hitting. Aegislash checks Terrakion and Mega Metagross, both of which are huge threats to Mamoswine, and has access to Wide Guard to protect itself from Mamoswine's Earthquake. Mamoswine, in turn, can check Pokemon that threaten Aegislash, such as Bisharp, Heatran, and Landorus-T. Pokemon that can beat bulky Water-types, especially Rotom-W, are great partners for Mamoswine. Venusaur, a common Pokemon on sun teams, can help in that sense while also providing coverage against Grass-types.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-H's claim to fame is its Electric / Fire typing, which, combined with Levitate, allows it to check many of Doubles OU's top threats, including Landorus-T, Mega Charizard Y, Aegislash, Mega Metagross, Amoonguss, Venusaur, and Thundurus. Its ability to beat the popular sun core of Mega Charizard Y and Venusaur is especially useful, as it makes Rotom-H a hard stop to sun teams. However, it is weak to the common Rock- and Water-types in the tier, such as Keldeo, Mega Diancie, and Terrakion. In addition to this, Rotom-H must be used with care, as its only Fire-type STAB attack drops its Special Attack and it can be easily worn down to a point where it cannot properly check the Pokemon it is supposed to.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>It can be useful to invest 220 Speed EVs with a neutral nature in order to outspeed and subsequently burn or outright OHKO Breloom and Bisharp. Rotom-H can utilize a Choice Scarf set with Trick, Thunderbolt, Overheat, and Hidden Power Ice to beat a lot of bulky Pokemon such as Calm Mind Cresselia. If you do use a Choice Scarf set, the surprise factor of Rotom-H having Choice Scarf is the most important aspect, as once it's gone, Rotom-H is not very useful. Moreover, Rotom-W is usually better than Rotom-H at this role. While niche, Rotom-H can run a Rest + Chesto Berry set to bolster its longevity and still be able to switch into Spore or Sleep Powder. It can run Volt Switch in order to maintain momentum, but it is hard to justify using over Thunderbolt or Will-O-Wisp. Rotom-H can also utilize a Life Orb set in order to hit a lot harder, being able to OHKO standard Aegislash and Mega Charizard Y with Overheat and Thunderbolt, respectively. Electroweb is an option for speed control; however, Thunder Wave is usually better.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Latias can easily switch into anything Rotom-H has and wall it, although they should be wary of a potential Thunder Wave, which would cripple them. Kyurem-B can take any hit from Rotom-H, set up a Substitute, and KO with Teravolt Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Water- and Rock-types that outspeed Rotom-H such as Keldeo and Mega Diancie can be an especially big problem because they can deal major damage or even threaten to OHKO Rotom-H before it can move.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Rain teams basically render Rotom-H useless. Additionally, although sand isn't a very viable playstyle, most Pokemon commonly used on sand teams such as Tyranitar easily beat Rotom-H.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Overheat is needed to beat the Pokemon that Rotom-H should switch in on such as Venusaur. However, you should be careful when using it because the Special Attack drops usually force Rotom-H to switch out. Thunderbolt should be used most of the time because, unlike Overheat, Rotom-H can use it multiple times without lowering its Special Attack. It allows Rotom-H to check most Flying-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame and can also be used to hit Water-types that threaten Rotom-H such as Keldeo and Suicune on the predicted switch. Will-O-Wisp lets Rotom-H cripple physical attackers, greatly adding to its utility and durability. However, Thunder Wave is a solid alternative if your team requires speed control and is well prepared for physical attackers. Protect lets Rotom-H scout its foe's moves and can help its partner safely switch or deal with another Pokemon that threatens Rotom-H.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Safety Goggles lets Rotom-H absorb Spore and Sleep Powder, allowing it to safely switch into common sleep inducers such as Amoonguss and Venusaur. If your team can easily deal with them already, Sitrus Berry is an option in order to give Rotom-H more longevity. Levitate removes Rotom-H's weakness to Ground-type moves. Be wary of Kyurem-B though, as it carries Teravolt to negate Levitate's effect, allowing it to easily OHKO Rotom-H with Earth Power. 252 HP EVs give Rotom-H as much bulk as possible both physically and specially. 156 Defense EVs guarantee that Rotom-H will always survive Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge and Mega Diancie's Diamond Storm. Choice Scarf Landorus-T's Rock Slide will also never 2HKO Rotom-H, so it gets an easy opportunity to burn Landorus-T with Will-O-Wisp. 76 Special Defense EVs guarantee that Rotom-H will not be OHKOed by Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and will not be 2HKOed by Aegislash's Shadow Ball. The remaining 24 EVs are dropped into Special Attack for a bit of power; however, if your team has Tailwind support, it is recommended to put 12 of the 24 EVs into Speed to outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T and burn it with Will-O-Wisp before it gets a chance to use a move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-H's is best used as a pivot that can switch in on attacks that don't threaten it and scare out the Pokemon it checks or counters. Be careful about switching in, though, as Rotom-H has no reliable recovery, so it can be worn down pretty quickly. Use Overheat very sparingly because once Rotom-H's Special Attack is dropped, it has no offensive presence whatsoever and is forced to switch or spread status ailments. Rotom-H isn't that great of a Pokemon, as its only niche is being able to hard counter sun teams, particularly Mega Charizard Y and Venusaur.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Wide Guard support from Pokemon such as Aegislash is very useful to avoid Rock Slide. Grass-types such as Amoonguss can beat the Rock- and Water-types that threaten Rotom-H and can also help a lot against rain teams, which Rotom-H is dead weight against. Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion complement Rotom-H very well because they can deal with Kyurem-B, Hydreigon, and various Rock-types while Rotom-H can deal with Talonflame and other Flying-types that check them. Dragon-types such as Latios help a lot against rain teams and appreciate Rotom-H's ability to handle Steel-types. Rotom-H easily fits into a Fire / Water / Grass core with other bulky Pokemon such as Gyarados and Ferrothorn.</p> "

Its outstanding defensive typing with Levitate leaves it with just a single weakness and several resistances to common attacking types. This allows Rotom-W to be a fantastic check to top-tier threats such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Landorus-T. Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are great assets, as both can cripple giant portions of the metagame. Unfortunately for Rotom-W, its HP and Speed stats are rather lackluster, and faster wallbreakers, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Latios, can easily break through it. Its offensive coverage is also walled by most Grass- and Dragon-types.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rotom-W can run Electroweb alongside Will-O-Wisp to offer both speed control and burn support, and with 56 Speed EVs, it can outspeed -1 Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y. However, outside of that, Thunder Wave is the more consistent option. Light Screen is an option if Rotom-W's team is weaker on the specially defensive side. Choice Specs Rotom-W can deal surprising damage to some switch-ins.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Lum Berry Ferrothorn is a fantastic answer to Rotom-W as it shrugs off every attack Rotom-W offers. Amoonguss is also a major pain because it redirects and tanks everything Rotom-W uses. Other Grass-types, such as Venusaur, can outspeed Rotom-W and threaten it with their STAB moves, but they must avoid switching in on Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Dragon-types such as Latios, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon also beat Rotom-W, but they must be wary of Thunder Wave. Kyurem-B completely walls Rotom-W, can easily set up a Substitute and deal massive damage with Teravolt Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Several Pokemon can strike through Rotom-W's average defenses and deal huge damage with their STAB attacks. Mega Kangaskhan, Deoxys-A, and Terrakion can KO it with their STAB attacks after only a little prior damage, but they must find a way to switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Substitute: Taunt users such as Thundurus and Sableye can stop Rotom-W from supporting its team with status.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This is by far Rotom-W's most consistent set, doing an amazing job at checking or countering various threats in DOU. Hydro Pump is a solid STAB move that allows Rotom-W to score OHKOs on Landorus-T, Mega Diancie, and offensive variants of Heatran. Thunderbolt is usually used to hit Water-types that resist Hydro Pump as well as Pokemon which take roughly equal damage from both attacks, as it is also more reliable than Hydro Pump due to its better accuracy. Will-O-Wisp is a great way to deal with physical attackers, allowing Rotom-W to check Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Metagross among others. It also gives Rotom-W a way to punish its most common switch-in, Amoonguss. However, Thunder Wave is great speed control, and especially important if you plan to use Rotom-W as a rain check, since it survives Ludicolo's Giga Drain and can paralyze it back. Protect keeps Rotom-W alive, stalls field conditions, and scouts for attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With this EV spread, Rotom-W always survives Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out into Return, two Mega Metagross Zen Headbutts, or two Amoonguss Giga Drains. If you're using Rotom-W on a Tailwind team, you should move 12 Special Attack EVs to Speed to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T in Tailwind. Sitrus Berry is by far the most consistent item option for Rotom-W, but ChestoRest is another option for greater healing, though at the risk of not running Protect.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-W should be played as a bulky offensive glue Pokemon. This means that it should be switching into opposing threats, usually Water-, Flying-, or Ground-types, and either dealing damage or spreading status. Thanks to its amazing typing, it does this fairly reliably. Rotom-W also does a great job of tanking SlideQuake, which is a very popular coverage combination on Ground-types. The only Pokemon you should really fear with Rotom-W out are Grass- and Dragon-types. Threats with Lum Berry, such as Ferrothorn and Garchomp, like to lure Rotom-W and hit really hard. Make sure Rotom-W stays alive if the opponent is holding back Talonflame or Heatran, because they can be really threatening late-game if Rotom-W is taken out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fire-types such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Charizard are arguably the best partners to Rotom-W, as they benefit from having a partner that can sponge threatening Ground- and Rock-type attacks, and they can take out the Grass-types that threaten Rotom-W. Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Mega Lucario, Heatran, and Aegislash complement Rotom-W well defensively, as they resist Dragon- and Grass-type attacks, and Rotom-W resists Fire-type attacks. Ground-types appreciate Rotom-W as a partner, as they can freely use Earthquake beside it. Mamoswine is especially relevant here, as it can snipe Dragon- and Grass-types with ease.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is a standard move on Rotom-W, allowing it to OHKO Mega Diancie, Landorus-T, and sometimes Heatran, depending on the latter's EV spread. Thunderbolt is a more accurate STAB move to be locked into if Rotom-W is in a position to clean up, and it also helps deal with Water-types. Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to get more momentum if you do not want to lock it in into Hydro Pump or Thunderbolt. The move also chips the Dragon- and Grass-types that will switch in, such as Latios and Amoonguss. Trick allows Rotom-W to get rid of its Choice Scarf and cripple a foe with it, which makes it incredibly useful for dealing with utility Pokemon such as Cresselia and Amoonguss. Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are also great moves to cripple foes. Will-O-Wisp is effective versus physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Metagross, while Thunder Wave cripples fast threats such as Latios and Serperior, which Rotom-W normally can't threaten, by massively slowing them down.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The main reason to use Choice Scarf on Rotom-W is to be able to outspeed Landorus-T. With the listed EV spread, Rotom-W can KO Landorus-T with Hydro Pump before it moves. Rotom-W also outspeeds Deoxys-A and +1 Blaziken and can burn Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Metagross with Will-O-Wisp before they are able to move, which it wouldn't be able to do without a Choice Scarf.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-W is a fantastic lead in a lot of situations, being able to either deal heavy damage, cripple foes with status moves, or use Volt Switch to gain momentum. It also has a good matchup against other common leads such as Landorus-T and Mega Kangaskhan. Rotom-W functions decently well as a late-game sweeper if all of its checks are gone thanks to its high Speed. Levitate allows it to switch into Ground-type moves such as Earthquake. You should only bring this Rotom-W set in on resisted hits or free switches, as it's much frailer than its defensive sets. Trick can entirely cripple an opponent's utility Pokemon such as Cresselia or Amoonguss by locking it into one move. You can also use Trick on Trick Room attackers such as Aegislash to be able to underspeed them in Trick Room. Removing Rotom-W's Choice Scarf helps it further by allowing it to switch moves. Do not use Trick on Pokemon that have a Mega Stone, such as Kangaskhan and Charizard, as Trick will simply fail and Rotom-W will be vulnerable the next turn, forcing you to either use Trick again or switch out. Being locked into a status move can quickly make you lose offensive presence and can leave Rotom-W a vulnerable target. Use Volt Switch if you want to get a quick KO and immediately switch out as well, giving you a lot of momentum, or when you want to get chip damage off against resistant switch-ins such as Amoonguss and Latios. If you have multiple moves that can net a KO, look at your opponent's team and make sure to choose the best move to lock Rotom-W into.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Good teammates for Rotom-W would be Pokemon that appreciate its ability to pivot well to switch them in often, such as Landorus-T and Scrafty. Pokemon that have a poor matchup versus Landorus-T such as Mega Diancie and Mega Charizard Y appreciate Rotom-W's ability to deal with it easily. Considering Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Latios resist Rotom-W's attacks, you should use a Fairy-type such as Mega Gardevoir or Sylveon to KO them easily. They can also KO Kyurem-B through its Substitute, which it sets up freely against Rotom-W. Fighting-type Pokemon such as Virizion and Terrakion are good at taking down Hydreigon and Kyurem-B as well. Ice-types such as Kyurem-B and Weavile get rid of both Grass-types and Dragon-types; however, Kyurem-B has to look out for Dragon-type attacks itself because it's slower than Latios and Hydreigon, which is is a problem unless Kyurem-B has a Substitute up or your team has good speed control. You could also add Fire-types such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Volcarona to deal with Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Serperior easily. Flying-types such as Togekiss do this as well, with Togekiss also beating Dragon-types.</p> "

They also have immediate power and access to priority attacks for the former and more Speed for the latter. Furthermore, Manaphy requires dedicated redirection support in order to maximize its potential as a setup sweeper, as well as hail support to be as powerful as possible by spamming Blizzard. Manaphy does, however, set itself apart from other Water-types with its sheer power when using Tail Glow and its ability to beat Grass-types such as Amoonguss.</p> ",

It can also use Energy Ball, which enables it to beat other Water-types. However, doing so leaves Manaphy with a greater weakness to opposing Grass- and Dragon-types. Dazzling Gleam provides Manaphy an accurate spread attack, but it is quite weak, especially without the Tail Glow boost, failing to OHKO even threats hit 4x effectively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Grass-types, such as Serperior, Chlorophyll Venusaur, and Virizion, inflict massive damage on Manaphy with their super effective STAB moves.

Ice Beam is for useful coverage that sets Manaphy apart from Azumarill and Keldeo, which don't beat Grass- and Dragon-types. If Manaphy is being used with Abomasnow, Blizzard is a great option over Ice Beam for powerful spread coverage. Tail Glow quickly makes Manaphy very powerful by boosting its Special Attack by +3 in just one turn. Protect should be used to take a turn to allow one of Manaphy's allies to eliminate a faster threat that would prove fatal to it, as well as to stall out opposing field conditions such as Tailwind and Trick Room.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Modest Manaphy with maximum Special Attack EVs OHKOes Mega Kangaskhan with a +3 Scald after burn damage and OHKOes Amoonguss with +3 Ice Beam, as well as Speed tying with other base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan. Timid can also be used in order to attack as fast as possible while also outspeeding Adamant Mega Kangaskhan. Safety Goggles can be used to hit foes with Scald without having to worry about Amoonguss's Rage Powder or Spore and to avoid residual damage when Manaphy is used on hail teams. Sitrus Berry can also be used to make Manaphy survive longer with its immediate recovery.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Generally, Manaphy wants to set up once it's on the field, as it poses zero threat when not boosted. However, sometimes it is vital to remove a certain attacker before letting Manaphy set up. That being said, when using Tail Glow, Manaphy should usually be supported by a teammate's Fake Out or Follow Me. Longevity is key with Manaphy; use Protect when against a faster Pokemon that threatens Manaphy, such as Thundurus, to allow an ally to beat the threat in that turn. Manaphy functions well as a late-game sweeper, so it's usually a good idea to eliminate the fast Pokemon that threaten Manaphy before setting up with it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Redirection in the form of Follow Me or Rage Powder is vital in order to use Manaphy successfully. Pokemon such as Jirachi, Clefairy, Togekiss, and Amoonguss do this well. However, Manaphy should use Safety Goggles when paired with Amoonguss; its inability to redirect moves from other Grass-types hinders Manaphy and Safety Goggles grants it an immunity to an opposing Spore. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan and Infernape also provide more opportunities to set up. Pokemon that beat Water-types that wall Manaphy, such as Thundurus, Mega Venusaur, and Serperior, are also great partners. Dragon-types, such as Latios, Hydreigon, and Kyurem-B are good partners to Manaphy for their ability to beat some opposing Electric- and Water-types such as Thundurus and Rotom-W. They also benefit from Manaphy's ability to threaten Mega Diancie. Tailwind users, such as Talonflame, Latios, and Togekiss, make Manaphy a significantly more threatening sweeper by enabling it to outspeed Pokemon that would normally be faster than it and OHKO it, such as Virizion, Serperior, and Thundurus. Speed control can also be supplied by Thunder Wave users such as Thundurus and Jirachi. Regular or Mega Abomasnow can also be used with Manaphy to enable it to use Blizzard over Ice Beam, giving Manaphy threatening spread coverage. Abomasnow also has good offensive synergy with Manaphy, as it can threaten opposing Grass- and Water-types with its STAB attacks.</p> "

Darkrai also has access to great coverage moves such as Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Focus Blast and Will-O-Wisp for utility, making it an unpredictable and dangerous threat; however, its bulk and typing make for a big drawback, as they are mediocre and make Darkrai weak to very common types, therefore lacking resistances to switch in safely.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Psychic can be considered as an answer against Fighting-types, such as Conkeldurr and Infernape, but it's not often useful. Taunt can be considered in order to stop Trick Room users or Pokemon such as Amoonguss from using sleep-inducing moves such as Spore. Sludge Bomb is an okay option against Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Togekiss, and Azumarill if you aren't using Thunderbolt, but it provides less useful coverage than other moves and fails to OHKO any of them. Hidden Power Steel may be used to surprise Mega Diancie that would normally be a great answer to Darkrai.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Fairies such as Sylveon, Mega Diancie, Azumarill, and Mega Gardevoir can take any hit from Darkrai and KO it back with their Fairy-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Assault Vest Conkeldurr can tank any hit from Darkrai and OHKO it with Drain Punch or hit a weakened Darkrai with a priority Mach Punch.

Ice Beam is mainly for coverage, as it is able to hit common Pokemon such as Thundurus, Togekiss, and Amoonguss hard. Thunderbolt can be used over Ice Beam, trading the ability to beat Hydreigon and OHKO Breloom for coverage on Keldeo, Azumarill, and Charizard, or can be used alongside Ice Beam in the third slot, though Darkrai will then be forced out by Pokemon such as Kangaskhan and Terrakion. Focus Blast is a strong move that hits Pokemon that resist Darkrai's STAB type such as Tyranitar, Scrafty, and Terrakion hard; however, it is a bit unreliable because of its low accuracy. Will-O-Wisp is used to burn and threaten common physical threats, as it is very annoying because it is guaranteed to burn non-Fire-type foes and is more reliable than Focus Blast versus foes such as Bisharp and Terrakion. Protect scouts the opposing Pokemon's moves, helps with avoiding Fake Out, and gives Darkrai's partner a chance to KO opposing threats such as Conkeldurr or other powerful Fairy- and Fighting-types. You can also give Darkrai Blizzard in the place of Ice Beam if you are using it on a hail team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack EVs are given to maximize the damage Darkrai deals, especially with Life Orb. 184 Speed EVs are given so Darkrai can outspeed all Pokemon up to those with base 116 Speed, such as Whimsicott. However, if the situation requires it, Darkrai can run more Speed at the cost of HP. The remaining EVs are put into HP to allow Darkrai to gain some bulk, which also happens to hit a Life Orb number. If you opt to run Thunderbolt, a Modest nature with 12 HP / 252 SpA / 244 Spe is an option to guarantee the OHKO on Keldeo.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Darkrai should be brought in on a free switch due to its lackluster bulk and weakness to common types. Darkrai can be used at any point in the game depending on the opponent's team, as it can easily deal with early-game Pokemon such as Aegislash but can also perform well late-game when every Pokemon is weak enough for Darkrai to clean.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon with Wide Guard such as Aegislash and Hitmontop help a lot against Sylveon's Hyper Voice, and Aegislash also covers Darkrai's weaknesses well. Pokemon with Quick Guard are good too, as Darkrai is very frail and struggles against Fighting-types; therefore Talonflame is a good partner, as it can take on Fighting-types, scares off Bug- and Fighting-types, can set up Tailwind, resists Fairy-type attacks, and can tank priority moves such as Mach Punch well. Pokemon with a Fairy-type resistance are good to cover Darkrai's weakness, such as Heatran, Aegislash, and Amoonguss. Teammates that can hit Fighting-types hard such as Sylveon, Latios, and Cresselia are good options. Pokemon with Intimidate such as Landorus-T help against most Fighting-types, as most of them are physical attackers. Finally, Darkrai has access to Blizzard, so it can be used in conjunction with Abomasnow, and its Dark typing helps scare off Aegislash, which greatly threatens hail teams otherwise.</p> "

  "Victini": {
    "overview": "<p>A hard hitter backed by a high-Base Power STAB move in V-create, Victini can do lots of damage to the majority of the Doubles metagame. Its solid Speed tier allows it to be a passable Choice Scarf user with access to decent coverage options and pivoting moves as well as the ability to outspeed common fast threats such as Deoxys-A and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Victini checks sun teams fairly well with its resistance to Fire-type moves and the power it draws from the sunlight; these same traits also allow Victini to perform well on sun-oriented teams. Unfortunately, Victini's main move V-create comes with many drawbacks. It decreases Victini's defenses and Speed, and as a result Victini is left vulnerable after using the attack. Due to its average Attack stat, Victini is forced to bite that bullet or it is left with rather underwhelming power behind its attacks. A weakness to Sucker Punch is another of its downfalls as a Choice Scarf user, as Victini relies on moving first to do its duty. Also, since it doesn't run Protect, Victini is left vulnerable to all forms of speed control. Its bulk isn't anything to write home about either, making it fairly easy to whittle down. This trait is especially problematic considering that Victini needs as much HP as it can get to deal more damage with Final Gambit and act as a reliable emergency button. As a result of these many drawbacks, Victini is left outclassed in most roles by fellow Fire-types such as Heatran, Infernape, and Volcanion, which tend to have more bulk, better resistances, or greater offensive capabilities.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Trick allows Victini to mess up supporting Pokemon such as Cresselia and Clefairy by locking them into one move. Choice Band could be another item option for Victini, which would allow it to hit even harder, but this loses the benefits of Choice Scarf Victini's blazing Speed. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers, but it is best used either on a non-Choiced set or a set with Trick, since Victini doesn't appreciate being locked into Will-O-Wisp. A Trick Room setter set using Safety Goggles takes advantage of the Speed drops from V-create and allows Victini to invest more in its decent defensive stats. Special lures using Blue Flare, Energy Ball, or Glaciate can be used to beat certain threats more reliably. Hidden Power Ground can be run to hit Heatran, which normally switches in for free, although it doesn't hit much else. A Substitute set allows Victini to avoid status effects and works particularly well under Trick Room as an attacker. Taunt disrupts the foes' strategy, whether it be Trick Room, Tailwind, status effects, or a Taunt of their own. However, Victini thrives due to its excellent coverage and generally doesn't have room for Taunt. Helping Hand is also a nice option on non-Choiced sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Despite being weak to Fusion Bolt, bulky Water-types serve as strong answers to Victini due to their resistance to V-create, which will be the move Victini uses nine times out of ten. Notable examples include Suicune, Rotom-W, and Jellicent.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Rock-types such as Mega Diancie and Rhydon are primarily considered answers to Victini due to their resistance to V-create, but they also tend to avoid being hit super effectively by its coverage moves. Rhydon also carries Lightning Rod as its ability to protect anything Victini may wish to hit with a Fusion Bolt.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Rotom-H, Heatran, and other Fire-type Pokemon can easily take any of Victini's attacks, although some, such as Mega Charizard Y, must be cautious of a Fusion Bolt. Talonflame uses Gale Wings to attack Victini before it can move, and if Victini has even one V-create drop, it has a chance to be OHKOed by a Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: If Victini is paralyzed, it can't do its job as a quick removal specialist and becomes close to deadweight. Therefore, Victini needs to watch out for Thunder Wave from Pokemon such as Thundurus and Rotom-W, as well as other forms of speed control such as Icy Wind and Tailwind that can screw with its plans. Since it cannot effectively run Protect, Victini is unable to stall out Tailwind or Trick Room, leaving it even more vulnerable to these than other fast Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate: As it isn't able to run a boosting nature, Victini needs all the Attack that it can get; ending up at -1 or -2 Attack due to Intimidate from Salamence, Landorus-T, or Scrafty severely lowers its potential.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>V-create is a super strong STAB attack, and coming from Victini's decent base Attack, it will OHKO or 2HKO all foes that don't resist it save for especially bulky ones such as Porygon2 and Cresselia. Unfortunately, it comes with the downside of lowering Victini's stats, and after only one use, Victini's Choice Scarf boost is canceled out. Bolt Strike provides coverage against Water-types and Flying-types, hitting would-be checks such as Keldeo, Gyarados, and Mega Charizard Y really hard. U-turn allows Victini to pivot out of bad matchups or sticky situations, dealing chip damage and even hitting some threats such as Latios and Hydreigon hard in the process. Final Gambit allows Victini to sacrifice itself in order to instantly remove most threats, provided that it's still decently healthy itself. Zen Headbutt yields a different coverage option, hitting all Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Keldeo and Poison-types such as Gengar super effectively. It also comes with a chance to cause the target to flinch, which can turn a game around in a pinch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>220 EVs invested in Speed with a Jolly nature and a Choice Scarf allow Victini to outrun Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Modest Swift Swim Ludicolo while at +0, as well as all neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon after using V-Create once. Maximum Attack investment helps Victini hit as hard as possible. The remainder of the EVs are used for HP, giving Victini both some bulk and some more power behind Final Gambit. Victory Star is particularly helpful, as many of Victini's moves are slightly inaccurate, and this ability makes them more reliable as well as increasing the accuracy of its moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Victini works well as a lead due to its high Speed and ability to pivot out of bad matchups using U-turn. Choice Scarf Landorus-T tends to also be a lead, so this gives Victini an opportunity to remove it immediately with Final Gambit. This also works for any other Pokemon that greatly threatens Victini's team, should that threat be chosen as a lead. If possible, bring Victini in after a teammate falls or in any other situation where it won't be taking damage, as Victini needs to keep its health high in order to have a threatening Final Gambit. Most of the time, Victini should be using V-create, since it does so much damage even to targets that resist it. It is best to aim for guaranteed KOs with V-create in order to avoid taking damage, especially as Victini's defenses will be lowered. Victini shouldn't lock itself into moves that could be unhelpful in the long run, so check out the opponent's team first, since whatever move Victini uses is what it's stuck with. Pay attention to the Speed drop from V-create, as after one drop, the Choice Scarf boost is removed, and after two, Victini will be outsped by many different foes, so it may need to switch out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Anything that struggles with Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Ferrothorn or faster threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T can partner well with Victini. Sun support from Mega Charizard Y makes V-create hit way harder, allowing +0 V-create to OHKO Landorus-T, one of the biggest threats to Mega Charizard Y. Mega Diancie appreciates the removal of many of Victini's targets and puts many threats into KO range with its powerful Diamond Storm while also beating Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Salamence that deter Victini from doing its job. Mega Kangaskhan is benefitted by Victini's removal of Landorus-T, Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Fighting-types, all of which give it trouble. In return, Mega Kangaskhan can knock many threats into KO range or use Sucker Punch to snipe threats that outspeed Victini once its Speed is low due to V-create. Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion can remove Mega Kangaskhan and Bisharp for Victini, both of which would otherwise threaten it with their powerful Sucker Punch. A partner to remove Water-types, such as Venusaur or Thundurus, helps clear Victini's path. Victini also appreciates a teammate that can remove Thundurus, which can paralyze it. One such option is Kyurem-B, which also benefits from Victini performing well against sun teams and itself performs well against rain. Wide Guard users protect Victini from super effective Earthquakes and Rock Slides, with Aegislash probably being the best partner due to its ability to beat opposing Psychic-, Rock-, and Ghost-types for Victini.</p> "

  "Serperior": {
    "overview": "<p>Serperior is the fastest viable Grass-type in DOU, and thanks to Contrary, it has the ability to quickly attain boosts to its otherwise unremarkable Special Attack. Its high Speed and STAB Leaf Storm allow it to beat common threats such as Mega Diancie and Keldeo. Furthermore, its access to Glare in tandem with said Speed allows it to provide a fast form of speed control against opposing Ground-types such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T. However, Serperior is severely hindered by its significant lack of coverage options, forcing it to rely on different Hidden Power types to avoid being stopped cold by several common threats. Serperior's overall offensive impact is also held back by its abysmal initial attacking power, so it absolutely needs a boost or two before being able to pose any sort of real threat; however, when it gets just one boost, its Leaf Storm can OHKO Mega Kangaskhan and 2HKO Cresselia, which is very impressive for a neutrally effective attack.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Serperior can utilize a defensive set in order to more effectively provide speed control with Glare while also providing support with either Reflect or Light Screen. Hidden Power Fire can be used if the rest of the team is susceptible to opposing Grass-types, but Hidden Power Rock and Ground are generally a lot more useful. Coba Berry can be used to survive Talonflame's Brave Bird and allow Serperior to OHKO it with Hidden Power Rock. Likewise, Focus Sash can be used to survive one super effective attack and preserve Serperior's acquired Leaf Storm boosts. However, forgoing Life Orb prevents Serperior from getting some valuable KOs on Azumarill and Mega Diancie before a boost.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Generally, Fire-types such as Heatran, Rotom-H, Mega Charizard Y, and Talonflame beat Serperior easily, but they can sometimes be taken out by the appropriate Hidden Power after a Leaf Storm boost or two.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Kyurem-B, Hydreigon, and Latios can switch in on an unboosted Serperior but have to watch out for boosted Dragon Pulse unless they have Choice Scarf or Haban Berry, although the latter is uncommon.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Defensively, Serperior is walled by bulky Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Faster Pokemon that can take advantage of Serperior's paltry bulk have no problem ousting it from the battlefield. In particular, speedy Pokemon such as Talonflame, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Mega Gengar, and Deoxys-A are all threats that Serperior needs to watch out for.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: All forms of opposing speed control mitigate Serperior's typically advantageous Speed tier and leave it very vulnerable due to its relatively low defenses.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leaf Storm is the only notable STAB move that should ever be considered for Serperior, as it allows it to obtain considerable Special Attack boosts quickly. Dragon Pulse is a coverage move that allows Serperior to hit some Pokemon that resist Leaf Storm neutrally, such as Amoonguss, but it's primarily used to OHKO Dragon-types after a boost, particularly Latios and Hydreigon. Hidden Power Ground is another coverage option that can be utilized to OHKO Heatran and prevent Serperior from being walled by other Steel-types that often get in its way, such as Aegislash and Jirachi. However, Hidden Power Rock is an equally viable option that allows Serperior to beat Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Rotom-H. Should Serperior have sufficient support against threats that these Hidden Power types are meant to provide coverage against, it can run Glare instead as a means of speed control to make speedy Pokemon, such as Landorus-T, less threatening. Protect is an all-around good move in Doubles, but Serperior especially needs it in order to stall out opposing field conditions, particularly Trick Room and Tailwind.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Serperior to make full use of its Speed stat, letting it outspeed base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Latios as well as Pokemon that creep the 110 Speed tier, such as Thundurus and Mega Lucario. With maximum Special Attack EVs, Serperior can make the most of its average initial Special Attack; in conjunction with Life Orb, Serperior can OHKO both Mega Diancie and Azumarill with an unboosted Leaf Storm while also OHKOing Latios and Hydreigon with a +2 Dragon Pulse.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Serperior is fairly one-dimensional; it has very underwhelming power before a Leaf Storm boost, so getting a boost is absolutely necessary in order to apply any amount of offensive pressure upon the opposing team with it. That being said, Serperior should usually be brought in against a foe that is within range to be OHKOed by an unboosted Leaf Storm. However, due to Serperior's middling defenses, it should also usually be brought in after a teammate faints.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Landorus-T and Mega Diancie serve as excellent partners to Serperior for their ability to check both Talonflame and Thundurus as well as being able to put foes in Leaf Storm's OHKO range with their respective spread moves. Fire-types, such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Blaziken, are also great allies that can beat opposing Steel-types that Hidden Power Ground does not do enough damage to, such as Aegislash and Ferrothorn. They can also get rid of bulky Grass-types that Serperior can't deal with at all, particularly Amoonguss. Pokemon that can rid the field of Fire-types are also great to pair with Serperior. Water-types such as Keldeo and Azumarill are most effective at checking opposing Fire-types, but Dragon-types such as Latios and Hydreigon are also good picks for this role.</p> "

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Excadrill suffers greatly from the presence of Landorus-T, as the two share many similarities and their few differences make the latter a more reliable pick on most teams. Excadrill's only real niche over Landorus-T is its Sand Rush ability. Sadly, this leaves Excadrill reliant on sand, a field effect that only has one viable setter in Tyranitar. Tyranitar's and Excadrill's similarities leave many holes to be filled by their remaining teammates, so the duo needs lots of support to function effectively. When granted adequate support, Excadrill is a quite threatening cleaner with high offensive stats, decent coverage, and a helpful immunity to Thunder Wave. Its access to two powerful spread moves in Earthquake and Rock Slide allows Excadrill to take full advantage of the limited turns of sand by dealing large amounts of damage to both foes. Unfortunately, if its attack fails to KO its target, Excadrill may be in trouble due to low defensive stats and a poor defensive typing that leaves it weak to common attacking types such as Ground, Fire, Fighting, and Water. If the opposing team is able to remove Excadrill's Speed advantage through speed control or a change in weather, Excadrill's pitiful defenses often prevent it from effectively using its offensive prowess.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Equipping an Air Balloon allows Excadrill to fear Landorus-T slightly less, although it loses out on the benefits that a Focus Sash or Life Orb could provide. Swords Dance can be run over Iron Head to turn Excadrill into a fearsome sweeper, but it has difficulty finding the time to set up due to its frailty and the limited turns of sand. Substitute may be used to shield Excadrill from harmful status ailments, prevent Intimidate users from lowering its Attack, and withstand attacks that it normally would not be able to. Sadly, it is difficult to justify removing one of Excadrill's attacks for it. A Choice Scarf set utilizing Mold Breaker allows it to work somewhat well outside of sand and turns its usual counters such as Rotom-W into easy targets of Earthquake. Unfortunately, this set is fairly predictable, as it is the only situation in which Excadrill would not be paired with Tyranitar, and it is outclassed by Landorus-T in nearly every way due to the latter's higher Attack, better coverage moves, and access to Intimidate.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Virizion resist Rock Slide and can typically OHKO Excadrill with their Fighting-type STAB move of choice. Breloom and Conkeldurr even have the advantage of access to Mach Punch, allowing them to bypass Excadrill's boosted Speed.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Bulky Water-types are resistant to Iron Head, won't take much from spread-reduced neutrally effective attacks such as Earthquake and Rock Slide, and can hit Excadrill hard with their Water-types STAB moves. Some notable examples include Rotom-W, which is immune to Earthquake and can burn Excadrill, and Suicune, which can also set Tailwind to remove the utility provided by Excadrill's Sand Rush.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Both Landorus formes are at worst affected neutrally by Excadrill's attacks, and they can OHKO back with their STAB Ground-type move of choice.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: As a physical attacker, Excadrill is quite threatened by common methods of lowering Attack. The most common of such threats are Intimidate users, such as Landorus-T and Scrafty, and Will-O-Wisp users, such as Gengar and Rotom-W.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Excadrill needs sand in order to function at its highest capability, and opposing weather setters, such as Politoed, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Abomasnow, remove that field effect. Politoed is the most troubling of them, as Excadrill can outspeed and severely damage standard Mega Abomasnow and Mega Charizard Y sets.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind and Trick Room: Excadrill's best quality is its Speed advantage, which Tailwind setters such as Suicune and Trick Room setters such as Cresselia can remove.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard: When running Earthquake instead of Drill Run, Excadrill has only Iron Head to get around a potential Wide Guard. Conkeldurr and Aegislash are especially threatening in this case, as Conkeldurr has Mach Punch to get around Excadrill's blazing Speed and Aegislash resists Iron Head.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Sand Rush Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Excadrill's main Ground-type STAB attack, used for dealing as much damage as possible to the opposing team. Drill Run is a decent alternative to Earthquake that gets around Wide Guard and doesn't hit Excadrill's partner, which is often Tyranitar. However, Excadrill that are using Drill Run must watch out for Aegislash using King's Shield because, unlike Earthquake, Drill Run makes contact. Iron Head is Excadrill's secondary STAB move, which hits bulky Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Ice-types such as Kyurem-B, with a convenient chance to flinch that pairs nicely with Excadrill's high Speed under sand. Rock Slide hits Flying-types like Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y that are immune to Earthquake and deals decent spread damage, which is especially important if Excadrill runs Drill Run instead of Earthquake. Protect shields Excadrill from attacks while its teammate deals with a threat, stalls out opposing field conditions, and gives it safety while attaining the Sand Rush boost by switching in Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sand Rush is Excadrill's main niche and is essential to its success. Maximum Attack and Speed investment should be used to help Excadrill hit hard and fast, thus taking advantage of the limited turns of sand. Alongside those EVs, an Adamant nature is chosen over a Jolly one, as Adamant Excadrill already outspeeds nearly everything under sand, including Deoxys-A, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and certain Tailwind-boosted threats such as Bisharp and Volcanion. Life Orb makes Excadrill far more threatening, but a Focus Sash can be used to ensure Excadrill survives any one hit.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bring Excadrill in as soon as possible to when sand is set so that it starts hitting the foes hard with attacks backed by Sand Rush-boosted Speed. Try to avoid situations where Excadrill needs to use Protect, as this wastes a precious turn of sand. Excadrill typically works best mid- to late-game, to clean up the opposing team after it has taken some damage. Delaying Excadrill's entry into the battle gives the rest of the team time to take out Wide Guard or Intimidate users, as well as problematic Pokemon such as Rotom-W. If running Earthquake, that should be the move Excadrill uses in most cases, with the other attacks used only as needed to supplement its coverage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar is a required partner for Excadrill to be successful, as it is the only viable setter of sand. Due to the similarity in coverage between standard Tyranitar and Excadrill sets, a lure Tyranitar set with moves such as Ice Beam and Fire Blast can help take out Landorus-T and Ferrothorn, respectively, which would normally be solid answers to the duo. Excadrill has many Pokemon that threaten to cut its rampage short, so it needs teammates that are able to take on those threats before they can cause too much trouble. First and foremost is Rotom-W, which is probably the best Excadrill answer in the metagame due to its typing, ability, and access to Will-O-Wisp. Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Serperior, and Virizion can help Excadrill out here, as they also take on other troublesome Water-type threats including Keldeo and Suicune. Although Grass-types work as decent partners to Excadrill, opposing Grass-types are problematic, so teammates such as Latios, Talonflame, and Mega Gengar are solid choices. Mega Gengar is especially notable, as it is able to trap and remove opposing weather setters, ensuring that Excadrill's sand turns will not be cut short. Finally, teammates that can take on Landorus-T such as Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Kyurem-B are absolutely required due to its prevalence and great matchup against Excadrill. If Excadrill is using Earthquake, it needs teammates that can avoid taking damage from the attack, like Ground-immune Electric-types such as Zapdos and Thundurus. Their Electric-type STAB moves also allow them to take on the two most popular weather setters, Politoed and Mega Charizard Y. Wide Guard support from teammates such as Conkeldurr protects Excadrill from the fairly common spread moves it is weak to, Earthquake and Heat Wave. A teammate with Wide Guard also adds another Pokemon that Excadrill can safely use Earthquake beside. Helping Hand support from a teammate such as Cresselia allows Excadrill's spread attacks to deal far more damage and take fuller advantage of the limited sand turns.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Due to a combination of high Attack and low Speed, which is something most viable Fighting-types in the tier lack, Conkeldurr makes for an ideal Trick Room attacker in Doubles OU. It possesses two fantastic abilities in Iron Fist and Guts to boost its already great attacking prowess, as well as decent bulk to allow it to play outside of Trick Room. Conkeldurr's movepool ranges from good STAB attacks in Drain Punch, Hammer Arm, and Mach Punch to good coverage and support options in moves like Wide Guard and Knock Off. However, Conkeldurr faces stiff competition from other Fighting-types like Keldeo and Scrafty, due to a lack of secondary typing and poor Speed, making it the preferred choice only on Trick Room teams or on a team in need of a bulky Fighting-type.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Conkeldurr is a decent user of Assault Vest, as it has good bulk aside from Special Defense, and the boost aids in its ability to tank hits from other Pokemon. Conkeldurr also has a lot of coverage options, including Rock Slide, Rock Tomb, and Stone Edge. These can be used to surprise Talonflame and other Flying-types, but because Conkeldurr is slow, it doesn't make for that great of a lure; usually, Ice Punch or Knock Off is far more useful. Poison Jab is another option, as it can hit Fairy-types for super effective damage, but it's only useful if you can predict a Fairy-type switching in or are under Trick Room, as most Fairy-types outspeed Conkeldurr and can hit it hard with a super effective attack of their own. Conkeldurr also gets access to the other elemental punches, Thunder Punch and Fire Punch, which can give it a different array of coverage. Typically, Ice Punch is the most versatile and generally the best option, as Thunder Punch really only hits Gyarados harder than any of Conkeldurr's other moves, while Fire Punch provides a single coverage move to hit both Amoonguss and Aegislash rather than making Conkeldurr run both Ice Punch and Knock Off. Flame Orb and Guts can work on Trick Room teams to get the Guts boost and avoid other status, particularly Spore from Amoonguss.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Most Fairy-types, such as Sylveon and Azumarill, take very little damage from any of Conkeldurr's STAB attacks or coverage options and can then OHKO it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame:Talonflame is one of the single best checks to Conkeldurr. It resists Conkeldurr's Fighting-type STAB attacks, takes neutral damage from all of Conkeldurr's other common moves, and can hit it for super effective damage with a priority STAB Brave Bird. Talonflame also beats Conkeldurr while Trick Room is active, as its Brave Bird ignores its effect, and its resistance to Mach Punch makes it difficult to check. It should, however, be wary of Rock Slide or Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: Common Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Gyarados lower Conkeldurr's attacking prowess. Landorus-T should be wary of Ice Punch, though. Burns from the likes of Rotom-W and Gengar also neuter Conkeldurr's attacking prowess if it's not running Guts.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Due to its low Speed, nearly every notable threat to Conkeldurr outspeeds it outside of Trick Room.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hammer Arm is ridiculously strong with boosts from Iron Fist and Life Orb, and it can deal massive chunks of damage to most of the metagame. Mach Punch serves as a nice priority STAB attack and helps make up for Conkeldurr's low Speed. Ice Punch provides great coverage to deal heavy damage to Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Amoonguss. Knock Off is mainly for Aegislash, and it has the nice utility of removing important items. Conkeldurr should be wary of using Knock Off into Aegislash's King's Shield, however. Whichever move is used depends on what the team is in most need of. Lastly, Detect keeps Conkeldurr safe during turns without Trick Room from incoming attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EVs are simple enough; the spread allows Conkeldurr to hit hard while adding overall bulk through HP. The 0 Speed IVs let Conkeldurr underspeed Amoonguss at -1, giving it a great advantage against the tier's most common Trick Room answer. Iron Fist boosts the punch moves Conkeldurr is running, causing Hammer Arm to become extremely powerful. Guts is another ability option, as it allows Conkeldurr to soak up burns and paralysis to receive an Attack boost and makes for great utility to protect other teammates that would be otherwise devastated by status. Life Orb aids in increasing Conkeldurr's power, as well as boosting Knock Off, which Iron Fist does not.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is designed for teams utilizing Trick Room. Due to Conkeldurr's low speed, it ideally should only be played when Trick Room is active. It does, however, have utility outside of Trick Room thanks to its bulk, using Mach Punch to clean up weakened foes. As for when it should be played, Conkeldurr is pretty versatile, performing well early-, mid-, and late-game. However, common Trick Room checks such as Talonflame and Amoonguss should ideally be removed before Conkeldurr enters the field; then it can begin to wreak havoc.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Trick Room setters such as Cresselia allow Conkeldurr to outspeed a majority of the metagame and ruin lives. Conkeldurr has a problem with Talonflame, so Pokemon such as Azumarill and Diancie that can beat Talonflame help it immensely. Amoonguss is a common Trick Room check, so having Pokemon like Heatran and Reuniclus to stop it is nice. Reuniclus in particular is good, as Overcoat makes it immune to Spore and Rage Powder. Conkeldurr can, however, deal heavy damage to Amoonguss on its own with Ice Punch. Fairy-types are also a problem, so Heatran, Aegislash, and other slow Steel-types can aid Conkeldurr greatly. Lastly, common Trick Room Pokemon that struggle against Bisharp such as Reuniclus, Cresselia, and Mega Abomasnow are good partners, as Conkeldurr can easily switch in on Bisharp and KO it with Mach Punch.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Drain Punch acts as both a reliable STAB attack and a form of recovery to increase Conkeldurr's longevity. Mach Punch serves as nice priority and helps make up for Conkeldurr's low Speed. Ice Punch is a great coverage move to deal heavy damage to Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Amoonguss. Knock Off is mainly for Aegislash, and it has nice utility in removing important items. It should be wary of using Knock Off against Aegislash's King's Shield, however. Wide Guard could be used instead to support teammates weak to common spread moves such as Earthquake and Heat Wave. Lastly, Detect can be used instead to make strategic plays around threats to Conkeldurr.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sitrus Berry increases Conkeldurr's bulk and allows it to survive Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out + Return. The EVs are designed to let Conkeldurr survive a Psyshock from Life Orb Latios. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 184 Atk / 72 SpD can be used instead to let it survive maximum Special Attack Mega Charizard Y's Overheat with Assault Vest. Guts allows Conkeldurr to soak up burns and paralysis to receive an Attack boost, and it makes for great utility to protect other teammates that would be otherwise devastated by status. Iron Fist boosts the power of the punch moves Conkeldurr is running and is also a good option. A Brave nature helps with the team's Trick Room matchup even if Conkeldurr is used on a non-Trick Room team.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Conkeldurr set functions well mid-game to act as a switch-in for weakened teammates and punch some serious holes in the opponent's team. Mach Punch can help finish off weakened foes quickly and effortlessly. Be cautious of super effective attacks if you're using Knock Off or Wide Guard, as Conkeldurr won't be able to use Detect. Lastly, use Wide Guard against Pokemon that typically spam spread moves, such as Mega Charizard Y and Sylveon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Wide Guard's protection and are weak to spread moves like Rock Slide, such as Mega Charizard Y, make for good partners. Intimidate users such as Gyarados and Landorus-T pair well with Conkeldurr too, as they can weaken opposing physical attackers, particularly Talonflame, a big threat to Conkeldurr. Steel-types can take Fairy-, Psychic-, and Flying-type attacks aimed at Conkeldurr. Jirachi is especially good at this, as it can redirect them with Follow Me and absorb the hits with ease while also hitting Fairy-types for super effective damage. Heatran is also notable, as it completely walls Talonflame. Electric-types pair well with Conkeldurr too, as they can beat the Flying-types that cause such problems to Conkeldurr. Rotom-W is a solid option, as it resists Talonflame's STAB Flare Blitz and Brave Bird.</p> "

  "Whimsicott": {
    "overview": "<p>Whimsicott is the fastest Pokemon with the ability Prankster; this, coupled with its expansive support movepool, makes it a niche choice for a disrupter and Tailwind setter. However, Whimsicott has a myriad of flaws that can hold it back from performing its role in the Doubles OU metagame. For starters, Whimsicott has almost no offensive presence, leaving it able to do real damage only against targets that are weak to its STAB moves. Whimsicott's defenses are also lackluster, forcing it to equip a Focus Sash and making it tough for it to stay on the field and perform its role for more than a couple of turns. Furthermore, Whimsicott's typing is not very good defensively, as it is weak to common Ice-, Fire-, and Flying-type moves. Finally, Whimsicott is almost wholly outclassed by Thundurus and Talonflame. Thundurus also has Prankster but, unlike Whimsicott, also boasts a good typing and offenses, while Talonflame has priority Tailwind and a great offensive presence.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Beat Up can set you up for a big sweep when used on a partner that has Justified, usually Terrakion, but this is a very situational play and one that many players will see coming. It also limits both Whimsicott, which could be using a more useful move than Beat Up, and the team, which might not be optimal with Terrakion, the only viable Beat Up recipient. Helping Hand allows Whimsicott to boost the power of a partner's move, but it is fairly situational and outclassed by Whimsicott's other moves. Charm is helpful for weakening the power of physical attackers and providing your other Pokemon a chance to set up against a weakened foe. It should only be used on teams that are very weak to physical attackers like Mega Kangaskhan, as this move is, like most moves on this list, fairly situational. Sitrus Berry is an item option that allows Whimsicott to have some reliable recovery and avoid a notable OHKO from Mega Kangaskhan, but Focus Sash is generally preferred because Whimsicott wants to make sure it always survives strong attacks from the likes of Talonflame and Kyurem-B. An offensive set with Life Orb and maximum Speed and Special Attack investment can be used as well; the combination of Grass and Fairy coverage with support moves gives it a niche. Even with all of this, however, Whimsicott's damage output is fairly low; therefore, this set is outclassed by many of the other common offensive Grass-types, such as Serperior, Venusaur, and Breloom.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Fire-types, such as Heatran and Talonflame, resist both Fairy- and Grass-type attacks and can OHKO or do a lot of damage to Whimsicott.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types resist both Grass- and Fairy-type attacks and can take out Whimsicott. The notable threat here is Aegislash, although Whimsicott can Taunt or Encore Aegislash into King's Shield or Substitute. Other dangerous Steel-types include Mega Metagross and Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon: Kyurem-B and Mega Abomasnow are large threats to Whimsicott, and although Whimsicott can Encore Kyurem-B into Substitute, most Kyurem will just use Ice Beam on Whimsicott. Weavile can also break down Whimsicott through Fake Out and Ice Shard, which move before Whimsicott's status moves.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Even though Whimsicott is the fastest Prankster Taunt user in the game, it still gets shut down by a Taunt from Pokemon such as Thundurus, and without its ability to use support moves, Whimsicott is a near-worthless Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Quick Guard: Quick Guard totally shuts down Whimsicott's targeted Prankster moves, which is most of the set's arsenal. It can still use Tailwind and attack, but without the ability to use Encore, Taunt, or Fake Tears, Whimsicott's ability to disrupt is weakened considerably.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Moonblast is Whimsicott's best STAB move, which offers coverage against Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr, Dark-types such as Weavile, and Dragon-types such as Latios. Energy Ball is another option for a STAB attack, as it can damage Water-types such as Suicune and Rock-types such as Rhyperior. Encore gives Whimsicott the ability to lock an opposing Pokemon into an unfavorable move, such as Fake Out, Protect, Trick Room, or Substitute. Tailwind provides speed control by doubling the Speed of all allies, and Whimsicott can set Tailwind reliably at least once per game thanks to Prankster. Protect helps Whimsicott scout to see if it wants to Encore the foe the next turn. For example, if the opponent uses Fake Out, Protect can shield Whimsicott from damage and allow it to Encore the opponent the following turn. It is also useful for stalling out opposing speed control and shielding Whimsicott from damage and move disruption while its partner deals with a threat. Fake Tears can allow Whimsicott to help a specially-attacking partner take out foes it normally would not be able to, thanks to the Special Defense drop. Taunt can also be used to stop other Prankster users, most notably Thundurus, from firing off disruptive moves. It can also be used to stop support moves from other Pokemon, such as sleep moves, redirection, setup moves, and speed control.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Giving Whimsicott 216 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allows it to outspeed maximum Speed Thundurus, which is vitally important because Thundurus is the most relevant Prankster Pokemon in Doubles OU. 96 Special Attack EVs make sure Whimsicott always OHKOes 252 HP Scrafty with Moonblast. If using Energy Ball, move the Special Attack EVs into HP and Defense, as there is no relevant offensive benchmark for this move. The leftover EVs are placed in HP to allow Whimsicott to take as many hits as possible. Focus Sash allows Whimsicott to survive any one hit, which makes it its best item choice because Whimsicott's defensive stats are so poor and it will often find itself at the mercy of strong and super effective attacks. Prankster boosts the priority of Whimsicott's utility moves, allowing Whimsicott to disrupt its foes before they have a chance to move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Whimsicott works well as a lead to beat opposing Fake Out users and speed control Pokemon with Encore or Taunt, or to set up Tailwind for its own team. Whimsicott can use Protect on opposing Fake Outs and then Encore the Fake Out user the next turn. Keep in mind that other players may be wary of an incoming Encore and may switch out the target Pokemon to avoid this. It is okay for Whimsicott to stay in on a strong attacker such as Talonflame if Whimsicott is at full health and desperately needs to get off a support move. Whimsicott is not supposed to be filling an attacking role; as such, it should only attack when none of its support moves would be useful or when it can take out an opposing Pokemon that is weak to its STAB attack, such as Scrafty or Gastrodon depending on your choice in STAB move.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>A fantastic Pokemon to pair with Whimsicott is Mega Gengar. Trapping is incredibly valuable for Whimsicott, as it can Encore or Taunt opposing Pokemon while Gengar forces them to stay in. Disable is a fantastic move on a Mega Gengar that is paired with Whimsicott, as it allows you to Encore and Disable an opposing Pokemon into one move on the same turn, forcing it to Struggle and preventing it from switching out. Pokemon that appreciate the Speed boost of Tailwind are great partners for Whimsicott, as it is very good at setting Tailwind at least once per game. Strong attackers with middling Speed tiers, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Hoopa-U, and Heatran, are good choices in partners. Whimsicott needs to be paired with Pokemon that beat common Fire-types such as Heatran and Talonflame, as they are huge threats to Whimsicott. Landorus-T and Rotom-W do extremely well against the previously mentioned Pokemon. Steel-type Pokemon are also extremely threatening to Whimsicott. Aegislash and Mega Metagross are particularly threatening, which makes Heatran and Landorus-T great options to add to the team. If Whimsicott is using Fake Tears, strong special attackers, such as Sylveon, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Gengar, benefit greatly from the Special Defense drop.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Scrafty's unique combination of Fake Out, Intimidate, and Quick Guard makes it useful as an offensive supporter. It also has great natural bulk while also having decent offensive presence with STAB Knock Off, which makes it difficult to switch into. While Scrafty's low base Speed leaves it outsped by most of the metagame, it does allow it to function well under Trick Room. Scrafty faces competition from Hitmontop, distinguishing itself with its ability to beat Aegislash reliably, but, unlike Hitmontop, it lacks access to Wide Guard or a powerful STAB move such as Close Combat. Furthermore, Scrafty's relatively low Attack stat prevents it from picking up the same KOs that other Fighting-types in the tier can, and it is also very weak to Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir, Mega Diancie, and Azumarill, which are very common and hard to switch in to.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Trick Room attacker set with Life Orb and three attacks is a viable option that allows Scrafty to take advantage of its low Speed and its combination of Fake Out and Intimidate, which makes setting Trick Room much easier. Assault Vest could be used to improve Scrafty's already nice special bulk. Other move options such as Iron Head or Poison Jab to hit Diancie and Azumarill, respectively; Ice Punch to hit Landorus-T; and Stone Edge to hit Mega Charizard Y could be considered. Super Fang or Snarl can be used to cripple switch-ins without worrying about Intimidate or a potential burn. Low Kick is an option to be used over Drain Punch to hit certain Pokemon harder but others for less damage, notably picking up an OHKO on Terrakion.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Scrafty is 4x weak to Fairy and is OHKOed by the likes of Sylveon and Mega Diancie, which are also able to reliably tank both of Scrafty's STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion can threaten Scrafty with their powerful STAB moves, and even if Scrafty can reliably take one hit, its options to hit them back are limited.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon: Flying-type attacks threaten Scrafty, and Pokemon such as Talonflame can deal major damage to Scrafty, although it can block Brave Bird with Quick Guard.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: As Scrafty is a physical attacker, it is threatened by potential burns from the likes of Rotom-W and Intimidate users such as Landorus-T, which lower its Attack stat, forcing it to switch in order to apply any pressure. However, Lum Berry variants are not bothered by a potential burn.</p> <p><strong>Quick Guard: Quick Guard stops Scrafty's Fake Out, giving the foe the opportunity to attack Scrafty's partner.

Drain Punch allows Scrafty to recover health, while Knock Off provides useful utility to remove items from Pokemon and limit switches. Quick Guard shields Scrafty and its partner from Prankster Thunder Wave and Talonflame's Brave Bird as well as other priority attacks such as Aqua Jet and Sucker Punch. Detect can also be very useful for Scrafty, as it shields it while its partner can remove potential threats, as well as scout for attacks that may threaten it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sitrus Berry allows Scrafty to recover 25% of its HP, while Lum Berry can be used to absorb a status condition once, specifically burns. Intimidate allows Scrafty to weaken physical attackers and increase Scrafty's and its partner's physical bulk. Maximum HP investment and 44 Defense EVs, alongside a Relaxed nature, allow Scrafty to survive a Secret Sword from Life Orb Keldeo and also be slower than Aegislash to hit it in Blade forme, while also maximizing its general bulk. The remaining EVs are put into Attack to increase Scrafty's mediocre damage output.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Scrafty should be utilized to support other Pokemon on the team, primarily through Fake Out and Intimidate. Use Fake Out to give teammates free turns to attack or set up. Switch in frequently to utilize Intimidate and weaken physical attackers. Use Knock Off to remove the foes' items, crippling the opposing team.

Scrafty appreciates Pokemon that beat opposing Fighting-types; Azumarill and Mega Diancie help with both of these and really appreciate Scrafty's Quick Guard and Intimidate support. Setup sweepers such as Azumarill and Volcarona are given opportunities to set up with the combination of Fake Out + Intimidate as well as Quick Guard, which helps to shield them from priority moves that try to pick them off.</p> "

  "Gothitelle": {
    "overview": "<p>Gothitelle carves itself a niche in the Doubles OU metagame as one of two viable Shadow Tag users, with the other being Mega Gengar. Over its fellow trapper, Gothitelle boasts better defensive stats, the immediate ability to trap, and the ability to be used alongside another Mega Pokemon. Shadow Tag allows Gothitelle to provide excellent setup opportunities for teammates, aided by its wide range of support moves such as Charm, Heal Pulse, and Helping Hand. Gothitelle also fills the role of a bulky Psychic-type Trick Room setter and general supporter, as its great support movepool allows it to assist a variety of teammates.</p> <p>However, Gothitelle faces competition in these roles from other Psychic-types such as Cresselia, which boasts far better defensive stats and more reliable recovery in Moonlight. Gothitelle's pure Psychic typing and low offensive presence leave it particularly weak to Pokemon that greatly threaten Trick Room teams such as Bisharp, Hoopa-U, Heatran, and Aegislash. Due to this, Gothitelle also faces competition from other Trick Room setters such as Hoopa-U, Jellicent, and Reuniclus, which can all alleviate some of these weaknesses. Gothitelle's poor Special Attack stat and limited coverage leave it especially vulnerable to Taunt.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Taunt allows Gothitelle to stop Amoonguss from using Spore while also making Aegislash vulnerable and preventing Heatran from using Substitute. However, Amoonguss outspeeds Gothitelle under Trick Room, making Safety Goggles a necessary addition. Safety Goggles by itself can be used on Amoonguss-weak teams, but Gothitelle greatly misses the recovery from Sitrus Berry or ChestoRest. Foul Play allows Gothitelle to hit Pokemon with high Attack stats such as Aegislash, Hoopa-U, Mega Kangaskhan, and Landorus-T for sizable damage, but it further reduces Gothitelle's offensive presence against anything else. Colbur Berry allows Gothitelle to tank a single Dark-type attack, notably allowing it to live a Life Orb-boosted Knock Off from Adamant Bisharp, but reduces its overall ability to take hits. Mental Herb lets Gothitelle ignore a single Taunt, being most useful for guaranteeing Trick Room on the first turn, but it is single use and less effective than other items in most cases. Tickle is a team-specific version of Charm that reduces an opponent's Attack and Defense stats. If using Tickle, Psyshock should be used over Psychic as well due to its higher damage output after a Defense drop. Fake Tears is another great stat-lowering option to support specially offensive partners such as Mega Camerupt and Mega Abomasnow while also allowing Gothitelle to OHKO Amoonguss after the drop. Thunder Wave provides Gothitelle with a great single-target speed control move for non-Trick Room teams, but Gothitelle is primarily used on Trick Room so that it can use its support moves before foes can move. Light Screen can be used but is more passive than other options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Dark-types such as Bisharp, Hydreigon, and Hoopa-U in particular are a problem because they deal massive super effective damage to Gothitelle, with Bisharp's Knock Off and Hoopa-U's Hyperspace Fury even OHKOing it, and are immune to Gothitelle's STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-type Pokemon such as Bisharp, Heatran, and Aegislash take little to no damage from Gothitelle's attacks, with Heatran and Aegislash being free to use Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon</strong>: Aegislash and other Ghost-types such as Gengar can hit Gothitelle super effectively and are also free to switch out of Gothitelle's Shadow Tag.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Gothitelle's lack of direct offensive presence and reliance on support moves leaves it particularly vulnerable to Taunt, although it can still hit some Taunt users, such as Keldeo and Terrakion, for decent damage.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psychic is Gothitelle's strongest STAB move, dealing sufficient damage when hitting super effectively but not too much otherwise. Trick Room allows Gothitelle and other slow Pokemon to take advantage of moving first for a few turns. Gothitelle has a wide range of support options that are effective on this set, with Helping Hand being the best option for strengthening a partner's attack. Alternatively, Charm allows Gothitelle to greatly weaken opposing physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Landorus-T, making them trapped liabilities for teammates to take advantage of. Heal Pulse is another defensive support option that heals Gothitelle's partner by a good amount. Protect is a vitally important move in Doubles, allowing Gothitelle to avoid an attack or Taunt while its partner takes care of the threats. Omitting Protect for another support move can, however, be a viable option on certain teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Sassy nature with maximum HP investment and 56 Special Defense EVs ensures Gothitelle will survive a Life Orb-boosted Dark Pulse from Modest Hydreigon. Sitrus Berry and 160 Defense EVs allow Gothitelle to survive two Brave Birds from Adamant Life Orb Talonflame from full HP. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack to help patch up Gothitelle's middling power and guarantee the 2HKO on standard Relaxed Amoonguss. 0 Speed IVs help Gothitelle to move first under Trick Room. Sitrus Berry offers limited recovery, allowing Gothitelle to stay on the field and provide support for longer. A ChestoRest strategy, with Rest being used over Protect, is another option to help Gothitelle instantly restore back to full health, allowing it to recover the damage taken when first setting Trick Room so that it can be more easily set again later in the match. However, this does force Gothitelle to lose Protect or a second support move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Gothitelle is best used mid-game, when it can come in on Pokemon that threaten its team to trap and either KO or significantly weaken them. Getting Gothitelle onto the field via U-turn or free switches in particular helps conserve its precious HP and ensures that the opponent cannot switch out predicting a Gothitelle switch. After Trick Room is set, Gothitelle should mainly be using a support move or Protect unless it has trapped Pokemon such as Amoonguss that you really need to attack with it. Gothitelle. If Gothitelle is running Charm, it should try to trap the opponent's physical attackers and use Charm to render them dead weight, giving Gothitelle and its teammates a chance to set up, attack, or set Trick Room safely. Even if Gothitelle is low on health or crippled by status such as sleep, Shadow Tag is still great utility, and through the use of Protect and switching out if need be, as the opponent cannot hard switch out even on a turn when Gothitelle leaves the field, it can still be a great asset to its team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fake Out users such as Scrafty and Hariyama help Gothitelle to set Trick Room. Fighting-type Fake Out users can also hit the Dark- and Steel-types that trouble Gothitelle, such as Aegislash, Heatran, Bisharp, and Hydreigon, for super effective damage. Scrafty, as well as other Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Gyarados, also helps patch up Gothitelle's weaker Defense stat. In combination with Shadow Tag, these Pokemon can also be used for Intimidate shuffling to severely weaken the opponent's physical attackers. Gothitelle also appreciates partners that can remove Pokemon that give it trouble, such as Dark-types, Heatran, and Aegislash, with good options including Mega Camerupt, Hoopa-U, and Scrafty, which all work well under Trick Room as well. Strong Trick Room attackers such as Mega Camerupt and Mega Abomasnow can take advantage of the reversed move order and appreciate the support provided by Gothitelle. In particular, Gothitelle can trap Fire-types such as Heatran for other teammates to KO, giving Abomasnow a better time.</p> <p>Setup sweepers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Azumarill, and Volcarona all appreciate the benefits of Shadow Tag, as Gothitelle can trap foes that provide easy setup opportunities and can also help remove or significantly weaken threats to the setup user, such as by trapping Talonflame for Volcarona to attack unhampered. Using Heal Pulse is very effective for supporting these Pokemon's setup, with Azumarill especially appreciating the recovery due to Belly Drum's health cost. Weather setters such as Mega Abomasnow, Mega Charizard Y, and Politoed all receive large benefits from Gothitelle's ability to trap the opponent's weather setter and so win the weather war. This is particularly important for sun versus rain matchups, where the dominating weather can easily determine the winner of the match.</p> "

However, Reuniclus is also frail, leaving it vulnerable without proper support and positioning. In addition, its vulnerability to common priority attacks such as Sucker Punch and Talonflame's Brave Bird can leave it rather susceptible to losing momentum even after setting Trick Room.

In addition, Life Orb is vital for Reuniclus's damage output, which drops significantly if one runs Focus Sash. Helping Hand can be useful for when you forsee an incoming Fake Out, as it has higher priority.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psychic hits most threats neutrally besides Steel- and Dark-types such as Heatran, Aegislash, Jirachi, Hydreigon, and Scrafty and has a good chance to OHKO standard Amoonguss. Focus Blast lets Reuniclus hit those Steel- and Dark-types except for Jirachi and Aegislash for super effective damage. Shadow Ball is a good option for covering Aegislash and is guaranteed to break Substitutes from Steel-types like Heatran without having a 30% chance to miss. Trick Room allows slower Pokemon to take advantage of the reversed move order and put the opponent on the defensive for four turns. Protect is an all-around staple for Doubles Pokemon, allowing Reuniclus to avoid damage while its partner switches or attacks and is a good move for dodging Sucker Punch if you don't want to switch and Trick Room is already up.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs with a Quiet Nature enable Reuniclus to maximize its damage output. Minimizing Speed allows Reuniclus to get valuable Speed ties with Amoonguss, KOing it before it can put Reuniclus's partner to sleep, and also allowing Reuniclus to underspeed most things in the metagame. The distribution of the remaining EVs between HP, Special Defense, and Defense maximizes Reuniclus's bulk in the most efficient way possible, letting it survive Aegislash's Shadow Ball and giving it an extremely high chance of surviving Mega Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch, though only from full health, as well as giving it a nice Life Orb number.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avoid letting Reuniclus tank hits outside of Trick Room by positioning it such that your opponent can't double target Reuniclus down as it sets up Trick Room, such as by supporting Reuniclus with Fake Out or redirection. Take advantage of Reuniclus's strong offenses by simply attacking if the opponent will Taunt Reuniclus, such as with Keldeo or Thundurus, hitting them for a significant portion of their HP. When Trick Room is down, be conscious of whether or not you really want it to be back up; sometimes it can be better to simply attack rather than set up Trick Room, especially against slower threats such as Ferrothorn and Amoonguss or priority attackers such as Talonflame. Reuniclus is a good switch-in to status-inflicting moves such as Spore and Will-O-Wisp and Fighting-type attacks; however, almost everything else hits it neutrally and dents it too hard, making it difficult for it to set up Trick Room.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Reuniclus fits well on Trick Room teams, so Trick Room setters as well as Trick Room attackers are good partners and take advantage of the speed control provided. Bulky Ghost-type setters to fill in the \"one offensive and one defensive Trick Room setter\" composition, such as Jellicent and Gourgeist, are valuable options that provide a defensive backbone, allowing the team to absorb hits that Reuniclus can't. Fake Out support from Pokemon such as Scrafty and Hariyama, which complement Reuniclus's typing very well, helps set up Trick Room. Redirection from Amoonguss is valuable in helping Reuniclus set up Trick Room, drawing away hits that Reuniclus wishes to avoid. Checks to Aegislash, Hoopa-U, and Bisharp such as Mega Camerupt and Scrafty complement Reuniclus very well and enjoy the speed control offered by Trick Room. Other Trick Room attackers such as Rhyperior and Sylveon work well with Reuniclus, as they benefit from Reuniclus countering Grass-types such as Amoonguss.</p> "

  "Escavalier": {
    "overview": "<p>Escavalier possesses a good offensive typing and very low Speed, making it a great all-out attacker under Trick Room. In addition to its powerful dual STAB moves, it also has great coverage in the form of Knock Off and Drill Run. Its ability Overcoat allows it to easily switch into Spore and Sleep Powder users, as well as ignore redirection from Rage Powder. To top it off, its base 20 Speed makes it the slowest viable Trick Room attacker except for Mega Camerupt, which it Speed ties with. However, Escavalier's Speed severely hinders it outside of Trick Room, and its typing makes it extremely vulnerable to common Fire-types such as Charizard and Talonflame. Plus, like any physical attacker, it's susceptible to Intimidate and burns.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Assault Vest is the most widely used item besides the ones in the sample moveset. Even though it makes Escavalier more bulky, it prevents it from running Protect, which leaves it wide open for burns and doesn't make it enough of an offensive threat. A set with Swords Dance can make Escavalier a powerful setup sweeper under Trick Room. However, in order to run Swords Dance, it would have to give up either a coverage move or Protect, both of which are very crucial to Escavalier's viability.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Without Trick Room, Escavalier is vulnerable to every other threat in the metagame, as its low Speed means it always has to take an attack before it can move.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Escavalier is 4x weak to Fire, making Fire-types such as Heatran, Charizard, and Talonflame good counters to it. Heatran, however, can be OHKOed by Drill Run.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp users such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W severely cut Escavalier's power.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Megahorn and Iron Head are both strong STAB attacks that score a lot of OHKOs against threats such as Latios and Sylveon. Drill Run provides excellent coverage against opposing Steel-types such as Metagross and Heatran. Knock Off could be used over Drill Run, as it hits Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Hoopa-U, which Escavalier otherwise wouldn't be able to heavy damage to, as well as serving as a utility move to remove important items. Both are good options, and the choice depends on what your team would most benefit from. Protect rounds out the set to keep Escavalier safe while its partner sets up Trick Room or takes out a threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Escavalier runs maximum Attack investment and a Brave nature for as much damage output as possible, since it is an all-out-attacker. The HP EVs maximize its bulk, while minimizing Life Orb recoil. The remaining EVs can be put in either defensive stat. Life Orb gives Escavalier even more power. Lum Berry could also be used, as Escavalier is so vulnerable to burns. However, it causes it to lose a lot of power. Like any Trick Room Pokemon, Escavalier should be running a 0 Speed IV to ensure it moves first under Trick Room.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Using Trick Room is a near-requirement for Escavalier. With Trick Room up, it can outspeed every notable threat in the metagame. After Trick Room expires, Escavalier becomes much less threatening, so it should ideally only be on the field when the field condition is up. It should be noted that Escavalier's coverage moves are only useful under Trick Room or on the switch, as threats such as Heatran will outspeed and OHKO it otherwise. Knock Off and Drill Run can be used to check Aegislash; however, if either of those moves makes contact with King's Shield, Escavalier's Attack will drop severely, so be careful. Thanks to Overcoat, Escavalier can freely switch into Spore and Sleep Powder users such as Amoonguss, Breloom, and Venusaur. Lastly, due to Escavalier's 4x weakness to Fire-type moves, all users of these attacks should be properly dealt with before Escavalier is brought onto the field.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Escavalier thrives in Trick Room, so setters such as Cresselia and Jellicent make for good partners. Cresselia can also handle opposing Fighting-types for Escavalier and use Safeguard to protect the team from burns. Escavalier in return can do heavy damage against any Dark-type that threatens Cresselia. Fire-type checks are required to counter Escavalier's weakness; good options include Azumarill and Suicune. Additionally, because of this Fire-type weakness, Escavalier can function well on a rain team with Politoed, serving as a good offensive pivot and Trick Room counter. This is ideally the only time Escavalier shouldn't be on a semi- or full Trick Room team. Escavalier is very vulnerable to Intimidate, so checks to common Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Scrafty are much appreciated. Some good examples include Thundurus and Sylveon. Escavalier also struggles against bulky Water-types, so Electric-types such as Thundurus, Rotom-W, and Zapdos work well. Lastly, Pokemon with Rock typing or coverage like Mega Diancie and Landorus-T work well with Escavalier as a means to check Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y. Terrakion can also be used to check Heatran.</p> "

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<p>Amoonguss is one of the best supporting Pokemon in Doubles, with the ability to control momentum through redirection and immobilization tactics. Access to Rage Powder lets Amoonguss redirect dangerous attacks away from its partner, and with the help of Regenerator and its great defenses, Amoonguss can afford to take lots of hits. In addition to this, Amoonguss has great defensive typing, resisting common attacking types like Water, Fighting, Electric, and Fairy, which allows it to check big threats like Keldeo, Azumarill, Rotom-W, and Terrakion. Amoonguss is especially valuable because it works during any period of the match and is rarely dead weight. Even in the rare situation where Amoonguss isn't useful, it regains health by switching out. Thanks to Spore and its low Speed, Amoonguss works especially well both as a check to Trick Room teams and as a member of Trick Room teams, usually moving first and putting foes to sleep without the threat of Sleep Clause. Although Amoonguss has a lot going for it, it has very little offensive presence, so it needs to be partnered with an offensive Pokemon in order to do its job. Amoonguss also struggles against opposing Grass-types.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sludge Bomb can be used over Giga Drain for a better matchup against Grass-types like Breloom, but that makes Amoonguss lose both the possibility of recovery and its great matchup against bulky Water-types like Suicune. Foul Play can be used over Giga Drain to punish physical attackers like Power-Up Punch Mega Kangaskhan more effectively, but it's very situational. Sunny Day further improves Amoonguss's matchup against rain teams, and can help out a partner such as Heatran by giving its Fire-type attacks a boost. Protect can be forgone in favor of one of the above attacking moves considering Amoonguss can likely take whatever attacks it would be avoiding anyway, but this leaves it much more vulnerable, especially when it is revealed that Amoonguss doesn't carry Protect. Mental Herb can stop Taunt from ruining Amoonguss's day, but it's single use and typically not enough to outweigh the benefits of Sitrus Berry. Black Sludge can be used for turn-by-turn recovery, but due to Doubles OU's fast-paced nature, Amoonguss is rarely on the field long enough for it to provide more healing than a Sitrus Berry. If your team has particular trouble with Fire-types or Flying-types, Amoonguss can run an Occa Berry or a Coba Berry to gain the ability to survive one attack and, usually, put the foe to sleep. However, these are fairly specialized items, and Rocky Helmet or Sitrus Berry generally proves more useful.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Mega Charizard-Y and Heatran can deal massive damage to Amoonguss and are able to effectively ignore Rage Powder thanks to Heat Wave. Mega Camerupt can underspeed Amoonguss under Trick Room and take it out.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon: Kyurem-B and Weavile can take out Amoonguss with their respective Ice-type moves, the former also able to set up a Substitute on Amoonguss for free.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon: Hoopa-U, Deoxys-A, and Mega Metagross are all capable of hitting Amoonguss hard with a super effective STAB move, the first two strong enough to nab the OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame: Talonflame can hit Amoonguss hard with both of its STAB moves and has a good chance of OHKOing.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon are immune to Spore and Rage Powder and take little damage from Giga Drain. However, they are typically hardpressed to do much to Amoonguss themselves.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Substitute</strong>: Taunt shuts down Amoonguss's main functions on the field, preventing it from using Spore, Rage Powder, or Protect. Substitute blocks Amoonguss's Spore, and the two most common users, Heatran and Kyurem-B, can do lots of damage in return.</p> <p><strong>Spread Attacks</strong>: Even if they don't do much damage to Amoonguss, spread moves prevent it from redirecting attacks. Some examples include Mega Gardevoir's Hyper Voice, Mega Diancie's Diamond Storm, and Landorus-T's Rock Slide. Spread utility moves like Icy Wind and Snarl also hurt Amoonguss's partner's effectiveness.</p> <p><strong>Safety Goggles and Overcoat: Safety Goggles users such as Cresselia and Jirachi and Pokemon with Overcoat such as Reuniclus are immune to Spore and Rage Powder, and most of them take little damage from Amoonguss's attacking options.</p> ",
    "sets": [

        "name": "Rage Powder",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rage Powder removes offensive pressure from Amoonguss's partner, allowing it to attack an opposing threat or set up without worry of taking damage. Spore puts a foe to sleep, immobilizing it and reducing the two-on-two scenario to two-on-one. Giga Drain allows Amoonguss to not entirely be Taunt bait and allows it to check Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Terrakion. It also restores some health, which is great for such a defensively oriented Pokemon. Protect allows Amoonguss to scout for attacks or protect itself when you predict a double target.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rocky Helmet is used in order to punish physical attackers, dealing damage with every hit. This is especially nice against Mega Kangaskhan, against which it deals twice as much damage due to Parental Bond, and Focus Sash users that make contact like Breloom, Bisharp, and Terrakion, as it breaks their Focus Sashes. A Sitrus Berry can be a useful alternative on Amoonguss, giving it more health to work with against any attack that does not outright KO it and allowing it to use Rage Powder more freely. 252 HP and 172 Defense EVs and a Relaxed nature allow Amoonguss to always survive a Jolly Mega Metagross's Zen Headbutt. The rest of the EVs are placed into Special Defense to help Amoonguss survive attacks such as a Kyurem-B's Ice Beam. A Speed-decreasing nature and a 0 Speed IV are chosen to give Amoonguss a better Trick Room matchup, and with a base Speed stat of 30 it isn't going to be outspeeding anything outside of Trick Room anyway. An alternate spread of 240 HP / 216 Def / 52 SpD and a Sassy Nature allows Amoonguss to withstand standard Mega Gardevoir's Psychic, which has a chance to OHKO the listed spread. Amoonguss often gets low on health amidst redirection and switching into attacks for the team, but Regenerator allows it to maintain its HP by healing a third of its health when it switches out. This enables Rocky Helmet Amoonguss in particular to have reliable ways to recover health even though it lacks a Sitrus Berry.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Using Amoonguss is fairly straightforward; use Spore against Trick Room setters that aren't immune to it, on predicted switches, and while Amoonguss's partner is protecting itself. Use Giga Drain when Amoonguss has been Taunted or when it is super effective and Amoonguss's partner isn't in danger. Use Protect against Fake Out or if the opponent is likely to double target Amoonguss and your other Pokemon can knock out one of the threats. Otherwise, use Rage Powder to redirect non-threatening moves to Amoonguss and allow its partner to move safely, whether it be setting up or attacking. Keep in mind, however, that Rage Powder and Spore do not affect Grass-types, Safety Goggles users, and Pokemon with Overcoat. Amoonguss works well throughout the match, neutralizing big threats with Spore early-game, aiding setup and better positioning during the mid-game, and easing the pressure on its teammates during cleanup in the end-game. Keep in mind that switching Amoonguss out of a dangerous situation has the benefit of restoring its health, so if Amoonguss is highly pressured and a safe switch is available, switching out is often the best option.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Amoonguss struggles to take multiple super effective hits and appreciates teammates that can hurt threats like Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, Mega Gardevoir, and Talonflame. Pokemon with Rock-type attacks can hurt the Flying-, Fire-, and Ice-type Pokemon that scare Amoonguss, so Terrakion, Landorus-T, and Mega Diancie are all good choices. Amoonguss also helps them in return by redirecting Hydro Pumps, Close Combats, Flash Cannons, and any non-STAB Grass-type moves. Amoonguss does a great job at aiding setup, so boosting Pokemon that don't share its weaknesses, such as Azumarill, have a much easier time with Amoonguss on the field. Substitute users such as Heatran and Kyurem-B have a much easier time getting up a Substitute with Amoonguss around to redirect attacks. Amoonguss works extremely well under Trick Room with its low Speed stat, so Trick Room attackers make for great partners. For example, Mega Camerupt removes the Grass-types that shut down Amoonguss while Amoonguss returns the favor against Water-types. In a similar vein, Cresselia, Hoopa-U, and Jellicent help Amoonguss by setting up Trick Room and beating threats to its success. Amoonguss has almost no offensive presence itself, so it needs partners that can pressure the opposing team offensively. Thus, any offensively oriented pokemon that doesn't share too many weaknesses with Amoonguss is a good teammate.</p> "

  "Jellicent": {
    "overview": "<p>With respectable defensive stats, Jellicent fills the role of a bulky supporter quite well. With its combination of good bulk, a strong typing, and Water Absorb, Jellicent can switch into and wall quite a few Pokemon. Access to Cursed Body allows it to disrupt opposing attackers effectively. Jellicent fits best on Trick Room teams, as its Ghost typing prevents it from getting hit with non-Scrappy Fake Out, allowing it to set up Trick Room more easily. Moreover, Jellicent is capable of taking on a fair portion of the metagame such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Metagross, Mega Diancie, and other physical attackers. It also completely walls most Water-type Pokemon, such as Keldeo. On the downside, while Jellicent has good special bulk, it's held back by its mediocre physical bulk. It also has no real offensive presence even with Hydro Pump or Water Spout.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shadow Ball could be used as a surprise option to assist with teams weak to Aegislash. Water Spout is a cool option due to the possible damage output, but it could potentially useless, as Jellicent may be required to repeatedly use Recover just to put out near-respectable damage, wasting Trick Room turns. Jellicent is also bulky enough to use Disable, being able to take a hit and potentially take away the foe's best move. Hex is a good Ghost-type STAB move in combination with Will-O-Wisp. Blizzard is another move that can be utilized in conjunction with Abomasnow, but should not be used outside of that. Leftovers improves Jellicent's durability should it have to stall out the opposing team. Mental Herb is an option to bypass Taunt once and be guaranteed to set up Trick Room. Colbur Berry can also be used to take Knock Off easily before burning the Knock Off user.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Pokemon such as Thundurus, Zapdos, and Rotom-W are all able to 2HKO Jellicent, while Jellicent cannot do much in response.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Mega Venusaur is a hard counter to Jellicent, as the best it can do is burn Mega Venusaur and stall for one or two turns if forced to stay on the field, and Breloom can significantly damage Jellicent with Bullet Seed. Amoonguss can take any attack from Jellicent handily and punish back with Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Aegislash at least Speed ties with Jellicent and 2HKOes it, while the best Jellicent can do back is burn Aegislash and possibly stall it. Gengar can hit Jellicent hard with Shadow Ball and Taunt it to prevent Trick Room from going up.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Darkrai also fare very well against Jellicent, with Hydreigon walling it entirely. Bisharp completely counters Jellicent with its only option being to burn it with Will-O-Wisp, but Jellicent will usually not be able to do so. Hoopa-U can OHKO Jellicent through Protect as well.</p> <p><strong>Mega Charizard Y: Mega Charizard Y can reduce the power of Jellicent's Water-type moves and 2HKO it with Solar Beam.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore</strong>: When Taunted, Jellicent will only be able to use damaging moves, preventing it from performing its main role of setting up Trick Room. Prankster Encore Whimsicott can lock Jellicent into Trick Room, reversing the effects of the move.</p> ",

        "name": "Bulky Trick Room Setter",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Trick Room provides Jellicent's team with speed control. Hydro Pump is a strong offensive option if Jellicent is your team's preferred lead. Scald can be a bit more reliable at times, and its burn chance can cause headaches as well. Scald can prove to be a viable option for teams that are especially physically frail or lack Intimidate users, as a Scald burn will cripple any physical attacker. Will-O-Wisp also neuters physical attackers and gives Jellicent an option to counteract Sucker Punch. Recover assists with keeping Jellicent healthy in the long run, which also helps it stall out the opposing team if necessary. Protect can keep Jellicent safe while its partner deals with opposing threats to Jellicent, potentially allowing it to set up Trick Room.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread and a Relaxed nature capitalize on Jellicent's solid bulk, allowing it to avoid the OHKO from super effective moves such as Life Orb Hydreigon's Dark Pulse, Aegislash's Shadow Ball, offensive Thundurus's Thunderbolt, and Ferrothorn's Power Whip, as well as avoid the 2HKO from Landorus-T's Earthquake. Recover is useful for stalling out and baiting hits continuously. Protect is used primarily to scout out the opponents moves, as well as double targets, allowing Jellicent's partner to handle opposing Pokemon. With the combination of its Water typing, Will-O-Wisp, Recover, and possibly Water Absorb, Jellicent is capable of walling a fair portion of the metagame, particularly Fighting- and Water-types. Cursed Body is useful as well, as it can disable a foe's primary attack and heavily shift momentum in your favor. Safety Goggles are used as a way to safely set up Trick Room against opposing Spore-users, in particular Amoonguss which is a common check to Trick Room. A Sitrus Berry can be used as means to recover HP and can allow Jellicent to live an extra attack, which can often swing the course of a battle.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Jellicent is best used as a lead Trick Room setter, as most Pokemon cannot use Fake Out on it, which allows it to set up Trick Room easily. Due to its bulk and typing, Jellicent is a great stop to Mega Kangaskhan; it can also deal with other important threats before committing to stalling out the opposing team. If using Amoonguss as a sleep inducer, be conscious about whether it would be more effective to burn the foe or put it to sleep. If using Cursed Body, don't be afraid to use Recover liberally in order to disable key moves. Will-O-Wisp thwarts Mega Mawile's and Mega Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch, making them significantly less threatening.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon such as Scrafty offer Fake Out support, which makes it much easier for Jellicent to set up Trick Room. Mega Camerupt takes advantage of both Trick Room and Jellicent's Water Absorb quite well, with Trick Room capitalizing on its extremely low Speed and Water Absorb covering its 4x weakness to Water. In return, Mega Camerupt can take out Grass-types that would otherwise threaten Jellicent. Hoopa-U is a cool team option to beat Aegislash. It also helps out Trick Room teams with its ability to break through foes that use Protect. Ferrothorn is a great partner that forms a nice Fire / Water / Grass core with Mega Camerupt that's fairly hard to take down. Both Rhydon and Rhyperior provide great physical bulk, helping make up for Jellicent's low Defense. They can also redirect Electric-type moves for Jellicent with Lightning Rod, and they can beat most Electric-types save for Rotom-W effortlessly. In return, Jellicent provides them with an amazing Water-type switch-in and can patch up their terrible Speed with Trick Room. Sylveon benefits from Will-O-Wisp with its poor Defense and helps against all Dark-type Pokemon, which are pretty threatening to Jellicent. Diancie can beat foes such as Mega Charizard Y and Thundurus, can be a secondary Trick Room setter to ease Jellicent's load, and beats Dark-types. Redirection from Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Togekiss can buy free turns in order to set up Trick Room and spread Will-O-Wisp. Both of them also provide useful resistances such as Grass and Electric with Amoonguss and can offensively threaten Pokemon that Jellicent struggles with, with Togekiss beating Grass-types and Amoonguss wrecking Water-types. Mega Abomasnow works well under Trick Room and has good defensive synergy with Jellicent, dealing with Grass-types while Jellicent takes on Fire- and Fighting-types. If Jellicent is used on a full Trick Room team, it is nearly always recommended to bring a second Trick Room setter, such as Cresselia.</p> "

Ferrothorn also poses a decent threat as an attacker thanks to its respectable Attack stat and powerful STAB attacks in Power Whip and Gyro Ball. Its low Speed is a mixed bag; it makes Ferrothorn a notable threat under Trick Room but leaves it the slowest Pokemon in the entire metagame outside of it. Moreover, Ferrothorn has a glaring weakness to Steel- and Fire-types, as it can't threaten them with any attack, making it setup bait for Substitute users such as Heatran and Aegislash; also, its 4x weakness to Fire leaves it easily forced out by the numerous Fire-types in the metagame such as Mega Charizard Y, Volcanion, and Heatran.</p> ",

The rest of the EVs are invested into Attack, which, in conjunction with a Brave nature, maximizes Ferrothorn's offensive presence. 0 Speed IVs should be used in order to maximize Gyro Ball's damage output and make Ferrothorn's matchup against Trick Room better. Leftovers is used in order to boost Ferrothorn's longevity with passive recovery, making it harder to take down, especially if Leech Seed is also in play. Rocky Helmet is also a useful item, allowing Ferrothorn to punish contact attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan harder than it would with just Iron Barbs.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Ferrothorn should be picked mostly for its ability to supplement the defensive backbone of any team with its wide array of resistances and high bulk. It excels at switching into physical attacks, particularly those that make contact because of its Iron Barbs ability, which enables it to punish attackers like Mega Kangaskhan and Azumarill, especially if it's using Rocky Helmet. Ferrothorn also works well as a pivot, being useful for taking a hit as necessary for its team. Once opposing Fire- and Fighting-types have been dealt with, Ferrothorn can function as a wincon by simply stalling out foes with Leech Seed and Protect, generally healing more HP than it is losing.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that have trouble against Water-types such as Mega Diancie and Heatran appreciate Ferrothorn's ability to deal with them with ease. Teammates that can deal with opposing Fire-types are good to have; Water-types such as Keldeo, Volcanion, and Politoed can take out most Fire-type threats, with the latter even bringing rain to neuter them, while Landorus-T can take Fire-types out with either Earthquake or Rock Slide. Fighting- and Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, and Volcanion, as well as Landorus-T, are also handy to have in order to take out the Steel-types that wall Ferrothorn.</p> "

  "Chandelure": {
    "overview": "<p>Armed with high Special Attack, Ghost / Fire STAB coverage that has Hydreigon as its only viable switch-in, a strong spread attack in Heat Wave, and an immunity to Fake Out, Chandelure makes for a decent offensive Trick Room setter. Thanks to its sizable base 145 Special Attack, Chandelure can handily function as an attacker after Trick Room is up. Chandelure's decent typing and immunity to Fire-type moves thanks to Flash Fire also give it plenty of chances to switch in and beat threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Amoonguss, and Breloom.</p> <p>However, Chandelure's typing also makes it vulnerable to common Trick Room counters such as Bisharp and Hoopa-U. Chandelure's paltry defenses, even with maximum HP investment, and weaknesses to common attacking types in Water, Ground, Rock, and Dark also leave it easy to take down. In addition, common priority moves such as Aqua Jet, Sucker Punch, and Brave Bird can easily pick off Chandelure while also ignoring Trick Room. Chandelure's biggest con, however, is its unreliability at setting Trick Room on its own, relegating its usage to only full Trick Room teams, where it faces heavy competition from other setters such as Jellicent and Reuniclus.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A non-Trick Room special attacking set can be used to take advantage of Chandelure's high Special Attack and decent Speed, but it is often outclassed by Heatran which has better bulk and defensive typing. Will-O-Wisp can be handy to neuter physically attacking foes such as Mega Kangaskhan. Energy Ball can be nifty to hit Water- and Rock-types such as Azumarill and Mega Diancie for surprise damage. Hidden Power Ground can be used to hit Heatran hard and is especially useful with Infiltrator to hit through Substitute. Safety Goggles can block Spore and Sleep Powder, immensely improving Chandelure's matchup against Amoonguss. Colbur Berry allows Chandelure to take a Dark-type attack from the likes of Bisharp and Hoopa-U, which are big threats to Trick Room teams. Overheat is an option to hit a foe for major damage, with Fire Blast being a slightly weaker alternative that doesn't drop Chandelure's Special Attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Offensive Rock-types such as Mega Diancie and Terrakion outspeed Chandelure and threaten it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Hydreigon resists Chandelure's STAB moves, outspeeds it, and can hit it back super effectively, and Scrafty resists Shadow Ball and has the bulk to take a few Heat Waves, letting it easily hit back with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Water-types such as Suicune, Ludicolo, and Rotom-W can cause issues, as they can easily take a couple of Shadow Balls and hit back with their STAB moves. Suicune can also use Snarl to lower Chandelure's Special Attack. Gyarados can set up Dragon Dances or simply take Chandelure out with Waterfall, and Keldeo can easily KO it with Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Strong Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Landorus-I threaten Chandelure with their powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt from the likes of Thundurus and Gyarados can stop Trick Room from being set, preventing Chandelure from doing its role.</p> <p><strong>Sleep: Breloom can prevent Chandelure from setting Trick Room by putting it to sleep with Spore. Amoonguss can do the same and is faster once Trick Room is up. They both have to watch out for Heat Wave though.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room: Opposing Trick Room setters can reset Trick Room against Chandelure, effectively ruining its form of speed control.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks</strong>: Priority moves, such as Aqua Jet from Azumarill, Sucker Punch from Bisharp, and Brave Bird from Talonflame, threaten Chandelure both in and out of Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Sand and hail break Chandelure's Focus Sash, and rain dampens its Fire-type STAB moves.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Heat Wave is a strong spread Fire-type STAB move that hits a good portion of the metagame for good damage. Shadow Ball covers threats such as Cresselia, Latios, and Mega Gardevoir, hits a single target, unlike Heat Wave, and deals more damage. Trick Room reverses the Speed tiers, letting slower teammates move first. Protect shields Chandelure from damage, lets it stall out field conditions, and helps it obtain a more favorable position.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Focus Sash prevents the foe from simply OHKOing Chandelure before it sets up Trick Room. A Quiet nature with maximum HP and Special Attack investment gives Chandelure maximum bulk while also giving it as much damage potential as possible. Flash Fire gives Chandelure an effective immunity to Fire and strengthens its own Fire-type attacks after taking one itself, while Infiltrator lets Chandelure ignore Substitute, allowing it to effectively deal with Pokemon such as Aegislash, a big threat to Trick Room teams, and Kyurem-B.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Chandelure should only really be used on full Trick Room as the second choice for a Trick Room setter, bringing its offensive prowess to the table, as it can't really carry the burden of consistently setting up Trick Room alone. Chandelure makes for a great lead in order to get Trick Room up early, with its immunity to Fake Out being handy and setting it apart from other Trick Room users. If faced with an obvious Taunt or Spore, it's usually better to just attack, as Heat Wave will do decent damage to Amoonguss and Breloom and Shadow Ball can take out the likes of Gyarados and Thundurus. Resetting Trick Room is not recommended when the opponent has a slower threat, such as Amoonguss, on the field, as it's simply better to attack and beat such threats. Switching Chandelure out to preserve its ability to set up Trick Room can, at times, prove to be key, provided the opponent has a Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y or Mega Kangaskhan that Chandelure can switch into.</p> <p>After setting up Trick Room, Chandelure should simply attack with either Heat Wave or Shadow Ball, making use of its Speed advantage and high Special Attack. If the opponent has a Wide Guard user or a Pokemon with Flash Fire waiting in the back, Shadow Ball should be used instead of Heat Wave in order to avoid getting blocked or taken advantage of, respectively. Beware of priority users, as they can simply ignore Trick Room and hit through Chandelure's paltry defenses.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>A Fake Out user is great to pair with a Trick Room setter, as, combined with Chandelure's Focus Sash, only Taunt and sleep-inducing moves can prevent Trick Room from getting up. Hariyama and Scrafty work well, with Scrafty also providing Intimidate and Hariyama boasting access to Wide Guard, which is useful for shielding Chandelure from Rock Slide and Earthquake; in addition, both are slow enough to take advantage of Trick Room themselves. Grass-types appreciate Chandelure's ability to deter Fire-type attacks with Flash Fire and can deal with Water-type foes quite well; Amoonguss can use Rage Powder to keep Chandelure safe and use Spore against most foes at will in Trick Room, and Ferrothorn can simply remove the likes of Azumarill, Rotom-W, and Mega Diancie with Power Whip. Various Mega Evolutions can effectively utilize Trick Room with their low Speed and high power; Mega Abomasnow can beat Water-types that Chandelure has problems with, and Mega Camerupt has incredible attacking power and great bulk, but its typing overlaps with Chandelure's. Other Trick Room setters, such as Cresselia and Reuniclus, are recommended, as Chandelure can't reliably keep up Trick Room for its team throughout the match by itself.</p> "

  "Bisharp": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to an excellent ability, high Attack, and dangerous STAB moves, Bisharp has no problem threatening opposing teams. Defiant is one of the best abilities in the metagame because it punishes common Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Gyarados for switching in, as well as letting Bisharp take advantage of moves such as Icy Wind and Snarl for free Attack boosts. Knock Off makes Bisharp very difficult to switch into while dealing large amounts of damage, and Sucker Punch lets it take out frailer Pokemon and helps compensate for its middling Speed. While Bisharp does suffer from frailness coupled with weaknesses to common Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks, these issues are not enough to stop it from being an excellent attacker.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Low Kick is an option over Iron Head to hit Heatran super effectively, but other than that, Iron Head is better. Also, Swords Dance is an option, as it makes Bisharp even more threatening, and the boosts can't be lowered by Intimidate thanks to Defiant. The listed set is by far the most generally effective one on Bisharp, though, so one should be wary of deviating from it. Choice Band is an option to make Bisharp's attacks even more devastating, but being locked into a move can make Bisharp easy to take advantage of. Choice Scarf is also an option to surprise people expecting a slower set with a powerful hit. Stone Edge is notable on such sets to OHKO Mega Charizard Y, which expects to outspeed and OHKO Bisharp. Lum Berry can be used to cure burns that would cripple Bisharp, but a Life Orb is typically more useful.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Fighting-types such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and Conkeldurr can easily OHKO Bisharp. Mach Punch users such as Conkeldurr and Breloom are especially threatening because they can hit Bisharp before it can use Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Volcarona can all OHKO Bisharp with Heat Wave, although they have trouble switching into it.</p> <p><strong>Burns: Pokemon that commonly carry Will-O-Wisp, such as Rotom-W and Talonflame, can neuter Bisharp's offensive presence by burning it, although they might take heavy damage in the process.</p> <p><strong>Substitute: Faster Pokemon with Substitute such as Heatran and Kyurem-B can potentially be good Bisharp checks, as Substitute lets them play around Sucker Punch as needed.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off is notable for being both more powerful and more reliable than Sucker Punch while also stripping opposing Pokemon of their items, making Bisharp hard to switch into. Sucker Punch is for Pokemon that outspeed Bisharp, allowing it to pick them off before they can strike. However, the fact that it fails when the opponent isn't attacking makes it easier to play around than Knock Off, so when facing a Pokemon that Bisharp outspeeds, it's usually safer to go with Knock Off. Iron Head is a secondary STAB attack that's mainly used when Bisharp encounters something that resists its Dark-type attacks or you're relying on a flinch. Protect is used to shield Bisharp from damage, which is especially useful because a strong attack will often put it out of commission.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb is chosen to augment Bisharp's already high Attack to deal as much damage as possible, making it into an even more threatening attacker. The EVs give Bisharp as much power as possible, with an Adamant nature chosen over Jolly because Bisharp doesn't really need the extra Speed. Defiant allows Bisharp to get free Attack boosts from users of the very common Intimidate and Icy Wind. Focus Sash is an option because Bisharp has a lot of weaknesses and isn't very bulky.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bisharp makes for a great Trick Room check because it can hit most Trick Room setters super effectively, KOing them before they can set it up. Sucker Punch should be used to pick off fast, frail threats on the opposing team. However, if Bisharp outspeeds a Pokemon and you want to use a Dark-type attack, go with Knock Off, as it's more powerful and reliable. If there are other Pokemon on your team that dislike Intimidate, using Bisharp to dissuade the opponent from switching in their Intimidate users is a good idea. Try to avoid letting Bisharp take any hits it doesn't need to, as its frailness coupled with Life Orb recoil means that any extra hits will hamper its effectiveness. It can be a good idea to save Bisharp for late-game so it can clean up weakened teams with high-powered Sucker Punches. While this play can be risky, it's possible to switch Bisharp in on a predicted Icy Wind, Electroweb, or Snarl and get a +2 Attack boost from Defiant while taking very little damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Strong physical attackers such as Landorus-T and Mega Kangaskhan appreciate Bisharp's ability to threaten Intimidate users. Psychic-, Fairy-, and Ghost-types such as Togekiss, Latios, and Gengar make for good partners because they can switch into Fighting-type attacks for Bisharp. Slower Pokemon such as Amoonguss appreciate that Bisharp can check faster threats with Sucker Punch. Faster Pokemon such as Terrakion and Keldeo like having Bisharp around because it can threaten most Trick Room setters. Terrakion also makes a particularly good partner because it can threaten Mega Charizard Y and Heatran, both of which can KO Bisharp. Similarly, Mega Diancie can OHKO Mega Charizard Y and Heatran while also threatening the Fighting-types that Bisharp fears, and appreciates Bisharp's ability to keep Landorus-T from switching in. Partners that can redirect powerful hits for Bisharp such as Togekiss or Amoonguss are good to have. Amoonguss also appreciates how Bisharp can threaten the Psychic-types that prey on it, and it has Spore to put a threatening Pokemon out of commission. Speed control from a Pokemon such as Thundurus, Cresselia, or Talonflame is useful because Bisharp is even more threatening when it doesn't need to rely on Sucker Punch to handle faster Pokemon. Flying-types such as Talonflame make for good partners to Bisharp because they can decimate Fighting-types. Wide Guard users such as Aegislash are good partners because they can shield Bisharp from Heat Waves and Earthquakes that would otherwise KO it.</p> "

  "Hydreigon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hydreigon packs a great Special Attack stat which ties in nicely with its vast array of coverage choices. Hydreigon's Dark typing sets it apart from other Dragon-type Pokemon, as it can handle Pokemon such as Cresselia, Aegislash, and Bisharp better. Hydreigon can also support its team with Tailwind. Levitate makes Hydreigon immune to Earthquake, which, in conjunction with its typing and decent natural bulk, gives it quite a few switch-in opportunities. The biggest drawback to Hydreigon is its base 98 Speed. Because of it, Hydreigon finds itself slower than a variety of common offensive threats such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Charizard X, and Terrakion, so its team needs more speed control. Another drawback is the Special Attack drop caused by using Draco Meteor.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Chople Berry can be used to lure Pokemon like Terrakion and Keldeo, whilst Haban can be used to handle faster Dragon-type Pokemon. Focus Blast hits Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, as well as Steel-types, though its low accuracy can prove to be problematic. Hydreigon can use Thunder Wave to cripple switch-ins and support its teammates. With Substitute, Hydreigon can become a problematic threat; however, the loss of coverage and team support makes this undesirable. With a Choice Scarf, Hydreigon can act as a pivot with U-turn and snipe Dragon-type Pokemon such as Latios with Draco Meteor. Flamethrower is a weaker but more accurate option over Fire Blast, and Heat Wave, despite being the weakest of the three, can be used to hit both opponents. Flash Cannon and Iron Tail hit Fairy-type threats super effectively. Through the use of Choice Specs, Hydreigon can boost its damage output to very high levels and break bulky Pokemon much more easily.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Fairy-type Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon easily tear through Hydreigon. Azumarill is a notable example as it resists all of Hydreigon's common attacks and can OHKO it with Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Faster Dragon-type Pokemon such as Latios and Salamence can take Hydreigon out with ease.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Bulky Fighting-types such as Assault Vest Conkeldurr and Hitmontop can sponge a hit and OHKO back, whilst faster Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion can outspeed and OHKO Hydreigon.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Faster threats with super effective coverage, such as Mega Diancie, Latios, Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, can easily force out Hydreigon. Having a lower Speed puts Hydreigon at risk from Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Gardevoir, and Volcarona as well.</p> ",

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is an extremely powerful attack that can hugely dent, if not outright KO, opposing Pokemon. This move should not be used randomly, though, as Hydreigon will almost certainly have to switch out after this move has been used due to the Special Attack drop. Dark Pulse is a weaker secondary STAB move that hits common Trick Room setters such as Cresselia and Slowbro for super effective damage. Unlike Draco Meteor, Dark Pulse has no drawbacks, so it can be used repeatedly, allowing Hydreigon to stay in for longer. Fire Blast has good coverage with Dragon-type attacks, hitting bulky Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur. Earth Power is another option for the third slot. Although it has slightly less Base Power, it hits Steel-types for super effective damage, nails Diancie on the switch, and deals more damage on average due to higher Base Power and better general coverage than Flash Cannon. If your team can cover the Pokemon that Fire Blast and Earth Power are supposed to hit, Tailwind is also an option for the third slot. With Hydreigon's passable defenses, it can tank a hit and set up Tailwind, providing speed control that gives your team momentum. Protect is good for wasting your opponent's turn and for playing mind games, allowing Hydreigon's partner to strike hard and possibly net a KO while Hydreigon protects itself from the attacks of the opposing Pokemon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack and Speed EVs allow Hydreigon to hit hard and fast, while the remaining 4 EVs are thrown into Special Defense. Modest is usually the better nature because it allows Hydreigon to hit as hard as possible. A Timid nature can be used to Speed tie with opposing Hydreigon and allows Hydreigon to outspeed anything below base 97 Speed. A Timid nature also allows Hydreigon to outspeed Adamant Mega Kangaskhan and other neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon, though Hydreigon can only 2HKO Mega Kangaskhan, not to mention that Mega Kangaskhan will have a partner helping her. Life Orb allows Hydreigon to hit as hard as possible while still being able to change moves without switching out.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hydreigon can be used early-game to KO a threat to your team with Draco Meteor, and later on it can be used to pick off opposing Pokemon with Dark Pulse and other coverage moves. If Draco Meteor deals more than 66% to the foe, use it again to net a KO rather than immediately switching out. Hydreigon performs well against bulky offense teams because of its decent bulk and high power. Common Pokemon on said teams, such as Heatran and Ferrothorn, struggle to deal any meaningful damage to Hydreigon, while Hydreigon can OHKO Heatran with Earth Power and deal heavy damage to Ferrothorn with Fire Blast. Hydreigon also has a good matchup against Trick Room teams because few setters like to take hits from it. Dark Pulse hits the majority of Trick Room setters, such as Cresselia, Slowbro, and Chandelure, for super effective damage, and those that aren't hit super effectively are usually 2HKOed by Earth Power. Despite Hydreigon's good defensive typing and bulk, try to only switch it in on weaker resisted hits such as Thunderbolt from Rotom-W or Thundurus.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Aegislash is a great partner for Hydreigon due to their near-perfect offensive and defensive synergy. Aegislash can deal with Mega Gardevoir, Sylveon, and Mega Diancie with Flash Cannon, use Wide Guard to stop common spread moves such as Rock Slide and Hyper Voice, and easily switch into powerful Fighting- and Dragon-type moves such as Keldeo's Secret Sword and opposing Draco Meteor. Aegislash also beats Mega Metagross one-on-one, which is important because Hydreigon loses to Mega Metagross if it carries Hammer Arm. Offensive Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Heatran, and the previously mentioned Aegislash are good partners because they can deal with pesky Fairies that would otherwise demolish Hydreigon, and Hydreigon can easily switch in on many of their weaknesses in return. Bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn can take many hits that Hydreigon would not want to take. Just watch out for Fighting-type moves, which hit both Hydreigon and bulky Steel-types for super effective damage. Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon can switch in on and demolish the Fighting-types that give Hydreigon trouble, and Hydreigon can weaken or KO most of their checks with Draco Meteor, Dark Pulse, and Earth Power in return. Mega Gardevoir can use Ally Switch as a form of redirection because it can eat up Draco Meteor and Close Combat, while Hydreigon can tank Shadow Ball and Steel-type moves for Mega Gardevoir with relative ease. Redirectors such as Jirachi, Togekiss, and Amoonguss help Hydreigon switch in for free so that it may use Draco Meteor. Landorus-T can beat Mega Diancie, can safely use Earthquake next to Hydreigon because of Hydreigon's Levitate, and has Intimidate to weaken the foes' Attack, augmenting Hydreigon's physical bulk. Fake Out support from Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan can help Hydreigon net KOs that it would narrowly miss out on under normal circumstances. Fake Out support can also help Hydreigon set up Tailwind if you opt to run it. With Thunder Wave and Icy Wind, Thundurus and Cresselia help out with Hydreigon's Speed. Cresselia is an especially good partner due to her good type synergy with Hydreigon and her ability to set up Trick Room for semi-Trick Room teams, which Hydreigon shines on.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydreigon has spectacular resistances to a vast amount of the metagame but is normally vulnerable to chip damage if it's played defensively. Roost alleviates this problem, allowing Hydreigon to act as a pivot, repeatedly switching in on Fire-types, Grass-types, and more to soak up hits and fire back with its extremely powerful STAB-boosted attacks. Draco Meteor OHKOes even moderately bulky Pokemon such as Landorus-T. Dark Pulse provides coverage on Steel-types, especially Aegislash, and reliability; because it doesn't force Hydreigon to switch out, it is easy to spam. Another option would be to use Dragon Pulse and Earth Power as Hydreigon's attacks for better coverage on Pokemon such as Bisharp, Diancie, and Azumarill, but then Hydreigon loses its fearsome power. Protect is a staple on any Pokemon that can afford it, thanks to its many applications.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given Special Attack EVs guarantee an OHKO on 44 HP Landorus-T with Draco Meteor, an OHKO on 16 HP Mega Metagross with Dark Pulse, and a 2HKO on 252 HP / 4 SpD Cresselia if it uses Calm Mind between hits. The Speed EVs are enough to outrun Jolly Breloom and the rest of the EVs are invested in bulk. The HP hits a Life Orb number. Hydreigon needs Life Orb to get almost all of its OHKOs.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is used as a pivot: it can come in on a variety of bulky attackers such as Heatran and Aegislash, throw out Dark Pulses or Draco Meteors until it's forced out, and repeat. Roost should be used when Hydreigon is facing Pokemon that cannot outdamage its recovery and either are likely to Protect or are less threatening to your team than Hydreigon is to theirs. If you can avoid revealing Roost until the optimal moment, you can often get it for free and even mess up your opponent's game plan.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Roost Hydreigon is an excellent pick for teams that want to be able to repeatedly handle special Fire-types, such as Heatran and Charizard, without opening up a weakness to rain. Like Kyurem-B, Roost Hydreigon is excellent at dismantling bulky Fire / Water / Grass cores; while Kyurem-B is better against rain, Hydreigon has a better matchup with sun and Aegislash. Hydreigon has a very bad matchup against Terrakion, Keldeo, and Fairy-types and is setup fodder for Azumarill, so it's important to have partners that can patch up these weaknesses. Some good options are Aegislash and Grass-types, particularly Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. Those three really appreciate Hydreigon's ability to remove Jirachi as well.</p> "

  "Volcarona": {
    "overview": "<p>Volcarona is a unique attacker because it is the only viable Quiver Dance user in the tier, which in combination with great STAB moves in Fire Blast and Heat Wave, decent coverage against Water- and Rock-types in Giga Drain, and high Special Attack and Speed enables it to be a powerful special attacker. Its Speed allows it to Speed tie with Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Gardevoir and more importantly lets it outspeed many threats, such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, once it has one Quiver Dance boost. Despite its okay HP and Special Defense, Volcarona is physically frail, so it struggles against powerful physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Talonflame, even though the former can be  burned by Flame Body. Also, it has a tough time hitting Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran. Even though it has access to Giga Drain for Water- and Rock-types such as Keldeo, Mega Diancie, Terrakion, and Rhyperior, Volcarona still struggles against these Pokemon unless boosted by Quiver Dance.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fiery Dance can be used as Volcarona's Fire-type STAB move for another way to obtain boosts, although it is weaker than both Fiery Dance and Fire Blast. Hidden Power Ground can be useful to get a surprise KO on Heatran, but it must replace another coverage move and thus will usually be very costly. A Sitrus Berry set with a 160 HP / 16 Def / 148 SpA / 184 Spe spread for added bulk allows Volcarona to survive Mega Kangaskhan's Return. Coba Berry allows Volcarona to survive Talonflame's Brave Bird, but this is usually useless considering that Volcarona has trouble dealing any damage back to Talonflame. Charcoal boosts the power of Fire-type moves without recoil, unlike Life Orb, but you miss out on some damage, especially with Volcarona's coverage move. Volcarona can also serve as a redirection user by taking advantage of Flame Body, using a set of Rage Powder / Overheat / Tailwind / Protect and a spread of 224 HP / 76 Def / 100 SpA / 108 Spe, but its offensive assets are usually too helpful to pass up. Rocky Helmet is a good option on such a set, as it synergizes well with Flame Body and allows Volcarona to somewhat make up for its vulnerability to physical attacks. However, Volcarona's physical bulk is mediocre even if invested, which makes it outclassed as a redirection user by Pokemon such as Amoonguss or Jirachi.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Fire-types such as Heatran and Talonflame resist both of Volcarona's STAB attacks, which makes it Substitute bait for Heatran and fodder for Talonflame, which can KO it easily with STAB Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Water-types such as Keldeo and Rotom-W can hit Volcarona for significant damage with their STAB moves. However, they have to watch out for Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Mega Diancie and Terrakion can OHKO Volcarona with Diamond Storm and Rock Slide, respectively. They have to watch out for Giga Drain from a +1 Volcarona, however.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: If it is using Giga Drain instead of Bug Buzz, Volcarona also has trouble hitting Dragon-types such as Latios and Hydreigon.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Opposing forms of speed control such as Tailwind, Thunder Wave, and Trick Room can be tough to deal with for Volcarona because its Speed boosts from Quiver Dance can be nullified, which makes it a less potent sweeper.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Volcarona's poor Defense leaves it vulnerable to powerful physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Hoopa-U.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Quiver Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Heat Wave is a STAB spread move that can take out two foes at the same time, which is especially useful after Volcarona sets up with Quiver Dance. Volcarona can also use Fire Blast over Heat Wave, which makes it more threatening without a boost, most notably letting it OHKO Amoonguss and having a high chance to OHKO Aegislash. The power increase relative to Heat Wave is also helpful at +1, as it guarantees that Volcarona can outspeed and OHKO Choice Scarf Landorus-T. However, running Fire Blast over Heat Wave forces Volcarona to forgo its source of spread damage, even though Fire Blast isn't blocked by Wide Guard. Giga Drain allows Volcarona to beat Water-types such as Keldeo and Suicune while also dealing with Rock-types such as Mega Diancie and Rhyperior. It is also useful for Volcarona to regain some of the HP it has lost from potential Life Orb recoil. Bug Buzz can also be used over Giga Drain if your team is vulnerable to Dragon-types, such as Latios and Hydreigon. It is also a powerful STAB move that goes through Substitutes, which helps against users such as Kyurem-B. Quiver Dance allows Volcarona to become a threatening Pokemon once it manages to set up. The Special Defense boost can also come in handy versus slower special attackers such as Rotom-W and Aegislash. Lastly, Protect is a staple move in Doubles that is used to stall out field conditions such as Tailwind and Trick Room or to protect Volcarona from taking damage while its partner deals with the foes.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb lets Volcarona do more damage in general, notably allowing it to OHKO Aegislash with Fire Blast. Life Orb Volcarona also has a good chance to OHKO Landorus-T with Heat Wave after one Quiver Dance boost, but Lum Berry is also useful for absorbing one Thunder Wave from Thundurus or Spore from Breloom or Amoonguss, allowing Volcarona to more easily fulfill its role. While Life Orb is helpful for Heat Wave Volcarona to clean up an opposing team, Lum Berry synergizes well with Fire Blast, as the power boost isn't quite as necessary, and the extra utility helps Fire Blast Volcarona because it cannot remove two threats at once. Flame Body is useful to burn foes using contact moves that don't KO Volcarona, such as Fake Out from Mega Kangaskhan and Sucker Punch from Mega Kangaskhan and Bisharp. However, it should be noted that Talonflame can't be burned by Flame Body and many attacks that Volcarona is threatened by, such as Earthquake and Rock Slide, are non-contact moves. The given Speed investment allows Volcarona to outspeed Deoxys-A and Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T after one Quiver Dance boost and Speed tie with other maximum Speed base 100s when unboosted, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Gardevoir, while maximum Special Attack investment allows it to do as much damage as possible. An alternative spread of 40 Def / 240 SpA / 228 Spe can also be run to let Volcarona survive Rock Slide from Landorus-T at -1 Attack, while still outspeeding Deoxys-A and Mega Aerodactyl after a single Quiver Dance boost. It should, however, be noted that this spread should only be used together with Lum Berry, as Life Orb does not mesh with the defensive benchmarks well.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Volcarona functions best as a late-game sweeper, and once its checks are gone it can easily set up Quiver Dance and clean the rest of the game with powerful attacks. Volcarona should always look out for opportunities to easily set up Quiver Dance, such as when the foes have trouble harming it, such as Amoonguss and Aegislash, or when teammates can support it with Fake Out and redirection moves such as Follow Me and Rage Powder. If Volcarona can take out a threat with either its Fire-type STAB move or Giga Drain, it should use Giga Drain to improve its situation going into the following turn by healing some HP.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fake Out support makes setting up a lot easier for Volcarona. Common Fake Out users are Mega Kangaskhan and Scrafty, and the latter can also support Volcarona by weakening physical attackers with Intimidate. As redirection support is extremely useful to allow Volcarona to obtain boosts and be effective, Jirachi and Amoonguss make for great partners, as they can support Volcarona very well with Follow Me and Rage Powder, respectively. Using Amoonguss also allows Volcarona to set up in the face of Water-types more easily, and Amoonguss deals with Landorus-T better than Jirachi does. Jirachi, however, resists Flying-type attacks such as Talonflame's Brave Bird, which makes it a better redirection user in many cases. Clefairy is an alternative Follow Me user that also helps against opposing spread moves with Friend Guard. Quick Guard users such as Keldeo and Scrafty can help against priority moves such as Thundurus's Thunder Wave, Talonflame's Brave Bird, and Mega Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch. Wide Guard users such as Aegislash and Conkeldurr can help Volcarona because it struggles against super effective spread moves such as Rock Slide, Earthquake, and Muddy Water. Water-types such as Keldeo and Rotom-W can take care of Fire-types, which Volcarona can't hit. Rock-types and allies with Rock-type coverage moves provide fantastic offensive synergy with Volcarona's strong Fire- and Grass-type coverage. Ground- and Rock-types such as Mega Diancie, Terrakion, and Landorus-T all help Volcarona's sweeping potential by beating Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Talonflame, while Volcarona eliminates opposing Steel-types such as Aegislash and Jirachi for them. Pokemon that can beat common Dragon-types, such as Mega Diancie and Mega Gardevoir, are good partners if Volcarona isn't using Bug Buzz. Electric-types such as Thundurus, Zapdos, and Rotom-W can deal with both Flying- and Water-types, which can hit Volcarona super effectively. Lastly, Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Scrafty can help Volcarona take physical hits more easily.</p> "

  "Terrakion": {
    "overview": "<p>Terrakion's Speed, power, and coverage are very effective in Doubles. With STAB Rock-type attacks and Close Combat, it is able to maintain offensive pressure against most of the metagame, including common threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Kangaskhan, and Tyranitar. However, Intimidate and burns are very common in Doubles, so until those users are gone, Terrakion won't do much damage unless it lands a super effective hit. In addition, Terrakion's great offensive typing is terrible defensively, leaving it vulnerable to many common attackers, such as Scizor, Latios, and Azumarill. Many strong attacks can KO Terrakion, so one bad prediction can waste Terrakion's teamslot.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Quick Attack is an option to pick off faster threats, but its damage output is severely lacking. X-Scissor is a good option to hit bulky Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Reuniclus for good damage. Terrakion can boost its stats with Swords Dance and Rock Polish, but both sets require a lot of support to work. A Choice Band or Choice Scarf set is usable, but Terrakion doesn't enjoy being locked into one move. Lastly, Helping Hand allows Terrakion to support its teammate, but bulkier Pokemon can use it many more times.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Both the burn condition and Intimidate severely hinder Terrakion's performance in battle. Pokemon such as Rotom-W can take a hit and use Will-O-Wisp to check Terrakion. Ghost-types such as Dusclops can switch into Close Combat and take little from Rock Slide. Also, most Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Hitmontop and Landorus-T, don't take much from Terrakion's attacks, so they can easily switch in, lower its Attack, and threaten it with their super effective STAB attacks. Fortunately, Will-O-Wisp is avoidable with Substitute, but if an Intimidate user switches in before Terrakion can set Substitute up, then the damage output will be almost laughable.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash: Aegislash can take any attack in Terrakion's arsenal and OHKO with Flash Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon</strong>: Most Psychic-type Pokemon can take both of Terrakion's STAB moves and hit back with a STAB move. Latios in particular outruns Terrakion and OHKOes with Psyshock.</p> <p><strong>Speed: Many fast Pokemon can outspeed and severely damage Terrakion. Common threats include Latios, Mega Gengar, and Deoxys-A.  Lastly, Pokemon holding a Choice Scarf such as Rotom-W and Genesect can surprise and KO Terrakion.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Trick Room strategies stop Terrakion cold, as they expose its poor defensive typing, allowing most threats to take it out before it can attack. Popular users include Cresselia and Dusclops, which have no trouble setting up Trick Room against Terrakion. Paralysis similarly cripples it because Speed is no longer its strength. Popular Thunder Wave users include Thundurus and Whimsicott, which have Prankster to hit first, and Cresselia, which cannot be broken by Terrakion. Tailwind is a good check to Terrakion, because with Tailwind up, many more threats can outspeed and KO it.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rock Slide is Terrakion's main STAB move because it's a spread attack, has decent Base Power, and has a nifty flinch chance. However, Stone Edge is an option to hit threats much harder at the loss of covering both foes. Close Combat hits very hard as well, granting Terrakion the option to snipe particular Pokemon. Quick Guard is used to protect Terrakion and its ally against the many priority attackers in Doubles, including Talonflame, Bisharp, and Azumarill. Terrakion also outspeeds, and therefore blocks, every common Fake Out user in the tier bar Weavile. Substitute allows Terrakion to set up on many status inducers, making its sweep much easier. However, Taunt can be used to reliably stop Trick Room, a playstyle that hurts Terrakion badly.  Protect helps Terrakion scout for attacks, stall field conditions, and ruin double-targeting strategies.</p> <h1>Set Comments</h1> <p>Life Orb is the most reliable item because of the damage output and should be used with Substitute; the extra damage doesn't bother Terrakion much because it won't survive many hits anyway. Terrakion can use a Focus Sash decently as well to guarantee survival against any attack, but it must use Quick Guard in that set. A Lum Berry can easily fit into the set as well, as it allows Terrakion to take a Will-O-Wisp and switch into Heatran's or Mega Charizard Y's Heat Waves more reliably.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The best way to use Terrakion in battle is to keep constant offensive pressure on the opponent. Use Close Combat or Stone Edge to snipe particular Pokemon and Rock Slide to get key spread damage on both foes. Terrakion is difficult to use because it is easily damaged beyond repair, so unless the damage is worth it, keep it out of play. This is why Terrakion works well as a late-game sweeper; once its threats are sufficiently damaged, Terrakion can just use Rock Slide and wipe them out. However, if a Focus Sash is being used, Terrakion can revenge kill almost any foe with little fear. Quick Guard is for situational threats, such as Prankster users and priority attackers. With a Focus Sash and Quick Guard, Terrakion makes a very good lead. Taunt should only be used when absolutely necessary, because if Terrakion uses Taunt and the foe attacks, Terrakion's teamslot is wasted. Lastly, remember that Terrakion attracts Intimidate users and faster sweepers like flies, so some smart double-switching is needed to get momentum up against these threats.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cresselia is a fantastic partner for Terrakion because it can take almost every attack aimed at it, boost the power of its attacks with Helping Hand, and neuter threats such as Hitmontop and Landorus-T with Psyshock and Icy Wind, respectively. Amoonguss can dispose of key threats with its great bulk and Spore, as well as direct attacks aimed at Terrakion towards itself with Rage Powder. Azumarill is a good offensive partner because its STAB attacks threaten almost every Intimidate user that plans on switching into Terrakion. Mega Charizard Y can eliminate the Grass- and Fighting-types that threaten Terrakion. Lastly, Tyranitar and Excadrill can handle the bulky Psychic-types that wall Terrakion.</p> "

  "Virizion": {
    "overview": "<p>Overshadowed by fellow musketeers Keldeo and Terrakion, as well as other Fighting-types such as Infernape and Breloom, Virizion struggles to find a solid niche in the Doubles metagame due to its inferior offensive stats. Similarly to Breloom, its STAB Grass- and Fighting-type attacks threaten many common Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Heatran, Bisharp, Kyurem-B, and Rotom-W. Virizion also boasts Rock-type coverage in Stone Edge to beat Mega Charizard Y and help against other opposing Flying types. However, its low Attack and bad typing also leave it vulnerable to many rampant threats such as Aegislash, Amoonguss, Mega Diancie, Mega Metagross, Latios, and Talonflame. The extremely common Landorus-T also causes major problems with Intimidate.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Lum Berry is an option that allows Virizion to heal status such as paralysis or burn once, but the drop in power compared to Life Orb is noticeable, and Virizion also misses out on the vital KO on Mega Kangaskhan and Heatran. Zen Headbutt can be used as a coverage move to do decent damage to Amoonguss and Venusaur, but it otherwise only hits Grass-resistant foes without the drops of Close Combat. Double Kick can serve as a weaker, secondary Fighting-type STAB move that can OHKO Focus Sash users such as Bisharp and Weavile as well as KO heavily weakened Heatran and Kyurem-B behind a Substitute, although the first hit is not guaranteed to break Kyurem-B's Substitute. Safeguard is an interesting support option that gives both Virizion and its teammates an immunity to status for a few turns.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon: Psychic-type Pokemon such as Latios and Cresselia can tank a hit from Virizion and hit back with a super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: If Virizion is running Stone Edge, non-Fighting-weak Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Rotom-H can handily beat it.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Ghost-type Pokemon are immune to Virizion's Fighting-type STAB moves and most are indifferent of its Grass coverage. Aegislash and Gengar match up well against Virizion and can hit back hard with their STAB moves. Gourgeist is a more niche option; however, it should be noted that if a team needs a specific check to Virizion, it probably needs reconsidering as a whole.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Due to Virizion's low base Attack stat, Intimidate and burns leave it severely crippled. Landorus-T and Gyarados both take any of Virizion's attacks quite comfortably; Landorus-T does heavy damage with even a resisted Earthquake due to Virizion's low phsyical bulk, and Gyarados can cripple Virizion with Thunder Wave. The main Will-O-Wisp users Virizion needs to look out for are Talonflame and Gengar, but healthy Rotom-W and Rotom-H or Mew and Gourgeist can also threaten to burn with this move.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: A plethora of top threats in the metagame check Virizion. Base 110 Speed Pokemon in particular such as Mega Metagross and Mega Diancie threaten Virizion massively. Pokemon even faster yet, such as Talonflame (which also boasts priority in Brave Bird), Deoxys-A, and Blaziken after a single turn of Speed Boost also outspeed and KO Virizion.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Virizion needs to move first to KO most of the Pokemon it checks, and opposing speed control prevents this and thus flips the table. Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and Heatran will enjoy attacking first greatly and will take advantage of Virizion's lacking Defense and poor defensive typing. Cresselia and Gourgeist can freely set up Trick Room on Virizion if it lacks Taunt. Jirachi can use Thunder Wave without taking too much damage while also carrying the superior redirection move Follow Me, which Virizion cannot get around. Latios can set up Tailwind to help teammates out and can take hits from Virizion decently. Talonflame can also set up Tailwind some of the time due to its ability to put massive offensive pressure onto teams and, in particular, Virizion. Even bulkier Tailwind setters such as Togekiss and Suicune can set up Tailwind in a pinch against Virizion, with Togekiss also threatening it with a 4x super effective Air Slash as a bonus.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leaf Blade is Virizion's best Grass-type STAB move, with an increased chance to score clutch critical hits. With a Life Orb boost, Leaf Blade does over 80% to standard Rotom-W and even has a small chance to 2HKO Suicune through Sitrus Berry. Close Combat is a strong Fighting-type STAB move that provides most of Virizion's offensive presence, and with a Life Orb boost it OHKOes Fighting-weak Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Heatran, Hydreigon, and Bisharp. Stone Edge provides Virizion with a means to hit opposing Flying-types such as Thundurus and Mega Charizard Y for super effective damage. Quick Guard can be used instead as an excellent support option, blocking priority moves such as Fake Out and Talonflame's Brave Bird to assist teammates. Taunt is another support move that allows Virizion to prevent Tailwind or Trick Room from being set, and it also helps Virizion against Aegislash and Amoonguss. Protect is a staple move in Doubles for scouting attacks and stalling out field conditions, and in particular it allows Virizion to stay on the field while its partner takes care of a faster Pokemon threatening it such as Talonflame or Latios.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Virizion to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible and Speed tie with Keldeo, Terrakion, and Infernape. Maximum EVs are put into Attack to maximize the much-needed damage output. Life Orb is used, as it allows Virizion to hit hard and is necessary to get the OHKOs on Mega Kangaskhan and Heatran with Close Combat.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Virizion can fare well as a lead due to its good matchup against Mega Kangaskhan and, if carrying Quick Guard, just Fake Out users in general. In general, Virizion works best early- and mid-game, where it can wear down the opponent's Pokemon such as bulky Water-types and Landorus-T to help teammates out later on. Virizion should only be brought onto the field via resisted special attacks or free switches; otherwise, it will lose a hefty chunk of health. Virizion can be used as a great check to common Amoonguss partners such as Mega Kangaskhan and Azumarill, as it can ignore Rage Powder to hit the targets super effectively and resists both Pokemon's priority attacks. If Virizion is lacking Taunt, it should be wary of giving Pokemon such as Aegislash and Amoonguss free turns, as it cannot touch them. Unlike Keldeo, Virizion can't freely spam Quick Guard against Talonflame, as it has to watch out for Flare Blitz, which OHKOes it. Virizion can, however, use Quick Guard against Thundurus much more safely to prevent priority Taunts or Thunder Waves from it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Virizion's ability to weaken opposing Water-types and Landorus-T makes it a nice partner for offensive Pokemon that appreciate them being worn down. Talonflame exemplifies this, as it appreciates Rotom-W and Landorus-T in particular being removed. The combination of a -1 Life Orb-boosted Leaf Blade and a +0 Adamant Life Orb-boosted Brave Bird from Talonflame 2HKOes even 44 HP Landorus-T. Mega Metagross is a great offensive Steel-type partner, as it provides a fast option to take care of Fairy- and Psychic-type Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir in return for Virizion beating down its checks such as Heatran, Landorus-T, and bulky Water-types. Mega Metagross can also swiftly remove Amoonguss for Virizion. Aegislash provides a slower Steel-type option to check Fairy- and Psychic-types for Virizion, with the added bonus of beating opposing Ghost-types as well.</p> <p>Belly Drum Azumarill is an offensive partner that Virizion can assist with one of its support moves if running it. Virizion can use Quick Guard to help protect it from Talonflame's Brave Bird or Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out, assisting Azumarill's sweep. Alternatively, Taunt helps stop Amoonguss from raining on the parade.</p> <p>Virizion can also work well with bulkier Pokemon by both removing their checks and baiting in Pokemon they can take advantage of. Heatran is a fantastic teammate for Virizion, as Virizion removes Mega Kangaskhan and bulky Water-types for Heatran, while Heatran helps against Amoonguss, Aegislash, Mega Metagross, Latios, and Talonflame. Rotom-W also pairs well with Virizion, as Rotom-W has an easy time facing the likes of Talonflame, Landorus-T, and Gyarados while also doing decently against Mega Metagross and Mega Diancie. This combination would, however, struggle against Amoonguss and therefore would need to be supported accordingly.</p> <p>Virizion can additionally be an interesting option for rain teams, as it can outspeed and Mega Charizard Y and OHKO it with Stone Edge while also hitting opposing Water-types for super effective damage, both of which are usually threats to rain teams.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Tornadus is outclassed in almost all aspects in the DOU metagame. While it can function as either a priority Tailwind setter or a Defiant attacker, both sets are mediocre compared to Talonflame and Bisharp, respectively. The only notable advantage Tornadus has is its Speed as a Defiant attacker, but even then, it is still overshadowed by Bisharp, which is more powerful and has priority and a better typing. While it does have great Speed, good coverage, and a solid Attack stat, Tornadus's inability to run an item such as Life Orb due to its reliance on Acrobatics, by far the strongest Flying-type STAB move in its movepool, serves as a great hindrance. Furthermore, Tornadus is frail and has few resistances, leaving it unable to safely switch in and contribute most of the time.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A set utilizing Prankster with Tailwind is workable; however, a physical variant is wholly outclassed by Talonflame, while a special one is unreliable due to needing Hurricane. U-turn can be useful in order to let Tornadus deal some chip damage while also functioning as a positioning tool. Taunt, serviceable with either ability but naturally better with Prankster, can let Tornadus stop any kind of setup from foes.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Zapdos all resist Tornadus's STAB moves and can deal major damage back with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Mega Diancie can take any attack from Tornadus and OHKO it in return with Diamond Storm. Terrakion can also OHKO Tornadus with Rock Slide, but it has to watch out for Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon: While they have to watch out for Superpower, both Kyurem-B and Weavile can OHKO Tornadus with their respective STAB moves, the latter of which also outrunning Tornadus.</p> <p><strong>Burns: Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Mega Gengar and Talonflame can limit Tornadus's effectiveness greatly by weakening its blows if it's a physical variant.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: The likes of Deoxys-A, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Gengar threaten Tornadus greatly, as they can outrun it and hit through its paper-thin defenses. Kingdra, Ludicolo, and Venusaur also work well, but only in their respective weathers.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Without its Speed advantage, Tornadus loses its offensive presence and becomes vulnerable to strong attacks.

Superpower provides coverage for some Steel-types such as Heatran and Bisharp while also dealing major super effective damage to targets such as... such as Mega Kangaskhan, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon. Knock Off allows Tornadus to do significant damage to Aegislash and Psychic-types such as Latios and Jirachi in addition to providing some utility in removing the items of foes. Protect defends Tornadus from any damage, letting it safely stall out any field condition and get into a more favorable position as needed.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment and a Jolly nature are used in order to maximize Tornadus's offensive potential, letting it deal as much damage as possible and outrun base 110s such as Gengar, Latios, and Mega Diancie. Defiant lets Tornadus function as a deterrent against Intimidate, which would boost Tornadus's Attack. No item is run in order to let Tornadus utilize Acrobatics effectively.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As Tornadus's main role is to be a deterrent to Intimidate, one should try to pair it with physical attackers such as Mega Diancie and Mega Kangaskhan. Against teams with an Intimidate Pokemon, Tornadus can function as a good anti-lead in order to have the initiative from the get-go. Tornadus can also take advantage of moves that lower stats such as Snarl and Icy Wind for a +2 boost to its Attack; however, one should note that Icy Wind also lowers Tornadus's Speed, making it vulnerable to more foes. One should caution against directly switching in Tornadus, as it risks getting KOed due to its frailty and few resistances.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since Tornadus's niche is to take advantage of opposing Intimidate, physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Diancie, Landorus-T, and Terrakion make for good partners. Pokemon that can deal with Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Thundurus work well; Dragon-types such as Kyurem-B and Hydreigon resist most of their blows and can deal a lot of damage back. Even though Tornadus carries the appropriate coverage moves, partners that can deal with Steel-types such as Aegislash and Jirachi are still appreciated in order to let Tornadus use Acrobatics more freely; Landorus-T and Fire-types such as Heatran and Volcanion can deal major damage against them too, with Landorus-T again also appreciating Tornadus's ability to deter Intimidate. Steel-types are also good teammates, as they can handily deal with opposing Ice- and Rock-types for Tornadus, with Jirachi capable of covering for Tornadus's frailty, letting it stay in longer on the field, and Aegislash also able to support it with Wide Guard to block Diamond Storm and Rock Slide.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Thundurus is a versatile Pokemon that can tailor its set to perform quite well in a variety of roles, both supportive and offensive, making it a premier threat in the metagame. First off, its three most common attacks can OHKO some of the most common Pokemon in the tier in Mega Diancie, Landorus-T, and Mega Charizard Y, if using an offensive set. Thundurus also has a great Speed tier to be able to take advantage of those offenses, just edging out the many base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Diancie. In addition to that, Thundurus also has access to Prankster to further assure that its status moves will precede any other moves on the field. A more bulky Thundurus set that takes full advantage of Prankster is also quite viable, using priority Thunder Wave and Taunt to disrupt the opponent's strategy. However, this set needs significant investment to become sufficiently bulky, leaving its speed and power slightly disappointing. Also, Thundurus's typing isn't doing it many favors; although the secondary Flying typing does help in removing Thundurus's weakness to Ground-type moves, it also leaves Thundurus susceptible to the quite common Rock- and Ice-type attacks. Additionally, the Flying-typing doesn't help Thundurus at all offensively, as it lacks access to any reliable special Flying-type moves.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thundurus has a vast movepool, so its set can be tailored to a team's specific needs with a variety of other options. Focus Blast, typically used on the offensive set, is Thundurus's best method of dealing with Ferrothorn and also deals significant damage to threats such as Kyurem-B and Mega Kangaskhan. On rain teams that need the extra weather support, Thundurus makes a decent Rain Dance user. Rain Dance also allows Thundurus to use Thunder in place of Thunderbolt, as Thunder gains perfect accuracy in the rain. Lastly, Hidden Power Flying is Thundurus's only reliable secondary STAB move and may be used to hit Amoonguss harder as well as nail threats such as Mega Venusaur and Volcarona. The offensive set has a few other options for its item; Safety Goggles may be used over a Life Orb on sets without Taunt, which allows Thundurus to ignore the effects of Rage Powder (usually to hit an Azumarill) and become a sleep switch-in. Alternatively, Charti Berry allows Thundurus to fare even better against Landorus-T, taking either a Rock Slide or Stone Edge with ease and retaliating with Hidden Power Ice. Equipping Choice Specs boosts Thundurus's power even higher than if it used a Life Orb, and such sets also get the bonus of being able to run Volt Switch to pivot out of bad matchups. Although Thundurus-T has a higher Special Attack stat, Thundurus has a far better Speed tier, outpacing Keldeo and Mega Diancie. Finally, a Focus Sash may be used to help Thundurus take at least one hit from fast attackers that would otherwise take it out, such as Deoxys-A and Weavile. As Thundurus also has access to Defiant, a physical set can surprise the opponent. This set uses a moveset of Wild Charge / Superpower / Knock Off or Sky Drop / Protect and a Life Orb for an item. However, such sets miss out of priority Thunder Wave and are forced to rely on Thundurus's lower Attack stat.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Mega Swampert are immune to Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave and commonly have ways to hit Flying-types super effectively.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Thundurus is weak to Rock-type STAB-moves from Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Terrakion and doesn't have ways to hit them super effectively unless it is running Flash Cannon. Mega Diancie has the added bonus of Magic Bounce preventing Thundurus from using Thunder Wave or Taunt, and Terrakion commonly runs a Lum Berry to shield it from Thundurus's attempts to paralyze it. Rhydon and Rhyperior even have Lightning Rod to prevent Thundurus from hitting their teammates.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon: Ice-type Pokemon are quite threatening to either Thundurus set, as it is weak to their STAB moves and only has Flash Cannon to hit them back. Each even has additional benefits that allow them to perform well against Thundurus: Kyurem-B has access to Substitute to prevent Thundurus from paralyzing it, Weavile outspeeds the fast set and OHKOes it with Icicle Crash, and Mega Abomasnow doesn't mind being hit by any of Thundurus's moves due to its already low Speed and Grass typing.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Thunder Wave is unable to paralyze the many Electric-types in the metagame, and some, including Rotom-H and Raikou, also resist Thunderbolt while being able to hit Thundurus with a neutrally effective STAB move of their own due to Thundurus's secondary Flying typing.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Grass-types resist Thunderbolt and typically have a way to hit Thundurus hard. Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn are especially notable, as they do not mind the Speed drop accompanied by Thunder Wave and are not hit super effectively by Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users are especially problematic for the bulky set, although if the move is predicted, Thundurus can counter with a Taunt of its own before it is hit due to Prankster and a high base Speed.</p> <p><strong>Quick Guard</strong>: The only downside of Prankster is that Thundurus's status moves are blocked by Quick Guard. One of the more common users of the move is Terrakion, which can hit Thundurus hard with its Rock-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: If a foe has a Substitute, it is impervious to Thunder Wave, although Taunt can bypass it to prevent them from setting another Substitute. The main threat here is Substitute Kyurem-B, as Heatran's Substitute is easily broken by a Thunderbolt.</p> ",

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thundurus's main attack is Thunderbolt, due to its decent Base Power and perfect accuracy. Flash Cannon is almost exclusively to hit Mega Diancie, although it also deals a significant chunk of damage to other Fairy-types and Kyurem-B. Thunder Wave allows Thundurus to take advantage of Prankster by slowing down fast foes and potentially immobilizing them. Sometimes, Thundurus needs coverage more than speed control, so Hidden Power Ice can be used to defeat both Landorus formes and pick up the quick KO on Salamence. Taunt is also an option in the third slot if Thundurus's team is especially weak to Trick Room or already covers the potential targets of Thunder Wave and Hidden Power Ice. Protect is a staple move in the Doubles metagame, allowing Thundurus to stall out field conditions, shield itself while its partner deals with a threat, and scout incoming attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Thundurus to take full advantage of the offensive nature of this set, with a Timid nature chosen over a Modest one in order to outspeed base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Diancie. Prankster grants Thunder Wave priority, allowing Thundurus to paralyze especially fast threats, including those under Tailwind. Life Orb boosts Thundurus's power, most notably to guarantee the OHKO on Azumarill with Thunderbolt. Alternatively, Thundurus may use a Magnet, which allows it to bluff the bulky set due to the lack of Life Orb recoil while still hitting the same offensive benchmarks. However, this comes at the cost of a fair amount of power behind Thundurus's other attacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Offensive Thundurus is great at applying pressure to the opposing team with its high-powered moves while also providing support in the form of Prankster Thunder Wave. This set works decently well as a lead to threaten paralysis on the fast Pokemon that tend to be chosen as leads. Another common lead is Mega Diancie, which this set outspeeds and takes out using Flash Cannon. Without any defense investment, this set is incredibly frail, and it should avoid switching in on any attacks. As this is an offensively oriented set, Thundurus should only use Thunder Wave when facing an especially fast foe, and otherwise it should just attack.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Teammates that struggle with Mega Diancie, such as Keldeo, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona, appreciate the presence of this Thundurus set in particular. Both Landorus formes fear the Water-types that this set can easily beat and remove Terrakion and Rhyperior to aid Thundurus. Especially for sets not carrying Hidden Power Ice, a teammate to handle Dragon-types is essential. Some common and solid choices include Mega Gardevoir, Mega Kangaskhan, and Azumarill. Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Infernape have particularly good synergy with Thundurus, as they take on Rock- and Ice-types and benefit from the removal of Flying-types. Weather-oriented teams can use Thundurus's strong matchup against Mega Charizard Y and Politoed, the two most common weather setters, to win the weather war and guarantee their desired field conditions.</p> "

        "name": "Bulky Thunder Wave",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt hits decently hard despite the minimal investment. Hidden Power Ice hits the Landorus formes that are immune to Thundurus's Electric-type moves. Thunder Wave is useful for speed control and general incapacitation, especially when paired with teammates that have setup moves such as Substitute, as a conveniently timed full paralysis can grant free turns to set up. Taunt prevents Trick Room, opposing Taunt, and any other shenanigans the foe might try, such as redirection and speed control. Alternatively, Protect can be useful for catching the opponent off guard, as this set typically does not carry the move.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given spread guarantees that Thundurus will survive a Mega Diancie Diamond Storm or Latios's Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor. 20 Speed EVs are used to guarantee that Thundurus will outspeed positive-natured base 70 Pokemon such as Breloom. The remaining 4 EVs and a Modest nature are used to prevent standard Azumarill from being able to use Belly Drum by guaranteeing that a Thunderbolt will do at least 75%. A Sitrus Berry is typically Thundurus's best choice for an item, as the added bulk is quite helpful for improving its average defensive stats. The burst recovery provided by a Sitrus Berry allows Thundurus to better stand up to double targets or Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <p>A more offensive alternative to this set uses a spread of 160 HP / 96 SpA / 252 Spe, a Timid nature, and Flash Cannon over Thunder Wave or Taunt; this strikes a balance between the two most common sets, allowing Thundurus to get both the speed and some of the bulk. The spread maximizes Speed and, using a Sitrus Berry, guarantees that Thundurus can withstand a Mega Kangaskhan's Return.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Thundurus set is a disruptor and should be used as such, only attacking when necessary or against a foe that will be hit super effectively. Thundurus's access to Prankster Thunder Wave and Taunt makes it a solid lead, able to put a damper on whatever the opponent's initial strategy may be. Unlike the offensive set, this set may act as a more direct counter to threats such as Landorus-T and Talonflame, as it can safely switch in on them due to its added bulk. If a fast attacker is likely to take Thundurus out and there are no safe switch-ins available, Thundurus should use Thunder Wave or Taunt to outprioritize most attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to its supportive nature, this Thundurus set works on a variety of teams and does not require much support of its own to shine. Substitute users such as Heatran and Kyurem-B can take advantage of a fully paralyzed opponent by setting up and appreciate being able to move first. Thundurus also helps out hard hitters with mediocre Speed tiers, including Mega Kangaskhan, Hoopa-U, and Volcanion. Landorus-T is a particularly good teammate, as it grants Thundurus more physical bulk due to Intimidate and enjoys the removal of Water-types. Fighting-types such as Keldeo or Terrakion beat Steel-, Rock-, and Ice-types for Thundurus and appreciate it dealing with Flying-types. They also defeat Mega Kangaskhan, which is a large threat to this set as a bulky Pokemon that Thundurus cannot hit super effectively. Rain teams appreciate Thundurus's removal of Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, as well as its access to Taunt to prevent Trick Room.</p> "

  "Thundurus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting a high 145 Special Attack stat, Thundurus-T cements itself as a strong attacker in the Doubles metagame. Its capability to fire off powerful Thunders makes it a natural pick for rain-based teams. Volt Absorb lets it absorb Thunder Waves aimed at its Swift Swim partners and soak up Electric-type attacks for Politoed. However, Thundurus-T is frail, so it can't often switch in without taking significant damage. Though Thundurus-T is faster than base 100s such as Mega Kangaskhan, its base 101 Speed is only decent and leaves it outrun by the likes of Terrakion and Mega Diancie. Another note is that as an attacker, it doesn't have many useful coverage options outside of Hidden Power and Focus Blast. Finally, outside of Choice sets, Thundurus-T is outclassed by Thundurus, which is faster and has more useful abilities.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Flash Cannon allows Thundurus-T to OHKO Mega Diancie, but doesn't hit much else and is thus an unfortunate move to be locked into. Superpower can be used over Focus Blast for a more accurate alternative. However, it's significantly weaker, as it comes off of the notably lower Attack stat while compounding Thundurus-T's physical frailty. A boosting set with Agility can be used, as the merit of outrunning the majority of the metagame while hitting decently hard and being able to run a Modest nature is tempting. However, it doesn't find much room for setup, nor does it have the bulk to do so. Nasty Plot is another usable move that can be used to power up Thundurus-T's offensive capabilities to monstrous levels, but it holds the same flaws as the Agility set while also being outclassed as a user of the move by Thundurus. Discharge is a usable move that lets Thundurus-T ignore redirection. It can be taken advantage of as well by pairing Thundurus-T with Mega Sceptile to boost its Special Attack with Lightning Rod. Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp can also be paired with Thundurus-T to safely use the move without hitting a teammate.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Latios and Hydreigon can safely take any attack, even one Hidden Power Ice at full health, and KO with Draco Meteor. Kyurem-B can also take any attack except Focus Blast handily.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Mega Swampert can easily switch in on its Electric-type attacks and KO with an appropriate move. The former has to be wary of switching into a Hidden Power Ice, however.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: If Thundurus-T is not carrying Hidden Power Flying, Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur can safely ignore or cripple Thundurus-T; in particular, Amoonguss can redirect and soak up its Electric-type STAB moves with Rage Powder, effectively making Thundurus-T a non-factor in play. Ferrothorn can take Thundurus-T's STAB attacks but has to watch out for Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Thundurus-T is outrun and easily KOed by faster Rock-type foes such as Terrakion and Mega Diancie. Rhyperior can KO with a STAB move while also redirecting Electric-type attacks with its ability, Lightning Rod.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: If not using Choice Scarf, Thundurus-T can easily get KOed by other users of the item, such as Landorus-T and Genesect.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room: Since Thundurus-T is naturally fast, Trick Room puts it at a disadvantage by making it move slower than most Pokemon, which also makes its frailty more pronounced. Cresselia can safely set up Trick Room while taking most of Thundurus-T's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: If rain is not present, Thundurus-T can't use Thunder accurately. Abomasnow, Tyranitar, and Mega Charizard Y can change the weather to Thundurus-T's displeasure. Mega Charizard Y has to be careful when switching in, however.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch is a STAB move that hits decently hard while letting Thundurus-T switch out, allowing it to function as a scout early-game and put in some chip damage. Thunderbolt is a strong Electric-type STAB move that lets Thundurus-T secure KOs and clean up late-game. Hidden Power Ice is a useful coverage move that lets Thundurus-T hit Pokemon that resist or are immune to its Electric-type STAB moves, such as Amoonguss and Landorus-T. Focus Blast covers Excadrill and Ferrothorn and lets Thundurus-T deal massive damage to Heatran and nab a KO on Tyranitar. If Thundurus-T is used in the rain, Thunder is an option to hit foes harder.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf lets Thundurus-T outspeed and significantly damage or KO threats it wouldn't be able to otherwise and lets it be a fast Pokemon in general; it also lets Thundurus-T function as a revenge killer when needed. Volt Absorb is useful for letting it switch into opposing Electric-type attacks and absorb them for nifty recovery. The EV investment lets Thundurus-T outspeed Modest Choice Scarf Hydreigon and gives it maximum power, with the leftover EVs put into HP. A Modest nature is used to maximize offensive potential, as Thundurus-T already outspeeds the majority of the metagame with Choice Scarf. However, a Timid nature can be used to outrun Swift Swim Ludicolo in rain, but it misses out on some power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As Thundurus-T is quite fast, it can function as a lead most of the time and scout moves with Volt Switch. However, when against the threat of a Fake Out, it's best to switch out to an appropriate Pokemon. Thundurus-T can be useful to get some chip damage early-game using Volt Switch. Be wary of opposing Protect, however, as Thundurus-T's frailty means that it can't afford to not be able to switch out. It can also function as a cleaner late-game once most of its checks are gone or weakened, as its Speed can make it hard to hit while it gets KOs.</p> <p>Be wary of opposing switch-ins to Pokemon that resist or are immune to Thundurus-T's STAB moves and predict accordingly; for example, if predicting a Landorus-T switch-in, using Hidden Power Ice can nab an easy KO. Another example of predicting is using Volt Switch on a predicted resisted switch-in. Don't recklessly switch in Thundurus-T, since it's frail and can't really afford to take a hit. Only do so when predicting an Earthquake or an Electric-type attack is coming its way. In particular, it can be a nifty switch-in on incoming Thunder Waves, protecting its teammates from paralysis while giving it recovery. In a pinch, Thundurus-T can function as a revenge killer thanks to its Speed, power, and coverage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that appreciate the luring and removal of Landorus-T enjoy Thundurus-T as a partner. Physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Terrakion appreciate being able to come in without Landorus-T neutering their Attack and forcing them to switch out. A Pokemon with Fake Out can pair well with Thundurus-T to function as a scouting lead. Mega Kangaskhan can use Fake Out while forcing some switches thanks to its strong offensive presence, which pairs well with Volt Switch. Ludicolo also has Fake Out and can take out annoying Ground-types with Hydro Pump. Since opposing Latios is a huge thorn in Thundurus-T's side, Thundurus-T appreciates partners that can consistently threaten to KO Latios. Aegislash can switch into both Draco Meteor and Psyshock and threaten to KO with Shadow Ball, while also having Wide Guard to shield Thundurus-T from opposing Rock Slide and other powerful spread attacks. Thundurus-T also appreciates partners that can remove opposing Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur, which can both soak up Thundurus-T's Electric-type STAB moves and take a Hidden Power Ice, threatening to cripple or significantly damage Thundurus-T afterward. Kyurem-B and Talonflame can both net a KO on most Grass-types with their STAB moves, the former being notable for also being able to handle opposing Ground-types, which can soak up Thundurus-T's Thunderbolt and Volt Switch. Pokemon that Thundurus-T can fall back on to take the omnipresent Rock Slide make for viable partners as well. Keldeo can switch in while threatening Rock Slide's major users Landorus-T and Terrakion, and Ferrothorn can safely switch in to take numerous hits and slowly whittle away at the foes, though it can't switch in on Terrakion. If using Thunder instead of Thunderbolt, Politoed makes for a viable partner to make said move more accurate.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch is the first STAB move, which hits hard and deals significant chip damage while scouting for moves. Thunder, the second STAB move, packs a strong punch with Choice Specs and lets Thundurus-T significantly damage or KO opponents. However, it should only be used while rain is present, as it is inaccurate otherwise. Thunderbolt makes for a fine alternative, but it loses out on a notable amount of power. Hidden Power Flying hits Grass-type Pokemon troublesome to the rain archetype such as Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur for significant damage. Hidden Power Ice is an option to be able to hit predicted Landorus-T and Garchomp switch-ins while still hitting Amoonguss. However, it misses out on Mega Venusaur because the weakness is negated by Thick Fat. Focus Blast rounds out the moveset, covering Excadrill and Ferrothorn while netting quick KOs on Heatran and Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Specs boosts Thundurus-T's already high Special Attack to greater levels, letting it do significant damage with its attacks; it boasts so much power that it can even net a 2HKO on Latios with Thunder. Volt Absorb lets it safely switch into opposing Electric-type attacks for recovery in a pinch. Using the given combination of nature and EV investment, Thundurus-T outruns positive-natured base 100s such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y while having maximum offensive potential.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Specs Thundurus-T should only be used in rain, as it can't safely use its powerful Thunder without it. Any team without rain should be using another set instead. Thundurus-T can function early-game by dealing decently strong chip damage with Volt Switch, which is useful for letting its teammates clean later on. Be wary of opposing Protect, however, as Thundurus-T can't afford to not be able to switch out, due to its frailty. Use Thunder when you need something KOed or broken down, since it's really strong and deals significant damage even to switch-ins that resist it. It's also the move to use generally, as it's really powerful and can significantly weaken most threats. Thundurus-T can be paired with a Fake Out user such as Ludicolo to safely net chip damage and possibly maintain momentum with Volt Switch.</p> <p>Be wary of opposing switch-ins to Pokemon that resist or are immune to its STAB moves and predict accordingly; for example, if predicting a switch-in that resists Thundurus-T's other moves, use Volt Switch to maintain momentum. Use the appropriate coverage move for the threats they were meant for; use Hidden Power Flying to break down Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur, and use Focus Blast to hit Ferrothorn. Finally, don't blindly switch in Thundurus-T, as it can't really afford to take a hit, due to its frailty. Only do so when predicting an opposing Earthquake or Electric-type move. In particular, it can switch into incoming Thunder Waves, protecting its teammates, especially its Swift Swim sweeper partners, from paralysis while giving it nifty recovery.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Politoed is an excellent partner for this particular set, as the rain it brings lets Thundurus-T fire off its monstrous Thunder with never-miss accuracy. Partners that can eliminate opposing Ground-types that may soak up Thundurus-T's Electric-type moves serve well as partners. Swift Swim Ludicolo and Mega Swampert can outspeed and KO the omnipresent Choice Scarf Landorus-T, the most notable Ground-type, while being staples on rain teams in general. Keldeo can remove Ground-types as well, while also netting a KO on Ferrothorn, another thorn in Thundurus-T's side. If not running Hidden Power Flying, Thundurus-T appreciates Pokemon that can remove opposing Grass-types, which wall it. Both Kyurem-B and Talonflame can net a KO on common Grass-types with their respective super effective STAB moves. Pokemon that Thundurus-T can fall back on to take the omnipresent Rock Slide make for viable partners. Physically defensive Politoed can safely come in while threatening the move's major users, Landorus-T and Terrakion, and Ferrothorn can safely switch in to take numerous hits and slowly whittle away at the foes, though it can't switch into Terrakion. To patch up Thundurus-T's only decent Speed, a Tailwind setter could be a viable partner. Both Latios and Talonflame can set it while being able to take out faster threats to Thundurus-T such as Terrakion and Keldeo.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Landorus is able to destroy Steel-types like Aegislash and Heatran using its combination of Sheer Force, Life Orb, and STAB Earth Power. It works well on teams that appreciate Fire- and Steel-types removed, such as hail teams, as threats to hail teams such as Heatran and Aegislash are able to easily stand up to Blizzard and Giga Drain. While Landorus is able to outspeed fully invested base 100 Speed Pokemon, it is threatened by Pokemon that can outspeed it and commonly carry an Ice- or Water-type move, such as Weavile and Keldeo. Also, using Landorus means you can't use Landorus-T, which can be classed as a drawback because Landorus has no defensive utility. Landorus's edge over other Ground-types is that it has access to a single-target special Ground-type move that is boosted by Sheer Force, making it incredibly powerful. Unlike Earthquake, Earth Power allows Landorus to threaten Aegislash without worrying about Wide Guard and use Ground-type coverage without worrying about hitting teammates. Landorus also doesn't suffer from a drop in power due to Intimidate or burns.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Landorus forces a lot of switches with its powerful moves, so Substitute can be used to catch opponents off-guard. Landorus has a shallow movepool and shouldn't really be using anything not listed on the main set besides that. It can also run a Choice Scarf to surprise foes such as Landorus-T, but this misses out on the compounding power behind Life Orb + Sheer Force.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon: Kyurem-B can survive a hit other than Focus Blast and OHKO with Ice Beam, and the Choice Scarf variant can outspeed and OHKO without worry. Mamoswine can OHKO with Ice Shard, and Weavile can outspeed and OHKO with Icicle Crash.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Rotom-W is immune to Earth Power and can easily survive any of Landorus's coverage moves and OHKO it back with Hydro Pump. Keldeo can OHKO with a Life Orb-boosted Hydro Pump, while Icy Wind has a high chance to OHKO and will also drop Landorus's teammate's Speed. Politoed, Gyarados, Suicune, Jellicent, and Ludicolo can all take a hit and KO with their STAB moves. Landorus is threatened by different Pokemon depending on its coverage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon:  Mega Metagross KOs with Ice Punch, while offensive Thundurus and Raikou outspeed and OHKO Landorus with Hidden Power Ice.

Gengar can hit hard with Icy Wind and drop Landorus's Speed, leaving it open to attacks.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind and Trick Room: Landorus has a very poor matchup against Trick Room, as it can't do much to Cresselia, which can either take a hit and use Trick Room or attack Landorus with Ice Beam. Mega Abomasnow can destroy Landorus with Blizzard while Trick Room is up. Zapdos can take a hit and set up Tailwind, putting Landorus in a bad position, or simply OHKO Landorus with Hidden Power Ice. Suicune can get Tailwind up, use Snarl to weaken Landorus, or OHKO it with Ice Beam. In general, a lot of slower Pokemon with powerful STAB moves beat Landorus that normally wouldn't while Trick Room or Tailwind is up, as Landorus is fairly frail.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earth Power gains a boost from Sheer Force, meaning it is able to always OHKO Shuca Berry Heatran. Sludge Bomb deals big damage to Fairy- and Grass-types, and Psychic can also hit Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Breloom, and Venusaur. Hidden Power Ice provides coverage mainly used for Landorus-T. Rock Slide is another option; with the Sheer Force and Life Orb boosts, it has a chance to OHKO Mega Charizard Y, who Landorus narrowly outruns, also nailing Talonflame. On the other hand, Focus Blast can always OHKO Mega Kangaskhan and standard Ferrothorn. Protect keeps Landorus safe for the turn and stalls out opposing Tailwind and Trick Room.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack EVs paired with Sheer Force allow for maximum damage output. 252 Speed EVs coupled with a Timid Nature ensure Landorus outspeeds base 100 Speed Pokemon. The 4 spare EVs go into Special Defense. Life Orb boosts the power of Landorus's attacks with secondary effects, and Sheer Force means that Landorus won't take Life Orb recoil when using such moves. If running Rock Slide, Landorus can run a Naive or Hasty Nature in order to guarantee the OHKO on bulky variants of Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Landorus's ability to always OHKO Shuca Berry Heatran is great, as it takes the guessing out of whether Heatran will survive and hit back or not. Landorus works best mid- and late-game when foes that can outspeed and threaten it have been removed, as Sheer Force- and Life Orb-boosted Earth Power will finish off almost anything under half health that doesn't resist it. Landorus is frail and doesn't take neutral hits well, so it is not a great switch-in most of the time. Its good defensive typing is rendered almost useless due to its frailty, and its Electric-type immunity is almost useless because most Electric-types carry Hidden Power Ice or are immune to Ground, such as Rotom-H, Zapdos, and Thundurus, and other Electric-types, such as Raikou and Choice Scarf Rotom-W, outspeed it. Its resistance to Fighting doesn't help much either, as Terrakion's Close Combat followed by a Rock Slide 2HKOes Landorus, so it can't switch in. It is vulnerable to speed control, as it likes to move first to attempt to get a KO without suffering a hit back.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Steel-types such as Aegislash and Mega Metagross like Landorus's ability to obliterate Fire- and Steel-types with Earth Power, and they can remove Ice-types such as Kyurem-B for Landorus. Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir also appreciate how well Landorus beats Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types with Earth Power. Cresselia and Jirachi can use Icy Wind or Thunder Wave to slow down a faster threat and use Helping Hand to let Landorus net a KO that would otherwise be out of its reach. Jirachi can also switch in to Ice-type attacks for Landorus. Thundurus is able to use Thunder Wave to slow threats down and Taunt to stop opposing speed control users, while Landorus beats the Electric-types that Thundurus can't. Bulky Water-types to switch into Water- and Ice-types for Landorus are appreciated. Suicune is a nice example, as it has access to Tailwind and Icy Wind and can beat most Ice-types; Rotom-W can beat Ice- and Water-types as well. Landorus can beat Grass-types for them both with Sludge Bomb. Zapdos beats Water-types and can provide Tailwind to allow Landorus to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Serperior and Breloom also beat Water-types. Mega Abomasnow appreciates Fire- and Steel-type foes such as Heatran and Aegislash being removed so that it can spam Blizzard without worrying about them switching in, so it appreciates Landorus as a partner.</p> "

  "Landorus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting a solid mix of qualities that give it the ability to function as a check to a significant portion of the DOU metagame all by itself, Landorus-T is an omnipresent metagame-defining force. A handy ability in Intimidate lets Landorus-T function as a dependable check to physical attackers, most notably including Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Diancie, and opposing Landorus-T. Its excellent neutral coverage, along with its sky-high base 145 Attack, also lets it reliably deal damage against anything it faces, and it has access to U-turn and just the right Speed—base 91—to make it a great user of Choice Scarf, which in turn gives it the sufficient Speed needed to outrun everything in the unboosted metagame except base 150s in Mega Aerodactyl and Deoxys-A. The aforementioned traits let it effectively function as a utility check to anything as needed, depending on the match-up and situation. Aside from holding a Choice Scarf, Landorus-T can also take advantage of its great Attack and decent Speed, which is still enough to outrun a decent portion of the metagame unboosted with a Life Orb set that is effective at smashing holes at an opponent's team with powerful blows while still able to deter opposing physical attackers. All that being said, Landorus-T fits easily on any kind of team due to how it can effectively check a number of the most influential Pokemon in DOU, back its team up against the plethora of physical attackers in the metagame with Intimidate, and function as an offensive juggernaut while rarely causing synergy problems thanks to being a rare Ground-type.</p> <p>Due to having to rely on a Choice Scarf to be at its most effective, Landorus-T can be easy to play around once it reveals what it's locked into. In addition, without a Choice Scarf, Landorus-T becomes prone to being outrun and KOed by threats it usually outspeeds such as Keldeo and Latios. Landorus-T is also typically beat by Water-types such as Rotom-W and Azumarill and is, for the most part, a liability against rain.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Band set is viable, but Landorus-T must give up either the Speed provided with Choice Scarf or the ability to use Protect. Hidden Power Ice is an option to defeat opposing Landorus-T. Life Orb can be used to increase Landorus-T's damage output significantly. Yache Berry is tempting, but bulky Landorus-T can already survive most Hidden Power Ice attacks and, besides that, Landorus-T will often be targetted with more common Water-type attacks anyway. Substitute can be used to ease prediction, protect Landorus-T from status effects and Intimidate, and to act as a cushion against faster checks. Swords Dance and Rock Polish can be used to boost Landorus-T's stats to terrifying levels. Stealth Rock is great to check opposing Pokemon such as Charizard, Mega Pinsir and Talonflame, but it has less utility in Doubles as compared to singles because there is less switching, and due to the fast-paced nature of the metagame it's harder to find time to set it up. Imprison is an interesting option that can be used to prevent the opponent from using the common Protect, Earthquake, and Rock Slide. Gravity is another interesting option to remove immunities to Ground-type attacks and also reduce the evasion of all Pokemon on the field.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Water-types such as Rotom-W, Suicune, and Azumarill can easily take anything Landorus-T can hit them with and retaliate with a super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon: Ice-types such as Kyurem-B and Weavile can nab the swift KO with their respective STAB moves but have to be wary of getting sniped by Landorus-T's Superpower or Rock-type coverage. Landorus-T also has to be wary of getting picked off by Ice Shard Weavile. Icy Wind from threats such as Jirachi lowers Landorus-T's Speed while also hitting super effectively. Hidden Power Ice is also a relatively common coverage move in the Doubles metagame, so threats such as Landorus-I and Thundurus are worth watching out for.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon: Once it's Choice-locked into Earthquake, Flying-types and foes with Levitate such as Salamence, Thundurus, and Rotom-W can easily take advantage of Landorus-T.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Intimidate and burns limit Landorus-T's damage output, hampering its ability to revenge kill or clean up late-game and generally lowering its impact throughout a match. Salamence, Gyarados, and opposing Landorus-T can soften its blows with Intimidate, with the former two also having access to Water-type coverage to smack it around. Gengar and Rotom-W can burn Landorus-T, permanently neutering it for a whole game.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: As it can't run Protect, Choice Scarf Landorus-T fares poorly against faster foes due to being unable to defend itself. Deoxys-A and Choice Scarf Kyurem-B can OHKO it with Psycho Boost and Ice Beam, respectively, while Ludicolo and Venusaur under their respective favorable weathers can deal significant damage to Landorus-T, with the former being able to OHKO it with a rain-boosted Hydro Pump. Without a Choice Scarf, Landorus-T is left prone to being outrun by an assortment of threats, including Keldeo and Latios, both of which are also capable of OHKOing it.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind and Trick Room: Without its Speed advantage, Choice Scarf Landorus-T struggles to be effective, as it can no longer take out threats it beats in normal conditions, and since it lacks Protect, it can't stall out field conditions such as Tailwind and Trick Room. Trick Room from the likes of Cresselia and Jellicent can turn around its Speed advantage, while Tailwind from foes such as Talonflame, Salamence, and Suicune takes away the said Speed advantage entirely.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard: Wide Guard from the likes of Aegislash and Conkeldurr blocks Landorus-T's spread moves, limiting its offensive potential.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out: Choice Scarf Landorus-T has no way of blocking Fake Out from foes such as Mega Kangaskhan and Weavile, which stuns it for a turn.</p> <p><strong>Defiant and Competitive: Landorus-T has to be wary of its Intimidate against Bisharp and Milotic, as they can easily punish that with a boost to their appropriate attacking stats with Defiant or Competitive.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is a STAB spread move that lets Landorus-T deal consistent, reliable damage. Either of Rock Slide or Stone Edge is fine for the next slot, as Landorus-T appreciates Rock-type coverage in order to hit Ground-immune foes; Rock Slide deals decent spread damage and can net free turns with its flinch chance, while Stone Edge hits much harder, though single target, and is nifty for getting around Wide Guard and achieving swift OHKOs on super effective targets such as Thundurus and Mega Charizard Y. U-turn lets Landorus-T switch out while dealing chip damage, allowing its team to position better and possibly maintain momentum, and it also hits threats such as Hoopa-U and Latios super effectively. Superpower lets Landorus-T deal swift massive damage against the likes of Mega Kangaskhan, Hydreigon, and Ferrothorn at the cost of stat drops. Explosion can be an option in order to deal significant damage to the opposing side while sacrificing Landorus-T, also preserving momentum by providing a free switch to a teammate.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf boosts Landorus-T's Speed, letting it outrun foes it regularly won't up to base 135 Speed Pokemon and lets it be a general fast threat. Maximum Attack and Speed investment lets Landorus-T be as fast and powerful as possible. If desired, one can optimize by taking EVs off Speed and Attack, still leaving enough to hit a benchmark, in order to invest on bulk instead. For example, a spread of 44 HP / 252 Atk / 212 Spe gives some bulk while still allowing Landorus-T to outspeed Mega Manectric and Mega Lopunny, while 8 HP / 228 Atk / 88 Def / 184 Spe lets it outrun Mega Gengar and avoid the OHKO from Life Orb Bisharp's +1 Sucker Punch and the 2HKO from -1 Life Orb Talonflame's Brave Bird. It is important to note that having a slower Landorus-T helps in the mirror match-up, as having the slower U-turn helps maintain momentum, but this also makes it more vulnerable to flinching from opposing Rock Slide. Jolly is usable in order to surprise those that generally creep for the much more common Adamant, but the drop in general damage output is very noticeable.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Landorus-T can fit well on any kind of team due to having a unique assortment of niches that lets it function in both offensive and subtle supportive roles while at the same time causing little or unnoticeable overlap synergy-wise. Thanks to its high Speed with a Choice Scarf and incredible neutral coverage, Landorus-T can function as a utility check of sorts against anything in the metagame as a match dictates due to it being able to land a clean unresisted hit against threats more often than not. One should, when possible, take advantage of Intimidate, as with it Landorus-T can check the numerous physical attackers in the metagame such as Mega Diancie and Mega Kangaskhan; switching in Landorus-T against opposing physical attackers can be a good idea in order to use Intimidate and soften their blows, helping teammates take their hits better. However, be wary of Bisharp, as Defiant can easily punish that with an Attack boost.</p> <p>Landorus-T can function as an effective lead that is adept at gaining back momentum and position right after with U-turn; leading it is also useful for neutering physical attackers at game start, putting its team in a good position early. Frequently coming in and out with U-turn can possibly be a good set of plays, as this lets Landorus-T repeatedly use Intimidate while at the same time dealing chip damage against the opposing team that will slowly add up. However, one has to watch out for when Landorus-T can't afford to make the mistake of hitting a Protecting foe and being forced to stay on the field and take a hit. In situations like those, it's usually better to hard switch. Generally speaking, one should be careful with managing Landorus-T's health, as frequently pivoting into attackers may leave it vulnerable to getting sniped by priority users such as Mega Kangaskhan and Talonflame.</p> <p>Landorus-T should snipe threats with Superpower whenever it gets the chance in order to swiftly put select foes out of play early; it has to watch out for the stat drops that come after, however, but ideally Landorus-T should switch out after getting a KO regardless due to the opponent being able to switch in a check for free. Still, one should also be wary of a foe switching out to a Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Amoonguss, which could prove to be fatal, as Landorus-T is then locked into an unfavorable move against a threat it has no chance of beating. Landorus-T can also be effective at both being a revenge killer and late-game cleaner thanks to its high Speed; specifically, once foes that have Intimidate are gone and the opposing team is weakened, Landorus-T can easily clean up with its high Speed and strong spread moves. Also, when at a disadvantage, playing to your outs by relying on flinches from Rock Slide can be a good last-ditch play.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that are immune to Ground, such as Thundurus, Rotom-W and Latios, make for good partners, as Landorus-T can safely use Earthquake next to them without fear of hitting a teammate. Landorus-T and Talonflame in particular work well, as hey can pack a formidable one-two punch with the former continually wearing a team down and he latter sniping off weakened threats with priority Brave Bird. Spread-attacking teammates, such as Mega Diancie, Heatran, and Mega Gardevoir, also appreciate Landorus-T's presence, as it can continually whittle down foes enough for them to finish the job efficiently later on. As Landorus-T has difficulty matching up against Water-types, teammates that can beat them are appreciated. Grass-, Electric-, and Dragon-types such as Amoonguss, Thundurus, and Latios work well, as all of them in some way have typing advantage against Water-types. Partners that can take out opposing Landorus-T are appreciated as well; Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune can easily KO them with their STAB moves, while Kyurem-B can swiftly remove Landorus-T with its Ice Beam. Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon also make for good picks in order to take advantage of Landorus-T's ability to deal with Steel- and Fire-types well. Since Landorus-T is a physical attacker, Bisharp is a decent partner for dissuading opposing Intimidate users with Defiant. However, one should be wary, as Landorus-T can't use Earthquake next to Bisharp without taking out its teammate with friendly fire.</p> "

        "name": "Assault Vest Pivot",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is all but mandatory on any Landorus-T set in Doubles OU thanks to its consistent spread damage and ability to OHKO popular Pokemon like Heatran. Rock Slide allows Landorus-T to significantly damage the popular Flying-type Pokemon in the tier such as Thundurus, Mega Charizard Y, and Talonflame, usually scoring OHKOs on the last two. Superpower gives Landorus-T valuable coverage against the likes of Mega Kangaskhan and Hydreigon, and it also provides a way for it to damage Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn without putting its partner in the way of an Earthquake. Knock Off is also a popular choice on Assault Vest Landorus-T thanks to the immense utility that removing a Pokemon’s held item carries. Notably, Knock Off can cripple Pokemon that rely on items for recovery, such as Leftovers Aegislash or Sitrus Berry Belly Drum Azumarill. Finally, U-turn is an excellent choice on most any Pokemon that can learn it, letting Landorus-T switch out to recycle its invaluable Intimidate while chipping away at its target. U-turn also provides some unique coverage that covers for the choice made in the third moveslot, hitting both Dark- and Psychic-types super effectively in the absence of either Superpower or Knock Off.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Especially in conjunction with Intimidate, Assault Vest provides a significant boost to Landorus-T’s bulk when compared to the more popular Choice Scarf set. Instead of opting purely for Speed and Attack, this Landorus-T is invested in HP and Special Defense such that it will always survive a Steam Eruption from Modest Volcanion. The Speed EVs let Landorus-T outspeed positive-natured Pokemon with base 70 Speed, such as Volcanion, Breloom, and Bisharp. The remaining EVs are dumped into Attack; coupled with an Adamant nature, this allows Landorus-T to remain an offensive threat. This EV spread is not set in stone, however, as Landorus-T is a Pokemon with a very flexible role that should be adapted to the team around it. Some Assault Vest Landorus-T variants are content with the Special Defense boost from the Assault Vest alone and instead use a simple EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe and a Jolly nature in order to outspeed and heavily damage neutral natured Mega Kangaskhan and Hydreigon. For a combination of Speed and bulk, Assault Vest Landorus-T can use an EV spread of 112 HP / 156 Atk / 16 Def / 4 SpD / 220 Spe with a Jolly nature to outspeed Adamant Mega Kangaskhan and survive both a +1 Sucker Punch from Life Orb Bisharp and a sun-boosted Overheat from Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Assault Vest Landorus-T functions best as a bulky pivot. Thanks to Intimidate, Assault Vest, and a passable defensive typing, it is able to switch into and absorb a wide variety of attacks before being knocked out. Generally, Assault Vest Landorus-T is used to weaken a physical attack for an important teammate and pivot back out with U-turn to provide another teammate with a safe switch. While this bulkier set tends to act as a bit of a punching bag, it is important to remember that even a bulkier Landorus-T functions well as an offensive check to some of the most common Pokemon in the metagame. Thus, making sure that Landorus-T stays healthy enough to handle the threats it needs to check is crucial.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon with naturally lower Defense stats that benefit more from Intimidate support appreciate the bulkier Assault Vest Landorus-T as a partner thanks to its ability to cycle Intimidate more often throughout the battle. Mega Gardevoir is a prime example of such a Pokemon, as its sky-high Special Defense is complemented very well by Landorus-T’s Intimidate. Additionally, Mega Gardevoir typically runs Trick Room, which can turn the generally lower speed on Assault Vest Landorus-T into an advantage. Any Landorus-T set appreciates having partners that are immune to Ground-type attacks so it can freely use Earthquake, and the Assault Vest set is no exception. In keeping with the bulkier theme, Rotom-W and Thundurus can often be seen accompanying Landorus-T thanks to their ability to beat the Water-types that give Landorus-T problems. Both of these Pokemon often carry status moves, such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, that further cripple opposing Pokemon, creating a nasty combination that some teams have trouble breaking. Finally, Landorus-T’s vulnerability to Ice-type attacks means that Pokemon like Keldeo and Heatran make good partners for their Ice resistances and super effective STAB attacks.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Life Orb Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Landorus-T's main STAB move and is quite destructive with the power boost from a Life Orb, ensuring KOs on the likes of Heatran, even through a Shuca Berry. It is generally Landorus-T's go-to move to KO Steel-types such as Aegislash and Heatran, as well as Mega Diancie. Landorus-T greatly appreciates a Rock-type move so it can hit Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate that enjoy switching into Earthquakes, with the main options being Stone Edge and Rock Slide. Stone Edge is preferred over Rock Slide mainly to pick up the OHKO on certain threats such as bulky Thundurus thanks to the Life Orb boost and to ignore Wide Guard. Rock Slide is still a viable option over Stone Edge for those preferring a spread move with greater accuracy and a 30 percent flinch chance, but this comes at the cost of damage output. Superpower is used mainly to pick up KOs on Mega Kangaskhan and Hydreigon, but the stat drops can leave Landorus-T in a bad spot for follow-up attacks on the next turn. Knock Off is another option that can be used to get rid of important items such as Sitrus Berry and Choice Scarf on Pokemon such as opposing Landorus-T. It is also a useful tool to attack Aegislash for super effective damage without fear of Wide Guard. Lastly, Protect is a staple move in doubles and is quite unexpected on Landorus-T because most of them run the Choice Scarf set.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Jolly nature is generally preferred for Life Orb Landorus-T, as it lets it outspeed and pick up KOs on Mega Kangaskhan and Hydreigon, which commonly run a neutral Speed nature. Maximum Attack and Speed investment is run to outspeed as many foes as possible and hit as hard as possible. An Adamant nature can be run if one does not mind the loss of Speed and prefers to have a chance of OHKOing Zapdos with Stone Edge, as well as the boost in overall damage output. Note that it's best not to run an Adamant nature when using Superpower.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Life Orb Landorus-T is a wallbreaker that can tear holes through the opposing team thanks to its heavy damage output, which in turn can help its teammates clean up. Before revealing the Life Orb through the recoil, you can generally bluff a Choice Scarf set, as it is the most common item on Landorus-T. You can often get a free turn by revealing Protect at an unexpected moment for similar reasons. Landorus-T is also often a good lead because of its ability to weaken the opposing two Pokemon with Intimidate as well as its great number of good match-ups in the metagame.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Talonflame appreciates Landorus-T's ability to beat Heatran and Thundurus and has priority to help Landorus-T versus threats that outspeed it such as Keldeo. It also greatly benefits from prior damage on the opposing team so it may clean with Brave Bird more easily, and Landorus-T is able to deal massive damage to help with just that. Keldeo is a great partner, as it threatens Kyurem-B, Bisharp, and Jolly Mega Kangaskhan, which could pose an issue to Landorus-T. Other Water-types like Suicune and Rotom-W resist both Ice- and Water-type attacks, which hit Landorus-T super effectively, making them good options to switch out to. Latios is great for its ability to beat Keldeo as well as set up Tailwind to make Landorus-T a threat to Pokemon that outspeed it normally. Other Tailwind setters or Pokemon with speed control such as Suicune, Thundurus, and Zapdos are great to support Landorus-T. Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon greatly appreciate Landorus-T's ability to beat Fire- and Steel-types so they may hammer away at the opposing team with Hyper Voice. Earthquake-immune partners like Latios, Hydreigon, Thundurus, Rotom-W, Mega Charizard Y, and Talonflame work great to freely spam Earthquake. Spread attacking cleaners such as Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Gardevoir also appreciate Landorus-T knocking opposing Pokemon's health bars into a range where they may easily be cleaned up.</p> "

  "Kyurem-Black": {
    "overview": "<p>Kyurem-B is a fantastic answer to defensive or bulkier teams, especially with its Substitute set. Teravolt allows Kyurem-B to bypass abilities on Pokemon that would otherwise slow it down, like Levitate on Rotom-W and Thick Fat on Mega Venusaur. It can also run a decent mixed attacking set thanks to its great offensive stats complemented by decent coverage. Due to the high number of common Pokemon that it threatens, including Amoonguss, Landorus-T, and Thundurus, Kyurem-B can find a place on almost any team. However, it is especially notable as a good choice for rain teams, considering its ability to beat bulky Grass-types and Thundurus, as well as a good choice to counter rain teams thanks to its ability to wall Ludicolo and bulky Water-types. Although it is powerful and bulky, Kyurem-B is stuck with an unfortunate Speed tier, just missing out on base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Gardevoir, and Salamence. It also lacks a good physical movepool, leaving Kyurem-B unable to take advantage of its sky-high Attack stat. In addition to this, while many popular threats are beaten by Kyurem-B, it can also find itself in matchups where it is dead weight, especially if running Choice Scarf.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Blizzard can be used with hail support on either set, as it provides massive spread damage. Draco Meteor can be used on the Choice Scarf set, but the drop in power after the first use usually makes this an inferior choice. Outrage is extremely powerful and could also find a place on the Choice Scarf set, but it doesn't allow you to choose a target and prevents Kyurem-B from switching out of unfavorable matchups. Zen Headbutt could be used on the Choice Scarf set to take care of the Fighting-types that give Kyurem-B trouble, but most Pokemon that would fear Zen Headbutt are already threatened by its other, superior coverage options. Icy Wind is the only support move that could be considered viable on Kyurem-B, providing some speed control. However, it is quite weak and Kyurem-B is usually better off with Ice Beam. Roost could be used over Protect on the Substitute set for more longevity, but Protect tends to be more useful. A Life Orb set with Fusion Bolt / Ice Beam / Earth Power / Protect can act as a good middle ground between the Substitute and Choice Scarf sets, but usually those sets are more useful.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: Substitute Kyurem-B struggles with fast Fighting-types like Keldeo and Terrakion, which can outspeed and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon can take any attack except for Iron Head and OHKO through Kyurem-B's Substitute with Hyper Voice, making them really strong counters. Mega Diancie can beat either set unless the Choice Scarf variant is carrying Iron Head; otherwise, it can take anything from either set and OHKO the Choice Scarf set with Diamond Storm or outspeed the Substitute set and 2HKO it with Diamond Storm or Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Mega Metagross takes any of Choice Scarf Kyurem-B's attacks and OHKOes it with Iron Head, as well as outspeeding the Substitute set and getting the same result. Ferrothorn resists all of Kyurem-B's attacks and can KO either set with Gyro Ball. Aegislash can handily take an Earth Power and KO with Flash Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Burns whittle down Substitute Kyurem-B's health, preventing it from lasting as long, and severely weaken the majority of Choice Scarf Kyurem-B's moves. Intimidate also hinders the Choice Scarf set's effectiveness, though much less strongly.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick oom</strong>: Thunder Wave, Tailwind, and Trick Room take away the biggest draw to using Choice Scarf Kyurem-B over any other set and should be avoided or prevented if possible.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute gives the set its name, allowing Kyurem-B to avoid status and chip damage. It also gives Kyurem-B a defensive buffer, letting it avoid the KO from threats that would normally remove it from play and allowing it to attack safely. Ice Beam gets STAB and hits Grass-, Ground-, Dragon-, and Flying-types for lots of damage. Earth Power gives Kyurem-B perfect neutral coverage alongside Ice Beam, and it hits Levitate Pokemon like Rotom-W with the help of Teravolt. Protect allows you to scout for attacks, stall out field conditions such as Tailwind and Trick Room, and regain Kyurem-B's health with Leftovers.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers restores health lost from creating a Substitute, allowing Kyurem-B to live longer. 252 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature are used to deal the most damage possible, as Kyurem-B already has great natural bulk without investment. Running 148 Speed EVs allows Kyurem-B to outspeed all base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Bisharp and Breloom, forcing Bisharp to use Sucker Punch instead of Iron Head and avoiding Breloom's Spore with Substitute. Note that Breloom has a chance to 2HKO with Mach Punch, so play around it carefully. The remaining 108 EVs are placed into HP to create bigger Substitutes. Another spread you could opt for would be 52 HP / 232 SpA / 224 Spe and a Timid Nature, which has the advantage of outspeeding all non-Choice Scarf variants of Landorus-T and Modest Hydreigon. The bulk investment guarantees that standard Rotom-W sets cannot break Substitute, and while the power drop is noticeable due to the loss of Modest, Kyurem-B still hits many of the same OHKOs and 2HKOs.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Kyurem-B should use Substitute on a predicted switch or Protect, against non-threatening foes, or to avoid status, and from there it can target a threat safely behind its Substitute. When Kyurem-B has a Substitute set up, the opponent is likely to target it with both of their Pokemon on the field in order to remove the Substitute and KO it in the same turn. Accordingly, if you can predict a double target, it helps to use Protect in order to grant your partner a free turn. If Kyurem-B's checks are removed, getting up a Substitute often puts enough pressure on the opponent between its bulk and offensive presence that it almost acts as a 'win' button. However, don't feel like getting up a substitute is necessary; while it is very nice, Kyurem-B also does well without it, and sometimes getting an attack off is more important.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Kyurem-B can fit on the majority of teams thanks to its ability to pressure nearly everything in the metagame. That said, there are a few choices that can help Kyurem-B do its job better. Kyurem-B appreciates redirection support to help it set up Substitute. Amoonguss works well for this, as it resists the Fighting-type attacks that Kyurem-B hates and doesn't share any weaknesses with it. Kyurem-B also partners well with Water-type Pokemon such as Suicune and Rotom-W, as it resists everything they are weak to, while they threaten Rock-type Pokemon and Landorus-T, which can hit Kyurem-B for lots of damage. Mega Diancie works great as a teammate, because it checks most Dragon- and Fighting-types as well as Mega Charizard Y and benefits from the removal of Pokemon that Substitute Kyurem-B beats such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, Heatran, and Grass-types. Landorus-T works as a good offensive partner for similar reasons to Mega Diancie, with the added bonus of beating Steel-types that don't mind Earth Power as well as providing Intimidate support to make setting up and keeping a Substitute up easier for Kyurem-B. Substitute Kyurem-B is generally a good choice for rain teams, as it beats many of the common threats to rain sweepers, such as Mega Venusaur, Rotom-W, and Amoonguss. It also fits well on sun teams, taking advantage of Mega Charizard Y's powerful Heat Waves to set up Substitutes and checking the rain teams that give sun trouble. Aegislash stands out as a good partner for Kyurem-B, because it can block Rock Slide or Diamond Storm with Wide Guard and easily switches in on Fighting- and Rock-type attacks that force Kyurem-B out.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Beam gets STAB and hits hard, even with only 108 Special Attack EVs. Fusion Bolt completes a pseudo-BoltBeam coverage, hitting Water-types and Mega Charizard Y super effectively. Dragon Claw is Kyurem-B's strongest STAB move available, and coming from a fully invested base 170 Attack, it hits super hard. This also allows Kyurem-B to OHKO Dragon-types that avoid the KO from Ice Beam, such as Hydreigon, Latios, and Kingdra. The last moveslot depends on your team's needs. Iron Head KOes Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie and Mega Gardevoir, which otherwise give Kyurem-B lots of trouble. Earth Power hits Heatran and Rotom formes much harder than Kyurem-B's other options. Rock Slide provides spread damage as well as a 30% chance to induce flinch. Because Choice Scarf Kyurem-B is mostly used to pick off specific threats, Dragon Claw can be dropped from its moveset in favor of more coverage. One example of when to do this would be if the team struggles with Fairies as well as Heatran and other Steel-types, requiring Kyurem-B to run Iron Head and Earth Power on the same set.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With a Choice Scarf, 224 Speed EVs, and a Naive nature, Kyurem-B outspeeds all Choice Scarf Landorus-T sets as well as the entire unboosted metagame. 108 Special Attack EVs guarantee that Ice Beam will OHKO offensive Thundurus sets, and the remaining 176 EVs are placed in Attack to power up Kyurem-B's other moves, notably guaranteeing the OHKO on Hydreigon using Dragon Claw.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bring this set in after a teammate has fallen or as a lead the majority of the time; it doesn't have nearly the bulk that other sets enjoy. Be mindful of opposing Intimidate users or burns for a few reasons. First, this set is primarily focused on physical attacks, so either one hurts its effectiveness. Additionally, Kyurem-B is a Choice Scarf user that lacks access to a pivoting move, and if the opponent pressures Kyurem-B out with the threat of Will-O-Wisp or Intimidate, it will be forced to make a hard switch in order to avoid losing effectiveness. This can be difficult to do safely or without the loss of momentum. Choice Scarf Kyurem-B is fairly uncommon, so use it to net surprise KOs on Pokemon like Landorus-T, Hydreigon, and Mega Diancie, which expect to outspeed Kyurem-B and deal serious damage. Keep in mind the rest of the opponent's team when attacking; if multiple different moves work to get the KO that you're hoping for, go for the move that works best against the rest of the team, as Kyurem-B will be locked into it. This is especially relevant when deciding if you should use Dragon Claw: if the opponent has a Fairy-type in the back, it's probably a better idea to opt for a different move if possible.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because Choice Scarf locks Kyurem-B into one specific move, it often finds itself in unfavorable matchups and needs a partner to switch out to. Thus, teammates with good defensive synergy with Kyurem-B such as Aegislash, Mega Metagross, Suicune, and Rotom-W work well as partners. Aegislash and Metagross also beat the Rock-, Fighting-, and Fairy-types that trouble Kyurem-B. Bisharp works well to discourage Intimidate and remove Fairy-types, which is especially useful if you opt for a fourth move other than Iron Head. This Kyurem-B set has trouble with most Steel-types, so Heatran and Mega Charizard Y can help by taking care of them. Anything that has trouble with Landorus-T pairs well with Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, as this set is primarily geared towards removing Choice Scarf Landorus-T. This includes Heatran, Mega Diancie, Talonflame, and many others.</p> "

  "Keldeo": {
    "overview": "<p>Keldeo's unique Water / Fighting typing allows it to check many common threats in the metagame. This includes, but is not limited to, Heatran, Landorus-T, Bisharp, and Mega Kangaskhan. Keldeo also sports a very high base 108 Speed and strong base 129 Special Attack, allowing it to not only outspeed the aforementioned threats but OHKO them as well when holding a Life Orb, a rarity in this metagame. Keldeo's base 91 / 90 / 90 defenses aren't that bad either, helping it take a neutral hit or two and retaliate hard. It also has a few solid support options, including Icy Wind and Quick Guard. While all this makes Keldeo seem amazing, it does have its flaws. The Water typing which gives Keldeo such a large offensive presence also gives it a weakness to common Electric-types in the metagame, such as Rotom-W and Thundurus. While its bulk isn't bad, it is not amazing either, which, when coupled with Keldeo's reliance on its high Speed stat, leaves it vulnerable to speed control. Keldeo also has a very limited movepool, making it predictable and therefore easier to play around.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Substitute set with Leftovers, where Substitute is used over Quick Guard, is a solid option, making use of the switches Keldeo tends to force to protect itself from an incoming attack. Focus Blast can be used over Secret Sword due to its higher Base Power of 120, but usually the risk of it missing 30% of the time is not worth the increase in power, as Keldeo still gets the OHKOs it needs to with Secret Sword. Stone Edge is an incredibly surprising move that Keldeo can use to hit Mega Charizard Y. It OHKOes Charizard without any investment, something that Hydro Pump cannot do when Drought is active. Helping Hand can give an ally a 50% boost in power for their next attack, which is useful if Keldeo cannot do much damage to the opposing side or has removed all of the Pokemon it needed to, though these situations rarely occur. Safeguard can protect allies from status moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, Sleep Powder, and Spore. Coba Berry is a nifty item that Keldeo can make use of, as it helps it survive a Brave Bird from any Talonflame set, proceeding to OHKO it with a Water-type attack. Choice Specs is another item Keldeo can use, as it hits much harder than Life Orb without its harmful recoil effect. However, as a result, Keldeo cannot switch moves, forcing it to switch out if an opponent that resists its attacks switches in.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind and Trick Room: Opposing speed control shuts down Keldeo, as its Speed is its most important trait and without it Keldeo becomes very easy to 2HKO, if not OHKO. Thunder Wave, Tailwind, and Trick Room will all halt Keldeo's offensive capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame</strong>: Talonflame can come in on a Secret Sword or Icy Wind and OHKO Keldeo with a priority Brave Bird, ignoring any Speed drops. It has to watch out for Hydro Pump, however.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon</strong>: Latios can switch into Keldeo's STAB attacks and proceed to OHKO it with Psyshock. It must be wary of a super effective Icy Wind which makes it slower than Keldeo, though. Cresselia and other bulky Psychic-types are similar to Jellicent in that they can comfortably take multiple Hydro Pumps while hitting Keldeo with Psyshock, Icy Wind, Thunder Wave, or simply setting up Trick Room to \"slow it down\" for 5 turns, crippling Keldeo.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Bulky Rotom-W can tank two Secret Swords when factoring in Sitrus Berry and deal heavy damage with Thunderbolt. Fast Electric-types such as Thunduru and Raikou can deal heavy damage with Thunderbolt / Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Trevenant, Gourgeist-S, and Amoonguss can comfortably sit in front of Keldeo as they resist both of its STAB attacks, and because Icy Wind has a very low Base Power, it will be doing very little to them. These Grass-types can then proceed to hit Keldeo with their Grass-type STAB attacks or put it to sleep with Sleep Powder or Spore.</p> <p><strong>Jellicent: Jellicent is a complete wall to Keldeo, as it is immune to both of Keldeo's STAB attacks and resists Icy Wind, and can chip away at it with Shadow Ball, burn it with Will-O-Wisp, or simply set up Trick Room for its teammates.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This is Keldeo's most viable set, and it uses it very well. Hydro Pump is the chosen Water-type STAB, and it deals a lot of damage to any non-resisting opponent, of which, due to the great neutral coverage of Water-type attacks, there are many. Secret Sword is Keldeo's most reliable Fighting-type STAB attack, and it scores an OHKO on 4 / 0 Mega Kangaskhan. It can also hit opposing Water-types which resist Hydro Pump, like Rotom-W and Ludicolo, as well as hitting Ferrothorn for super effective damage. Quick Guard blocks opposing priority moves such as incoming Fake Out and Talonflame's Brave Bird, which is super effective against Keldeo. Taunt is always a useful move, stopping Protect, Spore, and most importantly Trick Room. Icy Wind is another support option here, as it gives Keldeo a spread attack that slows the opposing Pokemon down, letting Keldeo's ally outspeed them. Finally, Protect is a staple move in Doubles, as it can stall out weather conditions and Trick Room turns, as well as protect Keldeo from any attack while its partner takes its turn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Keldeo simply maximizes its Special Attack and Speed because it is meant to be hitting as hard as possible and Keldeo and Terrakion speed ties are fairly common. Life Orb is the preferred item for this set, as it allows Keldeo to get several OHKOs it couldn't achieve otherwise.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Keldeo should be brought in against Pokemon that it can threaten, such as Heatran, Landorus-T,  Mega Kangaskhan, and Bisharp. However, Keldeo should not be played recklessly, and it must be brought in on an expected attack that it resists or after a teammate has fainted, or else Life Orb recoil and switch in damage will build up quickly. If Quick Guard is used over Icy Wind, Keldeo should be mainly used against Fake Out users such as Kangaskhan so its partner can attack without fear of getting flinched. It can also be used to block powerful priority attacks such as Talonflame's Brave Bird, and can stop Prankster Thunder Wave, among other things. However, this often requires proper prediction, as the opponent might expect it and use an attack without priority instead, wasting your turn. If carried, Icy Wind can be used to slow down opposing threats for a partner or to hit both opponents when a Follow Me / Rage Powder supporter like Togekiss or Amoonguss, respectively, is on the field. It can also help Keldeo slow down faster threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Choice Scarf Thundurus-T and pick them off afterwards. Once Keldeo has defeated the foes it was meant to check, it can proceed to hit everything as hard as possible. Be careful of Hoopa-U, as although Keldeo outspeeds and hits Hoopa-U hard, Secret Sword is not likely to OHKO even uninvested Hoopa-U, which can easily OHKO back with Hyperspace Hole. As long as its teammates can handle the remaining members of the opposing team, keeping Keldeo alive won't be a major issue.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because of its ability to counter multiple major Doubles threats, Keldeo can find a spot on almost any team. Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Gourgeist-S make good teammates, as they can switch into common Electric- and Grass-type attacks that are super effective against Keldeo. In particular, they are great for being able to handle Rotom-W, which is probably the most common threat to Keldeo. Electric- and Rock-types are also good teammates, being useful for dealing with Talonflame and other Flying-types that Keldeo is weak to. A notable choice here is Mega Manectric. Before Mega Evolving, it has the ability Lightning Rod to draw in super effective Electric-type attacks for Keldeo. Once it has Mega Evolved, it gains the useful ability Intimidate to weaken physical attackers. It also acts as a good Talonflame switch-in, resisting its priority Brave Bird. Dark-types, such as Bisharp, make good teammates as well, handling Psychic-types for Keldeo. Those with access to Sucker Punch are particularly helpful for dealing with Latios, a very common threat to Keldeo which resists both of its STAB attacks. Fire-types that beat Pokemon like Amoonguss and Venusaur are particularly helpful, as those two resist both of Keldeo's STAB attacks too. Heatran and Rotom-H are especially effective as they also wall Talonflame, though Chandelure, Talonflame, and others are also very effective. Rage Powder / Follow Me support from Amoonguss or Togekiss is a useful asset to Keldeo, redirecting particularly threatening attacks and helping it stay around for longer to check the Pokemon it needs to.</p> "

  "Genesect": {
    "overview": "<p>Genesect is a great Pokemon in the Doubles metagame, as it's considerable for building its team's momentum thanks to a powerful U-turn. Download can provide Genesect with offensive presence once it has switched in, but Genesect has no way to control the chances of getting the boost it requires. Genesect can be very vulnerable to attacks when running Choice Scarf, as it can make Genesect Choice-locked into a poor move that gives certain opposing Pokemon a free switch in, such as Fire-types switching into Ice Beam. While Genesect isn't too flexible, it can use items besides Choice Scarf, but they give Genesect an odd Speed tier, making it slower than positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y, and because Genesect has mediocre defenses it requires a lot of team support in order to function well. On the other hand, Choice Scarf grants Genesect the ability to outspeed and OHKO top threats, most notably Choice Scarf Landorus-T.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Genesect can also use a specially offensive Choice Scarf set with Energy Ball or Thunderbolt if you really need coverage against Water-types. Thunder is usable if you want to use Genesect on a rain team. A non-Choice Scarf set with either Life Orb or Expert Belt is a decent option, as it capitalizes on Genesect's wide range of coverage and allows Genesect to bluff a Choice Scarf and get surprise KOs. Choice Band is also an option, as it allows Genesect to hit foes really hard. Extreme Speed can help Genesect outprioritize other priority move users such as Mega Kangaskhan, Bisharp, and Talonflame.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame can easily beat Genesect, especially if Genesect lacks Thunderbolt. Bulkier Fire-types such as Rotom-H, Heatran, and Mega Camerupt can also easily beat Genesect, as Genesect's attacks do pitiful damage against them, while they can all retaliate back with their own super effective STAB Fire-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Suicune, Politoed tank most of the moves that Genesect throws at them, but they don't appreciate taking a U-turn and losing momentum.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash: Finally, Aegislash can tank all of Genesect's moves, as even Flamethrower is a 3HKO without the Download boost, and hit it right back with Shadow Ball. Aegislash can also carry Weakness Policy, and if the player is completely unaware of that, Aegislash will tank the Flamethrower from Genesect and OHKO it right back with a +2 Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: Intimidate users such as Scrafty and Gyarados can easily frighten Genesect, as Genesect's attacks won't do much to any of these Pokemon. Gyarados, however, isn't much of a threat if Genesect is running Thunderbolt. Genesect also needs to avoid burns as much as possible, as its STAB moves won't be doing that much if it gets crippled by burns and the residual damage will also wear down it quickly. Thus, Genesect needs to stay away from Pokemon that can use Will-O-Wisp, including Rotom-W, Gengar, and Jellicent.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Moves such as Thunder Wave, Tailwind, and Trick Room can cripple Genesect by taking away its Speed advantage. Common users of these moves include Rotom-W, Rotom-H, Thundurus, Suicune, Talonflame, Jirachi, Cresselia, and Jellicent.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>U-turn is Genesect's main STAB move, and it also allows Genesect to switch out from a foe that checks it to an appropriate partner. Iron Head is Genesect's secondary STAB move and is more spammable as well, if you have some momentum to spare. It also has a nifty chance to cause the target to flinch, and without this move Genesect pretty much can't do anything to Fairy-types. Ice Beam helps Genesect take on foes such as Landorus-T, which Genesect is dead weight against otherwise. Explosion is another option for Genesect, as it allows it to pull off a last-ditch effort once it's weakened enough to the point where it can't do much back to the opposing team. Flamethrower is another option that gives Genesect coverage against a wide range of foes, namely Steel-types such as Aegislash, Ferrothorn, and Metagross.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>192 Speed EVs with a Naive nature allow Genesect to outspeed threats such as Jolly Landorus-T equipped with Choice Scarf and Naive Deoxys-A. The Attack EVs maximize Genesect's physical damage output, allowing its STAB moves to deal as much damage as possible. The leftover EVs are dumped into Special Attack to increase Genesect's special offense. A Naive nature is used over Hasty to prevent Genesect from being more susceptible to priority moves than it already is.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Genesect is a good choice in the early-game, as it can utilize its powerful U-turn to switch into the Pokemon appropriate for the situation, quickly putting your opponent on the defensive. However, Genesect should play carefully around Protect, the most common move in the metagame, as its poor defenses prevent it from taking hits well and even neutral damage will quickly shorten its lifespan. Another thing to remember is that Genesect should not be used as a sweeper, but rather as a means of putting holes into your opponent's team and gathering offensive momentum. That being said, Genesect is also capable of being a revenge killer thanks to its high Speed and offenses.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Genesect has a rough time dealing with opposing speed control, so Pokemon that can prevent the use of Trick Room, Thunder Wave, and Tailwind are viable teammates. This includes Taunt users such as Gyarados, Thundurus, and Terrakion. Pokemon that can handle Fire-types are exceptional teammates for Genesect. This includes Water-types such as Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Gyarados. Rock-types such as Terrakion and Mega Diancie can also check Fire-types. Garchomp is a solid option, because it beats common Fire-types such as Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and Talonflame while Genesect deals with Garchomp's checks such as Diancie, Latios, Kyurem-B, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and Landorus-T. Genesect also fears opposing Water-types because they can force it out, as it really wouldn't like burned by Scald. Dragon-types do an excellent job of dealing with Water-types because they don't mind switching in on them, and Genesect can help them in return by dealing with Fairy-types, Landorus-T, and even Steel-types. Pokemon that take advantage of Genesect's momentum are good teammates, especially those that capitalize on the Fire-types that Genesect lures in. Pokemon that can take advantage of Genesect's momentum and its ability to lure in Fire-types, such as Calm Mind Cresselia, Substitute attackers such as Kyurem B and Heatran, and even Belly Drum Azumarill, are great teammates. If you're using Explosion on Genesect, using a Ghost-type partner such as Gengar is a good idea, as it gives you something to switch in while Genesect is going for Explosion so none of your Pokemon get caught in the crossfire.</p> "

While it has a unique pure Fairy typing for a setter, it also only has better-than-average bulk, which still leaves it pummeled by strong attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y. Unlike some of the frailer Trick Room setters, Aromatisse also lacks offensive presence, making it mostly dead weight after getting Trick Room up and often leaving it as setup fodder for the likes of Mega Kangaskhan and Heatran. Aroma Veil is its sole saving grace, as it prevents it from getting stopped by Taunt, but even that is outweighed by Aromatisse's downfalls and the fact that playing around Taunt with bulkier or less momentum-draining setters is more beneficial in the long run.

Heal Pulse is useful for supporting teammates that lack reliable recovery options.

Safety Goggles is Aromatisse's primary item choice, as it lets Aromatisse set up Trick Room in front of common sleep users such as Amoonguss, another common method of preventing Trick Room. Sitrus Berry can be helpful, however, to keep Aromatisse in the match for longer, though it does leave it more vulnerable to Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Venusaur. The EV spread with a Relaxed nature allows Aromatisse to survive Life Orb Bisharp's Iron Head, helping ensure that Trick Room is set up. A Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs allow it to move before Pokemon such as Amoonguss when Trick Room is in effect. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Defense to improve Aromatisse's general bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It's typically best to set Trick Room as soon as possible, so Aromatisse acts quite well as a lead. Aroma Veil helps to ensure that Trick Room will be set, blocking some of the more common ways to prevent Trick Room. Aromatisse does not have to lead, however, and can set up Trick Room later in the game if need be. If a possible Fake Out user is on the opponent's side of the field, Aromatisse should use Protect in order to avoid taking unnecessary damage, as the move is commonly used to prevent the usage of Trick Room. If Sitrus Berry is used as the item, make sure to be wary of possible sleep inducers. Aromatisse is a Pokemon that should be played very actively, switching in and out to reset Trick Room and heal its partner. Moonblast should only be used if Aromatisse is facing an especially frail foe or one weak to Fairy-types, as otherwise it will fail to do significant damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Slow Pokemon such as Heatran, Conkeldurr, and Mega Abomasnow make for good partners, as they can use Trick Room to its fullest extent due to their low base Speed and high attacking stats. Using their super effective STAB moves, Heatran and Conkeldurr can also defeat the Steel-types that threaten Aromatisse, making them even better options. Psychic-type Trick Room setters such as Cresselia, Reuniclus, and Hoopa-U are also good partners for this set, as they can set up Trick Room after Aromatisse has fainted and serve as decently strong attackers that beat the Poison-types that Aromatisse fears. In exchange, Aromatisse is able to handle Dark-types and support them with Aroma Veil and Heal Pulse. Fake Out support from the likes of Mega Kangaskhan and Scrafty is helpful, as it can neuter a Pokemon that could otherwise KO Aromatisse, facilitating Aromatisse's task of setting Trick Room. Redirection support from Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Jirachi falls in a similar boat, as it allows Aromatisse to set up Trick Room with greater ease. Amoonguss also takes advantage of Trick Room due to its low Speed and perfectly accurate Spore, which can threaten nearly anything it faces. Lastly, Steel-type Pokemon such as Heatran and Ferrothorn synergize well with Aromatisse, as they can easily absorb the Steel- and Poison-type attacks that trouble it, while it can take the Fighting-type attacks they hate.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>In the Doubles OU metagame, Goodra serves to fulfill the role of the very underwhelming Dragon-type special attacker. A stellar base 150 Special Defense stat backed by base 100 Attack and base 110 Special Attack may make it seem like Goodra is a notable choice, but that is only true on paper. It is held back by a less-than-useful base 80 Speed stat, which, amongst other things, leaves it easily outpaced by all the other notable Dragon-type Pokemon. It also has a poor base 70 Defense that serves to counteract its otherwise good bulk. On the other hand, its ability Sap Sipper allows it to wall Pokemon such as Venusaur and Amoonguss quite easily, and thanks to its superb special bulk, it does work as an acceptable sun and rain check, walling Mega Charizard Y, Ludicolo, and Politoed very easily; however, it does not provide much in the way of any other utility, and unless you need it to fill its very, very tiny niche, it is better left avoided in a competitive context.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragon Pulse is an alternative STAB attack that doesn't lower Goodra's Special Attack. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast for accuracy over power. Sludge Bomb is a viable option to get around Fairies, although most of them can tank a Sludge Bomb and end up crippling Goodra in the process. Feint can be used in order to bypass Protect for Goodra's teammates, but it is a sketchy option when used with a Life Orb.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Fairies such as Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir can play around Goodra; they are immune to its STAB moves and can hit hard with their own.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Dragons such as Latios, Hydreigon, Kyurem-B, and Garchomp can check Goodra, as they are faster and can OHKO it with their STAB moves.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Goodra's hardest-hitting STAB move. Fire Blast hits the Steel-types that resist Goodra's STAB moves super effectively. Thunderbolt 2HKOes Mega Charizard Y; Goodra is capable of taking any hit from it back. It also 2HKOes Azumarill, which is immune to Draco Meteor and resists Fire Blast. Ice Beam can be used over Thunderbolt to nail Pokemon that are 4x weak to Ice-type attacks, primarily Landorus-T, but do note that the combination of Draco Meteor, Fire Blast, and Thunderbolt is not resisted by any Pokemon. The last slot is for Protect, which stalls field effects out and gives Goodra's ally a free turn to attack the foe.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack EVs allow Goodra to hit as hard as possible. 176 Speed EVs let Goodra outspeed Adamant Breloom and Adamant Bisharp, both of which it can nail with Fire Blast. 72 EVs are put into HP to minimize Life Orb recoil. The last 8 EVs are dumped into Defense, as Goodra already has a hefty Special Defense stat. A Modest nature is preferred so Goodra hits harder, but a Timid nature allows Goodra to get the jump on fully invested base 70 Speed Pokemon. Sap Sipper is the best ability, as it provides Goodra with a useful immunity to Grass-type moves, notably Spore. Assault Vest is an option to let Goodra handle weather even better; however, the drop in power is quite noticeable. It does, however, let Goodra take Draco Meteor from Hydreigon and Latios, after which it can KO them with a Draco Meteor of its own.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Goodra has good 90 / 70 / 150 bulk, but it must watch out for powerful physical hits, which can put it out of commission. Its bulk and useful resistances allow it to tank most neutral hits with relative ease, and its ability lets it easily absorb sleep. Goodra also has some utility as an offensive pivot with its good coverage, relatively solid bulk, and reasonable offensive presence.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Goodra is more of a pivot and less of a sweeper, so speed control helps it to outspeed faster threats. Cresselia is a decent partner, as its bulk allows it to survive for most of the match, and it can help Goodra secure OHKOs with Helping Hand. Follow Me or Rage Powder support is useful; in particular, Jirachi makes a great partner, as it resists Fairy-, Dragon-, and Ice-type moves. Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp support is also great for Goodra, as this patches up its weaker Defense stat. Scrafty and Rotom-W can make sure physical attackers have a harder time taking Goodra down, allowing it to continue to do its job. Bisharp and Mega Gengar can KO Fairy-types easily, allowing Goodra to spam Draco Meteor. Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir get a mention, as they are immune to Dragon-type moves that might be aimed at Goodra.</p> "

  "Klefki": {
    "overview": "<p>Klefki's access to Prankster and numerous support moves make it a passable support Pokemon in Doubles. While it has access to great support moves such as Safeguard and Thunder Wave, other Prankster users such as Thundurus, Whimsicott, and Sableye can often do its job better. It does have a few advantages over the other Prankster Pokemon—Klefki's Steel / Fairy typing is stellar, giving it numerous resistances, two immunities, and only two weaknesses. It is also the only one that has access to Metal Sound to further support specially attacking teammates. Unfortunately, once Klefki has set up its support moves, it tends to be a dead weight unless it can target something with its STAB attack of choice. Klefki's base stats are also quite poor, with no base stat being above 95. Finally, while Klefki only has two weaknesses in Ground and Fire, these weaknesses are to two of the most common spread moves in Doubles, Earthquake and Heat Wave.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Although its supportive movepool is far more impressive than its attacking one, Klefki has a few other options at its disposal. Play Rough does good damage to Pokemon with lower Defense stats, such as Latios, and also has a chance to lower the foe's attack. Foul Play takes on strong physical attackers, and it OHKOes Aegislash if it is hit while in Blade forme. Rain Dance and Sunny Day are usable if Klefki is being used on a weather team. A ChestoRest set is an option for recovery, though this takes up a move and an item slot, making it not worth it most of the time. Switcheroo can be used in combination with a Choice item or Lagging Tail to cripple your opponent's Pokemon. Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers, especially Mega Kangaskhan, which tends to use Fake Out against Klefki to prevent it from setting up. Magnet Rise makes Klefki immune to Ground-type moves for a short while, allowing it to partner well with Earthquake users without fear of being knocked out. Lastly, Occa Berry is an option to better take Fire-type attacks from the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Heatran.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Taunt, Substitute, and Encore: While Klefki can act before most utility moves thanks to Prankster, they still give it trouble. Taunt completely shuts down Klefki, as it stops it from using any of its support moves. Thundurus and Whimsicott get a special mention, as they can outspeed Klefki with their own Prankster Taunt. Other Taunt users such as Gyarados, Terrakion, and Keldeo can also limit Klefki to the use of only one support move. Encore from the likes of Politoed and Togekiss also stops Klefki cold, as locking Klefki into something such as Safeguard makes it absolutely useless. Whimsicott can also use Prankster Encore to shut Klefki down before it can use another attack. Substitute users such as Heatran and Kyurem-B can also avoid Thunder Wave and proceed to attack Klefki. However, Klefki's Thunder Wave has priority, so they must set up a Substitute before Klefki uses Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Mega Swampert, and Garchomp can severely damage Klefki with Earthquake. They are also immune to Thunder Wave, limiting the support that Klefki can provide.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran hit Klefki with a powerful STAB attack and easily shrug off Flash Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon</strong>: An immunity to Thunder Wave and a resistance to Flash Cannon make Klefki practically dead weight in matchups against Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Thundurus.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Safeguard is a great move for protecting teammates from status, which is especially helpful for setup Pokemon that want as much power and Speed as possible. Metal Sound further supports partners with special spread attacks like Heat Wave and Hyper Voice by lowering one foe's Special Defense harshly. Flash Cannon helps Klefki avoid being Taunt bait as well as take on the only relevant Magic Bounce user in Mega Diancie. It also potentially takes advantage of Metal Sound drops. Thunder Wave cripples faster attackers and acts as an emergency button due to its priority from Prankster. Alternatively, Protect allows for Klefki to scout for attacks and punish double targeting.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The HP and Defense EVs with a Bold nature ensure that Klefki will survive an Earthquake from Adamant Landorus-T. 16 Special Attack EVs guarantee that Klefki can 2HKO Terrakion with Flash Cannon. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Defense to guarantee that Klefki can take, among other attacks, Heatran's Heat Wave and Life Orb Salamence's Fire Blast. Sitrus Berry is used for added longevity, while Prankster is essential to allow Klefki's support moves to go first.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set focuses on supporting Klefki's teammates in various ways: using Safeguard to protect them from status, using Metal Sound to ensure their attacks knock out more foes, and using Thunder Wave to slow down and potentially immobilize fast threats. When faced with a likely Taunt, Klefki should switch or use Flash Cannon so as to not waste a turn. Klefki's Special Attack stat is quite low, especially with no investment, so most of the time it should be focused on its supportive options. In dire situations, Thunder Wave may be used as a last resort to hope for the 25% chance of full paralysis, but this is far from reliable and should only be a last resort.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Special cleaners such as Mega Gardevoir, Volcarona, and Kingdra appreciate the Special Defense drops from Klefki's Prankster Metal Sound and Safeguard support. Talonflame, Latios, Salamence, and Mega Charizard Y all either resist or are immune to Klefki's two weaknesses, Fire and Ground, making them great partners. They also appreciate Klefki's ability to take on Mega Diancie. Water-types such as Azumarill, Rotom-W, and Keldeo can take Fire-type attacks for Klefki and have a super effective STAB move for both Fire- and Ground-types, making them helpful teammates. Heatran receives a boost from Fire-type attacks, so Klefki appreciates it as a partner. Klefki hates Prankster Taunt from Thundurus, making Kyurem-B, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Quick Guard users such as Terrakion and Scrafty good partners to help deal with Thundurus.</p> "

Gourgeist-XL is also threatened by Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, which can KO or heavily damage it with their STAB attacks. It faces competition from Amoonguss, another bulky support Pokemon that functions well under Trick Room, but Gourgeist-XL's access to Trick Room and other support options lead it to be a better choice in some cases.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Explosion can be used with an offensive EV spread and a Normal Gem to deal heavy damage to foes and allow other Pokemon to take advantage of Trick Room turns, but this wastes Gourgeist-XL's defensive potential. Seed Bomb threatens Water- and Ground-types, but Gourgeist-XL already checks those Pokemon well without it. Disable protects either Gourgeist-XL or its partners from potentially threatening moves. Safeguard protects Gourgeist-XL's side of the field from harmful status such as burns. Rocky Helmet damages contact attackers, but most of what Gourgeist-XL switches into doesn't use such moves. Sunny Day can be used alongside Fire-types such as Mega Camerupt and Heatran to boost the power of their STAB attacks. Skill Swap can be used to take useful abilities from foes, such as Parental Bond from Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Fire-types, such as Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, threaten to OHKO or severely damage Gourgeist-XL with their STAB moves and are able to switch into Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon:Ice-types, specifically Kyurem-B outside of Trick Room and Mega Abomasnow inside of it, generally don't care about the Attack drop after Will-O-Wisp and can hit Gourgeist-XL super effectively.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Dark-types such as Hydreigon, Hoopa-U, and Bisharp also cause trouble for Gourgeist-XL as they threaten to hit hard with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Burns: Gourgeist-XL is crippled by burns because they halve the damage of its Phantom Force, making it much less effective.

Phantom Force is this set's STAB move and acts as a pseudo-Protect while Trick Room is up, giving Gourgeist-XL passive recovery from Leftovers and Leech Seed while also avoiding any moves targeted towards it. Will-O-Wisp gives Gourgeist-XL the means to cripple physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Metagross and wears down the afflicted target. Leech Seed restores HP that may have been lost while setting up Trick Room and synergizes with Phantom Force. However, Protect can also be used to prevent Gourgeist-XL from being KOed or hit with a move such as Taunt while a partner deals with the threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers is Gourgeist-XL's preferred item, providing it with passive recovery in tandem with Leech Seed. Sitrus Berry can also be used to boost Gourgeist-XL's HP to a more secure range after taking a heavy hit. The EV spread allows it to survive an Adamant Life Orb Talonflame's Brave Bird, with the rest invested into Special Defense. The Defense investment can be increased to 168 EVs to survive an Adamant Life Orb Bisharp's Knock Off. Relaxed is used instead of Impish to lower its Speed as much as possible to become \"faster\" under Trick Room. Frisk is used to scout the foes' items for valuable information.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Gourgeist-XL fits well on offensive Trick Room teams that are in need of its ability to set up Trick Room and deal chip damage to the enemy. Gourgeist-XL should use Trick Room as soon as necessary, giving it and its partners the edge against faster foes. It is best used in the mid- to late-game, when threats to it have been removed, as it can also function as a late-game win condition by stalling out foes with Leftovers and Leech Seed. However, if Gourgeist-XL needs to be brought in earlier in the match to set up Trick Room, take note of its Frisk ability; scouting out an item such as a Choice Scarf can be key to planning out the rest of the game. Although Gourgeist-XL switches into Water-types rather well, it can't hit them back super effectively, so having a powerful attacker out to finish them off is recommended.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can take advantage of Trick Room turns generally pair well with Gourgeist-XL. Mega Camerupt and Heatran appreciate Gourgeist-XL's typing advantage over Ground- and Water-types and can take care of opposing Fire-types that threaten Gourgeist-XL. Azumarill matches up well against common Fire- and Dark-types such as Heatran and Hydreigon that scare Gourgeist-XL. Hariyama and Scrafty pressure Dark-types while also providing Fake Out support for Gourgeist-XL; Hariyama has Thick Fat to switch into Fire-types more reliably, while Scrafty threatens Ghost-types with its STAB Dark-type moves. On a semi-Trick Room team, Landorus-T bolsters Gourgeist-XL's already good Defense with Intimidate and takes care of Fire-type Pokemon such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran. Outside of Trick Room, Keldeo assumes a similar role as Azumarill does under it, matching up well against the same types of threats. Mega Kangaskhan beats Bisharp easily and helps Gourgeist-XL set up Trick Room with Fake Out. Hydreigon checks common Ghost-types, sports a resistance to Fire-type moves, and benefits from Gourgeist-XL's immunity to Fighting-type attacks.</p> "

  "Diancie": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Diancie's movepool may be somewhat limited, but when backed by high base Speed and attacking stats, it is able to propel Mega Diancie to the forefront of the Doubles metagame. Mega Diancie achieves solid mixed attacking coverage between two strong STAB attacks, with Earth Power filling in many of the few holes that are left. Using that coverage, Mega Diancie can take out many relevant threats such as Hydreigon, Heatran, Keldeo, and Mega Charizard Y. Perhaps Mega Diancie's greatest asset is found in its exclusive primary STAB move, Diamond Storm, which has everything a Doubles Pokemon could want: high Base Power, high accuracy, and a helpful secondary effect that gives some protection against physical attackers. Mega Diancie also has a superb ability in Magic Bounce, shielding it from moves that would otherwise severely hinder it such as Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Unfortunately, a low HP stat further offset by uninvested defenses and weaknesses to decently common types in Water and Ground leaves Mega Diancie somewhat frail. More specifically, a weakness to the omnipresent Landorus-T's Earthquake makes it difficult for Mega Diancie to perform as well as it could otherwise. Having a low base Speed prior to Mega Evolving also holds it back, forcing it to rely on Protect to Mega Evolve safely. On the other hand, this low base Speed lets Diancie possess a little bit of flexibility in using its base forme to operate as a Trick Room setter with far more bulk than its Mega counterpart. Utilizing both Clear Body and a powerful Diamond Storm lets this set thrive in sweeping unprepared teams. However, Trick Room Diancie is hindered by the same critical typing weaknesses, as well as being countered by common Trick Room checks Amoonguss and Aegislash.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute allows Mega Diancie to ignore Intimidate as well as take any one hit and retaliate, and it also becomes decently difficult to break if Mega Diancie accrues many Defense boosts. Hidden Power Ice allows Mega Diancie to take out one of its greatest foes in Landorus-T, usually on the switch or with Tailwind support. However, those two choices force Mega Diancie to drop either Moonblast or Earth Power, leaving it hard stopped by either Fighting- or Steel-types such as Keldeo, Virizion, and Aegislash. Trick Room Diancie can utilize Weakness Policy to gain boosts after taking a super effective hit, but the only super effective hits that won't OHKO Diancie are Earth Power and Earthquake, and Weakness Policy significantly reduces Diancie's damage output, preventing several 2HKOs.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types that are not OHKOed by Earth Power, such as Aegislash, Jirachi, Ferrothorn, and Bronzong, are solid answers to Diancie, as they can switch in on either STAB move and OHKO it comfortably. Diancie is also weak to Bullet Punch users such as Mega Metagross, as the attack outprioritizes any of Mega Diancie's options and easily OHKOes it, assuming that Mega Diancie doesn't have too many Defense boosts.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Water-types such as Suicune and Rotom-W can easily take any hit from Diancie and KO with with their STAB moves. Kingdra in rain outruns Mega Diancie and OHKO with Hydro Pump, though it has to be wary of switching in on Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Venusaur can take out Diancie with their STAB moves while being able to tank any of Diancie's blows.

Some naturally fast Pokemon, such as Deoxys-A, Mega Aerodactyl, Flash Cannon Thundurus, and Steel Wing Talonflame outspeed Mega Diancie and take it out.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind and Trick Room: Although Mega Diancie is immune to Thunder Wave through Magic Bounce, both Trick Room, from threats such as Cresselia or Jellicent, and Tailwind, from Suicune or Talonflame, take away Mega Diancie's Speed advantage, leaving it almost unsalvageably frail.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Will-O-Wisp is conveniently avoided due to Magic Bounce, but Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Gyarados can weaken Mega Diancie's main attacking move, leaving it considerably less threatening. Regular Diancie, as it is lacking Magic Bounce, has to fear Will-O-Wisp, which not only cuts its Attack but also lowers its longevity to be able to set Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Sleep: Sleep-inducers such as Breloom and Amoonguss prevent the Trick Room set from being effective due to them being able to put Diancie to sleep before it can even move.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard: Wide Guard users such as Conkeldurr and Aegislash prevent Diamond Storm from being succesful, and they are commonly used beside Rock-weak teammates due to the prevalence of Rock Slide.</p> ",

It also importantly because it allows Mega Diancie to safely gain its full base 110 Speed.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Speed and a boosting nature are needed to outrun many significant threats such as Keldeo, Salamence, and Mega Gardevoir, as well as Speed tie with opposing base 110s such as Gengar and Latios. 48 Special Attack EVs are used to guarantee an OHKO on Bisharp with Earth Power, with the remaining EVs placed in Attack to boost the power of Diamond Storm as much as possible. A Hasty nature is typically chosen over a Naive one, as its lowered Defense stat can be remedied by Diamond Storm boosts. This also allows Mega Diancie to survive an Earth Power from Kyurem-B, Heatran, or opposing Mega Diancie. However, Naive is an option to take more advantage of Diamond Storm boosts. A more specially based spread, using 56 Atk / 200 SpA / 252 Spe, is an option to guarantee the 2HKO on Mega Kangaskhan with Moonblast. However, this sacrifices a lot of Diamond Storm's power, which is the move Mega Diancie will be using a majority of its time on the field.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In general, Mega Diancie should use Diamond Storm in order to deal the most damage possible to the opposing team, filling in any gaps in Diamond Storm's coverage with its other attacks. Protect should be used Diancie's first turn out a majority of the time, since it then only hits 218 Speed, leaving it slower than most of the metagame. This turn of Protect allows Diancie to Mega Evolve safely and gain not only its full Speed but also the useful Magic Bounce. Diancie works quite well as a lead, avoiding any Intimidate Attack drops coming from popular leads thanks to Clear Body and using Magic Bounce to deal with many common disruption tactics after it has Mega Evolved. Since Mega Evolution happens after any Pokemon are switched, Diancie is also able to avoid Intimidate from a Pokemon that switches in on the turn it Mega Evolves. With that in mind, Mega Diancie works at any point of the game, either opening up and clearing the path for a teammate to clean or doing so itself in the mid- or late-game. If Mega Diancie absolutely needs to survive a hit and attack back on its first turn on the field, it can postpone Mega Evolution to stay in its base forme, which has significantly higher defenses. This extra bulk is particularly notable when facing Trick Room teams, as it is not so necessary to get the boost in Speed provided by Mega Evolving, and it can mean the difference between surviving to the end of Trick Room's duration and being knocked out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fire-types such as Talonflame, Heatran, and Volcarona beat many of the Grass- and Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Aegislash, and Venusaur that scare out Mega Diancie. Grass-types such as Breloom and Ferrothorn can remove Water-types for Mega Diancie, resist the Ground-type moves it's weak to, and appreciate the removal of Flying-types. Similarly, Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Thundurus do well against Water-types. Grass- and Electric-types also help ease Mega Diancie's otherwise difficult rain matchup. Strong Dark-type teammates are greatly appreciated as checks to Dark-weak Steel-types such as Aegislash, Bronzong, and Mega Metagross; some examples include Hoopa-U, Bisharp, and Hydreigon. Bisharp also has the advantage of discouraging Intimidate users from switching in with its Defiant ability. They also have the benefit of threatening bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Jellicent and Cresselia that can practically ignore Mega Diancie thanks to their solid bulk. Anything that beats Landorus-T is much appreciated as a teammate by Mega Diancie, including Kyurem-B (especially Choice Scarf variants) and Keldeo. Similarly, a teammate such as Kyurem-B or Raikou that can take care of Thundurus is greatly appreciated, as fast sets with Flash Cannon outrun and OHKO Mega Diancie. Dragon-types, including Hydreigon and Salamence, benefit from Mega Diancie's ability to beat opposing Dragon-types without fearing their moves in return, and they also act as a solid switch-ins to Water- and Grass-type attacks. They also typically perform well against rain teams, which are one of Mega Diancie's weakest matchups. Steel-types have decent synergy with Mega Diancie, mostly appreciating the removal of Fire-types that Mega Diancie is so good at. Aegislash in particular is a great partner, as it can carry Wide Guard to protect Mega Diancie from Muddy Water or Earthquake and takes care of Bronzong or Mega Metagross. Jirachi also stands out as notable, helping Mega Diancie with redirection support and Icy Wind to help it take on especially fast foes.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Trick Room",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Diamond Storm is Diancie's main STAB move, dealing powerful spread damage while having a chance to boost Diancie's Defense. This Rock-type coverage, when combined with Fairy-type coverage in the form of Moonblast, which covers Fighting-types, leaves Diancie only walled by opposing Steel-types. Trick Room is a potent speed control move that gives Diancie's team the upper hand speed-wise for four more turns, allowing Diancie and its teammates room to sweep. Protect is useful for avoiding opposing damage and maneuvering for a better position with Diancie's partner.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Stone Plate and 252 EVs in Attack bring Trick Room Diancie's Diamond Storm damage on par with Mega Diancie's, notably allowing it to 2HKO most neutral targets. Maximum HP EVs are used to compensate for Diancie's low base HP stat and to give it a respectable amount of bulk. While Stone Plate is preferred to avoid recoil damage, Life Orb can be used to give Diancie more damage output, notably having a better roll to KO defensive Thundurus while also boosting Moonblast enough to KO Keldeo with 108 Special Attack EVs—without Life Orb, however, there aren't any notable Special Attack benchmarks, and hence the standard spread has no Special Attack investment. If using Life Orb, a spread of 152 HP / 248 Atk / 108 SpA should be used, as this minimizes Life Orb recoil and hits the aforementioned Special Attack benchmark.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The only foes that resist Diancie's dual coverage are Steel-types, so get rid of these immediately. More often than not, eliminating Aegislash or Jirachi early on grants Diancie a paved road to finish the game, so Diancie often works best mid- or late-game when these threats are eliminated.</p> <p>Defensively, Diancie brings many things to the table that no other setter can due to its unique Rock / Fairy typing. Take advantage of these unique good matchups—against Talonflame, Kangaskhan, Thundurus, and Hydreigon—for an opportunity to set up Trick Room, usually with Fake Out or redirection support. On the other hand, Diancie should do its best to avoid its difficult matchups, such as against opposing Steel-types, rain sweepers and bulky Water-types, and Amoonguss.</p> <p>Defensive boosts are also extremely useful: these can be used to easily tank and prevent a late-game Earthquake sweep after Trick Room goes down. Diancie's decent bulk also allows it to tank opposing Earth Power from Heatran, Kyurem-B, or Mega Diancie, as well as Solar Beam from Mega Charizard Y.</p> <p>Diancie possesses the option to simply use Diamond Storm if you foresee a foe using using Taunt (typically Thundurus, which is weak to Diamond Storm), potentially picking up KOs or dealing large amounts of damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Diancie's team members should generally be geared towards dealing with its difficult matchups. Especially notable are attackers that can deal with Steel-types such as Volcanion, Scrafty, Heatran, Mega Camerupt, and Hoopa-U and Ground-immune Pokemon such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, Latios, and Hydreigon. In addition, checks to opposing Water-types such as Dragon-types, Grass-types (Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur), and Mega Charizard Y, as well as Fairy checks in the form of Aegislash, Heatran, and Bronzong, are needed. Fake Out and redirection are two forms of support Diancie greatly appreciates for setting Trick Room; Scrafty and Mega Kangaskhan provide Fake Out, whereas Amoonguss supplies Diancie with redirection. Scrafty and Amoonguss are both very good for compensating for Diancie's weaknesses to Steel-types and Water-types, respectively.</p> "

  "Hoopa-Unbound": {
    "overview": "<p>Hoopa-U is widely known for its monstrous power as well as its two signature moves that break one of the most common moves in Doubles, Protect. With base 160 Attack and base 170 Special Attack, Hoopa can viably run a mixed attacking set sporting both Hyperspace Fury and Hyperspace Hole to OHKO common threats like Aegislash and Amoonguss while also nearly OHKOing most of the metagame that doesn't resist these STAB-boosted moves. In addition to breaking Protect and variants like Spiky Shield, King's Shield, and Wide Guard like Feint does, Hyperspace Hole and Hyperspace Fury also hit Pokemon that are behind a Substitute.</p> <p>Hoopa-U's Speed tier is not generally the best to take full advantage of its offensive power, so it's most commonly paired with multiple speed control options on the same team, ranging from Trick Room to Tailwind. Additionally, Hoopa-U's ability to break Protect pressures the opponent, as they can't simply use Protect to stall out turns of Tailwind or Trick Room reliably. Its Psychic / Dark typing also does not really grant it much defensively beyond an immunity to Psychic-type attacks. Due to its low Defense, physical attackers that can outspeed it such as Mega Kangaskhan and Landorus-T are the biggest threats to Hoopa-U. On the other hand, though, Hoopa-U has a high base 130 Special Defense that can be used to take a lot of special hits nicely. Dark-types like Hydreigon, Bisharp, and Scrafty are also an issue, as they resist Hoopa's dual STAB Hyperspace moves, and Fairy-type Pokemon also threaten to KO it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The elemental punches, primarily Fire and Ice Punch, are additional coverage options. Fire Punch helps Hoopa-U beat Ferrothorn while also hitting Bisharp for super effective damage, whereas Ice Punch is mainly for Landorus-T. For similar reasons to the elemental punches, Hoopa-U can make use of Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Ice, using its Special Attack stat over its Attack to beat the same threats. Ally Switch is a support option that allows Hoopa-U to catch your opponent off guard by swapping places with its ally on a pivotal turn, but Hoopa-U generally gets more mileage out of attacking the foes for heavy damage rather than supporting.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: If Hoopa-U is lacking Drain Punch, Dark-types such as Bisharp, Scrafty, Hydreigon, and Darkrai threaten it because they resist and are immune to Hyperspace Fury and Hyperspace Hole, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon:Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Diancie, and Azumarill are also big threats to Hoopa-U when they outspeed it or it does not have Gunk Shot on its set to cover them. Notably, Mega Gardevoir should easily be knocked out from full by Hyperspace Fury, so there is no need to risk a Gunk Shot miss when attacking it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Hoopa-U really struggles against attackers that hit it with physical moves because it has only base 60 Defense. These include threats that are able to tank a hit and hit it hard such as Scrafty, Azumarill, Gyarados, and Ferrothorn as well as Pokemon that outspeed Hoopa such as Mega Kangaskhan, Talonflame, Landorus-T, and even Keldeo thanks to its signature move Secret Sword targeting the foe's Defense.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Faster Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Keldeo, and Mega Gardevoir can all outrun and OHKO Hoopa-U if they are already present on the field. None can really switch into Hoopa-U too comfortably, however.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room</strong>: Hoopa-U is dependent on its own team's speed control, so if the opponent either uses their own form of speed control or prevents Hoopa-U's team from getting up theirs, Hoopa-U may struggle to be an effective threat.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: Intimidate and burns make Hoopa-U much easier to play around by almost forcing it to use only Hyperspace Hole, letting the opponent find more reliable ways to switch into it. Pokemon such as Darkrai have the typing advantage mentioned previously as well as the ability to outspeed and burn Hoopa-U before it gets off an attack.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyperspace Fury is Hoopa-U's strongest physical attack and often its go-to move to hammer away at the opponent, and, like Feint, it also breaks Protect. Hyperspace Hole is Hoopa-U's main special attack to help it beat Amoonguss as well as still deal heavy damage when it is either burned or Intimidated. Gunk Shot is a coverage move to handle Fairies such as Azumarill and Sylveon, which would otherwise threaten Hoopa-U. Substitute is a little more difficult to set up for Hoopa-U compared to other common users due to its lack of a good defensive typing, but it can often set it up on passive threats like Amoonguss or when it scares out a foe thanks to its offensive pressure. A Hoopa-U behind a Substitute is able to take physical hits it would otherwise not be able to take and respond with heavy damage. Drain Punch gives Hoopa-U a coverage move to hit Dark-type Pokemon that resist its STAB moves. Protect is self explanatory as a staple move in Doubles to help stall out field conditions or get Hoopa-U in a position where its partner can help it threaten the opposing team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb boosts Hoopa-U's mixed offensive stats to high levels to pick up key KOs and deal heavy damage. The Hasty nature was chosen to both increase Hoopa-U's Speed and preserve its outstanding Special Defense stat, as it wouldn't be taking most physical hits anyway. The Special Attack investment lets Hoopa-U always OHKO standard Relaxed Amoonguss with Hyperspace Hole. The Speed investment lets it outrun maximum Speed positive-natured base 70 Pokemon such as Breloom. The rest is dumped into Attack to hit as hard as possible with Hyperspace Fury, which easily OHKOes threats like Aegislash. An alternate spread with 116 Atk / 140 SpA / 252 Spe and a Hasty nature can be used to outrun as many Pokemon as possible while still netting an OHKO on both standard Relaxed Amoonguss and standard Aegislash. A Trick Room team may attempt to use an alternate spread of 232 HP / 136 Atk / 140 SpA with a Quiet nature to outspeed as many threats as possible in Trick Room. Zen Headbutt is also a viable option on Hoopa if one wants to forgo the special mechanics of Hyperspace Hole and opt for a full physical set.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hoopa-U should avoid Will-O-Wisp, as it lowers the damage output of Hyperspace Fury, preventing it from picking up OHKOs on some Pokemon and denting others for heavy damage. If Hoopa-U is faster than its partner, you can use a Hyperspace move to break opposing Protect so that the partner can attack through it. The same applies for breaking Wide Guard from Pokemon such as Aegislash, allowing a slower Mega Gardevoir to get off its Hyper Voice. Try not to switch in Hoopa-U too often except on a U-turn or safe switch after a team member faints, because its low Defense and lack of decent resistances make it take heavy damage otherwise. Leading with a Fake Out user alongside Hoopa-U puts on a lot of pressure because people generally try to burn out Fake Out with Protect, but thanks to Hoopa-U's ability to break Protect with its Hyperspace moves, this is no longer very safe. Due to Hoopa-U's awkward mid-tier base 80 Speed, it's best to get speed control into play such as that of Trick Room, Tailwind, Thunder Wave, and Icy Wind. Obviously, Hoopa-U is great for pressuring Pokemon slower than it due to its monstrous offensive stats. Hoopa-U is also very great against Trick Room, as it can hit most Trick Room setters for super effective damage with Hyperspace Fury, either KOing them or weakening them to the point where they will be unable to set up Trick Room again. If you are using the Substitute set on Hoopa-U, do not have it set up a Substitute when it is not anywhere close to full health, because it may end up fainting to Life Orb recoil behind the Substitute before it can get enough hits off.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tailwind setters are great partners for Hoopa-U because they provide it with necessary speed control. Latios gets a special mention for its offensive synergy with Hoopa-U, appreciating its ability to OHKO Aegislash. Trick Room setters such as Reuniclus, Cresselia, and Porygon2 give speed control for Hoopa to go to town under Trick Room. Redirection support Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Jirachi are good to take physical hits for Hoopa-U, allowing it to safely fire off attacks. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan and Infernape can help Hoopa-U attack the foes safely, and, as a bonus, they also have a decent matchup versus Dark-types. Mega Kangaskhan also greatly appreciates Hoopa-U, as Hoopa-U helps it by getting rid of pesky Ghost-types like Aegislash and other Mega Kangaskhan checks like Amoonguss, allowing Mega Kangaskhan to plow through teams. Mega Kangaskhan also beats most Fairies, which would otherwise threaten Hoopa-U. Keldeo is a great partner, as it helps get rid of Dark- and Steel-types, as well as big threats like Mega Kangaskhan and Landorus-T that would OHKO Hoopa-U. Aegislash and Amoonguss are good defensive partners for Hoopa-U, as they take Fairy-type attacks and are good switch-ins to threats like Mega Kangaskhan and Keldeo, which would otherwise OHKO Hoopa. Aegislash also offers Wide Guard support to block out spread Fairy-type moves such as Pixilate Hyper Voice. Mega Gardevoir in particular really appreciates Hoopa-U beating Aegislash for it so it can freely spam Hyper Voice, while Gardevoir handles pesky Dark-types for Hoopa-U. Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame are also great partners because they beat threats to Hoopa-U in Dark-types like Bisharp and Scrafty as well as Fairy-types in Sylveon.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyperspace Fury and Hyperspace Hole are STAB attacks that can break through Protect and Wide Guard, the former being more powerful and having the better offensive typing and the latter being more spammable because it does not reduce Hoopa-U's Defense upon use and is unaffected by the Attack drop from Intimidate and burns. Trick Room supports the team by providing speed control, allowing Hoopa-U and other slow teammates to move first most of the time. Protect lets Hoopa-U stall out field conditions and allows partners to KO threats without it having to switch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread maximizes the damage from Hoopa-U's Hyperspace Fury while also providing enough bulk to survive a Secret Sword from Keldeo or a Moonblast from Mega Diancie. Safety Goggles allows to set up Trick Room on Amoonguss and other sleep spreaders, while Focus Sash allows Hoopa-U to take at least one hit and set up Trick Room. Life Orb lets Hoopa-U hit harder and notably OHKO Aegislash and Amoonguss, though it sacrifices Hoopa-U's longevity. Alternatively, a spread of 252 Atk / 252 SpA / 4 SpD can be used with a Focus Sash because the defensive benchmarks aren't as relevant when Hoopa-U is guaranteed to survive one hit.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because Hoopa-U is frail, it functions best as a mid- or late-game Trick Room setter, as many of its checks will often be KOed or out of position. Due to Hoopa-U's low Defense, it should avoid taking physical attacks. Spamming Hyperspace Hole and Hyperspace Fury is great to stop the opponent from using Protect to stall out Trick Room turns, also breaking Protect and Wide Guard for Hoopa-U's partner to deal damage. Fake Out support can make setting Trick Room easier. Because some Pokemon are naturally slower than Hoopa-U, setting Trick Room sometimes isn't the priority and when facing Pokemon such as Ferrothorn or Amoonguss, it's best to just attack. Also, don't set Trick Room if you feel that a Taunt user will use Taunt on Hoopa-U; instead, use Protect or attack the Taunt user.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fake Out users such as Kangaskhan and Scrafty make for good partners, as they help Hoopa-U set Trick Room more easily. An Intimidate user such as Gyarados or Landorus-T can help to alleviate Hoopa-U's poor Defense. Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr and Fairy-types like Sylveon help deal with Dark-types, which Hoopa-U struggles to damage. Amoonguss also helps redirect attacks, which makes setting Trick Room easier and is also great under Trick Room, as it easily spreads sleep to the opposing team thanks to its low Speed. Spread attackers such as Heatran are great because Hyperspace Fury and Hyperspace Hole also break Wide Guard, so fewer Trick Room turns are wasted if the opponent clicks Wide Guard. Make sure these spread attackers are IVed to be slower than Hoopa-U so that Wide Guard is broken when they attack in Trick Room. Other Trick Room setters can be good to further support a team that may require more Trick Room support, preferably a setter that isn't as weak to Kangaskhan such as Bronzong or Jellicent.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Volcanion's excellent offensive coverage, backed by a base 130 Special Attack, makes it one of XY DOU's most prominent special attackers. Furthermore, its solid natural bulk coupled with Assault Vest makes it a defensive behemoth that is near impossible to take out in one hit. As a result of these excellent offensive and defensive capabilities, it's extremely difficult to trade KOs with it one for one. Steam Eruption and Heat Wave form Volcanion's core offensive suite, hitting virtually every prominent Pokemonthat isn't Water- or Dragon-type for neutral damage. Notably, Volcanion burns foes often because of the aforementioned moves' chances to inflict burns. Earth Power hits other Volcanion and other Water-types that resist its STAB attacks. Hidden Power Grass hits Gastrodon and the rare Jellicent, but it primarily flips the matchup against the former on its head. Overheat is notable for being a high-damage option, KOing Amoonguss after minimal chip damage, though the Special Attack drop greatly reduces Volcanion's offensive pressure. While more niche, Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Mega Salamence and Hydreigon, and Sludge Bomb can hit Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon. Assault Vest Volcanion can be brought in really easily, as it often finds fields where neither opposing Pokemon threatens it too much. Removing its scariest checks, like Mega Kangaskhan and Conkeldurr, before it enters battle will make it much more menacing, however. Landorus-T is an excellent partner for Volcanion, primarily because of how well it matches up against opposing Landorus-T, weakning its Earthquake so Volcanion can use Steam Eruption much more safely. Thundurus's ability to spam Thunder Wave makes Volcanion's middling Speed much less of an issue. Volcanion will go down to two Seismic Tosses from Mega Kangaskhan; pairing it with a Rocky Helmet user like Amoonguss or Cresselia will go a long way in wearing Mega Kangaskhan down for it.</p> "

Volcanion runs maximum Special Attack to pressure Amoonguss as much as possible with strong Heat Waves. An odd HP stat allows it to survive switching into Stealth Rock four times. Switching Volcanion into Amoonguss's Spore when the other foe can't threaten it is one of the strongest plays available with this set. Landorus-T and Thundurus greatly support Volcanion with their respective abilities and immunity to Ground. Specially bulky Pokemon like Sylveon, Porygon2, and Conkeldurr can switch into Thunderbolts aimed at Volcanion.
