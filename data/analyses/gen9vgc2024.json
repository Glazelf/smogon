With Toxic Debris and signature move Mortal Spin, Glimmora can punish physical attackers and passive play, and, when combined with the threat of Meteor Beam, make it impossible to ignore while also requiring careful positioning to properly handle.</p> </li> <li> <p>Glimmora has traditionally fit best on Dondozo teams, as the combination of Toxic Debris and Mortal Spin means your foes almost guaranteed to be afflicted with poison, putting your opponent on a timer. Assault Vest on Glimmora is especially effective on Dondozo teams, as the extra longevity helps it spread poison better and stall out even longer, making up for the lowered damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>With Meteor Beam, Glimmora can utilize its high Special Attack stat and good offensive typing as a damage dealer. Tornadus and Ogerpon-W are good partners; Tornadus provides speed control and can launch powerful Bleakwind Storms into Fighting-types that resist Meteor Beam and Ogerpon-W redirects potential Water- or Ground-type attacks while pressuring threats like Urshifu-R and Landorus. In return, Glimmora can threaten Grass-types, which resists both Ogerpon-W's STAB moves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Glimmora's poor defensive typing, combined with its middling bulk and average Speed, makes Glimmora a glass cannon. Glimmora is weak to many prominent offensive threats such as Urshifu-R, Landorus, and Gholdengo. Glimmora also struggles to handle Rock-resistant foes such as Iron Hands, Kingambit, and Urshifu-R. Even then, many of these foes will concede Toxic Spikes while taking out Glimmora; for instance, Urshifu-R will set up both layers of Toxic Spikes if it attacks Glimmora. Amoonguss is another difficult match up, as it absords Toxic Spikes and takes Glimmora's attacks comfortably, while threatening a Spore.</p> </li> </ul>",

Examples include Chien-Pao and Dragonite, as well as Tornadus and a sweeper such as Urshifu-S or Flutter Mane. The two cores utilize strong speed control and get off massive damage early, allowing Dondozo to clean up. Glimmora is another excellent partner, as its ability and signature move put foes on a timer, forcing them to burn through Dondozo before fainting to Toxic poison.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dondozo struggles against Pokemon that can ignore its stat boosts, either by neutralizing or bypassing it entirely. Both Urshifu formes and Chien-Pao with Sacred Sword ignore Dondozo's Defense boost, with Chien-Pao both outspeeding and threatening Dondozo if it uses Tera Grass, and Urshifu-S dealing big damage with Wicked Blow and removing Dondozo's ability to stall with Protect. Incineroar and Gouging Fire are able to consistently weaken Dondozo with Breaking Swipe and Intimidate cycling respectively. A combination of Incineroar and Amoonguss is particularly difficult to handle, as Amoonguss can keep Incineroar safe with redirection and Incineroar is free to cycle Parting Shot and Intimidate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dondozo requires much more experience to properly play compared to other sweepers, due to only making plays with one Pokemon for most of the game.

Additionally, Armor Tail gives Farigiraf a great matchup against Pokemon that rely on priority like Rillaboom and Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p>The different Ogerpon formes are all great partners for Farigiraf, because the redirection means Trick Room is almost guaranteed to go up, while their Grass typing means that Spore is no longer an issue. Ogerpon-W has a great defensive typing and can easily tank most hits it redirects away from Farigiraf, Ogerpon-H hits Amoonguss and the Steel-types that resist Farigiraf's moves, and Ogerpon-C is particularly helpful for redirection due to its Sturdy ability. Rillaboom and Incineroar are also great partners, as Fake Out + Trick Room is a great combination due to the fact that Fake Out prevents both opponents from attacking Farigiraf before Trick Room goes up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Partners that are physically frail or weak to one of the big priority moves like Urshifu-R really enjoy having it as an ally.

Flutter Mane is able to deal huge damage to Raging Bolt even when it Terastallizes, and can very comfortably take unboosted Thunderclaps.</p> </li> </ul>",

      "3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Thunderbolt is there for good consistent damage, especially with Tera Electric with Magnet, while Thunderclap helps make up for Raging Bolt's middling Speed. Draco Meteor is a more powerful option, being able to OHKO Pokémon like Landorus when used with Booster Energy. However, it can be forced to switch out and lose the boost when using Booster Energy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Magnet is the most consistent item option, especially when paired with Tera Electric, drastically increasing Raging Bolt's damage. Booster Energy is another option, as it not only boosts its Electric-type moves, but it also boosts Draco Meteor. Safety Goggles prevents Amoonguss from redirecting Thunderclaps away from Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Speed investment allows Raging Bolt to outspeed Dragapult, Flutter Mane, and Chien-Pao while under Tailwind, allowing it to hit them with its stronger options like Thunderbolt and Draco Meteor. The HP is optimized for Life Orb chip if used.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Electric will often be the strongest and most consistent option. Tera Grass is a good option to not only resist Ground-type moves from Landorus, but also if you want to ignore Amoonguss' Spore and redirection with Rage Powder without running Safety Goggles. Finally, Tera Fairy is just a strong neutral Tera type to pair with such amazing bulk.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Thunderclap is a good main STAB move, as it allows Raging Bolt to focus less on Speed and go all out on bulk investment, as it will be able to boost up then hit most foes before they can retaliate.</p> </li> <li> <p>While Dragon Pulse is usually an underwhelming move, it serves as a strong neutral STAB move into Pokemon that resist Electric-type attacks when paired with Calm Mind.</p> </li> <li> <p>In some situations, Thunderbolt can be used over Protect, due to Raging Bolt being bulky enough to where Protect isn't mandatory on Calm Mind sets, and for consistency against support Pokémon such as Follow Me Ogerpon-W where Thunderclap would fail.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leftovers is preferred over Booster Energy on the Calm Mind set, providing immense longevity with Grassy Terrain from Rillaboom. However, Booster Energy can be used if you need that extra damage, as the Special Attack boost changes many calculations, for example, being able to OHKO bulky Flutter Mane at +1 with Helping Hand and Protosynthesis where you'd be unable to without Booster Energy.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Defense EVs with the HP EVs allow Raging Bolt to live Icicle Crash from Adamant Chien-Pao. The HP EVs make the HP optimized for Leftovers and Grassy Terrain recovery. The bulk investment ensures that Raging Bolt is able to tank 2 unboosted Moonblasts from Timid Flutter Mane at +1 Special Defense after Leftovers and Grassy Terrain recovery combined with Protect. The Special Defense EVs hit an even number to be optimal for the Calm Mind boost.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Grass lets Raging Bolt resist Ground-type moves and provides an immunity to Spore and Rage Powder, so Thunderclap can't be redirected away from Urshifu-R.</p> </li> </ul>"

  "Iron Crown": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li> <p>Iron Crown is an excellent choice for offensive teams looking to take advantage of the powerful move Expanding Force thanks to its well-rounded stats and access to Booster Energy. It performs best against frailer offensive teams consisting of Pokemon that do not resist Expanding Force, such as Tornadus, Landorus, and Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p>Although it can be used as a sweeper early-game to soften opposing teams, it is usually better to save Iron Crown for the late-game when its checks have been sufficiently weakened for it to sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p>Indeedee-F is by far Iron Crown's best teammate, offering role compression as a Psychic Terrain setter and redirector. Access to Helping Hand also further amplifies its partner's ridiculous damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Iron Crown's best counters are Dark- and Steel-types, namely Incineroar, Kingambit, Archaludon, and Gholdengo, all of which resist both of Iron Crown's STAB moves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Therefore, Iron Crown appreciates Pokemon that can help remove these threats consistently, such as Landorus, Entei, and Urshifu-R. In return, Iron Crown can pressure opposing Urshifu-R and Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rillaboom is another noteworthy check, as it is able to safely pivot in and override Psychic Terrain, weakening Expanding Force significantly. Other Pokemon with access to Ice Spinner like Chien-Pao and Dragonite can also be used to remove Psychic Terrain.</p> </li> <li> <p>Faster Pokemon like Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane serve as good checks as well, but they have to watch out for Follow Me from Indeedee-F as they are vulnerable to Tachyon Cutter.</p> </li> </ul>",

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Expanding Force is Iron Crown's go-to STAB move, allowing it to devastate foes under Psychic Terrain.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tachyon Cutter helps secure the OHKO on Pokemon like Chien-Pao and Whimsicott, which commonly hold Focus Sash.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Water is a naturally good defensive typing that, when coupled with Tera Blast, gives Iron Crown an out against the aforementioned Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon, which otherwise counter it. Focus Blast can be used over Tera Blast to secure the OHKO on Kingambit, but is rather inconsistent and is unable to hit Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p>An alternative spread of 76 HP / 4 Def / 172 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe allows Iron Crown to outspeed Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao thanks to Speed Booster Energy.</p> </li> <li> <p>This set can also be run with a Modest nature to maximize Iron Crown's damage output, at the risk of underspeeding opposing Pokemon in the same Speed tier such as Modest Landorus and both Urshifu formes.</p> </li> </ul>"
