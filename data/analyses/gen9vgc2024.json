Incineroar and Amoonguss can slow down the pace of the game, Latias provides crucial speed control in Tailwind, and Rillaboom's Grassy Surge and Fake Out is appreciated by Registeel.

Kingambit also does poorly against Registeel, as Swords Dance can be mitigated by Iron Defense and Body Press hits Kingambit very hard if it does not Terastallize.</p> <p>*However, not all physical attackers are helpless against the IronPress Registeel. Both Urshifu formes can pose a threat, depending on Registeel's choice of Tera type. Chien-Pao can threaten heavy damage with Sacred Sword if Registeel has not used Terastallization.

Because of this, some of its best partners include Urshifu-R, Landorus and Flutter Mane, which are all powerful attackers that pair well with Ogerpon-H and enjoy Follow Me support.

Additionally, Mystic Water variants of Urshifu-R get outsped and OHKOed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bad matchups for Ogerpon-H include Pokemon such as Entei and Raging Bolt that can wall its STAB combation.

Rillaboom provides Fake Out support, as well as passive healing through Grassy Terrain and priority with Grassy Glide that discourages the opponent from leading with Urshifu-R. Dual screens from Grimmsnarl and damage reduction from Incineroar's Intimidate or Snarl are also useful for keeping Archaludon alive to stack Stamina or Electro Shot stat increases.</p> </li> <li> <p>Archaludon fits well on rain teams thanks to its Grass and Electric resistances.

Archaludon also functions well on Trick Room teams due to many of its checks being faster than it, such as both Urshifu formes, Landorus, and Chien-Pao running Sacred Sword.
