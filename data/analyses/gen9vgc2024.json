    "overview": "<ul> <li> <p>Glimmora is a strong offensive threat with access to a good STAB combination and the powerful move Meteor Beam, which, when used with the Power Herb, can melt many targets, such as Assault Vest Entei and Incineroar. With Toxic Debris and signature move Mortal Spin, Glimmora can punish physical attackers and passive play, and, when combined with the threat of Meteor Beam, make it impossible to ignore while also requiring careful positioning to properly handle.</p> </li> <li> <p>Glimmora has traditionally fit best on Dondozo teams, as the combination of Toxic Debris and Mortal Spin means your foes almost guaranteed to be afflicted with poison, putting your opponent on a timer. Assault Vest on Glimmora is especially effective on Dondozo teams, as the extra longevity helps it spread poison better and stall out even longer, making up for the lowered damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>With Meteor Beam, Glimmora can utilize its high Special Attack stat and good offensive typing as a damage dealer. Tornadus and Ogerpon-W are good partners; Tornadus provides speed control and can launch powerful Bleakwind Storms into Fighting-types that resist Meteor Beam and Ogerpon-W redirects potential Water- or Ground-type attacks while pressuring threats like Urshifu-R and Landorus. In return, Glimmora can threaten Grass-types, which resists both Ogerpon-W's STAB moves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Glimmora's poor defensive typing, combined with its middling bulk and average Speed, makes Glimmora a glass cannon. Glimmora is weak to many prominent offensive threats such as Urshifu-R, Landorus, and Gholdengo. Glimmora also struggles to handle Rock-resistant foes such as Iron Hands, Kingambit, and Urshifu-R. Even then, many of these foes will concede Toxic Spikes while taking out Glimmora; for instance, Urshifu-R will set up both layers of Toxic Spikes if it attacks Glimmora. Amoonguss is another difficult match up, as it absords Toxic Spikes and takes Glimmora's attacks comfortably, while threatening a Spore.</p> </li> </ul>",
