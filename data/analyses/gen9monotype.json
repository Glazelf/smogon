Spore gives Breloom setup opportunities and impedes otherwise major threats to the team such as Flying-types like Corviknight and Pelipper and Poison-types such as Toxapex, Iron Moth, and Clodsire. Focus Sash guarantees it can use Spore at least once—provided Breloom can keep itself at full HP—and also gives Breloom the opportunity to use Swords Dance as well. Bullet Seed is a fantastic STAB move that threatens Water-types like Dondozo and Quagsire. Mach Punch provides Breloom with a super strong STAB move with priority to not only circumvent its below average Speed but also threatens faster Pokemon such as Meowscarada, Iron Treads, and Cyclizar. Swords Dance allows Breloom to not only power up its STAB moves but takes advantage of the setup opportunities that Spore can provide. Bulldoze, however, can apply pressure to Poison-types such as Skuntank and Toxapex while also putting the foe at a potential Speed disadvantage.</p> <p>Setup sweepers such as Paldean Tauros-F and Lucario appreciate Breloom's ability to potentially impede their checks such as Toxapex, Dondozo, and Quagsire, giving them ample setup opportunities. Paldean Tauros-F handles the Dark matchup fairly easily thanks to it avoiding being burned by Sableye while also resisting Meowscarada's and Chien-Pao's STAB moves. Lucario can threaten Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant with its STAB Bullet Punch. Assault Vest Iron Hands is another great partner that can handle the special attacking Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane and Hatterene while also handling Flying-types such as Dragonite and Iron Jugulis which could otherwise threaten Breloom out. Entry hazard control from Great Tusk is imperative to allow Breloom to keep its Focus Sash intact. Great Tusk also helps Breloom by providing Stealth Rock, which racks up chip damage with the switches Breloom can force. Gallade is a great partner that can threaten Poison-types such as Amoonguss and Toxapex. Iron Valiant is another fantastic partner for Breloom, providing Future Sight support to ward off the Poison-types that like to switch into both of Breloom's STAB moves. Its Fairy STAB moves also ease the Dark and Dragon matchups as well as being quite useful in the Fighting mirror.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Torkoal is an essential member of Fire teams, providing valuable role compression by setting up sun and Stealth Rock, removing entry hazards, and tanking physical attacks. STAB Lava Plume provides decent damage and a high chance to burn, which proves particularly useful against physical attackers like Mimikyu and Iron Hands. Body Press allows Torkoal uses Torkoal's high Defense to heavily damage the likes of Kingambit, Blissey, and Tyranitar, as well as preventing Roaring Moon and Hydreigon from setting up freely. Alternatively, Yawn can be used to force a switch, allowing Torkoal to freely bring a teammate that can benefit from the sun. Heat Rock provides more turns of sun for allies to benefit from, but Heavy-Duty Boots greatly increases Torkoal's longevity. If using the latter, getting fewer turns of sun also allows Fire teams to better manage opposing Protosynthesis sweepers, such as Flutter Mane or Sandy Shocks.</p> <p>Thanks to Chlorophyll and its unique typing, Scovillain pairs well with Torkoal, as the sun allows it to outspeed and KO foes such as Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Quaquaval. Choice Specs Scovillian can significantly damage to Toxapex with Solar Beam and even 2HKO Clodsire in the sun with Flamethrower. Cinderace is another wallbreaker that thrives under the sun and appreciates Stealth Rock chipping at the opposing team. It can run Court Change, allowing for more entry hazard control if you're running Heat Rock Torkoal, or use a Choice Scarf to defeat foes like Flutter Mane and Choice Specs Greninja. Iron Moth can use sun and Fire Blast to OHKO foes such as Iron Jugulis and Sableye. Ceruledge scares out Flutter Mane, which can otherwise become problematic due to Power Gem and Protosynthesis boosting its Speed in sun. Thanks to its great defensive stats and Unaware, Skeledirge is an amazing partner for Torkoal, handling setup sweepers such as Curse Dondozo and Belly Drum Azumarill for it. Also, sun weakens Water-type moves for Skeledirge and boosts its Torch Song. Rotom-H can tank special hits Torkoal can't withstand from the likes of Iron Valiant, as well as providing a valuable Ground immunity, which allows it to come in on foes such as Clodsire, Sandy Shocks, and Ting-Lu. Volcarona can dismantle Dark-type teams and occasionally weaken physical attackers thanks to Flame Body.</p> "

        "description": "<p>A potent offensive presence, Volcarona's access to Quiver Dance provides the backbone to its sweeping capabilities. Bug Buzz is Volcarona's main attacking option and can be combined with Swarm to increase damage as Volcarona loses HP while setting up, allowing Volcarona to OHKO checks like offensive Garchomp after one Quiver Dance. Psychic is essential, as it allows Volcarona to hit one of Fire's strongest checks, Toxapex, but also super effectively damages Poison-types and Fighting-types such as Glimmora and Quaquaval. The last slot is interchangeable, though generally Flamethrower is preferred as a STAB move that can also take advantage of sun support on Fire teams and is essential to for the Flying matchup, allowing it to hit Corviknight and Kilowattrel. Giga Drain can be used to give Volcarona a better chance of breaking through Water and Ground teams and give it a recovery option. Similarly, Morning Sun gives Volcarona more setup opportunities. Flame Body can also be used to threaten burns on Pokemon such as Kingambit and Dragonite, which oftentimes revenge kill Volcarona. Given its all-around solid defensive stats, Volcarona finds a myriad of opportunities to set up and takes advantage of the maximum Speed spread given to capitalize on the boosts as much as possible, outspeeding Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Great Tusk or Choice Scarf Dragapult after one or two Quiver Dances boosts, respectively</p> <p>Generally, Volcarona is best saved for mid- to late-game, when the opposing team has been chipped down and Volcarona has an opportunity to sweep after setting up. Utilizing its offensive teammates such as Scovillian, Cereludge, Cinderace, and Paldean Tauros-F to slowly chip down defensive walls such as Dodonzo, Ting-Lu, and Blissey provides better opportunity for Volcarona to sweep later in the game. Paldean Tauros-F is specifically useful with its ability to remove dual screens, preventing Volcarona's setup from being hindered. Rotom-H also provides excellent support, aiding in the Water matchup if Giga Drain is not used and providing pivot support to switch Volcarona in. Skeledirge and Talonflame provide defensive support to wear down offensive threats such as Dragonite. Torkoal providing sun support on Fire aids Volcarona, not only increasing Flamethrower's damage output, but giving Volcarona the opportunity to survive attacks like Choice Specs Greninja's Surf, giving it an opportunity to set up.</p> "

Its naturally high Speed tier is invaluable to outpace and threaten fast foes such as Iron Valiant and Sandy Shocks. Aside from hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types like Bronzong and Gholdengo, Dark Pulse's lack of immunities makes it a spammable attack that can be used to muscle past neutral Pokemon such as Corviknight with flinches. Ice Beam covers a large portion of the metagame, including Dragon, Ground, Grass, and Flying teams, decimating prominent foes like Hydreigon, Clodsire, Amoonguss, and Iron Jugulis. It's also Greninja's hardest hitting attack against Skuntank, which is important in the Poison matchup. Extrasensory pressures Poison- and Fighting-types like Toxapex and Assault Vest Iron Hands and prevents Greninja from being picked off by Breloom's Mach Punch. Grass Knot rounds out its coverage, significantly damaging Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Water-types such as Gastrodon and Dondozo.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja appreciates being paired with other wallbreakers like Barraskewda and Quaquaval that can handle Normal and Steel teams. They break through bulky Pokemon like Blissey and Kingambit that Greninja struggles with; they are also potent late-game cleaners that enjoy Greninja's ability to threaten Storm Drain Gastrodon and their physically defensive checks like Amoonguss, Toxapex, Slowbro, and Dondozo. Moreover, Barraskewda under rain excels at tearing down fast offensive teams that Greninja can struggle with, as it can threaten out Meowscarada, boosted Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Iron Moth. Quaquaval can also run Rapid Spin to let Greninja enter the field multiple times to wallbreak without worry, preventing it from being chipped down into KO range of priority attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Baxcalibur's Ice Shard. Pivot support from Slowking is helpful to bring Greninja in safely on foes like Dragalge and Gastrodon, letting it fire off attacks freely. Defensive teammates such as Toxapex, Dondozo, Gastrodon, and Quagsire can switch into potential revenge killers like Meowscarada, Chien-Pao, Dragapult, and Slither Wing, respectively; notably, Gastrodon and Quagsire also provide entry hazards to take advantage of the countless switches that Greninja forces, putting the likes of Ting-Lu, Toxapex, and Assault Vest Iron Hands into Greninja's KO range, as well as switch into and check Electric-types such as Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks and Assault Vest Iron Hands.</p> "

With maximum HP and Defense EVs and Foul Play, Klefki efficiently counters opposing Swords Dance and Dragon Dance sweepers such as Scizor and Dragonite. Alternatively, it can use Thunder Wave to cripple fast threats like Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant. Klefki’s Steel typing also provides a useful immunity against Poison-type teams and blocks Glimmora's Mortal Spin, ensuring that entry hazards remain on the opposing field.</p> <p>Belly Drum Azumarill is an excellent partner for Klefki, as the dual screens greatly facilitate setting up with Belly Drum and sweeping opposing teams. Additionally, Spikes provide some chip damage to ensure OHKOs on foes like Meowscarada. Choice Specs Flutter Mane can also take advantage of the chip damage from Klefki's Spikes to power through teams and more easily defeat walls such as Toxapex, Quagsire, and Amoonguss. Calm Mind Flutter Mane benefits both dual screens to set up and sweep and from Thunder Wave slowing down threats like Barraskewda. Iron Valiant appreciates Klefki slowing down faster foes like Flutter Mane, Cinderace, and Dragapult with Thunder Wave, allowing it to defeat them. Iron Valiant also provides a much-needed offensive pressure against Steel-types like Kingambit and works as a devastating offensive core when paired with Flutter Mane. Hatterene and Klefki form a strong defensive core, with the former’s Magic Bounce punishing any attempt from Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Forretress to set entry hazards, while the latter can come in on Poison-type moves, potentially forcing a switch on a Choice locked Pokemon like Greninja in the process. The additional bulk that Hatterene receives from the dual screens even allows it to take a stand against foes such as Glimmora, Clodsire, and Toxapex, preventing them from setting their hazards while countering them.</p> "

Shadow Sneak lets Mimikyu revenge kill weakened offensive threats like Iron Moth and faster Ghost-type Pokemon such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult. Shadow Claw lets Mimikyu break past bulkier Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Skeledirge more readily compared to Shadow Sneak, while Drain Punch is an alternative that threatens opposing Steel-types such as Magnezone and Kingambit. Mimikyu's preferred item is Life Orb to boost its damage output as much as possible.</p> <p>One of Mimikyu's best partners on Fairy teams is Klefki. Mimikyu appreciates Spikes from Klefki, which allows Mimikyu to take down Pokemon easier after a Swords Dance boost. In return, Mimikyu can block Rapid Spin, allowing Klefki's hazards to stay up during the course of the game. Flutter Mane is often paired with Mimikyu since it can threaten physically defensive pokemon that give Mimikyu a hard time like Amoonguss, Quagsire, and Forretress and also faster offensive threats like Iron Moth and Kilowattrel. Mimikyu is able to break through specially defensive Pokemon like Dragalge which gives Flutter Mane an easier time. Hatterene is also a good partner for Mimikyu, as it can bounce back debilitating status conditions like Will-O-Wisp from Sableye and Thunder Wave from Klefki and also bounces back hazards, which helps with Mimikyu's longevity since it runs Life Orb. Furthermore, Mimikyu with its Disguise up can check opposing Ghost-type Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Gholdengo for Hatterene. Iron Valiant is also one of Mimikyu's best offensive teammates, as special sets are able to threaten other physically defensive Pokemon like Dondozo. Additionally, Iron Valiant is useful for Mimikyu in the Ground matchup, where a Choice Specs set can check answers to Mimikyu, such as Quagsire and Clodsire, using Psyshock.

On the other hand, U-turn safely brings in stronger attackers like Dragonite, Iron Jugulis, and Kilowattrel, providing extra counterplay against Pokemon such as Volcarona and Gholdengo, which commonly switch into Corviknight. Pressure is the preferred ability for PP stalling Stealth Rock, while Mirror Armor counters Flutter Mane and Hatterene, which would otherwise overwhelm Corviknight with Mystical Fire. With the listed EV spread and a Careful nature, Corviknight avoids a 2HKO from Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball while guaranteeing Iron Head OHKOes Flutter Mane in return. The remaining EVs are put into Defense to ease its matchup against physical threats such as Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Baxcalibur.</p> <p>Corviknight's capability to take on many offensive threats combined with its Steel typing makes it a stellar asset that almost any offensive Pokemon benefits from. For instance, Iron Jugulis appreciates Corviknight removing Flutter Mane, and Flamigo struggles with Ice Shard variants of Chien-Pao, which Corviknight can safely switch into. Dragonite greatly benefits from Corviknight's ability to soak up Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks while also covering Corviknight's weaknesses to Fire- and Electric-types such as Cinderace, Magnezone, and Volcarona. Gyarados can also act as a reliable wincon against types like Fire and Ground while also making Chien-Pao significantly more managable with Intimidate. Additionally, Kilowattrel is a great offensive pivot to pair with Corviknight, as it removes threats that could harm Corviknight like Greninja, Volcarona, and Azumarill while also absorbing Electric-type attacks. In return, Corviknight counters Iron Treads and Ting-Lu, which threaten Kilowattrel. Pelipper can be paired with Kilowattrel and Corviknight to form a potent rain core that softens the impact of Fire moves and gives Kilowattrel a Water-type Weather Ball, OHKOing many Fire-types that annoy Corviknight including Skeledirge and Rotom-H. Corviknight appreciates having Talonflame as an alternative option against physical attackers, as Talonflame is able to hold off Chien-Pao and burn Great Tusk, Iron Hands, and Dragonite, tremendously easing Corviknight's role.</p> "

Psyshock is Hatterene’s hardest-hitting move against special walls such as Dragalge and Clodsire. Draining Kiss provides useful coverage against Dark- and Dragon-types and meaningful recovery. Mystical Fire hits Steel-types that otherwise stonewall Hatterene, while Nuzzle supports its teammates by spreading paralysis.

Because of this, Armarouge is a wonderful partner for Hatterene, as it can pressure the aforementioned Steel-types while also not having to worry about entry hazards due to Hatterene's Magic Bounce. Espathra forms a strong offensive core with Hatterene that can threaten a wide range of types such as Water, Dragon, and Ground once Hatterene breaks down Espathra’s checks. This core can be enabled further by setting up dual screens with Scream Tail. Indeedee and Gallade ease pressure from Ghost- and Dark-types, respectively, while the former's Psychic Surge can power up Hatterene's Psyshock, and the latter can check Steel-types for Hatterene thanks to its strong Fighting STAB attacks.</p> "

Flamethrower roasts Steel-types such as Corviknight and Scizor without the risk of getting stalled by Pressure, and Thunderbolt nails Toxapex and Dondozo and cleans Water teams late-game.

Flower Trick enables Meowscarada to break through Defense boosted Pokemon such as Curse Dondozo, as well as Pokemon behind dual screens such as Flutter Mane. Play Rough provides the Fairy coverage that enables Meowscarada to threaten Fighting, Dragon, and Dark teams. U-turn is used to allow Meowscarada to pivot out against checks to it, such as Toxapex and Skeledirge, to bring in a teammate that can break through it, such as Breloom and Toedscruel, while also maintaining momentum.</p> <p>While Meowscarada is an effective cleaner, it cannot exactly break through certain Pokemon by itself. Choice Band Breloom is a great teammate for Meowscarada, as it can break through Meowscarada's checks such as Toxapex, Kingambit, and Clodsire. Meowscarada is also vulnerable to Pokemon with strong priority and revenge killers faster than it such as Breloom and Choice Scarf Flutter Mane. Defensive walls such as Amoonguss and Wo-Chien can switch into said priority attacks and revenge killing attempts for Meowscarada. Amoonguss in particular also removes Toxic Spikes, which can be useful for Meowscarada and its teammates. Brambleghast and Toedscruel provide entry hazard removal in Rapid Spin, while also setting up hazards of their own in Spikes. Abomasnow gives an important Ice neutrality to Grass teams, which in tandem with the Defense boost provided by Snow allows it to serve as an answer to Ice-type threats such as Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur. Swords Dance Iron Leaves and Rotom-C provide counterplay to Corviknight that Grass teams otherwise lack, with the former appreciating Meowscarada pivoting out to it when facing Poison-types such as Dragalge and Toxapex, threatening Poison teams in general with its Psychic-type STAB moves and Fighting-type coverage attacks, while the latter forms a pivoting core with Meowscarada.</p> "

Additionally, its Choice Scarf set can outspeed and KO Greninja. Torkoal pairs well with Skeledirge due to its ability to both remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin and set them up, all while also powering up Skeledirge's Torch Song. Cinderace is a fairly good partner as well due to High Jump Kick, letting it remove Dark-types aiming to threaten Skeledirge, while also being able to remove entry hazards with Court Change and hit Poison-types such as Clodsire and Toxapex with Zen Headbutt.

Heavy-Duty Boots lets Espathra ignore entry hazards when switching in and couples well with Roost to increase Espathra's longevity, letting it set up easily. Alternatively, Leftovers in conjunction with Substitute and Roost or Protect lets Espathra safely get Speed boosts while also being able to scout foes' moves. 44 Speed EVs let Espathra outspeed Dragapult at +1 Speed, while the rest are placed into HP and Defense, giving Espathra bulk to set up with ease against Physical Attackers such as Garchomp, Great Tusk and Corviknight.</p> <p>Espathra appreciates teammates that can accentuate its offensive prowess. Scream Tail can set dual screens and paralyze opponents with Thunder Wave to make setting up easie while also setting Stealth Rock and can even Wish pass to Espathra. Gallade, along with Scream Tail with the set of Substitute, Bulk Up, Drain Punch and Play Rough can also punish Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Kingambit.

Indeedee is a Ghost-type switch-in and sets up Psychic Terrain for Espathra, protecting it from priority attacks like Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch. Indeedee is also able to Healing Wish to give Espathra a second chance to sweep. Stored Power Armarouge forms a dangerous core with Espathra, which can break for Espathra, clean after it, and also beat Steel teams. Hatterene bounces back entry hazards for Espathra if it forgoes Heavy-Duty Boots while also beating Dark- and Dragon-types.

Swords Dance allows Kingambit to capitalize on its already great Attack stat, letting it threaten defensive walls such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Corviknight. Making up for its lack of Speed, Sucker Punch fits perfectly on Kingambit. In tandem with three boosts from Supreme Overlord, Sucker Punch OHKOes Flutter Mane; it also OHKOes Volcarona after Swords Dance in tandem with two Supreme Overlord boosts. Kowtow Cleave is a reliable heavy-hitting STAB attack, and Iron Head hits Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Azumarill. Supreme Overlord is one of Kingambit's main selling points, allowing it to 2HKO Specially Defensive Corviknight and almost always 2HKO Quagsire after Stealth Rock. The Speed EVs allow Kingambit to outspeed both Corviknight and Skeledirge, both which otherwise can threaten Kingambit with Body Press and Will-O-Wisp, respectively. Leftovers are used to support Kingambit's solid defensive stats, giving it a form of recovery.</p> <p>Kingambit functions as an excellent late-game sweeper, making use of its ability and setup potential; thus, Kingambit greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Ting-Lu to pressure offensive teams who lack hazard removal. Greninja and Hydreigon cover physically defensive walls, hitting Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Amoonguss that Kingambit would otherwise struggle with. Sableye provides an important Fighting-type immunity to make up for Kingambit's typing. Skuntank can be used in combination with Kingambit to ease the Fairy-type matchup and set Toxic Spikes, chipping foes and making it easier for Kingambit to sweep late-game. Chien-Pao and Meowscarda help make up for some of Kingambit's type weaknesses. Chien-Pao can hit Ground-types such as Garchomp and Great Tusk. Meowscarda can make use of Choice Scarf combined with Play Rough to hit Fighting-types such as Iron Valiant while also hitting Ground- and Water-types such as Quagsire.</p> "

Knock Off complements Great Tusk's ability to spin by strongly hitting Ghost-types such as Brambleghast, Gholdengo, and Dragapult hard while also removing Heavy-Duty Boots. Lastly, Great Tusk provides Stealth Rock support for the team, which helps to break Focus Sash on Breloom. Heavy-Duty Boots is the premier choice, as it allows Great Tusk to spin away hazards without being poisoned by Toxic Spikes or worn down by Spikes. Leftovers is a solid alternative to provide Great Tusk with passive recovery, but generally avoiding hazard damage is more important. The EV spread outpaces neutral nature Tyranitar and uninvested Brambleghast while maximizing Great Tusk's physical bulk.</p> <p>Assault Vest Iron Hands is a great partner to Great Tusk, sponging special hits aimed at it while also threatening Pokemon such as Choice Specs Pelipper and Hatterene. Iron Hands also appreciates Great Tusk's ability to keep entry hazards off the field so it doesn't get worn down. Wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant and Breloom appreciate Great Tusk's ability to threaten Poison-types such as Clodsire and Skuntank, allowing them to continue rampaging against the opponent. Due to it being an amazing special attacker, Iron Valiant in particular can threaten physical walls like Quagsire, Sableye, and Dondozo, which like to switch into Great Tusk. Choice Scarf users such as Flamigo, Quaquaval, and Slither Wing pressure special attackers faster than Great Tusk such as Choice Specs Greninja, Dragapult, and opposing Iron Valiant.

Mystical Fire hits Steel-types such as Klefki and Iron Treads. Psyshock allows Flutter Mane to punish specially defensive switch-ins like Dragalge, Blissey, and Clodsire. Flutter Mane can run Power Gem to pressure Fire teams, OHKOing foes like Volcarona and Torkoal, and it also benefits from Protosynthesis allowing it to outspeed Scovillain under the sun. Additionally, Flutter Mane usually goes with either Thunderbolt or Energy Ball. Both are useful against Water teams, with the former helping against Toxapex and Pelipper while the latter deals with Gastrodon and Quagsire. Choice Specs further enhances Flutter Mane's wallbreaking power, allowing it to overwhelm foes such as Ting-Lu after some chip damage.</p> <p>On Fairy teams, Flutter Mane is a menacing wallbreaker that excels at taking down slower foes such as Hydreigon, Skeledirge, and Corviknight. When paired with Iron Valiant, Flutter Mane forms an offensive core that's able to alternate between Fairy-, Ghost-, and Fighting-type STAB to take down a wide range of enemies. Flutter Mane can handle Psychic-type foes such as Espathra and Hatterene, while Iron Valiant takes care of Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. Flutter Mane can fall back on either Hatterene or Tinkaton when faced with an unfavorable matchup. Both of these Pokemon provide dependable defensive options and some type of entry hazard control, but Hatterene is particularly useful due to it breaking down walls like Dondozo and Clodsire. Flutter Mane also pairs well with setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Mimikyu, as it is able to poke holes in the opponent's team, allowing them to clean late-game. In return, Azumarill can take care of priority users, such as Ceruledge and Chien-Pao. In terms of support options, Flutter Mane can rely on Fairy's Prankster users, Klefki and Grimmsnarl, to set up dual screens, therefore allowing it to withstand hits such as Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Gholdengo's Make It Rain. Grimmsnarl can then bring in Flutter Mane relatively safely thanks to Parting Shot. Klefki's Spikes and Tinkaton's Stealth Rocks also support Flutter Mane in breaking its checks such as Iron Hands and Ting Lu. Entry hazard stacking proves particularly useful against less bulky teams, as it highly limits their capacity to scout Flutter Mane without having to sacrifice a member in the process.</p> "

Wallbreakers like Mimikyu and Gholdengo can pressure the opposition early-game, allowing for Flutter Mane to clean up late-game with ease; moreover, Mimikyu can overwhelm Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads with Drain Punch, while Gholdengo can make use of Trick to cripple walls like Clodsire and Corviknight. Setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Swords Dance Ceruledge are valuable teammates that function as back-up late-game cleaners, especially against types Flutter Mane can struggle with such as Poison and Steel. Moreover, Ceruledge and Mimikyu have the added benefit of safely revenge killing opposing fast threats Flutter Mane can't handle easily, like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane and Dragon Dance Dragapult, with Shadow Sneak. Skeledirge is a notable partner to compensate for Flutter Mane's lack of physical bulk, taking on Bullet Punch users like Scizor and Lucario as well as being fantastic in the Steel, Fighting, and Bug matchups.</p> "

Gholdengo is another great partner, as it not only also helps against Fighting-types that Corviknight can't handle such as Iron Valiant, but it also overwhelms physical walls such as Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Dondozo. Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Tinkaton, Orthworm, and Bronzong also aid in Iron Treads sweeping. Tinkaton specifically ensures Stealth Rock being set due to Mold Breaker while having a decent offensive presence thanks to Gigaton Hammer being so powerful. Orthworm provides a Ground immunity, easing pressure off other teammates such as Corviknight, all while also having Spikes and Stealth Rock. Bronzong can not only set up Stealth Rock, but it can also take on Fire-type moves that are aimed at Iron Treads.

Substitute can be used instead to give Gholdengo some security against faster threats that can take it out such as Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, and Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Recover is also another option to keep Gholdengo healthy, since it can be worn down fairly easily.

Scizor appreciates Gholdengo's ability to take care of physical walls, allowing it to clean up with STAB Bullet Punch. Scizor can also pivot into Gholdengo on physical walls such as Skeledirge, allowing Gholdengo to threaten the opposing Pokemon easier.

Choice Scarf Iron Treads also appreciates Gholdengo's ability to break physical walls such as opposing Corviknight and Great Tusk early-game so that it can sweep late-game. Dual screens support from Klefki allows Gholdengo to have an easier time setting up and potentially sweeping. Another good partner for Gholdengo is Corviknight, as it removes entry hazards while also providing a Ground immunity once Air Balloon is gone. Corviknight can also run a Bulk Up or Iron Defense set that appreciates Pokemon like Skeledirge being taken care of while helping Gholdengo have an easier time breaking stall. Orthworm is another good choice, as it provides Shed Tail support as well as having access to Spikes and Stealth Rock. Bronzong is also an amazing partner as well, as it can not only set up Stealth Rock, but it can also tank Fire-type moves thanks to Heatproof.</p> "

Make it Rain greatly weakens Dark- and Normal-types such as Hydreigon and Indeedee, and it OHKOes Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Chien-Pao. Shadow Ball lets Gholdengo clean types such as Psychic and Ghost late-game. Trick neutralizes defensive pivots such as Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, which typically switch into it. The last move of choice is dependent on what the Ghost team lacks; Focus Blast gives the team another way to defeat Choice Specs Greninja, Thunderbolt cleans Water- and Flying-teams, or Nasty Plot which turns Gholdengo into a massive threat against bulkier teams especially after their main specially defensive wall has been given a Choice Scarf with Trick.</p> <p>As Gholdengo provides the needed revenge killing capabilities on Ghost teams, teammates such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult are free to run sets like Choice Specs and Dragon Dance, respectively. Both also break down walls such as Clodsire and Gastrodon; in return, Gholdengo deals with Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Gallade. Skeledirge walls most physical attackers and Fire-types such as Scovillain and Volcarona. Mimikyu provides a safety net against offensive types like rain Water and Ghost, checking Barraskewda and Choice Scarf Flutter Mane for the team, and it loves Gholdengo shutting down defensive walls such as Toxapex with Trick. Entry hazard setters in Brambleghast and Froslass are is also greatly appreciated, as they can set, remove, or prevent entry hazards for Gholdengo; in return, Gholdengo prevents their entry hazards from getting removed by Glimmora. Brambleghast also switches into Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk and deals with Water-types like Gastrodon and Dondozo, while Froslass can spread paralysis with Thunder Wave and bring down an opposing Pokemon with its Destiny Bond.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Chien-Pao is an imposing force for any Dark team with its sky high Speed, blitzing past threats like Iron Valiant and Greninja, and great Attack. Sword of Ruin lets it beat physical walls like Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Toxapex, though it doesn't have great bulk and has to watch out for super effective priority moves from Scizor, Lokix, and Slither Wing and struggles to break past walls like Dondozo and Quagsire. With Swords Dance, it can boost up to beat even the likes of Corviknight and Toxapex if it has Crunch. Fighting-type coverage picks off Dark-types like Kingambit and Greninja. Sacred Sword picks off weakened Garganacl, while Brick Break destroys opposing Dark or Fairy team's dual screens. Ice Shard stops common revenge killers like Choice Scarf Meowscarada, Flutter Mane, and Great Tusk.</p> <p>As Chien-Pao focuses on breaking down foes with its sheer power and Speed, it appreciates support from its teammates. Ting-Lu can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes while Skuntank can set up Toxic Spikes and pressure Fairy-types, all of which make wallbreaking for Chien-Pao easier. Grimmsnarl provides Chien-Pao with dual screens support, making setting up easier. Sableye can burn opposing Pokemon and cripple them with Taunt and Knock Off, removing Heavy-Duty Boots and making foes susceptible to hazards, while also acting as a Fighting-type move switch-in. Choice Specs Greninja can clean up after Chien-Pao has done enough damage while also countering Fire-types that would annoy Chien-Pao such as Skeledirge and Cinderace if Chien-Pao does not have Crunch. Hydreigon can break Steel-types for Chien-Pao if it foregoes Fighting-type coverage or Swords Dance, beating Fighting-neutral Steel-types like Corviknight and Scizor. Choice Scarf Meowscarada is able to threaten Pokemon that counter Chien-Pao such as Quaquaval and Choice Scarf users such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Great Tusk, while also being able to pivot to Chien-Pao with U-Turn.</p> "

Earthquake is a reliable STAB move that hits most of the metagame for decent damage while also scaring Clodsire out and preventing it from setting Toxic Spikes. Heavy Slam hits Fairy-types that would otherwise overpower Ting-Lu, such as Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, while also threatening Hatterene trying to bounce back hazards. Stealth Rock and Spikes allow Ting-Lu to support wallbreakers such as Meowscarada or Greninja. Whirlwind allows Ting-Lu to phase out setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Curse Dondozo and rack up entry hazard damage, while Ruination provides consistent damage against other walls such as Amoonguss and Corviknight that don't mind any of Ting-Lu's other moves.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Meowscarada, Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Greninja all appreciate Ting-Lu's ability to set entry hazards, as they wear down common defensive answers such as Toxapex, Iron Treads, and Dondozo. In return, they can scare out threats to Ting-Lu; Meowscarada can deal with Greninja, Chien-Pao and Greninja can threaten Great Tusk, and Kingambit can force out Fairy-types such as Hatterene. Skuntank is a good partner as well, since it offers a crucial neutrality to Fairy, threatens Fairy-types, and sets and clears Toxic Spikes, augmenting Ting-Lu's entry hazards and improving its longevity. Additionally, Skuntank can utilize Fire Spin to further chip down teams and trap Klefki, improving Ting-Lu's matchup against Fairy. In return, Ting-Lu can assist in Ground matchups through its bulk. Sableye is also a great partner due to its Fighting immunity, taking attacks Ting-Lu can't such as Great Tusk's and Iron Hands's Close Combat.</p> "

Assault Vest Iron Hands is a fantastic partner as well thanks to its ginormous HP stat that lets it deal with Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane and Hatterene that can outspeed or wall Iron Valiant. Choice Scarf users such as Flamigo, Quaquaval, and Slither Wing pressure Pokemon faster than Iron Valiant such as Greninja, Dragapult, and Cinderace.
