        "description": "<p>Azumarill is Fairy's premier setup sweeper with immense damage output thanks to Huge Power alongside Belly Drum, which allows Azumarill to handle threats to the type such as Glimmora and Iron Treads. Aqua Jet patches up its below-average Speed tier and threatens faster threats like Iron Moth, Sandy Shocks, and Flutter Mane. Aqua Jet can also sweep late-game, especially against types that lack Water-resistant Pokemon like Steel. Play Rough breaks through sturdier threats that are not OHKOed by Aqua Jet like Hydreigon and Iron Hands. It also threatens opposing Dragon-types like Roaring Moon and Dragalge. Liquidation can be used over Play Rough to OHKO Pokemon like Corviknight, Unaware Clodsire, and Bronzong after Belly Drum. Ice Spinner specifically hits Water Absorb Clodsire and Amoonguss for super effective damage. Body Slam is also another option to significantly threaten Toxapex at +6 Attack while still being able to target the aforementioned Clodsire and Amoonguss for neutral damage. Trailblaze can be used to always beat Quagsire as well. 4 HP EVs are given to make Azumarill's HP an even number so when it activates Belly Drum from full HP, it can activate its Sitrus Berry immediately.</p> <p>One of Azumarill's best partners on Fairy teams is Klefki. Klefki sets up dual screens, which leads to Azumarill having an easier time setting up and sweeping. Klefki also sets Spikes for Azumarill, allowing Azumarill to secure KOs easier after a Belly Drum, particularly against Amoonguss and Toxapex after one layer of Spikes. Klefki also hinders Azumarill's offensive checks like Breloom with Thunder Wave. In return, Azumarill threatens opposing Fire- and Ground-types that threaten Klefki like Cinderace and Great Tusk. Azumarill forms a potent offensive core with Flutter Mane, which threatens the physical walls that may impede Azumarill's sweep like Unaware Quagsire and Toxapex, while Azumarill handles special walls like specially defensive Ting-Lu, Assault Vest Iron Hands, and Blissey. Azumarill also appreciates Iron Valiant as an offensive partner, as special sets can answer physical walls like Dondozo and hinder Azumarill's checks like Toxapex by using Trick, and—like with Flutter Mane—Azumarill can deal considerable damage to threats like Clodsire and Gholdengo. Magic Bounce Hatterene also assists Azumarill, as it bounces back entry hazards—particularly Toxic Spikes—which limits Azumarill's sweeping capabilities. Hatterene also has a strong matchup into Ground, Poison, and Water teams; Azumarill appreciates the latter two, since Hatterene is able to threaten Pokemon like Amoonguss and Toxapex.</p> "

Swords Dance allows Scizor to OHKO the likes of Dragapult and Cyclizar. Technician-boosted Bullet Punch is Scizor's most spammable attack, serving as a priority STAB move to revenge kill sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Flutter Mane. Close Combat answers Steel teams and threaten slower walls like Ting-Lu and Corviknight. Trailblaze allows Scizor to outspeed threats like Great Tusk and Hydreigon at +1 Speed and hits Quagsire and Gastrodon. Fury Cutter provides an additional Technician-boosted STAB move and is mainly used in tandem with Metronome to break Dondozo. Thief offers coverage and allows Life Orb Scizor to answer Gholdengo and 2HKO Skeledirge thanks to the boost from Technician, though Life Orb isn't recommended outside of these scenarios. Alternatively, Metal Coat enhances the power of Bullet Punch without drawbacks. The EV spread maximizes Scizor's damage output and allows it to outspeed uninvested Rotom forms and Adamant Azumarill.</p> <p>Volcarona is the perfect partner for Scizor, as it's less threatened by Fire-types and can sweep through most Steel, Psychic, and Ground teams. It takes care of Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Klefki; in return, Scizor handles Rock-types like Glimmora and Lycanroc-D and weakens the opposing team to facilitate Volcarona's late-game sweep. Slither Wing offers great coverage against types that Scizor struggles to beat, threatening Electric- and Rock-types with Earthquake, Flying- and Water-types with Wild Charge, and Steel-types with Flare Blitz or Close Combat. Similar to Scizor, Lokix gets two powerful STAB priority moves in First Impression and Sucker Punch which, paired with Tinted Lens, allow it to OHKO faster threats like Greninja, Gengar, and Kilowattrel after chip damage. These priority moves, along with Masquerain's Sticky Web support, allow Bug teams to compensate for their generally slower Speed tier. Another good partner to Scizor is Guts Heracross, which can sponge status moves targeting its teammates and sweep through teams that have been weakened by Scizor. With its combination of Sleep Powder and Energy Ball, Vivillon can take out threats that give Bug teams trouble, particularly Dondozo. Rabsca and Forretress provide substantial support; Rabsca's Revival Blessing offers Scizor a second chance at breaking down the opponent's team, while Forretress's entry hazard stacking and Rapid Spin combination allows its teammates to switch in more safely and make holes in the opposing team.</p> "

Roost allows Pelipper to come in multiple times throughout the match to re-set rain if need be. U-turn let's it slow pivot into threats such as Quaquaval and Barraskewda. Knock Off cripples foes, while Surf gives a secondary STAB move boosted by rain, allowing Pelipper to wear down Pokemon like Gholdengo and Kingambit. Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to switch in and set rain even if Stealth Rock is up. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 48 Def / 212 Spe with a Timid nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Breloom.</p> <p>Barraskewda is the obvious partner choice thanks to its ridiculous Speed with Swift Swim in rain. It also appreciates Pelipper's slow pivoting with U-turn due to its lack of bulk. Walking Wake is another great rain attacker, since its STAB Dragon-type moves hit most Water-resistant and immune foes, such as opposing Gastrodon and Amoonguss, hard. Quaquaval appreciates Pelipper's slow pivoting to come in safely and can potentially snowball through teams with rain-boosted Aqua Step and Moxie. Quaquaval can also get rid of entry hazards should Pelipper get hit by Knock Off, provided it has Rapid Spin. Gastrodon and Quagsire are also really good partners thanks to their Electric immunities. Both also provide entry hazards, pressuring opponents, and Pelipper can use hazard removal turns to pivot out with U-turn or heal with Roost. Rotom-W can form a VoltTurn core with Pelipper, allowing the team to gain momentum easily and bring in Pokemon fairly safely. Rotom-W can also switch into opposing Electric-types like Magnezone, Iron Hands, and Sandy Shocks if necessary. Toxapex provides a Fighting resistance, a Grass neutrality, and another pivot thanks to its ability, Regenerator. Slowking checks threats such as Indeedee and Walking Wake, and it's another slow pivot thanks to Chilly Reception and Regenerator, bringing Pelipper in safely to set the rain. Both Toxapex and Slowking can also easily pivot into Pelipper with Eject Button, since Regenerator means they won't lose too much health from an attack. Azumarill can take advantage of rain with priority in Aqua Jet, as well as bringing a very strong Water-type STAB move.</p> "

Spore gives Breloom setup opportunities and impedes otherwise major threats to the team such as Flying-types like Corviknight and Pelipper and Poison-types such as Toxapex, Iron Moth, and Clodsire. Focus Sash guarantees it can use Spore at least once—provided Breloom can keep itself at full HP—and also gives Breloom the opportunity to use Swords Dance as well. Bullet Seed is a fantastic STAB move that threatens Water-types like Dondozo and Quagsire. Mach Punch provides Breloom with a super strong STAB move with priority to not only circumvent its below average Speed but also threatens faster Pokemon such as Meowscarada, Iron Treads, and Cyclizar. Swords Dance allows Breloom to not only power up its STAB moves but takes advantage of the setup opportunities that Spore can provide.

Entry hazard control from Great Tusk is imperative to allow Breloom to keep its Focus Sash intact. Great Tusk also helps Breloom by providing Stealth Rock, which racks up chip damage with the switches Breloom can force. Gallade is a great partner that can threaten Poison-types such as Amoonguss and Toxapex. Iron Valiant is another fantastic partner for Breloom, providing Future Sight support to ward off the Poison-types that like to switch into both of Breloom's STAB moves.

With Bullet Seed or Close Combat, it also can function as a good wallbreaker. Spore is an amazing utility move to stop threats and force out Pokemon like Skeledirge. However, with the use of other Spore users like Amoonguss and Toedscruel, Spore can be replaced with Swords Dance. With it, Breloom can set up when opponents predict it will use Spore, increasing its late-game cleaning potential. An Adamant nature is standard, but Jolly Breloom can outspeed Adamant Dragonite, Adamant Cetitan, and Choice Specs Pelipper.</p> <p>Other offensive teammates like Meowscarada and Rotom-C benefit from Breloom forcing out threats with Spore or breaking through Pokemon like Toxapex, Corviknight, or Ting-lu with its high Attack stat and Spore. In exchange, Meowscarada handles Psychic-types such as Gallade and Espathra. Setup Pokemon like Substitute Rotom-C work especially well with Breloom, as they can come in freely on a slept enemy or a physical wall Breloom draws in. The type's more passive defensive Pokemon also support Breloom, with Amoonguss dealing with Fairy-types and Wo-Chien, by using Leech Seed on a foe, allowing chipped Breloom to switch in and restore its Focus Sash protection. Breloom also enjoys Spikes or Toxic Spikes Brambleghast or Toedscruel to chip foes into KO range, including Toxapex and Iron Hands after a Swords Dance. Aurora Veil from Abomasnow can increase Breloom's chances to set up with Swords Dance. Breloom is weak against bulkier Pokemon with multi-hit moves, which can instantly KO it through Focus Sash, like Icicle Spear from Baxcalibur. Thus, entry hazards to wear them down and physical walls, like Body Press Abomasnow, are very important. Once chipped, Breloom's frailty and low Speed make it weak to faster priority users and to other offensive Pokemon not bothered by Mach Punch. To handle the latter, such as Flutter Mane and Paldean Tauros-B, faster teammates like Choice Scarf Meoscarada and Rotom-C can be very helpful.</p> "

Taunt lets it shut down set up attempts from Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and Bulk Up Corviknight or hinder opposing defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex and Clodsire. Taunt also blocks entry hazards from going up, which is huge for Dark due to its lack of entry hazard control. Alternatively, Encore lets Sableye halt the aforementioned setup attempts and gain more momentum from them. Knock Off capitalizes on the switches that Sableye forces by knocking off crucial items from Pokemon such as Toxapex or Dondozo. Alternatively, Night Shade deals steady damage throughout the game. Finally, Recover gives Sableye longevity to continually check the aforementioned threats. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Sableye come in and out without worrying about residual damage from entry hazards.</p> <p>Some great teammates for Sableye include Skuntank and Kingambit, as both of them boast a critical neutrality to Fairy that lets them take hits such as Choice Scarf Iron Valiant's and Flutter Mane's Moonblasts and force both out.

Amoonguss also deals with threatening Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Quagsire, and Sandy Shocks thanks to its good bulk, Grass-type STAB move, and Ground neutrality. Toxapex, on the other hand, deals with threats like Chien-Pao, Cloyster, and Scizor with Infestation and Haze while laying down Toxic Spikes. Specially defensive Clodsire complements Skuntank by dealing with special attackers it can't handle by itself, such as Gholdengo, Magnezone, and Volcarona. Iron Moth deals with the multitude of Steel-types like Gholdengo, Iron Treads, and Corviknight that Skuntank can't do much against. Corrosion Glimmora and Salazzle help cripple Steel-types and opposing Poison-types with Toxic, with each also providing different utilities; Glimmora packs Poison's only entry hazard removal thanks to Mortal Spin, which allows Skuntank to come in safely, while Salazzle's Encore acts as a counterplay against powerful setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Kingambit.</p> "

Flamethrower is the go-to STAB move for Volcarona, as it hits Steel- and Ice-types such as Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Chien-Pao. Optionally, Fiery Dance can be used over Flamethrower, which has an additional effect of boosting Special Attack, but Flamethrower is preferred due to a higher Base Power. Psychic primarily covers Poison-types like Toxapex, Glimmora, and Iron Moth, but it also hits Fighting-types such as Quaquval and Great Tusk. Morning Sun provides reliable recovery, which allows Volcarona to further set up and threaten to sweep. Alternatively, Giga Drain targets Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Quagsire, Greninja, and Gastrodon. Bug Buzz can be used over Psychic to hit Dark- and Psychic-types such as Hydreigon, Ting-Lu, and Espathra. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps Volcarona safe from entry hazards, while Flame Body debilitates physical attackers. A Timid nature allows Volcarona to outspeed Choice Scarf Flamigo after a single Quiver Dance boost.</p> <p>Volcarona and Scizor make a great pair, as Scizor—thanks to its Steel-typing—helps Volcarona by switching into Toxic from Clodsire, and it deals with Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Lycanroc thanks to Bullet Punch. Volcarona appreciates entry hazard support from Forretress, which pressures and wears down the opposing team. Choice Scarf Heracross helps against Steel- and Dark-types—such as Iron Treads and Kingambit—and Flying-types—like Kilowattrel—with Close Combat and Stone Edge, respectively; in return, Volcarona helps deal with Corviknight, which Heracross struggles to break. Slither Wing threatens Flying- and Water-types such as Iron Jugulis, Pelipper, and Greninja with Wild Charge, and threatens Corviknight with Flare Blitz. It can safely pivot in Volcarona, enabling its sweep. Both Slither Wing and Heracross pressure specially defensive walls such as Clodsire and Blissey, which Volcarona struggles to break. Lokix helps against Ghost-, Psychic- and Dark-types like Skeledirge, Espathra, Armarouge, Meowscarada, and Greninja thanks to First Impression, Throat Chop, and Sucker Punch.

        "description": "<p>A potent offensive presence, Volcarona's access to Quiver Dance provides the backbone to its sweeping capabilities. Bug Buzz is Volcarona's main attacking option and can be combined with Swarm to increase damage as Volcarona loses HP while setting up, allowing Volcarona to OHKO checks like offensive Garchomp after one Quiver Dance. Psychic is essential, as it allows Volcarona to hit one of Fire's strongest checks, Toxapex, but also super effectively damages Poison-types and Fighting-types such as Glimmora and Quaquaval. The last slot is interchangeable, though generally Flamethrower is preferred as a STAB move that can also take advantage of sun support on Fire teams and is essential to for the Flying matchup, allowing it to hit Corviknight and Kilowattrel. Giga Drain can be used to give Volcarona a better chance of breaking through Water and Ground teams and give it a recovery option. Similarly, Morning Sun gives Volcarona more setup opportunities. Flame Body can also be used to threaten burns on Pokemon such as Kingambit and Dragonite, which oftentimes revenge kill Volcarona. Given its all-around solid defensive stats, Volcarona finds a myriad of opportunities to set up and takes advantage of the maximum Speed spread given to capitalize on the boosts as much as possible, outspeeding Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Great Tusk or Choice Scarf Dragapult after one or two Quiver Dances boosts, respectively</p> <p>Generally, Volcarona is best saved for mid- to late-game, when the opposing team has been chipped down and Volcarona has an opportunity to sweep after setting up. Utilizing its offensive teammates such as Scovillian, Cereludge, Cinderace, and Paldean Tauros-F to slowly chip down defensive walls such as Dodonzo, Ting-Lu, and Blissey provides better opportunity for Volcarona to sweep later in the game. Paldean Tauros-F is specifically useful with its ability to remove dual screens, preventing Volcarona's setup from being hindered. Rotom-H also provides excellent support, aiding in the Water matchup if Giga Drain is not used and providing pivot support to switch Volcarona in. Skeledirge and Talonflame provide defensive support to wear down offensive threats such as Dragonite. Torkoal providing sun support on Fire aids Volcarona, not only increasing Flamethrower's damage output, but giving Volcarona the opportunity to survive attacks like Choice Specs Greninja's Surf, giving it an opportunity to set up.</p> "

Its naturally high Speed tier is invaluable to outpace and threaten fast foes such as Iron Valiant and Sandy Shocks. Aside from hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types like Bronzong and Gholdengo, Dark Pulse's lack of immunities makes it a spammable attack that can be used to muscle past neutral Pokemon such as Corviknight with flinches. Ice Beam covers a large portion of the metagame, including Dragon, Ground, Grass, and Flying teams, decimating prominent foes like Hydreigon, Clodsire, Amoonguss, and Iron Jugulis. It's also Greninja's hardest hitting attack against Skuntank, which is important in the Poison matchup. Extrasensory pressures Poison- and Fighting-types like Toxapex and Assault Vest Iron Hands and prevents Greninja from being picked off by Breloom's Mach Punch. Grass Knot rounds out its coverage, significantly damaging Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Water-types such as Gastrodon and Dondozo.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja appreciates being paired with other wallbreakers like Barraskewda and Quaquaval that can handle Normal and Steel teams. They break through bulky Pokemon like Blissey and Kingambit that Greninja struggles with; they are also potent late-game cleaners that enjoy Greninja's ability to threaten Storm Drain Gastrodon and their physically defensive checks like Amoonguss, Toxapex, Slowbro, and Dondozo. Moreover, Barraskewda under rain excels at tearing down fast offensive teams that Greninja can struggle with, as it can threaten out Meowscarada, boosted Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Iron Moth. Quaquaval can also run Rapid Spin to let Greninja enter the field multiple times to wallbreak without worry, preventing it from being chipped down into KO range of priority attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Baxcalibur's Ice Shard. Pivot support from Slowking is helpful to bring Greninja in safely on foes like Dragalge and Gastrodon, letting it fire off attacks freely. Defensive teammates such as Toxapex, Dondozo, Gastrodon, and Quagsire can switch into potential revenge killers like Meowscarada, Chien-Pao, Dragapult, and Slither Wing, respectively; notably, Gastrodon and Quagsire also provide entry hazards to take advantage of the countless switches that Greninja forces, putting the likes of Ting-Lu, Toxapex, and Assault Vest Iron Hands into Greninja's KO range, as well as switch into and check Electric-types such as Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks and Assault Vest Iron Hands.</p> "

With maximum HP and Defense EVs and Foul Play, Klefki efficiently counters opposing Swords Dance and Dragon Dance sweepers such as Scizor and Dragonite.

Klefki’s Steel typing also provides a useful immunity against Poison-type teams and blocks Glimmora's Mortal Spin, ensuring that entry hazards remain on the opposing field.</p> <p>Belly Drum Azumarill is an excellent partner for Klefki, as the dual screens greatly facilitate setting up with Belly Drum and sweeping opposing teams. Additionally, Spikes provide some chip damage to ensure OHKOs on foes like Meowscarada. Choice Specs Flutter Mane can also take advantage of the chip damage from Klefki's Spikes to power through teams and more easily defeat walls such as Toxapex, Quagsire, and Amoonguss. Calm Mind Flutter Mane benefits both dual screens to set up and sweep and from Thunder Wave slowing down threats like Barraskewda. Iron Valiant appreciates Klefki slowing down faster foes like Flutter Mane, Cinderace, and Dragapult with Thunder Wave, allowing it to defeat them. Iron Valiant also provides a much-needed offensive pressure against Steel-types like Kingambit and works as a devastating offensive core when paired with Flutter Mane. Hatterene and Klefki form a strong defensive core, with the former’s Magic Bounce punishing any attempt from Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Forretress to set entry hazards, while the latter can come in on Poison-type moves, potentially forcing a switch on a Choice locked Pokemon like Greninja in the process. The additional bulk that Hatterene receives from the dual screens even allows it to take a stand against foes such as Glimmora, Clodsire, and Toxapex, preventing them from setting their hazards while countering them.</p> "

Shadow Sneak lets Mimikyu revenge kill weakened offensive threats like Iron Moth and faster Ghost-type Pokemon such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult. Shadow Claw lets Mimikyu break past bulkier Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Skeledirge more readily compared to Shadow Sneak, while Drain Punch is an alternative that threatens opposing Steel-types such as Magnezone and Kingambit.

Flutter Mane is often paired with Mimikyu since it can threaten physically defensive pokemon that give Mimikyu a hard time like Amoonguss, Quagsire, and Forretress and also faster offensive threats like Iron Moth and Kilowattrel. Mimikyu is able to break through specially defensive Pokemon like Dragalge which gives Flutter Mane an easier time. Hatterene is also a good partner for Mimikyu, as it can bounce back debilitating status conditions like Will-O-Wisp from Sableye and Thunder Wave from Klefki and also bounces back hazards, which helps with Mimikyu's longevity since it runs Life Orb. Furthermore, Mimikyu with its Disguise up can check opposing Ghost-type Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Gholdengo for Hatterene. Iron Valiant is also one of Mimikyu's best offensive teammates, as special sets are able to threaten other physically defensive Pokemon like Dondozo. Additionally, Iron Valiant is useful for Mimikyu in the Ground matchup, where a Choice Specs set can check answers to Mimikyu, such as Quagsire and Clodsire, using Psyshock.

Shadow Sneak picks off faster threats that could otherwise revenge kill Mimikyu, such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane.

Froslass and Brambleghast can place Spikes to help Mimikyu clean up and use Taunt or Rapid Spin, respectively, so opposing entry hazards don't wear it down. Choice Scarf Flutter Mane helps Mimikyu against both Dark- and Dragon-type teams by taking down faster threats that could KO it after Disguise has been removed, such as Meowscarada and Chien-Pao, which resist Shadow Sneak. Nasty Plot Gholdengo deals with bulkier teams like Ground and Poison teams, as well as absorbing Toxic from bulky walls such as Toxapex. Furthermore, Gholdengo can also run Trick with a Choice item, which can cripple annoying walls such as Quagsire and Dondozo to help Mimikyu deal with them. Polteageist can clean up Poison teams after Skuntank is KOed, as well as Ground, Water, and Fighting teams.

        "description": "<p>Corviknight has easily cemented itself as a staple on Flying teams, acting as an extremely versatile defensive wall that can also remove entry hazards for its teammates. Iron Head allows Corviknight to handle Flutter Mane and other Fairy-types such as Mimikyu and Hatterene. Body Press hits Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and other Dark- and Steel-types hard. On the other hand, U-turn safely brings in stronger attackers like Dragonite, Iron Jugulis, and Kilowattrel, providing extra counterplay against Pokemon such as Volcarona and Gholdengo, which commonly switch into Corviknight. Pressure is the preferred ability for PP stalling Stealth Rock, while Mirror Armor counters Flutter Mane and Hatterene, which would otherwise overwhelm Corviknight with Mystical Fire. With the listed EV spread and a Careful nature, Corviknight avoids a 2HKO from Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball while guaranteeing Iron Head OHKOes Flutter Mane in return. The remaining EVs are put into Defense to ease its matchup against physical threats such as Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Baxcalibur.</p> <p>Corviknight's capability to take on many offensive threats combined with its Steel typing makes it a stellar asset that almost any offensive Pokemon benefits from. For instance, Iron Jugulis appreciates Corviknight removing Flutter Mane, and Flamigo struggles with Ice Shard variants of Chien-Pao, which Corviknight can safely switch into. Dragonite greatly benefits from Corviknight's ability to soak up Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks while also covering Corviknight's weaknesses to Fire- and Electric-types such as Cinderace, Magnezone, and Volcarona. Gyarados can also act as a reliable wincon against types like Fire and Ground while also making Chien-Pao significantly more managable with Intimidate. Additionally, Kilowattrel is a great offensive pivot to pair with Corviknight, as it removes threats that could harm Corviknight like Greninja, Volcarona, and Azumarill while also absorbing Electric-type attacks. In return, Corviknight counters Iron Treads and Ting-Lu, which threaten Kilowattrel. Pelipper can be paired with Kilowattrel and Corviknight to form a potent rain core that softens the impact of Fire moves and gives Kilowattrel a Water-type Weather Ball, OHKOing many Fire-types that annoy Corviknight including Skeledirge and Rotom-H. Corviknight appreciates having Talonflame as an alternative option against physical attackers, as Talonflame is able to hold off Chien-Pao and burn Great Tusk, Iron Hands, and Dragonite, tremendously easing Corviknight's role.</p> "

Psyshock is Hatterene’s hardest-hitting move against special walls such as Dragalge and Clodsire. Draining Kiss provides useful coverage against Dark- and Dragon-types and meaningful recovery. Mystical Fire hits Steel-types that otherwise stonewall Hatterene, while Nuzzle supports its teammates by spreading paralysis.

Because of this, Armarouge is a wonderful partner for Hatterene, as it can pressure the aforementioned Steel-types while also not having to worry about entry hazards due to Hatterene's Magic Bounce. Espathra forms a strong offensive core with Hatterene that can threaten a wide range of types such as Water, Dragon, and Ground once Hatterene breaks down Espathra’s checks. This core can be enabled further by setting up dual screens with Scream Tail. Indeedee and Gallade ease pressure from Ghost- and Dark-types, respectively, while the former's Psychic Surge can power up Hatterene's Psyshock, and the latter can check Steel-types for Hatterene thanks to its strong Fighting STAB attacks.</p> "

Draco Meteor and Shadow Ball are helpful against a variety of types lacking the necessary immunities and can be used to decimate types such as Dark, Flying, Fairy, and Ghost. Flamethrower roasts Steel-types such as Corviknight and Scizor without the risk of getting stalled by Pressure, and Thunderbolt nails Toxapex and Dondozo and cleans Water teams late-game.

Flower Trick enables Meowscarada to break through Defense boosted Pokemon such as Curse Dondozo, as well as Pokemon behind dual screens such as Flutter Mane. Play Rough provides the Fairy coverage that enables Meowscarada to threaten Fighting, Dragon, and Dark teams. U-turn is used to allow Meowscarada to pivot out against checks to it, such as Toxapex and Skeledirge, to bring in a teammate that can break through it, such as Breloom and Toedscruel, while also maintaining momentum.</p> <p>While Meowscarada is an effective cleaner, it cannot exactly break through certain Pokemon by itself. Choice Band Breloom is a great teammate for Meowscarada, as it can break through Meowscarada's checks such as Toxapex, Kingambit, and Clodsire. Meowscarada is also vulnerable to Pokemon with strong priority and revenge killers faster than it such as Breloom and Choice Scarf Flutter Mane. Defensive walls such as Amoonguss and Wo-Chien can switch into said priority attacks and revenge killing attempts for Meowscarada. Amoonguss in particular also removes Toxic Spikes, which can be useful for Meowscarada and its teammates. Brambleghast and Toedscruel provide entry hazard removal in Rapid Spin, while also setting up hazards of their own in Spikes. Abomasnow gives an important Ice neutrality to Grass teams, which in tandem with the Defense boost provided by Snow allows it to serve as an answer to Ice-type threats such as Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur. Swords Dance Iron Leaves and Rotom-C provide counterplay to Corviknight that Grass teams otherwise lack, with the former appreciating Meowscarada pivoting out to it when facing Poison-types such as Dragalge and Toxapex, threatening Poison teams in general with its Psychic-type STAB moves and Fighting-type coverage attacks, while the latter forms a pivoting core with Meowscarada.</p> "

Torkoal pairs well with Skeledirge due to its ability to both remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin and set them up, all while also powering up Skeledirge's Torch Song.

Its ability to scare out many common threats such as Espathra, Chien-Pao, and Dragapult is highly valuable. Lokix struggles to break past many physically defensive walls like Quagsire, Dondozo, and Corviknight; however, it can pivot in teammates—such as Vivillon and Volcarona—that can beat them. A Choice Band with an Adamant nature maximizes Lokix's damage output and can utilise Axe Kick to lure and defeat Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. Alternatively, Life Orb avoids a Choice lock and makes use of Sucker Punch to pick off threats that First Impression alone cannot such as Gholdengo and Flutter Mane. Throat Chop lets Lokix deal good unresisted STAB damage and prevents Skeledirge from using Torch Song, which is extremely valuable and one of the reasons Lokix is a necessity for Bug teams.</p> <p>Lokix is highly susceptible to entry hazards and is often not quite strong enough to OHKO many Pokemon. Forretress is a great entry hazard remover and entry hazard setter, fixing both of those issues. Forretress also has a good defensive profile, acting as a sponge for absorbing damage, and it can even form a VoltTurn core with Lokix. Scizor removes Fairy-types that threaten Lokix such as Hatterene and Iron Valiant and allows Lokix to clean up after it has done enough damage. Volcarona takes care of Steel-types that don't fall to Axe Kick such as Corviknight and Scizor. Lokix can remove Ghost-types—such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Flutter Mane—to enable Slither Wing and Heracross, letting them spam their powerful Fighting-type moves and clean up after Lokix. Frosmoth can deal with many bulky Ground-types—such as Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu—and Vivillon improves the Fighting-type matchup by beating Great Tusk, Gallade, and Paldean Tauros-W and can answer Dondozo with the combination of Sleep Powder and Energy Ball. Masquerain can set up Sticky Web, which gives Lokix an amazing Speed advantage versus Iron Treads, Iron Moth, and Walking Wake, making Life Orb Lokix immensely threatening.</p> "

Thunderbolt is a fine substitute on Flying teams that do not utilize rain. Volt Switch allows Kilowattrel to pivot, making use of Kilowattrel's high Speed tier to get off damage while not being Choice locked. Hurricane couples with the preceding moves to cover Kilowattrel's STAB combination, specifically hitting Ground-types such as Quagsire and Gastrodon. The last slot depends on whether rain is being taken advantage of: on rain teams, Weather Ball can be used to hit Ground-types such as Unaware Clodsire, while Air Slash is another option for non-rain teams that can make up for Hurricane's lower accuracy. Choice Specs allows Kilowattrel to hit extremely hard, letting it OHKO Pokemon such as Azumarill with Volt Switch and Amoonguss with Hurricane. Volt Absorb provides the only Electric immunity for Flying-type teams.</p> <p>Corviknight is one of Kilowattrel's greatest assets; beyond providing a neutral switch-in to Ice-type attacks—especially in the cases of Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Greninja—Corviknight provides a physical wall that Kilowattrel can pivot into.

Talonflame is another defensive supporter, covering Kilowattrel's weakness to Ice-types and offering another Defogger. Dragonite hits the specially defensive walls that Kilowattrel struggles with such as Clodsire and Blissey. Gyarados finds great support from Kilowattrel; as Kilowattrel punches holes in defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Toxapex, Gyarados will have a better chance to sweep late-game. While Kilowattrel has excellent Speed itself, Choice Scarf users such as Flamigo and Salamence can revenge kill Pokemon such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane that outspeed Kilowattrel.

Iron Leaves also beats bulky Ground-types like Ting-Lu, which could phaze Espathra with Whirlwind, or Clodsire and Quagsire, both of which would require a lot of boosts to break with Stored Power. Indeedee is a Ghost-type switch-in and sets up Psychic Terrain for Espathra, protecting it from priority attacks like Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch. Indeedee is also able to Healing Wish to give Espathra a second chance to sweep. Stored Power Armarouge forms a dangerous core with Espathra, which can break for Espathra, clean after it, and also beat Steel teams. Hatterene bounces back entry hazards for Espathra if it forgoes Heavy-Duty Boots while also beating Dark- and Dragon-types. Chilly Reception Slowking can pivot to Espathra safely while acting as a sponge for hits.</p> "

Dondozo faces competition from Quagsire as the team's Unaware user, as Quagsire has an immunity to Electric-type attacks and can stack entry hazards; however, it drops to Grass-type attacks. Curse allows Dondozo to apply offensive pressure, boosting its attack and allowing it to better hit targets such as Baxcalibur and Kingambit while also allowing it to better tank hits in return. Rest allows Dondozo to shrug off status and gives it longevity, allowing it to constantly absorb powerful attacks for Water teams, such as Great Tusk's Headlong Rush. Sleep Talk enables Dondozo to further take advantage of Rest, allowing it to continue to setup or attack its target while asleep. Dondozo takes advantage of its STAB through the use of Waterfall, doing more damage, but Avalanche allows Dondozo to OHKO Meowscarada, as well as pressure Water-immune Pokemon such as Clodsire and Gastrodon. Its EV spread allows Dondozo to tank attacks from Gholdengo and Flutter Mane, due to its already high physical defense, which may be further boosted by Curse.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja is an insane wallbreaker, with coverage allowing it to take on a variety of Pokemon such as an opposing Dondozo or Ting-Lu with Grass Knot, Garchomp with Ice Beam, Amoonguss and Clodsire with Extrasensory, and Espathra with Dark Pulse. Toxapex absorbs Toxic Spikes for Dondozo, spreads Toxic, and shrugs off Grass-type attacks such as Flower Trick from Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Grass Knot from Greninja. Gastrodon provides an Electric immunity and it can tank attacks from special attackers such as Flutter Mane; however, it needs to be wary of Energy Ball. Gastrodon can also stack Spikes or set Stealth Rock, wearing down foes for Dondozo. The defensive core of Dondozo, Toxapex, and Gastrodon also gives Water teams opportunities to scout powerful attacks by allowing for each to switch-in for another, such as Dondozo switching in for Gastrodon or Toxapex to tank Chien-Pao's Crunch. Earthquake also allows it to take on Poison- and Electric-type Pokemon such as Clodsire and Sandy Shocks. Quaquaval can remove hazards with Rapid Spin for Dondozo and offensive Quaquaval sets can take on common threats to Water teams such as Greninja after one Aqua Step or Meowscarada after two.</p> "

Making up for its lack of Speed, Sucker Punch fits perfectly on Kingambit.

Kowtow Cleave is a reliable heavy-hitting STAB attack, and Iron Head hits Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Azumarill. Supreme Overlord is one of Kingambit's main selling points, allowing it to 2HKO Specially Defensive Corviknight and almost always 2HKO Quagsire after Stealth Rock.

Sucker Punch can allow Kingambit to defeat threats like Barraskewda and Flutter Mane, which can massively threaten Steel teams. Iron Head damages Pokemon that don't mind Sucker Punch or Kowtow Cleave, such as Ting-Lu or Azumarill.

Goldengo is an excellent partner to freely switch into Fighting-type moves and Will-O-Wisp. Corviknight serves as a potent check to Chien-Pao and clears entry hazards to increase Kingambit's longevity, Magnezone breaks through bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Dondozo, and it preserves momentum through Volt Switch. Iron Treads serves as another hazard clearer, can set up Stealth Rock to chip any walls Kingambit wants to break through, and can serve as speed control with a Choice Scarf. Klefki sets up dual screens, which allow Kingambit to use Swords Dance far more easily. Tinkaton can wall any Fairy-type moves meant to chip or finish off Kingambit, such as Flutter Mane's Moonblast, and KO many of their users with Gigaton Hammer.

Knock Off provides good team support by getting rid of the foe's item, such as Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from the likes of Dragonite, Volcarona, and Garchomp, whereas Volt Switch allows Iron Treads to pivot out of Pokemon that wall it such as Corviknight and Dondozo.</p> <p>Corviknight is a fantastic partner for Iron Treads, as it can take Fighting- and Ground-type moves while Iron Treads takes on Electric-types such as Iron Hands and Magnezone for Corviknight. Corviknight can also keep entry hazards off the field with Defog, aiding in Iron Treads's longevity and letting it forgo Rapid Spin. Gholdengo is another great partner, as it not only also helps against Fighting-types that Corviknight can't handle such as Iron Valiant, but it also overwhelms physical walls such as Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Dondozo. Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Tinkaton, Orthworm, and Bronzong also aid in Iron Treads sweeping. Tinkaton specifically ensures Stealth Rock being set due to Mold Breaker while having a decent offensive presence thanks to Gigaton Hammer being so powerful. Orthworm provides a Ground immunity, easing pressure off other teammates such as Corviknight, all while also having Spikes and Stealth Rock. Bronzong can not only set up Stealth Rock, but it can also take on Fire-type moves that are aimed at Iron Treads. Kingambit is a great mid- to late-game sweeper that appreciates Iron Treads's ability to punch holes early game or clean up after Kingambit has punched holes itself, providing the team with multiple avenues of winning.</p> "

It is bulky enough to respond to the strongest special attackers in the tier, such as Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, Greninja, and Iron Moth. Drain Punch provides much needed recovery while using Assault Vest while Thunder Punch is used instead of Wild Charge to avoid chip damage. Heavy Slam hits Fairy-types like Hatterene and allows it to revenge kill Flutter Mane. Despite these strengths, Iron Hands is unable to freely switch in on Flutter Mane and Greninja, as they often run Choice Specs and heavily damage Iron Hands or 2HKO it altogether. Volt Switch allows Iron Hands to keep momentum when it forces switches, allowing it to pivot on physically bulky switch-ins like Skeledirge and Amoonguss. Earthquake is a strong coverage option that hits Poison-types like Clodsire and Iron Moth. Rock Slide is an alternative option to hit Kilowattrel and deal with Volcarona without risking a burn from Flame Body.</p> <p>Great Tusk appreciates Iron Hands's ability to tank neutral special hits like Water-type attacks from Greninja and Pelipper and force them out. In return, Great Tusk takes Ground-type attacks from opposing Great Tusk and Ting-Lu. Furthermore, Great Tusk removes Ting-Lu's Spikes and Clodsire's Toxic Spikes, which cut into Iron Hands's longevity. Breloom and Gallade assist Iron Hands with the Ground and Psychic matchups, respectively, threatening foes like Quagsire and Gastrodon for the former, and Amoonguss and Clodsire for the latter. Breloom appreciates Iron Hands switching into Fire-type attacks from Volcarona and forcing Flying-types like Iron Jugulis to switch. Iron Valiant appreciates Iron Hands's slow Volt Switch, allowing Iron Valiant to switch in freely against opposing Fighting teams. Iron Valiant also threatens common physically defensive Pokemon like Dondozo, Skeledirge, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. Choice Scarf users such as Quaquaval and Paldean Tauros-F check threats to Iron Hands like Choice Specs Greninja and Flutter Mane, while Iron Hands handles defensive checks such as Calm Mind Hatterene with Heavy Slam in return.</p> "

Additionally, Baxcalibur's neutrality to Ice-type attacks allows it to combat Chien-Pao lacking Fighting-type coverage and Ice Beam Greninja. Ice Shard allows Baxcalibur to use an Adamant nature to revenge kill weakened targets such as Choice Scarf Great Tusk, Dragapult, and Flutter Mane. Alternatively, Glaive Rush may be used instead to deal more damage to Chien-Pao and opposing Baxcalibur. Icicle Spear in conjunction with Loaded Dice is a potent combination, dealing enough damage to break past Quagsire and Corviknight with an Adamant nature. Icicle Crash is a great option instead, as it doesn't require an item to function well; however, it has a decreased Base Power. Earthquake is a great coverage move, allowing Baxcalibur to threaten Skeledirge, Kingambit, and Gholdengo.</p> <p>Baxcalibur is capable of switching into Will-O-Wisps from the likes of Sableye and Skeledirge with its ability Thermal Exchange, keeping other physical attackers like Dragonite, Garchomp, and Roaring Moon safe. Cyclizar is an exceptional teammate, as it uses Shed Tail to keep Baxcalibur safe from status ailments induced by Toxapex and Grimmsnarl as it sets up with Dragon Dance. Furthermore, Cyclizar removes entry hazards such as Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Dragapult is capable of outpacing threats like Choice Specs Flutter Mane and opposing Baxcalibur as well as pressuring Dondozo with Thunderbolt. Garchomp eases Baxcalibur's sweeping by setting entry hazards and phazing opposing Pokemon through Dragon Tail to rack up damage. Dragalge sets up Toxic Spikes and checks Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant thanks to its Fairy-type neutrality along with STAB Gunk Shot. Hydreigon threatens physical walls like Slowbro, Dondozo, and Toxapex by disabling their recovery options with Taunt and setting up on them using Nasty Plot. Walking Wake is a great faster teammate that relieves pressure off of Baxcalibur to check Chien-Pao.</p> "

Thermal Exchange lets it switch into and punish Will-O-Wisp users such as Rotom-W and Sableye and Fire-type moves from Ceruledge and Fire Spin Skuntank. Glaive Rush hits Rotom-W, Toxapex, Volcarona and Quaquaval, while Ice-type STAB moves let it threaten Meowscarada, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. Earthquake is a great option to hit Steel-types such as Gholdengo and Kingambit super effectively, while Ice Shard lets it pick off weakened Pokemon and Choice Scarf users such as Meowscarada, Flamigo, and Dragapult. An Adamant nature maximizes Baxcalibur's power while outspeeding Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao at +1; however, a Jolly nature outspeeds Gholdengo and Quaquaval and Speed ties Choice Scarf Great Tusk at +1.</p> <p>Baxcalibur appreciates teammates that can provide it with setup opportunities. Froslass can set Spikes and stop opposing hazards with Taunt, spread burns, and use Destiny Bond to KO opposing threats to Baxcalibur. Abomasnow provides Baxcalibur with snow's defense boost and Aurora Veil to help it set up while also checking Dondozo and Quagsire. Swords Dance Chien-Pao can break Skeledirge, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit and can pick off Pokemon that Baxcalibur has weakened with Ice Shard or Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Chien-Pao can effectively clean up the battle once Baxcalibur has dealt significant damage. Avalugg and Cloyster can both remove hazards for Baxcalibur in case its Heavy-Duty Boots have been removed. Cloyster can also clean up after Baxcalibur with Shell Smash, while Avalugg can beat Kingambit, Iron Treads, and more with Iron Defense + Body Press if Baxcalibur forgoes Earthquake. Cryogonal's combination of Freeze-Dry and Rapid Spin can help Baxcalibur deal with Quagsire while also removing entry hazards that Ice-type teams often struggle with.</p> "

Nasty Plot lets Gholdengo overwhelm walls such as Gastrodon and Amoonguss. Shadow Ball is a fantastic STAB move that has great neutral coverage and allows Gholdengo to threaten Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Gallade. Focus Blast hits Dark-types that resist Shadow Ball like Kingambit and Ting-Lu. A single Nasty Plot boost enables Gholdengo's Focus Blast to OHKO physically defensive Ting-Lu after a layer of Spikes. The last slot is extremely flexible; Make It Rain is a powerful STAB move that hits harder than Shadow Ball against Dark-types like Grimmsnarl and Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Azumarill. Substitute can be used instead to give Gholdengo some security against faster threats that can take it out such as Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, and Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Recover is also another option to keep Gholdengo healthy, since it can be worn down fairly easily. Good as Gold allows Gholdengo to switch into status-using Pokemon like Sableye and Grimmsnarl, allowing Gholdengo to set up on them. Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to switch into Pokemon like Great Tusk and Clodsire with ease as well as avoid Spikes as long as it stays intact. This allows Gholdengo to be a decent spinblocker as well.</p> <p>Kingambit is a fantastic partner, as it not only resists Dark-type moves directed at Gholdengo, but it also has STAB priority in Sucker Punch to threaten opposing Ghost-types that can take out Gholdengo such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane. Kingambit also appreciates Gholdengo's ability to take on Breloom so as to not be revenge killed. Scizor appreciates Gholdengo's ability to take care of physical walls, allowing it to clean up with STAB Bullet Punch. Scizor can also pivot into Gholdengo on physical walls such as Skeledirge, allowing Gholdengo to threaten the opposing Pokemon easier. Nasty Plot Lucario is another fantastic partner thanks to its ability to get rid of Dark-types for Gholdengo and pressure special walls. Choice Scarf Iron Treads also appreciates Gholdengo's ability to break physical walls such as opposing Corviknight and Great Tusk early-game so that it can sweep late-game. Dual screens support from Klefki allows Gholdengo to have an easier time setting up and potentially sweeping. Another good partner for Gholdengo is Corviknight, as it removes entry hazards while also providing a Ground immunity once Air Balloon is gone. Corviknight can also run a Bulk Up or Iron Defense set that appreciates Pokemon like Skeledirge being taken care of while helping Gholdengo have an easier time breaking stall. Orthworm is another good choice, as it provides Shed Tail support as well as having access to Spikes and Stealth Rock. Bronzong is also an amazing partner as well, as it can not only set up Stealth Rock, but it can also tank Fire-type moves thanks to Heatproof.</p> "

Make it Rain greatly weakens Dark- and Normal-types such as Hydreigon and Indeedee, and it OHKOes Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Chien-Pao. Shadow Ball lets Gholdengo clean types such as Psychic and Ghost late-game. Trick neutralizes defensive pivots such as Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, which typically switch into it. The last move of choice is dependent on what the Ghost team lacks; Focus Blast gives the team another way to defeat Choice Specs Greninja, Thunderbolt cleans Water- and Flying-teams, or Nasty Plot which turns Gholdengo into a massive threat against bulkier teams especially after their main specially defensive wall has been given a Choice Scarf with Trick.</p> <p>As Gholdengo provides the needed revenge killing capabilities on Ghost teams, teammates such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult are free to run sets like Choice Specs and Dragon Dance, respectively.
