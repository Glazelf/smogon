        "description": "<p>Thanks to a wide array of coverage options alongside Protean, Choice Specs Greninja is a devastating special wallbreaker that can dismantle several types, including Grass, Ground, Water, and Poison. Its naturally high Speed tier is invaluable to outpace and threaten fast foes such as Iron Valiant and Sandy Shocks. Aside from hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types like Bronzong and Gholdengo, Dark Pulse's lack of immunities makes it a spammable attack that can be used to muscle past neutral Pokemon such as Corviknight with flinches. Ice Beam covers a large portion of the metagame, including Dragon, Ground, Grass, and Flying teams, decimating prominent foes like Hydreigon, Clodsire, Amoonguss, and Iron Jugulis. It's also Greninja's hardest hitting attack against Skuntank, which is important in the Poison matchup. Extrasensory pressures Poison- and Fighting-types like Toxapex and Assault Vest Iron Hands and prevents Greninja from being picked off by Breloom's Mach Punch. Grass Knot rounds out its coverage, significantly damaging Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Water-types such as Gastrodon and Dondozo.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja appreciates being paired with other wallbreakers like Barraskewda and Quaquaval that can handle Normal and Steel teams. They break through bulky Pokemon like Blissey and Kingambit that Greninja struggles with; they are also potent late-game cleaners that enjoy Greninja's ability to threaten Storm Drain Gastrodon and their physically defensive checks like Amoonguss, Toxapex, Slowbro, and Dondozo. Moreover, Barraskewda under rain excels at tearing down fast offensive teams that Greninja can struggle with, as it can threaten out Meowscarada, boosted Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Iron Moth. Quaquaval can also run Rapid Spin to let Greninja enter the field multiple times to wallbreak without worry, preventing it from being chipped down into KO range of priority attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Baxcalibur's Ice Shard. Pivot support from Slowking is helpful to bring Greninja in safely on foes like Dragalge and Gastrodon, letting it fire off attacks freely. Defensive teammates such as Toxapex, Dondozo, Gastrodon, and Quagsire can switch into potential revenge killers like Meowscarada, Chien-Pao, Dragapult, and Slither Wing, respectively; notably, Gastrodon and Quagsire also provide entry hazards to take advantage of the countless switches that Greninja forces, putting the likes of Ting-Lu, Toxapex, and Assault Vest Iron Hands into Greninja's KO range, as well as switch into and check Electric-types such as Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks and Assault Vest Iron Hands.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Klefki is a popular choice for Fairy-type teams due to Prankster, dual screens, and Spikes. This set excels at enabling setup sweepers such as Mimikyu and Azumarill providing them with boosted bulk and chipping the opposing team thanks to Spikes. With maximum HP and Defense EVs and Foul Play, Klefki efficiently counters opposing Swords Dance and Dragon Dance sweepers such as Scizor and Dragonite. Alternatively, it can use Thunder Wave to cripple fast threats like Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant. Klefki’s Steel typing also provides a useful immunity against Poison-type teams and blocks Glimmora's Mortal Spin, ensuring that entry hazards remain on the opposing field.</p> <p>Belly Drum Azumarill is an excellent partner for Klefki, as the dual screens greatly facilitate setting up with Belly Drum and sweeping opposing teams. Additionally, Spikes provide some chip damage to ensure OHKOs on foes like Meowscarada. Choice Specs Flutter Mane can also take advantage of the chip damage from Klefki's Spikes to power through teams and more easily defeat walls such as Toxapex, Quagsire, and Amoonguss. Calm Mind Flutter Mane benefits both dual screens to set up and sweep and from Thunder Wave slowing down threats like Barraskewda. Iron Valiant appreciates Klefki slowing down faster foes like Flutter Mane, Cinderace, and Dragapult with Thunder Wave, allowing it to defeat them. Iron Valiant also provides a much-needed offensive pressure against Steel-types like Kingambit and works as a devastating offensive core when paired with Flutter Mane. Hatterene and Klefki form a strong defensive core, with the former’s Magic Bounce punishing any attempt from Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Forretress to set entry hazards, while the latter can come in on Poison-type moves, potentially forcing a switch on a Choice locked Pokemon like Greninja in the process. The additional bulk that Hatterene receives from the dual screens even allows it to take a stand against foes such as Glimmora, Clodsire, and Toxapex, preventing them from setting their hazards while countering them.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With its good bulk, Calm Mind, Magic Bounce, and secondary Fairy typing, Hatterene serves as a strong wincon versus types such as Dark and Dragon that otherwise threaten Psychic-type teams. Psyshock is Hatterene’s hardest-hitting move against special walls such as Dragalge and Clodsire. Draining Kiss provides useful coverage against Dark- and Dragon-types and meaningful recovery. Mystical Fire hits Steel-types that otherwise stonewall Hatterene, while Nuzzle supports its teammates by spreading paralysis. The EV spread outspeeds Toxapex which could otherwise clear Calm Mind boosts Hatterene with Haze.</p> <p>Hatterene struggles with breaking through Pokemon that can handle its STAB attacks and coverage, with Steel-types being a notable example. Because of this, Armarouge is a wonderful partner for Hatterene, as it can pressure the aforementioned Steel-types while also not having to worry about entry hazards due to Hatterene's Magic Bounce. Espathra forms a strong offensive core with Hatterene that can threaten a wide range of types such as Water, Dragon, and Ground once Hatterene breaks down Espathra’s checks. This core can be enabled further by setting up dual screens with Scream Tail. Indeedee and Gallade ease pressure from Ghost- and Dark-types, respectively, while the former's Psychic Surge can power up Hatterene's Psyshock, and the latter can check Steel-types for Hatterene thanks to its strong Fighting STAB attacks.</p> "

        "description": "<p>As the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the Monotype metagame, Choice Specs Dragapult is an excellent offensive threat that deals with Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Greninja for Dragon teams. Draco Meteor and Shadow Ball are helpful against a variety of types lacking the necessary immunities and can be used to decimate types such as Dark, Flying, Fairy, and Ghost. Flamethrower roasts Steel-types such as Corviknight and Scizor without the risk of getting stalled by Pressure, and Thunderbolt nails Toxapex and Dondozo and cleans Water teams late-game. Alternatively, U-turn brings in team mates like Baxcalibur, Garchomp, and Hydreigon, which take advantage of common switch-ins such as Ting Lu, Clodsire, and Kingambit. Infiltrator lets Dragapult bypass dual screens, which is sorely needed to properly deal with Flutter Mane.</p> <p>Since Dragapult excels at cleaning teams with its natural speed, wallbreakers like Nasty Plot Hydreigon, Baxcalibur, and Choice Band Haxorus, as well as entry hazard setters such as Garchomp and Dragalge are excellent teammates. Dragonite loves Dragapult's ability to wear down or outright remove Steel-, Water-, and Ghost-types such as Klefki, Toxapex, and Skeledirge, allowing it to clean up types such as Fairy, Water, and Fire with a Dragon Dance or Choice Band set. Choice Scarf users like Baxcalibur, Hydreigon, and Roaring Moon are appreciated, as these deal with opposing Choice Scarf users such as Gallade and Gholdengo, which revenge kill Dragapult with ease.

With Will-O-Wisp and Unaware, it can check physical set-up sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragonite or Belly Drum Azumarill that threaten Fire. Additionally, Torch Song lets Skeledirge fire back against these threats while raising its Special Attack and reducing passitivity. Hex pairs incredibly well with Will-O-Wisp, as it threatens large amounts of damage on burned foes, while Shadow Ball is a more consistent STAB option that hits opposing Skeledirge for more immediate damage. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Skeledirge avoid entry hazards chipping away at it whenever it switches in.</p> <p>Volcarona is a great teammate for Skeledirge, as it can threaten Dark-types that annoy Skeledirge such as Ting-Lu and Kingambit. In return, Skeledirge can burn physical attackers, like Dragonite, giving Volcarona more setup opportunities. Paldean Tauros-F is also a good teammate, since it can threaten the aforementioned Dark-types with its Fighting STAB while also having Intimidate to help neutralize physical attackers that Skeledirge cannot handle on its own, such as Roaring Moon. Additionally, its Choice Scarf set can outspeed and KO Greninja. Torkoal pairs well with Skeledirge due to its ability to both remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin and set them up, all while also powering up Skeledirge's Torch Song. Cinderace is a fairly good partner as well due to High Jump Kick, letting it remove Dark-types aiming to threaten Skeledirge, while also being able to remove entry hazards with Court Change and hit Poison-types such as Clodsire and Toxapex with Zen Headbutt. Scovillain is a good partner, since it can remove Water-types such as Dondozo and Rotom-W with its Grass STAB.

Dondozo faces competition from Quagsire as the team's Unaware user, as Quagsire has an immunity to Electric-type attacks and can stack entry hazards; however, it drops to Grass-type attacks. Curse allows Dondozo to apply offensive pressure, boosting its attack and allowing it to better hit targets such as Baxcalibur and Kingambit while also allowing it to better tank hits in return. Rest allows Dondozo to shrug off status and gives it longevity, allowing it to constantly absorb powerful attacks for Water teams, such as Great Tusk's Headlong Rush. Sleep Talk enables Dondozo to further take advantage of Rest, allowing it to continue to setup or attack its target while asleep. Dondozo takes advantage of its STAB through the use of Waterfall, doing more damage, but Avalanche allows Dondozo to OHKO Meowscarada, as well as pressure Water-immune Pokemon such as Clodsire and Gastrodon. Its EV spread allows Dondozo to tank attacks from Gholdengo and Flutter Mane, due to its already high physical defense, which may be further boosted by Curse.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja is an insane wallbreaker, with coverage allowing it to take on a variety of Pokemon such as an opposing Dondozo or Ting-Lu with Grass Knot, Garchomp with Ice Beam, Amoonguss and Clodsire with Extrasensory, and Espathra with Dark Pulse. Toxapex absorbs Toxic Spikes for Dondozo, spreads Toxic, and shrugs off Grass-type attacks such as Flower Trick from Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Grass Knot from Greninja. Gastrodon provides an Electric immunity and it can tank attacks from special attackers such as Flutter Mane; however, it needs to be wary of Energy Ball. Gastrodon can also stack Spikes or set Stealth Rock, wearing down foes for Dondozo. The defensive core of Dondozo, Toxapex, and Gastrodon also gives Water teams opportunities to scout powerful attacks by allowing for each to switch-in for another, such as Dondozo switching in for Gastrodon or Toxapex to tank Chien-Pao's Crunch. Earthquake also allows it to take on Poison- and Electric-type Pokemon such as Clodsire and Sandy Shocks. Quaquaval can remove hazards with Rapid Spin for Dondozo and offensive Quaquaval sets can take on common threats to Water teams such as Greninja after one Aqua Step or Meowscarada after two.</p> "

Poison Jab hits threats like Meowscarada, Rotom-C, and Iron Valiant, while Gunk Shot provides more power against bulkier foes such as Hatterene and Azumarill. Toxic Spike eases the Dark and Fairy matchups due to their lack of entry hazard removal and applies pressure on teams in general, completing Ground's entry hazard stacking core. Toxic may be used instead to punish Pokemon like Rotom-W and Hydreigon, which freely switch-in to Clodsire otherwise. The given EV spread avoids the 2HKO from both Choice Scarf Greninja's Ice Beam and Choice Scarf Meowscarada's Flower Trick.</p> <p>Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Ting-Lu appreciate Clodsire checking the aforementioned Water-types as well as other threats such as Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane. In return, Choice Scarf Great Tusk pressures Ice- and Dark-types like Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Choice Specs Greninja. Iron Treads clears entry hazards and threatens Hatterene, and Ting-Lu sets up entry hazards and switches into Psychic-type attacks from Espathra and Indeedee. Unaware Clodsire synergizes very well with Gastrodon, as it checks the aforementioned Grass-types, while Gastrodon switches into Water-type attacks from Dondozo and Barraskewda. Sandy Shocks threatens Flying-types like Corviknight and Pelipper and secures the Fire matchup. Quagsire pairs well with Water Absorb Clodsire, as it checks Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Great Tusk.

Skuntank is a Psychic-immune teammate that switches into Hatterene, Espathra, and Indeedee, and it can set Toxic Spikes better against types like Fairy and Psychic by trapping switch-ins such as Klefki and Bronzong with Fire Spin. Glimmora provides entry hazard support and removal with Stealth Rock and Mortal Spin, respectively, and it can run Air Balloon or Choice Scarf to handle Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads due to its great coverage. Glimmora can also run Corrosion with Toxic and Mortal Spin, improving the Poison matchup and putting defensive Pokemon such as opposing Clodsire and Amoongus on a timer. Iron Moth is another plausible Choice Scarf user, as it handles Steel- and Dragon-types like Iron Treads and Baxcalibur, though it can also run a set with Substitute to handle Kingambit and break down types such as Flying and Water better.</p> "

Lastly, Great Tusk provides Stealth Rock support for the team, which helps to break Focus Sash on Breloom. Heavy-Duty Boots is the premier choice, as it allows Great Tusk to spin away hazards without being poisoned by Toxic Spikes or worn down by Spikes.

Flutter Mane can run Power Gem to pressure Fire teams, OHKOing foes like Volcarona and Torkoal, and it also benefits from Protosynthesis allowing it to outspeed Scovillain under the sun. Additionally, Flutter Mane usually goes with either Thunderbolt or Energy Ball.

Flutter Mane can handle Psychic-type foes such as Espathra and Hatterene, while Iron Valiant takes care of Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. Flutter Mane can fall back on either Hatterene or Tinkaton when faced with an unfavorable matchup. Both of these Pokemon provide dependable defensive options and some type of entry hazard control, but Hatterene is particularly useful due to it breaking down walls like Dondozo and Clodsire. Flutter Mane also pairs well with setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Mimikyu, as it is able to poke holes in the opponent's team, allowing them to clean late-game. In return, Azumarill can take care of priority users, such as Ceruledge and Chien-Pao. In terms of support options, Flutter Mane can rely on Fairy's Prankster users, Klefki and Grimmsnarl, to set up dual screens, therefore allowing it to withstand hits such as Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Gholdengo's Make It Rain. Grimmsnarl can then bring in Flutter Mane relatively safely thanks to Parting Shot. Klefki's Spikes and Tinkaton's Stealth Rocks also support Flutter Mane in breaking its checks such as Iron Hands and Ting Lu.

An Adamant nature maximizes Baxcalibur's power while outspeeding Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao at +1; however, a Jolly nature outspeeds Gholdengo and Quaquaval and Speed ties Choice Scarf Great Tusk at +1.</p> <p>Baxcalibur appreciates teammates that can provide it with setup opportunities. Froslass can set Spikes and stop opposing hazards with Taunt, spread burns, and use Destiny Bond to KO opposing threats to Baxcalibur. Abomasnow provides Baxcalibur with snow's defense boost and Aurora Veil to help it set up while also checking Dondozo and Quagsire. Swords Dance Chien-Pao can break Skeledirge, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit and can pick off Pokemon that Baxcalibur has weakened with Ice Shard or Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Chien-Pao can effectively clean up the battle once Baxcalibur has dealt significant damage. Avalugg and Cloyster can both remove hazards for Baxcalibur in case its Heavy-Duty Boots have been removed. Cloyster can also clean up after Baxcalibur with Shell Smash, while Avalugg can beat Kingambit, Iron Treads, and more with Iron Defense + Body Press if Baxcalibur forgoes Earthquake. Cryogonal's combination of Freeze-Dry and Rapid Spin can help Baxcalibur deal with Quagsire while also removing entry hazards that Ice-type teams often struggle with.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Boasting an impressive Special Attack stat, Gholdengo provides Steel teams with a fantastic special attacker, which are scarce on said type. Nasty Plot lets Gholdengo overwhelm walls such as Gastrodon and Amoonguss. Shadow Ball is a fantastic STAB move that has great neutral coverage and allows Gholdengo to threaten Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Gallade. Focus Blast hits Dark-types that resist Shadow Ball like Kingambit and Ting-Lu. A single Nasty Plot boost enables Gholdengo's Focus Blast to OHKO physically defensive Ting-Lu after a layer of Spikes. The last slot is extremely flexible; Make It Rain is a powerful STAB move that hits harder than Shadow Ball against Dark-types like Grimmsnarl and Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Azumarill. Substitute can be used instead to give Gholdengo some security against faster threats that can take it out such as Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, and Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Recover is also another option to keep Gholdengo healthy, since it can be worn down fairly easily. Good as Gold allows Gholdengo to switch into status-using Pokemon like Sableye and Grimmsnarl, allowing Gholdengo to set up on them. Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to switch into Pokemon like Great Tusk and Clodsire with ease as well as avoid Spikes as long as it stays intact. This allows Gholdengo to be a decent spinblocker as well.</p> <p>Kingambit is a fantastic partner, as it not only resists Dark-type moves directed at Gholdengo, but it also has STAB priority in Sucker Punch to threaten opposing Ghost-types that can take out Gholdengo such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane. Kingambit also appreciates Gholdengo's ability to take on Breloom so as to not be revenge killed. Scizor appreciates Gholdengo's ability to take care of physical walls, allowing it to clean up with STAB Bullet Punch. Scizor can also pivot into Gholdengo on physical walls such as Skeledirge, allowing Gholdengo to threaten the opposing Pokemon easier. Nasty Plot Lucario is another fantastic partner thanks to its ability to get rid of Dark-types for Gholdengo and pressure special walls. Choice Scarf Iron Treads also appreciates Gholdengo's ability to break physical walls such as opposing Corviknight and Great Tusk early-game so that it can sweep late-game. Dual screens support from Klefki allows Gholdengo to have an easier time setting up and potentially sweeping. Another good partner for Gholdengo is Corviknight, as it removes entry hazards while also providing a Ground immunity once Air Balloon is gone. Corviknight can also run a Bulk Up or Iron Defense set that appreciates Pokemon like Skeledirge being taken care of while helping Gholdengo have an easier time breaking stall. Orthworm is another good choice, as it provides Shed Tail support as well as having access to Spikes and Stealth Rock. Bronzong is also an amazing partner as well, as it can not only set up Stealth Rock, but it can also tank Fire-type moves thanks to Heatproof.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Gholdengo's ability to revenge kill threats such as Flutter Mane, Chien-Pao lacking Sucker Punch, and Dragapult, come into status-spreading Pokemon such as Klefki and Breloom due to Good as Gold, and inconvenience bulkier teams by preventing all forms of entry hazard removal with its ability and typing make it a prime pick for Ghost teams. Make it Rain greatly weakens Dark- and Normal-types such as Hydreigon and Indeedee, and it OHKOes Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Chien-Pao. Shadow Ball lets Gholdengo clean types such as Psychic and Ghost late-game. Trick neutralizes defensive pivots such as Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, which typically switch into it. The last move of choice is dependent on what the Ghost team lacks; Focus Blast gives the team another way to defeat Choice Specs Greninja, Thunderbolt cleans Water- and Flying-teams, or Nasty Plot which turns Gholdengo into a massive threat against bulkier teams especially after their main specially defensive wall has been given a Choice Scarf with Trick.</p> <p>As Gholdengo provides the needed revenge killing capabilities on Ghost teams, teammates such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult are free to run sets like Choice Specs and Dragon Dance, respectively. Both also break down walls such as Clodsire and Gastrodon; in return, Gholdengo deals with Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Gallade. Skeledirge walls most physical attackers and Fire-types such as Scovillain and Volcarona. Mimikyu provides a safety net against offensive types like rain Water and Ghost, checking Barraskewda and Choice Scarf Flutter Mane for the team, and it loves Gholdengo shutting down defensive walls such as Toxapex with Trick. Entry hazard setters in Brambleghast and Froslass are is also greatly appreciated, as they can set, remove, or prevent entry hazards for Gholdengo; in return, Gholdengo prevents their entry hazards from getting removed by Glimmora. Brambleghast also switches into Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk and deals with Water-types like Gastrodon and Dondozo, while Froslass can spread paralysis with Thunder Wave and bring down an opposing Pokemon with its Destiny Bond.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Chien-Pao is an imposing force for any Dark team with its sky high Speed, blitzing past threats like Iron Valiant and Greninja, and great Attack. Sword of Ruin lets it beat physical walls like Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Toxapex, though it doesn't have great bulk and has to watch out for super effective priority moves from Scizor, Lokix, and Slither Wing and struggles to break past walls like Dondozo and Quagsire. With Swords Dance, it can boost up to beat even the likes of Corviknight and Toxapex if it has Crunch. Fighting-type coverage picks off Dark-types like Kingambit and Greninja. Sacred Sword picks off weakened Garganacl, while Brick Break destroys opposing Dark or Fairy team's dual screens. Ice Shard stops common revenge killers like Choice Scarf Meowscarada, Flutter Mane, and Great Tusk.</p> <p>As Chien-Pao focuses on breaking down foes with its sheer power and Speed, it appreciates support from its teammates. Ting-Lu can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes while Skuntank can set up Toxic Spikes and pressure Fairy-types, all of which make wallbreaking for Chien-Pao easier. Grimmsnarl provides Chien-Pao with dual screens support, making setting up easier. Sableye can burn opposing Pokemon and cripple them with Taunt and Knock Off, removing Heavy-Duty Boots and making foes susceptible to hazards, while also acting as a Fighting-type move switch-in. Choice Specs Greninja can clean up after Chien-Pao has done enough damage while also countering Fire-types that would annoy Chien-Pao such as Skeledirge and Cinderace if Chien-Pao does not have Crunch. Hydreigon can break Steel-types for Chien-Pao if it foregoes Fighting-type coverage or Swords Dance, beating Fighting-neutral Steel-types like Corviknight and Scizor. Choice Scarf Meowscarada is able to threaten Pokemon that counter Chien-Pao such as Quaquaval and Choice Scarf users such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Great Tusk, while also being able to pivot to Chien-Pao with U-Turn.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Ting-Lu is a fantastic asset for Dark teams due to its access to entry hazards and great bulk, supported further by Vessel of Ruin weakening special attackers such as Iron Valiant and Hatterene. Earthquake is a reliable STAB move that hits most of the metagame for decent damage while also scaring Clodsire out and preventing it from setting Toxic Spikes. Heavy Slam hits Fairy-types that would otherwise overpower Ting-Lu, such as Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, while also threatening Hatterene trying to bounce back hazards. Stealth Rock and Spikes allow Ting-Lu to support wallbreakers such as Meowscarada or Greninja. Whirlwind allows Ting-Lu to phase out setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Curse Dondozo and rack up entry hazard damage, while Ruination provides consistent damage against other walls such as Amoonguss and Corviknight that don't mind any of Ting-Lu's other moves.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Meowscarada, Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Greninja all appreciate Ting-Lu's ability to set entry hazards, as they wear down common defensive answers such as Toxapex, Iron Treads, and Dondozo. In return, they can scare out threats to Ting-Lu; Meowscarada can deal with Greninja, Chien-Pao and Greninja can threaten Great Tusk, and Kingambit can force out Fairy-types such as Hatterene. Skuntank is a good partner as well, since it offers a crucial neutrality to Fairy, threatens Fairy-types, and sets and clears Toxic Spikes, augmenting Ting-Lu's entry hazards and improving its longevity. Additionally, Skuntank can utilize Fire Spin to further chip down teams and trap Klefki, improving Ting-Lu's matchup against Fairy. In return, Ting-Lu can assist in Ground matchups through its bulk. Sableye is also a great partner due to its Fighting immunity, taking attacks Ting-Lu can't such as Great Tusk's and Iron Hands's Close Combat.</p> "
