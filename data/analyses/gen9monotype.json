        "description": "<p>Alolan Sandslash provides valuable role compression for fast-paced Ice teams. It offers not only entry hazard removal, a Toxic immunity, and a resistance to Fairy but also speed control thanks to Slush Rush. Under snow, it notably outpaces and threatens Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, Dragapult, Spectrier, and +1 Baxcalibur, as well as Choice Scarf users such as Hisuian Arcanine and Gholdengo. Slush Rush finds further use in facilitating Alolan Sandslash's entry hazard removal, as it can spin on forced switches against foes such as Flutter Mane, and even if it is being sacrificed, it can generally get a Rapid Spin off before it is KOed. Iron Head is Alolan Sandslash’s primary attacking move, proving especially deadly to Flutter Mane, Hatterene, Alolan Ninetales, and Air Balloon Glimmora. Earthquake allows Alolan Sandslash to offensively pressure Toxapex, and it also smacks targets such as Heatran, Sneasler, and Hisuian Arcanine. Knock Off is valuable for menacing spinblockers such as Dragapult, Hisuian Zoroark, and Gholdengo; it also creates permanent progress by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Toxapex, opening them up to hazard damage.</p> <p>Alolan Ninetales is an essential partner to Alolan Sandslash, not only setting snow to shore up Alolan Sandslash’s Defense and allowing it to take advantage of Slush Rush but also putting up Aurora Veil to allow Alolan Sandslash to easily enter the field. Moreover, Alolan Ninetales handles the Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R and Great Tusk that Alolan Sandslash is extremely weak to. With a Nasty Plot + Encore set, Alolan Ninetales can also take advantage of and remove Dondozo, Toxapex, Calm Mind Clefable, and Iron Defense Corviknight. Baxcalibur makes an excellent pairing with Alolan Sandslash, greatly appreciating Alolan Sandslash eliminating targets such as Flutter Mane and Alolan Ninetales and removing entry hazards to allow it to sweep unimpeded. Choice Band Chien-Pao is another teammate that appreciates Alolan Sandslash pressuring Fairy-types, clearing entry hazards, and generally softening up the opposing team so it can avoid being chipped down over the course of a game and easily clean. In exchange, Chien-Pao can threaten Corviknight and Kingambit. Froslass absorbs Fighting-type moves for Alolan Sandslash and enjoys it removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Toxapex, Quagsire, and Empoleon via Knock Off, rendering them vulnerable to Froslass’s Spikes. Smack Down Mamoswine similarly appreciates Alolan Sandslash’s Knock Off with regard to its Stealth Rock and can take out Corviknight, which otherwise walls Alolan Sandslash. Frosmoth values Alolan Sandslash bringing down Articuno and Flutter Mane, while in return threatening the pesky Quagsire, Great Tusk, and Ursaluna-B. Cetitan and Cloyster are other examples of Ice-type sweepers that massively benefit from Alolan Sandslash clearing entry hazards prior to their setup.</p>"

Clefable can use a combination of Unaware and Heavy-Duty Boots to bluff Magic Guard as well as beat other setup sweepers like Volcarona, Ursaluna-B, and Azumarill. However, this leaves Clefable vulnerable to Toxic from Pokemon like Toxapex and Clodsire.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Boasting a great ability and various coverage options, Clefable cements itself as a great bulky setup sweeper on Fairy teams, threatening hard-to-beat Pokemon like Corviknight, Toxapex, and Empoleon. Moonblast provides a reliable and powerful STAB move that hits neutral targets such as Gastrodon, Mamoswine, and Ogerpon-W. Alternatively, Ice Beam may be used to hit Ground- and Flying-type Pokemon like Clodsire, Zapdos, Ursaluna-B, and Gliscor. Thunderbolt threatens the aforementioned Corviknight, Toxapex, and Empoleon as well as Basculegion-F, Moltres, and Manaphy. Flamethrower may be used to hit Steel-types such as Iron Treads, Corviknight, and Scizor; it should also be noted that Clefable survives a Bullet Punch from Choice Band Scizor and OHKOes it back. Magic Guard notably offers Clefable an extremely valuable immunity to entry hazards due to the Fairy type's lack of entry hazard removal, in addition to negating Toxic from Toxapex, Gliscor, and Clodsire and letting Clefable use Life Orb without recoil, enhancing its setup ability. Furthermore, Magic Guard allows Clefable to combat Alolan Muk more effectively, and Life Orb enables valuable damage rolls like 2HKOing Toxapex with unboosted Thunderbolt, 2HKOing Assault Vest Iron Hands using Moonblast after a Calm Mind, OHKOing Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao with Calm Mind-boosted Thunderbolt and Moonblast, respectively, and applying additional pressure on Quagsire. Leftovers is the preferred item, however, due to Moonlight's limited recovery and Clefable's mediocre bulk. The given EV spread allows Clefable to outpace Corviknight and maximizes its physical bulk, lessening the chance of Clefable being revenge killed once set up, notably letting it take two Iron Heads from Corviknight.</p> <p>Iron Valiant is an excellent teammate due to its ability to remove Steel-types like Heatran, Hisuian Goodra, and Kingambit as well as beat Poison-types such as Okidogi and Clodsire using Psyshock. Iron Valiant also provides setup opportunities for Clefable via Trick, hindering walls like Gastrodon and Heavy Slam Ting-Lu. In return, Clefable wears down Flying-types like Corviknight, Moltres, and Gliscor as well as Poison-types such as Toxapex and Amoonguss. Klefki provides dual screens support to aid in Clefable's Calm Mind setup, deters setup sweepers such as Scizor and Ogerpon-W with Foul Play, and sets up Spikes to wear down foes like Alolan Muk. Azumarill is a major asset in the Ground, Fire, and Steel matchups, threatening Clodsire, Hisuian Arcanine, and Gholdengo as well as aiding in the Poison matchup by removing walls like Alolan Muk and Galarian Slowking. Flutter Mane aids in the Ghost matchup, taking out threats like Gholdengo and Ceruledge and eliminating threats such as Articuno and Volcarona with Power Gem and Okidogi and Clodsire with Psyshock. In return, Flutter Mane appreciates Clefable chipping down Toxapex, Gliscor, and specially defensive Corviknight. Hatterene takes on Poison-types such as Sneasler and Okidogi as well as threatening Gastrodon and Barraskewda via Giga Drain and can free up a moveslot for Clefable to use Thunderbolt if using Mystical Fire. Tinkaton offers a Poison-type immunity, Stealth Rock support, and the removal of roadblocks like Galarian Slowking, Articuno, Hatterene, and Alolan Muk. Furthermore, Tinkaton aids in Clefable's setup via Knock Off and Encore by taking away passive healing from Pokemon like Clodsire, Alolan Muk, and Iron Treads and locking walls into moves. Choice Scarf Enamorus provides a Ground-type immunity and various anti-Steel coverage options to combat Iron Treads, Kingambit, and Heatran as well as provides Healing Wish support to give Clefable more setup opportunities late-game.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Alolan Ninetales is a great support Pokemon for Ice teams thanks to its ability to set snow and Aurora Veil to make its team much harder to take down as well as facilitate its teammates' sweeping attempts with Encore. In addition, its typing and Speed tier lets it hit otherwise troublesome Fighting-types such as Kommo-o, Urshifu-R, and Great Tusk. Freeze-Dry is useful against Water teams, being able to threaten Pelipper and Quagsire out and win the weather war against rain. Moonblast is useful against the ubiquitous Fighting- and Dragon-types in the tier, as it hits Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Baxcalibur, and Kommo-o that are otherwise problems for Ice teams. Encore allows Alolan Ninetales to lock a defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex, into a weak move or a setup sweeper, such as Iron Defense Corviknight, into a stat-boosting move, letting Alolan Ninetales's teammates take care of the aforementioned Pokemon.</p> <p>Baxcalibur is an amazing teammate for Alolan Ninetales, as it is an incredibly dangerous sweeper that can run through teams after one Swords Dance or Dragon Dance, which is easily facilitated by Alolan Ninetales's snow and Aurora Veil. It also appreciates Alolan Ninetales giving it setup opportunities thanks to Encore and eliminating Quagsire thanks to Freeze-Dry. Alolan Ninetales appreciates Baxcalibur's ability to switch in on Fire-type moves and gain an Attack boost for itself, as well as run through Poison and Steel teams. Chien-Pao provides wallbreaking power or clean-up potential depending on its set while also hitting Steel-types such as Heatran, Kingambit, and Empoleon with a strong Sacred Sword. It appreciates Alolan Ninetales's ability to hit Fighting-types. Mamoswine can threaten Fire-types like Heatran and Torkoal with Earthquake, while packing Thick Fat for a pseudo-Fire neutrality. Additionally, it sets Stealth Rock, which can help Alolan Ninetales pick off weakened threats such as Baxcalibur. It also appreciates the bulk boost in snow. Cetitan is a great partner, as Slush Rush allows it to outspeed and OHKO most of the metagame after a Belly Drum boost, which is easier to acquire thanks to snow and Aurora Veil from Alolan Ninetales. Alolan Sandslash appreciates snow and Aurora Veil both bolstering its bulk and Slush Rush doubling its Speed. In exchange, Alolan Sandslash can use Rapid Spin to clear entry hazards and deal with Hatterene and Flutter Mane, which can both take advantage of Alolan Ninetales. It can also threaten Fire, Steel, and Poison teams with Earthquake. Cloyster brings a lot to the table: namely another Fire neutrality, a way to hit Fire-types such as Talonflame and Ceruledge thanks to Rock Blast and Water-type coverage, and a high Defense stat that makes it nearly unbreakable in snow. In return, Alolan Ninetales facilitates Cloyster's Shell Smash thanks to Aurora Veil and snow support. It also appreciates Alolan Ninetales locking defensive answers to Cloyster, such as Toxapex and Corviknight, into unfavorable moves. Avalugg is a defensive behemoth that, when under snow and Aurora Veil, takes on almost every physical attacker in the tier. It can also remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin to improve Alolan Ninetales's lacking longevity. Finally, Frosmoth becomes a dangerous sweeping threat under snow and Aurora Veil thanks to Quiver Dance, letting it potentially win the Ground, Flying, and Fairy matchups.</p>"

Notably, it lives all of Meowscarada's attacks and +2 Scizor's Bullet Punch. Rock Head allows Hisuian Arcanine to freely use Head Smash and Flare Blitz without their recoil damage. Head Smash is an immensely powerful move, enabling Hisuian Arcanine to 2HKO Toxapex and defensive Landorus-T after Intimidate. Flare Blitz threatens Amoonguss, Corviknight, and Toedscruel, while breaking through Steel teams in general with ease in conjunction with Close Combat. Close Combat provides coverage for Hisuian Goodra, Ursaluna, and Heatran, while also fighting off Dark-types such as Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and non-Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott. Extreme Speed allows Hisuian Arcanine to revenge kill faster opponents like weakened Greninja, Azumarill, and Breloom.</p> <p>Lycanroc-D appreciates Hisuian Arcanine threatening walls like Toxapex, Corviknight, and Amoonguss; in return, Lycanroc-D deals with Chien-Pao, Hydreigon, and Greninja under sand. Garganacl is one of Hisuian Arcanine's best teammates due to its ability to force progress against Water and Steel, notably wearing down Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Quaquaval with Salt Cure. Glimmora forms a potent wallbreaking core with Hisuian Arcanine, taking on Grass and Fairy teams effectively. Furthermore, Glimmora provides entry hazard control with Mortal Spin and sets its own array of hazards to wear down Hisuian Arcanine's switch-ins. In return, Glimmora appreciates Hisuian Arcanine removing Steel-types for it so it can freely use Mortal Spin. Tyranitar provides sandstorm to help chip down opponents and improve Hisuian Arcanine's special bulk, making it trickier to shut down, as well as sets Stealth Rock and spreads paralysis with Thunder Wave to help Hisuian Arcanine outpace and OHKO faster offensive Pokemon. Kleavor provides Stealth Rock with Stone Axe and pivots into Hisuian Arcanine with U-turn, as well as provides additional support in the Steel matchup by hitting Gholdengo, Iron Treads, and Heatran with either Night Slash or Close Combat. Shell Smash Drednaw is a great asset in the Water and Ground matchups due to Swift Swim and Air Balloon, heavily weakening those types for Hisuian Arcanine. In return, Drednaw appreciates Amoonguss and Toxapex being removed by Hisuian Arcanine.</p>"

STAB Knock Off allows Poison teams to much more reliably outlast common foes such as Clodsire and Garganacl. Drain Punch provides Alolan Muk with a solid recovery tool and gives it coverage for common Dark and Steel threats such as Hydreigon, Chien-Pao, and Hisuian Goodra. Protect allows Alolan Muk to scout for coverage move and gain additional Black Sludge recovery. For its final slot, it has two major options that stand out; Poison Jab is a strong second STAB option with a 51% chance to Poison thanks to Poison Touch, allowing Alolan Muk to spread Poison more effectively, while Rest can remove status and allows it to deal with threats like Spectrier one-on-one. Ice Punch can also be useful in easing matchups like Flying and Electric by defeating threats such Iron Jugulis and Thundurus-T.</p> <p>Physically defensive Amoonguss is an incredible partner for Alolan Muk thanks to its Ground neutrality, Water resistance, and STAB Grass moves, as it can handle the Ground and Water threats that would normally feast on Alolan Muk like Great Tusk, Garchomp, Quagsire, and Urshifu-R without much worry. Physically defensive Toxapex can handle threats such as Kleavor and Mimikyu thanks to Haze and Toxic. Both Galarian Slowking and Clodsire compliment Alolan Muk as fellow special walls, as Assault Vest Galarian Slowking handles Enamorus, Iron Moth, Volcarona, and Landorus-I while creating pressure with Future Sight while Alolan Muk helps deals with the Ghost- and Dark-types that would normally threaten it. Meanwhile, Unaware Clodsire deals with setup threats like Gholdengo, Volcarona, and Sneasler while creating pressure by providing hazards which Alolan Muk helps take advantage of by removing Heavy-Duty Boots. Glimmora also appreciates Alolan Muk removing Heavy-Duty Boots, which makes its hazards much more threatening towards threats such as Amoonguss and Articuno, while Alolan Muk appreciates the hazard removal Glimmora brings thanks to Mortal Spin allowing it to come in safely over the course of a game and by putting Corrosion Toxic onto bulky threats such as Corviknight and Toxapex which will just absorb Alolan Muk's attacks otherwise. Corrosion Salazzle can also threaten Toxic onto the previously mentioned Alolan Muk checks along with being able to handle Steel-types like Kingambit and Heatran thanks to Substitute and Protect. Sneasler also breaks the aforementioned Steel-types using Close Combat and can bring in Alolan Muk against threats that eradicate Sneasler like Gholdengo thanks to U-turn.</p>"

Icicle Spear targets opposing Flying-, Ground- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Kilowattrel, Clodsire, and Walking Wake while breaking Focus Sash on Pokemon such as Breloom. Rock Blast benefits from Skill Link and threatens Fire-types like Ceruledge after a boost and other Ice-type Pokemon like Chien-Pao. Ice Shard is useful for revenge killing faster Choice Scarf Pokemon that are weakened like Flutter Mane, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon. Hydro Pump is the alternative in order to not be walled by opposing Steel-types like Kingambit and Forretress. It is also beneficial for threatening Paldean Tauros-F, which is a significant issue to Ice teams, as well as Skeledirge and Torkoal, easing the Fire matchup. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows +2 Cloyster to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Walking Wake, Hydreigon and Indeedee; a Naive nature with the remaining 4 EVs going into Special Attack should be used if opting for Hydro Pump to not reduce its damage. Skill Link is the best ability to run on Cloyster since it guarantees Icicle Spear and Rock Blast hit 5 times. White Herb is Cloyster's preferred item, as it is able to offset the Defense drops of Shell Smash, which makes Cloyster harder to revenge kill. Focus Sash is the alternative to always guarantee one turn of setup from full health, but it is less preferred since Cloyster is harder to OHKO under snow or Aurora Veil.</p> <p>Cloyster's best partner on Ice is Abomasnow. Abomasnow allows Cloyster to have an easier time to set up thanks to it setting snow, which, combined with Aurora Veil, allows it to set up on Pokemon that can usually threaten it out like offensive Great Tusk and Cinderace. Abomasnow also has Leech Seed support to improve Cloyster's longevity and handles Unaware Pokemon Quagsire and Dondozo with its STAB Giga Drain. Cloyster is able to threaten Fire's weather setter Torkoal after a boost, which benefits Abomasnow, as it can come back in to reset the weather for its teammates. Cloyster also appreciates Chien-Pao as an offensive partner, as Swords Dance sets are able to weaken its defensive checks like Toxapex, Kingambit and Rotom-W. Choice Scarf sets are also able to clean up late-game more easily thanks to Cloyster's sweeping. Baxcalibur is also one more offensive partner for Cloyster, as its ability to switch into Will-o-Wisp from Pokemon like Sableye and Rotom-W supports Cloyster's sweeping capabilities, while Cloyster offers additional support against the Dragon-types that threaten Baxcalibur like Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Hydreigon. Choice Band Baxcalibur can also wear down defensive walls like Corviknight and Skeledirge, which gives Cloyster an easier sweep. Glaceon also pairs well with Cloyster, as it can threaten defensive Water-type Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Dondozo with Freeze-Dry. Avalugg can support Cloyster with its Rapid Spin to remove hazards, so Cloyster can come in easier and set up. Avalugg is also able to handle Cloyster's offensive checks like Great Tusk under snow. Froslass is Ice's only viable option for Spikes, which Cloyster appreciates, as defensive Pokemon like Hatterene and Iron Hands aren't able to check it properly after a boost.</p>"

      "Physically Defensive Defogger (Poison)": {
        "description": "<p>Galarian Weezing finds itself serving a key role on Poison thanks to its high physical bulk, wonderful support moves, and, most critically, Levitate giving it a critical Ground immunity to deal with both offensive and defensive Ground-types, such as Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Mamoswine, without much worry. Its secondary Fairy typing is also a major boon for Poison, making it immune to Dragon, which gives it utility in absorbing high powered Dragon moves like Glaive Rush from Baxcalibur and completely checking Garchomp. It also provides a helpful resistance to Dark, giving it added bulk against Dark-types like Alolan Muk and Meowscarada. Strange Steam is used for its STAB attack, dealing solid damage and threatening Dragon-, Fighting-, and Dark-types such as Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Roaring Moon. Defog is incredibly valuable, being the only consistent form of entry hazard removal on Poison, which Galarian Weezing can easily switch in and use thanks to its immunity to Spikes and neutrality to Stealth Rock This also allows it to run Black Sludge to further increase its longevity. Pain Split acts as a form of recovery and offensive pressure, allowing it to drain away health from opposing walls such as Toxapex and Gliscor while healing itself back up. Will-O-Wisp threatens physical attackers from those that it walls like Great Tusk and Dragonite and impairs others that do threaten it like Iron Treads and Corviknight, making them much easier to handle.</p> <p>Alolan Muk and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking are amazing teammates for Galarian Weezing that cover Galarian Weezing's biggest weakness: low Special Defense. As specially bulky tanks, they can switch into strong special attacks, such as Choice Specs Greninja's Extrasensory, while majorly appreciating Defog from Galarian Weezing to maximize their longevity. Alolan Muk handles Psychic- and Ghost-type attacks from foes like Flutter Mane, Spectrier, and Espathra with ease thanks to its Dark typing and STAB Knock Off. Meanwhile, Galarian Slowking can soak up hits from Heatran, Regieleki, and Volcarona while responding back with its myriad of coverage, as well as create traps with Future Sight, which Galarian Weezing can exploit with Strange Steam or use as a chance to Defog safely. Toxapex's Water typing allows it to switch into and wall the many Steel-types of the tier like Scizor, Tinkaton, and Empoleon. It also handles other powerful threats such as Chien-Pao and Ceruledge, using Haze to stop their setup and Infestation or Surf to do damage. Toxapex is also a valuable Knock Off absorber in the Dragon, Dark, and Ice matchups, preventing Galarian Weezing from losing its Black Sludge from foes such as Cyclizar, Sableye, and Alolan Sandslash. Amoonguss appreciates Galarian Weezing taking the stress off it in the Ground matchup and allowing for it to have a much easier time taking on threats, such as Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Mamoswine, after they have been burned. Amoonguss is also able to handle threats to Galarian Weezing like Gastrodon and Sandy Shocks. Thanks to Defog allowing Salazzle safe entry, it can threaten every Steel-type in the tier with a mix of its STAB Flamethrower and Toxic thanks to Corrosion, which puts Steel-types that try to threaten it, such as Heatran and Hisuian Goodra, on timers, and it means Galarian Weezing won't have to worry about them late-game. Glimmora can be used instead of Salazzle, as it also can use Toxic thanks to Corrosion, has Earth Power to hit Heatran, has Energy Ball to help out against Ground-types, such as Great Tusk and Gastrodon, and if its Air Balloon is still intact, it can inflict Toxic onto Clodsire with no fear. With Defog support, Choice Scarf Sneasler can come onto the field safely and fire off strong its strong STAB Close Combat and Dire Claw against threats like Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Enamorus. Okidogi also works well as a Fighting-type that majorly appreciates burn being spread to have an easier time setting up before tearing into threats like Kingambit and Heatran with its STAB moves. Defog support will also allow safe entry for Iron Moth, which melts Steel-types with its powerful Fire-type STAB attacks, such as Gholdengo, Iron Treads, and Corviknight, as well as being able to eradicate Landorus if using Choice Specs with Overheat. Gengar is another solid Choice Specs user that can scare out Skeledirge, which otherwise uses Galarian Weezing for setup and can also deal with Landorus with Icy Wind.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thanks to Ditto's signature ability Imposter, which also copies enemy stat changes, Ditto is one of the best revenge killers in the tier. Ditto's presence alone scares off sweepers like Baxcalibur and Azumarill from setting up. Ditto does not copy the enemy HP stat, so 248 HP EVs are used to minimize damage taken from entry hazards before transforming while maximizing Ditto's HP stat, as well as allowing Ditto to use Struggle 4 times before it faints. 252 Defense EVs minimize the damage Ditto takes from opposing Ditto in the extremely rare mirror matchup. Finally, a Relaxed nature coupled with 0 Speed IVs guarantees that Imposter will never activate first, which ensures that Ditto will have more Transform PP in the aforementioned mirror match.</p> <p>Ursaluna is a great teammate for Ditto, as it can switch into walls and begin applying immediate pressure. Ditto also appreciates Ursaluna's unrivaled ability to punch holes in the opposing team, making a late-game Ditto sweep much easier. If Ditto copies certain targets like Chien-Pao and a majority of the opposing team is weakened, Ditto can win the game. Indeedee is a good teammate for Ditto, as its Psychic Surge ability prevents Ditto from being picked off by priority moves. Blissey is a nice partner for Ditto, as it can absorb status moves that would otherwise cripple Ditto and then shrug them off via Natural Cure. Blissey can also use Thunder Wave to slow down opposing Choice Scarf users that would otherwise Speed tie with Ditto such as Meowscarada and Enamorus Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark is a powerful teammate that pairs well with Ditto, as Ditto can copy the stat boosts from setup sweepers that aim to take advantage of a Choice-locked Hisuian Zoroark. Cyclizar can be used to remove entry hazards so that Ditto can switch in frequently without getting chipped. Additionally, it is able to keep hazards away and use Shed Tail to bring Ditto in behind a Substitute and make it even more threatening. Maushold can use its high speed tier to lock Bulk Up users like Landorus-Therian that would otherwise be able to stall out Ditto. Additionally, Maushold is able to break down walls due to the sheer power of Population Bomb. Pivots are great teammates for Ditto because they can lure in targets for Ditto to copy. Choice Scarf Staraptor and Defensive Braviary are solid picks, as they can use U-turn to go right into Ditto. Braviary is also capable of using Defog to keep Ditto alive for longer.</p>"

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Flying</h1> <p>Hurricane can be used over Substitute or U-turn as a way to make Articuno more threatening against foes such as Iron Valiant, Iron Defense Zamazenta, and Abomasnow; however, it has poor accuracy and using it foregoes the generally greater utility of these two moves. An alternative EV spread of 240 HP / 84 SpD / 184 Spe allows Articuno to outspeed maximum Speed Pelipper, Frosmoth, and Hisuian Braviary while still avoiding a 2HKO from Choice Specs Greninja.</p> </section>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive (Flying)": {
        "description": "<p>Articuno has carved itself an important position in Flying’s roster as the type’s premier special wall and Ice Beam sponge, serving as a bulwark against key foes such as Choice Specs Greninja, Choice Specs Dragapult, Calm Mind Ursaluna-B, Frosmoth, and Nasty Plot Slowbro, which are otherwise extremely threatening to Flying teams. Freeze-Dry is the only offensive move Articuno needs, pressuring many crucial targets throughout the metagame such as both Landorus formes, Toxapex, Quagsire, Ogerpon-W, Manaphy, and Enamorus. Aside from hitting Water-types for super effective damage, Freeze-Dry is also particularly useful on this relatively passive set due to its high 32 PP. This allows Articuno to stay threatening over longer games despite only using one attacking move as well as repeatedly fish for freezes against neutral targets such as Hatterene and Galarian Weezing. Substitute blocks Toxic from Toxapex, Quagsire, Clodsire, and Mandibuzz, allowing Articuno to duel these Pokemon and come out on top. Furthermore, Substitute combined with Roost and Pressure allows Articuno to stall out foes such as Frosmoth and Ursaluna-B, draining their PP so Articuno’s teammates can come in and take advantage of them. As an alternative to Substitute, U-turn can be used to make Articuno less passive and safely bring in teammates against faster foes, which is especially beneficial for teammates such as Choice Band Dragonite and Galarian Moltres. Haze rounds out this set by preventing Articuno from becoming setup fodder against foes such as Sinistcha, Ursaluna-B, Manaphy, and Hatterene. Furthermore, Haze can be used to neutralize Belly Drum Azumarill’s boosts, as with these EVs Articuno will always outspeed it and survive a +6 Aqua Jet from full HP. The given EVs allow Articuno to outrun uninvested Landorus-T, Adamant Torterra, and maximum Speed Azumarill while maximizing special bulk.</p> <p>Gliscor is an excellent partner to Articuno, nullifying Electric-type attacks and Toxic aimed at Articuno, absorbing Knock Off to prevent the removal of Articuno’s Heavy-Duty Boots, and threatening Steel-types such as Heatran and Hisuian Goodra with its STAB Earthquake. In exchange, Gliscor appreciates Articuno taking Ice Beam from threats such as Greninja and handling Water-types such as Walking Wake and Manaphy. Alternatively, physically defensive Landorus-T complements Articuno by threatening Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Kleavor and absorbing Electric-type hits while forming a defensive core with it. Landorus-T similarly appreciates Articuno taking on foes such as Frosmoth and Ogerpon-W while being offensively threatening against Steel- and Fire-types that wall Articuno such as Empoleon, Ceruledge, and Hisuian Arcanine. Physically defensive Corviknight is another teammate that forms a defensive core with Articuno, serving as a check to many physical sweepers that would otherwise take advantage of it, such as Scizor, Baxcalibur, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit, especially if running Iron Defense. Moreover, Corviknight can block Toxic aimed at Articuno and clear Stealth Rock using Defog in the event that Articuno has its item removed. In return, Articuno can deal with various special threats that would threaten or take advantage of Corviknight, such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Manaphy, and Slowbro. The combination of Articuno, Corviknight, and specially defensive Gliscor also allows Flying to safely handle all standard variants of Flutter Mane, which is of great use due to how threatening this Pokemon can be to Flying teams if left unchecked. Moltres pairs nicely with Articuno, checking various physical threats such as Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Ogerpon-H, while Articuno answers Water-types for it. Zapdos and Thundurus-T can take out barriers to Articuno such as Empoleon and Corviknight with their Electric-type STAB moves; physically defensive Zapdos using Heat Wave can also answer Iron Treads and compounds nicely with Articuno’s special walling capabilities and neutrality to Ice. Setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragonite, Galarian Moltres, and Nasty Plot Tornadus-T enjoy Articuno removing impediments to their sweeping such as Quagsire, Clodsire, Slowbro, and Amoonguss. Choice Scarf Enamorus supports Articuno by revenge killing foes such as Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and both Urshifu formes, and can use Healing Wish to cure Articuno’s status condition and bring it back to full HP in a pinch. Galarian Zapdos is an alternative Choice Scarf user that also hits the aforementioned targets while lacking a Stealth Rock weakness, possessing the ability to pivot with U-turn, and being more useful against types such as Bug. Physically defensive Gyarados can also aid Articuno by serving as a response to sweepers like Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Dragonite; to return the favor, Articuno deals with Quagsire and Clodsire. It should be noted that this is by no means an exhaustive list of potential teammates for Articuno, as virtually every Flying option appreciates it soaking up Ice Beams and walling special threats.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Zapdos is a potent wallbreaker for Electric teams, being able to threaten Pokemon that give its teammates a hard time such as Great Tusk, Gastrodon, specially defensive Iron Treads, and Landorus-T. Aside from that, its Flying typing provides Electric teams an immunity to Ground and a resistance to Fighting. Hurricane is Zapdos's strongest STAB move, being able to OHKO Sableye, Amoonguss, and possibly Quagsire, and also being able to 2HKO physically defensive Skeledirge and Ursaluna. Zapdos can also take advantage of matchups against rain teams by being able to spam Hurricane without fear of missing. Volt Switch allows Zapdos to bring in teammates safely against special walls like Assault Vest Iron Hands, Assault Vest Galarian Slowking, and Heatran. Heat Wave provides Zapdos great coverage, allowing it to 2HKO Magnezone, as well as Klefki under Light Screen and Iron Treads. Static has a chance to paralyze Pokemon that make contact with Zapdos such as Dragonite and Mimikyu.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks makes for a great partner, being able to provide entry hazard support with both Stealth Rock and Spikes, as well as being able to threaten Heatran with Earth Power. Regieleki is another great partner, as it is able to remove hazards with Rapid Spin so that Zapdos can switch in more often without losing a good amount of its health to Stealth Rock. It is also able to outspeed Pokemon that outspeed Zapdos such as Flutter Mane and non-Choice Scarf Greninja. Pokemon with great special bulk such as Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and Tyranitar can be tough for Zapdos, with the latter being able to threaten it with Stone Edge. Hence, Iron Hands pairs well with Zapdos, as it is able to threaten Galarian Slowking with Earthquake and Tyranitar with Drain Punch. In return, Zapdos can switch into anticipated Ground-type attacks from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Magnezone is another great partner, being able to threaten Hatterene and Flutter Mane, as well as potentially winning the Chien-Pao matchup. Lastly, Zapdos's wallbreaking opens up sweeping opportunities for fast sweepers such as Nasty Plot Rotom-W and Choice Scarf Pawmot. Both of them can beat Landorus-T with Hydro Pump and Ice Punch, respectively, and Pawmot has the added merit of potentially reviving Zapdos with Revival Blessing.</p>"

Outrage is preferred due to the lack of Fairy-types and its utter power, allowing Dragonite to sweep opposing Dragon teams with the help of Baxcalibur and Dragapult late-game. Earthquake allows Dragonite to nail Poison- and Steel-type switch-ins such as Toxapex, Clodsire, and Gholdengo. Alternatively, Fire Punch threatens would-be checks like Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo. Extreme Speed picks off weakened threats such as Greninja and Iron Valiant attempting to revenge kill it, while Encore may be used to lock physical walls like Dondozo, Quagsire, and Ting-Lu into a move, either letting Dragonite deal extra chip damage or effortlessly set up in front of them. A Jolly nature allows Dragonite to outpace Chien-Pao and Dragapult after a Dragon Dance so that Dragonite can OHKO them with Outrage, at the cost of power.</p> <p>Dragonite appreciates Baxcalibur's immunity to Will-O-Wisp from threats such as Sableye and Skeledirge, neutrality to Ice-type moves, and ability to threaten Ting-Lu. In return, Dragonite checks troublesome Fighting-types like Quaquaval and Slither Wing. Cyclizar's Shed Tail in conjunction with Multiscale grants Dragonite many chances to set up and prevents it from being affected by status effects inflicted by Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Skeledirge. Garchomp sets up entry hazards in the form of Stealth Rock and Spikes, chipping down Dragonite's switch-ins such as Forretress, Kingambit, and Quagsire. Dragapult breaks past walls such as Dondozo and Corviknight and prevents Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk and Iron Treads from clearing Garchomp's entry hazards. Dragalge's secondary Poison typing and commendable bulk allow it to check Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane, and it supports Dragonite's sweeping with Toxic Spikes, notably wearing down Ting-Lu, Slowbro, and Quagsire. Choice Scarf Roaring Moon is a great revenge killer and method of speed control, as it outpaces and deals with Choice Scarf Baxcalibur, Chien-Pao, and Choice Specs Greninja. Walking Wake is another plausible Choice Scarf user due to its ability to threaten Chien-Pao and singlehandedly sweep Fire teams.</p>"

Multiscale can be very helpful to survive a super effective attack from foes such as Hydreigon. Outrage is a powerful STAB move that breaks defensive cores, 2HKOing physical walls such as Toxapex, Quagsire, and Amoonguss. Fire Punch and Earthquake punish Steel-types such as Corviknight and Iron Treads, as well as the aforementioned Poison-types. Brick Break can be helpful to target Dark-types such as Kingambit, and it removes dual screens against Dark and Fairy teams to help its teammates break. Iron Head can be used to deal with Fairy-types such as Hatterene, while Waterfall can be used in rain archetypes to deal with types such as Ground.</p> <p>Corviknight can deal with Ice-type Pokemon like Chien-Pao with Iron Head and can pivot with U-turn. Kilowattrel can also pivot Dragonite in with Volt Switch and can help it deal with physical walls like Dondozo and Iron Defense Corviknight.

Bombirdier can provide entry hazard support with Stealth Rock and prevent foes such as Ting-Lu from setting up their own hazards with Taunt while also offering extra pivoting with Parting Shot to help Dragonite find more occasions to wallbreak. Gyarados is another teammate that can deal with some Ice-types such as Chien-Pao, but the lack of recovery can wear it down very quickly.

Aqua Jet patches up its below-average Speed tier and threatens faster threats like Iron Moth, Sandy Shocks, and Flutter Mane. Aqua Jet can also sweep late-game, especially against types that lack Water-resistant Pokemon like Steel. Play Rough breaks through sturdier threats that are not OHKOed by Aqua Jet like Hydreigon and Iron Hands. It also threatens opposing Dragon-types like Roaring Moon and Dragalge. Liquidation can be used over Play Rough to OHKO Pokemon like Corviknight, Unaware Clodsire, and Bronzong after Belly Drum. Ice Spinner specifically hits Water Absorb Clodsire and Amoonguss for super effective damage. Body Slam is also another option to significantly threaten Toxapex at +6 Attack while still being able to target the aforementioned Clodsire and Amoonguss for neutral damage. Trailblaze can be used to always beat Quagsire as well. 4 HP EVs are given to make Azumarill's HP an even number so when it activates Belly Drum from full HP, it can activate its Sitrus Berry immediately.</p> <p>One of Azumarill's best partners on Fairy teams is Klefki. Klefki sets up dual screens, which leads to Azumarill having an easier time setting up and sweeping. Klefki also sets Spikes for Azumarill, allowing Azumarill to secure KOs easier after a Belly Drum, particularly against Amoonguss and Toxapex after one layer of Spikes. Klefki also hinders Azumarill's offensive checks like Breloom with Thunder Wave. In return, Azumarill threatens opposing Fire- and Ground-types that threaten Klefki like Cinderace and Great Tusk. Azumarill forms a potent offensive core with Flutter Mane, which threatens the physical walls that may impede Azumarill's sweep like Unaware Quagsire and Toxapex, while Azumarill handles special walls like specially defensive Ting-Lu, Assault Vest Iron Hands, and Blissey. Azumarill also appreciates Iron Valiant as an offensive partner, as special sets can answer physical walls like Dondozo and hinder Azumarill's checks like Toxapex by using Trick, and—like with Flutter Mane—Azumarill can deal considerable damage to threats like Clodsire and Gholdengo. Magic Bounce Hatterene also assists Azumarill, as it bounces back entry hazards—particularly Toxic Spikes—which limits Azumarill's sweeping capabilities. Hatterene also has a strong matchup into Ground, Poison, and Water teams; Azumarill appreciates the latter two, since Hatterene is able to threaten Pokemon like Amoonguss and Toxapex.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its Steel typing, solid bulk, powerful STAB priority, and decent coverage moves, Scizor answers types such as Fairy, Ice, Rock, Ground, and Water. Swords Dance allows Scizor to OHKO the likes of Dragapult and Cyclizar. Technician-boosted Bullet Punch is Scizor's most spammable attack, serving as a priority STAB move to revenge kill sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Flutter Mane. Close Combat answers Steel teams and threaten slower walls like Ting-Lu and Corviknight. Trailblaze allows Scizor to outspeed threats like Great Tusk and Hydreigon at +1 Speed and hits Quagsire and Gastrodon. Fury Cutter provides an additional Technician-boosted STAB move and is mainly used in tandem with Metronome to break Dondozo. Thief offers coverage and allows Life Orb Scizor to answer Gholdengo and 2HKO Skeledirge thanks to the boost from Technician, though Life Orb isn't recommended outside of these scenarios. Alternatively, Metal Coat enhances the power of Bullet Punch without drawbacks. The EV spread maximizes Scizor's damage output and allows it to outspeed uninvested Rotom forms and Adamant Azumarill.</p> <p>Volcarona is the perfect partner for Scizor, as it's less threatened by Fire-types and can sweep through most Steel, Psychic, and Ground teams. It takes care of Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Klefki; in return, Scizor handles Rock-types like Glimmora and Lycanroc-D and weakens the opposing team to facilitate Volcarona's late-game sweep. Slither Wing offers great coverage against types that Scizor struggles to beat, threatening Electric- and Rock-types with Earthquake, Flying- and Water-types with Wild Charge, and Steel-types with Flare Blitz or Close Combat. Similar to Scizor, Lokix gets two powerful STAB priority moves in First Impression and Sucker Punch which, paired with Tinted Lens, allow it to OHKO faster threats like Greninja, Gengar, and Kilowattrel after chip damage. These priority moves, along with Masquerain's Sticky Web support, allow Bug teams to compensate for their generally slower Speed tier. Another good partner to Scizor is Guts Heracross, which can sponge status moves targeting its teammates and sweep through teams that have been weakened by Scizor. With its combination of Sleep Powder and Energy Ball, Vivillon can take out threats that give Bug teams trouble, particularly Dondozo. Rabsca and Forretress provide substantial support; Rabsca's Revival Blessing offers Scizor a second chance at breaking down the opponent's team, while Forretress's entry hazard stacking and Rapid Spin combination allows its teammates to switch in more safely and make holes in the opposing team.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With the highest HP stat in all of Pokemon, an extremely impressive Special Defense stat, and access to important utility moves, Blissey is one of the best special walls in the entire tier, as well as being Normal's best Stealth Rock setter. Seismic Toss is the best move for Blissey to deal consistent damage and not be a completely passive Pokemon despite being ineffective against Ghost-types. Shadow Ball can be used over Seismic Toss in order to not be completely useless against Ghost-types. Stealth Rock helps Blissey's offensive teammates like Ursaluna and Maushold have an easier time getting KOs. Thunder Wave is used to slow down opposing Pokemon so that Blissey's slower, wallbreaking teammates, such as Ursaluna, have an easier time making progress. Alternatively, Healing Wish can be used over Thunder Wave in order to heal one of Blissey's teammates to full health, gaining momentum and making an end-game sweep easier.</p> <p>Wallbreakers like Ursaluna and Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark are great teammates for Blissey, as they are capable of dealing with the defensive Pokemon that Blissey is unable to beat, such as Sableye, Toxapex, and Dondozo. In return, Blissey can switch into attacks to keep the wallbreakers safe. Ditto and Blissey make a great pair, as, thanks to Natural Cure, Blissey is able to switch in to status moves that would otherwise cripple Ditto, such as Will-O-Wisp from Sableye, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W, as well as Thunder Wave from Gholdengo, then get rid of the status via Natural Cure. Ditto is also capable of dealing with setup sweepers that would otherwise threaten Blissey such as Baxcalibur and Dragonite. Thunder Wave is also a great option to use on opposing Choice Scarf users like Iron Valiant and Meowscarada so Ditto will not have to worry about Speed ties. Hisuian Zoroark is a great teammate for Blissey, as the immunity to Fighting-type moves is extremely valuable. Hisuian Zoroark is also able to burn opposing physical threats like Urshifu-R and Dragonite, which would otherwise make quick work of Blissey, as well as dealing with Ghost-type Pokemon which Blissey cannot damage without Shadow Ball. Hisuian Zoroark's Knock Off can also help Blissey wear down targets by making them vulnerable to entry hazards and removing Leftovers and Black Sludge recovery. Moreover, Hisuian Zoroark can disguise itself as Blissey and catch foes such as Iron Hands, Zamazenta and Sneasler off guard. Cyclizar is a good teammate for Blissey, as Blissey can switch into the fast special attackers that would otherwise threaten Cyclizar such as Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Walking Wake. Cyclizar also carries Knock Off, which, as mentioned previously, works well with Blissey. Choice Specs Cyclizar outspeeds and threatens to OHKO non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant, which would otherwise threaten Blissey, with Hyper Voice. Finally, Braviary and Staraptor can function as alternative switch-ins to Fighting-type Pokemon like Quaquaval and Great Tusk and retaliate with their STAB-boosted Brave Bird. Braviary uses Defog to keep Blissey and teammates safe from hazards, while Staraptor is a more offensive Choice Scarf user able to threaten Fighting-type Pokemon.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Pelipper provides rain for Water teams, which enables Barraskewda and wallbreakers like Azumarill and Walking Wake. Hurricane is the STAB move of choice, bypassing the accuracy check in rain while nailing Water-resistant Grass-types, such as Amoonguss, Meowscarada, and Breloom. Roost allows Pelipper to come in multiple times throughout the match to re-set rain if need be. U-turn let's it slow pivot into threats such as Quaquaval and Barraskewda. Knock Off cripples foes, while Surf gives a secondary STAB move boosted by rain, allowing Pelipper to wear down Pokemon like Gholdengo and Kingambit. Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to switch in and set rain even if Stealth Rock is up. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 48 Def / 212 Spe with a Timid nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Breloom.</p> <p>Barraskewda is the obvious partner choice thanks to its ridiculous Speed with Swift Swim in rain. It also appreciates Pelipper's slow pivoting with U-turn due to its lack of bulk. Walking Wake is another great rain attacker, since its STAB Dragon-type moves hit most Water-resistant and immune foes, such as opposing Gastrodon and Amoonguss, hard. Quaquaval appreciates Pelipper's slow pivoting to come in safely and can potentially snowball through teams with rain-boosted Aqua Step and Moxie. Quaquaval can also get rid of entry hazards should Pelipper get hit by Knock Off, provided it has Rapid Spin. Gastrodon and Quagsire are also really good partners thanks to their Electric immunities. Both also provide entry hazards, pressuring opponents, and Pelipper can use hazard removal turns to pivot out with U-turn or heal with Roost. Rotom-W can form a VoltTurn core with Pelipper, allowing the team to gain momentum easily and bring in Pokemon fairly safely. Rotom-W can also switch into opposing Electric-types like Magnezone, Iron Hands, and Sandy Shocks if necessary. Toxapex provides a Fighting resistance, a Grass neutrality, and another pivot thanks to its ability, Regenerator. Slowking checks threats such as Indeedee and Walking Wake, and it's another slow pivot thanks to Chilly Reception and Regenerator, bringing Pelipper in safely to set the rain. Both Toxapex and Slowking can also easily pivot into Pelipper with Eject Button, since Regenerator means they won't lose too much health from an attack. Azumarill can take advantage of rain with priority in Aqua Jet, as well as bringing a very strong Water-type STAB move.</p>"

Spore gives Breloom setup opportunities and impedes otherwise major threats to the team such as Flying-types like Corviknight and Pelipper and Poison-types such as Toxapex, Iron Moth, and Clodsire. Focus Sash guarantees it can use Spore at least once—provided Breloom can keep itself at full HP—and also gives Breloom the opportunity to use Swords Dance as well. Bullet Seed is a fantastic STAB move that threatens Water-types like Dondozo and Quagsire. Mach Punch provides Breloom with a super strong STAB move with priority to not only circumvent its below average Speed but also threatens faster Pokemon such as Meowscarada, Iron Treads, and Cyclizar. Swords Dance allows Breloom to not only power up its STAB moves but takes advantage of the setup opportunities that Spore can provide. Bulldoze, however, can apply pressure to Poison-types such as Skuntank and Toxapex while also putting the foe at a potential Speed disadvantage.</p> <p>Setup sweepers such as Paldean Tauros-F and Lucario appreciate Breloom's ability to potentially impede their checks such as Toxapex, Dondozo, and Quagsire, giving them ample setup opportunities. Paldean Tauros-F handles the Dark matchup fairly easily thanks to it avoiding being burned by Sableye while also resisting Meowscarada's and Chien-Pao's STAB moves. Lucario can threaten Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant with its STAB Bullet Punch. Assault Vest Iron Hands is another great partner that can handle the special attacking Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane and Hatterene while also handling Flying-types such as Dragonite and Iron Jugulis which could otherwise threaten Breloom out. Entry hazard control from Great Tusk is imperative to allow Breloom to keep its Focus Sash intact. Great Tusk also helps Breloom by providing Stealth Rock, which racks up chip damage with the switches Breloom can force. Gallade is a great partner that can threaten Poison-types such as Amoonguss and Toxapex. Iron Valiant is another fantastic partner for Breloom, providing Future Sight support to ward off the Poison-types that like to switch into both of Breloom's STAB moves. Its Fairy STAB moves also ease the Dark and Dragon matchups as well as being quite useful in the Fighting mirror.</p>"

      "Focus Sash (Grass)": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its high Attack, great ability in Technician, and a STAB priority move, Breloom is a staple on Grass teams as a late-game cleaner. Besides boosting Mach Punch, Technician provides Grass teams with powerful Rock-type coverage in its Rock Tomb. These two moves and Focus Sash allow Breloom to handle an assortment of major threats to grass teams, including Volcarona, Chien-Pao, Iron Jugulis, Kilowattrel, Choice Specs Greninja, and Kingambit. With Bullet Seed or Close Combat, it also can function as a good wallbreaker. Spore is an amazing utility move to stop threats and force out Pokemon like Skeledirge. However, with the use of other Spore users like Amoonguss and Toedscruel, Spore can be replaced with Swords Dance. With it, Breloom can set up when opponents predict it will use Spore, increasing its late-game cleaning potential. An Adamant nature is standard, but Jolly Breloom can outspeed Adamant Dragonite, Adamant Cetitan, and Choice Specs Pelipper.</p> <p>Other offensive teammates like Meowscarada and Rotom-C benefit from Breloom forcing out threats with Spore or breaking through Pokemon like Toxapex, Corviknight, or Ting-lu with its high Attack stat and Spore. In exchange, Meowscarada handles Psychic-types such as Gallade and Espathra. Setup Pokemon like Substitute Rotom-C work especially well with Breloom, as they can come in freely on a slept enemy or a physical wall Breloom draws in. The type's more passive defensive Pokemon also support Breloom, with Amoonguss dealing with Fairy-types and Wo-Chien, by using Leech Seed on a foe, allowing chipped Breloom to switch in and restore its Focus Sash protection. Breloom also enjoys Spikes or Toxic Spikes Brambleghast or Toedscruel to chip foes into KO range, including Toxapex and Iron Hands after a Swords Dance. Aurora Veil from Abomasnow can increase Breloom's chances to set up with Swords Dance. Breloom is weak against bulkier Pokemon with multi-hit moves, which can instantly KO it through Focus Sash, like Icicle Spear from Baxcalibur. Thus, entry hazards to wear them down and physical walls, like Body Press Abomasnow, are very important. Once chipped, Breloom's frailty and low Speed make it weak to faster priority users and to other offensive Pokemon not bothered by Mach Punch. To handle the latter, such as Flutter Mane and Paldean Tauros-B, faster teammates like Choice Scarf Meoscarada and Rotom-C can be very helpful.</p>"

Prankster Will-O-Wisp lets Sableye neutralize threats to Dark-type teams such as Great Tusk and Dragonite by burning them before they can make a move. Taunt lets it shut down set up attempts from Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and Bulk Up Corviknight or hinder opposing defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex and Clodsire. Taunt also blocks entry hazards from going up, which is huge for Dark due to its lack of entry hazard control. Alternatively, Encore lets Sableye halt the aforementioned setup attempts and gain more momentum from them. Knock Off capitalizes on the switches that Sableye forces by knocking off crucial items from Pokemon such as Toxapex or Dondozo. Alternatively, Night Shade deals steady damage throughout the game. Finally, Recover gives Sableye longevity to continually check the aforementioned threats. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Sableye come in and out without worrying about residual damage from entry hazards.</p> <p>Some great teammates for Sableye include Skuntank and Kingambit, as both of them boast a critical neutrality to Fairy that lets them take hits such as Choice Scarf Iron Valiant's and Flutter Mane's Moonblasts and force both out. In return, Sableye can complement Skuntank's chip damage from Toxic Spikes through its utility moves and ease Kingambit's setup through item removal and spreading burns. Ting-Lu is another good teammate, as it can set entry hazards to further wear away at the opposing team while also acting as an emergency soft check to Fairy-types if it is running Heavy Slam. Reciprocally, Sableye can accentuate the effect of Ting-Lu's entry hazards by removing Heavy-Duty Boots and taking Fighting-type moves such as Slither Wing's and Great Tusk's Close Combats. Chien-Pao, Meowscarada, and Greninja all greatly appreciate Sableye's ability to grind down the opposing team with Knock Off and Will-O-Wisp, while also liking Sableye's ability to hinder walls such as Toxapex and Dondozo and keep entry hazards off the field with Taunt. Lokix is a decent teammate, as it greatly assists in the Dark-type mirror matchup, where Sableye can do nothing due to Prankster being nullified by Dark-types.</p>"

Bullet Seed, alongside Loaded Dice, gives Torterra an incredibly strong STAB combination when paired with Headlong Rush and hits things Seed Bomb cannot KO such as Walking Wake and Air Balloon Glimmora. Seed Bomb is a less powerful alternative but comes with the upside of not having to run Loaded Dice for reliability. Headlong Rush allows Torterra to hit Steel- and Poison-types such as Heatran and Amoonguss. Rock Blast is also boosted by Loaded Dice and hits Flying-types, such as Talonflame, Dragonite, and Zapdos, that can ignore Torterra's STAB moves as well as hitting Bug-types such as Volcarona. Alternatively, Heavy Slam provides Torterra with a way to hit Galarian Weezing to secure the Poison matchup alongside being a good option into Fairy teams as a whole. An Adamant nature is preferred to gain as much extra power as possible, but a Jolly nature can outspeed slower Choice Scarf users such as Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott. Soft Sand is an alternative to Loaded Dice if Seed Bomb and Heavy Slam are run, which lets Torterra's Headlong Rush have a favorable roll to OHKO Amoonguss with a Shell Smash boost.</p> <p>Ogerpon-H is a great teammate for Torterra, as it can remove Corviknight, an otherwise large barrier for Torterra's sweeping attempts. In return, Torterra breaks through Toxapex, which inhibits Ogerpon-H's sweeping attempts.

In return, Torterra easily destroys bulkier team compositions, such as Poison, that Meowscarada struggles to make meaningful progress against. Amoonguss provides opportunities for Torterra to set up thanks to Spore, which Torterra can struggle with finding otherwise. Abomasnow provides Aurora Veil support to aid Torterra in its sweeping efforts, offers a way to beat Dragon teams, and provides an Ice neutrality, allowing it to take a few hits from Chien-Pao, while Brambleghast can remove entry hazards to let Torterra switch in and take advantage of passive switch-ins more readily. Breloom can also put foes to sleep with Spore, while using Mach Punch to remove Choice Scarf users such as Roaring Moon and threaten Baxcalibur, which can each end Torterra's sweeping attempts quickly. Hisuian Lilligant and Rotom-C can also help in the Flying matchup, where Torterra struggles thanks to Ice Spinner and Electric-type STAB moves, respectively, while also being able to scare out Corviknight.

Thunder Punch allows Infernape to threaten several bulky Water-types. It can 2HKO mixed defensive Toxapex most of the time and OHKO Pelipper and Gyarados. With Knock Off, Infernape can not only threaten Ghost-types, such as Skeledirge, but it can also remove key items, such as Heavy-Duty Boots, from the likes of Pelipper, Ninetales, and Baxcalibur to make them susceptible to entry hazards. However, Close Combat is generally more useful due to the amount of targets it can remove like Ursaluna-B and Ting-Lu, benefiting Fire teams. Fire Punch can be run over Flare Blitz. Although weaker, using Fire Punch doesn't result in Infernape taking recoil damage, improving its longevity. However, Flare Blitz is more reliable despite its recoil damage, and the recoil damage can be solved when running Ninetales thanks to the its access to Healing Wish. Choice Scarf is another option for Infernape, as this can allow it to outspeed and threaten would-be faster Pokemon, such as Flutter Mane, but this trades away its ability to win one-on-one against more bulky Pokemon like Ursaluna-B.</p> </section>",

Its Fighting typing grants Infernape and Fire teams a better matchup against Dark teams, being able to threaten the likes of Hydreigon and Chien-Pao while also resisting Kingambit's Sucker Punch, and with Flare Blitz, it can threaten Landorus. Close Combat is Infernape's primary Fighting-type STAB move, massively threaten the likes of Ursaluna-B and Baxcalibur. With U-turn, Infernape can safely pivot out of its switch-ins, such as Dondozo, into a teammate that can threaten them. Infernape is also able to serve as a great revenge killer thanks to its access to an Iron Fist-boosted Mach Punch, being able to pick off weakened sweepers such as Baxcalibur, Choice Scarf Hisuian Arcanine, Greninja, and Chien-Pao.</p> <p>Ninetales and Torkoal make for great partners for Infernape, as the two of them up sun to further boost Infernape's Flare Blitz. Ninetales also commonly uses Solar Beam, allowing it to OHKO threats to Infernape, such as physically defensive Quagsire, and can heal Infernape with Healing Wish, while Torkoal can remove entry hazards for Infernape with its access to Rapid Spin. Torkoal and Heatran can set Stealth Rock in order to wear down foes for Infernape to pick off. For example, Infernape is guaranteed a 2HKO on Galarian Weezing after Stealth Rock damage. In return, Infernape can OHKO Landorus with Flare Blitz under sun as well as both Ursaluna-B and Mamoswine without sun. Cinderace is another noteworthy teammate, as not only can it remove hazards with Court Change, but it is also able to revenge kill faster Ghost-types Infernape cannot such as Dragapult and Speed-boosted Ceruledge with Sucker Punch. In return, Infernape's Fighting-type STAB move frees up a moveslot for Cinderace, as the latter no longer needs High Jump Kick. Volcanion is another great teammate, as it provides Fire teams an immunity to Water, and in return, Infernape is able to threaten the likes of Iron Treads and Landorus for it. Talonflame and Moltres provide a Ground immunity, Will-O-Wisp support, and they can bring Infernape in via U-turn. The two of them are also able to lure bulky Pokemon like Ursaluna-B and Ting-Lu for Infernape to break. Talonflame also provides Defog support, while Moltres's bulk allows it to take on Dragonite, which Infernape greatly appreciates. Infernape's wallbreaking enables other wallbreakers and sweepers such as Ogerpon-H, Volcarona, and Ceruledge to clean late-game. In particular, Infernape can remove Alolan Muk and Heatran to enable a sweep from Volcarona.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Empoleon's access to a nice batch of utility options such as Stealth Rock, Roar, and Defog allows it to support its team with entry hazards, phaze foes, and deter Defog. Empoleon acts as a great special wall, being able to deal with foes such as Choice Specs Walking Wake, Greninja, and Hatterene. Flash Cannon gives Empoleon an easier time dealing with Fairy-type Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Hatterene, and Alolan Ninetales, as well as hitting Ice-types like Earthquake-less Baxcalibur and non-Choice Band Chien-Pao. Empoleon also takes neutral damage from Freeze Dry from Alolan Ninetales and Articuno, which have to be extremely wary of Flash Cannon and Knock Off, respectively. Roar is a great option for Empoleon to get rid of setup sweepers such as Manaphy, Volcarona, and Spectrier, as well as applying more Stealth Rock damage to the Pokemon that are forced in. Lastly, Knock Off allows Empoleon to put itself in a better position to take hits from offensive Pokemon such as Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Basculegion-F, as well as crippling defensive Pokemon that rely heavily on their item, such as Articuno, Corviknight, and Alolan Muk. Leftovers synergizes well with Empoleon's Stealth Rock resistance, and it also appreciates the extra longevity Leftovers provides. However, Heavy-Duty Boots is a better option for teams with no entry hazard removal, as Empoleon is prone to getting worn down by Spikes from repeated switching. 60 Speed EVs allow Empoleon to outspeed uninvested Corviknight and 2HKO it with +2 Surf, helping prevent hazard removal.</p> <p>Toxapex forms a nice defensive core with Empoleon, as the support from Toxic Spikes helps whittle down Pokemon that would otherwise beat Empoleon, such as Zamazenta, Meowscarada, and Urshifu-R. Empoleon can also switch into the Psychic-type attacks that would make quick work of Toxapex, and Toxapex can switch in on Fighting-type attacks for Empoleon. Physically defensive Rotom-W provides a valuable Ground-type immunity as well as a slow Volt Switch to help Empoleon get in more easily. Will-O-Wisp support from Rotom-W also allows Empoleon to stand up to a physically attacking foe that it might not otherwise be able to, such as Iron Treads or Alolan Muk. Quagsire is another excellent complement to Empoleon, as it provides a valuable Electric-type immunity, as well as helping chip down walls with Spikes and Toxic support. Quagsire also helps versus Zamazenta, a setup Pokemon that Empoleon struggles to phaze, and Empoleon can in turn take on Sinistcha, a setup Pokemon that tears through Quagsire. The physically defensive prowess of Quagsire and the specially defensive power of Empoleon form an incredibly potent defensive pairing. Hisuian Samurott can set Spikes via Ceaseless Edge and stack hazard damage in tandem with Stealth Rock from Empoleon. Empoleon is also capable of switching into Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon such as Flutter Mane that would otherwise plague Hisuian Samurott. Manaphy is also a strong teammate, as Empoleon's entry hazard and Knock Off support allows it to set up and secure KOs more easily. Empoleon can also switch into foes that wish to poison Manaphy, such as Toxapex. Ogerpon-W is a great physical wallbreaking teammate for Empoleon. Empoleon's entry hazard support from Empoleon, whittles down Pokemon that would otherwise switch into it, and in return Ogerpon-W smashes Ground-type Pokemon that would otherwise beat Empoleon, such as Great Tusk and Gliscor. Choice Specs Greninja is also a great wallbreaking teammate, as it outspeeds and OHKOes many Ground-type Pokemon that would otherwise give Empoleon trouble, such as Landorus, Garchomp, and Quagsire. Empoleon is also able to safely switch into Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon like Hatterene and Flutter Mane. Urshifu-R thrives with Empoleon's hazard support, as almost nothing will be safe from a +2 Surging Strikes or Close Combat. If Empoleon is not using Heavy-Duty Boots, Quaquaval is a fantastic teammate. Their Fighting and Steel typings have nice synergy, as Quaquaval can take care of Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Kingambit, as well as removing entry hazards via Rapid Spin. Azumarill can deal with Fighting-type Pokemon such as Kommo-o, Zamazenta, and Great Tusk, while Empoleon can handle Poison-type Pokemon such as Galarian Weezing, Glimmora, and Iron Moth. Pelipper is capable of setting rain for Empoleon, as well as taking on Grass-type Pokemon such as Hisuian Lilligant and Meowscarada with it's perfectly accurate Hurricane. Basculegion-F's Normal-type immunity means that Empoleon's Stealth Rock and Hisuian Samurott's Spikes cannot be removed via Rapid Spin.</p>"

Brave Bird makes short work of the aforementioned Fighting-types, as well as bulky Grass-types like Wo-Chien and Amoonguss, and threatens specially defensive Toxapex and Skeledirge with a 2HKO if they switch into it. Close Combat is what gives Staraptor its amazing wallbreaking potential, OHKOing Kingambit, Chien-Pao, Greninja, and Cyclizar while KOing Baxcalibur after Stealth Rock damage and threatening Iron Treads with a 2HKO. Final Gambit, boosted by 28 HP EVs, OHKOes targets Staraptor wouldn't otherwise beat, such as Rotom-W, physically defensive Toxapex, Hatterene, Klefki, and Forretress after Stealth Rock damage—denying dual screens and/or entry hazards from the last two. Alternatively, Double-Edge threatens checks like Rotom-W and Kilowattrel. Finally, U-turn allows this reckless bird to pivot into a teammate, if there really is nothing else it can do, such as against Gholdengo or Corviknight. Equipping a Choice Scarf will let it outspeed Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Walking Wake, which otherwise force it out, and threaten them instead.</p> <p>A great partner for Staraptor is Hisuian Zoroark. When it uses Illusion to disguise as Staraptor, pairing its Fighting immunity with Staraptor's Ground immunity, an apparent \"Staraptor\" could be immune to either type. This uncertainty completely dismantles Great Tusk. Furthermore, disguised as Staraptor, it can bait in an unsuspecting Corviknight, Gholdengo, or Dondozo to cripple or OHKO it. Maushold is another great partner thanks to Tidy Up, which keeps both Stealth Rock and Reflect off the field for Staraptor to not worry about. Also, its Population Bomb can break through Ting-Lu and non-Rocky Helmet Toxapex for Staraptor. A less prominent partner that also provides hazard removal, as well as Knock Off support, is Cyclizar. With Stealth Rock breaking Sturdy and further advancing Staraptor's wallbreaking, Blissey is another highly appreciated teammate to set it up, provide Healing Wish and Heal Bell support, and check both Sandy Shocks and Choice Scarf Greninja for Staraptor. Indeedee, likewise, offers Healing Wish support, as well as checking Poison-types like Toxapex and Glimmora that Staraptor struggles with. Lastly, making good use of Staraptor's U-turn, Ditto is a teammate that can turn a bleak situation into a winning one, copying setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Chien-Pao to reverse sweep opponents.</p>"

Earth Power targets Gholdengo, Iron Moth, and Skeledirge, while Earthquake deals more damage to Clodsire and Flutter Mane. Ice Beam hits Dragonite, Garchomp, and Kilowattrel. Alternatively, Clear Smog may be used to prevent Espathra and Dondozo from setting up, while Chilling Water eases matchups against physical attackers such as Quaquaval, Scizor, and Iron Treads. Stealth Rock and Spikes are interchangeable depending on what its teammate Ting-Lu is using. Gastrodon prefers maximum Defense investment to check Pokemon like Barraskewda and Quaquaval; however, an EV spread of 252 HP / 68 Def / 188 SpD with a Bold nature can be used to prevent a 2HKO from Choice Specs Greninja's Ice Beam.</p> <p>Gastrodon's immunity to Water-type attacks and ability to set entry hazards is heavily appreciated by Clodsire, Great Tusk, and Garchomp. Clodsire completes the hazard stack core with Toxic Spikes and answers threats such as Meowscarada and Flutter Mane as well as setup sweepers like Hydreigon, Volcarona, and Gholdengo due to Unaware. Choice Scarf Great Tusk outpaces and deals with threats such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Baxcalibur, and Gallade; furthermore, Great Tusk removes Heavy-Duty Boots from common users like Sableye, Amoonguss, and Brambleghast with Knock Off, enhancing Gastrodon's hazard stacking. Garchomp's Fire-type coverage is valued for threatening roadblocks such as Corviknight, Amoonguss, and Breloom, and Sandy Shocks checks Water-types like Pelipper, Quaquaval, and Slowking as well as Corviknight. Iron Treads removes hazards with Rapid Spin, easing Gastrodon's pivoting if its held item were removed, and checks Fairy-types like Flutter Mane, Mimikyu, and Giga Drain Hatterene. Ting-Lu aids in setting hazards and wears down common pivots with Ruination and Whirlwind, taking advantage of both Pokemon's hazards.</p>"

It proceeds to force them out with its hard hitting Poison Jab-which can spread poison around, while Sucker Punch picks them off should they be weakened enough. Protect is also very valuable in scouting their coverage moves, letting Skuntank accumulate Black Sludge recovery, and stalling out poison damage. Aftermath punishes contact attackers like Kingambit and Azumarill, which allows teammates such as Toxicroak to safely come in and finish them off. Skuntank can run Play Rough to threaten common Dark-types of the metagame, such as Chien-Pao and Hydreigon.</p> <p>Physically defensive Amoonguss and Toxapex are valuable teammates that deal with the physical attackers that threaten Skuntank, like Mimikyu, Quaquaval, and Dondozo. Amoonguss also deals with threatening Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Quagsire, and Sandy Shocks thanks to its good bulk, Grass-type STAB move, and Ground neutrality. Toxapex, on the other hand, deals with threats like Chien-Pao, Cloyster, and Scizor with Infestation and Haze while laying down Toxic Spikes. Specially defensive Clodsire complements Skuntank by dealing with special attackers it can't handle by itself, such as Gholdengo, Magnezone, and Volcarona. Iron Moth deals with the multitude of Steel-types like Gholdengo, Iron Treads, and Corviknight that Skuntank can't do much against.

      "Entry Hazard Support (Dragon)": {
        "description": "<p>Garchomp is a staple of offensive Dragon teams, serving as an unrivaled entry hazard setter, phazer, and threat to key foes such as Iron Treads, Cinderace, Jirachi, and Iron Hands. It excels at getting up multiple layers of entry hazards due to its good bulk and Speed, powerful STAB Earthquake, and access to Rough Skin. The combination of Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet is fantastic for deterring Rapid Spin from foes such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads. It should be noted that if Rapid Spin causes the user to faint due to contact damage, it will not clear entry hazards, making Garchomp particularly adept at keeping hazards up. Moreover, Garchomp has enough bulk to survive an unboosted Ice Spinner from Iron Treads and Quaquaval, so it is relatively unafraid of the metagame’s most common spinners. Outside of warding off spinners, Rocky Helmet + Rough Skin renders Garchomp broadly threatening to physical attackers in general, punishing U-turns from foes such as Sneasler and Cinderace, causing non-Punching Glove Urshifu-R to nearly KO itself from full HP if it uses Surging Strikes on Garchomp, and breaking Dragonite's Multiscale. Dragon Tail rounds out this set by allowing Garchomp to deal good chip damage while forcing out spinners such as Great Tusk and Quaquaval and phazing setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Scizor. The switch forcing capabilities of Dragon Tail synergize incredibly well with this hazard stacking set, enabling Garchomp to rack up entry hazard damage on the opposing team as it repeatedly forces foes out.</p> <p>While Garchomp is excellent at deterring Rapid Spin by itself, Dragapult provides further security for its entry hazards by acting as a true spinblocker. Moreover, Choice Specs Dragapult greatly appreciates Garchomp’s entry hazards pushing foes into KO ranges and punishing switches, bolstering the already formidable offensive pressure these sets create. Dragapult further enjoys Garchomp’s ability to take on Kingambit, Assault Vest Iron Hands, and Alolan Muk, while Garchomp is grateful for Choice Specs Dragapult threatening Corviknight and thus preventing Defog. Alternatively to Choice Specs, Hex Dragapult can also become an extremely threatening late-game cleaner when combined with Garchomp's entry hazards, and the burns it spreads further help accumulate chip damage on the opposing team. Additionally, Dragapult serves as a crucial check to Iron Defense Zamazenta, which Garchomp cannot phaze if it's behind a Substitute. Hisuian Goodra makes a great pairing with Garchomp, being able to soak up the Ice and Fairy moves aimed at Garchomp from foes such as Alolan Ninetales, Flutter Mane, and Iron Valiant while crushing them in return with its Heavy Slam. Hisuian Goodra can also tank a hit from Chien-Pao and OHKO it in retaliation with Body Press, soak up hits from Choice Specs Greninja, and handle opposing Choice Specs Dragapult. In exchange, Garchomp can duel physical threats such as Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Sneasler for Hisuian Goodra. Dragon’s various setup sweepers such as Baxcalibur, Kommo-o, Hydreigon, and Dragonite all greatly value Garchomp’s entry hazards pushing foes into KO ranges and breaking the Focus Sashes of foes such as Ceruledge and Breloom, enabling their sweeps. Of these, Kommo-o is especially notable, as its Vacuum Wave can OHKO Chien-Pao at neutral and Greninja following a Clangorous Soul and Throat Spray boost, both of which are incredibly deadly to Garchomp. Choice Scarf Roaring Moon is a great partner to Garchomp, appreciating Garchomp’s entry hazards and ability to wear down Great Tusk and Iron Treads facilitating its late-game cleaning. Roaring Moon in turn supports Garchomp by smashing through Flutter Mane and opposing Dragapult, as well as opening up foes such as Toxapex and Amoonguss to hazard damage by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots with its brutal STAB Knock Off. Choice Scarf Walking Wake appreciates Garchomp’s entry hazards in the same vein while removing threats such as Landorus, Gliscor, Great Tusk, +1 Baxcalibur, and Chien-Pao. If instead using Choice Specs, Walking Wake’s synergy with Garchomp increases even further, as it can blast through Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and Rotom-W with its powerful STAB attacks and coverage. Walking Wake can also use Flip Turn to pivot Garchomp in against foes such as Toxapex and Alolan Muk. Cyclizar can clear entry hazards from its side of the field while keeping Garchomp’s up with Rapid Spin; it can also prevent Defog from Corviknight and Mandibuzz with Taunt and remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off. Dragalge can compound on Garchomp’s entry hazards with its own Toxic Spikes and use its Fairy neutrality and fierce Adaptability-boosted Poison-type moves to eradicate Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant, Azumarill, and Clefable.</p>"

Its Grass typing provides a way to deal with Water-types such as Azumarill, Basculegion, and Quagsire. Giga Drain is its main STAB move, dealing damage while providing recovery for Abomasnow. Alternatively, it can use Grass Knot in replacement of Giga Drain, allowing it to 2HKO Dondozo. Earth Power allows Abomasnow to hit Steel- and Fire-types, 2HKOing Kingambit and Torkoal and OHKOing offensive Heatran on the switch. The given EV spread allows Abomasnow to outspeed defensive Rotom-W, bulky Gholdengo, and Adamant Azumarill. Abomasnow can run either Icy Rock for more snow turns, which is preferred in Cetitan teams, or Light Clay for more Aurora Veil turns.</p> <p>Cetitan highly appreciates Abomasnow's snow, as it can utilize Slush Rush to outspeed threats such as Iron Moth, Walking Wake, and Iron Treads. With Earthquake, it serves as a good sweeper against Poison, Steel, and Fire teams, which Abomasnow struggles to go against. Other setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Chien-Pao, Frosmoth, Baxcalibur, and Cloyster  enjoy the Defense boost in snow, increasing their survivability and letting them set up and sweep the opposing team. Cloyster is able to survive a Choice Band-boosted Sacred Sword from Chien-Pao under snow and hit it back with a +2 Rock Blast. Baxcalibur is able to survive an Iron Head from Kingambit and 2HKO it with Earthquake. Chien-Pao acts as a strong wallbreaker that appreciates being able to take hits under snow due to its frailty. Frosmoth deals with the Water-type matchup along with Abomasnow, being able to set up a Quiver Dance and sweep the opposing team. The snow also allows the aforementioned setup sweepers to survive revenge killing attempts from foes such as Sucker Punch Kingambit and Extreme Speed Dragonite. Froslass provides team support in Taunt and its own hazards in Spikes, as well as Destiny Bond, which can take out a foe and give Abomasnow a free switch-in. Avalugg's great Defense and access to Rapid Spin make it a great teammate under snow, checking the likes of Kingambit, Iron Treads, and Urshifu-R while also acting as hazard control for its team.</p>"

The EVs allow Gliscor to take Head Smash twice from Choice Scarf Hisuian Arcanine and tank +2 Poltergeist from Ceruledge. U-turn is an alternative over Toxic to preserve momentum and scout switches. 16 Speed EVs can be used instead of 60 to invest more in Gliscor's special bulk while still outspeeding Modest Pelipper and Adamant Scizor, allowing Gliscor to more comfortably duel foes such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Choice Specs Iron Valiant.</p> <h1>Ground</h1> <p>Taunt can be used over Protect to prevent foes such as Iron Defense Zamazenta, Iron Defense Corviknight, and Sinistcha from using Gliscor as a setup opportunity, as well as allow Gliscor to act as a stallbreaker against Quagsire and Corviknight. An EV spread of 244 HP / 116 Def / 132 SpD / 16 Spe with an Impish nature can be used to turn Gliscor into an unparalleled physical wall, allowing it to duel foes such as Meowscarada, Ogerpon-H, and Iron Defense Zamazenta; this spread makes Choice Band Meowscarada's Flower Trick a 3HKO and prevents Gliscor from being OHKOed by Pawmot's Ice Punch. However, this comes with the trade-off of making Gliscor far more vulnerable to special attackers such as Choice Specs Dragapult and Flutter Mane. 148 Speed EVs can be used to allow Gliscor to fly past Dragonite and Adamant Hoopa-U and remove their Choice Bands before they can attack, but this will impinge on Gliscor's bulk.</p> </section>",

      "Entry Hazard Support (Flying)": {
        "description": "<p>Gliscor is one of the best entry hazard setters for Flying teams, owing to its ability, typing and bulk. The combination of Toxic Orb and Poison Heal gives Gliscor excellent passive recovery and immunity to status from moves like Spore from Amoonguss and Will-O-Wisp from Sableye. Furthermore, Gliscor's Ground / Flying type combination gives it an immunity to Electric-type moves like Thunderbolt from Regieleki and Sandy Shocks, which its teammates are weak to, and a neutrality against Rock-type moves like Stone Axe from Kleavor and Stone Edge from Tyranitar. Gliscor's typing combined with Special Defense investment and Poison Heal also allows it to sit on Pokemon such as non-Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Iron Moth that do not have Ice-type or strong Water-type moves. Access to Stealth Rock and Spikes allows Gliscor to wear down walls like Toxapex and Clodsire and fast threats like Greninja and Basculegion-F throughout the game, and Toxic allows it to spread status against bulkier threats like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Mandibuzz, and Ursaluna-B. Taunt pressures Defog users like Corviknight and opposing entry hazard setters like Clefable and Quagsire. Knock Off hits Air Balloon Gholdengo and removes Leftovers from Corviknight. Earthquake offers decent STAB damage against Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon, which are immune to Toxic, like Clodsire and Gholdengo and prevents foes from setting up in Gliscor's presence. Protect helps Gliscor activate its Toxic Orb against faster enemies with access to Knock Off or status-spreading moves. It also allows Gliscor to scout super effective moves like Ice Spinner from Great Tusk and Iron Treads, and diminish Ursaluna-B's Blood Moon PP by using Protect on Blood Moon turns and walling Ursaluna-B on the cooldown, and safely recover HP from Poison Heal. 60 EVs in Speed serve to outspeed Modest Volcanion and Timid Magnezone.</p> <p>Gliscor appreciates teammates like Articuno, which can use Freeze-Dry to force opposing Gliscor and Water-type Pokemon like Manaphy and Walking Wake to switch. In addition to that, Articuno can easily switch into Ice Beam from threats like Greninja and Frosmoth and other special attacks due to its naturally high Special Defense and neutrality to Ice-type attacks. In return, Articuno appreciates Gliscor's ability to threaten Steel- and Fire-types with Earthquake and block Toxic. Articuno also enjoys Gliscor's ability to absorb Knock Off and prevent the removal of Articuno's Heavy-Duty Boots. Iron Defense Corviknight is also a great teammate for Gliscor, as it serves as an answer to Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur. Corviknight's great physical bulk and access to Body Press allow it to comfortably switch into Icicle Crash from these Ice-type Pokemon and force them out with the threat of super effective damage. Corviknight also checks Dragon-type wallbreakers like Dragonite and Dragon Dance or Choice Band Dragapult, which Gliscor may struggle against. Articuno, Corviknight and Gliscor thus synergize well with each other and limit the opponent from sweeping through the team with Gliscor's Electric-type immunity. Gliscor also appreciates teammates like Thundurus-T and Zapdos that serve as an answer to Corviknight and threatening Water-type Pokemon like Barraskewda, Urshifu-R, and Basculegion-F, which cause problems for Gliscor. Thundurus-T and Zapdos in return appreciate Gliscor spreading Toxic and setting entry hazards, as the accumulated chip damage lets them break other Pokemon with ease. Dragonite can switch into Water-type attacks from Pokemon like Choice Band Barraskewda and Urshifu-R. In return, Dragonite appreciates Gliscor's ability to absorb status moves like Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, which can otherwise greatly hamper its wallbreaking ability. Moltres helps Gliscor spread status against various physical threats like Kingambit and Chien-Pao, with the help of Flame Body and Will-O-Wisp while also pivoting in the rest of the team safely with the help of U-turn. Gliscor supports Choice Scarf Enamorus's cleaning ability due to its hazards and status allowing Enamorus to OHKO offensive threats like Choice Specs Greninja and Choice Specs Walking Wake. Gliscor also boosts Enamorus and Galarian Moltres's wallbreaking potential by serving as an answer to their common checks like Alolan Muk, Clodsire, and Galarian Slowking, thus enabling them to sweep late-game. Gyarados pairs well with Gliscor, as it can act like a check for Urshifu-R, Baxcalibur, and Chien-Pao, owing to its type combination and Intimidate ability. Gyarados can also rack up entry hazard damage with Dragon Tail, thus working well with Gliscor's entry hazards. Landorus is also a great teammate for Gliscor, as it can run Stealth Rock to allow Gliscor to run Spikes instead and threatens physical walls such as Galarian Weezing, Kommo-o, and Great Tusk with its coverage.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance (Ground)": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Gliscor is an excellent bulky sweeper for Ground teams, being able to use its superb bulk, status immunity, and Poison Heal recovery to easily set up Swords Dance multiple times and quickly snowball against more passive team archetypes such as Steel, Poison, Water stall, and opposing Ground. Knock Off serves as Gliscor’s secondary attacking move to accompany Earthquake, hitting targets immune to Earthquake such as Landorus and Air Balloon Gholdengo while also removing foes’ items, cutting off foes such as Corviknight and Galarian Weezing from Leftovers or Black Sludge recovery and offensively neutering threats like Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant. Alternatively, Facade can be used as a strong neutral coverage option that smacks Enamorus, Galarian Moltres, and Galarian Weezing; however, running Facade means that Gliscor will be walled by Air Balloon Gholdengo and will be unable to remove foes' items. Protect allows Gliscor to safely use Poison Heal to recover while scouting foes’ moves, which can be especially useful against Choice item users such as Iron Moth, Dragapult, and Dragonite. Additionally, Protect is particularly valuable against Ursaluna-B, as Gliscor can void its Blood Moon and use the following turn to set up Swords Dance. The given EVs maximize Gliscor’s Poison Heal recovery, allow Gliscor to outrun Modest Pelipper and Adamant Scizor, and maximize its ability to duel special attackers such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Ursaluna-B, and Choice Specs Dragapult.</p> <p>Clodsire is an extremely useful teammate to Gliscor due to its Water immunity via Water Absorb, serving as a crucial check to foes such as Walking Wake, Urshifu-R, and Basculegion-F. Moreover, Clodsire can offer Gliscor Toxic Spikes support, which synergizes brilliantly with Gliscor’s Protect and makes Gliscor even more threatening as a sweeper. In return, Gliscor can absorb burns and Knock Off for Clodsire, deal with threats such as Landorus, Hatterene, and Iron Treads without Ice Spinner, and provide a Ground immunity to counteract Clodsire's weakness. Mamoswine complements Gliscor excellently by offering an Ice resistance to compensate for Gliscor’s weakness, and with a Choice Band it can easily take care of impediments to Gliscor such as Corviknight, Articuno, and Dragonite. In exchange, Gliscor can absorb burns from foes such as Sableye and Moltres and offer a Fighting resistance to answer foes like Iron Valiant and Sneasler. Ursaluna-B is another great pairing to Gliscor, acting as a special wallbreaker that can blast through physical walls such as Quagsire, Dondozo, and Slowbro. Furthermore, with Vacuum Wave, Ursaluna-B can act as a check to Chien-Pao, and if using Calm Mind, it can overwhelm Corviknight variants that do not use Iron Defense. Gliscor returns the favor by taking on Iron Valiant, Choice Band Zamazenta, and Assault Vest Iron Hands for Ursaluna-B. Ursaluna-B can additionally tackle Hex Dragapult and Spectrier, which are otherwise very deadly to Gliscor. Landorus is another option for a special wallbreaker that can use Gravity to ground and threaten Corviknight. As another option, Landorus can also run a Choice Scarf, threatening Ogerpon-W, Chien-Pao, and Zamazenta and providing safe entry for Gliscor with U-turn. Choice Scarf Great Tusk can revenge kill Chien-Pao and can also handle Baxcalibur, Hisuian Samurott, Hydreigon. With Ice Spinner, Great Tusk can further eliminate Dragonite and Swords Dance Garchomp and, if using Megahorn, tear through Ogerpon-W. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Iron Treads can additionally beat Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur while also OHKOing Alolan Ninetales, Flutter Mane, and Enamorus. Quagsire can serve as a defensive answer to key menaces to Gliscor such as Azumarill and Swords Dance Chien-Pao and stack entry hazards to facilitate Gliscor’s sweep. Sandy Shocks can zap Corviknight and Slowbro for Gliscor, provide Gliscor with safe entry points with Volt Switch, and layer entry hazards for Gliscor.</p>"

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Ice</h1> <p>If dropping Smack Down in favor of Icicle Crash, a more offensively oriented EV spread can be used due to the given EVs being only particularly useful when running Smack Down. In particular, 252 Speed EVs allow Mamoswine to outspeed and smash slower Gholdengo sets. Knock Off is a decent choice that allows Mamoswine to open up Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Skeledirge and Toxapex to hazard damage, but it is difficult to fit over generally more useful alternatives.</p> <h1>Ground</h1> <p>Stone Edge slices through Articuno, Moltres, and Baxcalibur. A Jolly nature lets Mamoswine outrun maximum Speed Heatran and Cloyster and Speed tie with maximum Speed Hoopa-U and Gallade at the cost of considerable power, no longer guaranteeing a 2HKO on Quagsire for instance. Heavy Slam can make Galarian Weezing an unsafe switch-in as well as OHKO Hatterene.</p> </section>",
    "sets": {
      "Entry Hazard Support (Ice)": {
        "description": "<p>Mamoswine is a staple pick for Ice teams, offering many useful traits, including a Fire neutrality via its ability Thick Fat, an Electric immunity that nullifies Thunder Wave and Volt Switch, and access to Stealth Rock. Mamoswine's primary attacking move is its strong STAB Earthquake, allowing it to threaten bulky Steel-types such as Heatran, Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, and Magnezone, which is of great importance for Ice. Mamoswine's Earthquake finds further use as Ice's best way of dealing with Iron Hands, Toxapex, and Okidogi. Ice Shard lets Mamoswine circumvent its middling Speed and pick off weakened offensive threats such as Dragapult, Dragonite, Meowscarada, and Enamorus, as well as OHKO Landorus after Stealth Rock. Smack Down gives Mamoswine the capacity to threaten Corviknight with its powerful Earthquake and force it out, making it adept at keeping Stealth Rock up against Flying teams by making it difficult for Corviknight to use Defog. Smack Down provides further utility by allowing Mamoswine to ground and threaten Zapdos, 2HKO Articuno, and crucially OHKO defensively uninvested Volcarona. As an alternative to Smack Down, Icicle Crash can be used as a broadly powerful Ice-type STAB move that allows Mamoswine to better pressure targets such as Mandibuzz, Ursaluna-B, and Amoonguss, at the cost of making the Flying matchup more difficult. The given EVs render physically defensive Corviknight's Body Press a 3HKO against Mamoswine after Leftovers recovery while maximizing attack power, making Mamoswine much more effective at threatening Corviknight. Furthermore, they allow Mamoswine to live a +1 Flamethrower from offensive Volcarona and OHKO it in return with Smack Down, as well as outpace Adamant Kingambit and Iron Hands.</p> <p>Baxcalibur forms a fantastic offensive core with Mamoswine, providing a burn immunity via Thermal Exchange and a resistance to Water to compensate for Mamoswine's weaknesses. To complement Baxcalibur, Mamoswine sets Stealth Rock and removes bulky Steel-types, such as Empoleon and Corviknight, in order to pave the way for Baxcalibur's sweeping or wallbreaking. Alolan Ninetales pairs excellently with Mamoswine, setting snow and Aurora Veil to improve Mamoswine's defenses even further and dealing with the Fighting-types that threaten Mamoswine such as Urshifu-R and Iron Valiant. In return, Mamoswine can comfortably take Heavy Slams aimed at Alolan Ninetales under snow and threaten their users, including Hisuian Goodra, Iron Hands, and Iron Treads. Froslass can set Spikes to compound the offensive pressure that Mamoswine's Stealth Rock creates while also serving as a Fighting immunity and a spinblocker. Chien-Pao appreciates Mamoswine's Stealth Rock bringing foes down to KO ranges and breaking Ceruledge's Focus Sash to enable its sweeping and wallbreaking; it supports Mamoswine in turn by threatening problematic foes such as Gholdengo and Spectrier, as well as Ogerpon-H and Ogerpon-W if using Choice Band. Frosmoth similarly benefits from Mamoswine setting Stealth Rock and breaking Steel-types such as Heatran, while it threatens physical walls such as Quagsire and Great Tusk in exchange. Alolan Sandslash can neutralize Toxic from foes such as Toxapex aimed at Mamoswine, threaten Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, and use Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Amoonguss and Toxapex and open them up to being chipped by Stealth Rock. Moreover, both Alolan Sandslash and Avalugg can help prevent Mamoswine from being worn down by entry hazards by spinning them away. Cetitan and Cloyster are other sweepers on Ice to accompany Baxcalibur that benefit from the offensive pressure that Mamoswine's Stealth Rock creates. Cloyster greatly appreciates Mamoswine's Electric immunity, and Cetitan can only OHKO Corviknight at +6 after Stealth Rock.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band (Ground)": {
        "description": "<p>Mamoswine is a great offensive option for Ground teams thanks to its huge Attack stat, access to priority, and unique STAB combination. Mamoswine's ability, Thick Fat, also allows for it to act as an extremely valuable resistance to Ice, meaning it can switch into foes like Articuno. Icicle Crash shreds Grass-type Pokemon, such as Amoonguss and Sinistcha, and Flying-type Pokemon, such as Mandibuzz and Gliscor, that would otherwise resist or be immune to Ground-type moves. Icicle Crash is extremely threatening to Flying-type teams in particular, as most Flying-type Pokemon are 2HKOed by Icicle Crash, meaning there are no safe switchins. Ice Shard is a fantastic priority move that allows Mamoswine to stand its ground against faster Pokemon such as both Landorus formes, Cyclizar, Meowscarada, and Dragapult. Knock Off is a good final option to help deal with walls that may take a bit more time to whittle down, such as Dondozo and Corviknight, as well as create permanent progress against Pokemon such as Baxcalibur and Articuno, which both rely heavily on their items, whether it be offensively or defensively.</p> <p>Mamoswine greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon like Quagsire, as the extra damage could be the difference between a 2HKO or an opportunity for an OHKO on lots of Pokemon such as Flutter Mane and Meowscarada with Ice Shard, Icicle Crash on Corviknight, and Earthquake on Toxapex and Amoonguss. Clodsire is a good teammate for Mamoswine, as it can switch in to Water- and Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Sneasler, and Walking Wake that would otherwise make quick work of Mamoswine, as well as provide Toxic and entry hazard support. Iron Treads is another good teammate for Mamoswine, as it keeps hazards off the field in order to prevent Mamoswine from being chipped down, as well as setts up hazards of its own. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Iron Treads outspeeds and hits Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane, which both threaten Mamoswine, for super effective damage. Choice Scarf Great Tusk is another teammate that pairs well with Mamoswine. Great Tusk is able to outspeed and OHKO Pokemon that check Mamoswine such as Choice Specs Greninja and Cinderace. Once faster threats have been taken care of, Mamoswine will have an easy time breaking the opposing team with its extremely powerful attacks. Ursaluna-B is a great teammate for Mamoswine, as it can absorb status conditions from Pokemon like Rotom-W and Sableye, as well as threatening them back with its extremely powerful Blood Moon. Ursaluna-B is also capable of using Vacuum wave to snipe Chien-Pao. Gliscor can also absorb status moves, as well as absorbing status moves and Fighting-type attacks that Mamoswine does not want to deal with. Gliscor is also able to support Mamoswine with Spikes and Toxic. Landorus forms a potent offensive core with Mamoswine, destroying Physical walls such as Quagsire and Slowbro, while Mamoswine deals with special walls such as Gliscor and Gastrodon. Additionally, Landorus can set Gravity for Mamoswine so that it can freely spam Earthquake. Lastly, Sandy Shocks is capable of dealing with Pokemon such as Pelipper and Corviknight, as well as providing hazard and Gravity support. Mamoswine easily takes care of the Ground-types that would wall Sandy Shocks.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Gallade is the premier Choice Scarf user on Psychic teams due to its great coverage options and incredible ability, Sharpness. Being able to fire off Sharpness-boosted Sacred Sword is incredibly valuable, as it hits the Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon that give Psychic teams trouble for super effective damage, such as Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Hisuian Goodra. Knock Off is a great way to make progress against bulkier teams, as well as dissuade Ghost-type Pokemon from switching in on a potential Sacred Sword. Night Slash is also an option to deal more consistent damage to Skeledirge and Gholdengo. Leaf Blade is used to threaten bulky Water-type Pokemon like Quagsire and Rotom-W, as well as OHKO Belly Drum Azumarill. Aqua Cutter is an option over Leaf Blade to hit Pokemon like Landorus, Volcarona and Moltres for super effective damage, but Leaf Blade is often better due to the amount of targets it hits. A Jolly nature is preferred over Adamant, as it allows Gallade to outspeed and still OHKO Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Sneasler, while the extra attack from Adamant is not necessary as most of the moves Gallade uses receive a Sharpness boost.</p> <p>Espathra is a nice compliment to Gallade, as it appreciates Gallade's ability to deal with Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon like Gholdengo, Hisuian Goodra, Kingambit, and Ting-Lu, which Espathra has little way of hitting for even neutral damage, as well as its ability to remove special walls such as Galarian Slowking and Alolan Muk. Hoopa-U is also a great teammate for Gallade, as the speed of Gallade and sheer power of Hoopa-U synergize nicely to deal with both bulky and fast teams. Hoopa-U is able to threaten an OHKO on defensive staples such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, and Rotom-W with entry hazard support, while Gallade outspeeds Pokemon that would otherwise shut Hoopa-U down, such as Sneasler and Greninja. Armarouge is a strong partner for Gallade, as it provides a nice resistance to Fairy-type attacks and complementary coverage to Gallade's. Armarouge appreciates the removal of special walls such as Hisuian Goodra and Galarian Slowking, allowing it to set up and apply pressure to the opposing team, and it returns the favor by taking out physically bulky foes such as Dondozo, Zamazenta, and Corviknight. Hatterene is Psychic teams' best form of hazard control, which Gallade appreciates as it tends to switch in frequently and can otherwise get chipped. Hatterene also lures in Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon like Iron Treads and Sneasler, which Gallade can take care of. Indeedee is another good teammate for Gallade, as it sets up Psychic Terrain, further strengthening Gallade's Psycho Cut and protecting it from priority moves like Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch. Indeedee also provides a valuable Ghost immunity, which prevents foes like Flutter Mane and Gholdengo from freely spamming Shadow Ball. Scream Tail is a great defensive teammate for Gallade, as its incredible bulk allows it to switch in to common Choice Scarf users such as Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Meowscarada, which would otherwise outspeed and OHKO Gallade. Scream Tail's access to a myriad of utility moves, such as Thunder Wave and Wish, allows it to support Gallade nicely by slowing down the aforementioned threats and increasing its longevity. Mew is a good teammate for Gallade on more offense-oriented teams, as lead Mew is the premier hazard setter for Psychic teams, and Gallade greatly appreciates the support. Galarian Slowking is a great teammate for Gallade as well, as it is able to safely switch into special attacks, as well as Fairy-type attacks that would otherwise give Gallade trouble. Galarian Slowking can also utilize Chilly Reception to give Gallade a free switch in.</p>"

Taunt prevents hazards and status from foes such as Toxapex, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, and is also used to deny Defog from Corviknight or Talonflame. However, it must be careful as most Corviknight and Talonflame can simply attack Froslass for super effective damage. When paired with Focus Sash, Taunt increases the chances of Froslass taking an opponent down with Destiny Bond, but it can also be used in tandem with Mental Herb to punish opponents like Sableye, Grimmsnarl, and opposing Froslass that attempt to Taunt Froslass, Taunting them in return. Spikes serves to punish switches on the opponent's side and weaken their team, allowing for Froslass's teammates to clean late-game. Shadow Ball is Froslass's answer to Hatterene, 2HKOing it as it comes in to bounce Spikes back, and it's Froslass's main source of damage to prevent it from being too passive. Froslass's last moveslot can utilize Destiny Bond to take an opponent down with it, but Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are also options to consider as they allow you to status Pokemon that like to play around Destiny Bond, such as Kingambit and Volcarona. Focus Sash is the preferred item as it ensures that Froslass will always get at least one layer of Spikes up, but Mental Herb can also be used to ignore Taunt from faster leads while Heavy Duty-Boots allows Froslass to safely switch back in to block spinners such as Cyclizar and Quaquaval.</p> <p>All of Froslass's teammates appreciate it spreading Spikes on the opposing field and preventing hazards from going up on theirs. After Spikes, Choice Band Chien Pao 2HKOes Iron Hands, while Shell Smash Cloyster and Belly Drum Cetitan can attempt to set up and sweep without fear of getting stopped by an opposing Focus Sash. Baxcalibur benefits from Froslass paralyzing faster threats like Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, enabling it to outspeed and take them out, though Froslass needs an intact Focus Sash for this. Similarily, Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and Iron Defense Avalugg also benefit from the opportunities to set up against foes that have been burned by Froslass and no longer pose much of a threat to it. Avalugg can also support Froslass by switching into strong physical attacks to scout. Abomasnow's Snow Warning increases Froslass's physical bulk and makes it less wary of other attacks coming from spinners, such as Great Tusk's Knock Off.</p>"

  "Heatran": {
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive (Steel)": {
        "description": "<p>Specially defensive Heatran is an invaluable part of any Steel team. It is a fantastic check to many metagame staples that Steel would greatly struggle to otherwise deal with, such as Volcarona, Corviknight, Skeledirge, Zapdos, and Iron Moth. It serves Steel teams consistently well even outside of these problem matchups due to its great natural bulk, plethora of useful resistances including a crucial immunity to Fire via Flash Fire, and utility for its team through its access to Stealth Rock and capacity to spread burns.</p> <p>Lava Plume is Heatran’s primary attacking move, which not only hits neutral targets hard due to Heatran’s naturally good Special Attack but also has a 30% chance to burn foes. Fire’s nature as an attacking type that has no natural immunities means Heatran can use Lava Plume many times throughout the course of a game to generate progress with minimal risk. The burn chance of Lava Plume makes Heatran incredibly risky for foes to switch into, as physical attackers such as Great Tusk that could threaten a KO on Heatran do not want to risk the possibility of being burned and having their offensive power crippled. Furthermore, walls such as Toxapex also fear being burned, as the passive damage will affect their longevity over the course of a game. Earth Power is the only coverage necessary for Heatran, giving it the capability to easily break through foes such as Skeledirge and Iron Moth. It is notable that an EV spread including 56 Special Attack EVs will allow Heatran to OHKO offensive opposing Heatran with Earth Power. Heatran serves as an excellent setter of Stealth Rock due to its propensity to easily force switches against Pokemon such as Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Amoonguss. Protect rounds out Heatran’s moveset, not only giving it the chance to extend its longevity via Leftovers and accumulate burn damage on foes but also the capability to scout foes’ movesets, which can be especially useful when facing off against foes using Choice items. One should be careful when using Protect not to fall into predictable patterns and give foes the chance to set up on Heatran, however. Magma Storm can be used instead of Lava Plume to trap and eliminate foes such as Toxapex and force damage against bulky threats such as Iron Hands; the passive damage synergizes well with Protect, but Magma Storm's low PP and accuracy makes it less consistent throughout longer games. Taunt is an option that can be used place of Stealth Rock that synergizes particularly well with Magma Storm, preventing foes from using recovery moves, getting entry hazards up, or setting up on Heatran. However, a lack of Speed investment means it will have somewhat limited utility. As another option to Stealth Rock, Power Gem easily OHKOes Moltres, which walls Heatran otherwise, and prevents bulky Volcarona sets from outlasting Heatran. Alternatively, Will-O-Wisp can be used over Stealth Rock in conjunction with an investment of 40 Speed EVs to allow Heatran to outspeed and burn maximum Speed Adamant Kingambit. If desired, it is also possible to run one of the aforementioned alternative options of Taunt, Power Gem, or Will-O-Wisp instead of Protect, but this comes at the cost of significantly impacting Heatran's longevity and foregoing Protect's scouting utility.</p> <p>Heatran serves as one of the three pillars of Steel’s “immunity trinity” along with Corviknight and Gholdengo; combined, these three offer immunities to Steel’s core weaknesses of Fire, Ground, and Fighting, forming an excellent defensive backbone for any Steel team. Corviknight is Heatran’s most important partner, being able to nullify Ground moves targeted at Heatran while Heatran in turn blocks Fire moves aimed at Corviknight. Furthermore, Corviknight can also threaten prominent Fighting-types in the metagame such as Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Sneasler with its STAB Brave Bird. With a physically defensive pivot set, Corviknight further synergizes with specially defensive Heatran by being able to soak up physical hits while Heatran takes special ones, having the ability to remove opposing Stealth Rock and Spikes to prevent Heatran from being worn down by entry hazards over the course of a game and providing Heatran with opportunities to switch in safely via U-turn. Bulk Up Corviknight appreciates Heatran too, as Stealth Rock and burn support can increase its sweeping potential. Gholdengo completes the immunity trinity by voiding Fighting moves aimed at Heatran. Gholdengo can further support Heatran by blocking Corrosion Toxic from Glimmora thanks to Good as Gold; this ability combined with Gholdengo's Ghost typing also lets it completely prevent the removal of Heatran's Stealth Rock, as Gholdengo blocks both Rapid Spin and Defog. With an Air Balloon, Gholdengo can block Ground-type moves and use Nasty Plot to break through walls, both of which Heatran appreciates. Alternatively, using a Choice Scarf, Gholdengo can switch into Enamorus and outspeed and OHKO it in return, and it can use Trick to cripple opposing special walls such as Toxapex and Blissey or lock sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragonite into setup moves to prevent them from exploiting Heatran. Outside of the immunity trinity, Hisuian Goodra also makes a good pairing with Heatran due to its unique Water resistance on Steel and capacity to threaten opposing Water-types such as Basculegion-F and Greninja with Thunderbolt. Hisuian Goodra can also check Hydreigon and Walking Wake, which both wall and exploit Heatran. Moreover, Hisuian Goodra can act as a switch-in to opposing Heatran and threaten it with Earthquake, and it is able to survive an Earth Power from Landorus and OHKO it in return with Ice Beam if necessary. Iron Treads can spin away hazards for Heatran without removing Heatran’s Stealth Rock, set Stealth Rock itself to free Heatran to use other moves if desired, and serve as an offensive check to Sandy Shocks with its STAB Earthquake as well as Landorus with Ice Spinner, which Heatran’s other teammates can struggle to handle. Physical sweepers such as Kingambit and Scizor are grateful for Heatran’s ability to absorb Will-O-Wisp for them, and they can clean up teams Heatran has worn down with Stealth Rock and chip damage. Klefki can complement Heatran's Stealth Rock with its own Spikes while taking advantage of Heatran's Fire immunity, which can help break down opposing teams faster as they switch around to deal with the immunity trinity. It should be noted that this is by no means an exhaustive list of potential teammates for Heatran; all Steel-type Pokemon in the metagame appreciate Heatran’s Fire immunity, and no Pokemon currently competes with Heatran in this regard.</p>"

  "Samurott-Hisui": {
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf (Water)": {
        "description": "<p>Hisuian Samurott is one of Water’s best options for a Choice Scarf user. This is owed to its great STAB combination, of which both types are resisted by only a scant few Pokemon in the metagame, higher power than what is initially apparent due to Sharpness bolstering its slicing moves, a good Speed tier that allows it to outspeed and revenge kill key threats such as Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and unique progress-making utility for Water in the form of Ceaseless Edge and Knock Off.</p> <p>Ceaseless Edge is Hisuian Samurott’s most important move, allowing it not only to threaten and KO foes with the raw power of a Sharpness-boosted Dark-type STAB move but also set up a layer of Spikes with each use, putting pressure on opposing teams and potentially opening up holes in defensive cores for its teammates to exploit. It is important to note that Spikes laid by Ceaseless Edge cannot be reflected by Magic Bounce, meaning Hisuian Samurott can safely click Ceaseless Edge against Hatterene and still get Spikes up. Hisuian Samurott’s secondary STAB move is a choice between Aqua Cutter and Razor Shell. Aqua Cutter is generally preferred for its consistency due it not making contact with the opponent and its perfect accuracy, allowing Hisuian Samurott to safely deal with Volcarona and Moltres. However, Razor Shell is guaranteed to OHKO Flutter Mane and provides Hisuian Samurott with more wallbreaking capability due to its 50% chance to reduce Defense if the user is willing to tolerate the risk of missing. Sacred Sword serves as an excellent coverage option, allowing Hisuian Samurott to eliminate foes such as Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and opposing Hisuian Samurott. Finally, Knock Off provides Hisuian Samurott with a secondary utility in the form of item removal, which can cripple Leftovers users such as Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Toxapex and open up Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Amoonguss to being chipped down by entry hazards, making Hisuian Samurott even riskier for foes to switch into.</p> <p>In terms of teammates, physically defensive Rotom-W is an excellent partner for Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott, checking several of Hisuian Samurott’s bad matchups such as Azumarill, Garchomp, and Scarf Great Tusk and providing Hisuian Samurott with safe opportunities to come in via Volt Switch. Toxapex is another great teammate for Hisuian Samurott, being able to switch into and take hits repeatedly from faster Choice Scarf users such as Sneasler, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant thanks to its defensive typing coupled with Regenerator and Recover. Moreover, Toxapex can serve as an answer to Urshifu-R and can compound on the pressure of Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes with its own Toxic Spikes, while benefitting itself from Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes punishing foes switching around. Gastrodon or Quagsire can absorb Electric-type moves for Hisuian Samurott and set up Stealth Rock to compliment Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes. Wallbreakers such as Urshifu-R, Greninja, Basculegion-M, and Walking Wake as well as sweepers such as Basculegion-F also synergize well with Hisuian Samurott, with Spikes support allowing them to more easily break through enemy teams and the speed control from Choice Scarf meaning potential revenge killers can be removed ahead of time. The speed control from Choice Scarf is still useful even on rain teams even when accompanied by Swift Swim Pokemon such as Basculegion-F, as rain will not always be present on the battlefield. Furthermore, either forme of Basculegion can serve as a spinblocker to prevent the removal of Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes.</p>"

      "Victory Dance (Fighting)": {
        "description": "<p>Hisuian Lilligant is a strong choice on Fighting teams because of its ability to clean up games thanks to its signature move, Victory Dance, and being a great asset in the Ground, Water, and Flying matchups, which Fighting teams can struggle against. Leaf Blade 2HKOes Toxapex at +1 and threatens Water's two Unaware Pokemon, Dondozo and Quagsire. Close Combat hits Ice- and Steel-types trying to switch into Hisuian Lilligant's Grass STAB move, as well as having a favorable roll to OHKO both Corviknight and Hisuian Goodra at +1. Finally, Ice Spinner hits Dragon- and Flying-types such as Dragonite and Thundurus-T, as well as Unaware Clodsire on Ground. Wide Lens is used to reduce the accuracy drop from Hustle. Sleep Powder can be run to give Hisuian Lilligant more setup opportunities, but the loss of coverage in Ice Spinner or STAB in Close Combat is notable.</p> <p>Great Tusk is a great teammate for Hisuian Lilligant, as it threatens out Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and the Poison-types that can stop a Hisuian Lilligant sweep. Great Tusk can soften up Hisuian Lilligant's checks by setting Stealth Rock. In return, Hisuian Lilligant uses Water-types such as Hisuian Samurott and Quagsire, which threaten Great Tusk, as setup opportunities. Iron Valiant can break through common checks to Hisuian Lilligant such as the aforementioned Skeledirge and Gholdengo thanks to either Shadow Ball on special sets or Knock Off on mixed ones. Sneasler is a secondary sweeper that can also threaten Fairy-types such as Enamorus-T. Its Choice Scarf set can also beat Volcarona, which can use Hisuian Lilligant as setup fodder, with Rock Slide and use Switcheroo to hinder defensive walls trying to switch in. Iron Hands uses its insane bulk, bolstered by Assault Vest, to sponge special attacks very easily from Pokemon such as Zapdos and Hatterene. It also hits Flying-types hard with its Electric STAB moves, and can pivot Hisuian Lilligant in with Volt Switch. In return, Hisuian Lilligant breaks the Ground-types that threaten both Iron Hands and Sneasler. Finally, Zamazenta takes physical attacks well with Dauntless Shield and can threaten Ghost-types that Hisuian Lilligant struggles to break with Crunch. Its Iron Defense sets also do well against Steel, where Hisuian Lilligant is less effective.</p>"
      },
      "Victory Dance Sweeper (Grass)": {
        "description": "<p>Hisuian Lilligant is a solid late-game sweeper for Grass teams thanks to Victory Dance in conjunction with Hustle. It can deal out considerable damage to some of the meta's bulkiest Pokemon such as Corviknight and Iron Hands and is the best wincon on Grass in order to beat Flying. Ice Spinner allows Hisuian Lilligant to threaten opposing Dragon- and Flying-types like Enamorus, Galarian Zapdos, and Dragapult, as well as opposing Ground-types like Clodsire and Great Tusk if it does not run Leaf Blade. Sleep Powder is often preferred over Leaf Blade to give Hisuian Lilligant an easier chance to set up, and the combination of Ice Spinner and Close Combat still targets a good portion of the metagame. However, Leaf Blade can be used to target Pokemon that resist Ice Spinner and Close Combat such as Toxapex and Azumarill. Wide Lens allows Hisuian Lilligant to offset the accuracy drop of its attacks due to Hustle and it also boosts the accuracy of Sleep Powder, making it a more consistent option to use in order to set up safely.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Meowscarada is a great teammate that threatens faster Dragon-types like Dragapult and Walking Wake, while Hisuian Lilligant is able to beat bulky Steel-types like Hisuian Goodra and Corviknight that Meowscarada often lures in. Amoonguss is Hisuian Lilligant's best defensive partner, as its Poison typing helps it deal with opposing Fairy-types like Azumarill, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant and also removes Toxic Spikes. Amoonguss appreciates Hisuian Lilligant's ability to dispatch opposing Flying-types like Corviknight, which can render it setup fodder, and can also assist Hisuian Lilligant's setup using Spore. Iron Leaves is another offensive partner for Hisuian Lilligant that can threaten opposing Poison-types which Lilligant cannot break through like Toxapex. Iron Leaves appreciates Hisuian Lilligant being able to threaten opposing Dark-type Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Kingambit. Brambleghast offers hazard support with Spikes, allowing Hisuian Lilligant to have secure KOs on Pokemon like Alolan Muk. Furthermore, Brambleghast offers hazard removal with Rapid Spin, which improves Hisuian Lilligant's longevity by giving it more opportunities to switch in. Zarude is also an offensive partner that is able to threaten Gholdengo and also Skeledirge, which gives Grass teams a tough time in the Ghost matchup. Furthermore, its ability to threaten Poison's defensive staples like Clodsire, Toxapex, and Alolan Muk after a boost is appreciated. Rotom-C helps Hisuian Lilligant threaten key members Water teams if it opts not to use Leaf Blade, like Pelipper and Basculegion, while Hisuian Lilligant can threaten Thundurus-T so Rotom can threaten Flying teams easier.</p>"

        "outdated": true,
        "description": "<p>Hisuian Zoroark is essential on Ghost teams due to its immunity to opposing Ghost-type moves, favorable Speed, and unique ability. It is an incredible asset in the Ghost matchup, as it allows you to play mind games against an opponent using Flutter Mane and Dragapult by disguising itself as Gholdengo and takes advantage of Substitute by forcing a lot of switches. Hex in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp deals superb damage against threats like Flutter Mane, Amoonguss, and Quagsire and negates passive recovery on walls such as Corviknight, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu. Furthermore, Will-O-Wisp lets you play around Sucker Punch users like Kingambit and burns other physical attackers such as Scizor that pose a threat to teammates like Flutter Mane and Mimikyu. Knock Off further cripples the aforementioned walls and removes Heavy-Duty Boots from foes, enhancing Brambleghast's Spikes, while Nasty Plot allows Hisuian Zoroark to capitalize on Substitute and use passive walls such as Toxapex, Brambleghast, and Dragalge as setup fodder. Leftovers and 252 HP EVs let Hisuian Zoroark take full advantage of Substitute and potentially sustain a few neutral attacks.</p> <p>Flutter Mane appreciates Hisuian Zoroark luring in walls like Clodsire, Gastrodon, and Amoonguss and wearing them down with Hex and Will-O-Wisp. In return, it removes threatening Dark-types like Chien-Pao, Greninja, and Iron Jugulis. Dragapult checks Hydreigon, Baxcalibur, and Gholdengo and pivots into Hisuian Zoroark with U-turn. Gholdengo threatens Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant, Hatterene, and Flutter Mane and supports Hisuian Zoroark's Hex with Thunder Wave. Hisuian Zoroark also likes to disguise itself as the previously mentioned Dragapult and Gholdengo due to them also using Substitute and Hex, potentially tricking opponents and forming a very formidable Hex spam core. Mimikyu aids against Dark-types like Kingambit and Roaring Moon and provides useful priority in Shadow Sneak. Additionally, Mimikyu appreciates Hisuian Zoroark withering down and burning the majority of opposing teams, letting Mimikyu clean up late-game without any complications. Brambleghast helps Hisuian Zoroark chip down opposing teams with Spikes, removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin, and checks Water-types such as Rotom-W, Slowking, and Barraskewda. Skeledirge walls setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Mimikyu as well as general threats like Iron Valiant, Scizor, and Magnezone.</p>"

Additionally, it can win the Ghost matchup with good prediction, which is a type that Normal teams usually struggle against. Trick lets Hisuian Zoroark ruin defensive answers, such as Toxapex and Ting-Lu, that would otherwise take its attacks with ease. Flamethrower allows Hisuian Zoroark to hit Steel-types like Corviknight and Iron Treads more reliably than Focus Blast, while Grass Knot hits Dondozo, which would otherwise take Hisuian Zoroark's attacks. Focus Blast lets Hisuian Zoroark eliminate troublesome Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Ting-Lu. Illusion lets Hisuian Zoroark bait in defensive answers to other threats, such as Corviknight and Toxapex switching into Maushold, and hinder them with Trick while also giving it a safe opportunity to switch into Fighting-type attacks.</p> <p>Maushold greatly appreciates Hisuian Zoroark's ability to remove Ghost- and Steel-types, alongside its ability to hinder and remove Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Toxapex and Corviknight, to enable it to clean up with Population Bomb. In return, Maushold can remove entry hazards with Tidy Up and break through answers to Hisuian Zoroark such as the aforementioned Toxapex and Ting-Lu. Choice Scarf Staraptor is another great partner, as it provides a safe switch-in to Choice Scarf Great Tusk, which tends to lock into Headlong Rush, while dealing high amounts of damage itself to enable Hisuian Zoroark to clean up the rest of an opponent's team. It also provides a form of speed control against faster threats such as Dragapult. Cyclizar also provides a safe switch-in with Shed Tail while keeping hazards off the field with Rapid Spin. In return, Hisuian Zoroark can use these switch-in opportunities to hit the aforementioned Steel-types hard. Ditto can turn setup attempts on a Choice-locked Hisuian Zoroark on their heads, while Blissey can take strong special hits such as Sandy Shocks's STAB moves. Indeedee provides Psychic Terrain support to improve Hisuian Zoroark's matchup against Kingambit, and it can also use a Choice Scarf to deal with fast threats such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Flamigo and provide Healing Wish support.</p>"

Growth lets Amoonguss threaten Ground teams by breaking through Water Absorb Clodsire after enough boosts. Alternatively, Toxic or Spore may be used to double Stomping Tantrum's power against Steel- and Poison-types like Gholdengo and Gengar that can pivot into Amoonguss and use it as setup fodder. Giga Drain and Synthesis provide Amoonguss with ample recovery to sustain itself in the Water and Ground matchups. A Relaxed nature is used to not dampen the power of Amoonguss's Stomping Tantrum, while Defense EVs are prioritized to help against physical Ground-types like Choice Scarf Great Tusk and Iron Treads.</p> <p>Toxapex forms an effective physically defensive Regenerator core alongside Amoonguss, as it deals with Fire- and Ice-types such as Paldean Tauros-F and Chien-Pao that give Amoonguss trouble while wearing down the opposing team with a combination of Toxic Spikes and Rocky Helmet. Skuntank deals with Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Espathra and Flutter Mane and uses Sucker Punch to pick off threats such as Dragapult late-game. It can also run Fire Spin to trap and forcibly remove Hatterene—a Pokemon that greatly threatens Amoonguss and prevents Skuntank from setting Toxic Spikes against Fairy and Psychic teams with ease. Unaware Clodsire is a specially defensive wall that deals with nearly all special attackers including Volcarona, Hydreigon, and non-Psyshock Flutter Mane. It also sets Spikes, which Amoonguss benefits from due to its ability to force switches, and is able to heavily damage Kingambit in a pinch. Glimmora provides entry hazard support by setting Stealth Rock and can use Toxic in combination with Corrosion to debilitate Steel- and Poison-types that Amoonguss hates such as Corviknight and Toxapex. It can remove entry hazards with Mortal Spin, which helps with Amoonguss's longevity in case its Heavy-Duty Boots have been removed, and is also the primary way of dealing with Skeledirge. Iron Moth can don a Choice Scarf to deal with boosted threats such as Swords Dance Chien-Pao and Dragon Dance Baxcalibur, which shatter Poison teams, or run a Substitute set to better deal with Kingambit. Both Glimmora and Iron Moth can also run Air Balloon, which is greatly appreciated when up against Choice Specs Sandy Shocks or Choice Band Great Tusk, as these two have a good chance to overwhelm Amoonguss in the long run.</p>"

Flamethrower threatens Steel-types like Iron Treads, Corviknight, and Kingambit, while Earth Power aids in the Poison matchup, hitting Clodsire, Skuntank, and Toxapex. Alternatively, Flash Cannon may be used to threaten Fairy-types like Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Gardevoir behind Substitute. Substitute alongside Leftovers makes Hydreigon difficult to revenge kill and offers more setup opportunities against passive Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Klefki, and Forretress. Alternatively, Taunt prevents Ting-Lu from phazing Hydreigon with Whirlwind as well as obstructing Clodsire, Dondozo, and Gastrodon's recovery attempts. Draco Meteor is a niche option to OHKO opposing Dragon-types like Baxcalibur and Dragalge; however, Draco Meteor negates Nasty Plot boosts and requires Hydreigon to give up useful utility.</p> <p>Hydreigon's ability to break past physical walls such as Quagsire, Skeledirge, and Dondozo is heavily appreciated by Baxcalibur and Dragonite. In return, Baxcalibur checks Clodsire, Dragonite, and opposing Hydreigon, while Dragonite threatens Quaquaval and Cinderace. Cyclizar sets up Shed Tail for non-Substitute Hydreigon, allowing for more setup opportunities and freeing up a moveslot for Hydreigon. Furthermore, Cyclizar removes Stealth Rock off the field with Rapid Spin, preserving Hydreigon's ability to set up. Dragapult combats Flutter Mane, Gallade, and opposing Dragon-types, while Hydreigon forces Kingambit off the field and switches into Shadow Sneak from Brambleghast and Ceruledge. Garchomp sets up entry hazards to enhance Hydreigon's wallbreaking capabilities and helps to take care of Clodsire and Volcarona.

        "description": "<p>Due to Hydreigon's wonderful movepool, terrifying Special Attack stat, and useful ability, it's an easy-to-fit wallbreaker on Dark teams that is a huge asset in the Steel, Poison, Ground, and Water matchups. Draco Meteor provides nuclear power after a Nasty Plot, removing threats like Urshifu-R, Baxcalibur, and Great Tusk, while Dark Pulse is a great alternative due to its accuracy, good Base Power, and synergy with Flamethrower or Earth Power. Flamethrower hits Steel-types like Corviknight, Kingambit, and Iron Treads; however, Earth Power hits Hisuian Goodra, Toxapex, and Alolan Muk. Stealth Rock is appreciated to allow Ting-Lu to use Spikes while also capitalizing on the many switches Hydreigon forces. Alternatively, Substitute raises Hydreigon's potency as a wallbreaker, providing safety in front of passive Pokemon like Amoonguss, defensive Rotom-W, and Gastrodon as well as putting lots of pressure on more offensive types like Ground and opposing Dark teams.</p> <p>Chien-Pao and Hydreigon form a formidable wallbreaking core due to Chien-Pao's ability to threaten Unaware Clodsire, Enamorus, and Roaring Moon. In return, Hydreigon uses Toxapex and Quagsire as setup fodder. Sableye provides a Fighting-type immunity and Will-O-Wisp support, discouraging Choice Scarf Great Tusk, Sneasler, and Quaquaval from using their STAB moves. Meowscarada and Greninja are great in the Grass and Water matchups, eliminating Quaquaval, Ice Beam Gastrodon, and Azumarill. Additionally, Meowscarada threatens Dragapult and Choice Scarf Gholdengo, while Greninja breaks (remove double space) past Unaware Clodsire. Kingambit checks Fairy-types like Hatterene and Flutter Mane while also picking off faster threats like Dragapult, Spectrier, and Barraskewda after a few Supreme Overlord boosts. In return, Kingambit values Hydreigon's ability to remove roadblocks like Great Tusk and Urshifu-R. Ting-Lu provides entry hazards and phazing with Whirlwind to wear down defensive checks, while Alolan Muk is an additional asset in the Fairy and Dragon matchup, taking on Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Walking Wake.

Flamethrower is the go-to STAB move for Volcarona, as it hits Steel- and Ice-types such as Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Chien-Pao. Optionally, Fiery Dance can be used over Flamethrower, which has an additional effect of boosting Special Attack, but Flamethrower is preferred due to a higher Base Power. Psychic primarily covers Poison-types like Toxapex, Glimmora, and Iron Moth, but it also hits Fighting-types such as Quaquaval and Great Tusk. Morning Sun provides reliable recovery, which allows Volcarona to further set up and threaten to sweep. Alternatively, Giga Drain targets Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Quagsire, Greninja, and Gastrodon. Bug Buzz can be used over Psychic to hit Dark- and Psychic-types such as Hydreigon, Ting-Lu, and Espathra. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps Volcarona safe from entry hazards, while Flame Body debilitates physical attackers. A Timid nature allows Volcarona to outspeed Choice Scarf Flamigo after a single Quiver Dance boost.</p> <p>Volcarona and Scizor make a great pair, as Scizor—thanks to its Steel-typing—helps Volcarona by switching into Toxic from Clodsire, and it deals with Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Lycanroc thanks to Bullet Punch. Volcarona appreciates entry hazard support from Forretress, which pressures and wears down the opposing team. Choice Scarf Heracross helps against Steel- and Dark-types—such as Iron Treads and Kingambit—and Flying-types—like Kilowattrel—with Close Combat and Stone Edge, respectively; in return, Volcarona helps deal with Corviknight, which Heracross struggles to break. Slither Wing threatens Flying- and Water-types such as Iron Jugulis, Pelipper, and Greninja with Wild Charge, and threatens Corviknight with Flare Blitz. It can safely pivot in Volcarona, enabling its sweep. Both Slither Wing and Heracross pressure specially defensive walls such as Clodsire and Blissey, which Volcarona struggles to break. Lokix helps against Ghost-, Psychic- and Dark-types like Skeledirge, Espathra, Armarouge, Meowscarada, and Greninja thanks to First Impression, Throat Chop, and Sucker Punch.

      "Quiver Dance (Fire)": {
        "description": "<p>A potent offensive presence, Volcarona's access to Quiver Dance provides the backbone to its sweeping capabilities. Bug Buzz is Volcarona's main attacking option and can be combined with Swarm to increase damage as Volcarona loses HP while setting up, allowing Volcarona to OHKO checks like offensive Garchomp after one Quiver Dance. Psychic is essential, as it allows Volcarona to hit one of Fire's strongest checks, Toxapex, but also super effectively damages Poison-types and Fighting-types such as Glimmora and Quaquaval. The last slot is interchangeable, though generally Flamethrower is preferred as a STAB move that can also take advantage of sun support on Fire teams and is essential to for the Flying matchup, allowing it to hit Corviknight and Kilowattrel. Giga Drain can be used to give Volcarona a better chance of breaking through Water and Ground teams and give it a recovery option. Similarly, Morning Sun gives Volcarona more setup opportunities. Flame Body can also be used to threaten burns on Pokemon such as Kingambit and Dragonite, which oftentimes revenge kill Volcarona. Given its all-around solid defensive stats, Volcarona finds a myriad of opportunities to set up and takes advantage of the maximum Speed spread given to capitalize on the boosts as much as possible, outspeeding Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Great Tusk or Choice Scarf Dragapult after one or two Quiver Dance boosts, respectively.</p> <p>Generally, Volcarona is best saved for mid- to late-game, when the opposing team has been chipped down and Volcarona has an opportunity to sweep after setting up. Utilizing its offensive teammates such as Scovillain, Ceruledge, Cinderace, and Paldean Tauros-F to slowly chip down defensive walls such as Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Blissey provides better opportunity for Volcarona to sweep later in the game. Paldean Tauros-F is specifically useful with its ability to remove dual screens, preventing Volcarona's setup from being hindered. Rotom-H also provides excellent support, aiding in the Water matchup if Giga Drain is not used and providing pivot support to switch Volcarona in. Skeledirge and Talonflame provide defensive support to wear down offensive threats such as Dragonite. Torkoal providing sun support on Fire aids Volcarona, not only increasing Flamethrower's damage output, but giving Volcarona the opportunity to survive attacks like Choice Specs Greninja's Surf, giving it an opportunity to set up.</p>"

Landorus's preferred ability, Sheer Force, in conjunction with Life Orb raises its offensive potency to great heights, allowing it to 2HKO nearly every wall in the metagame, including Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Corviknight with Focus Blast. Sludge Bomb hits Grass-types like Rotom-C and Breloom as well as easing the Fairy matchup alongside Iron Treads and Clodsire, while Psychic threatens Urshifu-R and Air Balloon Glimmora and pops Gholdengo's Air Balloon, as Landorus is walled by it otherwise. Nasty Plot renders Landorus completely unwallable, notably letting it OHKO Corviknight. Alternatively, Rock Slide can be used to catch Volcarona, Zapdos, and Frosmoth off guard; however, it forces Landorus to use the suboptimal Naive nature and should only be used if teammates don't have answers for the listed targets. Substitute is a great option on Landorus because of the amount of switches it forces as well as making Kingambit's Sucker Punch easier to outplay.</p> <p>Landorus appreciates Water Absorb Clodsire and Storm Drain Gastrodon switching into Water-type Pokemon like Barraskewda, Walking Wake, and Basculegion-F. Choice Scarf Great Tusk threatens Pokemon with Ice-type coverage like Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Greninja. Iron Treads provides support in the Fairy matchup and provides pivoting with Volt Switch, luring switch-ins like Corviknight and Volcarona for Landorus to take advantage of. Furthermore, Iron Treads removes Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin and enhances Landorus's wallbreaking with Knock Off, removing recovery items like Leftovers and Black Sludge from Rotom-W and Amoonguss. Additionally, Choice Scarf Iron Treads is a great asset in the Fairy matchup and threatens Ice-types like Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur. Sandy Shocks is a great teammate in the Flying and Water matchups, providing Gravity support and additional pivoting with Volt Switch. Quagsire is able to check Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur as well as providing entry hazards and chip damage with Toxic. Ting-Lu provides entry hazards and phazing to wear down the opponent's team for Landorus and appreciates the removal of Fighting-types. Ursaluna can switch into Ghost-type moves from faster opponents like Dragapult, Flutter Mane, and Hisuian Zoroark as well as aiding in heavily denting teams alongside Landorus.

Focus Blast tears apart Dark-types and Ground-immune Steel-type Pokemon such as Chien-Pao, Hydreigon, and Orthworm. Psychic makes the Fighting matchup a lot easier, OHKOing Great Tusk, Urshifu-R, and Iron Valiant, as well as taking out Galarian Weezing after Stealth Rock damage, making the Poison matchup extremely one sided. Sludge Bomb aids in the Fairy matchup, OHKOing Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Azumarill, and helps greatly against Grass-type Pokemon that Ground-type teams would otherwise struggle to break, taking out prominent threats such as Breloom and Hisuian Lilligant. U-turn is a great pivot option for Landorus, gaining momentum by scaring out Pokemon it threatens while inflicting damage on the replacement and getting switch initiative.</p> <p>Landorus cowers in fear at the thought of a single snowflake, which is why Quagsire is a great teammate for it. Quagsire is able to stand up to terrifying Ice-type move users such as Swords Dance Chien-Pao, Swords Dance Urshifu-R, Azumarill without Trailblaze, and Baxcalibur, as well as providing entry hazard support via Spikes and Stealth Rock and spreading Toxic to soften foes up for Landorus. Iron Treads forms a wonderful core with Landorus as well, switching in on foes that attack with Ice-type moves, such as Articuno, Frosmoth, and Alolan Ninetales, and hitting back with a very powerful Heavy Slam or Iron Head. Iron Treads can also remove Stealth Rock via Rapid Spin and remove items via Knock Off, increasing Landorus's longevity and wallbreaking capabilities. Ice Spinner is also an option to take out opposing Landorus and Gliscor. In turn, Landorus can switch into a weakened Ogerpon-H as well as Ground- and Fighting-type attacks that would make quick work of Iron Treads. Landorus also appreciates Pokemon such as Water Absorb Clodsire and Storm Drain Gastrodon, as they can switch in to Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Walking Wake, Barraskewda, and Basculegion-F. Clodsire is a very good special wall, while Gastrodon takes neutral damage from Ice Beam as well as walling Choice Scarf Greninja and providing a myriad of hazard support. Both Ursaluna and Ursaluna-B complement Landorus nicely, as they are able to switch into Ghost-type attacks from Pokemon that Landorus would otherwise struggle against, such as Flutter Mane and Air Balloon Gholdengo. Ursaluna-B is also capable of picking off weakened Dark-type Pokemon such as Kingambit, Greninja, and Chien-Pao with Vacuum Wave. In turn, Landorus can switch in on the Fighting-type attacks that would trouble Ursaluna and Ursaluna-B, and threatening the foe with Psychic. Gliscor is another great teammate for Landorus, as it is able to whittle down opponents via Knock Off and Toxic. Mamoswine is able to take down the Flying-type Pokemon that Landorus would otherwise be ineffective against and can also make use of its Thick Fat ability to tank some additional Ice-type moves. Sandy Shocks not only can set hazards but also can pivot around with Volt Switch, allowing Landorus to come in on an easy target.</p>"

Protean + Choice Specs allows it to take full advantage of its coverage moves to OHKO and 2HKO common threats. Hydro Pump 2HKOes specially defensive Corviknight after Stealth Rock; however, Surf is a safer option while still OHKOing Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock. Ice Beam targets threats such as Dragonite and Clodsire. Grass Knot can 2HKO Ting Lu and Gastrodon while OHKOing Dondozo after Stealth Rock. Extrasensory targets Poison- and Fighting-types such as Toxapex and Quaquaval.</p> <p>Meowscarada forms a dual Protean core with Greninja to break each other's checks; Greninja can break Toxapex for Meowscarada, while Meowscarada can break Iron Hands for Greninja. Chien-Pao and Greninja form a dangerous core that shatters teams without a proper Ice-resistant Pokemon. Chien-Pao is also capable of breaking Steel-types such as Kingambit with Sacred Sword. Kingambit can take on Fairy-type Pokemon for Greninja, such as Flutter Mane and Hatterene, while it can break past physical walls such as Quagsire in return. Ting-Lu can stack Stealth Rock and Spikes allowing Greninja to more easily score OHKOs such as against Corviknight and Dondozo and take care of Hatterene and Flutter Mane with Heavy Slam for Greninja. Sableye switches into Fighting-type attacks such as Great Tusk's Close Combat; additionally, it can block Rapid Spin, keeping entry hazards up for Greninja.

        "description": "<p>Thanks to a wide array of coverage options alongside Protean, Choice Specs Greninja is a devastating special wallbreaker that can dismantle several types, including Grass, Ground, Water, and Poison. Its naturally high Speed tier is invaluable to outpace and threaten fast foes such as Iron Valiant and Sandy Shocks. Aside from hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types like Bronzong and Gholdengo, Dark Pulse's lack of immunities makes it a spammable attack that can be used to muscle past neutral Pokemon such as Corviknight with flinches. Ice Beam covers a large portion of the metagame, including Dragon, Ground, Grass, and Flying teams, decimating prominent foes like Hydreigon, Clodsire, Amoonguss, and Iron Jugulis. It's also Greninja's hardest hitting attack against Skuntank, which is important in the Poison matchup. Extrasensory pressures Poison- and Fighting-types like Toxapex and Assault Vest Iron Hands and prevents Greninja from being picked off by Breloom's Mach Punch. Grass Knot rounds out its coverage, significantly damaging Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Water-types such as Gastrodon and Dondozo.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja appreciates being paired with other wallbreakers like Barraskewda and Quaquaval that can handle Normal and Steel teams. They break through bulky Pokemon like Blissey and Kingambit that Greninja struggles with; they are also potent late-game cleaners that enjoy Greninja's ability to threaten Storm Drain Gastrodon and their physically defensive checks like Amoonguss, Toxapex, Slowbro, and Dondozo. Moreover, Barraskewda under rain excels at tearing down fast offensive teams that Greninja can struggle with, as it can threaten out Meowscarada, boosted Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Iron Moth. Quaquaval can also run Rapid Spin to let Greninja enter the field multiple times to wallbreak without worry, preventing it from being chipped down into KO range of priority attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Baxcalibur's Ice Shard. Pivot support from Slowking is helpful to bring Greninja in safely on foes like Dragalge and Gastrodon, letting it fire off attacks freely. Defensive teammates such as Toxapex, Dondozo, Gastrodon, and Quagsire can switch into potential revenge killers like Meowscarada, Chien-Pao, Dragapult, and Slither Wing, respectively; notably, Gastrodon and Quagsire also provide entry hazards to take advantage of the countless switches that Greninja forces, putting the likes of Ting-Lu, Toxapex, and Assault Vest Iron Hands into Greninja's KO range, as well as switch into and check Electric-types such as Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks and Assault Vest Iron Hands.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Due to its exceptional bulk and Steel typing, Hisuian Goodra is a staple on Dragon teams, being able to take on Fairy-, Dragon-, and Ice-type threats. Heavy Slam checks Fairy-types like Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Hatterene while also hitting Dragapult and other Dragon-types neutrally. Body Press, further enhanced by Acid Armor, threatens Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Hydreigon, as well as deals considerable damage to opposing Hisuian Goodra and Walking Wake after Defense boosts. Rest, in conjunction with Chesto Berry, provides instant recovery, allowing Hisuian Goodra to preserve Acid Armor boosts while remaining healthy, severely threatening Dragon and hyper offensive Dark teams. The given EV spread provides enough Defense to OHKO Chien-Pao with an unboosted Body Press while retaining as much Special Defense as possible to improve the Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Walking Wake matchups. Shell Armor prevents foes from breaking through Acid Armor boosts with a critical hit.</p> <p>Baxcalibur is a great teammate in the Ground and Flying matchups, threatening Landorus, Sandy Shocks, and Corviknight. Garchomp provides entry hazards to wear down wallbreakers like Sneasler, Sandy Shocks, and Urshifu-R, as well as deals with walls such as Clodsire, Skeledirge, and Iron Hands. Dragapult offers a Fighting-type immunity to combat Sneasler, Zamazenta, and Urshifu-R. Dragonite and Hydreigon switch into Ground-type attacks from Iron Treads, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu and also aid in the Steel and Poison matchups. Walking Wake is a huge asset in the Ground matchup and threatens Gholdengo and Skeledirge. Cyclizar removes entry hazards for Hisuian Goodra to improve its longevity and provides it a safe switch in against threats like Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant with Shed Tail.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Klefki is a popular choice for Fairy-type teams due to Prankster, dual screens, and Spikes. This set excels at enabling setup sweepers such as Mimikyu and Azumarill providing them with boosted bulk and chipping the opposing team thanks to Spikes. With maximum HP and Defense EVs and Foul Play, Klefki efficiently counters opposing Swords Dance and Dragon Dance sweepers such as Scizor and Dragonite. Alternatively, it can use Thunder Wave to cripple fast threats like Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant. Klefki’s Steel typing also provides a useful immunity against Poison-type teams and blocks Glimmora's Mortal Spin, ensuring that entry hazards remain on the opposing field.</p> <p>Belly Drum Azumarill is an excellent partner for Klefki, as the dual screens greatly facilitate setting up with Belly Drum and sweeping opposing teams. Additionally, Spikes provide some chip damage to ensure OHKOs on foes like Meowscarada. Choice Specs Flutter Mane can also take advantage of the chip damage from Klefki's Spikes to power through teams and more easily defeat walls such as Toxapex, Quagsire, and Amoonguss. Calm Mind Flutter Mane benefits both dual screens to set up and sweep and from Thunder Wave slowing down threats like Barraskewda. Iron Valiant appreciates Klefki slowing down faster foes like Flutter Mane, Cinderace, and Dragapult with Thunder Wave, allowing it to defeat them. Iron Valiant also provides a much-needed offensive pressure against Steel-types like Kingambit and works as a devastating offensive core when paired with Flutter Mane. Hatterene and Klefki form a strong defensive core, with the former’s Magic Bounce punishing any attempt from Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Forretress to set entry hazards, while the latter can come in on Poison-type moves, potentially forcing a switch on a Choice locked Pokemon like Greninja in the process. The additional bulk that Hatterene receives from the dual screens even allows it to take a stand against foes such as Glimmora, Clodsire, and Toxapex, preventing them from setting their hazards while countering them.</p>"

Its strong offensive STAB combination coupled with great coverage allows it to muscle through bulky Pokemon such as Skeledirge, Toxapex, Iron Hands, and Amoonguss, and with its great special bulk, it can prove useful against Ghost teams. Drain Punch grants Hoopa-U super effective coverage against Dark- and Steel-types such as Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Brick Break can also be run as Hoopa-U's Fighting-type move, as this allows it to remove dual screens set by Fairy- and Dark-type teams. Trick is a great option for Hoopa-U to hinder Pokemon that can take a hit like Sableye and Klefki, as well as potentially disrupt Pokemon reliant on their items such as Moltres. Gunk Shot is another great option, as it allows Hoopa-U to threaten Fairy-types like Azumarill and to OHKO Hatterene. By investing 8 EVs in Special Defense, Hoopa-U can live a Moonblast from Choice Scarf Flutter Mane.</p> <p>Azelf and Scream Tail make for great partners, as they can set up entry hazards for Hoopa-U to be able to wallbreak more easily. Azelf can also run Taunt to prevent Defog users like Corviknight removing its hazards, while Scream Tail can also set up dual screens for both Hoopa-U and its teammates and provide Wish support. Because of Hoopa-U's lack of longevity outside of Wish, it can get easily worn down by hazards. Hence, Hatterene is a great partner, as it is able to provide great hazard control for Psychic teams through Magic Bounce. Galarian Slowking is another great partner for Hoopa-U, as it provides Hoopa-U a switch-in to Fairy-types and aids Hoopa-U's wallbreaking through Future Sight. Galarian Slowking can also set up Toxic Spikes to annoy Hoopa-U's switch-ins such as Azumarill, and its Poison typing allows it to remove Toxic Spikes to prevent Hoopa-U from getting worn down by poison. Indeedee is another great addition to Psychic teams, as its Normal typing grants it an immunity to Ghost. Aside from this, Indeedee can set up Psychic Terrain to allow Hoopa-U to threaten Kingambit with Drain Punch without fearing Sucker Punch. Lastly, late-game sweepers such as Gallade and Armarouge appreciate Hoopa-U beating their checks such as Azumarill for the former and Galarian Slowking for the latter. Lastly, Espathra appreciates Hoopa-U breaking through its checks such as Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Sableye so it can set up and sweep late-game.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Volcanion is a useful Pokemon on Fire teams mainly thanks to its ability, Water Absorb, offering the type an immunity to one of its most common weaknesses. Steam Eruption is Volcanion's preferred Water-type move, with it being able to burn its switch-ins like Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and Iron Hands, reducing their overall longevity. Earth Power allows Volcanion to threaten opposing Volcanion, Toxapex, and Heatran. Sludge Bomb allows Volcanion to revenge kill Azumarill after a Belly Drum and threaten other Fairy-type Pokemon like Hatterene and Enamorus. It is also able to target Walking Wake and Rotom-W, which resist Volcanion's STAB attacks, potentially crippling them thanks to the 30% poison chance. Flamethrower is preferred over Fire Blast since it doesn't miss, and the reduced damage is not too significant if Volcanion is under sun, but Fire Blast can be used in order to 2HKO Hisuian Goodra under sun. 96 Speed EVs let Volcanion outspeed Adamant Azumarill in order to revenge kill it with Sludge Bomb, and the rest of the EVs are put in HP to improve Volcanion's overall bulk.</p> <p>Torkoal is a solid partner for Volcanion that assists it with Stealth Rock support, chipping down its switch-ins like Rotom-W and Alolan Muk and working well in conjunction with Steam Eruption's burn chance. Torkoal can also use Rapid Spin to clear away entry hazards for Volcanion if its Heavy-Duty Boots get removed by Alolan Muk or Meowscarada. Furthermore, Torkoal provides Volcanion with sun thanks to Drought, which boosts Volcanion's Fire-type attacks. In return, Volcanion can switch into Water attacks from Barraskewda and Pelipper, which threaten Torkoal. Scovillain helps out Volcanion by threatening Water-immune Pokemon like Clodsire and Gastrodon, and its damage onto the former allows Volcanion to revenge kill it and proceed to threaten slower Ground-types like Quagsire and Ting-Lu. Cinderace is able to threaten Hisuian Goodra with Libero High Jump Kick, whose Assault Vest set easily shrugs off Earth Power from Volcanion and chips it down with Draco Meteor. Cinderace can also steal dual screens from Klefki with Court Change in the Fairy matchup, which supplement Volcanion's naturally good bulk, letting it take hits better. In return, Volcanion offers an answer to Belly Drum Azumarill and threatens Cinderace's defensive answers like Toxapex and Skeledirge. Choice Scarf Hisuian Arcanine offers a solution to handle opposing Dragon-types like Baxcalibur, which can use Volcanion as setup fodder, and also threatens Dragapult and non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Rotom-Heat provides an invaluable Ground immunity for Volcanion to avoid Earthquake from Pokemon like Iron Hands, Iron Treads, and Landorus-T and threatens all 3 of them with a burn from Will-O-Wisp. Rotom-H is also able to threaten defensive Water-types like Toxapex and offensive Water-types like Hisuian Samurott and Quaquaval if it opts for a Choice Scarf. Heatran can help Volcanion deal with Poison teams with its stallbreaker set, which allows it to trap and beat Pokemon like Toxapex one-on-one. Choice Scarf Iron Moth can revenge kill weakened Dragon-types like Walking Wake and Baxcalibur.</p>"

Moonblast allows Ribombee to hit Dark- and Fighting-types such as Chien-Pao and Great Tusk, which can either outspeed Ribombee or remove Sticky Web thanks to Rapid Spin. Stun Spore allows Ribombee to annoy threats such as Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Walking Wake, letting its teammates outspeed and remove said foes later on in the game. Quiver Dance allows Ribombee to exert pressure throughout a game while potentially turning it into a win condition in the Dragon and Fighting matchups if it is not needed as a lead. Focus Sash lets Ribombee get Sticky Web up as a lead without having to fear being OHKOed due to its poor bulk.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Kleavor is an excellent teammate for Ribombee, as it appreciates being able to outspeed nearly everything in the metagame under Sticky Web, including opposing Choice Scarf users such as Roaring Moon and Meowscarada. It also appreciates Ribombee hitting Fighting-types, such as Great Tusk and Iron Valiant, with Moonblast, allowing it to spam Stone Axe late-game to clean up weakened teams. In return, Kleavor threatens Fire-types such as Torkoal and Moltres that Bug teams struggle to break through. It also compounds with Ribombee's entry hazard pressure thanks to Stone Axe setting Stealth Rock. Swords Dance Scizor is another good teammate for Ribombee, as it appreciates being able to hit normally-faster threats that don't mind Bullet Punch, like Heatran and Walking Wake, hard thanks to Sticky Web not forcing it to rely on Bullet Punch for damage. In compensation, Scizor uses its Poison immunity to come in on threats such as Choice Scarf Sneasler that would otherwise threaten Ribombee and use them as a setup opportunity. It also removes Hatterene, which is invaluable to let Ribombee set up Sticky Web. Slither Wing is another great teammate, as it removes common Steel-types such as Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon that Ribombee wouldn't be able to do much against. Forretress can keep hazards off of the field to enhance Ribombee's late-game sweeping potential and preserve its Focus Sash while being able to set hazards itself and take on threats such as Kingambit with Body Press. It also, similarly to Kleavor, can add to the hazard pressure by setting Spikes. Volcarona benefits greatly from Sticky Web, as after one Quiver Dance, it outspeeds Choice Scarf users that would otherwise attempt to revenge kill it, such as Roaring Moon and Urshifu-R. Ribombee, in turn, appreciates the fact that Volcarona can switch in on threats such as Gholdengo and stay healthy while being able to hit Steel-types with a strong Fiery Dance. Lokix can clean teams weakened by Ribombee thanks to its strong U-turn and First Impression while hitting Ghost-types such as Skeledirge and Gholdengo that pose large roadblocks for Bug teams and amplifying the effects of Sticky Web with Knock Off. In exchange, Lokix appreciates being able to outspeed common threats such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane under Sticky Web. Heracross can, in a similar vein to Slither Wing, deal with Steel-types such as Heatran and Kingambit while also using Knock Off to both remove key items from defensive behemoths such as Toxapex and increase the effects of Sticky Web on the opposing team. It appreciates Sticky Web to patch up its lackluster Speed. Finally, Frosmoth is another Quiver Dance user that has massive special bulk thanks to Ice Scales that also appreciates Sticky Web patching up its low Speed.</p>"

With Choice Band, Stone Edge  2HKOes Corviknight. Close Combat deals with Normal-, Rock-, Dark- and Steel-types like Ursaluna, Tyranitar, Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Hisuian Goodra. Psychic Fangs not only breaks screens in the Fairy matchup, but it also deals with Fighting- and Poison-types like Urshifu-R, Great Tusk, Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Clodsire. Play Rough is another option to deal with Dragon- and Dark- types like Walking Wake, Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Sableye.</p> <p>Garganacl pairs well with Lycanroc-D, as Salt Cure wears down defensive Pokemon Lycanroc-D struggles with such as Quagsire and Corviknight. In return, Garganacl benefits from Lycanroc-D's ability to remove wallbreakers such as Walking Wake and Urshifu-R which threaten Garganacl's Iron Defense + Body Press set. Tyranitar is an essential teammate as it sets up sand to further chip down walls and checks threats like Flutter Mane, Espathra, and Kingambit due to its sheer bulk and great coverage in Heavy Slam, Crunch, and Low Kick. Hisuian Arcanine's wallbreaking power covers walls that are harder for Lycanroc-D to take down, dealing with Toxapex and Corviknight with Head Smash and Flare Blitz, respectively. Kleavor is a great lead, as Stone Axe sets up Stealth Rock to break through any opposing Focus Sash, allowing Lycanroc-D and Hisuian Arcanine to clean teams more easily. It can also pivot into Lycanroc-D with U-turn, luring in foes like Toxapex, Iron Treads, and Heatran in the process.  Choice item Glimmora's colorful moveset helps against walls like Quagsire and Toxapex through the use of Energy Ball and Earth Power, with Choice Scarf allowing Glimmora to outspeed and take down fast offensive threats such as Iron Valiant and Greninja if they aren't running Choice Scarf. Coalossal removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin, checks Scizor, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit with Flamethrower and Body Press, and can burn threats with Flame Body. Iron Defense + Calm Mind Diancie can check Garchomp with Moonblast. Shell Smash Air Balloon Drednaw provides a temporary Ground-type immunity and appreciates defensive walls being worn down by Lycanroc-D. In return, it readily cleans weakened Flying and Ground teams, eliminating threats like Landorus-T and Great Tusk.</p>"

Its Poison-type STAB moves hit Grass- and Fairy-types such as Breloom and Iron Valiant for super effective damage while also spreading poison to chip down switch-ins such as Great Tusk and Garchomp. Poison Jab can hit Hatterene and Flutter Mane harder than Sludge Bomb. Recover allows Toxapex to remain healthy, while Haze prevents foes such as Volcarona and Quaquaval from setting up. Toxic can be used to stall out foes such as the aforementioned Volcarona and Quaquaval, and it can punish switch-ins that can try to use Toxapex as setup fodder such as Dragapult. Toxic Spikes can punish teams without entry hazard removal such as Dark and Fairy. Black Sludge can be used for passive recovery, and Rocky Helmet can be used to wear down physical attackers such as Chien-Pao. Eject Button can be an option on rain teams to get free pivoting to wallbreakers such as Floatzel and Barraskewda.</p> <p>Quaquaval is a great teammate that can remove hazards to keep Toxapex healthy. Dondozo and Quagsire can help Toxapex deal with setup sweepers such as Chien-Pao and Dragapult.

Surf is an alternative to Chilling Water thanks to its higher damage output, which lets Toxapex threaten to OHKO threats like Hisuian Arcanine after minimal chip damage and is better off against threats that don't care for their attack being lowered, such as Moltres. Haze removes the buffs from sweepers, including Ceruledge, Mimikyu, and Kingambit. Toxapex has three notable options for its second support move: Toxic Spikes to complete Poison's entry hazard stacking core and puts teams on a timer; Baneful Bunker to allow Toxapex to scout opponents, poison contact attackers such as Chien-Pao, and heal with Black Sludge; and Infestation to trap opponents that don't threaten Toxapex such as Alolan Muk and Klefki. Infestation can also be ran as instead of a Water STAB move with Baneful Bunker or Toxic to trap and waste away the plentiful contact attackers.</p> <p>Alolan Muk serves as a great teammate for Toxapex, being a special tank able to take on many of the special Psychic- and Ghost-types that threaten Toxapex, like Espathra, Galarian Slowking, Flutter Mane, and Gholdengo. Overqwil, while not as specially bulky as Alolan Muk, can also deter Psychic- and Ghost-types, soft check physical Iron Valiant and check physical Dragapult thanks to Intimidate, and benefit much more from Toxic Spikes with Barb Barrage. Amoonguss is a second Regenerator physical wall with a neutrality to Ground and resistance to Electric able to combat many Pokemon that threaten Toxapex such as Great Tusk, Quagsire, Rotom-W and Regieleki. Clodsire is an Unaware special wall immune to Electric that checks attack threats like Regieleki and Magnezone along with special setup Pokemon like Volcarona and Hydreigon. Air Balloon Glimmora can support Toxapex by removing entry hazards from the field for non-Heavy-Duty Boots sets, being temporarily immune to Ground with Air Balloon, and using Corrosion Toxic to put threats Toxapex majorly dislikes such as opposing Toxapex, Hisuian Goodra and Heatran on timers. Corrosion Salazzle can also provide Corrosion Toxic support along with using Encore to mess up Pokemon that view Toxapex as a setup opportunity like Kingambit. Sneasler can also be used to punch holes through teams thanks to its powerful STAB Close Combat, which can KO threats like Iron Treads and Baxcalibur, while Toxapex can come in and absorb damage for Sneasler and wear foes down with Infestation and Toxic Spikes.</p>"

Flamethrower gives Salazzle some offensive pressure, letting it force out Steel-, Grass-, and Ice-type threats like Gholdengo, Brambleghast, and Alolan Sandslash. With Salazzle's high Speed, Encore can prevent threats like Sinistcha, Ursaluna-B, Okidogi, and Hydreigon from setting up, as well as lock Kingambit into Sucker Punch or Swords Dance. Substitute paired with Black Sludge can allow Salazzle to accumulate Toxic damage on slower threats like Hisuian Goodra, along with finding repeated chances to safely set up Substitutes against foes that cannot break through them like Galarian Weezing and Amoonguss to effortlessly spread Toxic. Protect racks up Black Sludge healing and allows safe scouting against Choice-locked threats like Iron Valiant, Greninja, and Flutter Mane. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Salazzle to come in safely and land a Toxic.</p> <p>With Salazzle's crippling Ground-type weakness, Galarian Weezing serves as a crucial ally thanks to its Ground immunity, being able to safely switch in on threats like Great Tusk, Mamoswine, and Quagsire, and ability to remove Stealth Rock to give Salazzle safe entry. Amoonguss helps to force out pesky Ground- and Water-types like Great Tusk, Gastrodon, and Ogerpon-W with Giga Drain and Foul Play. It can also use Spore to allow Salazzle safe entry to get up a free Substitute, while in return Amoonguss appreciates the removal of Steel-types like Gholdengo and Corviknight, which can use it as setup fodder. With its immense physical bulk and access to STAB Surf and Haze, Toxapex can deal with threats such as Chien-Pao, Scizor, and Kleavor, while Salazzle limits foes like Articuno and Thundurus-T that majorly threaten Toxapex. Unaware Clodsire checks special setup sweepers like Kommo-o and Volcarona while also providing additional chip damage with Stealth Rock. Alolan Muk's superb special bulk and access to Knock Off and Poison Jab allow it to easily handle Ghost-type threats that force Salazzle out like Flutter Mane and Hisuian Zoroark. Overqwil, while not as specially bulky, can still serve as a solid Psychic- and Ghost-type response and works much better against threats like Gallade, Ceruledge, and Dragapult thanks to its high physical bulk and Intimidate. Galarian Slowking can create Future Sight traps to force in the team's opposing Dark-type or special walls like Alolan Muk and Hisuian Goodra, which Salazzle can take advantage of by getting in safely to either land a Toxic or set up a Substitute. Galarian Slowking also helps Salazzle by dealing with deadly special attackers like Volcanion, Iron Moth, and Walking Wake. Okidogi majorly appreciates Salazzle's Toxic shutting down bulky walls like Skeledirge, Quagsire, and Galarian Weezing by putting them on timers, and in return Okidogi handles threats like Heatran, Garganacl, and Kingambit with Drain Punch. Sneasler can use U-turn to bring Salazzle in on walls like Amoonguss, Klefki, and Toxapex and use them as an opportunity to get up a Substitute or land a critical Toxic. Meanwhile, Sneasler removes threats like Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit. Choice Specs Icy Wind Gengar helps majorly in removing Gliscor, which can effortlessly switch into Salazzle thanks to Poison Heal. Thanks to STAB Shadow Ball and Thunderbolt, Gengar also helps in removing key threats like Landorus, Hatterene, and Dondozo, which majorly threaten Salazzle.</p>"

Play Rough is Mimikyu's strongest STAB move and allows Mimikyu to secure an OHKO on Iron Hands after a Swords Dance and also deals with bulky Great Tusk. Shadow Sneak lets Mimikyu revenge kill weakened offensive threats like Iron Moth and faster Ghost-type Pokemon such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult. Shadow Claw lets Mimikyu break past bulkier Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Skeledirge more readily compared to Shadow Sneak, while Drain Punch is an alternative that threatens opposing Steel-types such as Magnezone and Kingambit. Mimikyu's preferred item is Life Orb to boost its damage output as much as possible.</p> <p>One of Mimikyu's best partners on Fairy teams is Klefki. Mimikyu appreciates Spikes from Klefki, which allows Mimikyu to take down Pokemon easier after a Swords Dance boost. In return, Mimikyu can block Rapid Spin, allowing Klefki's hazards to stay up during the course of the game. Flutter Mane is often paired with Mimikyu since it can threaten physically defensive pokemon that give Mimikyu a hard time like Amoonguss, Quagsire, and Forretress and also faster offensive threats like Iron Moth and Kilowattrel. Mimikyu is able to break through specially defensive Pokemon like Dragalge which gives Flutter Mane an easier time. Hatterene is also a good partner for Mimikyu, as it can bounce back debilitating status conditions like Will-O-Wisp from Sableye and Thunder Wave from Klefki and also bounces back hazards, which helps with Mimikyu's longevity since it runs Life Orb. Furthermore, Mimikyu with its Disguise up can check opposing Ghost-type Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Gholdengo for Hatterene. Iron Valiant is also one of Mimikyu's best offensive teammates, as special sets are able to threaten other physically defensive Pokemon like Dondozo. Additionally, Iron Valiant is useful for Mimikyu in the Ground matchup, where a Choice Specs set can check answers to Mimikyu, such as Quagsire and Clodsire, using Psyshock. Azumarill can use Belly Drum against Steel teams and weaken foes like Orthworm and revenge kill Iron Treads with Aqua Jet.</p>"

Swords Dance can further take advantage of Disguise. Play Rough threatens Dark- and Fighting-types such as Meowscarada, Krookodile, and Quaquaval. Shadow Sneak picks off faster threats that could otherwise revenge kill Mimikyu, such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane. Drain Punch helps against Steel-types like Kingambit and offers some recovery—Disguise's recoil, entry hazards, and Life Orb damage can wear Mimikyu down pretty easily. Wood Hammer can potentially be used over Drain Punch to hit Pokemon such as Quagsire better, but the recoil damage isn't appreciated. Mimikyu's mediocre Attack forces it to use Life Orb to significantly damage neutral targets.</p> <p>All of Mimikyu's teammates appreciate its ability to take on Dark-type teams. Froslass and Brambleghast can place Spikes to help Mimikyu clean up and use Taunt or Rapid Spin, respectively, so opposing entry hazards don't wear it down. Choice Scarf Flutter Mane helps Mimikyu against both Dark- and Dragon-type teams by taking down faster threats that could KO it after Disguise has been removed, such as Meowscarada and Chien-Pao, which resist Shadow Sneak. Nasty Plot Gholdengo deals with bulkier teams like Ground and Poison teams, as well as absorbing Toxic from bulky walls such as Toxapex. Furthermore, Gholdengo can also run Trick with a Choice item, which can cripple annoying walls such as Quagsire and Dondozo to help Mimikyu deal with them. Polteageist can clean up Poison teams after Skuntank is KOed, as well as Ground, Water, and Fighting teams. Spiritomb can tank some Dark-type attacks so that Mimikyu needn't waste Disguise's protection. Skeledirge can take some hits from foes like Iron Valiant and Dragalge for the same benefit. Dragapult can use a Dragon Dance set to boost against faster Pokemon that threaten Mimikyu, such as Iron Moth.</p>"

Clanging Scales is Kommo-o's best move for Pokemon like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Gliscor. Furthermore, Clanging Scales and Clangorous Soul both trigger Throat Spray, enhancing Kommo-o's wallbreaking capabilities. Vacuum Wave notably picks off Chien-Pao without a Clangorous Soul boost, Meowscarada at +2 Special Attack, and hits other faster threats like Greninja and Baxcalibur. Flamethrower threatens Steel- and Ice-type Pokemon such as Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Avalugg. Soundproof prevents Kommo-o from being hit by Clanging Scales from opposing Kommo-o as well as being phazed out by Piloswine and Empoleon's Roar.</p> <p>Baxcalibur threatens walls like Clodsire, Skeledirge, and Ting-Lu; in return, it appreciates Kommo-o weakening Steel-type Pokemon such as Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Kingambit. Hisuian Goodra is an excellent check for Fairy-types, as Kommo-o is effectively helpless against the type, fighting off Flutter Mane, Hatterene, and Clefable as well as helping against Ice-types like Articuno and Alolan Ninetales. Dragapult threatens the aforementioned Flutter Mane with a Choice Specs, Choice Band, or Dragon Dance set and hinders and potentially removes offensive Pokemon such as Iron Valiant and Chien-Pao via Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp with a utility Hex set, helping Kommo-o set up easier in the Fighting and Dark matchups. Dragapult appreciates the removal of Steel-types and threats like Meowscarada, Urshifu, and Chien-Pao. Cyclizar's entry hazard removal is greatly valued, and it offers Kommo-o easy setup with Shed Tail. Garchomp enhances Kommo-o's wallbreaking with entry hazard stacking and also helps in the Poison and Steel matchups, weakening walls like Empoleon, Alolan Muk, and Toxapex for Kommo-o late-game. Choice Scarf Roaring Moon outpaces and removes Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Jirachi, Gholdengo, and Flutter Mane and revenge kills Fairy-types like Iron Valiant with Iron Head. Walking Wake is capable of outpacing and OHKOing Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur with its Choice Scarf set and heavily pressuring Steel and Poison team walls like Corviknight, Heatran, and Clodsire with a Choice Specs set, allowing Kommo-o to efficiently clean up late-game. Dragalge offers Toxic Spikes support and provides a check to Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant, Flutter Mane, and Enamorus.

Libero-boosted High Jump Kick provides valuable coverage, notably hitting Ting-Lu trying to set entry hazards while dealing large amounts of damage to Pokemon with a Fire resistance trying to switch in on its Pyro Ball, such as Hydreigon and Garganacl. Low Kick is an alternative, letting Cinderace deal decent damage to most heavy foes such as Ting-Lu and Iron Hands without the large risk of High Jump Kick's crash damage. Court Change lets Cinderace force the opposing team to deal with their own hazards while making it unlikely that hazards go up again. U-turn lets Cinderace keep momentum against foes it cannot threaten out like defensive Great Tusk and Garchomp. Alternatively, Sucker Punch lets Cinderace pick off weakened threats such as Flutter Mane and Baxcalibur. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Cinderace come in repeatedly to remove hazards without worrying about residual damage from them.</p> <p>Rotom-H is a great teammate for Cinderace, as its Ground immunity lets it come in on Great Tusk while threatening Water-types such as Toxapex and Dondozo—that Cinderace can't do much against—with its Electric-type STAB moves. Additionally, Rotom-H can beat Poison teams with its Substitute + Nasty Plot set, which Cinderace greatly appreciates. In return, Cinderace can pivot Rotom-H in with U-turn and keep Stealth Rock off its side of the field. Torkoal is another good teammate for Cinderace, as it provides sun to boost Cinderace's Pyro Ball damage to astronomical levels, provides entry hazard support to chip switch-ins, threatens Chien-Pao and physical Dragapult with a burn, and supplies a secondary source of hazard removal. In return, Cinderace can threaten out Ting-Lu, which might try to switch into Torkoal, while also keeping hazards off against Ghost teams. Scovillain deals with the aforementioned Water-types as well as Gastrodon while appreciating Cinderace removing the hazards that hurt Scovillain's longevity. Volcarona appreciates Cinderace chipping away at the opposing team, facilitating an endgame sweep. In return, Volcarona can hit Dark-types such as Ting-Lu and Hydreigon hard with Bug Buzz, ruin Gastrodon through Giga Drain, and damage Poison-types such as Iron Moth, Toxapex, and Glimmora with Psychic. Skeledirge is able to come in on physical hits like Iron Hands's Earthquake and force it out with the threat of a burn. Finally, Ceruledge can remove Ghost-types such as Dragapult that Cinderace can't do much against. In return, Cinderace can eliminate Dark-types and keep hazards off the field for both.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Corviknight has easily cemented itself as a staple on Flying teams, acting as an extremely versatile defensive wall that can also remove entry hazards for its teammates. Iron Head allows Corviknight to handle Flutter Mane and other Fairy-types such as Mimikyu and Hatterene. Body Press hits Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and other Dark- and Steel-types hard. On the other hand, U-turn safely brings in stronger attackers like Dragonite, Iron Jugulis, and Kilowattrel, providing extra counterplay against Pokemon such as Volcarona and Gholdengo, which commonly switch into Corviknight. Pressure is the preferred ability for PP stalling Stealth Rock, while Mirror Armor counters Flutter Mane and Hatterene, which would otherwise overwhelm Corviknight with Mystical Fire. With the listed EV spread and a Careful nature, Corviknight avoids a 2HKO from Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball while guaranteeing Iron Head OHKOes Flutter Mane in return. The remaining EVs are put into Defense to ease its matchup against physical threats such as Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Baxcalibur.</p> <p>Corviknight's capability to take on many offensive threats combined with its Steel typing makes it a stellar asset that almost any offensive Pokemon benefits from. For instance, Iron Jugulis appreciates Corviknight removing Flutter Mane, and Flamigo struggles with Ice Shard variants of Chien-Pao, which Corviknight can safely switch into. Dragonite greatly benefits from Corviknight's ability to soak up Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks while also covering Corviknight's weaknesses to Fire- and Electric-types such as Cinderace, Magnezone, and Volcarona. Gyarados can also act as a reliable wincon against types like Fire and Ground while also making Chien-Pao significantly more managable with Intimidate. Additionally, Kilowattrel is a great offensive pivot to pair with Corviknight, as it removes threats that could harm Corviknight like Greninja, Volcarona, and Azumarill while also absorbing Electric-type attacks. In return, Corviknight counters Iron Treads and Ting-Lu, which threaten Kilowattrel. Pelipper can be paired with Kilowattrel and Corviknight to form a potent rain core that softens the impact of Fire moves and gives Kilowattrel a Water-type Weather Ball, OHKOing many Fire-types that annoy Corviknight including Skeledirge and Rotom-H. Corviknight appreciates having Talonflame as an alternative option against physical attackers, as Talonflame is able to hold off Chien-Pao and burn Great Tusk, Iron Hands, and Dragonite, tremendously easing Corviknight's role.</p>"

Body Press targets Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon that resist Brave Bird or could take advantage of its recoil like Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Iron Treads, as well as capitalizes off of the Defense boost given by Bulk Up. Alternatively, Taunt prevents Ting-Lu from phazing Corviknight out with Whirlwind and breaks passive teams like Poison due to the prominence of Haze and recovery moves, while Substitute makes it harder to shut down once setup and stalls out Landorus-T's Smack Down. Leftovers provides much-needed recovery and is almost always the preferred item; however, Occa Berry + Body Press can surprise Heatran and Flamethrower Hydreigon. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 80 Def / 180 SpD with an Impish nature allows Corviknight to survive Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R after a Swords Dance, as well as prevents Zamazenta from breaking Substitute with Body Press.</p> <p>Heatran is a great teammate, as it switches into Fire-type moves from Iron Moth, Scovillain, and Moltres and traps and removes Toxapex so Corviknight doesn't need to use Taunt. In return, Corviknight provides an immunity to Ground-type attacks directed at Heatran as well as a Fighting-type neutrality. Gholdengo threatens out Skeledirge and Iron Valiant and takes advantage of walls like Toxapex, opposing Corviknight, and Klefki by setting up Nasty Plot freely. Kingambit checks Ghost-type threats such as Dragapult, Spectrier, and Flutter Mane, as well as heavily wears down teams so Corviknight can setup relatively easily and clean up late-game. Hisuian Goodra is a great specially defenisve tank, taking on Greninja, Basculegion-F, and Volcanion as well as opposing Heatran. Iron Treads offers an Electric-type immunity, handling threats such as Zapdos, Regieleki, and Sandy Shocks, as well as luring Landorus in for a potential KO with Ice Spinner.</p>"

In return Garganacl appreciates Coalossal checking Meowscarada. Air Balloon Shell Smash Drednaw is another good teammate for Coalossal, providing a soft Ground-type immunity and dealing with Ground- and Steel- types like Landorus-T, Sandy Shocks, Iron Treads, Heatran, and Hisuian-Goodra. Choice Scarf Glimmora with its diverse moveset is another option to pair with Coalossal, as it can outspeed and threaten to OHKO non-Choice Scarf users like Iron Valiant and Greninja. Glimmora can also deal with Water-, Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon- Types like Quagsire, Hisuian Liligant, Hisuian Samurott, and Hydreigon with its various coverage moves. Furthermore, Glimmora run Air Balloon to act as an alternative Ground-type immunity that can deal with threats like Quagsire and Great Tusk. Tyranitar sets sand for Coalossal to boosts its Special Defense, which can allow Coalossal to tank special attacks from Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Choice Specs Magnezone and threaten them in return. Choice Band Lycanroc-D is a good revenge killer that can help out Coalossal by taking out threats such as Enamorus and Cloyster with Accelerock and Urshifu-R and Clodsire with Psychic Fangs. Hisuian Arcanine is another good revenge killer with Extreme Speed and can act as a wallbreaker, taking out foes such as Toxapex and Clodsire with Head Smash and Flare Blitz, respectively. Kleavor is a good lead for Rock teams, as it can deal damage while setting up Stealth Rock with Stone Axe, which helps with hazard stacking. In return, Coalossal complements Kleavor by dealing with Scizor. Diancie can ease the Fighting match by dealing decent damage to Gallade and Iron Valiant with Moonblast and by being able to take Fighting-type moves due to its Fairy-typing. In return, Coalossal helps Diancie by dealing with Scizor, Kingambit and Meowscarada.</p>"

Flip Turn forms a pivoting core with teammates like Rotom-W, Pelipper, and Greninja, slowly chipping away at switch-ins like Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Dragonite. Close Combat hits Water-resistant Steel-types like Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon. Ice Fang may be used to hit Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Dragonite. Psychic Fangs nails common switch-ins such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Kommo-o, as well as removes dual screens in the Fairy matchup. Alternatively, Crunch may be used to break Sinistcha, Brambleghast, and Dragapult. A Jolly nature is preferred to outpace Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao outside of rain; however, Barraskewda may opt for an Adamant nature to notably 2HKO Baxcalibur and Zamazenta in rain with Liquidation.</p> <p>Pelipper sets rain for Barraskewda and brings it in safely with U-turn, as well as weakens walls like Corviknight, Amoonguss, and Toxapex with a Choice Specs set. Gastrodon and Quagsire provide entry hazards and an Electric immunity, allowing Gastrodon to switch into Regieleki and Sandy Shocks while Quagsire walls Iron Hands, Pawmot, and Magnezone. In return, Barraskewda lures in aforementioned Grass-types like Amoonguss and Brambleghast and removes them with the corresponding coverage moves. Toxapex provides a Grass neutrality, notably walling Meowscarada and Ogerpon-W, and offers entry hazards to wear down Barraskewda checks, while Barraskewda removes Ground-types like Landorus, Gliscor, and Mamoswine for it. Empoleon sets up Stealth Rock to wear down Barraskewda's checks as well as walls Dragon-types like Walking Wake and Kommo-o lacking adequate Fighting-type coverage. Quaquaval offers entry hazard removal with Rapid Spin and switches into Steel-types like Empoleon, Hisuian Goodra, and Kingambit. Hisuian Samurott threatens Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon like Brambleghast, Slowbro, and Sinistcha while also providing utility support with Knock Off and Spikes set up via Ceaseless Edge. Urshifu-R is great in the Steel and Dark matchups, threatening Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, and Kingambit. Manaphy forms a wallbreaking core with Barraskewda in the Poison and Steel matchups, taking out Corviknight, Toxapex, and Amoonguss for Barraskewda, while Barraskweda hits Galarian Slowking and Alolan Muk in return. Choice Scarf Walking Wake is great in the Dragon matchup, notably outpacing and removing Baxcalibur, Dragapult, and Kommo-o, while a Choice Specs set weakens walls like Toxapex, Hisuian Goodra, and Slowbro. Basculegion-F is a huge asset in the Ghost and Psychic matchups, taking out Sinistcha, Slowbro, and Brambleghast.</p>"

      "Calm Mind (Psychic)": {
        "description": "<p>With its good bulk, Calm Mind, Magic Bounce, and secondary Fairy typing, Hatterene serves as a strong wincon versus types such as Dark and Dragon that otherwise threaten Psychic-type teams. Psyshock is Hatterene’s hardest-hitting move against special walls such as Dragalge and Clodsire. Draining Kiss provides useful coverage against Dark- and Dragon-types and meaningful recovery. Mystical Fire hits Steel-types that otherwise stonewall Hatterene, while Nuzzle supports its teammates by spreading paralysis. The given EV spread lets Hatterene outspeed Toxapex, which could otherwise clear its Calm Mind boosts with Haze.</p> <p>Hatterene struggles with breaking through Pokemon that can handle its STAB attacks and coverage, with Steel-types being a notable example. Because of this, Armarouge is a wonderful partner for Hatterene, as it can pressure the aforementioned Steel-types while also not having to worry about entry hazards due to Hatterene's Magic Bounce. Espathra forms a strong offensive core with Hatterene that can threaten a wide range of types such as Water, Dragon, and Ground once Hatterene breaks down Espathra's checks. This core can be enabled further by setting up dual screens with Scream Tail. Indeedee and Gallade ease pressure from Ghost- and Dark-types, respectively. The former's Psychic Surge can power up Hatterene's Psyshock, and the latter can check Steel-types for Hatterene thanks to its strong Fighting-type STAB attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind (Fairy)": {
        "description": "<p>Hatterene is a near-essential Pokemon on Fairy teams thanks to Magic Bounce and its Psychic typing, only further bolstered by its wide setup and support coverage that allows it to remove Pokemon like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Chien-Pao. Magic Bounce is especially notable, as it is the only form of entry hazard denial for Fairy teams. Calm Mind turns Hatterene into a deadly sweeper, notably stopping unboosted Flutter Mane from OHKOing it, instead OHKOing Flutter Mane in return after a single boost with Psyshock and letting Hatterene overheal Ting-Lu's Earthquake with Draining Kiss. Psyshock also lets Hatterene break through Unaware Clodsire, Dragalge, and Assault Vest Iron Hands, whereas Psychic 2HKOes Amoonguss and Toxapex as well as generally hitting targets for more damage overall. Draining Kiss gives Hatterene much-needed recovery, allowing it to heal against neutral and super effective targets, notably Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Ting-Lu. It can even beat Heavy Slam Ting-Lu with Reflect support from Klefki and Grimmsnarl. Mystical Fire threatens Steel-types like Scizor, Pressure Corviknight, and Gholdengo, which would otherwise safely switch into Hatterene and force it out. Alternatively, Giga Drain allows Hatterene to surprise foes like Gastrodon and Quagsire with an OHKO and generally allows Hatterene to win the Ground- and rainless Water-type matchups alone with minimal support; it can even be used sometimes over Draining Kiss depending on the team's needs, although the amount of HP regained is substantially less. Nuzzle can be used over Mystical Fire or Giga Drain to better support the team via paralysis. The given EVs let Hatterene outspeed an uninvested Toxapex so it can attack before its Calm Mind boosts are removed by Haze, with the rest of the EVs put into Defense to maximize bulk. If preferred, however, 204 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature can be used instead to have increased offensive potential, although at the cost of being more reliant on dual screens support; most notably, this lets Psyshock often OHKO Clodsire and Psychic always 2HKO both Unaware Clodsire and Quagsire. Heavy-Duty Boots is also an option over Leftovers as to more safely switch in when entry hazards are up, either from those that Hatterene could not block or simply was too pressured to switch into, although this does remove a large source of longevity.</p> <p>Dual screens support from Klefki and Grimmsnarl is almost essential, as it allows Hatterene to be much more aggressive with its Calm Mind boosts and switch-in opportunities. These teammates also provide extra support in Spikes from the former and both Taunt and Parting Shot from the latter, and in return, they can use Hatterene to block entry hazards from being set up, especially from Bombirdier and Ting-Lu. Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant can remove threats to Hatterene like Gholdengo, Skeledirge, Kingambit, and Chien-Pao as to facilitate setup opportunities for Hatterene, and they can rely on Hatterene to block hazards, especially Stealth Rock and Spikes. Tinkaton can neutralize Fairy- and Poison-type threats like Flutter Mane, Mimikyu, opposing Tinkaton, and Skuntank, which would otherwise impede on Hatterene's sweep, and set Stealth Rock and spread paralysis via Thunder Wave to ease sweeping opportunities further. Trick support from Iron Valiant and Gardevoir also helps Hatterene sweep, as this prevents bulkier Pokemon like Unaware Clodsire and Quagsire, Toxapex, and Dondozo from healing any damage taken and instead becoming setup fodder. Gardevoir also helps in the rain and sun matchups, as Trace copying Swift Swim and Chlorophyll removes the burden that Barraskewda, Floatzel, and Scovillain place by outspeeding and OHKOing all three. Azumarill and Mimikyu can support Hatterene as extra sweepers in order to overload the enemy's defensive core and majorly help in the Steel-type matchup that Hatterene dreads so much, notably pressuring Iron Treads, Kingambit, Corviknight, and Gholdengo.</p>"

Prankster lets Grimmsnarl set up priority Reflect and Light Screen, making it easier for teammates to set up. Grimmsnarl's access to Parting Shot allows it to bring in a teammate immediately, but Taunt is also a viable option to prevent Defog and opposing leads setting up entry hazards. Thunder Wave also can be used as a form of speed control. Spirit Break lets Grimmsnarl threaten opposing Dark-type setup sweepers such as Hydreigon and Chien-Pao that may leverage their Prankster immunity to set up on Grimmsnarl.

Choice Scarf Meowscarada is appreciated for being able to revenge kill Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Iron Valiant. Chien-Pao and Kingambit can utilize Grimmsnarl's dual screens to break through opposing teams, and Hydreigon can break through Steel-types that may threaten Grimmsnarl out.

      "Hex (Dragon)": {
        "description": "<p>Hex Dragapult serves as great offensive support for Dragon teams, catching common switch-ins to Choice Specs Dragapult, such as Alolan Muk and Iron Hands, off guard by incapacitating them with Will-O-Wisp. With Substitute, Dragapult acts as a stallbreaker against types like Water, Poison, and Ground lacking Ursaluna-B, as burned defensive pivots like Clodsire will be unable to break its Substitute, allowing Dragapult to fire off powerful moves in Hex in conjunction with status ailments and Dragon Darts. Will-O-Wisp also punishes Sucker Punch users like Kingambit, granting Dragon a bit more breathing room against these threats, as well as bulky setup sweepers like Zamazenta and Corviknight. Thunder Wave can be considered if Shed Tail support from Cyclizar is available, as this allows Dragapult to neutralize threats like Iron Valiant, Volcarona, and special Choice Scarf users like Flutter Mane and Enamorus, which do not mind being burned. With 148 SpA EVs, Dragapult OHKOes Flutter Mane with Hex after it is statused, while the remaining EVs are invested in Attack and Speed to maximize the potency of Dragon Darts to make Dragapult as threatening as possible in the Dragon matchup. Infiltrator lets Dragapult OHKO statused Flutter Mane regardless, even behind Light Screen, revenge kill Frosmoth and Baxcalibur behind Substitute, and also inflict burns on Iron Defense Zamazenta behind Substitute.</p> <p>Since Hex Dragapult weakens the offensive capabilities of bulky walls such as Corviknight, Alolan Muk, and Iron Hands, teammates like Dragon Dance Baxcalibur, Clangorous Soul Kommo-o, and Dragon Dance Dragonite can capitalize on these openings to set up and tear through opposing Flying-, Dark-, and Fighting-type teams. Baxcalibur also helps in breaking down bulkier types like Flying, Ground, and Poison, cleans up types like Dragon late-game, and picks off Choice Scarf Enamorus and Meowscarada with Ice Shard. Kommo-o provides powerful priority in Vacuum Wave to deal with Chien-Pao and Kingambit and has the ability to clean types such as Ice and Dark after a Clangorous Soul boost. Wallbreakers like Choice Specs Walking Wake and Choice Band Roaring Moon help Dragapult overwhelm threats such as Alolan Muk, Iron Hands, and Gholdengo, which can be hard to take down for Dragon teams. Alternatively, these teammates can don a Choice Scarf, allowing Walking Wake to deal with Chien-Pao and boosted Baxcalibur and Roaring Moon to obliterate Flutter Mane and opposing Dragapult. Entry hazard support from Grachomp and Dragalge are also great, as they make Dragapult more punishing to swap into, and Dragalge's Toxic Spikes are able to status Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, which lets Dragapult spam Hex and prioritize getting a Substitute up in matchups like Fairy and Fighting. Garchomp also punishes prospective Knock Offs against Dragapult from Roaring Moon, Empoleon, and Iron Treads, thanks to Rough Skin and its typing to punish these threats back. Cyclizar can Shed Tail into Dragapult, enabling it to use another status move. In return, Dragapult dissuades Fighting-type attacks by its mere presence on teams, allowing Cyclizar to more safely enter the field. Cyclizar itself also supports Dragapult by providing a Ghost immunity, which is useful in dealing with foes such as Ceruledge and Gengar, and provides hazard removal to prevent Dragapult from being chipped down and let it more freely set up Substitutes. Hisuian Goodra is a great special wall that is able to take on Choice Scarf Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant for Dragapult. In return, Dragapult burns and wears down opposing defensive pieces like Iron Hands for it.</p>"

        "description": "<p>As the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the Monotype metagame, Choice Specs Dragapult is an excellent offensive threat that deals with Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Greninja for Dragon teams. Draco Meteor and Shadow Ball are helpful against a variety of types lacking the necessary immunities and can be used to decimate types such as Dark, Flying, Fairy, and Ghost. Flamethrower roasts Steel-types such as Corviknight and Scizor without the risk of getting stalled by Pressure, and Thunderbolt nails Toxapex and Dondozo and cleans Water teams late-game. Alternatively, U-turn brings in team mates like Baxcalibur, Garchomp, and Hydreigon, which take advantage of common switch-ins such as Ting Lu, Clodsire, and Kingambit. Infiltrator lets Dragapult bypass dual screens, which is sorely needed to properly deal with Flutter Mane.</p> <p>Since Dragapult excels at cleaning teams with its natural speed, wallbreakers like Nasty Plot Hydreigon, Baxcalibur, and Choice Band Haxorus, as well as entry hazard setters such as Garchomp and Dragalge are excellent teammates. Dragonite loves Dragapult's ability to wear down or outright remove Steel-, Water-, and Ghost-types such as Klefki, Toxapex, and Skeledirge, allowing it to clean up types such as Fairy, Water, and Fire with a Dragon Dance or Choice Band set. Choice Scarf users like Baxcalibur, Hydreigon, and Roaring Moon are appreciated, as these deal with opposing Choice Scarf users such as Gallade and Gholdengo, which revenge kill Dragapult with ease. Cyclizar provides entry hazard removal and can pass a Shed Tail to Dragapult, allowing it to get in the field safely.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance (Ghost)": {
        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance gives Dragapult the ability to not just boost its fantastic Speed to new heights, allowing it to outspeed fast Choice Scarf users such as Meowscarada and Roaring Moon, but also beef up its decent Attack stat. Dragon Darts is a reliable, hard-hitting Dragon-type STAB move that allows Dragapult to break Breloom's Focus Sash and Dragonite's Multiscale. Phantom Force is Dragapult's best choice for Ghost-tpye STAB move, as otherwise it is walled by any Fairy- or Steel-type, while Disable can disrupt Choice-locked Pokemon from potentially breaking its Substitute or attacking Dragapult in general. Substitute allows Dragapult to ease prediction and also adds a layer of protection against status moves, allowing it to set up on more passive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Amoonguss. It also synergizes well with Disable, allowing Dragapult to set up with ease. Will-O-Wisp is another option over Disable to allow Clodsire and Quagsire to become setup bait, while also crippling Kingambit and Ting-Lu; however, Disable is more consistent. Leftovers allows Dragapult to use Substitute multiple times throughout a game and be more annoying overall with Disable, while Dragon Fang is a good choice to boost Dragon Darts.</p> <p>Skeledirge is a fantastic partner, as it can wall Fairy-types such as Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Hatterene while also threatening foes like Kingambit that can easily take out Dragapult with their STAB priority moves. Gholdengo is another fantastic partner that can threaten Fairy-types like Klefki and Flutter Mane, if Gholdengo uses a Choice Scarf, and take care of physical walls such as opposing Skeledirge. Brambleghast is another good partner, as it can keep entry hazards off of the field, allowing Dragapult to come in multiple times, as well as providing Spikes support to soften up Steel-types such as Gholdengo and Iron Treads. Hisuian Zoroark provides the team with not just a Ghost immunity, but also can easily use Illusion to disguise itself as Dragapult and lure in foes that would normally threaten it, such as Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and opposing Dragapult, to open up for a potential Dragapult sweep. Flutter Mane is another great partner thanks to its ability to handle opposing Dragon-types such as Baxcalibur, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake. It can also provide immediate speed control if need be to take care of other Choice Scarf users that could revenge kill Dragapult before it gets a Dragon Dance up. Mimikyu is an amazing wallbreaker that can either help wear down physical walls for Dragapult to clean up or can take advantage of Dragapult punching holes in the opponent's team to clean up itself. Mimikyu can also heavily threaten opposing Ghost-types for Dragapult like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo thanks to its STAB priority in Shadow Sneak. It also provides a one-time check to setup sweepers such as Chien-Pao and Kingambit thanks to its ability Disguise.</p>"

Substitute allows Zamazenta to take advantage of passive foes such as Gliscor, Clodsire, and Amoonguss that can't break its Substitute in one hit, allowing it to start setting up Iron Defense and preventing it from being hindered by status. Heavy Slam is important, as Zamazenta outspeeds big Fairy-type threats such as non-Choice Scarf Enamorus and Flutter Mane. Heavy Slam also prevents Zamazenta from being walled by Iron Valiant in the Fighting mirror matchup. 252 Speed EVs allow Zamazenta to outspeed Jolly Barraskewda outside of rain and Flutter Mane, while 248 HP EVs allow it to set up four Substitutes.</p> <p>Iron Hands, with its great special bulk paired with Assault Vest, complements Zamazenta's physical bulk well, being able to take hits from threatening Pokemon such as Flutter Mane and Hatterene while also being a big help in the Flying matchup with its access to Ice Punch and Thunder Punch to hit Zapdos and Enamorus-T. Great Tusk provides great physical bulk alongside Zamazenta and is also able to bring wallbreaking potential, with access to Ice Spinner to hit Flying-types such as Gliscor and Headlong Rush to hit Poison-types such as Unaware Clodsire and Toxapex, which are both hindrances for Zamazenta. Great Tusk is also able to remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin to prevent passive chip on Zamazenta while also running Knock Off to prevent Ghost-types from spinblocking. Iron Valiant provides the special offense Fighting desperately needs in order to break physical walls such as Dondozo and Slowbro that Zamazenta struggles against, and is also able to hit Ghost-types that can wall Zamazenta, such as Skeledirge and Sinistcha, with Shadow Ball. Iron Valiant can also run Trick to disable Toxapex and Clodsire and stop them from stalling out Zamazenta. Sneasler provides great coverage against Fairy-types, with Dire Claw being able to hit threats such as Enamorus. Additionally, Choice Scarf Sneasler outspeeds Choice Specs Flutter Mane while also being able to set up Toxic Spikes to cripple more defensive Pokemon such as Scream Tail. Sneasler also can run Switcheroo to hinder Toxapex and Clodsire, similarly to Iron Valiant. It also offers great pivot potential with U-turn, and can put Pokemon like Unaware Quagsire, which normally walls Zamazenta, on a timer when paired with Poison Touch. Hisuian Lilligant is a great setup threat with its access to Victory Dance and is able to threaten Flying- and Water-types such as Azumarill, Zapdos, and Toxapex with Ice Spinner and Leaf Blade at +1. Hisuian Lilligant also has access to Healing Wish as support for Zamazenta. Choice Band Galarian Zapdos is a great wallbreaker, 2HKOing Toxapex and Sinistcha. Another great wallbreaker is Urshifu-R, which helps with the Ghost matchup because it can deal with Gholdengo and Skeledirge if it is using a Choice Band or after a Swords Dance boost. Gallade is a niche Pokemon to use but helps with the Poison matchup that Zamazenta struggles with, thanks to its access to Sharpness-boosted Psycho Cut. It's also able to run Assault Vest to lure and remove Enamorus's Choice Scarf with Knock Off, which allows Zamazenta to use Heavy Slam against it. Assault Vest also lets Gallade deal with Quagsire and Toxapex instead of forcing a prediction.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Urshifu-R is a good choice on Water teams thanks to its high Attack - further boosted by Swords Dance - and decent Speed tier, allowing it to dispatch many of the metagame's defensive staples such as Unaware Clodsire, Alolan Muk, and Corviknight. Swords Dance allows Urshifu-R to set up on a predicted switch. Surging Strikes is a generally powerful move that allows Urshifu-R to muscle past threats such as Bulk Up Corviknight and defensive Gholdengo after a Swords Dance. Close Combat hits Dark- and Steel-types such as Hydreigon and Hisuian Goodra that try to switch in on Surging Strikes, while Drain Punch is weaker but provides some much-appreciated recovery. Finally, Urshifu-R has many viable options for its 4th moveslot; Aqua Jet deters Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane from attempting to revenge kill Urshifu-R, Thunder Punch hits Flying-types such as Pelipper as well as heavily damaging Toxapex, and Ice Punch hits Water Absorb Clodsire, Garchomp, and Flying-types such as Zapdos and Dragonite. Zen Headbutt can be run to damage Amoonguss and do well against Poison teams. Punching Glove allows Urshifu to gain a small boost to its punching moves while being protected from Zapdos's Static and other contact-punishing abilities.</p> <p>Greninja and Hisuian Samurott are great teammates for Urshifu-R, as they take Psychic-type attacks such as Choice Scarf Indeedee's Psychic and Choice Band Hoopa-U's Zen Headbutt with impunity and punish them with Dark Pulse and Ceaseless Edge, respectively. Hisuian Samurott also sets Spikes to aid in Urshifu-R's wallbreaking efforts, while Greninja can threaten Fighting-types that Urshifu-R struggles with such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Sneasler with Extrasensory. In return, Urshifu-R can take Bug-type attacks such as Choice Band Scizor's U-turn and Choice Scarf Kleavor's X-Scissor, as well as threaten opposing Dark-types such as Chien-Pao. Pelipper provides rain support to augment Urshifu-R's already scary wallbreaking abilities as well as a Grass neutrality to take Choice Scarf Meowscarada's Flower Trick. Toxapex and Quagsire take Fairy- and Electric-type attacks, respectively, while both wearing attackers down with Toxic. Toxapex also removes Toxic Spikes, which can put Urshifu-R on a timer. Gastrodon is an alternative Electric immunity, sacrificing physical bulk for a better specially defensive profile. Rotom-W does well in the Water mirror matchup, as well as doing good damage to Toxapex with Volt Switch. Additionally, it can create setup opportunities for Urshifu-R by burning physical attackers such as Dragonite and Great Tusk thanks to Will-O-Wisp. Barraskewda provides a good source of speed control as well as respectable power, while Basculegion-F is a good special attacker that can blow through common Urshifu-R checks such as physically defensive Toxapex and Quagsire. Both of these appreciate Urshifu-R breaking through their checks: Bulk Up Corviknight for Barraskewda and Gastrodon for Basculegion-F. Finally, Walking Wake can blow through defensive staples such as Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Amoonguss with Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteors. In exchange, Urshifu-R takes care of Hisuian Goodra.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Urshifu-R is a great wallbreaker on Fighting teams thanks to its deadly STAB combination, decent Speed tier, and access to Swords Dance, allowing it to be a good asset versus types like Poison, Water, and Fire. Close Combat is preferred due to its superior damage output; however, Drain Punch may be used instead for recovery and to ignore adverse contact effects thanks to Punching Glove. Aqua Jet threatens frailer revenge killers, taking out faster targets like Flutter Mane, Sandy Shocks, and Volcarona after a Swords Dance boost. Alternatively, Thunder Punch may be used to better deal with Azumarill, Pelipper, and Toxapex, while Zen Headbutt hits Amoonguss in addition to Toxapex and Clodsire. Surging Strikes notably deals with Landorus-T, Skeledirge, and Great Tusk as well as threatening Bulk Up Corviknight and Iron Defense Zamazenta. Other options include Ice Punch to hit Amoonguss while also threatening Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Dragapult and Taunt to prevent Toxapex, Quagsire, and Water Absorb Clodsire from using recovery moves as well as Toxic and Haze. Heavy-Duty Boots improves the matchup against hazard stacking teams like Poison; however, Punching Glove is preferred to use Surging Strikes freely without activating Rocky Helmet chip or Static, easing the Flying matchup and minimizing the need for predictions.</p> <p>Great Tusk is an amazing teammate, providing Stealth Rock to enhance Urshifu-R's wallbreaking abilities and removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin if Urshifu-R isn't using Heavy-Duty Boots. Furthermore, Great Tusk deals with Toxapex if Urshifu-R isn't using coverage to hit it. Iron Hands provides a buffer in the Flying, Water, and Fairy matchup, threatening Corviknight, Pelipper, and Basculegion-F as well as hitting Flutter Mane, Hatterene, and Iron Valiant with Heavy Slam. Furthermore, Assault Vest Iron Hands acts as a great pivot into special attacks, as Urshifu-R's Special Defense is rather lackluster. In return, Urshifu-R deals with the Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads along with Skeledirge. Sneasler is great in the Fairy matchup and provides pivoting and Toxic Spikes to accentuate Urshifu-R's wallbreaking potential. Zamazenta appreciates Urshifu-R heavily wearing down teams to allow it to easily clean up late-game with Iron Defense. Iron Valiant removes threats such as Hisuian Lilligant, Meowscarada, and Greninja while also being a huge asset in the Flying matchup thanks to Thunderbolt. Iron Valiant also values Urshifu-R's ability to break Clodsire and lure in Toxapex.</p>"

Power Whip is an excellent STAB move that allows Zarude to 2HKO Toxapex and Hatterene. Drain Punch grants Zarude a form of recovery while still 2HKOing Hisuian Goodra and Heatran, whereas Close Combat grants Zarude a stronger Fighting-type coverage. Alternatively, Jungle Healing allows Zarude access to longevity and removing its own status safely, as it forces many switches.</p> <p>Amoonguss is a great defensive partner for Zarude, as it is able to resist Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks from Flutter Mane, Sneasler, and Iron Valiant, melt Toxic Spikes, and spread status for more offensive teammates with either Toxic or Spore. In return, Zarude can threaten the Psychic-types Amoonguss loses to, like Hatterene, Armarouge, and Iron Leaves. Choice Scarf Meowscarada makes for another good teammate, as it can outspeed and threaten Dragon-types such as Dragonite, Dragapult, and Hydreigon with Play Rough. In return, Zarude can handle the aforementioned Steel-types that Meowscarada struggles with, and the two of the form a strong U-turn core to complement their teammates. Hisuian Electrode and Rotom-C is a great addition on any Grass team, as thanks to its Speed tier and Electric typing, it can threaten slower Flying-types such as Corviknight and Enamorus as well as Water-types like Toxapex and Volcanion. Zarude's wallbreaking and support role enables sweepers like Hisuian Liligant to sweep Flying thanks to the latter's access to Ice Spinner as well as being able to clean Steel teams. Brambleghast and Toedscruel make for great teammates, as they can set up hazards to wear down incoming Pokemon for Zarude to break easier and remove them with Rapid Spin to enhance Zarude's pivoting ability. Toedscruel also has enough Special Defense to survive a Flamethrower from Choice Scarf Iron Moth and OHKO it back. On the other hand, Brambleghast's Ghost typing also allows it to spinblock, thus preserving hazards on the field, and thanks to its ability Wind Rider, it can switch into anticipated Flying-type attacks. Iron Leaves makes for another great partner, being able to provide Grass teams a positive matchup against Fighting and Poison teams. In return, Zarude can threaten the Ghost-types it struggles with, like Skeledirge and Gholdengo.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Regieleki offers Electric teams an incredibly fast cleaner and pivot, shocking threats such as Iron Valiant, Spectrier, and Greninja. Volt Switch lets Regieleki punish foes like Amoonguss, Galarian Slowking, and Hisuian Goodra, which can take advantage of it, allowing teammates like Zapdos and Iron Hands to exploit them instead. Rapid Spin leverages Regieleki's capability to force opponents to bring in a Ground-type or risk significant damage, providing Electric teams with much-needed entry hazard control. Thunder Wave mitigates the threat of Hisuian Lilligant, Spectrier, and Zamazenta if Regieleki is unable to finish these off. Heavy-Duty Boots enhances Regieleki's ability to pivot and consistently remove entry hazards. Alternatively, 28 Atk EVs in conjunction with a Naive nature could be considered, and Magnet is recommended when using Regieleki with Wild Charge to secure an OHKO against Flutter Mane. Magnet also enables Regieleki to reach specific damage thresholds, such as OHKOing Iron Valiant with Thunderbolt. A Timid or Naive nature with maximum Speed EVs is needed to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Hisuian Zoroark.</p> <p>Given that Ground-types like Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Quagsire shut down Regieleki's antics, teammates like Nasty Plot Rotom-W, Swords Dance Iron Hands, and Substitute Zapdos that capitalize on these are crucial for its success. It's important to keep in mind that the player using Regieleki can also choose to double out when anticipating a Ground-type switch-in, allowing teammates to threaten these walls. In return, Regieleki eliminates Greninja, Iron Valiant, and Chien-Pao, which threaten its allies. Magnezone can equip an Assault Vest to check Choice Scarf users like Flutter Mane and Greninja, which zoom past Regieleki, and it can wear down Landorus-T and Quagsire as they repeatedly switch in. Sandy Shocks provides entry hazards to further wear down the opposing team, is bulky enough to bear a hit from and deal with Choice Scarf Sneasler, and puts pressure on Quagsire and Glimmora. Pawmot handles fast Ground-types like Landorus, applies pressure on Flying and Water teams with its Ice- and Grass-type coverage, and grants Regieleki a second chance at sweeping through Revival Blessing. Thundurus-T and Rotom-C are also appreciated, as Thundurus-T provides colorful coverage to deal with Poison- and Ground-types like Amoonguss and Great Tusk, while Rotom-C is able to greatly threaten the entirety of Water teams with its STAB moves.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Spectrier is a deadly special attacker that is able to quickly snowball against teams thanks to its high Speed, outrinning some of the metagame's fastest threats like Greninja and Iron Valiant. Spectrier utilizes Draining Kiss to hit Dark-type Pokemon that would otherwise resist its STAB Shadow Ball like the aforementioned Greninja as well as non-Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Roaring Moon. Draining Kiss also serves as a secondary recovery option to help heal off the damage taken by setting up a Substitute. Nasty Plot is used to elevate Spectrier's Special Attack to incredible heights without having to KO foes beforehand. Spectrier shines best when it is able to set up a Substitute, and subsequently a Nasty Plot, in the face of a more passive foe like Toxapex, then begin spamming its scarcely resisted Shadow Ball + Draining Kiss combination. Leftovers is used to provide more substantial recovery than Draining Kiss, but Colbur Berry is an option to take a Dark-type attack from Pokemon like Choice Scarf Great Tusk, Chien-Pao, and Barraskewda. Will-O-Wisp should be used instead of Substitute if Colbur Berry is the item of choice, as it allows Spectrier to capitalize on surviving an attack from these extremely potent physical threats. If Will-O-Wisp is preferred over Substitute, Hex can also be used to deal more damage to burned threats.</p> <p>Skeledirge can switch into strong physical attacks from Pokemon that threaten Spectrier such as Choice Scarf Gallade, Scizor, Ceruledge, and Mimikyu lacking Shadow Claw, then scare them with Will-O-Wisp. Mimikyu is also a great teammate, as it can help Spectrier deal with Pokemon that may not go down to a single Draining Kiss, such as Ting-Lu, as well as Kingambit and Chien-Pao if Disguise is in tact. Mimikyu is also able to finish off threats such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult with Shadow Sneak. Froslass and Brambleghast are teammates that work well with Spectrier, setting up Spikes for Spectrier to nab easier KOs and snowball with Grim Neigh. Froslass is also able to use Thunder Wave to slow down faster Pokemon, while Brambleghast is able to remove entry hazards via Rapid Spin, allowing Spectrier to pivot more freely. Choice Scarf Flutter Mane is a great teammate thanks to its incredible Speed and ablility to deal with common Choice Scarf users that give Spectrier trouble such as Gholdengo, Hisuian Samurott and Great Tusk. STAB Moonblast can also damage or remove Dark-type Pokemon to make Spectrier's job easier. Finally, Hisuian Zoroark is a solid teammate due to its ability to switch into Ghost-type attacks that would otherwise threaten Spectrier and all of its other teammates. Hisuian Zoroark can also apply utility support by wearing down opposing teams with Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off. Dragapult is a great teammate, as it can burn and force damage on common walls like Quagsire, Clodsire, Alolan Muk and Ting-Lu, and forcing damage on them to make sweeping easier. It is also important to note that burned Quagsire and Clodsire cannot break Spectrier's Substitute in one hit, making setting up a lot easier. Finally, bulky Nasty Plot Gholdengo is a great teammate for Spectrier. Gholdengo can wear down Dark- and Poison-type Pokemon like Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Clodsire, which Spectrier struggle with, while Spectrier can help with faster threats like Dragon- and Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Hydreigon and Great Tusk.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Spectrier is an exceptional setup sweeper on Ghost teams due to its great Speed tier, incredible ability, and access to various utility options, allowing it to snowball through Poison, Ground, and Flying teams. Spectrier's combination of Calm Mind and Will-O-Wisp is notably important, as it allows Spectrier to be an annoyance to both physical and special attackers. Hex in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp deals immense damage versus threats like Corviknight, Toxapex, and Hisuian Goodra as well as takes advantage of Pokemon reliant on status ailments to function such as Poison Heal Gliscor and Guts Heracross. Substitute protects Spectrier from status ailments inflicted by passive Pokemon like Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Quagsire. Furthermore, Substitute provides more opportunities to set up Calm Mind boosts and denies the opponent of a chance to revenge kill Spectrier. The given EV spread allows Spectrier to outpace non-Choice Scarf Meowscarada, prevents Spectrier's Substitute from being broken by burned Assault Vest Iron Hands, and prevents Spectrier from being OHKOed by a burned Supreme Overlord Kingambit using Kowtwo Kleave with five fainted allies.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Flutter Mane is incredibly valued as a teammate due to its ability to threaten Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon like Choice Scarf Greninja, Baxcalibur, Galarian Moltres, and Choice Scarf Roaring Moon as well as faster Ghost-types such as Swift Swim Basculegion, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. In return, Spectrier threatens special walls like Hisuian Goodra, Clodsire, and Gliscor. Focus Sash Ceruledge threatens special walls like Articuno and Heatran as well as takes on faster Ghost-types such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult with Shadow Sneak, appreciating Spectrier's ability to burn walls. Air Balloon Gholdengo is a great asset in the Fairy and Ice matchups, beating Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Baxcalibur, and Alolan Ninetales as well as Ursaluna-B and Empoleon. Hex Dragapult spreads even more status ailments to set up Spectrier for success late-game and threatens Kommo-o, Hydreigon, and Baxcalibur. Additionally, Choice Band Dragapult 2HKOes Alolan Muk with Dragon Darts, threatens opposing Dragapult and Choice Scarf Gholdengo with Sucker Punch, and OHKOes Hoopa-U with U-turn, also offering pivoting. Choice Scarf Dragapult also provides U-turn and can outpace Choice Scarf users like Roaring Moon and Walking Wake. Brambleghast and Froslass wear down defensive switch-ins such as Heatran, Ting-Lu, and Alolan Muk with Spikes, while Brambleghast also removes Toxic Spikes using Rapid Spin. Hisuian Zoroark offers a Ghost-type immunity and can spread burn with Will-O-Wisp, easing Spectrier's time setting up. Skeledirge checks Ogerpon-H, Choice Scarf Infernape, and Heatran using Earth Power and takes on setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Frosmoth while also outpacing Kingambit. Mimikyu checks Dark-types like Hoopa-U, Choice Scarf Meowscarada, and Hydreigon while also offering a one-time check to Chien-Pao, Greninja, and Kingambit due to Disguise. Sinistcha beats Water-types like Barraskewda and Urshifu-R as well as Ground-types such as Ursaluna-B and Landorus. Gengar offers Toxic Spikes to accumulate chip damage via Spectrier's Substitute and enhance the power of Hex.</p>"

Thanks to a Jolly nature and Choice Scarf, it's able to outspeed foes such as Flutter Mane, Chien Pao, and Dragapult and deal heavy damage. Sharpness-boosted Stone Axe smashes common Flying- and Fire- types, such as Enamorus, Skeledirge, and Cinderace, while also setting up Stealth Rock in the same turn. Night Slash punishes Gholdengo, which resists all of Kleavor's other moves, though be wary that Kleavor can only 2HKO it even with Stealth Rock up. Aerial Ace is also an option to hit Great Tusk if it tries to switch in and remove entry hazards set by Kleavor. U-turn picks up momentum for the team and switches Kleavor out against foes such as Landorus-T, Iron Hands, and Azumarill. X-Scissor can be used to deal much more damage than U-turn thanks to being boosted by Sharpness, 2HKOing Amoonguss and Sableye. Close Combat helps Kleavor deal with Steel-types such as Kingambit and Heatran, though the latter requires chip damage to OHKO.</p> <p>All of Kleavor's teammates enjoy its ability to set up Stealth Rock while also dealing damage in the same turn. Volcarona and Frosmoth appreciate Kleavor's entry hazard support wearing down the opposing team and its ability to deal with Flying- and Fire-types, which enable them to set up and sweep late-game. In return, Volcarona can deal with Steel-types such as Corviknight and Gholdengo, while Frosmoth can deal with Ground- and Water-types such as Landorus-Th and Quagsire. Frosmoth is also a wincon against Flying- and Dragon-types when Stealth Rock is set up. Scizor acts as a sweeper that takes advantage of Kleavor weakening opposing teams, and it also forms a U-turn core that appreciates Kleavor's Fire neutrality with it. Additionally, Scizor can block Toxic from Clodsire and Mortal Spin from Glimmora, and threaten them with either Choice Band-boosted Bullet Punch or setting up with Swords Dance. Lokix, Heracross, and Slither Wing also appreciate the opposing team being weakened by Kleavor, as well as the speed control Kleavor provides. This enables them to finish off foes by making use of priority moves and strong physical attacks, such as Lokix taking out Gholdengo with Sucker Punch or Throat Chop. Forretress provides great hazard control thanks to Rapid Spin, and it's also able to switch into strong physical attacks to scout thanks to its high physical defense and additional Steel typing that grants valuable neutralities that cover Kleavor's weaknesses. Forretress also makes a good pivot thanks to its slow speed and access to Volt Switch.</p>"

After Flame Orb activates, Facade 2HKOes the bulkiest Pokemon in the metagame such as Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Amoonguss. Because of Flame Orb, Ursaluna can also function as a great status absorber. Earthquake is preferred over Headlong Rush, because it allows Ursaluna to maintain its remarkable bulk as well as having the added benefit of avoiding Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin damage. Swords Dance can be used to bolster Ursaluna's Attack to incredible heights, giving everything a tough time switching in. Drain Punch can be used to give Ursaluna more longevity, while Fire Punch can be used to hit targets like Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo for super effective damage. Alternatively, Ursaluna can run 140 Speed EVs in order to keep up with other pokemon in its Speed tier, such as Kingambit, and outspeeding slightly faster Pokemon that do not run any Speed investment such as Corviknight and Skeledirge. Max HP is used to maximize Ursaluna's bulk, while the 4 Speed EVs are used to outspeed any uninvested Pokemon of the same Speed tier, such as Iron Hands and Alolan Muk.</p> <p>Ursaluna greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Ting-Lu and Quagsire, as the extra damage could be the difference between a 2HKO and a 1HKO on physically defensive Rotom-W. Ursaluna also appreciates a teammate like Clodsire, which can switch into Water- and Fighting-type attacks from Urshifu-R, Azumarill, and Sneasler, both of which Ursaluna is weak to. Another great teammate for Ursaluna is Landorus-T, which can U-turn and allow Ursaluna to come in freely and launch its extremely powerful attacks. Alternatively, Landorus-I is a fantastic teammate for Ursaluna. Ursaluna is able to deal with the special walls that check Landorus and vice versa. Iron Treads is another great teammate for Ursaluna, as it keeps hazards off the field in order to prevent Ursaluna from taking more damage. Bulkier Pokemon that want to stick around for a long time, such as Ting-Lu, Quagsire, and Clodsire, greatly appreciate Ursaluna's presence, as it can freely switch in to status moves and Knock Off once Flame Orb has activated. Finally, Choice Scarf Great Tusk is another teammate that appreciates Ursaluna. Great Tusk is able to outspeed and OHKO Pokemon that check Ursaluna such as Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Choice Specs Greninja. Once Ursaluna has sufficiently weakened the opposing team, Great Tusk will have an easy time finishing the game with its high speed and powerful attacks.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Boasting a great Special Attack stat, substantial physical bulk, and access to recovery, Ursaluna-B is a premier wallbreaker on Ground teams, offering major support in the Dark, Ghost, and Dragon matchups. Blood Moon paired with Mind's Eye allows Ursaluna-B to OHKO Ghost-type threats like Brambleghast, Dragapult, and Spectrier while also doing considerable damage to walls such as Rotom-W, Gliscor, and Gastrodon. Earth Power nails Steel-types such as Heatran, Hisuian Goodra, and Empoleon, forming a nearly unresisted combination of coverage with Blood Moon. Vacuum Wave prevents Ursaluna-B from being revenge killed by faster Ice-type threats, OHKOing Alolan Sandslash and having a chance to OHKO Chien-Pao. Wise Glasses may be used instead of Heavy-Duty Boots to secure an OHKO on Chien-Pao as well as make it easier to clean up weakened Meowscarada, Greninja, and Darkrai. However, Ursaluna-B is often pivoted in due to its bulk, putting it at risk for chip damage if not running Heavy-Duty Boots. The given EV spread allows Ursaluna-B to outpace uninvested Hisuian Goodra, Clefable, and Empoleon while maximizing power and bulk.</p> <p>Gliscor is an excellent teammate due to its resistance to Fighting, switching into Great Tusk, Infernape, and Sneasler for Ursaluna-B. Furthermore, Ursaluna-B recieves a plethora of utility support from Gliscor via Toxic, Spikes, and pivoting with U-turn, enhancing Ursaluna-B as a wallbreaker. In return, Ursaluna-B picks off Chien-Pao and swaps into Ghost-type moves from Hisuian Zoroark, Skeledirge, and Spectrier. Furthermore, Ursaluna-B can sponge Ice Spinner from Great Tusk and Iron Treads using Gliscor's Protect to scout them. Iron Treads is appreciated due to its entry hazard removing ability and Steel typing, warding off Ice- and Fairy-types, such as Alolan Ninetales, Flutter Mane, and Frosmoth, as well as switching into Toxic. In return, Ursaluna-B breaks past Ground-types like Gliscor, defensive Great Tusk, and Quagsire. Clodsire and Gastrodon offer an immunity to Water-type attacks from Barraskewda, Greninja, and Walking Wake while also setting up a mix of entry hazards to wear down teams for Ursaluna-B. Additionally, Clodsire is a very bulky specially defensive wall, capable of fighting off Grass- and Fairy-types such as Meowscarada, Iron Valiant, Sinistcha, and Alolan Ninetales, while Ursaluna-B threatens Sableye and Hatterene for Clodsire. Choice Scarf Great Tusk outpaces and removes threats like Baxcalibur, Mamoswine, and Ogerpon-W. Great Tusk, in return, appreciates the removal or weakening of Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Gliscor. Choice Scarf Landorus provides a Fighting-type resistance and an adequate Speed tier threatening Great Tusk and Zamazenta while also removing Dragon Dance Baxcalibur lacking Ice Shard. Mamoswine is heavily valued due to its ability Thick Fat, allowing it to combat Alolan Ninetales, Articuno, and non-Choice Band Chien-Pao as well as Grass-types like Meowscarada and Hisuian Lilligant using Ice Shard. In return, Ursaluna-B threatens Rotom-W and Skeledirge. Garchomp is a valued wallbreaker due to its ability to take out Kommo-o, Ogerpon-W, and Baxcalibur lacking Ice Shard while appreciating Ursaluna-B removing physically defensive walls. Quagsire provides chip damage buildup with Stealth Rock and Toxic as well as checks threats such as Chien-Pao, Zamazenta, and Azumarill. Sandy Shocks is a great asset in the Water and Flying matchups, threatening Urshifu-R, Corviknight, Basculegion-F, and Pelipper as well as stacking entry hazards for Ursaluna-B's wallbreaking.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Poison)": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Sneasler is one of the best cleaners for Poison teams thanks to its powerful STAB moves, like Dire Claw and Close Combat, along with U-turn, which allows Poison teams to preserve momentum while threatening poison with Poison Touch. Choice Scarf allows Sneasler to outspeed Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Regieleki, and opposing Choice Scarf threats like Hisuian Samurott, Enamorus, Iron Treads, Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon and Cinderace. Dire Claw paired with Sneasler's ability Poison Touch gives it a 41.67% chance to inflict poison upon foes, which helps to gradually wear down walls like Ting-Lu and Quagsire, along with a 23.33% chance to inflict paralysis or sleep, disrupting the threat that opposing sweepers pose to the team. While Steel-types are immune to Sneasler's Dire Claw, it can still threaten some of them such as Heatran and Iron Treads with Close Combat. Paired with Switcheroo, it is able to deny opposing walls like Toxapex and Corviknight recovery by passing them the Choice Scarf and forcing them to lock into one move. With the threat of Switcheroo, it also reduces the threat of Pokemon like Dragon Dance Dragonite.</p> <p>Sneasler pairs well with Amoonguss, which threatens to use Spore against foes and threatens walls like Quagsire and Gastrodon with Giga Drain, along with offensive Pokemon like Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Although Amoonguss can act as a switch-in to Landorus-T, it gets completely countered by its Substitute + Bulk Up set. In addition to that, Amoonguss can use Foul Play to dissuade Ghost-type wallbreakers like Dragapult and Mimikyu from setting up with Dragon Dance and Swords Dance, respectively. Galarian Slowking also synergizes incredibly well with Sneasler, as they form a pivoting core with U-turn and Chilly Reception. Galarian Slowking appreciates Sneasler breaking through Steel-types and spreading status, and Galarian Slowking can support Sneasler by threatening opposing Poison-types with Future Sight, switching in on Gholdengo and threatening it with Flamethrower, and tanking one Earth Power from Landorus and OHKOing it with Ice Beam if Galarian Slowking is running Assault Vest. Toxapex can set up Toxic Spikes for Sneasler to clean easily while the opposing team takes residual damage. It also forms a Regenerator core with Amoonguss and Galarian Slowking and aids Alolan Muk against setup with Haze, thus synergizing well with the momentum provided by Sneasler's U-turn. Alolan Muk is also a great partner for Sneasler, as it provides an immunity to Psychic-type attacks and boasts great special bulk, which allows it to tank attacks from Choice Specs Dragapult and Spectrier and threaten them with Knock Off. Glimmora can set Stealth Rock to support Sneasler's cleaning capability and spin away entry hazards to prevent Sneasler from being worn down, as well as threatening slow Great Tusk with Energy Ball and being a Ground-immune Pokemon that Sneasler can pivot into with Air Balloon. Iron Moth and Salazzle greatly benefit from Choice Scarf Sneasler beating threats like Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao, allowing them to take out foes like Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Klefki, which Sneasler can't break. Salazzle and Glimmora also form a Corrosion core, which helps in the Poison mirror matchup, which Sneasler struggles with. Clodsire is a great teammate to absorb attacks from Iron Valiant, Greninja, and Skeledirge.</p>"
      },
      "Boots Pivots (Poison)": {
        "description": "<p>Sneasler fills a very unique role on Poison teams, as it's the best offensive pivot the type has access to thanks to an incredible base 130 Attack and 120 Speed stats. U-turn combined with Heavy-Duty Boots will allow it to stay safe throughout the entire game by switching out against an opposing threat to bring that can deal with it; in addition, U-turn comes with a 30% chance to poison thanks to Poison Touch ,which helps make progress when Toxic Spikes aren't down or against Flying-types. Close Combat is a strong nuke against many of the tier's common Dark- and Steel-types like Hydreigon, Kingambit, and Heatran along with other notable Fighting-weak threats such as Baxcalibur, Ursaluna and Hisuian Arcanine. Dire Claw's incredible chance to inflect status allows it to not only slash through prominent Fairy-types like Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Hatterene but also to make progress in matchups where its traits aren't as valuable like Ghost by inflicting crippling statuses on targets like Hisuian Zoroark and Skeledirge. Fake Out can chip threats down and rack up poison damage or fish for poison before using U-turn to leave, while Taunt takes advantage of Sneasler's incredible speed can stop the dangerous status effects from Salazzle and Amoonguss or recovery moves from Toxapex and Corviknight on Flying teams.</p> <p>Thanks to U-turn, Sneasler can bring in teammates such as specially defensive Alolan Muk or physically defensive Amoonguss to handle would-be answers. In particular, Alolan Muk for with special Psychic- and Ghost-types like Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Basculegion-F with its strong STAB Knock Off. Physically defensive Amoonguss can be bought in on many of the Ground- and Water-types that threaten Sneasler like Great Tusk, Quagsire, and Urshifu-R. Any other physical threat that can threaten Sneasler like Kleavor, Hisuian Arcanine, or Swords Dance Mimikyu can be dealt with by physically bulky Rocky Helmet Toxapex thanks to Infestation trapping and Haze to deal with boosts. Galarian Slowking's incredible special bulk can allow it to sponge hits for Sneasler from powerful special attackers such as Zapdos, Articuno, and Moltres and then safely pivot back into Sneasler with Chilly Reception; it can also use Future Sight combined with Sneasler's incredible Fighting STAB move to deal immense damage to any foe wishing to tank the hits for its team. Air Balloon Glimmora is a valuable ally that can fight off Ground-types like Choice Scarf Iron treads and Sandy Shocks, hit powerful Flying-Type threats like Moltres and Dragonite with Power Gem, remove hazards if Sneasler loses its Heavy-Duty Boots, and put threats that Sneasler detests such as Toxapex, Corviknight and Sableye on a timer with Corrosion Toxic. Salazzle can also spread Toxic against these threats and use Encore to punish setup from Hisuian Goodra and Kingambit. Choice Scarf Gengar helps majorly against Ghost-types that can outspeed Sneasler like Spectrier, Dragapult. and Flutter Mane while Choice Specs with Icy Wind can remove high profile threats like Garchomp and both formes of Landorus, with both Choice sets having powerful coverage in Thunderbolt to shock Flying-Types such as Moltres, Corviknight, and Pelipper.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Enamorus is an excellent revenge killer on Flying teams due to its vast coverage, cleric support via Healing Wish, and amazing Speed, allowing it to outpace Hisuian Lilligant after a Victory Dance as well as Choice Specs Greninja, and Chien-Pao, easing the Dark matchup. Moonblast checks foes with Ice-type coverage moves like Pawmot, Chien-Pao, and Greninja, as well as 2HKOing Assault Vest Iron Hands. Superpower hits Steel-types like Kingambit, Hisuian Goodra, and Air Balloon Heatran, allowing Enamorus to snowball Steel teams with Contrary once Gholdengo has been removed. Alternatively, Mystical Fire hits Air Balloon Gholdengo and Corviknight. Earth Power hits Heatran, Toxapex, and Skeledirge, further improving the Steel and Poison matchups. Healing Wish gives new life to setup sweepers like Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Galarian Moltres. Iron Head is another option to hit Flutter Mane and opposing Enamorus; however, Enamorus's other coverage options hit more foes and are generally more valuable.</p> <p>Corviknight checks a plethora of foes, including Flutter Mane, Chien-Pao, and Choice Scarf Greninja, as well as providing Defog support to preserve Enamorus's longevity so it can fight off Sucker Punch Kingambit; however, Landorus-T and Landorus offer an Electric-type immunity, checking threats like Regieleki, Sandy Shocks, and Magnezone. Furthermore, Bulk Up Landorus-T is a massive asset in the Poison and Steel matchups, notably setting up on Amoonguss and forcing Heatran out. Dragonite is fearsome in the Water and Flying mirror matchups and heavily appreciates Healing Wish support in return. Moltres is a great check to Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Gholdengo due to its excellent bulk and ability to burn the former two. Articuno's exemplary bulk and neutrality to Ice-type moves is heavily appreciated, allowing it to check Greninja and Basculegion-F with Freeze-Dry to further improve the Water matchup Zapdos spreads paralysis via Static and Discharge as well as aiding in the Water matchup. In return, Enamorus removes Choice Specs Greninja to let Zapdos effectively wall most Water teams. Galarian Moltres is great in the Ghost matchup, taking on Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Spectrier.</p>"

Flower Trick makes Meowscarada a great late-game cleaner against Ground and Water teams, or just in general, taking out threats such as Great Tusk, Greninja, and Flutter Mane. Knock Off can target Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon, such as Gholdengo and Espathra, while removing items from walls such as Toxapex's Black Sludge, Klefki's Light Clay, and Skeledirge's Heavy-Duty Boots. Play Rough allows Meowscarada to clean through weakened Dragon teams, and it's a useful move late-game against other Dark teams. Alternatively, Meowscarada can run Toxic Spikes to cripple foes such as Great Tusk. U-turn picks up momentum for its team on forced switches, for example against Greninja. Choice Scarf plus its Speed and Protean allows it to take on threats such as Greninja, Choice Scarf Great Tusk, and Choice Specs Flutter Mane.</p> <p>Greninja and Meowscarada can break through each other's checks: Greninja can beat Toxapex and Corviknight for Meowscarada, while Choice Scarf Meowscarada can revenge kill Flutter Mane for Greninja. Chien-Pao can prevent walls such as Toxapex from healing with Taunt, allowing Meowscarada to better pressure Water teams; it can also pressure Flying- and Dragon-types for Meowscarada, beating threats such as Dragonite. Chien-Pao can also break past walls such as Clodsire and Amoonguss for Meowscarada. Kingambit is an incredible late-game sweeper, picking off faster threats like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane with Sucker Punch, and it beats down Fairy-types such as Hatterene for Meowscarada. In return, Meowscarada can pick off Iron Valiant, allowing Kingambit to better pressure Fairy teams. Ting-Lu sets Stealth Rock and Spikes, allowing Meowscarada to clean more easily late-game. Additionally, it can check slower Pokemon such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Clodsire with Taunt alongside Earthquake or Ruination. It can also stomach strong special attacks such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast, OHKOing Flutter Mane in return with Heavy Slam. Sableye can switch into Fighting-type attacks for Meowscarada, such as Great Tusk's Close Combat, and either cripple their users with Prankster Will-O-Wisp or force them to switch with Prankster Encore. Sableye can also prevent Pokemon like Clodsire and Brambleghast from setting entry hazards thanks to Prankster Taunt. Skuntank can ease the Fairy matchup by beating Hatterene one-on-one, which lets Meowscarada set Toxic Spikes safely. It can also trap Klefki with Fire Spin, preventing dual screens from staying on the field for too long.

This is further supported by a great Speed tier, which allows it to serve as a strong cleaner in multiple matchups such as versus Water, Fighting, Dark and Ghost teams with a Choice Scarf. Flower Trick enables Meowscarada to break through Defense boosted Pokemon such as Curse Dondozo, as well as Pokemon behind dual screens such as Flutter Mane. Play Rough provides the Fairy coverage that enables Meowscarada to threaten Fighting, Dragon, and Dark teams. U-turn is used to allow Meowscarada to pivot out against checks to it, such as Toxapex and Skeledirge, to bring in a teammate that can break through it, such as Breloom and Toedscruel, while also maintaining momentum.</p> <p>While Meowscarada is an effective cleaner, it cannot exactly break through certain Pokemon by itself. Choice Band Breloom is a great teammate for Meowscarada, as it can break through Meowscarada's checks such as Toxapex, Kingambit, and Clodsire. Meowscarada is also vulnerable to Pokemon with strong priority and revenge killers faster than it such as Breloom and Choice Scarf Flutter Mane. Defensive walls such as Amoonguss and Wo-Chien can switch into said priority attacks and revenge killing attempts for Meowscarada. Amoonguss in particular also removes Toxic Spikes, which can be useful for Meowscarada and its teammates. Brambleghast and Toedscruel provide entry hazard removal in Rapid Spin, while also setting up hazards of their own in Spikes. Abomasnow gives an important Ice neutrality to Grass teams, which in tandem with the Defense boost provided by Snow allows it to serve as an answer to Ice-type threats such as Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur. Swords Dance Iron Leaves and Rotom-C provide counterplay to Corviknight that Grass teams otherwise lack, with the former appreciating Meowscarada pivoting out to it when facing Poison-types such as Dragalge and Toxapex, threatening Poison teams in general with its Psychic-type STAB moves and Fighting-type coverage attacks, while the latter forms a pivoting core with Meowscarada.</p>"

The given EV spread allows Quaquaval to outpace Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao after a single Rapid Spin or Aqua Step boost, OHKO Flutter Mane after one Moxie boost, and better deal with priority moves from Breloom and Kingambit.</p> <p>Greninja breaks past troublesome walls like Toxapex, Sableye, and Water Absorb Clodsire due to its wide range of coverage. Toxapex serves as an answer to threats like Meowscarada, Breloom, and Iron Valiant, sets up Toxic Spikes, and hinders Pokemon like Rotom-W, Dragonite, and Quagsire with Toxic. Gastrodon and Quagsire are valued for their Electric-type immunity against Pokemon like Rotom-W, Sandy Shocks, and Magnezon as well as their entry hazards, supporting Quaquaval as a cleaner. Pelipper can set rain to boost Quaquaval's Aqua Step and pressures Grass-types like Breloom, Infiltrator Brambleghast, and Meowscarada with Hurricane. Slowking can safely pivot into Quaquaval with Chilly Reception and aids in late-game cleaning with Future Sight.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With access to nearly unresisted First Impression and U-turn due to Tinted Lens, Lokix is an amazing revenge killer for Bug teams. Its ability to scare out many common threats such as Espathra, Chien-Pao, and Dragapult is highly valuable. Lokix struggles to break past many physically defensive walls like Quagsire, Dondozo, and Corviknight; however, it can pivot in teammates—such as Vivillon and Volcarona—that can beat them. A Choice Band with an Adamant nature maximizes Lokix's damage output and can utilise Axe Kick to lure and defeat Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. Alternatively, Life Orb avoids a Choice lock and makes use of Sucker Punch to pick off threats that First Impression alone cannot such as Gholdengo and Flutter Mane. Throat Chop lets Lokix deal good unresisted STAB damage and prevents Skeledirge from using Torch Song, which is extremely valuable and one of the reasons Lokix is a necessity for Bug teams.</p> <p>Lokix is highly susceptible to entry hazards and is often not quite strong enough to OHKO many Pokemon. Forretress is a great entry hazard remover and entry hazard setter, fixing both of those issues. Forretress also has a good defensive profile, acting as a sponge for absorbing damage, and it can even form a VoltTurn core with Lokix. Scizor removes Fairy-types that threaten Lokix such as Hatterene and Iron Valiant and allows Lokix to clean up after it has done enough damage. Volcarona takes care of Steel-types that don't fall to Axe Kick such as Corviknight and Scizor. Lokix can remove Ghost-types—such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Flutter Mane—to enable Slither Wing and Heracross, letting them spam their powerful Fighting-type moves and clean up after Lokix. Frosmoth can deal with many bulky Ground-types—such as Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu—and Vivillon improves the Fighting-type matchup by beating Great Tusk, Gallade, and Paldean Tauros-W and can answer Dondozo with the combination of Sleep Powder and Energy Ball. Masquerain can set up Sticky Web, which gives Lokix an amazing Speed advantage versus Iron Treads, Iron Moth, and Walking Wake, making Life Orb Lokix immensely threatening.</p>"

      "All-out Attacker (Electric)": {
        "description": "<p>Pawmot is a great wallbreaker on Electric teams, outspeeding foes like Garchomp, Landorus, and Sandy Shocks. Close Combat does not receive the benefits of Pawmot's ability and item, but it helps beat pesky foes like Ursaluna-B, Hisuian Goodra, and Baxcalibur, which are immune to or resist its Electric-type attacks. Close Combat is also a good move to beat foes like Ting-Lu and Kingambit which Pawmot's teammates might struggle against. Thunder Punch is an alternative STAB move, as it hits common walls like Corviknight and Toxapex while also threatening Pelipper on rain teams, thus preventing the opponent from setting up rain for Barraskewda repeatedly. Thunder Punch also helps versus Belly Drum Azumarill, preventing it from setting up. Mach Punch is Pawmot's preferred second STAB move, as it offers strong priority, securing an OHKO on foes like Chien-Pao, Meowscarada, and Greninja after a single layer of Spikes. Mach Punch also nullifies Kingambit's Sucker Punch by outspeeding it with priority. Revival Blessing is another alternative that can be used over Mach Punch, as it offers a unique and valuable type of utility by allowing a teammate to be revived. This may prove to be a huge benefit in some matchups like the Electric mirror, where Pawmot can revive teammates like Sandy Shocks after the opposing Rotom-W is low on HP or has already fainted. Ice Punch hits foes like the Landorus formes, Gliscor, Clodsire, and mixed Amoonguss. The last coverage move is Seed Bomb, as it hits Pokemon like Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Rotom-W, which can prove troublesome for Pawmot's teammates to break. Seed Bomb also compounds with Thunder Punch to hit every Water-type in the game for super effective damage, making Pawmot incredibly powerful in the Water matchup. Punching Glove helps Pawmot avoid chip damage from Rocky Helmet on foes like Rough Skin Garchomp while also avoiding status effects like burn from foes like Flame Body Volcarona, Moltres, and Talonflame.</p> <p>Pawmot greatly benefits from teammates like Regieleki, which can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards for Pawmot and pivot well into other teammates with the help of Volt Switch. Regieleki's extremely high Speed tier also allows it to revenge kill foes like Enamorus, weakened Walking Wake, and, if using Magnet and Wild Charge, Flutter Mane. In return, Regieleki appreciates Pawmot dealing with Ground-type Pokemon, like Quagsire and Gliscor, with the help of Seed Bomb and Ice Punch due to Regieleki's lack of coverage moves. Iron Hands is another great teammate, as it allows Pawmot to run alternative sets, like Thunder Punch over Fighting-type STAB moves, since Iron Hands can run these moves in its stead. Assault Vest Iron Hands also has immense bulk and acts like a sponge for special attacks from foes like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane and Volcarona, which can cause great problems for Pawmot, since it is relatively frail. Iron Hands can also slow pivot into Pawmot with the help of Volt Switch. In return, Pawmot deals with walls like Quagsire and offensive Rotom-W, which Iron Hands may face difficulty in breaking. Sandy Shocks sets hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes to boost Pawmot's wallbreaking potential by providing necessary chip on foes while also being able to provide a Ground immunity thanks to Air Balloon, thus behaving like a switch-in against foes like opposing Sandy Shocks, Choice Scarf Iron Treads, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge. In exchange, Pawmot helps break foes like the Landorus formes and Gliscor that wall Sandy Shocks completely. Pawmot also threatens foes like Baxcalibur, Dragonite, mixed Amoonguss, and Galarian Slowking, which can cause problems for Sandy Shocks. Rotom-W is an essential teammate for Pawmot, as it provides a much-needed Ground immunity while also offering great utility with its defensive sets that run Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave. Hydro Pump on Rotom-W deals with pesky Ground-types like Great Tusk and Mamoswine, which Pawmot struggles against. Defensive Rotom-W benefits from Pawmot's ability to take down foes like Water Absorb Clodsire and Gastrodon. Thus, together they form a strong core on Electric-type teams. Teammates like Thundurus, Thundurus-T and Zapdos provide a Ground immunity for Pawmot while also threatening strong Fighting-type foes like Zamazenta and Great Tusk. Zapdos can break these physically bulky Pokemon with the help of Hurricane, while Thundurus-T can use Psychic as a coverage move for Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and physically defensive Amoonguss. In return, they appreciate Pawmot's ability to break specially defensive walls that hinder Zapdos and Thundurus-T's wallbreaking capability. Thundurus provides great support with Prankster Thunder Wave, paralyzing fast foes like Dragapult and Flutter Mane and allowing Pawmot to outspeed them. Magnezone pairs well with Pawmot, as it can act like a sponge for Fairy-type moves from foes like Hatterene, Iron Valiant, and Flutter Mane and force them out with Flash Cannon. In return, Pawmot helps to break special walls like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire, which Magnezone can't break.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Electric)": {
        "description": "<p>Pawmot is a great Choice Scarf user on Electric teams by virtue of its coverage and utility, being able to deal with Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane. With Revival Blessing, Pawmot can give second chances to fallen offensive Pokemon such as Iron Hands and Choice Specs Zapdos to punch holes in opposing teams. Double Shock allows Pawmot to OHKO threats such as Flutter Mane and Azumarill as well as finishing off Iron Valiant, but this comes with the downside of Pawmot immediately being forced out after using the move. Ice Punch allows Pawmot to deal decent damage to Ground-types that resist both its STAB moves, notably OHKOing both Landorus formes as well as 2HKOing both Iron Leaves and Clodsire. Volt Switch allows Pawmot to pivot out of a check such as Amoonguss into one of its teammates to deal with it. Play Rough and Seed Bomb are usable alternatives, with Play Rough being able to 2HKO Sableye while still hitting Dragon-types and Seed Bomb dealing with Water/Ground types that most Electric-type Pokemon cannot handle efficiently. Notably, Seed Bomb OHKOes specially defensive Gastrodon and 2HKOes physically defensive Quagsire. Grass Knot can also be used, being able to 2HKO Quagsire as well as Great Tusk.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks provides great hazard support to wear down incoming foes for Pawmot to take advantage of. Ground-immune Pokemon such as Zapdos and Rotom-W are appreciated by Pawmot, being able to switch into an anticipated Ground-type attack from the likes of Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Zapdos can also threaten Grass-types such as Amoonguss, while Rotom-W together with Pawmot can overwhelm Quagsire. In return, Pawmot can revive one of them so it can continue checking Ground-types when needed. Regieleki provides hazard removal and a fast pivot for Electric teams, and in return it appreciates Ground-types being lured in and removed by Seed Bomb Pawmot variants. Assault Vest Iron Hands is another great teammate, being able to switch into attacks that could OHKO Pawmot such as Dragapult's Draco Meteor and Enamorus's Moonblast. Iron Hands can also OHKO the latter when running Heavy Slam. In return, Pawmot can run Seed Bomb to handle Water/Ground types Iron Hands cannot efficiently threaten such as Quagsire, and Swords Dance variants of Iron Hands appreciate it removing Flutter Mane and wearing down Sableye. Magnezone is a great partner, being able to threaten the Fairy-types that can threaten Pawmot such as Hatterene and Flutter Mane.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Garganacl eases the Water and Steel matchups thanks to its signature move, Salt Cure. Iron Defense allows Garganacl to set up, tanking super effective physical hits due to its astronomical base 130 Defense, while also boosting the power of Body Press, which helps nail Dark- and Steel-types such as Ting-Lu, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit. Curse is another option that can buff its Attack, boosting the damage of Salt Cure, but it prevents Garganacl from easily stonewalling physical attackers—such as Dragonite and defensive Quaquaval—and also lowers Garganacl's Speed. Salt Cure is a fantastic STAB move, neutering setup sweepers such as Mimikyu, Corviknight, and Hatterene, as it puts them on a timer, which Garganacl can potentially stall out as it sets up or heals via Recover. Purifying Salt is particularly useful, as it allows Garganacl to absorb incoming status moves such as Toxic from Quagsire or Toxapex as well as Will-O-Wisp from Dragapult or Sableye and punish them with Salt Cure. Garganacl is also able to tank Ghost-type STAB moves from the likes of Choice-locked Flutter Mane and Dragapult. Leftovers is the best item to provide passive recovery; however, Heavy-Duty Boots can allow Garganacl to come in without taking entry hazard damage, as entry hazard stacking is extremely common. As an alternative to the given EVs, 52 Defense EVs with an Impish nature let Garganacl potentially overwhelm Choice Band Scizor, Tinkaton, and defensive Quaquaval if used with Iron Defense.</p> <p>Tyranitar is an amazing partner for Garganacl, as it sets sand. Tyranitar can also be used as one of the few special attackers Rock teams have access to to nail physical walls such as Great Tusk with Ice Beam; it is also Rock's best check to Kingambit due to it being able to survive a boosted Sucker Punch and OHKO back with Fire Blast. Choice Scarf Glimmora can take on Grass- and Fighting-types such as Breloom and Iron Valiant that may threaten Garganacl out. Glimmora also has fantastic coverage, being able to take on Steel-types such as Gholdengo with Earth Power and Water-types such as Gastrodon and Quagsire with Energy Ball. Glimmora can also provide Toxic Spikes support thanks to its ability, Toxic Debris, which can help Garganacl further wear down and pressure the opposing Pokemon. Teammates that utilize Air Balloon such as Iron Thorns and Drednaw can switch into powerful Ground-type attacks aimed at Garganacl. Drednaw can also utilize its Water-type STAB move to take out opposing Ground-types such as Iron Treads, Unaware Clodsire, and Ting-Lu. Furthermore, Drednaw can also turn the tide against rain Water teams thanks to its ability, Swift Swim. Lycanroc-D is also a really good partner for Garganacl that appreciates its ability to wear down foes so it can clean up late-game. Coalossal is also a good partner that can not only burn foes but also lay down entry hazards. Coalossal can also clear its side of the field as well with Rapid Spin, alleviating chip damage on the team. It also acts as a soft check to Scizor and Meowscarada due to its neutralities and can potentially neuter them with Flame Body.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Kilowattrel is an essential component to Flying teams, providing an Electric immunity, pivot support, an excellent Speed tier that allows it to outspeed Choice Specs Greninja and Iron Valiant, and a range of hard-hitting attacks. With rain support, Thunder can be used as Kilowattrel's hard-hitting STAB attack to hit Pokemon—such as Toxapex—that Flying teams can struggle to take down. Thunderbolt is a fine substitute on Flying teams that do not utilize rain. Volt Switch allows Kilowattrel to pivot, making use of Kilowattrel's high Speed tier to get off damage while not being Choice locked. Hurricane couples with the preceding moves to cover Kilowattrel's STAB combination, specifically hitting Ground-types such as Quagsire and Gastrodon. The last slot depends on whether rain is being taken advantage of: on rain teams, Weather Ball can be used to hit Ground-types such as Unaware Clodsire, while Air Slash is another option for non-rain teams that can make up for Hurricane's lower accuracy. Choice Specs allows Kilowattrel to hit extremely hard, letting it OHKO Pokemon such as Azumarill with Volt Switch and Amoonguss with Hurricane. Volt Absorb provides the only Electric immunity for Flying-type teams.</p> <p>Corviknight is one of Kilowattrel's greatest assets; beyond providing a neutral switch-in to Ice-type attacks—especially in the cases of Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Greninja—Corviknight provides a physical wall that Kilowattrel can pivot into. It is also Flying's most common Defogger, which is essential, as Kilowattrel is susceptible to Stealth Rock damage, hindering its pivoting. Pelipper is very useful in supporting Kilowattrel, as rain support ensures accuracy of Kilowattrel's Thunder and Hurricane, and U-turn on Pelipper ensures safe pivoting. Talonflame is another defensive supporter, covering Kilowattrel's weakness to Ice-types and offering another Defogger. Dragonite hits the specially defensive walls that Kilowattrel struggles with such as Clodsire and Blissey. Gyarados finds great support from Kilowattrel; as Kilowattrel punches holes in defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Toxapex, Gyarados will have a better chance to sweep late-game. While Kilowattrel has excellent Speed itself, Choice Scarf users such as Flamigo and Salamence can revenge kill Pokemon such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane that outspeed Kilowattrel. Bombirdier offers Stealth Rock support and uses Knock Off to remove key items such as Leftovers on Gastrodon, which puts it into 2HKO range of Hurricane after Stealth Rock damage.</p>"

Growth is run for Scovillain to boost its damage output while under sun, letting it secure KOs more easily. Giga Drain threatens Pokemon like Ting-Lu, allowing Scovillain's teammates to break through them late-game, and it also aids in improving Scovillain's longevity by recovering its HP. Fire Blast can be used to have a chance of 2HKOing Skeledirge and Clodsire under sun, but Flamethrower is the preferred Fire-type STAB move, since its accuracy is higher than Fire Blast's. Stomping Tantrum hits opposing Fire-types such as Iron Moth. Solar Beam is an alternative to Stomping Tantrum, OHKOing the aforementioned Ting-Lu and Toxapex after Growth in sun. Life Orb and 32 Attack EVs maximize Scovillain's power, letting it 2HKO specially defensive Clodsire with Stomping Tantrum after Stealth Rock damage. If opting for Solar Beam, the remaining EVs go into HP. A Naive nature allows Scovillain to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Great Tusk and Iron Moth under sun while not losing out on Stomping Tantrum damage.</p> <p>Torkoal is a mandatory partner for Scovillain, as its ability to set up sun allows Scovillain to outspeed many faster threats like Iron Treads, Iron Jugulis, and Quaquaval, dealing heavy chip damage or outright KOing them. Scovillain appreciates Torkoal getting rid of entry hazards; in return, Scovillain deals with Water- and Ground-types like Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Sandy Shocks. Paldean Tauros-F is a great offensive partner for Scovillain, granting benefits such as breaking dual screens from Pokemon like Klefki and Grimmsnarl, which impede Scovillain's sweeping ability. Paldean Tauros-F is also able to check specially defensive walls like Blissey; in return, Scovillain breaks past bulky Water-types like Slowking and Toxapex after one Growth under sun. Cinderace can offer alternate entry hazard removal with Court Change, which helps Scovillain's longevity. Furthermore, Cinderace's Speed tier allows it to handle offensive Pokemon that naturally outpace Scovillain outside of sun like Hydreigon and Iron Treads, the former of which Scovillain cannot hit neutrally. Scovillain also appreciates Volcarona as an offensive partner thanks to its non-weather-reliant sweeping potential in Quiver Dance, dealing with Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Garchomp, while Scovillain can weaken Volcarona's checks like Ting-Lu, Unaware Clodsire, and Toxapex throughout the course of the game.</p>"

It's notably also strong enough to score a 2HKO on physically defensive Toxapex after minimal chip damage, allowing Scovillain to beat Poison teams if it hits every move. Alternatively, Overheat has better accuracy and still 2HKOes Skeledirge and Clodsire, but the Special Attack drop makes it less spammable. Giga Drain threatens a 2HKO on Pelipper, which may be tempted to come into Scovillain to block Solar Beam, and also provides Scovillain a form of recovery. A Timid nature lets it outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Gengar and Protosynthesis-boosted Choice Specs Walking Wake to burn them to a crisp, while a Modest nature has better odds of 2HKOing Toxapex with Giga Drain and OHKOing Baxcalibur with Flamethrower at the cost of outspeeding only up to non-Speed boosting Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks.</p> <p>Torkoal is a mandatory teammate, as it sets sun, which Scovillain needs to boost its Speed with Chlorophyll, and provides entry hazard support with its ability to set Stealth Rock and remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Other forms of entry hazard support in Defog Talonflame and Court Change Cinderace are also appreciated; they also have access to U-turn, which allows Scovillain to get in more times to wallbreak. Ceruledge packs Shadow Sneak to deal with Flutter Mane, which otherwise outspeeds and dispatches Scovillain with ease. In return, Scovillain obliterates bulky Unaware walls like Quagsire, Dondozo, and Skeledirge, all of which hinder Swords Dance Ceruledge from cutting down Water and Ghost teams. Similarly, Volcarona and Iron Moth love Scovillain's ability to eliminate bulky walls like Clodsire and Ting-Lu, allowing them to clean up Poison and Ground teams late-game. Skeledirge deals with Kingambit and Choice Scarf Meowscarada, which threaten Scovillain with priority or by outspeeding it and picking it off.</p>"

With enough boosts, Stored Power is powerful enough to break through Unaware walls like Skeledirge, Dondozo and Clodsire. Dazzling Gleam complements Stored Power well, as it can beat Dark-types which would otherwise wall Espathra such as Sableye, Meowscarada, and Greninja. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Espathra ignore entry hazards when switching in and couples well with Roost to increase Espathra's longevity, letting it set up easily. Alternatively, Leftovers in conjunction with Substitute and Roost or Protect lets Espathra safely get Speed boosts while also being able to scout foes' moves. 56 Speed EVs let Espathra outspeed Dragapult and Choice Scarf Gallade and Hoopa-U at +1 Speed, while the rest are placed into HP and Defense, giving Espathra enough bulk to set up with ease against physical attackers such as Garchomp, Great Tusk and Corviknight.</p> <p>Espathra appreciates teammates that can accentuate its offensive prowess. Scream Tail can set dual screens and paralyze opponents with Thunder Wave to make setting up easie while also setting Stealth Rock and can even Wish pass to Espathra. Gallade, along with Scream Tail with the set of Substitute, Bulk Up, Drain Punch and Play Rough can also punish Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Kingambit. Iron Leaves can beat Barraskewda under rain, which otherwise outspeeds Espathra even at +2 Speed. Iron Leaves also beats bulky Ground-types like Ting-Lu, which could phaze Espathra with Whirlwind, or Clodsire and Quagsire, both of which would require a lot of boosts to break with Stored Power. Indeedee is a Ghost-type switch-in and sets up Psychic Terrain for Espathra, protecting it from priority attacks like Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch. Indeedee is also able to Healing Wish to give Espathra a second chance to sweep. Stored Power Armarouge forms a dangerous core with Espathra, which can break for Espathra, clean after it, and also beat Steel teams. Hatterene bounces back entry hazards for Espathra if it forgoes Heavy-Duty Boots while also beating Dark- and Dragon-types. Chilly Reception Slowking can pivot to Espathra safely while acting as a sponge for hits.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Cyclizar is a good choice on Normal teams, as it facilitates sweeping attempts from Ursaluna as well as giving dangerous offensive threats, such as Hisuian Zoroark, a free switch-in opportunity. Shed Tail, when combined with Regenerator, causes Cyclizar to effectively only lose 27% of its HP every time it uses the move. This lets Cyclizar enable its powerful teammates multiple times throughout the game. Rapid Spin allows Cyclizar to act as an entry hazard removal option if it cannot set up Shed Tail. Draco Meteor is run over a secondary utility move to hit Baxcalibur and Hydreigon trying to set up on a predicted Shed Tail, but it can be dropped for another utility move. Additionally, Shed Tail allows Cyclizar to remove Draco Meteor's stat drops. Knock Off is useful for removing defensive items such as Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots, while Taunt stops any setup attempts from Quiver Dance Volcarona as well as preventing more than one layer of hazards from Ting-Lu. Finally, U-turn allows Cyclizar to keep momentum for its team while chipping the opponent and without having to use Shed Tail.</p> <p>Ursaluna is a great teammate for Cyclizar, as it can utilize Shed Tail to start setting up Swords Dance and activate Flame Orb safely. Additionally, Ursaluna's massive physical bulk means that defensive Pokemon such as Clodsire struggle to break Ursaluna's Substitute. Staraptor takes care of Fighting-types such as offensive Great Tusk and Zamazenta for Cyclizar while providing crucial speed control thanks to Choice Scarf. In return, Cyclizar provides an effective source of entry hazard control for Staraptor. Choice Scarf Indeedee also threatens Fighting-types while protecting Cyclizar from priority such as Breloom's Mach Punch thanks to Psychic Surge. Hisuian Zoroark can switch in on Fighting-type attacks thanks to its Ghost typing, allowing it to gain crucial momentum and deal with threats such as Urshifu-R. In exchange, Hisuian Zoroark appreciates a fairly safe switch-in opportunity as well as being able to gain pivotal turns to set up using Nasty Plot with Illusion disguising it. Maushold is another decent teammate for Cyclizar, as it can clean up games with Tidy Up and Population Bomb while appreciating Rocky Helmet being removed from foes thanks to Cyclizar's Knock Off. Tidy Up does remove Cyclizar's Shed Tail, however. Finally, Ditto can punish foes such as Swords Dance Chien-Pao and Quiver Dance Volcarona attempting to set up on a predicted Shed Tail by copying their boosts.</p>"

      "Entry Hazard Support (Poison)": {
        "description": "<p>Glimmora provides useful utility for Poison teams thanks to its status as the only entry hazard remover for Poison teams, ability to put walls such as Amoonguss and Corviknight on a timer with Toxic, and access to Stealth Rock, which completes Poison's entry hazard stacking core. Mortal Spin's poison wears down entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Great Tusk and Hatterene looking to bounce back Stealth Rock over time. Steel-types like Iron Treads, Heatran, and Gholdengo can block Mortal Spin, so Earth Power is great, as it punishes these for switching into it; however, Stealth Rock is usually the better option, as it helps Poison teams wear down opposing teams more quickly. For similar reasons, Toxic is great for putting Steel-types, notably Corviknight, on a timer, and it also eases the Poison matchup, as Glimmora outspeeds and can inflict Toxic on the aforementioned walls before it faints. Power Gem prevents Glimmora from being too passive and lets it threaten non-Glaive Rush Baxcalibur if its Air Balloon is intact and Substitute + Bulk Up Corviknight. Energy Ball lets Glimmora threaten Water-types like Quagsire, which normally threatens it out. Maximum Special Attack and Speed boost Glimmora's offensive presence, allowing it to outspeed and possibly win against Gholdengo one-on-one with Earth Power. Air Balloon further increases Glimmora's utility, as it lets Gholdengo double as a switch-in to Choice-locked threats such as Great Tusk and Iron Jugulis, which tend to lock into a Ground-type move against Poison. Alternatively, Black Sludge along with a more defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 212 Def / 44 Spe and a Bold nature improves Glimmora's longevity, notably allowing it to survive a +2 Crunch from Chien-Pao and outspeed and inflict Toxic on Jolly Kingambit. If this is desired, Spiky Shield is a better option over Stealth Rock to further rack up recovery.</p> <p>As Glimmora's typing is horrible into types such as Water and Ground, Toxapex and Amoonguss are great partners, as both sponge hits from threats such as Barraskewda, Quagsire, and non-Choice Band Great Tusk with ease. Furthermore, these Pokemon allow Glimmora's Toxic to do its job and take out Bulk Up Corviknight, opposing Amoonguss, and Clodsire by completely walling them. Amoonguss in particular is great into Ground-types like Landorus-T, which Glimmora can't do much against. Alolan Muk provides a Psychic-type immunity and is an extremely bulky special wall that helps against Choice Specs Dragapult, Hatterene, and Flutter Mane. It also provides Knock Off support, which leaves walls such as Toxapex to be vulnerable to Glimmora's entry hazards. Clodsire provides Spikes, checks other special attackers such as Quiver Dance Volcarona, Nasty Plot Hydreigon, and Regieleki. Alternatively, Overqwil may also be considered as Glimmora's entry hazard stacking partner, as it can deal with Iron Valiant and Belly Drum Azumarill. Salazzle forms a Corrosion core with Glimmora and can land Toxic on threats such as Heatran, which loathe coming into Glimmora. It also provides Encore to neutralize Swords Dance Kingambit and Bulk Up Landorus-T and has access to Knock Off to further disrupt foes. Sneasler threatens Kingambit and loves Glimmora's ability to wear down walls like Toxapex and Corviknight and lure in Gholdengo and hit it with Toxic or Earth Power, allowing Sneasler to clean up Water and Steel teams late-game. Iron Moth also appreciates Glimmora wearing down teams with its entry hazards and dealing with Skeledirge; it is also the best response Poison teams have against Nasty Plot Gholdengo. Galarian Slowking is also an option, as it makes progress in the Poison matchup with Future Sight and retains the ability to pivot or damage with special attackers like Basculegion-F, Landorus, and Nasty Plot Rotom-W, but it can be quickly taken advantage of by the multitude of Dark- and Ghost-types in the tier.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Rock)": {
        "description": "<p>Glimmora is a decent Choice Scarf user for Rock teams due to its high Special Attack and Speed to take on threats like Ogerpon-W, Hisuian Lilligant, and non-Choice Scarf Urshifu-R. Earth Power threatens Steel- and Poison-types like Gholdengo, non-Air Balloon Heatran, Iron Moth, and Sneasler. Sludge Wave is a strong STAB move that can take on Fairy- and Grass-types such as Hisuian Lilligant, Ogerpon-W, Ogerpon-H, and non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant. Dazzling Gleam takes out Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-types like Sableye, Hydreigon, and Kommo-o. Energy Ball allows Glimmora to deal with Water- and Ground-types like Quagsire and non-Choice Scarf Greninja and Great Tusk. Mortal Spin can be run over Energy Ball to help remove entry hazards and poison foes in the process. Power Gem can be run instead to deal with Baxcalibur, Chien-Pao, Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Kleavor.</p> <p>Tyranitar provides sand and a Psychic immunity while also taking on special attackers for Glimmora such as Spectrier, Espathra, and Hisuian Zoroark. Thanks to the sand Tyranitar provides, Glimmora can survive a Choice Specs Draco Meteor from Dragapult due to the Special Defense boost and 2HKO it with Dazzling Gleam. In return, Glimmora also takes out Hisuian Samurott, Quagsire, and Ogerpon-W for Tyranitar. Ogerpon-C can compensate for Glimmora's Ground weakness, and, after setup, it can eliminate Ursaluna-B, Dragonite, and Landorus. Glimmora aids Ogerpon-C by handling threats such as Kleavor when running Power Gem, Iron Valiant, and Hisuian Lilligant. Glimmora can further aid Ogerpon-C with Mortal Spin by removing entry hazards to help prevent Ogerpon-C's Sturdy from breaking. Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine is a strong wallbreaker that can deal with Corviknight, Clodsire, and Toxapex. Coalossal can serve as entry hazard control to allow Glimmora to drop Mortal Spin; it can additionally support the team with Spikes, facilitating Glimmora's cleaning. Coalossal also deals with Scizor, Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Corviknight. Glimmora returns the favor by threatening Clodsire and Toxapex, which can threaten Coalossal. Lead Kleavor can set up Stealth Rock and potentially break opposing Ceruledge's Focus Sash. In exchange, Glimmora eliminates physical walls like Quagsire and non-Air Balloon Heatran for Kleavor. Iron Defense Garganacl is a stallbreaker that can force progress with Salt Cure in matchups against defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Hisuian Goodra, and Galarian Slowking. Glimmora dispatches Choice Band Mamoswine after Stealth Rock, entry hazard chip and Urshifu-R, which can threaten Garganacl. Alolan Golem can trap and eliminate Steel-types like Scizor and Corviknight. Diancie can set up Stealth Rock while also OHKOing Chien-Pao with Body Press and Kommo-o with Moonblast if Glimmora is not running Dazzling Gleam.</p>"

Dondozo faces competition from Quagsire as the team's Unaware user, as Quagsire has an immunity to Electric-type attacks and can stack entry hazards; however, it drops to Grass-type attacks. Curse allows Dondozo to apply offensive pressure, boosting its attack and allowing it to better hit targets such as Baxcalibur and Kingambit while also allowing it to better tank hits in return. Rest allows Dondozo to shrug off status and gives it longevity, allowing it to constantly absorb powerful attacks for Water teams, such as Great Tusk's Headlong Rush. Sleep Talk enables Dondozo to further take advantage of Rest, allowing it to continue to setup or attack its target while asleep. Dondozo takes advantage of its STAB through the use of Waterfall, doing more damage, but Avalanche allows Dondozo to OHKO Meowscarada, as well as pressure Water-immune Pokemon such as Clodsire and Gastrodon. Its EV spread allows Dondozo to tank attacks from Gholdengo and Flutter Mane, due to its already high physical defense, which may be further boosted by Curse.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja is an insane wallbreaker, with coverage allowing it to take on a variety of Pokemon such as an opposing Dondozo or Ting-Lu with Grass Knot, Garchomp with Ice Beam, Amoonguss and Clodsire with Extrasensory, and Espathra with Dark Pulse. Toxapex absorbs Toxic Spikes for Dondozo, spreads Toxic, and shrugs off Grass-type attacks such as Flower Trick from Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Grass Knot from Greninja. Gastrodon provides an Electric immunity and it can tank attacks from special attackers such as Flutter Mane; however, it needs to be wary of Energy Ball. Gastrodon can also stack Spikes or set Stealth Rock, wearing down foes for Dondozo. The defensive core of Dondozo, Toxapex, and Gastrodon also gives Water teams opportunities to scout powerful attacks by allowing for each to switch-in for another, such as Dondozo switching in for Gastrodon or Toxapex to tank Chien-Pao's Crunch. Earthquake also allows it to take on Poison- and Electric-type Pokemon such as Clodsire and Sandy Shocks. Quaquaval can remove hazards with Rapid Spin for Dondozo and offensive Quaquaval sets can take on common threats to Water teams such as Greninja after one Aqua Step or Meowscarada after two.</p>"

Poison Jab hits threats like Meowscarada, Rotom-C, and Iron Valiant, while Gunk Shot provides more power against bulkier foes such as Hatterene and Azumarill. Toxic Spike eases the Dark and Fairy matchups due to their lack of entry hazard removal and applies pressure on teams in general, completing Ground's entry hazard stacking core. Toxic may be used instead to punish Pokemon like Rotom-W and Hydreigon, which freely switch-in to Clodsire otherwise. The given EV spread avoids the 2HKO from both Choice Scarf Greninja's Ice Beam and Choice Scarf Meowscarada's Flower Trick.</p> <p>Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Ting-Lu appreciate Clodsire checking the aforementioned Water-types as well as other threats such as Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane.

Iron Treads clears entry hazards and threatens Hatterene, and Ting-Lu sets up entry hazards and switches into Psychic-type attacks from Espathra and Indeedee. Unaware Clodsire synergizes very well with Gastrodon, as it checks the aforementioned Grass-types, while Gastrodon switches into Water-type attacks from Dondozo and Barraskewda. Sandy Shocks threatens Flying-types like Corviknight and Pelipper and secures the Fire matchup. Quagsire pairs well with Water Absorb Clodsire, as it checks Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Great Tusk.

Spikes lets Clodsire take advantage of forced switches and synergizes well with Glimmora, Toxapex, and Skuntank, all together forming Poison's entry hazard-stacking core.

Skuntank is a Psychic-immune teammate that switches into Hatterene, Espathra, and Indeedee, and it can set Toxic Spikes better against types like Fairy and Psychic by trapping switch-ins such as Klefki and Bronzong with Fire Spin. Glimmora provides entry hazard support and removal with Stealth Rock and Mortal Spin, respectively, and it can run Air Balloon or Choice Scarf to handle Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads due to its great coverage. Glimmora can also run Corrosion with Toxic and Mortal Spin, improving the Poison matchup and putting defensive Pokemon such as opposing Clodsire and Amoongus on a timer.

Making up for its lack of Speed, Sucker Punch fits perfectly on Kingambit. In tandem with three boosts from Supreme Overlord, Sucker Punch OHKOes Flutter Mane; it also OHKOes Volcarona after Swords Dance in tandem with two Supreme Overlord boosts. Kowtow Cleave is a reliable heavy-hitting STAB attack, and Iron Head hits Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Azumarill. Supreme Overlord is one of Kingambit's main selling points, allowing it to 2HKO Specially Defensive Corviknight and almost always 2HKO Quagsire after Stealth Rock. The Speed EVs allow Kingambit to outspeed both Corviknight and Skeledirge, both which otherwise can threaten Kingambit with Body Press and Will-O-Wisp, respectively.

Chien-Pao and Meowscarada help make up for some of Kingambit's type weaknesses. Chien-Pao can hit Ground-types such as Garchomp and Great Tusk.

Kowtow Cleave allows it to break through walls that don't resist it such as Skeledirge, which poses a major complication for Steel teams, as well as 2HKOing Quagsire if all teammates have fainted. Sucker Punch can allow Kingambit to defeat threats like Barraskewda and Flutter Mane, which can massively threaten Steel teams. Iron Head damages Pokemon that don't mind Sucker Punch or Kowtow Cleave, such as Ting-Lu or Azumarill. Alternatively, Brick Break destroys dual screens and OHKOes other Kingambit trying to take its STAB moves. 140 Speed EVs allow Kingambit to outspeed walls such as uninvested Skeledirge and Corviknight. Black Glasses boosts its Dark-type moves to dangerous levels without it having to set up Swords Dance, but Leftovers may be used to increase Kingambit's survivability. Chople Berry has a niche in allowing Kingambit to survive Fighting-type moves such as Chien-Pao's Sacred Sword, while Heavy Duty Boots helps it pivot in and out to exert pressure on the opponent without getting chipped.</p> <p>Scizor's U-turn safely pivots Kingambit in to wallbreak while dealing substantial chip damage; also, its Bullet Punch deals with threats to Kingambit such as Chien-Pao and Iron Valiant, and Close Combat allows it to check threats such as Iron Treads and Ting-Lu. Gholdengo is an excellent partner to freely switch into Fighting-type moves and Will-O-Wisp. Corviknight serves as a potent check to Chien-Pao and clears entry hazards to increase Kingambit's longevity, Magnezone breaks through bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Dondozo, and it preserves momentum through Volt Switch. Iron Treads serves as another hazard clearer, can set up Stealth Rock to chip any walls Kingambit wants to break through, and can serve as speed control with a Choice Scarf. Klefki sets up dual screens, which allow Kingambit to use Swords Dance far more easily. Tinkaton can wall any Fairy-type moves meant to chip or finish off Kingambit, such as Flutter Mane's Moonblast, and KO many of their users with Gigaton Hammer. Orthworm's Shed Tail can be used with Kingambit to great effect, allowing it to freely use Swords Dance and threaten to sweep the opponent's team.</p>"

Earthquake is a powerful STAB move that threatens Poison-types such as Clodsire and Toxapex. Knock Off complements Great Tusk's ability to spin by strongly hitting Ghost-types such as Brambleghast, Gholdengo, and Dragapult hard while also removing Heavy-Duty Boots. Lastly, Great Tusk provides Stealth Rock support for the team, which helps to break Focus Sash on Breloom. Heavy-Duty Boots is the premier choice, as it allows Great Tusk to spin away hazards without being poisoned by Toxic Spikes or worn down by Spikes. Leftovers is a solid alternative to provide Great Tusk with passive recovery, but generally avoiding hazard damage is more important. The EV spread outpaces neutral nature Tyranitar and uninvested Brambleghast while maximizing Great Tusk's physical bulk.</p> <p>Assault Vest Iron Hands is a great partner to Great Tusk, sponging special hits aimed at it while also threatening Pokemon such as Choice Specs Pelipper and Hatterene. Iron Hands also appreciates Great Tusk's ability to keep entry hazards off the field so it doesn't get worn down. Wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant and Breloom appreciate Great Tusk's ability to threaten Poison-types such as Clodsire and Skuntank, allowing them to continue rampaging against the opponent. Due to it being an amazing special attacker, Iron Valiant in particular can threaten physical walls like Quagsire, Sableye, and Dondozo, which like to switch into Great Tusk. Choice Scarf users such as Flamigo, Quaquaval, and Slither Wing pressure special attackers faster than Great Tusk such as Choice Specs Greninja, Dragapult, and opposing Iron Valiant. Gallade is also a really nice partner to handle Pokemon such as Amoonguss, who would otherwise beat Great Tusk one-on-one, thanks to its Psychic STAB attacks.</p>"

In return, Clodsire and Gastrodon switch into Water-type attacks from Quaquaval and Pelipper and set entry hazards to enhance Great Tusk's wallbreaking. Furthermore, Clodsire cripples Quagsire and Rotom-W with Toxic and Gastrodon prevents setup with Clear Smog.

Mystical Fire hits Steel-types such as Klefki and Iron Treads. Psyshock allows Flutter Mane to punish specially defensive switch-ins like Dragalge, Blissey, and Clodsire. Flutter Mane can run Power Gem to pressure Fire teams, OHKOing foes like Volcarona and Torkoal, and it also benefits from Protosynthesis allowing it to outspeed Scovillain under the sun. Additionally, Flutter Mane usually goes with either Thunderbolt or Energy Ball. Both are useful against Water teams, with the former helping against Toxapex and Pelipper while the latter deals with Gastrodon and Quagsire. Choice Specs further enhances Flutter Mane's wallbreaking power, allowing it to overwhelm foes such as Ting-Lu after some chip damage.</p> <p>On Fairy teams, Flutter Mane is a menacing wallbreaker that excels at taking down slower foes such as Hydreigon, Skeledirge, and Corviknight. When paired with Iron Valiant, Flutter Mane forms an offensive core that's able to alternate between Fairy-, Ghost-, and Fighting-type STAB to take down a wide range of enemies. Flutter Mane can handle Psychic-type foes such as Espathra and Hatterene, while Iron Valiant takes care of Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. Flutter Mane can fall back on either Hatterene or Tinkaton when faced with an unfavorable matchup. Both of these Pokemon provide dependable defensive options and some type of entry hazard control, but Hatterene is particularly useful due to it breaking down walls like Dondozo and Clodsire. Flutter Mane also pairs well with setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Mimikyu, as it is able to poke holes in the opponent's team, allowing them to clean late-game. In return, Azumarill can take care of priority users, such as Ceruledge and Chien-Pao. In terms of support options, Flutter Mane can rely on Fairy's Prankster users, Klefki and Grimmsnarl, to set up dual screens, therefore allowing it to withstand hits such as Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Gholdengo's Make It Rain. Grimmsnarl can then bring in Flutter Mane relatively safely thanks to Parting Shot. Klefki's Spikes and Tinkaton's Stealth Rocks also support Flutter Mane in breaking its checks such as Iron Hands and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard stacking proves particularly useful against less bulky teams, as it highly limits their capacity to scout Flutter Mane without having to sacrifice a member in the process.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Ghost)": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Flutter Mane is an incredibly potent revenge killer and late-game cleaner thanks to its strong STAB combination, solid coverage options, and blazing Speed tier. Notably, it outspeeds faster Pokemon like Dragapult, boosted threats such as Baxcalibur and Quaquaval, and Choice Scarf users like Greninja and Meowscarada, all of which can threaten the offensive teams that Flutter Mane is part of. Mystical Fire threatens Steel-types such as Corviknight and Iron Treads, while Psyshock revenge kills Choice Scarf Iron Moth and hits specially bulky Pokemon like Clodsire. Thunderbolt pressures Corviknight better and 2HKOes physically defensive Toxapex after Stealth Rock, while Energy Ball takes care of Gastrodon.</p> <p>Spikes from the likes of Brambleghast and Froslass are terrific support options, chipping down bulky foes like Toxapex and Ting-Lu that would otherwise switch into Flutter Mane freely. Thanks to Good as Gold blocking Defog and its Ghost-typing, Gholdengo is a notable partner to keep Spikes up. Brambleghast also helps threaten Gastrodon and provides Rapid Spin support as well. Wallbreakers like Mimikyu and Gholdengo can pressure the opposition early-game, allowing for Flutter Mane to clean up late-game with ease; moreover, Mimikyu can overwhelm Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads with Drain Punch, while Gholdengo can make use of Trick to cripple walls like Clodsire and Corviknight. Setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Swords Dance Ceruledge are valuable teammates that function as back-up late-game cleaners, especially against types Flutter Mane can struggle with such as Poison and Steel. Moreover, Ceruledge and Mimikyu have the added benefit of safely revenge killing opposing fast threats Flutter Mane can't handle easily, like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane and Dragon Dance Dragapult, with Shadow Sneak. Skeledirge is a notable partner to compensate for Flutter Mane's lack of physical bulk, taking on Bullet Punch users like Scizor and Lucario as well as being fantastic in the Steel, Fighting, and Bug matchups.</p>"

      "Bulky Choice Specs (Fairy)": {
        "description": "<p>Bulky Choice Specs Flutter Mane serves as a strong specially offensive wallbreaker that can survive one hit from most unboosted physical attacks, such as Ting Lu's Heavy Slam and Baxcalibur's Icicle Crash, with relative safety. Psyshock allows Flutter Mane to break through most Poison cores on its own with proper hazard support, most notably 2HKOing Clodsire, which otherwise walls it. Alternatively, Mystical Fire lets Flutter Mane break through defensive Steel-types like Iron Treads and and surprise more offensive Steel-types like Scizor behind Reflect, while Energy Ball targets would-be Rock-, Water-, and Ground-type walls like Garganacl and Gastrodon. The given EVs let Flutter Mane outspeed Spectrier, always survive +1 Dragonite's Earthquake, and almost always win the one-on-one matchup against Ting-Lu by having a 15/16 chance to survive its Heavy Slam and a 78% chance to 2HKO it with Moonblast in return after Leftovers recovery, using the minimum HP and Defense EVs possible.</p> <p>Bulky Choice Specs Flutter Mane takes advantage of its unexpected bulk to create surprise KOs, such as versus Dragon Dance Dragonite, while retaining its ability to remove key threats like Skeledirge, Corviknight, and Galarian Slowking. For this reason, setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Calm Mind Hatterene are strong partners, as they can take advantage of the holes that Flutter Mane creates in defensive cores. Iron Valiant is another strong partner, as it can take advantage of both the specially defensive Pokemon that Flutter Mane may not be able to remove, such as Hisuian Goodra, Alolan Muk, and Heatran, while creating a generally strong offensive core. As Flutter Mane is slower than Chien-Pao and opposing Flutter Mane, Choice Scarf Pokemon such as the Enamorus and the aforementioned Iron Valiant are necessary to handle these threats. Choice Scarf Enamorus in particular is a strong partner, as it can reduce the necessity of Flutter Mane on the field while threatening its own powerful late-game cleanup with Contrary Superpower, supporting its team with Healing Wish, and using Iron Head to KO opposing Flutter Mane after hazard chip; it also has the added benefit of having a stronger matchup versus Choice Scarf Meowscarada than Iron Valiant. On the other hand, Choice Scarf Iron Valiant is more immediately threatening with a Choice Scarf, allowing it to outspeed Choice Scarf Iron Moth and Gengar, Chlorophyll Scovillain, and Slush Rush Cetitan, and OHKO threats that Enamorus could only dream of removing, such as Ice Shard Chien-Pao. Flutter Mane also struggles versus Steel-types like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Choice Scarf Iron Treads, so support from Klefki and Tinkaton, along with offensive checks like Azumarill, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus, allows Flutter Mane to break through these cores much more reliably. The Poison-type matchup is particularly difficult, so Steel-types like Klefki and Tinkaton and Magic Bounce support from Hatterene help Flutter Mane, as they can provide hazard support while blocking or punishing Toxic Spikes. In return, Flutter Mane can pressure Clodsire and Galarian Slowking and chip Alolan Muk by capitalizing on the lack of switch-ins to the combination of Psyshock, Moonblast, Shadow Ball, and entry hazards.</p>"

Moonblast threatens Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Darkrai, and Walking Wake. Energy Ball hits Ground- and Water-type foes such as Mamoswine, Dondozo, Gastrodon, and Quagsire. Thunderbolt nails Water-types like Pelipper, Toxapex, and Empoleon, allowing Flutter Mane to threaten every Water-type Pokemon super effectively in tandem with Energy Ball. Furthermore, Thunderbolt wards off Flying-types such as Corviknight and Moltres. The given EV spread permits Flutter Mane to take a Shadow Sneak from Life Orb Mimikyu, easing the Ghost matchup.</p> <p>Gholdengo is an excellent teammate, as it takes advantage of Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon like Sneasler, Empoleon, and Amoonguss for Nasty Plot setup, while in return Flutter Mane threatens Ground-types such as Sandy Shocks and Gastrodon. Focus Sash Ceruledge is a really good wallbreaker against Steel and Dark teams, easily taking out Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and Kingambit. Colbur Berry Spectrier excels in the Poison and Fighting matchups, weakening shared checks like Assault Vest Iron Hands and specially defensive Toxapex using Will-O-Wisp as well as takes out potential revenge killers like Choice Scarf Roaring Moon with Draining Kiss. Additionally, Choice Scarf Spectrier is great in the Ghost mirror matchup, threatening Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Flutter Mane, appreciating Flutter Mane removing Dark-types like Hydreigon and Darkrai in return. Brambleghast and Froslass provide Spikes setup to push Flutter Mane's targets into OHKO ranges, while the former also applies additional pressure on Water and Ground teams. Skeledirge wears down teams by spreading Will-O-Wisp and bypassing Substitute with Torch Song, walling and shutting down setup Pokemon such as Zamazenta and Iron Hands. Hisuian Zoroark provides a Ghost-type immunity, switching into attacks from opposing Ceruledge and Flutter Mane as well as providing utility via Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off, weakening physical attackers that Flutter Mane is vulnerable to such as Clodsire, Corviknight, and Poison Jab Toxapex and rendering foes susceptible to Spikes. Dragapult provides utility via Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp, hindering threats like Chien-Pao and opposing Flutter Mane. Furthermore, Choice Scarf Dragapult removes other Choice Scarf users like Meowscarada and Roaring Moon.</p>"

      "Gravity (Ground)": {
        "description": "<p>Sandy Shocks is an incredibly useful part of any Ground team thanks to its combination of being able to threaten common types that Ground struggles against such as Flying and Water and good team support in Gravity, making its teammates' and its Ground STAB attacks more threatening without any Ground-immune Pokemon. Its Speed tier is also good enough to outspeed Urshifu-R, a big threat to Ground-type teams, while allowing Ground teams to muscle past Moltres Flying teams, which can outlast Ground teams. Gravity not only allows it to hit Flying types such as Thundurus-T and Zapdos that don't care about its Electric STAB moves, but it also lets its teammates such as Landorus, Ursaluna, and Choice Scarf Great Tusk spam their Ground-type attacks without worrying about Ground-immune Pokemon. While Gravity is certainly useful, it comes with the drawback that opposing Ground-type moves from Pokemon such as Landorus-T or Iron Treads cannot be avoided. Earth Power is its Ground STAB attack, which also benefits from the Gravity that Sandy Shocks sets up and hits Electric-immune Pokemon such as Clodsire and Quagsire hard. This, along with Thunderbolt, allows Sandy Shocks to threaten the whole of Water teams. Finally, Volt Switch lets Sandy Shocks pivot out into a teammate that can either take an attack for it or deal big damage. Heavy-Duty Boots is Sandy Shocks's item of choice, allowing it to switch in multiple times to set Gravity and pivot out with Volt Switch without worrying about residual hazard damage. An alternative EV spread of 48 HP / 208 SpA / 252 Spe can be used for a Speed-boosting Protosynthesis, but this spread worsens the chance of a 2HKO on Quagsire.</p> <p>Landorus is a great teammate for Sandy Shocks, as Landorus's already-scary STAB- and Sheer Force-boosted Earth Power gets even scarier when almost nothing is immune to it. Additionally, Landorus can take Ground-type attacks aimed at Sandy Shocks by virtue of its Flying typing while hitting Grass- and Fairy-types hard with Sheer Force-boosted Sludge Bomb. In return, Sandy Shocks can pivot Landorus in using Volt Switch, as well as offensively threatening Water-types that threaten Landorus such as Urshifu-R. Ursaluna is another good teammate, as it is simply terrifying when Flying-types cannot safely switch into its Earthquake alongside being able to smash Grass-types with Fire Punch and crush Ghost-types with the sheer power of its Guts-boosted Earthquakes and its ability to deal with Spectrier thanks to Guts. Additionally, Ursaluna's bulk lets it take a hit when it switches in through Sandy Shocks' Volt Switch. Great Tusk provides Rapid Spin support on Bulk Up sets and speed control by virtue of its Choice Scarf set alongside Ice Spinner to help Sandy Shocks deal with opposing Landorus and Grass-types such as Hisuian Lilligant. Additionally, Great Tusk's power under Gravity cannot be understated, as its Ground STAB moves deal serious damage and can easily break through opposing teams. Clodsire can take Grass- and Fighting-type attacks such as Choice Scarf Meowscarada's Flower Trick and Zamazenta’s Close Combat with ease alongside forming a chip damage core with Sandy Shocks through Volt Switch and Toxic damage. Additionally, Clodsire's Water immunity lets it soak up attacks such as Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes and Basculegion-F's Water STAB move of choice, and it is generally a rather good special wall. Quagsire is a good defensive partner for Sandy Shocks, as it can wall Chien-Pao and Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and threaten them back with Body Press, as well as being able to set hazards. Iron Treads functions as a check to Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Flutter Mane who can take Sandy Shocks' attacks and threaten it back while also having Ice-type coverage to hit Flying- and Grass-types. Alongside those attributes, Iron Treads also has Knock Off, allowing it to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from common users such as Quagsire and Amoonguss, letting Sandy Shocks gradually wear them down over the course of the game. Finally, Ting-Lu's sheer bulk allows it to take strong hits such as Dragonite's boosted Extreme Speed that Sandy Shocks can't while setting up hazards to chip away at common answers to Sandy Shocks such as opposing Ting-Lu.</p>"

Knock Off dissuades Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Skeledirge from spinblocking and potentially weakens Choice item users such as Meowscarada and Greninja after taking their hit, letting its teammates such as Choice Scarf Great Tusk and Clodsire handle them better. Heavy Slam smashes Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Flutter Mane, while Iron Head better deals with Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur.

Ting-Lu wears down the opposing team with entry hazards + Whirlwind deals with Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur in a pinch, and runs Throat Chop and Taunt to stop setup threats such as Corviknight and Skeledirge that pose a threat to Ground teams. Water Absorb Clodsire and Gastrodon deals with Water-types such as Dondozo, Quaquaval, and Barraskewda as well as walling Meowscarada and Ice Beam Greninja, respectively, as long as Iron Treads keeps the field free of entry hazards. Alternatively, Clodsire can use Unaware instead to check most special attackers, including Volcarona, Rotom-C, and Gholdengo. Similarly, Unaware Quagsire checks physical setup sweepers such as Belly Drum Azumarill, Dragon Dance Dragapult, and Swords Dance Chien-Pao and Mimikyu, and it further wears down the opposing team with Toxic and entry hazards.</p>"

Heavy Slam utilizes Iron Treads's fairly hefty size to hit Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Mimikyu hard; however, Iron Head can be used as a more consistent STAB to nail heavier targets such as Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Garganacl. Ice Spinner provides great coverage alongside Iron Treads's STAB moves, nailing Grass-types such as Meowscarada before Protean activates and Amoonguss while also nailing Garchomp and Dragonite. Knock Off provides good team support by getting rid of the foe's item, such as Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from the likes of Dragonite, Volcarona, and Garchomp, whereas Volt Switch allows Iron Treads to pivot out of Pokemon that wall it such as Corviknight and Dondozo.</p> <p>Corviknight is a fantastic partner for Iron Treads, as it can take Fighting- and Ground-type moves while Iron Treads takes on Electric-types such as Iron Hands and Magnezone for Corviknight. Corviknight can also keep entry hazards off the field with Defog, aiding in Iron Treads's longevity and letting it forgo Rapid Spin. Gholdengo is another great partner, as it not only also helps against Fighting-types that Corviknight can't handle such as Iron Valiant, but it also overwhelms physical walls such as Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Dondozo. Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Tinkaton, Orthworm, and Bronzong also aid in Iron Treads sweeping. Tinkaton specifically ensures Stealth Rock being set due to Mold Breaker while having a decent offensive presence thanks to Gigaton Hammer being so powerful. Orthworm provides a Ground immunity, easing pressure off other teammates such as Corviknight, all while also having Spikes and Stealth Rock. Bronzong can not only set up Stealth Rock, but it can also take on Fire-type moves that are aimed at Iron Treads. Kingambit is a great mid- to late-game sweeper that appreciates Iron Treads's ability to punch holes early-game or clean up after Kingambit has punched holes itself, providing the team with multiple avenues of winning.</p>"

Drain Punch grants Iron Hands some form of recovery and still hits hard, notably OHKOing Hisuian Goodra and 2HKOing Ting-Lu after a Swords Dance. Thunder Punch OHKOes Articuno and Corviknight after one Swords Dance. Ice Punch allows Iron Hands to threaten several Flying-types its STAB moves aren't very effective against, like both Landorus formes and Dragonite. Earthquake is an alternative option that allows Iron Hands to threaten several Steel- and Fire-types, OHKOing Gholdengo and 2HKOing Torkoal after one Swords Dance boost. With a Shuca Berry, Iron Hands can take STAB Ground-type attacks that could easily revenge kill it, such as Landorus's Earth Power and Choice Scarf Iron Treads's Earthquake. Using a Lum Berry allows Iron Hands to immediately cure status &amp; especially burn, which would otherwise weaken Iron Hands's wallbreaking capabilities. This also allows it to bypass Moltres's Flame Body and punish Sableye for attempting to burn it. 116 Defense EVs in tandem with Lum Berry allow Iron Hands to take a +2 Earthquake from Dragonite and Choice Band Iron Treads's Earthquake, as well as taking a little over 50% damage from Choice Scarf Meowscarada's Play Rough.

It is bulky enough to respond to the strongest special attackers in the tier, such as Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, Greninja, and Iron Moth. Drain Punch provides much needed recovery while using Assault Vest while Thunder Punch is used instead of Wild Charge to avoid chip damage. Heavy Slam hits Fairy-types like Hatterene and allows it to revenge kill Flutter Mane. Despite these strengths, Iron Hands is unable to freely switch in on Flutter Mane and Greninja, as they often run Choice Specs and heavily damage Iron Hands or 2HKO it altogether. Volt Switch allows Iron Hands to keep momentum when it forces switches, allowing it to pivot on physically bulky switch-ins like Skeledirge and Amoonguss. Earthquake is a strong coverage option that hits Poison-types like Clodsire and Iron Moth. Rock Slide is an alternative option to hit Kilowattrel and deal with Volcarona without risking a burn from Flame Body.</p> <p>Great Tusk appreciates Iron Hands's ability to tank neutral special hits like Water-type attacks from Greninja and Pelipper and force them out. In return, Great Tusk takes Ground-type attacks from opposing Great Tusk and Ting-Lu. Furthermore, Great Tusk removes Ting-Lu's Spikes and Clodsire's Toxic Spikes, which cut into Iron Hands's longevity. Breloom and Gallade assist Iron Hands with the Ground and Psychic matchups, respectively, threatening foes like Quagsire and Gastrodon for the former, and Amoonguss and Clodsire for the latter. Breloom appreciates Iron Hands switching into Fire-type attacks from Volcarona and forcing Flying-types like Iron Jugulis to switch. Iron Valiant appreciates Iron Hands's slow Volt Switch, allowing Iron Valiant to switch in freely against opposing Fighting teams. Iron Valiant also threatens common physically defensive Pokemon like Dondozo, Skeledirge, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. Choice Scarf users such as Quaquaval and Paldean Tauros-F check threats to Iron Hands like Choice Specs Greninja and Flutter Mane, while Iron Hands handles defensive checks such as Calm Mind Hatterene with Heavy Slam in return.</p>"

If you're willing to drop Substitute, U-turn allows Iron Moth to escape from threats such as Tyranitar, Ting-Lu, and Heatran while dealing chip and popping Heatran's Air Balloon. Overheat can OHKO defensive Gholdengo and specially defensive Iron Treads while Taking out powerful threats such as Baxcalibur, Mamoswine, and Landorus after they have received minor chip damage.

Its STAB Flamethrower melts through Steel-types such as Corviknight, Scizor, and Gholdengo that its teammates are unable to handle. Discharge eviscerates Flying- and Water-types like Pelipper, Talonflame, and Toxapex. Dazzling Gleam fells the mighty Dark- and Dragon-types of the tier such as Hydreigon, Sableye, and Dragapult. For its last moveslot, Energy Ball is a nice option in the Ground matchup, being able to threaten Quagsire, Great Tusk, and Sandy Shocks along with hitting Rotom-W in the Water- and Electric-type matchups, while U-turn allows Iron Moth to safely pivot out of unfavorable matchups against Tyranitar and Dragonite and pairs nicely with Poison's Regenerator Pokemon. Fiery Dance can be an alternative to Flamethrower, with its Special Attack boosting capabilities pairing nicely with Choice Scarf to make Iron Moth unstoppable.</p> <p>Iron Moth greatly appreciates bulky teammates like Amoonguss and Skuntank providing safe switches against threats that are either bulky enough to survive Iron Moth's attacks, like Garchomp, Dondozo, and specially bulky Iron Treads, or threaten to outspeed and KO it, like Chien-Pao and Meowscarada. Physically bulky Amoonguss is Iron Moth's best friend, being able to take on nearly every physical attacker and Ground-type like Garchomp, Dondozo, Meowscarada, and Iron Hands thanks to its Ground neutrality, reliable recovery, and Spore. Physically bulky Toxapex handles most other physical threats Amoonguss is unable to, such as Chien-Pao and Ceruledge, while setting up Toxic Spikes. Specially bulky Skuntank provides a safe answer to bulky Psychic-types like Hatterene and Slowbro as well as Ghost-types like Flutter Mane and Gengar thanks to its high special bulk, good typing, and useful STAB moves. Specially defensive Clodsire provides entry hazard support with Stealth Rock, along with checking threats like Volcarona, Kilowattrel, and Blissey. Corrosion Glimmora can also provide hazard support and use Toxic to wear down opposing special walls like Clodsire, Iron Treads, Ting-Lu, and Iron Hands. Dry Skin Toxicroak deals with Barraskewda and Floatzel, which outspeed Iron Moth, along with switching into Aqua Jets from Belly Drum Azumarill thanks to its immunity to Water-type moves. It also checks many of the Dark-types Iron Moth can't handle, such as Ting-Lu, Tyranitar, and Kingambit, thanks to its Fighting-type STAB move of choice.</p>"

Its wide array of coverage options, good STAB combination, and very high Special Attack make it a difficult Pokemon to answer. Dazzling Gleam allows Iron Moth to hit Dragon-types such as Dragapult and Hydreigon, while Discharge and Energy Ball both provide coverage against Water-types; Discharge covers targets neutral to Energy Ball such as Toxapex and Pelipper, while Energy Ball is stronger and also hits Water/Ground types such as Gastrodon and Quagsire. U-turn forgoes a coverage move in order to allow Iron Moth to maintain momentum even when it cannot break through a team. Fiery Dance can be run instead of Flamethrower, forgoing a bit of power and burn chance in exchange for the potential to snowball into a sweep.</p> <p>Iron Moth pairs well with wallbreakers that can open holes for it such as Scovillain and Hisuian Arcanine. The former aids with bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Gastrodon that may give Iron Moth trouble depending on its coverage, while the latter appreciates Iron Moth's speed control and potential pivoting capabilities to destroy problematic Fire-types and special walls, including Skeledirge and Hisuian Goodra. Torkoal provides Stealth Rock, status, and Rapid Spin support as well as powering up Iron Moth's Flamethrower with the sun. Paldean Tauros-F can threaten Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Heatran that wall Iron Moth, while Iron Moth can discourage faster Pokemon such as Greninja and Iron Treads from switching in—neither of which Paldean Tauros-F wants to take on. Volcarona can aid Iron Moth in wearing down a team, as both Pokemon can make progress to help the other break through; additionally, Volcarona can heavily damage Psychic- and Dark- types such as Espathra and Ting-Lu that can give Iron Moth trouble. Finally, Iron Moth's bad bulk makes pivoting support from Cinderace, Talonflame, and Moltres appreciated to help it get in easier; Cinderace can also provide hazard control with Court Change, while Talonflame can achieve the same with Defog.</p>"

It can easily set up a Substitute on foes such as Articuno, Moltres, and Amoonguss or predicted Sucker Punches from the likes of Kingambit to begin causing havoc while being safe from strong attacks. Fiery Dance pairs nicely with Substitute to give Iron Moth plenty of chances to boost up its Special Attack. However, Flamethrower is more consistent, being able to reliably OHKO Alolan Ninetales and fast Kingambit. Either Fire-type STAB melts Steel- and Ice-type threats like Corviknight, Scizor and Frosmoth. Discharge shocks Water-type switch-ins like Toxapex, Empoleon, and Azumarill, along with scaring Flying-types like Moltres and Enamorus out. Energy Ball gives Iron Moth the ability to threaten all Water-types with the exception of Ogerpon-W by hitting Quagsire and Rotom-W, along with blasting through Ground- and Rock-types like Ursaluna-B, Mamoswine, and Garganacl.</p> <p>Galarian Weezing's immunity to Ground-type attacks and high physical bulk make it an invaluable partner for Iron Moth, enabling it to safely come in against monsters like Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Mamoswine and threaten them out with the fear of Will-O-Wisp burns, (AC) and in return Iron Moth threatens Steel-types like Corviknight and Gholdengo. Physically defensive Amoonguss's Grass typing lets it take on many of the Water- and Ground-type threats Iron Moth is typically scared of like Urshifu-R, Quaquaval, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads with its STAB attacks. Spore also creates opportunities for Iron Moth to safely switch in and set up Substitute. Physically defensive Toxapex handles faster threats and Fire-types like Chien-Pao, Kleavor, Hisuian Arcanine, and Ceruledge with its STAB Surf and Haze. Alolan Muk's incredible special bulk and ability to handle threatening Ghost-, Dark- and Psychic-type threats like Flutter Mane, Spectrier, Greninja, Darkrai, and Espathra is invaluable. Overqwil can deal with Psychic-types like Galarian Slowking, Hatterene, and Espathra while setting Spikes, which Iron Moth can use to add to its offensive pressure and Fiery Dance sweeping potential. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking serves as another incredible special wall, (AC) being able to threaten out foes such as Kommo-o, Volcarona, and opposing Iron Moth. Galarian Slowking can further use STAB Future Sight to set traps to catch opposing switch-ins to Iron Moth such as Iron Hands and Clodsire. Water Absorb Clodsire handles Fire-types that would switch into Iron Moth's STAB moves like Ninetales and Volcanion with STAB Earthquake. It can also use Unaware to check Volcarona and set up Stealth Rock to pressure Fire-types. Glimmora can also set Stealth Rock and threaten out Fire-types like Talonflame and Skeledirge with its STAB Power Gem and Heatran with Earth Power, and using Corrosion, it can ruin special walls like Alolan Muk, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire with Toxic. Sneasler's higher base Speed and STAB moves can allow it to blast through threats like Choice Specs Iron Valiant, Heatran, the Ogerpon formes, and Kingambit. Alternatively, Sneasler can use a Choice Scarf to outspeed and remove Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur even after it gets a Speed boost while using Switcheroo to mess up walls like Clodsire. Okidogi can remove threats like Kingambit, Heatran and Ogerpon-C while softening up other threats such as Toxapex and Clodsire with Knock Off.</p>"

Ice Shard allows Baxcalibur to use an Adamant nature to revenge kill weakened targets such as Choice Scarf Great Tusk, Dragapult, and Flutter Mane. Alternatively, Glaive Rush may be used instead to deal more damage to Chien-Pao and opposing Baxcalibur. Icicle Spear in conjunction with Loaded Dice is a potent combination, dealing enough damage to break past Quagsire and Corviknight with an Adamant nature.

Furthermore, Cyclizar removes entry hazards such as Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Dragapult is capable of outpacing threats like Choice Specs Flutter Mane and opposing Baxcalibur as well as pressuring Dondozo with Thunderbolt. Garchomp eases Baxcalibur's sweeping by setting entry hazards and phazing opposing Pokemon through Dragon Tail to rack up damage. Dragalge sets up Toxic Spikes and checks Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant thanks to its Fairy-type neutrality along with STAB Gunk Shot. Hydreigon threatens physical walls like Slowbro, Dondozo, and Toxapex by disabling their recovery options with Taunt and setting up on them using Nasty Plot.

Thermal Exchange lets it switch into and punish Will-O-Wisp users such as Rotom-W and Sableye and Fire-type moves from Ceruledge and Fire Spin Skuntank. Glaive Rush hits Rotom-W, Toxapex, Volcarona and Quaquaval, while Ice-type STAB moves let it threaten Meowscarada, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. Earthquake is a great option to hit Steel-types such as Gholdengo and Kingambit super effectively, while Ice Shard lets it pick off weakened Pokemon and Choice Scarf users such as Meowscarada, Flamigo, and Dragapult. An Adamant nature maximizes Baxcalibur's power while outspeeding Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao at +1; however, a Jolly nature outspeeds Gholdengo and Quaquaval and Speed ties Choice Scarf Great Tusk at +1.</p> <p>Baxcalibur appreciates teammates that can provide it with setup opportunities. Froslass can set Spikes and stop opposing hazards with Taunt, spread burns, and use Destiny Bond to KO opposing threats to Baxcalibur. Abomasnow provides Baxcalibur with snow's defense boost and Aurora Veil to help it set up while also checking Dondozo and Quagsire. Swords Dance Chien-Pao can break Skeledirge, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit and can pick off Pokemon that Baxcalibur has weakened with Ice Shard or Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Chien-Pao can effectively clean up the battle once Baxcalibur has dealt significant damage. Avalugg and Cloyster can both remove hazards for Baxcalibur in case its Heavy-Duty Boots have been removed. Cloyster can also clean up after Baxcalibur with Shell Smash, while Avalugg can beat Kingambit, Iron Treads, and more with Iron Defense + Body Press if Baxcalibur forgoes Earthquake.

At +2, Icicle Crash OHKOes specially defensive Ting-Lu and 2HKOes Corviknight, preventing these walls from phazing or heavily damaging Baxcalibur. Alternatively, Icicle Spear in combination with Loaded Dice enables Baxcalibur to outright OHKO Corviknight and physically defensive Great Tusk at +2. It can also break through Quagsire if it manages to land five hits. However, Dragon teams do not have consistent entry hazard removal, making Loaded Dice a bit unreliable. If Icicle Crash is used, Glaive Rush becomes much more important, since it has a chance to 2HKO Quagsire if using an Adamant nature. This move also enables Baxcalibur to indiscriminately break down bulkier teams like Poison and Water. Ice Shard allows Baxcalibur to clean up types such as Dragon, Ground, and Flying after dealing with bulky Pokemon like Walking Wake, Great Tusk, and Corviknight. A Jolly nature allows Baxcalibur to outpace threats like Glimmora and Gholdengo. This makes Earthquake a better choice, since it OHKOes both at +2 while retaining its ability to threaten Poison and Steel teams. However, this comes at the cost of being unable to break Quagsire.</p> <p>Cyclizar is one of the best teammates for Baxcalibur due to its ability to remove entry hazards, remove items from bulky walls like Quagsire and Toxapex, and pass a Substitute to Baxcalibur with Shed Tail. Garchomp provides entry hazard support and can shuffle opposing teams with Dragon Tail. It also pressures Steel-types like Gholdengo immensely, which is appreciated especially if Baxcalibur lacks Earthquake. Choice Specs Dragapult deals with Flutter Mane, Quagsire, and Gholdengo, pivots Baxcalibur into special walls like Clodsire and Alolan Muk, and spreads status on unsuspecting threats like Kingambit, Quagsire, and Corviknight, making them easier to deal with. Hisuian Goodra checks Fairy-types like Hatterene, Choice Specs Iron Valiant, and Flutter Mane. In return, Baxcalibur deals with Enamorus, Breloom, and Landorus, which all pose a threat to Hisuian Goodra. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Nasty Plot Hydreigon, and Iron Defense Hisuian Goodra work in tandem with Baxcalibur, as they wear down each other's checks to eventually win the Water, Fighting, Steel, and Fairy matchups. Hisuian Goodra and Dragonite also appreciates Baxcalibur's ability to swap into predicted Will-O-Wisps from Sableye. Choice Scarf users like Walking Wake and Roaring Moon are also appreciated, as Walking Wake deals with fast threats like Choice Scarf Great Tusk and Chien-Pao, while Roaring Moon takes care of Iron Valiant and Dragapult.</p>"

A spread of 252 HP / 108 Def / 84 SpD / 64 Spe with either of the prescribed natures lets Gholdengo survive a hit from non-Choice Band Chien-Pao and Expert Belt Flutter Mane and OHKO back while still being able to outspeed Jolly Azumarill. Hex in conjunction with Thunder Wave is decent in supporting team mates, notably outright OHKOing Gliscor at +2 if running a Modest nature. However, Steel-type coverage is usually more useful, and Ghost has no shortage of Pokemon that inflict status. Focus Blast is also notable, as Gholdengo is not OHKOed by fully Supreme Overlord-boosted Sucker Punch from Kingambit and OHKOes it back with that move.

        "description": "<p>Boasting an impressive Special Attack stat, Gholdengo provides Steel teams with a fantastic special attacker, which are scarce on said type. Nasty Plot lets Gholdengo overwhelm walls such as Gastrodon and Amoonguss. Shadow Ball is a fantastic STAB move that has great neutral coverage and allows Gholdengo to threaten Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Gallade. Focus Blast hits Dark-types that resist Shadow Ball like Kingambit and Ting-Lu. A single Nasty Plot boost enables Gholdengo's Focus Blast to OHKO physically defensive Ting-Lu after a layer of Spikes. The last slot is extremely flexible; Make It Rain is a powerful STAB move that hits harder than Shadow Ball against Dark-types like Grimmsnarl and Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Azumarill. Substitute can be used instead to give Gholdengo some security against faster threats that can take it out such as Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, and Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Recover is also another option to keep Gholdengo healthy, since it can be worn down fairly easily. Good as Gold allows Gholdengo to switch into status-using Pokemon like Sableye and Grimmsnarl, allowing Gholdengo to set up on them. Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to switch into Pokemon like Great Tusk and Clodsire with ease as well as avoid Spikes as long as it stays intact. This allows Gholdengo to be a decent spinblocker as well.</p> <p>Kingambit is a fantastic partner, as it not only resists Dark-type moves directed at Gholdengo, but it also has STAB priority in Sucker Punch to threaten opposing Ghost-types that can take out Gholdengo such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane. Kingambit also appreciates Gholdengo's ability to take on Breloom so as to not be revenge killed. Scizor appreciates Gholdengo's ability to take care of physical walls, allowing it to clean up with STAB Bullet Punch. Scizor can also pivot into Gholdengo on physical walls such as Skeledirge, allowing Gholdengo to threaten the opposing Pokemon easier. Nasty Plot Lucario is another fantastic partner thanks to its ability to get rid of Dark-types for Gholdengo and pressure special walls. Choice Scarf Iron Treads also appreciates Gholdengo's ability to break physical walls such as opposing Corviknight and Great Tusk early-game so that it can sweep late-game. Dual screens support from Klefki allows Gholdengo to have an easier time setting up and potentially sweeping. Another good partner for Gholdengo is Corviknight, as it removes entry hazards while also providing a Ground immunity once Air Balloon is gone. Corviknight can also run a Bulk Up or Iron Defense set that appreciates Pokemon like Skeledirge being taken care of while helping Gholdengo have an easier time breaking stall. Orthworm is another good choice, as it provides Shed Tail support as well as having access to Spikes and Stealth Rock. Bronzong is also an amazing partner as well, as it can not only set up Stealth Rock, but it can also tank Fire-type moves thanks to Heatproof.</p>"

Make It Rain's extra power makes it a notable option over Flash Cannon, as it OHKOes Ursaluna-B and Articuno at +2 and will always OHKO Flutter Mane and Baxcalibur.

Alternatively, Flash Cannon provides a less strong but more reliable STAB move that is extremely helpful in the Fairy and Ice matchup. 104 Speed EVs let Gholdengo outspeed threats like Adamant Scizor and Jolly Azumarill and most walls, including uninvested Gliscor and Articuno. A Bold nature prevents Alolan Muk from 2HKOing Gholdengo before the Air Balloon breaks, while a Modest nature provides Gholdengo with more favorable damage calculations, namely giving it a chance to OHKO Gliscor and Galarian Moltres with +2 Make It Rain and Scizor with a boosted Shadow Ball and knocking out Alolan Muk over two turns with Make It Rain after a Nasty Plot. An Air Balloon lets Gholdengo provide a unique defensive niche, walling out a lot of Ground-types like Gliscor variants with no attacking moves besides Earthquake, Landorus, and Quagsire as long as it isn't popped, protecting Gholdengo from Poltergeist users such as Brambleghast once the item is popped, and also making it a generally safe switch-in to block Mortal Spin from Earth Power Glimmora.</p> <p>Flutter Mane and Nasty Plot Spectrier appreciate Gholdengo's wallbreaking ability to remove roadblocks like Gliscor, Clodsire, and Articuno. In return, Gholdengo is able to take a hit from non-Choice-Band Chien-Pao and OHKO it back for its teammates. In return, Flutter Mane and Spectrier both act as cleaners and deal with faster-paced matchups like Fighting and Ghost for Gholdengo. Both are also able to remove Dark-types like Greninja, while Spectrier can lure and incapacitate Dark-types like Roaring Moon if using a Colbur Berry. Flutter Mane can also don a Choice Scarf, to deal with Dragapult and Chien-Pao. Gholdengo's vulnerability to Water- and Fire-type coverage is notable, so teammates like Sinistcha to readily deal with Dondozo and Skeledirge to take on Gastrodon and Volcarona benefit Gholdengo. Skeledirge, especially with Earth Power, puts in work in the Steel and Fire matchup, while Sinistcha helps in the Ground matchup, which Gholdengo does not fare well against. Both also have the ability to inflict burn on key walls like Alolan Muk, Clodsire, and Iron Hands, making it easier for Gholdengo to set up. Ceruledge is an exceptional teammate, as it deals with Gholdengo's nemesis, Heatran, and also put in work on matchups like Steel and Fire. Spikes support from Froslass and Brambleghast is also great, as this synergizes with Gholdengo's ability to block Defog; Froslass also is fast enough to deal with Landorus, while Brambleghast's entry hazard removal is rare on Ghost and is appreciated once Gholdengo's Air Balloon gets popped. Dragapult's great Speed tier enables it to fend off Choice Specs Flutter Mane or Choice Scarf Roaring Moon when equipped with a Choice Specs or Choice Scarf of its own, and it can pivot Gholdengo in against walls like Clodsire with U-turn, as well as burn Alolan Muk, Iron Hands, and Ting-Lu for it. Dragapult can also run a Choice Band set, allowing it to 2HKO Alolan Muk as well as take out opposing Ghost-types with Sucker Punch, or even a Dragon Dance set to threaten walls such as Clodsire that bother Gholdengo. Choice Scarf Hisuian Zoroark takes advantage of Gholdengo's Speed tier and typing with Illusion, luring and removing threats like Hisuian Samurott while also being able to eliminate Hoopa-U with U-turn. It is also able to lure in and heavily damage Ghost-types like Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Spectrier, which use their Ghost-type coverage to defeat Gholdengo. Mimikyu can serve as a check to threats like Hoopa-U and Hydreigon as well as a one-time answer to Darkrai, Greninja, and Chien-Pao using Disguise. In return Gholdengo takes on Corviknight, Iron Defense Iron Treads, and Galarian Weezing.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Ghost)": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Gholdengo's ability to revenge kill threats such as Flutter Mane, Chien-Pao lacking Sucker Punch, and Dragapult, come into status-spreading Pokemon such as Klefki and Breloom due to Good as Gold, and inconvenience bulkier teams by preventing all forms of entry hazard removal with its ability and typing make it a prime pick for Ghost teams. Make it Rain greatly weakens Dark- and Normal-types such as Hydreigon and Indeedee, and it OHKOes Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Chien-Pao. Shadow Ball lets Gholdengo clean types such as Psychic and Ghost late-game. Trick neutralizes defensive pivots such as Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, which typically switch into it. The last move of choice is dependent on what the Ghost team lacks; Focus Blast gives the team another way to defeat Choice Specs Greninja, Thunderbolt cleans Water- and Flying-teams, or Nasty Plot which turns Gholdengo into a massive threat against bulkier teams especially after their main specially defensive wall has been given a Choice Scarf with Trick.</p> <p>As Gholdengo provides the needed revenge killing capabilities on Ghost teams, teammates such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult are free to run sets like Choice Specs and Dragon Dance, respectively. Both also break down walls such as Clodsire and Gastrodon; in return, Gholdengo deals with Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Gallade. Skeledirge walls most physical attackers and Fire-types such as Scovillain and Volcarona. Mimikyu provides a safety net against offensive types like rain Water and Ghost, checking Barraskewda and Choice Scarf Flutter Mane for the team, and it loves Gholdengo shutting down defensive walls such as Toxapex with Trick. Entry hazard setters in Brambleghast and Froslass are is also greatly appreciated, as they can set, remove, or prevent entry hazards for Gholdengo; in return, Gholdengo prevents their entry hazards from getting removed by Glimmora. Brambleghast also switches into Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk and deals with Water-types like Gastrodon and Dondozo, while Froslass can spread paralysis with Thunder Wave and bring down an opposing Pokemon with its Destiny Bond.</p>"

Sword of Ruin lets it beat physical walls like Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Toxapex, though it doesn't have great bulk, has to watch out for super effective priority moves from Scizor, Lokix, and Slither Wing, and struggles to break past walls like Dondozo and Quagsire. With Swords Dance, it can boost up to beat even the likes of Corviknight and Toxapex if it has Crunch. Fighting-type coverage picks off Dark-types like Kingambit and Greninja. Sacred Sword picks off weakened Garganacl, while Brick Break destroys opposing Dark or Fairy team's dual screens. Ice Shard stops common revenge killers like Choice Scarf Meowscarada, Flutter Mane, and Great Tusk.</p> <p>As Chien-Pao focuses on breaking down foes with its sheer power and Speed, it appreciates support from its teammates. Ting-Lu can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes, while Skuntank can set up Toxic Spikes and pressure Fairy-types, all of which make wallbreaking for Chien-Pao easier. Grimmsnarl provides Chien-Pao with dual screens support, making setting up easier. Sableye can burn opposing Pokemon and cripple them with Taunt and Knock Off, removing Heavy-Duty Boots and making foes susceptible to entry hazards, while also acting as a Fighting-type move switch-in. Choice Specs Greninja can clean up after Chien-Pao has done enough damage while also countering Fire-types that would annoy Chien-Pao such as Skeledirge and Cinderace if Chien-Pao does not have Crunch. Hydreigon can break Steel-types for Chien-Pao if it forgoes Fighting-type coverage or Swords Dance, beating Fighting-neutral Steel-types like Corviknight and Scizor. Choice Scarf Meowscarada is able to threaten Pokemon that counter Chien-Pao such as Quaquaval and Choice Scarf users such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Great Tusk while also being able to pivot to Chien-Pao with U-turn.</p>"

      "Swords Dance Sweeper (Ice)": {
        "description": "<p>Chien-Pao's high Speed, solid Attack, and good offensive typing allow it to be a very potent setup sweeper. Icicle Crash is preferred over Ice Spinner for its flinch chance and higher Base Power, the latter of which—among other things—allows it to always 2HKO Sableye and bulky Great Tusk, while Ice Spinner may miss out on these 2HKOs. Crunch allows Chien-Pao to hit Skeledirge and Gholdengo—two problematic Pokemon for Ice teams. Sacred Sword and Brick Break both allow Chien-Pao to threaten Dark-, Steel-, and Ice-types such as Kingambit and opposing Chien-Pao. Sacred Sword is stronger and comes with the ability to ignore Defense boosts, while Brick Break removes Reflect and Light Screen, which is extremely helpful against teams with support from Grimmsnarl or Klefki. Psychic Fangs is an alternative option to Sacred Sword or Brick Break to hit Toxapex and Fighting-types such as Paldean Tauros-F. Sucker Punch is significantly stronger than Ice Shard and allows Chien-Pao to hit Pokemon like Gholdengo, Scizor, and Flutter Mane.</p> <p>This set very much appreciates Aurora Veil support from Abomasnow, as it allows Chien-Pao to set up on many Pokemon that would otherwise threaten it out as well as allowing it to survive revenge killing attempts from the likes of Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Extreme Speed Dragonite. Spikes support from Froslass is also greatly appreciated, as they wear down Pokemon that may otherwise be difficult for Chien-Pao to break, such as Dondozo and Klefki. Although Chien-Pao is able to fit on practically any team, it pairs especially well with other powerful sweepers such as Baxcalibur and Cloyster, weakening or even KOing their checks such as Air Balloon Gholdengo and Skeledirge. Baxcalibur in particular can take on Pokemon such as Toxapex and Paldean Tauros-F with a powerful Earthquake, allowing Chien-Pao to KO them and sweep the opposing team; furthermore, Choice Band Baxcalibur pressures Chien-Pao answers such as Quagsire and Corviknight. Baxcalibur's Thermal Exchange also allows it to switch into Will-O-Wisp that would cripple Chien-Pao as well as be an emergency switch-in to a Fire-type attack. Shell Smash Cloyster appreciates the removal of Skeledirge and Froslass.</p>"

      "Choice Band Wallbreaker (Ice)": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Chien-Pao is a potent mid-game threat, powerful wallbreaker, and good late-game cleaner. Additionally, it is capable of breaking through physically defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight and Quagsire, both of which tend to be tough matchups for many other Ice staples. Icicle Crash is preferred over Ice Spinner for its flinch chance and slightly higher Base Power, notably being favored to 2HKO Azumarill and OHKO offensive Pelipper, neither of which are feats Ice Spinner is capable of. Sacred Sword and Brick Break provide crucial coverage for Pokemon such as Kingambit and opposing Chien-Pao, and Sucker Punch allows Chien-Pao to KO faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo.</p> <p>This set heavily appreciates Spikes from Froslass to wear down its switch-ins, sometimes allowing it to grab KOs it would otherwise miss out on; for example, Crunch always 2HKOes physically defensive Toxapex with one layer of Spikes, but it is favored to not 2HKO without any Spikes. Rapid Spin support from Avalugg is also appreciated, allowing Chien-Pao more opportunities to enter the field. Since this set focuses on opening holes in teams, setup sweepers are excellent partners for it, as Chien-Pao can dent or remove their checks to allow the sweep to happen much more easily. Shell Smash Cloyster in particular appreciates Chien-Pao's ability to beat Gholdengo and significantly damage other Pokemon such as Corviknight that Cloyster may otherwise struggle to break through. Dragon Dance Baxcalibur appreciates Chien-Pao's ability to 2HKO Quagsire and physically defensive Corviknight, which normally would stop Baxcalibur in its tracks. Finally, Belly Drum Cetitan appreciates Chien-Pao's ability to break Unaware walls such as Skeledirge and Quagsire; in return, Cetitan acts as speed control if snow is in effect, aiding in Chien-Pao's weakness to Choice Scarf users such as Iron Moth.</p>"

Heavy Slam hits Fairy-types that would otherwise overpower Ting-Lu, such as Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, while also threatening Hatterene trying to bounce back hazards. Stealth Rock and Spikes allow Ting-Lu to support wallbreakers such as Meowscarada or Greninja. Whirlwind allows Ting-Lu to phase out setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Curse Dondozo and rack up entry hazard damage, while Ruination provides consistent damage against other walls such as Amoonguss and Corviknight that don't mind any of Ting-Lu's other moves.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Meowscarada, Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Greninja all appreciate Ting-Lu's ability to set entry hazards, as they wear down common defensive answers such as Toxapex, Iron Treads, and Dondozo. In return, they can scare out threats to Ting-Lu; Meowscarada can deal with Greninja, Chien-Pao and Greninja can threaten Great Tusk, and Kingambit can force out Fairy-types such as Hatterene. Skuntank is a good partner as well, since it offers a crucial neutrality to Fairy, threatens Fairy-types, and sets and clears Toxic Spikes, augmenting Ting-Lu's entry hazards and improving its longevity. Additionally, Skuntank can utilize Fire Spin to further chip down teams and trap Klefki, improving Ting-Lu's matchup against Fairy. In return, Ting-Lu can assist in Ground matchups through its bulk. Sableye is also a great partner due to its Fighting immunity, taking attacks Ting-Lu can't such as Great Tusk's and Iron Hands's Close Combat.</p>"

      "Physically Defensive (Ground)": {
        "description": "<p>Ting-Lu's exceptional bulk and utility options make it an invaluable asset to Ground teams, walling threats like Dragapult, Espathra, and Hydreigon. Earthquake threatens Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Volcarona. Alternatively, Throat Chop hits Espathra for more damage and shuts down Air Balloon Gholdengo. Ruination allows Ting-Lu to quickly wear down the likes of opposing Ting-Lu, Hatterene, and Dragonite, while Body Press may be used to deal more damage to Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Hydreigon. Spikes or Stealth Rock in conjunction with Whirlwind sets Ting-Lu apart from other entry hazard setters; it's capable of wearing down the opponent's defensive core and weakens threats such as Greninja, Meowscarada, and Baxcalibur. Additionally, Whirlwind phazes threatening sweepers like Scizor and Ceruledge.</p> <p>Ting-Lu's entry hazards are heavily appreciated by Great Tusk, which threatens out Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Gallade, and Greninja; Sandy Shocks, which deals with Water-types like Pelipper, Quaquaval, and Dondozo; and Garchomp, which threatens Corviknight, Rotom-C, and Breloom with its Fire-type coverage. Furthermore, Choice Scarf Great Tusk removes Heavy-Duty Boots from Sableye and Brambleghast via Knock Off to enhance Ting-Lu's phazing, which enables Clodsire and Gastrodon as entry hazard setters to wither down threats such as Greninja and Ceruledge more efficiently. Water Absorb Clodsire adds a Water immunity, can switch into attacks from Greninja, Quaquaval, and Meowscarada, and helps wear down the opposing team with Toxic Spikes or Toxic. Gastrodon walls Water-type Pokemon like Pelipper, Dondozo, and Rotom-W and assists with spreading entry hazards. Iron Treads eases Ting-Lu's pivoting by removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin and checks Fairy-types like Flutter Mane and Hatterene. Quagsire stalls out physical setup sweepers such as Mimikyu, Chien-Pao, and Iron Hands and also helps wear down defensive cores using Toxic.</p>"

Thunderbolt hits Water- and Flying-types such as Dondozo and Corviknight. Psyshock hits Poison-types such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Clodsire, whereas Future Sight can apply pressure to opponents like Toxapex for teammates such as Breloom and Gallade.

One of Iron Valiant's best qualities for Fairy teams is its access to Fighting-type STAB moves to counter Steel-types.

Energy Ball is a good alternative to more easily beat specially defensive Gastrodon and Rotom-W, but Grass Knot is an option to beat Dondozo after Spikes. Psyshock is a good tool versus Poison-types like Clodsire, Iron Moth and Amoonguss, while Shadow Ball lets it hit Skeledirge and Gholdengo that otherwise wall Iron Valiant. Trick is another great option to hinder defensive switch-ins like Toxapex, Corviknight, and Clodsire if Iron Valiant forgoes the moves to deal with them. Choice Scarf makes Iron Valiant an excellent revenge killer, being able to outrun threats such as Dragapult, Chien-Pao, and slower Choice Scarf users like Iron Moth and Gholdengo.</p> <p>Iron Valiant has amazing coverage, which makes it an effective cleaner; however, it cannot run all of them at once. Hence, it appreciates teammates that can cover what it cannot, and it also appreciates teammates that help it switch in, as it is quite frail.

Klefki is also a good switch-in against opposing Fairy-types like Mimikyu. Flutter Mane and Mimikyu can weaken teams to let Iron Valiant clean up or they can clean up after it. They also deal with Ghost-types such as Gholdengo, Flutter Mane, and Skeledirge if it forgoes Shadow Ball. Azumarill checks Fire-types such as Paldean Tauros-F, Volcarona, and Iron Moth and Ground-types such as Iron Treads and Clodsire.

Hydro Pump offers a powerful Water-type STAB attack to hit Steel- and Fairy-types like Gholdengo, Clefable, Kingambit, and Heatran as well as OHKOes Volcarona after a Quiver Dance. Scald offers a reliable Water-type STAB attack due to its accuracy and ability to potentially burn switch-ins such as Alolan Muk, Assault Vest Iron Hands, and Snorlax, while Flip Turn provides Walking Wake with a pivoting move, reducing the need to predict and also maintaining momentum in a match. Alternatively, Hydro Steam not only is reliable accuracy-wise but also aids against sun Fire teams, tearing through every Pokemon barring Volcanion in conjunction with Protosynthesis. Flamethrower may be used instead to threaten the aforementioned Steel-types as well as Ice- and Grass-types such as Alolan Ninetales, Frosmoth, and Amoonguss The given EV spread ensures that Protosynthesis always give a Speed boost under sun, allowing Walking Wake to outpace threats like Ogerpon-H and Choice Scarf Ninetales.</p> <p>Empoleon offers a resistance to Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks, walling opposing Walking Wake, Flutter Mane, Hydreigon, and Alolan Ninetales. Furthermore, Empoleon has a notable Freeze-Dry neutrality and provides Stealth Rock and Knock Off support to wear down walls like Alolan Muk and Assault Vest Iron Hands. In return, Walking Wake threatens Pokemon like Baxcalibur, Great Tusk, and Zapdos and forms a pivoting core via Flip Turn. Toxapex is heavily valued for its Fairy-type resistance, switching into threats such as Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus, as well as adds on to Walking Wake's offensive pressure via Toxic Spikes. Urshifu-R and Ogerpon-W break special walls like Empoleon, Gastrodon, and Clodsire. In return, Walking Wake threatens Poison-type walls such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Galarian Weezing. Pelipper provides rain support to enhance Walking Wake's wallbreaking capabilities, notably allowing Walking Wake to 2HKO Assault Vest Iron Hands with Hydro Pump, as well as Knock Off to remove vital items like Iron Hands and Galarian Slowking's Assault Vests and U-turn to form a pivoting core and bring in Walking Wake safely. Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott removes faster Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Dragapult, Greninja, and Flutter Mane using its Fighting- and Dark-type coverage while providing Spikes support with Ceaseless Edge. Additionally, Hisuian Samurott offers vital pivoting with Flip Turn, preserving momentum and wearing down switch-ins while also luring in entry hazard removers like Corviknight and Great Tusk for Walking Wake. Quaquaval offers entry hazard removal via Rapid Spin to allow Walking Wake to pivot more freely, as well as Knock Off support and pivoting using U-turn and Flip Turn. Choice Scarf Greninja is a great speed control option and a great check to enemies like Iron Valiant and Dragapult. Gastrodon can wall Choice Specs Dragapult and Flutter Mane lacking Energy Ball and provides entry hazards to aid in Walking Wake's wallbreaking. Manaphy can heavily wear down Steel and Poison teams and wears down shared checks like Alolan Muk and Water Absorb Clodsire.

Flamethrower roasts Steel-types like Scizor and Gholdengo, though it lacks the firepower to 2HKO specially defensive Corviknight. Hydro Steam, emboldened by sun, lets Walking Wake demolish Fire teams. Alternatively, Dragon Pulse provides a weaker but more consistent STAB attack, which is great against opposing Dragon teams.

This also synergizes well with Garchomp, which sets entry hazards in Spikes and Stealth Rock, phazes the opposition with Dragon Tail or Roar, and pressures Poison- and Steel-types like Clodsire and Klefki. Cyclizar gets rid of entry hazards for Walking Wake, allowing it to come onto the field more.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Water</h1> <p>Dragon Pulse is a nice option to consistently wear down Regenerator cores when combating Poison teams, not leaving Special Attack drops like Draco Meteor.</p> </section>"

An ultra bulky set with 248 HP / 244 SpD / 16 Spe can be used to maximize Okidogi's bulk, allowing it to survive threatening attacks like Gholdengo's Psychic, +2 Hydreigon's Earth Power, Choice Specs Walking Wake's Draco Meteor, and Tornadus-T's Hurricane while still getting the jump on threats like Adamant Azumarill, Adamant Kingambit, and Mandibuzz.</p> </section>",

      "Bulk Up (Poison)": {
        "description": "<p>Okidogi has cemented itself as an incredible setup sweeper for Poison teams with its diverse movepool and solid natural bulk, allowing it to safely set up and blow through any Steel- or Dark-type that stands in its way. Toxic Chain and Guard Dog are both helpful in allowing Okidogi to break through teams. Toxic Chain puts more pressure on bulky walls like Sableye, Avalugg, Quagsire, and Skeledirge, which forces them to either switch out or repeatedly use recovery moves. Guard Dog, on the other hand, punishes Intimidate from the likes of Landorus-T, Gyarados, and Paldean Tauros-F and stops phazing from threats such as Ting-Lu and Empoleon. Drain Punch is a useful STAB move that keeps Okidogi healthy and deals solid damage against threats like Kingambit, Garganacl, and Heatran. Knock Off is used to punish Ghost-types like Gholdengo, Ceruledge, and Dragapult that effortlessly wall Okidogi otherwise. It also annoys switch-ins like Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, and Quagsire by removing their Black Sludge. For the final moveslot there are three main options. Taunt prevents Haze from Toxapex and Articuno, Substitute is useful to set up in the face of Pokemon like Amoonguss and Galarian Weezing, and Ice Punch blows through Flying- and Ground-types like Dragonite, Clodsire, and Gliscor. 96 Speed EVs allow Okidogi to outspeed threats like Adamant Torterra, Jolly Kingambit, and Jolly Azumarill, with the rest of the EVs maximizing Okidogi's specially defensive bulk, allowing it to comfortably survive offensive Heatran or Glimmora's Earth Power.</p> <p>Okidogi's crippling weakness to any Psychic-type attack makes Alolan Muk an essential teammate, being able to handle threats like Espathra, Iron Valiant, Hisuian Zoroark, and Hatterene with its STAB moves. Overqwil, while not as specially bulky, still provides a Psychic immunity while providing support in stacking entry hazards to ease Okidogi's sweep. Galarian Weezing similarly fills an important role with its immunity to Ground-type attacks from threats like Great Tusk, Mamoswine, and Clodsire. Once switched in, it can burn physical threats along with removing hazards, allowing Okidogi to have a much easier time switching in and setting up late-game. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking can soak up special attacks from foes such as Greninja and Walking Wake, remove Landorus with Ice beam, and provides a Psychic neutrality and the ability to create Future Sight traps for Okidogi to exploit. Amoonguss provides assistance in scaring off Ground- and Water-types like Great Tusk, Quagsire, and Urshifu-R with its Grass-type STAB attacks and provides Spore support to give Okidogi a safe opportunity to switch in and begin setting up. Toxapex's solid physical bulk in conjunction with Haze and a Rocky Helmet provides utility in wearing threats down like Zamazenta, Mimikyu, and Ceruledge. Salazzle, thank to its high Speed and ability to wear down physical walls like Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, and Corviknight with Corrosion-enabled Toxic and ability to impede setup sweepers, such as Baxcalibur, Manaphy, and Ogerpon formes, with Encore excels at removing threats Okidogi doesn't like. Glimmora provides similar Corrosion utility, along with the ability to set up hazards and threaten dangerous Flying-types like Dragonite, Moltres, and Zapdos with STAB Power Gem. It can also remove hazards with Mortal Spin to give Okidogi safe entry. Choice Specs Iron Moth's Overheat is great at removing dangerous threats such as Gliscor and Landorus instantly, along with using Discharge to remove Flying- and Water-types like Moltres, Enamorus, and Toxapex. Gengar has valuable utility in its ability to remove pesky Ghost-types like Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and Brambleghast along with being able to Trick its Choice Specs onto walls like Clodsire, making them far easier to break through. Choice Scarf Sneasler makes a solid friend for Okidogi, being able to handle faster threats like Baxcalibur and Chien-Pao, along with using Switcheroo against their shared checks like Skeledirge and Quagsire.</p>"

Aside from this, Taunt gives Ogerpon-W a hand in its matchup against Toxapex, and it can set up freely in front of Ting-Lu and Empoleon without fearing phazing.

Apart from this, its part Grass typing grants it a neutrality to Electric and Grass, which helps in matchups against foes such as Assault Vest Iron Hands and Thundurus-T. Aside from this, its ability makes it great in the Water mirror matchup, since it is able to switch safely into Manaphy without fearing burn from Scald. Its Water-type Ivy Cudgel is able to 2HKO Corviknight after a Swords Dance. Horn Leech allows Ogerpon-W access to some form of longevity, with the potential to recover a good amount of HP after a Swords Dance. It notably 2HKOes Rotom-W without a Swords Dance boost and 2HKOes Toxapex after one, which most Water-types struggle against; however, it has to be wary of the former carrying Will-O-Wisp. Play Rough grants Ogerpon-W coverage against the Dragon-types that resist both its STAB moves, such as Baxcalibur and Kommo-o, while Trailblaze allows it to outpace the likes of Chien-Pao and unboosted Iron Valiant after it is used once. Knock Off grants Ogerpon-W some degree of utility, being able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Dragonite and Amoonguss to make them more vulnerable to entry hazards; it also hits Sinistcha and Brambleghast, which resist both of Ogerpon-W's STAB moves.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott and Empoleon make for good partners for Ogerpon-W, as the two of them are able to stack hazards to make Ogerpon-W's wallbreaking easier. Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott is also able to outspeed and remove faster threats to Ogerpon-W like Chien-Pao and Dragapult, while Empoleon can bring it in safely with Flip Turn, wall Alolan Ninetales, and provide a neutrality to Freeze-Dry. In return, Hisuian Samurott appreciates Ogerpon-W breaking through Corviknight, while Empoleon benefits from the removal of Great Tusk. Pelipper makes for another great teammate for Ogerpon-W, setting up rain to strengthen Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel. Aside from rain, Pelipper can pivot into Ogerpon-W via U-turn and threaten Hisuian Lilligant and Amoonguss with Hurricane. Entry hazards from the likes of Gastrodon, Toxapex, and Quagsire can wear down incoming foes for Ogerpon-W to take advantage of. Quagsire can also remove setup sweepers that can outspeed and threaten Ogerpon-W out like Dragonite and Baxcalibur thanks to a combination of Unaware and Toxic, while Toxapex is able to serve as a wall against the likes of Chien-Pao and Meowscarada. As Ogerpon-W struggles with certain bulky Pokemon, such as Galarian Weezing and Zamazenta, it appreciates teammates that can either remove them or wear them down for Ogerpon-W to finish off, such as boosted Manaphy for the former and Basculegion-F under rain for the latter. Urshifu-R pairs well with Ogerpon-W, as it can break bulky Steel-types such as Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon. Lastly, Toxapex and Amoonguss can stop any Ogerpon-W wallbreaking attempts; hence, Choice Specs users such as Walking Wake and Greninja make for great partners.</p>"

With Hearthflame Mask, Ogerpon-H's Ivy Cudgel becomes a Fire-type move capable of 2HKOing Baxcalibur and Clodsire without a Swords Dance boost while also breaking through sturdy walls such as Hisuian Goodra, Ting-Lu, and Galarian Weezing after a Swords Dance boost. With Horn Leech, Ogerpon-H has access to some form of recovery especially against the Ground-types that most Fire-types tend to struggle against such as Ursaluna-B and Gastrodon. Play Rough allows Ogerpon-H to threaten the Dragon-types that take little from its STAB moves, OHKOing Kommo-o without a Swords Dance boost and OHKOing tanky Garchomp after a Swords Dance boost. On the other hand, Trailblaze allows Ogerpon-H to outspeed Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane after it is used once.</p> <p>Ninetales and Torkoal are key teammates for Ogerpon-H, as they set up sun to boost Ogerpon-H's damage from Ivy Cudgel to devastating levels. Notably, it is able to 2HKO Gliscor under sun without a Swords Dance boost. Torkoal is also able to set up Stealth Rock to weaken foes, putting them in OHKO range from Ogerpon-H's attacks. Ogerpon-H appreciates forms of entry hazard removal such as Cinderace's Court Change, Torkoal's Rapid Spin, and Talonflame's Defog. Court Change is notable, since it can possibly gain dual screens placed by foes such as Klefki and Alolan Ninetales, although it is best used when any hazards are not on the opponent's side of the field. Ogerpon-H struggles with certain walls such as Toxapex, so it appreciates Heatran being able to trap and eliminate it with Earth Power. In return, Ogerpon-H is able to threaten Ground-types Heatran struggles with such as Ting-Lu.

Horn Leech grants Ogerpon-H some form of longevity. Play Rough allows Ogerpon-H to threaten the likes of Kommo-o, and after a Swords Dance Boost, it can 2HKO Dragonite.

Toedscruel can also take Fire-type attacks from Iron Moth and KO it back, while Brambleghast can switch into a predicted Flying-type move as well as revenge kill Flutter Mane with Shadow Sneak. Amoonguss is another great teammate, as its bulk and access to Spore allow it to either incapacitate or force out foes such as Dragonite. Choice Scarf Meowscarada outspeeds and removes potential threats to Ogerpon-H like Spectrier and faster Dragon-types, and it can bring Ogerpon-H in safely.

Tyranitar sets up sand to allow Ogerpon-C to set up easier due to the Special Defense boost, allowing Ogerpon-C to survive a Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Walking Wake.

Hisuian Arcanine appreciates Ogerpon-C being able to deal with pesky Water- and Ground-types like Belly Drum Azumarill, Landorus, and Sandy Shocks. Coalossal is a decent physical wall that can remove hazards, which prevents Ogerpon-C's Sturdy from breaking, and deals with Chien-Pao, Kingambit, Scizor, and Corviknight. Coalossal also sets up Spikes to enhance Ogerpon-C's wallbreaking. Ogerpon-C takes care of Ursaluna-B and Manaphy for Coalossal. Iron Defense + Body Press Garganacl can act as a defensive stallbreaker, using Salt Cure to weaken impediments to Ogerpon-C sweeping, like Skeledirge, Dondozo, and Hisuian Goodra.
