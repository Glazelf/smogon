Earthquake may be used instead of Headlong Rush to avoid contact and the stat drops at the cost of dealing less damage. Ice Spinner hits Dragonite and Garchomp. Knock Off greatly hinders Leftovers-reliant Pokemon like Bronzong and Rotom-W, and it leaves common Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Slowbro and Amoonguss to be susceptible to entry hazards from teammates like Clodsire and Ting-Lu.</p> <p>Iron Treads, Quagsire, and Ting-Lu are great switch-ins to faster threats such as Choice Scarf Greninja and Gengar, as well as Baxcalibur after a Dragon Dance. Clodsire appreciates the removal of Ground-types like Ting-Lu and Iron Treads as well as the aforementioned Ice-types and Gastrodon appreciates the removal of Grass-types such as Meowscarada and Breloom. In return, Clodsire and Gastrodon switch into Water-type attacks from Quaquaval and Pelipper and set entry hazards to enhance Great Tusk's wallbreaking. Furthermore, Clodsire cripples Quagsire and Rotom-W with Toxic and Gastrodon prevents setup with Clear Smog. Sandy Shocks and Garchomp can aid against Corviknight and Amoonguss to alleviate Steel and Poison matchups, respectively.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Flutter Mane has a powerful dual STAB combination in Moonblast and Shadow Ball, as well as a plethora of coverage moves that allow it to choose its good matchups. Mystical Fire hits Steel-types such as Klefki and Iron Treads. Psyshock allows Flutter Mane to punish specially defensive switch-ins like Dragalge, Blissey, and Clodsire. Flutter Mane can run Power Gem to pressure Fire teams, OHKOing foes like Volcarona and Torkoal, and it also benefits from Protosynthesis allowing it to outspeed Scovillain under the sun. Additionally, Flutter Mane usually goes with either Thunderbolt or Energy Ball. Both are useful against Water teams, with the former helping against Toxapex and Pelipper while the latter deals with Gastrodon and Quagsire. Choice Specs further enhances Flutter Mane's wallbreaking power, allowing it to overwhelm foes such as Ting-Lu after some chip damage.</p> <p>On Fairy teams, Flutter Mane is a menacing wallbreaker that excels at taking down slower foes such as Hydreigon, Skeledirge, and Corviknight. When paired with Iron Valiant, Flutter Mane forms an offensive core that's able to alternate between Fairy-, Ghost-, and Fighting-type STAB to take down a wide range of enemies. Flutter Mane can handle Psychic-type foes such as Espathra and Hatterene, while Iron Valiant takes care of Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. Flutter Mane can fall back on either Hatterene or Tinkaton when faced with an unfavorable matchup. Both of these Pokemon provide dependable defensive options and some type of entry hazard control, but Hatterene is particularly useful due to it breaking down walls like Dondozo and Clodsire. Flutter Mane also pairs well with setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Mimikyu, as it is able to poke holes in the opponent's team, allowing them to clean late-game. In return, Azumarill can take care of priority users, such as Ceruledge and Chien-Pao. In terms of support options, Flutter Mane can rely on Fairy's Prankster users, Klefki and Grimmsnarl, to set up dual screens, therefore allowing it to withstand hits such as Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Gholdengo's Make It Rain. Grimmsnarl can then bring in Flutter Mane relatively safely thanks to Parting Shot. Klefki's Spikes and Tinkaton's Stealth Rocks also support Flutter Mane in breaking its checks such as Iron Hands and Ting Lu. Entry hazard stacking proves particularly useful against less bulky teams, as it highly limits their capacity to scout Flutter Mane without having to sacrifice a member in the process.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Iron Valiant is a special attacker with an unmatched Speed tier in a sea of physical attackers, making it a solid pick for Fighting teams. It also has a spammable Fairy STAB movr in Moonblast, which allows it to ease the Dark match up by threatening Sableye while also neutering opposing Fighting-types such as Great Tusk and Breloom. Thunderbolt hits Water- and Flying-types such as Dondozo and Corviknight. Psyshock hits Poison-types such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Clodsire, whereas Future Sight can apply pressure to opponents like Toxapex for teammates such as Breloom and Gallade. Shadow Ball hits Ghost-types such as Gholdengo and Skeledirge. Aura Sphere can be used instead as a hard-hitting STAB move, while Trick is a neat option that cripples potential switch-ins such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, Clodsire, and Skuntank.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Breloom and Gallade appreciate Iron Valiant's ability to take out physical walls as well as its ability to pressure the opponent with Future Sight. Assault Vest Iron Hands is a fantastic partner as well thanks to its ginormous HP stat that lets it deal with Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane and Hatterene that can outspeed or wall Iron Valiant. Choice Scarf users such as Flamigo, Quaquaval, and Slither Wing pressure Pokemon faster than Iron Valiant such as Greninja, Dragapult, and Cinderace. Tauros-F is another fantastic partner thanks to its ability to shatter dual screens with Raging Bull, making Iron Valiant more effective in matchups against Dark, Fairy, and Ice, all while avoiding burns thanks to its part Fire typing, which helps against Ghost and Dark teams.</p> "
