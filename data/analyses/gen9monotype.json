With Will-O-Wisp and Unaware, it can check physical set-up sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragonite or Belly Drum Azumarill that threaten Fire. Additionally, Torch Song lets Skeledirge fire back against these threats while raising its Special Attack and reducing passitivity. Hex pairs incredibly well with Will-O-Wisp, as it threatens large amounts of damage on burned foes, while Shadow Ball is a more consistent STAB option that hits opposing Skeledirge for more immediate damage. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Skeledirge avoid entry hazards chipping away at it whenever it switches in.</p> <p>Volcarona is a great teammate for Skeledirge, as it can threaten Dark-types that annoy Skeledirge such as Ting-Lu and Kingambit. In return, Skeledirge can burn physical attackers, like Dragonite, giving Volcarona more setup opportunities. Paldean Tauros-F is also a good teammate, since it can threaten the aforementioned Dark-types with its Fighting STAB while also having Intimidate to help neutralize physical attackers that Skeledirge cannot handle on its own, such as Roaring Moon. Additionally, its Choice Scarf set can outspeed and KO Greninja. Torkoal pairs well with Skeledirge due to its ability to both remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin and set them up, all while also powering up Skeledirge's Torch Song. Cinderace is a fairly good partner as well due to High Jump Kick, letting it remove Dark-types aiming to threaten Skeledirge, while also being able to remove entry hazards with Court Change and hit Poison-types such as Clodsire and Toxapex with Zen Headbutt. Scovillain is a good partner, since it can remove Water-types such as Dondozo and Rotom-W with its Grass STAB. Both Talonflame and Air Balloon Iron Moth alleviate Skeledirge's weakness to threats such as Great Tusk and Ting-Lu.</p> "

Clodsire appreciates the removal of Ground-types like Ting-Lu and Iron Treads as well as the aforementioned Ice-types and Gastrodon appreciates the removal of Grass-types such as Meowscarada and Breloom. In return, Clodsire and Gastrodon switch into Water-type attacks from Quaquaval and Pelipper and set entry hazards to enhance Great Tusk's wallbreaking. Furthermore, Clodsire cripples Quagsire and Rotom-W with Toxic and Gastrodon prevents setup with Clear Smog. Sandy Shocks and Garchomp can aid against Corviknight and Amoonguss to alleviate Steel and Poison matchups, respectively.</p> "

Mystical Fire hits Steel-types such as Klefki and Iron Treads. Psyshock allows Flutter Mane to punish specially defensive switch-ins like Dragalge, Blissey, and Clodsire. Flutter Mane can run Power Gem to pressure Fire teams, OHKOing foes like Volcarona and Torkoal, and it also benefits from Protosynthesis allowing it to outspeed Scovillain under the sun. Additionally, Flutter Mane usually goes with either Thunderbolt or Energy Ball. Both are useful against Water teams, with the former helping against Toxapex and Pelipper while the latter deals with Gastrodon and Quagsire. Choice Specs further enhances Flutter Mane's wallbreaking power, allowing it to overwhelm foes such as Ting-Lu after some chip damage.</p> <p>On Fairy teams, Flutter Mane is a menacing wallbreaker that excels at taking down slower foes such as Hydreigon, Skeledirge, and Corviknight. When paired with Iron Valiant, Flutter Mane forms an offensive core that's able to alternate between Fairy-, Ghost-, and Fighting-type STAB to take down a wide range of enemies. Flutter Mane can handle Psychic-type foes such as Espathra and Hatterene, while Iron Valiant takes care of Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. Flutter Mane can fall back on either Hatterene or Tinkaton when faced with an unfavorable matchup. Both of these Pokemon provide dependable defensive options and some type of entry hazard control, but Hatterene is particularly useful due to it breaking down walls like Dondozo and Clodsire. Flutter Mane also pairs well with setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Mimikyu, as it is able to poke holes in the opponent's team, allowing them to clean late-game. In return, Azumarill can take care of priority users, such as Ceruledge and Chien-Pao. In terms of support options, Flutter Mane can rely on Fairy's Prankster users, Klefki and Grimmsnarl, to set up dual screens, therefore allowing it to withstand hits such as Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Gholdengo's Make It Rain. Grimmsnarl can then bring in Flutter Mane relatively safely thanks to Parting Shot. Klefki's Spikes and Tinkaton's Stealth Rocks also support Flutter Mane in breaking its checks such as Iron Hands and Ting Lu. Entry hazard stacking proves particularly useful against less bulky teams, as it highly limits their capacity to scout Flutter Mane without having to sacrifice a member in the process.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Iron Valiant is a special attacker with an unmatched Speed tier in a sea of physical attackers, making it a solid pick for Fighting teams. It also has a spammable Fairy STAB movr in Moonblast, which allows it to ease the Dark match up by threatening Sableye while also neutering opposing Fighting-types such as Great Tusk and Breloom. Thunderbolt hits Water- and Flying-types such as Dondozo and Corviknight. Psyshock hits Poison-types such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Clodsire, whereas Future Sight can apply pressure to opponents like Toxapex for teammates such as Breloom and Gallade. Shadow Ball hits Ghost-types such as Gholdengo and Skeledirge. Aura Sphere can be used instead as a hard-hitting STAB move, while Trick is a neat option that cripples potential switch-ins such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, Clodsire, and Skuntank.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Breloom and Gallade appreciate Iron Valiant's ability to take out physical walls as well as its ability to pressure the opponent with Future Sight. Assault Vest Iron Hands is a fantastic partner as well thanks to its ginormous HP stat that lets it deal with Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane and Hatterene that can outspeed or wall Iron Valiant. Choice Scarf users such as Flamigo, Quaquaval, and Slither Wing pressure Pokemon faster than Iron Valiant such as Greninja, Dragapult, and Cinderace. Tauros-F is another fantastic partner thanks to its ability to shatter dual screens with Raging Bull, making Iron Valiant more effective in matchups against Dark, Fairy, and Ice, all while avoiding burns thanks to its part Fire typing, which helps against Ghost and Dark teams.</p> "
