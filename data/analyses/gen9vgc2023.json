Gholdengo is great in particular thanks to its immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kilowattrel is particularly frail, meaning it often only gets to set Tailwind and fire off a single attack before it faints. It also means in late-game scenarios, it is unreliable at dueling the meta's most common attackers like Gholdengo and Hydreigon.</p> </li> </ul>",

    "overview": "<ul> <li> <p>Tinkaton is primarily a bulky attacker, but it also has an amazing defensive typing and Fake Out, giving it good defensive utility.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tinkaton does extremely well against Murkrow teams, including Pokemon common on them like Annihilape, Hydreigon, Meowscarada, Maushold, and Murkrow itself. This makes it a very good partner for Dondozo + Tatsugiri teams, which feel pressured by Murkrow's Haze. Many of the aforementioned Pokemon are also very common on teams without Murkrow, so Tinkaton checking them well is broadly useful.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mold Breaker + Fake Out Tinkaton does well against dedicated Trick Room teams because its Fake Out bypasses Oranguru's Inner Focus and Farigiraf's Armor Tail, and it can OHKO Mimikyu through Disguise.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tinkaton struggles with the extremely common Fire-types, as well as Garchomp and Steel-types like Corviknight and Scizor, which wall it entirely. Water-types help deal with the majority of its counters, especially Rotom-W.</p> </li> </ul>",

It's also a good move to use on the Gigaton Hammer recharge turns.</p> </li> <li> <p>Assault Vest turns Tinkaton into a sponge against special attackers, which helps against common Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sitrus Berry lets Tinkaton run Protect, which helps it stall out Gigaton Hammer recharge turns. This also pairs well with Swords Dance, which is similarly convenient to have on the recharge turns.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mold Breaker is mainly good when used with Fake Out, as the ability lets Tinkaton flinch Dragonite, Farigiraf, and Oranguru. Mold Breaker also bypasses Mimikyu's Disguise.</p> </li> <li> <p>Own Tempo is valuable because there are multiple good Intimidate users: Arcanine and Gyarados, as well as Paldean Tauros-A, Paldean Tauros-B, and Salamence. If you're not very worried about dedicated Trick Room teams or Dragonite, this is a good way to improve your matchup against bulkier teams.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Steel is by far the best Tera type for Tinkaton, as it makes Gigaton Hammer very powerful, even doing good damage to targets that resist it. For example, it 2HKOes maximum HP Talonflame.</p> </li> </ul>"
