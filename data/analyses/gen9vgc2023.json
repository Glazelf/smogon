This makes it a very good partner for Dondozo + Tatsugiri teams, which feel pressured by Murkrow's Haze. Many of the aforementioned Pokemon are also very common on teams without Murkrow, so Tinkaton checking them well is broadly useful.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mold Breaker + Fake Out Tinkaton does well against dedicated Trick Room teams because its Fake Out bypasses Oranguru's Inner Focus and Farigiraf's Armor Tail, and it can OHKO Mimikyu through Disguise.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tinkaton struggles with the extremely common Fire-types, as well as Garchomp and Steel-types like Corviknight and Scizor, which wall it entirely.

It's also a good move to use on the Gigaton Hammer recharge turns.</p> </li> <li> <p>Assault Vest turns Tinkaton into a sponge against special attackers, which helps against common Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sitrus Berry lets Tinkaton run Protect, which helps it stall out Gigaton Hammer recharge turns.

If you're not very worried about dedicated Trick Room teams or Dragonite, this is a good way to improve your matchup against bulkier teams.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Steel is by far the best Tera type for Tinkaton, as it makes Gigaton Hammer very powerful, even doing good damage to targets that resist it. For example, it 2HKOes maximum HP Talonflame.</p> </li> </ul> "
