        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Hyper Voice is a decently strong Normal-type STAB move for Farigiraf to spread chip damage that softens up opponents for its allies. Psyshock tackles common Psychic-weak Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Gengar, whereas Dazzling Gleam improves its matchup into common checks like Meowscarada and Hydreigon. Imprison is used on fast offensive teams that would otherwise struggle against opposing Trick Room teams. Helping Hand allows Farigiraf to supplement a harder hitting teammate's damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Safety Goggles provides an immunity to Spore from Amoonguss and Breloom, who would otherwise prevent Trick Room from going up with it. Sitrus Berry gives Farigiraf longevity with recovery. Colbur Berry allows Farigiraf to consistently get Trick Room up in the face of Meowscarada and Hydreigon.</p> </li> <li> <p>For other notable items, Mental Herb prevents fast Taunt users like Talonflame from interrupting Farigiraf's Trick Room. Life Orb or Throat Spray are good options to improve Farigiraf's already decent damage output. Rocky Helmet can also be used for an answer to unsuspecting Maushold.</p> </li> <li> <p>180 EVs in HP allow Farigiraf to survive maximum HP Annihilape Final Gambit, and the defensive investment allows it to always survive Tera Steel Choice Specs Gholdengo Make It Rain and Focus Sash Meowscarada Knock Off.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Fairy is more of a defensive Tera type, giving it a resistance to all the types that Farigiraf was previously weak to while gaining STAB on Dazzling Gleam. Tera Normal adds damage onto Hyper Voice and removes its Dark weakness.</p> </li> </ul> "
