Focus Sash allows it to take any one hit, such as Rotom-H's Overheat, letting it set up Aurora Veil. Babiri Berry serves a similar purpose, allowing it to survive Gholdengo's Make It Rain and Tera Steel Hydreigon's Flash Cannon.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Speed investment allows Abomsnow to outspeed Garchomp while in Tailwind.</p> </li> <li> <p>Water is the primary Tera type used by Abomasnow, turning its Fire and Steel weaknesses into resistances. Ground is an alternative Tera type that allows it to fire off STAB-boosted Earth Powers, catching its common checks by surprise.</p> </li> </ul> "

Gholdengo is great in particular thanks to its immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kilowattrel is particularly frail, meaning it often only gets to set Tailwind and fire off a single attack before it faints.
