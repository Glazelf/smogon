        "description": "<p>Paldean Tauros-F’s unique defensive typing with Intimidate allows it to act as a capable defensive pivot against prominent physical attackers like Kingambit and Meowscarada. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers like Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon on the switch-in to prevent an otherwise losing matchup. Body Press is a powerful attack on Paldean Tauros-F, as it has the power to OHKO Greninja, Kingambit and Meowscarada. It also has a chance to OHKO Roaring Moon while dealing notable damage to Garganacl and Ting-Lu. Raging Bull hits foes like Breloom and Gholdengo while removing Light Screen and Reflect against offensive teams. Protect lets Paldean Tauros-F stall for Will-O-Wisp damage and grants it Leftovers recovery while scouting moves from Choice-locked foes like Dragapult and Walking Wake. Leftovers is its only source of recovery, helping it more consistently switch into resisted attacks. Heavy-Duty Boots helps Paldean Tauros-F more easily switch into U-turn from pivots like Meowscarada and Roaring Moon while synergizing well with Tera Flying to remove the Stealth Rock weakness. Heavy-Duty Boots can be more easily opted out of for Leftovers on teams with sufficient entry hazard control. Intimidate allows it to more easily take neutral hits from its checks, such as Roaring Moon’s Dragon Claw and Meowscarada’s Play Rough. Tera Flying is the preferred Tera type for granting Paldean Tauros-F resistance to Fighting and an immunity to Ground while keeping its resistances to Bug and Grass intact, allowing it to check foes like Garchomp and Great Tusk. If opting to run Leftovers, Tera Flying also grants the benefit of an immunity to all entry hazards, apart from Stealth Rock, which becomes a more inconvenient weakness.</p> <p>Paldean-F works well on many balance and bulky offense teams because of its solid defenses and lack of passivity. Due to its ability to check Dark-types like Roaring Moon and Kingambit, Paldean Tauros-F makes a great partner to Ghost-types like Dragapult and Gholdengo. In return, Dragapult can put pressure on Paldean Tauros-F’s checks, such as Dondozo and Garchomp, and Gholdengo checks status-spreading foes like Rotom-W and Toxapex. Water-types like Slowking and Greninja also appreciate Paldean Tauros-F checking Meowscarada and Breloom while countering offensive Water types like Quaquaval that can threaten Paldean Tauros-F. They can also help check Cinderace more reliably. If running Leftovers, hazard removal from allies like Corviknight and Great Tusk is appreciated. Corviknight is an especially good partner for its ability to hard counter offensive Ground-types like Great Tusk. Additionally, Great Tusk can pressure foes like Toxapex and Clodsire. Hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Great Tusk can aid the offensive pressure Paldean Tauros-F can exert by making it more difficult to switch into a typical check like Toxapex or Dragapult. Great Tusk does this job well by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes like Slowking, while Ting-Lu can check foes like Dragapult, Iron Moth, and bulky Volcarona.</p> "

Its typing is amazing offensively, making it an Electric-type that can threaten Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Its great defensive stats let it take hits from the likes of Zamazenta and Gholdengo in a pinch. Roost further boosts this defensive capability, giving Zapdos longevity. Volt Switch is essential for maintaining offensive momentum against Pokemon that Zapdos otherwise struggles with such as Galarian Slowking. Heat Wave heavily pressures Steel-types such as Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Iron Treads. Tera Electric further boosts Zapdos's Thunderbolt's power, notably giving it odds to 2HKO pivot Galarian Slowking and Zamazenta. Alternatively, Tera Steel gives Zapdos extra defensive utility, letting it take Fairy-type attacks and more easily fish for paralysis from Static, while the Poison immunity lets Zapdos more easily switch into Pokemon like Toxapex.</p> <p>Offensive Zapdos fits best on offense and bulky offense teams looking for a consistent, strong special attacker. Entry hazards from the likes of Great Tusk, Heatran, and Garganacl are heavily appreciated by Zapdos, as the chip damage is essential in helping Zapdos overwhelm common checks to it such as Landorus-T, Galarian Slowking, and Iron Treads. Garganacl also appreciates Zapdos being able to switch in on Ground- and Fighting-type moves from Pokemon like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Landorus-T. Thanks to STAB Thunder and Hurricane, Zapdos is a natural fit on rain teams to threaten out bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo that rain otherwise struggles with. Pelipper also doubles as a slow pivot, letting Zapdos come in without taking any damage. Other offensive Pokemon like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit heavily appreciate Zapdos's pivoting and ability to threaten common bulky Pokemon like Great Tusk and Toxapex. Dragapult, in particular, can form a potent VoltTurn core with Zapdos, hitting specially defensive Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire for solid damage while appreciating Zapdos forcing out Pokemon like Toxapex and Corviknight. Gholdengo is another excellent offensive teammate, being able to deal with Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire that Zapdos otherwise struggles with.</p> "

Additionally, its excellent offensive presence lets it generate momentum for its team with Volt Switch, which is quite difficult to block due to Zapdos's ability to nail Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T with a powerful Hurricane. Heat Wave 2HKOes Iron Treads, which otherwise blocks Volt Swich with impunity, and it pressures other Steel-types such as Kingambit and Gholdengo. Discharge is an option over Volt Switch or Heat Wave as an Electric-type attack that doesn't force Zapdos out, allowing it to fish for paralysis against Pokemon such as Heatran and Dragonite. Zapdos can also opt to use U-turn alongside Discharge for unblockable pivoting, which is particularly useful against Ground-types that don't fear Hurricane such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire, but it usually prefers the power and role compression of Volt Switch. Thunder Wave is another option that reliably paralyzes opposing Pokemon but makes Zapdos significantly more passive. The given EV spread allows Zapdos to outspeed Great Tusk. A more defensive spread of 248 HP / 240 Def / 20 Spe with a Bold nature sacrifices Zapdos's ability to outspeed key threats, such as Great Tusk and Gholdengo, but makes it a much more formidable wall; for example, this spread avoids the 2HKO from Great Tusk's Ice Spinner and is likely to avoid the OHKO from +2 Sneasler's Gunk Shot. Static is the preferred ability to punish physical attackers such as Great Tusk and Sneasler; however, Pressure can be used to allow Zapdos stall out low-PP moves such as Great Tusk's Close Combat, Dragapult's Draco Meteor, and Heatran's Magma Storm. Tera Steel helps Zapdos check many common sweepers in a pinch, most notably letting it take Fairy-, Ice-, and Poison-type attacks from Iron Valiant, Enamorus, Alolan Ninetales, and Sneasler. Tera Fairy is another strong option that improves Zapdos's matchup against dangerous Dark- and Dragon-types, such as Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, Dragapult, and Walking Wake, while maintaining its Fighting-type resistance.</p> <p>Zapdos is an excellent fit on bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to keep dangerous sweepers in check and pivot powerful offensive threats into play. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Hisuian Samurott can make it much harder for Pokemon such as Heatran and Ting-Lu to continuously check Zapdos. Great Tusk is a particularly good partner that can also threaten Zapdos's switch-ins, such as Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Galarian Slowking, and remove Stealth Rock if Zapdos loses its Heavy-Duty Boots. Gholdengo handles offensive threats that may overwhelm Zapdos, such as Sneasler and Iron Valiant, while Zapdos covers it against Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott. Setup sweepers such as Kingambit and Iron Valiant can make great use of Zapdos's ability to generate free turns by pivoting them into play and spreading paralysis; Kingambit especially has brilliant synergy with Zapdos, taking on Galarian Slowking, Garganacl, and Clodsire, while Zapdos handles Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Dondozo. Similarly, Zapdos can provide free entry for powerful wallbreakers such as Volcanion, Hoopa-U, Dragapult, and Heatran.</p> "

Moltres gets many free turns over the course of a game thanks to the many Pokemon it forces out, which makes U-turn a fantastic tool for pivoting and gaining momentum while also ensuring that Moltres is not passive against Pokemon such as Heatran and Ting-Lu. Hurricane is an alternative that can OHKO Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Sneasler and 2HKO Zamazenta. 12 Speed EVs allows Moltres to outspeed Jolly Kingambit.

After one Nasty Plot boost, it can 2HKO the likes of Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and Curse Garganacl, and after one Agility boost, it can outspeed would-be faster Pokemon such as +1 Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and +1 Walking Wake. Tera Blast Fairy lets it OHKO Hoopa-U while also being able to net 2HKOs on Kingambit, Assault Vest Hoopa-U, and Dragonite, all after one Nasty Plot boost. Tera Fairy also maintains its Dark resistance while letting it potentially set up in the face of Dragon-type attacks from foes like Dragapult. Alternatively, Hurricane is a strong neutral STAB move that prevents Galarian Moltres form relying too much on Terastallization to function. Tera Dark boosts Fiery Wrath's power, being able to OHKO Assault Vest Galarian Slowking after a Nasty Plot boost and Stealth Rock damage, as well as being able to 2HKO specially defensive Moltres and Assault Vest Toxapex after a Nasty Plot boost. Tera Flying is only to be used if running Hurricane, which can OHKO Zamazenta without a Nasty Plot boost, as well as non-Assault Vest Azumarill and Enamorus after a Nasty Plot boost. Sitrus Berry lets it set up much more easily, and can potentially let it trigger Berserk twice. Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to ignore Stealth Rock. Finally, Weakness Policy is a viable alternative if running dual screens support to take on super effective hits more comfortably. Because of its reliance on setup, Galarian Moltres is best utilized on hyper offense teams. Hence, it appreciates entry hazard support from suicide leads such as Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Meowscarada so that incoming foes can be worn down for Galarian Moltres to clean. Dual screens from Dragapult lets it setup much more easily, esepcially for Weakness Policy variants. Hazard control is a must when running Galarian Moltres due to its vulnerability to Stealth Rock, so it appreciates partners such as Great Tusk and Hatterene with their access to Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce. The two of them can also threaten special walls that can hinder a Galarian Moltres sweep, with Great Tusk being able to OHKO Galarian Slowking and 2HKO Ting-Lu, while Hatterene can 2HKO Clodsire. In return, Galarian Moltres can set up on and threaten Zamazenta for Great Tusk and Gholdengo for Hatterene. Bulky Unaware users such as Dondozo as well as special walls like Garganacl prevent Galarian Moltres from performing its sweep. Hence, offensive Zapdos pairs well with Galarian Moltres, being able to 2HKO both of the aforementioned Pokemon, provided Garganacl is Tera Water.

Extreme Speed is an excellent move for any physical sweeper, due to its high power and initiative over other priority users such as Kingambit. Earthquake provides coverage against bulky foes such as Toxapex, Garganacl, and Clodsire. Fire Punch OHKOes Scizor and 2HKOes physically defensive Corviknight after a Dragon Dance and Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Ice Spinner hits opposing Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Dragapult super effectively, notably OHKOing Dragapult after a Dragon Dance. Heavy-Duty Boots + Roost improves Dragonite's longevity and possibly enables it to retain Multiscale and obtain multiple boosts; preserving Multiscale is particularly useful for surviving Draco Meteor from Timid Choice Specs Dragapult. Encore can be used to provide setup opportunities and eventually overwhelm bulky Pokemon like Corviknight, Bulk Up Great Tusk, and Curse Garganacl. Tera Normal turns Extreme Speed into an incredibly powerful STAB priority move capable of shredding offensive teams after a single boost, and a timely typing change also removes Dragonite's weaknesses to Ice, Fairy, and Dragon, which can buy a free turn to set up. An Adamant nature is preferred since it maximizes the power of Extreme Speed, which often makes makes Speed stats irrelevant, but a Jolly nature can also be used to outspeed the Normal-immune Dragapult after a Dragon Dance, which is especially useful if Dragonite is running Ice Spinner.</p> <p>Offensive Dragon Dance Dragonite regularly serves as a potent win con on offensive teams that can also act as a revenge killer against fast and frail threats. Multiscale Dragonite's considerable bulk, as well as Ghost immunity with Tera Normal provides significant defensive utility for offensive teams. In particular, teams using frail offensive Pokemon such as Iron Valiant appreciate the defensive utility Dragonite brings. In return, these Pokemon can help wallbreak for a late-game Dragonite sweep. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Glimmora, and Garchomp is appreciated to weaken Pokemon such as Iron Valiant into range of boosted Extreme Speed. Dual screens support from Grimmsnarl is a potential option that can supplement Dragonite's already great bulk and virtually guarantee the ability to acquire multiple boosts. Since Dragonite struggles against bulky Unaware users such as Dondozo and Skeledirge, a teammate that can switch into and check these Pokemon, such as Rotom-W, is appreciated.

Extreme Speed alongside Tera Normal lets Dragonite clean up late-game, OHKOing faster threats like Meowscarada and potentially Cinderace at +1. It also outprioritizes Meowscarada's Sucker Punch as well as Grimmsnarl's Prankster-boosted Reflect and Thunder Wave. Earthquake covers Normal-resistant and -immune Pokemon, including foes like Dragapult, non-Air Balloon Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Kingambit. 144 HP EVs allow Dragonite to survive Tera Fairy Iron Valiant's Moonblast at +1 through Multiscale.

Unaware users like Dondozo and Skeledirge may switch into Dragonite expecting a Dragon Dance variant but take massive damage from a Choice Band-boosted attack instead. Outrage is an extremely powerful STAB move capable of 2HKOing virtually any Pokemon that does not resist it, which even includes physically defensive walls like Great Tusk and Dondozo. It can also OHKO opposing Dragonite, even with Multiscale intact. Breaking walls is not the only role Dragonite fulfills, as Extreme Speed is a strong priority move that allows it to revenge kill threats like Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon with some prior chip damage, or clean up late-game. Earthquake provides strong coverage, hitting grounded Steel-types like Gholdengo and Kingambit that resist Outrage and Extreme Speed. It's also Dragonite's strongest attack against walls like Garganacl, Toxapex, and Skeledirge to avoid locking it into Outrage. There are a couple of different options for the last moveslot. Fire Punch provides coverage for Corviknight and Tera Steel Rotom-W. Iron Head deals significant damage to Fairy-types like Hatterene and Scream Tail, as well as Tera Fairy users like Garganacl and Skeledirge. Thunder Punch is Dragonite's best option for dealing with Azumarill while also providing coverage for Corviknight. Ice Spinner is another option to hurt the likes of Great Tusk, Garchomp, and opposing Dragonite without locking into Outrage. It also ends Psychic Terrain, which allows Dragonite to use Extreme Speed against grounded Pokemon later on. Multiscale allows Dragonite to take even super effective hits from offensive Pokemon like Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Choice Specs Dragapult and KO them back. Tera Normal makes Extreme Speed even more powerful, OHKOing offensive Volcarona and Iron Moth, and removes Dragonite's usual weaknesses to attacks like Iron Valiant's Moonblast, which can be useful for revenge killing and cleaning.</p> <p>Choice Band Dragonite fits best on mostly offensive teams where it can break holes in the opposing team for its teammates to take advantage of and where its strong priority may be needed against other offensive teams. However, while Choice Band Dragonite is very powerful, it also requires a lot of support. As it is vulnerable to Stealth Rock, not only because Dragonite is weak to it but also because it negates Multiscale, strong entry hazard control is important. This can be in the form of entry hazard removal, such as Rapid Spin Great Tusk, but also in the form of entry hazard prevention, such as Hatterene and Taunt users like Meowscarada and Greninja. Knock Off users like Great Tusk and Meowscarada can remove Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from walls like opposing Great Tusk and Corviknight, which makes them easier to break for Dragonite and keeps Multiscale intact. Switching Dragonite directly into attacks should generally be avoided, since keeping Multiscale intact is desirable, so it appreciates teammates that can bring it in safely. Examples include pivot move users, such as Cinderace, Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Slowking, as well as Eject Button or Eject Pack users, such as Eject Button Hatterene, Eject Pack Great Tusk, and Eject Pack Gholdengo. Physical attackers like Kingambit and Roaring Moon appreciate Dragonite weakening or removing checks like Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Dondozo. On the other hand, special attackers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth can lure in checks like Clodsire and Slowking for Dragonite to punish. Iron Moth has the additional benefit of helping with Dragonite's fourth moveslot issue, as it can threaten Steel-types like Corviknight for Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Fairy-types like Hatterene for Dragonite lacking Iron Head.</p> "

Tera Water is preferred to get the extra boost to Aqua Jet, but Tera Fairy can also be used to reduce the continual damage from Garganacl's Salt Cure.</p> <p>Choice Band Azumarill is best used on offensive teams and benefits from the support of Pokemon that can open up opportunities for it to break holes. Pokemon like Dragapult and Rotom-W can be excellent teammates by making ample use of pivoting moves throughout a game to let Azumarill in safely. Special attackers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth can be helpful to break through walls like Dondozo that Azumarill would otherwise struggle with. Faster Pokemon like Cinderace and Roaring Moon are useful as speed control to help cover Azumarill's low Speed. Most importantly though, entry hazards help Azumarill wear down tougher foes to be picked off later in the battle, so hazard setters like Great Tusk and Glimmora, as well as spinblockers like Gholdengo, are always appreciated teammates. Defensive Pokemon that have the tools to deal with Azumarill, like Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Dondozo, are the biggest thorns in Azumarill's side. Having another wallbreaker like Dragonite and Tera Electric Iron Valiant on the team can help mitigate some of these issues.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Azumarill leverages its good bulk and typing to check key special attackers such as Walking Wake, Hydreigon, and Greninja while maintaining a powerful offensive presence. An Assault Vest offers a noticeable increase to Azumarill's special bulk, letting it check a wider pool of special attackers such as Hisuian Zoroark and Dragapult while also granting it greater flexibility in its attacking options compared to Choice Band. Liquidation and Play Rough serve as Azumarill's primary STAB attacks, possessing fantastic neutral coverage and hitting many threats such as Dragonite, Walking Wake, and Iron Valiant for super effective damage. Aqua Jet allows Azumarill to revenge kill weakened foes such as Great Tusk and Iron Moth. Ice Spinner is a powerful coverage option, 2HKOing many of Azumarill's common switch-ins such as Amoonguss and Water Absorb Clodsire. Ice Spinner's ability to remove Terrain also makes it particularly useful against opposing Psychic Terrain teams. Tera Water increases the power of Azumarill's Water-type STAB moves, letting it pick off foes such as Iron Moth from higher ranges with Aqua Jet and allowing its Liquidation to 2HKO Hatterene and OHKO offensive Great Tusk. However, Tera Water does come with noticable drawbacks, namely removing Azumarill's immunity to Dragon-type moves and resistances to Fighting- and Dark-type moves, which can make it a shakier check to Walking Wake and Greninja.</p> <p>Assault Vest Azumarill's talents will best be used by more offensive teams looking for a temporary answer to the aforementioned special threats. Partners at risk of being revenge killed by Walking Wake and Iron Valiant, such as Great Tusk and Hydreigon, will greatly appreciate Azumarill's ability to act as a buffer against these Pokemon. Despite Azumarill's good bulk, its tanking prowess can often be undermined by its vulnerability to passive damage from entry hazards and Rocky Helmet. Great Tusk is therefore an excellent partner, providing Rapid Spin support and being able to lure and remove Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Corviknight with Knock Off. Meowscarada is also an excellent ally, being able to shut down opposing entry hazard setters with Taunt while also providing Knock Off support. Furthermore, both Great Tusk and Meowscarada can support Azumarill by laying down entry hazards, which it will greatly appreciate given its ability to force switches. Ting-Lu can similarly lay down multiple layers of entry hazards and ease pressure exerted onto Azumarill in dealing with threats such as Dragapult and Iron Moth. Teammates that can bring Azumarill in safely with a pivoting move, such as Cinderace and Dragapult, are also recommended. Cinderace can assist Azumarill in dealing with entry hazards via Court Change, while Dragapult can deal with Orthworm, which may sometimes use Azumarill as an entry point to pass Shed Tail. In return, Azumarill can check key Pokemon such as Greninja that would threaten them. Azumarill greatly struggles against bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Toxapex, Dondozo, and Tera Water Garganacl. Hydreigon can exploit both Toxapex and Garganacl's passivity to set up with Substitute and Nasty Plot, though it must be wary of switching in against Toxic and Salt Cure. Breloom can pressure Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl with Bullet Seed, while Covert Cloak Gholdengo matches up quite nicely against Garganacl and opposing Breloom and can pivot into Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W.</p> "

Chilly Reception can also be used for cancelling the effects of opposing weather such as rain and sun while also enabling offensive Ice-types due to snow's Defense boost. Surf is its most reliable STAB move, being necessary to sucessfully check Iron Moth and Iron Valiant. Future Sight threatens more defensive teams when paired with physical wallbreakers such as Cinderace, as it threatens opposing defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Amoonguss. Thunder Wave can alternatively be run alongside Surf, preventing Slowking from being setup fodder for Volcarona and Dragonite. Slowking runs maximum Special Defense EVs in order to switch into a variety of other special attackers such as Walking Wake, Rotom-W, Volcarona, and Hatterene. It also lets Slowking make use of Chilly Reception and Thunder Wave for dynamic counterplay. The investment also gives Slowking more opportunities to safely pivot in front of Pokemon that aren't immediately threatening but can beat it long-term, such as Gholdengo, Garganacl, Hisuian Zoroark, and Choice Specs Dragapult. 0 Speed IVs in tandem with a Sassy nature maximize the odds of slow pivoting in front of foes, which is important to nearly guarantee safely bringing in other teammates. Slowking can utilize Tera Water to remove its Bug-, Ghost-, and Dark-type weaknesses, enhancing its matchup against Gholdengo, Dragapult, Greninja, and Volcarona while also allowing it to absorb U-turn better. Additionally, it also boosts Surf's damage output. Tera Fairy turns the tables on Dragapult and Greninja, allowing it to wall their Choice Specs sets reliably.</p> <p>Slowking fits on balance teams due to its exclusive access to Chilly Reception, as they can take advantage of both the snow and momentum generated by it. Slowking enjoys being paired with Pokemon that can generate momentum, such as Cinderace, Rotom-W, and Sandy Shocks. This helps its team to pivot around Garganacl to avoid being worn down by its Salt Cure. Slowking is naturally paired with physically defensive walls with good synergy, such as Great Tusk, Amoonguss, and Corviknight, which answer many of Slowking´s checks such as Kingambit, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon. Slowking is generally vulnerable to becoming fodder for Orthworm, since it can't paralyze targets through Orthworm´s passed Substitutes. As such, Pokemon like Infiltrator Dragapult and Unaware Pokemon like Skeledirge and Dondozo are logical Slowking teammates that fix this issue, with Unaware teammates in particular being crucial for answering setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Iron Valiant that are present on hyper offense teams. Dark-types like Kingambit can check and occasionally switch into special attackers that have an advantage against Slowking like Nasty Plot Gholdengo, Choice Specs Greninja, and Choice Specs Dragapult, creating good defensive synergy without lacking offensive capabilities.</p> "

Additionally, it has access to good offensive options and Future Sight, letting it support and enable offensive teammates. Additionally, Future Sight can help break Substitute from the likes of Iron Moth, preventing it from having opportunities to sweep. Psychic can be used over Future Sight as a more consistent alternative, providing more immediate pressure against the likes of Zamazenta, Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Iron Moth. Flamethrower hits Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Corviknight that can otherwise snuff out Future Sight. Surf is key for hitting Pokemon like Landorus-T and Heatran, 2HKOing the former, while also hitting Great Tusk and Iron Moth without having to rely on Future Sight. Alternatively, Ice Beam wrecks Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Garchomp while also hitting the likes of Dragapult and Dragonite. Tera Fairy gives Galarian Slowking a generally good defensive typing, notably being immune to Dragon-type moves from the likes of Dragapult and Walking Wake. Tera Flying turns Galarian Slowking’s weakness to Ground into an immunity while also making it resist U-turn, allowing it to switch into non-Ice Spinner Great Tusk most of the time. Tera Water lets Galarian Slowking snuff out Fire-types like Cinderace, Volcanion, and Heatran while also resisting Water-type attacks from Pokemon like Hisuian Samurott, Walking Wake, and Azumarill. Additionally, it boosts the power of Surf, letting it potentially OHKO Landorus-T and 2HKO Heatran. 120 Special Defense EVs let Galarian Slowking take two Shadow Balls from Choice Specs Dragapult at full health, while 16 Defense EVs ensure that it can survive two Psyshocks from Choice Specs Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock, which also means surviving Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge from full health. Ground-immune Pokemon such as Zapdos, Moltres, and Corviknight make for excellent teammates, as they can switch into Ground-type moves from the likes of Great Tusk and overwhelm them. Offensive Pokemon like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus heavily appreciate Future Sight being able to overwhelm Pokemon like Garganacl, Amoonguss, and Zamazenta. Galarian Slowking's reliance on Assault Vest to function against Pokemon like Dragapult, in addition to its weakness to Dark, leaves it heavily vulnerable to Knock Off from the likes of Iron Valiant and Meowscarada. As a result, Corviknight is a great partner, as it can take Knock Off and provide Defog support, helping maintain Galarian Slowking's longevity. The weakness to Dark leaves Galarian Slowking especially vulnerable to the likes of Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, and Roaring Moon.

Future Sight's delayed damage is incredibly difficult to deal with when Galarian Slowking is paired with strong wallbreakers, while Psychic is a fine alternative to immediately damage Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Sneasler. Chilly Reception allows Galarian Slowking to pivot out, with the added bonus of resetting opposing weather; its poor Speed alongside minimum investment ensures that its teammate can switch in safely. Thunder Wave cripples would-be checks like Heatran and Kingambit, and the speed control against fast threats like Dragapult and Cinderace can greatly aid its teammates. Surf has solid coverage alongside Galarian Slowking's STAB moves, hitting Heatran, Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, and Ursaluna for decent damage. Slack Off provides Galarian Slowking with reliable recovery, and—alongside Regenerator—can give it tremendous amount of staying power. Toxic can be considered over Thunder Wave to force progress against defensive threats like Skeledirge and Dondozo. Ice Beam can greatly pressure Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Dragapult with a single moveslot. Flamethrower punishes Kingambit and Gholdengo. Lastly, Grass Knot hits Tera Water Garganacl hard and can reliably 2HKO Dondozo. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Galarian Slowking to continuously pivot without having Regenerator's recovery nullified by entry hazards, while Shuca Berry allows it to either pivot into or directly retaliate against a Ground-type attack from Great Tusk, Landorus-T, or Enamorus. Colbur Berry allows Galarian Slowking to reliably check Knock Off Iron Valiant and Night Slash Sneasler, both of which can otherwise greatly threaten it. Both Tera Grass and Tera Water grant a resistance to Water-type attacks from Azumarill and Walking Wake. Moreover, Tera Grass turns its Ground weakness into a resistance, while Tera Water allows Galarian Slowking to sponge attacks from Heatran, Cinderace, and Iron Moth while powering up Surf. Tera Flying provides a crucial Ground immunity and U-turn resistance while keeping Galarian Slowking's Fighting resistance, letting it reliably switch into Great Tusk variants that lack Ice Spinner. A Sassy nature with maximum Special Defense investment can be used to deal with Enamorus and Shadow Ball Iron Valiant more easily.</p> <p>Galarian Slowking fits on a wide assortment of balance and bulky offense teams, which greatly appreciate its ability to defensively support its teammates while providing significant offensive pressure itself. Powerful wallbreakers like Choice Band Zamazenta, Sneasler, and Ursaluna appreciate Galarian Slowking's ability to both pivot them in safely with Chilly Reception and pressure would-be defensive checks like Corviknight, Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Dondozo with Future Sight, which forces them into 2HKO or even OHKO range against these wallbreakers. Dragapult is a solid teammate, as it appreciates Galarian Slowking's ability to check Enamorus and Booster Energy Iron Valiant; in return, Dragapult can wallbreak or disrupt teams with its own status moves. Zapdos and Landorus-T have solid defensive synergy with Galarian Slowking thanks to their Ground immunity and ability to check physical attackers like Great Tusk while forming a VoltTurn core with it. Garganacl and Kingambit have good defensive synergy with Galarian Slowking, since they can sponge repeated Ghost-type attacks from Dragapult and Gholdengo while it can check threats like Enamorus and Fighting-types like Sneasler, Zamazenta, and some Iron Valiant sets in return. Kingambit in particular appreciates Galarian Slowking's Future Sight support and ability to pressure Fire-types.</p> "

Close Combat grants Scizor coverage against Pokemon such as Iron Treads, Kingambit, and Garganacl and provides strong neutral coverage against foes like Rotom-W and Corviknight, especially if not running the corresponding coverage move. Thief is a good way for Scizor to deal a good amount of damage against Gholdengo, while Trailblaze can be used to deal with defensive Water-types like Rotom-W lacking Will-O-Wisp and Dondozo. Tera Steel is Scizor's best option for a Tera type, since it not only gives a boost to Scizor's Bullet Punch but also makes Scizor resistant to Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Tera Electric + Tera Blast can be run to hit Flying- and Water-types such as Toxapex, Dondozo, Corviknight, and Tera Flying Kingambit. 20 Speed EVs are run in order for Scizor to outspeed Corviknight.</p> <p>Offensive teams appreciate Scizor's wallbreaking and revenge killing abilities. Scizor gets easily forced out by Great Tusk as well as Fire-types such as Skeledirge, Cinderace, and Volcarona. Therefore, Water-types such as Rotom-W and Azumarill make for good teammates. Rotom-W in particular synergizes well with Scizor, since the two of them can form a potent VoltTurn core. Azumarill also greatly appreciates Scizor pivoting into it. In return, Scizor can check Grass-types they struggle against like Breloom and Meowscarada. Scizor appreciates teammates that allow it to wallbreak much more easily, so entry hazard support from Pokemon like Garchomp are greatly appreciated. Gholdengo is another good teammate, since it can keep hazards on the field for Scizor to exploit in order to sweep late-game. If Scizor isn't running Thief, it can easily be checked by Gholdengo, so Dark-types like Kingambit pair well with Scizor. However, if Scizor is running Thief, it can struggle against Water-types, so Grass-types like Breloom, Meowscarada, and Tera Grass Volcarona make for good teammates. Scizor's lack of longevity means it can struggle with hazards, so hazard removers like Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for good teammates. Most of Scizor's damage output comes from Bullet Punch, so it dislikes Pokemon like Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Gholdengo switching into it. Thus, Pokemon that can counter them such as Meowscarada for the former, as well as Iron Moth for the latter two make for good teammates. Finally, setup sweepers such as Dragapult, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon appreciate Scizor muscling through walls like Garganacl, Tera Fairy Skeledirge, and Ting-Lu.

        "description": "<p>Torkoal is best known for setting up sun and facilitating strong sun teams, carrying them on its shell. Torkoal uses Lava Plume for its good Base Power and burn chance, but Flamethrower can be used for more power, notably guaranteeing in breaking Dragapult's Substitute, which would otherwise use Torkoal as setup fodder. Stealth Rock is used, as Torkoal is usually leading and can get entry hazards up early-game. Rapid Spin keeps entry hazards off the field, which allows it and its teammates, particularly the Fire-types, to stay healthy throughout the game. Yawn provides opportunities for its strong teammates, whether through a sleeping foe or a forced switch. However, Will-O-Wisp can be used to more consistently cripple physical attackers, while Body Press can be used to take advantage of its great Defense against Kingambit and Roaring Moon. Tera Water gives Torkoal a great defensive typing, flipping matchups against Pokemon like Great Tusk and Azumarill and removing its weakness to Stealth Rock, letting it stay in the game longer and cripple the aforementioned wallbreakers with a burn. A Calm nature alongside maximum Special Defense investment can also be considered, as it can avoid the 2HKO from attacks like Iron Moth's Sludge Wave, Galarian Slowking's Future Sight and Gholdengo's unboosted Shadow Ball</p> <p>Pokemon that take advantage of Torkoal's sun are great partners. Some of these Pokemon include Walking Wake, which greatly appreciates the immense power boost to both its Special Attack or Speed alongside Hydro Steam, and it is also great at threatening weather setters like Tyranitar and Pelipper. Other strong Protosynthesis Pokemon can use the power or Speed boosts the sun provides. Great Tusk can use an Attack or Defense boost to wallbreak or check physical attackers such as Kingambit and Dragonite, respectively. Similarly, Roaring Moon uses the Speed or Attack boost to become a powerful wallbreaker with Choice Band. Brute Bonnet is a particularly excellent sun abuser; its Spore can effectively shut down a target, and with an Attack boost from Protosynthesis its Bullet Seed easily breaks past Dondozo while its Sucker Punch is devastating against faster threats like Dragapult or opposing Walking Wake. Hisuian Lilligant is another solid teammate and a decent alternative to Brute Bonnet; its powerful Solar Blade can muscle past Dondozo, its STAB Close Combat can deal with Heatran, and it can become an incredibly dangerous sweeper even against offensive teams thanks to Chlorophyll's Speed boost. Fire-types like Cinderace, Ceruledge, and Iron Moth enjoy having their STAB moves boosted even further. Moreover, the aforementioned Cinderace and Great Tusk also provide additional entry hazard control with Court Change and Rapid Spin, alleviating Torkoal from entry hazard pressure and having to remove them itself. Hatterene is a great teammate on fast-paced sun teams, as it deflects Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce and prevents Torkoal and their teammates from taking as much chip damage as well as potentially heal Torkoal up with Healing Wish. Lastly, Kingambit offers sun teams a solid answer to Galarian Slowking and a powerful late-game wincon, as it can clean up once Torkoal and the teammates it enables have worn the opposing team down sufficiently. It especially appreciates Torkoal's ability to give it openings to set up a Swords Dance thanks to Torkoal's Yawn or Will-O-Wisp support.</p> "

Moreover, its naturally high Speed tier alongside Swift Swim lets Floatzel outspeed the whole unboosted metagame under rain, giving it an edge against offensive teams by outpacing and threatening boosted frail threats like Dragapult, Volcarona, and every Speed-boosting Booster Energy Pokemon, such as Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Walking Wake. Liquidation is a safer attack to keep Floatzel healthy when Wave Crash's power isn't necessary, such as against weak and neutral targets like Great Tusk, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge, and is the preferred attack to clean up late-game once the opposition is weakened enough. Aqua Jet picks off faster and boosted foes especially if rain isn't active, such as Iron Moth, Volcarona, and Tera Flying Roaring Moon, and outprioritizes Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Ceruledge's Shadow Sneak. Ice Spinner complements Floatzel's STAB moves to reliably hit the likes of Dragonite, Dragapult, Amoonguss, and Water Absorb Clodsire.</p> <p>Floatzel is exclusively found on offensive rain teams. Pelipper is a mandatory teammate to reliably set rain with Drizzle and compensate for Floatzel's frailty by bringing it in safely via U-turn. Choice Specs variants of Pelipper and other offensive rain partners like Azumarill, Walking Wake, and Greninja can keep up the pressure against the opposition, overwhelming shared checks like Dondozo, Toxapex, and Tera Water Garganacl. Ground-types like Iron Treads, Great Tusk, and Clodsire provide a necessary Electric immunity while setting entry hazards, making Dondozo and Toxapex easier to break through; Iron Treads and Great Tusk also provide Knock Off to cripple the bulky Water-types, including Alomomola and Tera Water Skeledirge, by making them susceptible to Stealth Rock as well, while Water Absorb Clodsire is a rigid defensive backbone against the likes of Azumarill, Walking Wake, and Tera Grass Volcarona, all of which can force Floatzel out. Eject Button Amoonguss can bring Floatzel in safely on Pokemon like Great Tusk, Gholdengo, Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Ting-Lu, incapacitate foes with Spore to give it more wallbreaking opportunities, and switch into and threaten Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl for Floatzel. Pawmot's Revival Blessing compensates for Floatzel's tendency to faint early-game from Wave Crash recoil—especially against common Rocky Helmet users like Corviknight and Amoonguss—and lets it wallbreak or even clean up in the late-game afterwards and enjoys Floatzel pressuring Great Tusk in return. Kingambit is a stellar late-game cleaner that enjoys Floatzel pressuring its checks in Great Tusk and Volcarona and overwhelming a common answer in Dondozo, as well as takes advantage of Floatzel fainting early-game from Wave Crash recoil to accumulate Supreme Overlord boosts.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Garchomp is a formidable tank that can reliably set multiple layers of entry hazards while still possessing an adequate offensive presence itself. Notably, it matches up well against common spinners like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Glimmora, especially as it can punish them from doing so with Rocky Helmet + Rough Skin. This combination is also valuable to spread chip damage onto physical attackers like Kingambit and Dragonite and punish pivots such as Cinderace and Corviknight. Dragon Tail forces out setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Tera Flying Kingambit, and Air Balloon Gholdengo, and it works extremely well to force entry hazard damage onto foes such as Tera Fairy Garganacl, Dondozo, and Iron Valiant. Tera Ghost is used to completely spinblock Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Alternatively, Tera Steel lets it emergency check Dragapult, Meowscarada, and block Glimmora's Mortal Spin, while Tera Water allows it to deal with Gholdengo, Scizor, and Hatterene better.</p> <p>Garchomp fits best on hazard stacking teams that range from bulky offense to offense. Gholdengo is a near-necessary teammate that can prevent most attempts of entry hazard removal, and it can make use of them itself to chip down checks like Tera Water Garganacl, Amoonguss, and Clodsire. Knock Off users like Meowscarada and Great Tusk can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Amoonguss, Kingambit, and Dragonite to make them susceptible to Garchomp's entry hazards; Great Tusk in particular provides Rapid Spin as well, which removes entry hazards on your side of the field and subsequently maintains your own entry hazards up the opponent's side. Offensive Pokemon like Greninja, Dragapult, and Iron Valiant tend to force multiple switches and enjoy entry hazards chipping down their checks such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, Clodsire, and Garganacl. Substitute Skeledirge is a fantastic teammate that can take advantage of entry hazards itself, use its defensive profile to cover Fairy- and Ice-types like Iron Valiant and Alolan Ninetales, threaten Defog Corviknight from removing entry hazards, and pressure Hatterene, which would otherwise prevent Garchomp's antics and use it as setup fodder.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Mixed Garchomp is a fantastic wallbreaker that can threaten common walls such as Great Tusk, Dondozo, Toxapex, and Clodsire. Draco Meteor hits physical walls. Great Tusk and Dondozo in particular are hit hard by Draco Meteor, with Great Tusk pressured while switching in to remove entry hazards and Dondozo's Unaware letting Garchomp freely use Draco Meteor multiple times on it. Fire Blast covers Steel-type Pokemon such as Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo, the former of which would otherwise switch into Garchomp and clear entry hazards. Stealth Rock is generally preferred if a team does not have another Stealth Rock user, but Spikes can be used to capitalize on the switches that Garchomp forces. A Rash nature makes Garchomp much harder to switch into, even letting it OHKO defensive Great Tusk after one layer of Spikes, but Naive can be used to outspeed Hydreigon and Speed tie opposing Garchomp. Tera Fire is the preferred Tera type, due to it powering up Garchomp's Fire Blast and providing it a resistance to attacks such as Iron Valiant's Moonblast and Hatterene's Draining Kiss, as well as an immunity to Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W, Dragapult, and Skeledirge. Tera Steel similarly flips Garchomp's type matchup, providing it with a useful Dragon and Fairy resistance while maintaining its Stealth Rock resistance.</p> <p>Garchomp fits on offensive teams thanks to its ability to set entry hazards and wear down common defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex, Clodsire, and Dondozo, with Life Orb-boosted attacks while keeping entry hazards up against common hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Corviknight. Sweepers such as Kingambit, Dragon Dance Dragapult, Calm Mind Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Bulk Up Great Tusk appreciate Garchomp breaking holes in the opposing team early-game. Garchomp is forced out by Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant and Tera Fairy Garganacl, as well as Dragon-types such as Dragapult and Roaring Moon without using Terastallization, so support from Steel-type partners is appreciated to switch into these Pokemon. Kingambit is another good partner because it takes on Dragapult and appreciates Garchomp wearing down Great Tusk and Dondozo. Hatterene and Tera Fairy Skeledirge can also take on these Dragon-types while spreading further passive damage with Magic Bounce or Will-O-Wisp. Garchomp can also form a hazard stacking core with lead Meowscarada or other Stealth Rock users such as Great Tusk and Ting-Lu, and Garchomp can pressure common Rapid Spin users. Gholdengo is a great partner for Garchomp, since it blocks most forms of hazard removal while appreciating Garchomp soft checking Iron Moth. Garchomp is also prone to being worn down quickly thanks to Life Orb recoil, entry hazards, and being prediction reliant, so teammates that can clear hazards are appreciated. These include Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads, which all appreciate Garchomp wearing down their common switch-ins such as opposing Great Tusk and Rotom-W.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Garchomp makes for a powerful physical wallbreaker with Swords Dance, using its Attack boosts to ensure OHKOs against a number of foes in the metagame. Garchomp’s incredible STAB combination of Dragon / Ground can annihilate most walls and defensive cores at +2, with Earthquake reliably knocking out bulky Pokemon like Toxapex, Kingambit, defensive Gholdengo, and Garganacl, and Dragon Claw hitting a vast majority of foes that resist Earthquake, such as Rotom-W and Breloom. Dragon Claw is preferred to Outrage, as it doesn’t provide free switch-in opportunities to prominent Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant and Hatterene. Substitute is essential for letting Garchomp block incoming status, especially from foes it cannot always OHKO, such as Skeledirge, non-Foul Play Amoonguss, and Rotom-W. Substitute can be set up on a forced switch to ensure Garchomp gets a chance to use Swords Dance, and can be set up for free against U-turns from slow pivots like Corviknight. Leftovers allows Garchomp to heal off Substitute damage, giving it more chances to use it. With Rough Skin, Garchomp punishes Great Tusk using Rapid Spin and U-turn from pivots like Cinderace. Tera Ground allows Garchomp to hit much harder with Earthquake, giving it the extra power to OHKO Hatterene, Garganacl after Stealth Rock chip, and potentially Amoonguss and offensive Great Tusk sets at +2. Alternatively, Tera Steel is a more defensive option used to resist Iron Valiant's Moonblast and Dragapult's Draco Meteor, the latter being very important, as Infiltrator allows it to bypass Garchomp’s Substitute.</p> <p>Garchomp is a solid wallbreaker on balance and bulky offense teams, due to its power complemented by defensive utility from Substitute, Leftovers, and decent bulk that gives it opportunities for consistent use throughout a battle. Garchomp mainly struggles against Corviknight, as well as exceptionally bulky physical walls such as Dondozo and Great Tusk. Special wallbreakers like Greninja, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth threaten these walls to Garchomp and therefore make excellent partners. Dragapult can also provide much-needed special offense while pressuring Dondozo and Corviknight with Draco Meteor and Flamethrower, forming a dangerous Dragon-type spam core with Garchomp and providing speed control that Garchomp cannot, especially against foes like Iron Valiant and Greninja. Additionally, Dragapult can use U-turn to scout a forced switch and safely bring Garchomp into battle against foes like Clodsire and Kingambit. Entry hazard setters like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Glimmora are great partners, as they allow Garchomp to secure KOs against opponents like Tera Fairy Garganacl and Amoonguss, which it otherwise cannot OHKO at +2. Glimmora and Great Tusk are especially good for this role, as they can both remove hazards that hinder Garchomp’s wallbreaking potential, and the latter can cripple Corviknight by removing its Leftovers with Knock Off. Fast sweepers, such as Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult, can easily revenge kill Garchomp, especially when its Substitute is down. A defensive backbone made up of Pokemon like Clodsire and Corviknight is essential for Garchomp’s team. Lastly, Garchomp gives great support to late-game and sweepers like Dragapult that appreciate foes like defensive Gholdengo, Toxapex, and Clodsire being removed.</p> "

Hydro Pump pressures Garganacl, Cinderace, and Skeledirge, but most importantly, it dents Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu that attempt to block its Volt Switch. Moreover, its immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes make it an even more effective pivot in the face of entry hazards.

Entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Great Tusk take advantage of the multiple switches that pivot teams tend to force, crumbling the opposing team slowly just by keeping up momentum; in return, Rotom-W helps check entry hazard removers like Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads. Due to Rotom-W's nature of constantly pivoting, spinners and Defoggers like Great Tusk and Corviknight are appreciated; Great Tusk, in particular, can threaten Clodsire, one of Rotom-W's sturdiest answers, while Corviknight's U-turn complements Rotom-W's pivoting duties. Defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu are viable options to cover threats like Breloom, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult, respectively; in return, they enjoy Rotom-W checking Cinderace and Garchomp.

Hydro Pump is the strongest move it has, meaningfully hurting a wide range of Pokemon, and it punishes Ground-types such as Greak Tusk, Clodsire, and Garchomp that attempt to block Volt Switch. Rotom-W can outspeed the entire unboosted metagame with its Choice Scarf, allowing it to reliably hit Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Garganacl. Trick is essential to cripple walls that can recover from Rotom-W's attacks, like Toxapex and Tera Fairy Garganacl.

Will-O-Wisp is just as useful as Thunder Wave, disarming physical threats like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, Breloom, and Meowscarada. Tera Steel gives Rotom-W an immunity to Toxic from Clodsire and Toxapex, as well as a resistance to Meowscarada's Flower Trick, Breloom's Bullet Seed, Iron Valiant's Moonblast, and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. On top of this, Levitate makes Steel's Ground weakness into an immunity; notably, EdgeQuake can't hit Tera Steel Rotom-W neutrally. Alternatively, Tera Water takes a more offensive approach, boosting the power of Hydro Pump to 2HKO Gholdengo, and it can potentially OHKO physically defensive Garganacl and Clodsire.</p> <p>Rotom-W sits comfortably on balance and bulky offense teams. It pairs well with defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight, Toxapex, and Amoonguss, which use their Grass resistances and/or recovery to sponge hits like Breloom's Bullet Seed, Meowscarada's Flower Trick, and Ting-Lu's Ruination. Rotom-W pressures entry hazard removers like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Corviknight, and Cinderace, which helps hazard setters. Great Tusk is a great example, since it also removes hazards to ease Rotom-W's pivoting. More offensive partners like Iron Valiant, Cinderace, and Dragapult love Rotom-W crippling bothersome walls like Ting-Lu and Amoonguss with Trick.

Taunt can be used to stop Toxapex's Recover and Galarian Slowking's Chilly Reception and Slack Off, thus allowing Heatran to trap them. Heatran is an effective Stealth Rock user thanks to its good matchup against common entry hazard removal options in Defog Corviknight and bulky Court Change Cinderace. Tera Blast Grass gives Heatran a way to hit Water-types such as Rotom-W, Hisuian Samurott, and Azumarill, as well as threatening an OHKO against Great Tusk. Furthermore, Tera Grass works well with Flash Fire and turns Heatran's Ground and Water weaknesses into resistances, improving its matchup against the aforementioned Pokemon as well as Volcanion and letting it potentially trap the likes of Dondozo and Clodsire. Leftovers lets Heatran heal throughout the game and makes it easier for it to trap its targets. Air Balloon is another option that allows Heatran to take a hit from Pokemon that would usually target it with Earthquake or Earth Power such as Enamorus, Ursaluna, and opposing Heatran and heavily damage them.

Heatran's ability to force heavy damage against Amoonguss, Hatterene, and defensive Zapdos makes it a good Great Tusk partner. Great Tusk, in turn, provides Rapid Spin support to keep the field clear from entry hazards, which Heatran tends to get worn down by. Zapdos can defensively check Fighting-types that outspeed Heatran, such as Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, Sneasler, and offensive Great Tusk, as well as Hisuian Samurott, which tends to use Heatran as an opportunity to fire off Ceaseless Edge. Enamorus is also able to check Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Hisuian Samurott, though it struggles to safely switch into them consistently due to its lesser bulk. Dragapult can threaten the Dragon-types that don't take much damage from Heatran's attacks, such as Dragonite, Walking Wake, and Garchomp. Furthermore, its Water resistance and Fighting immunity let it answer Volcanion and Zamazenta aiming to KO Heatran. Lastly, Rillaboom's ability to summon Grassy Terrain via Grassy Surge provides Heatran with extra passive recovery, boosts the power of its Tera Blast Grass, and weakens the damage it takes from Earthquake, letting Heatran survive physically defensive Great Tusk's Earthquake from full health.</p> "

Magma Storm is a strong STAB move that lets it potentially trap the likes of Toxapex and Galarian Slowking, and which even Fire-resistant foes such as Garchomp and Rotom-W can struggle against due to its passive damage. Taunt allows Heatran to block status moves such as Toxapex's Recover and Galarian Slowking's Chilly Reception. Alternatively, Protect can be used to gain extra Leftovers recovery, deal further damage with Magma Storm, and scout Choice item users such as Dragapult, Enamorus, and Zamazenta. Earth Power provides a way for Heatran to dent Fire-types such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, and opposing Heatran, and it lets Heatran continuously chip Toxapex and Galarian Slowking to more easily remove them after having trapped them. Stealth Rock is used to take advantage of its good matchup against hazard control options such as Hatterene, Corviknight, and bulky Cinderace. Tera Blast Grass is an alternative that lets Heatran threaten the likes of Rotom-W and Hisuian Samurott. Lastly, Will-O-Wisp is another option that allows Heatran to punish Dragonite, Garchomp, and Roaring Moon trying to switch in, as well as Kingambit aiming to revenge kill Heatran with Sucker Punch. The set opts for near maximum Special Defense investment with enough Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Kingambit and Azumarill. The 4 Defense EVs in conjunction with maximum HP allows Heatran to always survive an Earthquake from Clodsire from full health. Tera Grass's benefits go beyond the Tera Blast coverage, as it also gives Heatran a resistance to Water- and Ground-type attacks, which expands its range of Pokemon it can trap to include Dondozo, Clodsire, and Garganacl. Tera Grass also synergizes beautifully with Flash Fire, as it removes the potential weakness to Fire-type attacks. Tera Flying is another option that gets rid of Heatran's weakness to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, notably improving its matchup against Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Dragapult appreciates Heatran's ability to switch into Choice Scarf Gholdengo's Shadow Ball, Choice Scarf Enamorus's Moonblast, and opposing Dragapult's STAB moves. Great Tusk is another Pokemon that appreciates Heatran's support against said special attackers, as well as against Zapdos, Amoonguss, and Hatterene, and in turn it is able to keep Heatran healthy by removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Heatran and Toxapex make for a solid defensive core thanks to the former's ability to take on Hatterene, Zapdos, and Gholdengo that annoy Toxapex, and the latter's resistance to Fighting- and Water-type moves that aim to target Heatran such as Close Combat from Iron Valiant, Sneasler, and Zamazenta, Walking Wake's Hydro Steam, and Greninja's Hydro Pump.</p> "

After several Calm Mind boosts, Stored Power allows Cresselia to muscle past both Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Dondozo and bulky Psychic-resistant foes like Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Heatran while making it nigh impossible to KO with special attackers. Moonblast rounds out Cresselia's coverage, allowing it to hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Greninja super effectively while being able to at least damage Kingambit; Tera Blast Fighting greatly improves Cresselia's matchup against Kingambit and hits these Dark-types harder than Moonblast, but makes Cresselia more reliant on Terastallization. Leftovers grants Cresselia crucial passive healing, allowing it to conserve its limited Moonlight PP long-term; Covert Cloak, on the other hand, blocks secondary effects from an array of moves, including Heatran's Magma Storm, Garganacl's Salt Cure, Zapdos's Discharge, and Sneasler's Dire Claw, allowing Cresselia to set up against these threats more safely. Grassy Seed is an option if Cresselia is used on Grassy Terrain hyper offense teams, which gives it more opprotunities to set up in the face of physical attackers while also boosting its Stored Power. Tera Poison has wonderful synergy with Levitate, giving Cresselia a single weakness to Psychic-type attacks, granting it resistances to Poison- and Fairy-type attacks, and an immunity to Toxapex's Toxic while still maintaining its Fighting resistance. Defensively, Tera Fighting lets Cresselia flip its Dark weakness against prominent Pokemon like Meowscarada, Greninja, Hisuian Samurott, and the aforementioned Kingambit as well. 52 Speed EVs allow Cresselia to outspeed Kingambit.</p> <p>Cresselia fits well on an array of hyper offense, offense, and balance teams capable of supporting such a potent wincon. Heatran, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T can provide entry hazard support to wear down foes over time. Heatran can also use Will-O-Wisp to cripple Kingambit or trap and wear down threats like Haze Toxapex and Chilly Reception Galarian Slowking with Magma Storm and Taunt; in return, Cresselia can handle threats like Great Tusk and Zamazenta that Heatran struggles against. Kingambit is ubiquitous and is a major thorn in Cresselia's side; as such, Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Low Kick Kingambit are crucial partners that can help stop opposing Kingambit's attempt to countersweep. Assault Vest Toxapex is a great teammate for Cresselia; it can take on Encore Iron Valiant, which is a frustrating matchup for Cresselia, and it can trap and deal with opposing defensive Toxapex, which can shut down Cresselia's boosts with Haze and force Cresselia to Tera Poison in order to avoid being crippled by Toxic. Thanks to Grassy Surge, Rillaboom is a necessary partner for Grassy Seed variants; it can support Cresselia with utility options like Knock Off and U-turn too.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Courtesy of its Spikes-setting signature move, Ceaseless Edge, Hisuian Samurott is a good lead for hyper offense teams. With Sharpness, Razor Shell is Hisuian Samurott's strongest move, dealing high damage to many opposing leads such as Great Tusk and Glimmora. Surf is an alternative over Razor Shell that trades overall power for the ability to hit Great Tusk's lower Special Defense and avoid activating Glimmora's Toxic Debris. Knock Off allows Hisuian Samurott to make progress against the enemy team by removing items, especially Heavy-Duty Boots, but Taunt is another option that denies opposing entry hazards and prevents Defog. For the last slot, Aqua Jet is useful for finishing off faster leads such as Great Tusk, while Sucker Punch is a stronger but less reliable Aqua Jet alternative that hits Pokemon like Dragapult and Walking Wake. Finally, Encore is useful for locking opposing Pokemon into undesirable moves such as forcing an opposing lead to use Stealth Rock repeatedly, allowing Hisuian Samurott to stack more Spikes with Ceaseless Edge. Taunt and Encore also prevent Hisuian Samurott from becoming setup fodder from Pokemon like Iron Defense Zamazenta and Tera Water Garganacl that attempt to exploit Hisuian Samurott's relative passivity. Focus Sash ensures Hisuian Samurott can take any one hit and set up at least one layer of Spikes. Tera Ghost is the preferred option to block Rapid Spin. However, Tera Water can also be considered to power up Hisuian Samurott's Water-type STAB moves, especially if running Aqua Jet. Sharpness is generally the preferred ability to boost the power of both Ceaseless Edge and Razor Shell. However, if Hisuian Samurott is using Surf instead, Torrent can also be considered for greater power against bulky variants of Great Tusk when at low health, which works extremely well with Focus Sash.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott fits best on hyper offense teams looking for a suicide lead to start the game off with entry hazards. This set is useful, as it virtually guarantees that a layer of Spikes will go up, since Ceaseless Edge is not affected by Taunt and Hatterene's Magic Bounce. Gholdengo is highly recommended to deny opposing Rapid Spin and Defog. A Stealth Rock setter such as Great Tusk or Sandy Shocks can further supplement the team's hazard pressure. In particular, Sandy Shocks has a strong matchup against Zapdos and Glimmora, while Hisuian Samurott can cover Ting-Lu for Sandy Shocks. A Knock Off user such as Meowscarada, Great Tusk, or Iron Valiant can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from enemy Pokemon to make them vulnerable to Spikes. Powerful sweepers that can take advantage of the hazard pressure Hisuian Samurott creates are good teammates. Such Pokemon include Kingambit, Dragonite, Sneasler, Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant. These Pokemon all appreciate Spikes support to wear down bulky targets such as Dondozo, Garganacl, and Ting-Lu. Strong wallbreakers such as Ursaluna also enjoy Hisuian Samurott's Spikes to make them even harder to wall.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Swords Dance allows Hisuian Samurott to go far beyond its presumed role of just an entry hazard setter, boosting its attack to obscene levels and letting it pose a wallbreaking threat as well. Aside from its reliability and higher critical hit ratio, Aqua Cutter's main benefit is to avoid Static from Zapdos and Rocky Helmet from the likes of Great Tusk and Landorus-T; on the other hand, Razor Shell can be used for its Defense drop alongside slightly higher Base Power. Aqua Jet rounds off Hisuian Samurott's moveset by providing ever-so-useful priority to clean up weakened teams with faster threats and either revenge kill or discourage Pokémon like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and offensive Great Tusk from coming in. Sucker Punch is a much stronger alternative and hits Water-resistant foes like Walking Wake and Dragapult, but it's less reliable due to poor interaction with status moves like Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Substitute. Mystic Water can be used boost Hisuian Samurott's damage output on its Water-type moves without the cost of its HP like Life Orb would; Heavy-Duty Boots, on the other hand, helps give Hisuian Samurott more longevity so that it gets more chances to spread hazards via Ceaseless Edge and wallbreak early-game. Tera Water serves a similar purpose to Mystic Water, being potentially useful to sweep a team or generally increase the damage of Aqua Jet and Aqua Cutter; on the other hand, Tera Dark significantly boosts Ceaseless Edge and Sucker Punch. Both Tera types can also have defensive impacts, like Tera Water allowing Hisuian Samurott to stomach a hit from Zamazenta or Iron Valiant and Tera Dark doing the same for Zapdos.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott is a great fit on bulky offenses and balances that appreciate its entry hazard stacking ability and wallbreaking prowess all condensed in one slot; more well-rounded team styles can afford giving Hisuian Samurott more turns to click Ceaseless Edge or apply raw offensive pressure between Swords Dance and Aqua Cutter. To aid in that, teammates that can help provide momentum are very welcome, such as U-turn users like Cinderace, Dragapult; Volt Switch users like Zapdos; and even Eject Pack users like Close Combat Great Tusk. Pokemon that appreciate their checks getting worn down by Spikes are also fantastic teammates; Dragapult and Gholdengo deserve a mention, as their most common check in Kingambit especially dislikes coming into Spikes if it's not holding an Air Balloon, but almost any wallbreaker strongly appreciates Hisuian Samurott's Spikes and offensive pressure, with examples including Kingambit, offensive Zapdos, and Walking Wake. Hisuian Samurott may have trouble with its work being undone by hazard removers like Great Tusk, Defog Corviknight, and Court Change Cinderace. Gholdengo is a good help with the first two, whereas for the latter, having a team with strong momentum options like the aforementioned U-turn, Volt Switch, and Eject Pack users as well as Pokemon that take advantage of pivot Cinderace like Heatran or Volcanion are welcome.</p> "

Knock Off removes valuable items from Pokemon that rely on them, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite as well as Leftovers from Corviknight and Toxapex. Sacred Sword is a great coverage move for Hisuian Samurott, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon such as Kingambit and opposing Hisuian Samurott. Tera Water boosts the power of Razor Shell, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon like Ursaluna and Great Tusk. On the other hand, Tera Dark boosts Ceaseless Edge and Knock Off, allowing Hisuian Samurott to OHKO Skeledirge.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott shines on various balance and offense teams, as it serves a unique role of being able to deal damage while also reliably setting Spikes. This allows said teams to punish switches and more easily wear down bulky archetypes. Gholdengo is a great partner for Hisuian Samurott due to pressuring faster offensive threats such as Sneasler and Iron Valiant, and thanks to its ability, it can block Defog attempts from Corviknight. Hisuian Samurott also has great type synergy with Gholdengo, with it being able to pressure Dark-types Gholdengo tends to struggle with like Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and opposing Hisuian Samurott. Heatran and Ting-Lu both make for good partners, since they can stack hazards alongside Hisuian Samurott while also checking Zapdos, which otherwise forces it out. In return, Hisuian Samurott can pressure Ground-types that Heatran and Ting-Lu both tend to struggle with, like Great Tusk and Ursaluna. Walls such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, Dondozo, and Corviknight can force Hisuian Samurott out, so it pairs well with offensive teammates that can beat them, like the aforementioned Gholdengo as well as Choice Specs Hoopa-U and Zapdos. Lastly, sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Dragonite, and Sneasler appreciate Hisuian Samurott laying down hazards and beating Pokemon they can struggle with, like Air Balloon Gholdengo.</p> "

        "description": "<p>The name of the game with Hisuian Samurott is finding as many opportunities as possible to use Ceaseless Edge in order to repeatedly set up Spikes. This set aims to leverage Hisuian Samurott's natural resistances by equipping an Assault Vest, allowing it to come in on Gholdengo, Heatran, and Kingambit lacking Low Kick and Tera Blast Fairy. Knock Off makes progress against teams otherwise unphased by Hisuian Samurott's offensive profile, removing valuable items from the likes of Zapdos, Dondozo, and Toxapex. Sacred Sword is an alternative that better rounds out Hisuian Samurott's neutral coverage while hitting Kingambit and opposing Hisuian Samurott. Hisuian Samurott is a great utilizer of priority moves due to its proficiency at weakening teams with entry hazards damage, and it has two options in Aqua Jet and Sucker Punch. Aqua Jet has better coverage against Fighting-types like Iron Valiant and Sneasler, while Sucker Punch trades in reliability for power and is a better option for revenge killing the likes of Choice-locked Dragapult. If electing to run Aqua Jet, Tera Water is ideal to boost its power as well as Razor Shell's. If running Sucker Punch, Tera Dark is the better choice, especially if Knock Off is also being used. On the flipside, Tera Steel is useful as a defensive Tera type for reversing the matchup against Moonblast from Enamorus and Iron Valiant and resisting Dragon-type moves from Dragapult. Tera Ghost is another option, stifling foes attempts at removing hazards via Rapid Spin, though this does make Hisuian Samurott vulnerable to Shadow Ball from Dragapult and Gholdengo, which it was previously able to come in on. 20 Special Defense EVs in combination with an Assault Vest ensures Hisuian Samurott takes a Moonblast from non-Choice Specs Iron Valiant or a Draco Meteor from Modest Choice Specs Dragapult from full HP.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott fits very well on balanced and bulky offensive teams that appreciate entry hazard stacking as well as role compression from it being able to take a few special hits thanks to its Assault Vest. Other Pokemon that fit on these sorts of offensive teams that also appreciate the opposing team being weakened by Spikes, such as Kingambit, Dragonite, and Sneasler are beneficial allies. Gholdengo specifically is a very good teammate, as it blocks both Rapid Spin and Defog and can take advantage of some of Hisuian Samurott's switch-ins like Amoonguss and Toxapex. Dragapult is also an option for spinblocking. It additionally is great at forcing switches, racking up hazard damage. VoltTurn support from Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Corviknight is a worthwhile consideration to give Hisuian Samurott more opportunities to throw off attacks. While Hisuian Samurott can come in once or twice on attacks from Pokemon like Gholdengo and Heatran, it's by no means a reliable answer. Ting-Lu and Tera Water Garganacl work well as primary answers to these threat while also forming a hazard stacking core alongside Hisuian Samurott. They can set up Stealth Rock while also greatly benefiting from its ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off.</p> "

In sun, Hisuian Lilligant can use its Grass-type STAB move Solar Blade without the drawbacks of the normal two-turn charge. Ice Spinner allows it to hit common checks that resist both of its STAB types such as Zapdos, Amoonguss, Dragapult, and Dragonite for super effective damage. Leftovers in particular works well with Victory Dance, as Hisuian Lilligant is able to heal from some of the damage it takes while it sets up on physical attackers. Life Orb is an option that helps Hisuian Lilligant overwhelm some targets with extra power like Walking Wake, OHKOing it with Close Combat after a Victory Dance. A Jolly nature allows it to Speed tie Unburden Adamant Sneasler in sun, while an Adamant nature provides extra power that may be necessary to overwhelm targets like Zapdos, Amoonguss, and Zamazenta. Tera Ghost allows Hisuian Lilligant to spinblock and threaten some of its best checks in Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge with Tera Blast. Tera Ghost also allows Hisuian Lilligant to block Extreme Speed from Dragonite, preventing revenge kills. Tera Fire with Tera Blast is also an option, giving Hisuian Lilligant a strong sun-boosted Fire-type STAB move for coverage to hit bulky targets like Amoonguss and Gholdengo hard. Another benefit of Tera Fire is an immunity to burn from Pokemon like Moltres and Cinderace. Hisuian Lilligant requires Torkoal as a partner, as Hisuian Lilligant requires sun support, which Torkoal is able to set up automatically with Drought. Hisuian Lilligant’s ability to weaken Water-types and opposing team structures makes Iron Moth a dangerous late-game sweeper in sun. Hisuian Lilligant is only able to afford to run one coverage move, which can leave it vulnerable to checks it cannot afford to run coverage for, such as Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, Amoonguss, and Moltres. Great Tusk, Sandy Shocks, and Walking Wake are all great teammates capable of handling some of the aforementioned checks. Great Tusk and Sandy Shocks threaten Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Moltres.

Not only are its coverage moves good, but it has STAB on a very spammable type with fantastic neutral coverage in OU, Ghost. An incredible ability in Illusion greatly improves its wallbreaking: it can disguise itself as another teammate to create mind games, scoring great damage if opponents guess wrong. Its unique typing blocks some revenge killing moves such as Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Ceruledge's Shadow Sneak, and Breloom's Mach Punch. Grass Knot is a great coverage option to OHKO Great Tusk and physically defensive Dondozo, potentially OHKO Garganacl, and 2HKO specially defensive Dondozo. Alternatively, Hyper Voice is a good STAB option, getting neutral coverage on most Pokemon that Shadow Ball cannot, and it ignores Hydreigon and Terastallized Skeledirge's Substitute. Flamethrower allows Hisuian Zoroark to 2HKO Corviknight and Amoonguss, as well as OHKOing Scizor. Alternatively, Focus Blast gives Hisuian Zoroark a way to catch incoming Kingambit off guard, and it hits Garganacl and Ting-Lu super effectively, which is very helpful if forgoing Grass Knot. With Trick, Hisuian Zoroark can cripple walls like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Garganacl, as well as bulky setup sweepers it cannot threaten immediately, like Tera Fairy Garganacl and Tera Fire or Tera Water Hatterene. However, giving away Choice Specs sacrifices some of the OHKOs and 2HKOs mentioned above. U-turn is a great alternative to bring teammates in safely on Assault Vest Azumarill and Ting-Lu. Tera Normal and Tera Ghost boost Hisuian Zoroark's already powerful STAB moves, with boosted Hyper Voice always OHKOing Great Tusk, while boosted Shadow Ball 2HKOes Assault Vest Azumarill. Tera Fighting is another good option, as it not only boosts Focus Blast, but it also turns Hisuian Zoroark's Dark weakness into a resistance, meaning it no longer fears Sucker Punch revenge killers.</p> <p>Hisuian Zoroark fits best on offensive teams. Great Tusk can set Stealth Rock, helping Hisuian Zoroark KO foes more easily, and check the Dark-types it struggles with such as Kingambit and specially defensive Ting-Lu. Pivots such as Rotom-W and Meowscarada can bring Hisuian Zoroark safely into Amoonguss and Corviknight, respectively. Rotom-W in particular is a great teammate, since it can also spread paralysis, crippling boosted sweepers and naturally fast Pokemon such as Dragonite, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult for Hisuian Zoroark to outspeed and KO. Hisuian Zoroark dislikes opposing hazards: not only does it get worn down easily, but opponents may see through its disguise based on the damage it takes from Stealth Rock. Hence, it appreciates hazard removal and prevention from the aforementioned Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Hatterene. Great Tusk and Corviknight can also come in and take a hit from Kingambit and Meowscarada, respectively, which can revenge kill Hisuian Zoroark. Corviknight in particular really appreciates Hisuian Zoroark threatening Gholdengo, which blocks its Defog. Specially defensive Pokemon like Assault Vest Azumarill and Clodsire can take a hit from Hisuian Zoroark, thus forcing it out, given its frailty. To threaten both of these checks, Choice Band Breloom is a great partner. In return, U-turn Hisuian Zoroark can bring Breloom in on these Pokemon. Lastly, setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Volcarona, and Iron Moth appreciate Hisuian Zoroark's ability to threaten their checks such as Garganacl, Dondozo, and Skeledirge, letting them clean up afterwards. Hisuian Zoroark can also disguise as them to lure in their checks and either KO them or cripple them with Trick. Hisuian Zoroark can disguise as Dragonite, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon to lure in physical walls such as Great Tusk and Dondozo, only for them to be OHKOed by Grass Knot. Similarly, Hisuian Zoroark can also disguise as Volcarona and Iron Moth to lure in Clodsire and Toxapex, using Trick to cripple them and open up a potential sweep.</p> "

Its ability, Illusion, provides good utility by letting it draw out an unsuspecting teammate's check and blasting them with powerful special attacks. Shadow Ball hits nearly everything in the tier for solid damage with very few drawbacks, and it has the lovely side effect of potentially dropping a foe's Special Defense. Grass Knot can be utilized to sink many heavy defensive threats, such as Garganacl, Great Tusk, and Dondozo. This also comes with the advantage of being a reliable move against heavy foes like Ting-Lu without burning up valuable PP on Focus Blast or dealing with its less-than-stellar accuracy. Flamethrower hammers would-be switch-ins like Kingambit and Scizor. Alternatively, Focus Blast can be used to hit Ting-Lu, Hydreigon, Kingambit, and Garganacl with the same move. Tera Ghost allows Shadow Ball to more reliably OHKO Gholdengo on Focus Sash sets, and it also allows +2 Shadow Ball to OHKO Volcarona, Walking Wake, Iron Moth, and Slowking. Alternatively, Tera Fighting turns its Dark-type weakness into a resistance, leaving it less susceptible to Kingambit's Sucker Punch, Meowscarada's Knock Off, and Greninja's Dark Pulse, and it powers up Focus Blast to staggering heights. Tera Fighting Focus Blast OHKOes Garganacl and even has a good chance to OHKO Ting-Lu at +2 after Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Tera Fairy allows Hisuian Zoroark to hold off Dark-types as well as become immune to Dragapult's Dragon-type attacks. Focus Sash guarantees that Hisuian Zoroark has a chance to set up or attack. On the other hand, Life Orb can be used to add further power to Hisuian Zoroark's already formidable prowess. Life Orb ensures that +2 Shadow Ball OHKOes Volcarona, physically defensive Rotom-W, and Corviknight after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Hisuian Zoroark functions best as a setup sweeper on hyper and bulky offense teams. Great Tusk is a top-class partner, providing Hisuian Zoroark invaluable utility with its excellent defenses and Rapid Spin, which keeps entry hazards off Hisuian Zoroark's side of the field and leaves its Focus Sash intact. It also provides Hisuian Zoroark more opportunities to come in and set up by threatening Pokemon that hold it down indefinitely, such as Clodsire. Dragapult and Meowscarada are faster than Hisuian Zoroark, so Pokemon that can come in and revenge kill them, such as Kingambit, are also appreciated. In return, Hisuian Zoroark can use Illusion to mask itself as Kingambit or Roaring Moon and lure in physical walls like defensive Great Tusk and Dondozo to weaken or KO them. Entry hazard setters like Glimmora, Meowscarada, and Garchomp set up hazards to chip down foes into Hisuan Zoroark's KO range, and it can stop an incoming Rapid Spin from Great Tusk in return. Hisuian Zoroark can force damage on special walls like Ting-Lu, which is highly appreciated by other special attackers like Iron Moth and Hydreigon, and vice versa. In particular, Hydreigon and Hisuian Zoroark can play Illusion mind games with Fighting-type moves, and Hydreigon can topple Clodsire with Earth Power and Substitute or Tera Steel.</p> "

Foul Play, on the other hand, gives Amoonguss a way to pressure Dragapult immediately while still punishing physical setup sweepers. Red Card phazes setup sweepers like Iron Valiant and Walking Wake. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet lets Amoonguss punish U-turn users like Meowscarada and Scizor, while Covert Cloak is a valid option to check Garganacl more easily. Tera Water Amoonguss checks Cinderace, while Tera Fire Amoonguss can use Clear Smog safely on Tera Fire Breloom at the cost of becoming weak to Ground-types like Great Tusk. Maximum HP investment with 84 Special Defense EVs prevents a 2HKO from Choice Specs Dragapult's Shadow Ball; the rest of the investment is poured in Defense to better check Great Tusk.</p> <p>Amoonguss is best utilized on balance teams that appreciate it taking a foe out of commission with Spore. Gholdengo and Dragapult greatly appreciate this as well as Amoonguss's ability to check Ting-Lu. Cinderace and Kingambit are other good offensive teammates that appreciate Amoonguss threatening Dondozo. Because Amoonguss relies mostly on Regenerator for its recovery, entry hazard removal in the form of Great Tusk or Iron Treads is key; Great Tusk also checks Cinderace, while Iron Treads can help deal with Gholdengo. Even though Amoonguss has the ability to check some setup sweepers with Clear Smog, it is best to pair it with an Unaware teammate like Skeledirge or Dondozo, which can handle Pokemon like Tera Flying Roaring Moon much more effectively. Pokemon like Dragonite and Choice Band Roaring Moon also make for good partners, as Amoonguss is one of the best Iron Valiant checks.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Alomomola is a defining aspect of stall teams, as its huge HP stat and unique combination of Wish and Regenerator let it keep itself healthy while repeatedly pivoting out to and healing teammates such as Dondozo, reducing their reliance on low-PP recovery moves and compensating for their lack of reliable recovery. Furthermore, its excellent typing and great physical bulk allow it to check threats like Cinderace and Dragonite and absorb Knock Off from common Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads, preserving its teammate's Heavy-Duty Boots. Whirlpool further enhances Alomomola's pivoting abilities, letting it trap switch-ins and pivot out to the appropriate answer while preventing their double switch. In conjunction with Protect, Whirlpool also racks up passive damage on offensive Pokemon and walls such as Rotom-W and Ting-Lu that lack reliable recovery. Protect also allows Alomomola to heal itself with Wish, scout the moves of powerful wallbreakers, and prevent them from forcing progress when paired with Future Sight. Chilling Water makes Alomomola a more self-sufficient physical wall, reducing its passivity against sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Ceruledge, and Bulk Up Great Tusk. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Alomomola to avoid entry hazard damage before getting struck by Knock Off, which is especially important against Toxic Spikes. Minimizing Alomomola's Speed allows it to underspeed Corviknight to hit the incoming switch-in from U-turn instead and thus, avoid wasting PP due to Pressure. Tera Flying improves Alomomola's matchup against Great Tusk and Meowscarada, turning it into an even better Knock Off absorber, and lets it wall Breloom. It also makes Alomomola immune to Spikes and allows it to take less passive damage from Salt Cure.</p> <p>Alomomola's Wish and ability to blanket check various threats benefit all of its teammates on stall teams. Toxapex is an exceptional partner that forms a strong Regenerator core with Alomomola. Together, they can stall Garganacl out of Salt Cure PP and pivot around strong physical attackers such as Breloom, Choice Band Dragapult, and Roaring Moon. Dondozo handles physical sweepers too powerful for Alomomola to deal with, such as Kingambit and Azumarill, and greatly appreciates Wish due to its lack of reliable recovery. Alomomola's low special bulk mandates sturdy specially defensive partners; Clodsire can take on special sweepers such as Gholdengo and Hydreigon that attempt to use Alomomola as setup fodder, while Blissey switches into the tier's most powerful special wallbreakers, such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Hisuian Zoroark. Ting-Lu checks special attackers like Dragapult and Iron Moth and, alongside Clodsire and Toxapex, sets entry hazards that can quickly wear down offensive teams to let Alomomola apply more pressure with Whirlpool. Like Dondozo, it also greatly appreciates Wish to reduce its reliance on Rest. Talonflame carries Defog to account for Alomomola's vulnerability to entry hazards after taking Knock Off. Corviknight can do the same as well as absorb Knock Off for Alomomola. In addition, Talonflame checks Breloom, while Corviknight checks Meowscarada, which lets Alomomola preserve its Terastallization. Lastly, Gholdengo checks Breloom and Iron Valiant, appreciates Alomomola dealing with Cinderace and Great Tusk, and provides stall with a setup sweeper to break down balance teams with Nasty Plot.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With Nasty Plot, well-rounded stats, great coverage, and rather decent Speed, Hydreigon makes for a great wallbreaker. Substitute allows it to set up Nasty Plot safely, avoid would-be detrimental threats such as Garganacl's Salt Cure and status from Toxapex, Clodsire, and Rotom-W, and take advantage of the switches it forces. For its fourth move, Hydreigon can utilize Earth Power to dent Pokemon that can comfortably take a Dark Pulse such as Kingambit, Toxapex, and Garganacl. Alternatively, Flash Cannon provides coverage against Fairy-types, being able to OHKO Iron Valiant and Hatterene after a Nasty Plot, as well as having good chance to 2HKO Tera Fairy Garganacl and Skeledirge unboosted if running Life Orb. Draco Meteor can also be used as a strong neutral coverage option to straight up OHKO Great Tusk and dent Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Amoonguss. With Tera Steel, Hydreigon acquires a better defensive typing, turning its weaknesses into resistances, improving its matchups against would-be threats like Dragonite, Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Roaring Moon. Tera Steel also boosts its Flash Cannon, able to OHKO Hatterene unboosted with Life Orb. Tera Poison can also be used to grant Hydreigon a Fighting resistance and more importantly, resisting both of Iron Valiant's STAB moves. Both Tera types also give Hydreigon the ability to switch into Toxapex and Clodsire safely due to their immunity to poison, and they both work well with Levitate, which provides an immunity against an otherwise super effective attack.</p> <p>Hydreigon best fits on various offense and balance teams. Rotom-W is a good teammate since it can spread paralysis against faster Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Dragapult and bring Hydreigon in safely on walls like Amoonguss and Toxapex via Volt Switch. Other defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Skeledirge make for good teammates since they can switch into Iron Valiant, Breloom, and Volcarona. Faster offensive Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Choice Specs Dragapult match up well against offensive teams that can overwhelm Hydreigon easily by KOing Pokemon like opposing Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark, respectively. In return, Hydreigon can overwhelm Pokemon that they typically struggle with such as Skeledirge and Kingambit. Entry hazards from the likes of Garganacl, Clodsire, and Glimmora are appreciated to wear down foes into Hydreigon's KO range; the former two Pokemon can also check Volcarona and Choice Specs Dragapult defensively, which would otherwise revenge kill Hydreigon easily—even if it's behind a Substitute—thanks to Bug Buzz and Infiltrator. If Hydreigon isn't running Earth Power, teammates that can deal with Kingambit such as Breloom and Great Tusk are appreciated; Great Tusk can also remove Stealth Rock so Hydreigon isn't worn down easily, especially if it's running Life Orb. The two of them can also handle Ting-Lu, which can otherwise wall Hydreigon and phaze it with Whirlwind. Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Dragonite appreciate Hydreigon threatening Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Dondozo for them to sweep more easily.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Landorus-T is an effective Choice Scarf user thanks to its high Attack stat and useful movepool. This, combined with its typing, natural bulk, and exceptional ability in Intimidate, makes it a good offensive pivot. U-turn is useful for generating momentum and bringing in teammates safely when the foe is forced to switch out. Stone Edge hits Flying-types such as Enamorus, Zapdos, Dragonite, and Moltres, notably providing good coverage alongside Earthquake. Grass Knot is crucial for hitting Great Tusk, which would otherwise comfortably take Landorus-T's physical attacks. It is also the best option for hitting Dondozo and Tera Water, Curse, or Iron Defense Garganacl. Tera Ground can be used to boost Landorus-T's already strong Earthquake, potentially helping it clean late-game when all Ground-immune foes have been removed. Tera Blast can be used alongside Tera Flying, as it still hits Great Tusk hard while also hitting Amoonguss and Zamazenta for super effective damage. It also guarantees an OHKO against Iron Valiant. Becoming pure Flying-type also lets Landorus-T potentially survive priority moves such as Aqua Jet from Hisuian Samurott in a pinch.</p> <p>Landorus-T fits well on balanced and bulky offense teams that appreciate speed control and the ability to generate momentum. Wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Enamorus appreciate being brought in safely with U-turn. Choice Specs Enamorus and Choice Specs Dragapult especially appreciate being in against certain Pokemon that commonly switch into Landorus-T, such as Great Tusk and defensive Zapdos. Offensive Zapdos can also take advantage of these Pokemon while forming a potent VoltTurn core with Landorus-T. Faster special attackers such as Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Enamorus are problematic for Landorus-T. Therefore, specially defensive Galarian Slowking is a solid teammate to help deal with them. It also consistently switches into Rotom-W, which takes very little from Landorus-T's attacks. Furthermore, Galarian Slowking forms a momentum-generating core with Landorus-T and provides Future Sight support, making Landorus-T more difficult for foes to switch into. Great Tusk forms a strong core alongside Landorus-T to deal with physical attackers such as Sneasler and Cinderace that tend to be overwhelming for one of them to take on alone. Notably, Landorus-T outspeeds Cinderace and can threaten it before getting burned by Will-O-Wisp.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Defensive Landorus-T is a reliable pivot on balance and bulky offensive teams, leveraging its good typing, bulk, and Intimidate to serve as a roadblock to common threats such as Kingambit, Sneasler, and Great Tusk without Ice Spinner. Its Spikes immunity and neutrality to Stealth Rock allow it to comfortably switch in and check the aforementioned Pokemon. Landorus-T is also an excellent Stealth Rock user thanks to its good matchups against key entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and Cinderace. U-turn enables Landorus-T to pivot out of bad matchups and safely bring one of its teammates in. The last slot is flexible depending on a team's needs. Grass Knot deals high damage to Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Tera Water Garganacl, which could otherwise switch in and set up on Landorus-T, and it is useful to open up for teammates such as Kingambit to reliably clean late-game. However, Grass Knot also leaves Landorus-T quite exploitable to key Flying-types and Tera Flying Pokemon such as Moltres, Dragonite, and Kingambit, which can either cripple it with status or setup on it. Taunt is a useful utility move to stop entry hazards from Ting-Lu and Great Tusk and to prevent Enamorus-T and Garganacl from setting up. Finally, Smack Down deals decent damage to Landorus-T's common Flying-type switch-ins as well as Rotom-W, either leaving them vulnerable to Earthquake or forcing them out. 4 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Jolly Kingambit and deal good damage to it with Earthquake. As Landorus-T is a support Pokemon, it will often be more valuable to use Terastallization with other teammates. However, Tera Water lets Landorus-T resist Ice- and Water-type moves from Pokemon such as Greninja, Alolan Ninetales, and Walking Wake. Alternatively, Tera Ghost can be run to spinblock against Great Tusk while still maintaining its positive matchup against Fighting-type moves. Rocky Helmet is the preferred item, as it forces valuable chip damage on key targets such as Sneasler, Great Tusk, and Kingambit. Leftovers can also be run to grant Landorus-T a bit more longevity. Landorus-T typically fits quite well on teams with multiple pivot move users such as Sneasler, Cinderace, and Zapdos, as they can continually apply pressure to each other's counters, especially if entry hazards are up. Zapdos and Rotom-W have the added benefit of having good matchups against Flying-types, which Landorus-T struggles with. Galarian Slowking matches up quite well against strong special attackers such as Zapdos and Enamorus and appreciates Landorus-T's ability to pivot into physical attackers such Great Tusk, Kingambit, and Swords Dance Iron Valiant. Spikes setters such as Ting-Lu and Hisuian Samurott form a potent hazard-stacking core with Landorus-T and can pressure entry hazard removers such as Cinderace and Great Tusk. Strong wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Choice Specs Iron Valiant, and Choice Band Hoopa greatly benefit from Landorus-T's U-turn support, as it can position them to fire off their powerful attacks with little risk and can wear the opposing Pokemon down over time to be in their KO range. Landorus-T is quite exploitable by fast Water-types such as Battle Bond Greninja and Walking Wake; bulky Water-types such as Toxapex can help alleviate the pressure from these Pokemon. Landorus-T's ability to lure and overwhelm physical walls such as Dondozo and Great Tusk with Grass Knot is greatly appreciated by various physical setup sweepers such as Kingambit, Swords Dance Iron Valiant, and Hisuian Samurott.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This more offensive set allows Landorus-T to take advantage of its varied movepool and high attacking stats to cause headaches to common teambuilding structures in SV OU while still retaining its usefulness as an Intimidate pivot; as such, Substitute is essential mostly to ease prediction, but it can also catch unsuspecting players trying to use a status move on Landorus-T, such as Moltres's Will-O-Wisp or Amoonguss's Spore. Smack Down is important to let Landorus-T threaten a KO on Corviknight, Rotom-W, Zapdos, Moltres, or even Enamorus the next turn with Earthquake, and even if the opponent switches out, Earthquake is likely to strongly dent their team, unless they're running more than one Pokemon immune to Ground. Stone Edge, on top of its great coverage with Earthquake, provides a more immediate hit on Zapdos, which is useful for more offensive variants that outpace Landorus-T, as these force Landorus-T to take damage before being able to KO Zapdos. Stone Edge also OHKOes Moltres and Enamorus, but it comes at the price of being unable to dent Corviknight or Rotom-W, which is undesirable. Grass Knot rounds out Landorus-T's coverage as a way to do massive damage to Great Tusk; Garganacl after Iron Defense, Curse, or Tera Water; and Dondozo. Tera Water allows Landorus-T to turn its Ice and Water weaknesses around and thus better check Ice Spinner Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott. A Naive nature is best alongside maximum Speed investment to make sure Landorus-T outpaces Great Tusk and most defensive Zapdos variants and Speed ties with other Landorus-T. 24 Special Attack EVs allow Landorus-T to 2HKO physically defensive Garganacl with Grass Knot if its Leftovers has been removed, but maximum Attack EVs can also be run instead.</p> <p>Substitute Landorus-T is commonly found on bulky offense and balance teams, bringing the gap between a wallbreaker and a bulky pivot. To aid its wallbreaking efforts, however, Landorus-T strongly appreciates Spikes support from the likes of Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu to help wear down its switch-ins, as Landorus-T commonly causes the opponent to switch around, and, most importantly, put Great Tusk in range of going down to a single Grass Knot. While Landorus-T has great coverage for most of the tier and is a strong wallbreaker against most balance and bulky offense teams, there are still a few Pokemon that it gives free switches to. Iron Defense Zamazenta doesn't take much from Landorus-T's Earthquake, especially with Dauntless Shield activated, and can use Landorus-T as setup fodder with Iron Defense. Physically defensive variants of Galarian Slowking, Moltres, and Zapdos help remedy this, and the former three also help bring Landorus-T for wallbreaking opportunities via Chilly Reception, Volt Switch, and U-turn. Calm Mind Cresselia is another dangerous setup sweeper that Landorus-T allows to come in for free. Kingambit and Encore Tera Dark or Steel Iron Valiant pose great answers to it while also appreciating Landorus-T spreading damage around for them to clean up, especially if an unsuspecting Great Tusk is taken out via Grass Knot. Great Tusk itself is also a great partner, as going with a more offensive set on Landorus-T makes it less reliable of a check to physical attackers, which Great Tusk helps handle; in return Great Tusk appreciates opposing Great Tusk being taken out via Grass Knot, making it easier for defensive variants to win the hazard game and offensive variants to sweep or dent the opposing team.</p> "

Since Choice Specs ensures it only uses one attack per switch-in, even though Protean only activates once per switch-in, Greninja will have STAB every time it attacks. Hydro Pump is Greninja's most powerful move, pummeling both offensive and defensive Water-weak Pokemon like Cinderace, Skeledirge, and Great Tusk. Dark Pulse hits the likes of Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Hisuian Zoroark super effectively while also dealing the most damage to Toxapex and Rotom-W. Dark Pulse's flinch chance can also come in clutch against the aforementioned walls. Ice Beam eviscerates Amoonguss, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Dragon-types like Dragonite and Roaring Moon. Grass Knot can OHKO Dondozo, Garganacl, and Walking Wake after minor chip damage, and it deals good damage to lighter Water-types like Quaquaval and Azumarill. Alternatively, Spikes lets Greninja wear down checks like Toxapex while taking advantage of the switches it often forces. In addition, Greninja also beats common entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Corviknight, making Spikes easy to maintain. Tera Water further enhances Greninja's already powerful Hydro Pump to extreme levels, letting it OHKO Pokemon like Corviknight, Hatterene, and Unaware Clodsire. Meanwhile, Tera Dark lets Greninja 2HKO Toxapex and Rotom-W with Dark Pulse.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja fits best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams as a menacing wallbreaker. Stealth Rock setters like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Glimmora are amazing for Spikes Greninja, as it can create a hazard-stacking core with them.

Strong offensive Pokemon like Kingambit and mixed Iron Valiant make for excellent partners, as Greninja threatens their checks like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Garchomp for the former, and Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and Clodsire for the latter.

It differentiates itself from Meowscarada due to its better matchup against other leads as well as entry hazard setters and removers such as Glimmora, Iron Treads, Garchomp, Toxic Spikes Iron Moth, and Court Change Cinderace. Taunt has various applications; it blocks Amoonguss's Spore, prevents entry hazards from the likes of Ting-Lu and leads like Glimmora and Iron Treads, stops Defog from Corviknight, and prevents setup from Pokemon Roaring Moon, Kingambit, and Tera Water Garganacl that attempt to exploit Greninja's relative passivity. Greninja can choose to run Toxic Spikes to punish offensive teams filled with setup sweepers like Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant better, but Ice Beam OHKOes Garchomp and dents Water-resistant Pokemon like Dragonite, Meowscarada, Dragapult, Tera Grass Glimmora, and Water Absorb Clodsire, especially if its Focus Sash is still intact for the former three. Focus Sash guarantees that Greninja can set at least one layer of entry hazards and works extremely well to safely put it into Torrent range, which allows Surf to OHKO Hisuian Zoroark and provides significant odds to OHKO Iron Valiant, one of the biggest threats to offense teams. Alternatively, Protean improves Ice Beam's damage and allows Greninja to block Volt Switch from Rotom-W, Iron Treads, and Sandy Shocks when using Spikes, maintaining offensive momentum. Tera Water boosts Greninja's Surf, notably netting the OHKO on specially defensive Garganacl and 2HKO on Tera Fairy Skeledirge with Torrent, as well as the 2HKO on Gholdengo and Corviknight after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Greninja is perfectly suited for hyper offense teams. Offensive teammates like Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon put further pressure on entry hazard removers such as Corviknight, Iron Treads, and Great Tusk to maintain Greninja's Spikes throughout the game and enjoy Spikes chipping down their checks like Garganacl, Clodsire, Amoonguss, and Dondozo. They also appreciate Spikes invalidating Focus Sash from Pokemon like Hisuian Zoroark, Ceruledge, and Meowscarada. Aside from possessing insane late-game potential themselves, Kingambit and Iron Moth particularly help against Meowscarada—one of the few leads that can easily beat Greninja—and Hatterene, which can freely switch into Greninja and reflect its Taunt and entry hazards with Magic Bounce, with Calm Mind variants using it as setup fodder as well. Kingambit in particular appreciates Greninja's tendency to faint early-game to accumulate Supreme Overlord boosts. Knock Off from Bulk Up Great Tusk and Swords Dance Iron Valiant can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from walls like Dondozo, Slowking, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge, making them susceptible to Greninja's Spikes. Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragon Dance Dragapult can spinblock the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch to keep Greninja's Spikes up; Gholdengo in particular does it exceptionally well by blocking Defog and Glimmora's Mortal Spin as well, and it has the added benefit of threatening Hatterene and crippling walls like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu with Choice item + Trick, making them more vulnerable to Greninja's entry hazards.</p> "

Zen Headbutt is a nice complementary STAB move, allowing Hoopa-U to smack prominent Fighting-types like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Iron Valiant that may try to switch in on a predicted Hyperspace Fury. Drain Punch hits Dark-types like Kingambit and Ting-Lu, while Gunk Shot offers coverage against Fairy-types like Enamorus and Azumarill, as well as Tera Fairy Moltres, Garganacl, Kingambit, and Baxcalibur. A Jolly nature allows Hoopa-U to outspeed Pokemon like Timid Heatran, Modest Gholdengo, and Timid Volcanion, while an Adamant nature allows Hoopa-U to hit even harder, 2HKOing Garganacl the majority of the time. Tera Dark boosts the power of Hyperspace Fury even further, 2HKOing physically defensive Dondozo; Tera Dark also offers the additional benefit of making Hoopa-U resist other Dark-type attacks, which can be crucial against Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Hoopa-U fits well on bulky offense teams that are in need of a physical wallbreaker. Physical setup sweepers like Kingambit, Baxcalibur, and Dragonite appreciate Hoopa-U's presence on a team, as Hoopa-U is able to break through or dent physically defensive Pokemon that could stand in their way, like Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Rotom-W. One of Hoopa-U's biggest challenges is safely getting on the field due to its frail physical defense and quadruple weakness to U-turn, so it pairs well with pivots such as Chilly Reception Galarian Slowking, U-turn Dragapult, and Volt Switch Zapdos. Hoopa-U is also held back by its middling Speed, which tends to exacerbate Hoopa-U's physical frailty, so it appreciates paralysis support from partners like Rotom-W and Substitute Dragapult. Static Zapdos is a particularly notable partner for Hoopa-U, because it is able to switch in and potentially paralyze faster Pokemon like Cinderace and Dragapult, rendering those Pokemon no longer threatening to Hoopa-U. Pokemon that can set entry hazards like Ting-Lu, Heatran, and Landorus-T help facilitate with Hoopa-U breaking through its switch-ins. Opposing physical Dark-types, such as Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, and Roaring Moon, typically force Hoopa-U out, especially after a Defense drop. For this reason, sturdy Dark-resistant teammates like Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Low Kick Kingambit synergize well with Hoopa-U, while those Pokemon also appreciate Hoopa-U punching holes in the opposing team's defensive backbone.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Hoopa-U is an incredibly threatening special wallbreaker, especially to slower and more defensive teams, that is able to OHKO the majority of the tier and 2HKO essentially every other relevant Pokemon. This is thanks to Hoopa-U's astronomically high Special Attack stat and potent dual STAB combination. Focus Blast rounds out its coverage, allowing Hoopa-U to hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Hisuian Samurott; Focus Blast also OHKOes specially defensive Heatran after entry hazard chip. Trick can be run in the fourth slot to cripple the few special walls that Hoopa-U is unable to reliably blast through, like Blissey, Scream Tail, and Alolan Muk, while also affording Hoopa-U the ability to switch moves, alleviating the need for prediction in exchange for less immediate power. Alternatively, Thunderbolt can be used instead as Hoopa-U's best option to hit Corviknight and Galarian Moltres while also providing a more reliable option than Focus Blast to OHKO Hisuian Samurott and Greninja. A Timid nature makes Hoopa-U faster than Pokemon like Timid Heatran, Modest Gholdengo, and Timid Volcanion, while a Modest nature gives Hoopa-U even more breaking power so that it is able to potentially 2HKO Blissey and Alolan Muk with Focus Blast after entry hazard damage. Tera Dark increases the power of Dark Pulse, giving it an opportunity to 2HKO Scream Tail and specially defensive Heatran while also threatening to OHKO Baxcalibur, bulky Cinderace, and defensive Landorus-T. Tera Dark also makes Hoopa-U resist Dark-type attacks, which can prevent Kingambit from answering it with Sucker Punch. Quick special attackers like Choice Specs Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus make good teammates, as they appreciate Hoopa-U's ability to break through even the bulkiest of specially defensive walls. One of Hoopa-U's biggest flaws is that its physical frailty and crippling 4x weakness to U-turn can make it difficult for it to safely be brought onto the field. As a result, Hoopa-U greatly benefits from being paired alongside pivots that can facilitate its entry, like Galarian Slowking with Chilly Reception; Landorus-T, Dragapult, and Sneasler with U-turn; and Rotom-W and Zapdos with Volt Switch. Paralysis support from Thunder Wave users like Rotom-W, Substitute Dragapult, and defensive Gholdengo can help alleviate Hoopa-U's lackluster Speed and make previously faster threats easy targets. Static Zapdos synergizes particularly well with Hoopa-U in this regard, since Zapdos can punish U-turns directed at Hoopa-U from faster Pokemon like Cinderace, Sneasler, and Meowscarada to potentially paralyze them. Hoopa-U also appreciates the inclusion of hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott, Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, and Heatran, allowing it to punch holes in defensive backbones more easily and damage the opposing team thanks to the switches it forces. Some of the most difficult Pokemon for Hoopa-U to handle are opposing Dark-types like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Ting-Lu, and Hisuian Samurott because they can force Hoopa-U to rely on Focus Blast and good prediction to break through. To help mitigate this issue, Pokemon that can reliably switch into Dark-types like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Azumarill also make good partners for Hoopa-U, and in return they appreciate Choice Specs Hoopa-U's ability to threaten physical walls as well. Bulk Up Great Tusk and Belly Drum Azumarill can also clean up late-game after Hoopa-U wears down the opposing team.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Equipping Hoopa-U with an Assault Vest makes the most of its excellent coverage and surprisingly high special bulk, letting it trade with various special attackers like Dragapult and Walking Wake. Strong Knock Off is a large reason to use this set, as it is an excellent progress maker, particularly against bulkier teams. Psychic is run over Zen Headbutt for its higher accuracy and better damage against physically defensive Pokemon like Zapdos and Great Tusk. Drain Punch provides Hoopa-U with adequate recovery and logevity, and it is largely used to hit Kingambit and other Dark-types, which otherwise walls this set. Gunk Shot provides important coverage for Fairy-types like Enamorus and Tera Fairy foes like Garganacl while potentially poisoning checks like Ting Lu. Tera Poison not only empowers its Gunk Shot but also gives it a crucial Fairy and U-turn resistance. 248 HP and 40 Defense investment with a Lonely Nature allows Hoopa-U to survive one Sucker Punch from Adamant Kingambit with a maximum Supreme Overlord boost and gives it an easier time against weaker physical attacks from Pokemon like Garganacl and Clodsire. Meanwhile, 84 SpA EVs give Hoopa-U a guaranteed OHKO on Iron Moth with Psychic and 92 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Jolly Kingambit. Hoopa-U is best utilized on bulky offense teams that can support a slow, powerful wallbreaker like it while still appreciating its ability to trade hits with common special attackers. It is incredibly physically frail, so pairing it with physically bulky Pokemon like Garganacl and Great Tusk is a good idea, as it will often be forced out by physical attackers. Additionally, pivot support from Cinderace and Zapdos can put Hoopa-U in favorable positions to dish out damage with its strong attacks, something that is necessary given its aforementioned physical frailty. Because Hoopa-U often makes great progress with Knock Off, entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T are great teammate options. Hoopa-U excels at punching holes in the opposition, so faster offensive teammates like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus are good ideas to take advantage of the resultant weakened foes. Teammates like Amoonguss and Galarian Slowking also deserve consideration for checking Iron Valiant and Enamorus without having to expend Terastallization.</p> "

Good coverage options as well as a powerful STAB move that can burn its foes make it very difficult to switch into. Earth Power is crucial for hitting Toxapex, which easily switches into both of Volcanion's STAB moves; it also hits Galarian Slowking harder, notably guaranteeing a 2HKO on physically defensive variants. Taunt is useful against bulkier Pokemon, preventing Dondozo or Toxapex from using healing moves and Galarian Slowking from using Thunder Wave. Substitute eases prediction, as Volcanion can force switches, and it takes advantage of certain Pokemon that fail to break the Substitute such as bulky Cinderace and non-Assault Vest Toxapex while still avoiding status attempts from the aforementioned walls. It also allows Volcanion to avoid Sucker Punch from Kingambit. Tera Blast alongside Tera Fairy can be used to hit Pokemon such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Hisuian Samurott. Becoming a Fairy-type offers useful defensive utility, giving it an immunity to both of Walking Wake's STAB moves and a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Tera Ground can be used to grant Volcanion an Electric immunity, improving its matching against Zapdows and Rotom-W, while also boosting Earth Power's damage. Both Tera types also neutralize its weakness to Earthquake from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Great Tusk. 140 Speed EVs are used to outspeed uninvested Great Tusk. Volcanion fits on bulky offense teams that appreciate a strong wallbreaker. Entry hazards, especially Spikes, make Volcanion much harder to deal with. Therefore, hazard setters including Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T make good partners. Ting-Lu can also switch into special attackers like Dragapult and Zapdos for Volcanion. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking cause problems for Volcanion, so teammates that can help overwhelm them such as Nasty Plot Gholdengo and Utility Dragapult are also useful. Finally, Swords Dance Iron Valiant and Kingambit can clean late-game once Volcanion has worn down the opposing team, and they also pressure the aforementioned specially defensive Pokemon. Kingambit in particular appreciates Volcanion's ability to deal with Fire-types like Cinderace and Moltres, and especially its immunity to Will-O-Wisp.</p> "

Steam Eruption is Volcanion's most spammable move and has very limited switch-ins, as many Pokemon that resist both of Volcanion's STAB moves like Dragapult, Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Hisuian Samurott end up getting 2HKOed or burned. Fire Blast is Volcanion's best move for Grass-types such as Meowscarada, Amoonguss, and Tera Grass Galarian Slowking. Earth Power helps immensely with Toxapex, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking. Sludge Bomb hits Azumarill and Tera Grass Heatran while crippling foes like Rotom-W more than burn, while Tera Blast Fairy can hit many Dragon types such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon as well as Pokemon like Assault Vest Hisuian Samurott. Tera Fairy also makes Volcanion immune to Dragon-type moves, negating both of Walking Wake's STAB types, and removes all of Volcanion's weaknesses, particularly to Ground-type attacks such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu and Landorus-T's Earthquake. Tera Fairy also allows Volcanion to resist Kingambit's Sucker Punch, making it a great revenge killing option. Tera Water and Tera Fire make Steam Eruption and Fire Blast even stronger, allowing Volcanion to muscle through Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and even 2HKO physically defensive Toxapex. Its main counters are Tera Water Galarian Slowking and Water Absorb or Tera Water Clodsire, alongside Blissey. Volcanion appreciates support from wallbreakers that can deal with these threats or wear them down, such as Black Glasses Kingambit and mixed Iron Valiant. Kingambit in particular loves Choice Specs Volcanion's matchup against Fire-types like Cinderace, Moltres, and Heatran. In turn, Kingambit has a good matchup versus the aforementioned counters and can help pressure other checks such as Toxapex. Dragapult can also be a great partner, as it provides pivoting and speed control along with adding pressure on said counters and checks and has the option to provide great support with Thunder Wave. Great Tusk is another great option, as it can provide hazard removal, which is crucial for Volcanion. It is also a great blanket check for physical attackers that threaten Volcanion, and it provides Knock Off support, making it one of the best defensive partners for Volcanion. Volcanion also fits great on VoltTurn teams, as it loves being brought in as many times as possible by Pokemon such as Cinderace, Dragapult, and Rotom-W.</p> "

It can switch into and counter Pokemon like Cinderace and Greninja, scout for Choice item users like Dragapult, Breloom, and Iron Valiant, and absorb Toxic Spikes from Glimmora and opposing Toxapex. Surf forces damage onto Toxic-immune foes such as Gholdengo, Garganacl, Iron Moth, and Kingambit. Toxic shuts down Pokemon such as Dragonite, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W, and if Toxapex should run Toxic Spikes, it matches up well against offensive teams that contain setup sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Great Tusk. Any attempts of boosting past Toxapex gets shut down easily by Haze, which combined with poison damage prevents Toxapex from being used as setup fodder by Pokemon such as Calm Mind Hatterene. Covert Cloak is an option to ignore Garganacl's Salt Cure, Dragapult and Gholdengo's Shadow Ball drops, and Greninja's Dark Pulse flinches, but Leftovers's longevity reduces Toxapex's reliance on Recover, and it is used over Black Sludge in case Toxapex decides to Terastallize. Tera Steel improves Toxapex's matchup against non-Earthquake Roaring Moon and Meowscarada while still maintaining an immunity to poison. Alternatively, Tera Fairy fares better against Dragapult, Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Choice Band Roaring Moon. The given EVs allow Toxapex to survive two Choice Band Meowscarada's Flower Trick from full health.</p> <p>Toxapex fits nicely on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate a sturdy defensive backbone. Teammates like Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl are terrific defensive partners that covers Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Tera Electric Iron Valiant, respectively. Corviknight and Great Tusk in particular provide a backup check to multiple combinations of physical attackers like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Kingambit that attempt to overwhelm Toxapex. They also remove entry hazards, which would mitigate Toxapex's Regenerator and force it to use Recover more often; in return, Toxapex covers Pokemon such as Cinderace for the former and Greninja for the latter. Bulky setup sweepers like Garganacl, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo can take advantage of Toxic Spikes slowly chipping down checks such as Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. Particularly, Skeledirge and Gholdengo can make use of Hex easily to take advantage of Toxapex spreading poison, as well as threaten Hatterene, which can block Toxapex's Toxic Spikes and use non-Haze variants as setup fodder. Offensive partners like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit compensate for Toxapex's overall passivity; in return, they appreciate Toxapex switching into their revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo, Scizor, and Iron Valiant, respectively.</p> "

Surf does a solid chunk of damage to common Toxapex switch-ins like Kingambit, physically defensive Corviknight, and Gholdengo and often 2HKOes Garganacl after Stealth Rock. Sludge Bomb has good coverage alongside it, dealing heavy damage to Fairy-types like Iron Valiant, Hatterene, and Azumarill while breaking Hydreigon's Substitute. Sludge Bomb's high chance to poison can be critical for crippling Rotom-W and Slowking in the long term. Infestation provides a nice source of chip damage while letting Toxapex trap and beat defensive threats, such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Clodsire, in conjunction with Acid Spray. Furthermore, Infestation prevents the opponent from double switching on Toxapex, enabling much safer plays. Instead of Acid Spray, Ice Beam works to offer more immediate damage against Clodsire, Dragonite, Dragapult, and Amoonguss. Tera Blast, with Tera Fighting, is also viable to nab surprise KOs on Kingambit and Roaring Moon, which might otherwise set up on it. However, Fairy is the most standard Tera type for Toxapex, allowing it to block Dragon-type attacks from Dragapult and Walking Wake.</p> <p>Toxapex fits best on balance and bulky teams that appreciate its unique combination of bulk and power. Assault Vest Toxapex likes to pivot around aggressively and spread chip damage, thanks in part to Regenerator: entry hazard setters like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu can help it pressure opposing teams more, punishing opponents for switching out against it. Without either Haze or Toxic, Toxapex is vulnerable to setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Roaring Moon, so Unaware Pokemon such as Dondozo and Skeledirge are excellent teammates. Since Assault Vest Toxapex's physical bulk is rather lacking, physically defensive Pokemon like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Corviknight can offer much-needed switch-ins to the likes of Kingambit and Choice Band Roaring Moon. Toxapex can often struggle to make progress against bulkier teams due to its middling power and lack of Toxic, so it appreciates strong balance wallbreakers like Iron Valiant. Hydreigon deserves special mention as an excellent teammate, sharing near-perfect type synergy with Toxapex. Hydreigon checks key threats to Toxapex such as Armarouge, Kingambit, and Nasty Plot Gholdengo, and it can set up on bulkier Pokemon like defensive Great Tusk and Clodsire. In return, Toxapex can check Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Greninja, which can threaten Hydreigon. Finally, Scream Tail is also a great partner, using Wish to extend Toxapex's longevity and having solid defensive synergy with it.</p> "

Access to moves like U-turn, Knock Off, and Taunt further allows it to enable the setup sweepers on its team. Knock Off removes Leftovers from Pokemon like Heatran and Corviknight, as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Zapdos, Galarian Slowking, and Moltres, making them easier to beat with entry hazards up. It also prevents Ghost-types such as Gholdengo and Dragapult from coming in for free. U-turn allows Rillaboom to pivot out after setting up Grassy Terrain into a teammate who benefits from it. Drain Punch can be used alongside the passive healing of Grassy Terrain to keep Rillaboom healthy throughout the game. It's also crucial for hitting Kingambit while ensuring Heatran can't easily take advantage of Rillaboom. Taunt prevents defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking and Corviknight from using healing moves, and it also stops the former from using Chilly Reception and the latter from using Defog, and prevents Pokemon like Ting-Lu and defensive Landorus-T from setting hazards. Wood Hammer is an alternative STAB move that can be used to hit harder at the cost of longevity; for instance, it nets the OHKO against offensive Great Tusk, specially defensive Garganacl, and physically defensive Rotom-W. Terrain Extender is used to allow Rillaboom and its teammates to benefit from Grassy Terrain for longer, but Eject Button is another option that allows Rillaboom to immediately switch into a teammate after getting hit without wasting a turn of Grassy Terrain. Rillaboom will almost never Terastallize, as a teammate will almost always benefit more from it. In rare cases, Tera Fairy or Steel can provide key resistances, allowing Rillaboom to act as an emergency check to Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Enamorus. 52 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Kingambit and uninvested Landorus-T, allowing Rillaboom to hit the former with Drain Punch, as long as it's out of Sucker Punch KO range, and get a hit off or use Taunt on the latter to prevent Stealth Rock from going up. Rillaboom fits on hyper offense teams that benefit from Grassy Terrain, especially with teammates holding a Grassy Seed. Sneasler and Hawlucha are powerful setup sweepers that benefit from the Defense and Speed boost they get from Grassy Seed and Unburden. Sneasler in particular benefits from Earthquake damage being decreased in Grassy Terrain, giving it better odds against Pokemon like Landorus-T and Great Tusk without Headlong Rush. Bulky Calm Mind sweepers such as Hatterene and Enamorus-T can use the Defense boost from Grassy Seed to become even more difficult to KO as they start setting up, with the former also appreciating the passive recovery from Grassy Terrain to somewhat make up for the lack of Leftovers. Hazard setters such as Hisuian Samurott and Great Tusk benefit from Rillaboom's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off and assist the aforementioned sweepers. Kingambit is another great Pokemon that fits on hyper offense and benefits from Rillaboom and its teammates wearing down the opposition. It also greatly benefits from Grassy Terrain providing extra longevity and weakening Earthquake.</p> "

Pyro Ball is its most reliable move, as it can hit hard while preserving Libero. Sucker Punch gives Cinderace a means to hit faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Dragapult super effectively. Alternatively, Gunk Shot can be run to OHKO Iron Valiant and Hatterene while preserving the team's ability to Terastallize. Court Change is an extremely useful move, as it can provide hazard control that is unaffected by Gholdengo's Good as Gold while also stealing Light Screen and Reflect from hyper offensive teams; however, Cinderace can choose to run High Jump Kick instead to hit Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Ting-Lu harder as well as inflicting more damage against Pokemon that resist Pyro Ball like Garchomp and Garganacl. Tera Fire is the Tera type that Cinderace wants to utilize in order to maximize Pyro Ball's damage, giving it the ability to, with an Adamant nature, OHKO Corviknight after Stealth Rock. It also helps Cinderace hit bulkier targets like Hatterene and offensive Great Tusk, especially if it isn't running Gunk Shot or High Jump Kick. A Jolly nature is preferred to augment Cinderace's role as a fast pivot, allowing it to outspeed Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Iron Treads. However, an Adamant nature can be run instead to increase its damage output.</p> <p>Cinderace works best on balance and bulky offense teams, providing utility and entry hazard control while simultaneously exerting offensive pressure.

Ground-types that provide entry hazard support such as Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu make it easier for Cinderace to check threats with Stealth Rock and Spikes, especially if it is running an Adamant nature. Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Iron Valiant pair well with Cinderace, as they can eradicate foes that wall it such as Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Rotom-W. Similarly, Dragonite and Kingambit can check Pokemon such as Hatterene and Skeledirge, which can both cause issues for Cinderace.

Cinderace can force out important offensive threats like Gholdengo and Iron Valiant with the threat of STAB Pyro Ball while keeping up momentum against defensive switch-ins with U-turn. Will-O-Wisp allows Cinderace to cripple physical attackers such as Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Great Tusk, and it can also negate Leftovers for defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu. Specifically, Will-O-Wisp offers a safe way for Cinderace to check Kingambit, since it avoids Sucker Punch mindgames. Finally, Court Change offers unmatched utility in providing entry hazard control that cannot be blocked by Gholdengo and is also able to steal opposing dual screens. The 32 Attack EVs guarantee a KO on Gholdengo sets lacking defensive investment and 2HKO on physically defensive Corviknight after Leftovers. Although this set rarely wants to Terastallize, Tera Fire can potentially come in handy for securing KOs with Pyro Ball, especially with a Blaze boost. Alternatively, Tera Flying grants Cinderace an immunity to Ground-type attacks, such as Great Tusk's Earthquake, which can grant it extra opportunities to KO foes or cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. Tera Flying also matches up well against common Ground-type hazard setters such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, letting Cinderace safely Court Change against them.</p> <p>Cinderace works best on bulkier teams where its ability to guarantee hazard removal shines. Defensive Pokemon such as Dondozo, Slowking, Toxapex, and Amoonguss are great teammates, as they appreciate Cinderace's ability to ensure hazard removal, freeing them up to run items other than Heavy-Duty Boots. Water-types such as Dondozo and Toxapex have notably strong synergy with Cinderace; Dondozo checks Great Tusk and Tera Fire Kingambit, while Toxapex can check Water-types, such as Walking Wake and Greninja. Hazard-weak breakers such as Iron Moth and Choice Band Dragonite also fit well with Cinderace, as it's able to bring them in with U-turn. These breakers also enjoy bulky Water-types like Toxapex or Dondozo being burnt, making it easier to overwhelm them long-term. Cinderace usually requires the presence of another hazard control Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Hatterene, or Corviknight so it doesn't get overwhelmed. Corviknight synergizes especially well with Cinderace thanks to its Ground immunity and ability to absorb Knock Off from Meowscarada, which outspeeds Cinderace. Skeledirge and Dragapult can take advantage of bulky Cinderace, since both completely wall it and can potentially set up a Substitute. Kingambit is a great partner, as it can offensively check both Skeledirge and Dragapult. In return, it appreciates Cinderace burning Great Tusk and Ting-Lu, opening up the way for it to sweep.</p> "

Tera Water serves as an emergency check to dangerous Fire- and Water-types such as Cinderace and Floatzel. Alternatively, Tera Fighting grants it a resistance to Dark-type attacks and powers up its Body Press, letting it check Kingambit more easily.</p> <p>Corviknight is a fantastic slow pivot, making it a great partner for frail-but-powerful teammates like Greninja and Iron Valiant. It is also one of the few viable Defoggers, allowing it to partner up with teammates like Dragonite that loathe Stealth Rock. Be warned, Corviknight is utterly unable to Defog against Gholdengo, so secondary entry hazard removal like Great Tusk and a reliable switch-in like Ting-Lu are recommended. Corviknight is unable to handle powerful physical Fire-types like Cinderace and Ceruledge and Electric-types like Iron Hands. Teammates that can cover these weaknesses like Dondozo and Great Tusk are wonderful partners. Its middling special bulk makes teammates like Slowking and Ting-Lu valuable. Slowking has the added benefit of being another slow pivot as well, while Ting-Lu forms a strong entry hazard core with Corviknight and threatens Gholdengo.</p> "

Its Ghost typing also blocks common priority attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Breloom's Mach Punch, which allows it to sweep even when Psychic Terrain is not active. Though it is resisted by Steel-types, a Psychic Terrain-boosted Stored Power can still heavily damage even Corviknight, 2HKOing physically defensive variants after just one Shell Smash. Shadow Ball is a consistent STAB move with excellent neutral coverage to hit most Steel- and Psychic-types hard, OHKOing Gholdengo and Hatterene. Tera Blast with Tera Fighting fills a gap in Polteageist's coverage, eliminating Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Kingambit while Psychic Terrain is active, and Hydreigon. Tera Fighting can also let it survive their Dark-type attacks. Weak Armor alongside a Focus Sash allows Polteageist to punish a stray physical attack, further boosting its Speed—it can outspeed +1 foes like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth—and Stored Power's damage. Focus Sash also lets Polteageist set up against threats that would otherwise outpace it or survive an attack and OHKO it, such as Kingambit, Choice Specs Dragapult, and offensive Great Tusk. A Timid nature is run to outpace +1 Walking Wake after a single Shell Smash.</p> <p>Polteageist is a staple on Psychic Terrain offense teams. Indeedee's Psychic Terrain protects Polteageist against priority attacks from Kingambit, Azumarill, and Floatzel while powering up its Stored Power, though Polteageist requires both a Shell Smash and a Weak Armor boost to outpace Swift Swim Floatzel. Indeedee can also let Polteageist set up with Encore or give it a second chance to sweep with Healing Wish, although if Polteageist has already consumed its Focus Sash, it will struggle to set up as reliably a second time. Armarouge is an excellent teammate and another staple on Psychic Terrain teams, as it can eliminate Steel-types like Kingambit with Armor Cannon to enable Polteageist's late-game sweep and it can use Endure to activate Weak Armor multiple times against Dragon Darts Dragapult, which Polteageist cannot reliably set up against. In return, Polteageist can greatly weaken or outright eliminate Unaware walls, set up against specially offensive Dragapult if its Focus Sash is intact, and can safely utilize Tera Fighting to eliminate Roaring Moon and wear down Ting-Lu, which allows Armarouge to sweep. Entry hazard removal is extremely important to maintain Focus Sash's protection. Eject Pack Great Tusk provides both Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock support, can safely get Polteageist in after using a strong Headlong Rush or Close Combat, and can also switch into and threaten Dark-types for Polteageist. Magic Bounce Hatterene deters entry hazards, spreads paralysis with Nuzzle, and can provide Healing Wish support. Also, Eject Button lets it safely pivot Polteageist in, even against U-Turns from Corviknight, Cinderace, or Meowscarada, giving it much easier setup opportunities. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragapult appreciate Polteageist breaking past Unaware walls and wearing down Steel-types. In return, Dragapult can use its multi-hit attacks to threaten opposing Psychic Terrain teams.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Hatterene is an excellent option on balance teams to deny entry hazards from being set up. With Magic Bounce, it can switch into and reflect entry hazards from Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Blissey. From there, it can begin setting up Calm Mind to pose a greater threat itself and overwhelm the opponent's defensive answers to it. Draining Kiss acts as pseudo-recovery and can help Hatterene heal off damage it's taken from Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk. Psyshock allows Hatterene to deal high damage to special walls such as Blissey and Clodsire and win potential setup wars against other Hatterene. Stored Power fulfills a similar role to Psyshock in enabling Hatterene to break through special walls and other Calm Mind users and can also help Hatterene defeat various Unaware Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Dondozo, but it requires Hatterene to set up multiple Calm Minds before it becomes truly potent. Mystical Fire deals high damage to many of Hatterene's common switch-ins such as Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Kingambit and has the nice bonus of lowering the target's Special Attack, which is particularly useful against Gholdengo that aren't running Covert Cloak. Nuzzle is another option to cripple switch-ins with paralysis, which can act as useful speed control for Hatterene's teammates. Substitute is another alternative that allows Hatterene to more easily set up in the face of weak hits such as Garganacl's Salt Cure and Clodsire's Earthquake. Tera Water nullifies all of Hatterene's weaknesses, which can grant it more opportunities to use Calm Mind against its checks such as Gholdengo, while Tera Fire can similarly neutralize all of Hatterene's weaknesses and comes with additional benefits such as boosting the damage of its Mystical Fire and letting it check Iron Valiant better. However, Tera Fire also comes with notable downsides, namely giving Hatterene a weakness to Ground-type moves and Stealth Rock, which can hinder its matchups against common entry hazard setters. The EV spread allows Hatterene to move reliably switch into physical attacks from common entry hazard setters while also outspeeding Toxapex and Garganacl.</p> <p>Hatterene's ability to discourage the use of entry hazards will be appreciated by almost any team. Pokemon vulnerable to entry hazards and those that frequently pivot in and out of battle such as Meowscarada, Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Dragapult enjoy Hatterene's support. Entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Corviknight are also good partners, as Hatterene's presence can ease the burden placed on them to remove entry hazards and grants the team greater flexibility in dealing with entry hazard setters. Furthermore, while Hatterene can switch into entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, it can be worn down quickly from their repeated Ground-type attacks. Great Tusk and Corviknight can reduce Hatterene's need to switch in as often by acting as alternative switch-ins. Due to relying on Leftovers and Draining Kiss for recovery, Hatterene can struggle to stay healthy, particularly if it loses its Leftovers to Knock Off or is hit by Salt Cure, so it is recommended to have teammates that can switch into these moves. Corviknight can switch into Knock Off from hazard setters such as Meowscarada and Great Tusk, while Covert Cloak Gholdengo can neutralize Salt Cure. Pokemon holding Rocky Helmet such as Corviknight can be troublesome for Hatterene, as they will wear Hatterene down when it uses Nuzzle or Draining Kiss. Covert Cloak users, especially Gholdengo, are similarly irritating for Hatterene due to nullifying the secondary effect of its Nuzzle or Mystical Fire. Knock Off support from Meowscarada, Great Tusk, and Iron Valiant is thus appreciated to remove these items from the opponent's Pokemon. Hatterene's weakness to Steel- and Ghost-type attacks can be exploited by strong attackers such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Kingambit. Kingambit and Tera Water Garganacl can reliably switch into Gholdengo and Dragapult, while Great Tusk and Dondozo can counter Kingambit.</p> "

Healing Wish trades Hatterene in exchange for fully healing one of its teammates, allowing wallbreakers such as Kingambit and Roaring Moon to effectively weaken the opposing team twice; Healing Wish has the added benefit of providing teammates with a free switch in and thus maximizing the turns field conditions such as Psychic Terrain, sun, and dual screens are active. Psychic and Dazzling Gleam are STAB moves that let Hatterene remain threatening against hazard setters such as Toxapex, Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Garchomp. Nuzzle punishes setup sweepers such as Dragonite that would otherwise set up in front of Hatterene. Alternatively, Mystical Fire lets Hatterene punish Steel-types such as Kingambit and Gholdengo that try to switch into it. Eject Button lets Hatterene sponge hits for its teammates and brings an offensive Pokemon safely onto the field. The Speed EVs allow Hatterene to outspeed Ting-Lu and paralyzed Adamant Dragonite, while the rest of its EVs are dedicated to its bulk. Tera Steel removes all of Hatterene's weaknesses which can, in turn, allow it to use Healing Wish in front of Pokemon that would otherwise directly threaten it such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Glimmora.</p> <p>Healing Wish Hatterene finds a place on hyper offense, sun, and Psychic Terrain teams, which all enjoy Hatterene's ability to stop entry hazards from going up and breaking Focus Sash and severely chipping Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock while also keeping momentum thanks to Eject Button. As such, Pokemon usually seen on these archetypes like Dragonite, Ceruledge, Iron Moth, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake, as well as Focus Sash users such as Breloom, Armarouge, and Polteageist, enjoy the presence of Hatterene. Offensive pivots such as Roaring Moon and Cinderace invite in defensive walls like Dondozo and Toxapex, against which Hatterene can use Healing Wish safely. Great Tusk can act as a secondary entry hazard control alongside Hatterene, preventing the latter from getting overwhelmed by repeating hits from entry hazards users like Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and opposing Great Tusk. Said support is particularly useful on sun teams as keeping Stealth Rock off the field allows for Torkoal to remain healthy and thus set up sun repeated timed throughout the game.</p> "

Dazzling Gleam is good coverage that allows Indeedee-M to hit Dark-types like Roaring Moon and Hydreigon. Encore can punish foes by locking them into undesirable moves, such as Recover for Garganacl and Skeledirge, as well as preventing dangerous setup sweepers, such as Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant, and Substitute users, such as Hydreigon and Dragapult, from setting up. It can also lock foes into moves that Indeedee-M's teammates resist, allowing them to be used as setup fodder. Healing Wish sacrifices Indeedee-M in exchange for fully healing a teammate, which facilitates wallbreakers such as Armarouge, Volcarona, and Polteageist further weakening the opposing team. Additionally, Healing Wish provides a teammate a free switch-in, maximizing the number of turns in which they can take advantage of Psychic Terrain. Tera Fairy boosts the power of Dazzling Gleam, allowing Indeedee-M to OHKO Roaring Moon, Greninja, Meowscarada, and Dragapult after Stealth Rock damage. Tera Fairy also allows Indeedee-M to use Healing Wish in front of Pokemon where it wouldn't usually be able to do so, such as Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, and Bug Buzz Volcarona, though it is almost always better to Terastallize a teammate instead, as Indeedee-M's immunity to Ghost-type attacks eases the matchup against Pokemon that are otherwise very threatening to Psychic Terrain teams, such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult.</p> <p>Indeedee-M is mandatory on Psychic Terrain teams. As such, teammates that effectively utilize the power boost to Psychic-type moves and enjoy the immunity to priority Psychic Terrain provides are good partners. Therefore, teammates such as Armarouge, Polteageist, and Volcarona are good partners that appreciate the power boost to Expanding Force, Stored Power, and Psychic, respectively. In particular, the Psychic Terrain boost allows +1 Tera Psychic Volcarona to OHKO Assault Vest Toxapex after Stealth Rock damage, demonstrating the potency wallbreakers have when Psychic Terrain is up. Additionally, teammates that provide entry hazard control are also good partners, as they allow Indeedee-M to set Psychic Terrain repeatedly throughout the game and keep the team's wallbreakers healthy. Therefore, Eject Pack Great Tusk and Eject Button Hatterene are good partners, as they do this while conserving momentum, providing opportunities for the team's wallbreakers.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its blistering Speed stat letting it outrun the entirety of the unboosted metagame as well as a decent defensive typing, Dragapult makes for an excellent dual screens setter and an enabler of potent offensive threats. Curse serves to both put a timer on bulkier threats and enable Dragapult to bring in a more dangerous teammate safely by causing itself to faint. Dragon Darts can be used to give Dragapult some offensive presence, providing chip damage against non-Fairy-types. Alternatively, U-turn can bring in Dragapult's teammates after dual screens have been set up without it needing to KO itself while also letting it come back later to set them again. Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp can be used in the last slot in order to cripple faster threats or physical attackers to enable teammates to set up, but it leaves Dragapult passive and vulnerable to Taunt. Cursed Body is used to potentially punish Pokemon that attack Dragapult while it sets up dual screens, lending Dragapult's teammates an opportunity to set up. Terastallizing Dragapult is rarely recommended in order to let more offensive teammates Terastallize and to avoid Terastallization removing Curse's damaging effect, but Steel can enable Dragapult to take a hit from Enamorus's Moonblast in order to set up dual screens in a pinch. Tera Fairy gives Dragapult an immunity to other Dragapult's Dragon moves as well as an important resistance to Knock Off from the likes of physical Iron Valiant and Meowscarada. Dual screens Dragapult should only be used on hyper offense teams. Setup sweepers such as Azumarill, Kingambit, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant appreciate the extra bulk afforded by dual screens, giving them more setup opportunities and preventing them from easily being revenge killed. Azumarill also threatens offensive Cinderace, punishing it for stealing its team's dual screens with Court Change. Iron Defense Zamazenta is another great teammate, as dual screens boosts its already good bulk to absurd levels. It also appreciates Dragapult's ability to wear down Pokemon such as Zapdos with Curse. Corviknight is an annoyance for Dragapult due to its resistance to Dragon Darts as well as its ability to remove Dragapult's dual screens with Defog. As a result, Dragapult appreciates Pokemon that can threaten it and prevent it from Defogging, such as Iron Moth and Gholdengo.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Possessing OU's highest unboosted Speed tier makes Choice Specs Dragapult a very remarkable special wallbreaker, revenge killer, and offensive pivot. It outspeeds and threatens common offensive threats like Cinderace, Iron Moth, and even boosted foes like Adamant Dragonite after a Dragon Dance. Moreover, it's immune or resistant to common priority attacks like the aforementioned Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Breloom's Mach Punch, and Slither Wing's First Impression, which makes it much harder to revenge kill. It is also able to switch into and check Rotom-W. A coverage move in either Flamethrower or Thunder lets Dragapult nail Corviknight, with the former also hitting other Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads, while the latter pressures Toxapex and Tera Water Garganacl. A Timid nature allows Dragapult to outspeed Adamant Dragonite after a Dragon Dance and Speed ties opposing Dragapult, while a Modest nature can be used for extra wallbreaking power. Infiltrator allows Dragapult to bypass Grimmsnarl's dual screens and Substitute users like Gholdengo, which gives it an edge against hyper offense teams. Tera Ghost maintains an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and strengthens Shadow Ball—its most spammable attack—notably guaranteeing the 2HKO on Corviknight and Assault Vest Iron Treads after Terastallizing. Tera Fairy prevents Dragapult from being picked off by opposing Dragapult and Sucker Punch from Kingambit and Meowscarada. Finally, Tera Dragon turns Draco Meteor into an even more powerful nuke. This takes advantage of the lack of prominent bulky Steel- and Fairy-types in the metagame, notably chunking answers to Ghost-types like Purifying Salt Garganacl and Ting-Lu and 2HKOing Unaware Clodsire.</p> <p>Choice Specs Dragapult fits perfectly on bulky offense and VoltTurn teams. Physical wallbreakers like Great Tusk appreciate Dragapult's U-turn bringing them in safely, and they are able to pressure its switch-ins like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, Blissey, and Garganacl. Entry hazard removers like Corviknight and Great Tusk allow Dragapult to pivot throughout the game unperturbed; the former can also pivot it in safely via U-turn, letting it threaten Gholdengo, which tends to switch into Corviknight to block its Defog. Furthermore, Corviknight and Great Tusk provide the necessary defensive backbone to switch into boosted threats such as Roaring Moon, as well as revenge kill attempts from Sucker Punch users like Kingambit. Gholdengo forms a Ghost spam core with Dragapult, as it can overwhelm a shared check in Ting-Lu, use non-Calm Mind Blissey as setup fodder, and either cripple Tera Water Garganacl with Trick or straight up dent Tera Fairy variants. Entry hazards from Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Garganacl can quickly put foes into Dragapult's KO range, especially as it tends to force a lot of switches; in return, Dragapult spinblocks foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch. Setup sweepers like Iron Valiant appreciate Dragapult wallbreaking early-game for them to clean up late-game easily.</p> "

The choice for the second move depends on what Tera type Dragapult chooses. Tera Dragon Dragapult uses Phantom Force for a Ghost-type STAB move, but Tera Ghost uses Tera Blast, since, unlike Phantom Force, it is not a two-turn move. Sucker Punch allows Dragapult to revenge kill weakened sweepers such as opposing Dragapult, as well as Iron Moth and Tera Flying Roaring Moon after some chip damage. However, be careful when using Sucker Punch, since opponents can predict it and set up. An Adamant nature gives Dragapult extra wallbreaking power. Alternatively, a Jolly nature allows Dragapult to outspeed the entirety of the unboosted metagame. With Tera Dragon, Dragapult's Dragon Darts becomes harder to switch into; it 2HKOes walls Dragapult normally struggles with such as Ting-Lu. Tera Dragon Dragapult is also less susceptible to Sucker Punch, albeit at the cost of losing its immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Iron Valiant is a fantastic partner, since it's able to check Dark-types such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu. Hazard removal from Pokemon like Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for good partners, since Dragapult's lack of longevity makes it difficult to switch in when hazards are up. Great Tusk and Corviknight are able to beat both Scizor and opposing Great Tusk, while Cinderace can threaten bulky Steel-types such as Corviknight. Dragapult benefits from entry hazards from the likes of Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl, since it can more effectively wallbreak with entry hazards up. Other pivots such as Scizor and Rotom-W appreciate that Dragapult's U-turn can bring them in. In return, Scizor can revenge kill Ice-types such as Naxcalibur, while Rotom-W can check both Corviknight and defensive Great Tusk. Paralysis support from Rotom-W can shutdown offensive Pokemon like opposing Dragapult and Roaring Moon. Lastly, Gholdengo makes for a good teammate, since it can spinblock and deny Defog and can help Dragapult overwhelm shared checks like Kingambit and Ting-Lu.</p> "

Dragapult's unmatched Speed tier, in conjunction with STAB Dragon Darts, allows it to snipe key offensive threats such as Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Cinderace with some prior chip damage. This often means that Dragapult will force a lot of switches, which can be capitalized on with Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave to spread status and power up Hex. Both status moves also allow Dragapult to avoid Sucker Punch, which can come in handy against Cinderace, Kingambit, and Meowscarada. With a burn and Stealth Rock up, Hex 2HKOes defensive Corviknight, Amoonguss, and Dondozo, allowing Dragapult to pick apart balanced cores. However, paralyzing its foes allow Dragapult to fish for more free turns to set up Substitute. Substitute improves Dragapult's matchup against Sucker Punch users and avoids status and Salt Cure damage. 76 Attack EVs ensure an OHKO on Roaring Moon with Dragon Darts. Tera Fairy grants it a Dark resistance and Dragon immunity against Pokemon like Kingambit, Walking Wake, and opposing Dragapult, the latter of which could otherwise risk the Speed tie and bypass its Substitute due to Infiltrator. In a pinch however, Terastallization can also be used defensively to avoid other super effective hits, like Iron Valiant's Moonblast.</p> <p>Because of the amount of utility it provides, Dragapult appreciates plentiful chip damage from its teammates, as it lacks immediate power. All forms of entry hazards are greatly appreciated due to Dragapult's ability to force out the opponent, so entry hazard setters like Garganacl, Great Tusk, Glimmora and Ting-Lu form good teammates. Stealth Rock is particularly important since it secures important 2HKOs with Hex. Among the entry hazard setters, Garganacl has fantastic synergy with Dragapult, as it is able to set up Stealth Rock while also chipping down foes with Salt Cure. Partners that can spread status such as Rotom-W and Skeledirge are also excellent teammates. Since Ting-Lu and Garganacl stonewall this set, teammates that scare them out such as Offensive Great Tusk and Banded Meowscarada are great partners. Tera Flying Covert Cloak Gholdengo forms a particularly potent Ghost spam core with Dragapult, as it can turn common counters to Dragapult such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Garganacl into setup fodder. Physical sweepers like Kingambit appreciate having their counters like Corviknight and Great Tusk crippled with burns and have solid type synergy with Dragapult. Due to this set being most potent mid- and late-game, it's more at home in teams with solid defensive backbones that can sponge hits. Defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Hatterene, Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Amoonguss can all soak damage for Dragapult from common checks like Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Kingambit while setting up entry hazards, spreading status, or dealing chip damage, allowing Dragapult to clean up late-game.</p> "

Besides hitting most Pokemon in the tier neutrally, Dragon Darts can also break past Focus Sash holders like Ceruledge and Breloom, as well as Dragonite's Multiscale. Pairing it with Phantom Force, or Ghost- or Fairy-type Tera Blast, gives nearly perfect neutral coverage. Substitute stops Sucker Punch from revenge killing Dragapult, blocks status from Pokemon like Rotom-W, and blocks Salt Cure residual damage. Since Dragapult forces many switches, it can find many opportunities to use Substitute and then use Dragon Dance once. With Tera Dragon, its Dragon Darts becomes even harder to switch to, 2HKOing walls like Ting-Lu, Toxapex, Garganacl, and Amoonguss after one Dragon Dance. Tera Ghost grants Dragapult a more reliable Ghost-type STAB move in Ghost-type Tera Blast; unlike Phantom Force, cores like Hatterrne + Roaring Moon can't play around it. Also, Tera Blast does not make contact, improving Dragapult's matchup against Rocky Helmet users such as Corviknight. However, Phantom Force lets Dragapult gain extra longevity from Leftovers. Tera Fairy grants Dragapult an immunity to Dragon, improving its matchups against opposing Dragon-types such as Roaring Moon, Walking Wake, and opposing Dragapult, and it also changes Dragapult's Dark weakness into a resistance, so it no longer fears Sucker Punch. An Adamant nature is standard, but a Jolly nature allows Dragapult to Speed tie opposing positive-nature Dragapult and outspeed +1 Adamant Dragonite.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Dragapult best fits on offense teams, where other offensive Pokemon can help it sweep more easily late-game. Also, they enjoy Dragapult forcing switches due to its Speed. Fighting-types such as Iron Valiant and Breloom can punch holes early- and mid-game for Dragapult to sweep, as well as checking Dark-types like Kingambit and Ting-Lu, which can cause Dragapult trouble. Iron Valiant also appreciates Dragapult checking Psychic-types that can give it trouble such as Hatterene. Ting-Lu and Great Tusk can set entry hazards for Dragapult and check opposing Dark-types. Dragapult dislikes Unaware Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Dondozo, since they can ignore its Dragon Dance boosts and force it out. Hence, wallbreakers that can check them such as Gholdengo are welcome. Lastly, Dragapult tends to struggle against Pokemon that contest its Dragon Dance with a Defense-boosting move, such as Bulk Up Corviknight, Bulk Up Great Tusk, and Curse Garganacl. Therefore, Pokemon like Ceruledge and Skeledirge to cover Corviknight, Rotom-W to cover Great Tusk, and Covert Cloak Gholdengo to cover Garganacl make for good partners. In return, Dragapult can set up on and check Pokemon they can struggle with, such as Roaring Moon and Walking Wake.</p> "

Zamazenta's potency as a wallbreaker is further amplified by its bulk, which allows it to either trade with revenge killers such as Choice Specs Dragapult and Booster Energy Iron Valiant from full, if needed, or soft check opposing Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott, especially when Dauntless Shield is active, subsequently granting it multiple wallbreaking opportunities. Zamazenta's Crunch allows it to hit and at least 2HKO checks such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Galarian Slowking. With Heavy Slam, Zamazenta OHKOes Enamorus and Iron Valiant and 2HKOes Tera Fairy Toxapex. Stone Edge affords Zamazenta the ability to 2HKO Zapdos, notably avoiding Static in doing so, while also 2HKOing Skeledirge; alternatively, Wild Charge can be used to 2HKO Toxapex. Tera Fighting boosts the power of Close Combat and accentuates Zamazenta's wallbreaking power, notably allowing it to blow past some bulkier Zapdos variants without requiring prediction in addition to 2HKOing Dondozo most of the time.</p> <p>Zamazenta is well-suited as a wallbreaker on bulky offense teams. Consequently, Galarian Slowking is a very good teammate, as it provides Future Sight support, which heavily pressures otherwise solid checks such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, and Dondozo, allowing Zamazenta to break past its checks more easily. Additionally, Galarian Slowking provides a means of dealing with common counterplay to Zamazenta such as Zapdos, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant, as well as supplying Zamazenta with opportunities to come in through Chilly Reception. Other pivots such as Landorus-T and Zapdos are good partners too, as through their respective pivot moves, they also provide Zamazenta chances to safely come in and weaken the opposing team. Zamazenta is often worn down by hazards, as well as having to check threats such as Kingambit early on; solid checks to these which provide a means of hazard removal, like Corviknight and Great Tusk, respectively, are good partners. Kingambit is a strong teammate, as it appreciates the wallbreaking Zamazenta does earlier on to facilitate Kingambit's ability to clean late-game. Kingambit also appreciates the speed control Zamazenta provides, aiding Kingambit in revenge killing its offensive checks such as non-Choice Scarf Enamorus, non-Booster Energy Iron Valiant, and offensive Great Tusk. In return, Kingambit checks foes that take advantage of Zamazenta being locked into Close Combat, such as Gholdengo and Dragapult. Likewise, other cleaners such as Choice Scarf Enamorus and Booster Energy Iron Valiant also appreciate Zamazenta's weakening of the opposing team. In particular, Choice Scarf Enamorus provides Healing Wish support, affording Zamazenta a second chance at wearing down the opponent's team.</p> "

        "description": "<p>An amazing Defense stat combined with a fantastic Speed tier and access to STAB Body Press makes Zamazenta a potent late-game cleaner, especially in conjunction with Iron Defense and potentially Dauntless Shield. Crunch is used to prevent Zamazenta from being walled by Ghost-types such as Gholdengo and Dragapult. The last moveslot is fairly versatile; Substitute makes setting up multiple Iron Defenses easier and protects Zamazenta from status, while Heavy Slam hits Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant and Enamorus for high damage. Rest can also be used in conjunction with a Lum Berry to offer a one-time reprieve from Zamazenta's lack of recovery. 168 Speed EVs let Zamazenta outrun Adamant Dragonite after a single Dragon Dance and neutral-natured Dragapult. Maximum HP EVs are used in order to maximize overall bulk, which lets it survive Moonblast from Choice Scarf Enamorus and Tera Dragon Dragapult's Draco Meteor. Leftovers's passive recovery makes Zamazenta even harder to KO and is vital for its longevity due to its lack of healing moves. It also synergizes excellently with Substitute. Tera Steel gives Zamazenta a fantastic defensive typing, letting it soak up Fairy-type attacks from the likes of Hatterene and Iron Valiant before retaliating with a STAB-boosted Heavy Slam. Tera Electric is another solid defensive option that lets it beat Zapdos, giving it an immunity to paralysis and a resistance to both of its STAB attacks. Lastly, Tera Fairy, in conjuction with Heavy Slam, gives it an advantage over other Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. Tera Fairy also enables it to better check physical Dragapult, preventing even the special variants of it from revenge killing it reliably even when behind a Substitute due to Infiltrator.</p> <p>Zamazenta fits well on offensive teams, including hyper and bulky offense. Galarian Slowking makes for a great partner due to its ability to sponge hits from the Fairy-types Zamazenta despises, mainly Iron Valiant. It also provides offensive support with Future Sight and makes it easy for Zamazenta to get in with Chilly Reception. Other pivots, such as Landorus-T and defensive Zapdos, are appreciated so that Zamazenta can get in safely; the latter is especially useful for absorbing Flying-type moves and punishing Pokemon such as Sneasler and physical Iron Valiant with Static, negating any potential Speed boosts via Unburden or Booster Energy and enabling Zamazenta to revenge kill them. Due to Zamazenta preferring Leftovers, it is easily worn down by entry hazards. Great Tusk and Corviknight both provide hazard control, with the former also being able to set its own hazards to wear down the opposing team and the latter providing excellent defensive synergy, checking Fairy-types such as Choice-locked Enamorus. Wallbreakers that can muscle through Zamazenta's checks and weaken the opposing team are appreciated. Choice Scarf Enamorus provides speed control against Dragapult and has a favorable matchup against Iron Valiant, and Choice Specs Gholdengo helps cripple physically bulky Pokemon such as Dondozo with a combination of its sheer power and Trick. On hyper offense teams, Curse Dragapult is a great screens setter due to its high Speed stat and ability to set up on more passive threats as well as get Zamazenta in safely with U-turn or by causing itself to faint with Curse.</p> "

After Flame Orb activates, Facade 2HKOes even Pokemon as physically bulky as Dondozo and OHKOes physically defensive Great Tusk after a Swords Dance while letting Ursaluna act as a status absorber. Headlong Rush is generally preferred for its higher power, but Earthquake is another good option that avoids Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet damage and lets Ursaluna leverage its good bulk. Fire Punch hits Corviknight, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Air Balloon Kingambit, which resist Ursaluna's STAB combination. Tera Normal boosts Facade to breathtaking levels, allowing it to cleanly 2HKO physically defensive Corviknight after Stealth Rock. Tera Ghost is an alternative that lets Ursaluna avoid being revenge killed by Fighting-type attacks such as Close Combat from Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, or Sneasler. The given EV spread maximizes Ursaluna's damage output while also ensuring it outspeeds Skeledirge and standard Corviknight. On Trick Room teams, Ursaluna should run maximum Attack and HP investment, a Brave nature, and 0 Speed IVs.</p> <p>Ursaluna serves as an exceptionally powerful wallbreaker on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Garchomp is appreciated to make Ursaluna even more difficult to wall. Dual screens support from Dragapult can also be considered, since it will further reinforce Ursaluna's excellent bulk, and Dragapult can even provide free switches through Curse or U-turn. Against slower-paced teams, Ursaluna's great bulk and immunity to status give it many opportunities to switch in and start wreaking havoc, but it can struggle against faster-paced, more aggressive teams. Good partners for Ursaluna that excel against offense include Kingambit, Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Zamazenta, which, in return, appreciate Ursaluna breaking through Pokemon such as Dondozo and Corviknight. Ursaluna enjoys U-turn or Volt Switch support from Rotom-W, Landorus-T, or Dragapult, letting it hit the field multiple times to fire off its insanely powerful attacks. Galarian Slowking is another great teammate for Ursaluna, as it can both provide momentum with Chilly Reception and supplement Ursaluna's firepower with Future Sight. Galarian Slowking can also switch into and pressure some of the Pokemon that give Ursaluna trouble, such as Iron Valiant. Trick Room support from Hatterene and Cresselia is an interesting option to turn Ursaluna's low Speed into an advantage.</p> "

Under rain, Wave Crash applies immense pressure even to Water-resistant Pokemon such as Dragapult and Rotom-W. Aqua Jet proves particularly valuable against swifter foes like +1 Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Enamorus. Head Smash always 2HKOes Dragonite and OHKOes Volcanion, the latter of which can otherwise come in freely thanks to Water Absorb. Psychic Fangs targets key threats such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, and especially Water Absorb Clodsire while also strengthening Basculegion-M's matchup against screens. Liquidation serves as a viable alternative to Head Smash or Psychic Fangs, as it spares Basculegion-M the recoil damage from Wave Crash, enabling it to consistently inflict damage at the cost of some power. Tera Water boosts its Water-type attacks further; for instance, allowing Basculegion-M to OHKO Kingambit and Greninja with Wave Crash while avoiding the OHKO from the former's Sucker Punch. It also lets Basculegion-M take on other Ghost- and Dark-type attacks in a pinch, including from Pokemon like Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Hisuian Samurott. Basculegion-M seamlessly fits into rain teams, making Pelipper an indispensable partner for setting up rain and facilitating free switches via U-turn. The synergy between Basculegion-M and rain sweepers like Battle Bond Greninja, Zapdos, and Walking Wake is truly remarkable, as they can apply immense pressure and overwhelm their shared checks with their rain-boosted attacks. Zapdos proves invaluable for taking on Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Meowscarada, and Rillaboom as well as Water-types like Dondozo, Tera Water Garganacl, Toxapex, and Azumarill. It also grants Basculegion-M switches with Volt Switch and U-turn against Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Heatran, which get devastated by Wave Crash. Entry hazard support from teammates such as Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Iron Treads significantly augments Basculegion-M's ability to dismantle defensive threats like Galarian Slowking, Tera Fairy Garganacl, and Amoonguss. In return, Basculegion-M serves as a proficient spinblocker, threatening opponents like Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Ting-Lu in particular stands out as an exceptional partner, capable of taking hits from Electric-types such as Zapdos and Sandy Shocks and Ghost-types like Dragapult and Gholdengo. Kingambit similarly excels at soaking up Ghost-type attacks while benefiting immensely from Basculegion-M's wallbreaking and ability to exploit Great Tusk, which can enable Kingambit to sweep late-game.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Sneasler can take advantage of its unmatched Speed tier after Unburden and its wide coverage to be a dangerous and unpredictable sweeper. Dire Claw can ease setup or secure a sweep by inflicting checks such as Landorus-T, Skeledirge, and Toxapex with sleep or paralysis in a pinch. On the other hand, Gunk Shot is far more powerful, OHKOing Zapdos and Amoonguss after Swords Dance while avoiding the former's Static. Acrobatics, alongside Tera Flying, allows Sneasler to OHKO Great Tusk after Swords Dance and gives it setup opportunities against other Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Iron Treads. Shadow Claw and Lash Out both retain huge damage on Gholdengo in particular and make Sneasler less reliant on Terastallizing to hit it. The choice between the two largely comes down to Tera type; Tera Ghost grants Sneasler an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Great Tusk's Rapid Spin, while Tera Dark makes it immune to Future Sight and retains its Sucker Punch resistance after Terastallizing. Tera Dark Lash Out is also Sneasler's best chance at breaking through Tera Ghost Garganacl. Alternatively, Tera Blast Ground allows Sneasler to hit Skeledirge and OHKO Toxapex, defensive Gholdengo, and Galarian Slowking after Swords Dance. Grassy Seed activates Unburden on Grassy Terrain, and the Defense boost allows Sneasler to set up in front of physical attackers such as Kingambit and Ogerpon-W. An Air Balloon lets Sneasler set up freely against Ground-types such as defensive Great Tusk and Ting-Lu lacking Whirlwind. White Herb is an alternative that allows Sneasler to activate Unburden itself by using Close Combat instead of being reliant on taking a hit and popping Air Balloon to sweep.</p> <p>Sneasler is at home on hyper offense teams that can wear down opposing defensive cores for it to sweep late-game. Rillaboom is a mandatory partner if Sneasler is running Grassy Seed, as it provides the valuable Grassy Terrain. Alolan Ninetales, Grimmsnarl, and Dragapult are excellent teammates for their ability to set dual screens, which ease Sneasler's setup tremendously, especially if it is running Air Balloon and needs to take a hit in order to sweep. Glimmora and Hisuian Samurott are excellent leads that can provide valuable entry hazard support; Hisuian Samurott in particular can threaten many of Sneasler's checks, such as Great Tusk, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo. Other setup sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Kingambit, and Cresselia are good partners that can break through defensive cores for Sneasler or end games if it falls short of a sweep. Zamazenta is particularly valuable in this role, as it benefits immensely from Sneasler's ability to lure and break through shared checks such as Toxapex, Gholdengo, and Zapdos.</p> "

Dire Claw having no downsides thanks to Protective Pads allows Sneasler to spam it, making it hard to switch into for fear of potential status. Fake Out + U-turn can heavily chip down a foe. Fake Out can also be used for revenge killing foes such as Iron Valiant, Greninja, and Meowscarada. It also completely shuts down Focus Sash leads like Hisuian Samurott, which can be KOed by Fake Out + Close Combat before it can set up Spikes. Shadow Claw or Lash Out can be run over Fake Out, allowing Sneasler to hit checks like Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking, but that would limit Sneasler's ability to disrupt opposing teams with Fake Out and U-turn's poison chances and revenge kill faster targets like Booster Energy Iron Valiant. Sneasler takes advantage of its Protective Pads, allowing it to attack freely without any adverse side effects, preventing status or chip damage from Zapdos, Moltres, Garchomp, and miscellaneous Rocky Helmet users like Corviknight and Landorus-T. Tera Fighting is used for maximum Close Combat damage, letting it 2HKO even Corviknight. Sneasler works well on hazard-stacking teams that appreciate it spreading status and forcing switches, racking up even more damage. Sneasler struggles against Amoonguss, Toxapex, Galarian Slowking, and Dragapult, so good teammates to cover these would be Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Ting-Lu. Kingambit greatly appreciates the chip damage and status Sneasler provides, which helps it grab those OHKOs that it normally couldn't, and it can consistently switch into Dragapult and Galarian Slowking to set up on them. Ting-Lu is able to wall Dragapult and Galarian Slowking with its typing and enormous bulk while being able to set up hazards for further chip. Garganacl is another example of a bulky partner, as its Stealth Rock and Salt Cure damage pair well with Sneasler's status and chip damage.</p> "

A strong offensive STAB combination of Close Combat and Dire Claw allows Sneasler to threaten bulky Pokemon such as Garganacl, Ting-Lu, Heatran, and Hatterene. Dire Claw is noteworthy, as it has a good chance to cripple its checks such as Landorus-T and Galarian Slowking with status. U-turn not only allows Sneasler to pivot out of its checks, but it can also poison foes with Poison Touch, allowing its teammates to get easier KOs. Shadow Claw or Lash Out allows Sneasler to deal great damage to Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and Galarian Slowking. Tera Fighting further boosts Close Combat's power, allowing it to guarantee 2HKOs against walls it would normally struggle with such as defensive Great Tusk and Dondozo. Sneasler is best utilized on offensive teams, where it can use its wallbreaking abilities to enable sweeps from its teammates. In addition, sweepers and cleaners such as Dragonite, Choice Scarf Enamorus, Swords Dance Iron Valiant, and Kingambit all appreciate Sneasler wearing down their checks with poison or crippling them with paralysis or sleep to give its teammates setup opportunities. Entry hazard support from the likes of Hisuian Samurott and Landorus-T are appreciated, as their hazards wear down incoming foes for Sneasler to wallbreak more easily. For example, Sneasler can OHKO offensive Volcanion and fully defensive Enamorus-T with Close Combat and Dire Claw, respectively, after Stealth Rock damage. Sneasler struggles to break through certain defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Toxapex. Hence, it appreciates Pokemon that can wear them down such as Bulk Up or Ice Spinner Great Tusk and Choice Specs Walking Wake, respectively. Lastly, Sneasler doesn't want to attack Zapdos or Moltres in fear of triggering Static and Flame Body, respectively. Therefore, it appreciates teammates that can offensively check them such as Choice Specs Dragapult.</p> "

This impressive Speed tier in combination with a high Attack stat and great choices for STAB moves in Close Combat and Dire Claw make Sneasler an effective revenge killer. Sneasler is very good at spreading status via the combination of Poison Touch, Dire Claw, and U-turn, enabling it to wear down its own checks that are vulnerable to poison, like Great Tusk, Dragapult, Zapdos, and Skeledirge. Switcheroo hinders defensive Pokemon like Corviknight, Dondozo, and especially Poison-types that are both unbothered by Sneasler's STAB attacks and immune to poison, such as Galarian Slowking, Amoonguss, and Toxapex. It also frees up Sneasler to change moves, which is desirable in matchups against defensive teams where Sneasler is already fast enough without its Choice Scarf. Shadow Claw and Lash Out fulfil the same role, being used as Sneasler's best option to hit Dragapult, Galarian Slowking, and Gholdengo. Shadow Claw has better neutral coverage, as it isn't resisted by Fairy-types and Fighting-types like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Zamazenta; however, there is nothing immune to Lash Out, making it slightly better at spreading status through Poison Touch. Tera Fighting's boost to Close Combat can help Sneasler sweep late-game while also specifically achieving an OHKO on offensive Cinderace as well as a 2HKO on offensive Great Tusk.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Sneasler performs best on offensive teams that benefit from its ability to revenge kill a plethora of threats. Sneasler's ability to spread status on the likes of Great Tusk, Zapdos, and Landorus-T can be very beneficial to Pokemon that share these checks, like Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Great Tusk itself. It is able to support these Pokemon further by presenting them with opportunities to switch in via U-turn. This can be even further leveraged by pairing Sneasler with other U-turn and Volt Switch users like Cinderace and Zapdos. Spikes and Stealth Rock from the likes of Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Hisuian Samurott helps to soften up Sneasler's checks for it to potentially sweep late-game. Ting-Lu additionally is able to switch in on Ghost-types that cause Sneasler trouble like Dragapult and Gholdengo. Defensive Poison-types like Galarian Slowking and Amoonguss are a thorn in Sneasler's side, as they cannot be poisoned and take little damage from Sneasler's STAB attacks. Pokemon able to exploit them like Gholdengo and Heatran are necessary, and they greatly appreciate being brought into these threats by U-turn to boot.</p> "

Earth Power synergizes amazingly well with Moonblast, hitting Steel-types such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Heatran. It also targets the likes of Galarian Slowking, Iron Moth, Toxapex, and Volcanion. Mystical Fire hits Pokemon like Air Balloon Gholdengo and Corviknight that would otherwise resist Moonblast and be immune to Earth Power while outright OHKOing Scizor. Psychic operates as a middle ground between Earth Power and Mystical Fire against most Poison-types, having a chance to OHKO Amoonguss after Stealth Rock and catching Tera Poison Cresselia off-guard. It is also Enamorus's strongest attack against Moltres. Tera Fairy boosts Enamous's Moonblast to absolutely horrifying levels, 2HKOing even Pokemon that resist Fairy like Gholdengo, bulky Cinderace, and Scizor. Tera Ground turns Enamorus's weaknesses to Rock and Electric into a resistance and immunity, making it less threatened by Stealth Rock damage and letting it find opportunities to switch in against the likes of Zapdos and Sandy Shocks. It also boosts Earth Power, letting it OHKO Garganacl and Toxapex. Tera Steel bolsters Enamorus's defensive profile, making it less vulnerable to Poison-types like Galarian Slowking, Amoonguss, and Toxapex while also preventing it being revenge killed by moves like Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Choice Specs Enamorus is a solid pick on hyper offense and bulky offense teams as a monstrous wallbreaker, tearing apart common bulky Pokemon like Great Tusk, Dondozo, Garganacl, and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard support from the likes of Hisuian Samurott, Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Heatran help ease prediction for Enamorus, chipping Pokemon like Air Balloon Gholdengo, Amoonguss, and Scizor that could otherwise play around it. Hazard control from the likes of Great Tusk, Hatterene, and Corviknight is essential for giving Enamorus more opportunities to switch in. Late-game cleaners and sweepers such as Kingambit, Swords Dance Sneasler, Battle Bond Greninja, and Calm Mind Cresselia appreciate Enamorus breaking through and overwhelming Pokemon like Ting-Lu, bulky Gholdengo, Toxapex, and Skeledirge, enabling them to clean in the late-game.

Offensive pivots like Dragapult and Cinderace create offensive momentum for Enamorus to capitalize off of, baiting Dark- and Ground-type moves that Enamorus can safely switch into. Slower pivots like Galarian Slowking and Rotom-W can let Enamorus switch in without taking any damage, further boosting momentum.</p> "

Earth Power lets Enamorus threaten Pokemon that resist Moonblast such as Galarian Slowking, Cinderace, Toxapex, Iron Moth, Heatran, and Clodsire. Enamorus can complement its coverage with Mystical Fire, which allows it to hit Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo. Substitute is another option that lets Enamorus take advantage of the switches it forces and thus find more room to set up. Substitute also protects it from status conditions such as Amoonguss's Spore and Toxapex and Clodsire's Toxic. Agility is another alternative that lets Enamorus outspeed and thus threaten fast offensive Pokemon that would otherwise try to revenge kill it such as Cinderace, Zamazenta, and Dragapult. Timid is the preferred nature, as it lets Enamorus outspeed the likes of Zapdos, Sandy Shocks, and Garchomp, while Modest is usually seen alongside Agility. Heavy-Duty Boots removes Enamorus's weakness to Stealth Rock, letting it come into the field safely throughout the game. Leftovers grants Enamorus recovery and is usually used with Substitute to slowly heal and potentially set up more Substitutes. Life Orb is a more offensive option that increases Enamorus's damage output, letting it secure OHKOs against Choice Band Hoopa-U and even neutral targets such as Zapdos after one Calm Mind. Cute Charm is used over Contrary, as the latter conflicts with Calm Mind, and the former can potentially infatuate opposing male Pokemon, granting Enamorus free turns to set up. Tera Fairy makes Enamorus's Moonblast nearly unwallable, as even resistances such as Corviknight are potentially 2HKOed after one Calm Mind. Tera Ground, on the other hand, boosts Enamorus's Earth Power and turns its weakness to Poison into a resistance, which lets it deny revenge killing attempts from Sneasler and Iron Moth and turns soft checks such as Galarian Slowking into setup fodder. Tera Steel is yet another alternative that improves Enamorus's matchup against Poison-types, particularly Amoonguss, and lets it deny revenge killing attempts from Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Enamorus fits better on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Entry hazard setters that fit on these playstyles, such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Glimmora, and Hisuian Samurott, can slowly chip at the opposing team, making it easier for Enamorus to clean up late-game. Enamorus, in turn, denies opportunities for opposing Great Tusk to come in and remove the hazards away with Rapid Spin thanks to its higher Speed and resistance to both of Great Tusk's STAB moves. Its good matchup against Great Tusk, as well as Zamazenta and Dondozo, makes Enamorus a great Kingambit teammate, as it can cover Kingambit's would-be checks. Kingambit, in return, can help against Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking, which can be troublesome for Enamorus. Choice Specs Dragapult can weaken soft checks that can shrug off one of its or Enamorus's hits, such as Rotom-W, Zapdos, Ursaluna, and Azumarill, and appreciates Enamorus's ability to switch into Dark-type attacks from Hisuian Samurott and Hoopa-U and threaten them back.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Equipped with a Choice Scarf, Enamorus serves as a great cleaner and revenge killer, outspeeding and threatening some of the tier's most common threats like Dragapult and Zamazenta. Earth Power is great coverage against Pokemon that would switch into Moonblast, such as Heatran, Gholdengo, and Galarian Slowking. Mystical Fire allows Enarmous to 2HKO Air Balloon Gholdengo, which otherwise walls it, and also has a good chance to 2HKO Amoonguss with Stealth Rock support. Tera Fairy boosts Enamorus's already powerful Moonblast, capable of 2HKOing Ting-Lu and physically defensive Garganacl. Tera Ground boosts Earth Power, guaranteeing OHKOs against Kingambit and Volcanion as well as 2HKOing physically defensive variants of both Toxapex and Galarian Slowking, while Tera Steel grants Enamorus many resistances including Fairy and Ice; both also reduce its weakness to Stealth Rock at the cost of taking Spikes damage. Contrary is Enamorus's preferred ability, helping it against Mystical Fire, Parting Shot, and, if Terastallized, Sticky Webs.</p> <p>Enamorus serves as a great late-game cleaner on various offense teams. It appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Heatran, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T, so Enamorus can have an easier time to sweep against weakened foes. The three of them can also wallbreak for Enamorus, with Heatran being able to 2HKO both Corviknight and Amoonguss, comma while Hisuian Samurott and Landorus-T can both threaten Galarian Slowking. Teammates like Cinderace and Great Tusk that can remove Stealth Rock make valuable partners. Enamorus dislikes special walls that can hinder it like Dondozo, Assault Vest Toxapex, Cresselia, and Slowking. Hence, teammates that can break down bulkier teams like offensive Zapdos and Kingambit make for good teammates. Zapdos can 2HKO both Toxapex and Dondozo with Thunderbolt, and Kingambit can threaten both Cresselia and Slowking. Kingambit and Enamorus can also both facilitate sweeps for the other, with Kingambit beating Galarian Slowking for Enamorus and Enamorus being able to beat Zamazenta and Great Tusk for Kingambit. Enamorus also pairs well with slower yet bulky wallbreakers such as Ursaluna to deal with offense teams, and in return, Enamorus can provide them Healing Wish support. Lastly, Gholdengo makes for another great partner, as it can switch into Sneasler that can otherwise threaten Enamorus, switch into anticipated status such as Thunder Wave, and also keep hazards onfield placed by Enamorus's teammates.</p> "

What Draining Kiss may lack in power, it makes up for with its ability to keep Enamorus-T healthy, which is critical, since this set is focused on longevity over raw damage. Earth Power pairs exceedingly well with it, giving Enamorus-T impressive coverage that is resisted by only a few Pokemon while hitting threats like Gholdengo and Heatran super effectively. Leftovers help keep Enamorus-T healthy while it racks up boosts, but Heavy-Duty Boots keeps it safe from Stealth Rock, which poses to cut away a significant amount of HP once Enamorus-T switches in. Grassy Seed can also be run if Enamorus-T is paired with Rillaboom, as the instant Defense boost can aid it greatly in setting up. Terastallization aids Enamorus-T's ability to set up by mixing up its defensive profile;Tera Steel allows it to deal with Poison- and Steel-types, giving it a chance to take Dire Claw from Sneasler and Iron Head from Kingambit, respectively. It also removes its weakness to Electric, giving it a better matchup against Zapdos. In addition, with Overcoat, Tera Steel makes Enamorus-T a very capable Amoonguss switch-in, letting it use it as setup fodder for a potential sweep. Tera Water maintains the resistance to Steel while also giving it a resistance to Ice, and can turn Enamorus-T into a useful Walking Wake check in a pinch. The EV spread is designed to keep Enamorus-T as bulky as possible while still allowing it to outspeed uninvested Kingambit, Azumarill, and Ursaluna.</p> <p>Enamorus-T fits best on bulky offensive teams that allow it to sweep late-game once its checks have been whittled down or removed. Therefore, offensive wallbreakers like Sneasler and Iron Valiant serve as good teammates for it. The latter in particular is good at wearing down Moltres and Corviknight, two common Pokemon that resist both of Enamorus-T's attacks. Offensive hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott also help by wearing down the opponent's team. If Enamorus-T is not using Heavy-Duty Boots, then hazard removal is a necessity, so Pokemon like Great Tusk and Cinderace are further appreciated.</p> "

Moreover, its immunity to Prankster Taunt from Grimmsnarl, another common lead, lets Meowscarada get the leg up against opposing offensive teams. Taunt in conjunction with its insane Speed tier allows Meowscarada to shut down opposing entry hazard setters and removers like Garchomp, Glimmora, Iron Moth, and Corviknight, annoy defensive Pokemon like Clodsire and Toxapex, and prevent foes such as Kingambit and Dragonite from using it as setup fodder. Aside from threatening Grass-resistant Pokemon like Dragapult, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo, Knock Off's utility allows Meowscarada to soften up and cripple defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and Toxapex, and it works well with Spikes by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Amoonguss, Clodsire, and Scizor. Even with Meowscarada's middling Special Attack, Leaf Storm boosted by Overgrow can cleanly OHKO defensive Great Tusk, one of the metagame's most common entry hazard removers. Focus Sash guarantees that Meowscarada can set at least one layer of Spikes and safely puts Meowscarada into Overgrow range. Tera Ghost can be used in a pinch to spinblock Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Torkoal.</p> <p>Meowscarada excels at setting up the tempo for hyper offense teams. Offensive Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp and Great Tusk can stack entry hazards to put even more pressure on the opposing team, with mixed Garchomp threatening Corviknight from using Defog; in return, Meowscarada's Knock Off removes Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Dragonite, Zapdos, and Moltres to make them susceptible to Stealth Rock. By stacking entry hazards, Gholdengo becomes a near-mandatory teammate to prevent every attempt of hazard removal; Gholdengo also takes advantage of entry hazards itself to pressure checks like Toxapex and Clodsire, which makes Nasty Plot variants particularly difficult to deal with. Setup sweepers commonly found on hyper offense teams such as Dragonite, Kingambit, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth appreciate Spikes chipping down Pokemon like Dondozo, Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Clodsire. Furthermore, they enjoy Meowscarada crippling defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight and Amoonguss with Knock Off, with Dragonite and Kingambit in particular also appreciating Meowscarada luring in and dealing with Great Tusk.</p> "

Knock Off's high power and item removal make it an excellent move for making progress against foes such as Dragonite, Corviknight, and Toxapex. Flower Trick hits common Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Rotom-W for super effective damage, and its ability to always score a critical hit is very helpful against Defense-boosting foes like Garganacl. Aside from pivoting, U-turn gives super effective coverage against Hydreigon and Roaring Moon, which resist the combination of Knock Off and Flower Trick. Finally, Sucker Punch is a great option to pick off weakened faster foes such as Dragapult, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and Speed Booster Energy users such as Iron Moth. Alternatively, Taunt is great for shutting down support Pokemon such as Toxapex, Tera Fairy Garganacl, and Scream Tail. Tera Dark allows Meowscarada to always OHKO Gholdengo with Knock Off and gives it a chance to OHKO it with Sucker Punch. Tera Grass allows Meowscarada's Flower Trick to always 2HKO Garganacl and gives it a chance to OHKO offensive Great Tusk.</p> <p>Pivot Meowscarada fits on a variety of offensive and balance teams looking for a flexible Pokemon that can both exert pressure on the opponent and grab momentum. Since Meowscarada forces a lot of switches and is adept at wearing down foes with U-turn, entry hazard support from the likes of Great Tusk, Glimmora, and Ting-Lu is greatly appreciated. Meowscarada's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots through Knock Off makes it excellent for accentuating hazard damage. Gholdengo is a good partner, as it helps keep entry hazards on the field and can threaten Pokemon that force Meowscarada out, such as Breloom and Amoonguss. In return, Meowscarada threatens Ting-Lu and weakened Greak Tusk, which Gholdengo greatly appreciates. Meowscarada's U-turn support pairs well with powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Dragapult by giving them free entry onto the field. Meowscarada's Knock Off also cripples Corviknight for these two Pokemon. In return, these wallbreakers threaten Pokemon that Meowscarada lures in, such as Amoonguss and Dragonite. Late-game cleaners such as Booster Energy Iron Valiant, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Kingambit are great partners that can help finish off a team that Meowscarada has worn down. All of the aforementioned offensive teammates appreciate Meowscarada pressuring their checks like Dondozo, Garganacl, and Rotom-W.</p> "

Knock Off will generally be Meowscarada's most used move due to its high power and ability to force progress through item removal, crippling checks like Corviknight and Amoonguss. Flower Trick is Meowscarada's strongest attack, and its ability to always land a critical hit is very useful against foes that boost Defense, such as Dondozo, Curse Garganacl, and Bulk Up Great Tusk. With a Choice Band, Meowscarada has a good chance to OHKO offensive Great Tusk with Flower Trick. U-turn is great for grabbing momentum against Pokemon Meowscarada threatens out, such as Ting-Lu and Rotom-W, and provides super effective coverage against Hydreigon and Roaring Moon. Sucker Punch lets Meowscarada snipe faster foes such as Dragapult and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. Alternatively, Play Rough is an option that lets Meowscarada do great damage to Dragonite, which otherwise takes little from Meowscarada's attacks. Thunder Punch is a niche option to hit Corviknight and Tera Flying Pokemon like Kingambit and Gholdengo super effectively. Low Kick may also potentially be used to OHKO Kingambit. Both Tera Dark and Tera Grass are good options to boost the power of Meowscarada's STAB moves to enormous levels; for example, Tera Grass enables Meowscarada to OHKO Clodsire most of the time, while Tera Dark Knock Off easily OHKOes standard bulky Cinderace. Tera Fairy is a niche option that boosts the power of Play Rough and can help Meowscarada avoid being revenge killed by priority such as Mach Punch from Breloom, allowing it to OHKO it in return.</p> <p>Choice Band Meowscarada's unique blend of speed and power lets it act as both a wallbreaker and pivot on offensive teams. In particular, Meowscarada's U-turn support couples well with powerful but frail wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark by giving them free entry onto the battlefield. Hisuian Zoroark can also take advantage of Illusion and its immunity-laden typing to disguise itself as Meowscarada, which may force guesswork from the opponent and give it even more opportunities to fire off its strong attacks. Since Meowscarada forces many switches and can remove Heavy-Duty Boots through Knock Off, entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Garchomp is highly recommended. Gholdengo is another good partner that can prevent attempts to remove entry hazards while also switching into Pokemon that threaten out Meowscarada, such as Breloom, Amoonguss, and Corviknight. In return, Gholdengo appreciates Meowscarada's ability to deal with Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Tera Water Garganacl. Kingambit is a great Pokemon that can serve as a late-game cleaner after Meowscarada has weakened the enemy team with U-turn and Knock Off. Dragon Dance Dragonite is another great cleaner that, like Kingambit, appreciates Meowscarada's ability to break past Dondozo.</p> "

Knock Off allows Meowscarada to remove important items from Pokemon that rely on them, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite and Tera Fairy Skeledirge, as well as Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from Corviknight and Amoonguss. U-turn allows Meowscarada to serve as a fast pivot to keep up momentum, and with the boost from Protean, it can OHKO or dent slower Pokemon like opposing Meowscarada and Greninja. Play Rough allows Meowscarada to threaten Dragon-, Dark-, and Fighting-types such as Walking Wake, Dragapult, Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant. Trick allows Meowscarada to cripple walls such as Tera Fairy Garganacl, Amoonguss, and Toxapex. Tera Grass removes Meowscarada's Dark typing, eliminating its weakness to Mach Punch from Breloom and Pawmot, and strengthens its Flower Trick. Tera Fairy grants Meowscarada a resistance to Fighting but also keeps its resistance to Sucker Punch while simultaneously boosting Play Rough. Tera Dark boosts the power of Meowscarada's Knock Off, granting it a chance to OHKO Skeledirge. Terastallizing Meowscarada also negates Protean's effects, giving it more a consistent defensive typing.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Meowscarada fits best on various balance and offensive teams.

When Meowscarada isn't running Play Rough, it can struggle against Walking Wake, Iron Valiant, and Dragonite. Hence, Pokemon that can check them, such as Water Absorb Clodsire, Tera Fairy Garganacl, and Dondozo, make for good teammates; Clodsire can handle Walking Wake, Tera Fairy Garganacl can handle Iron Valiant, and Dondozo walls Dragonite. Despite Meowscarada's coverage options, it finds itself struggling to break past walls like Amoonguss and Corviknight as well as offensive Pokemon like Iron Moth. Hence, Meowscarada appreciates Pokemon that can check them like Skeledirge.

Curse also works well with Earthquake, breaking past Covert Cloak Gholdengo, non-Haze Toxapex, opposing Garganacl, and Skeledirge's Substitute. Stealth Rock is a viable alternative if the team lacks a Stealth Rock user, since Garganacl tends to force multiple switches with Salt Cure and can outlast and annoy common entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight. Tera Water lets it take on Kingambit, Gholdengo, Azumarill, and rain teams better, while Tera Fairy improves its matchup against Dragapult, Great Tusk, and Meowscarada, the latter of which can bypass Garganacl's boosts with Flower Trick. The EV spread prevents a 2HKO from offensive Great Tusk's Close Combat or Headlong Rush after Curse, even after its Leftovers is removed by Knock Off.</p> <p>Curse Garganacl is a valuable asset for balance teams. Defensive teammates such as Corviknight, Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Clodsire cover threats like Great Tusk, Greninja, Iron Valiant, and Gholdengo, respectively. Skeledirge in return appreciates Garganacl switching into Shadow Ball from Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark, with Tera Water variants dealing with Gholdengo and Water-types as well, while Ting-Lu and Clodsire are secondary checks to Dragapult, Heatran, and Iron Moth, which keeps Garganacl moderately healthy early-game so it can have an easier time sweeping later on. Knock Off users such as Great Tusk and Meowscarada are crucial to remove Covert Cloak and Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Amoonguss, Clodsire, Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Slowking. Great Tusk, Meowscarada, Toxapex, and Clodsire can also set entry hazards of their own, either allowing Garganacl to forgo Stealth Rock or forming an entry hazard stacking core. Offensive teammates like Dragapult and Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Meowscarada are great against offensive teams that contain the likes of Dragonite and Roaring Moon—which can overwhelm Garganacl prior to boosting—and can clean up late-game in case Garganacl is unable to fully sweep. In return, Garganacl matches up well against defensive foes that they struggle with, such as Clodsire and Toxapex, especially with Dragapult bringing it into them safely via U-turn.</p> "

Protect also scouts out the intentions of Choice locked Pokemon such as Gholdengo and gives extra Leftovers recovery. Terastallization, lets Garganacl turn the tables on Great Tusk and Iron Treads lacking Iron Head, and makes it an incredibly consistent Stealth Rock setter. Specifically, Tera Fairy lets it completely wall Dragapult, while Tera Water lets it check Gholdengo, though this makes its matchup against opposing Garganacl much tougher. 116 Special Defense EVs let Garganacl take a Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Tera Dragon Dragapult at full health.</p> <p>Garganacl fits on a wide variety of teams from bulky offense to stall thanks to it setting up Stealth Rock easily and having fantastic longevity. Ting-Lu is a fantastic partner since it can lay Spikes, and check Gholdengo and unboosted Kingambit, and wear down Corviknight much faster with Ruination thanks to Garganacl running Stealth Rock. Meowscarada and Great Tusk provide Knock Off support by removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Covert Cloak from Gholdengo and Toxapex to let Garganacl accrue Salt Cure damage more freely. Great Tusk also removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Gholdengo appreciates Great Tusk being worn down, since it shuts down other forms of entry hazard control well and fits alongside Garganacl and other entry hazard setters such as Garchomp. Cinderace lures in and uses U-turn on bulky Water-types such as Dondozo and Toxapex, giving Garganacl free entry to pressure them with Salt Cure.</p> "

        "description": "<p>The combination of Iron Defense + Body Press lets Garganacl serve as a bulky and dangerous setup sweeper, allowing it to beat Pokemon it otherwise loses to, such as Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Kingambit. Salt Cure wears down common switch-ins such as Great Tusk, Gholdengo, Rotom-W, and Hatterene, as well as passive Pokemon like Toxapex and Corviknight, and forces them to burn recovery PP more often. Recover keeps Garganacl healthy throughout a game to check Pokemon like Ceruledge and Iron Moth and makes it more sustainable as a wincon. Purifying Salt prevents it from being crippled by Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Clodsire. It also provides a handy Ghost resistance, letting Garganacl potentially switch in on predicted Ghost-type moves from Pokemon like Dragapult and Skeledirge. Leftovers provides valuable passive recovery, reducing Garganacl's reliance on Recover. Maximum Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature maximize Garganacl's bulk, making it easier for Garganacl to switch in on Pokemon such as Dragapult, Zapdos, and Heatran and use them as setup fodder. Tera Water provides incredibly valuable resistances, letting Garganacl potentially check Gholdengo and Scizor while retaining its ability to pivot in on Fire-types like Cinderace. Tera Fairy allows Garganacl to turn the tables on Great Tusk while also preventing Breloom from revenge killing it. However, this does remove its resistance to Fire, making it more susceptible to Pokemon like Skeledirge and Ceruledge. Tera Ghost prevents Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Great Tusk from reliably revenge killing Garganacl, letting it use them as setup fodder. It does negate the Ghost resistance provided by Purifying Salt, however, so another switch-in to Dragapult's Shadow Ball should be used.</p> <p>Checks to strong wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Breloom are good teammates; examples include the likes of Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Corviknight. While Garganacl is given a Ghost resistance from Purifying Salt, it cannot fully check Dragapult and Gholdengo prior to Terastallization, with the latter completely countering it if it uses Covert Cloak. As such, Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Clodsire make for great teammates. Pokemon like Corviknight and Scizor appreciate Garganacl checking Fire-types like Ceruledge and Skeledirge. Corviknight is notable in that it also forms a strong defensive core with Garganacl, checking Meowscarada for it. Entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and the aforementioned Corviknight are appreciated, as Garganacl is heavily pressured by entry hazards and cannot set up reliably if it is worn down. Frail, offensive Pokemon like Cinderace appreciate chip damage being forced onto their checks and having a strong defensive Pokemon to fall back on. Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Iron Valiant can pave the way for Garganacl to clean late-game, wearing down or significantly pressuring its checks in Gholdengo, Meowscarada, and Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Great Tusk.</p> "

        "name": "Psychic Terrain Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Armarouge carves a niche for itself with its powerful STAB moves and passable Speed alongside its unique setup and offensive utility. Endure allows Armarouge to survive any direct attack, and when combined with Weak Armor's speed boost, it can allow Armarouge to turn the tables on faster physical threats like Great Tusk, Dragapult, Baxcalibur, and Garchomp. Expanding Force is Armarouge's most powerful attack in Psychic Terrain and 2HKOed all neutral targets besides the uncommon Blissey. Moreover, with Spikes support or Tera Psychic, it can reliably OHKO the likes of Clodsire and Baxcalibur. Armor Cannon is Armarouge's strongest move outside of Psychic Terrain and complements Expanding Force well, OHKOing Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Corviknight and 2HKOing Hatterene. Calm Mind capitalizes on the switches it forces, allowing it to always OHKO Rotom-W and Volcarona with Expanding Force while often OHKOing Garganacl. Destiny Bond can instead force a trade against threats it cannot OHKO normally, such as Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and bulky threats like Ting-Lu and Dondozo. If Psychic Terrain is not active, Destiny Bond forces Sucker Punch users like Kingambit into a difficult situation, where they must either KO Armarouge next turn and faint or switch out and let Armarouge land a powerful attack for free. Tera Psychic powers up Expanding Force to ludicrous levels, allowing it to 2HKO specially defensive Skeledirge and OHKO Dondozo, physically defensive Garganacl, Clodsire, Garchomp, Volcarona, and Baxcalibur while OHKOing Assault Vest Toxapex after a Calm Mind boost. Focus Sash gives Armarouge space to survive at least one hit from full HP, allowing it to set up a Calm Mind or hit attackers back, and it can punish a contact move without committing to Endure. A Modest nature gives Armarouge the best odds of OHKOing Clodsire, Rotom-W, Walking Wake, and Baxcalibur after chip damage from entry hazards, but a Timid nature helps Armarouge sweep late-game by outpacing Speed-boosting Walking Wake with Protosynthesis active, outpacing +1 Iron Moth, and tying with +1 Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Armarouge is a staple on \"Psychic spam\" teams, which use Psychic Terrain and a litany of powerful setup sweepers to overwhelm opponents at a breakneck pace. Psychic Terrain blocks priority moves, including Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed, rendering Armarouge very difficult to revenge kill after a Weak Armor boost. Indeedee is a mandatory teammate to set Psychic Terrain, and it can wear down Dark-types with Dazzling Gleam. Furthermore, its Healing Wish can give a weakened Armarouge or one of its teammates a second chance to sweep. Polteageist is another common Psychic spam threat that can threaten the Dark-types Armarouge struggles against with a Fighting-type Tera Blast; in return, Armarouge can handle Steel-types, which Polteageist would otherwise be forced to Terastallize against. One of Armarouge or Polteageist can also wear down Ting-Lu, allowing the other to break past it and sweep late-game. Entry hazard control is extremely important, especially hazard removal, since Armarouge greatly prefers having Focus Sash active to sweep. Eject Pack Great Tusk provides excellent role compression for these teams, since it provides both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, and it can get Armarouge in safely by activating Eject Pack with Close Combat or Headlong Rush; notably, Armarouge can use Stealth Rock to more easily OHKO Rotom-W, Assault Vest Toxapex, and Clodsire without using up its team's Terastallization. Hatterene can deter opposing entry hazards with Magic Bounce while spreading paralysis with Nuzzle and weakening Dark-types with Dazzling Gleam; it can also use Eject Button to reliably pivot in Armarouge if Psychic Terrain is up. Magic Bounce also deters Taunt users, which can otherwise prevent Armarouge from setting up with Calm Mind and Endure, and Hatterene can also offer Healing Wish support. Lastly, many other setup sweepers can fit well on Psychic Terrain teams to open up a sweep for Armarouge, or to sweep once Armarouge punches holes for them. Volcarona and Dragon Dance Baxcalibur can weaken or eliminate Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon, which Armarouge struggles greatly against, while Armarouge can break past Clodsire and Unaware walls for Volcarona to sweep, and it can deal with Steel-types to assist Baxcalibur.</p> "

Additionally, Ceruludge's immunity to Will-O-Wisp thanks to Flash Fire is a major advantage, making it more consistent against Pokemon like Rotom-W and bulky Volcarona. Bitter Blade offers Ceruledge much-appreciated recovery, letting it maintain longevity and more easily set up. Shadow Sneak is valuable priority, letting Ceruledge pick off threats such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, Iron Valiant, and opposing Ceruledge that have been worn down. Taunt is important for preventing phazing from the likes of Ting-Lu while also preventing Toxapex's Haze. It also prevents status from the likes of Toxapex and Rotom-W, as well as recovery from defensive Pokemon like Clodsire, Toxapex, and Skeledirge. 12 Speed EVs ensure that Ceruledge is able to outspeed defensive Rotom-W, letting it prevent Thunder Wave with Taunt while being able to set up after Terastalization. Tera Bug gives Ceruledge a generally solid defensive typing with few weaknesses that synergizes well with Flash Fire. Additionally, it turns Ceruledge's Ground weakness into a resistance, letting it more easily take on Pokemon like Great Tusk and Tera Ground Volcarona. Meanwhile, Tera Fairy lets Ceruledge withstand hits from the likes of Choice Specs Dragapult and mixed Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Ceruledge fits on various offensive teams as a potent wincon thanks to its combination of Bulk Up and Bitter Blade giving it good longevity. Wallbreakers such as Kingambit, Iron Valiant, and Greninja can break through Pokemon that would otherwise check Ceruledge like Dondozo and Garganacl, letting Ceruledge more easily find opportunities to clean. Pokemon like Meowscarada, Great Tusk, and Breloom appreciate Ceruledge's ability to check Volcarona. In return, these Pokemon can wear down threats like Rotom-W for Ceruledge to take advantage of later. Ceruledge's typing leaves it vulnerable to Dark-type Pokemon like Roaring Moon and Hydreigon. Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Scream Tail make for solid teammates, as they can take a hit from and overwhelm these threats. In return, Ceruledge can act as a much-appreciated check to Pokemon like Iron Moth and Cinderace. Breloom also appreciates Ceruledge's ability to check Fire-types, and in return it can OHKO both Hydreigon and Roaring Moon with Mach Punch. Entry hazard support from the likes of Garchomp, Glimmora, and Meowscarada helps wear down aforementioned checks like Roaring Moon and Hydreigon.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Ceruledge’s access to Swords Dance lets it leverage its powerful STAB combination and great attacking options to function as a threatening wallbreaker. At +2, Ceruledge is capable of OHKOing Corviknight, Amoonguss, bulky Volcarona, and defensive Gholdengo with Bitter Blade. Shadow Sneak serves as a secondary STAB attack, preferred for its priority that lets it heavily damage faster threats like Iron Valiant and Dragapult at +2, OHKOing the latter and making offensive counterplay to Ceruledge harder. Taunt can be run over Shadow Sneak to stop entry hazard setters and sweepers from setting up, giving Ceruledge a chance to break foes with recovery such as Clodsire without the opponent gaining too much progress. Taunt also prevents Ceruledge by being statused by the likes of Clodsire and Rotom-W. Close Combat OHKOs specially defensive Garganacl after a Swords Dance boost while 2HKOing Ting-Lu, physically defensive Garganacl, and Rotom-W, all of which are not threatened by Bitter Blade. Solar Blade threatens Dondozo, Garganacl, Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Great Tusk while sun is active. Focus Sash can ensure that Weak Armor and Swords Dance are activated, allowing Ceruledge to sweep more reliably. Life Orb is an alternative option that makes it possible to OHKO Ting-Lu and 2HKO Great Tusk at +2. Weak Armor couples incredibly well with Focus Sash, and its resistances to types like Bug and Fire, allowing Ceruledge to gain a free Speed boost by switching into U-turn from pivots like Corviknight and Cinderace, as well as Pyro Ball from the latter. Flash Fire lets Ceruledge function as a more reliable switch-in to Fire-types like Iron Moth, while potentially powering up Bitter Blade. Tera Fire provides extra power to Bitter Blade in order to OHKO Amoonguss and 2HKO Tera Steel Toxapex before Swords Dance. Tera Fighting provides Ceruledge with a Dark-resistance, allowing it to take attacks from the likes of Kingambit and Roaring Moon, particularly Sucker Punch from the former, in order to gain a Speed boost from Weak Armor. However, beware of other neutral attacks from such threats, as Choice Band Roaring Moon will still be able to OHKO Ceruledge with Dragon Claw. After a Swords Dance, Tera Fighting gives Close Combat enough extra power to OHKO all Garganacl sets, Ting-Lu, and Rotom-W after Stealth Rock chip. Tera Grass can be used together with Solar Blade in order to 2HKO Dondozo under sun. If running a Jolly nature, Ceruledge can outspeed Gholdengo, as well as Booster Energy Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf Meowscarada, and +1 Roaring Moon and Adamant Dragapult after a Weak Armor boost. Jolly, however, notably misses out on Adamant’s chance to OHKO Great Tusk and Ting-Lu at +2 with Tera Fighting Close Combat, as well as ensuring a 2HKO against Clodsire with Bitter Blade after Stealth Rock chip.</p> <p>Ceruledge fits best on offensive teams, mainly those that use sun, in addition to some bulky offense teams that can provide it opportunities to enter battle and set up safely. As one of few viable physical Fire-types, Ceruledge has great synergy with Torkoal, which can activate sun to boost Bitter Blade’s power and allow Solar Blade to be used in one turn. Torkoal also sets Stealth Rock, removes hazards with Rapid Spin, and can spread status with Lava Plume and Yawn to allow Ceruledge safe entry. Walking Wake benefits from Ceruledge’s unique coverage on sun teams, as it appreciates foes like Azumarill and Slowking being removed. In return, Walking Wake can pressure foes like Skeledirge and Great Tusk. Great Tusk and Hatterene are also good partners on sun teams, as they can keep entry hazards off the field so that Ceruledge can enter battle safely with its Focus Sash intact. Ceruledge struggles with physical walls like Rotom-W and Great Tusk, as well as Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Dondozo. Choice Specs Iron Valiant has coverage for these foes, while Booster Energy variants threaten faster attackers like Roaring Moon and Dragapult. Mixed Garchomp puts pressure on most of Ceruledge’s checks, like Dondozo and Skeledirge, while luring in Corviknight so that Ceruledge can take advantage of its U-turn in order to activate Weak Armor. Corviknight itself is a good partner, as it is able to lure in Cinderace, another Pokemon Ceruledge can take advantage of, and pivot Ceruledge into battle safely. But, it can be a drain on momentum for more offensive teams. Ceruledge works well with hazard setters, as extra chip damage helps Ceruledge break foes like Garganacl and Rotom-W. In return, Ceruledge pressures Corviknight and can spinblock with its Ghost typing, but it doesn’t often do so due to bad matchups against common Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk. Examples of hazard-setting teammates include Great Tusk and Meowscarada, with the former being able to check Dark-types like Kingambit in the event Ceruledge cannot Terastallize, and the latter checking Rotom-W and Great Tusk.</p> "

Leaf Storm OHKOes foes like Great Tusk, Greninja, and Rotom-W while hitting Ting-Lu for a good amount as well. Rapid Spin is useful because Toedscruel is faster than every Stealth Rock setter in the tier besides Garchomp and Iron Treads, letting it switch in late-game to clear entry hazards if needed. Earth Power is an alternative over both moves, as it hits Clodsire, Torkoal, Kingambit, Iron Moth, and Glimmora while also chipping Dragapult. The combination of Earth Power and Rapid Spin allows Toedscruel to be a great lead into Glimmora, as it can use Earth Power to take Glimmora down to its Focus Sash, then Rapid Spin to remove the entry hazards that were set. Both of its STAB moves hit Garganacl quite hard, another common Stealth Rock setter, which hyper offense teams appreciate being scared out. Another great application of this combination is against spin blockers such as Ceruledge, Skeledirge and Gholdengo, which are all threatened to Tera or switch out by Earth Power, letting Toedscruel Rapid Spin. Tera Ghost allows Toedscruel to block Rapid Spin against Iron Treads and Great Tusk in a pinch.</p> <p>Lead Toedscruel is only seen on hyper offense teams, as it guarantees a critical layer of Spikes or a slept foe, regardless of abilities such as Good as Gold, Purifying Salt, and Magic Bounce, assisting in the late-game; the former is helpful for damage rolls and breaking Focus Sash, while the latter gives setup sweepers free turns. With that in mind, great partners include setup sweepers like Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit, the latter of which also appreciates Toedscruel fainting early-game, giving it a Supreme Overlord boost. Some threats to this set include Meowscarada, which is incredibly annoying because Taunt shuts down Toedscruel's entry hazards and Spore, and it cannot punish this, as it resists both Leaf Storm and Earth Power. Kingambit is a great choice for dealing with Meowscarada, as it resists Leaf Storm and Knock off and can threaten it with a powerful Low Kick or Iron Head without fear of Taunt. Hydreigon is also quite troublesome; its resistance to Leaf Storm and immunity to Earth Power allows it to set up a Substitute without fear of being put to sleep due to Mycelium Might causing Spore to move second. Dragapult serves as a great teammate, as it can threaten Hydreigon behind Substitute. Choice Band Dragapult is bothersome, as it OHKOes Toedscruel with Dragon Darts, but it is easily taken advantage of by Fairy-types like Azumarill and Iron Valiant if it OHKOes Toedscruel. Gholdengo is also a fantastic teammate, as it blocks attempts to clear Toedscruels's entry hazards and takes advantage of Spore by setting up with Nasty Plot.</p> "

Tera Fairy offers a generally strong defensive profile and grants Dondozo an immunity to Dragon-type attacks like Walking Wake's Draco Meteor. Tera Grass can be run instead to maintain Dondozo's Water resistance while granting it a resistance to Grass- and Electric-type attacks like Meowscarada's Flower Trick, Brute Bonnet's Bullet Seed, and Zapdos's Discharge and Volt Switch. Tera Fighting can also be considered, as it boosts Body Press and lets Dondozo check Kingambit and Choice Band Roaring Moon.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters like Clodsire and Ting-Lu pair perfectly with Dondozo, playing into its desire to outlast foes long-term with chip damage in the form of entry hazards, status, or Ruination. Both also check special attackers like Iron Valiant and Gholdengo, which Dondozo tends to struggle with. Garganacl deserves a special mention as a teammate due to its ability to wear down foes with Salt Cure; it, in turn, appreciates Dondozo taking on Great Tusk and Kingambit. Hatterene provides Dondozo teams with an excellent sweeper and appreciates Dondozo taking care of physical wallbreakers like Dragapult, and Kingambit. It also can help by blocking opposing entry hazards with Magic Bounce, letting Dondozo more comfortably tank a Knock Off from Great Tusk or Iron Treads. Similarly, entry hazard removal from Corviknight or Great Tusk is also helpful; Corviknight also deals with Meowscarada, which can force Dondozo to Terastallize early. Choice Scarf Gholdengo can help pressure opposing Dondozo while dealing with Dragapult and Iron Valiant. Dondozo also fits very well on stall teams, which appreciate its ability to wall so many physical attackers. Blissey is a standout teammate due to its ability to blanket check most special attackers, while Dondozo sponges physical attacks that Blissey cannot stomach. Lastly, Alomomola is a solid teammate on stall teams, as it can provide Wish support so Dondozo doesn't need to use Rest as frequently and can effectively utilize Whirlpool to trap opponents and prevent their double switches, allowing Dondozo to come in safely against physical attackers it walls.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Curse Dondozo is a deceptively strong sweeper that provides good defensive utility before it attempts a sweep. Liquidation is preferred over Wave Crash due to its lack of recoil; however, Wave Crash is an option if a stronger STAB move is desired. Body Press makes use of Dondozo's naturally high Defense stat and Curse's boosts to deal with foes like Roaring Moon. The combination of Avalanche + Earthquake can be run instead, which hits most of the metagame at least neutrally. Protect lets Dondozo accumulate Leftovers recovery and scouting for Choice item users like Iron Valiant and Breloom. However, Protect can be dropped for Rest, which affords Dondozo greater longevity at the cost of becoming more passive. Leftovers is preferred over Heavy-Duty Boots, as Dondozo will be on the field for many turns in a row to adequately set up with Curse; however, if a team requires Dondozo to play more defensively, Heavy-Duty Boots is a fine choice, though it should not be run alongside Protect. Grass is Dondozo's Tera type of choice, removing its original weaknesses while giving it an important resistance to Ground. Maximum investment in special bulk allows Dondozo to become nigh-unbreakable once it sets up. However, other generally good defensive Tera types like Steel and Fairy are situational options that can be utilized instead.</p> <p>Entry hazard removal is key for Dondozo if it does not run Heavy-Duty Boots; good options include Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight. Though Dondozo can have quite the offensive presence once it sets up, it is best to run it alongside consistent wallbreakers like Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Iron Valiant, which can help break open holes for it to sweep late-game. Similarly, entry hazards from teammates like Garchomp and Glimmora can facilitate Dondozo's sweep. Trick users like Iron Valiant and Gholdengo can cripple Dondozo checks like Clodsire and Skeledirge, causing them to lose to Dondozo over the course of the game. While Dondozo is a great sweeper, it is far from consistent at generating setup opportunities; accordingly, it is best to pair it with another bulky sweeper like Curse Garganacl or Hatterene, which can weaken or bait out answers to bulky sweepers like Trick users and Unaware Clodsire.</p> "

Its fantastic defensive typing allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes and nets it nice resistances to Fighting and Fairy, letting it check a unique combination of threatening offensive Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W. To aid in checking them, it runs Toxic to put these Pokemon on a timer, stalling with Recover as poison damage increases. When they're inevitably forced to switch, their replacement takes damage too since Clodsire sets Stealth Rock or Spikes, racking up even more damage. Leftovers can be used to help preserve Recover’s PP and stay in longer, while Heavy-Duty Boots helps Clodsire switch in and out to wall threats. Earthquake, besides providing direct damage, super effectively damages Pokemon that can't be poisoned like Gholdengo and other Clodsire. Terastallization gives Clodsire much more defensive flexibility as well; Tera Water can help it resist powerful STAB moves from Dondozo and Azumarill which would otherwise scare it out. Tera Flying is another useful option, turning its Ground weakness into an immunity while preserving its Fighting resistance, allowing it to stay in against Great Tusk and Focus Sash Breloom.</p> <p>Clodsire fits neatly into plenty of balance or stall teams looking for a way to handle special hits, offering support with both setting up hazards and removing Toxic Spikes, and walling sweepers with Unaware. Other hazard setters in particular love stacking hazards alongside it; since it learns both Stealth Rock and Spikes, it can fit with many options, like Spikes Meowscarada or Stealth Rock Garganacl. However, its mediocre Defense and weaknesses to Ground and Ice leave it particularly vulnerable to the the tier's physical wallbreakers, most notably Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Garchomp. As such, Clodsire greatly appreciates having teammates who can check these Pokemon and easily switch into Earthquake or Icicle Crash like Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Tera Water Garganacl. In particular, Clodsire is completely stonewalled by Hatterene and Air Balloon or Tera Flying Gholdengo. The former reflects both Toxic and entry hazards while overpowering its healing with Psyshock, and the latter is immune to Toxic via Good as Gold, even if it loses its Steel typing. Great teammates to help check these two are Gholdengo itself for Hatterene, which threatens Hatterene with Make It Rain and its unpredictable set versatility, and Kingambit for opposing Gholdengo, which resists both of Gholdengo's STAB moves and can immediately threaten to OHKO it back. In turn, these two appreciate Clodsire checking the Fire-types that scare them out, especially Iron Moth and Skeledirge. Bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo can check the Water-type threats Clodsire fears, like Floatzel and Azumarill.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Kingambit is a potent late-game cleaner and wincon thanks to Swords Dance, Supreme Overlord, and Sucker Punch, the latter of which helps compensate for its poor Speed tier. Its remarkable defensive profile grants it multiple opportunities to wreak havoc: it soft checks and takes advantage of prominent threats like Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Gholdengo—which can be problematic for offensive teams—while forcing out defensive foes like Hatterene, Toxapex, and Slowking. Iron Head smashes through Fairy-types and Tera Fairy users like Hatterene, Scream Tail, and Skeledirge, Toxapex, and Rotom-W. Low Kick most importantly OHKOes Roaring Moon and opposing Kingambit, and it severely dents Ting-Lu and Iron Treads. Tera Dark—especially alongside Black Glasses, if running it—cranks up Kingambit's damage output for even more late-game potential. Tera Dark in particular allows Sucker Punch to OHKO Gholdengo without a boost, as well as Garchomp at +2, and it also removes Kingambit's Ground weakness for foes like Garchomp and Ting-Lu. Tera Fighting removes all of Kingambit's weaknesses and boosts its Low Kick's damage output, allowing Kingambit to break pass Great Tusk and Dondozo after a couple of Supreme Overlord boosts. Tera Fire is another alternative that flips the matchup against Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Focus Sash Ceruledge, as well as stopping the former two and foes like Rotom-W, Dragapult, and Tera Water Skeledirge from crippling it with a burn. Moreover, the Fighting neutrality allows Kingambit to soft check Iron Valiant and Breloom, and it can set up safely on Body Press Corviknight. Lum Berry gives Kingambit more setup opportunities in the face of status users like Rotom-W and Dragapult, especially if it can't utilize Tera Fire to block their Will-O-Wisp. A Jolly nature allows Kingambit to outspeed uninvested Great Tusk and Rotom-W, and it works well on Low Kick variants to—at worst—Speed tie and OHKO opposing Kingambit.</p> <p>Kingambit fits well on offensive teams, which range from offense to hyper offense. Entry hazards from teammates like Glimmora, Meowscarada, and Garchomp are near mandatory, as they deactivate Focus Sash on foes like Greninja, Polteageist, and Ceruledge and chip down foes into Kingambit's KO range. Also, these setters tending to faint early-game helps Kingambit accumulate Supreme Overlord boosts. Wallbreakers such as Iron Moth, Dragapult, and Iron Valiant are necessary to pressure the opposition early-game, especially because they can overwhelm and individually threaten Kingambit's checks like Dondozo, Corviknight, and Great Tusk; Iron Moth in particular deals with troublesome Fairy-types if Kingambit lacks Iron Head. In return, Kingambit deals with Dragapult for Iron Moth and Gholdengo for Iron Valiant, with Low Kick variants dealing with opposing Kingambit for Dragapult as well. Other setup sweepers like Dragonite and Roaring Moon are secondary wincons in case Kingambit is unable to fully sweep, especially if it runs Swords Dance to overwhelm their shared checks like Dondozo, Corviknight, and Tera Water Garganacl and Skeledirge. Aside from rain teams weakening the Fire-type moves from Iron Moth and Dragapult, they support Kingambit with wallbreakers like Floatzel, Azumarill, and Greninja, which threaten Great Tusk and overwhelm Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl and Skeledirge. Kingambit also takes advantage of Floatzel fainting early-game from Wave Crash recoil to gain a Supreme Overlord boost.</p> "

Kowtow Cleave is Kingambit's most reliable STAB option; with a Swords Dance boost and Supreme Overlord's maximum number of boosts, it is powerful enough to OHKO physically defensive Corviknight after Stealth Rock damage the majority of the time. Sucker Punch allows Kingambit to greatly pressure offensive threats, allowing it to eliminate weakened foes like Walking Wake, Hisuian Zoroark, Iron Moth, and Floatzel. With boosts from Supreme Overlord and Swords Dance, it can even handle bulkier threats like Roaring Moon where its high bulk investment allows it to attack them first, survive a hit, and KO them with Sucker Punch thereafter. Iron Head is a consistent STAB option that can eliminate Garganacl, Hatterene, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge while pressuring Roaring Moon without relying on Sucker Punch predictions against Dragon Dance variants. Tera Blast alongside a Fairy or Flying Tera type allows Kingambit to punish Fighting-types like Iron Valiant, Great Tusk, and Breloom by turning its 4x Fighting weakness into a resistance and OHKOing them in return with a super effective attack, though this comes at the cost of requiring Kingambit to Terastallize in order to maximize its coverage. Tera Fairy also improves Kingambit's matchup against Dragon-types like Roaring Moon, while Tera Flying grants it a Ground immunity to allow it to turn Great Tusk into setup fodder. 20 Speed EVs allow Kingambit to outspeed minimum Speed Corviknight, while the HP investment allows Kingambit to survive powerful attacks like Choice Specs Iron Valiant's Moonblast.</p> <p>Kingambit is an excellent wincon on bulky offense and balanced teams. Ting-Lu and Garchomp provide Stealth Rock and Spikes support to let Kingambit KO Roaring Moon with a boosted Sucker Punch, and the chip damage from entry hazards can make up for fewer Supreme Overlord boosts should some of Kingambit's teammates still be healthy. Iron Valiant can use its strong mixed coverage to pressure Unaware walls like Dondozo and that would otherwise ignore Kingambit's Swords Dance boosts and prevent its sweep, while Hisuian Zoroark can eliminate Dondozo while pressuring Skeledirge and Amoonguss. In return, Kingambit's great bulk and good defensive typing let it check faster offensive threats like Dragapult and Meowscarada while resisting priority from Dragonite. Great Tusk appreciates Kingambit's ability to pressure Fairy-types that force it out, and in return, it wears down Steel-types—especially opposing Kingambit, which this set greatly appreciates, since it does not carry Low Kick—so Kingambit can sweep more easily. Dragon-types like Dragapult, Roaring Moon, and Dragonite all have excellent synergy with Kingambit, as it resists Dragon- and Ice-type attacks and can threaten Fairy-types like Hatterene and Tera Fairy Garganacl with Iron Head; any of these Dragon-types can run Choice item sets to help wallbreak for Kingambit, or Kingambit can assist in wallbreaking earlier in the game to facilitate their sweeps if they opt to run Dragon Dance sets instead. Said Dragon-types resist Fire-type attacks from Cinderace and Iron Moth. Iron Moth itself makes for an effective teammate, as it can handle threats like Corviknight and opposing Kingambit while wearing down walls like Dondozo to help Kingambit sweep. In return, Kingambit's powerful Sucker Punch can pressure fast and powerful physical attackers like Dragapult and Cinderace that Iron Moth cannot reliably set up against. Lastly, Choice Scarf Gholdengo can take advantage of Corviknight and Amoonguss to help Kingambit break through defensive cores long-term and can use Trick to cripple walls like Skeledirge and Dondozo, giving Kingambit opportunities to exploit their newfound Choice locks and wear them down.</p> "

Tera Flying completely reverses Kingambit's weaknesses and resistances and can catch Pokemon looking to KO Kingambit with Fighting- and Ground-type moves like Iron Valiant and Great Tusk, off guard. Alternatively, Kingambit can opt for Tera Ghost to better counter Tera Normal Dragonite, as Earthquake becomes neutral against Kingambit and Extreme Speed is ineffective. Similarly, Tera Fairy can be chosen because Kingambit then resists Roaring Moon's Crunch, which cannot OHKO Kingambit without Tera Steel.

Kingambit checks opposing offensive Pokemon such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Meowscarada thanks to its defensive typing but loses out against revenge killers such as Breloom and other threats like Calm Mind Iron Valiant, Iron Hands, Dondozo, and Great Tusk; as such, Kingambit appreciates defensive support from Great Tusk, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W and offensive support from Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Dragapult.</p> "

Great Tusk takes on a plethora of physical attackers in the tier, including Kingambit, Garchomp, and Scizor while also threatening entry hazard setters such as Glimmora, Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Garganacl. Knock Off prevents Air Balloon Gholdengo from completely spinblocking Great Tusk, and it also removes items such as Rocky Helmet, Leftovers, and Heavy-Duty Boots from defensive Pokemon that commonly switch into Great Tusk such as Dondozo, Corviknight, and Hatterene. Ice Spinner lets Great Tusk take on Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Garchomp more easily, though the lack of Close Combat leaves Great Tusk walled by Corviknight and Rotom-W. Maximum Speed investment paired with a Jolly nature ensures that Great Tusk is able to outspeed Rotom-W, non-Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and Jolly Dragonite. Tera Fighting makes Great Tusk much better at taking on Water-types such as Quaquaval while making Close Combat significantly harder to switch into; alternatively, Tera Steel lets Great Tusk flip its type weaknesses and take on Pokemon like Iron Valiant, and Tera Flying Roaring Moon. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Great Tusk from being worn down by Toxic Spikes and Spikes, letting it remove entry hazards consistently throughout a match; however, Leftovers provides Great Tusk with a form of recovery. Booster Energy is a niche option that provides Great Tusk with a one-time boost to its Attack, making it an immediately threatening wallbreaker without the use of Terastallization. Eject Pack forces Great Tusk out after it uses Headlong Rush or Close Combat, allowing it to take advantage of Pokemon like Dondozo and Corviknight trying to switch in.</p> <p>Great Tusk takes on Dark-type Pokemon such as Kingambit, and Ting-Lu, so Pokemon weak to Dark such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, Slowking, and Skeledirge appreciate Great Tusk; Slowking and Dragapult in particular are able to pivot in Great Tusk with Chilly Reception and U-turn, respectively. Great Tusk is also able to take on entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu and Garchomp and remove entry hazards from the field, so Pokemon that can be overwhelmed by hazards such as Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl appreciate Great Tusk's presence. Great Tusk struggles to take on faster special attackers such as Iron Valiant and Dragapult, so special walls such as Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Toxapex are great partners. Great Tusk also has difficulty with physical walls such as Dondozo, Tera Water and Tera Fairy Garganacl, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge. Spikes support from Ting-Lu, Glimmora, and Garchomp wears down these checks into range of Great Tusk's attacks, especially when paired with Knock Off. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, Iron Hands, and Breloom make for good partners by being able to overwhelm shared checks; Gholdengo is a noteworthy wallbreaker for also blocking opposing hazard removal. Torkoal is also an excellent partner for Great Tusk, setting up the sun to activate Protosynthesis and weaken Water-type attacks, while supporting other wallbreakers that can pressure the aforementioned physical walls, such as Choice Band Roaring Moon, Scovillain, and Slither Wing.</p> "

It can adequately check Pokemon like Kingambit, Cinderace, and Iron Hands, threatening them with a strong Earthquake in return. Stealth Rock lets Great Tusk compress even more roles, chipping away at the opposition. If another Stealth Rock user is already on the team, however, Body Press can take advantage of its high Defense stat and better threaten the likes of Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon. Body Press also lets Great Tusk catch Rotom-W with greater chip damage than Knock Off does on the switch. Knock Off provides valuable item removal, getting rid of Leftovers from Pokemon like Dondozo, Corviknight, and Hatterene, as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite. Additionally, Knock Off is Great Tusk's only initial way to hit Air Balloon Gholdengo, which can't OHKO this defensive set. Rapid Spin, besides clearing entry hazards, also allows Great Tusk to outspeed faster foes like Focus Sash Glimmora and Gholdengo. Tera Water grants Great Tusk an overall valuable defensive typing, letting it check threats like Azumarill and—in a pinch—foes like Iron Moth and Gholdengo while still maintaining a positive matchup against Dragonite, Kingambit, and opposing Great Tusk. Tera Fighting gets rid of Great Tusk's Ground typing, giving it a better matchup against Pokemon like Quaquaval and Floatzel while also strengthening Body Press if it is used. Alternatively, Tera Steel can give Great Tusk valuable resistances to Fairy, and Grass, turning the tables on Hatterene and Meowscarada. Leftovers greatly increases Great Tusk's longevity; however, Rocky Helmet can be used to wear down Pokemon like Scizor and Cinderace over time.</p> <p>After Great Tusk sets Stealth Rock, Corviknight effortlessly switches in and uses Defog to remove entry hazards, so Pokemon like Cinderace, Gholdengo, and Rotom-W that handle it are great partners. With no good way to hit Flying-types and Pokemon that use Tera Flying, Great Tusk can be set up on very quickly, most notably against the likes of Dragonite and Roaring Moon; even though the former dislikes Knock Off. Therefore, checks to these such as Dondozo and Corviknight are appreciated. A different Stealth Rock setter like Garganacl or Ting-Lu lets Great Tusk comfortably run Body Press without losing out on anything major. Ting-Lu also forms a potent entry hazard-stacking core with Great Tusk via Spikes. Further, it takes on the special attackers that Great Tusk struggles with, like Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult. Great Tusk is forced out by wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Quaquaval, so teammates that can check them like Amoonguss and Toxapex are welcome. Pokemon like Ceruledge, and Iron Moth appreciate the entry hazard removal that Great Tusk provides.

Its dual STAB moves are able to OHKO or severely damage several key offensive Pokemon in the metagame such as Kingambit, and Tera Normal Dragonite. Knock Off allows Great Tusk to remove Leftovers from walls such as Corviknight and Dondozo. It can also remove important items from more offensive Pokemon, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite, and it can provide coverage against Air Balloon Gholdengo, which otherwise checks this set. Ice Spinner hits Dragon-types that Headlong Rush isn't as strong against like bulky Garchomp and Dragonite. Alternatively, Rapid Spin can be run if the team is still in need of entry hazard removal. With Tera Fighting, Close Combat becomes much stronger, guaranteeing OHKOs against offensive Scizor sets. Tera Fighting also improves Great Tusk's matchups against Dondozo, Rotom-W, and opposing Great Tusk.

Skeledirge is able to spread burn, capitalize on foes afflicted with status with a boosted Hex, and check Iron Valiant sets lacking Shadow Ball. Lastly, Torkoal is able to force switches thanks to Yawn, spread status with Lava Plume, and set up sun to make Great Tusk an even scarier wallbreaker. Great Tusk appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Garganacl and Ting-Lu, since it can wallbreak more easily thanks to the chip damage they provide. Great Tusk is able to keep their hazards up in exchange while simultaneously removing hazards set by foes. Sweepers that are vulnerable to hazards like Iron Moth and Tera Flying Roaring Moon appreciate Great Tusk being able to remove hazards and beat walls such as Ting-Lu, allowing them to sweep more easily late-game.

Encore prevents setup sweepers like Volcarona, Calm Mind Iron Valiant, and Bulk Up Great Tusk from using Scream Tail as a setup opportunity, letting Scream Tail's teammates switch in and take advantage of these threats. It can also be used to annoy passive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Dondozo. Tera Fairy gives Scream Tail better matchups against Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Hisuian Zoroark, with the former two being susceptible to being OHKOed by Dazzling Gleam. Alternatively, Tera Water lets Scream Tail maintain a solid defensive typing while also helping it check Walking Wake, Skeledirge, and Greninja. With a Timid nature, 152 Speed EVs let Scream Tail outspeed Hydreigon, while 236 Special Defense EVs ensure that Scream Tail gets a Special Defense boost with Protosynthesis under sun, letting it more easily take on threats such as Walking Wake and Iron Valiant. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 84 SpD / 172 Spe with a Calm nature lets Scream Tail outspeed unboosted Great Tusk and pass beefier Wishes.</p> <p>Scream Tail fits on many sun, balance, and stall teams thanks to its bulk, ability to pass Wish to teammates, and create momentum with Encore. Bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo make for good teammates, as they are able to check Greninja and Ceruledge, respectively. Moreover, Toxapex also checks Pokemon like Iron Moth and Glimmora as well as spread status, making Encore much more of a detriment to setup sweepers like Volcarona and Iron Valiant, while Dondozo blanket checks physically oriented Pokemon that can overwhelm Scream Tail, namely Booster Energy Roaring Moon and Ceruledge. Entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for excellent teammates, as a lack of hazards means that Scream Tail can accomplish feats such as surviving two Choice Specs Greninja Hydro Pumps from full HP. Additionally, Great Tusk appreciates Wish support in order to more consistently check Scream Tail answers such as Kingambit. Torkoal is a great teammate thanks to its sun activating Scream Tail's Protosynthesis. In addition, Torkoal very much appreciates Wish support in order to more consistently check Pokemon like Kingambit. Meanwhile, Scream Tail is able to sponge special attacks from the likes of Walking Wake. Under sun, Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Ceruledge, and Brute Bonnet appreciate Scream Tail facilitating their sweeps with its combination of Encore and Wish, keeping them healthy while leveraging setup opportunities for them. Hydreigon is another excellent offensive partner, checking Gholdengo and finding more opportunities to set up Substitute thanks to Scream Tail's Wish.</p> "

Brute Bonnet stands out due to its access to Spore, allowing it to lure in and immobilize incoming foes like Dragonite and Roaring Moon. Sucker Punch allows Brute Bonnet to revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Dragapult and Gholdengo. Tera Fire Tera Blast gives it coverage against Pokemon like Corviknight, Kingambit, and Amoonguss and is further boosted by sun. Loaded Dice is the preferred item for Brute Bonnet, since it can maximize Bullet Seed's damage output. Tera Fire is Brute Bonnet's best Tera type to both take advantage of a sun boosted Tera Blast and change most of its type weaknesses to resistances, improving its matchups against Iron Valiant and Volcarona.</p> <p>In order to fully reap Brute Bonnet's benefits, it must be used on a sun team. Hence, Torkoal is a mandatory partner to activate Brute Bonnet's Protosynthesis; it can additionally lay down Stealth Rock and act as a secondary hazard remover. Brute Bonnet also appreciates entry hazard support from Garchomp, which can wear down incoming foes for Brute Bonnet. When it Terastallizes, Brute Bonnet becomes highly susceptible to entry hazards. Hence, hazard control from the likes of Hatterene and Great Tusk is greatly appreciated. Lastly, Brute Bonnet struggles against walls such as Tera Fairy Garganacl and Skeledirge as well as faster Pokemon like Garchomp and Volcarona; Roaring Moon and Walking Wake are good teammates to handle said checks.

        "description": "<p>Sandy Shocks can work as an excellent pivot on offensive teams, leveraging its high Speed and Special Attack to confound switch-ins with Volt Switch, which significantly chips even most Electric-resistant foes like Dragapult and Breloom and allows for a powerful teammate like Meowscarada to be brought in safely. Tera Fairy Tera Blast also provides Sandy Shocks with incredible coverage alongside its STAB moves, threatening Pokemon such as defensive Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Dragapult that are otherwise mostly satisfactory switch-ins and that threaten Sandy Shocks out in turn. In particular, Great Tusk goes from an adequate check to being cleanly OHKOed by Tera Blast assuming it is safe to stay in. Tera Fairy also lets Sandy Shocks resist Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Stealth Rock and Spikes both provide invaluable entry hazard support for Sandy Shocks and its teammates to wear down counters, while Thunderbolt is a solid option to maintain an Electric-type STAB move without being forced to switch out, especially when it can immediately threaten a KO late-game on chipped targets like Slowking and Rotom-W. With 252 Speed EVs, even a Modest Sandy Shocks still crucially outpaces all variants of Great Tusk, Gholdengo, and Rotom-W; a Timid nature can be run instead to also outpace Hydreigon at the cost of some power. When it comes to the item slot, Heavy-Duty Boots is perhaps the most straightforward item for Sandy Shocks, as being a pivot, Sandy Shocks gaining an immunity to hazards, which allows it to come in and wreak havoc many more times per game. However, Expert Belt provides a much-appreciated power boost, especially when going Modest for extra damage, since Sandy Shocks's Electric + Ground + Fairy coverage hits nearly the entire metagame super effectively. In particular, it guarantees that Earth Power will always 2HKO Clodsire and guarantees the OHKO on bulky Kingambit.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks shines on momentum-based bulky offense teams, so other Pokemon that can maintain momentum such as Choice item Dragapult, Meowscarada, Slowking, Rotom-W, and Scizor, as well as Eject Button users like offensive Great Tusk are good teammates. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Meowscarada, Garchomp, and Great Tusk is also excellent, since the hazard chip will stack with the numerous switches forced by Sandy Shocks. Additional Stealth Rock users in particular are appreciated because they free Sandy Shocks's fourth moveslot up to run Spikes or Thunderbolt more freely. Meowscarada is an excellent choice with several of its sets, as its Knock Off removes the Heavy-Duty Boots that Sandy Shocks's switch-ins rely on to not get worn down by hazards, it can set hazards itself, its U-turn forms the potent VoltTurn combination with Sandy Shocks, and its Flower Trick is extremely threatening to the Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu that can tank Sandy Shocks's Volt Switch assault. If not running Heavy-Duty Boots, Sandy Shocks can be worn down itself by Spikes, minimizing its effectiveness, and so hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight form prurient teammates. Sandy Shocks's relative frailty and weakness-laden typing means that faster Pokemon like Meowscarada, Garchomp, Dragapult, Cinderace, and Walking Wake, as well as Choice Scarf users such as specific variants of Rotom-W and Gholdengo, can immediately force Sandy Shocks out, lest its meager bulk causes it to be unceremoniously OHKOed. Strong priority moves like Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Azumarill's Aqua Jet present similar issues. As such, additional, more defensive pivots such as the aforementioned Corviknight and Rotom-W serve double duty, as they can act as a buffer against these threats without completely ceding momentum.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Sandy Shocks's appeal comes from its high Special Attack and ability to come in at +1 Speed with Booster Energy to pressure common spinners, letting it be one of the best offensive entry hazard setters in the tier. With the lack of reliable Ground-resistant Pokemon, Earth Power becomes incredibly spammable, targeting opposing hazard setters like Glimmora, Garganacl, Iron Treads, Torkoal, and Iron Moth. Earth Power also deals massive damage to Great Tusk, limiting its spinning capabilities. Thunderbolt is an excellent second STAB move, as it targets Flying-types such as Corviknight, Pelipper, and Iron Jugulis, as well as heavily punishing Rotom-W. Thunderbolt also hits threatening Water-types, 2HKOing Azumarill, Dondozo, and Slowking while also OHKOing Greninja. Both of these STAB moves 2HKO Toxapex as well. Stealth Rock or Spikes are very useful on Sandy Shocks because it threatens out almost every entry hazard remover, namely Great Tusk, Torkoal, Corviknight, Cinderace, Glimmora, and Talonflame. Tera Fairy Tera Blast is the perfect coverage tool for Sandy Shocks because it targets threats that would normally wall it, such as Hydreigon and Meowscarada, and it can land surprise KOs on would-be switch-ins like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Roaring Moon while also 2HKOing Garchomp. The Fairy typing has great defensive utility as well, resisting priority moves such as Sucker Punch from Kingambit and Meowscarada and Mach Punch from Breloom.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks fits best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Its ability to immediately get up entry hazards and threaten other hazard setters is instrumental for the success of hyper offense, and not activating Glimmora's Toxic Debris in the hyper offense mirror match is very useful. On bulky offense teams, it can offer more flexibility, setting up hazards and pressuring opposing defensive cores. With its great Speed stat after a Protosynthesis boost, Sandy Shocks threatens offensive Pokemon that would otherwise outspeed it like Dragapult. It also forces damage on bulkier Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Rotom-W, so teammates such as Iron Moth and Dragonite that appreciate these being weakened work best. Ground-immune teammates like Dragonite and Rotom-W also help Sandy Shocks on bulky offense teams, switching into foes like Great Tusk. Opposing Meowscarada is problematic for this set, as it essentially forces it to Terastallize, so teammates that can handle it like Kingambit and Iron Valiant are also very useful. Amoonguss can generally take advantage of Sandy Shocks too, threatening Spore on teammates, so Gholdengo is another great teammate; it also blocks Rapid Spin and Defog.</p> "

Alternatively, Stealth Rock can turn Iron Treads into a fast hazard setter that exerts offensive pressure. Knock Off provides utility in removing Leftovers from Dondozo, Rotom-W, and Corviknight. Rapid Spin provides the most utility, as it keeps entry hazards clear to better help its teammates switch in without fearing chip damage. Booster Energy allows Iron Treads to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, notably outspeeding fast threats such as +1 Dragonite, Dragapult, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, Meowscarada, and Iron Valiant. A Ground Tera Type is ideal to maximize Earthquake's damage output against Garganacl, Dragapult, Skeledirge, and Volcarona while removing its weakness to Fire.

However, Iron Treads stands out due to its faster Speed and its access to Volt Switch, which allows it to serve as a fast offensive pivot. With Stealth Rock, Iron Treads can wear down Pokemon that dislike entry hazards like Dragapult, Roaring Moon, and Booster Energy Iron Moth, limiting their opportunities to switch in. Rapid Spin allows Iron Treads to remove hazards from its side while also boosting its Speed, allowing it to threaten Pokemon that would normally outspeed it like Cinderace. Volt Switch not only allows Iron Treads to perform as a pivot but also deals super effective damage to Flying-types like Corviknight and Tera Flying Kingambit. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used to remove important items such as Leftovers from defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Corviknight, and Garganacl as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon vulnerable to hazards such as Dragonite and Skeledirge. Knock Off also allows Iron Treads to deal super effective damage to Air Balloon Gholdengo. Tera Flying completely removes Iron Treads's weakness to Ground-types and turns it into an immunity, allowing it to switch into Great Tusk. Leftovers grants Iron Treads a form of longevity so it can find more opportunities to pivot into teammates. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used as well to help Iron Treads pivot more consistently into teammates while not getting worn down from hazards.</p> <p>Iron Treads fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its offensive utility in order for their team members to function in their roles more effectively. Wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant and Iron Moth pair well with Iron Treads, since they appreciate being brought in by Volt Switch.

Garchomp, Meowscarada, and Greninja make for great partners, since the three of them can stack Spikes with Iron Treads to wear down incoming foes into KO range from one of the team's offensive Pokemon. If Iron Treads is running Volt Switch, it could have a hard time pivoting into its teammates, since Ground-types like Great Tusk and Garchomp can switch into it if its predicted. Hence, teammates that can handle Ground-types like Rotom-W pair well with Iron Treads. Lastly, sweepers such as Walking Wake, Dragonite, and Azumarill appreciate Iron Treads bringing them to sweep. Walking Wake and Azumarill in particular can help in removing Ground-types that can interrupt Iron Treads's pivoting ability.</p> "

Taunt allows Iron Jugulis to function as a dangerous stallbreaker by shutting down passive walls such as Clodsire, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu. It also prevents Slowking from pivoting with Chilly Reception and threats such as Dragonite, Volcarona, Polteageist, and Roaring Moon from setting up. Flamethrower hits Steel-types such as Corviknight, Kingambit, and Iron Treads.

Tera Dark boosts the power of Dark Pulse, making it easier to pressure walls such as Garganacl, Rotom-W, and Toxapex with its flinch chance. Tera Flying strengthens Hurricane, OHKOing Greninja, Amoonguss, and Cinderace most of the time and 2HKOing Toxapex, Dondozo, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge.

Powerful wallbreakers such as Breloom and Dragapult can soften up the opposing team for Iron Jugulis to clean up late-game. Conversely, Iron Jugulis's ability to break through special walls with Taunt opens up other special sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Iron Moth. Gholdengo can also cripple walls with Choice item + Trick and handle Booster Energy Iron Valiant, one of the only threats capable of outspeeding and threatening Iron Jugulis. Iron Jugulis is also effective on rain teams, providing it with a perfectly-accurate Hurricane and featuring extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Floatzel and Walking Wake that can punch holes for it to sweep late-game.

Flamethrower is Iron Moth's preferred Fire-type STAB move due to its consistency, although Overheat can be run if power is preferred. Overheat is the better option on sun teams or Tera Fire variants, as Iron Moth can 2HKO Unaware Clodsire. Morning Sun grants Iron Moth valuable longevity, allowing it to find more opportunities to break walls as the game progresses. Tera Fairy removes Iron Moth's various weaknesses, including to Stealth Rock, and improves its matchups against Pokemon like Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Greninja in a pinch.

Icicle Crash also has merit, however, as it gives Baxcalibur a chance to flinch down its checks like Iron Defense Corviknight. Tera Dragon allows Baxcalibur to gain a Fire resistance, notably helping it check Volcarona. Additionally, Tera Dragon boosts the power of Glaive Rush, allowing +2 Baxcalibur to OHKO physically defensive Toxapex. Alternatively, Tera Fairy is a defensive option to avoid being revenge killed by threats such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit. Thermal Exchange is the preferred ability to prevent burns, letting Baxcalibur set up against Pokemon like Rotom-W.</p> <p>Swords Dance Baxcalibur works best on hyper offense teams, where it can wallbreak effectively to facilitate sweeps for other offensive Pokemon such as Booster Energy Iron Moth and Iron Valiant. Teammates such as offensive Great Tusk, Meowscarada, and Glimmora can set entry hazards to help pressure Baxcalibur checks such as Azumarill and Dondozo. Kingambit provides a switch-in to Dragapult and helps overwhelm shared checks like Dondozo. Volcarona appreciates Baxcalibur's efforts in wearing down Skeledirge and checks Iron Valiant. Baxcalibur is vulnerable to hazards if running Loaded Dice, so it appreciates hazard removal from Iron Treads and Great Tusk. Swords Dance Baxcalibur also appreciates Sticky Web support from Masquerain, as this allows it to outspeed revenge killers such as Hisuian Zoroark, non-Booster Energy Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Baxcalibur functions as a phenomenal wallbreaker, capable of threatening a multitude of Pokemon and forcing many switches throughout the game. With Choice Band, a powerful STAB move in Glaive Rush, and Tera Dragon, Baxcalibur can easily plow through the opposing team, managing to cleanly 2HKO the most physically defensive Pokemon in the tier such as Dondozo, Toxapex, and Garganacl. Icicle Crash is a more consistent damaging move to potentially muscle past Corviknight and Calm Mind Hatterene with the flinch chance, while Icicle Spear can break Substitute and bypass Focus Sash from Pokemon like Breloom, Tera Fairy Skeledirge, and Tera Grass Volcarona. Earthquake is a strong coverage move to hit Azumarill for neutral damage and common Steel-types such as Gholdengo and Kingambit super effectively. Ice Shard hits faster pokemon, allowing Baxcalibir to revenge kill common setup sweepers in the OU metagame, such as Dragapult, Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and opposing Baxcalibur. Additionally, Tera Ice can be used to boost Baxcalibur's Ice-type attacks, turning it into an even better revenge killer, and allows its Icicle Crash to 2HKO relevant checks like Corviknight. Baxcalibur can also use Tera Ground to get rid of its hindering Stealth Rock weakness, power up its Earthquake, and avoid Thunder Wave from Rotom-W. Another main factor to Baxcalibur's wallbreaking prowess is Thermal Exchange, which takes advantage of Fire-type attacks and most importantly grants it a complete immunity to burn from Pokemon like Torkoal, Skeledirge, Rotom-W, and Volcarona. A Jolly Nature allows Baxcalibur to outspeed common threats such as Nasty Plot Gholdengo, Glimmora, Ceruledge, and Dragonite while notably Speed tying with Great Tusk.</p> <p>Choice Band Baxcalibur can function in almost any offensive team thanks to its wallbreaking potential, ranging from hyper to bulky offense that appreciate its powerful priority and ability to break through defensive Pokemon. As very reliable pivots, Rotom-W and Meowscarada are great partners for Baxcalibur, providing it multiple opportunities to get into the field while threatening Curse Dondozo. Great Tusk can offer support with Stealth Rock and can use Rapid Spin to clear entry hazards that would otherwise wear Baxcalibur down. Iron Valiant is a good special partner that can threaten the fastest Pokemon in the tier, such as Dragapult, Greninja, and Cinderace, thanks to Choice Scarf and Quark Drive. Iron Valiant has also wallbreaking capabilities of its own with Choice Specs and Calm Mind, allowing it to get rid of physical walls to increase Baxcalibur's threatening potential. Gholdengo and Volcarona are great teammates that provide Fairy and Fighting resistances and the ability to check and threaten the likes of Iron Valiant and Corviknight. Furthermore, Gholdengo is able to threaten the Fairy-types and Tera Fairy users in the tier such as Hatterene, Skeledirge, and Garganacl, freeing up Baxcalibur to pressure the foes with Glaive Rush, while Volcarona can utilize Baxcalibur's presence to remove its special checks like Clodsire and Blissey to sweep late-game more easily. Slowking is another good pairing that can set up Snow and pivot with Chilly Reception, consequently boosting Baxcalibur's already decent bulk.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Gholdengo utilizes everything that makes it so threatening: its fantastic ability, typing, movepool, and stats, maximizing its potential as a wallbreaker. By running its two strongest STAB moves along with Nasty Plot and Recover, Gholdengo takes advantage of both its offensive and defensive capabilities. Covert Cloak is most useful to block the residual damage from Garganacl's Salt Cure, while Heavy-Duty Boots negates the chip damage Gholdengo would take from switching into Spikes and Stealth Rock. Tera Fighting is the best choice defensively, removing the threat of a super effective hit from Dragapult or opposing Gholdengo's Shadow Ball, resisting Dark-type moves from Kingambit, Hydreigon, and Roaring Moon, and lessening the chip damage from Salt Cure if running Heavy-Duty Boots. Tera Steel preserves Steel-type's defensive qualities while boosting its Make It Rain.</p> <p>As a wallbreaker, Gholdengo is most useful on balance and bulky offense teams. It benefits from entry hazards significantly to help chip down opposing Pokemon, making entry hazard setters like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu great teammates; in return, Gholdengo is able to keep their entry hazards up by blocking Defog with Good as Gold. In addition, Pokemon like offensive Great Tusk, Iron Moth, and Dragonite appreciate entry hazards staying up, and they'll return the favor by checking other threats, like Great Tusk checking Kingambit. Physical attackers like Choice Band Dragapult, Cinderace, and Roaring Moon help cover Gholdengo's weakness to specially defensive Pokemon like Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire. Ting-Lu in particular can be tough to break through; having a dedicated check like Choice Band Zamazenta is helpful. Gholdengo can cover for some of their weaknesses as well, breaking through walls like Toxapex and Garganacl and switching into status from Rotom-W. Faster Pokemon, such as Cinderace and Dragapult, as well as revenge killers like Kingambit prevent Gholdengo from setting up and can quickly KO it; having defensive teammates like Clodsire, Dondozo, and Garganacl to take some of the heat off is extremely useful. Assault Vest Azumarill is a strong specially defensive option to help Gholdengo deal with Walking Wake.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Gholdengo utilizes its high Special Attack and its great offensive typing to become a fast revenge killer. Gholdengo can effectively hit offensive threats such as Dragapult and Iron Valiant with its STAB moves. Trick allows Gholdengo to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Dondozo, Corviknight, and Clodsire. Its typing also allows it to switch into foes such as Iron Valiant and Iron Hands in a pinch, as it either resists or is immune to most of their attacks. Focus Blast is ideal for Gholdengo to hit Kingambit and other foes such as a weakened Ting-Lu, but Nasty Plot can be run instead to take advantage of stopping defensive Pokemon with Trick and having a free turn to set up and do a great amount of damage. Recover can also be run, taking a more defensive approach to give Gholdengo a free turn to heal. Gholdengo prefers Fighting as a Tera type, as it removes its prior weaknesses, meaning it is not threatened by Kingambit's Sucker Punch or Skeledirge's Torch Song. It also boosts the power of Focus Blast, reliably removing the former. To counter different foes, Gholdengo can instead opt for Tera Flying to have better ground against Great Tusk and Iron Treads.</p> <p>Teammates such as Kingambit and Iron Valiant appreciate Gholdengo's offensive pressure, as it can help against shared checks such as Great Tusk and Amoonguss. With this role, Gholdengo prefers to have a clean switch after a teammate has fainted in order to pressure the opponent. Similarly, entry hazard setters such as Garchomp, Garganacl, and Ting-Lu appreciate Gholdengo for its Good as Gold ability and its Ghost typing, preventing all forms of hazard removal excluding Court Change. Gholdengo is mainly vulnerable to priority moves such as Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Dragonite also presents an issue for it with Multiscale in conjunction with Earthquake, not to mention it can set up twice in front of Gholdengo. This can be avoided with a carefully timed Trick or help from defensive Great Tusk and Skeledirge. Similarly, depending on its Choice lock, Roaring Moon and Cinderace can take advantage of Gholdengo with Crunch and Sucker Punch, respectively. As a result of this, Garchomp and Garganacl pair well with Gholdengo, acting as a defensive backbone with type advantage and great bulk. Iron Valiant can be a great revenge killer against these threats with great Speed and coverage.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Gholdengo is an excellent wallbreaker thanks to its great typing, high damage output, and good utility movepool. Make It Rain is Gholdengo's strongest viable attack, OHKOing Pokemon like Garganacl, Hisuian Zoroark, Great Tusk, and Scream Tail. Shadow Ball offers great coverage, hitting foes that resist Make It Rain such as Toxapex, Corviknight, Rotom-W, Slowking, Skeledirge, and opposing Gholdengo. Focus Blast offers crucial coverage against Kingambit, which resists both of Gholdengo's STAB moves. Recover, on the other hand, can keep Gholdengo healthy throughout the game, and it can be freely used once Gholdengo lands Trick and loses its Choice Specs. Trick allows Gholdengo to cripple special walls like Clodsire with a Choice lock, consequently making them much easier to wear down or pivot around throughout the game. A Timid nature lets Gholdengo outspeed Dragonite and, at worst, Speed tie with opposing Gholdengo. Tera Fighting has excellent synergy with Gholdengo's Ghost typing, turning its weakness to Dark-type attacks like Kingambit's Sucker Punch into a resistance, and the STAB boost to Focus Blast greatly helps in dealing with Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon, which can otherwise check Gholdengo if they remain healthy. Tera Steel is a valid alternative that dramatically powers up Make it Rain—which becomes so ludicrously strong, it even 2HKOes Clodsire—while preserving the Steel type's great defensive profile. Also, keeping Steel while removing Gholdengo's Ghost and Dark weaknesses can prove useful against Dragapult, Meowscarada, and opposing Gholdengo.</p> <p>Choice Specs Gholdengo's immediate power and valuable defensive utility give it a solid place on an array of bulkier offensive teams, punching holes for an array of sweepers later in the game, and these teams' stronger defensive backbones give Gholdengo more opportunities to come in and hit hard. Ting-Lu can sponge Ghost- and Dark-type attacks, like Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave and Shadow Ball from Dragapult, Hisuian Zoroark, and opposing Gholdengo. It can also force progress with entry hazard damage alongside Whirlwind, giving Gholdengo an easier time breaking past teams' defensive cores. In return, Gholdengo can block Rapid Spin and Defog to ensure that Ting-Lu's entry hazards remain active, and it handles threats like Breloom and Iron Valiant, which Ting-Lu struggles against. Other hazard setters like Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Glimmora similarly appreciate Gholdengo's blocking of all forms of hazard removal. Roaring Moon also has great synergy with Gholdengo, which can deal with attacks like Iron Valiant's Moonblast and Close Combat, Hatterene's Dazzling Gleam, and Great Tusk's Close Combat and Ice Spinner, while Roaring Moon can handle Fire-type attacks from Iron Moth. Choice Specs Gholdengo's high immediate power puts a great deal of pressure on physically bulky foes like Garganacl, Skeledirge, and Dondozo, which can open up opportunities for Roaring Moon to sweep unimpaired. Swords Dance Iron Valiant can handle Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, and Dragapult for Gholdengo, while Gholdengo can wear down or eliminate Unaware Skeledirge and Dondozo to let Iron Valiant sweep. Faster Ghost-types like Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark pair well with Gholdengo, as they can wear down and eventually overwhelm their shared checks, like Ting-Lu and Assault Vest Azumarill, with their solid coverage. Hisuian Zoroark in particular is an excellent teammate: it shares Gholdengo's access to Shadow Ball, Focus Blast, and Nasty Plot to bluff numerous Gholdengo sets with Illusion, provides a crucial Ghost immunity to deter opposing Ghost-type attacks, and has a much better Speed stat to catch opponents off-guard. For facing Dragapult, Hisuian Zoroark is immune to Ghost while Gholdengo resists Dragon, and both can OHKO Dragapult if it incorrectly predicts which Pokemon it's facing.</p> "

        "name": "Air Balloon",
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its great typing and Good as Gold, Gholdengo is a setup sweeper that's notably difficult to deal with. Having an additional Ground immunity with Air Balloon further improves Gholdengo's already great typing, letting it switch in on Pokemon that otherwise threaten it, such as Garchomp and Iron Treads. This is especially useful against the latter, as Air Balloon strengthens Gholdengo's ability to block entry hazard removal. Maximum Speed investment is for outspeeding Dragonite and uninvested Great Tusk. 252 Special Attack EVs and Nasty Plot makes Gholdengo's STAB moves very threatening against neutral foes. Fighting and Dark Tera types give Gholdengo the option to Terastallize defensively; notably, Tera Fighting lessens the impact of moves like Crunch from Roaring Moon. Tera Dark is useful in a pinch to resist attacks such as Shadow Ball from Dragapult and opposing Gholdengo.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters like Great Tusk and Glimmora are the most profitable teammates for Gholdengo, as its ability and typing ensure that their entry hazards stay around as long as Gholdengo does.

Offensive Pokemon that outspeed and OHKO Gholdengo, such as Cinderace, Roaring Moon, and Knock Off variants of Great Tusk, threaten to completely shut down Gholdengo; defensive teammates like Garganacl, Dondozo and Skeledirge can help mitigate some of these weaknesses.</p> "

It can switch into several key offensive threats such as Iron Valiant, Scizor and Breloom and completely shut down multiple defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Corviknight. With Good as Gold, Gholdengo can act as a reliable means of spinblocking and denying Defog. Recover provides Gholdengo with a means of improving its longevity, letting it switch into the aforementioned threats multiple times throughout a match. Thunder Wave allows Gholdengo to cripple threats it can lure in, like Iron Moth and Roaring Moon. Gholdengo can capitalize on the status it spreads with Hex, letting it deal high damage once its targets have been paralyzed. Gholdengo can take advantage of switches it forces by setting up Nasty Plot, letting it exert a high offensive threat level, and enabling it to win potential stalemates against bulkier Pokemon such as Corviknight and Dondozo. Alternatively, Make It Rain can be used to immediately KO Garganacl and Iron Valiant. Tera Flying improves Gholdengo's matchups against Ground-types like Great Tusk and Iron Treads. This completely flips the matchup in Gholdengo's favor, as it can use them as a point of entry to set up Nasty Plot. Tera Fairy, on the other hand, grants Gholdengo a resistance to Dark-type attacks, allowing it to survive Crunch from Roaring Moon and paralyze it with Thunder Wave. Gholdengo's item choice is quite flexible and largely depends on its team structure. Leftovers offers passive recovery, which is quite valuable to preserve Recover PP. Covert Cloak grants Gholdengo an immunity to the secondary effects of various moves, allowing it to counter Garganacl by nullifying the chip damage from Salt Cure. It is also useful to allow Gholdengo to switch into a wider pool of moves, like Hatterene's Nuzzle, with far less risk. Heavy-Duty Boots nullifies entry hazard damage, allowing Gholdengo to switch in and out with little issue. A physically defensive EV spread allows Gholdengo to more reliably check Pokemon such as Garganacl, Corviknight, and Scizor.</p> <p>Defensive Gholdengo fits on a variety of teams, but it particularly shines on balance and stall teams. Its ability to nullify most forms of hazard control is most useful to entry hazard setters such as Garchomp, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. These Pokemon also appreciate Gholdengo's ability to check Hatterene, which can bounce back hazards with Magic Bounce. If Gholdengo is utilizing Covert Cloak, it will be a great teammate to Pokemon like Dondozo, Toxapex, and Corviknight, which struggle against Garganacl due to Salt Cure. Gholdengo can pivot into many key status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and is therefore a great ally to Pokemon that are common targets of them, such as Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Meowscarada. When not running Tera Flying, Ground-types like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire can use Gholdengo as an entry point to either deal high damage to it with Earthquake or set up entry hazards. Corviknight is thus a great partner, as it can switch into them with ease and clear entry hazards they may set up with Defog. Hatterene is another good teammate, since it can completely shut down attempts to set up entry hazards with Magic Bounce. Gholdengo is also quite vulnerable to a few other offensive threats, such as Cinderace and Kingambit, so bulky Water-types like Dondozo and Toxpaex can switch into these Pokemon and prevent setup via Unaware and Haze, respectively, which Gholdengo will greatly appreciate. Garchomp and Great Tusk can switch into Cinderace and Kingambit and threaten them out with Earthquake, and they can also benefit from Gholdengo's Thunder Wave support, allowing them to more reliably check Cinderace and Iron Moth.</p> "

It also has a great typing that lets it answer threats such as Gholdengo, Choice Specs Dragapult, Iron Moth, and Ceruledge. Whirlwind is incredibly useful for thwarting setup Pokemon like Roaring Moon, Cresselia, and Dragonite. Ruination lets Ting-Lu deal consistent damage to bulky Pokemon like Corviknight, Rotom-W, and Hatterene. Stone Edge allows Ting-Lu to hit Zapdos, Enamorus, and Moltres super effectively, as they can otherwise come in somewhat safely against it and use Roost to heal off any damage from Ruination. Rest is an option on bulkier structures like stall teams to give Ting-Lu much-needed recovery. Tera Poison lets Ting-Lu act as an answer to Iron Valiant while giving it an immunity to poison damage from Clodsire’s Toxic and letting it absorb Toxic Spikes from the likes of Glimmora and Iron Moth. Meanwhile, Tera Fairy is a generally solid defensive typing, letting it more reliably check Pokemon such as Dragapult and Great Tusk. Aside from granting a Fighting immunity, Tera Ghost allows Ting-Lu to spinblock foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads, which is especially important if running both entry hazards. If so, Heavy Slam should be used over Earthquake to threaten Hatterene better, which would otherwise block them due to Magic Bounce, while hitting Enamorus more consistently. Red Card is an alternative over Leftovers on more offensive teams that can forgo the recovery; Ting-Lu's astronomical overall bulk allows it to take a single strong hit in a pinch—even super effective attacks such as from Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Enamorus—and phaze them, preventing its team from being swept by opposing offensive threats.</p> <p>Ting-Lu’s premier defensive profile makes it most proficient on bulky offense and balance teams that can supply enough offensive momentum to make up for Ting-Lu’s relative passivity. Pokemon that can supplement offensive prowess to make up for Ting-Lu's passivity such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant and Kingambit make for excellent partners, as they can assist against threats like opposing Iron Valiant, Dondozo, and Great Tusk. Without Ruination, Ting-Lu is utterly helpless against Corviknight, so Pokemon that can threaten it such as Gholdengo, Zapdos, and Cinderace make for excellent partners. Bulky Water-types like Dondozo and Toxapex appreciate Ting-Lu's immunity to Electric while being quite helpful against Pokemon like Kingambit and Quaquaval in return. Other defensive Pokemon like Garganacl and Corviknight also make for excellent partners, being helpful against Pokemon like Scizor while appreciating Ting-Lu’s ability to check Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult. Additional entry hazard setters such as Hisuian Samurott, Garganacl, Landorus-T, and Great Tusk allow Ting-Lu to fit Ruination or Stone Edge into its moveset more capably, so it is less passive in the face of Ground-immune threats like Corviknight, Zapdos, Moltres, and Air Balloon Gholdengo.</p> "

Acrobatics has fantastic coverage, as it hits Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and Amoonguss super effectively, and should always be run alongside Tera Flying to maximize its power. Tera Blast alongside Tera Fairy, though more situational, gives Roaring Moon both a strong defensive typing and an effective means of dealing with threats like Ting-Lu, Dragonite, and opposing Roaring Moon. Tera Flying removes all of Roaring Moon's baseline weaknesses bar Ice and gives it a resistance to Fighting- and Bug-type attacks, a Ground immunity, and a STAB boost to Acrobatics. Stone Edge can be considered to handle Zapdos and Moltres without the risk of making contact and crippling Roaring Moon with Static and Flame Body while Brick Break reliably OHKOs Kingambit and improves Roaring Moon's matchup against opposing Dual Screens teams, but these options are situational. A Jolly nature is typically run to outspeed Booster Energy Iron Valiant after a Dragon Dance, but Adamant is a decent alternative, particularly on teams that allow Roaring Moon to obtain more than one Dragon Dance boost. After a Dragon Dance, Adamant Roaring Moon can more easily OHKO defensive variants of Gholdengo and Great Tusk. An alternate spread of 32 HP / 220 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe alongside a Jolly nature can be considered to give Roaring Moon a Speed boost from Protosynthesis; though this comes at a noticeable loss of power, the immediate boost to Roaring Moon's Speed can dramatically improve its matchup against faster offensive threats such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Greninja that it would have a very difficult time setting up against normally.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Roaring Moon best functions on offensive teams, pairing well with setup sweepers that can wear down each other's checks. Iron Valiant and Agility Walking Wake appreciate Roaring Moon's ability to threaten Clodsire, and can sweep once Roaring Moon breaks past it for them. Dondozo and Tera Fairy Skeledirge are major threats to Roaring Moon due to their ability to ignore its boosts with Unaware, while strong priority users like Dragonite and Kingambit can revenge kill a weakened Roaring Moon thanks to its low Defense. Ting-Lu can force Roaring Moon out with Whirlwind, and Choice Band Zamazenta can survive a hit from Roaring Moon and OHKO it in return. Mixed and special Iron Valiant sets offer immediate damage against Dondozo, Iron Valiant and Ting-Lu due to their excellent coverage, and Iron Moth can muscle past Tera Fairy Skeledirge and Dondozo with a combiantion of Sludge Wave and Energy Ball. Offensive Great Tusk and Battle Bond Greninja can help wear down Ting-Lu with their super effective STAB moves, and Greninja's Grass Knot can muscle past Dondozo. Dual Screens and Aurora Veil setters like Dragapult, Grimmsnarl, and Alolan Ninetales can allow Roaring Moon to set up multiple Dragon Dances and survive priority attacks from Dragonite and Kingambit much more easily, turning it into an extremely dangerous wincon.

Trick is another option to cripple common switch-ins such as Clodsire, Skeledirge, and Toxapex. Focus Blast threatens an OHKO on Garganacl while greatly damaging Corviknight. However, Aura Sphere is another option that is more consistent thanks to its accuracy, though it misses out on the damage output of Focus Blast. Tera Fairy powers up Moonblast and removes Iron Valiant's weakness to Fairy-, Psychic-, and Flying-type attacks. Alternatively, Tera Ghost makes Iron Valiant immune to Dragonite's Extreme Speed, allows it to OHKO Gholdengo, and increases its damage output against Skeledirge. Tera Electric is a final option to OHKO Toxapex and physically defensive Corviknight and turn its Steel-type weakness into a resistance.</p> <p>Physically offensive Pokemon such as Dragonite, Kingambit, and Cinderace benefit from Iron Valiant, as they struggle against Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Rotom-W, all of which Iron Valiant can pressure effectively. Entry hazard support from partners like Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Garchomp provides chip damage against Pokemon that try to play around Iron Valiant such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Clodsire. Pivots such as Rotom-W, Dragapult, Cinderace, and Corviknight give Iron Valiant opportunities to get on the field, reducing the risk of it taking damage. Iron Valiant enjoys the presence of partners that it can rely on to take hits, such as Toxapex, Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl, due to its frailty. Keeping the field free from hazards grants Iron Valiant more chances to get on the field and make progress, so teammates with access to Rapid Spin or Defog such as Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Corviknight are appreciated.</p> "

        "description": "<p>High attacking stats and a wide array of coverage moves make Iron Valiant a devastating mixed attacker that can 2HKO common defensive walls physically and specially; Moonblast and Thunderbolt threaten physically defensive Pokemon like Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Dondozo, while Close Combat and Psyshock deal with specially defensive foes like Ting-Lu and Clodsire. Its Quark Drive-boosted Speed from Booster Energy turns it into a potent late-game cleaner, letting it outspeed would-be revenge killers like Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo, which is further enforced by its unique typing that resists Sucker Punch from Kingambit. However, it can also be used to revenge kill boosted threats like Dragonite in a pinch, especially since Iron Valiant can take on Dragonite's +1 Tera Normal Extreme Speed from full health. Tera Fairy boosts Iron Valiant's Moonblast while still retaining its defensive profile to take on Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Tera Electric amplifies Thunderbolt's damage, notably allowing it to 2HKO would-be checks like Toxapex, specially defensive Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl, and offensive Gholdengo after Stealth Rock, as well as preventing Iron Valiant from being revenge killed by Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> <p>Mixed Iron Valiant is commonly seen on offense and bulky offense teams. Due to the lack of a damage boosting item or setup move, it can still fall short of threatening bulky Pokemon like Amoonguss, and without Shadow Ball or Knock Off, Skeledirge and defensive Gholdengo as well; thus, Pokemon that can deal with them such as Great Tusk, and Kingambit make good teammates. Particularly, the aforementioned Pokemon can overwhelm a shared check in Corviknight and are generally effective as early-game wallbreakers that can open up Iron Valiant to clean up late-game easily. Entry hazards from teammates like Garchomp, Ting-Lu, and Glimmora can chip down foes like Garganacl, Amoonguss, and Tera Grass Dondozo. A sturdy defensive backbone with the likes of Corviknight and Ting-Lu can help check offensive threats that threaten Iron Valiant out, such as a boosted Roaring Moon, opposing Iron Valiant, and Gholdengo. Pivots like Dragapult, Scizor, and Rotom-W can compensate for Iron Valiant's lack of bulk by bringing it in safely on foes like Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Blissey, respectively; the latter can also cripple Amoonguss with either Trick or Will-O-Wisp. Gholdengo is a great partner, as it reliably prevents the much-needed entry hazards from being removed by Rapid Spin and Defog, threatens Skeledirge and Tera Fairy Garganacl, and appreciates Iron Valiant dealing with foes like Corviknight and Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon in return.</p> "

After a Quark Drive boost, Iron Valiant outspeeds and OHKOes a plethora of premier offensive threats in the tier, such as Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon. Thunderbolt allows Iron Valiant to damage Corviknight and bulky Water-types like Dondozo, Azumarill, Toxapex, and Tera Water Garganacl, while Shadow Ball threatens Hatterene, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge. Psyshock scores a 2HKO on any Clodsire looking to stop Iron Valiant's sweep. With Calm Mind, Iron Valiant can switch roles from an endgame sweeper to a powerful wallbreaker. After one Calm Mind, Moonblast 2HKOes defensive Garganacl, and +1 Tera Electric Thunderbolt 2HKOes specially defensive Slowking and OHKOes Corviknight. Tera Fairy powers up Moonblast, which can now 2HKO Garganacl and Hatterene. Tera Electric boosts the power of Thunderbolt, which secures important 2HKOs on specially defensive Dondozo, Corviknight, and Toxapex, lets Iron Valiant survive Scizor's Bullet Punch, and grants Iron Valiant an immunity to paralysis from Hatterene's Nuzzle. Tera Ghost boosts Iron Valiant's Shadow Ball, letting it 2HKO specially defensive Skeledirge, and prevents revenge killing attempts from Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Iron Valiant relies heavily on its super-effective coverage moves for damage output. As a result, it struggles to make progress against Pokemon like Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and Scizor. Thus, teammates like Clodsire and Ting-Lu are good defensive partners for Iron Valiant, with the added benefit of being able to set up entry hazards. Iron Moth has strong offensive synergy with Iron Valiant, being able to threaten Amoonguss, Iron Treads, and Tera Fairy Garganacl, while also being able to chip down special walls like Clodsire. On offense teams, Iron Valiant complements powerful wallbreakers like Nasty Plot Gholdengo, and Kingambit, since they can overwhelm defensive cores and open up the path for Iron Valiant to sweep. Finally, Iron Valiant is highly reliant on Booster Energy to sweep, as it cannot normally outspeed common revenge-killers like Dragapult, Cinderace, and Meowscarada. Therefore, it is important to time when to switch in to Iron Valiant to ensure defensive counters like Skeledirge are either removed or heavily damaged so it can sweep or break through the opposing team effectively. Along these lines, it is important to conserve Iron Valiant's health, since it can survive key priority moves such as Extreme Speed from Tera Normal Dragonite after a Dragon Dance. Therefore, Pokemon that can remove entry hazards, such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads, are great teammates for Iron Valiant.</p> "

Choice Scarf allows Iron Valiant to outspeed faster Pokemon such as Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, Dragapult, and Greninja and threaten an OHKO with Moonblast. Close Combat targets Steel-types such as Kingambit and Iron Treads. Knock Off hits Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Iron Moth for super effective damage while also crippling other Pokemon that resist both of its STAB moves such as Iron Moth and Moltres. Trick can be used to cripple walls such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Clodsire. Maximum Special Attack allows Iron Valiant's Moonblast to OHKO Great Tusk and Walking Wake. Tera Fairy powers up Moonblast, letting it secure OHKOs against Garchomp and Zamazenta. Alternatively, Tera Ghost makes it easier for Iron Valiant to revenge kill Dragonite thanks to its immunity to Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Iron Valiant can be found on bulky offense teams that appreciate the speed it provides. It can take advantage of Slowking's Future Sight, as Steel- and Dark-types that resist or are immune to it are threatened by Close Combat, while Future Sight hits Iron Valiant's switch-ins such as Amoonguss and Toxapex for super effective damage. Pokemon weak to Dark-type attacks such as Skeledirge, Dragapult, and Gholdengo appreciate Iron Valiant's resistance to said attacks, particularly Sucker Punch from Kingambit, and ability to threaten said Dark-types with either one of its STAB moves. Great Tusk provides entry hazard removal, preventing Iron Valiant from getting chipped throughout the game, and complements Iron Valiant to make for a sturdy duo against Kingambit, which often times Terastallizes to deal with either one of them but has a harder time dealing with both. Corviknight in particular resists all of the attacks that Iron Valiant is weak to, while other walls such as Skeledirge and Clodsire can sponge Fairy- and Poison-type hits.</p> "

Liquidation is a crucial coverage move to hit most of its would-be checks such as Iron Moth, Skeledirge, and Unaware Clodsire. It is also a strong neutral attack against Gholdengo and Hatterene, as well as hitting defensive Great Tusk super effectively. Both Knock Off and Spirit Break help Iron Valiant in hitting Dragapult; Knock Off also provides great neutral coverage against Toxapex and Amoonguss, crippling them as well as other bulky foes such as Dondozo and Tera Fairy Garganacl, while Spirit Break covers Dragonite, Azumarill, and Tera Dragon Dondozo. Taunt prevents the recovery, status, Haze, and Defense-boosting attempts of defensive stalwarts such as Toxapex, Dondozo, Tera Water Skeledirge, and Tera Fairy Garganacl, letting Iron Valiant muscle past them much more easily. Tera Water is mainly used to amplify Iron Valiant's Liquidation, notably netting the OHKO on Gholdengo at +2 as well as 2HKO on Skeledirge, the latter of which would otherwise ignore Iron Valiant's Swords Dance boost with Unaware. Defensively, the Water typing helps Taunt variants beat Toxapex and Skeledirge one-on-one due to resisting their Surf and Torch Song, allows Iron Valiant to set up on Gholdengo's Make it Rain, and prevents it from being revenge killed by Scizor's Bullet Punch and Azumarill's Aqua Jet easily.</p> <p>Swords Dance Iron Valiant finds a place on offense and hyper offense teams.

Other setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Kingambit, and Agility Walking Wake are great teammates to keep up the offensive pressure against the opposition, especially as they appreciate Iron Valiant crippling Toxapex with Knock Off as well as luring in and beating Clodsire and Skeledirge for them. Early-game wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Gholdengo and Greninja are similarly important to punch holes in the opposition, notably pressuring foes like Amoonguss and Dondozo that Iron Valiant has trouble breaking through.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Walking Wake is a powerful wallbreaker thanks to its great Special Attack and Speed alongside an excellent typing complemented by decent bulk, fantastic STAB moves, and good coverage. Hydro Steam is Walking Wake's excellent signature move; in addition to having zero drawbacks its power is increased with sun active, making safely switching into Walking Wake a difficult task. Flamethrower hits Grass-types like Amoonguss, and Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Corviknight for super effective damage. Draco Meteor is Walking Wake's strongest attack and eliminates Dragapult, Dragonite, opposing Walking Wake, and Roaring Moon while dealing high damage to Water-types like Toxapex and muscling past Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Dondozo. Dragon Pulse is a weaker but safer move that still hits opposing Dragon-types hard and lacks drawbacks, which makes it more useful late-game when Draco Meteor's higher damage output is no longer needed to secure KOs. Tera Water removes Walking Wake's Fairy weakness while increasing Hydro Steam's damage output to nuclear levels, allowing it to outright 2HKO moderately bulky Water-resistant Pokemon like Rotom-W. Tera Dragon turns Walking Wake's Grass neutrality into a resistance while allowing it to 2HKO Clodsire and Slowking, allowing Walking Wake to blow past its checks and more reliably sweep late-game. 244 Special Attack EVs put Walking Wake's Special Attack exactly one point lower than its Speed, causing Protosynthesis to increase Speed and drastically improve Walking Wake's matchup against otherwise-faster threats like Meowscarada, Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Roaring Moon; however, 252 Special Attack EVs to allow a Special Attack boost from Protosynthesis is still perfectly viable to further capitalize on Walking Wake's wallbreaking prowess, albeit at the cost of now losing the one-on-one matchup against the aforementioned faster threats. Even Assault Vest Azumarill, which otherwise checks Walking Wake, has a chance of being 2HKOed by a sun-boosted Tera Water Hydro Steam with a Special Attack boost.</p> <p>Though its offensive presence is useful in general, Walking Wake's unique attributes make it most powerful on and against sun teams. Torkoal is an excellent partner for Walking Wake, as its ability to set sun with Drought maximizes its damage output with Hydro Steam and Flamethrower and enables its Protosynthesis to boost its Speed or Special Attack. Torkoal can also set Stealth Rock to allow Walking Wake to more reliably 2HKO threats like Clodsire and Toxapex and remove opposing Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin, and it appreciates Walking Wake’s ability to break past opposing weather setters like Tyranitar and Pelipper with ease. Specially defensive walls like Slowking and Water Absorb Clodsire give Walking Wake a lot of trouble, since they can sponge its attacks. Powerful physical attackers like offensive Great Tusk and Choice Band Roaring Moon are excellent teammates due to their ability to muscle past these threats; in return, Walking Wake breaks past their own defensive checks such as Ting-Lu, Dondozo, and Corviknight. Moreover, both of these teammates can also utilize Protosynthesis effectively. Assault Vest Azumarill resists both Hydro Steam and Flamethrower, is immune to Walking Wake's Dragon-type attacks, and threatens to OHKO it with Play Rough, though it can be worn down over time due to its lack of recovery. Offensive Grass-types like Meowscarada and Breloom cannot switch into Azumarill, but they can greatly threaten it with their super effective STAB moves. Eject Button Amoonguss is another excellent teammate, as it checks Azumarill both offensively and defensively and can safely pivot Walking Wake in. In return, Walking Wake can handle bulky Steel-types like Kingambit and Corviknight for Meowscarada and Gholdengo for Breloom and Amoonguss.</p> "

After a single boost, not only can it outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, but also boosted Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Roaring Moon. Its STAB combination threatens metagame staples like Great Tusk, Dragapult, Roaring Moon, and Garganacl. Hydro Steam is preferred over Surf if Walking Wake is used on sun teams. Substitute is an option to protect Walking Wake from revenge killing attempts like Kingambit's Sucker Punch and status moves like Amoonguss's Spore. With Flamethrower as coverage, it can also threaten the likes of Gholdengo, Amoonguss, and Corviknight harder. Tera Water makes Surf and Hydro Steam a nuke, especially on the respective weather teams. Tera Dragon boosts Dragon Pulse, allowing Walking Wake to 2HKO specially defensive Rotom-W. Tera Fairy turns Walking Wake's Dragon weakness into an immunity, improving its matchup against various Dragon-types like Choice Band Roaring Moon and Dragapult, and gives it a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Breloom's Mach Punch.</p> <p>Walking Wake best functions on hyper offense, sun, and rain teams. In order to sweep more efficiently, it appreciates entry hazards from Greninja, Meowscarada, and Glimmora. In return, Walking Wake can threaten common hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight. On weather teams, Torkoal and Pelipper make for necessary teammates, as they can set up sun and rain to boost its Hydro Steam. Sun from Torkoal in particular allows Walking Wake to activate Protosynthesis multiple times and boost its Flamethrower. Walking Wake gets forced out by specially defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Toxapex; hence, wallbreakers that can wear them down such as Breloom, Meowscarada, and Choice Specs Dragapult are appreciated. Great Tusk is another good teammate, as it can remove entry hazards for Walking Wake to switch in without getting worn down. In return, Walking Wake can threaten spinblockers like Gholdengo and Hisuian Zoroark after an Agility. Lastly, Walking Wake pairs well with other sweepers like Iron Moth and Kingambit, as they can pressure each other's checks; Walking Wake can deal with Great Tusk for Kingambit and Garganacl and Ting-Lu for Iron Moth. In return, Kingambit can threaten Toxapex, while Iron Moth can threaten Hatterene.</p> "

Substitute relieves the need for prediction, protects Walking Wake from revenge killing attempts, and allows it to avoid residual damage from Garganacl's Salt Cure. Hydro Steam's power boost in sun makes it desirable both on and against sun teams. If this attribute is not sought after, then Hydro Pump can be run instead. Roar prevents Pokemon like Terastallized Garganacl as well as Belly Drum Azumarill from setting up on Walking Wake. It is also a good way for Walking Wake to make progress via residual entry hazard damage even when the opposition has a counter like Water Absorb Clodsire, Assault Vest Toxapex, or specially defensive Dondozo. However, Flamethrower can be used instead to round out Walking Wake's coverage, doing more damage to Pokemon like Kingambit, Amoonguss, and Corviknight. Flamethrower also gains a boost in power from sun, which alongside the Protosynthesis boost can allow Flamethrower to OHKO the aforementioned targets. Tera Water increases the damage output of its Water-type STAB move, potentially 2HKOing Pokemon like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Corviknight. Tera Dragon powers up Dragon Pulse, allowing it to OHKO Garchomp and Hydreigon. Finally, Tera Fairy removes Walking Wake's original weaknesses, allowing for surprise KOs on Dragon-types like opposing Walking Wake and especially Dragapult—a thorn in Walking Wake's side because of Infilitrator nullifying Substitute—as well as others like Kingambit and Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Walking Wake is a sun team staple, so of course it is often paired with other sun team staples like Torkoal and Eject Button Hatterene. Torkoal sets sun with Drought, which gives Walking Wake a boost to its Special Attack and makes it an even more threatening wallbreaker. Torkoal is also good at forcing switches with Yawn, which gives Walking Wake opportunities to come in. Hatterene also provides a switch-in opportunity thanks to Eject Button, and it can also regenerate Walking Wake with Healing Wish, giving it more chances to wallbreak. Both can prevent irksome entry hazards either via Rapid Spin or Magic Bounce, a valuable attribute, as damage inflicted by hazards, most notably Toxic Spikes, limits Walking Wake's wallbreaking potential. Because Dragapult is such an issue for this set, Pokemon that can take advantage of it like Kingambit, Iron Valiant, and Ting-Lu are good partners for Walking Wake. Walking Wake has numerous roadblocks that stop it from making much progress like Water Absorb Clodsire, Assault Vest Toxapex, and Slowking; additional wallbreakers like Great Tusk, Roaring Moon, and mixed Garchomp to smash through them are appreciated. Hazard setters like the aforementioned Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Torkoal are indispensable as allies, for their hazards wear down checks and punish forced switches, be it through threatening the opposition or by phazing via Roar.</p> "
