Moltres gets many free turns over the course of a game thanks to the many Pokemon it forces out, which makes U-turn a fantastic tool for pivoting and gaining momentum while also ensuring that Moltres is not passive against Pokemon such as Heatran and Ting-Lu. Hurricane is an alternative that can OHKO Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Sneasler and 2HKO Zamazenta. 12 Speed EVs allows Moltres to outspeed Jolly Kingambit. Tera Fairy removes all of Moltres' previous weaknesses and strengthen its matchup against Kingambit and Roaring Moon. Alternatively, Tera Water is a solid defensive type that also improves Moltres's rain matchup allowing it to live rain-boosted Tera Water Wave Crash from Floatzel and Basculegion and be able to threaten them back with Will-O-Wisp. 248 Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature can be used instead of the Defense investment and Bold nature to more comfortably take on Enamorus and most special Iron Valiant sets. Great Tusk can form a good core with Moltres thanks to Great Tusk's ability to threaten Moltres's switch-ins, such as Garganacl, Ting-Lu, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran, and remove Stealth Rock if Moltres loses its Heavy-Duty Boots. Ting-Lu can take advantage of Moltres's switch-ins such as Zapdos, Dragapult, and Iron Moth to lay entry hazards while Moltres covers it against Fighting- and Fairy-types such as Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Sneasler. Similarly, Gholdengo handles offensive threats that may overwhelm Moltres, such as pivot Sneasler and Iron Valiant, while Moltres covers it against Cinderace and Kingambit. Setup sweepers such as Kingambit and Iron Valiant can make great use of Moltres's ability to generate free turns by pivoting them into play and spreading burn for easier setup.</p>"

Tera Blast Fairy lets it OHKO Hoopa-U while also being able to net 2HKOs on Kingambit, Assault Vest Hoopa-U, and Dragonite, all after one Nasty Plot boost. Tera Fairy also maintains its Dark resistance while letting it potentially set up in the face of Dragon-type attacks from foes like Dragapult. Alternatively, Hurricane is a strong neutral STAB move that prevents Galarian Moltres form relying too much on Terastallization to function. Tera Dark boosts Fiery Wrath's power, being able to OHKO Assault Vest Galarian Slowking after a Nasty Plot boost and Stealth Rock damage, as well as being able to 2HKO specially defensive Moltres and Assault Vest Toxapex after a Nasty Plot boost. Tera Flying is only to be used if running Hurricane, which can OHKO Zamazenta without a Nasty Plot boost, as well as non-Assault Vest Azumarill and Enamorus after a Nasty Plot boost. Sitrus Berry lets it set up much more easily, and can potentially let it trigger Berserk twice. Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to ignore Stealth Rock. Finally, Weakness Policy is a viable alternative if running dual screens support to take on super effective hits more comfortably. Because of its reliance on setup, Galarian Moltres is best utilized on hyper offense teams. Hence, it appreciates entry hazard support from suicide leads such as Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Meowscarada so that incoming foes can be worn down for Galarian Moltres to clean. Dual screens from Dragapult lets it setup much more easily, esepcially for Weakness Policy variants. Hazard control is a must when running Galarian Moltres due to its vulnerability to Stealth Rock, so it appreciates partners such as Great Tusk and Hatterene with their access to Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce. The two of them can also threaten special walls that can hinder a Galarian Moltres sweep, with Great Tusk being able to OHKO Galarian Slowking and 2HKO Ting-Lu, while Hatterene can 2HKO Clodsire. In return, Galarian Moltres can set up on and threaten Zamazenta for Great Tusk and Gholdengo for Hatterene. Bulky Unaware users such as Dondozo as well as special walls like Garganacl prevent Galarian Moltres from performing its sweep. Hence, offensive Zapdos pairs well with Galarian Moltres, being able to 2HKO both of the aforementioned Pokemon, provided Garganacl is Tera Water. Lastly, Galarian Moltres can facilitate sweeps from physically oriented sweepers like Kingambit by removing obstacles like Great Tusk and Gholdengo.</p>"

Extreme Speed is an excellent move for any physical sweeper, due to its high power and initiative over other priority users such as Kingambit. Earthquake provides coverage against bulky foes such as Toxapex, Garganacl, and Clodsire. Fire Punch OHKOes Scizor and 2HKOes physically defensive Corviknight after a Dragon Dance and Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Ice Spinner hits opposing Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Dragapult super effectively, notably OHKOing Dragapult after a Dragon Dance. Heavy-Duty Boots + Roost improves Dragonite's longevity and possibly enables it to retain Multiscale and obtain multiple boosts; preserving Multiscale is particularly useful for surviving Draco Meteor from Timid Choice Specs Dragapult. Encore can be used to provide setup opportunities and eventually overwhelm bulky Pokemon like Corviknight, Bulk Up Great Tusk, and Curse Garganacl. Tera Normal turns Extreme Speed into an incredibly powerful STAB priority move capable of shredding offensive teams after a single boost, and a timely typing change also removes Dragonite's weaknesses to Ice, Fairy, and Dragon, which can buy a free turn to set up. An Adamant nature is preferred since it maximizes the power of Extreme Speed, which often makes makes Speed stats irrelevant, but a Jolly nature can also be used to outspeed the Normal-immune Dragapult after a Dragon Dance, which is especially useful if Dragonite is running Ice Spinner.</p> <p>Offensive Dragon Dance Dragonite regularly serves as a potent win con on offensive teams that can also act as a revenge killer against fast and frail threats. Multiscale Dragonite's considerable bulk, as well as Ghost immunity with Tera Normal provides significant defensive utility for offensive teams. In particular, teams using frail offensive Pokemon such as Iron Valiant appreciate the defensive utility Dragonite brings. In return, these Pokemon can help wallbreak for a late-game Dragonite sweep. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Glimmora, and Garchomp is appreciated to weaken Pokemon such as Iron Valiant into range of boosted Extreme Speed. Dual screens support from Grimmsnarl is a potential option that can supplement Dragonite's already great bulk and virtually guarantee the ability to acquire multiple boosts. Since Dragonite struggles against bulky Unaware users such as Dondozo and Skeledirge, a teammate that can switch into and check these Pokemon, such as Rotom-W, is appreciated. Rotom-W can cripple these physical walls with Trick, gain momentum against them with Volt Switch, and absorb Will-O-Wisp from Skeledirge.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With the combination of its solid natural bulk, valuable typing, reliable recovery in Roost, and Multiscale, Dragonite can accrue multiple Dragon Dance boosts and become a dangerous bulky setup sweeper. It can set up on common Pokemon such as Great Tusk lacking Bulk Up or Ice Spinner, and even super effective attacks from Iron Valiant and Choice Specs Dragapult thanks to Multiscale. Extreme Speed alongside Tera Normal lets Dragonite clean up late-game, OHKOing faster threats like Meowscarada and potentially Cinderace at +1. It also outprioritizes Meowscarada's Sucker Punch as well as Grimmsnarl's Prankster-boosted Reflect and Thunder Wave. Earthquake covers Normal-resistant and -immune Pokemon, including foes like Dragapult, non-Air Balloon Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Kingambit. 144 HP EVs allow Dragonite to survive Tera Fairy Iron Valiant's Moonblast at +1 through Multiscale. Aside from strengthening Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Tera Normal sheds off its weaknesses to give it setup opportunities against would-be threats like Dragapult and Hatterene. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps Multiscale intact by ignoring Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Bulky Dragon Dance Dragonite fits well on bulky offense. A defensive backbone consisting of Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Gholdengo, and Corviknight is valuable to check threats like Dragapult and Iron Valiant, which would threaten Dragonite prior to boosting; in return, Dragonite can answer threats like Roaring Moon and Cinderace for them. Garchomp, Glimmora, and Ting-Lu can reliably set entry hazards, which rack up chip damage onto walls such as Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Garganacl and puts revenge killers like Iron Valiant into guaranteed KO range of +1 Tera Normal Extreme Speed. Wallbreakers such as Breloom and Great Tusk can punch holes early-game and overwhelm Dragonite's checks, such as Corviknight, Dondozo, Skeledirge, and defensive Great Tusk. Moreover, Breloom can incapacitate foes with Spore to give setup opportunities for Dragonite, while Great Tusk can use Knock Off to cripple Corviknight and Dondozo and pop Gholdengo's Air Balloon.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band makes Dragonite one of the most dangerous wallbreakers in the tier. Unaware users like Dondozo and Skeledirge may switch into Dragonite expecting a Dragon Dance variant but take massive damage from a Choice Band-boosted attack instead. Outrage is an extremely powerful STAB move capable of 2HKOing virtually any Pokemon that does not resist it, which even includes physically defensive walls like Great Tusk and Dondozo. It can also OHKO opposing Dragonite, even with Multiscale intact. Breaking walls is not the only role Dragonite fulfills, as Extreme Speed is a strong priority move that allows it to revenge kill threats like Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon with some prior chip damage, or clean up late-game. Earthquake provides strong coverage, hitting grounded Steel-types like Gholdengo and Kingambit that resist Outrage and Extreme Speed. It's also Dragonite's strongest attack against walls like Garganacl, Toxapex, and Skeledirge to avoid locking it into Outrage. There are a couple of different options for the last moveslot. Fire Punch provides coverage for Corviknight and Tera Steel Rotom-W. Iron Head deals significant damage to Fairy-types like Hatterene and Scream Tail, as well as Tera Fairy users like Garganacl and Skeledirge. Thunder Punch is Dragonite's best option for dealing with Azumarill while also providing coverage for Corviknight. Ice Spinner is another option to hurt the likes of Great Tusk, Garchomp, and opposing Dragonite without locking into Outrage. It also ends Psychic Terrain, which allows Dragonite to use Extreme Speed against grounded Pokemon later on. Multiscale allows Dragonite to take even super effective hits from offensive Pokemon like Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Choice Specs Dragapult and KO them back. Tera Normal makes Extreme Speed even more powerful, OHKOing offensive Volcarona and Iron Moth, and removes Dragonite's usual weaknesses to attacks like Iron Valiant's Moonblast, which can be useful for revenge killing and cleaning.</p> <p>Choice Band Dragonite fits best on mostly offensive teams where it can break holes in the opposing team for its teammates to take advantage of and where its strong priority may be needed against other offensive teams. However, while Choice Band Dragonite is very powerful, it also requires a lot of support. As it is vulnerable to Stealth Rock, not only because Dragonite is weak to it but also because it negates Multiscale, strong entry hazard control is important. This can be in the form of entry hazard removal, such as Rapid Spin Great Tusk, but also in the form of entry hazard prevention, such as Hatterene and Taunt users like Meowscarada and Greninja. Knock Off users like Great Tusk and Meowscarada can remove Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from walls like opposing Great Tusk and Corviknight, which makes them easier to break for Dragonite and keeps Multiscale intact. Switching Dragonite directly into attacks should generally be avoided, since keeping Multiscale intact is desirable, so it appreciates teammates that can bring it in safely. Examples include pivot move users, such as Cinderace, Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Slowking, as well as Eject Button or Eject Pack users, such as Eject Button Hatterene, Eject Pack Great Tusk, and Eject Pack Gholdengo. Physical attackers like Kingambit and Roaring Moon appreciate Dragonite weakening or removing checks like Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Dondozo. On the other hand, special attackers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth can lure in checks like Clodsire and Slowking for Dragonite to punish. Iron Moth has the additional benefit of helping with Dragonite's fourth moveslot issue, as it can threaten Steel-types like Corviknight for Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Fairy-types like Hatterene for Dragonite lacking Iron Head.</p>"

Maximum HP with Sitrus Berry highlights Azumarill’s naturally exceptional defensive typing, allowing it to serve as a one time check to OU staples such as Dragapult, Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake. Belly Drum is an incredibly threatening option that lets Azumarill take advantage of the switches it forces from Pokemon such as Hydreigon to get setup opportunities. It is also a threatening late-game sweeper, as it can outspeed and OHKO defensive walls such as Clodsire, Slowking, and Garganacl while KOing most neutral faster targets such as Gholdengo and Iron Valiant with a +6 Aqua Jet. The threat of Belly Drum also lets Azumarill force uncomfortable mind games against Pokemon it can force out like weakened Great Tusk. Encore can be run over Liquidation to lock foes into undesirable moves to create more setup opportunities; this should be run with maximum Speed investment. Tera Water lets Azumarill OHKO even resisted targets such as Greninja, Meowscarada, and Dragapult with +6 Aqua Jet, as well as OHKOing Amoonguss and KOing Toxapex after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Azumarill serves as a valuable late-game sweeper for offense teams.

Other setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Roaring Moon complement Azumarill, appreciating Azumarill's ability to break Amoonguss and Toxapex and wearing down each other's checks like Dondozo and Skeledirge. Entry hazard support from Pokémon like Glimmora and Garchomp provides the necessary chip damage to turn near OHKOs into true OHKOs on resisted Pokémon such as Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Meowscarada with Tera Water +6 Aqua Jet. Azumarill can pair well with teammates like Grimmsnarl and Orthworm that provide it with more setup opportunities. Pelipper is also a strong partner for Azumarill, as rain provides an extreme damage boost, giving it the ability to avoid needing to Terastallize versus Pokemon such as Toxapex, Dragapult, and Amoonguss.</p>"

Combine that with Huge Power, priority from Aqua Jet, and the boost to STAB that comes from Tera Water, and Azumarill goes from powerful to extremely threatening for any ill-prepared team. Ice Spinner as coverage is useful to hit Amoonguss and Water Absorb Clodsire, while Superpower is an alternative to deal with Steel-types like Kingambit and Orthworm that would be harder to damage without it. 140 Speed EVs allow Azumarill to outspeed Corviknight and Skeledirge. The remaining 116 EVs in HP increase its survivability. This, along with the incredible defensive typing of Water / Fairy protecting it from the many Dragon-type threats roaming the tier, such as Dragapult and Walking Wake, gives it the opportunity to safely switch into many otherwise frightening Pokemon. Tera Water and Fairy are for powering up the Choce Band-boosted STAB attacks Azumarill uses. Tera Water is preferred to get the extra boost to Aqua Jet, but Tera Fairy can also be used to reduce the continual damage from Garganacl's Salt Cure.</p> <p>Choice Band Azumarill is best used on offensive teams and benefits from the support of Pokemon that can open up opportunities for it to break holes. Pokemon like Dragapult and Rotom-W can be excellent teammates by making ample use of pivoting moves throughout a game to let Azumarill in safely. Special attackers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth can be helpful to break through walls like Dondozo that Azumarill would otherwise struggle with. Faster Pokemon like Cinderace and Roaring Moon are useful as speed control to help cover Azumarill's low Speed. Most importantly though, entry hazards help Azumarill wear down tougher foes to be picked off later in the battle, so hazard setters like Great Tusk and Glimmora, as well as spinblockers like Gholdengo, are always appreciated teammates. Defensive Pokemon that have the tools to deal with Azumarill, like Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Dondozo, are the biggest thorns in Azumarill's side. Having another wallbreaker like Dragonite and Tera Electric Iron Valiant on the team can help mitigate some of these issues.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Azumarill leverages its good bulk and typing to check key special attackers such as Walking Wake, Hydreigon, and Greninja while maintaining a powerful offensive presence. An Assault Vest offers a noticeable increase to Azumarill's special bulk, letting it check a wider pool of special attackers such as Hisuian Zoroark and Dragapult while also granting it greater flexibility in its attacking options compared to Choice Band. Liquidation and Play Rough serve as Azumarill's primary STAB attacks, possessing fantastic neutral coverage and hitting many threats such as Dragonite, Walking Wake, and Iron Valiant for super effective damage. Aqua Jet allows Azumarill to revenge kill weakened foes such as Great Tusk and Iron Moth. Ice Spinner is a powerful coverage option, 2HKOing many of Azumarill's common switch-ins such as Amoonguss and Water Absorb Clodsire. Ice Spinner's ability to remove Terrain also makes it particularly useful against opposing Psychic Terrain teams. Tera Water increases the power of Azumarill's Water-type STAB moves, letting it pick off foes such as Iron Moth from higher ranges with Aqua Jet and allowing its Liquidation to 2HKO Hatterene and OHKO offensive Great Tusk. However, Tera Water does come with noticable drawbacks, namely removing Azumarill's immunity to Dragon-type moves and resistances to Fighting- and Dark-type moves, which can make it a shakier check to Walking Wake and Greninja.</p> <p>Assault Vest Azumarill's talents will best be used by more offensive teams looking for a temporary answer to the aforementioned special threats. Partners at risk of being revenge killed by Walking Wake and Iron Valiant, such as Great Tusk and Hydreigon, will greatly appreciate Azumarill's ability to act as a buffer against these Pokemon. Despite Azumarill's good bulk, its tanking prowess can often be undermined by its vulnerability to passive damage from entry hazards and Rocky Helmet. Great Tusk is therefore an excellent partner, providing Rapid Spin support and being able to lure and remove Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Corviknight with Knock Off. Meowscarada is also an excellent ally, being able to shut down opposing entry hazard setters with Taunt while also providing Knock Off support. Furthermore, both Great Tusk and Meowscarada can support Azumarill by laying down entry hazards, which it will greatly appreciate given its ability to force switches. Ting-Lu can similarly lay down multiple layers of entry hazards and ease pressure exerted onto Azumarill in dealing with threats such as Dragapult and Iron Moth. Teammates that can bring Azumarill in safely with a pivoting move, such as Cinderace and Dragapult, are also recommended. Cinderace can assist Azumarill in dealing with entry hazards via Court Change, while Dragapult can deal with Orthworm, which may sometimes use Azumarill as an entry point to pass Shed Tail. In return, Azumarill can check key Pokemon such as Greninja that would threaten them. Azumarill greatly struggles against bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Toxapex, Dondozo, and Tera Water Garganacl. Hydreigon can exploit both Toxapex and Garganacl's passivity to set up with Substitute and Nasty Plot, though it must be wary of switching in against Toxic and Salt Cure. Breloom can pressure Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl with Bullet Seed, while Covert Cloak Gholdengo matches up quite nicely against Garganacl and opposing Breloom and can pivot into Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W.</p>"

Chilly Reception can also be used for cancelling the effects of opposing weather such as rain and sun while also enabling offensive Ice-types due to snow's Defense boost. Surf is its most reliable STAB move, being necessary to sucessfully check Iron Moth and Iron Valiant. Future Sight threatens more defensive teams when paired with physical wallbreakers such as Cinderace, as it threatens opposing defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Amoonguss. Thunder Wave can alternatively be run alongside Surf, preventing Slowking from being setup fodder for Volcarona and Dragonite. Slowking runs maximum Special Defense EVs in order to switch into a variety of other special attackers such as Walking Wake, Rotom-W, Volcarona, and Hatterene. It also lets Slowking make use of Chilly Reception and Thunder Wave for dynamic counterplay. The investment also gives Slowking more opportunities to safely pivot in front of Pokemon that aren't immediately threatening but can beat it long-term, such as Gholdengo, Garganacl, Hisuian Zoroark, and Choice Specs Dragapult. 0 Speed IVs in tandem with a Sassy nature maximize the odds of slow pivoting in front of foes, which is important to nearly guarantee safely bringing in other teammates. Slowking can utilize Tera Water to remove its Bug-, Ghost-, and Dark-type weaknesses, enhancing its matchup against Gholdengo, Dragapult, Greninja, and Volcarona while also allowing it to absorb U-turn better. Additionally, it also boosts Surf's damage output. Tera Fairy turns the tables on Dragapult and Greninja, allowing it to wall their Choice Specs sets reliably.</p> <p>Slowking fits on balance teams due to its exclusive access to Chilly Reception, as they can take advantage of both the snow and momentum generated by it. Slowking enjoys being paired with Pokemon that can generate momentum, such as Cinderace, Rotom-W, and Sandy Shocks. This helps its team to pivot around Garganacl to avoid being worn down by its Salt Cure. Slowking is naturally paired with physically defensive walls with good synergy, such as Great Tusk, Amoonguss, and Corviknight, which answer many of Slowking´s checks such as Kingambit, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon. Slowking is generally vulnerable to becoming fodder for Orthworm, since it can't paralyze targets through Orthworm´s passed Substitutes. As such, Pokemon like Infiltrator Dragapult and Unaware Pokemon like Skeledirge and Dondozo are logical Slowking teammates that fix this issue, with Unaware teammates in particular being crucial for answering setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Iron Valiant that are present on hyper offense teams. Dark-types like Kingambit can check and occasionally switch into special attackers that have an advantage against Slowking like Nasty Plot Gholdengo, Choice Specs Greninja, and Choice Specs Dragapult, creating good defensive synergy without lacking offensive capabilities.</p>"

This is achievable with Bullet Punch in tandem with Technician, as it revenge kills Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant. Bullet Punch can also remove slower threats such as Hatterene and Tera Fairy Kingambit. Close Combat grants Scizor coverage against Pokemon such as Iron Treads, Kingambit, and Garganacl and provides strong neutral coverage against foes like Rotom-W and Corviknight, especially if not running the corresponding coverage move. Thief is a good way for Scizor to deal a good amount of damage against Gholdengo, while Trailblaze can be used to deal with defensive Water-types like Rotom-W lacking Will-O-Wisp and Dondozo. Tera Steel is Scizor's best option for a Tera type, since it not only gives a boost to Scizor's Bullet Punch but also makes Scizor resistant to Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Tera Electric + Tera Blast can be run to hit Flying- and Water-types such as Toxapex, Dondozo, Corviknight, and Tera Flying Kingambit. 20 Speed EVs are run in order for Scizor to outspeed Corviknight.</p> <p>Offensive teams appreciate Scizor's wallbreaking and revenge killing abilities. Scizor gets easily forced out by Great Tusk as well as Fire-types such as Skeledirge, Cinderace, and Volcarona. Therefore, Water-types such as Rotom-W and Azumarill make for good teammates. Rotom-W in particular synergizes well with Scizor, since the two of them can form a potent VoltTurn core. Azumarill also greatly appreciates Scizor pivoting into it. In return, Scizor can check Grass-types they struggle against like Breloom and Meowscarada. Scizor appreciates teammates that allow it to wallbreak much more easily, so entry hazard support from Pokemon like Garchomp are greatly appreciated. Gholdengo is another good teammate, since it can keep hazards on the field for Scizor to exploit in order to sweep late-game. If Scizor isn't running Thief, it can easily be checked by Gholdengo, so Dark-types like Kingambit pair well with Scizor. However, if Scizor is running Thief, it can struggle against Water-types, so Grass-types like Breloom, Meowscarada, and Tera Grass Volcarona make for good teammates. Scizor's lack of longevity means it can struggle with hazards, so hazard removers like Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for good teammates. Most of Scizor's damage output comes from Bullet Punch, so it dislikes Pokemon like Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Gholdengo switching into it. Thus, Pokemon that can counter them such as Meowscarada for the former, as well as Iron Moth for the latter two make for good teammates. Finally, setup sweepers such as Dragapult, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon appreciate Scizor muscling through walls like Garganacl, Tera Fairy Skeledirge, and Ting-Lu. They also appreciate the defensive utility Scizor brings with its ability to check Choice-locked Meowscarada and Calm Mind Iron Valiant.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Scizor can function as a utility pivot due to its high Attack, good coverage, and ability to force switches from the likes of Iron Valiant. Due to its typing, it can check Dragonite, which is a phenomenal offensive threat in OU. Bullet Punch dents Garganacl and Iron Valiant, as well as being able to revenge kill sweepers such as Roaring Moon and Dragonite. Dragonite's Extreme Speed does very little to Scizor in return, and Scizor can break Multiscale on Dragonite. Close Combat nails Kingambit and deals decent damage to Ting-Lu, and while U-turn 3HKOs Ting-Lu, Close Combat can 2HKO if Stealth Rock is up. Alternatively, Defog improves Scizor's matchups against entry hazard users such as Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. Thief hits Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Ceruledge for super effective damage, as well as being Scizor's strongest option against Toxapex. Swords Dance can power up Bullet Punch and U-turn, allowing Scizor to break through Garganacl. Tera Steel powers up Bullet Punch, which is key in OHKOing Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock. Heavy-Duty Boots makes pivoting easier by ignoring entry hazards.</p> <p>Scizor best fits on bulky offense and balance teams, as these appreciate a pivot which can force switches to bring in frail wallbreakers. Iron Valiant and Dragapult appreciate the momentum that Scizor provides, as they are 2HKOed by many common attacks. In return, they can handle physical walls that Scizor has trouble getting past such as Great Tusk and Dondozo. Scizor also appreciates entry hazard support from teammates such as Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Ting-Lu, as Scizor puts pressure on the opposing team with U-turn, forcing more switches and helping rack up more damage with hazards. Scizor also suffers from a lack of recovery, so defensive teammates such as Toxapex are appreciated, as they can help take pressure off of Scizor. Dragapult and Rotom-W form a good pivot core with Scizor, with Scizor luring Skeledirge and Dragapult luring Ting-Lu.</p>"

Close Combat is crucial to 2HKO defensive Rotom-W and defensive Great Tusk, as well as blow through Steel-types such as Kingambit and Iron Treads. Tera Blast paired with Tera Electric has a good chance to 2HKO Dondozo and can OHKO Toxapex, Alomomola, Corviknight, and offensive Gholdengo after a Swords Dance. Tera Electric also removes Scizor's Fire weakness, improving its matchup against Volcarona and Iron Moth, and grants it crucial resistances to Roaring Moon's Acrobatics and Iron Valiant's Thunderbolt. Alternatively, Quick Attack with Tera Normal gives Scizor a tool to pick off offensive Pokemon that resist Bullet Punch, such as Volcarona, Quaquaval, and Greninja. 180 Speed EVs allow Scizor to outspeed defensive Great Tusk and Rotom-W, while 76 HP EVs improve its bulk enough to survive Tera Flying Acrobatics from Roaring Moon.</p> <p>Scizor is best utilized on fast, offensive teams that appreciate its ability to wear down common defensive cores and keep opposing sweepers such as Roaring Moon and Booster Energy Iron Valiant in check. Glimmora and Great Tusk can set entry hazards to help chip Pokemon like Garchomp and defensive Gholdengo into range of Scizor's attacks. Grimmsnarl can ease Scizor's sweep by setting up screens and appreciates falling back on Scizor to handle threats such as Iron Valiant. Special attackers like Iron Moth, Gholdengo, Greninja, and Iron Valiant can deal with the physical walls that check Scizor, such as Dondozo, Skeledirge, and Great Tusk. Scizor's ability to lure Dondozo and take it out with Tera Blast makes it an excellent partner for other physical sweepers that struggle with it, such as Dragonite and Kingambit. Conversely, Breloom is an excellent partner for Quick Attack Scizor that handles Dondozo and appreciates Scizor keeping Volcarona, Iron Moth, and Dragapult in check.</p>"

Hurricane and Surf give Pelipper some offensive presence of its own, threatening Pokemon like Amoonguss and Cinderace; these moves also threaten common Stealth Rock setters like Great Tusk and Garganacl. Its slow U-turn allows it to give its more offensive teammates safe switch-ins. Damp Rock extends Pelipper's rain, giving its teammates more turns to make use of the weather. Tera Water is used to power up Pelipper's already strong Surf in a pinch, but Tera Ground is an option that lets Pelipper safely pivot on a predicted Volt Switch from Rotom-W or Iron Treads. 0 Speed IVs and a Relaxed nature are used to give Pelipper the slowest possible U-turn, allowing it to potentially move after opposing Pelipper. A Sassy nature can be considered alongside maximum Special Defense investment to allow Pelipper to survive neutral hits from special attackers like Iron Valiant and Enamorus more reliably. Notably, it avoids the 2HKO from Timid Greninja's Dark Pulse and rain boosted Hydro Pump, allowing Pelipper to prevent Greninja from KOing a teammate and activating Battle Bond.</p> <p>Swift Swim users like Basculegion and Floatzel are Pelipper's most notable partners, as their wallbreaking power turns extreme in rain. Zapdos, Battle Bond Greninja, Azumarill, and Walking Wake are other Pokemon that appreciate Pelipper setting up rain.

Pelipper is not always able to safely use U-turn to get its offensive teammates in; Eject Button users like Hatterene and Amoonguss provide the team with an alternative method of safely pivoting. Each comes with their own bonuses to the team: Hatterene denies entry hazards with Magic Bounce, keeping Pelipper healthy, and Amoonguss potentially takes a foe out of the fight with Spore. Amoonguss also has positive matchups against bulky Water-types like Alomomola and Toxapex, which can give Pelipper and its teammates trouble. Given Pelipper's weakness to Electric, sturdy Ground-types like Iron Treads and Great Tusk help.

Hurricane gives Pelipper strong coverage for the Pokemon that it cannot overcome with its Water-type attacks like Walking Wake and Gastrodon. Ice Beam is an option over Hydro Pump for Dragonite.

Bullet Seed hits various defensive Pokemon, such as Clodsire, Dondozo, and Garganacl, for significant damage. Mach Punch lets Breloom revenge kill threats such as Greninja and Roaring Moon and allows it to preserve its Focus Sash by bypassing Kingambit's Sucker Punch. With Tera Fire, Tera Blast lets Breloom lure in and dispatch Gholdengo and Amoonguss, the tier's predominant Spore absorbers. Alternatively, Swords Dance helps Breloom better pressure Pokemon such as Toxapex and Hatterene with Bullet Seed, while Close Combat is another option for faster-paced teams that gives Breloom a greater immediate offensive presence.

Mach Punch, in conjunction with Technician, allows Breloom to pick off faster threats such as Greninja, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon. Lastly, Bulldoze OHKOes Gholdengo and 2HKOes Skeledirge, while Spore lets Breloom incapacitate a switch-in and generates opportunities to take down counters later in the battle, and Rock Tomb OHKOes Volcarona while reliably hitting Dragonite and still 2HKOing Skeledirge. Tera Fighting allows Breloom to 2HKO Amoonguss after Stealth Rock with Close Combat and revenge kill threats such as Cinderace from higher health with Mach Punch. Alternatively, Tera Grass turns Bullet Seed into a powerful nuke that can break down common switch-ins like Gholdengo and generally increase its damage output, turning Breloom into a very potent stallbreaker.

Flip Turn allows Floatzel to pivot out of the field while weakening foes such as Walking Wake, Dragonite, Alomomola, and Dondozo that arent immediately threatened by Wave Crash. Aqua Jet picks off faster and boosted foes especially if rain isn't active, such as Iron Moth, Volcarona, and Tera Flying Roaring Moon, and outprioritizes Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Ceruledge's Shadow Sneak. Ice Spinner complements Floatzel's STAB moves to reliably hit the likes of Dragonite, Dragapult, Amoonguss, and Water Absorb Clodsire. Alternatively, Liquidation is a safer attack to keep Floatzel healthy when Wave Crash's power isn't necessary, such as against weak and neutral targets like Great Tusk, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge, and is the preferred attack to clean up late-game once the opposition is weakened enough.</p> <p>Floatzel is exclusively found on offensive rain teams.

Ground-types like Iron Treads, Great Tusk, and Clodsire provide a necessary Electric immunity while setting entry hazards, making Dondozo and Toxapex easier to break through; Iron Treads and Great Tusk also provide Knock Off to cripple the bulky Water-types, including Alomomola and Tera Water Skeledirge, by making them susceptible to Stealth Rock as well, while Water Absorb Clodsire is a rigid defensive backbone against the likes of Azumarill, Walking Wake, and Tera Grass Volcarona, all of which can force Floatzel out. Eject Button Amoonguss can bring Floatzel in safely on Pokemon like Great Tusk, Gholdengo, Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Ting-Lu, incapacitate foes with Spore to give it more wallbreaking opportunities, and switch into and threaten Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl for Floatzel. Pawmot's Revival Blessing compensates for Floatzel's tendency to faint early-game from Wave Crash recoil—especially against common Rocky Helmet users like Corviknight and Amoonguss—and lets it wallbreak or even clean up in the late-game afterwards and enjoys Floatzel pressuring Great Tusk in return. Kingambit is a stellar late-game cleaner that enjoys Floatzel pressuring its checks in Great Tusk and Volcarona and overwhelming a common answer in Dondozo, as well as takes advantage of Floatzel fainting early-game from Wave Crash recoil to accumulate Supreme Overlord boosts.</p>"

Special wallbreakers like Greninja, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth threaten these walls to Garchomp and therefore make excellent partners. Dragapult can also provide much-needed special offense while pressuring Dondozo and Corviknight with Draco Meteor and Flamethrower, forming a dangerous Dragon-type spam core with Garchomp and providing speed control that Garchomp cannot, especially against foes like Iron Valiant and Greninja. Additionally, Dragapult can use U-turn to scout a forced switch and safely bring Garchomp into battle against foes like Clodsire and Kingambit. Entry hazard setters like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Glimmora are great partners, as they allow Garchomp to secure KOs against opponents like Tera Fairy Garganacl and Amoonguss, which it otherwise cannot OHKO at +2. Glimmora and Great Tusk are especially good for this role, as they can both remove hazards that hinder Garchomp’s wallbreaking potential, and the latter can cripple Corviknight by removing its Leftovers with Knock Off. Fast sweepers, such as Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult, can easily revenge kill Garchomp, especially when its Substitute is down. A defensive backbone made up of Pokemon like Clodsire and Corviknight is essential for Garchomp’s team. Lastly, Garchomp gives great support to late-game and sweepers like Dragapult that appreciate foes like defensive Gholdengo, Toxapex, and Clodsire being removed.</p>"

Due to Rotom-W's nature of constantly pivoting, spinners and Defoggers like Great Tusk and Corviknight are appreciated; Great Tusk, in particular, can threaten Clodsire, one of Rotom-W's sturdiest answers, while Corviknight's U-turn complements Rotom-W's pivoting duties. Defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu are viable options to cover threats like Breloom, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult, respectively; in return, they enjoy Rotom-W checking Cinderace and Garchomp. Pokemon that can switch into Meowscarada and Great Tusk's Knock Off, such as Corviknight and Amoonguss, are valuable to maintain Rotom-W's longevity from its Leftovers.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>With its unique typing backed up by a good Special Defense stat and access to Volt Switch and Levitate, Rotom-W is one of the best defensive pivots and Ground immunities in the tier. Rotom-W's STAB Hydro Pump lets it threaten Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Sandy Shocks aiming to block its Volt Switch. Its bulk in Special Defense lets it sponge attacks from special attackers such as Walking Wake, Hisuian Zoroark, and Iron Valiant and cripple them with Thunder Wave. Protect lets Rotom-W gain Leftovers recovery as well as scout the intentions of Choice item users like Gholdengo and Greninja. 12 Speed EVs lets Rotom-W outspeed 0 Speed Great Tusk and paralyzed Dragapult. Tera Fairy grants Rotom-W an immunity to some of the tier's most powerful special attacks in Walking Wake's, Dragapult's, and Garchomp's Draco Meteor, allowing it to handle them more easily. Tera Steel provides Rotom-W with a resistance to said Dragon-type attacks and an immunity to Toxapex's and Clodsire's Toxic, making for an excellent defensive typing in conjunction with Levitate. Tera Steel also improves Rotom-W's matchup against Dragonite, letting it cripple it with Thunder Wave and pivot out into one of its teammates.</p> <p>Bulky offense teams appreciate Rotom-W's defensive profile and ability to pivot while maintaining an offensive presence. Cinderace appreciates Rotom-W's ability to threaten Great Tusk, Ceruledge, and Skeledirge, and in return, it threatens Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Breloom, and Meowscarada that resist both of Rotom-W's STAB moves. Great Tusk can rely on Rotom-W to take Water-type attacks from Walking Wake and Greninja and in return provide hazard removal to keep Rotom-W healthy throughout the game, as well as threaten Water Absorb Clodsire, which completely walls Rotom-W. Rotom-W threatens both Dondozo and Great Tusk, which Kingambit can struggle to break past, and enjoys Kingambit checking Calm Mind Hatterene and Dragon Dance Dragapult that may use Rotom-W as a setup opportunity. While Rotom-W struggles to beat Walking Wake, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Roaring Moon one-on-one, its ability to cripple them with Thunder Wave lets teammates like Dragapult and Iron Valiant deal with them more easily. Defensive teammates such as Corviknight and Amoonguss can check the aforementioned Grass-types that are troublesome for Rotom-W, and provide bulk for Rotom-W to not get overwhelmed by repeated hits.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Equipped with a Choice Scarf, Rotom-W provides excellent utility as a fast pivot thanks to its Volt Switch, devastating status moves, and high-Base Power STAB move in Hydro Pump. Volt Switch keeps up momentum during the game, and it can super effectively hit Corviknight, Dondozo, Toxapex, and Greninja, which Rotom-W now outspeeds thanks to its Choice Scarf. Hydro Pump is the strongest move it has, meaningfully hurting a wide range of Pokemon, and it punishes Ground-types such as Greak Tusk, Clodsire, and Garchomp that attempt to block Volt Switch. Rotom-W can outspeed the entire unboosted metagame with its Choice Scarf, allowing it to reliably hit Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Garganacl. Trick is essential to cripple walls that can recover from Rotom-W's attacks, like Toxapex and Tera Fairy Garganacl. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple threats such as Dragapult and Iron Moth, especially since Choice Scarf Rotom-W outspeeds them. Will-O-Wisp is just as useful as Thunder Wave, disarming physical threats like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, Breloom, and Meowscarada. Tera Steel gives Rotom-W an immunity to Toxic from Clodsire and Toxapex, as well as a resistance to Meowscarada's Flower Trick, Breloom's Bullet Seed, Iron Valiant's Moonblast, and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. On top of this, Levitate makes Steel's Ground weakness into an immunity; notably, EdgeQuake can't hit Tera Steel Rotom-W neutrally. Alternatively, Tera Water takes a more offensive approach, boosting the power of Hydro Pump to 2HKO Gholdengo, and it can potentially OHKO physically defensive Garganacl and Clodsire.</p> <p>Rotom-W sits comfortably on balance and bulky offense teams. It pairs well with defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight, Toxapex, and Amoonguss, which use their Grass resistances and/or recovery to sponge hits like Breloom's Bullet Seed, Meowscarada's Flower Trick, and Ting-Lu's Ruination. Rotom-W pressures entry hazard removers like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Corviknight, and Cinderace, which helps hazard setters. Great Tusk is a great example, since it also removes hazards to ease Rotom-W's pivoting. More offensive partners like Iron Valiant, Cinderace, and Dragapult love Rotom-W crippling bothersome walls like Ting-Lu and Amoonguss with Trick. In turn, they can effectively check Breloom, Meowscarada, Choice Specs Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Choice Specs Dragapult, which can all cause trouble for Rotom-W. When Rotom-W pivots against Corviknight, Dondozo, Toxapex, and Greninja as they switch out, frail attackers such as Meowscarada, Cinderace, and Iron Valiant can safely come in to pressure the incoming Amoonguss, opposing Rotom-W, and Gholdengo.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With its unique typing and high stats all around the board, Heatran makes for a bulky attacker able to threaten all kinds of Pokemon in the tier. Magma Storm allows Heatran to trap and potentially remove opposing Pokemon, as well as chipping them down with its passive damage. Earth Power hits Toxapex and Fire-types such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, Volcanion, and opposing Heatran for super effective damage. Taunt can be used to stop Toxapex's Recover and Galarian Slowking's Chilly Reception and Slack Off, thus allowing Heatran to trap them. Heatran is an effective Stealth Rock user thanks to its good matchup against common entry hazard removal options in Defog Corviknight and bulky Court Change Cinderace. Tera Blast Grass gives Heatran a way to hit Water-types such as Rotom-W, Hisuian Samurott, and Azumarill, as well as threatening an OHKO against Great Tusk. Furthermore, Tera Grass works well with Flash Fire and turns Heatran's Ground and Water weaknesses into resistances, improving its matchup against the aforementioned Pokemon as well as Volcanion and letting it potentially trap the likes of Dondozo and Clodsire. Leftovers lets Heatran heal throughout the game and makes it easier for it to trap its targets. Air Balloon is another option that allows Heatran to take a hit from Pokemon that would usually target it with Earthquake or Earth Power such as Enamorus, Ursaluna, and opposing Heatran and heavily damage them. The matchup against opposing Heatran also makes a Timid nature desirable to outspeed the other and hit it with Earth Power; it also lets Heatran outspeed the likes of Modest Gholdengo and Volcanion. Alternatively, Heatran can opt to run a Modest nature to further boost its power.</p> <p>Heatran usually finds itself on bulky offense teams due to its ability to threaten defensive Pokemon and common forms of entry hazard control. Kingambit appreciates Heatran's support against Will-O-Wisp users in Cinderace, Dragapult, and Moltres and its ability to take on walls such as Corviknight as well as Dondozo and Great Tusk if Terastallized. Heatran's ability to force heavy damage against Amoonguss, Hatterene, and defensive Zapdos makes it a good Great Tusk partner. Great Tusk, in turn, provides Rapid Spin support to keep the field clear from entry hazards, which Heatran tends to get worn down by. Zapdos can defensively check Fighting-types that outspeed Heatran, such as Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, Sneasler, and offensive Great Tusk, as well as Hisuian Samurott, which tends to use Heatran as an opportunity to fire off Ceaseless Edge. Enamorus is also able to check Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Hisuian Samurott, though it struggles to safely switch into them consistently due to its lesser bulk. Dragapult can threaten the Dragon-types that don't take much damage from Heatran's attacks, such as Dragonite, Walking Wake, and Garchomp. Furthermore, its Water resistance and Fighting immunity let it answer Volcanion and Zamazenta aiming to KO Heatran. Lastly, Rillaboom's ability to summon Grassy Terrain via Grassy Surge provides Heatran with extra passive recovery, boosts the power of its Tera Blast Grass, and weakens the damage it takes from Earthquake, letting Heatran survive physically defensive Great Tusk's Earthquake from full health.</p>"

Magma Storm is a strong STAB move that lets it potentially trap the likes of Toxapex and Galarian Slowking, and which even Fire-resistant foes such as Garchomp and Rotom-W can struggle against due to its passive damage. Taunt allows Heatran to block status moves such as Toxapex's Recover and Galarian Slowking's Chilly Reception. Alternatively, Protect can be used to gain extra Leftovers recovery, deal further damage with Magma Storm, and scout Choice item users such as Dragapult, Enamorus, and Zamazenta. Earth Power provides a way for Heatran to dent Fire-types such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, and opposing Heatran, and it lets Heatran continuously chip Toxapex and Galarian Slowking to more easily remove them after having trapped them. Stealth Rock is used to take advantage of its good matchup against hazard control options such as Hatterene, Corviknight, and bulky Cinderace. Tera Blast Grass is an alternative that lets Heatran threaten the likes of Rotom-W and Hisuian Samurott. Lastly, Will-O-Wisp is another option that allows Heatran to punish Dragonite, Garchomp, and Roaring Moon trying to switch in, as well as Kingambit aiming to revenge kill Heatran with Sucker Punch. The set opts for near maximum Special Defense investment with enough Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Kingambit and Azumarill. The 4 Defense EVs in conjunction with maximum HP allows Heatran to always survive an Earthquake from Clodsire from full health. Tera Grass's benefits go beyond the Tera Blast coverage, as it also gives Heatran a resistance to Water- and Ground-type attacks, which expands its range of Pokemon it can trap to include Dondozo, Clodsire, and Garganacl. Tera Grass also synergizes beautifully with Flash Fire, as it removes the potential weakness to Fire-type attacks. Tera Flying is another option that gets rid of Heatran's weakness to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, notably improving its matchup against Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Dragapult appreciates Heatran's ability to switch into Choice Scarf Gholdengo's Shadow Ball, Choice Scarf Enamorus's Moonblast, and opposing Dragapult's STAB moves. Great Tusk is another Pokemon that appreciates Heatran's support against said special attackers, as well as against Zapdos, Amoonguss, and Hatterene, and in turn it is able to keep Heatran healthy by removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Heatran and Toxapex make for a solid defensive core thanks to the former's ability to take on Hatterene, Zapdos, and Gholdengo that annoy Toxapex, and the latter's resistance to Fighting- and Water-type moves that aim to target Heatran such as Close Combat from Iron Valiant, Sneasler, and Zamazenta, Walking Wake's Hydro Steam, and Greninja's Hydro Pump.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Cresselia is a potent late-game wincon thanks to its gargantuan bulk, reliable recovery, and access to Calm Mind + Stored Power as well as solid coverage to deal with the Dark-types. After several Calm Mind boosts, Stored Power allows Cresselia to muscle past both Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Dondozo and bulky Psychic-resistant foes like Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Heatran while making it nigh impossible to KO with special attackers. Moonblast rounds out Cresselia's coverage, allowing it to hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Greninja super effectively while being able to at least damage Kingambit; Tera Blast Fighting greatly improves Cresselia's matchup against Kingambit and hits these Dark-types harder than Moonblast, but makes Cresselia more reliant on Terastallization. Leftovers grants Cresselia crucial passive healing, allowing it to conserve its limited Moonlight PP long-term; Covert Cloak, on the other hand, blocks secondary effects from an array of moves, including Heatran's Magma Storm, Garganacl's Salt Cure, Zapdos's Discharge, and Sneasler's Dire Claw, allowing Cresselia to set up against these threats more safely. Grassy Seed is an option if Cresselia is used on Grassy Terrain hyper offense teams, which gives it more opprotunities to set up in the face of physical attackers while also boosting its Stored Power. Tera Poison has wonderful synergy with Levitate, giving Cresselia a single weakness to Psychic-type attacks, granting it resistances to Poison- and Fairy-type attacks, and an immunity to Toxapex's Toxic while still maintaining its Fighting resistance. Defensively, Tera Fighting lets Cresselia flip its Dark weakness against prominent Pokemon like Meowscarada, Greninja, Hisuian Samurott, and the aforementioned Kingambit as well. 52 Speed EVs allow Cresselia to outspeed Kingambit.</p> <p>Cresselia fits well on an array of hyper offense, offense, and balance teams capable of supporting such a potent wincon. Heatran, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T can provide entry hazard support to wear down foes over time. Heatran can also use Will-O-Wisp to cripple Kingambit or trap and wear down threats like Haze Toxapex and Chilly Reception Galarian Slowking with Magma Storm and Taunt; in return, Cresselia can handle threats like Great Tusk and Zamazenta that Heatran struggles against. Kingambit is ubiquitous and is a major thorn in Cresselia's side; as such, Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Low Kick Kingambit are crucial partners that can help stop opposing Kingambit's attempt to countersweep. Assault Vest Toxapex is a great teammate for Cresselia; it can take on Encore Iron Valiant, which is a frustrating matchup for Cresselia, and it can trap and deal with opposing defensive Toxapex, which can shut down Cresselia's boosts with Haze and force Cresselia to Tera Poison in order to avoid being crippled by Toxic. Thanks to Grassy Surge, Rillaboom is a necessary partner for Grassy Seed variants; it can support Cresselia with utility options like Knock Off and U-turn too.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Courtesy of its Spikes-setting signature move, Ceaseless Edge, Hisuian Samurott is a good lead for hyper offense teams. With Sharpness, Razor Shell is Hisuian Samurott's strongest move, dealing high damage to many opposing leads such as Great Tusk and Glimmora. Surf is an alternative over Razor Shell that trades overall power for the ability to hit Great Tusk's lower Special Defense and avoid activating Glimmora's Toxic Debris. Knock Off allows Hisuian Samurott to make progress against the enemy team by removing items, especially Heavy-Duty Boots, but Taunt is another option that denies opposing entry hazards and prevents Defog. For the last slot, Aqua Jet is useful for finishing off faster leads such as Great Tusk, while Sucker Punch is a stronger but less reliable Aqua Jet alternative that hits Pokemon like Dragapult and Walking Wake. Finally, Encore is useful for locking opposing Pokemon into undesirable moves such as forcing an opposing lead to use Stealth Rock repeatedly, allowing Hisuian Samurott to stack more Spikes with Ceaseless Edge. Taunt and Encore also prevent Hisuian Samurott from becoming setup fodder from Pokemon like Iron Defense Zamazenta and Tera Water Garganacl that attempt to exploit Hisuian Samurott's relative passivity. Focus Sash ensures Hisuian Samurott can take any one hit and set up at least one layer of Spikes. Tera Ghost is the preferred option to block Rapid Spin. However, Tera Water can also be considered to power up Hisuian Samurott's Water-type STAB moves, especially if running Aqua Jet. Sharpness is generally the preferred ability to boost the power of both Ceaseless Edge and Razor Shell. However, if Hisuian Samurott is using Surf instead, Torrent can also be considered for greater power against bulky variants of Great Tusk when at low health, which works extremely well with Focus Sash.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott fits best on hyper offense teams looking for a suicide lead to start the game off with entry hazards. This set is useful, as it virtually guarantees that a layer of Spikes will go up, since Ceaseless Edge is not affected by Taunt and Hatterene's Magic Bounce. Gholdengo is highly recommended to deny opposing Rapid Spin and Defog. A Stealth Rock setter such as Great Tusk or Sandy Shocks can further supplement the team's hazard pressure. In particular, Sandy Shocks has a strong matchup against Zapdos and Glimmora, while Hisuian Samurott can cover Ting-Lu for Sandy Shocks. A Knock Off user such as Meowscarada, Great Tusk, or Iron Valiant can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from enemy Pokemon to make them vulnerable to Spikes. Powerful sweepers that can take advantage of the hazard pressure Hisuian Samurott creates are good teammates. Such Pokemon include Kingambit, Dragonite, Sneasler, Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant. These Pokemon all appreciate Spikes support to wear down bulky targets such as Dondozo, Garganacl, and Ting-Lu. Strong wallbreakers such as Ursaluna also enjoy Hisuian Samurott's Spikes to make them even harder to wall.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance allows Hisuian Samurott to go far beyond its presumed role of just an entry hazard setter, boosting its attack to obscene levels and letting it pose a wallbreaking threat as well. Aside from its reliability and higher critical hit ratio, Aqua Cutter's main benefit is to avoid Static from Zapdos and Rocky Helmet from the likes of Great Tusk and Landorus-T; on the other hand, Razor Shell can be used for its Defense drop alongside slightly higher Base Power. Aqua Jet rounds off Hisuian Samurott's moveset by providing ever-so-useful priority to clean up weakened teams with faster threats and either revenge kill or discourage Pokémon like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and offensive Great Tusk from coming in. Sucker Punch is a much stronger alternative and hits Water-resistant foes like Walking Wake and Dragapult, but it's less reliable due to poor interaction with status moves like Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Substitute. Mystic Water can be used boost Hisuian Samurott's damage output on its Water-type moves without the cost of its HP like Life Orb would; Heavy-Duty Boots, on the other hand, helps give Hisuian Samurott more longevity so that it gets more chances to spread hazards via Ceaseless Edge and wallbreak early-game. Tera Water serves a similar purpose to Mystic Water, being potentially useful to sweep a team or generally increase the damage of Aqua Jet and Aqua Cutter; on the other hand, Tera Dark significantly boosts Ceaseless Edge and Sucker Punch. Both Tera types can also have defensive impacts, like Tera Water allowing Hisuian Samurott to stomach a hit from Zamazenta or Iron Valiant and Tera Dark doing the same for Zapdos.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott is a great fit on bulky offenses and balances that appreciate its entry hazard stacking ability and wallbreaking prowess all condensed in one slot; more well-rounded team styles can afford giving Hisuian Samurott more turns to click Ceaseless Edge or apply raw offensive pressure between Swords Dance and Aqua Cutter. To aid in that, teammates that can help provide momentum are very welcome, such as U-turn users like Cinderace, Dragapult; Volt Switch users like Zapdos; and even Eject Pack users like Close Combat Great Tusk. Pokemon that appreciate their checks getting worn down by Spikes are also fantastic teammates; Dragapult and Gholdengo deserve a mention, as their most common check in Kingambit especially dislikes coming into Spikes if it's not holding an Air Balloon, but almost any wallbreaker strongly appreciates Hisuian Samurott's Spikes and offensive pressure, with examples including Kingambit, offensive Zapdos, and Walking Wake. Hisuian Samurott may have trouble with its work being undone by hazard removers like Great Tusk, Defog Corviknight, and Court Change Cinderace. Gholdengo is a good help with the first two, whereas for the latter, having a team with strong momentum options like the aforementioned U-turn, Volt Switch, and Eject Pack users as well as Pokemon that take advantage of pivot Cinderace like Heatran or Volcanion are welcome.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Equipped with Choice Scarf and excellent Sharpness-boosted STAB moves in Ceaseless Edge and Razor Shell, Hisuian Samurott is able to serve as both a fast entry hazard setter and a great offensive threat against slower Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, Cinderace, and Ting-Lu. Knock Off removes valuable items from Pokemon that rely on them, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite as well as Leftovers from Corviknight and Toxapex. Sacred Sword is a great coverage move for Hisuian Samurott, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon such as Kingambit and opposing Hisuian Samurott. Tera Water boosts the power of Razor Shell, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon like Ursaluna and Great Tusk. On the other hand, Tera Dark boosts Ceaseless Edge and Knock Off, allowing Hisuian Samurott to OHKO Skeledirge.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott shines on various balance and offense teams, as it serves a unique role of being able to deal damage while also reliably setting Spikes. This allows said teams to punish switches and more easily wear down bulky archetypes. Gholdengo is a great partner for Hisuian Samurott due to pressuring faster offensive threats such as Sneasler and Iron Valiant, and thanks to its ability, it can block Defog attempts from Corviknight. Hisuian Samurott also has great type synergy with Gholdengo, with it being able to pressure Dark-types Gholdengo tends to struggle with like Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and opposing Hisuian Samurott. Heatran and Ting-Lu both make for good partners, since they can stack hazards alongside Hisuian Samurott while also checking Zapdos, which otherwise forces it out. In return, Hisuian Samurott can pressure Ground-types that Heatran and Ting-Lu both tend to struggle with, like Great Tusk and Ursaluna. Walls such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, Dondozo, and Corviknight can force Hisuian Samurott out, so it pairs well with offensive teammates that can beat them, like the aforementioned Gholdengo as well as Choice Specs Hoopa-U and Zapdos. Lastly, sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Dragonite, and Sneasler appreciate Hisuian Samurott laying down hazards and beating Pokemon they can struggle with, like Air Balloon Gholdengo.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>The name of the game with Hisuian Samurott is finding as many opportunities as possible to use Ceaseless Edge in order to repeatedly set up Spikes. This set aims to leverage Hisuian Samurott's natural resistances by equipping an Assault Vest, allowing it to come in on Gholdengo, Heatran, and Kingambit lacking Low Kick and Tera Blast Fairy. Knock Off makes progress against teams otherwise unphased by Hisuian Samurott's offensive profile, removing valuable items from the likes of Zapdos, Dondozo, and Toxapex. Sacred Sword is an alternative that better rounds out Hisuian Samurott's neutral coverage while hitting Kingambit and opposing Hisuian Samurott. Hisuian Samurott is a great utilizer of priority moves due to its proficiency at weakening teams with entry hazards damage, and it has two options in Aqua Jet and Sucker Punch. Aqua Jet has better coverage against Fighting-types like Iron Valiant and Sneasler, while Sucker Punch trades in reliability for power and is a better option for revenge killing the likes of Choice-locked Dragapult. If electing to run Aqua Jet, Tera Water is ideal to boost its power as well as Razor Shell's. If running Sucker Punch, Tera Dark is the better choice, especially if Knock Off is also being used. On the flipside, Tera Steel is useful as a defensive Tera type for reversing the matchup against Moonblast from Enamorus and Iron Valiant and resisting Dragon-type moves from Dragapult. Tera Ghost is another option, stifling foes attempts at removing hazards via Rapid Spin, though this does make Hisuian Samurott vulnerable to Shadow Ball from Dragapult and Gholdengo, which it was previously able to come in on. 20 Special Defense EVs in combination with an Assault Vest ensures Hisuian Samurott takes a Moonblast from non-Choice Specs Iron Valiant or a Draco Meteor from Modest Choice Specs Dragapult from full HP.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott fits very well on balanced and bulky offensive teams that appreciate entry hazard stacking as well as role compression from it being able to take a few special hits thanks to its Assault Vest. Other Pokemon that fit on these sorts of offensive teams that also appreciate the opposing team being weakened by Spikes, such as Kingambit, Dragonite, and Sneasler are beneficial allies. Gholdengo specifically is a very good teammate, as it blocks both Rapid Spin and Defog and can take advantage of some of Hisuian Samurott's switch-ins like Amoonguss and Toxapex. Dragapult is also an option for spinblocking. It additionally is great at forcing switches, racking up hazard damage. VoltTurn support from Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Corviknight is a worthwhile consideration to give Hisuian Samurott more opportunities to throw off attacks. While Hisuian Samurott can come in once or twice on attacks from Pokemon like Gholdengo and Heatran, it's by no means a reliable answer. Ting-Lu and Tera Water Garganacl work well as primary answers to these threat while also forming a hazard stacking core alongside Hisuian Samurott. They can set up Stealth Rock while also greatly benefiting from its ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off.</p>"

Life Orb is an option that helps Hisuian Lilligant overwhelm some targets with extra power like Walking Wake, OHKOing it with Close Combat after a Victory Dance. A Jolly nature allows it to Speed tie Unburden Adamant Sneasler in sun, while an Adamant nature provides extra power that may be necessary to overwhelm targets like Zapdos, Amoonguss, and Zamazenta. Tera Ghost allows Hisuian Lilligant to spinblock and threaten some of its best checks in Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge with Tera Blast. Tera Ghost also allows Hisuian Lilligant to block Extreme Speed from Dragonite, preventing revenge kills. Tera Fire with Tera Blast is also an option, giving Hisuian Lilligant a strong sun-boosted Fire-type STAB move for coverage to hit bulky targets like Amoonguss and Gholdengo hard. Another benefit of Tera Fire is an immunity to burn from Pokemon like Moltres and Cinderace. Hisuian Lilligant requires Torkoal as a partner, as Hisuian Lilligant requires sun support, which Torkoal is able to set up automatically with Drought. Hisuian Lilligant’s ability to weaken Water-types and opposing team structures makes Iron Moth a dangerous late-game sweeper in sun. Hisuian Lilligant is only able to afford to run one coverage move, which can leave it vulnerable to checks it cannot afford to run coverage for, such as Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, Amoonguss, and Moltres. Great Tusk, Sandy Shocks, and Walking Wake are all great teammates capable of handling some of the aforementioned checks. Great Tusk and Sandy Shocks threaten Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Moltres. Walking Wake is able to break Amoonguss with Draco Meteor, as well as blow past Moltres, which is usually able to wall Hisuian Lilligant.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark is a fast and strong wallbreaker with good coverage. Not only are its coverage moves good, but it has STAB on a very spammable type with fantastic neutral coverage in OU, Ghost. An incredible ability in Illusion greatly improves its wallbreaking: it can disguise itself as another teammate to create mind games, scoring great damage if opponents guess wrong. Its unique typing blocks some revenge killing moves such as Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Ceruledge's Shadow Sneak, and Breloom's Mach Punch. Grass Knot is a great coverage option to OHKO Great Tusk and physically defensive Dondozo, potentially OHKO Garganacl, and 2HKO specially defensive Dondozo. Alternatively, Hyper Voice is a good STAB option, getting neutral coverage on most Pokemon that Shadow Ball cannot, and it ignores Hydreigon and Terastallized Skeledirge's Substitute. Flamethrower allows Hisuian Zoroark to 2HKO Corviknight and Amoonguss, as well as OHKOing Scizor. Alternatively, Focus Blast gives Hisuian Zoroark a way to catch incoming Kingambit off guard, and it hits Garganacl and Ting-Lu super effectively, which is very helpful if forgoing Grass Knot. With Trick, Hisuian Zoroark can cripple walls like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Garganacl, as well as bulky setup sweepers it cannot threaten immediately, like Tera Fairy Garganacl and Tera Fire or Tera Water Hatterene. However, giving away Choice Specs sacrifices some of the OHKOs and 2HKOs mentioned above. U-turn is a great alternative to bring teammates in safely on Assault Vest Azumarill and Ting-Lu. Tera Normal and Tera Ghost boost Hisuian Zoroark's already powerful STAB moves, with boosted Hyper Voice always OHKOing Great Tusk, while boosted Shadow Ball 2HKOes Assault Vest Azumarill. Tera Fighting is another good option, as it not only boosts Focus Blast, but it also turns Hisuian Zoroark's Dark weakness into a resistance, meaning it no longer fears Sucker Punch revenge killers.</p> <p>Hisuian Zoroark fits best on offensive teams. Great Tusk can set Stealth Rock, helping Hisuian Zoroark KO foes more easily, and check the Dark-types it struggles with such as Kingambit and specially defensive Ting-Lu. Pivots such as Rotom-W and Meowscarada can bring Hisuian Zoroark safely into Amoonguss and Corviknight, respectively. Rotom-W in particular is a great teammate, since it can also spread paralysis, crippling boosted sweepers and naturally fast Pokemon such as Dragonite, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult for Hisuian Zoroark to outspeed and KO. Hisuian Zoroark dislikes opposing hazards: not only does it get worn down easily, but opponents may see through its disguise based on the damage it takes from Stealth Rock. Hence, it appreciates hazard removal and prevention from the aforementioned Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Hatterene. Great Tusk and Corviknight can also come in and take a hit from Kingambit and Meowscarada, respectively, which can revenge kill Hisuian Zoroark. Corviknight in particular really appreciates Hisuian Zoroark threatening Gholdengo, which blocks its Defog. Specially defensive Pokemon like Assault Vest Azumarill and Clodsire can take a hit from Hisuian Zoroark, thus forcing it out, given its frailty. To threaten both of these checks, Choice Band Breloom is a great partner. In return, U-turn Hisuian Zoroark can bring Breloom in on these Pokemon. Lastly, setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Volcarona, and Iron Moth appreciate Hisuian Zoroark's ability to threaten their checks such as Garganacl, Dondozo, and Skeledirge, letting them clean up afterwards. Hisuian Zoroark can also disguise as them to lure in their checks and either KO them or cripple them with Trick. Hisuian Zoroark can disguise as Dragonite, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon to lure in physical walls such as Great Tusk and Dondozo, only for them to be OHKOed by Grass Knot. Similarly, Hisuian Zoroark can also disguise as Volcarona and Iron Moth to lure in Clodsire and Toxapex, using Trick to cripple them and open up a potential sweep.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Hisuian Zoroark is a devastating special wallbreaker thanks to its combination of unique typing, coverage, fantastic Speed, and a high Special Attack stat, and it can almost always threaten a KO after a boost. Its ability, Illusion, provides good utility by letting it draw out an unsuspecting teammate's check and blasting them with powerful special attacks. Shadow Ball hits nearly everything in the tier for solid damage with very few drawbacks, and it has the lovely side effect of potentially dropping a foe's Special Defense. Grass Knot can be utilized to sink many heavy defensive threats, such as Garganacl, Great Tusk, and Dondozo. This also comes with the advantage of being a reliable move against heavy foes like Ting-Lu without burning up valuable PP on Focus Blast or dealing with its less-than-stellar accuracy. Flamethrower hammers would-be switch-ins like Kingambit and Scizor. Alternatively, Focus Blast can be used to hit Ting-Lu, Hydreigon, Kingambit, and Garganacl with the same move. Tera Ghost allows Shadow Ball to more reliably OHKO Gholdengo on Focus Sash sets, and it also allows +2 Shadow Ball to OHKO Volcarona, Walking Wake, Iron Moth, and Slowking. Alternatively, Tera Fighting turns its Dark-type weakness into a resistance, leaving it less susceptible to Kingambit's Sucker Punch, Meowscarada's Knock Off, and Greninja's Dark Pulse, and it powers up Focus Blast to staggering heights. Tera Fighting Focus Blast OHKOes Garganacl and even has a good chance to OHKO Ting-Lu at +2 after Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Tera Fairy allows Hisuian Zoroark to hold off Dark-types as well as become immune to Dragapult's Dragon-type attacks. Focus Sash guarantees that Hisuian Zoroark has a chance to set up or attack. On the other hand, Life Orb can be used to add further power to Hisuian Zoroark's already formidable prowess. Life Orb ensures that +2 Shadow Ball OHKOes Volcarona, physically defensive Rotom-W, and Corviknight after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Hisuian Zoroark functions best as a setup sweeper on hyper and bulky offense teams. Great Tusk is a top-class partner, providing Hisuian Zoroark invaluable utility with its excellent defenses and Rapid Spin, which keeps entry hazards off Hisuian Zoroark's side of the field and leaves its Focus Sash intact. It also provides Hisuian Zoroark more opportunities to come in and set up by threatening Pokemon that hold it down indefinitely, such as Clodsire. Dragapult and Meowscarada are faster than Hisuian Zoroark, so Pokemon that can come in and revenge kill them, such as Kingambit, are also appreciated. In return, Hisuian Zoroark can use Illusion to mask itself as Kingambit or Roaring Moon and lure in physical walls like defensive Great Tusk and Dondozo to weaken or KO them. Entry hazard setters like Glimmora, Meowscarada, and Garchomp set up hazards to chip down foes into Hisuan Zoroark's KO range, and it can stop an incoming Rapid Spin from Great Tusk in return. Hisuian Zoroark can force damage on special walls like Ting-Lu, which is highly appreciated by other special attackers like Iron Moth and Hydreigon, and vice versa. In particular, Hydreigon and Hisuian Zoroark can play Illusion mind games with Fighting-type moves, and Hydreigon can topple Clodsire with Earth Power and Substitute or Tera Steel.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Amoonguss is the tier's sole defensive user of Spore, as it can stick around and put foes to sleep throughout a match. Giga Drain affords Amoonguss extra longevity, which is particularly helpful because Regenerator often cannot keep up with the damage that Amoonguss takes. However, Grass Knot hits foes like Dondozo, Garganacl, and Ting-Lu harder. Clear Smog removes the boosts of setup sweepers like Dragonite, Dragon Dance Dragapult, and Bulk Up Great Tusk. Foul Play, on the other hand, gives Amoonguss a way to pressure Dragapult immediately while still punishing physical setup sweepers. Red Card phazes setup sweepers like Iron Valiant and Walking Wake. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet lets Amoonguss punish U-turn users like Meowscarada and Scizor, while Covert Cloak is a valid option to check Garganacl more easily. Tera Water Amoonguss checks Cinderace, while Tera Fire Amoonguss can use Clear Smog safely on Tera Fire Breloom at the cost of becoming weak to Ground-types like Great Tusk. Maximum HP investment with 84 Special Defense EVs prevents a 2HKO from Choice Specs Dragapult's Shadow Ball; the rest of the investment is poured in Defense to better check Great Tusk.</p> <p>Amoonguss is best utilized on balance teams that appreciate it taking a foe out of commission with Spore. Gholdengo and Dragapult greatly appreciate this as well as Amoonguss's ability to check Ting-Lu. Cinderace and Kingambit are other good offensive teammates that appreciate Amoonguss threatening Dondozo. Because Amoonguss relies mostly on Regenerator for its recovery, entry hazard removal in the form of Great Tusk or Iron Treads is key; Great Tusk also checks Cinderace, while Iron Treads can help deal with Gholdengo. Even though Amoonguss has the ability to check some setup sweepers with Clear Smog, it is best to pair it with an Unaware teammate like Skeledirge or Dondozo, which can handle Pokemon like Tera Flying Roaring Moon much more effectively. Pokemon like Dragonite and Choice Band Roaring Moon also make for good partners, as Amoonguss is one of the best Iron Valiant checks.</p>"

Furthermore, its excellent typing and great physical bulk allow it to check threats like Cinderace and Dragonite and absorb Knock Off from common Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads, preserving its teammate's Heavy-Duty Boots. Whirlpool further enhances Alomomola's pivoting abilities, letting it trap switch-ins and pivot out to the appropriate answer while preventing their double switch. In conjunction with Protect, Whirlpool also racks up passive damage on offensive Pokemon and walls such as Rotom-W and Ting-Lu that lack reliable recovery. Protect also allows Alomomola to heal itself with Wish, scout the moves of powerful wallbreakers, and prevent them from forcing progress when paired with Future Sight. Chilling Water makes Alomomola a more self-sufficient physical wall, reducing its passivity against sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Ceruledge, and Bulk Up Great Tusk. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Alomomola to avoid entry hazard damage before getting struck by Knock Off, which is especially important against Toxic Spikes. Minimizing Alomomola's Speed allows it to underspeed Corviknight to hit the incoming switch-in from U-turn instead and thus, avoid wasting PP due to Pressure. Tera Flying improves Alomomola's matchup against Great Tusk and Meowscarada, turning it into an even better Knock Off absorber, and lets it wall Breloom. It also makes Alomomola immune to Spikes and allows it to take less passive damage from Salt Cure.</p> <p>Alomomola's Wish and ability to blanket check various threats benefit all of its teammates on stall teams. Toxapex is an exceptional partner that forms a strong Regenerator core with Alomomola. Together, they can stall Garganacl out of Salt Cure PP and pivot around strong physical attackers such as Breloom, Choice Band Dragapult, and Roaring Moon. Dondozo handles physical sweepers too powerful for Alomomola to deal with, such as Kingambit and Azumarill, and greatly appreciates Wish due to its lack of reliable recovery. Alomomola's low special bulk mandates sturdy specially defensive partners; Clodsire can take on special sweepers such as Gholdengo and Hydreigon that attempt to use Alomomola as setup fodder, while Blissey switches into the tier's most powerful special wallbreakers, such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Hisuian Zoroark. Ting-Lu checks special attackers like Dragapult and Iron Moth and, alongside Clodsire and Toxapex, sets entry hazards that can quickly wear down offensive teams to let Alomomola apply more pressure with Whirlpool. Like Dondozo, it also greatly appreciates Wish to reduce its reliance on Rest. Talonflame carries Defog to account for Alomomola's vulnerability to entry hazards after taking Knock Off. Corviknight can do the same as well as absorb Knock Off for Alomomola. In addition, Talonflame checks Breloom, while Corviknight checks Meowscarada, which lets Alomomola preserve its Terastallization. Lastly, Gholdengo checks Breloom and Iron Valiant, appreciates Alomomola dealing with Cinderace and Great Tusk, and provides stall with a setup sweeper to break down balance teams with Nasty Plot.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With Nasty Plot, well-rounded stats, great coverage, and rather decent Speed, Hydreigon makes for a great wallbreaker. Substitute allows it to set up Nasty Plot safely, avoid would-be detrimental threats such as Garganacl's Salt Cure and status from Toxapex, Clodsire, and Rotom-W, and take advantage of the switches it forces. For its fourth move, Hydreigon can utilize Earth Power to dent Pokemon that can comfortably take a Dark Pulse such as Kingambit, Toxapex, and Garganacl. Alternatively, Flash Cannon provides coverage against Fairy-types, being able to OHKO Iron Valiant and Hatterene after a Nasty Plot, as well as having good chance to 2HKO Tera Fairy Garganacl and Skeledirge unboosted if running Life Orb. Draco Meteor can also be used as a strong neutral coverage option to straight up OHKO Great Tusk and dent Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Amoonguss. With Tera Steel, Hydreigon acquires a better defensive typing, turning its weaknesses into resistances, improving its matchups against would-be threats like Dragonite, Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Roaring Moon. Tera Steel also boosts its Flash Cannon, able to OHKO Hatterene unboosted with Life Orb. Tera Poison can also be used to grant Hydreigon a Fighting resistance and more importantly, resisting both of Iron Valiant's STAB moves. Both Tera types also give Hydreigon the ability to switch into Toxapex and Clodsire safely due to their immunity to poison, and they both work well with Levitate, which provides an immunity against an otherwise super effective attack.</p> <p>Hydreigon best fits on various offense and balance teams. Rotom-W is a good teammate since it can spread paralysis against faster Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Dragapult and bring Hydreigon in safely on walls like Amoonguss and Toxapex via Volt Switch. Other defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Skeledirge make for good teammates since they can switch into Iron Valiant, Breloom, and Volcarona. Faster offensive Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Choice Specs Dragapult match up well against offensive teams that can overwhelm Hydreigon easily by KOing Pokemon like opposing Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark, respectively. In return, Hydreigon can overwhelm Pokemon that they typically struggle with such as Skeledirge and Kingambit. Entry hazards from the likes of Garganacl, Clodsire, and Glimmora are appreciated to wear down foes into Hydreigon's KO range; the former two Pokemon can also check Volcarona and Choice Specs Dragapult defensively, which would otherwise revenge kill Hydreigon easily—even if it's behind a Substitute—thanks to Bug Buzz and Infiltrator. If Hydreigon isn't running Earth Power, teammates that can deal with Kingambit such as Breloom and Great Tusk are appreciated; Great Tusk can also remove Stealth Rock so Hydreigon isn't worn down easily, especially if it's running Life Orb. The two of them can also handle Ting-Lu, which can otherwise wall Hydreigon and phaze it with Whirlwind. Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Dragonite appreciate Hydreigon threatening Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Dondozo for them to sweep more easily.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Landorus-T is an effective Choice Scarf user thanks to its high Attack stat and useful movepool. This, combined with its typing, natural bulk, and exceptional ability in Intimidate, makes it a good offensive pivot. U-turn is useful for generating momentum and bringing in teammates safely when the foe is forced to switch out. Stone Edge hits Flying-types such as Enamorus, Zapdos, Dragonite, and Moltres, notably providing good coverage alongside Earthquake. Grass Knot is crucial for hitting Great Tusk, which would otherwise comfortably take Landorus-T's physical attacks. It is also the best option for hitting Dondozo and Tera Water, Curse, or Iron Defense Garganacl. Tera Ground can be used to boost Landorus-T's already strong Earthquake, potentially helping it clean late-game when all Ground-immune foes have been removed. Tera Blast can be used alongside Tera Flying, as it still hits Great Tusk hard while also hitting Amoonguss and Zamazenta for super effective damage. It also guarantees an OHKO against Iron Valiant. Becoming pure Flying-type also lets Landorus-T potentially survive priority moves such as Aqua Jet from Hisuian Samurott in a pinch.</p> <p>Landorus-T fits well on balanced and bulky offense teams that appreciate speed control and the ability to generate momentum. Wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Enamorus appreciate being brought in safely with U-turn. Choice Specs Enamorus and Choice Specs Dragapult especially appreciate being in against certain Pokemon that commonly switch into Landorus-T, such as Great Tusk and defensive Zapdos. Offensive Zapdos can also take advantage of these Pokemon while forming a potent VoltTurn core with Landorus-T. Faster special attackers such as Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Enamorus are problematic for Landorus-T. Therefore, specially defensive Galarian Slowking is a solid teammate to help deal with them. It also consistently switches into Rotom-W, which takes very little from Landorus-T's attacks. Furthermore, Galarian Slowking forms a momentum-generating core with Landorus-T and provides Future Sight support, making Landorus-T more difficult for foes to switch into. Great Tusk forms a strong core alongside Landorus-T to deal with physical attackers such as Sneasler and Cinderace that tend to be overwhelming for one of them to take on alone. Notably, Landorus-T outspeeds Cinderace and can threaten it before getting burned by Will-O-Wisp.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Defensive Landorus-T is a reliable pivot on balance and bulky offensive teams, leveraging its good typing, bulk, and Intimidate to serve as a roadblock to common threats such as Kingambit, Sneasler, and Great Tusk without Ice Spinner. Its Spikes immunity and neutrality to Stealth Rock allow it to comfortably switch in and check the aforementioned Pokemon. Landorus-T is also an excellent Stealth Rock user thanks to its good matchups against key entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and Cinderace. U-turn enables Landorus-T to pivot out of bad matchups and safely bring one of its teammates in. The last slot is flexible depending on a team's needs. Grass Knot deals high damage to Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Tera Water Garganacl, which could otherwise switch in and set up on Landorus-T, and it is useful to open up for teammates such as Kingambit to reliably clean late-game. However, Grass Knot also leaves Landorus-T quite exploitable to key Flying-types and Tera Flying Pokemon such as Moltres, Dragonite, and Kingambit, which can either cripple it with status or setup on it. Taunt is a useful utility move to stop entry hazards from Ting-Lu and Great Tusk and to prevent Enamorus-T and Garganacl from setting up. Finally, Smack Down deals decent damage to Landorus-T's common Flying-type switch-ins as well as Rotom-W, either leaving them vulnerable to Earthquake or forcing them out. 4 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Jolly Kingambit and deal good damage to it with Earthquake. As Landorus-T is a support Pokemon, it will often be more valuable to use Terastallization with other teammates. However, Tera Water lets Landorus-T resist Ice- and Water-type moves from Pokemon such as Greninja, Alolan Ninetales, and Walking Wake. Alternatively, Tera Ghost can be run to spinblock against Great Tusk while still maintaining its positive matchup against Fighting-type moves. Rocky Helmet is the preferred item, as it forces valuable chip damage on key targets such as Sneasler, Great Tusk, and Kingambit. Leftovers can also be run to grant Landorus-T a bit more longevity. Landorus-T typically fits quite well on teams with multiple pivot move users such as Sneasler, Cinderace, and Zapdos, as they can continually apply pressure to each other's counters, especially if entry hazards are up. Zapdos and Rotom-W have the added benefit of having good matchups against Flying-types, which Landorus-T struggles with. Galarian Slowking matches up quite well against strong special attackers such as Zapdos and Enamorus and appreciates Landorus-T's ability to pivot into physical attackers such Great Tusk, Kingambit, and Swords Dance Iron Valiant. Spikes setters such as Ting-Lu and Hisuian Samurott form a potent hazard-stacking core with Landorus-T and can pressure entry hazard removers such as Cinderace and Great Tusk. Strong wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Choice Specs Iron Valiant, and Choice Band Hoopa greatly benefit from Landorus-T's U-turn support, as it can position them to fire off their powerful attacks with little risk and can wear the opposing Pokemon down over time to be in their KO range. Landorus-T is quite exploitable by fast Water-types such as Battle Bond Greninja and Walking Wake; bulky Water-types such as Toxapex can help alleviate the pressure from these Pokemon. Landorus-T's ability to lure and overwhelm physical walls such as Dondozo and Great Tusk with Grass Knot is greatly appreciated by various physical setup sweepers such as Kingambit, Swords Dance Iron Valiant, and Hisuian Samurott.</p>"

      "Substitute + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>This more offensive set allows Landorus-T to take advantage of its varied movepool and high attacking stats to cause headaches to common teambuilding structures in SV OU while still retaining its usefulness as an Intimidate pivot; as such, Substitute is essential mostly to ease prediction, but it can also catch unsuspecting players trying to use a status move on Landorus-T, such as Moltres's Will-O-Wisp or Amoonguss's Spore. Smack Down is important to let Landorus-T threaten a KO on Corviknight, Rotom-W, Zapdos, Moltres, or even Enamorus the next turn with Earthquake, and even if the opponent switches out, Earthquake is likely to strongly dent their team, unless they're running more than one Pokemon immune to Ground. Stone Edge, on top of its great coverage with Earthquake, provides a more immediate hit on Zapdos, which is useful for more offensive variants that outpace Landorus-T, as these force Landorus-T to take damage before being able to KO Zapdos. Stone Edge also OHKOes Moltres and Enamorus, but it comes at the price of being unable to dent Corviknight or Rotom-W, which is undesirable. Grass Knot rounds out Landorus-T's coverage as a way to do massive damage to Great Tusk; Garganacl after Iron Defense, Curse, or Tera Water; and Dondozo. Tera Water allows Landorus-T to turn its Ice and Water weaknesses around and thus better check Ice Spinner Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott. A Naive nature is best alongside maximum Speed investment to make sure Landorus-T outpaces Great Tusk and most defensive Zapdos variants and Speed ties with other Landorus-T. 24 Special Attack EVs allow Landorus-T to 2HKO physically defensive Garganacl with Grass Knot if its Leftovers has been removed, but maximum Attack EVs can also be run instead.</p> <p>Substitute Landorus-T is commonly found on bulky offense and balance teams, bringing the gap between a wallbreaker and a bulky pivot. To aid its wallbreaking efforts, however, Landorus-T strongly appreciates Spikes support from the likes of Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu to help wear down its switch-ins, as Landorus-T commonly causes the opponent to switch around, and, most importantly, put Great Tusk in range of going down to a single Grass Knot. While Landorus-T has great coverage for most of the tier and is a strong wallbreaker against most balance and bulky offense teams, there are still a few Pokemon that it gives free switches to. Iron Defense Zamazenta doesn't take much from Landorus-T's Earthquake, especially with Dauntless Shield activated, and can use Landorus-T as setup fodder with Iron Defense. Physically defensive variants of Galarian Slowking, Moltres, and Zapdos help remedy this, and the former three also help bring Landorus-T for wallbreaking opportunities via Chilly Reception, Volt Switch, and U-turn. Calm Mind Cresselia is another dangerous setup sweeper that Landorus-T allows to come in for free. Kingambit and Encore Tera Dark or Steel Iron Valiant pose great answers to it while also appreciating Landorus-T spreading damage around for them to clean up, especially if an unsuspecting Great Tusk is taken out via Grass Knot. Great Tusk itself is also a great partner, as going with a more offensive set on Landorus-T makes it less reliable of a check to physical attackers, which Great Tusk helps handle; in return Great Tusk appreciates opposing Great Tusk being taken out via Grass Knot, making it easier for defensive variants to win the hazard game and offensive variants to sweep or dent the opposing team.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Heavy-Duty Boots Kyurem is an incredibly powerful Pokemon with very few switch-ins, leveraging its hefty natural bulk and monstrous offensive stats to threaten a large portion of the tier with its perfect coverage. Both Ice Beam and Freeze-Dry are fantastic STAB options, with the raw power of Ice Beam supplemented by Freeze-Dry's super effective coverage into bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Dondozo. Earth Power is a great coverage move that allows Kyurem to hit common switch-ins like Galarian Slowking, Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Heatran, and Draco Meteor rounds out the set with a powerful nuke that tears through neutral targets like Darkrai, Deoxys-S, and Terastallized Ting-Lu while notably securing a notable OHKO on Gouging Fire. Scale Shot is a weaker alternative that boosts Kyurem's Speed to patch up its middling Speed tier and thwart revenge killing attempts by otherwise faster Pokemon such as Dragapult and Zamazenta. It also targets special walls like Blissey on their frailer Defense and hits Volcarona hard to prevent it from using Kyurem as setup fodder. A Naive nature is selected for a mixed set with Scale Shot in order to still survive Iron Boulder's Mighty Cleave from full HP. A Hasty nature can also be considered for a better matchup into Volcarona and to avoid an OHKO from Iron Valiant's Moonblast. Tera Ice synergizes with Kyurem's double Ice-type STAB attacks to blast holes through teams, allowing it to 2HKO both physically defensive Clefable and Corviknight with Ice Beam. Tera Ground can be used instead to change Kyurem's defensive profile entirely while giving it a STAB boost to Earth Power, securing crucial 2HKOs on both Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge along with dropping offensive Gholdengo in a single hit. Additionally, both Tera types drop Kyurem's weaknesses to Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon like Dragapult and Enamorus, with Tera Ground also removing its Fighting- and Rock-type weaknesses to block revenge killing attempts from Zamazenta and Iron Boulder.</p> <p>Kyurem is a perfect fit for entry hazard-stacking teams that opt to neglect removal in favor of putting hazards up on both sides, as Heavy-Duty Boots allows Kyurem to switch in freely, and its lack of power from no boosting item is made up for by switch-ins being forced to take chip damage on entry. Good defensive hazard setters that pair well with Kyurem include Skarmory and Gliscor with their Steel- and Fighting-type resistances, respectively. Faster teammates are also appreciated to help cover for Kyurem's mediocre Speed, with fast Knock Off users such as Meowscarada and Weavile being great picks for balance teams and Iron Boulder as a good pairing on more offensive builds. Another partner that works particularly well is Knock Off Clefable, which switches into Dragon- and Fighting-type attacks from Dragapult and Zamazenta and invites in Kyurem's defensive checks like Galarian Slowking, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Air Balloon Heatran to remove their items, making them more susceptible to chip damage and allowing Kyurem to hit the latter two with Earth Power. Galarian Slowking itself is a bulky pivot that has great synergy with Kyurem, as it stifles revenge killing attempts of Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks from checks like Iron Valiant and Enamorus, and it can not only can bring in Kyurem freely with Chilly Reception but also sets up snow to make it significantly harder to revenge kill. Offensively, Kyurem pairs well with threats that can force in walls weak to it such as Gliscor, Skarmory, and Great Tusk, making Kingambit a natural partner.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Battle Bond Greninja is an extremely powerful cleaner thanks to its great STAB moves, wonderful coverage, and solid Special Attack and excellent Speed, which are boosted to astronomical levels the first time it KOes an enemy. After Battle Bond activates, Greninja can outpace threats that are already considered very fast, including Choice Scarfers like Enamorus and Sneasler and Booster Energy users like Iron Valiant, Walking Wake, and Iron Moth. Hydro Pump is extremely powerful, always OHKOing uninvested Kingambit after Battle Bond activates and having a significant chance to OHKO it with just Tera Water while at worst 2HKOing much of the tier with both Battle Bond and Tera Water active, but Surf is a more consistent alternative; Greninja will need to rely more on entry hazard support to secure OHKOs against threats like the aforementioned Kingambit, but it is still more than capable of OHKOing many offensive threats with Battle Bond and Tera Water active. Grass Knot rounds out Greninja's coverage by OHKOing Tera Water Garganacl and opposing Greninja with Battle Bond active, having a high chance to OHKO Hisuian Samurott after Stealth Rock even without Battle Bond active, and 2HKOing Dondozo. Water Shuriken can pick off weakened faster threats like +1 Iron Valiant, Unburden Sneasler, Choice Scarf Enamorus, and +1 Great Tusk, and in a pinch it can act as insurance against greatly weakened threats like Dragapult. With a Modest nature and rain support from Pelipper, it also OHKOes Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock with a Battle Bond Boost as long as it hits at least three times, which makes up for the loss in Speed from foregoing a Timid nature. Water Shuriken also helps deal with Kingambit's Sucker Punch, which can otherwise greatly threaten Greninja if it has been weakened or shed its Dark resistance with Tera Water. Ice Beam, on the other hand, reliably handles Water-resistant threats like Dragonite, Amoonguss, Rillaboom, Meowscarada, and Tera Grass Galarian Slowking.</p> <p>Battle Bond Greninja greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Ting-Lu, Glimmora, and Hisuian Samurott to wear threats down over the course of a game; for instance, enabling it to KO Kingambit with Tera Water Surf and take out Amoonguss more easily once Battle Bond is already active. Moreover, the chip damage from entry hazards can help wear down faster threats like Booster Energy Iron Valiant Choice Scarf Enamorus, putting them into Water Shuriken range. In that vein, Gholdengo is another excellent teammate due to its ability to prevent hazard removal; it can also use its powerful STAB moves alongside Choice Specs or a Nasty Plot boost to wallbreak and wear down the opposing team, allowing Greninja to finish the job. Other powerful offensive threats like Iron Valiant and especially Kingambit greatly appreciate Battle Bond Greninja's ability to break past various threats like Corviknight, Dondozo, Great Tusk, Heatran, and Landorus-T to assist their late-game sweeps; in return, they can help weaken threats like Walking Wake and Dragonite. Kingambit in particular can handle threats like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Terastallized Galarian Slowking, which Greninja may struggle to muscle past. Lastly, Battle Bond Greninja is a natural fit on rain teams, as the boost from Pelipper's Drizzle alongside a Modest nature, Tera Water, and Battle Bond allows Greninja's Hydro Pump to accomplish ludicrous feats such as outright OHKOing specially defensive pivot Galarian Slowking, OHKOing Roaring Moon after Stealth Rock, and even 2HKOing Assault Vest Toxapex more reliably. Basculegion is another rain staple that synergizes well with Greninja, as one can weaken their shared checks like Rotom-W and Walking Wake to enable the other's sweep. Lastly, Zapdos offers rain teams an effective means of dealing with Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Tera Water Galarian Slowking, ensuring that Greninja doesn't have to waste precious turns attacking them and getting worn down by their attacks alongside Life Orb recoil.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "outdated": true,
        "description": "<p>When equipped with Choice Specs, Greninja becomes a potent wallbreaker thanks to its great coverage and Protean. Since Choice Specs ensures it only uses one attack per switch-in, even though Protean only activates once per switch-in, Greninja will have STAB every time it attacks. Hydro Pump is Greninja's most powerful move, pummeling both offensive and defensive Water-weak Pokemon like Cinderace, Skeledirge, and Great Tusk. Dark Pulse hits the likes of Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Hisuian Zoroark super effectively while also dealing the most damage to Toxapex and Rotom-W. Dark Pulse's flinch chance can also come in clutch against the aforementioned walls. Ice Beam eviscerates Amoonguss, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Dragon-types like Dragonite and Roaring Moon. Grass Knot can OHKO Dondozo, Garganacl, and Walking Wake after minor chip damage, and it deals good damage to lighter Water-types like Quaquaval and Azumarill. Alternatively, Spikes lets Greninja wear down checks like Toxapex while taking advantage of the switches it often forces. In addition, Greninja also beats common entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Corviknight, making Spikes easy to maintain. Tera Water further enhances Greninja's already powerful Hydro Pump to extreme levels, letting it OHKO Pokemon like Corviknight, Hatterene, and Unaware Clodsire. Meanwhile, Tera Dark lets Greninja 2HKO Toxapex and Rotom-W with Dark Pulse.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja fits best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams as a menacing wallbreaker. Stealth Rock setters like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Glimmora are amazing for Spikes Greninja, as it can create a hazard-stacking core with them. Alternatively, these Pokemon can also let Greninja drop Spikes for Grass Knot, as they can set up hazards and Grass Knot overwhelming Dondozo and Walking Wake. Strong offensive Pokemon like Kingambit and mixed Iron Valiant make for excellent partners, as Greninja threatens their checks like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Garchomp for the former, and Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and Clodsire for the latter. They can also threaten Pokemon that would otherwise revenge kill Greninja, such as Dragapult and Meowscarada, granting Greninja more consistency against teams with these Pokemon.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "outdated": true,
        "description": "<p>Greninja is an excellent dedicated lead due to its high Speed tier alongside Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and valuable utility options. It differentiates itself from Meowscarada due to its better matchup against other leads as well as entry hazard setters and removers such as Glimmora, Iron Treads, Garchomp, Toxic Spikes Iron Moth, and Court Change Cinderace. Taunt has various applications; it blocks Amoonguss's Spore, prevents entry hazards from the likes of Ting-Lu and leads like Glimmora and Iron Treads, stops Defog from Corviknight, and prevents setup from Pokemon Roaring Moon, Kingambit, and Tera Water Garganacl that attempt to exploit Greninja's relative passivity. Greninja can choose to run Toxic Spikes to punish offensive teams filled with setup sweepers like Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant better, but Ice Beam OHKOes Garchomp and dents Water-resistant Pokemon like Dragonite, Meowscarada, Dragapult, Tera Grass Glimmora, and Water Absorb Clodsire, especially if its Focus Sash is still intact for the former three. Focus Sash guarantees that Greninja can set at least one layer of entry hazards and works extremely well to safely put it into Torrent range, which allows Surf to OHKO Hisuian Zoroark and provides significant odds to OHKO Iron Valiant, one of the biggest threats to offense teams. Alternatively, Protean improves Ice Beam's damage and allows Greninja to block Volt Switch from Rotom-W, Iron Treads, and Sandy Shocks when using Spikes, maintaining offensive momentum. Tera Water boosts Greninja's Surf, notably netting the OHKO on specially defensive Garganacl and 2HKO on Tera Fairy Skeledirge with Torrent, as well as the 2HKO on Gholdengo and Corviknight after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Greninja is perfectly suited for hyper offense teams. Offensive teammates like Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon put further pressure on entry hazard removers such as Corviknight, Iron Treads, and Great Tusk to maintain Greninja's Spikes throughout the game and enjoy Spikes chipping down their checks like Garganacl, Clodsire, Amoonguss, and Dondozo. They also appreciate Spikes invalidating Focus Sash from Pokemon like Hisuian Zoroark, Ceruledge, and Meowscarada. Aside from possessing insane late-game potential themselves, Kingambit and Iron Moth particularly help against Meowscarada—one of the few leads that can easily beat Greninja—and Hatterene, which can freely switch into Greninja and reflect its Taunt and entry hazards with Magic Bounce, with Calm Mind variants using it as setup fodder as well. Kingambit in particular appreciates Greninja's tendency to faint early-game to accumulate Supreme Overlord boosts. Knock Off from Bulk Up Great Tusk and Swords Dance Iron Valiant can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from walls like Dondozo, Slowking, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge, making them susceptible to Greninja's Spikes. Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragon Dance Dragapult can spinblock the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch to keep Greninja's Spikes up; Gholdengo in particular does it exceptionally well by blocking Defog and Glimmora's Mortal Spin as well, and it has the added benefit of threatening Hatterene and crippling walls like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu with Choice item + Trick, making them more vulnerable to Greninja's entry hazards.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Band Hoopa-U is an extremely strong physical wallbreaker that can be very threatening to more balanced and defensive teams due to its massive Attack stat and reliable STAB move in Hyperspace Fury, which is capable of impressive feats such as 2HKOing physically defensive Corviknight and Toxapex the majority of the time and always 2HKOing physically defensive Rotom-W. Zen Headbutt is a nice complementary STAB move, allowing Hoopa-U to smack prominent Fighting-types like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Iron Valiant that may try to switch in on a predicted Hyperspace Fury. Drain Punch hits Dark-types like Kingambit and Ting-Lu, while Gunk Shot offers coverage against Fairy-types like Enamorus and Azumarill, as well as Tera Fairy Moltres, Garganacl, Kingambit, and Baxcalibur. A Jolly nature allows Hoopa-U to outspeed Pokemon like Timid Heatran, Modest Gholdengo, and Timid Volcanion, while an Adamant nature allows Hoopa-U to hit even harder, 2HKOing Garganacl the majority of the time. Tera Dark boosts the power of Hyperspace Fury even further, 2HKOing physically defensive Dondozo; Tera Dark also offers the additional benefit of making Hoopa-U resist other Dark-type attacks, which can be crucial against Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Hoopa-U fits well on bulky offense teams that are in need of a physical wallbreaker. Physical setup sweepers like Kingambit, Baxcalibur, and Dragonite appreciate Hoopa-U's presence on a team, as Hoopa-U is able to break through or dent physically defensive Pokemon that could stand in their way, like Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Rotom-W. One of Hoopa-U's biggest challenges is safely getting on the field due to its frail physical defense and quadruple weakness to U-turn, so it pairs well with pivots such as Chilly Reception Galarian Slowking, U-turn Dragapult, and Volt Switch Zapdos. Hoopa-U is also held back by its middling Speed, which tends to exacerbate Hoopa-U's physical frailty, so it appreciates paralysis support from partners like Rotom-W and Substitute Dragapult. Static Zapdos is a particularly notable partner for Hoopa-U, because it is able to switch in and potentially paralyze faster Pokemon like Cinderace and Dragapult, rendering those Pokemon no longer threatening to Hoopa-U. Pokemon that can set entry hazards like Ting-Lu, Heatran, and Landorus-T help facilitate with Hoopa-U breaking through its switch-ins. Opposing physical Dark-types, such as Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, and Roaring Moon, typically force Hoopa-U out, especially after a Defense drop. For this reason, sturdy Dark-resistant teammates like Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Low Kick Kingambit synergize well with Hoopa-U, while those Pokemon also appreciate Hoopa-U punching holes in the opposing team's defensive backbone.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Hoopa-U is an incredibly threatening special wallbreaker, especially to slower and more defensive teams, that is able to OHKO the majority of the tier and 2HKO essentially every other relevant Pokemon. This is thanks to Hoopa-U's astronomically high Special Attack stat and potent dual STAB combination. Focus Blast rounds out its coverage, allowing Hoopa-U to hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Hisuian Samurott; Focus Blast also OHKOes specially defensive Heatran after entry hazard chip. Trick can be run in the fourth slot to cripple the few special walls that Hoopa-U is unable to reliably blast through, like Blissey, Scream Tail, and Alolan Muk, while also affording Hoopa-U the ability to switch moves, alleviating the need for prediction in exchange for less immediate power. Alternatively, Thunderbolt can be used instead as Hoopa-U's best option to hit Corviknight and Galarian Moltres while also providing a more reliable option than Focus Blast to OHKO Hisuian Samurott and Greninja. A Timid nature makes Hoopa-U faster than Pokemon like Timid Heatran, Modest Gholdengo, and Timid Volcanion, while a Modest nature gives Hoopa-U even more breaking power so that it is able to potentially 2HKO Blissey and Alolan Muk with Focus Blast after entry hazard damage. Tera Dark increases the power of Dark Pulse, giving it an opportunity to 2HKO Scream Tail and specially defensive Heatran while also threatening to OHKO Baxcalibur, bulky Cinderace, and defensive Landorus-T. Tera Dark also makes Hoopa-U resist Dark-type attacks, which can prevent Kingambit from answering it with Sucker Punch. Quick special attackers like Choice Specs Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus make good teammates, as they appreciate Hoopa-U's ability to break through even the bulkiest of specially defensive walls. One of Hoopa-U's biggest flaws is that its physical frailty and crippling 4x weakness to U-turn can make it difficult for it to safely be brought onto the field. As a result, Hoopa-U greatly benefits from being paired alongside pivots that can facilitate its entry, like Galarian Slowking with Chilly Reception; Landorus-T, Dragapult, and Sneasler with U-turn; and Rotom-W and Zapdos with Volt Switch. Paralysis support from Thunder Wave users like Rotom-W, Substitute Dragapult, and defensive Gholdengo can help alleviate Hoopa-U's lackluster Speed and make previously faster threats easy targets. Static Zapdos synergizes particularly well with Hoopa-U in this regard, since Zapdos can punish U-turns directed at Hoopa-U from faster Pokemon like Cinderace, Sneasler, and Meowscarada to potentially paralyze them. Hoopa-U also appreciates the inclusion of hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott, Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, and Heatran, allowing it to punch holes in defensive backbones more easily and damage the opposing team thanks to the switches it forces. Some of the most difficult Pokemon for Hoopa-U to handle are opposing Dark-types like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Ting-Lu, and Hisuian Samurott because they can force Hoopa-U to rely on Focus Blast and good prediction to break through. To help mitigate this issue, Pokemon that can reliably switch into Dark-types like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Azumarill also make good partners for Hoopa-U, and in return they appreciate Choice Specs Hoopa-U's ability to threaten physical walls as well. Bulk Up Great Tusk and Belly Drum Azumarill can also clean up late-game after Hoopa-U wears down the opposing team.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Equipping Hoopa-U with an Assault Vest makes the most of its excellent coverage and surprisingly high special bulk, letting it trade with various special attackers like Dragapult and Walking Wake. Strong Knock Off is a large reason to use this set, as it is an excellent progress maker, particularly against bulkier teams. Psychic is run over Zen Headbutt for its higher accuracy and better damage against physically defensive Pokemon like Zapdos and Great Tusk. Drain Punch provides Hoopa-U with adequate recovery and logevity, and it is largely used to hit Kingambit and other Dark-types, which otherwise walls this set. Gunk Shot provides important coverage for Fairy-types like Enamorus and Tera Fairy foes like Garganacl while potentially poisoning checks like Ting Lu. Tera Poison not only empowers its Gunk Shot but also gives it a crucial Fairy and U-turn resistance. 248 HP and 40 Defense investment with a Lonely Nature allows Hoopa-U to survive one Sucker Punch from Adamant Kingambit with a maximum Supreme Overlord boost and gives it an easier time against weaker physical attacks from Pokemon like Garganacl and Clodsire. Meanwhile, 84 SpA EVs give Hoopa-U a guaranteed OHKO on Iron Moth with Psychic and 92 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Jolly Kingambit. Hoopa-U is best utilized on bulky offense teams that can support a slow, powerful wallbreaker like it while still appreciating its ability to trade hits with common special attackers. It is incredibly physically frail, so pairing it with physically bulky Pokemon like Garganacl and Great Tusk is a good idea, as it will often be forced out by physical attackers. Additionally, pivot support from Cinderace and Zapdos can put Hoopa-U in favorable positions to dish out damage with its strong attacks, something that is necessary given its aforementioned physical frailty. Because Hoopa-U often makes great progress with Knock Off, entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T are great teammate options. Hoopa-U excels at punching holes in the opposition, so faster offensive teammates like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus are good ideas to take advantage of the resultant weakened foes. Teammates like Amoonguss and Galarian Slowking also deserve consideration for checking Iron Valiant and Enamorus without having to expend Terastallization.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Volcanion's high Special Attack and great offensive typing make it an excellent wallbreaker with solid defensive utility thanks to Water Absorb. Good coverage options as well as a powerful STAB move that can burn its foes make it very difficult to switch into. Earth Power is crucial for hitting Toxapex, which easily switches into both of Volcanion's STAB moves; it also hits Galarian Slowking harder, notably guaranteeing a 2HKO on physically defensive variants. Taunt is useful against bulkier Pokemon, preventing Dondozo or Toxapex from using healing moves and Galarian Slowking from using Thunder Wave. Substitute eases prediction, as Volcanion can force switches, and it takes advantage of certain Pokemon that fail to break the Substitute such as bulky Cinderace and non-Assault Vest Toxapex while still avoiding status attempts from the aforementioned walls. It also allows Volcanion to avoid Sucker Punch from Kingambit. Tera Blast alongside Tera Fairy can be used to hit Pokemon such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Hisuian Samurott. Becoming a Fairy-type offers useful defensive utility, giving it an immunity to both of Walking Wake's STAB moves and a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Tera Ground can be used to grant Volcanion an Electric immunity, improving its matching against Zapdows and Rotom-W, while also boosting Earth Power's damage. Both Tera types also neutralize its weakness to Earthquake from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Great Tusk. 140 Speed EVs are used to outspeed uninvested Great Tusk. Volcanion fits on bulky offense teams that appreciate a strong wallbreaker. Entry hazards, especially Spikes, make Volcanion much harder to deal with. Therefore, hazard setters including Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T make good partners. Ting-Lu can also switch into special attackers like Dragapult and Zapdos for Volcanion. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking cause problems for Volcanion, so teammates that can help overwhelm them such as Nasty Plot Gholdengo and Utility Dragapult are also useful. Finally, Swords Dance Iron Valiant and Kingambit can clean late-game once Volcanion has worn down the opposing team, and they also pressure the aforementioned specially defensive Pokemon. Kingambit in particular appreciates Volcanion's ability to deal with Fire-types like Cinderace and Moltres, and especially its immunity to Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Volcanion is a wallbreaker with absurd strength thanks to its sky high Special Attack and amazing high-Base Power moves, allowing it to make progress every time it is in. Steam Eruption is Volcanion's most spammable move and has very limited switch-ins, as many Pokemon that resist both of Volcanion's STAB moves like Dragapult, Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Hisuian Samurott end up getting 2HKOed or burned. Fire Blast is Volcanion's best move for Grass-types such as Meowscarada, Amoonguss, and Tera Grass Galarian Slowking. Earth Power helps immensely with Toxapex, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking. Sludge Bomb hits Azumarill and Tera Grass Heatran while crippling foes like Rotom-W more than burn, while Tera Blast Fairy can hit many Dragon types such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon as well as Pokemon like Assault Vest Hisuian Samurott. Tera Fairy also makes Volcanion immune to Dragon-type moves, negating both of Walking Wake's STAB types, and removes all of Volcanion's weaknesses, particularly to Ground-type attacks such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu and Landorus-T's Earthquake. Tera Fairy also allows Volcanion to resist Kingambit's Sucker Punch, making it a great revenge killing option. Tera Water and Tera Fire make Steam Eruption and Fire Blast even stronger, allowing Volcanion to muscle through Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and even 2HKO physically defensive Toxapex. Its main counters are Tera Water Galarian Slowking and Water Absorb or Tera Water Clodsire, alongside Blissey. Volcanion appreciates support from wallbreakers that can deal with these threats or wear them down, such as Black Glasses Kingambit and mixed Iron Valiant. Kingambit in particular loves Choice Specs Volcanion's matchup against Fire-types like Cinderace, Moltres, and Heatran. In turn, Kingambit has a good matchup versus the aforementioned counters and can help pressure other checks such as Toxapex. Dragapult can also be a great partner, as it provides pivoting and speed control along with adding pressure on said counters and checks and has the option to provide great support with Thunder Wave. Great Tusk is another great option, as it can provide hazard removal, which is crucial for Volcanion. It is also a great blanket check for physical attackers that threaten Volcanion, and it provides Knock Off support, making it one of the best defensive partners for Volcanion. Volcanion also fits great on VoltTurn teams, as it loves being brought in as many times as possible by Pokemon such as Cinderace, Dragapult, and Rotom-W.</p>"

Any attempts of boosting past Toxapex gets shut down easily by Haze, which combined with poison damage prevents Toxapex from being used as setup fodder by Pokemon such as Calm Mind Hatterene. Covert Cloak is an option to ignore Garganacl's Salt Cure, Dragapult and Gholdengo's Shadow Ball drops, and Greninja's Dark Pulse flinches, but Leftovers's longevity reduces Toxapex's reliance on Recover, and it is used over Black Sludge in case Toxapex decides to Terastallize. Tera Steel improves Toxapex's matchup against non-Earthquake Roaring Moon and Meowscarada while still maintaining an immunity to poison. Alternatively, Tera Fairy fares better against Dragapult, Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Choice Band Roaring Moon. The given EVs allow Toxapex to survive two Choice Band Meowscarada's Flower Trick from full health.</p> <p>Toxapex fits nicely on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate a sturdy defensive backbone. Teammates like Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl are terrific defensive partners that covers Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Tera Electric Iron Valiant, respectively. Corviknight and Great Tusk in particular provide a backup check to multiple combinations of physical attackers like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Kingambit that attempt to overwhelm Toxapex. They also remove entry hazards, which would mitigate Toxapex's Regenerator and force it to use Recover more often; in return, Toxapex covers Pokemon such as Cinderace for the former and Greninja for the latter. Bulky setup sweepers like Garganacl, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo can take advantage of Toxic Spikes slowly chipping down checks such as Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. Particularly, Skeledirge and Gholdengo can make use of Hex easily to take advantage of Toxapex spreading poison, as well as threaten Hatterene, which can block Toxapex's Toxic Spikes and use non-Haze variants as setup fodder. Offensive partners like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit compensate for Toxapex's overall passivity; in return, they appreciate Toxapex switching into their revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo, Scizor, and Iron Valiant, respectively.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Assault Vest allows Toxapex to maximize its Special Attack EVs, letting it turn the tables on offensive Pokemon looking to exploit its passivity with Taunt or Substitute, while retaining excellent special bulk to check threats such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Walking Wake, Iron Moth, and Iron Valiant. Surf does a solid chunk of damage to common Toxapex switch-ins like Kingambit, physically defensive Corviknight, and Gholdengo and often 2HKOes Garganacl after Stealth Rock. Sludge Bomb has good coverage alongside it, dealing heavy damage to Fairy-types like Iron Valiant, Hatterene, and Azumarill while breaking Hydreigon's Substitute. Sludge Bomb's high chance to poison can be critical for crippling Rotom-W and Slowking in the long term. Infestation provides a nice source of chip damage while letting Toxapex trap and beat defensive threats, such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Clodsire, in conjunction with Acid Spray. Furthermore, Infestation prevents the opponent from double switching on Toxapex, enabling much safer plays. Instead of Acid Spray, Ice Beam works to offer more immediate damage against Clodsire, Dragonite, Dragapult, and Amoonguss. Tera Blast, with Tera Fighting, is also viable to nab surprise KOs on Kingambit and Roaring Moon, which might otherwise set up on it. However, Fairy is the most standard Tera type for Toxapex, allowing it to block Dragon-type attacks from Dragapult and Walking Wake.</p> <p>Toxapex fits best on balance and bulky teams that appreciate its unique combination of bulk and power. Assault Vest Toxapex likes to pivot around aggressively and spread chip damage, thanks in part to Regenerator: entry hazard setters like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu can help it pressure opposing teams more, punishing opponents for switching out against it. Without either Haze or Toxic, Toxapex is vulnerable to setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Roaring Moon, so Unaware Pokemon such as Dondozo and Skeledirge are excellent teammates. Since Assault Vest Toxapex's physical bulk is rather lacking, physically defensive Pokemon like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Corviknight can offer much-needed switch-ins to the likes of Kingambit and Choice Band Roaring Moon. Toxapex can often struggle to make progress against bulkier teams due to its middling power and lack of Toxic, so it appreciates strong balance wallbreakers like Iron Valiant. Hydreigon deserves special mention as an excellent teammate, sharing near-perfect type synergy with Toxapex. Hydreigon checks key threats to Toxapex such as Armarouge, Kingambit, and Nasty Plot Gholdengo, and it can set up on bulkier Pokemon like defensive Great Tusk and Clodsire. In return, Toxapex can check Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Greninja, which can threaten Hydreigon. Finally, Scream Tail is also a great partner, using Wish to extend Toxapex's longevity and having solid defensive synergy with it.</p>"

Pyro Ball is its most reliable move, as it can hit hard while preserving Libero. Sucker Punch gives Cinderace a means to hit faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Dragapult super effectively. Alternatively, Gunk Shot can be run to OHKO Iron Valiant and Hatterene while preserving the team's ability to Terastallize. Court Change is an extremely useful move, as it can provide hazard control that is unaffected by Gholdengo's Good as Gold while also stealing Light Screen and Reflect from hyper offensive teams; however, Cinderace can choose to run High Jump Kick instead to hit Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Ting-Lu harder as well as inflicting more damage against Pokemon that resist Pyro Ball like Garchomp and Garganacl. Tera Fire is the Tera type that Cinderace wants to utilize in order to maximize Pyro Ball's damage, giving it the ability to, with an Adamant nature, OHKO Corviknight after Stealth Rock. It also helps Cinderace hit bulkier targets like Hatterene and offensive Great Tusk, especially if it isn't running Gunk Shot or High Jump Kick. A Jolly nature is preferred to augment Cinderace's role as a fast pivot, allowing it to outspeed Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Iron Treads. However, an Adamant nature can be run instead to increase its damage output.</p> <p>Cinderace works best on balance and bulky offense teams, providing utility and entry hazard control while simultaneously exerting offensive pressure. Defensive Water-type Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Dondozo can all sponge Water-type attacks while taking neutral damage from Rock- and Ground-type moves, with the exception of Toxapex. In turn, Cinderace can match up well against wallbreakers such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant and Meowscarada, which can all cause difficulties for the aforementioned Water-types. Ground-types that provide entry hazard support such as Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu make it easier for Cinderace to check threats with Stealth Rock and Spikes, especially if it is running an Adamant nature. Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Iron Valiant pair well with Cinderace, as they can eradicate foes that wall it such as Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Rotom-W. Similarly, Dragonite and Kingambit can check Pokemon such as Hatterene and Skeledirge, which can both cause issues for Cinderace. In return, Cinderace can provide hazard control for all of these partners and help them come in the field more safely without having to worry about chip damage from entry hazards.</p>"

      "Bulky Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Cinderace functions as an excellent bulky pivot thanks to its great Speed tier, serviceable bulk, and access to support moves such as Court Change and Will-O-Wisp. Cinderace can force out important offensive threats like Gholdengo and Iron Valiant with the threat of STAB Pyro Ball while keeping up momentum against defensive switch-ins with U-turn. Will-O-Wisp allows Cinderace to cripple physical attackers such as Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Great Tusk, and it can also negate Leftovers for defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu. Specifically, Will-O-Wisp offers a safe way for Cinderace to check Kingambit, since it avoids Sucker Punch mindgames. Finally, Court Change offers unmatched utility in providing entry hazard control that cannot be blocked by Gholdengo and is also able to steal opposing dual screens. The 32 Attack EVs guarantee a KO on Gholdengo sets lacking defensive investment and 2HKO on physically defensive Corviknight after Leftovers. Although this set rarely wants to Terastallize, Tera Fire can potentially come in handy for securing KOs with Pyro Ball, especially with a Blaze boost. Alternatively, Tera Flying grants Cinderace an immunity to Ground-type attacks, such as Great Tusk's Earthquake, which can grant it extra opportunities to KO foes or cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. Tera Flying also matches up well against common Ground-type hazard setters such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, letting Cinderace safely Court Change against them.</p> <p>Cinderace works best on bulkier teams where its ability to guarantee hazard removal shines. Defensive Pokemon such as Dondozo, Slowking, Toxapex, and Amoonguss are great teammates, as they appreciate Cinderace's ability to ensure hazard removal, freeing them up to run items other than Heavy-Duty Boots. Water-types such as Dondozo and Toxapex have notably strong synergy with Cinderace; Dondozo checks Great Tusk and Tera Fire Kingambit, while Toxapex can check Water-types, such as Walking Wake and Greninja. Hazard-weak breakers such as Iron Moth and Choice Band Dragonite also fit well with Cinderace, as it's able to bring them in with U-turn. These breakers also enjoy bulky Water-types like Toxapex or Dondozo being burnt, making it easier to overwhelm them long-term. Cinderace usually requires the presence of another hazard control Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Hatterene, or Corviknight so it doesn't get overwhelmed. Corviknight synergizes especially well with Cinderace thanks to its Ground immunity and ability to absorb Knock Off from Meowscarada, which outspeeds Cinderace. Skeledirge and Dragapult can take advantage of bulky Cinderace, since both completely wall it and can potentially set up a Substitute. Kingambit is a great partner, as it can offensively check both Skeledirge and Dragapult. In return, it appreciates Cinderace burning Great Tusk and Ting-Lu, opening up the way for it to sweep.</p>"

Brave Bird nails the likes of Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Meowscarada, Breloom, and Amoonguss, chips at neutral targets such as Azumarill, Hatterene, Dragapult, and Hisuian Zoroark. Body Press is Corviknight's best option against Kingambit and Roaring Moon. Leftovers is the preferred item to provide extra longevity, but Rocky Helmet can further punish physical attackers, especially on weak hits like Scizor's and Meowscarada's U-turn. Tera Water serves as an emergency check to dangerous Fire- and Water-types such as Cinderace and Floatzel. Alternatively, Tera Fighting grants it a resistance to Dark-type attacks and powers up its Body Press, letting it check Kingambit more easily.</p> <p>Corviknight is a fantastic slow pivot, making it a great partner for frail-but-powerful teammates like Greninja and Iron Valiant. It is also one of the few viable Defoggers, allowing it to partner up with teammates like Dragonite that loathe Stealth Rock. Be warned, Corviknight is utterly unable to Defog against Gholdengo, so secondary entry hazard removal like Great Tusk and a reliable switch-in like Ting-Lu are recommended. Corviknight is unable to handle powerful physical Fire-types like Cinderace and Ceruledge and Electric-types like Iron Hands. Teammates that can cover these weaknesses like Dondozo and Great Tusk are wonderful partners. Its middling special bulk makes teammates like Slowking and Ting-Lu valuable. Slowking has the added benefit of being another slow pivot as well, while Ting-Lu forms a strong entry hazard core with Corviknight and threatens Gholdengo.</p>"

Its Ghost typing also blocks common priority attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Breloom's Mach Punch, which allows it to sweep even when Psychic Terrain is not active. Though it is resisted by Steel-types, a Psychic Terrain-boosted Stored Power can still heavily damage even Corviknight, 2HKOing physically defensive variants after just one Shell Smash. Shadow Ball is a consistent STAB move with excellent neutral coverage to hit most Steel- and Psychic-types hard, OHKOing Gholdengo and Hatterene. Tera Blast with Tera Fighting fills a gap in Polteageist's coverage, eliminating Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Kingambit while Psychic Terrain is active, and Hydreigon. Tera Fighting can also let it survive their Dark-type attacks. Weak Armor alongside a Focus Sash allows Polteageist to punish a stray physical attack, further boosting its Speed—it can outspeed +1 foes like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth—and Stored Power's damage. Focus Sash also lets Polteageist set up against threats that would otherwise outpace it or survive an attack and OHKO it, such as Kingambit, Choice Specs Dragapult, and offensive Great Tusk. A Timid nature is run to outpace +1 Walking Wake after a single Shell Smash.</p> <p>Polteageist is a staple on Psychic Terrain offense teams. Indeedee's Psychic Terrain protects Polteageist against priority attacks from Kingambit, Azumarill, and Floatzel while powering up its Stored Power, though Polteageist requires both a Shell Smash and a Weak Armor boost to outpace Swift Swim Floatzel. Indeedee can also let Polteageist set up with Encore or give it a second chance to sweep with Healing Wish, although if Polteageist has already consumed its Focus Sash, it will struggle to set up as reliably a second time. Armarouge is an excellent teammate and another staple on Psychic Terrain teams, as it can eliminate Steel-types like Kingambit with Armor Cannon to enable Polteageist's late-game sweep and it can use Endure to activate Weak Armor multiple times against Dragon Darts Dragapult, which Polteageist cannot reliably set up against. In return, Polteageist can greatly weaken or outright eliminate Unaware walls, set up against specially offensive Dragapult if its Focus Sash is intact, and can safely utilize Tera Fighting to eliminate Roaring Moon and wear down Ting-Lu, which allows Armarouge to sweep. Entry hazard removal is extremely important to maintain Focus Sash's protection. Eject Pack Great Tusk provides both Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock support, can safely get Polteageist in after using a strong Headlong Rush or Close Combat, and can also switch into and threaten Dark-types for Polteageist. Magic Bounce Hatterene deters entry hazards, spreads paralysis with Nuzzle, and can provide Healing Wish support. Also, Eject Button lets it safely pivot Polteageist in, even against U-Turns from Corviknight, Cinderace, or Meowscarada, giving it much easier setup opportunities. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragapult appreciate Polteageist breaking past Unaware walls and wearing down Steel-types.

        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Hatterene is an excellent option on balance teams to deny entry hazards from being set up. With Magic Bounce, it can switch into and reflect entry hazards from Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Blissey. From there, it can begin setting up Calm Mind to pose a greater threat itself and overwhelm the opponent's defensive answers to it. Draining Kiss acts as pseudo-recovery and can help Hatterene heal off damage it's taken from Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk. Psyshock allows Hatterene to deal high damage to special walls such as Blissey and Clodsire and win potential setup wars against other Hatterene. Stored Power fulfills a similar role to Psyshock in enabling Hatterene to break through special walls and other Calm Mind users and can also help Hatterene defeat various Unaware Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Dondozo, but it requires Hatterene to set up multiple Calm Minds before it becomes truly potent. Mystical Fire deals high damage to many of Hatterene's common switch-ins such as Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Kingambit and has the nice bonus of lowering the target's Special Attack, which is particularly useful against Gholdengo that aren't running Covert Cloak. Nuzzle is another option to cripple switch-ins with paralysis, which can act as useful speed control for Hatterene's teammates. Substitute is another alternative that allows Hatterene to more easily set up in the face of weak hits such as Garganacl's Salt Cure and Clodsire's Earthquake. Tera Water nullifies all of Hatterene's weaknesses, which can grant it more opportunities to use Calm Mind against its checks such as Gholdengo, while Tera Fire can similarly neutralize all of Hatterene's weaknesses and comes with additional benefits such as boosting the damage of its Mystical Fire and letting it check Iron Valiant better. However, Tera Fire also comes with notable downsides, namely giving Hatterene a weakness to Ground-type moves and Stealth Rock, which can hinder its matchups against common entry hazard setters. The EV spread allows Hatterene to move reliably switch into physical attacks from common entry hazard setters while also outspeeding Toxapex and Garganacl.</p> <p>Hatterene's ability to discourage the use of entry hazards will be appreciated by almost any team. Pokemon vulnerable to entry hazards and those that frequently pivot in and out of battle such as Meowscarada, Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Dragapult enjoy Hatterene's support. Entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Corviknight are also good partners, as Hatterene's presence can ease the burden placed on them to remove entry hazards and grants the team greater flexibility in dealing with entry hazard setters. Furthermore, while Hatterene can switch into entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, it can be worn down quickly from their repeated Ground-type attacks. Great Tusk and Corviknight can reduce Hatterene's need to switch in as often by acting as alternative switch-ins. Due to relying on Leftovers and Draining Kiss for recovery, Hatterene can struggle to stay healthy, particularly if it loses its Leftovers to Knock Off or is hit by Salt Cure, so it is recommended to have teammates that can switch into these moves. Corviknight can switch into Knock Off from hazard setters such as Meowscarada and Great Tusk, while Covert Cloak Gholdengo can neutralize Salt Cure. Pokemon holding Rocky Helmet such as Corviknight can be troublesome for Hatterene, as they will wear Hatterene down when it uses Nuzzle or Draining Kiss. Covert Cloak users, especially Gholdengo, are similarly irritating for Hatterene due to nullifying the secondary effect of its Nuzzle or Mystical Fire. Knock Off support from Meowscarada, Great Tusk, and Iron Valiant is thus appreciated to remove these items from the opponent's Pokemon. Hatterene's weakness to Steel- and Ghost-type attacks can be exploited by strong attackers such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Kingambit. Kingambit and Tera Water Garganacl can reliably switch into Gholdengo and Dragapult, while Great Tusk and Dondozo can counter Kingambit.</p>"

Psychic and Dazzling Gleam are STAB moves that let Hatterene remain threatening against hazard setters such as Toxapex, Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Garchomp. Nuzzle punishes setup sweepers such as Dragonite that would otherwise set up in front of Hatterene. Alternatively, Mystical Fire lets Hatterene punish Steel-types such as Kingambit and Gholdengo that try to switch into it. Eject Button lets Hatterene sponge hits for its teammates and brings an offensive Pokemon safely onto the field. The Speed EVs allow Hatterene to outspeed Ting-Lu and paralyzed Adamant Dragonite, while the rest of its EVs are dedicated to its bulk. Tera Steel removes all of Hatterene's weaknesses which can, in turn, allow it to use Healing Wish in front of Pokemon that would otherwise directly threaten it such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Glimmora.</p> <p>Healing Wish Hatterene finds a place on hyper offense, sun, and Psychic Terrain teams, which all enjoy Hatterene's ability to stop entry hazards from going up and breaking Focus Sash and severely chipping Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock while also keeping momentum thanks to Eject Button. As such, Pokemon usually seen on these archetypes like Dragonite, Ceruledge, Iron Moth, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake, as well as Focus Sash users such as Breloom, Armarouge, and Polteageist, enjoy the presence of Hatterene. Offensive pivots such as Roaring Moon and Cinderace invite in defensive walls like Dondozo and Toxapex, against which Hatterene can use Healing Wish safely. Great Tusk can act as a secondary entry hazard control alongside Hatterene, preventing the latter from getting overwhelmed by repeating hits from entry hazards users like Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and opposing Great Tusk. Said support is particularly useful on sun teams as keeping Stealth Rock off the field allows for Torkoal to remain healthy and thus set up sun repeated timed throughout the game.</p>"

Encore can punish foes by locking them into undesirable moves, such as Recover for Garganacl and Skeledirge, as well as preventing dangerous setup sweepers, such as Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant, and Substitute users, such as Hydreigon and Dragapult, from setting up. It can also lock foes into moves that Indeedee-M's teammates resist, allowing them to be used as setup fodder. Healing Wish sacrifices Indeedee-M in exchange for fully healing a teammate, which facilitates wallbreakers such as Armarouge, Volcarona, and Polteageist further weakening the opposing team. Additionally, Healing Wish provides a teammate a free switch-in, maximizing the number of turns in which they can take advantage of Psychic Terrain. Tera Fairy boosts the power of Dazzling Gleam, allowing Indeedee-M to OHKO Roaring Moon, Greninja, Meowscarada, and Dragapult after Stealth Rock damage. Tera Fairy also allows Indeedee-M to use Healing Wish in front of Pokemon where it wouldn't usually be able to do so, such as Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, and Bug Buzz Volcarona, though it is almost always better to Terastallize a teammate instead, as Indeedee-M's immunity to Ghost-type attacks eases the matchup against Pokemon that are otherwise very threatening to Psychic Terrain teams, such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult.</p> <p>Indeedee-M is mandatory on Psychic Terrain teams.

Good partners for Ursaluna that excel against offense include Kingambit, Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Zamazenta, which, in return, appreciate Ursaluna breaking through Pokemon such as Dondozo and Corviknight. Ursaluna enjoys U-turn or Volt Switch support from Rotom-W, Landorus-T, or Dragapult, letting it hit the field multiple times to fire off its insanely powerful attacks. Galarian Slowking is another great teammate for Ursaluna, as it can both provide momentum with Chilly Reception and supplement Ursaluna's firepower with Future Sight. Galarian Slowking can also switch into and pressure some of the Pokemon that give Ursaluna trouble, such as Iron Valiant. Trick Room support from Hatterene and Cresselia is an interesting option to turn Ursaluna's low Speed into an advantage.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Enamorus-T's good natural defenses and access to boosting moves in Calm Mind and Iron Defense allow it to serve as a viable wincon that is difficult to remove once it starts setting up. What Draining Kiss may lack in power, it makes up for with its ability to keep Enamorus-T healthy, which is critical, since this set is focused on longevity over raw damage. Earth Power pairs exceedingly well with it, giving Enamorus-T impressive coverage that is resisted by only a few Pokemon while hitting threats like Gholdengo and Heatran super effectively. Leftovers help keep Enamorus-T healthy while it racks up boosts, but Heavy-Duty Boots keeps it safe from Stealth Rock, which poses to cut away a significant amount of HP once Enamorus-T switches in. Grassy Seed can also be run if Enamorus-T is paired with Rillaboom, as the instant Defense boost can aid it greatly in setting up. Terastallization aids Enamorus-T's ability to set up by mixing up its defensive profile;Tera Steel allows it to deal with Poison- and Steel-types, giving it a chance to take Dire Claw from Sneasler and Iron Head from Kingambit, respectively. It also removes its weakness to Electric, giving it a better matchup against Zapdos. In addition, with Overcoat, Tera Steel makes Enamorus-T a very capable Amoonguss switch-in, letting it use it as setup fodder for a potential sweep. Tera Water maintains the resistance to Steel while also giving it a resistance to Ice, and can turn Enamorus-T into a useful Walking Wake check in a pinch. The EV spread is designed to keep Enamorus-T as bulky as possible while still allowing it to outspeed uninvested Kingambit, Azumarill, and Ursaluna.</p> <p>Enamorus-T fits best on bulky offensive teams that allow it to sweep late-game once its checks have been whittled down or removed. Therefore, offensive wallbreakers like Sneasler and Iron Valiant serve as good teammates for it. The latter in particular is good at wearing down Moltres and Corviknight, two common Pokemon that resist both of Enamorus-T's attacks. Offensive hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott also help by wearing down the opponent's team. If Enamorus-T is not using Heavy-Duty Boots, then hazard removal is a necessity, so Pokemon like Great Tusk and Cinderace are further appreciated.</p>"

Unlike other walls, however, Skeledirge can also be a foreboding wincon with Torch Song and its great offensive typing, which gives it nearly unresisted coverage. Will-O-Wisp gives it value against switch-ins such as Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Clodsire and cripples physical attackers like Great Tusk and Garchomp. Hex benefits from Skeledirge spreading burns, 2HKOing Pokemon such as Dragonite, Iron Hands, and physically defensive Dondozo unboosted, and Toxapex after a single boost from Torch Song. Tera Fairy bolsters Skeledirge against Dragon-types that would otherwise overwhelm it like Dragapult, Dragonite, and Garchomp. It also lets Skeledirge beat Quaquaval and lose its Ground weakness, letting it more easily spread burns against Ground-types like Great Tusk and Garchomp. In a pinch, it can bait Dark-type moves from Pokemon like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Meowscarada, Terastallize the same turn, and punish them with Will-O-Wisp. Tera Fairy also maintains Skeledirge's ability to beat Iron Valiant, Volcarona, and Hatterene.</p> <p>Skeledirge fits on many bulky offense, balance, and stall teams as a much-appreciated answer to common wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant and Hatterene. Skeledirge often ends up entry hazard fodder for Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire. Thus, secure hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight are excellent partners. Additionally, Great Tusk can 2HKO the aforementioned Pokemon, helping set Skeledirge up for a potential sweep, while Corviknight walls the aforementioned Ground-types, can bring Skeledirge in later with U-turn, and can absorb Knock Off from the likes of Great Tusk, Meowscarada, and Iron Treads. Pokemon such as Meowscarada and Iron Valiant can overwhelm Skeledirge answers like Gholdengo, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu. In addition to this, they appreciate Skeledirge's ability to beat Hatterene and, after Terastallizing, Dragapult. Covert Cloak Gholdengo can beat any Garganacl using Skeledirge as setup fodder. Bulky Water-types like Rotom-W and Toxapex help deal with offensive Water-types like Greninja and Quaquaval. Additionally, they can both spread status, facilitating Skeledirge's Hex. Rotom-W in particular can offensively check Ground-types like Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Ting-Lu too, although it cannot directly switch into them. Offensive Pokemon like Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Kingambit, and Dragonite appreciate Skeledirge halting scary Pokemon, like Volcarona and Iron Valiant, and they help it overwhelm checks like Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire.</p>"

      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<p>With Substitute, Skeledirge can use its typing and bulk to consistently check Garganacl and more easily snowball with Torch Song. Substitute also allows Skeledirge to scout Choice item Pokemon like Roaring Moon and Dragonite, as well as protecting it from revenge killers like Kingambit and Roaring Moon more reliably. Substitute also lets Skeledirge set up against the likes of Garganacl and Cinderace, and it blocks from status from the likes of Toxapex, Clodsire, and Thunder Wave Rotom-W. Maximum HP investment means that Garganacl cannot break Substitute with Salt Cure. 40 Defense EVs let Skeledirge survive two Bulldozes from Focus Sash Breloom, meaning it can consistently outheal Bulldoze, barring a critical hit. 188 Special Defense EVs ensures it survives a Shadow Ball from non-Tera Ghost Choice Specs Dragapult, while 28 Speed EVs let it outspeed Kingambit. Tera Fairy helps stop the likes of Dragapult and Great Tusk from overwhelming Skeledirge, especially the former, which bypasses Substitute with Infiltrator but cannot 2HKO Skeledirge after it Terastallizes. Tera Fairy also prevents Garganacl's Earthquake from breaking Substitute.</p> <p>Substitute Skeledirge fits best on bulky offense and balance teams as a good check to Garganacl. Pokemon Garganacl can overwhelm such as Dragonite, Hex Dragapult, Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, Calm Mind Hatterene, Corviknight, Toxapex, and Dondozo can lure it in for Skeledirge to set up Substitute on and snowball. Additionally, the former can break through Pokemon that wall Skeledirge, namely Toxapex and Clodsire, and Dragapult and Corviknight also boast U-turn, letting them pivot into Skeledirge on a Garganacl switch-in. The setup sweepers enjoy Skeledirge's potent wallbreaking, too. Toxapex and Dondozo also check Pokemon that overwhelm Skeledirge, such as Dragapult and Greninja. Pokemon that do not mind Knock Off like Great Tusk and Corviknight greatly help this set, as Skeledirge is both weak to Knock Off and reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots due to its Stealth Rock weakness. These Pokemon also double as entry hazard removers, with the former preventing Gholdengo from entering safely and the latter checking Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard setters such as Garchomp and Meowscarada can chip down Pokemon that wall Skeledirge like Ting-Lu and Clodsire. In return, Skeledirge can threaten common entry hazard answers like Hatterene and Corviknight, as well as spinblocking in a pinch.</p>"

Bulk Up lets it more easily take out threats like Great Tusk, Armarouge, and Ting-Lu and survive attacks from Pokemon such as Tera Flying Roaring Moon and Azumarill. Close Combat hits Pokemon that can take an Aqua Step, like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, and Hydreigon, super effectively. Roost gives Quaquaval longevity to accumulate and take advantage of its boosts, and it allows Quaquaval to switch into Kingambit and Cinderace without fearing chip damage. Taunt shuts down Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Skeledirge by preventing the use of recovery and status-inflicting moves. It also blocks Defense-boosting attempts from Curse and Bulk Up users like Great Tusk and Garganacl. Ice Spinner is a great coverage move that hits Pokemon that would otherwise resist Quaquaval's STAB attacks, like Dragonite, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Amoonguss. 112 Speed EVs allow Quaquaval to outspeed Iron Moth after a boost. Tera Water boosts Aqua Step's power and removes Quaquaval's weakness to threats like Iron Valiant, Azumarill, and Future Sight Slowking. Tera Fighting boosts Close Combat’s power to dent threats like Garchomp and Breloom. It also allows Quaquaval to take less damage from Garganacl’s Salt Cure. Tera Poison is a defensive option that allows Quaquaval to resist Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Azumarill, absorb Toxic Spikes, and be immune to Toxapex and Clodsire's Toxic.</p> <p>Quaquaval fits best on offense teams that support its ability to set up and sweep. Entry hazards from Pokemon like Meowscarada and Glimmora give Quaquaval an easier time taking out foes. Pivots like Rotom-W and Cinderace bring Quaquaval safely onto the field against threats like Volcarona and Great Tusk. Cinderace in particular is able to provide entry hazard control with Court Change and can burn foes with Will-O-Wisp, giving Quaquaval an easier time to set up and sweep. Quaquaval targets common Fire-, Ground-, and Dark-types; therefore, it can support teammates weak to them like Corviknight and Gholdengo. In return, Corviknight can pivot Quaquaval into battle, come in on Assault Vest Toxapex, and remove entry hazards. Gholdengo blocks status that prevent Quaquaval from sweeping should it not run Taunt. Quaquaval struggles against Pokemon like Dragonite, Dragapult, and Azumarill; therefore, threats to them like Scizor and Iron Valiant make good teammates. Scizor checks Azumarill, while Iron Valiant checks Dragonite and Dragapult.</p>"

It can take hits from Dragapult, Zapdos, and Iron Moth as well as sit on passive walls like Toxapex, Clodsire, and non-Grass Knot Amoonguss, giving it plenty of opportunites to enter the field. In addition to letting it contest with Attack-boosting foes like Dragonite, Dragapult, and Roaring Moon, Curse boosts Salt Cure's initial damage to threaten Pokemon like Corviknight, which would otherwise exhaust Salt Cure's PP with Pressure. Curse also works well with Earthquake, breaking past Covert Cloak Gholdengo, non-Haze Toxapex, opposing Garganacl, and Skeledirge's Substitute. Stealth Rock is a viable alternative if the team lacks a Stealth Rock user, since Garganacl tends to force multiple switches with Salt Cure and can outlast and annoy common entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight. Tera Water lets it take on Kingambit, Gholdengo, Azumarill, and rain teams better, while Tera Fairy improves its matchup against Dragapult, Great Tusk, and Meowscarada, the latter of which can bypass Garganacl's boosts with Flower Trick. The EV spread prevents a 2HKO from offensive Great Tusk's Close Combat or Headlong Rush after Curse, even after its Leftovers is removed by Knock Off.</p> <p>Curse Garganacl is a valuable asset for balance teams. Defensive teammates such as Corviknight, Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Clodsire cover threats like Great Tusk, Greninja, Iron Valiant, and Gholdengo, respectively. Skeledirge in return appreciates Garganacl switching into Shadow Ball from Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark, with Tera Water variants dealing with Gholdengo and Water-types as well, while Ting-Lu and Clodsire are secondary checks to Dragapult, Heatran, and Iron Moth, which keeps Garganacl moderately healthy early-game so it can have an easier time sweeping later on. Knock Off users such as Great Tusk and Meowscarada are crucial to remove Covert Cloak and Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Amoonguss, Clodsire, Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Slowking. Great Tusk, Meowscarada, Toxapex, and Clodsire can also set entry hazards of their own, either allowing Garganacl to forgo Stealth Rock or forming an entry hazard stacking core. Offensive teammates like Dragapult and Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Meowscarada are great against offensive teams that contain the likes of Dragonite and Roaring Moon—which can overwhelm Garganacl prior to boosting—and can clean up late-game in case Garganacl is unable to fully sweep. In return, Garganacl matches up well against defensive foes that they struggle with, such as Clodsire and Toxapex, especially with Dragapult bringing it into them safely via U-turn.</p>"

Protect alongside Salt Cure wears down entry hazard removal options such as Great Tusk and especially Corviknight due to its limited Roost PP and typing's vulnerability to Salt Cure. Protect also scouts out the intentions of Choice locked Pokemon such as Gholdengo and gives extra Leftovers recovery. Terastallization, lets Garganacl turn the tables on Great Tusk and Iron Treads lacking Iron Head, and makes it an incredibly consistent Stealth Rock setter. Specifically, Tera Fairy lets it completely wall Dragapult, while Tera Water lets it check Gholdengo, though this makes its matchup against opposing Garganacl much tougher. 116 Special Defense EVs let Garganacl take a Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Tera Dragon Dragapult at full health.</p> <p>Garganacl fits on a wide variety of teams from bulky offense to stall thanks to it setting up Stealth Rock easily and having fantastic longevity. Ting-Lu is a fantastic partner since it can lay Spikes, and check Gholdengo and unboosted Kingambit, and wear down Corviknight much faster with Ruination thanks to Garganacl running Stealth Rock. Meowscarada and Great Tusk provide Knock Off support by removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Covert Cloak from Gholdengo and Toxapex to let Garganacl accrue Salt Cure damage more freely. Great Tusk also removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Gholdengo appreciates Great Tusk being worn down, since it shuts down other forms of entry hazard control well and fits alongside Garganacl and other entry hazard setters such as Garchomp. Cinderace lures in and uses U-turn on bulky Water-types such as Dondozo and Toxapex, giving Garganacl free entry to pressure them with Salt Cure.</p>"

        "description": "<p>The combination of Iron Defense + Body Press lets Garganacl serve as a bulky and dangerous setup sweeper, allowing it to beat Pokemon it otherwise loses to, such as Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Kingambit. Salt Cure wears down common switch-ins such as Great Tusk, Gholdengo, Rotom-W, and Hatterene, as well as passive Pokemon like Toxapex and Corviknight, and forces them to burn recovery PP more often. Recover keeps Garganacl healthy throughout a game to check Pokemon like Ceruledge and Iron Moth and makes it more sustainable as a wincon. Purifying Salt prevents it from being crippled by Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Clodsire. It also provides a handy Ghost resistance, letting Garganacl potentially switch in on predicted Ghost-type moves from Pokemon like Dragapult and Skeledirge. Leftovers provides valuable passive recovery, reducing Garganacl's reliance on Recover. Maximum Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature maximize Garganacl's bulk, making it easier for Garganacl to switch in on Pokemon such as Dragapult, Zapdos, and Heatran and use them as setup fodder. Tera Water provides incredibly valuable resistances, letting Garganacl potentially check Gholdengo and Scizor while retaining its ability to pivot in on Fire-types like Cinderace. Tera Fairy allows Garganacl to turn the tables on Great Tusk while also preventing Breloom from revenge killing it. However, this does remove its resistance to Fire, making it more susceptible to Pokemon like Skeledirge and Ceruledge. Tera Ghost prevents Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Great Tusk from reliably revenge killing Garganacl, letting it use them as setup fodder. It does negate the Ghost resistance provided by Purifying Salt, however, so another switch-in to Dragapult's Shadow Ball should be used.</p> <p>Checks to strong wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Breloom are good teammates; examples include the likes of Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Corviknight. While Garganacl is given a Ghost resistance from Purifying Salt, it cannot fully check Dragapult and Gholdengo prior to Terastallization, with the latter completely countering it if it uses Covert Cloak. As such, Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Clodsire make for great teammates. Pokemon like Corviknight and Scizor appreciate Garganacl checking Fire-types like Ceruledge and Skeledirge. Corviknight is notable in that it also forms a strong defensive core with Garganacl, checking Meowscarada for it. Entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and the aforementioned Corviknight are appreciated, as Garganacl is heavily pressured by entry hazards and cannot set up reliably if it is worn down. Frail, offensive Pokemon like Cinderace appreciate chip damage being forced onto their checks and having a strong defensive Pokemon to fall back on. Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Iron Valiant can pave the way for Garganacl to clean late-game, wearing down or significantly pressuring its checks in Gholdengo, Meowscarada, and Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Great Tusk.</p>"

      "Psychic Terrain Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Armarouge carves a niche for itself with its powerful STAB moves and passable Speed alongside its unique setup and offensive utility. Endure allows Armarouge to survive any direct attack, and when combined with Weak Armor's speed boost, it can allow Armarouge to turn the tables on faster physical threats like Great Tusk, Dragapult, Baxcalibur, and Garchomp. Expanding Force is Armarouge's most powerful attack in Psychic Terrain and 2HKOed all neutral targets besides the uncommon Blissey. Moreover, with Spikes support or Tera Psychic, it can reliably OHKO the likes of Clodsire and Baxcalibur. Armor Cannon is Armarouge's strongest move outside of Psychic Terrain and complements Expanding Force well, OHKOing Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Corviknight and 2HKOing Hatterene. Calm Mind capitalizes on the switches it forces, allowing it to always OHKO Rotom-W and Volcarona with Expanding Force while often OHKOing Garganacl. Destiny Bond can instead force a trade against threats it cannot OHKO normally, such as Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and bulky threats like Ting-Lu and Dondozo. If Psychic Terrain is not active, Destiny Bond forces Sucker Punch users like Kingambit into a difficult situation, where they must either KO Armarouge next turn and faint or switch out and let Armarouge land a powerful attack for free. Tera Psychic powers up Expanding Force to ludicrous levels, allowing it to 2HKO specially defensive Skeledirge and OHKO Dondozo, physically defensive Garganacl, Clodsire, Garchomp, Volcarona, and Baxcalibur while OHKOing Assault Vest Toxapex after a Calm Mind boost. Focus Sash gives Armarouge space to survive at least one hit from full HP, allowing it to set up a Calm Mind or hit attackers back, and it can punish a contact move without committing to Endure. A Modest nature gives Armarouge the best odds of OHKOing Clodsire, Rotom-W, Walking Wake, and Baxcalibur after chip damage from entry hazards, but a Timid nature helps Armarouge sweep late-game by outpacing Speed-boosting Walking Wake with Protosynthesis active, outpacing +1 Iron Moth, and tying with +1 Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Armarouge is a staple on \"Psychic spam\" teams, which use Psychic Terrain and a litany of powerful setup sweepers to overwhelm opponents at a breakneck pace. Psychic Terrain blocks priority moves, including Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed, rendering Armarouge very difficult to revenge kill after a Weak Armor boost. Indeedee is a mandatory teammate to set Psychic Terrain, and it can wear down Dark-types with Dazzling Gleam. Furthermore, its Healing Wish can give a weakened Armarouge or one of its teammates a second chance to sweep. Polteageist is another common Psychic spam threat that can threaten the Dark-types Armarouge struggles against with a Fighting-type Tera Blast; in return, Armarouge can handle Steel-types, which Polteageist would otherwise be forced to Terastallize against. One of Armarouge or Polteageist can also wear down Ting-Lu, allowing the other to break past it and sweep late-game. Entry hazard control is extremely important, especially hazard removal, since Armarouge greatly prefers having Focus Sash active to sweep. Eject Pack Great Tusk provides excellent role compression for these teams, since it provides both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, and it can get Armarouge in safely by activating Eject Pack with Close Combat or Headlong Rush; notably, Armarouge can use Stealth Rock to more easily OHKO Rotom-W, Assault Vest Toxapex, and Clodsire without using up its team's Terastallization. Hatterene can deter opposing entry hazards with Magic Bounce while spreading paralysis with Nuzzle and weakening Dark-types with Dazzling Gleam; it can also use Eject Button to reliably pivot in Armarouge if Psychic Terrain is up. Magic Bounce also deters Taunt users, which can otherwise prevent Armarouge from setting up with Calm Mind and Endure, and Hatterene can also offer Healing Wish support. Lastly, many other setup sweepers can fit well on Psychic Terrain teams to open up a sweep for Armarouge, or to sweep once Armarouge punches holes for them. Volcarona and Dragon Dance Baxcalibur can weaken or eliminate Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon, which Armarouge struggles greatly against, while Armarouge can break past Clodsire and Unaware walls for Volcarona to sweep, and it can deal with Steel-types to assist Baxcalibur.</p>"

Taunt can be run over Shadow Sneak to stop entry hazard setters and sweepers from setting up, giving Ceruledge a chance to break foes with recovery such as Clodsire without the opponent gaining too much progress. Taunt also prevents Ceruledge by being statused by the likes of Clodsire and Rotom-W. Close Combat OHKOs specially defensive Garganacl after a Swords Dance boost while 2HKOing Ting-Lu, physically defensive Garganacl, and Rotom-W, all of which are not threatened by Bitter Blade. Solar Blade threatens Dondozo, Garganacl, Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Great Tusk while sun is active. Focus Sash can ensure that Weak Armor and Swords Dance are activated, allowing Ceruledge to sweep more reliably. Life Orb is an alternative option that makes it possible to OHKO Ting-Lu and 2HKO Great Tusk at +2. Weak Armor couples incredibly well with Focus Sash, and its resistances to types like Bug and Fire, allowing Ceruledge to gain a free Speed boost by switching into U-turn from pivots like Corviknight and Cinderace, as well as Pyro Ball from the latter. Flash Fire lets Ceruledge function as a more reliable switch-in to Fire-types like Iron Moth, while potentially powering up Bitter Blade. Tera Fire provides extra power to Bitter Blade in order to OHKO Amoonguss and 2HKO Tera Steel Toxapex before Swords Dance. Tera Fighting provides Ceruledge with a Dark-resistance, allowing it to take attacks from the likes of Kingambit and Roaring Moon, particularly Sucker Punch from the former, in order to gain a Speed boost from Weak Armor. However, beware of other neutral attacks from such threats, as Choice Band Roaring Moon will still be able to OHKO Ceruledge with Dragon Claw. After a Swords Dance, Tera Fighting gives Close Combat enough extra power to OHKO all Garganacl sets, Ting-Lu, and Rotom-W after Stealth Rock chip. Tera Grass can be used together with Solar Blade in order to 2HKO Dondozo under sun. If running a Jolly nature, Ceruledge can outspeed Gholdengo, as well as Booster Energy Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf Meowscarada, and +1 Roaring Moon and Adamant Dragapult after a Weak Armor boost. Jolly, however, notably misses out on Adamant’s chance to OHKO Great Tusk and Ting-Lu at +2 with Tera Fighting Close Combat, as well as ensuring a 2HKO against Clodsire with Bitter Blade after Stealth Rock chip.</p> <p>Ceruledge fits best on offensive teams, mainly those that use sun, in addition to some bulky offense teams that can provide it opportunities to enter battle and set up safely. As one of few viable physical Fire-types, Ceruledge has great synergy with Torkoal, which can activate sun to boost Bitter Blade’s power and allow Solar Blade to be used in one turn. Torkoal also sets Stealth Rock, removes hazards with Rapid Spin, and can spread status with Lava Plume and Yawn to allow Ceruledge safe entry. Walking Wake benefits from Ceruledge’s unique coverage on sun teams, as it appreciates foes like Azumarill and Slowking being removed. In return, Walking Wake can pressure foes like Skeledirge and Great Tusk. Great Tusk and Hatterene are also good partners on sun teams, as they can keep entry hazards off the field so that Ceruledge can enter battle safely with its Focus Sash intact. Ceruledge struggles with physical walls like Rotom-W and Great Tusk, as well as Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Dondozo. Choice Specs Iron Valiant has coverage for these foes, while Booster Energy variants threaten faster attackers like Roaring Moon and Dragapult. Mixed Garchomp puts pressure on most of Ceruledge’s checks, like Dondozo and Skeledirge, while luring in Corviknight so that Ceruledge can take advantage of its U-turn in order to activate Weak Armor. Corviknight itself is a good partner, as it is able to lure in Cinderace, another Pokemon Ceruledge can take advantage of, and pivot Ceruledge into battle safely. But, it can be a drain on momentum for more offensive teams. Ceruledge works well with hazard setters, as extra chip damage helps Ceruledge break foes like Garganacl and Rotom-W. In return, Ceruledge pressures Corviknight and can spinblock with its Ghost typing, but it doesn’t often do so due to bad matchups against common Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk. Examples of hazard-setting teammates include Great Tusk and Meowscarada, with the former being able to check Dark-types like Kingambit in the event Ceruledge cannot Terastallize, and the latter checking Rotom-W and Great Tusk.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Toedscruel's main appeal over other Spikers is its ability Mycelium Might, which allows it to use Spore against Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Hatterene, as well as preventing Magic Bounce from blocking its Spikes. Leaf Storm OHKOes foes like Great Tusk, Greninja, and Rotom-W while hitting Ting-Lu for a good amount as well. Rapid Spin is useful because Toedscruel is faster than every Stealth Rock setter in the tier besides Garchomp and Iron Treads, letting it switch in late-game to clear entry hazards if needed. Earth Power is an alternative over both moves, as it hits Clodsire, Torkoal, Kingambit, Iron Moth, and Glimmora while also chipping Dragapult. The combination of Earth Power and Rapid Spin allows Toedscruel to be a great lead into Glimmora, as it can use Earth Power to take Glimmora down to its Focus Sash, then Rapid Spin to remove the entry hazards that were set. Both of its STAB moves hit Garganacl quite hard, another common Stealth Rock setter, which hyper offense teams appreciate being scared out. Another great application of this combination is against spin blockers such as Ceruledge, Skeledirge and Gholdengo, which are all threatened to Tera or switch out by Earth Power, letting Toedscruel Rapid Spin. Tera Ghost allows Toedscruel to block Rapid Spin against Iron Treads and Great Tusk in a pinch.</p> <p>Lead Toedscruel is only seen on hyper offense teams, as it guarantees a critical layer of Spikes or a slept foe, regardless of abilities such as Good as Gold, Purifying Salt, and Magic Bounce, assisting in the late-game; the former is helpful for damage rolls and breaking Focus Sash, while the latter gives setup sweepers free turns. With that in mind, great partners include setup sweepers like Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit, the latter of which also appreciates Toedscruel fainting early-game, giving it a Supreme Overlord boost. Some threats to this set include Meowscarada, which is incredibly annoying because Taunt shuts down Toedscruel's entry hazards and Spore, and it cannot punish this, as it resists both Leaf Storm and Earth Power. Kingambit is a great choice for dealing with Meowscarada, as it resists Leaf Storm and Knock off and can threaten it with a powerful Low Kick or Iron Head without fear of Taunt. Hydreigon is also quite troublesome; its resistance to Leaf Storm and immunity to Earth Power allows it to set up a Substitute without fear of being put to sleep due to Mycelium Might causing Spore to move second. Dragapult serves as a great teammate, as it can threaten Hydreigon behind Substitute. Choice Band Dragapult is bothersome, as it OHKOes Toedscruel with Dragon Darts, but it is easily taken advantage of by Fairy-types like Azumarill and Iron Valiant if it OHKOes Toedscruel. Gholdengo is also a fantastic teammate, as it blocks attempts to clear Toedscruels's entry hazards and takes advantage of Spore by setting up with Nasty Plot.</p>"

Its fantastic defensive typing allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes and nets it nice resistances to Fighting and Fairy, letting it check a unique combination of threatening offensive Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W. To aid in checking them, it runs Toxic to put these Pokemon on a timer, stalling with Recover as poison damage increases. When they're inevitably forced to switch, their replacement takes damage too since Clodsire sets Stealth Rock or Spikes, racking up even more damage. Leftovers can be used to help preserve Recover’s PP and stay in longer, while Heavy-Duty Boots helps Clodsire switch in and out to wall threats. Earthquake, besides providing direct damage, super effectively damages Pokemon that can't be poisoned like Gholdengo and other Clodsire. Terastallization gives Clodsire much more defensive flexibility as well; Tera Water can help it resist powerful STAB moves from Dondozo and Azumarill which would otherwise scare it out. Tera Flying is another useful option, turning its Ground weakness into an immunity while preserving its Fighting resistance, allowing it to stay in against Great Tusk and Focus Sash Breloom.</p> <p>Clodsire fits neatly into plenty of balance or stall teams looking for a way to handle special hits, offering support with both setting up hazards and removing Toxic Spikes, and walling sweepers with Unaware. Other hazard setters in particular love stacking hazards alongside it; since it learns both Stealth Rock and Spikes, it can fit with many options, like Spikes Meowscarada or Stealth Rock Garganacl. However, its mediocre Defense and weaknesses to Ground and Ice leave it particularly vulnerable to the the tier's physical wallbreakers, most notably Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Garchomp. As such, Clodsire greatly appreciates having teammates who can check these Pokemon and easily switch into Earthquake or Icicle Crash like Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Tera Water Garganacl. In particular, Clodsire is completely stonewalled by Hatterene and Air Balloon or Tera Flying Gholdengo. The former reflects both Toxic and entry hazards while overpowering its healing with Psyshock, and the latter is immune to Toxic via Good as Gold, even if it loses its Steel typing. Great teammates to help check these two are Gholdengo itself for Hatterene, which threatens Hatterene with Make It Rain and its unpredictable set versatility, and Kingambit for opposing Gholdengo, which resists both of Gholdengo's STAB moves and can immediately threaten to OHKO it back. In turn, these two appreciate Clodsire checking the Fire-types that scare them out, especially Iron Moth and Skeledirge. Bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo can check the Water-type threats Clodsire fears, like Floatzel and Azumarill.</p>"

Its defensive typing and high Speed make it a good answer to Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Walking Wake. Dazzling Gleam is this set's only attacking move, letting it hit Pokemon like Great Tusk, Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Iron Valiant and prevents it from being shut down by Taunt from Pokemon like Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and Greninja. Wish gives Scream Tail a recovery move while letting it heal teammates such as Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Hatterene that lack reliable recovery and are vulnerable to being overwhelmed by repeated hits. Protect synergizes well with Wish, making it much more reliable as a recovery move. Additionally, Protect scouts the intentions of Choice-locked Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Hisuian Zoroark. Encore prevents setup sweepers like Volcarona, Calm Mind Iron Valiant, and Bulk Up Great Tusk from using Scream Tail as a setup opportunity, letting Scream Tail's teammates switch in and take advantage of these threats. It can also be used to annoy passive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Dondozo. Tera Fairy gives Scream Tail better matchups against Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Hisuian Zoroark, with the former two being susceptible to being OHKOed by Dazzling Gleam. Alternatively, Tera Water lets Scream Tail maintain a solid defensive typing while also helping it check Walking Wake, Skeledirge, and Greninja. With a Timid nature, 152 Speed EVs let Scream Tail outspeed Hydreigon, while 236 Special Defense EVs ensure that Scream Tail gets a Special Defense boost with Protosynthesis under sun, letting it more easily take on threats such as Walking Wake and Iron Valiant. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 84 SpD / 172 Spe with a Calm nature lets Scream Tail outspeed unboosted Great Tusk and pass beefier Wishes.</p> <p>Scream Tail fits on many sun, balance, and stall teams thanks to its bulk, ability to pass Wish to teammates, and create momentum with Encore. Bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo make for good teammates, as they are able to check Greninja and Ceruledge, respectively. Moreover, Toxapex also checks Pokemon like Iron Moth and Glimmora as well as spread status, making Encore much more of a detriment to setup sweepers like Volcarona and Iron Valiant, while Dondozo blanket checks physically oriented Pokemon that can overwhelm Scream Tail, namely Booster Energy Roaring Moon and Ceruledge. Entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for excellent teammates, as a lack of hazards means that Scream Tail can accomplish feats such as surviving two Choice Specs Greninja Hydro Pumps from full HP. Additionally, Great Tusk appreciates Wish support in order to more consistently check Scream Tail answers such as Kingambit. Torkoal is a great teammate thanks to its sun activating Scream Tail's Protosynthesis. In addition, Torkoal very much appreciates Wish support in order to more consistently check Pokemon like Kingambit. Meanwhile, Scream Tail is able to sponge special attacks from the likes of Walking Wake. Under sun, Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Ceruledge, and Brute Bonnet appreciate Scream Tail facilitating their sweeps with its combination of Encore and Wish, keeping them healthy while leveraging setup opportunities for them. Hydreigon is another excellent offensive partner, checking Gholdengo and finding more opportunities to set up Substitute thanks to Scream Tail's Wish.</p>"

Brute Bonnet stands out due to its access to Spore, allowing it to lure in and immobilize incoming foes like Dragonite and Roaring Moon. Sucker Punch allows Brute Bonnet to revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Dragapult and Gholdengo. Tera Fire Tera Blast gives it coverage against Pokemon like Corviknight, Kingambit, and Amoonguss and is further boosted by sun. Loaded Dice is the preferred item for Brute Bonnet, since it can maximize Bullet Seed's damage output. Tera Fire is Brute Bonnet's best Tera type to both take advantage of a sun boosted Tera Blast and change most of its type weaknesses to resistances, improving its matchups against Iron Valiant and Volcarona.</p> <p>In order to fully reap Brute Bonnet's benefits, it must be used on a sun team. Hence, Torkoal is a mandatory partner to activate Brute Bonnet's Protosynthesis; it can additionally lay down Stealth Rock and act as a secondary hazard remover. Brute Bonnet also appreciates entry hazard support from Garchomp, which can wear down incoming foes for Brute Bonnet. When it Terastallizes, Brute Bonnet becomes highly susceptible to entry hazards. Hence, hazard control from the likes of Hatterene and Great Tusk is greatly appreciated. Lastly, Brute Bonnet struggles against walls such as Tera Fairy Garganacl and Skeledirge as well as faster Pokemon like Garchomp and Volcarona; Roaring Moon and Walking Wake are good teammates to handle said checks.

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Sandy Shocks can work as an excellent pivot on offensive teams, leveraging its high Speed and Special Attack to confound switch-ins with Volt Switch, which significantly chips even most Electric-resistant foes like Dragapult and Breloom and allows for a powerful teammate like Meowscarada to be brought in safely. Tera Fairy Tera Blast also provides Sandy Shocks with incredible coverage alongside its STAB moves, threatening Pokemon such as defensive Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Dragapult that are otherwise mostly satisfactory switch-ins and that threaten Sandy Shocks out in turn. In particular, Great Tusk goes from an adequate check to being cleanly OHKOed by Tera Blast assuming it is safe to stay in. Tera Fairy also lets Sandy Shocks resist Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Stealth Rock and Spikes both provide invaluable entry hazard support for Sandy Shocks and its teammates to wear down counters, while Thunderbolt is a solid option to maintain an Electric-type STAB move without being forced to switch out, especially when it can immediately threaten a KO late-game on chipped targets like Slowking and Rotom-W. With 252 Speed EVs, even a Modest Sandy Shocks still crucially outpaces all variants of Great Tusk, Gholdengo, and Rotom-W; a Timid nature can be run instead to also outpace Hydreigon at the cost of some power. When it comes to the item slot, Heavy-Duty Boots is perhaps the most straightforward item for Sandy Shocks, as being a pivot, Sandy Shocks gaining an immunity to hazards, which allows it to come in and wreak havoc many more times per game. However, Expert Belt provides a much-appreciated power boost, especially when going Modest for extra damage, since Sandy Shocks's Electric + Ground + Fairy coverage hits nearly the entire metagame super effectively. In particular, it guarantees that Earth Power will always 2HKO Clodsire and guarantees the OHKO on bulky Kingambit.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks shines on momentum-based bulky offense teams, so other Pokemon that can maintain momentum such as Choice item Dragapult, Meowscarada, Slowking, Rotom-W, and Scizor, as well as Eject Button users like offensive Great Tusk are good teammates. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Meowscarada, Garchomp, and Great Tusk is also excellent, since the hazard chip will stack with the numerous switches forced by Sandy Shocks. Additional Stealth Rock users in particular are appreciated because they free Sandy Shocks's fourth moveslot up to run Spikes or Thunderbolt more freely. Meowscarada is an excellent choice with several of its sets, as its Knock Off removes the Heavy-Duty Boots that Sandy Shocks's switch-ins rely on to not get worn down by hazards, it can set hazards itself, its U-turn forms the potent VoltTurn combination with Sandy Shocks, and its Flower Trick is extremely threatening to the Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu that can tank Sandy Shocks's Volt Switch assault. If not running Heavy-Duty Boots, Sandy Shocks can be worn down itself by Spikes, minimizing its effectiveness, and so hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight form prurient teammates. Sandy Shocks's relative frailty and weakness-laden typing means that faster Pokemon like Meowscarada, Garchomp, Dragapult, Cinderace, and Walking Wake, as well as Choice Scarf users such as specific variants of Rotom-W and Gholdengo, can immediately force Sandy Shocks out, lest its meager bulk causes it to be unceremoniously OHKOed. Strong priority moves like Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Azumarill's Aqua Jet present similar issues. As such, additional, more defensive pivots such as the aforementioned Corviknight and Rotom-W serve double duty, as they can act as a buffer against these threats without completely ceding momentum.</p>"

      "Booster Energy": {
        "description": "<p>Sandy Shocks's appeal comes from its high Special Attack and ability to come in at +1 Speed with Booster Energy to pressure common spinners, letting it be one of the best offensive entry hazard setters in the tier. With the lack of reliable Ground-resistant Pokemon, Earth Power becomes incredibly spammable, targeting opposing hazard setters like Glimmora, Garganacl, Iron Treads, Torkoal, and Iron Moth. Earth Power also deals massive damage to Great Tusk, limiting its spinning capabilities. Thunderbolt is an excellent second STAB move, as it targets Flying-types such as Corviknight, Pelipper, and Iron Jugulis, as well as heavily punishing Rotom-W. Thunderbolt also hits threatening Water-types, 2HKOing Azumarill, Dondozo, and Slowking while also OHKOing Greninja. Both of these STAB moves 2HKO Toxapex as well. Stealth Rock or Spikes are very useful on Sandy Shocks because it threatens out almost every entry hazard remover, namely Great Tusk, Torkoal, Corviknight, Cinderace, Glimmora, and Talonflame. Tera Fairy Tera Blast is the perfect coverage tool for Sandy Shocks because it targets threats that would normally wall it, such as Hydreigon and Meowscarada, and it can land surprise KOs on would-be switch-ins like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Roaring Moon while also 2HKOing Garchomp. The Fairy typing has great defensive utility as well, resisting priority moves such as Sucker Punch from Kingambit and Meowscarada and Mach Punch from Breloom.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks fits best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Its ability to immediately get up entry hazards and threaten other hazard setters is instrumental for the success of hyper offense, and not activating Glimmora's Toxic Debris in the hyper offense mirror match is very useful. On bulky offense teams, it can offer more flexibility, setting up hazards and pressuring opposing defensive cores. With its great Speed stat after a Protosynthesis boost, Sandy Shocks threatens offensive Pokemon that would otherwise outspeed it like Dragapult. It also forces damage on bulkier Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Rotom-W, so teammates such as Iron Moth and Dragonite that appreciate these being weakened work best. Ground-immune teammates like Dragonite and Rotom-W also help Sandy Shocks on bulky offense teams, switching into foes like Great Tusk. Opposing Meowscarada is problematic for this set, as it essentially forces it to Terastallize, so teammates that can handle it like Kingambit and Iron Valiant are also very useful. Amoonguss can generally take advantage of Sandy Shocks too, threatening Spore on teammates, so Gholdengo is another great teammate; it also blocks Rapid Spin and Defog.</p>"

With Stealth Rock, Iron Treads can wear down Pokemon that dislike entry hazards like Dragapult, Roaring Moon, and Booster Energy Iron Moth, limiting their opportunities to switch in. Rapid Spin allows Iron Treads to remove hazards from its side while also boosting its Speed, allowing it to threaten Pokemon that would normally outspeed it like Cinderace. Volt Switch not only allows Iron Treads to perform as a pivot but also deals super effective damage to Flying-types like Corviknight and Tera Flying Kingambit. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used to remove important items such as Leftovers from defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Corviknight, and Garganacl as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon vulnerable to hazards such as Dragonite and Skeledirge. Knock Off also allows Iron Treads to deal super effective damage to Air Balloon Gholdengo. Tera Flying completely removes Iron Treads's weakness to Ground-types and turns it into an immunity, allowing it to switch into Great Tusk. Leftovers grants Iron Treads a form of longevity so it can find more opportunities to pivot into teammates. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used as well to help Iron Treads pivot more consistently into teammates while not getting worn down from hazards.</p> <p>Iron Treads fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its offensive utility in order for their team members to function in their roles more effectively.

Garchomp, Meowscarada, and Greninja make for great partners, since the three of them can stack Spikes with Iron Treads to wear down incoming foes into KO range from one of the team's offensive Pokemon. If Iron Treads is running Volt Switch, it could have a hard time pivoting into its teammates, since Ground-types like Great Tusk and Garchomp can switch into it if its predicted. Hence, teammates that can handle Ground-types like Rotom-W pair well with Iron Treads. Lastly, sweepers such as Walking Wake, Dragonite, and Azumarill appreciate Iron Treads bringing them to sweep.

Tera Dark boosts the power of Dark Pulse, making it easier to pressure walls such as Garganacl, Rotom-W, and Toxapex with its flinch chance. Tera Flying strengthens Hurricane, OHKOing Greninja, Amoonguss, and Cinderace most of the time and 2HKOing Toxapex, Dondozo, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge. Tera Fire strengthens Flamethrower or Fire Blast and gives Iron Jugulis crucial resistances to Iron Valiant's Moonblast.</p> <p>Iron Jugulis is best used on hyper offense teams that appreciate its ability to trouble stall teams and keep fast sweepers in check. Due to its only decent power, Iron Jugulis greatly appreciates entry hazards from teammates such as Glimmora, Greninja, Meowscarada, and Garchomp to wear down its checks. Additionally, Iron Jugulis's Stealth Rock weakness makes entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads very valuable partners; they can also pressure Clodsire and Iron Moth to free up Iron Jugulis to run a Fire-type move. Powerful wallbreakers such as Breloom and Dragapult can soften up the opposing team for Iron Jugulis to clean up late-game. Conversely, Iron Jugulis's ability to break through special walls with Taunt opens up other special sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Iron Moth. Gholdengo can also cripple walls with Choice item + Trick and handle Booster Energy Iron Valiant, one of the only threats capable of outspeeding and threatening Iron Jugulis. Iron Jugulis is also effective on rain teams, providing it with a perfectly-accurate Hurricane and featuring extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Floatzel and Walking Wake that can punch holes for it to sweep late-game. In return, Iron Jugulis threatens Amoonguss and provides a valuable Ghost resistance to take on threats such as Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark more easily.</p>"
