        "description": "<p>Physically defensive Corviknight is a fantastic check to dangerous attackers like Garchomp, Roaring Moon, and Dragonite; n effective slow pivot; and one of the few viable entry hazard removers. The choice between Brave Bird and Body Press comes down to team need; Brave Bird nails Great Tusk and has no immunities, while Body Press is Corviknight's best option against Kingambit and Chien-Pao. Leftovers is the preferred item to provide extra longevity, but Rocky Helmet can further punish physical attackers, especially on weak hits like Scizor's and Meowscarada's U-turn. Tera Water serves as an emergency check to dangerous Fire-types like Cinderace, while Tera Ground surprises Iron Hands and Iron Moth.</p> <p>Corviknight is a fantastic slow pivot, making it a great partner for frail-but-powerful teammates like Chien-Pao and Iron Valiant. It is also one of the few viable Defoggers, allowing it to partner up with teammates like Dragonite, Chien-Pao, and Volcarona that loathe Stealth Rock. Be warned, Corviknight is utterly unable to Defog against Gholdengo, so secondary entry hazard removal like Great Tusk and a reliable switch-in like Ting-Lu are recommended. Corviknight is unable to handle powerful physical Fire-types like Cinderace and Ceruledge and Electric-types like Iron Hands; teammates that can cover these weaknesses like Dondozo and Great Tusk are wonderful partners. Its middling special bulk makes teammates like Slowking and Ting-Lu valuable; Slowking has the added benefit of being another slow pivot as well, while Ting-Lu forms a strong entry hazard core with Corviknight and threatens Gholdengo.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Great Tusk has a solid niche as a defensive Pokemon by virtue of its utility, movepool, bulk, and typing. It can adequately check Pokemon like Kingambit, Cinderace, and Iron Hands, threatening them with a strong Earthquake in return. Stealth Rock lets Great Tusk compress even more roles, chipping away at the opposition. If another Stealth Rock user is already on the team, however, Body Press can take advantage of its high Defense stat and better threaten the likes of Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon. Body Press also lets Great Tusk catch Rotom-W with greater chip damage than Knock Off does on the switch. Knock Off provides valuable item removal, getting rid of Leftovers from Pokemon like Dondozo, Corviknight, and Hatterene, as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Volcarona and Dragonite. Additionally, Knock Off is Great Tusk's only initial way to hit Air Balloon Gholdengo, which can't OHKO this defensive set. Rapid Spin, besides clearing entry hazards, also allows Great Tusk to outspeed faster foes like Focus Sash Glimmora and Gholdengo. Tera Fighting gets rid of Great Tusk's Ground typing, giving it a better matchup against Pokemon like Chien-Pao while also strengthening Body Press if it is used. Alternatively, Tera Steel can give Great Tusk valuable resistances to Fairy, Grass, and Ice, turning the tables on Hatterene and Chien-Pao. Leftovers greatly increases Great Tusk's longevity; however, Rocky Helmet can be used to wear down Pokemon like Scizor and Cinderace over time.</p> <p>After Great Tusk sets Stealth Rock, Corviknight effortlessly switches in and uses Defog after Great Tusk sets Stealth Rock, so Pokemon like Cinderace, Gholdengo, and Rotom-W that handle it are great partners. With no good way to hit Flying-types and Pokemon that use Tera Flying, Great Tusk can be set up on very quickly, most notably against the likes of Dragonite and Roaring Moon;even though the former dislikes Knock Off. Therefore, checks to these such as Dondozo and Corviknight are appreciated. A different Stealth Rock setter like Garganacl or Ting-Lu lets Great Tusk comfortably run Body Press without losing out on anything major. Ting-Lu also forms a potent entry hazard-stacking core with Great Tusk via Spikes. Furhter, it takes on the special attackers that Great Tusk struggles with, like Gholdengo, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Volcarona. Great Tusk is forced out by wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Quaquaval, so teammates that can check them like Amoonguss and Toxapex are welcome. Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Ceruledge, and Iron Moth appreciate the entry hazard removal that Great Tusk provides. Great Tusk's defensive qualities greatly help frail wallbreakers like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Chien-Pao, as these Pokemon need strong defensive Pokemon to fall back on very often.</p> "
