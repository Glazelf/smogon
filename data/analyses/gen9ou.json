Moltres gets many free turns over the course of a game thanks to the many Pokemon it forces out, which makes U-turn a fantastic tool for pivoting and gaining momentum while also ensuring that Moltres is not passive against Pokemon such as Heatran and Ting-Lu. Hurricane is an alternative that can OHKO Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Sneasler and 2HKO Zamazenta. 12 Speed EVs allows Moltres to outspeed Jolly Kingambit. Tera Fairy removes all of Moltres' previous weaknesses and strengthen its matchup against Kingambit and Roaring Moon. Alternatively, Tera Water is a solid defensive type that also improves Moltres's rain matchup allowing it to live rain-boosted Tera Water Wave Crash from Floatzel and Basculegion and be able to threaten them back with Will-O-Wisp. 248 Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature can be used instead of the Defense investment and Bold nature to more comfortably take on Enamorus and most special Iron Valiant sets. Great Tusk can form a good core with Moltres thanks to Great Tusk's ability to threaten Moltres's switch-ins, such as Garganacl, Ting-Lu, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran, and remove Stealth Rock if Moltres loses its Heavy-Duty Boots. Ting-Lu can take advantage of Moltres's switch-ins such as Zapdos, Dragapult, and Iron Moth to lay entry hazards while Moltres covers it against Fighting- and Fairy-types such as Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Sneasler. Similarly, Gholdengo handles offensive threats that may overwhelm Moltres, such as pivot Sneasler and Iron Valiant, while Moltres covers it against Cinderace and Kingambit. Setup sweepers such as Kingambit and Iron Valiant can make great use of Moltres's ability to generate free turns by pivoting them into play and spreading burn for easier setup.</p>"

After one Nasty Plot boost, it can 2HKO the likes of Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and Curse Garganacl, and after one Agility boost, it can outspeed would-be faster Pokemon such as +1 Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and +1 Walking Wake. Tera Blast Fairy lets it OHKO Hoopa-U while also being able to net 2HKOs on Kingambit, Assault Vest Hoopa-U, and Dragonite, all after one Nasty Plot boost. Tera Fairy also maintains its Dark resistance while letting it potentially set up in the face of Dragon-type attacks from foes like Dragapult. Alternatively, Hurricane is a strong neutral STAB move that prevents Galarian Moltres form relying too much on Terastallization to function. Tera Dark boosts Fiery Wrath's power, being able to OHKO Assault Vest Galarian Slowking after a Nasty Plot boost and Stealth Rock damage, as well as being able to 2HKO specially defensive Moltres and Assault Vest Toxapex after a Nasty Plot boost. Tera Flying is only to be used if running Hurricane, which can OHKO Zamazenta without a Nasty Plot boost, as well as non-Assault Vest Azumarill and Enamorus after a Nasty Plot boost. Sitrus Berry lets it set up much more easily, and can potentially let it trigger Berserk twice. Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to ignore Stealth Rock. Finally, Weakness Policy is a viable alternative if running dual screens support to take on super effective hits more comfortably. Because of its reliance on setup, Galarian Moltres is best utilized on hyper offense teams. Hence, it appreciates entry hazard support from suicide leads such as Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Meowscarada so that incoming foes can be worn down for Galarian Moltres to clean. Dual screens from Dragapult lets it setup much more easily, esepcially for Weakness Policy variants. Hazard control is a must when running Galarian Moltres due to its vulnerability to Stealth Rock, so it appreciates partners such as Great Tusk and Hatterene with their access to Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce. The two of them can also threaten special walls that can hinder a Galarian Moltres sweep, with Great Tusk being able to OHKO Galarian Slowking and 2HKO Ting-Lu, while Hatterene can 2HKO Clodsire. In return, Galarian Moltres can set up on and threaten Zamazenta for Great Tusk and Gholdengo for Hatterene. Bulky Unaware users such as Dondozo as well as special walls like Garganacl prevent Galarian Moltres from performing its sweep. Hence, offensive Zapdos pairs well with Galarian Moltres, being able to 2HKO both of the aforementioned Pokemon, provided Garganacl is Tera Water. Lastly, Galarian Moltres can facilitate sweeps from physically oriented sweepers like Kingambit by removing obstacles like Great Tusk and Gholdengo.</p>"

Maximum HP with Sitrus Berry highlights Azumarill’s naturally exceptional defensive typing, allowing it to serve as a one time check to OU staples such as Dragapult, Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake. Belly Drum is an incredibly threatening option that lets Azumarill take advantage of the switches it forces from Pokemon such as Hydreigon to get setup opportunities. It is also a threatening late-game sweeper, as it can outspeed and OHKO defensive walls such as Clodsire, Slowking, and Garganacl while KOing most neutral faster targets such as Gholdengo and Iron Valiant with a +6 Aqua Jet. The threat of Belly Drum also lets Azumarill force uncomfortable mind games against Pokemon it can force out like weakened Great Tusk. Encore can be run over Liquidation to lock foes into undesirable moves to create more setup opportunities; this should be run with maximum Speed investment. Tera Water lets Azumarill OHKO even resisted targets such as Greninja, Meowscarada, and Dragapult with +6 Aqua Jet, as well as OHKOing Amoonguss and KOing Toxapex after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Azumarill serves as a valuable late-game sweeper for offense teams. Strong special attackers such as Iron Valiant and Greninja can help pressure Water-resistant foes such as Toxapex and Amoonguss to allow Azumarill to sweep without needing to Terastallize while providing Azumarill with setup opportunities against their checks like Dragapult and Hydreigon. Other setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Roaring Moon complement Azumarill, appreciating Azumarill's ability to break Amoonguss and Toxapex and wearing down each other's checks like Dondozo and Skeledirge. Entry hazard support from Pokémon like Glimmora and Garchomp provides the necessary chip damage to turn near OHKOs into true OHKOs on resisted Pokémon such as Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Meowscarada with Tera Water +6 Aqua Jet. Azumarill can pair well with teammates like Grimmsnarl and Orthworm that provide it with more setup opportunities. Pelipper is also a strong partner for Azumarill, as rain provides an extreme damage boost, giving it the ability to avoid needing to Terastallize versus Pokemon such as Toxapex, Dragapult, and Amoonguss.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Equipped with a Choice Band, Azumarill becomes a powerful wallbreaker strong enough to do significant damage to the opposing team. Combine that with Huge Power, priority from Aqua Jet, and the boost to STAB that comes from Tera Water, and Azumarill goes from powerful to extremely threatening for any ill-prepared team. Ice Spinner as coverage is useful to hit Amoonguss and Water Absorb Clodsire, while Superpower is an alternative to deal with Steel-types like Kingambit and Orthworm that would be harder to damage without it. 140 Speed EVs allow Azumarill to outspeed Corviknight and Skeledirge. The remaining 116 EVs in HP increase its survivability. This, along with the incredible defensive typing of Water / Fairy protecting it from the many Dragon-type threats roaming the tier, such as Dragapult and Walking Wake, gives it the opportunity to safely switch into many otherwise frightening Pokemon. Tera Water and Fairy are for powering up the Choce Band-boosted STAB attacks Azumarill uses. Tera Water is preferred to get the extra boost to Aqua Jet, but Tera Fairy can also be used to reduce the continual damage from Garganacl's Salt Cure.</p> <p>Choice Band Azumarill is best used on offensive teams and benefits from the support of Pokemon that can open up opportunities for it to break holes. Pokemon like Dragapult and Rotom-W can be excellent teammates by making ample use of pivoting moves throughout a game to let Azumarill in safely. Special attackers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth can be helpful to break through walls like Dondozo that Azumarill would otherwise struggle with. Faster Pokemon like Cinderace and Roaring Moon are useful as speed control to help cover Azumarill's low Speed. Most importantly though, entry hazards help Azumarill wear down tougher foes to be picked off later in the battle, so hazard setters like Great Tusk and Glimmora, as well as spinblockers like Gholdengo, are always appreciated teammates. Defensive Pokemon that have the tools to deal with Azumarill, like Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Dondozo, are the biggest thorns in Azumarill's side. Having another wallbreaker like Dragonite and Tera Electric Iron Valiant on the team can help mitigate some of these issues.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Azumarill leverages its good bulk and typing to check key special attackers such as Walking Wake, Hydreigon, and Greninja while maintaining a powerful offensive presence. An Assault Vest offers a noticeable increase to Azumarill's special bulk, letting it check a wider pool of special attackers such as Hisuian Zoroark and Dragapult while also granting it greater flexibility in its attacking options compared to Choice Band. Liquidation and Play Rough serve as Azumarill's primary STAB attacks, possessing fantastic neutral coverage and hitting many threats such as Dragonite, Walking Wake, and Iron Valiant for super effective damage. Aqua Jet allows Azumarill to revenge kill weakened foes such as Great Tusk and Iron Moth. Ice Spinner is a powerful coverage option, 2HKOing many of Azumarill's common switch-ins such as Amoonguss and Water Absorb Clodsire. Ice Spinner's ability to remove Terrain also makes it particularly useful against opposing Psychic Terrain teams. Tera Water increases the power of Azumarill's Water-type STAB moves, letting it pick off foes such as Iron Moth from higher ranges with Aqua Jet and allowing its Liquidation to 2HKO Hatterene and OHKO offensive Great Tusk. However, Tera Water does come with noticable drawbacks, namely removing Azumarill's immunity to Dragon-type moves and resistances to Fighting- and Dark-type moves, which can make it a shakier check to Walking Wake and Greninja.</p> <p>Assault Vest Azumarill's talents will best be used by more offensive teams looking for a temporary answer to the aforementioned special threats. Partners at risk of being revenge killed by Walking Wake and Iron Valiant, such as Great Tusk and Hydreigon, will greatly appreciate Azumarill's ability to act as a buffer against these Pokemon. Despite Azumarill's good bulk, its tanking prowess can often be undermined by its vulnerability to passive damage from entry hazards and Rocky Helmet. Great Tusk is therefore an excellent partner, providing Rapid Spin support and being able to lure and remove Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Corviknight with Knock Off. Meowscarada is also an excellent ally, being able to shut down opposing entry hazard setters with Taunt while also providing Knock Off support. Furthermore, both Great Tusk and Meowscarada can support Azumarill by laying down entry hazards, which it will greatly appreciate given its ability to force switches. Ting-Lu can similarly lay down multiple layers of entry hazards and ease pressure exerted onto Azumarill in dealing with threats such as Dragapult and Iron Moth. Teammates that can bring Azumarill in safely with a pivoting move, such as Cinderace and Dragapult, are also recommended. Cinderace can assist Azumarill in dealing with entry hazards via Court Change, while Dragapult can deal with Orthworm, which may sometimes use Azumarill as an entry point to pass Shed Tail. In return, Azumarill can check key Pokemon such as Greninja that would threaten them. Azumarill greatly struggles against bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Toxapex, Dondozo, and Tera Water Garganacl. Hydreigon can exploit both Toxapex and Garganacl's passivity to set up with Substitute and Nasty Plot, though it must be wary of switching in against Toxic and Salt Cure. Breloom can pressure Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl with Bullet Seed, while Covert Cloak Gholdengo matches up quite nicely against Garganacl and opposing Breloom and can pivot into Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W.</p>"

Future Sight allows Galarian Slowking to pressure a number of offensive threats like Iron Valiant, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta and do significant damage to defensive foes like Toxapex and Clodsire. Chilly Reception alongside minimum Speed investment allows Galarian Slowking to serve as the metagame's slowest pivot, able to safely bring in offensive teammates safely while changing the weather to snow, which disrupts weather archetypes like rain and sun. Galarian Slowking has a number of options for its last move: Thunder Wave allows it to cripple fast offensive threats like Dragapult and Weavile while preventing Kingambit from freely switching into Galarian Slowking, Toxic wears down opposing walls like Ting-Lu and Dondozo as well as Thunder Wave-immune targets like Raging Bolt, and Slack Off offers immediate recovery, allowing Galarian Slowking to stay on the field longer. Tera Water lets Galarian Slowking stand up to powerful Fire-types like Gouging Fire and Cinderace as well as offensive Water-types like Walking Wake, while Tera Fairy gives it an immunity to strong Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Walking Wake, Raging Bolt, and Kyurem. Tera Dark is another option that turns Galarian Slowking's Dark- and Ghost-type weaknesses into resistances, making it more resilient against foes like Greninja and Dragapult. 16 Defense EVs allow Galarian Slowking to live a Knock Off from Meowscarada.</p> <p>Galarian Slowking is an excellent choice for a pivot on balance teams, as frail offensive teammates like Kyurem and Iron Valiant appreciate being brought in safely as well as the pressure applied by Future Sight. Kyurem in particular enjoys the Defense boost from snow, allowing it to stomach attacks from foes like Zamazenta and Kingambit more easily. Due to its average Defense, Galarian Slowking benefits from physically defensive partners like Archaludon and Skarmory to form a solid defensive core. Galarian Slowking struggles against special walls like Ting-Lu and Skeledirge if not running Toxic, so physically offensive teammates like Weavile and Hisuian Samurott that can take care of them make good partners. Additionally, Galarian Slowking is walled by Steel-types like Corviknight and Heatran, so teammates like Volcarona and Great Tusk that can remove them are necessary. Ground-immune teammates like Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Corviknight are also good partners for Galarian Slowking due to its weakness to common threats like Great Tusk and opposing Gliscor.</p>"

Skarmory's immense physical bulk allows it to tank hits from the aforementioned Pokemon and punish them with Rocky Helmet chip damage, making it a great sponge on balanced structures. Skarmory is able to set up Iron Defense on physical attackers, increasing its Defense exponentially and massively boosting the power of Body Press while denying any setup opportunities. With enough Defense boosts, Skarmory can turn into a deadly late-game win condition with IronPress, only stopped by Ghost-types. Rocky Helmet makes it impossible for even fully Attack-boosted Pokemon to match its Defense boosts, as Skarmory's access to Roost grants it longevity, letting it outlive almost every physical setup Pokemon in the long term. Iron Defense Skarmory also has access to Spikes and Stealth Rock, making it more proactive against Pokemon such as Gliscor and Ting-Lu that may use it as an opportunity to set up entry hazards. Tera Dragon gives Skarmory a great resistance to Fire, which lets it check Pokemon such as bulky Gouging Fire with no Dragon-type STAB moves and Cinderace; it also eases the matchup against Ogerpon-W. Tera Fighting gives Skarmory extra insurance against Kingambit thanks to its Kowtow Cleave resistance and is especially useful for teams that are potentially weak to Jolly Kingambit late-game. Skarmory is EVed to outspeed Adamant Kingambit, with the remaining EVs allocated to HP and Defense.</p> <p>Iron Defense Skarmory is outstanding on balance teams that struggle against setup Pokemon that take advantage of the team's passivity, synergizing with Pokemon like Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and Clefable, as they can set up entry hazards to pressure foes as well as remove opposing Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off. It also pairs well with Toxapex and Galarian Slowking, which can sponge special moves that Skarmory is unable to take, and they also check dangerous threats such as Volcarona and Cinderace. These Pokemon are often fodder for opposing Swords Dance Kingambit or Bulk Up Great Tusk; however, Skarmory handles them with ease. Skarmory is also great against Pokemon such as Iron Defense Zamazenta and Rillaboom thanks to its solid typing and immense bulk. Chip damage from Rocky Helmet disincentivizes the aforementioned Pokemon from using physical moves, and Skarmory outlives them eventually thanks to its longevity and recovery capabilities with Roost. Despite Skarmory's great physical bulk, it is vulnerable to special attackers and Ghost-types that may take advantage of it, such as Volcarona, Gholdengo, and Dragapult. Ting-Lu and Galarian Slowking are great for tanking special attackers' hits, the former being a great Ghost-type check. Heavy-Duty Boots Kingambit is also a good choice alongside Skarmory, as it can find opportunities to set up against Ghost-types while being a reliable sponge, as well as having strong priority moves against the special attackers that Skarmory would otherwise struggle against. In return, Skarmory can set Spikes for Kingambit and act as a reliable wall to some of Kingambit's checks, particularly Bulk Up Great Tusk and Iron Defense Zamazenta. Due to its lack of pivoting capabilities unlike Corviknight, Skarmory also appreciates Pokemon that can tank hits and pivot around, such as Rotom-W, U-turn Gliscor, and Meowscarada.</p>"

Knock Off can be run instead of Hurricane to cripple foes like Galarian Slowking, making them easier for its teammates to break through. A Speed-reducing nature in conjunction with 0 Speed IVs gives Pelipper its slowest possible U-turn, allowing it to safely bring in teammates to make use of its rain. It also lets Pelipper underspeed uninvested Tyranitar and the niche Hippowdon, allowing its rain to override their sand in the lead matchup. A physically defensive EV spread lets Pelipper easily handle physical threats like Hisuian Samurott and Zamazenta, running enough Special Defense EVs to guarantee take on Enamorus's Moonblast after Stealth Rock. On the other hand, a specially defensive spread can be used to take less damage from special attackers that would otherwise take advantage of Pelipper's poor Special Defense, such as Gholdengo and Enamorus, as well as avoiding an OHKO from Choice Specs Dragapult's Draco Meteor, while running enough Defense EVs to survive two Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge from full. Though Pelipper is rarely Terastallized, Tera Ground can be used to remove its 4x weakness to Electric-type moves from Raging Bolt and Zapdos and safely pivot out of them.</p> <p>Pelipper should be used exclusively on rain teams where it is commonly partnered with powerful wallbreakers like Barraskewda, which is greatly enabled by Swift Swim activation, and Raging Bolt, which benefits from Water-type Weather Ball to break through Ground-types.

Because Damp Rock is needed to maximize the number of rain turns, Pelipper appreciates having a teammate that can switch into Knock Off, such as Kingambit, especially if its Air Balloon has been popped. Due to its 4x weakness to Electric-type moves, Pelipper enjoys Ground-type teammates like Iron Treads that can easily switch into the likes of Raging Bolt.

Will-O-Wisp can cripple physical attackers like Great Tusk looking to scare Torkoal out, while Body Press can be run instead to improve Torkoal's matchup against Taunt Roaring Moon, Heatran, and Ting-Lu. A physically defensive EV spread with 12 Special Defense EVs lets Torkoal easily take hits from common threats like Zamazenta and Hawlucha while still living defensive Gholdengo's +2 Shadow Ball and two of Choice Specs Kyurem's Ice Beam. A specially defensive EV spread can instead help bolster Torkoal's middling Special Defense against the likes of Dragapult and Gholdengo, with 36 Defense EVs letting it survive +2 Weavile's Knock Off after Stealth Rock. Though Torkoal is rarely the choice to be Terastallized, Tera Flying can be used to remove its Ground-type weakness versus Pokemon like Landorus-T and Great Tusk, while Tera Water is an all-around solid defensive typing that greatly improves its matchups against rain teams and Pokemon like Iron Boulder and Heatran.</p> <p>Torkoal should only be used on sun teams, where wallbreakers like Gouging Fire and Walking Wake take great advantage of the sun to activate Protosynthesis and power up their Fire-type moves and Hydro Steam. Raging Bolt is also an appreciated addition to sun teams to threaten Water-types like Ogerpon-W and Dondozo, and Choice Band Roaring Moon is another fantastic option thanks to its ability to serve as an offensive pivot with U-turn, wallbreaker, and potential revenge killer if using Speed-boosting Protosynthesis. Hisuian Lilligant is also a strong late-game cleaner on sun teams, helping check Ground-types while significantly improving the often difficult matchup against Iron Boulder thanks to outspeeding it with Chlorophyll active, and Venusaur can also serve as a slower if slightly bulkier Chlorophyll sweeper. Because Torkoal's primary role is to set sun, it appreciates teammates like Kingambit and Eject Button Hatterene that can switch into Knock Off and allow it to keep its Heat Rock. Despite also serving as an entry hazard remover, Torkoal is weak to Stealth Rock and lacks any form of reliable recovery, so it benefits from secondary removal support from teammates like Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Hatterene is a great teammate that can serve as a tertiary form of hazard control with Magic Bounce, help keep its own threats healthy with Healing Wish, and check common Ground-types like Gliscor and Great Tusk with Calm Mind sets.</p>"

This also serves to deny dual screens from opposing Deoxys-S and Alolan Ninetales, stop setup sweepers like Volcarona, Gouging Fire, Raging Bolt, and Kingambit from using it as setup fodder, and prevent Cinderace from using Court Change on its hazards. Deoxys-S's last moveslot is more flexible; Psycho Boost gives Deoxys-S a high power STAB option to reliably deal damage, notably improving the matchup against lead Glimmora by preventing it from using Mortal Spin against Deoxys-S for free while also threatening to OHKO Great Tusk. Alternatively, Skill Swap is an option that allows for Deoxys-S to get up entry hazards against Hatterene by removing its Magic Bounce while also having the potential to remove Gliscor's Poison Heal and Serperior's Contrary to give a partner free turns to set up after Deoxys-S goes down, particularly in conjunction with Taunt to deny their Toxic and Glare respectively. Focus Sash is Deoxys-S's best item choice, potentially allowing it to set up multiple layers of hazards while also giving it insurance to take a hit and safely use Taunt on an opposing lead, but Mental Herb can instead be considered to block Taunt from opposing Deoxys-S and win the lead matchup. An EV spread maximizing Speed with a Timid nature is optimal for the tie with opposing Deoxys-S, while maximum Special Attack is selected to power up a set using Psycho Boost; for Skill Swap Deoxys-S, maximum HP is used instead. Tera Ghost is optimal on Deoxys-S for its ability to block Rapid Spin from Iron Treads, Torkoal, and Excadrill, while Tera Steel is a more niche option that grants it an immunity to Glimmora's Mortal Spin.</p> <p>Deoxys-S is an excellent fit on hyper offense teams that appreciate both entry hazards being set on the opponent's side of the field and hazards being denied in return by Taunt. This makes setup sweepers like Raging Bolt, Gouging Fire, and Kingambit great pairings, as hazards can be used to wear down their checks like Ting-Lu and Great Tusk; these Pokemon themselves also enjoy hazards being kept off of their side of the field, with the latter two in particular appreciating the freedom to use a boosting item or Leftovers. Another offensive threat that enjoys hazards being able to wear down switch-ins is Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, itself able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from targets like Dondozo with Knock Off to take full advantage of Deoxys-S's hazards. Many other offensive sweepers benefit greatly from hazard support from Deoxys-S, with Volcarona, Darkrai, and Iron Valiant all being fantastic partners that take advantage of checks like Ting-Lu, Heatran, and Primarina being forced to take hazard damage. Deoxys-S's strongest partner in this regard though is Gholdengo, which crucially blocks Rapid Spin from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads along with Defog from Corviknight to ensure that Deoxys-S's hazards remain on the field for the rest of the game even after Deoxys-S goes down. Gholdengo additionally benefits from hazard support itself, as both Ting-Lu and Kingambit taking hazards upon switching into it can assist it greatly with breaking through a team. Unfortunately, despite Deoxys-S possessing the highest unboosted Speed in the tier, it does have some less than positive lead matchups; Booster Energy Iron Treads is able to outrun Deoxys-S and set up Stealth Rock against it while being able to remove Deoxys-S's hazards with Rapid Spin unless it chooses to Tera Ghost, and Hisuian Samurott can set Spikes with Ceaseless Edge regardless of Taunt before potentially picking Deoxys-S off with Aqua Jet after bringing it down to its Focus Sash. Forms of hazard removal that are still able to fit well onto a hyper offensive team are therefore appreciated, with Bulk Up Great Tusk able to provide excellent role compression as both a sweeper and a hazard remover with Rapid Spin. Strong priority users like Rillaboom and Dragonite can also choose to lead off and prevent Deoxys-S from being able to get up a second layer of hazards with their priority attacks; Booster Energy Iron Boulder can use Swords Dance on Deoxys-S before it can use Taunt without fearing a Psycho Boost; and specially defensive Pelipper is able to safely use U-turn on Deoxys-S to break its Focus Sash, bring in a Swift Swim user like Barraskewda, and deny more than one layer of hazards. Hence, offensive checks to these Pokemon such as Rillaboom and Dragonite themselves, Great Tusk, and Kingambit can help to patch up those matchups, with the latter three able to not only force out these threats but take advantage of them with their own setup options.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its monstrous Speed, decent attacking stats, and amazing coverage, Deoxys-S can function as a great revenge killer and late-game cleaner. It outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon in OU and outspeeds plenty of boosted Pokemon as well, such as +1 Great Tusk, +1 Volcarona. and +1 Gouging Fire. Fighting-type coverage is required to hit Dark- and Steel-types that switch into Psycho Boost, like Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Superpower can be run to hit special walls like Blissey, but Focus Blast doesn't have any stat drops and also benefits from boosts from Nasty Plot. Knock Off removes items, helping it break down walls like Galarian Slowking and Ting-Lu by removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers. Shadow Ball can be used instead if it's running Nasty Plot and to avoid being walled by Hatterene. In its last move slot, it can run Ice Beam for even greater coverage, letting it destroy Dragonite, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. However, Psycho Boost hits the latter two hard anyway, so Nasty Plot can be ran instead to drastically increase its killing power if it’s running only special moves. For example, +2 Psycho Boost can OHKO Volcarona, +2 Focus Blast can OHKO specially defensive Heatran, and +2 Shadow Ball can OHKO Galarian Slowking, Hatterene, and Gholdengo. Finally, Taunt can be used as utility, denying hazards, setup, and keeping Deoxys-S free from status like Gliscor's Toxic and Clefable's Thunder Wave, and also stopping Galarian Slowking from gaining momentum with Chilly Reception. Other moves Deoxys-S can run include Expanding Force over Psycho Boost if it's used with Psychic Terrain and Stealth Rock or Spikes in its last slot to take advantage of switches. A Timid nature should be ran if using Nasty Plot, but a Naive nature should be used if running a mixed set. A Hasty nature is an alternative to better take special moves like Raging Bolt's Thunderclap, but it makes Deoxys-S weaker into common priority like Extreme Speed and Grassy Glide. Tera Fighting is its premier Tera type, giving it STAB on its Fighting-type coverage, letting it hit Psycho Boost switch-ins harder. It guarantees that Superpower will 2HKO Heatran and Iron Treads and lets +2 Focus Blast OHKO Ting-Lu. It also has defensive utility, like giving it a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Tera Ghost can be useful on Shadow Ball sets to break past its Psychic-type switch-ins, letting it get a 2HKO on Galarian Slowking and Latias. It also gives Deoxys-S an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed. Finally, Tera Psychic further boosts its Psycho Boosts, which lets it guarantee an OHKO into Walking Wake and Ogerpon-W and gives it a good chance to OKHO Gouging Fire. Life Orb boosts its damage output, but Expert Belt can be used instead to avoid recoil damage. However, missing out on Life Orb can cost Deoxys-S some KOs like missing a 2HKO on Clefable with Psycho Boost and losing the ability to do substantial damage to Corviknight.</p> <p>Deoxys-S is best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Offensive teammates such as Volcarona, Roaring Moon, and Gouging Fire like the holes Deoxys-S pokes into opposing teams. It can damage walls like Ting-Lu, Blissey, and Galarian Slowking for these teammates or check other offensive Pokemon that outspeed them like +1 Kyurem and Dragapult. Its Fighting-type coverage takes care of Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Heatran, removing checks for other teammates like its own Kingambit, Dragapult, and Volcarona. Similarly, its Ghost- or Dark-type coverage lets it take out Hatterene and Gholdengo, opening up opportunities for teammates like Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder to clean up late-game. Thanks to its perfect coverage, it is able to deal decent damage to any opponent, further opening holes for its teammates. This includes Pokemon like Dondozo, Roaring Moon, and Corviknight. Offensive teammates also appreciate its fast Knock Off removing items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from walls like Galarian Slowking and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard support from teammates like Hisuian Samurott, Ting-Lu, and Glimmora help with breaking as well. Similarly, if it runs Taunt, teammates such as Kyurem and Gouging Fire like its fast Taunt denying hazards, stopping setup from opponents, and limiting recovery. While Deoxys-S has great coverage, its base 95 attacking stats are relatively low, and Psycho Boost lowering its Special Attack is less than ideal. As such, it can struggle to break past certain walls it can't hit super effectively like Corviknight and Assault Vest Primarina. Volcarona invites in Primarina and can damage it with Giga Drain. This chip damage can allow Deoxys-S to KO Primarina later in the game, while the chip Deoxys-S does to Primarina can allow Volcarona to sweep. Raging Bolt can freely switch into Corviknight and set up free Calm Minds as it switches out. Despite its massive natural Speed stat, Deoxys-S is still outsped by a lot of prominent boosted Pokemon like +1 Roaring Moon, +1 Iron Boulder, +1 Walking Wake, and Barraskewda in rain. These can be covered by carrying offensive checks to these mons like Kingambit, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Ogerpon-W. Deoxys-S is also horribly weak to priority. It doesn't have many ways to work around Sucker Punch, and other priority like Grassy Glide and Extreme Speed hit it hard. A way around this is having teammates that can easily take common priority like Kingambit, Great Tusk, or Dragonite. Additionally, dual screen setters, like Alolan Ninetales, can help against priority and assist Deoxys-S in setting up Nasty Plots. Psychic Terrain from Indeedee is another option due to it blocking priority, and it also boosts Deoxys-S’s Psychic-type STAB moves.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its unparalleled Speed tier and access to an array of solid utility options, Deoxys-S is one of the best dual screens setters in OU. Taunt is key in preventing Pokemon like Glimmora, Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T from laying entry hazards, setup threats such as Swords Dance Ogerpon-W and Dragon Dance Kyurem from boosting, and Cinderace from using Court Change. Psycho Boost lets Deoxys-S have some sort of offensive presence; it can obliterate lead Glimmora while overwhelming neutral targets like Dondozo and physically defensive Skeledirge. Deoxys-S generally should not Terastallize, as being unable to Terastallize a wallbreaker later in the match could be game ending. However, in a pinch, Tera Steel can let it more easily set dual screens against priority users like Weavile, Dragonite, and Rillaboom.</p> <p>Deoxys-S is a fixture on dual screens hyper offense teams thanks to its absolutely blazing Speed that surpasses every unboosted Pokemon in the tier, letting it ensure at least one of Reflect or Light Screen go up. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, Iron Boulder, Volcarona, Iron Valiant, and Serperior are amazing at making use of Deoxys-S's screens support, taking a hit from Deoxys-S's potential revenge killers such as Kingambit and Cinderace with it and being able to strike back strong. In particular, Volcarona's solid natural bulk and ability to switch in on Pokemon that would otherwise break Deoxys-S like Weavile and Kingambit make it an excellent partner. Cleaners such as Dragon Dance Kyurem, Kingambit, and Choice Scarf Enamorus are similarly potent behind dual screens. Due to Ceaseless Edge, Hisuian Samurott's Spikes cannot be denied by Deoxys-S, so Pokemon that can take advantage of Hisuian Samurott such as Iron Valiant and Enamorus are good teammates. Entry hazard control options like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Hatterene also make for good partners in the event that Deoxys-S is unable to prevent hazards being set. Great Tusk and Hatterene in particular can double as potent bulky setup sweepers with Bulk Up and Calm Mind, respectively. Other bulky setup Pokemon like Latias and Iron Crown benefit similarly from screens.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Weavile is an excellent wallbreaker thanks to its high Speed and Attack and high base power moves, including a Knock Off that Skarmory, Gliscor, and Clefable cannot safely absorb. Weavile also provides excellent speed control for teams, outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame besides Darkrai, Zamazenta, Dragapult, and Deoxys-S while being able to slot in Ice Shard to pick off +1 Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Enamorus. Swords Dance allows Weavile to OHKO bulky Pokemon like defensive Great Tusk, Kyurem, and Ting-Lu at +2 with Triple Axel and OHKO Enamorus and Dragapult after Stealth Rock with Ice Shard. Low Kick can be slotted over Swords Dance to OHKO opposing Weavile, Hisuian Samurott, and Kingambit, but dropping Swords Dance limits Weavile's power and leaves it always walled by Skarmory and Clefable. Tera Ice boosts Triple Axel and Ice Shard to increase its wallbreaking and revenge killing potential, with +2 Tera Ice Triple Axel OHKOing Clefable and most Skarmory variants after Stealth Rock damage while +2 Tera Ice Ice Shard OHKOes Dragonite. Tera Dark can be ran to boost Knock Off, with it now having significant odds of OHKOing specially defensive Skeledirge and specially defensive Heatran as well as 2HKOing Alomomola at +2 while still stomaching Kingambit's Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Weavile's excellent wallbreaking capabilities and capability to fit on offense, balance, and semi-stall teams give it great synergy with a wide variety of Pokemon. Spikers are the best Pokemon to pair with Weavile because Weavile is excellent at using Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers. On slower teams, spikers that benefit from Weavile include Gliscor, Skarmory and Ting-Lu, while on faster teams, Weavile supports Hisuian Samurott and Deoxys-S. Stealth Rock is less effective against most Weavile answers other than Skarmory and Corviknight, but they still synergize with Weavile's Knock Off. Stealth Rock setters on offensive teams include Glimmora and Landorus-T, while bulkier teams can make use of Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Clefable. Weavile also benefits other physical attackers that appreciate Weavile using Knock Off on Pokemon like Skarmory, Dondozo, Corviknight, and Alomomola. Kingambit is the biggest beneficiary of Weavile's Knock Off, but other physical attackers like Hisuian Samurott and Gouging Fire can also take advantage of its Knock Off to break through Pokemon like Dondozo and prevent chip damage from Skarmory's Rocky Helmet. Special attackers like Volcarona, Raging Bolt, and Dragapult can draw in special walls like Ting-Lu, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire for Weavile to come in on for opportunities to use Knock Off; Dragapult in particular can use U-turn to pivot into Weavile. Weavile struggles with faster Pokemon that can't be threatened with Ice Shard, which includes boosted Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and boosted Iron Boulder. On slower teams, Pokemon that can wall these faster foes are appreciated like Clodsire and Galarian Slowking for Iron Valiant, while Dondozo and Skarmory are best for Iron Boulder and Zamazenta. On faster teams, Gholdengo and priority users like Raging Bolt can check them. Galarian Slowking in particular is excellent, as Weavile appreciates support from Chilly Reception giving it entry on Pokemon like Gholdengo and Ting-Lu, while Future Sight prevents switch-ins like Zamazenta, Dondozo and Skarmory from coming in. Dondozo, Zamazenta and Skarmory can counter Weavile, but Dragapult and Gholdengo can swap into their attacks and force progress; Dragapult threatens heavy damage or burn while Gholdengo can use these Pokemon to boost with Nasty Plot.</p>"

  "Gliscor": {
    "sets": {
      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>Gliscor is a premier Spikes user. The combination of Poison Heal and Protect allows it to outlast common entry hazard removal options such as Great Tusk and Cinderace, setting it apart from its peers. Gliscor can survive some of the strongest neutral attacks in the tier with ease, including Life Orb Darkrai's Dark Pulse, Choice Specs Dragapult's Shadow Ball, and Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave. Its immunity to status conditions helps it against more defensively oriented teams, allowing it to be unfazed by Toxic from opposing Gliscor, Galarian Slowking, and Toxapex or by Will-O-Wisp from Cinderace, Skeledirge, and Dragapult. Protect is not just useful for giving Gliscor a free turn of recovery; it is also useful for scouting the moves of Choice-locked Pokemon that are able to break it, like Kyurem and Walking Wake. Toxic is used to whittle away at the foe’s health, as the combination of Toxic and Protect allows the poison damage to worsen while Gliscor heals itself in the process. Gliscor spreads status exceptionally well because most Pokemon immune to Toxic like Clodsire and Gholdengo are weak to Earthquake. Toxic is not always required though, as Knock Off can be substituted over it to remove foes' Heavy-Duty Boots, allowing teams that rely on hazard stacking to make progress, especially if the team lacks another Knock Off user or have a different Toxic user. On stall teams, Poison Jab can be run instead to allow Gliscor to pressure Hatterene and Taunt Tera Flying Roaring Moon, which otherwise have extremely favorable matchups against the team. A physically defensive EV spread with an Impish nature lets Gliscor check Pokemon like Great Tusk lacking Ice Spinner, Dragonite, Iron Boulder, Gouging Fire, and Roaring Moon, and the Special Defense EVs provide enough special bulk to survive +1 Enamorus's Moonblast and Life Orb Deoxys-S's Psycho Boost from full. A specially defensive EV spread can be run instead to check Pokemon like Heatran, Raging Bolt, and Gholdengo, retaining enough physical bulk to live Ogerpon-W's unboosted Ivy Cudgel from full. Both sets run 244 HP EVs to maximize the amount of health Gliscor recovers from Poison Heal. Tera Water lets Gliscor flip bad matchups against Water-types like Walking Wake and Hisuian Samurott as well as Ice-types like Weavile while being a great defensive typing in general. Tera Ghost prevents Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk and Iron Treads from removing its Spikes and grants an immunity to Facade from Ursaluna, which is otherwise very problematic for the bulky teams that Gliscor fits in. However, these are best reserved as a last resort, since Gliscor immensely appreciates its base typing because of its Stealth Rock neutrality and Spikes immunity. Moreover, Gliscor's teammates will generally get more mileage from Tera, so using it on Gliscor is not worth it most of the time.</p> <p>Gliscor functions best on entry hazard stacking balance teams, since its role compression provides flexibility in what Pokemon and sets these structures can run; it is also excellent on stall teams due to its longevity and excellent defensive profile. Gliscor’s role as a Spikes setter and Toxic user gives its team a much easier time breaking down opposing defensive balances and pivoting cores, punishing switches and poisoning foes that decide to stay in. Gliscor works in conjunction with its offensive partners by forcing switches while also soaking up incoming attacks from powerful offensive threats, giving it and its teammates ample opportunities to force progress. With these traits, Gholdengo makes an amazing teammate for Gliscor, since after Gliscor sets up Spikes, Gholdengo blocks all removal options aside from Court Change Cinderace, which Gliscor can beat one-on-one. Galarian Slowking is another great teammate, being able to sponge hits from strong special attackers such as Kyurem, Walking Wake, Serperior, and Enamorus, many of which threaten Gliscor out. In return, Gliscor walls physical Ground-type attackers that easily dispose of Galarian Slowking, like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T. Stealth Rock users such as Ting-Lu and Clefable pair very well with Gliscor, and stacking hazards is a very effective way at making progress. Knock Off users such as the aforementioned Clefable, as well as Meowscarada and Weavile, work well with Gliscor, since they allow it to run Toxic to punish bulkier Pokemon, and they are able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon that do not come in on Gliscor so that its hazards can chip more effectively throughout the game. Late-game cleaners such as Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Kingambit all work well with Gliscor too, as they appreciate their checks having to constantly switch and get chipped by Spikes early- and mid-game, putting them into KO range late-game. Because Gliscor is so excellent on stall teams, teammates like Dondozo, Clodsire, and Blissey greatly appreciate Gliscor's ability to force progress with Spikes and Poison Jab, especially against threats to stall like Calm Mind Hatterene and Taunt Roaring Moon. In return, Dondozo can sponge powerful Ice-type attacks from Meowscarada and Weavile while keeping powerful physical attackers like Gouging Fire and Kingambit at bay, while Clodsire and Blissey can collectively wall the vast majority of special attackers and take some pressure off Gliscor as a result.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Gliscor can make a lot of easy progress throughout the game thanks to its great bulk, being able to use Swords Dance in front of opposing Gliscor and other passive Pokemon such as Clefable, Clodsire, and Toxapex to become an offensive threat. Gliscor being permanently affected by poison allows it to use Facade consistently, which breaks Pokemon such as Ogerpon-W, Hawlucha, and Dragonite. Swords Dance Gliscor can threaten common Knock Off absorbers like Clefable, particularly on Heavy-Duty Boots spam teams, so it can effectively use Knock Off instead against these teams to punish different foes, especially entry hazard-weak Pokemon such as Volcarona, Zapdos, and Enamorus. Ice Fang is another option that can be run over Knock Off to shut down opposing Gliscor, which may give the team trouble, or to have better coverage and damage against opposing Dragon-, Flying-, and Grass-types such as Dragapult, Dragonite, and Rillaboom. Tera Water flips Gliscor's matchup against Ice- and Water-types such as Weavile and Barraskewda defensively; however, it becomes a worse check to Pokemon such as Rillaboom. For teams that are not as strong defensively into Grass-types, Tera Dragon is recommended, as it covers for both Water and Grass, and most notably, it shuts down Ogerpon-W and gains a better matchup versus Serperior and other potent offensive threats that would have been able to beat Gliscor even with Tera Water. 16 Special Defense EVs allow Gliscor to survive both a Choice Specs Enamorus's Moonblast and Life Orb Deoxys-S's Psycho Boost from full health, or it can be given more special bulk to better handle common offensive threats like Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Iron Moth, which may chunk it heavily and affect its time on field otherwise. The 36 Defense EVs on the specially bulky EV spread allow Gliscor to comfortably survive Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel from full health.</p> <p>Swords Dance Gliscor best fits on teams that need to break balance structures, most prominently teams that utilize multiple Heavy-Duty Boots users. Gliscor enjoys being a part of Spikes-stacking teams that need guaranteed progress against opposing Heavy-Duty Boots spam teams, which Spikes-stacking teams usually lose to. As a result, Ting-Lu and Skarmory are great teammates, as they can set up entry hazards and directly complement Gliscor defensively. Gholdengo also pairs well, preventing Defog and hindering the removal of hazards. However, Gliscor's lack of Toxic or hazards makes it exert less pressure long-term, prevents it from placing opposing Pokemon on a timer such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, and means it cannot punish any switch-ins to it with a Toxic. Teammates such as Weaville and Choice Specs Dragapult help Gliscor's lack of pressure with great upfront damage. Swords Dance Gliscor is also unable to deal with the common Iron Defense Skarmory on balance teams or muscle through common defensive walls such as Dondozo and Corviknight; however, access to Knock Off allows it remove their items at the very least, which could be helpful in the long run for Gliscor's teammates. Teammates such as, Kyurem and Rotom-W are great with Swords Dance Gliscor, as they can beat the fatter Pokemon that Gliscor is unable to muscle through, such as the aforementioned Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Corviknight. Gholdengo and Ogerpon-W are also good options, as they are able to turn threats such as Skarmory and Dondozo into setup fodder.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Heatran is a fearsome wallbreaker capable of easily shutting down defensive teams, leveraging its defensive profile to find multiple opportunities to switch in and wreak havoc. Magma Storm is a powerful Fire-type STAB move that can trap Pokemon like Blissey and Toxapex. Earth Power allows Heatran to hit bulky Fire-types that would otherwise resist Magma Storm such as Skeledirge, Gouging Fire and, most notably, opposing Leftovers Heatran. Taunt completely shuts down recovery from defensive Pokemon that would otherwise withstand its offensive assault such as Galarian Slowking and Blissey, and it allows Heatran to beat each of these Pokemon 1-on-1 in tandem with Magma Storm. Stealth Rock can be considered in the last slot, as Heatran's consistency in forcing switches can give it a free turn to set up Stealth Rock; however, Will-O-Wisp can be used to hinder switch-ins such as Roaring Moon and Ting-Lu that would otherwise freely switch in against Heatran. A Timid nature lets Heatran outspeed and threaten Choice Band Rillaboom, in addition to quickly burning Adamant Dragonite with Will-O-Wisp, though a Modest nature could be considered to guarantee an OHKO on bulky Kingambit variants. Tera Grass flips Heatran's matchup against Water- and Ground-types such as Hisuian Samurott and Landorus-T and synergizes very well with Flash Fire; Tera Ghost grants Heatran a crucial Fighting immunity that can help against Zamazenta, in addition to blocking Rapid Spin from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Leftovers provides Heatran with passive recovery and allows it to stick around over the course of the match; Air Balloon could also be used to provide Heatran with a temporary Ground immunity, letting it safely switch into Gouging Fire and opposing Heatran.</p> <p>Heatran fits primarily on offense and bulky offense teams where it excels in ripping apart defensive cores for its teammates to exploit. Special sweepers such as Primarina and Raging Bolt greatly enjoy Heatran trapping and removing their checks, particularly Blissey. In return, Primarina discourages Ground-type switch-ins such as Landorus-T and Ting-Lu, while Raging Bolt can force out Water-types like Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott. Rillaboom is another fantastic teammate for Heatran that not only provides it with extra passive recovery and more resistance against Earthquake but can form a formidable offensive core with it, with Rillaboom capable of handling Ground- and Water-types such as Great Tusk and Ogerpon-W and Heatran taking advantage of Rillaboom's switch-ins like Corviknight and Skeledirge, alongside setting Stealth Rock to spread chip damage for both itself and Rillaboom. Additionally, some of Rillaboom's teammates like Hawlucha and Hatterene appreciate Heatran removing their checks via Magma Storm, allowing them to more easily sweep late-game, while both Pokemon can force out Ground- and Fighting-types like Great Tusk and Zamazenta. Lastly, Heatran enjoys Rapid Spin support from Great Tusk removing entry hazards that cut into its longevity, and it also enjoys having a check to Dragonite. In exchange, Heatran can easily switch in on and threaten Pokemon such as Meowscarada, Weavile, and Calm Mind Iron Valiant that Great Tusk struggles against.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Specially defensive Heatran is a useful glue Pokemon that can stallbreak, set entry hazards, spread status, and check notable special attackers like Gholdengo, Hatterene, Volcarona, and Galarian Slowking. Earth Power is a much-needed coverage move to hit Pokemon like opposing Heatran, Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Gouging Fire super effectively. Taunt is used to shut down recovery attempts from walls like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Terastallized Skeledirge that are trapped by Magma Storm, prevent Galarian Slowking from using Chilly Reception to escape Magma Storm's trapping, and prevent setup from both slower hazard setters like Clefable and Ting-Lu and slower setup sweepers like Terastallized Kingambit and Primarina. Stealth Rock is an extremely good fit since Heatran has excellent special bulk and threatens forms of hazard removal like Defog Corviknight and prevents Rapid Spin Great Tusk from switching in with a hard-hitting Magma Storm, keeping entry hazards up in the process. It is also able to punish Hatterene from switching in to deflect Stealth Rock back with Magic Bounce since it is unable to hit Heatran back for any notable damage. Will-O-Wisp can be used as a way to better check physical threats that enjoy switching in like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Hisuian Samurott; repeatedly chip down walls like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Dondozo; and neutralize Kingambit safely by bypassing its Sucker Punch. Will-O-Wisp also pairs with Magma Storm quite nicely since the chip damage stacks up over time. 4 Defense EVs in conjunction with maximum HP investment guarantees Heatran will live an Earthquake from Clodsire. 40 Speed EVs allow Heatran to outspeed Adamant Kingambit so it can secure a Magma Storm or Will-O-Wisp on it before it can retaliate with Kowtow Cleave or Low Kick. Leftovers gives Heatran a form of recovery, which can prove useful in a match where it's tasked with checking numerous special threats throughout the course of a game. However, Air Balloon is also a good choice, as it allows Heatran to come in on Ground-types that may not be packing coverage, such as Gliscor and Clodsire, and, in niche cases, Gouging Fire with no Dragon-type moves, and turn them into an opportunity to either trap them or get Stealth Rock up. Air Balloon also makes Heatran immune to Spikes, allowing it to come in much more safely against hazard stacking teams, and is a great item in general to emergency check Dragonite and Bulk Up Great Tusk with Will-O-Wisp. Flash Fire is generally the preferred ability of choice since it gives Heatran a Fire-type immunity to better check Volcarona and non-Earthquake Gouging Fire; however, Flame Body is also quite viable because it threatens burns against contact attackers such as Weavile, Meowscarada, and Rillaboom. Tera Grass allows Heatran to remove its weaknesses to Water- and Ground-type attacks so it can wall Water-types like Dondozo and Ogerpon-W and Ground-types like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor. Tera Grass also works well with Flash Fire to mitigate its newfound Fire weakness. Tera Ghost is used to remove its weakness to Fighting-type attacks so it can wall Zamazenta. Tera Ghost also gives it a Normal immunity, preventing Great Tusk from using Rapid Spin on it to remove its Stealth Rock and, if paired with Air Balloon, outright walling Dragonite if its only attacks are Extreme Speed and Earthquake or Fire Punch. Tera Fairy is also worth mentioning as a niche option to better check physical Dragon-types like Roaring Moon and Gouging Fire.</p> <p>Heatran is best used on Grassy Terrain bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to check Fire-types while also being a great progress maker itself. Rillaboom is by far its best teammate, as they both have near-perfect synergy with each other; Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain not only provides additional recovery for it on top of Leftovers, it also weakens Earthquake from common Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T. Rillaboom itself also threatens the Water- and Ground-types that constantly give Heatran trouble, like Gliscor, Alomomola, and Ogerpon-W, and brings in Heatran safely on its checks like Skarmory and Corviknight with U-turn. In return, Heatran is able to check Fire-types Rillaboom doesn't want to face, like Volcarona, Skeledirge, and opposing Heatran. Great Tusk is another stellar teammate since Heatran is extremely weak to entry hazards, so its hazard removal support is much appreciated. Hatterene is a teammate that can prevent hazards from being set up altogether thanks to Magic Bounce and wall Gliscor in Grassy Terrain, which is super useful since Heatran often struggles to check numerous threats consistently when Spikes are on the field. Grassy Terrain sweepers like Hawlucha, Ogerpon-W, and Raging Bolt love Heatran's ability to wear down bulkier Pokemon like Skeledirge, Galarian Slowking, Dondozo, and Ting-Lu so they can clean up late-game. On bulkier teams, Alomomola is a fitting teammate for it since its Wish support allows Heatran to stay alive for a prolonged period of time, and its typing checks common physical Water-types like Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott. Spikers like Hisuian Samurott, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu all work well with Heatran since they have good synergy typing-wise and their Spikes increases the potency of Magma Storm + Will-O-Wisp pressure. They can also form a hazard stacking core together with Stealth Rock Heatran.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Cresselia is a potent late-game wincon thanks to its gargantuan bulk, reliable recovery, and access to Calm Mind + Stored Power as well as solid coverage to deal with the Dark-types. After several Calm Mind boosts, Stored Power allows Cresselia to muscle past both Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Dondozo and bulky Psychic-resistant foes like Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Heatran while making it nigh impossible to KO with special attackers. Moonblast rounds out Cresselia's coverage, allowing it to hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Greninja super effectively while being able to at least damage Kingambit; Tera Blast Fighting greatly improves Cresselia's matchup against Kingambit and hits these Dark-types harder than Moonblast, but makes Cresselia more reliant on Terastallization. Leftovers grants Cresselia crucial passive healing, allowing it to conserve its limited Moonlight PP long-term; Covert Cloak, on the other hand, blocks secondary effects from an array of moves, including Heatran's Magma Storm, Garganacl's Salt Cure, Zapdos's Discharge, and Sneasler's Dire Claw, allowing Cresselia to set up against these threats more safely. Grassy Seed is an option if Cresselia is used on Grassy Terrain hyper offense teams, which gives it more opprotunities to set up in the face of physical attackers while also boosting its Stored Power. Tera Poison has wonderful synergy with Levitate, giving Cresselia a single weakness to Psychic-type attacks, granting it resistances to Poison- and Fairy-type attacks, and an immunity to Toxapex's Toxic while still maintaining its Fighting resistance. Defensively, Tera Fighting lets Cresselia flip its Dark weakness against prominent Pokemon like Meowscarada, Greninja, Hisuian Samurott, and the aforementioned Kingambit as well. 52 Speed EVs allow Cresselia to outspeed Kingambit.</p> <p>Cresselia fits well on an array of hyper offense, offense, and balance teams capable of supporting such a potent wincon. Heatran, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T can provide entry hazard support to wear down foes over time. Heatran can also use Will-O-Wisp to cripple Kingambit or trap and wear down threats like Haze Toxapex and Chilly Reception Galarian Slowking with Magma Storm and Taunt; in return, Cresselia can handle threats like Great Tusk and Zamazenta that Heatran struggles against. Kingambit is ubiquitous and is a major thorn in Cresselia's side; as such, Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Low Kick Kingambit are crucial partners that can help stop opposing Kingambit's attempt to countersweep. Assault Vest Toxapex is a great teammate for Cresselia; it can take on Encore Iron Valiant, which is a frustrating matchup for Cresselia, and it can trap and deal with opposing defensive Toxapex, which can shut down Cresselia's boosts with Haze and force Cresselia to Tera Poison in order to avoid being crippled by Toxic. Thanks to Grassy Surge, Rillaboom is a necessary partner for Grassy Seed variants; it can support Cresselia with utility options like Knock Off and U-turn too.</p>"

      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Hisuian Samurott establishes itself as a top-tier dedicated lead thanks to its signature move Ceaseless Edge, letting it threaten the opposition while reliably setting up layers of Spikes that bypass common entry hazard preventions such as Hatterene's Magic Bounce and Taunt from Deoxys-S and Landorus-T. It does so while still maintaining a decent offensive presence courtesy of its strong Sharpness-boosted STAB combination and a bevy of disruptive utility options. Though weaker, Aqua Cutter is a perfectly-accurate alternative over Razor Shell that notably ignores common contact effects like Landorus-T's Rocky Helmet, Heatran's Flame Body, and Zapdos's Static at the cost of potentially missing out on the 2HKO against Ting-Lu. Aqua Jet reliably picks off opposing Focus Sash leads like Deoxys-S, Glimmora, and Ribombee as well as targeting other faster Pokemon like Cinderace, Volcarona, and Great Tusk. Alternatively, Sucker Punch lets Hisuian Samurott hit faster Water-resistant Pokemon like Kyurem, Ogerpon-W, and Choice Specs Dragapult, the latter of which can be problematic in the offense mirror. Aside from being handy against bulky foes like Skarmory and Pelipper, Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots works extremely well with Spikes, making the likes of Alomomola, Dondozo, and Unaware Clefable susceptible to them, which is especially helpful because the latter two can trouble the hyper offense teams that Hisuian Samurott supports. Either Taunt or Encore prevents Hisuian Samurott from being used as setup fodder by the likes of Raging Bolt and Kingambit, and it messes with defensive foes like Clefable. More specifically, Taunt stops Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and Skarmory from setting hazards and prevents slower offensive threats like Dragonite and Adamant Gouging Fire from setting up. Alternatively, Encore is better at punishing naturally faster setup sweepers like Roaring Moon, Iron Defense Zamazenta, and Terastallized Volcarona looking for that one free turn of setup, and it can subsequently provide valuable switch-in and setup opportunities for an incoming teammate. Sacred Sword hits Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, and opposing Hisuian Samurott; cleanly OHKOes Weavile, Darkrai, and bulky Kingambit; dents Kyurem; and breaks IronPress Zamazenta's Substitute. Focus Sash guarantees at least one layer of Spikes can be set even against faster foes like Enamorus and Kyurem, as well as opposing leads like Ribombee. Tera Ghost is predominantly used to spinblock foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott's ability to set the pace for its team early-game makes it a perfect fit on hyper offense teams. Setup sweepers like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Gouging Fire, and Volcarona enjoy its Spikes putting foes into their KO range, especially against their checks like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Additionally, Gouging Fire can switch into and set up against Cinderace—which can use Court Change against Hisuian Samurott's Spikes—while Dragon Dance Roaring Moon and other Knock Off users like Bulk Up Great Tusk and Iron Valiant can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Dondozo, Galarian Slowking, and Gholdengo to make them vulnerable to Spikes. If not going for Knock Off, Great Tusk can also provide entry hazard removal for the team with Rapid Spin, since Hisuian Samurott will trigger lead Glimmora's Toxic Debris twice; pairing Hisuian Samurott with a grounded offensive Poison-type like Iron Moth can also mitigate this issue. In addition to enjoying Spikes, the aforementioned Iron Valiant and other Pokemon like Deoxys-S and Choice Scarf Enamorus are potent late-game cleaners that can notably pressure Great Tusk, preventing it from ever entering the field to use Rapid Spin. Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragapult are valuable teammates to naturally spinblock foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads; moreover, Gholdengo is adept at preventing other hazard removal attempts such as Corviknight's Defog and Glimmora's Mortal Spin, while Dragapult can deal with or revenge kill Zamazenta behind a Substitute, which uses Knock Off Hisuian Samurott as setup fodder. In return, they appreciate Spikes chipping down the likes of Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott is a great speed control option due to its ability to compress a number of roles in one slot. It can revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Cinderace and Dragapult while simultaneously setting up Spikes with Ceaseless Edge or pivoting into other teammates with Flip Turn. Razor Shell can make Hisuian Samurott more difficult to respond to due to its high chance to lower the enemy's Defense. However, Aqua Cutter can be used instead, as it is more accurate and does not make contact; this is useful against targets such as Rocky Helmet Landorus-T and Flame Body Volcarona. Knock Off complements Ceaseless Edge by removing items such as Rocky Helmet and Heavy-Duty Boots, making it more rewarding for Hisuian Samurott to use Ceaseless Edge later. Flip Turn allows Hisuian Samurott to pivot out of bad matchups against Clefable and Primarina while also dealing chip damage and generating momentum. However, Sacred Sword can be used to revenge kill various threats such as Kingambit, other Hisuian Samurott, and Kyurem. Hisuian Samurott is a mediocre Terastallization user, as its base typing is important to check threats such as Gholdengo and non-Low Kick Kingambit, and its partners will usually benefit from Terastallization more. Nonetheless, Hisuian Samurott can benefit from the damage increase that either Tera Water or Tera Dark provide to revenge kill a wider pool of Pokemon. Tera Water is useful to revenge kill offensive Great Tusk and Landorus-T more reliably, while Tera Dark allows Hisuian Samurott to OHKO defensive Galarian Slowking and Latias with Ceaseless Edge after Stealth Rock damage. Tera Ghost is another worthwhile consideration, as it allows Hisuian Samurott to block Rapid Spin from Great Tusk and Iron Treads.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott best fits on bulky offense teams, as it provides a great deal of utility between its defensive profile, ability to set up Spikes, Knock Off, and pivoting capabilities. Landorus-T is the perfect partner; it can form a potent pivoting core with Hisuian Samurott and provide Stealth Rock support while simultaneously benefiting from Hisuian Samurott's Spikes due to its ability to force switches with Intimidate and Rocky Helmet. Hisuian Samurott has a difficult time maintaining Spikes against entry hazard removers such as Corviknight and Great Tusk, as well as struggling against Fighting-types such as Zamazenta. Dragapult is thus a fantastic teammate; it matches up well against common switch-ins to Hisuian Samurott such as Corviknight and Skarmory and can block Rapid Spin from Great Tusk. Air Balloon Gholdengo is also an excellent partner, as it can prevent Defog from Corviknight, safely prevent Rapid Spin attempts from Great Tusk and Iron Treads, and check Fighting-types such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. In turn, Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge support makes Dragapult and Gholdengo more difficult to switch into due to wearing down their switch-ins such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu. Sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Gouging Fire, and Kingambit appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to lay down Spikes, as it makes it easier for them to clean late-game and break through checks such as Hatterene and Great Tusk. Future Sight support from Galarian Slowking is beneficial, as it makes it more difficult for Pokemon like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant to switch into Ceaseless Edge. Hisuian Samurott itself is quite vulnerable to being worn down by hazards, so anti-entry hazard support from Hatterene or Great Tusk is appreciated. While Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott is relatively fast, it is still prone to being outsped by various setup sweepers such as a boosted Volcarona, Iron Valiant, and Iron Boulder. Priority support from Rillaboom or Dragonite is therefore recommended to have additional insurance against these threats.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Hisuian Samurott is a Pokemon that, unlike other entry hazard setters, can offensively threaten teams while getting hazards up thanks to Sharpness-boosted Ceaseless Edge, allowing for more aggressive play and more opportunities to lay Spikes. Ceaseless Edge also lets it get Spikes up against Pokemon such as Hatterene and Taunt Deoxys-S. With Assault Vest, Hisuian Samurott is able to utilize its increased special bulk to check Pokemon like Heatran, Gholdengo, and Dragapult. Additionally, its decent defensive typing is useful for checking other threats like Weavile and Kingambit lacking Low Kick and Tera Blast Fairy. Razor Shell is generally the preferred Water-type STAB move due to its chance to lower Defense, but Aqua Cutter is a viable alternative due to it being non-contact and thus preventing chip damage from Rocky Helmet, which helps against Pokemon like Skarmory and Great Tusk. Aqua Jet gives Hisuian Samurott a priority move to pick off faster, weakened threats like Glimmora, Great Tusk, and Iron Boulder. Sucker Punch is another option for priority; it is not as reliable as Aqua Jet, but it is stronger and better at revenge killing Dragapult, Deoxys-S, and Raging Bolt. Knock Off punishes defensive Pokemon that can impede progress, removing items from foes such as Dondozo, Skarmory, and Primarina. Alternatively, Flip Turn can be used to preserve momentum and safely bring in threats like Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W. 84 Speed EVs let Hisuian Samurott outspeed uninvested Gliscor; the leftover EVs are put into HP to increase its overall bulk. Tera Poison is used to remove its weaknesses to Fighting, Fairy, and Grass so it can take attacks from Pokemon like Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Serperior.</p> <p>Assault Vest Hisuian Samurott fits best on entry hazard-stacking bulky offense teams that appreciate its offensive presence and ability to take special attacks. Gholdengo is an especially good teammate for Hisuian Samurott, since it blocks all hazard removal bar Court Change from Cinderace and has good matchups against Fairy- and Fighting-types that annoy Hisuian Samurott like Clefable and Zamazenta. In return, Hisuian Samurott soft checks Heatran and Volcarona lacking Bug Buzz and Giga Drain. Due to Hisuian Samurott's lack of reliable recovery, pairing it with Pokemon that have titanic special bulk or high longevity like Ting-Lu or Galarian Slowking is encouraged to cover special threats throughout the course of a game. Ting-Lu also has access to Stealth Rock, which, when paired with Spikes and Hisuian Samurott's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots, can rack up serious chip damage on the opposing team. Alternative Knock Off users such as Great Tusk, Rillaboom, and Clefable are good for removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon that never come in against Hisuian Samurott like Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and opposing Great Tusk. On top of being a premier pick for bulky offense teams, Great Tusk has the added perk of having access to Rapid Spin, removing hazards the opponent tries to set up so Hisuian Samurott can win the hazard war. Additionally, Rillaboom is able to provide Hisuian Samurott passive recovery thanks to Grassy Terrain. Volcarona is another valuable teammate for Hisuian Samurott, as it really appreciates its checks like Heatran, Primarina, and Raging Bolt getting chipped by Spikes repeatedly; in return, Volcarona is able to handle the Fairy- and Grass- types that give Hisuian Samurott a hard time, mainly Iron Valiant and Rillaboom. Other offensive teammates that appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to set Spikes include, but are not limited to, Kingambit, Kyurem, and Ogerpon-W.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Alomomola's gargantuan HP stat, good defensive typing, and access to Regenerator make it one of the best defensive pivots available. The combination of Wish, Regenerator, and Flip Turn makes it the premier Wish passer in OU, able to heal defensive teammates without reliable recovery like Dondozo and Ting-Lu. Scald bolsters Alomomola's defensive presence, with its burn chance threatening physical attackers such as Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Weavile, and Meowscarada. Flip Turn separates Alomomola from other bulky Water-types as a slow pivot, letting it bring in other Pokemon safely while creating momentum on the slower-paced teams it often finds itself on. A Relaxed nature with 0 Speed IVs ensures that Alomomola is as slow as possible for pivoting effectively. Tera Flying turns Alomomola's weakness to Grass into a resistance, letting it better take on Rillaboom. It also allows Alomomola to avoid Spikes damage if it loses its item to Knock Off, letting it act as a good Knock Off absorber. Tera Dark and Tera Steel are viable alternatives; the former lets Alomomola more capably check Hex Dragapult and the latter giving Alomomola a generally solid defensive typing to aid against Meowscarada and Fairy-types like Enamorus. These also let Alomomola act as a solid absorber of Future Sight from Galarian Slowking. Thanks to Alomomola's astounding HP stat, an EV spread with maximum Defense and Special Defense is solid, letting Alomomola capably take hits from special attackers such as Hex Dragapult and Choice Specs Enamorus. Meanwhile, a set with maximum HP and maximum Defense further strengthens Alomomola's monstrous physical bulk, becoming better suited to face the likes of Weavile, Iron Boulder, and Barraskewda. Rocky Helmet and Red Card can be run over Heavy-Duty Boots; the former further enhances Alomomola's role as a physical wall, letting it switch in and punish Pokemon like Weavile and Meowscarada for Triple Axel while also being able to wear down Kingambit, and the latter allows Alomomola act as a one-time phazer against setup sweepers like Gouging Fire, Kingambit, and Weavile.</p> <p>Alomomola performs best on balance and stall teams due to the sheer value of Wish for teammates that lack reliable recovery. Potent defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Heatran, and Great Tusk heavily appreciate Alomomola's gargantuan Wish to heal them reliably, as these walls often struggle to recover themselves after chip damage. Similarly, on stall, the likes of Dondozo and Clodsire appreciate Alomomola's Wish help them better deal with chip damage while also letting them preserve Rest and Recover PP, respectively. Additionally, they appreciate Alomomola's effectiveness as a pivot, as it can let them switch in without taking any damage thanks to its relatively low Speed. Special walls such as Blissey, Clodsire, and Skeledirge can cover Alomomola's weaker Special Defense, handling the likes of Volcarona, Iron Valiant, and Heatran. Other Pokemon with Regenerator such as Galarian Slowking and Tornadus-T can form potent Regenerator cores, making them difficult to wear down in the face of entry hazards. All of these Pokemon also appreciate Alomomola's capability to take Knock Off rather well. Alomomola is deathly afraid of Ogerpon-W because of Water Absorb. It can easily set up on and decimate Alomomola even after it Terastallizes. Thus, checks to Ogerpon-W such as Rillaboom and Zamazenta make for excellent partners. The former two also appreciate Alomomola's Wish supporting their otherwise shaky longevity. Amoonguss's access to Toxic lets Alomomola have an easier time chipping down and stalling out foes with Flip Turn and Wish, respectively. Offensive Pokemon such as Dragapult, Kyurem, Meowscarada, and Landorus-T appreciate Alomomola's slow pivoting and ability to pass large Wishes to assist with their longevity.</p>"

      "Offensive Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Volcarona is one of the tier's most potent setup sweepers due to its unique combination of Quiver Dance, excellent Special Attack and Speed that are bolstered further by powerful STAB and coverage moves, useful defensive typing, and Flame Body. Its typing notably grants it key resistances to attacks like Weavile's Triple Axel, Rillaboom's Grassy Glide, and Enamorus's and Iron Valiant's Moonblast, and Flame Body can potentially ruin the former two in addition to priority from Kingambit and Dragonite and revenge killing attempts from Iron Boulder and Barraskewda. Fiery Dance's perfect accuracy, higher PP, and chance to let Volcarona snowball with a lucky Special Attack boost or two make it an especially threatening move late-game, while Fire Blast boasts enough immediate power to outright OHKO bulky Kingambit at +1 and always OHKOes physically defensive Gliscor at +1 after Stealth Rock. Bug Buzz is Volcarona's strongest attack against Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Roaring Moon and bypasses Kyurem's Substitute; Giga Drain, on the other hand, offers useful super effective coverage against threats like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Primarina, and the recovery it provides can keep Volcarona healthy enough to continue sweeping late-game. Tera Blast greatly expands Volcarona's coverage depending on its Tera type of choice and makes Volcarona especially difficult to check due to its sheer unpredictability. Tera Ground grants Volcarona an Electric immunity to block Hatterene's Nuzzle, Clefable's Thunder Wave, and Raging Bolt's Thunderclap, and it allows Volcarona to OHKO threats like Iron Moth and Heatran outright, OHKO Gouging Fire and Raging Bolt after a Quiver Dance, and hit threats like Galarian Slowking and Toxapex super effectively. Tera Water still hits Fire-types like Cinderace and Heatran super effectively but also allows Volcarona to handle Great Tusk, Gliscor, opposing Volcarona, and Ting-Lu more effectively; it also provides a solid defensive typing that allows Volcarona to survive Barraskewda's rain-boosted Liquidation and, if it's healthy enough, Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel. Tera Fairy grants Volcarona a strong defensive typing with both a Dragon immunity and crucial coverage against Dragon-types like Dragapult, Raging Bolt, Walking Wake, and Dragonite while maintaining super effective coverage against Great Tusk and Zamazenta. However, Volcarona is among the best users of Terastallization in the tier and as such has immense versatility in its Tera options. Tera Dragon maintains important coverage against Dragon-types, notably also hitting Gouging Fire super effectively, while providing Volcarona with perfect neutral coverage alongside Giga Drain and resistances to Fire- and Water-type attacks; Tera Grass alongside both Bug Buzz and Giga Drain gives Volcarona a more favorable matchup against Water-types and makes Volcarona less-reliant on Terastallizing to sweep; Tera Psychic alongside Psychic fits well on Psychic Terrain teams as a means to break past Clodsire and Toxapex with ease; Tera Rock alongside Tera Blast hits Dragonite, Pelipper, and Gouging Fire super effectively and crucially OHKOes opposing Volcarona; Tera Bug allows Volcarona's Bug Buzz to 2HKO Ting-Lu the majority of the time with no prior boosts; lastly, Tera Fire is a situational option on sun teams to allow Volcarona's Fire Blast to reach high enough levels of power to outright OHKO Kyurem after a Quiver Dance while OHKOing Dragapult after a Quiver Dance and sun active and even outright 2HKOing Dondozo with a sun boost.</p> <p>Because it faces limited competition as a fast, specially offensive setup sweeper, Volcarona is quite easy to fit onto most hyper offense teams that operate at a similarly breakneck pace. Deoxys-S is an excellent teammate for Volcarona; it can serve as a fast dual screens setter or a fast and reliable entry hazard setter to support Volcarona's sweep, or it can function as a standalone offensive threat that can clean up late-game should Volcarona manage to wear down or even eliminate threats like Gholdengo and Kingambit. Other entry hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott and Glimmora can also provide entry hazard support to help Volcarona secure a KO against Dragapult, while other dual screens setters like Alolan Ninetales can support Volcarona by giving it more opportunities to safely set up a Quiver Dance or even giving it enough bulk to set up multiple Quiver Dances and decimate offensive teams. Volcarona forms a potent offensive core with various Dragon Dance sweepers, such as Roaring Moon, Gouging Fire, Kyurem, and Dragonite, which all appreciate Volcarona's ability to use physical walls like Skarmory as setup fodder while checking Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Roaring Moon forces out Galarian Slowking, which otherwise gives Tera Fairy variants a lot of trouble, and it can fall back on Tera Flying when Terastallizing Volcarona is not ideal; Gouging Fire and Volcarona can overwhelm their shared Fire-resistant checks like Primarina and Alomomola to wallbreak for one-another; Kyurem's powerful Ice STAB can handle opposing Dragon-types, allowing Volcarona to run different Tera types like Water and Ground; Dragonite's powerful Extreme Speed acts as insurance against revenge killers like Swift Swim Barraskewda and weakened Booster Energy Iron Boulder, and it especially appreciates Volcarona's ability to force Skarmory and Corviknight out so that it is no longer forced to run Fire Punch. Kingambit makes for a stellar teammate, as its immunity to both of Galarian Slowking's STAB moves complements Volcarona's ability to deter Fighting-types like Zamazenta, and its strong Sucker Punch acts as good insurance against Booster Energy Iron Boulder, which otherwise outspeeds Volcarona and effortlessly OHKOes it with Mighty Cleave. Lastly, Volcarona fits well on Psychic Terrain teams facilitated by Indeedee; although the prospect of a Tera Psychic and Terrain-boosted Psychic ripping through threats like Toxapex and Clodsire, which can completely counter many other Volcarona variants, is quite appealing, Volcarona still benefits from Psychic Terrain's protection against Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed regardless of Volcarona's Tera type of choice. Psychic Terrain also helps to further facilitate threats Volcarona already synergizes well with, such as Expanding Force Deoxys-S and Dragon Dance users like Roaring Moon and Gouging Fire.</p>"

      "Bulky Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Volcarona makes great use of Quiver Dance and its solid defensive profile, checking Pokemon like Weavile, Meowscarada, and Iron Valiant, and it combines them with its decent longevity bolstered by Morning Sun to force switches and gain free opportunities to set up and sweep. The occasional Special Attack raises provided by Fiery Dance can add to Volcarona’s boosts and increase its sweeping potential, while Flamethrower is a more consistent and powerful alternative with more PP to assist in the long run. Tera Blast can be used as a surprise coverage move after Terastillizing but can also be used as a neutral move before Terastillizing for Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Gouging Fire. Tera Dragon gives Volcarona several powerful resistances, such as to Water, which helps against Barraskewda and rain, and Fire, which helps against Cinderace and opposing Volcarona; it also gives it a Tera Blast that hits most Pokemon neutrally and threatens Dragon-types like Kyurem, Dragonite, and Gouging Fire. Tera Fairy, in addition to being a solid defensive typing that also threatens Dragon-types, gives Volcarona a Dragon immunity to avoid attacks from Dragapult and Raging Bolt and resist Sucker Punch from Kingambit, as well as a way to solidly damage Ting-Lu. Tera Water is a powerful defensive option that gives Volcarona a threatening attack against the likes of Heatran and opposing Volcarona and a strong matchup against rain teams. Alternative Tera options are Ground, to improve Volcarona's matchup against Fire-types like Heatran and Poison-types like Clodsire, Toxapex, and Galarian Slowking and give it an immunity to Thunder Wave, and Grass, which is strong against bulky Water-types like Primarina and Hisuian Samurott. This set should run Giga Drain instead of Tera Blast for added longevity. Heavy-Duty Boots is a must-have for Volcarona to cover for its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. 152 Speed EVs allow Volcarona to outspeed Great Tusk and Gholdengo as well as Zamazenta and Dragapult after a boost from Quiver Dance, while the remaining EVs are invested into HP and Defense to make Volcarona bulky enough to survive attacks from Pokemon like Raging Bolt, Enamorus, and Meowscarada that it otherwise couldn’t.</p> <p>Volcarona’s ability to set up and sweep is always useful for helping teams make progress, but bulky Volcarona specifically is able to help its team by checking physical attackers throughout the game. Flame Body can cripple attackers like Kingambit and Dragonite on the switch in and can force them out from fear of being burned. This opens up teammates like Kyurem and Walking Wake to play more aggressively. Entry hazard setters like Glimmora and Great Tusk also appreciate Volcarona's ability to threaten Pokemon that try to use Rapid Spin with a burn. Dual screen setters like Deoxys-S and Alolan Ninetales are able to boost Volcarona's defenses significantly, giving it more opportunities to set up and sweep. Volcarona is also useful on sun teams, supporting Pokemon like Roaring Moon and Walking Wake with boosted Fire-type attacks as well as helping defensively against rain teams with Tera Water and picking off Deoxys-S and Iron Valiant with a sun-boosted Flamethrower. Volcarona is unable to make progress against special walls like Clodsire and Blissey; a Pokemon like Gholdengo are able to assist with Psyshock and immunity to moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave. Powerful physical cleaners like Weavile and Choice Band Meowscara are also useful for this purpose and synergize well with Volcarona. Other Unaware walls like Dondozo are also unaffected by Volcarona’s sweeping potential; wearing these threats down with hazards from Pokemon like Gliscor and Hisuian Samurott is extremely important in helping Volcarona sweep late-game. Weavile, Hisuian Samurott, and Meowscarda also help against Dondozo with Knock Off, discarding its Heavy-Duty Boots so that it can be worn down by entry hazards. Galarian Slowking is particularly difficult for Volcarona to deal with, especially if it's running Tera Fairy; powerful Pokemon that match up well against it like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Dragonite are important to chip it down and force it out.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>When using Choice Specs, Kyurem becomes a devastating wallbreaker thanks to its great offensive typing alongside its naturally sky-high Special Attack. Freeze Dry helps Kyurem in dealing with bulky Water-types like Toxapex, Dondozo, and common Tera Water users such as Gliscor and Galarian Slowking. Earth Power finds itself in the last slot, allowing Kyurem to hit Galarian Slowking hard as well as Pokemon that resist its STAB moves, examples being Heatran, Kingambit, and Gholdengo. Tera Ice provides the most amount of damage possible to its Ice-type STAB moves, which can potentially OHKO naturally high specially defensive behemoths like Clodsire and Toxapex with Ice Beam and Freeze Dry, respectively, as well as 2HKO offensive Gholdengo and Kingambit with Ice Beam. Meanwhile, Tera Ground can be used to boost up Earth Power, having a chance to OHKO bulky variants of Kingambit and Gholdengo, as well as provide a Rock resistance, which lets it take on Stealth Rock and the dangerous Iron Boulder's Mighty Cleave more easily. Finally, Tera Fairy provides Kyurem with an immunity to Dragon-type attacks such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and opposing Kyurem's Draco Meteor, coupled with a newfound Fighting resistance against moves like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta's Close Combat and Corviknight and Skarmory's Body Press.</p> <p>Kyurem often founds itself in bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to destroy common walls. While Kyurem's typing is amazing offensively, defensively it makes Kyurem hard to switch in due to its numerous weaknesses combined with its average Speed tier. To solve this, pair Kyurem with pivot users; Kyurem's best friend is Galarian Slowking, which brings Kyurem in safely and provides snow with Chilly Reception as well as switch into Fairy-types like Enamorus and Iron Valiant. Kyurem needs entry hazard removal to not get worn down quickly by hazard-stacking teams; therefore, Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk and Excadrill are great partners. Corviknight can take Fairy- and Dragon-type moves, clear out hazards with Defog, and provides a slow U-turn to get Kyurem in safely. Additionally, Cinderace can use Court Change to use the hazards against the opposing team and can also lure in and pivot out of checks such as Toxapex and Gliscor with U-turn for Kyurem. Hatterene is also a good partner for Kyurem, which can deflect hazards with Magic Bounce, slow down faster threats with Nuzzle, and give Kyurem a second chance at wallbreaking with Healing Wish. Physical attackers like Meowscarada can be used to scare away common special walls thanks to its crippling STAB Knock Off to make Kyurem's attacks more impactful. Another strong physical attacker is Kingambit, which threaten some of Kyurem's checks like Galarian Slowking, Clodsire, and specially defensive Clefable. In return, Kyurem can break past their defensive checks such as Skarmory, Dondozo, and Great Tusk. Gholdengo makes for an amazing partner, as it can switch into super effective moves aimed at Kyurem and threaten Galarian Slowking and Fairy-types with its STAB moves; in return, Kyurem beats Unaware Clodsire for it. Kyurem can take advantage of hazard-stacking teams to be even harder to wall, so common hazard setters like Skarmory, Ting Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Gliscor can be helpful, with the latter two having Knock Off on their arsenal as well to cripple Kyurem's defensive checks.</p>"
      },
      "Heavy-Duty Boots": {
        "description": "<p>Heavy-Duty Boots Kyurem is an incredibly powerful Pokemon with very few switch-ins, leveraging its hefty natural bulk and monstrous offensive stats to threaten a large portion of the tier with its perfect coverage. Both Ice Beam and Freeze-Dry are fantastic STAB options, with the raw power of Ice Beam supplemented by Freeze-Dry's super effective coverage into bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Dondozo. Earth Power is a great coverage move that allows Kyurem to hit common switch-ins like Galarian Slowking, Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Heatran, and Draco Meteor rounds out the set with a powerful nuke that tears through neutral targets like Darkrai, Deoxys-S, and Terastallized Ting-Lu while securing a notable OHKO on Gouging Fire. Scale Shot is a weaker alternative that boosts Kyurem's Speed to patch up its middling Speed tier and thwart revenge killing attempts by otherwise faster Pokemon such as Dragapult and Zamazenta. It also targets special walls like Blissey on their frailer Defense and hits Volcarona hard to prevent it from using Kyurem as setup fodder. A Naive nature is selected for a mixed set with Scale Shot in order to still survive Iron Boulder's Mighty Cleave from full HP. A Hasty nature can also be considered for a better matchup into Volcarona and to avoid an OHKO from Iron Valiant's Moonblast. Tera Ice synergizes with Kyurem's double Ice-type STAB attacks to blast holes through teams, allowing it to 2HKO both physically defensive Clefable and Corviknight with Ice Beam. Tera Ground can be used instead to change Kyurem's defensive profile entirely while giving it a STAB boost to Earth Power, securing crucial 2HKOs on both Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge along with dropping offensive Gholdengo in a single hit. Additionally, both Tera types drop Kyurem's weaknesses to Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon like Dragapult and Enamorus, with Tera Ground also removing its Fighting- and Rock-type weaknesses to block revenge killing attempts from Zamazenta and Iron Boulder.</p> <p>Kyurem is a perfect fit for entry hazard-stacking teams that opt to neglect removal in favor of putting hazards up on both sides, as Heavy-Duty Boots allows Kyurem to switch in freely, and its lack of power from no boosting item is made up for by switch-ins being forced to take chip damage on entry. Good defensive hazard setters that pair well with Kyurem include Skarmory and Gliscor with their Steel- and Fighting-type resistances, respectively. Faster teammates are also appreciated to help cover for Kyurem's mediocre Speed, with fast Knock Off users such as Meowscarada and Weavile being great picks for balance teams and Iron Boulder as a good pairing on more offensive builds. Another partner that works particularly well is Knock Off Clefable, which switches into Dragon- and Fighting-type attacks from Dragapult and Zamazenta and invites in Kyurem's defensive checks like Galarian Slowking, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Air Balloon Heatran to remove their items, making them more susceptible to chip damage and allowing Kyurem to hit the latter two with Earth Power. Galarian Slowking itself is a bulky pivot that has great synergy with Kyurem, as it stifles revenge killing attempts with Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks from checks like Iron Valiant and Enamorus, and it can not only can bring in Kyurem freely with Chilly Reception but also sets up snow to make it significantly harder to revenge kill. Offensively, Kyurem pairs well with threats that can force in walls weak to it such as Gliscor, Skarmory, and Great Tusk, making Kingambit a natural partner.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Kyurem is an effective setup sweeper with great bulk and two strong physical STAB moves in Loaded Dice-boosted Icicle Spear and Scale Shot, capable of outspeeding would-be revenge killers such as Dragapult and Booster Energy Great Tusk after a single boost. Tera Blast Ground gives Kyurem the coveted near-unresisted Ice + Ground STAB combination. This allows Kyurem to break past otherwise troubling Pokemon like Gholdengo and Kingambit. Tera Blast Fire is another option to similarly hit the Steel-types super effectively, matching up better against Skarmory and Air Balloon variants of Gholdengo and Kingambit at the cost of unable to hit Heatran. Additionally, Tera Fire grants Kyurem a Steel and Fire resistance, letting it set up on Gholdengo, Cinderace, and Volcarona and prevents it from being revenge killed by Scizor easily. Substitute is an alternative option over Tera Blast that relies less on Terastallization, allowing Kyurem to dodge status moves and to scout potential switches or Terastallization. Tera Fairy is a more defensive choice, trading its Dragon and Fighting weaknesses for an immunity and a resistance, allowing Kyurem to safely take a hit from Pokemon like Dragapult and Iron Valiant to OHKO them back with Icicle Spear. Tera Steel enables Kyurem to easily take moves like Make It Rain from Gholdengo and Mighty Cleave from Iron Boulder while being able to avoid Toxic from the likes of Toxapex.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Kyurem is best used on offensive teams that appreciate a strong physical setup sweeper that can muscle past the bulky Ground- and Dragon-types of the tier. It is one of the few setup sweepers that immediately threatens Gliscor and provides a way for hyper offense to resist the priority from Raging Bolt and KO it. Kyurem wants a teammate to provide some form of entry hazard control like Great Tusk, as Kyurem is weak to Stealth Rock and needs Loaded Dice to output consistent damage. It appreciates the support of Spikes from setters like Deoxys-S and Hisuian Samurott, as most of its checks are bulky grounded Pokemon. For example, one layer of Spikes allows Kyurem to OHKO maximum HP Great Tusk and offensive Zamazenta without an Intrepid Shield boost at +1 and +2, respectively. Kyurem greatly enjoys snow from Alolan Ninetales's Snow Warning, as the Defense boost helps greatly in positioning Kyurem to get the free turns that it needs. Alolan Ninetales can also set up Aurora Veil to further ease Kyurem's setup. Bulky Steel-types like Heatran, Kingambit, and Gholdengo all give Kyurem trouble unless it is Tera Ground and willing to commit the Tera, so teammates like Tera Ground Volcarona and Knock Off Iron Valiant help to pressure these foes. Bulky Water-types like Dondozo and Primarina can also consistently beat Kyurem one-on-one, so offensive Grass-types like Rillaboom and Meowscarada can be used to threaten them out. These also provide tools like Grassy Terrain to keep Kyurem healthy as it sets up and Knock Off to remove defensive items from Pokemon like Corviknight and Zamazenta. Other strong physical attackers like Gouging Fire can help to force in and wear down the Water-types that Kyurem struggles with. Very fast offensive Pokemon like Booster Energy Iron Boulder and Iron Valiant can outspeed even a +1 Kyurem and threaten huge damage with their super effective STAB moves. Because of this, Kyurem appreciates Pokemon like Gholdengo that can take hits from those fast threats and continue to apply offensive pressure.</p>"

    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Hoopa-U is an extremely strong physical wallbreaker that can be very threatening to more balanced and defensive teams due to its massive Attack stat and reliable STAB move in Hyperspace Fury, which is capable of impressive feats such as 2HKOing physically defensive Corviknight and Toxapex the majority of the time and always 2HKOing physically defensive Rotom-W. Zen Headbutt is a nice complementary STAB move, allowing Hoopa-U to smack prominent Fighting-types like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Iron Valiant that may try to switch in on a predicted Hyperspace Fury. Drain Punch hits Dark-types like Kingambit and Ting-Lu, while Gunk Shot offers coverage against Fairy-types like Enamorus and Azumarill, as well as Tera Fairy Moltres, Garganacl, Kingambit, and Baxcalibur. A Jolly nature allows Hoopa-U to outspeed Pokemon like Timid Heatran, Modest Gholdengo, and Timid Volcanion, while an Adamant nature allows Hoopa-U to hit even harder, 2HKOing Garganacl the majority of the time. Tera Dark boosts the power of Hyperspace Fury even further, 2HKOing physically defensive Dondozo; Tera Dark also offers the additional benefit of making Hoopa-U resist other Dark-type attacks, which can be crucial against Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Hoopa-U fits well on bulky offense teams that are in need of a physical wallbreaker. Physical setup sweepers like Kingambit, Baxcalibur, and Dragonite appreciate Hoopa-U's presence on a team, as Hoopa-U is able to break through or dent physically defensive Pokemon that could stand in their way, like Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Rotom-W. One of Hoopa-U's biggest challenges is safely getting on the field due to its frail physical defense and quadruple weakness to U-turn, so it pairs well with pivots such as Chilly Reception Galarian Slowking, U-turn Dragapult, and Volt Switch Zapdos. Hoopa-U is also held back by its middling Speed, which tends to exacerbate Hoopa-U's physical frailty, so it appreciates paralysis support from partners like Rotom-W and Substitute Dragapult. Static Zapdos is a particularly notable partner for Hoopa-U, because it is able to switch in and potentially paralyze faster Pokemon like Cinderace and Dragapult, rendering those Pokemon no longer threatening to Hoopa-U. Pokemon that can set entry hazards like Ting-Lu, Heatran, and Landorus-T help facilitate with Hoopa-U breaking through its switch-ins. Opposing physical Dark-types, such as Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, and Roaring Moon, typically force Hoopa-U out, especially after a Defense drop. For this reason, sturdy Dark-resistant teammates like Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Low Kick Kingambit synergize well with Hoopa-U, while those Pokemon also appreciate Hoopa-U punching holes in the opposing team's defensive backbone.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Hoopa-U is an incredibly threatening special wallbreaker, especially to slower and more defensive teams, that is able to OHKO the majority of the tier and 2HKO essentially every other relevant Pokemon. This is thanks to Hoopa-U's astronomically high Special Attack stat and potent dual STAB combination. Focus Blast rounds out its coverage, allowing Hoopa-U to hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Hisuian Samurott; Focus Blast also OHKOes specially defensive Heatran after entry hazard chip. Trick can be run in the fourth slot to cripple the few special walls that Hoopa-U is unable to reliably blast through, like Blissey, Scream Tail, and Alolan Muk, while also affording Hoopa-U the ability to switch moves, alleviating the need for prediction in exchange for less immediate power. Alternatively, Thunderbolt can be used instead as Hoopa-U's best option to hit Corviknight and Galarian Moltres while also providing a more reliable option than Focus Blast to OHKO Hisuian Samurott and Greninja. A Timid nature makes Hoopa-U faster than Pokemon like Timid Heatran, Modest Gholdengo, and Timid Volcanion, while a Modest nature gives Hoopa-U even more breaking power so that it is able to potentially 2HKO Blissey and Alolan Muk with Focus Blast after entry hazard damage. Tera Dark increases the power of Dark Pulse, giving it an opportunity to 2HKO Scream Tail and specially defensive Heatran while also threatening to OHKO Baxcalibur, bulky Cinderace, and defensive Landorus-T. Tera Dark also makes Hoopa-U resist Dark-type attacks, which can prevent Kingambit from answering it with Sucker Punch. Quick special attackers like Choice Specs Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus make good teammates, as they appreciate Hoopa-U's ability to break through even the bulkiest of specially defensive walls. One of Hoopa-U's biggest flaws is that its physical frailty and crippling 4x weakness to U-turn can make it difficult for it to safely be brought onto the field. As a result, Hoopa-U greatly benefits from being paired alongside pivots that can facilitate its entry, like Galarian Slowking with Chilly Reception; Landorus-T, Dragapult, and Sneasler with U-turn; and Rotom-W and Zapdos with Volt Switch. Paralysis support from Thunder Wave users like Rotom-W, Substitute Dragapult, and defensive Gholdengo can help alleviate Hoopa-U's lackluster Speed and make previously faster threats easy targets. Static Zapdos synergizes particularly well with Hoopa-U in this regard, since Zapdos can punish U-turns directed at Hoopa-U from faster Pokemon like Cinderace, Sneasler, and Meowscarada to potentially paralyze them. Hoopa-U also appreciates the inclusion of hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott, Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, and Heatran, allowing it to punch holes in defensive backbones more easily and damage the opposing team thanks to the switches it forces. Some of the most difficult Pokemon for Hoopa-U to handle are opposing Dark-types like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Ting-Lu, and Hisuian Samurott because they can force Hoopa-U to rely on Focus Blast and good prediction to break through. To help mitigate this issue, Pokemon that can reliably switch into Dark-types like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Azumarill also make good partners for Hoopa-U, and in return they appreciate Choice Specs Hoopa-U's ability to threaten physical walls as well. Bulk Up Great Tusk and Belly Drum Azumarill can also clean up late-game after Hoopa-U wears down the opposing team.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Equipping Hoopa-U with an Assault Vest makes the most of its excellent coverage and surprisingly high special bulk, letting it trade with various special attackers like Dragapult and Walking Wake. Strong Knock Off is a large reason to use this set, as it is an excellent progress maker, particularly against bulkier teams. Psychic is run over Zen Headbutt for its higher accuracy and better damage against physically defensive Pokemon like Zapdos and Great Tusk. Drain Punch provides Hoopa-U with adequate recovery and logevity, and it is largely used to hit Kingambit and other Dark-types, which otherwise walls this set. Gunk Shot provides important coverage for Fairy-types like Enamorus and Tera Fairy foes like Garganacl while potentially poisoning checks like Ting Lu. Tera Poison not only empowers its Gunk Shot but also gives it a crucial Fairy and U-turn resistance. 248 HP and 40 Defense investment with a Lonely Nature allows Hoopa-U to survive one Sucker Punch from Adamant Kingambit with a maximum Supreme Overlord boost and gives it an easier time against weaker physical attacks from Pokemon like Garganacl and Clodsire. Meanwhile, 84 SpA EVs give Hoopa-U a guaranteed OHKO on Iron Moth with Psychic and 92 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Jolly Kingambit. Hoopa-U is best utilized on bulky offense teams that can support a slow, powerful wallbreaker like it while still appreciating its ability to trade hits with common special attackers. It is incredibly physically frail, so pairing it with physically bulky Pokemon like Garganacl and Great Tusk is a good idea, as it will often be forced out by physical attackers. Additionally, pivot support from Cinderace and Zapdos can put Hoopa-U in favorable positions to dish out damage with its strong attacks, something that is necessary given its aforementioned physical frailty. Because Hoopa-U often makes great progress with Knock Off, entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T are great teammate options. Hoopa-U excels at punching holes in the opposition, so faster offensive teammates like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus are good ideas to take advantage of the resultant weakened foes. Teammates like Amoonguss and Galarian Slowking also deserve consideration for checking Iron Valiant and Enamorus without having to expend Terastallization.</p>"

      "Utility Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>Volcanion's high Special Attack and great offensive typing make it an excellent wallbreaker with solid defensive utility thanks to Water Absorb. Good coverage options as well as a powerful STAB move that can burn its foes make it very difficult to switch into. Earth Power is crucial for hitting Toxapex, which easily switches into both of Volcanion's STAB moves; it also hits Galarian Slowking harder, notably guaranteeing a 2HKO on physically defensive variants. Taunt is useful against bulkier Pokemon, preventing Dondozo or Toxapex from using healing moves and Galarian Slowking from using Thunder Wave. Substitute eases prediction, as Volcanion can force switches, and it takes advantage of certain Pokemon that fail to break the Substitute such as bulky Cinderace and non-Assault Vest Toxapex while still avoiding status attempts from the aforementioned walls. It also allows Volcanion to avoid Sucker Punch from Kingambit. Tera Blast alongside Tera Fairy can be used to hit Pokemon such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Hisuian Samurott. Becoming a Fairy-type offers useful defensive utility, giving it an immunity to both of Walking Wake's STAB moves and a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Tera Ground can be used to grant Volcanion an Electric immunity, improving its matching against Zapdows and Rotom-W, while also boosting Earth Power's damage. Both Tera types also neutralize its weakness to Earthquake from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Great Tusk. 140 Speed EVs are used to outspeed uninvested Great Tusk. Volcanion fits on bulky offense teams that appreciate a strong wallbreaker. Entry hazards, especially Spikes, make Volcanion much harder to deal with. Therefore, hazard setters including Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T make good partners. Ting-Lu can also switch into special attackers like Dragapult and Zapdos for Volcanion. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking cause problems for Volcanion, so teammates that can help overwhelm them such as Nasty Plot Gholdengo and Utility Dragapult are also useful. Finally, Swords Dance Iron Valiant and Kingambit can clean late-game once Volcanion has worn down the opposing team, and they also pressure the aforementioned specially defensive Pokemon. Kingambit in particular appreciates Volcanion's ability to deal with Fire-types like Cinderace and Moltres, and especially its immunity to Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Volcanion is a wallbreaker with absurd strength thanks to its sky high Special Attack and amazing high-Base Power moves, allowing it to make progress every time it is in. Steam Eruption is Volcanion's most spammable move and has very limited switch-ins, as many Pokemon that resist both of Volcanion's STAB moves like Dragapult, Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Hisuian Samurott end up getting 2HKOed or burned. Fire Blast is Volcanion's best move for Grass-types such as Meowscarada, Amoonguss, and Tera Grass Galarian Slowking. Earth Power helps immensely with Toxapex, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking. Sludge Bomb hits Azumarill and Tera Grass Heatran while crippling foes like Rotom-W more than burn, while Tera Blast Fairy can hit many Dragon types such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon as well as Pokemon like Assault Vest Hisuian Samurott. Tera Fairy also makes Volcanion immune to Dragon-type moves, negating both of Walking Wake's STAB types, and removes all of Volcanion's weaknesses, particularly to Ground-type attacks such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu and Landorus-T's Earthquake. Tera Fairy also allows Volcanion to resist Kingambit's Sucker Punch, making it a great revenge killing option. Tera Water and Tera Fire make Steam Eruption and Fire Blast even stronger, allowing Volcanion to muscle through Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and even 2HKO physically defensive Toxapex. Its main counters are Tera Water Galarian Slowking and Water Absorb or Tera Water Clodsire, alongside Blissey. Volcanion appreciates support from wallbreakers that can deal with these threats or wear them down, such as Black Glasses Kingambit and mixed Iron Valiant. Kingambit in particular loves Choice Specs Volcanion's matchup against Fire-types like Cinderace, Moltres, and Heatran. In turn, Kingambit has a good matchup versus the aforementioned counters and can help pressure other checks such as Toxapex. Dragapult can also be a great partner, as it provides pivoting and speed control along with adding pressure on said counters and checks and has the option to provide great support with Thunder Wave. Great Tusk is another great option, as it can provide hazard removal, which is crucial for Volcanion. It is also a great blanket check for physical attackers that threaten Volcanion, and it provides Knock Off support, making it one of the best defensive partners for Volcanion. Volcanion also fits great on VoltTurn teams, as it loves being brought in as many times as possible by Pokemon such as Cinderace, Dragapult, and Rotom-W.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thanks to a great typing and solid overall bulk, Primarina is one of the most dangerous set up sweepers in OU, capable of checking and setting up on offensive Pokemon like Zamazenta, Weavile, and Walking Wake. Calm Mind makes Primarina able to threaten the opposing team while also making itself harder to KO for potential revenge killers like Iron Valiant, Kyurem, and Enamorus. Psychic Noise can be used in combination with Liquid Voice to cripple defensive switch-ins that would be able to beat it one-on-one, such as Dondozo, Unaware Clefable, and Clodsire. Surf is also an option to put more pressure on offensive teams due to it's higher Base Power while being run with Torrent, which can power it up in a pinch. It notably is useful against Gholdengo and Gouging Fire as well as threatening the 2HKO on bulky Kingambit after a Calm Mind. Substitute prevents Primarina from being affected by status moves such as Thunder Wave from Clefable and Toxic from Clodsire. It also punishes switches that Primarina forces and allows it to scout opposing Pokemon. Substitute is also useful to avoid being revenge killed by Rillaboom and Meowscarada while blocking Trick from Pokemon like Choice Scarf Gholdengo. It is also a safe way to bring Primarina to Torrent range. This EV spread ensures that it outspeeds uninvested Clefable and avoids the 2HKO from Protosynthesis-boosted Choice Specs Walking Wake's Hydro Steam under sun. Both Tera Poison and Steel flip the matchup against Grass-types like Meowscarada, Serperior, and Rillaboom while also turning the tables on Galarian Slowking. With Tera Steel, Primarina resists Gholdengo's Make it Rain and can beat it one-on-one. It can also absorb Galarian Slowking's Future Sight and Choice Specs Kyurem's Freeze-Dry as well as being able to set up on Hatterene and Clefable. With Tera Poison, Primarina gains a great neutral typing against threats like Iron Moth and Giga Drain Volcarona while preserving its resistance to Fighting-type attacks from Zamazenta and Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Primarina fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate the natural defensive utility that Primarina brings to the table while also being a threatening sweeper itself. Primarina can support teammates such as Weavile, Rillaboom, and Great Tusk by switching in on Zamazenta, Weavile, and Walking Wake. Rillaboom is particulary good, as Primarina covers threats to it like Volcarona, Cinderace, and Skeledirge while appreciating the extra healing of Grassy Terrain. Great Tusk, Rillaboom, and Weavile can threaten Pokemon that would otherwise be annoying for Primarina, such as Galarian Slowking, Ogerpon-W, and Serperior, respectively. Due to Primarina's lack of reliable recovery, it struggles against entry hazards, especially hazard stacking teams. The aforementioned Great Tusk helps it by removing them with Rapid Spin while also being a switch-in to Kingambit that can threaten a weakened Primarina out. Pokemon like Ogerpon-W, Rillaboom, and Serperior can safely switch into Primarina and threaten it with powerful attacks, forcing it to Terastallize or switch out; Pokemon that can switch in on these threats like Kingambit, Rillaboom, Skarmory, and Corviknight make for great teammates. Kingambit is also a huge help, as it beats one of the most common checks to Primarina in Galarian Slowking while appreciating Primarina's ability to safely switch in and beat Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Skarmory.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With its combination of power, strong priority, solid bulk, and excellent support through Grassy Terrain, Rillaboom is a premier wallbreaker and revenge killer in OU. Grassy Glide allows Rillaboom to revenge kill faster Pokemon like Iron Boulder, Great Tusk, and Barraskewda while also denying lead Deoxys-S and Hisuian Samurott from getting two turns to set entry hazards. Wood Hammer is an excellent tool for breaking through even resistant Pokemon, being able to 2HKO Raging Bolt and Kingambit after Stealth Rock while OHKOing Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Hatterene. U-turn makes Rillaboom a pivot while also being the strongest option against other Rillaboom, Roaring Moon if lacking Drain Punch, and Hydrapple. Knock Off removes items from Rillaboom's checks, including Dragonite, Skarmory, and Volcarona, while also being the best option to hit Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Galarian Slowking. Drain Punch is an alternative that OHKOes Kingambit and hits Heatran and Kyurem switching in while increasing Rillaboom's longevity. An Adamant nature is preferred for its power boost; however, a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed opposing Adamant Rillaboom and Gholdengo without Choice Scarf at the cost of being unable to always OHKO Pokemon like Dondozo and Galarian Slowking with Wood Hammer and Knock Off. An alternative EV spread of 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe can be used alongside an Adamant nature to outspeed Gliscor while allowing Rillaboom to survive hits such as Life Orb Deoxys-S's Psycho Boost, Ogerpon-W's +2 Power Whip, and Tornadus-T's Bleakwind Storm; however, it notably worsens Rillaboom's matchup against opposing Rillaboom and Raging Bolt due to being outsped. Tera Grass powers up Rillaboom's Grass-type moves, allowing Grassy Glide to OHKO Darkrai, Ogerpon-W, and Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock and Wood Hammer to OHKO Clefable, Toxapex, and Gliscor after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Bulk Up Great Tusk can take advantage of Grassy Terrain's recovery while removing entry hazards for Rillaboom with Rapid Spin, as Rillaboom is prone to hazard damage. Hawlucha is another one of Rillaboom's biggest beneficiaries, using Grassy Seed and Unburden to become an excellent sweeper with nearly unmatched Speed. In return, Rillaboom breaks open bulky teams for Hawlucha and Great Tusk and removes Rocky Helmet and Heavy-Duty Boots from walls like Skarmory, Corviknight, and Terastallized Dondozo. Bulky Ground-weak Pokemon, including Kingambit, Raging Bolt, Gouging Fire, and Heatran, appreciate Grassy Terrain nullifying their weakness to Earthquake from Pokemon like Gliscor and Ting-Lu while providing extra passive recovery. Kingambit can form a dual priority core with Rillaboom, notably revenge killing Grass-resistant Pokemon like Dragapult and Gholdengo while any attempts to stall out its Sucker Punch give an extra turn of recovery from Grassy Terrain. Raging Bolt is another excellent priority user and wallbreaker that additionally enjoys Rillaboom's U-turn bringing it on checks like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Volcarona. Gouging Fire and Heatran can also come in on Rillaboom's checks like Cinderace, Volcarona, and Skarmory; if Volcarona uses Tera Blast Ground or Water to knock them out, it will cease to be a Rillaboom check, allowing Rillaboom to revenge kill it with Grassy Glide. Iron Defense Zamazenta is an excellent teammate, as Rillaboom breaks and overwhelms walls like Dondozo and Skarmory that would get in the way of its sweep, and the extra longevity from Grassy Terrain is amazing to keep Zamazenta healthy, as it lacks any reliable ways to heal outside of Leftovers. Hatterene and Comfey can become potent sweepers when used with Rillaboom, both being able to run Grassy Seed while the extra longevity allows Hatterene to keep hazards off more consistenly with Magic Bounce. Grassy Seed allows Hatterene and Comfey to set up on physical attackers that can no longer 2HKO them like Heavy Slam Zamazenta, Ogerpon-W, and Great Tusk while giving an appreciated boost to their Stored Power. Ursaluna and Rillaboom form a terrifying offensive core, with Rillaboom supporting Ursaluna with Knock Off and Grassy Terrain to nullify Flame Orb's chip damage. Both Tail Glow and Take Heart Manaphy can be used alongside Rillaboom, as the Terrain powers up its Energy Ball and gives extra longevity to set up, become unbreakable, and fire off devastating Stored Powers, respectively. Rillaboom can bypass checks like Dragonite and Volcarona with support from Stealth Rock setters like Heatran, Great Tusk, and Glimmora in addition to its Knock Off to remove their Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Leveraging high Attack and Swift Swim to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame (and most of the boosted metagame), Barraskewda is one of OU's most terrifying wallbreakers. Choice Band Liquidation in rain tears through almost everything, OHKOing Galarian Slowking, Garganacl, and physically defensive Great Tusk. Flip Turn allows Barraskewda to quickly switch out against threatening Pokemon like Dragapult and bring in teammates that can better handle them or get valuable chip damage on foes it can't OHKO, while Aqua Jet gives it the opportunity to act as a revenge killer even without rain to boost its Speed or potentially beat Kingambit with faster priority. Close Combat threatens to OHKO a number of Water-resistant foes, like Roaring Moon, Kyurem, and Hisuian Samurott, and hits Ogerpon-W. Tera Water is often used to further augment Barraskewda's already strong offensive presence, it and rain letting Barraskewda OHKO Hatterene, Dragapult, and Latias with Liquidation and Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and offensive Landorus-T and offensive Gholdengo variants with Flip Turn.</p> <p>Because Barraskewda should only be used on rain teams, it must be paired with Pelipper, where it takes advantage of both the rain Pelipper sets and Pelipper's ability to safely pivot it in with U-turn. Due to its below-average defensive stats, Barraskewda is susceptible to being revenge killed by Rillaboom and Raging Bolt, so defensive teammates like Iron Treads are needed to switch into these Pokemon. Barraskewda also struggles against bulky Water-types like Dondozo, Ogerpon-W, and Tera Water Garganacl, as well as being completely walled by Water Absorb Clodsire; it partners well with Raging Bolt, Rillaboom, and Ogerpon-W, which can remove them, though Barraskewda does beat Clodsire if it's running an Unaware set. Barraskewda appreciates entry hazard removal and setting from Iron Treads, the former allowing it to not get worn down through repeated pivots, as it lacks recovery, as well as helping keep Pelipper healthy for sustained rain setting, and the latter allowing it to OHKO physically defensive Corviknight and Skarmory with Tera Water Liquidation in rain after Stealth Rock damage. Kingambit pairs well with Barraskewda, since it can easily revenge kill Pokemon that Barraskewda has already significantly weakened.</p>"

    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<p>Uniquely among setup sweepers, Shell Smash + Stored Power gives Polteageist the power to KO most of the tier, the Speed to outspeed most of it, and a tool to plow through Unaware walls, all in one turn. Its Ghost typing also blocks common priority attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Breloom's Mach Punch, which allows it to sweep even when Psychic Terrain is not active. Though it is resisted by Steel-types, a Psychic Terrain-boosted Stored Power can still heavily damage even Corviknight, 2HKOing physically defensive variants after just one Shell Smash. Shadow Ball is a consistent STAB move with excellent neutral coverage to hit most Steel- and Psychic-types hard, OHKOing Gholdengo and Hatterene. Tera Blast with Tera Fighting fills a gap in Polteageist's coverage, eliminating Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Kingambit while Psychic Terrain is active, and Hydreigon. Tera Fighting can also let it survive their Dark-type attacks. Weak Armor alongside a Focus Sash allows Polteageist to punish a stray physical attack, further boosting its Speed—it can outspeed +1 foes like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth—and Stored Power's damage. Focus Sash also lets Polteageist set up against threats that would otherwise outpace it or survive an attack and OHKO it, such as Kingambit, Choice Specs Dragapult, and offensive Great Tusk. A Timid nature is run to outpace +1 Walking Wake after a single Shell Smash.</p> <p>Polteageist is a staple on Psychic Terrain offense teams. Indeedee's Psychic Terrain protects Polteageist against priority attacks from Kingambit, Azumarill, and Floatzel while powering up its Stored Power, though Polteageist requires both a Shell Smash and a Weak Armor boost to outpace Swift Swim Floatzel. Indeedee can also let Polteageist set up with Encore or give it a second chance to sweep with Healing Wish, although if Polteageist has already consumed its Focus Sash, it will struggle to set up as reliably a second time. Armarouge is an excellent teammate and another staple on Psychic Terrain teams, as it can eliminate Steel-types like Kingambit with Armor Cannon to enable Polteageist's late-game sweep and it can use Endure to activate Weak Armor multiple times against Dragon Darts Dragapult, which Polteageist cannot reliably set up against. In return, Polteageist can greatly weaken or outright eliminate Unaware walls, set up against specially offensive Dragapult if its Focus Sash is intact, and can safely utilize Tera Fighting to eliminate Roaring Moon and wear down Ting-Lu, which allows Armarouge to sweep. Entry hazard removal is extremely important to maintain Focus Sash's protection. Eject Pack Great Tusk provides both Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock support, can safely get Polteageist in after using a strong Headlong Rush or Close Combat, and can also switch into and threaten Dark-types for Polteageist. Magic Bounce Hatterene deters entry hazards, spreads paralysis with Nuzzle, and can provide Healing Wish support. Also, Eject Button lets it safely pivot Polteageist in, even against U-Turns from Corviknight, Cinderace, or Meowscarada, giving it much easier setup opportunities. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragapult appreciate Polteageist breaking past Unaware walls and wearing down Steel-types. In return, Dragapult can use its multi-hit attacks to threaten opposing Psychic Terrain teams.</p>"

  "Hatterene": {
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>With entry hazard control provided by Magic Bounce, solid defensive stats that combine with powerful offenses to grant it great matchups against Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Clefable, and the potential for it to set up and snowball out of control with Calm Mind while keeping itself healthy with Draining Kiss, Hatterene makes a great addition to offensive teams looking for a special sweeper and hazard control in one. Psyshock is a strong STAB option that allows for Hatterene to target specially defensive walls on their weaker side, allowing for it to break through Blissey, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire while dealing with opposing setup sweepers that boost their Special Defense such as Volcarona. Stored Power lacks the immediate power of Psyshock but can scale heavily with multiple Calm Minds to allow Hatterene to muscle past even Unaware targets like Skeledirge, Clodsire, and Dondozo, along with also helping to win the one-on-one against other special setup sweepers in a similar manner to Psyshock. Unfortunately, its STAB combination leaves Hatterene walled by common Steel-types like Gholdengo, Heatran, and Iron Treads, while the low base power of Draining Kiss allows for Kingambit to easily stomach a boosted hit. Mystical Fire is a great coverage option that targets Steel-types, in particular helping to weaken Gholdengo's attacks, although this leaves Hatterene unable to hit Heatran; Nuzzle can alternatively be used to spread paralysis onto common switch-ins like Kingambit, Gholdengo, Heatran, and Skeledirge. While Magic Bounce's primary utility comes from its ability to deny entry hazards, it also blocks disruptive moves like Encore from Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W and Taunt from Landorus-T and Heatran, along with status moves like Toxic from Gliscor and Clodsire; this makes it far more potent as a setup sweeper. Leftovers is Hatterene's best option to greatly improve its staying power along with allowing it to switch in multiple times over the course of a game to block hazards; on Grassy Terrain teams and particularly with Stored Power, Grassy Seed can be considered to give Hatterene a better chance at immediately sweeping at the expense of being worse at coming in repeatedly, though Leftovers is still a viable option on these builds. The given spread runs enough Speed EVs to outspeed Toxapex, allowing for Hatterene to use a boosted attack before Toxapex can remove its boosts with Haze, with the remaining EVs invested to maximize physical defense. This notably allows for Hatterene to live even a +1 Protosynthesis-boosted Knock Off from Roaring Moon, while also dodging the 2HKO from Cinderace's Pyro Ball. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature can be considered on Nuzzle variants of Hatterene, as the Speed is less necessary when it is able to paralyze foes and so more physical bulk can be invested; however, this notably makes Hatterene slower than offensive Kingambit even after paralysis. Tera Water is a great neutral defensive typing that grants Hatterene a resistance to Steel-type attacks from Kingambit and Gholdengo, along with allowing it to stay in on Water- and Fire-type attacks from Pokemon that now struggle to eliminate it like Dondozo and Gouging Fire. Tera Fire also gives Hatterene a better matchup into Kingambit and Gholdengo while also giving it resistances to attacks from Rillaboom and Volcarona and powering up its coverage option on Mystical Fire sets. However, this comes at the expense of a weakness to Ground-type attacks from Great Tusk and Gliscor, along with making Hatterene much easier to revenge kill with strong Water-types like Ogerpon-W and Walking Wake.</p> <p>Calm Mind Hatterene is a great pick on offense teams that appreciate the support against entry hazards, particularly for bulkier offense builds without a dedicated hazard setting lead. One particular form of bulky offense that Hatterene thrives on is Grassy Terrain with Rillaboom, with the additional passive recovery from the Terrain being much appreciated to help boost Hatterene's longevity further. In return, Hatterene can keep hazards clear from the field, allowing for teammates like Heatran, Raging Bolt, and Rillaboom itself to opt not to run Heavy-Duty Boots without fearing hazard damage racking up over time. Hatterene fits on far more than Terrain offense though, finding a home on even hyper offense teams alongside hazard setters like Glimmora, and some of its best partners on both bulky offense and hyper offense are offensive hazard-weak Pokemon that would sooner run a boosting item than Heavy-Duty Boots; prime examples of this are Gouging Fire and Kyurem. With Hatterene's support, Gouging Fire can use Booster Energy without fearing Stealth Rock damage, boosting its power significantly. Gouging Fire can also switch into Steel-type attacks such as Kingambit's Iron Head and Gholdengo's Make It Rain and Hatterene in return can come in on Dragon-type attacks from opposing Kyurem and Walking Wake. Hatterene is also able to switch in on these attacks for Kyurem, but their primary synergy is Hatterene's ability to keep hazards off the field to help mitigate the hazard weakness of both Choice Specs and Dragon Dance Kyurem variants. Though Hatterene has ways of dealing with some of its more problematic matchups, Kingambit and Gholdengo are always an issue for their ability to shrug off its STAB attacks and threaten it with their own; bulky, offensive switch-ins to the former like Great Tusk and Zamazenta can alleviate this issue without dropping offensive pressure, while Kingambit itself can make a strong partner for its ability to come in on Gholdengo along with other Ghost- and Poison-type moves from foes like Dragapult and Galarian Slowking, the latter of which being one of Hatterene's most prevalent checks with its high Special Defense and resistance to Draining Kiss. In return for Kingambit's positive matchups against these targets, Hatterene resists Fighting-type attacks from Great Tusk, Skarmory, and Iron Valiant that would typically be directed towards Kingambit. One Pokemon that Hatterene struggles to break through is Heatran, as it takes negligible damage from even a boosted Draining Kiss and can negate Hatterene's Leftovers recovery with Magma Storm's passive damage; If Hatterene has Tera available and has already boosted with multiple Calm Minds as Heatran enters the field, the matchup swings in Hatterene's favour, but Hatterene is notably unable to come in directly on Heatran to prevent it from setting up Stealth Rock. Offensive partners like Hisuian Samurott and Gouging Fire can be used as switch-ins to Magma Storm, able to threaten the opposing Heatran out and with the latter appreciating Hatterene's ability to bait Heatran in and pop a potential Air Balloon. Although Hatterene is usually sufficient in keeping hazards off of its side of the field, on top of the aforementioned Stealth Rock Heatran matchup, opposing Hisuian Samurott are able to put hazards up with Ceaseless Edge despite losing to Hatterene itself. This makes alternative forms of hazard removal such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads good partners to Hatterene, as they can provide key relief in these matchups for hazard-weak teams that would otherwise be overly reliant on Hatterene.</p>"
      },
      "Healing Wish": {
        "description": "<p>Through a coveted combination of Healing Wish, an elite ability in Magic Bounce, reasonably strong STAB moves, a typing that naturally checks Fighting-types, and a choice of Nuzzle to effortlessly spread paralysis or Mystical Fire to check special attackers and punish Steel-types, Hatterene can support its teammates in a way that cannot be fully replicated by anything else. Healing Wish is crucial, as it allows Hatterene to sacrifice itself in order to fully heal a teammate's HP and cure any status effects; because Hatterene is often paired with sweepers and Terrain or weather setters that enable them, this is often a perfectly acceptable trade to pivot them in safely. Psychic and Dazzling Gleam boast decent coverage together and greatly threaten Fighting-types like Great Tusk and Zamazenta thanks to Hatterene's high base Special Attack; Psychic leaves its mark against Poison-types like Glimmora and Toxapex, while Dazzling Gleam hits Dragon-types like Roaring Moon, Kyurem, Raging Bolt, and Dragapult and Dark-types like Darkrai. Nuzzle ensures that Hatterene remains far from passive by paralyzing anything bar Ground-types and Electric-types; even Gholdengo and opposing Hatterene, which are safe from paralysis from Thunder Wave, are crippled if hit by Nuzzle. Mystical Fire, however, complements Hatterene's STAB moves well by hitting Steel-types super effectively; it also always lowers the opponent's Special Attack, giving it some added utility against threats that can boost their Special Attack like Quiver Dance Volcarona and Calm Mind Raging Bolt. Eject Button complements Magic Bounce perfectly; Hatterene's mere presence on a team will deter opponents from setting entry hazards and using status moves, and with significant investment, Hatterene's bulk is sufficient enough to switch directly into a strong neutral hit, survive, and activate Eject Button to safely pivot a teammate in. Eject Button also has the added benefit of turning the tables on U-turn and Volt Switch users, getting a free switch while denying their own switch. 132 Speed EVs allow Hatterene to outpace Ting-Lu, ensuring that it can at least get some chip damage against it before being attacked in return and expanding the number of slower threats it can use Healing Wish against before being KOed. The rest of its EVs serve to maximize its physical bulk, allowing Hatterene to better pivot in against most physical attackers such as unboosted Kingambit and Roaring Moon, Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Meowscarada. Tera Steel allows Hatterene to handle Fairy-type attacks from Iron Valiant and Enamorus more easily so it can punish them with Nuzzle and turns Hatterene's Poison weakness into an immunity, allowing it to spinblock against Mortal Spin Glimmora. Steel's powerful defensive profile also expands the number of threats Hatterene can safely use Healing Wish against in a pinch, such as Iron Head Kingambit, Kyurem and Galarian Slowking; though very situational, other Tera types like Dark and Flying can accomplish similar goals against different threats like Gholdengo and Dragapult for the former and Great Tusk and Heavy Slam Zamazenta for the latter.</p> <p>Healing Wish Hatterene's ability to enable multiple free switches for its teammates makes it a strong choice for offensive teams—particularly teams vulnerable to entry hazards—that need to maximize a limited number of turns. Healing Wish Hatterene is almost mandatory on sun teams, which are often so vulnerable to hazards that its Magic Bounce serves as a strong secondary or even tertiary countermeasure against them; Fire-types such as Torkoal and Gouging Fire are especially weak to entry hazards, but even powerful attackers like Choice Band Roaring Moon, Choice Specs Walking Wake, Black Glasses and Air Balloon Kingambit, and Life Orb Venusaur and Hisuian Lilligant can be worn down very quickly with hazard chip. Many of these are also answers to traditional Hatterene checks; powerful offensive threats like Choice Specs Walking Wake, Choice Band Roaring Moon, offensive Great Tusk, and Dragon Dance Gouging Fire can collectively overwhelm Hatterene checks like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran, which gives Hatterene plenty of opportunities to switch in on a neutral attack and either pivot out with Eject Button or use Healing Wish. Sun teams also greatly appreciate Hatterene's ability to give Torkoal an extra chance to support its team with Drought through Healing Wish, further enable these aforementioned offensive threats with Healing Wish, or spread paralysis with Nuzzle. Hatterene is also useful on rain teams for similar reasons; Pelipper greatly appreciates extra opportunities to set Drizzle up through Eject Button or Healing Wish, and teammates like Barraskewda and Raging Bolt appreciate both Hatterene's ability to deny hazards to keep them healthy and the many safe switches it can enable. Hatterene is also a staple on Psychic Terrain teams, which appreciate its ability to give Indeedee an extra chance to set up Psychic Terrain or to safely pivot in sweepers like Quiver Dance Volcarona, Shell Smash Polteageist, Dragon Dance Roaring Moon and Gouging Fire, offensive Deoxys-S, and Booster Energy Iron Boulder and Iron Crown while wasting as few precious Psychic Terrain turns as possible.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Dragapult is one of OU's best pivots, with its massive base Speed stat allowing it to dance around slower threats, spread status and deal significant damage over the course of a game. Dragon Darts is a strong STAB option that hits key targets in the tier such as Roaring Moon, Raging Bolt, and Dragonite, with the given spread running enough Attack investment to OHKO Kyurem after Stealth Rock damage. Alternatively, Draco Meteor can be used with an EV spread fully invested into Special Attack that lets it secure an OHKO into Walking Wake and Gouging Fire while also giving Dragapult a more powerful Hex to 2HKO even max HP Gholdengo, but the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor leaves it vulnerable to being used as setup fodder, and this set is also weaker into sweepers that boost their Special Defense such as Raging Bolt and Volcarona. Both Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are great options that synergize with the rest of Dragapult's toolkit by doubling the power of Hex; Will-O-Wisp turns Dragapult into a great fast check that can outrun and neutralize physical threats such as Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Kingambit while also forcing chip on Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Clodsire that try to switch in, while Thunder Wave slows down targets like Volcarona to help teammates deal with them more easily. Tera Fairy is a great defensive option that flips Dragapult's Dragon weakness into an immunity while also granting a Dark resistance to resist hits from Kingambit and Darkrai, whereas Tera Ghost powers up Hex while still dropping its weaknesses to Fairy and Dragon to help block revenge killing attempts by Enamorus.</p> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots Dragapult is a fantastic pick on balance teams, synergizing well with durable hazard setters such as Skarmory, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu that can assist in chipping down the switch-ins that it forces. In return, Dragapult helps to patch up bulkier teams' lack of speed control while not minding the hazards that they often allow on both sides of the field. Knock Off users such as Meowscarada and Weavile are solid pairings with Dragapult on these balance structures, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokemon to make the switches that Dragapult forces more meaningful while giving Dragapult opportunities to come in for free on their own checks, allowing these teams to better pressure opposing Skarmory and Corviknight. Bulkier offense teams also benefit from the presence of Dragapult as a form of speed control that wears down defensive cores with both damage and status effects; Kingambit in particular is a terrifying late-game sweeper that appreciates Dragapult's ability to weaken a team for it to clean through, with Will-O-Wisp Dragapult able to neuter its physical checks like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Skarmory, while Thunder Wave variants can slow down threats that would otherwise outspeed Kingambit such as Volcarona, Cinderace, and Heatran. In turn, Dragapult often invites in opposing Kingambit, which resists its STAB options and is only threatened by its status moves, so solid switch-ins for this like Skarmory and Great Tusk are usually appreciated to prevent it from getting too many free turns. Raging Bolt in particular is a strong partner to pivot Dragapult on bulky offense teams that enjoy its support to help break through Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and specially defensive Gliscor. Heavy-Duty Boots Dragapult also struggles to muscle past bulkier checks like Toxapex and Clefable alone, so partners that can take advantage of them for setup opportunities such as Kingambit and Gholdengo are great picks. As Dragapult's Speed tier is almost unmatched in the OU metagame, Booster Energy users like Iron Boulder and Iron Valiant along with the even faster Deoxys-S are frequently forced in to revenge kill it, so more defensive teammates that can handle these threats are valued; Galarian Slowking is a good bulky pivot that takes on the latter two and can use Chilly Reception to bring in Dragapult for free after taking a hit, while both Gliscor and Skarmory are solid Iron Boulder checks that can either beat it or force it to switch out and lose its Speed boost, allowing Dragapult to outspeed it later.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Dragapult is an amazing source of immediate power due to its near unresisted STAB combination, solid Special Attack, and excellent Speed tier, which outspeeds the majority of the unboosted metagame except Deoxys-S. Equipping Choice Specs allows Dragapult to break through Pokemon such as Gliscor and Zamazenta with its STAB moves. Flamethrower threatens Kingambit. U-turn allows Dragapult to keep the momentum for its team and hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon. Infiltrator allows Dragapult to be a great check to dual screens teams and Substitute sweepers such as Iron Defense Zamazenta. Tera Ghost powers up its most spammable STAB attack in Shadow Ball, allowing Dragapult to further dent Galarian Slowking and secure the OHKO on Iron Valiant and Skeledirge. This also improves its matchup into Iron Valiant and Enamorus, as it takes much less damage from Moonblast, allowing it to survive a hit and KO them back. Tera Dragon raises Draco Meteor to nuclear levels, OHKOing Gliscor, Dondozo, and defensive Landorus-T, and it also improves Dragapult's matchup into Darkrai and Gholdengo, as it removes it weakness to Dark Pulse and Shadow Ball, respectively. A Modest nature can be run instead of Timid to forego outspeeding Zamazenta, Weavile, and Darkrai for higher damage output, such as OHKOing Gliscor and Serperior with Draco Meteor.</p> <p>Dragapult fits well on offensive teams due to its excellent ability to break down walls such as Toxapex, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire. Therefore, Dragapult is able to benefit sweepers like Gholdengo, Raging Bolt, and Volcarona that appreciate walls being worn down. Dark- and Fairy-types like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Clefable are threats to Dragapult, as they are able to switch in and force it out. Therefore, checks to these such as Iron Valiant, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta make for good partners. The latter two help with Kingambit, which is Dragapult's biggest check due to resisting both of its STAB moves. Dragapult benefits from entry hazards on the opposing side of the field. Therefore, entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Gliscor are good partners for it. Knock Off support from the likes of Weavile, Roaring Moon, and Meowscarada are able to be brought in by Dragapult's U-turn, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Kyurem and Darkrai. Meowscarada especially is a great partner, since it’s able to bring Dragapult in with its own U-turn after removing Heavy-Duty Boots, allowing Dragapult to better pressure its checks. Dragapult is not very good at switching into attacks, as it is relatively frail, so slow pivots like Galarian Slowking and Alomomola are amazing teammates. Entry hazards wear down Dragapult over time, limiting the number of times it can switch onto the field; therefore, hazard control from Great Tusk and Cinderace can help Dragapult. Deoxys-S and Booster Energy Pokemon with a Speed Boost such as Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant are able to outspeed and threaten to KO Dragapult, so speed control like Rillaboom, Raging Bolt and Kingambit make for good teammates.</p>"

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With an outstanding Speed tier, fantastic natural bulk and the raw power to match, all-out attacking Zamazenta is one of the tier's best natural forms of speed control and a great one-time check to some of the tier's most dominant physical threats like Kingambit and Gouging Fire with Dauntless Shield. A powerful Close Combat is backed up by Heavy Slam to hit Fairy-types like Hatterene, Clefable, and Iron Valiant, while Crunch allows for Zamazenta to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Galarian Slowking. Stone Edge lets Zamazenta OHKO Volcarona, secure a 2HKO on Gouging Fire, specially defensive Skeledirge, and Tera Flying Roaring Moon, and deal heavy damage to both Pelipper and Torkoal. Alternatively, Zamazenta can opt to run Ice Fang as its strongest move against Gliscor and Landorus-T, coming with the additional benefit of comfortably 2HKOing Dragonite, while Psychic Fangs is a niche option that allows for Zamazenta to hit both Clodsire and Toxapex while improving its matchup against dual screens hyper offense teams. Heavy-Duty Boots allows for Zamazenta to switch in safely regardless of entry hazards and fully leverage its bulk, allowing for it to come in multiple times over the course of a game. Choice Band can instead be used to greatly enhance its wallbreaking power, granting it key 2HKOs on Skarmory, Corviknight, and offensive Great Tusk, but this comes at the expense of Zamazenta losing out on longevity and the ability to hit subsequent switch-ins with its coverage options. An alternative spread of 88 HP / 252 Atk / 168 Spe, again with a Jolly nature, allows for Zamazenta to still outrun +1 Adamant Dragonite, Weavile, and Darkrai while improving its bulk. This HP investment notably allows for Zamazenta to live Enamorus's Moonblast and even +1 Dragon Dance Roaring Moon's Acrobatics with Dauntless Shield active, but the lack of Speed is detrimental for the matchup against opposing Zamazenta. Tera Steel is selected to flip Zamazenta's matchup against Fairy-, Psychic-, and Flying-type attacks from Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, Galarian Slowking, and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon while also turning Heavy Slam into a powerful STAB option that cleanly OHKOes both Iron Valiant and Enamorus and providing Zamazenta with an immunity to Toxic from Galarian Slowking. Tera Stellar can instead be considered as an option that gives a one-time boost to all of its moves; this boost is strong enough to allow for Zamazenta to OHKO offensive Cinderace and a slightly chipped Ogerpon-W with Close Combat, while also giving it 2HKOs on both Raging Bolt and Pelipper with Close Combat and Stone Edge, respectively. This also gives Zamazenta a one-time nuke to break through weakened checks like Skarmory and Corviknight. However, this comes at the expense of Tera Stellar having no defensive value. Tera Fighting is a more niche option without any defensive merit that Zamazenta can opt to run, only boosting its Close Combat but crucially letting it 2HKO Skarmory after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Zamazenta is a great fit for both balance and offense teams lacking speed control while giving these builds a check to Dark-types like Kingambit, Weavile, Meowscarada, and Darkrai. It appreciates entry hazard support to take full advantage of the switches it forces, pairing well with hazard setters such as Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor on balance and Landorus-T and Glimmora on offense. Zamazenta's ability to check both Weavile and Meowscarada pairs particularly well with Pokemon like Gliscor and Landorus-T; Zamazenta's lack of recovery means that it struggles to switch in consistently on these Pokemon though. This makes bulky pivots like Galarian Slowking and Alomomola much appreciated to allow it safe entry onto the field, the former also providing a much-needed switch-in to Moonblast from Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Galarian Slowking in particular forms a potent combination with Zamazenta, as Zamazenta's Close Combat dissuades Dark- and Steel-types like Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Roaring Moon from switching into Galarian Slowking's Future Sight, while common switch-ins to Zamazenta such as Gliscor, Great Tusk, and Skarmory cannot safely come in and take both hits. Although Zamazenta's Speed tier is impressive by OU standards, it is still outsped by Dragapult, Deoxys-S, and Choice Scarf users like Enamorus and Gholdengo, which are able to threaten it with heavy damage; priority attackers that can revenge kill these faster threats are therefore much appreciated. Kingambit in particular is a strong partner that can switch into Dragapult and Gholdengo and threaten both of these targets along with Deoxys-S with Sucker Punch, while Weavile cannot freely switch into these threats but is able to provide an alternative form of speed control that can also threaten Dragapult, Enamorus, and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon with Ice Shard. With Booster Energy, Iron Valiant is also able to outspeed and threaten Zamazenta with Moonblast; Gholdengo makes for a solid check to Iron Valiant, also being able to come in on Galarian Slowking and Clefable that would live a hit and threaten Zamazenta back. In turn, Gholdengo appreciates Zamazenta's ability to threaten many of its common checks like Kingambit, Weavile, and Meowscarada. Rillaboom also makes for a great partner to pick off Deoxys-S and Iron Valiant with Grassy Glide while weakening shared checks like Skarmory and Corviknight with Knock Off to allow for Zamazenta to freely attack them without taking Rocky Helmet damage. Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain is particularly useful for providing Zamazenta with recovery to help maintain its longevity; Alomomola can similarly help to alleviate this issue by providing Wish support while also appreciating Zamazenta's ability to check Ogerpon-W. Zamazenta is walled by Gliscor and Clodsire when using Stone Edge as its coverage option, and so switch-ins to these Pokemon such as Gliscor itself and Clefable on balance and Hatterene on offense make valuable partners, along with powerful attackers like Weavile, Kyurem, and Meowscarada to directly threaten them out. Zamazenta pressures some of the tier's common physical walls like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Skarmory; teammates like Kingambit and Weavile appreciate its ability to weaken these targets. Volcarona is a great pairing that not only finds free entry points against Skarmory but is able to switch in on both Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Enamorus and use the latter as setup fodder.</p>"

      "Iron Defense": {
        "description": "<p>Iron Defense Zamazenta is a fast sweeper for offense that also happens to blanket check most of the physical metagame with great matchups into key threats such as Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Weavile. It acts as a strong form of role compression that can make use of its great bulk, a Defense boost from Dauntless Shield, and its high Speed stat to find opportunities to use Iron Defense to not only bolster its survivability but also strengthen the power of its Body Press. Crunch is a necessity to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types like Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Galarian Slowking that aren't threatened by Body Press, while its last moveslot is more flexible; Heavy Slam gives Zamazenta super effective coverage into Fairy-types that otherwise would wall it such as Clefable, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant, while Substitute allows Zamazenta to dodge status moves from the likes of Gliscor, Galarian Slowking, and Toxapex along with helping to block revenge killing attempts from faster Pokemon such as Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. Stone Edge is an alternative that gives Zamazenta a non-contact option to hit Volcarona and Zapdos while still giving it coverage to hit Enamorus, at the expense of losing its ability to hit other Fairy-types and the benefit of Substitute's status and revenge killing protection. 168 EVs in Speed allow Zamazenta to outrun Adamant Dragonite after a Dragon Dance while also outrunning key threats like Weavile and Darkrai. Zamazenta can then choose to invest EVs into HP for better overall bulk or into Attack for stronger coverage moves; notably, maximum HP investment ensures that Zamazenta will survive Choice Scarf Enamorus's Moonblast from full while also avoiding a 2HKO from Clefable. Choosing to maximize Attack gives Zamazenta a clean 2HKO on offensive Gholdengo with Crunch and on both Clefable and Hatterene with Heavy Slam. The remaining EVs are invested in Defense to improve Zamazenta's bulk and give it a stronger Body Press. Tera Steel is one of Zamazenta's best options, defensively flipping the matchup into Fairy-, Psychic-, and Flying-type attacks from foes like Enamorus, Galarian Slowking, Deoxys-S, and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon while also powering up Heavy Slam to OHKO both Enamorus and Iron Valiant even without Attack investment. Tera Steel also gives Zamazenta a crucial immunity to Toxic from Gliscor and Toxapex. Tera Fire serves to grant Zamazenta a key Fairy resistance without making it weak to Fighting-type moves from Iron Valiant, but the primary draw of this Tera type is an immunity to burn, a particularly important quality against Dragapult and Skeledirge, the former of which being able to burn even Substitute variants of Zamazenta with Infiltrator. Tera Fairy is another solid defensive typing for Zamazenta, granting it a great defensive profile that includes a resistance to Fighting-type attacks that helps out immensely in the Iron Defense mirror matchup against both Zamazenta and Skarmory, as well as an immunity to Dragapult's Draco Meteor and a retained resistance to Dark-type attacks that allows you to still check Weavile and Roaring Moon; Tera Ghost is an option that leans even heavier into beating opposing Iron Defense users at the expense of granting little defensive value.</p> <p>Zamazenta is a great fit on both bulky offense and hyper offense teams that need a fast offensive piece with good matchups into the tier's physical threats, in particular providing a crucial Kingambit check to a team. However, to be able to fully leverage its defensive value, it appreciates entry hazard removal to allow it to switch in without taking chip damage on entry and potentially being neutered entirely by Toxic Spikes. Hatterene is a particularly good partner in this regard, as it not only blocks entry hazards but can also be used to weaken shared checks like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Skeledirge, and Great Tusk can clear hazards from the field along with helping to wear down Gliscor and force in and chip down Gholdengo attempting to block Rapid Spin. Rillaboom also serves as a great pairing that helps to bolster Zamazenta's longevity, with the additional healing from Grassy Terrain making Zamazenta much more difficult to remove from the field. Zamazenta's ability to check the tier's offensive Dark-types is also a valuable quality for hyper offense teams that opt to run a hazard lead like Glimmora or Deoxys-S, as these builds often use Gholdengo to block hazard removal; this will often give threats like Kingambit, Weavile, and Hisuian Samurott free attacks that necessitate an offensive switch-in that Zamazenta provides. Zamazenta is then able to take advantage of these Pokemon by using them as setup fodder. Gholdengo itself is a strong partner to Zamazenta, able to switch into Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks from Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Hatterene while also taking advantage of Zamazenta's defensive checks like Galarian Slowking and Clefable being unable to touch it. Zamazenta's relatively low wallbreaking power unfortunately leaves it struggling to muscle through Unaware walls like Dondozo, Skeledirge, and Clodsire, while its inability to boost the strength of its coverage moves makes bulkier Pokemon that don't fear Body Press like defensive Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking hard to break through; Zamazenta matches up best into opposing offense teams, and so balance breakers and stallbreakers are appreciated to support it in its other matchups. One strong offensive pairing with Zamazenta is Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, as it can weaken Skarmory and remove its Rocky Helmet to allow Zamazenta to later break through it. In particular, Roaring Moon's ability to chunk Dondozo and force it to take hazard damage with Knock Off is much appreciated to help Zamazenta make progress against it. Kingambit is another excellent teammate for Zamazenta, loading well into bulkier teams and heavily pressuring Dondozo while also being able to switch into Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Hatterene that may come in to force Zamazenta out. A great partner to Zamazenta on hyper offensive teams is Booster Energy Iron Valiant, able to weaken shared checks like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Skeledirge for Zamazenta to later break through. Iron Valiant also provides hyper offensive teams with a temporary form of speed control that can outrun Dragapult and Deoxys-S, both of which outspeed and can threaten Zamazenta with strong special attacks, or, in Dragapult's case, debilitating status with Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Ursaluna is a peerless wallbreaker that can muscle through even the bulkiest of Pokemon. After Flame Orb activates, Facade 2HKOes even Pokemon as physically bulky as Dondozo and OHKOes physically defensive Great Tusk after a Swords Dance while letting Ursaluna act as a status absorber. Headlong Rush is generally preferred for its higher power, but Earthquake is another good option that avoids Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet damage and lets Ursaluna leverage its good bulk. Fire Punch hits Corviknight, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Air Balloon Kingambit, which resist Ursaluna's STAB combination. Tera Normal boosts Facade to breathtaking levels, allowing it to cleanly 2HKO physically defensive Corviknight after Stealth Rock. Tera Ghost is an alternative that lets Ursaluna avoid being revenge killed by Fighting-type attacks such as Close Combat from Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, or Sneasler. The given EV spread maximizes Ursaluna's damage output while also ensuring it outspeeds Skeledirge and standard Corviknight. On Trick Room teams, Ursaluna should run maximum Attack and HP investment, a Brave nature, and 0 Speed IVs.</p> <p>Ursaluna serves as an exceptionally powerful wallbreaker on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Garchomp is appreciated to make Ursaluna even more difficult to wall. Dual screens support from Dragapult can also be considered, since it will further reinforce Ursaluna's excellent bulk, and Dragapult can even provide free switches through Curse or U-turn. Against slower-paced teams, Ursaluna's great bulk and immunity to status give it many opportunities to switch in and start wreaking havoc, but it can struggle against faster-paced, more aggressive teams. Good partners for Ursaluna that excel against offense include Kingambit, Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Zamazenta, which, in return, appreciate Ursaluna breaking through Pokemon such as Dondozo and Corviknight. Ursaluna enjoys U-turn or Volt Switch support from Rotom-W, Landorus-T, or Dragapult, letting it hit the field multiple times to fire off its insanely powerful attacks. Galarian Slowking is another great teammate for Ursaluna, as it can both provide momentum with Chilly Reception and supplement Ursaluna's firepower with Future Sight. Galarian Slowking can also switch into and pressure some of the Pokemon that give Ursaluna trouble, such as Iron Valiant. Trick Room support from Hatterene and Cresselia is an interesting option to turn Ursaluna's low Speed into an advantage.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Enamorus can be a sweeper, a form of speed control that allows it to function as an effective revenge killer, and a support Pokemon that gives a teammate a second chance at sweeping via Healing Wish. Choice Scarf is used to outspeed faster common threats such as Zamazenta, Dragapult, and Attack Booster Energy Roaring Moon. Earth Power is mandatory coverage for hitting Fairy resistant foes: Steel-types like non-Air Balloon Gholdengo and Iron Treads, Fire-types like Heatran and Skeledirge, and Poison-types like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire. Tera Stellar Tera Blast gives Enamorus a way to boost its Special Attack thanks to Contrary while simultaneously sniping opposing Terastallized Pokemon like Volcarona and Kingambit. Tera Stellar hits everything in the tier neutrally, so it's able to snowball and clean weakened teams effectively. Mystical Fire is a good alternative, letting it hit Steel-types immune to Earth Power, such as Skarmory, Corviknight, and Air Balloon Gholdengo while also making Enamorus not as Tera-reliant. Healing Wish sacrifices Enamorus in order to fully heal a chipped sweeper like Kyurem or Raging Bolt so it can continue a sweep it couldn't finish previously, and should be used when Enamorus's speed is no longer needed to win the game. Tera Ground can be used instead of Tera Stellar to power up Earth Power and to flip Enamorus's poor matchups against Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb. Tera Fairy can also be used to further boost Moonblast's power, guaranteeing an OHKO on Kyurem and 2HKOs against Ting-Lu and neutral targets like specially defensive Gliscor.</p> <p>Enamorus is best used as speed control on offensive teams that appreciate it giving teammates a potential second chance to sweep. Hazard removers like Court Change Cinderace and Great Tusk are excellent teammates, since Stealth Rock limits the amount of times Enamorus can come in and revenge kill. Cinderace can give hazards to the foe if they aren't on both sides of the field, its access to U-turn helps get Enamorus in safely, and its Pyro Balls force Gholdengo off the field so Enamorus can use Moonblast more freely. Great Tusk is a great teammate, because it threatens common Enamorus switch-ins like Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Toxapex, and checks Kingambit, which can take a hit from Enamorus and retaliate back. Galarian Slowking is a pivot that greatly appreciates Enamorus's presence since it can deal with the Dark- and Ground-types that annoy it such as Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Darkrai. Enamorus appreciates Galarian Slowking's presence too, as its access to Future Sight is extremely useful for muscling through Poison-types like Toxapex and opposing Galarian Slowking and for bulky neutral targets like Gliscor. Galarian Slowking's access to status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave allows it to incapacitate Pokemon that may give Enamorus a hard time like Iron Valiant, Walking Wake, and Iron Boulder. Chilly Reception is used to bring Enamorus onto the field safely, but also has the added benefit of changing the weather, giving rain Pokemon like Barraskewda, Raging Bolt, and Iron Treads a harder time. Another pivot Enamorus loves pairing with is Landorus-T, since it can bring Enamorus in safely with U-turn, threaten all the Poison- and Steel- types Enamorus struggles with, and can set Stealth Rock. Bulky physical setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Gouging Fire work well with Enamorus since they're able to deal with special walls that can prevent it from making progress, mainly Galarian Slowking, and change the tide of a battle if they're able to get a second chance at sweeping thanks to Healing Wish. They also have a good matchup against Volcarona, a setup sweeper Enamorus often can't break through. Physical Dark-types like Kingambit and Roaring Moon are more Pokemon who enjoy Enamorus's presence, since it can take on one of their best checks in Zamazenta, and Healing Wish can allow them to achieve a late-game sweep in case they had to come in earlier and sustain lots of damage. They're also able to blow past common Enamorus checks such as Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Clodsire. Hazard setters like Glimmora and Hisuian Samurott can help chip foes into range for Enamorus to break through their team, and Gholdengo is appreciated to block removal attempts and keep the hazards up for the duration of the game. Kyurem also synergizes with Enamorus pretty well, because it pressures Poison- and Steel-types Enamorus has bad matchups against, so Enamorus can pick them off late-game after they've been weakened.</p>"

What Draining Kiss may lack in power, it makes up for with its ability to keep Enamorus-T healthy, which is critical, since this set is focused on longevity over raw damage. Earth Power pairs exceedingly well with it, giving Enamorus-T impressive coverage that is resisted by only a few Pokemon while hitting threats like Gholdengo and Heatran super effectively. Leftovers help keep Enamorus-T healthy while it racks up boosts, but Heavy-Duty Boots keeps it safe from Stealth Rock, which poses to cut away a significant amount of HP once Enamorus-T switches in. Grassy Seed can also be run if Enamorus-T is paired with Rillaboom, as the instant Defense boost can aid it greatly in setting up. Terastallization aids Enamorus-T's ability to set up by mixing up its defensive profile;Tera Steel allows it to deal with Poison- and Steel-types, giving it a chance to take Dire Claw from Sneasler and Iron Head from Kingambit, respectively. It also removes its weakness to Electric, giving it a better matchup against Zapdos. In addition, with Overcoat, Tera Steel makes Enamorus-T a very capable Amoonguss switch-in, letting it use it as setup fodder for a potential sweep. Tera Water maintains the resistance to Steel while also giving it a resistance to Ice, and can turn Enamorus-T into a useful Walking Wake check in a pinch. The EV spread is designed to keep Enamorus-T as bulky as possible while still allowing it to outspeed uninvested Kingambit, Azumarill, and Ursaluna.</p> <p>Enamorus-T fits best on bulky offensive teams that allow it to sweep late-game once its checks have been whittled down or removed. Therefore, offensive wallbreakers like Sneasler and Iron Valiant serve as good teammates for it. The latter in particular is good at wearing down Moltres and Corviknight, two common Pokemon that resist both of Enamorus-T's attacks. Offensive hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott also help by wearing down the opponent's team. If Enamorus-T is not using Heavy-Duty Boots, then hazard removal is a necessity, so Pokemon like Great Tusk and Cinderace are further appreciated.</p>"

Knock Off scares some of the tier's key dangers like Deoxys-Speed, Dragapult, and Gholdengo while simultaneously threatening to cripple other switch-ins like Hatterene and Volcarona. Flower Trick cuts through bulky threats such as Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Primarina, even ignoring the former two's potential Defense boosts, while Triple Axel gives Meowscarada a crucial Ice-type STAB move that allows it to nail common Pokemon such as Clodsire, Gliscor, Raging Bolt, and Roaring Moon. U-turn could be used in the last slot for keeping momentum while chipping switch-ins such as Kingambit and Hatterene. Alternatively, Meowscarada can run Low Kick to smack some of the tier's most threatening staples such as Kingambit and Kyurem. Heavy-Duty Boots is practically a requirement on this set, as Meowscarada will frequently be switching in and out of combat and is otherwise quite weak to hazards. Tera Grass and Dark enhance Flower Trick and Knock Off while Tera Fire grants Meowscarada some crucial resistances to Fairy, Ice, and Steel-type attacks such as those from Enamorus, Gouging Fire, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. Tera Electric is an additional option that allows Meowscarada to feast on Zapdos more effectively thanks to a newly gained Static immunity and resistance to both of its STAB moves.</p> <p>Meowscarada fits best on balance teams that need a way to force hazard chip along with Knock Off spam to whittle down or outright threaten Pokemon that otherwise don't mind Knock Off such as Gliscor. Meowscarada's frailty courtesy of its pitiful bulk is sometimes hard to work around and limits its switch in opportunities, especially with common weaknesses courtesy of its exploitable defensive typing and a nasty 4x weakness to U-turn. Furthermore, Meowscarada, while being quite fast, is still outsped by monsters such as Darkrai, Dragapult, Weavile, and Zamazenta, the latter of which happens to be one of Meowscarada's best checks. Weavile's offensive tenacity combined with deadly Speed makes it a potent threat, which is why Rocky Helmet Skarmory is one of Meowscarada's best partner options on balance teams, as it punishes Triple Axel spam and shrugs off Weavile's hits comparatively easily. Meowscarada's role as an offensive pivot helps chip away at opposing cores while also bringing some of their key defensive threats into OHKO range for some frail teammates like Darkrai, Iron Boulder, and Gholdengo. Dragapult is another great partner for Meowscarada; it can blank Fighting-type attacks and follow up with a fast Will-O-Wisp to neuter Zamazenta as well. Meowscarada's defensive woes can be covered by bulky teammates that don't mind taking coverage moves from faster threats. On the physical side, Gouging Fire and Great Tusk are both excellent partners whose typings complement Meowscarada's. Gouging Fire acts as a great Will-O-Wisp absorber, while Great Tusk's role as a physically bulky offensive spinner with synergistic typing opens up multiple opportunities to clear hazards. On the special side, Clodsire and Galarian Slowking are both impressive partners thanks to their longevity and fantastic defensive profiles, with the former being able to blank setup sweepers like Darkrai and the latter being able to continue Meowscarada's momentum chain by using a slow Chilly Reception to take a hit or scout a switch, allowing Meowscarada to come in safely. Additionally, Galarian Slowking also threatens Pokemon that would commonly switch into Meowscarada like Iron Defense Zamazenta with Future Sight.</p>"

      "Choice Item": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Item Meowscarada distinguishes itself as an amazing wallbreaker and offensive pivot of the tier thanks to its great Attack and Speed stats and fantastic coverage options alongside Protean, capable of dismantling common defensive picks such as Dondozo, Galarian Slowking, and Ting-Lu. Choice Band boosts its wallbreaking prowess to nuclear levels, whereas Choice Scarf makes it a great revenge killer capable of outspeeding foes like +1 Iron Valiant, Deoxys-S, and +1 Roaring Moon. Triple Axel functions as an incredible coverage move, hitting foes like Gliscor, Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Enamorus super effectively. U-turn allows Meowscarada to gain momentum against common switch-ins like Kingambit, Skarmory, and Corviknight. Trick can also be used over Flower Trick to cripple checks like Skarmory and bulky setup sweepers like Hatterene to hamper their effectiveness and giving Meowscarada more flexibility with moves. Tera Dark boosts the power of its Knock Off, notably allowing Choice Scarf Meowscarada to OHKO Galarian Slowking and Choice Band Meowscarada to OHKO offensive Volcarona and Cinderace. Tera Fire makes Meowscarada resistant to Ice, Fairy, and Fire, helping it against foes like Kyurem, Enamorus, Gouging Fire, and Volcarona while also making it immune to Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Dragapult and Volcarona's Flame Body, though it still struggles against Gouging Fire, as losing Protean means it fails to nail the 2HKO. In addition, Choice Scarf Meowscarada no longer OHKOes Gliscor, Roaring Moon, and Rillaboom, while Choice Band variants lose the OHKO on Raging Bolt. Finally, Tera Grass allows Meowscarada's Flower Trick to reach new heights of power, enabling Choice Scarf variants to secure an OHKO on bulky Calm Mind Primarina and Choice Band variants to OHKO maximum HP Great Tusk.</p> <p>Choice Item Meowscarada fits well on bulky offense structures that appreciate its ability to pivot and remove items from opposing Pokemon, especially defensive ones, with Knock Off. Teammates such as Gholdengo and Volcarona appreciate Meowscarada pivoting against switch-ins like Skarmory and Corviknight, giving them opportunities to set up and clean. Other setup sweepers like Iron Defense Zamazenta also appreciate Meowscarada's ability to revenge kill foes like Gholdengo and non-Choice Scarf Enamorus for them to set up and sweep with minimum hindrance. Entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Skarmory, and Gliscor also appreciate Meowscarada using Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots, which makes foes like Volcarona take hazard damage. Special wallbreakers like Kyurem and Enamorus also appreciate Meowscarada threatening special walls like Primarina and Galarian Slowking. Meowscarada struggles against Steel-types like Skarmory and Kingambit. Thus, teammates that threaten them, such as Dragapult and the aforementioned Gholdengo and Volcarona for Skarmory, and Pokemon like Zamazenta and Great Tusk for Kingambit, are appreciated. Zamazenta itself is also a threat to Meowscarada, so teammates that check it such as the aforementioned Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Enamorus should be acknowledged. Galarian Slowking also deserves a special mention as a teammate, as its Future Sight has excellent synergy with Meowscarada and helps it deal with Zamazenta as well as other Fighting-types like Iron Valiant by making Meowscarada's moves, especially Knock Off, harder to switch into with these Pokemon. In addition, it also forms a strong pivoting core with Meowscarada. Due to the risk of being Choice-locked into the wrong move, Meowscarada is also quite prediction reliant when facing structures with Pokemon like Gliscor and Dondozo. Therefore, Pokemon that pressure such cores, like Raging Bolt and Dragapult, are excellent partners. Meowscarada also doesn't like taking chip damage from hazards, as it repeatedly wants to pivot in and out of the field. Thus, it appreciates hazard control from teammates such as Great Tusk.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Due to its great natural bulk, unique defensive typing, and access to Unaware, Skeledirge manages to be a fantastic defensive presence that is able to stave off the likes of Volcarona, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta. Torch Song is a phenomenal Fire-type STAB move that allows Skeledirge to exert offensive pressure while still providing a defensive backbone. Hex is an incredibly strong and spammable Ghost-type STAB move that synergizes amazingly with Will-O-Wisp; Alluring Voice allows Skeledirge to threaten Roaring Moon and Dragonite in addition to being a respectably strong STAB move with the use of Tera Fairy; Scorching Sands can be considered as it can threaten Heatran and Gouging Fire, as well as being an alternative method of spreading burn. Slack Off lets Skeledirge stay healthy throughout the game, giving it multiple opportunities to switch in on powerful offensive threats such as Iron Moth and Zamazenta. Will-O-Wisp quickly neutralizes physical attackers like Dragonite, in addition to powering up Skeledirge's Hex. Maximizing its HP and Special Defense enables Skeledirge to more reliably check special attackers, notably Volcarona and Latias; conversely, maximizing its HP and Defense turns Skeledirge into an immensely sturdy physical wall, forgoing its reliance on spreading burn by leveraging its raw physical bulk to check potent setup sweepers, particularly Dragonite and Swords Dance Iron Valiant. Tera Fairy provides Skeledirge with a much-appreciated resistance to Dark, allowing it to safely check Pokemon such as Meowscarada and Roaring Moon, in addition to always checking Volcarona regardless of its Tera type; conversely, Tera Water allows Skeledirge to sit in front of powerful wallbreakers, notably Calm Mind Primarina and Gouging Fire, and its neutral defensive profile allows it to safely check Pokemon like Kingambit.</p> <p>Skeledirge fits on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to force progress while staving off opposing threats. It dislikes taking Knock Off due to its reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots, so it appreciates teammates such as Clefable and Skarmory that can safely switch into Knock Off from Weavile and Iron Valiant. Skeledirge also enjoys having Clefable in particular absorb Salt Cure from Garganacl; Clefable also appreciates Skeledirge's reliability in forcing out Galarian Slowking and Iron Moth. Rillaboom and Galarian Slowking are much-appreciated teammates for Skeledirge, as Rillaboom provides Skeledirge with Grassy Terrain to bolster its longevity in addition to forcing out Ogerpon-W that would otherwise threaten it, whereas Galarian Slowking can pivot into and around powerful wallbreakers such as Kyurem and Walking Wake. It also enjoys entry hazard support from Gliscor and Skarmory wearing down Pokemon such as Choice Specs Kyurem that would otherwise threaten Skeledirge and its team. Skarmory also assists Skeledirge in answering Choice Band Rillaboom, which otherwise threatens it with Knock Off, reliably checks Kingambit for it and appreciates having a consistent check to Volcarona and Gouging Fire. Gliscor can spread status with Toxic to power up Skeledirge's Hex and relishes in having a sturdy switch-in to Serperior. Skeledirge also benefits from pairing with fast wallbreakers such as Weavile, Dragapult, and Ogerpon-W, providing them with a sturdy defensive backbone and appreciating having them weaken the opposing team's defenses, as they open up Skeledirge to sweep late-game with Torch Song; it also greatly enjoys pairing with Dragapult in particular, as Dragapult is capable of spreading status effects to a multitude of Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T for Skeledirge to take advantage of with its Hex, as well as handling faster threats such as Roaring Moon and Iron Boulder.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Garganacl's incredible defensive stats and access to Salt Cure make it a potent Curse user, letting it beat threatening physical attackers such as Weavile and Dragon Dance Dragonite while acting as a pseudo-sweeper. Earthquake lets Garganacl hit threats such as Gholdengo, Raging Bolt, and Galarian Slowking, with its high-Base Power giving Garganacl offensive presence so it doesn't have to rely solely on Salt Cure for damage, which is especially useful since Raging Bolt commonly runs Leftovers and Galarian Slowking's Regenerator can mitigate Salt Cure damage as well. 52 Defense EVs lets Garganacl survive Ogerpon-W's Power Whip as well as +1 Protosynthesis-boosted Roaring Moon's Earthquake without the need for Curse boosts or Terastallization. Tera Water turns Garganacl's Water weakness into a resistance, letting it better handle Water-types such as Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott. It also lets Garganacl check offensive Steel-types such as Gholdengo, with Purifying Salt letting it resist Shadow Ball. On the other hand, Tera Fairy gives Garganacl an immunity to Draco Meteor from Dragapult as well as Dragon Pulse from Raging Bolt, in addition to giving it a resistance to Knock Off from the likes of Roaring Moon. It also grants Garganacl a resistance to Fighting-type moves from Pokemon such as Zamazenta and Great Tusk and removes its Grass weakness, improving its matchup against Meowscarada. Both options remove Garganacl's weakness to Ground-type moves, letting it better handle Dragon-types that rely on Earthquake for coverage, such as Gouging Fire and Dragonite.</p> <p>Garganacl fits well on bulky offense or balance teams. Due to not running Heavy-Duty Boots, Garganacl appreciates entry hazard removal from the likes of Great Tusk and Corviknight; Great Tusk in particular appreciates Garganacl checking spinblockers such as Dragapult and, with Tera Water, Gholdengo. Rillaboom makes for a great partner thanks to Garganacl appreciating the recovery from Grassy Terrain, which alleviates entry hazard chip damage, as well as the reduction in Earthquake's damage, letting it check Pokemon like Roaring Moon better. It should be noted that Garganacl's own Earthquake will deal less damage as a result of Grassy Terrain and Salt Cure's chip damage will be mitigated by Grassy Terrain's healing when combined with Leftovers, however. As Substitute blocks Salt Cure, Pokemon that can punish the use of the move, such as Encore Dragonite, Infiltrator Dragapult, and Whirlwind Ting-Lu, are appreciated teammates. Ogerpon-W makes for a great partner with Garganacl thanks to Water Absorb and its ability to force Ground-types like Gliscor out with Ivy Cudgel. It can also punish Substitute with Encore and remove items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off, accentuating the chip damage done by Salt Cure. In exchange, it appreciates Garganacl deterring defensive Pokemon like Skarmory with Salt Cure, as well as its ability to handle Dragon-types like Dragonite and Dragapult. Unaware Clefable forms a good defensive core with Garganacl, denying other setup sweepers the opportunity to set up on Garganacl while also appreciating its ability to absorb status from Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Dragapult and Skeledirge. Garganacl also benefits from Clefable's ability to check Ting-Lu. Opposing Clefable can check Garganacl with both of its abilities, so Pokemon that can dispatch it, like Gholdengo and Heatran, make for good partners. Garganacl also enjoys Knock Off and hazard support, as the removal of items like Heavy-Duty Boots and the additional chip from hazards makes it harder to play around due to the chip damage from Salt Cure having more of an impact on Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Alomomola, and Ting-Lu. Gliscor has access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Knock Off while also resisting Ground-type moves; in exchange, Garganacl checks Hex Dragapult, one of Gliscor's best checks. Finally, specially defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking and Clodsire appreciate Garganacl's physical walling capabilities while making up for its inability to consistently handle special attackers like Primarina and Enamorus.</p>"

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<p>Garganacl is an exceptional Stealth Rock setter and wall thanks to its great bulk, amazing ability in Purifying Salt, and access to Salt Cure. As a setter, Garganacl is very good at outlasting and pressuring common removal options like non-Leftovers Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Iron Treads with Salt Cure. Protect also stalls turns, which works well in conjunction with Salt Cure and allows Garganacl to chip its foes as much as possible; it's also useful at scouting moves from foes such as Choice Band Roaring Moon, Rillaboom, and Meowscarada and maximizing passive recovery from Leftovers. 52 Defense EVs allow Garganacl to survive Ogerpon-W's Power Whip and +1 Protosynthesis Roaring Moon's Earthquake, and the rest of the EVs are invested in HP and Special Defense to maximize its special bulk to help it take on threats such as Dragapult, Kyurem, and Volcarona in a better fashion. Tera Fairy enables it to handle threats such as Zamazenta, Great Tusk, Roaring Moon, and Dragapult better; in addition, the Grass neutrality helps it against foes like Rillaboom, Ogerpon-W, and Meowscarada. Tera Water helps it against foes like Gholdengo, Earthquake Gouging Fire, and Water-types like Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott. Both of these Tera types are useful at handling non-Swords Dance Gliscor as well, as Garganacl also acts as a Toxic absorber.</p> <p>Garganacl fits well on bulky offense and balance teams that need a bulky entry hazard setter; Salt Cure is great at making progress for its teammates to capitalize on. Setup sweepers such as Kingambit, Weavile, and Nasty Plot Gholdengo appreciate Garganacl's ability to chip and force damage on the opposing team with Stealth Rock and Salt Cure, especially against threats such as Skarmory and Primarina. In return, they offensively pressure Garganacl's switch-ins such as Galarian Slowking, Rillaboom, and Clefable, as it's reliant on Salt Cure for damage and is thus very passive. Gholdengo also deserves a special mention because of its ability to block hazard removal attempts from foes like Great Tusk and Corviknight. Garganacl also forms amazing cores with Spikes setters such as Gliscor, Hisuian Samurott, and Skarmory, further helping its offensive teammates by dominating the hazard game. Moreover, Gliscor and Skarmory also help it in checking Ground- and Fighting-types like Landorus-T and Zamazenta. Knock Off users such as Clefable and the aforementioned Weavile are also good teammates due to removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Galarian Slowking and Dondozo; removing Leftovers from foes like Zamazenta and Ting-Lu is also useful so that they take maximum damage from Salt Cure and Stealth Rock. In addition, Clefable and the aforementioned Gliscor also support Garganacl by acting as Knock Off absorbers, as Garganacl likes to keep its Leftovers intact—Protect and Leftovers form a strong combination that makes Garganacl very tough to break down. Galarian Slowking also makes a great partner that supports Garganacl with Future Sight, punishing Fighting-types such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant, as well as providing pivoting support with Chilly Reception. Garganacl also appreciates hazard removal support, as its foes such as Gliscor, Clefable, and Ting-Lu may use it as fodder for setting up hazards, especially Spikes; as such, Pokemon like Great Tusk make nice teammates. Due to its relatively poor base typing, Garganacl is weak to a variety of threats including Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Kingambit, and Ogerpon-W; thus, partners such as Ogerpon-W, Skeledirge, Zamazenta, and Dragapult, respectively, are appreciated. Rillaboom also synergizes well with Garganacl, as its Grassy Terrain can weaken Earthquake from foes like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor for Garganacl as well as helping it deal with Pokemon like Ogerpon-W and Barraskewda; in return, Garganacl supports Rillaboom with hazard and deals with foes like Gouging Fire and Iron Moth for it.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Glimmora is one of the tier's premier leads thanks to its ability to set up Stealth Rock and deny opposing entry hazards with Mortal Spin, all while scaring foes from activating Toxic Debris in the process. Toxic Debris's potential to set up Toxic Spikes can prove lethal against certain teams, particularly more offensive ones due to the lack of offensive Poison-types in OU able to absorb them. Mortal Spin's side effect of inflicting poison detracts Pokemon such as Ting-Lu from setting up entry hazards multiple times and Hatterene from trying to deny Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce. Power Gem lets Glimmora hit most targets for decent damage, and notably chips at Corviknight, Skarmory, and Gliscor that would otherwise wall Glimmora, with Corviknight also removing its entry hazards with Defog. Earth Power allows Glimmora to hit Steel-types such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Heatran, which otherwise are able to block Mortal Spin, with the former two also resisting Power Gem. Mud Shot is another option over Earth Power, as its side effect of lowering the foe's Speed allows Glimmora to win the mirror matchup against opposing Glimmora. Mud Shot can also slow down foes trying to use Glimmora as setup fodder, such as Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon, preventing them from getting out of hand. Focus Sash allows Glimmora to live any one hit and thus be able to set up Stealth Rock safely. Tera Ghost grants Glimmora with an immunity to Rapid Spin from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads, denying their attempts from removing Glimmora's entry hazards.</p> <p>Glimmora finds its home on hyper offense teams that enjoy it starting the match strong by setting up Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes from the beginning. Kingambit greatly appreciates this, as even Pokemon that resist Sucker Punch like Roaring Moon and Enamorus can potentially get KOed by +2 Sucker Punch after a round or two of Stealth Rock, while physically defensive walls trying to switch in like Skarmory and Corviknight have to contend with not only Kingambit's attacks but also with the chip damage from Stealth Rock. Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant similarly enjoy Glimmora's entry hazards chipping at the foes for them and the rest of the team to win late-game, while they also provide Knock Off support to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Dondozo, Alomomola, and Clodsire, making them susceptible to its hazards. Gholdengo may be used alongside Glimmora, as its Ghost typing and Good as Gold ability let it block Rapid Spin and Defog attempts, thus making sure Glimmora's entry hazards stay up. Glimmora may also play a defensive role on occasion, as its good matchup against Skeledirge lets it assist teammates like Volcarona and Zamazenta that can struggle against it.</p>"

      "Offensive Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Kingambit is the premier offensive Pokemon in OU, with potent wallbreaking and sweeping potential thanks to its high Attack bolstered by Supreme Overlord and Swords Dance. It has excellent natural bulk and the ability to Terastallize to either maximize damage output or gain defensive advantages against its checks. Its strong Sucker Punch makes it one of the best anti-offense tools in the metagame. Kingambit can use Kowtow Cleave for a more consistent Dark-type attack than Sucker Punch. Iron Head gives coverage against Dark-resistant Pokemon, notably Clefable, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta. Low Kick can be used over Kowtow Cleave or Iron Head to beat opposing Kingambit, although dropping Iron Head for Low Kick leaves Kingambit walled by Fairy-types, while dropping Kowtow Cleave leaves Kingambit walled by Skeledirge and Toxapex and stuck with the less reliable Sucker Punch as its only Dark-type move. Kingambit's item slot is very flexible depending on the needs of the team; Black Glasses is the best item on Kingambit to stack with Supreme Overlord and potentially Tera Dark; Air Balloon can be used to gain setup opportunities on Ground-types like Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Landorus-T; Lum Berry is an option to absorb otherwise crippling status from Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Dragapult, and Cinderace; and Heavy-Duty Boots is an option on teams with either no or unreliable entry hazard control to keep Kingambit from being worn down by Spikes early-game. Tera Dark powers up Sucker Punch and Kowtow Cleave while removing Kingambit's weaknesses to Fire- and Ground-type moves. In combination with Black Glasses and +2 Attack, it allows Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave to OHKO physical walls such as Alomomola, Gliscor, and Garganacl. Additionally, Kowtow Cleave 2HKOes Dondozo, while +2 Sucker Punch OHKOes Roaring Moon, opposing offensive Kingambit after Spikes, and Hisuian Samurott. Tera Flying allows Kingambit to set up on Ground- and Fighting-types such as Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Zamazenta. Tera Fighting can be used with Low Kick to always OHKO defensive Great Tusk at +2 with five Supreme Overlord boosts and a layer of Spikes, and it can 3HKO Dondozo with five Supreme Overlord boosts. Tera Fighting also provides more setup opportunities than Tera Dark, with the advantage of shedding Kingambit's weakness to Fighting-type attacks. Tera Ghost can be used to completely nullify its severe Fighting weakness, most notably letting it overwhelm an otherwise decent check in IronPress Skarmory one-on-one. Aside from granting a Fire resistance, Tera Fire is another alternative that most importantly prevents Kingambit from being crippled by Flame Body and Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon like Volcarona, Heatran, Dragapult, and Cinderace, especially for non-Lum Berry variants. An Adamant nature is preferred to maximize the power of Sucker Punch to break through bulky Pokemon. Jolly can be run over Adamant to win the Low Kick Kingambit mirror matchup against Adamant variants and outspeed some variants of IronPress Skarmory and Corviknight before they can boost Defense. However, the power drop from losing out on Adamant limits Kingambit in all other matchups, especially when Sucker Punch nullifies Adamant's speed drop anyway; Jolly Kingambit cannot OHKO Dragapult with Sucker Punch unboosted, and even with five Supreme Overlord boosts, it cannot 3HKO Dondozo without Black Glasses or Tera Dark.</p> <p>Kingambit fits on offensive and bulky offense teams that appreciate its defensive profile and capabilities as a revenge killer and late-game sweeper, being able to defensively check non-Focus Blast Gholdengo, Choice Specs Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Weavile without Low Kick. Offensively, Kingambit can revenge kill a wide range of Pokemon, including Deoxys-S, Dragapult, and Kyurem while also being able to revenge kill anything without Substitute, Encore, or strong neutral priority, given enough chip damage. Roaring Moon is an excellent partner for Kingambit, overloading Dark-resistant foes and physical walls for each other and paving the way for one of them to break through and end the game. On bulky offense teams, Spikes setters like Skarmory and Gliscor synergize well with Kingambit. Spikes Gliscor in particular provides a highly valuable and resilient Ground immunity and Fighting resistance, and its Toxic also synergizes with Sucker Punch, helping to ease prediction by putting opposing Pokemon on a turn limit. On offensive teams, hazard setters such as Glimmora, Deoxys-S, and Hisuian Samurott help Kingambit break through foes that resist its moves, especially Great Tusk variants without Heavy-Duty Boots, which can be forced to take hazard chip early on. Kingambit can also be used alongside dual screens Deoxys-S and Alolan Ninetales, making it easier to set up and providing a highly valuable Dragapult check to the dual screens team. Rillaboom can support Kingambit with Grassy Surge, giving it easier setup opportunities with extra HP and weakening Earthquake from Gliscor, Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Ting-Lu. Rillaboom can also switch into Ogerpon-W, Great Tusk, and Dondozo and remove Rocky Helmet from Skarmory and Corviknight with Knock Off. Galarian Slowking appreciates Kingambit resisting Ghost- and Dark-type attacks aimed at it. In return, it supports Kingambit with Future Sight to break through Great Tusk, Zamazenta, Dondozo, Alomomola, and Skarmory while also switching into Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Zamazenta for Kingambit. Gholdengo is a great teammate for Kingambit, being able to handle threats like Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, Skarmory, Corviknight, Substitute Iron Boulder, and Dondozo while checking Rillaboom and Dragonite, which can punish its Sucker Punch with priority. It also softens opposing teams for Kingambit to finish off using Gholdengo's own wallbreaking capabilities and excellence in keeping entry hazards on the field. Volcarona is another excellent partner for Kingambit, countering Skarmory, Zamazenta without Stone Edge, and Iron Valiant. It also sometimes punishes other Kingambit checks in Great Tusk, Low Kick Weavile and Meowscarada, and Dragonite with Flame Body, turning them into setup fodder for Kingambit.</p>"

      "Bulky Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>By investing in bulk, Kingambit gains more setup opportunities and the ability to act as a short-term blanket check for much of the metagame; it also is an effective late-game cleaner. Kingambit can be used to absorb hits throughout the game from Pokemon like Dragapult, as well as Gholdengo and Weavile if they aren't running Fighting-type coverage. Iron Head destroys many of the Fairy-types in the tier, including Enamorus, Clefable, and Hatterene. Tera Blast Fairy is a surprising pick that can take on bulky Fighting-types, including Great Tusk and Zamazenta. Low Kick provides solid coverage for opposing Kingambit as well as maintaining a strong option into Pokemon like Roaring Moon and Ting-Lu. However, without Iron Head, Kingambit struggles with the matchup against Fairy-types. Kingambit makes good use of both Leftovers to increase its longevity late-game and Heavy-Duty Boots to avoid entry hazard damage and continue switching in to keep pressure on. Tera Flying gives Kingambit a resistance to Fighting and an immunity to Ground, allowing it to set up on Great Tusk and Landorus-T, whereas Tera Fairy not only assists Kingambit defensively by giving it a Fighting resistance and a good defensive spread but also gives it access to Tera Blast Fairy to add to its coverage. 44 Speed EVs make Kingambit faster than Blissey, and the remaining 212 EVs not invested in Attack are put into HP, increasing its bulk. Alternatively, Kingambit's HP EVs can be raised to increase bulk, dropping Speed down to 4 EVs, which outruns uninvested Iron Hands, Ursaluna, and Azumarill.</p> <p>Bulky Kingambit is excellent on offense and balance teams as both a powerful late game setup sweeper and a form of speed control. Alongside more passive bulky Pokemon, such as Gliscor and Skarmory, Kingambit helps the team make more progress and break through tougher threats; in return, they can chip down Great Tusk with Toxic or Rocky Helmet damage. These Pokemon also set up entry hazards, which assist with wallbreaking. Slower teams appreciate the priority Kingambit provides, and Pokemon like Gholdengo and Kyurem also appreciate Kingambit's ability to switch into Dragon- and Ghost-type attacks from Dragapult and opposing Gholdengo. Great Tusk can weaken Gliscor, Landorus-T, and opposing Great Tusk for Kingambit while also being able to  remove Skarmory's Rocky Helmet with Knock Off. In return, Great Tusk appreciates bulky Kingambit being able to switch in on Pokemon like Hatterene and Clefable that force Great Tusk out. Kingambit benefits from teammates with the ability to pivot and get it in safely, such as Meowscarada and Galarian Slowking. Galarian Slowking also supports Kingambit by setting up Future Sight, which is difficult for foes to switch in on at the same time as Kowtow Cleave, as it forces special and physical damage on the same turn; only Dark-types resist both, and they struggle to take Kingambit's coverage moves. Kingambit in turn helps Galarian Slowking by resisting Dark and Ghost and switching in on Gholdengo and Dragapult. Kingambit can form a Dark-type spam core with Roaring Moon or Weavile, as they can assist in beating down Dondozo, Skarmory, and Great Tusk. Rillaboom helps Kingambit by removing its Earthquake weakness and providing passive recovery from Grassy Terrain. Due to its lower special bulk, Kingambit can be vulnerable to wallbreakers like Volcarona and Walking Wake. Having teammates more suited to taking hits from such Pokemon, like Galarian Slowking and Toxapex, is a good solution. Combining Kingambit's power with the power of Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Gholdengo is another way to boost a team's wallbreaking potential. Gholdengo's ability allows it to keep hazards up, helping Kingambit keep pressure up. Both Pokemon defensively check Pokemon that threaten the other; Gholdengo checks Fighting-types like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta, while Kingambit checks Ghost-types like Dragapult and other Gholdengo. Iron Valiant and Kingambit both have powerful speed control and support each other by weakening their shared checks, like Gliscor and Volcarona. Kingambit is also useful against Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo, which Iron Valiant forces in.</p>"

      "Offensive Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>Bulk Up Great Tusk with Booster Energy's Speed boost is a potent physical setup sweeper that is capable of providing valuable utility to its team, as its access to Rapid Spin and its natural bulk allows it to check key threats such as Dragonite, Kingambit, and Gouging Fire. Bulk Up leverages Great Tusk's natural bulk to give it setup opportunities against many of the common physical attackers in the tier, such as Kingambit and Zamazenta. Headlong Rush is a brutally powerful option for a Ground-type STAB move and is not weakened by Grassy Terrain. Alternatively, Earthquake can be run if Headlong Rush's low PP and Defense drops prove to be problematic, but misses out on benchmarks like the potential OHKO on Dragapult and Iron Valiant at +1. Ice Spinner allows Great Tusk to hit Grass- and Flying-types such as Serperior, Gliscor, and Enamorus for super effective damage, which would otherwise wall it or force it out. The last moveslot can be Close Combat for a strong Fighting-type STAB move, guaranteeing the OHKO on bulky Kingambit, threatening huge damage on Kyurem and Ting-Lu, and punishing switch-ins like Skarmory and Corviknight with heavy damage; Rapid Spin, which lets it remove hazards and provides it with further boosts to its Speed, preventing otherwise faster threats like Deoxys-S and Booster Energy Iron Valiant from revenge killing it; or Knock Off, which deals with Air Balloon Gholdengo as well as crippling its checks like Dondozo. The EV spread listed is necessary for Great Tusk to attain a Speed boost from Protosynthesis from Booster Energy; however, Leftovers can be used instead should Great Tusk be used on sun. Tera Poison is the premier defensive Tera type for Great Tusk, allowing it to set up on Gliscor's Toxic and completely wall Rillaboom and Zamazenta alongside avoiding a KO and thus granting it an extra turn against Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Conversely, Tera Ice is a strong choice for an offensive Tera type that provides Great Tusk with STAB on Ice Spinner, which can net OHKOs on Gliscor and offensive Zapdos after a boost from Bulk Up. Tera Steel can also be considered as an alternative to Tera Poison that also lets Great Tusk wall Choice Band Dragapult and Dragon Dance Kyurem, at the cost of being weaker into Cinderace, Zamazenta, and Low Kick Kingambit. Additionally, both Tera Ice and Steel provides an Ice resistance against foes like Weavile and Meowscarada.</p> <p>Great Tusk is commonly seen on offense, hyper offense, and sun structures, which appreciate its entry hazard control and ability to clean teams in late-game scenarios. Great Tusk particularly struggles against physical walls such as Skarmory, Corviknight, and Dondozo. On sun teams, strong special attackers such as Raging Bolt and Walking Wake can easily force these Pokemon out and can soften up the opposing team for Great Tusk to sweep in the mid- or late-game. In return, Great Tusk provides key hazard control and switches into powerful physical threats such as Kingambit. Additionally, it can easily shatter common checks to both Walking Wake and Raging Bolt, particularly Clodsire and Galarian Slowking. Hatterene on sun teams and Choice Scarf Enamorus on weatherless offense can support Great Tusk with Healing Wish and can threaten some of its checks, notably Gliscor, Deoxys-S, and Zamazenta. Hatterene also alleviates the need for Great Tusk to run Rapid Spin, freeing up the last moveslot for more offensively oriented options such as Close Combat and Knock Off. Outside of sun, Rillaboom provides Great Tusk with passive recovery without relying on Leftovers and can force out or KO the likes of Primarina and Dondozo. In return, Great Tusk can act as a mid- or late-game sweeper once the opposing team is sufficiently weakened and can threaten Pokemon such as Archaludon that Rillaboom struggles against. Volcarona and Dragonite appreciate the utility of Great Tusk's Rapid Spin and its ability to consistently threaten Skeledirge. In exchange, Volcarona can act as a reliable check to Weavile and Iron Valiant, while Dragonite can handle opposing Volcarona and Ogerpon-W. Lastly, Kingambit enjoys having Great Tusk beating its checks like opposing Great Tusk one-to-one with its own setup, allowing it to more easily sweep late-game.</p>"

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Great Tusk is a great Pokemon in the OU metagame due to its role compression, entry hazard removal, offensive and defensive typing, and bulk, enabling it to check a variety of top-tier threats like Kingambit, Gliscor, and Gholdengo. It is the best hazard remover in the tier and can threaten common hazard setters and spinblockers such as Landorus-T, Glimmora, and Dragapult. Headlong Rush OHKOes offensive Kingambit and is not weakened under Grassy Terrain unlike Earthquake. Do be aware of the drawbacks though; lowering both of Great Tusk's defenses opens it up to an OHKO from Weavile's Triple Axel. Ice Spinner hits Flying-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor and Dragon-types like Dragonite and Hydrapple. Knock Off disrupts foes that switch in and makes progress by removing items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots. Temper Flare can be used over this to ease prediction against Air Balloon Gholdengo. If it attempts to block Rapid Spin, Temper Flare's power doubles next turn, enabling Great Tusk to OHKO it. Temper Flare also serves as strong coverage in general if used under sun. Rapid Spin provides hazard removal while boosting Great Tusk's Speed. Heavy-Duty Boots makes Great Tusk's job of removing hazards easier, as it ignores the chip damage as well as the Speed drop from Sticky Web, allowing it to switch in more times to make progress. Leftovers is an alternative option, giving Great Tusk healing over time. However, it leaves Great Tusk weak to hazard chip, potentially resulting in it taking massive damage on switch-in and being poisoned. Booster Energy can be used on more offensive teams that care less about longevity, making it easier for Great Tusk to remove hazards thanks to its stronger offensive presence. This EV spread gives it an Attack boost in sun or when running Booster Energy. Tera Ground powers up Headlong Rush, allowing it to OHKO maximum Defense Gholdengo, and it also keeps Great Tusk's Electric immunity. Tera Steel can help Great Tusk check Gliscor by providing it with an immunity to Toxic, and it can 2HKO Gliscor with Ice Spinner without being chipped. Tera Steel gives Great Tusk a multitude of resistances that were prior weaknesses, like Fairy, Psychic, Grass, and Ice, which helps it to check Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Weavile. Tera Fire also gives it notable resistances to Fairy, checking Iron Valiant, and Grass, resisting Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. It also provides a burn immunity, which helps check Cinderace.</p> <p>Great Tusk works well on offensive structures due to its entry hazard removal capabilities, which can help teammates weak to them come in more easily; it also guarantees progress with Knock Off. If used on sun teams, Great Tusk helps support the Stealth Rock-weak Torkoal, enabling it to switch in and set sun more times, as well as being a potent wallbreaker itself with the power boost it gets in the sun. Great Tusk pairs well with Choice-locked wallbreakers and Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Enamorus, Kyurem, and Gouging Fire, as they appreciate the hazard removal so they can switch in more reliably. Great Tusk also pairs well with Kingambit, as the hazard removal lets it run Leftovers for more longevity or an offensive item like Black Glasses to hit harder. Great Tusk struggles to repeatedly switch into attacks, as it doesn't have access to passive recovery other than Leftovers, which can be removed, and the offensive nature of this set means it doesn't take hits well. Ogerpon-W is a good partner for Great Tusk, as it provides a Water immunity and benefits from Great Tusk's hazard removal to switch in more frequently. In return, Great Tusk's Ice Spinner threatens the Dragon-types that Ogerpon-W struggles with. Great Tusk is generally weak to special attackers thanks to its measly Special Defense. Partners like Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Primarina can patch up this weakness by checking special threats like Iron Valiant and Volcarona, and their typings synergize well with Great Tusk. In return, Great Tusk's hazard removal lets them wall these threats more consistently.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its gargantuan Defense in tandem with a plethora of utility options and a great defensive typing, Great Tusk makes for a premier defensive presence, checking notable threats like Kingambit, Gouging Fire, and Dragonite. Stealth Rock, in tandem with Rapid Spin, makes Great Tusk a dominant choice for entry hazard control, being able to threaten Pokemon immune to Rapid Spin like Gholdengo and Dragapult with Earthquake or Knock Off while also being able to set up Stealth Rock in the face of aforementioned physical threats. Alternatively, Bulk Up makes Great Tusk more consistently able to check foes like Choice Band Roaring Moon, Iron Boulder, Choice Band Zamazenta, and especially Kingambit. Knock Off punishes common switch ins like Corviknight, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Zapdos and breaks through Ghost-types like Dragapult. Alternatively, Ice Spinner provides solid coverage for Flying- and Ground-types like Gliscor, Enamorus, and Tera Flying Kingambit. 36 Speed EVs lets Great Tusk outspeed Jolly maximum Speed Kingambit. Tera Water provides Great Tusk means of resisting Water-type attacks from the likes of Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott while also removing its weaknesses to Fairy and Flying. Alternatively, Tera Steel turns its weaknesses to Grass and Ice into resistances, giving Great Tusk stronger utility against the likes of Meowscarada, Serperior, and Rillaboom. Leftovers gives Great Tusk better longevity, while Heavy-Duty Boots bolsters Great Tusk's role as hazard control.</p> <p>Great Tusk fits best on balance and bulky offense teams as a premier choice for entry hazard control, in addition to acting as a strong check towards the likes of Kingambit and Gouging Fire. Pokemon that heavily benefit from hazard removal, namely Raging Bolt and Gouging Fire, heavily appreciate Great Tusk's capability of shedding entry hazards with ease while being able to take advantage of the Water- and Grass-type Pokemon that threaten Great Tusk. Air Balloon Gholdengo poses a major threat to Great Tusk without Knock Off, as it can otherwise switch in with ease and overwhelm Great Tusk with Shadow Ball. As a result, Kingambit makes for a solid partner to Great Tusk thanks to its strong ability to check non-Focus Blast Gholdengo, as well as Serperior, Meowscarada, and Dragapult. Defensive Great Tusk also doubles as a solid Kingambit answer, meaning that Pokemon that would otherwise be overwhelmed by Kingambit such as Dragapult and Gholdengo make for solid partners. The latter also blocks attempts at removing Stealth Rock from the likes of Corviknight and opposing Great Tusk.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Scream Tail's gargantuan bulk and access to utility moves such as Wish and Encore make it a potent support Pokemon. Its defensive typing and high Speed make it a good answer to Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Walking Wake. Dazzling Gleam is this set's only attacking move, letting it hit Pokemon like Great Tusk, Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Iron Valiant and prevents it from being shut down by Taunt from Pokemon like Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and Greninja. Wish gives Scream Tail a recovery move while letting it heal teammates such as Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Hatterene that lack reliable recovery and are vulnerable to being overwhelmed by repeated hits. Protect synergizes well with Wish, making it much more reliable as a recovery move. Additionally, Protect scouts the intentions of Choice-locked Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Hisuian Zoroark. Encore prevents setup sweepers like Volcarona, Calm Mind Iron Valiant, and Bulk Up Great Tusk from using Scream Tail as a setup opportunity, letting Scream Tail's teammates switch in and take advantage of these threats. It can also be used to annoy passive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Dondozo. Tera Fairy gives Scream Tail better matchups against Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Hisuian Zoroark, with the former two being susceptible to being OHKOed by Dazzling Gleam. Alternatively, Tera Water lets Scream Tail maintain a solid defensive typing while also helping it check Walking Wake, Skeledirge, and Greninja. With a Timid nature, 152 Speed EVs let Scream Tail outspeed Hydreigon, while 236 Special Defense EVs ensure that Scream Tail gets a Special Defense boost with Protosynthesis under sun, letting it more easily take on threats such as Walking Wake and Iron Valiant. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 84 SpD / 172 Spe with a Calm nature lets Scream Tail outspeed unboosted Great Tusk and pass beefier Wishes.</p> <p>Scream Tail fits on many sun, balance, and stall teams thanks to its bulk, ability to pass Wish to teammates, and create momentum with Encore. Bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo make for good teammates, as they are able to check Greninja and Ceruledge, respectively. Moreover, Toxapex also checks Pokemon like Iron Moth and Glimmora as well as spread status, making Encore much more of a detriment to setup sweepers like Volcarona and Iron Valiant, while Dondozo blanket checks physically oriented Pokemon that can overwhelm Scream Tail, namely Booster Energy Roaring Moon and Ceruledge. Entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for excellent teammates, as a lack of hazards means that Scream Tail can accomplish feats such as surviving two Choice Specs Greninja Hydro Pumps from full HP. Additionally, Great Tusk appreciates Wish support in order to more consistently check Scream Tail answers such as Kingambit. Torkoal is a great teammate thanks to its sun activating Scream Tail's Protosynthesis. In addition, Torkoal very much appreciates Wish support in order to more consistently check Pokemon like Kingambit. Meanwhile, Scream Tail is able to sponge special attacks from the likes of Walking Wake. Under sun, Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Ceruledge, and Brute Bonnet appreciate Scream Tail facilitating their sweeps with its combination of Encore and Wish, keeping them healthy while leveraging setup opportunities for them. Hydreigon is another excellent offensive partner, checking Gholdengo and finding more opportunities to set up Substitute thanks to Scream Tail's Wish.</p>"

Its Steel typing blocks Mortal Spin from Glimmora, and it naturally outspeeds Landorus-T, which can use Taunt to prevent hazards from slower leads. Iron Treads can also drop Stealth Rock for Volt Switch, changing its role from a hazard lead to an offensive pivot that can pivot out against Pokemon like Ogerpon-W that otherwise would use it as setup fodder while keeping Rapid Spin utility. Ice Spinner allows Iron Treads to hit Gliscor and Landorus-T, while Iron Head can be used instead to deal with Pokemon like Kyurem, Enamorus, Hatterene, and Tera Fairy Raging Bolt. Booster Energy's Speed boost allows Iron Treads to set Stealth Rock against Deoxys-S, grants it more opportunities to use Rapid Spin, and allows it to pick off various otherwise faster Pokemon, notably Cinderace, which could otherwise use Court Change before Iron Treads could attack. Alternatively, Eject Button can be used on teams for additional momentum at the cost of effectiveness in the hazard game, Tera Ghost gives Iron Treads an immunity to Fighting and Normal, blanking Fighting-type moves that would otherwise KO it, including Close Combat from Iron Boulder and Iron Valiant, and preventing Rapid Spin from Great Tusk, opposing Iron Treads, and Torkoal to keep its hazards.</p> <p>Iron Treads is an excellent teammate on offensive teams, such as sun and rain, that can support various sweepers by denying entry hazards, setting its own hazards, or pivoting. It also checks Raging Bolt lacking Weather Ball. Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragapult provide Rapid Spin immunities, strengthening the team's advantage in the hazard game, while also checking Iron Defense Zamazenta, a dangerous sweeper that can easily find setup opportunities on Iron Treads. Alongside these Ghost-types, Fairy-, Grass-, and Water-type Pokemon that outspeed Great Tusk including Iron Valiant, Serperior, and Ogerpon-W can be used to prevent Great Tusk from using Rapid Spin without burning Tera, and they also appreciate Iron Treads's ability to keep hazards off the field, as they can't afford to use Heavy-Duty Boots on most teams. Kingambit is also a good teammate, as it is a hyper offense staple and appreciates Iron Treads enabling the offense of its teammates for Kingambit to clean up late-game. Setup sweepers with Knock Off like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W increase the effectiveness of Stealth Rock by removing items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers to assist teammates with breaking through walls such as Dondozo and Garganacl. When using Volt Switch or Eject Button, Iron Treads is excellent on rain teams, checking Raging Bolt and Dragapult and ensuring Pelipper and Barraskewda can pivot in and out freely to use the limited turns of rain are used to the fullest extent. It can also serve a similar role on sun teams, checking Raging Bolt and Glimmora while being able to regain the momentum that Torkoal loses and providing a second hazard remover.</p>"

Hurricane destroys many offensive Pokemon that can take Dark Pulse, including Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Quaquaval, and Volcarona. Taunt allows Iron Jugulis to function as a dangerous stallbreaker by shutting down passive walls such as Clodsire, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu. It also prevents Slowking from pivoting with Chilly Reception and threats such as Dragonite, Volcarona, Polteageist, and Roaring Moon from setting up. Flamethrower hits Steel-types such as Corviknight, Kingambit, and Iron Treads. Fire Blast trades some of Flamethrower's accuracy for more power, most notably OHKOing the aforementioned Steel-types with Tera Fire. Alternatively, Earth Power OHKOes Iron Moth and lands a stronger hit on Clodsire, Garganacl, Cinderace, Iron Hands, and Toxapex. Tera Dark boosts the power of Dark Pulse, making it easier to pressure walls such as Garganacl, Rotom-W, and Toxapex with its flinch chance. Tera Flying strengthens Hurricane, OHKOing Greninja, Amoonguss, and Cinderace most of the time and 2HKOing Toxapex, Dondozo, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge. Tera Fire strengthens Flamethrower or Fire Blast and gives Iron Jugulis crucial resistances to Iron Valiant's Moonblast.</p> <p>Iron Jugulis is best used on hyper offense teams that appreciate its ability to trouble stall teams and keep fast sweepers in check. Due to its only decent power, Iron Jugulis greatly appreciates entry hazards from teammates such as Glimmora, Greninja, Meowscarada, and Garchomp to wear down its checks. Additionally, Iron Jugulis's Stealth Rock weakness makes entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads very valuable partners; they can also pressure Clodsire and Iron Moth to free up Iron Jugulis to run a Fire-type move. Powerful wallbreakers such as Breloom and Dragapult can soften up the opposing team for Iron Jugulis to clean up late-game. Conversely, Iron Jugulis's ability to break through special walls with Taunt opens up other special sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Iron Moth. Gholdengo can also cripple walls with Choice item + Trick and handle Booster Energy Iron Valiant, one of the only threats capable of outspeeding and threatening Iron Jugulis. Iron Jugulis is also effective on rain teams, providing it with a perfectly-accurate Hurricane and featuring extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Floatzel and Walking Wake that can punch holes for it to sweep late-game. In return, Iron Jugulis threatens Amoonguss and provides a valuable Ghost resistance to take on threats such as Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark more easily.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its ability Good as Gold and excellent defensive typing that lets it set up on Pokemon like Enamorus, Galarian Slowking, and Clefable, Nasty Plot Gholdengo is a premier wallbreaker in SV OU. While Recover gives Gholdengo a way to stay in the battle for longer and leverage its defensive utility against the aforementioned threats, it also has a range of coverage moves to give it more options for wallbreaking. Psyshock is useful for breaking through special walls that would otherwise give Gholdengo trouble, like Blissey and Clodsire, and Focus Blast hits the many Dark-types in the tier, such as Darkrai, Roaring Moon, and Kingambit. Recover is generally used on bulkier teams, whereas Psyshock and Focus Blast are more useful for teams leaning towards offense. The Ground immunity granted by Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to set up in the face of Ground-types like Gliscor and Great Tusk, even spinblocking the latter in a pinch. Heavy-Duty Boots is another option on teams that lack any entry hazard removal. Gholdengo can make great use of a wide variety of Tera types, both for offensive and defensive purposes: Tera Fairy or Fighting gives it a sudden resistance to Dark, potentially mitigating the damage from moves like Knock Off, Crunch, and Sucker Punch from Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Kingambit, respectively. Tera Fairy gives it an additional Dragon immunity, whereas Tera Fighting gives Focus Blast an additional STAB boost. Tera Steel can give an additional boost to Make It Rain, as well as lessening the damage of Dark- and Ghost-type attacks from Pokemon like Dragapult.</p> <p>Thanks to Good as Gold, any team can make great use of Gholdengo’s ability to spinblock and prevent Defog, but an offensive team would make the best use of its wallbreaking power. Offensive hazard-stacking cores featuring Pokemon such as Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Deoxys-S can use Gholdengo’s help to keep the pressure on. Powerful Pokemon that take advantage of the switches that Gholdengo forces, like Weavile and Meowscarada with Spikes, as well as other Nasty Plot wallbreakers like Darkrai provide support for Gholdengo to whittle down defensive cores. In addition, other special attackers that have access to utility tools like Knock Off to cripple their shared walls and Pokemon that would otherwise absorb Knock Off, such as Gliscor, Skarmory, Corviknight and Clefable, Darkrai, and Iron Valiant, synergize well with Gholdengo's ability to block all hazard removal. Without using Tera, Gholdengo struggles against the Dark-types that are so common in the tier, such as Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Hisuian Samurott. Having teammates resistant to Dark-type attacks, like Zamazenta and Enamorus, give Gholdengo some extra protection and a way to strike back against them. Even if it's using Air Balloon, having another Ground-immune Pokemon, such as Gliscor or Tornadus-T, is extremely helpful to mitigate that weakness. Gholdengo’s Speed tier is still slightly lacking when compared to the rest of the OU tier, leaving it vulnerable to fast threats such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Weavile. Having some speed control on the team, such as Choice Scarf Enamorus and Meowscarada or priority users like Weavile and Raging Bolt, to counteract these threats is extremely valuable.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Defensive Gholdengo can serve as a bulky spinblocker and powerful setup sweeper in long matches. Its bulk, typing, and access to reliable recovery give it multiple opportunities to pivot into various defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory, Corviknight, Galarian Slowking, and Clefable and make it a more reliable check to key offensive Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Hatterene, and Zamazenta. It can use its increased bulk to more safely set up a Nasty Plot while sustaining itself with Recover. Gholdengo possesses near perfect coverage with its STAB attacks, making it very difficult to respond to. Dazzling Gleam is an option over Make It Rain, as it deals high damage to Dark-types such as Hisuian Samurott, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon after a Nasty Plot boost. 60 Speed EVs allow Gholdengo to outspeed Jolly Kingambit and Azumarill, as well as uninvested Landorus-T; alternatively, 92 Speed EVs can allow Gholdengo to also outspeed uninvested Gliscor at the cost of losing a noticeable amount of bulk. Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to avoid taking Spikes damage and Ground-type attacks from prominent Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Gliscor, letting it setup on these Pokemon and more safely pivot into Rapid Spin users such as the aforementioned Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Alternatively, Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to more reliably mitigate entry hazard damage and more frequently pivot into various defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory even after it has taken damage. Gholdengo is a fantastic Terastallization candidate in most matches, as it greatly benefits from neutralizing all of its weaknesses to gain a crucial free turn to setup a Nasty Plot or heal itself with Recover. Tera Fairy gives Gholdengo a better matchup against various Dark-types such as Roaring Moon, Weavile, and Meowscarada and boosts the power of Dazzling Gleam. Tera Flying lets it completely dominate Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu. Tera Water is an alternative option, improving Gholdengo's matchups against Heatran, Cinderace, and Volcarona, as well as Water-types such as Barraskewda and Walking Wake.</p> <p>Gholdengo fits quite well on bulky offense and balance teams as a spinblocker. Therefore, Spikes setters such as Ting-Lu, Gliscor, and Skarmory, as well as Stealth Rock setters such as Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Landorus-T greatly appreciate Gholdengo's ability to block most forms of hazard removal. Offensive teammates also appreciate Gholdengo's presence due to its strong defensive profile and ability to absorb status moves. Kingambit in particular greatly benefits from Gholdengo's ability to block status moves and check Pokemon it struggles against such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant and can capitalize on Gholdengo luring and weakening its other checks such as Great Tusk. Iron Valiant similarly benefits from Gholdengo's ability to check Hatterene, and it can lure and weaken key checks to Gholdengo such as Clodsire and Volcarona with Psyshock. Gholdengo often struggles against offensive teams due to its poor matchup against many key threats such as Volcarona, Gouging Fire, Darkrai, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon. Great Tusk and Dondozo can help alleviate pressure by dealing with Kingambit and Gouging Fire while simultaneously benefiting from Gholdengo's defensive profile against faster special attackers such as Kyurem and Enamorus. Ting-Lu and Clodsire can handle the special attackers that give Gholdengo trouble, such as Volcarona and Dragapult, and accentuate Gholdengo's threat level with entry hazards. While Gholdengo is excellent at keeping entry hazards on the field, it can often struggle against opposing entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Clodsire, particularly if it is unable to Terastallize. Therefore, hazard removal support from Great Tusk is beneficial.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Gholdengo is a great speed control option in the tier capable of outrunning and revenge killing premier offensive threats like Dragapult, Choice Specs Enamorus, and Kyurem. Shadow Ball allows it to threaten foes like Galarian Slowking, Skarmory, and Dragapult, while Make It Rain, with its high Base Power, not only becomes challenging to switch into but also enables Gholdengo to effectively revenge kill Pokemon like Kyurem and Enamorus. Trick is a good utility move that allows it to Choice-lock Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Gliscor, and Archaludon, hampering their effectiveness. Focus Blast enables Gholdengo to hit Dark-types like Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, and Ting-Lu. Alternatively, Nasty Plot can be used to turn Gholdengo into a potent late-game cleaner once it has successfully used Trick to get rid of its Choice Scarf. In another vein, Recover can be utilized to keep Gholdengo healthy, especially against bulkier foes, once it has used Trick, allowing it to check them more consistently. Tera Fighting gives Gholdengo a resistance to Dark-type moves, most notably Sucker Punch from Kingambit, and it gives Focus Blast a STAB boost. Alternatively, Tera Flying can be used to help Gholdengo against Ground-types like Great Tusk and Gliscor.</p> <p>Gholdengo fits well on bulky offense and balance teams, where it functions as a great revenge killer. Teammates that benefit from Gholdengo's presence include Pokemon that appreciate its ability to handle fast and strong offensive threats. For instance, setup sweepers like Calm Mind Raging Bolt and Bulk Up Great Tusk can capitalize on Gholdengo's ability to revenge kill and weaken opposing threats like Dragapult and Choice Specs Enamorus, creating opportunities for Gholdengo's partners to set up and sweep. Great Tusk's access to Rapid Spin also synergizes well with Gholdengo, which is punished by Spikes, so getting rid of them gives Gholdengo more opportunities to switch in. Entry hazard setters like Gliscor, Skarmory, and Ting-Lu also benefit from Gholdengo's ability to serve as an emergency spinblocker. Moreover, both Gliscor and Great Tusk help in checking Gouging Fire, a foe that Gholdengo is weak to. Due to its vulnerability to Dark-type Pokemon like Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott, exacerbated by its reliance on the inaccurate Focus Blast and the inherent risk of being Choice-locked, Gholdengo greatly benefits from the support of teammates that check the aforementioned foes, such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. Rillaboom also deserves a special mention as a teammate, as its Grassy Terrain weakens the super effective Earthquake, in addition to acting as a check to foes like Ting-Lu. In return, Gholdengo helps Rillaboom by handling threats that would otherwise be problematic for the latter, such as Skarmory. Gouging Fire is also a really good teammate for Gholdengo, since it appreciates Gholdengo's ability to exploit the passivity of some of its checks like Toxapex and Dondozo. It also checks Kingambit and offensive Fire-types, such as Volcarona and Cinderace, for Gholdengo.</p>"

      "Entry Hazard Setter": {
        "description": "<p>With incredible bulk, Vessel of Ruin, and access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock, Ting-Lu is one of OU's premier hazard setters and also doubles as a special wall. Spikes are used to hit grounded Stealth Rock-resistant Pokemon like Kingambit and Gholdengo harder, while Stealth Rock can be used instead to damage Spikes-immune Pokemon like Enamorus and Corviknight that repeatedly switch into Ting-Lu, as well as punish Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Booster Energy Gouging Fire and Choice Specs Kyurem. Thanks to its huge bulk, Ting-Lu is able to take super effective hits from setup sweepers like Volcarona, Kyurem, and Iron Boulder and phaze them with Whirlwind in return; in addition to this, Whirlwind forces in opposing Pokemon, which will take damage from Ting-Lu's hazards unless they hold Heavy-Duty Boots. Ruination deals meaningful damage to switch-ins like Rillaboom, Great Tusk, and Hatterene, while Stone Edge can be run instead to allow Ting-Lu to OHKO Volcarona and hit Flying-types like Dragonite and Zapdos. Tera Poison is used to help Ting-Lu better check Fairy- and Fighting-types like Enamorus, Zamazenta, and especially Iron Valiant and grant it an immunity to Toxic, while Tera Ghost can be run instead to nullify Ting-Lu's Fighting-type weakness and allow it to spinblock Great Tusk and Iron Treads, though this comes at the cost of being weak to Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult as well as Dark-types like Darkrai, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon that Ting-Lu would otherwise check.</p> <p>Ting-Lu fits well as a support option on nearly any balance team. Offensive partners like Dragapult, Gouging Fire, and Kyurem appreciate entry hazard support to make foes easier to KO, while physically defensive partners like Dondozo and Skarmory benefit from Ting-Lu's ability to handle special attackers like Gholdengo and Raging Bolt. Skarmory is particularly notable for forming a strong defensive hazard-stacking core with Ting-Lu, being able to switch into Pokemon like Meowscarada and Weavile that threaten it. Aside from being potent late-game cleaners that appreciate Ting-Lu spreading chip damage early-game, offensive partners like Weavile and Meowscarada pair well, since they're able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokemon with Knock Off to make Ting-Lu's hazard stacking more effective as well as pressure Gliscor, which Ting-Lu struggles significantly against. Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo are both great defensive partners for Ting-Lu to handle Fairy-types like Hatterene and Iron Valiant, with the former able to provide additional pressure with Future Sight and the latter also able to block hazard removal.</p>"

  "Roaring Moon": {
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Roaring Moon is one of the tier's most dangerous sweepers due to its fantastic Attack and Speed complemented further by its decent bulk, a great typing both offensively and defensively, and diverse coverage options that dramatically limit its defensive counterplay. Acrobatics, thanks to its perfect synergy with Booster Energy, boasts excellent coverage alongside Knock Off by giving Roaring Moon an incredibly powerful option to super effectively hit threats like Great Tusk as well as Ogerpon-W, Serperior, and Rillaboom without the need to Dragon Dance; between it and Knock Off, Roaring Moon hits much of the tier for at least neutral damage, which is often enough for it to clean up late-game. Earthquake OHKOes threats that can survive a boosted Knock Off or Acrobatics, such as offensive Kingambit, Raging Bolt, Gouging Fire, and Iron Treads. Taunt drastically improves Roaring Moon's matchup against defensive teams by preventing threats like Dondozo, Ting-Lu, Tera Fairy Skeledirge, and Skarmory from disrupting its sweep with their recovery, status, or setup moves; Taunt is still useful against more offensive teams by virtue of preventing Serperior from stopping Roaring Moon's sweep with Glare, denying Glimmora multiple layers of entry hazards, or preventing setup sweepers like Tera Fairy Gouging Fire and Kyurem from surviving a hit and setting up against it. Brick Break is an interesting alternative; it outright OHKOes Weavile and defensive Kingambit, hits Darkrai and opposing Roaring Moon super effectively, and greatly improves Roaring Moon's matchup against opposing dual screens or Aurora Veil teams. Tera Flying grants Roaring Moon some noteworthy defensive benefits, including turning its Fighting weakness into a resistance and granting it a Ground immunity, but its greatest benefit is giving Roaring Moon access to the absurd power of STAB Acrobatics; with the boost from Tera Flying, Roaring Moon can OHKO max HP Great Tusk without even needing a boost from Dragon Dance while having a chance to OHKO Zamazenta after a Dragon Dance. A Jolly nature is preferred to outpace Booster Energy Iron Valiant after a Dragon Dance, but the power increase from an Adamant nature is enough to OHKO bulky Kingambit and Assault Vest Archaludon with Earthquake without any chip damage while securing more reliable KOs against Zamazenta and bulkier Great Tusk variants.</p> <p>Roaring Moon is a staple on fast-paced hyper offense teams that can help facilitate its sweep, though on these teams it can also serve as a wallbreaker to help facilitate other setup sweepers as needed. Hisuian Samurott and Glimmora can reliably set up entry hazards to help Roaring Moon secure OHKOs against bulky Kingambit and Archaludon without needing to commit to an Adamant nature, while dual screens setters like Deoxys-S, Alolan Ninetales, and Grimmsnarl can allow Roaring Moon to set up more safely, grant it a safety net against strong priority from the likes of Weavile and Tera Normal Dragonite, or even allow Roaring Moon to set up multiple Dragon Dances and devastate opposing offensive teams. Deoxys-S is a particularly excellent teammate for Roaring Moon; it can act as a fast dual screens setter, an entry hazard setter that can deny opposing hazards while bypassing Hatterene's Magic Bounce with Skill Swap, or a standalone offensive threat that can help overwhelm threats like Dondozo, Skarmory, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge with its excellent coverage while allowing Roaring Moon to maximize its own coverage instead of running Taunt. Fast Booster Energy users like Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder synergize well with Roaring Moon; Roaring Moon can serve as more of a wallbreaker alongside these threats, using its high immediate damage output and Knock Off to wear down or eliminate threats like Gholdengo, Clodsire, Dondozo, and Corviknight to enable their late-game sweeps. Volcarona is also an excellent teammate, as it handles Steel-types like Corviknight and Skarmory that Roaring Moon may struggle with and appreciates Roaring Moon's ability to brute force past walls like Clodsire, Blissey, specially defensive Skeledirge, Ting-Lu, and Galarian Slowking in return, particularly if it is running Taunt. Even other Dragon Dance users, such as Gouging Fire, Kyurem, and Dragonite, can help overwhelm physical walls that Roaring Moon may struggle with while utilizing their alternate defensive profiles to cover Roaring Moon's shortcomings. Gouging Fire's burn immunity makes it useful against Volcarona, Skeledirge, and Will-O-Wisp Rotom-W, while its excellent physical bulk makes it very difficult to revenge kill with priority moves from Dragonite and Weavile; Kyurem fits well on Aurora Veil teams alongside Roaring Moon thanks to its tremendous physical bulk while snow is active, and Dragonite's Extreme Speed acts as a strong priority attack to deal with opposing priority users like Weavile and Raging Bolt, which can revenge kill Roaring Moon with Ice Shard and Thunderclap, respectively. Kingambit greatly appreciates Roaring Moon's ability to pressure Fire-types like Cinderace and Volcarona, and in return its great bulk and typing can allow it to handle threats like Weavile and Meowscarada lacking Low Kick. Lastly, Roaring Moon can fit reasonably well on Psychic Terrain teams spearheaded by Indeedee; Psychic Terrain keeps Roaring Moon safe from opposing priority attacks until it activates Tera Flying, and such a playstyle helps facilitate offensive threats that Roaring Moon already synergizes well with such as Volcarona, Iron Boulder, and Expanding Force Deoxys-S.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Roaring Moon is an elite physical wallbreaker on sun teams thanks to its phenomenal Attack and great Speed stats, either of which can be further boosted by its Protosynthesis. Knock Off is extremely spammable and difficult to safely switch into, giving Roaring Moon a strong STAB move that can even support the rest of its team with item removal. Outrage is a brutally strong STAB move that is impossible to switch into without a Fairy-type, easily allowing Roaring Moon to break past physical walls like Gliscor and Dondozo. Iron Head is used to hit Fairy-types such as Clefable and Enamorus for super effective damage; however Earthquake is an alternative to Iron Head that allows Roaring Moon to hit Steel-types, particularly Archaludon and Kingambit for super effective damage. U-turn is pivotal for maintaining momentum, allowing it to safely bring in threats such as Walking Wake onto the field. 220 Attack EVs and maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature are necessary for Roaring Moon to attain a boost to its Speed via Protosynthesis, allowing it to always outspeed Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Enamorus. Alternatively, simply running maximum Attack and Speed EVs gives Roaring Moon an Attack boost through its Protosynthesis, letting it 2HKO Skarmory with Knock Off and Dondozo with Outrage, alongside always netting an OHKO on Kingambit with Earthquake. Tera Dark is the premier Tera type for this set, as it powers up Knock Off to unprecedented levels of power, inflicting heavy damage on Gliscor, Skarmory, and even Clefable, whereas Tera Steel can be used to gain STAB on Iron Head and to withstand Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks.</p> <p>This set functions best on sun teams, leveraging Torkoal to set the sun for Roaring Moon to take advantage of, with the former also checking Bug-, Ice-, and Fairy-types for the latter. Roaring Moon is vulnerable to repeated chip damage from entry hazards, which can wear it down very quickly if left unchecked. Hatterene and Great Tusk are much appreciated forms of hazard control that can also check some of the threats Roaring Moon struggles against, with Hatterene forcing out Dragon- and Fighting-types, namely Dragonite, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta, and Great Tusk being able to force out Kingambit while generally acting as a reliable physical tank. Venusaur and Kingambit also pair very well with Roaring Moon on sun, with Venusaur forcing Primarina and Great Tusk out alongside Kingambit's reliability in taking on Meowscarada and Swords Dance Weavile. In return, Roaring Moon is able to soften up the opposing team for Venusaur and Kingambit to clean up in the late-game. Walking Wake and Raging Bolt can form an incredibly potent wallbreaking core with Roaring Moon, as both appreciate its Knock Off crippling their checks, and Raging Bolt can form a potent pivoting core with Roaring Moon that can easily take advantage of forced switch-ins. Gouging Fire also appreciates checks such as Gliscor and Dondozo being worn down, giving it an easier time sweeping teams in mid- or late-game scenarios.</p>"

  "Iron Valiant": {
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Iron Valiant is a premier wallbreaker and setup sweeper that uses Calm Mind to boost its attacks to OHKO foes such as Kyurem and Deoxys-S. Shadow Ball is a powerful coverage option, allowing Iron Valiant to damage Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Galarian Slowking that would otherwise be difficult to break through. Psyshock is a way for Iron Valiant to damage special walls like Blissey and Clodsire that it's unable to break through otherwise, as well as a solid option against Volcarona. Encore is able to stop opposing sweepers from setting up, locking them into setup moves, thus forcing them to switch out. Encore also breaks through walls by locking them out of their recovery moves, such as by trapping Clodsire into Stealth Rock and denying its access to Recover. In addition, Encore gives Iron Valiant an opportunity to set up additional boosts with Calm Mind and stops late-game Kingambit by locking it into Sucker Punch after it's knocked out a teammate. Vacuum Wave is an alternative option that lets Iron Valiant OHKO Kingambit after a Calm Mind as well as gives it priority to finish off weakened faster foes such as Choice Scarf Meowscarada, Choice Scarf Darkrai, and Dragon Dance-boosted Roaring Moon. Tera Ghost boosts the damage of Shadow Ball, allowing a 2HKO on Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge as well as getting an OHKO on Gholdengo after a Calm Mind. Tera Steel, on the other hand, is a purely defensive option, giving Iron Valiant sudden resistances to every type it was previously weak to, making threatening attacks like Sludge Bomb from Galarian Slowking and Darkrai non-issues. This also allows it the opportunity to survive a hit it otherwise wouldn't, such as Kingambit's Iron Head and Gholdengo's Make It Rain, and revenge kill afterwards or secure another boost from Calm Mind. Tera Fairy not only boosts Moonblast's damage, which guarantees a knockout on Kyurem and Zamazenta, but also removes Iron Valiant's weakness to opposing Fairy-type attacks from Enamorus and opposing Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Iron Valiant is able to support offensive teams with its incredible Speed and ability to set up and sweep. It synergizes well with other sweepers on offensive teams, forming solid cores that can cover each other's weaknesses. Some of these sweepers include Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Gouging Fire, which can all boost and take out foes that Iron Valiant struggles with like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran. In return, Iron Valiant can cover physically defensive Pokemon that these teammates would have trouble breaking through, such as Dondozo and Zamazenta. Iron Valiant is vulnerable to certain Pokemon that it isn't able to immediately deal with by boosting up and knocking them out. Gholdengo in particular is able to take all of Iron Valiant's hits even if it's running Shadow Ball and immediately knock it out with Make It Rain. Kingambit is an excellent partner that can take out Gholdengo as well as force out other threats to Iron Valiant such as Galarian Slowking; the synergy between Sucker Punch and Booster Energy allows them to secure revenge kills that the other cannot, such as Iron Valiant taking care of Walking Wake and Kingambit beating Iron Boulder. Iron Valiant can also form overload cores with similar Pokemon to wear down their shared checks; Ogerpon-W can help with this thanks to its access to Taunt and Encore, while other Calm Mind sweepers like Enamorus and Primarina can help wear down checks like Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo. Raging Bolt is also a solid teammate option that can take on Primarina and Enamorus thanks to Thunderclap; in return, Iron Valiant can take care of faster Dragon-types that threaten Raging Bolt. When used on bulkier team structures, Iron Valiant is very susceptible to being worn down by entry hazards over the course of a game; having a partner with Rapid Spin like Great Tusk can help relieve this pressure. Pokemon with pivoting moves such as Galarian Slowking and Landorus-T appreciate having a fast, powerful sweeper that they can get in safely, allowing Iron Valiant to switch in on Pokemon like Dragapult, Roaring Moon, and Kyurem without taking damage.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Iron Valiant establishes itself as a dangerous sweeper in the OU metagame due to its immense Attack stat along with its excellent coverage and Speed, bolstered further by Booster Energy. Due to Iron Valiant's diversity in sets, Swords Dance Iron Valiant creates openings for it to sweep or gain a great advantage against Pokemon that would normally check its more common specially offensive set, such as Galarian Slowking. Iron Valiant is works best as a late-game sweeper, picking off opposing foes and punishing switches by setting up a Swords Dance, and Knock Off hits Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking for great damage and offers great utility. Encore gives Iron Valiant more opportunities to set up by locking a passive Pokemon into one move or threatening offensive setup Pokemon such as Kingambit and Volcarona by locking them into Sucker Punch or Quiver Dance, respectively. However, Iron Valiant may choose to use Spirit Break over Encore to ease the matchup against Dragon-types such as Dragonite, Raging Bolt, and Walking Wake as well as hitting Fairy-types such as Enamorus, Hatterene, and opposing Iron Valiant. Iron Valiant's use of Booster Energy allows it to outspeed most Pokemon, with the drawback of being single-use. Swords Dance Iron Valiant's choice of Terastallization is between Dark and Steel, with the former boosting Iron Valiant's Knock Off even harder, most notably guaranteeing an OHKO against Volcarona, one of its offensive checks, after a Swords Dance. Additionally, Tera Dark Iron Valiant can absorb a Future Sight in a pinch and still resist Kingambit's Sucker Punch to avoid being revenge killed. Similarly, Tera Steel Iron Valiant lets it easily set up on its common checks such as Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo, and it can take advantage of its new resistances against common revenge killers such as Make it Rain Gholdengo, opposing Iron Valiant, Extreme Speed Dragonite, Grassy Glide Rillaboom, and Acrobatics Roaring Moon.</p> <p>Iron Valiant's incredible Attack and Speed as well as its access to Swords Dance makes it a staple on hyper offense teams. Swords Dance Iron Valiant being a great lure against Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo opens winning endgame paths for Pokemon walled by the two of them, such as Volcarona and Zamazenta. Iron Valiant is also an amazing Kingambit answer, which teammates such as Dragapult and Gholdengo appreciate. Swords Dance Iron Valiant struggles to deal with physical walls, such as Gliscor, Skarmory, Dondozo, and Landorus-T, which hinder its ability to sweep and get the most out of its value offensively. Teammates such as Ogerpon-W, Dragapult, Hatterene, and Volcarona deal with the aforementioned walls by outright threatening them or turning them into setup fodder. Entry hazards make Iron Valiant more prone to being revenge killed, making teammates that remove them such as Cinderace, Glimmora, and Great Tusk synergize with it very well on an offensive team. Iron Valiant also enjoys hazards from its own teammates, making its cleaning easier as well as having great synergy with Knock Off, which removes important items from Pokemon such as Heavy-Duty Boots Skeledirge, Rocky Helmet Skarmory, and Leftovers Zamazenta. Great entry hazard leads such as Hisuian Samurott, Glimmora, and Deoxys-S complement Iron Valiant well.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed": {
        "description": "<p>With its great coverage, high attacking stats, and amazing Speed backed up by Speed Booster Energy, Iron Valiant is one of the tier's best revenge killers. Iron Valiant's Moonblast hits most Pokemon in OU for at least neutral damage, while Close Combat complements it by dealing super effective damage against Kingambit, Heatran, Excadrill, and the occasional Blissey. Knock Off allows Iron Valiant to threaten Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Skeledirge, which resist both of its STAB moves, and it provides utility for the rest of its team by removing items like Heavy-Duty Boots. Alternatively, Psyshock can be used to threaten Clodsire, Iron Moth, and Toxapex. Encore can be used to lock foes into setup moves such as Volcarona's Quiver Dance, Gouging Fire's Dragon Dance, and Zamazenta's Iron Defense, as well as recovery and status moves such as Skeledirge's Slack Off, Corviknight's Roost, and Gliscor's Protect; Encore is also effective at locking Raging Bolt into Thunderclap and Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott into Sucker Punch, granting one of Iron Valiant's teammates a free switch. Destiny Bond is another option that can lure unsuspecting foes, particularly setup sweepers that Iron Valiant can't reliably OHKO, such as Volcarona, Nasty Plot Gholdengo, and Calm Mind Hatterene looking to KO Iron Valiant only to also faint in the process. Destiny Bond is particularly effective because offensive Pokemon will often respect the possibility of Iron Valiant using Encore to lock them into an undesirable move and attack straight away instead, falling victims to Destiny Bond. Booster Energy grants Iron Valiant a one-time Speed boost needed for it to outspeed otherwise faster foes such as Weavile, Dragapult, Zamazenta, and unboosted Roaring Moon. Tera Steel turns all of Iron Valiant's weaknesses into resistances, such as Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb and Future Sight, Gholdengo's Make It Rain, Roaring Moon's Acrobatics, and Enamorus's and opposing Iron Valiant's Moonblast. Tera Steel also grants Iron Valiant resistances to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide, preventing them from revenge killing it. Tera Fairy can be used instead to power up Iron Valiant's Moonblast, allowing it to OHKO Kyurem and Raging Bolt, as well as Enamorus after one round of Stealth Rock. Tera Dark is another option that power ups Iron Valiant's Knock Off to further threaten Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Skeledirge.</p> <p>Mixed Iron Valiant is best on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to revenge kill foes and whose fast-paced nature allows Iron Valiant to make the most out of Booster Energy. Iron Valiant's great coverage also allows it to act as a potent wallbreaker against slower-paced teams that it naturally outspeeds. Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and offensive Great Tusk enjoy Iron Valiant's ability to threaten opposing Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Zamazenta on their weaker Special Defense, while in return, they can threaten Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge, which can stop Iron Valiant. Dragapult is another Pokemon able to threaten the aforementioned foes, and it appreciates Iron Valiant handling Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Kingambit, which can be troublesome for Dragapult. Raging Bolt benefits from Iron Valiant's good matchup into Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Excadrill, as well as faster Dragon-types in Dragapult, Kyurem, and Walking Wake. Raging Bolt can in turn threaten Torkoal, Primarina, and Brave Bird Corviknight, which can win the one-on-one against Iron Valiant. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Glimmora, Landorus-T, Hisuian Samurott, and Deoxys-S provides Iron Valiant with the extra chip it needs to get past foes. In turn, Iron Valiant's Knock Off can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes, particularly Volcarona and Skeledirge, making them susceptible to said hazards and opening the path for teammates like Rillaboom to sweep late-game.</p>"

    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Walking Wake is a powerful wallbreaker and a staple on sun teams due to its unique offensive typing, amazing Special Attack, high Speed, and signature Hydro Steam, which is a powerful Water-type STAB move that takes full advantage of the sun. Draco Meteor is a brutally powerful STAB move that synergizes wonderfully with Hydro Steam, capable of OHKOing Water-resistant Pokemon including the likes of Ogerpon-W, Raging Bolt, and Kyurem in addition to 2HKOing nearly every Pokemon in the metagame barring Fairy-types such as Clefable and Primarina. Flamethrower guarantees an OHKO on Corviknight and bulky variants of Kingambit, though Flamethrower isn't used very often in practice due to Walking Wake's already fantastic STAB combination; Weather Ball is a stronger alternative to Flamethrower and allows Walking Wake to still take advantage of opposing weathers such as rain or snow. Dragon Pulse can be used in the last slot, which forgoes Draco Meteor's raw power for more consistency; however, Flip Turn allows Walking Wake to generate momentum for its team, taking advantage of switch-ins from the likes of Galarian Slowking and Primarina to safely bring in its teammates; lastly, Knock Off allows it to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from checks such as Galarian Slowking. 244 Special Attack EVs gives Walking Wake a Speed boost from Protosynthesis, making it a potent late-game cleaner against offensive teams due to its power coupled with its heightened Speed, letting it outspeed and threaten would-be revenge killers like Dragapult and Choice Scarf Enamorus; alternatively, Walking Wake can sacrifice the Speed boost for even more power by fully investing in Special Attack, allowing it to break through the likes of Primarina through sheer strength. Tera Water boosts its Hydro Steam's power even further, bolstering its cleaning potential against offense while 2HKOing even resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex after Stealth Rock, and allows Walking Wake to 2HKO even Blissey should it opt for a Special Attack boost; however, Tera Fairy could be considered as an alternative, granting it an immunity to Draco Meteor from Dragapult and opposing Walking Wake as well as a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Choice Specs Walking Wake is a mainstay on sun teams, requiring Torkoal to set the sun with Drought. Torkoal can also set Stealth Rock, which makes defensively answering Walking Wake even more difficult, as checks such as Primarina would repeatedly have to sustain chip damage. Hatterene and Great Tusk are also great teammates for Walking Wake, alleviating the issue of entry hazards limiting its longevity; Hatterene is also capable of forcing out checks such as Toxapex and Iron Valiant, while Great Tusk can check priority revenge killers such as Dragonite and Kingambit. In return, Walking Wake can consistently KO or force out either Pokemon's checks, notably taking on Skarmory for Great Tusk and Heatran for Hatterene. Gouging Fire and Choice Band Roaring Moon can pair with Walking Wake to form a devastating wallbreaking core, which can rapidly overwhelm each of their respective checks through raw power, such as Skarmory, Dondozo, Primarina, and Galarian Slowking, as well as enabling Gouging Fire to clean late-game. Walking Wake also appreciates Roaring Moon's powerful STAB Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Toxapex, and can pivot on its switch-ins with Flip Turn to bring Roaring Moon onto the field. Hisuian Lilligant and Venusaur can threaten Water-types such as Primarina and Ogerpon-W; both also appreciate Walking Wake blowing holes into the opposing team's defenses, giving them ample opportunity to run off with the game after their checks have been weakened. Lastly, Raging Bolt greatly enjoys Walking Wake's efficiency in dismantling its checks, notably Unaware Clodsire, as doing so enables Raging Bolt to sweep more efficiently in mid- or late-game scenarios.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With its Wellspring Mask-boosted power and good Speed tier alongside Swords Dance, Ogerpon-W is one of the most potent wallbreakers in the metagame. Generally, Power Whip is the better option, but at the cost of considerable power, it can opt for the more-accurate Horn Leech, which aids in recovering the chip damage it often takes from entry hazards throughout a game. However, it notably misses out on OHKOing Pelipper at +2 and Tera Water users like Galarian Slowking, Calm Mind Hatterene, and specially defensive Gliscor. Encore generates setup opportunities by locking foes into undesirable moves, such as Roost and Iron Defense from Corviknight or Skarmory, Sucker Punch from Kingambit, and Thunderclap from Raging Bolt. Alternatively, Play Rough augments Ogerpon-W's coverage by allowing it to hit targets such as Roaring Moon, Dragapult, Kyurem, and Dragonite. Knock Off can be used instead, which has the utility of removing items such as Dragonite's Heavy-Duty Boots and Skarmory's Rocky Helmet all while still hitting Dragapult, and it notably lands an OHKO after a Swords Dance versus defensive Gholdengo. Trailblaze is also an option; the boost to Ogerpon-W's Speed improves its ability to sweep, making it unable to be revenge killed by the likes of Weavile, Meowscarada, and Dragapult. Water Absorb allows it to take advantage of foes like Barraskewda and Alomomola using Flip Turn, preventing them from generating momentum, while its Scald immunity lets it freely set up on Alomomola. Tera Water is forced and bolsters the strength of Ivy Cudgel to absurd levels; after a Swords Dance, this allows it to OHKO Kingambit as well as Skarmory and Corviknight after Stealth Rock. In conjunction with the Special Defense boost granted by Embody Aspect, Tera Water has useful defensive properties too, allowing Ogerpon-W to check the likes of Volcarona, Iron Moth, Calm Mind Iron Valiant, and Gholdengo in a pinch.</p> <p>Ogerpon-W's wallbreaking prowess makes it well-suited to hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Volcarona appreciates Ogerpon-W's presence, as it can put pressure on shared checks such as Dragonite to pave the way for Volcarona to sweep. Volcarona also takes on foes Ogerpon-W struggles with, such as Rillaboom and Meowscarada, and threatens them with a potential burn from Flame Body. Likewise, Volcarona values Ogerpon-W's Water immunity, which allows it to take advantage of some foes that try to revenge kill Volcarona with Water-type moves, such as Barraskewda and Walking Wake, or even dissuade the use of such counterplay. Kingambit is a good partner, as Ogerpon-W's wallbreaking enables it late-game through weakening foes that deal with it, such as Skarmory and Iron Defense Zamazenta. Similarly, Ogerpon-W appreciates Kingambit's ability to check Dragapult. Ogerpon-W is susceptible to taking a lot of chip damage from hazards as the game goes on; consequently, this makes Great Tusk a good partner, as it can keep them off the field. Choice Scarf Enamorus is a good partner, as it provides Healing Wish support, giving Ogerpon-W a second chance at wearing down the opponent's team. Ogerpon-W appreciates hazard support, as that helps facilitate its wallbreaking; teammates such as Glimmora and Deoxys-S are useful. Ogerpon-W often struggles to find opportunities to come in; pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Landorus-T are helpful. Galarian Slowking in particular also helps check Kyurem, which is one of the few Pokemon that non-Play Rough Ogerpon-W struggle with the most, while Landorus-T's ability to provide Stealth Rock is also appreciated. Iron Valiant, Calm Mind variants especially, is a good partner that appreciates Ogerpon-W's ability to pressure checks such as Volcarona, Skeledirge, and Clodsire. In return, Iron Valiant is able to threaten Raging Bolt, Kyurem, and faster threats that can revenge kill Ogerpon-W, such as Dragapult, Weavile, and Meowscarada.</p>"

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Ogerpon-W is a fantastic pivot thanks to its combination of high Speed, power, and utility. It can outspeed and threaten out many key threats such as Great Tusk, Heatran, and Gliscor with its powerful Ivy Cudgel, which it can capitalize on to gain momentum with U-turn. Horn Leech complements Ivy Cudgel, hitting bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Primarina for super effective damage and recovering HP, which is useful for mitigating entry hazard damage. U-turn allows Ogerpon-W to pivot out of bad matchups against Kyurem and Dragonite while also dealing high damage to Roaring Moon and many Grass-types that may want to switch into it, such as Rillaboom, Serperior, and Hydrapple. Taunt prevents Pokemon such as Clefable and Tera Grass Heatran from setting up entry hazards or using status as well as stopping recovery or setup attempts from Pokemon such as Skarmory, Dragonite, or Corviknight, which is useful in wearing them down over time. Alternatively, Encore can be used to punish setup from various Pokemon such as Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Garganacl while similarly disrupting walls such as Corviknight and Skarmory. Spikes can be run over Taunt or Encore, as Ogerpon-W can find many opportunities to lay Spikes due to the switches it forces and has good match-ups against various hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Spikes synergizes well with U-turn, as their combined chip damage will wear down many of Ogerpon-W's switch-ins such as Tera Dragon Skarmory and Raging Bolt over time. Water Absorb allows Ogerpon-W to more safely switch into opposing Water-types such as Barraskewda, Hisuian Samurott, and Alomomola, notably making it riskier for these Pokemon to gain momentum with Flip Turn. Ogerpon-W is an average Terastallization candidate, as it is filling a supportive role and its Tera type is telegraphed. Nonetheless, the Special Defense boost Ogerpon-W gains when Terastallizing can be useful in a few scenarios, such as surviving Choice Specs Walking Wake's Draco Meteor and Gholdengo's Nasty Plot-boosted Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock. The lack of a Grass typing also allows it to match up more favorably against Pokemon such as Weavile, Volcarona, Iron Moth, and Heatran. The damage increase provided by Tera Water can also be useful, allowing Ogerpon-W to 2HKO Skarmory and Corviknight with Ivy Cudgel after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Ogerpon-W thrives on bulky offense teams. It synergizes well with other pivoting Pokemon. Landorus-T appreciates Ogerpon-W's ability to handle opposing Water-types such as Primarina while providing Ogerpon-W with Stealth Rock and Intimidate support. Landorus-T can also check Roaring Moon and Raging Bolt, which are difficult matchups for Ogerpon-W. Galarian Slowking benefits from Ogerpon-W's presence to deal with Ground-types such as Iron Treads and Gliscor as well as strong Water-types that can otherwise overwhelm it such as Walking Wake. In turn, Galarian Slowking can support Ogerpon-W via Future Sight and status spreading with Thunder Wave or Toxic, which are useful to wear down and cripple checks such as Dragonite and Raging Bolt. Galarian Slowking also checks key Grass- and Dragon-types such as Serperior and Kyurem, which Ogerpon-W appreciates. Since Ogerpon-W is great at luring and breaking down the opponent's physical walls with Taunt or Encore, partners such as Kingambit, Weavile, and Roaring Moon can take advantage of the holes Ogerpon-W puts into walls such as Skarmory, Dondozo, and Gliscor to sweep more easily. Entry hazard support helps wear down many of Ogerpon-W's checks such as Raging Bolt and Serperior, so setters such as Great Tusk, Deoxys-S, and Ting-Lu are recommended teammates. As Ogerpon-W cannot hold Heavy-Duty Boots, it is quite vulnerable to entry hazard damage over time; hazard removal or prevention support from Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Hatterene, or Cinderace is thus appreciated. Ogerpon-W is good at luring several Pokemon such as Serperior, Rillaboom, Kyurem, Raging Bolt, and Dragonite, which it can safely pivot out of with U-turn; Kyurem and Dragapult can take advantage of Rillaboom, Raging Bolt, and Serperior, while Air Balloon Kingambit and Gholdengo do well against Kyurem and Dragonite. Additionally, Dragapult in particular can support Ogerpon-W further by spreading status.</p>"

      "Offensive Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Gouging Fire is a very powerful Dragon Dance sweeper with solid longevity thanks to its bulk and access to reliable recovery. Flare Blitz is a strong STAB move with reliable power; however, Heat Crash can be used instead to avoid recoil damage, though its variable Base Power can sometimes backfire against heavier targets like Great Tusk. Earthquake can be used to hit Fire-resistant targets like Raging Bolt and offer overall solid neutral coverage. For the last slot, Morning Sun grants Gouging Fire longevity, while Dragon Claw hits Dragapult and Roaring Moon hard. Outrage is also an option for more power against Fire-resistant targets such as Toxapex and Dondozo, but the fact that it locks the user into using it and leaves Gouging Fire vulnerable to Fairy- and Steel-types makes it less than ideal. Scale Shot, in conjunction with Loaded Dice, also has more power than Dragon Claw and lets Gouging Fire snowball further by boosting its Speed, but it leaves Gouging Fire vulnerable to entry hazards and doesn't boost its overall damage output unlike Booster Energy. An Adamant nature maximizes Gouging Fire's damage output, but a Jolly nature can be used to outrun the likes of Booster Energy Iron Boulder and Choice Scarf Meowscarada at +2 while avoiding the Speed tie with Dragapult and outrunning Choice Scarf Gholdengo at +1. Heavy-Duty Boots patches up Gouging Fire's crippling hazard weakness, while Booster Energy can also be used to further bolster Gouging Fire's damage output, letting it 2HKO non-defensive Great Tusk with Flare Blitz. Tera Fairy is an overall solid defensive typing that lets Gouging Fire resist Sucker Punch from Kingambit and Dragon-type moves from the likes of Raging Bolt and Kyurem.  Tera Ground boosts Earthquake's damage output while giving Gouging Fire an immunity to Thunder Wave. Finally, Tera Flying is also an option, as it gives Gouging Fire an immunity to Ground-type moves, letting it dent Excadrill and Great Tusk more easily.</p> <p>Gouging Fire's potential as a powerful Dragon Dance sweeper means that it makes its home on offensive teams. Booster Energy sets have a glaring weakness to entry hazards, so they appreciate removal from Great Tusk as well as hazard deterrents such as Magic Bounce Hatterene and Taunt Deoxys-S. Deoxys-S is also able to set up Spikes and/or dual screens, giving Gouging Fire an easier time sweeping. Additionally, Gouging Fire makes an excellent addition to sun teams. On such teams, it appreciates wallbreakers like Venusaur, Raging Bolt, and Walking Wake that can muscle through its checks and break through physical walls that Gouging Fire struggles with such as Dondozo and Skeledirge. On non-sun teams, Pokemon that can break through the aforementioned walls, such as Darkrai and Enamorus, are appreciated, as are Pokemon that can lure physical walls in before denting them, such as Grass Knot Landorus-T. Gouging Fire can chip away at bulkier Pokemon such as Gliscor and defensive Landorus-T early-game, so Pokemon that share checks with it, such as Kingambit and offensive Great Tusk, appreciate it as a partner.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Raging Bolt is one of OU's fiercest offensive OU threats thanks to good bulk, a great Special Attack stat, and fantastic priority in Thunderclap allowing it to act both as a wallbreaker and sweeper while additionally threatening potent revenge killers. Raging Bolt threatens common metagame walls such as Skarmory, Dondozo, and Toxapex with its Electric-type STAB. Calm Mind allows Raging Bolt to gain a boost against walls like Heatran and Ting-Lu while also avoiding being OHKOed from threats like Kyurem, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus. Thunderclap lets Raging Bolt threaten Pokemon like Hisuian Samurott, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant. Dragon Pulse is preferred due to its higher PP and lack of a drawback, although Draco Meteor can be used for immediate breaking power and the ability to OHKO neutral threats such as Zamazenta and Rillaboom. Weather Ball can be used over Thunderbolt if Raging Bolt is used on a weather team, but it has to forgo reliable Electric-type STAB move. In rain, Weather Ball allows Raging Bolt to threaten Ground-types like Gliscor and Great Tusk, while under sun, Raging Bolt can hit Fire-types that resist its Dragon-type STAB move. The given EV spread is used to live Speed-boosting Great Tusk's Headlong Rush, as well as outspeeding Gliscor. Booster Energy in conjunction with Protosynthesis can be used to threaten unboosted Gouging Fire and Dragonite, while Leftovers provides more longevity. Tera Fairy is recommended to flip matchups on Dragon-type threats such as the aforementioned Gouging Fire and Dragonite, as well as Walking Wake and Dragapult, by evading their super effective Dragon-type attacks. Tera Flying is the final option, providing Raging Bolt an immunity to Ground-type attacks from Excadrill, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu.</p> <p>Raging Bolt fits well on rain, sun, hyper and bulky offense teams due to its good bulk and Special Attack, so weather setters such as Torkoal and Pelipper are ideal. Raging Bolt is also a good partner for physical wallbreakers like Iron Boulder and Gouging Fire, as they both enjoy Raging Bolt's ability to threaten Dondozo, while Rillaboom and Meowscarada appreciate Raging Bolt's ability to threaten Skarmory and Corviknight. Raging Bolt is threatened by faster Ground-types like Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Great Tusk due to being unable to hit them with Thunderclap. Therefore, Rillaboom is a great teammate, as it provides another form of speed control in Grassy Glide as well as Grassy Terrain recovery, which also halves the damage of Earthquake. On weather teams however, there are a multitude of ways to deal with the aforementioned Ground-types. On sun teams, Torkoal and Walking Wake are beneficial, while on rain teams, Barraskweda and Pelipper are good teammates. Walking Wake, Barraskewda, and Pelipper deal with Ground-types, while Torkoal helps Raging Bolt activate Protosynthesis. Raging Bolt also has a poor Speed tier, so speed control options such as Darkrai, Iron Valiant, and Weavile are good teammates, threatening Raging Bolt's common Dragon-type checks like Dragapult and Kyurem. Raging Bolt also fears entry hazards, as they can break down its defensive profile, especially if it forgoes Leftovers. Therefore, hazard control from Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Hatterene, and Corviknight is appreciated.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Iron Boulder is a setup sweeper as well as as one of the most effective forms of speed control in the current metagame, outspeeding the likes of Booster Energy Iron Valiant and +1 Roaring Moon. Close Combat hits targets such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu. Alternatively, Earthquake can be used over Close Combat, forgoing the Ting-Lu matchup for a better matchup into non-Air Balloon Gholdengo. These moves can be run in conjunction with each other, but in that case Iron Boulder has difficult matchups against Great Tusk and Zamazenta. Zen Headbutt can be used to improve these matchups as well as provide a reliable means of revenge killing Booster Energy Iron Valiant, again in exchange for the Gholdengo matchup. Substitute is also a viable option, and it can be used to ease Iron Boulder's matchup versus Sucker Punch from Kingambit, as well as allowing it to avoid Thunder Wave from Galarian Slowking as it sets up. Given a free turn to set it up, Substitute can also allow Iron Boulder to avoid being revenge killed by priority, such as Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Kingambit's Sucker Punch. However, its main use case is with Tera, as Substitute + Tera Flying allows Iron Boulder to circumvent Gliscor—which otherwise would be a solid check—and turn it into setup fodder by avoiding both Toxic and Earthquake. Running Taunt over Substitute is also an option; aside from beating Gliscor one-on-one with Tera Flying, it also allows Iron Boulder to overwhelm Skarmory by preventing its Iron Defense and Roost attempts. Tera Fighting boosts the power of Close Combat, notably helping Iron Boulder brute force its way past Skarmory, while also allowing it to OHKO Ting-Lu after a Swords Dance. It also provides a Sucker Punch resistance, which helps versus Kingambit. Tera Ground can be used to boost the power of Earthquake, guaranteeing the OHKO on bulkier variants of Gholdengo at +2 as well as helping Iron Boulder avoid being picked off by Raging Bolt's Thunderclap. Tera Flying not only lets Iron Boulder wall Gliscor in combination with Substitute but also grants it a resistance to Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and facilitates setup opportunities versus other Ground-types like Great Tusk and Landorus-T.</p> <p>Iron Boulder's power and its top-tier speed, alongside its good coverage and access to Swords Dance, make it very suitable for hyper offense teams. Teammates such as Kingambit appreciate the weakening of shared checks such as Landorus-T and Skarmory. The same goes for Iron Moth but with Ting-Lu and Gliscor. Iron Valiant also appreciates Gliscor being weakened and can whittle down shared checks such as Gholdengo to make it easier for Iron Boulder to sweep later. Iron Boulder struggles with entry hazard damage putting it in KO range of priority moves such as Kingambit’s Sucker Punch and Rillaboom’s Grassy Glide after Tera. Teammates that are effective at keeping hazards off your side such as Taunt Deoxys-S, Glimmora, Hatterene, or Great Tusk are good partners. The first two also provide their own hazards, facilitating the weakening of Iron Boulder's checks. Iron Boulder also has difficulty overcoming Dondozo. Partners that can weaken it or take advantage of it, such as Taunt Roaring Moon or Ogerpon-W, respectively, are good partners. Volcarona is also a good partner, as it takes advantage of Iron Boulder checks such as Skarmory, Gholdengo, and Rillaboom and turns them into setup fodder.</p>"
