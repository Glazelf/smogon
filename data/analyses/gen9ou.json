        "description": "<p>Paldean Tauros-F’s unique defensive typing with Intimidate allows it to act as a capable defensive pivot against prominent physical attackers like Kingambit and Meowscarada. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers like Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon on the switch-in to prevent an otherwise losing matchup. Body Press is a powerful attack on Paldean Tauros-F, as it has the power to OHKO Greninja, Kingambit and Meowscarada. It also has a chance to OHKO Roaring Moon while dealing notable damage to Garganacl and Ting-Lu. Raging Bull hits foes like Breloom and Gholdengo while removing Light Screen and Reflect against offensive teams. Protect lets Paldean Tauros-F stall for Will-O-Wisp damage and grants it Leftovers recovery while scouting moves from Choice-locked foes like Dragapult and Walking Wake. Leftovers is its only source of recovery, helping it more consistently switch into resisted attacks. Heavy-Duty Boots helps Paldean Tauros-F more easily switch into U-turn from pivots like Meowscarada and Roaring Moon while synergizing well with Tera Flying to remove the Stealth Rock weakness. Heavy-Duty Boots can be more easily opted out of for Leftovers on teams with sufficient entry hazard control. Intimidate allows it to more easily take neutral hits from its checks, such as Roaring Moon’s Dragon Claw and Meowscarada’s Play Rough. Tera Flying is the preferred Tera type for granting Paldean Tauros-F resistance to Fighting and an immunity to Ground while keeping its resistances to Bug and Grass intact, allowing it to check foes like Garchomp and Great Tusk. If opting to run Leftovers, Tera Flying also grants the benefit of an immunity to all entry hazards, apart from Stealth Rock, which becomes a more inconvenient weakness.</p> <p>Paldean-F works well on many balance and bulky offense teams because of its solid defenses and lack of passivity. Due to its ability to check Dark-types like Roaring Moon and Kingambit, Paldean Tauros-F makes a great partner to Ghost-types like Dragapult and Gholdengo. In return, Dragapult can put pressure on Paldean Tauros-F’s checks, such as Dondozo and Garchomp, and Gholdengo checks status-spreading foes like Rotom-W and Toxapex. Water-types like Slowking and Greninja also appreciate Paldean Tauros-F checking Meowscarada and Breloom while countering offensive Water types like Quaquaval that can threaten Paldean Tauros-F. They can also help check Cinderace and Baxcalibur more reliably. If running Leftovers, hazard removal from allies like Corviknight and Great Tusk is appreciated. Corviknight is an especially good partner for its ability to hard counter offensive Ground-types like Great Tusk. Additionally, Great Tusk can pressure foes like Toxapex and Clodsire. Hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Great Tusk can aid the offensive pressure Paldean Tauros-F can exert by making it more difficult to switch into a typical check like Toxapex or Dragapult. Great Tusk does this job well by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes like Slowking, while Ting-Lu can check foes like Dragapult, Iron Moth, and bulky Volcarona.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Zapdos's excellent typing and gargantuan stats make it one of the most consistent offensive Pokemon in the metagame. Its typing is amazing offensively, making it an Electric-type that can threaten Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Its great defensive stats let it take hits from the likes of Zamazenta and Gholdengo in a pinch. Roost further boosts this defensive capability, giving Zapdos longevity. Volt Switch is essential for maintaining offensive momentum against Pokemon that Zapdos otherwise struggles with such as Galarian Slowking. Heat Wave heavily pressures Steel-types such as Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Iron Treads. Tera Electric further boosts Zapdos's Thunderbolt's power, notably giving it odds to 2HKO pivot Galarian Slowking and Zamazenta. Alternatively, Tera Steel gives Zapdos extra defensive utility, letting it take Fairy-type attacks and more easily fish for paralysis from Static, while the Poison immunity lets Zapdos more easily switch into Pokemon like Toxapex.</p> <p>Offensive Zapdos fits best on offense and bulky offense teams looking for a consistent, strong special attacker. Entry hazards from the likes of Great Tusk, Heatran, and Garganacl are heavily appreciated by Zapdos, as the chip damage is essential in helping Zapdos overwhelm common checks to it such as Landorus-T, Galarian Slowking, and Iron Treads. Garganacl also appreciates Zapdos being able to switch in on Ground- and Fighting-type moves from Pokemon like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Landorus-T. Thanks to STAB Thunder and Hurricane, Zapdos is a natural fit on rain teams to threaten out bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo that rain otherwise struggles with. Pelipper also doubles as a slow pivot, letting Zapdos come in without taking any damage. Other offensive Pokemon like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, Kingambit, and Baxcalibur heavily appreciate Zapdos's pivoting and ability to threaten common bulky Pokemon like Great Tusk and Toxapex. Dragapult, in particular, can form a potent VoltTurn core with Zapdos, hitting specially defensive Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire for solid damage while appreciating Zapdos forcing out Pokemon like Toxapex and Corviknight. Gholdengo is another excellent offensive teammate, being able to deal with Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire that Zapdos otherwise struggles with.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Zapdos is one of the best defensive pivots in the metagame due to its bulk and typing, which allow it to check and force out threats such as Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Hisuian Samurott. Additionally, its excellent offensive presence lets it generate momentum for its team with Volt Switch, which is quite difficult to block due to Zapdos's ability to nail Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T with a powerful Hurricane. Heat Wave 2HKOes Iron Treads, which otherwise blocks Volt Swich with impunity, and it pressures other Steel-types such as Kingambit and Gholdengo. Discharge is an option over Volt Switch or Heat Wave as an Electric-type attack that doesn't force Zapdos out, allowing it to fish for paralysis against Pokemon such as Heatran and Dragonite. Zapdos can also opt to use U-turn alongside Discharge for unblockable pivoting, which is particularly useful against Ground-types that don't fear Hurricane such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire, but it usually prefers the power and role compression of Volt Switch. Thunder Wave is another option that reliably paralyzes opposing Pokemon but makes Zapdos significantly more passive. The given EV spread allows Zapdos to outspeed Great Tusk and Baxcalibur. A more defensive spread of 248 HP / 240 Def / 20 Spe with a Bold nature sacrifices Zapdos's ability to outspeed key threats, such as Great Tusk and Gholdengo, but makes it a much more formidable wall; for example, this spread avoids the 2HKO from Great Tusk's Ice Spinner and is likely to avoid the OHKO from +2 Sneasler's Gunk Shot. Static is the preferred ability to punish physical attackers such as Great Tusk and Sneasler; however, Pressure can be used to allow Zapdos stall out low-PP moves such as Great Tusk's Close Combat, Dragapult's Draco Meteor, and Heatran's Magma Storm. Tera Steel helps Zapdos check many common sweepers in a pinch, most notably letting it take Fairy-, Ice-, and Poison-type attacks from Iron Valiant, Enamorus, Baxcalibur, and Sneasler. Tera Fairy is another strong option that improves Zapdos's matchup against dangerous Dark- and Dragon-types, such as Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, Dragapult, and Walking Wake, while maintaining its Fighting-type resistance.</p> <p>Zapdos is an excellent fit on bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to keep dangerous sweepers in check and pivot powerful offensive threats into play. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Hisuian Samurott can make it much harder for Pokemon such as Heatran and Ting-Lu to continuously check Zapdos. Great Tusk is a particularly good partner that can also threaten Zapdos's switch-ins, such as Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Galarian Slowking, and remove Stealth Rock if Zapdos loses its Heavy-Duty Boots. Gholdengo handles offensive threats that may overwhelm Zapdos, such as Sneasler, Iron Valiant, and Baxcalibur, while Zapdos covers it against Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott. Setup sweepers such as Kingambit, Baxcalibur, and Iron Valiant can make great use of Zapdos's ability to generate free turns by pivoting them into play and spreading paralysis; Kingambit especially has brilliant synergy with Zapdos, taking on Galarian Slowking, Garganacl, and Clodsire, while Zapdos handles Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Dondozo. Similarly, Zapdos can provide free entry for powerful wallbreakers such as Volcanion, Hoopa-U, Dragapult, and Heatran.</p> "

Moltres gets many free turns over the course of a game thanks to the many Pokemon it forces out, which makes U-turn a fantastic tool for pivoting and gaining momentum while also ensuring that Moltres is not passive against Pokemon such as Baxcalibur, Heatran, and Ting-Lu. Hurricane is an alternative that can OHKO Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Sneasler and 2HKO Zamazenta, and it also hits Baxcalibur without boosting its Attack. 12 Speed EVs allows Moltres to outspeed Jolly Kingambit. Tera Fairy removes all of Moltres' previous weaknesses and strengthen its matchup against Kingambit and Roaring Moon. Alternatively, Tera Water is a solid defensive type that also improves Moltres's rain matchup allowing it to live rain-boosted Tera Water Wave Crash from Floatzel and Basculegion and be able to threaten them back with Will-O-Wisp. Great Tusk can form a good core with Moltres thanks to Great Tusk's ability to threaten Moltres's switch-ins, such as Garganacl, Ting-Lu, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran, and remove Stealth Rock if Moltres loses its Heavy-Duty Boots. Ting-Lu can take advantage of Moltres's switch-ins such as Zapdos, Dragapult, and Iron Moth to lay entry hazards while Moltres covers it against Fighting- and Fairy-types such as Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Sneasler.

Extreme Speed is an excellent move for any physical sweeper, due to its high power and initiative over other priority users such as Kingambit. Earthquake provides coverage against bulky foes such as Toxapex, Garganacl, and Clodsire. Fire Punch OHKOes Scizor and 2HKOes physically defensive Corviknight after a Dragon Dance and Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Ice Spinner hits opposing Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Dragapult super effectively, notably OHKOing Dragapult after a Dragon Dance. Heavy-Duty Boots + Roost improves Dragonite's longevity and possibly enables it to retain Multiscale and obtain multiple boosts; preserving Multiscale is particularly useful for surviving Draco Meteor from Timid Choice Specs Dragapult. Encore can be used to provide setup opportunities and eventually overwhelm bulky Pokemon like Corviknight, Bulk Up Great Tusk, and Curse Garganacl. Tera Normal turns Extreme Speed into an incredibly powerful STAB priority move capable of shredding offensive teams after a single boost, and a timely typing change also removes Dragonite's weaknesses to Ice, Fairy, and Dragon, which can buy a free turn to set up. An Adamant nature is preferred since it maximizes the power of Extreme Speed, which often makes makes Speed stats irrelevant, but a Jolly nature can also be used to outspeed the Normal-immune Dragapult after a Dragon Dance, which is especially useful if Dragonite is running Ice Spinner.</p> <p>Offensive Dragon Dance Dragonite regularly serves as a potent win con on offensive teams that can also act as a revenge killer against fast and frail threats. Multiscale Dragonite's considerable bulk, as well as Ghost immunity with Tera Normal provides significant defensive utility for offensive teams. In particular, teams using frail offensive Pokemon such as Iron Valiant appreciate the defensive utility Dragonite brings. In return, these Pokemon can help wallbreak for a late-game Dragonite sweep. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Glimmora, and Garchomp is appreciated to weaken Pokemon such as Iron Valiant into range of boosted Extreme Speed. Dual screens support from Grimmsnarl is a potential option that can supplement Dragonite's already great bulk and virtually guarantee the ability to acquire multiple boosts. Since Dragonite struggles against bulky Unaware users such as Dondozo and Skeledirge, a teammate that can switch into and check these Pokemon, such as Rotom-W, is appreciated.

It can set up on common Pokemon such as Great Tusk lacking Bulk Up or Ice Spinner, non-Will-O-Wisp Volcarona, and even super effective attacks from Iron Valiant and Choice Specs Dragapult thanks to Multiscale. Extreme Speed alongside Tera Normal lets Dragonite clean up late-game, OHKOing faster threats like Meowscarada and potentially Cinderace at +1. It also outprioritizes Meowscarada's Sucker Punch as well as Grimmsnarl's Prankster-boosted Reflect and Thunder Wave. Earthquake covers Normal-resistant and -immune Pokemon, including foes like Dragapult, non-Air Balloon Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Kingambit. 144 HP EVs allow Dragonite to survive Tera Fairy Iron Valiant's Moonblast at +1 through Multiscale. Aside from strengthening Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Tera Normal sheds off its weaknesses to give it setup opportunities against would-be threats like Dragapult and Hatterene. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps Multiscale intact by ignoring Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Bulky Dragon Dance Dragonite fits well on bulky offense.

Garchomp, Glimmora, and Ting-Lu can reliably set entry hazards, which rack up chip damage onto walls such as Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Garganacl and puts revenge killers like Iron Valiant into guaranteed KO range of +1 Tera Normal Extreme Speed. Wallbreakers such as Breloom and Great Tusk can punch holes early-game and overwhelm Dragonite's checks, such as Corviknight, Dondozo, Skeledirge, and defensive Great Tusk. Moreover, Breloom can incapacitate foes with Spore to give setup opportunities for Dragonite, while Great Tusk can use Knock Off to cripple Corviknight and Dondozo and pop Gholdengo's Air Balloon. Other setup sweepers are great partners; Volcarona can threaten Corviknight, use Tera Steel Rotom-W as setup fodder, and spread burns with Flame Body and Will-O-Wisp against physical attackers such as Iron Valiant, Iron Hands, and Roaring Moon to further support Dragonite.</p> "

Unaware users like Dondozo and Skeledirge may switch into Dragonite expecting a Dragon Dance variant but take massive damage from a Choice Band-boosted attack instead. Outrage is an extremely powerful STAB move capable of 2HKOing virtually any Pokemon that does not resist it, which even includes physically defensive walls like Great Tusk and Dondozo. It can also OHKO opposing Dragonite, even with Multiscale intact. Breaking walls is not the only role Dragonite fulfills, as Extreme Speed is a strong priority move that allows it to revenge kill threats like Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Baxcalibur, with some prior chip damage, or clean up late-game. Earthquake provides strong coverage, hitting grounded Steel-types like Gholdengo and Kingambit that resist Outrage and Extreme Speed. It's also Dragonite's strongest attack against walls like Garganacl, Toxapex, and Skeledirge to avoid locking it into Outrage. There are a couple of different options for the last moveslot. Fire Punch provides coverage for Corviknight and Tera Steel Rotom-W. Iron Head deals significant damage to Fairy-types like Hatterene and Scream Tail, as well as Tera Fairy users like Garganacl and Skeledirge. Thunder Punch is Dragonite's best option for dealing with Azumarill while also providing coverage for Corviknight. Ice Spinner is another option to hurt the likes of Great Tusk, Garchomp, and opposing Dragonite without locking into Outrage. It also ends Psychic Terrain, which allows Dragonite to use Extreme Speed against grounded Pokemon later on. Multiscale allows Dragonite to take even super effective hits from offensive Pokemon like Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Choice Specs Dragapult and KO them back. Tera Normal makes Extreme Speed even more powerful, OHKOing offensive Volcarona and Iron Moth, and removes Dragonite's usual weaknesses to attacks like Iron Valiant's Moonblast and Baxcalibur's STAB moves, which can be useful for revenge killing and cleaning.</p> <p>Choice Band Dragonite fits best on mostly offensive teams where it can break holes in the opposing team for its teammates to take advantage of and where its strong priority may be needed against other offensive teams. However, while Choice Band Dragonite is very powerful, it also requires a lot of support. As it is vulnerable to Stealth Rock, not only because Dragonite is weak to it but also because it negates Multiscale, strong entry hazard control is important. This can be in the form of entry hazard removal, such as Rapid Spin Great Tusk, but also in the form of entry hazard prevention, such as Hatterene and Taunt users like Meowscarada and Greninja. Knock Off users like Great Tusk and Meowscarada can remove Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from walls like opposing Great Tusk and Corviknight, which makes them easier to break for Dragonite and keeps Multiscale intact. Switching Dragonite directly into attacks should generally be avoided, since keeping Multiscale intact is desirable, so it appreciates teammates that can bring it in safely. Examples include pivot move users, such as Cinderace, Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Slowking, as well as Eject Button or Eject Pack users, such as Eject Button Hatterene, Eject Pack Great Tusk, and Eject Pack Gholdengo. Physical attackers like Kingambit and Roaring Moon appreciate Dragonite weakening or removing checks like Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Dondozo. On the other hand, special attackers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth can lure in checks like Clodsire and Slowking for Dragonite to punish. Iron Moth has the additional benefit of helping with Dragonite's fourth moveslot issue, as it can threaten Steel-types like Corviknight for Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Fairy-types like Hatterene for Dragonite lacking Iron Head.</p> "

Despite Azumarill's good bulk, its tanking prowess can often be undermined by its vulnerability to passive damage from entry hazards and Rocky Helmet. Great Tusk is therefore an excellent partner, providing Rapid Spin support and being able to lure and remove Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Corviknight with Knock Off. Meowscarada is also an excellent ally, being able to shut down opposing entry hazard setters with Taunt while also providing Knock Off support. Furthermore, both Great Tusk and Meowscarada can support Azumarill by laying down entry hazards, which it will greatly appreciate given its ability to force switches. Ting-Lu can similarly lay down multiple layers of entry hazards and ease pressure exerted onto Azumarill in dealing with threats such as Dragapult and Iron Moth. Teammates that can bring Azumarill in safely with a pivoting move, such as Cinderace and Dragapult, are also recommended. Cinderace can assist Azumarill in dealing with entry hazards via Court Change, while Dragapult can deal with Orthworm, which may sometimes use Azumarill as an entry point to pass Shed Tail. In return, Azumarill can check key Pokemon such as Greninja and Volcarona that would threaten them. Azumarill greatly struggles against bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Toxapex, Dondozo, and Tera Water Garganacl. Baxcalibur is an excellent check to Rotom-W, punishing any potential Will-O-Wisp attempts with Thermal Exchange while being able to either set up on it with Dragon Dance or hit it with a powerful Glaive Rush. Hydreigon can exploit both Toxapex and Garganacl's passivity to set up with Substitute and Nasty Plot, though it must be wary of switching in against Toxic and Salt Cure. Breloom can pressure Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl with Bullet Seed, while Covert Cloak Gholdengo matches up quite nicely against Garganacl and opposing Breloom and can pivot into Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W.</p> "

Chilly Reception can also be used for cancelling the effects of opposing weather such as rain and sun while also enabling offensive Ice-types due to snow's Defense boost. Surf is its most reliable STAB move, being necessary to sucessfully check Iron Moth and Iron Valiant. Future Sight threatens more defensive teams when paired with physical wallbreakers such as Baxcalibur and Cinderace, as it threatens opposing defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Amoonguss. Thunder Wave can alternatively be run alongside Surf, preventing Slowking from being setup fodder for Volcarona and Dragonite. Slowking runs maximum Special Defense EVs in order to switch into a variety of other special attackers such as Walking Wake, Rotom-W, Volcarona, and Hatterene. It also lets Slowking make use of Chilly Reception and Thunder Wave for dynamic counterplay. The investment also gives Slowking more opportunities to safely pivot in front of Pokemon that aren't immediately threatening but can beat it long-term, such as Gholdengo, Garganacl, Hisuian Zoroark, and Choice Specs Dragapult. 0 Speed IVs in tandem with a Sassy nature maximize the odds of slow pivoting in front of foes, which is important to nearly guarantee safely bringing in other teammates. Slowking can utilize Tera Water to remove its Bug-, Ghost-, and Dark-type weaknesses, enhancing its matchup against Gholdengo, Dragapult, Greninja, and Volcarona while also allowing it to absorb U-turn better. Additionally, it also boosts Surf's damage output. Tera Fairy turns the tables on Dragapult and Greninja, allowing it to wall their Choice Specs sets reliably.</p> <p>Slowking fits on balance teams due to its exclusive access to Chilly Reception, as they can take advantage of both the snow and momentum generated by it. Slowking enjoys being paired with Pokemon that can generate momentum, such as Cinderace, Rotom-W, and Sandy Shocks. This helps its team to pivot around Garganacl to avoid being worn down by its Salt Cure. Slowking is naturally paired with physically defensive walls with good synergy, such as Great Tusk, Amoonguss, and Corviknight, which answer many of Slowking´s checks such as Kingambit, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon. Slowking is generally vulnerable to becoming fodder for Orthworm, since it can't paralyze targets through Orthworm´s passed Substitutes. As such, Pokemon like Infiltrator Dragapult and Unaware Pokemon like Skeledirge and Dondozo are logical Slowking teammates that fix this issue, with Unaware teammates in particular being crucial for answering setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Iron Valiant that are present on hyper offense teams. Dark-types like Kingambit can check and occasionally switch into special attackers that have an advantage against Slowking like Nasty Plot Gholdengo, Choice Specs Greninja, and Choice Specs Dragapult, creating good defensive synergy without lacking offensive capabilities.</p> "

Future Sight's delayed damage is incredibly difficult to deal with when Galarian Slowking is paired with strong wallbreakers, while Psychic is a fine alternative to immediately damage Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Sneasler. Chilly Reception allows Galarian Slowking to pivot out, with the added bonus of resetting opposing weather; its poor Speed alongside minimum investment ensures that its teammate can switch in safely. Thunder Wave cripples would-be checks like Heatran and Kingambit, and the speed control against fast threats like Dragapult and Cinderace can greatly aid its teammates. Surf has solid coverage alongside Galarian Slowking's STAB moves, hitting Heatran, Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, and Ursaluna for decent damage. Slack Off provides Galarian Slowking with reliable recovery, and—alongside Regenerator—can give it tremendous amount of staying power. Toxic can be considered over Thunder Wave to force progress against defensive threats like Skeledirge and Dondozo. Ice Beam can greatly pressure Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Dragapult with a single moveslot. Flamethrower punishes Kingambit and Gholdengo. Lastly, Grass Knot hits Tera Water Garganacl hard and can reliably 2HKO Dondozo. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Galarian Slowking to continuously pivot without having Regenerator's recovery nullified by entry hazards, while Shuca Berry allows it to either pivot into or directly retaliate against a Ground-type attack from Great Tusk, Landorus-T, or Enamorus. Colbur Berry allows Galarian Slowking to reliably check Knock Off Iron Valiant and Night Slash Sneasler, both of which can otherwise greatly threaten it. Both Tera Grass and Tera Water grant a resistance to Water-type attacks from Azumarill and Walking Wake. Moreover, Tera Grass turns its Ground weakness into a resistance, while Tera Water allows Galarian Slowking to sponge attacks from Heatran, Cinderace, and Iron Moth while powering up Surf. Tera Flying provides a crucial Ground immunity and U-Turn resistance while keeping Galarian Slowking's Fighting resistance, letting it reliably switch into Great Tusk variants that lack Ice Spinner. A Sassy nature with maximum Special Defense investment can be used to deal with Enamorus and Shadow Ball Iron Valiant more easily.</p> <p>Galarian Slowking fits on a wide assortment of balance and bulky offense teams, which greatly appreciate its ability to defensively support its teammates while providing significant offensive pressure itself. Powerful wallbreakers like Choice Band Zamazenta, Sneasler, and Ursaluna appreciate Galarian Slowking's ability to both pivot them in safely with Chilly Reception and pressure would-be defensive checks like Corviknight, Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Dondozo with Future Sight, which forces them into 2HKO or even OHKO range against these wallbreakers. Dragon Dance Baxcalibur is a fantastic teammate, as the snow set by Chilly Reception improves its already-solid bulk and allows it to run Ice Body, giving it the opportunity to set up multiple Dragon Dances and devastate opposing offensive teams. Dragapult is a solid teammate, as it appreciates Galarian Slowking's ability to check Enamorus and Booster Energy Iron Valiant; in return, Dragapult can wallbreak or disrupt teams with its own status moves. Zapdos and Landorus-T have solid defensive synergy with Galarian Slowking thanks to their Ground immunity and ability to check physical attackers like Great Tusk while forming a VoltTurn core with it. Garganacl and Kingambit have good defensive synergy with Galarian Slowking, since they can sponge repeated Ghost-type attacks from Dragapult and Gholdengo while it can check threats like Enamorus and Fighting-types like Sneasler, Zamazenta, and some Iron Valiant sets in return. Kingambit in particular appreciates Galarian Slowking's Future Sight support and ability to pressure Fire-types.</p> "

This is achievable with Bullet Punch in tandem with Technician, as it revenge kills Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant. Bullet Punch can also remove slower threats such as Hatterene and Tera Fairy Kingambit. Close Combat grants Scizor coverage against Pokemon such as Iron Treads, Kingambit, and Garganacl and provides strong neutral coverage against foes like Rotom-W and Corviknight, especially if not running the corresponding coverage move. Thief is a good way for Scizor to deal a good amount of damage against Gholdengo, while Trailblaze can be used to deal with defensive Water-types like Rotom-W lacking Will-O-Wisp and Dondozo. Tera Steel is Scizor's best option for a Tera type, since it not only gives a boost to Scizor's Bullet Punch but also makes Scizor resistant to Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Tera Electric + Tera Blast can be run to hit Flying- and Water-types such as Toxapex, Dondozo, Corviknight, and Tera Flying Kingambit. 20 Speed EVs are run in order for Scizor to outspeed Corviknight.</p> <p>Offensive teams appreciate Scizor's wallbreaking and revenge killing abilities. Scizor gets easily forced out by Great Tusk as well as Fire-types such as Skeledirge, Cinderace, and Volcarona. Therefore, Water-types such as Rotom-W and Azumarill make for good teammates. Rotom-W in particular synergizes well with Scizor, since the two of them can form a potent VoltTurn core. Azumarill also greatly appreciates Scizor pivoting into it. In return, Scizor can check Grass-types they struggle against like Breloom and Meowscarada. Scizor appreciates teammates that allow it to wallbreak much more easily, so entry hazard support from Pokemon like Garchomp are greatly appreciated. Gholdengo is another good teammate, since it can keep hazards on the field for Scizor to exploit in order to sweep late-game. If Scizor isn't running Thief, it can easily be checked by Gholdengo, so Dark-types like Kingambit pair well with Scizor. However, if Scizor is running Thief, it can struggle against Water-types, so Grass-types like Breloom, Meowscarada, and Tera Grass Volcarona make for good teammates. Scizor's lack of longevity means it can struggle with hazards, so hazard removers like Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for good teammates. Most of Scizor's damage output comes from Bullet Punch, so it dislikes Pokemon like Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Gholdengo switching into it. Thus, Pokemon that can counter them such as Meowscarada for the former, as well as Iron Moth for the latter two make for good teammates. Finally, setup sweepers such as Dragapult, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon appreciate Scizor muscling through walls like Garganacl, Tera Fairy Skeledirge, and Ting-Lu. They also appreciate the defensive utility Scizor brings with its ability to check Baxcalibur, Choice-locked Meowscarada, and Calm Mind Iron Valiant.</p> "

Dragonite's Extreme Speed does very little to Scizor in return, and Scizor can break Multiscale on Dragonite. Close Combat nails Kingambit and deals decent damage to Ting-Lu, and while U-turn 3HKOs Ting-Lu, Close Combat can 2HKO if Stealth Rock is up. Alternatively, Defog improves Scizor's matchups against entry hazard users such as Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. Thief hits Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Ceruledge for super effective damage, as well as being Scizor's strongest option against Toxapex. Swords Dance can power up Bullet Punch and U-turn, allowing Scizor to break through Garganacl. Tera Steel powers up Bullet Punch, which is key in OHKOing Iron Valiant and Baxcalibur after Stealth Rock. Heavy-Duty Boots makes pivoting easier by ignoring entry hazards.</p> <p>Scizor best fits on bulky offense and balance teams, as these appreciate a pivot which can force switches to bring in frail wallbreakers. Iron Valiant and Dragapult appreciate the momentum that Scizor provides, as they are 2HKOed by many common attacks. In return, they can handle physical walls that Scizor has trouble getting past such as Great Tusk and Dondozo. Scizor also appreciates entry hazard support from teammates such as Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Ting-Lu, as Scizor puts pressure on the opposing team with U-turn, forcing more switches and helping rack up more damage with hazards. Scizor also suffers from a lack of recovery, so defensive teammates such as Toxapex are appreciated, as they can help take pressure off of Scizor.

Tera Electric also removes Scizor's Fire weakness, improving its matchup against Volcarona and Iron Moth, and grants it crucial resistances to Roaring Moon's Acrobatics and Iron Valiant's Thunderbolt. Alternatively, Quick Attack with Tera Normal gives Scizor a tool to pick off offensive Pokemon that resist Bullet Punch, such as Volcarona, Quaquaval, and Greninja. 180 Speed EVs allow Scizor to outspeed defensive Great Tusk and Rotom-W, while 76 HP EVs improve its bulk enough to survive Tera Flying Acrobatics from Roaring Moon.</p> <p>Scizor is best utilized on fast, offensive teams that appreciate its ability to wear down common defensive cores and keep opposing sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Baxcalibur, and Booster Energy Iron Valiant in check.

        "description": "<p>Floatzel leverages the nuclear power of its Choice Band Tera Water Wave Crash under rain to be one of the archetype's most potent wallbreakers, capable of 2HKOing even problematic bulky Water-resistant Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Amoonguss. Moreover, its naturally high Speed tier alongside Swift Swim lets Floatzel outspeed the whole unboosted metagame under rain, giving it an edge against offensive teams by outpacing and threatening boosted frail threats like Dragapult, Volcarona, and every Speed-boosting Booster Energy Pokemon, such as Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Walking Wake. Liquidation is a safer attack to keep Floatzel healthy when Wave Crash's power isn't necessary, such as against weak and neutral targets like Great Tusk, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge, and is the preferred attack to clean up late-game once the opposition is weakened enough. Aqua Jet picks off faster and boosted foes especially if rain isn't active, such as Iron Moth, Volcarona, and Tera Flying Roaring Moon, and outprioritizes Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Ceruledge's Shadow Sneak. Ice Spinner complements Floatzel's STAB moves to reliably hit the likes of Dragonite, Dragapult, Amoonguss, and Water Absorb Clodsire.</p> <p>Floatzel is exclusively found on offensive rain teams. Pelipper is a mandatory teammate to reliably set rain with Drizzle and compensate for Floatzel's frailty by bringing it in safely via U-turn. Choice Specs variants of Pelipper and other offensive rain partners like Azumarill, Walking Wake, and Greninja can keep up the pressure against the opposition, overwhelming shared checks like Dondozo, Toxapex, and Tera Water Garganacl. Ground-types like Iron Treads, Great Tusk, and Clodsire provide a necessary Electric immunity while setting entry hazards, making Dondozo and Toxapex easier to break through; Iron Treads and Great Tusk also provide Knock Off to cripple the bulky Water-types, including Alomomola and Tera Water Skeledirge, by making them susceptible to Stealth Rock as well, while Water Absorb Clodsire is a rigid defensive backbone against the likes of Azumarill, Walking Wake, and Tera Grass Volcarona, all of which can force Floatzel out. Eject Button Amoonguss can bring Floatzel in safely on Pokemon like Great Tusk, Gholdengo, Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Ting-Lu, incapacitate foes with Spore to give it more wallbreaking opportunities, and switch into and threaten Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl for Floatzel. Pawmot's Revival Blessing compensates for Floatzel's tendency to faint early-game from Wave Crash recoil—especially against common Rocky Helmet users like Corviknight and Amoonguss—and lets it wallbreak or even clean up in the late-game afterwards and enjoys Floatzel pressuring Great Tusk in return. Kingambit is a stellar late-game cleaner that enjoys Floatzel pressuring its checks in Great Tusk and Volcarona and overwhelming a common answer in Dondozo, as well as takes advantage of Floatzel fainting early-game from Wave Crash recoil to accumulate Supreme Overlord boosts.</p> "

Notably, it matches up well against common spinners like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Glimmora, especially as it can punish them from doing so with Rocky Helmet + Rough Skin. This combination is also valuable to spread chip damage onto physical attackers like Kingambit and Dragonite and punish pivots such as Cinderace and Corviknight. Dragon Tail forces out setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Tera Flying Kingambit, Tera Grass Volcarona, and Air Balloon Gholdengo, and it works extremely well to force entry hazard damage onto foes such as Tera Fairy Garganacl, Dondozo, and Iron Valiant. Tera Ghost is used to completely spinblock Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Alternatively, Tera Steel lets it emergency check Dragapult, Meowscarada, and non-Earthquake Baxcalibur and block Glimmora's Mortal Spin, while Tera Water allows it to deal with Gholdengo, Scizor, and Hatterene better.</p> <p>Garchomp fits best on hazard stacking teams that range from bulky offense to offense. Gholdengo is a near-necessary teammate that can prevent most attempts of entry hazard removal, and it can make use of them itself to chip down checks like Tera Water Garganacl, Amoonguss, and Clodsire. Knock Off users like Meowscarada and Great Tusk can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Amoonguss, Kingambit, and Dragonite to make them susceptible to Garchomp's entry hazards; Great Tusk in particular provides Rapid Spin as well, which removes entry hazards on your side of the field and subsequently maintains your own entry hazards up the opponent's side. Offensive Pokemon like Greninja, Dragapult, Volcarona, and Iron Valiant tend to force multiple switches and enjoy entry hazards chipping down their checks such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, Clodsire, and Garganacl. Substitute Skeledirge is a fantastic teammate that can take advantage of entry hazards itself, use its defensive profile to cover Fairy- and Ice-types like Iron Valiant and Baxcalibur, threaten Defog Corviknight from removing entry hazards, and pressure Hatterene, which would otherwise prevent Garchomp's antics and use it as setup fodder.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Mixed Garchomp is a fantastic wallbreaker that can threaten common walls such as Great Tusk, Dondozo, Toxapex, and Clodsire. Draco Meteor hits physical walls. Great Tusk and Dondozo in particular are hit hard by Draco Meteor, with Great Tusk pressured while switching in to remove entry hazards and Dondozo's Unaware letting Garchomp freely use Draco Meteor multiple times on it. Fire Blast covers Steel-type Pokemon such as Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo, the former of which would otherwise switch into Garchomp and clear entry hazards. Stealth Rock is generally preferred if a team does not have another Stealth Rock user, but Spikes can be used to capitalize on the switches that Garchomp forces. A Rash nature makes Garchomp much harder to switch into, even letting it OHKO defensive Great Tusk after one layer of Spikes, but Naive can be used to outspeed Hydreigon, offensive Volcarona, and Speed tie opposing Garchomp. Tera Fire is the preferred Tera type, due to it powering up Garchomp's Fire Blast and providing it a resistance to attacks such as Baxcalibur's Ice Shard, Iron Valiant's Moonblast, and Hatterene's Draining Kiss, as well as an immunity to Will-O-Wisp from Volcarona, Dragapult, and Skeledirge. Tera Steel similarly flips Garchomp's type matchup, providing it with a useful Dragon and Fairy resistance while maintaining its Stealth Rock resistance.</p> <p>Garchomp fits on offensive teams thanks to its ability to set entry hazards and wear down common defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex, Clodsire, and Dondozo, with Life Orb-boosted attacks while keeping entry hazards up against common hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Corviknight. Sweepers such as Volcarona, Kingambit, Dragon Dance Dragapult, Calm Mind Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, Baxcalibur, and Bulk Up Great Tusk appreciate Garchomp breaking holes in the opposing team early-game. Volcarona in particular is a fantastic option, as it soft checks Iron Valiant, spreads status with Will-O-Wisp + Flame Body to prevent being revenge killed by Dragonite and Kingambit, and appreciates Garchomp breaking through Dondozo, Clodsire, and Toxapex for it. Garchomp is forced out by Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant and Tera Fairy Garganacl, as well as Dragon-types such as Choice Band Baxcalibur, Dragapult, and Roaring Moon without using Terastallization, so support from Steel-type partners is appreciated to switch into these Pokemon. Kingambit is another good partner because it takes on Dragapult and appreciates Garchomp wearing down Great Tusk and Dondozo. Hatterene and Tera Fairy Skeledirge can also take on these Dragon-types while spreading further passive damage with Magic Bounce or Will-O-Wisp. Garchomp can also form a hazard stacking core with lead Meowscarada or other Stealth Rock users such as Great Tusk and Ting-Lu, and Garchomp can pressure common Rapid Spin users. Gholdengo is a great partner for Garchomp, since it blocks most forms of hazard removal while appreciating Garchomp soft checking Volcarona and Iron Moth. Garchomp is also prone to being worn down quickly thanks to Life Orb recoil, entry hazards, and being prediction reliant, so teammates that can clear hazards are appreciated. These include Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads, which all appreciate Garchomp wearing down their common switch-ins such as opposing Great Tusk and Rotom-W.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Garchomp makes for a powerful physical wallbreaker with Swords Dance, using its Attack boosts to ensure OHKOs against a number of foes in the metagame. Garchomp’s incredible STAB combination of Dragon / Ground can annihilate most walls and defensive cores at +2, with Earthquake reliably knocking out bulky Pokemon like Toxapex, Kingambit, defensive Gholdengo, and Garganacl, and Dragon Claw hitting a vast majority of foes that resist Earthquake, such as Rotom-W and Breloom. Dragon Claw is preferred to Outrage, as it doesn’t provide free switch-in opportunities to prominent Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant and Hatterene. Substitute is essential for letting Garchomp block incoming status, especially from foes it cannot always OHKO, such as Skeledirge, non-Foul Play Amoonguss, and Rotom-W. Substitute can be set up on a forced switch to ensure Garchomp gets a chance to use Swords Dance, and can be set up for free against U-turns from slow pivots like Corviknight. Leftovers allows Garchomp to heal off Substitute damage, giving it more chances to use it. With Rough Skin, Garchomp punishes Great Tusk using Rapid Spin and U-turn from pivots like Cinderace. Tera Ground allows Garchomp to hit much harder with Earthquake, giving it the extra power to OHKO Hatterene, Garganacl after Stealth Rock chip, and potentially Amoonguss and offensive Great Tusk sets at +2. Alternatively, Tera Steel is a more defensive option used to resist Iron Valiant's Moonblast and Dragapult's Draco Meteor, the latter being very important, as Infiltrator allows it to bypass Garchomp’s Substitute.</p> <p>Garchomp is a solid wallbreaker on balance and bulky offense teams, due to its power complemented by defensive utility from Substitute, Leftovers, and decent bulk that gives it opportunities for consistent use throughout a battle. Garchomp mainly struggles against Corviknight, as well as exceptionally bulky physical walls such as Dondozo and Great Tusk. Special wallbreakers like Greninja, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth threaten these walls to Garchomp and therefore make excellent partners. Dragapult can also provide much-needed special offense while pressuring Dondozo and Corviknight with Draco Meteor and Flamethrower, forming a dangerous Dragon-type spam core with Garchomp and providing speed control that Garchomp cannot, especially against foes like Iron Valiant and Greninja. Additionally, Dragapult can use U-turn to scout a forced switch and safely bring Garchomp into battle against foes like Clodsire and Kingambit. Entry hazard setters like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Glimmora are great partners, as they allow Garchomp to secure KOs against opponents like Tera Fairy Garganacl and Amoonguss, which it otherwise cannot OHKO at +2. Glimmora and Great Tusk are especially good for this role, as they can both remove hazards that hinder Garchomp’s wallbreaking potential, and the latter can cripple Corviknight by removing its Leftovers with Knock Off. Fast sweepers, such as Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult, can easily revenge kill Garchomp, especially when its Substitute is down. A defensive backbone made up of Pokemon like Clodsire and Corviknight is essential for Garchomp’s team. Lastly, Garchomp gives great support to late-game and sweepers like Volcarona and Dragapult that appreciate foes like defensive Gholdengo, Toxapex, and Clodsire being removed.</p> "

Hydro Pump pressures Garganacl, Cinderace, and Skeledirge, but most importantly, it dents Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu that attempt to block its Volt Switch. Moreover, its immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes make it an even more effective pivot in the face of entry hazards. Aside from gaining valuable Leftovers recovery, Protect scouts for Choice item users like Meowscarada, Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Greninja, potentially stalls out burn damage, and punishes Cinderace's High Jump Kick. Thunder Wave cripples Baxcalibur, Volcarona, Dragapult, and special Iron Valiant. Will-O-Wisp punishes physical attackers such as Dragonite, Roaring Moon, Azumarill, and Kingambit, and it chips down switch-ins like Amoonguss and Clodsire in the long-term. Tera Steel improves Rotom-W's matchup against Dragonite, Dragapult, Baxcalibur, and Meowscarada, prevents it from being crippled by Clodsire and Toxapex's Toxic, and makes it resistant to Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Tera Water can be run as a purely offensive option, improving Hydro Pump's damage to 2HKO Garganacl through Leftovers, Unaware Clodsire, and potentially Tera Fairy Skeledirge.

Entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Great Tusk take advantage of the multiple switches that pivot teams tend to force, crumbling the opposing team slowly just by keeping up momentum; in return, Rotom-W helps check entry hazard removers like Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads. Due to Rotom-W's nature of constantly pivoting, spinners and Defoggers like Great Tusk and Corviknight are appreciated; Great Tusk, in particular, can threaten Clodsire, one of Rotom-W's sturdiest answers, while Corviknight's U-turn complements Rotom-W's pivoting duties. Defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu are viable options to cover threats like Breloom, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult, respectively; in return, they enjoy Rotom-W checking Cinderace and Garchomp. Pokemon that can switch into Meowscarada and Great Tusk's Knock Off, such as Corviknight and Amoonguss, are valuable to maintain Rotom-W's longevity from its Leftovers.</p> "

Great Tusk can rely on Rotom-W to take Water-type attacks from Walking Wake and Greninja and in return provide hazard removal to keep Rotom-W healthy throughout the game, as well as threaten Water Absorb Clodsire, which completely walls Rotom-W.

Hydro Pump is the strongest move it has, meaningfully hurting a wide range of Pokemon, and it punishes Ground-types such as Greak Tusk, Clodsire, and Garchomp that attempt to block Volt Switch. Rotom-W can outspeed the entire unboosted metagame with its Choice Scarf, allowing it to reliably hit Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Garganacl. Trick is essential to cripple walls that can recover from Rotom-W's attacks, like Toxapex and Tera Fairy Garganacl. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple threats such as Dragapult, Iron Moth, Volcarona, and Baxcalibur, especially since Choice Scarf Rotom-W outspeeds them. Will-O-Wisp is just as useful as Thunder Wave, disarming physical threats like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, Breloom, and Meowscarada. Tera Steel gives Rotom-W an immunity to Toxic from Clodsire and Toxapex, as well as a resistance to Meowscarada's Flower Trick, Breloom's Bullet Seed, Iron Valiant's Moonblast, and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. On top of this, Levitate makes Steel's Ground weakness into an immunity; notably, EdgeQuake can't hit Tera Steel Rotom-W neutrally. Alternatively, Tera Water takes a more offensive approach, boosting the power of Hydro Pump to 2HKO Gholdengo, and it can potentially OHKO physically defensive Garganacl and Clodsire.</p> <p>Rotom-W sits comfortably on balance and bulky offense teams. It pairs well with defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight, Toxapex, and Amoonguss, which use their Grass resistances and/or recovery to sponge hits like Breloom's Bullet Seed, Meowscarada's Flower Trick, and Ting-Lu's Ruination. Rotom-W pressures entry hazard removers like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Corviknight, and Cinderace, which helps hazard setters. Great Tusk is a great example, since it also removes hazards to ease Rotom-W's pivoting. More offensive partners like Iron Valiant, Cinderace, and Dragapult love Rotom-W crippling bothersome walls like Ting-Lu and Amoonguss with Trick. In turn, they can effectively check Breloom, Meowscarada, Choice Specs Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Choice Specs Dragapult, which can all cause trouble for Rotom-W. When Rotom-W pivots against Corviknight, Dondozo, Toxapex, and Greninja as they switch out, frail attackers such as Meowscarada, Cinderace, and Iron Valiant can safely come in to pressure the incoming Amoonguss, opposing Rotom-W, and Gholdengo.</p> "

Knock Off removes valuable items from Pokemon that rely on them, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite and Baxcalibur as well as Leftovers from Corviknight and Toxapex. Sacred Sword is a great coverage move for Hisuian Samurott, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon such as Kingambit and opposing Hisuian Samurott. Tera Water boosts the power of Razor Shell, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon like Ursaluna and Great Tusk. On the other hand, Tera Dark boosts Ceaseless Edge and Knock Off, allowing Hisuian Samurott to OHKO Skeledirge.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott shines on various balance and offense teams, as it serves a unique role of being able to deal damage while also reliably setting Spikes. This allows said teams to punish switches and more easily wear down bulky archetypes. Gholdengo is a great partner for Hisuian Samurott due to pressuring faster offensive threats such as Sneasler and Iron Valiant, and thanks to its ability, it can block Defog attempts from Corviknight. Hisuian Samurott also has great type synergy with Gholdengo, with it being able to pressure Dark-types Gholdengo tends to struggle with like Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and opposing Hisuian Samurott.

Knock Off makes progress against teams otherwise unphased by Hisuian Samurott's offensive profile, removing valuable items from the likes of Zapdos, Dondozo, and Toxapex. Sacred Sword is an alternative that better rounds out Hisuian Samurott's neutral coverage while hitting Kingambit, Baxcalibur, and opposing Hisuian Samurott. Hisuian Samurott is a great utilizer of priority moves due to its proficiency at weakening teams with entry hazards damage, and it has two options in Aqua Jet and Sucker Punch. Aqua Jet has better coverage against Fighting-types like Iron Valiant and Sneasler, while Sucker Punch trades in reliability for power and is a better option for revenge killing the likes of Choice-locked Dragapult and Baxcalibur. If electing to run Aqua Jet, Tera Water is ideal to boost its power as well as Razor Shell's. If running Sucker Punch, Tera Dark is the better choice, especially if Knock Off is also being used. On the flipside, Tera Steel is useful as a defensive Tera type for reversing the matchup against Moonblast from Enamorus and Iron Valiant and resisting Dragon-type moves from Dragapult and Baxcalibur. Tera Ghost is another option, stifling foes attempts at removing hazards via Rapid Spin, though this does make Hisuian Samurott vulnerable to Shadow Ball from Dragapult and Gholdengo, which it was previously able to come in on. 20 Special Defense EVs in combination with an Assault Vest ensures Hisuian Samurott takes a Moonblast from non-Choice Specs Iron Valiant or a Draco Meteor from Modest Choice Specs Dragapult from full HP.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott fits very well on balanced and bulky offensive teams that appreciate entry hazard stacking as well as role compression from it being able to take a few special hits thanks to its Assault Vest. Other Pokemon that fit on these sorts of offensive teams that also appreciate the opposing team being weakened by Spikes, such as Kingambit, Baxcalibur, Dragonite, and Sneasler are beneficial allies. Gholdengo specifically is a very good teammate, as it blocks both Rapid Spin and Defog and can take advantage of some of Hisuian Samurott's switch-ins like Amoonguss and Toxapex. Dragapult is also an option for spinblocking. It additionally is great at forcing switches, racking up hazard damage. VoltTurn support from Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Corviknight is a worthwhile consideration to give Hisuian Samurott more opportunities to throw off attacks. While Hisuian Samurott can come in once or twice on attacks from Pokemon like Gholdengo and Heatran, it's by no means a reliable answer. Ting-Lu and Tera Water Garganacl work well as primary answers to these threat while also forming a hazard stacking core alongside Hisuian Samurott. They can set up Stealth Rock while also greatly benefiting from its ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark is a fast and strong wallbreaker with good coverage. Not only are its coverage moves good, but it has STAB on a very spammable type with fantastic neutral coverage in OU, Ghost. An incredible ability in Illusion greatly improves its wallbreaking: it can disguise itself as another teammate to create mind games, scoring great damage if opponents guess wrong. Its unique typing blocks some revenge killing moves such as Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Ceruledge's Shadow Sneak, and Breloom's Mach Punch. Grass Knot is a great coverage option to OHKO Great Tusk and physically defensive Dondozo, potentially OHKO Garganacl, and 2HKO specially defensive Dondozo. Alternatively, Hyper Voice is a good STAB option, getting neutral coverage on most Pokemon that Shadow Ball cannot, and it ignores Hydreigon and Terastallized Skeledirge's Substitute. Flamethrower allows Hisuian Zoroark to 2HKO Corviknight and Amoonguss, as well as OHKOing Scizor. Alternatively, Focus Blast gives Hisuian Zoroark a way to catch incoming Kingambit off guard, and it hits Garganacl and Ting-Lu super effectively, which is very helpful if forgoing Grass Knot. With Trick, Hisuian Zoroark can cripple walls like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Garganacl, as well as bulky setup sweepers it cannot threaten immediately, like Tera Fairy Garganacl and Tera Fire or Tera Water Hatterene. However, giving away Choice Specs sacrifices some of the OHKOs and 2HKOs mentioned above. U-turn is a great alternative to bring teammates in safely on Assault Vest Azumarill and Ting-Lu. Tera Normal and Tera Ghost boost Hisuian Zoroark's already powerful STAB moves, with boosted Hyper Voice always OHKOing Great Tusk, while boosted Shadow Ball 2HKOes Assault Vest Azumarill. Tera Fighting is another good option, as it not only boosts Focus Blast, but it also turns Hisuian Zoroark's Dark weakness into a resistance, meaning it no longer fears Sucker Punch revenge killers.</p> <p>Hisuian Zoroark fits best on offensive teams. Great Tusk can set Stealth Rock, helping Hisuian Zoroark KO foes more easily, and check the Dark-types it struggles with such as Kingambit and specially defensive Ting-Lu. Pivots such as Rotom-W and Meowscarada can bring Hisuian Zoroark safely into Amoonguss and Corviknight, respectively. Rotom-W in particular is a great teammate, since it can also spread paralysis, crippling boosted sweepers and naturally fast Pokemon such as Dragonite, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult for Hisuian Zoroark to outspeed and KO. Hisuian Zoroark dislikes opposing hazards: not only does it get worn down easily, but opponents may see through its disguise based on the damage it takes from Stealth Rock. Hence, it appreciates hazard removal and prevention from the aforementioned Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Hatterene. Great Tusk and Corviknight can also come in and take a hit from Kingambit and Meowscarada, respectively, which can revenge kill Hisuian Zoroark. Corviknight in particular really appreciates Hisuian Zoroark threatening Gholdengo, which blocks its Defog. Specially defensive Pokemon like Assault Vest Azumarill and Clodsire can take a hit from Hisuian Zoroark, thus forcing it out, given its frailty. To threaten both of these checks, Choice Band Breloom is a great partner. In return, U-turn Hisuian Zoroark can bring Breloom in on these Pokemon. Lastly, setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Volcarona, and Iron Moth appreciate Hisuian Zoroark's ability to threaten their checks such as Garganacl, Dondozo, and Skeledirge, letting them clean up afterwards. Hisuian Zoroark can also disguise as them to lure in their checks and either KO them or cripple them with Trick. Hisuian Zoroark can disguise as Dragonite, Kingambit, Baxcalibur, and Roaring Moon to lure in physical walls such as Great Tusk and Dondozo, only for them to be OHKOed by Grass Knot. Similarly, Hisuian Zoroark can also disguise as Volcarona and Iron Moth to lure in Clodsire and Toxapex, using Trick to cripple them and open up a potential sweep.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Hisuian Zoroark is a devastating special wallbreaker thanks to its combination of unique typing, coverage, fantastic Speed, and a high Special Attack stat, and it can almost always threaten a KO after a boost. Its ability, Illusion, provides good utility by letting it draw out an unsuspecting teammate's check and blasting them with powerful special attacks. Shadow Ball hits nearly everything in the tier for solid damage with very few drawbacks, and it has the lovely side effect of potentially dropping a foe's Special Defense. Grass Knot can be utilized to sink many heavy defensive threats, such as Garganacl, Great Tusk, and Dondozo. This also comes with the advantage of being a reliable move against heavy foes like Ting-Lu without burning up valuable PP on Focus Blast or dealing with its less-than-stellar accuracy. Flamethrower hammers would-be switch-ins like Kingambit and Scizor. Alternatively, Focus Blast can be used to hit Ting-Lu, Hydreigon, Kingambit, and Garganacl with the same move. Tera Ghost allows Shadow Ball to more reliably OHKO Gholdengo on Focus Sash sets, and it also allows +2 Shadow Ball to OHKO Baxcalibur, Volcarona, Walking Wake, Iron Moth, and Slowking. Alternatively, Tera Fighting turns its Dark-type weakness into a resistance, leaving it less susceptible to Kingambit's Sucker Punch, Meowscarada's Knock Off, and Greninja's Dark Pulse, and it powers up Focus Blast to staggering heights. Tera Fighting Focus Blast OHKOes Baxcalibur and Garganacl and even has a good chance to OHKO Ting-Lu at +2 after Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Tera Fairy allows Hisuian Zoroark to hold off Dark-types as well as become immune to Dragapult's Dragon-type attacks. Focus Sash guarantees that Hisuian Zoroark has a chance to set up or attack. On the other hand, Life Orb can be used to add further power to Hisuian Zoroark's already formidable prowess. Life Orb allows Focus Blast to OHKO Baxcalibur, and it also ensures that +2 Shadow Ball OHKOes Volcarona, physically defensive Rotom-W, and Corviknight after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Hisuian Zoroark functions best as a setup sweeper on hyper and bulky offense teams. Great Tusk is a top-class partner, providing Hisuian Zoroark invaluable utility with its excellent defenses and Rapid Spin, which keeps entry hazards off Hisuian Zoroark's side of the field and leaves its Focus Sash intact. It also provides Hisuian Zoroark more opportunities to come in and set up by threatening Pokemon that hold it down indefinitely, such as Clodsire. Dragapult and Meowscarada are faster than Hisuian Zoroark, so Pokemon that can come in and revenge kill them, such as Kingambit and Choice Band Baxcalibur, are also appreciated. In return, Hisuian Zoroark can use Illusion to mask itself as Kingambit, Baxcalibur, and Roaring Moon and lure in physical walls like defensive Great Tusk and Dondozo to weaken or KO them. Entry hazard setters like Glimmora, Meowscarada, and Garchomp set up hazards to chip down foes into Hisuan Zoroark's KO range, and it can stop an incoming Rapid Spin from Great Tusk in return. Hisuian Zoroark can force damage on special walls like Ting-Lu, which is highly appreciated by other special attackers like Iron Moth and Hydreigon, and vice versa. In particular, Hydreigon and Hisuian Zoroark can play Illusion mind games with Fighting-type moves, and Hydreigon can topple Clodsire with Earth Power and Substitute or Tera Steel.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Amoonguss is the tier's sole defensive user of Spore, as it can stick around and put foes to sleep throughout a match. Giga Drain affords Amoonguss extra longevity, which is particularly helpful because Regenerator often cannot keep up with the damage that Amoonguss takes. However, Grass Knot hits foes like Dondozo, Garganacl, and Ting-Lu harder. Clear Smog removes the boosts of setup sweepers like Dragonite, Dragon Dance Dragapult, and Bulk Up Great Tusk. Foul Play, on the other hand, gives Amoonguss a way to pressure Dragapult immediately while still punishing physical setup sweepers. Red Card phazes setup sweepers like Iron Valiant and Walking Wake. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet lets Amoonguss punish U-turn users like Meowscarada and Scizor, while Covert Cloak is a valid option to check Garganacl more easily. Tera Water Amoonguss checks Cinderace and Baxcalibur, while Tera Fire Amoonguss can use Clear Smog safely on Tera Grass Volcarona and Tera Fire Breloom at the cost of becoming weak to Ground-types like Great Tusk. Maximum HP investment with 84 Special Defense EVs prevents a 2HKO from Choice Specs Dragapult's Shadow Ball; the rest of the investment is poured in Defense to better check Great Tusk.</p> <p>Amoonguss is best utilized on balance teams that appreciate it taking a foe out of commission with Spore. Gholdengo and Dragapult greatly appreciate this as well as Amoonguss's ability to check Ting-Lu. Cinderace and Kingambit are other good offensive teammates that appreciate Amoonguss threatening Dondozo. Because Amoonguss relies mostly on Regenerator for its recovery, entry hazard removal in the form of Great Tusk or Iron Treads is key; Great Tusk also checks Cinderace, while Iron Treads can help deal with Gholdengo. Even though Amoonguss has the ability to check some setup sweepers with Clear Smog, it is best to pair it with an Unaware teammate like Skeledirge or Dondozo, which can handle Pokemon like Tera Flying Roaring Moon and Baxcalibur much more effectively. Pokemon like Dragonite and Choice Band Roaring Moon also make for good partners, as Amoonguss is one of the best Iron Valiant checks.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Alomomola is a defining aspect of stall teams, as its huge HP stat and unique combination of Wish and Regenerator let it keep itself healthy while repeatedly pivoting out to and healing teammates such as Dondozo, reducing their reliance on low-PP recovery moves and compensating for their lack of reliable recovery. Furthermore, its excellent typing and great physical bulk allow it to check threats like Cinderace and Dragonite and absorb Knock Off from common Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads, preserving its teammate's Heavy-Duty Boots. Whirlpool further enhances Alomomola's pivoting abilities, letting it trap switch-ins and pivot out to the appropriate answer while preventing their double switch. In conjunction with Protect, Whirlpool also racks up passive damage on offensive Pokemon and walls such as Rotom-W and Ting-Lu that lack reliable recovery. Protect also allows Alomomola to heal itself with Wish, scout the moves of powerful wallbreakers, and prevent them from forcing progress when paired with Future Sight. Chilling Water makes Alomomola a more self-sufficient physical wall, reducing its passivity against sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Ceruledge, and Bulk Up Great Tusk. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Alomomola to avoid entry hazard damage before getting struck by Knock Off, which is especially important against Toxic Spikes. Minimizing Alomomola's Speed allows it to underspeed Corviknight to hit the incoming switch-in from U-turn instead and thus, avoid wasting PP due to Pressure. Tera Flying improves Alomomola's matchup against Great Tusk and Meowscarada, turning it into an even better Knock Off absorber, and lets it wall Breloom. It also makes Alomomola immune to Spikes and allows it to take less passive damage from Salt Cure.</p> <p>Alomomola's Wish and ability to blanket check various threats benefit all of its teammates on stall teams. Toxapex is an exceptional partner that forms a strong Regenerator core with Alomomola. Together, they can stall Garganacl out of Salt Cure PP and pivot around strong physical attackers such as Breloom, Choice Band Dragapult, and Roaring Moon. Dondozo handles physical sweepers too powerful for Alomomola to deal with, such as Kingambit, Baxcalibur, and Azumarill, and greatly appreciates Wish due to its lack of reliable recovery. Alomomola's low special bulk mandates sturdy specially defensive partners; Clodsire can take on special sweepers such as Volcarona, Gholdengo, and Hydreigon that attempt to use Alomomola as setup fodder, while Blissey switches into the tier's most powerful special wallbreakers, such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Hisuian Zoroark. Ting-Lu checks special attackers like Dragapult and Iron Moth and, alongside Clodsire and Toxapex, sets entry hazards that can quickly wear down offensive teams to let Alomomola apply more pressure with Whirlpool. Like Dondozo, it also greatly appreciates Wish to reduce its reliance on Rest. Talonflame carries Defog to account for Alomomola's vulnerability to entry hazards after taking Knock Off. Corviknight can do the same as well as absorb Knock Off for Alomomola; it also provides a crucial switch-in to Choice Band Baxcalibur's Glaive Rush, which Alomomola greatly appreciates when tasked with scouting Baxcalibur. In addition, Talonflame checks Breloom, while Corviknight checks Meowscarada, which lets Alomomola preserve its Terastallization. Lastly, Gholdengo checks Breloom and Iron Valiant, appreciates Alomomola dealing with Cinderace and Great Tusk, and provides stall with a setup sweeper to break down balance teams with Nasty Plot.</p> "

Substitute allows it to set up Nasty Plot safely, avoid would-be detrimental threats such as Garganacl's Salt Cure and status from Toxapex, Clodsire, and Rotom-W, and take advantage of the switches it forces. For its fourth move, Hydreigon can utilize Earth Power to dent Pokemon that can comfortably take a Dark Pulse such as Kingambit, Toxapex, and Garganacl. Alternatively, Flash Cannon provides coverage against Fairy-types, being able to OHKO Iron Valiant and Hatterene after a Nasty Plot, as well as having good chance to 2HKO Tera Fairy Garganacl and Skeledirge unboosted if running Life Orb. Draco Meteor can also be used as a strong neutral coverage option to straight up OHKO Great Tusk and dent Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Amoonguss. With Tera Steel, Hydreigon acquires a better defensive typing, turning its weaknesses into resistances, improving its matchups against would-be threats like Dragonite, Dragapult, Walking Wake, Roaring Moon, and Baxcalibur. Tera Steel also boosts its Flash Cannon, able to OHKO Hatterene unboosted with Life Orb. Tera Poison can also be used to grant Hydreigon a Fighting resistance and more importantly, resisting both of Iron Valiant's STAB moves. Both Tera types also give Hydreigon the ability to switch into Toxapex and Clodsire safely due to their immunity to poison, and they both work well with Levitate, which provides an immunity against an otherwise super effective attack.</p> <p>Hydreigon best fits on various offense and balance teams. Rotom-W is a good teammate since it can spread paralysis against faster Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Dragapult and bring Hydreigon in safely on walls like Amoonguss and Toxapex via Volt Switch. Other defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Skeledirge make for good teammates since they can switch into Iron Valiant, Breloom, and Volcarona. Faster offensive Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Choice Specs Dragapult match up well against offensive teams that can overwhelm Hydreigon easily by KOing Pokemon like opposing Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark, respectively. In return, Hydreigon can overwhelm Pokemon that they typically struggle with such as Skeledirge and Kingambit. Entry hazards from the likes of Garganacl, Clodsire, and Glimmora are appreciated to wear down foes into Hydreigon's KO range; the former two Pokemon can also check Volcarona and Choice Specs Dragapult defensively, which would otherwise revenge kill Hydreigon easily—even if it's behind a Substitute—thanks to Bug Buzz and Infiltrator. If Hydreigon isn't running Earth Power, teammates that can deal with Kingambit such as Breloom and Great Tusk are appreciated; Great Tusk can also remove Stealth Rock so Hydreigon isn't worn down easily, especially if it's running Life Orb. The two of them can also handle Ting-Lu, which can otherwise wall Hydreigon and phaze it with Whirlwind. Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Dragonite appreciate Hydreigon threatening Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Dondozo for them to sweep more easily.</p> "

This, combined with its typing, natural bulk, and exceptional ability in Intimidate, makes it a good offensive pivot. U-turn is useful for generating momentum and bringing in teammates safely when the foe is forced to switch out. Stone Edge hits Flying-types such as Enamorus, Zapdos, Dragonite, and Moltres, notably providing good coverage alongside Earthquake. Grass Knot is crucial for hitting Great Tusk, which would otherwise comfortably take Landorus-T's physical attacks. It is also the best option for hitting Dondozo and Tera Water, Curse, or Iron Defense Garganacl. Tera Ground can be used to boost Landorus-T's already strong Earthquake, potentially helping it clean late-game when all Ground-immune foes have been removed. Tera Blast can be used alongside Tera Flying, as it still hits Great Tusk hard while also hitting Amoonguss and Zamazenta for super effective damage. It also guarantees an OHKO against Iron Valiant. Becoming pure Flying-type also lets Landorus-T potentially survive priority moves such as Ice Shard from Baxcalibur and Aqua Jet from Hisuian Samurott in a pinch.</p> <p>Landorus-T fits well on balanced and bulky offense teams that appreciate speed control and the ability to generate momentum. Wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Enamorus appreciate being brought in safely with U-turn. Choice Specs Enamorus and Choice Specs Dragapult especially appreciate being in against certain Pokemon that commonly switch into Landorus-T, such as Great Tusk and defensive Zapdos. Offensive Zapdos can also take advantage of these Pokemon while forming a potent VoltTurn core with Landorus-T. Faster special attackers such as Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Enamorus are problematic for Landorus-T. Therefore, specially defensive Galarian Slowking is a solid teammate to help deal with them. It also consistently switches into Rotom-W, which takes very little from Landorus-T's attacks. Furthermore, Galarian Slowking forms a momentum-generating core with Landorus-T and provides Future Sight support, making Landorus-T more difficult for foes to switch into. Great Tusk forms a strong core alongside Landorus-T to deal with physical attackers such as Sneasler and Cinderace that tend to be overwhelming for one of them to take on alone. Notably, Landorus-T outspeeds Cinderace and can threaten it before getting burned by Will-O-Wisp.</p> "

Since Choice Specs ensures it only uses one attack per switch-in, even though Protean only activates once per switch-in, Greninja will have STAB every time it attacks. Hydro Pump is Greninja's most powerful move, pummeling both offensive and defensive Water-weak Pokemon like Volcarona, Cinderace, Skeledirge, and Great Tusk. Dark Pulse hits the likes of Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Hisuian Zoroark super effectively while also dealing the most damage to Toxapex and Rotom-W. Dark Pulse's flinch chance can also come in clutch against the aforementioned walls. Ice Beam eviscerates Amoonguss, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Dragon-types like Dragonite and Roaring Moon. Grass Knot can OHKO Dondozo, Garganacl, and Walking Wake after minor chip damage, and it deals good damage to lighter Water-types like Quaquaval and Azumarill. Alternatively, Spikes lets Greninja wear down checks like Toxapex while taking advantage of the switches it often forces. In addition, Greninja also beats common entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Corviknight, making Spikes easy to maintain. Tera Water further enhances Greninja's already powerful Hydro Pump to extreme levels, letting it OHKO Pokemon like Corviknight, Hatterene, and Unaware Clodsire. Meanwhile, Tera Dark lets Greninja 2HKO Toxapex and Rotom-W with Dark Pulse.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja fits best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams as a menacing wallbreaker.

Strong offensive Pokemon like Kingambit and mixed Iron Valiant make for excellent partners, as Greninja threatens their checks like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Garchomp for the former, and Skeledirge, Gholdengo, Clodsire, and Volcarona for the latter.

It differentiates itself from Meowscarada due to its better matchup against other leads as well as entry hazard setters and removers such as Glimmora, Iron Treads, Garchomp, Toxic Spikes Iron Moth, and Court Change Cinderace. Taunt has various applications; it blocks Amoonguss's Spore, prevents entry hazards from the likes of Ting-Lu and leads like Glimmora and Iron Treads, stops Defog from Corviknight, and prevents setup from Pokemon like Baxcalibur, Roaring Moon, Kingambit, and Tera Water Garganacl that attempt to exploit Greninja's relative passivity. Greninja can choose to run Toxic Spikes to punish offensive teams filled with setup sweepers like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and non-Heavy Duty-Boots Baxcalibur better, but Ice Beam OHKOes Garchomp and dents Water-resistant Pokemon like Dragonite, Meowscarada, Dragapult, Tera Grass Glimmora, and Water Absorb Clodsire, especially if its Focus Sash is still intact for the former three. Focus Sash guarantees that Greninja can set at least one layer of entry hazards and works extremely well to safely put it into Torrent range, which allows Surf to OHKO Hisuian Zoroark and provides significant odds to OHKO Iron Valiant, one of the biggest threats to offense teams. Alternatively, Protean improves Ice Beam's damage and allows Greninja to block Volt Switch from Rotom-W, Iron Treads, and Sandy Shocks when using Spikes, maintaining offensive momentum. Tera Water boosts Greninja's Surf, notably netting the OHKO on specially defensive Garganacl and 2HKO on Tera Fairy Skeledirge with Torrent, as well as the 2HKO on Gholdengo and Corviknight after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Greninja is perfectly suited for hyper offense teams. Offensive teammates like Volcarona, Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Baxcalibur put further pressure on entry hazard removers such as Corviknight, Iron Treads, and Great Tusk to maintain Greninja's Spikes throughout the game and enjoy Spikes chipping down their checks like Garganacl, Clodsire, Amoonguss, and Dondozo. They also appreciate Spikes invalidating Focus Sash from Pokemon like Hisuian Zoroark, Ceruledge, and Meowscarada. Aside from possessing insane late-game potential themselves, Kingambit and Iron Moth particularly help against Meowscarada—one of the few leads that can easily beat Greninja—and Hatterene, which can freely switch into Greninja and reflect its Taunt and entry hazards with Magic Bounce, with Calm Mind variants using it as setup fodder as well. Kingambit in particular appreciates Greninja's tendency to faint early-game to accumulate Supreme Overlord boosts. Knock Off from Bulk Up Great Tusk and Swords Dance Iron Valiant can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from walls like Dondozo, Slowking, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge, making them susceptible to Greninja's Spikes. Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragon Dance Dragapult can spinblock the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch to keep Greninja's Spikes up; Gholdengo in particular does it exceptionally well by blocking Defog and Glimmora's Mortal Spin as well, and it has the added benefit of threatening Hatterene and crippling walls like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu with Choice item + Trick, making them more vulnerable to Greninja's entry hazards.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With a valuable defensive profile and remarkable longevity, Toxapex cements itself as a very sturdy mixed wall and defensive pivot. It can switch into and counter Pokemon like Volcarona, Cinderace, and Greninja, scout for Choice item users like Dragapult, Breloom, and Iron Valiant, and absorb Toxic Spikes from Glimmora and opposing Toxapex. Surf forces damage onto Toxic-immune foes such as Gholdengo, Garganacl, Iron Moth, and Kingambit. Toxic shuts down Pokemon such as Dragonite, Volcarona, Baxcalibur, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W, and if Toxapex should run Toxic Spikes, it matches up well against offensive teams that contain setup sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Great Tusk. Any attempts of boosting past Toxapex gets shut down easily by Haze, which combined with poison damage prevents Toxapex from being used as setup fodder by Pokemon such as Substitute Baxcalibur and Calm Mind Hatterene. Covert Cloak is an option to ignore Garganacl's Salt Cure, Dragapult and Gholdengo's Shadow Ball drops, and Greninja's Dark Pulse flinches, but Leftovers's longevity reduces Toxapex's reliance on Recover, and it is used over Black Sludge in case Toxapex decides to Terastallize. Tera Steel improves Toxapex's matchup against non-Earthquake Roaring Moon and Meowscarada while still maintaining an immunity to poison. Alternatively, Tera Fairy fares better against Dragapult, Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Choice Band Roaring Moon. The given EVs allow Toxapex to survive two Choice Band Meowscarada's Flower Trick from full health.</p> <p>Toxapex fits nicely on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate a sturdy defensive backbone. Teammates like Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl are terrific defensive partners that covers Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Tera Electric Iron Valiant, respectively. Corviknight and Great Tusk in particular provide a backup check to multiple combinations of physical attackers like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Kingambit that attempt to overwhelm Toxapex. They also remove entry hazards, which would mitigate Toxapex's Regenerator and force it to use Recover more often; in return, Toxapex covers Pokemon such as Cinderace for the former and Greninja for the latter. Bulky setup sweepers like Garganacl, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo can take advantage of Toxic Spikes slowly chipping down checks such as Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. Particularly, Skeledirge and Gholdengo can make use of Hex easily to take advantage of Toxapex spreading poison, as well as threaten Hatterene, which can block Toxapex's Toxic Spikes and use non-Haze variants as setup fodder. Offensive partners like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit compensate for Toxapex's overall passivity; in return, they appreciate Toxapex switching into their revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo, Scizor, and Iron Valiant, respectively.</p> "

Surf does a solid chunk of damage to common Toxapex switch-ins like Kingambit, physically defensive Corviknight, and Gholdengo and often 2HKOes Garganacl after Stealth Rock. Sludge Bomb has good coverage alongside it, dealing heavy damage to Fairy-types like Iron Valiant, Hatterene, and Azumarill while breaking Hydreigon's Substitute. Sludge Bomb's high chance to poison can be critical for crippling Rotom-W and Slowking in the long term. Infestation provides a nice source of chip damage while letting Toxapex trap and beat defensive threats, such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, Skeledirge, Clodsire, and bulky Volcarona, in conjunction with Acid Spray. Furthermore, Infestation prevents the opponent from double switching on Toxapex, enabling much safer plays. Instead of Acid Spray, Ice Beam works to offer more immediate damage against Clodsire, Dragonite, Dragapult, and Amoonguss. Tera Blast, with Tera Fighting, is also viable to nab surprise KOs on Kingambit and Roaring Moon, which might otherwise set up on it. However, Fairy is the most standard Tera type for Toxapex, allowing it to block Dragon-type attacks from Dragapult and Walking Wake.</p> <p>Toxapex fits best on balance and bulky teams that appreciate its unique combination of bulk and power. Assault Vest Toxapex likes to pivot around aggressively and spread chip damage, thanks in part to Regenerator: entry hazard setters like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu can help it pressure opposing teams more, punishing opponents for switching out against it. Without either Haze or Toxic, Toxapex is vulnerable to setup sweepers such as Baxcalibur, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon, so Unaware Pokemon such as Dondozo and Skeledirge are excellent teammates. Since Assault Vest Toxapex's physical bulk is rather lacking, physically defensive Pokemon like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Corviknight can offer much-needed switch-ins to the likes of Kingambit and Choice Band Roaring Moon. Toxapex can often struggle to make progress against bulkier teams due to its middling power and lack of Toxic, so it appreciates strong balance wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Baxcalibur. Hydreigon deserves special mention as an excellent teammate, sharing near-perfect type synergy with Toxapex. Hydreigon checks key threats to Toxapex such as Armarouge, Kingambit, Baxcalibur, and Nasty Plot Gholdengo, and it can set up on bulkier Pokemon like defensive Great Tusk and Clodsire. In return, Toxapex can check Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Greninja, which can threaten Hydreigon. Finally, Scream Tail is also a great partner, using Wish to extend Toxapex's longevity and having solid defensive synergy with it.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Cinderace is a good offensive pivot thanks to its high Speed, decent Attack, and wide coverage that gains a STAB boost thanks to Libero each time it enters the field. Pyro Ball is its most reliable move, as it can hit hard while preserving Libero. Sucker Punch gives Cinderace a means to hit faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Dragapult super effectively. Alternatively, Gunk Shot can be run to OHKO Iron Valiant and Hatterene while preserving the team's ability to Terastallize. Court Change is an extremely useful move, as it can provide hazard control that is unaffected by Gholdengo's Good as Gold while also stealing Light Screen and Reflect from hyper offensive teams; however, Cinderace can choose to run High Jump Kick instead to hit Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Ting-Lu harder as well as inflicting more damage against Pokemon that resist Pyro Ball like Garchomp and Garganacl. Tera Fire is the Tera type that Cinderace wants to utilize in order to maximize Pyro Ball's damage, giving it the ability to OHKO Volcarona, and, with an Adamant nature, Corviknight after Stealth Rock. It also helps Cinderace hit bulkier targets like Hatterene and offensive Great Tusk, especially if it isn't running Gunk Shot or High Jump Kick. A Jolly nature is preferred to augment Cinderace's role as a fast pivot, allowing it to outspeed Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Iron Treads. However, an Adamant nature can be run instead to increase its damage output.</p> <p>Cinderace works best on balance and bulky offense teams, providing utility and entry hazard control while simultaneously exerting offensive pressure. Defensive Water-type Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Dondozo can all sponge Water-type attacks while taking neutral damage from Rock- and Ground-type moves, with the exception of Toxapex. In turn, Cinderace can match up well against wallbreakers such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant and Meowscarada, which can all cause difficulties for the aforementioned Water-types. Ground-types that provide entry hazard support such as Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu make it easier for Cinderace to check threats with Stealth Rock and Spikes, especially if it is running an Adamant nature. Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Iron Valiant pair well with Cinderace, as they can eradicate foes that wall it such as Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Rotom-W. Similarly, Dragonite and Kingambit can check Pokemon such as Hatterene and Skeledirge, which can both cause issues for Cinderace. In return, Cinderace can provide hazard control for all of these partners and help them come in the field more safely without having to worry about chip damage from entry hazards.</p> "

        "name": "Bulky Pivot",
        "description": "<p>Cinderace functions as an excellent bulky pivot thanks to its great Speed tier, serviceable bulk, and access to support moves such as Court Change and Will-O-Wisp. Cinderace can force out important offensive threats like Gholdengo, Iron Valiant, and bulky Volcarona with the threat of STAB Pyro Ball while keeping up momentum against defensive switch-ins with U-turn. Will-O-Wisp allows Cinderace to cripple physical attackers such as Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Great Tusk, and it can also negate Leftovers for defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu. Specifically, Will-O-Wisp offers a safe way for Cinderace to check Kingambit, since it avoids Sucker Punch mindgames. Finally, Court Change offers unmatched utility in providing entry hazard control that cannot be blocked by Gholdengo and is also able to steal opposing dual screens. The 32 Attack EVs guarantee a KO on Gholdengo sets lacking defensive investment and 2HKO on physically defensive Corviknight after Leftovers. Although this set rarely wants to Terastallize, Tera Fire can potentially come in handy for securing KOs with Pyro Ball, especially with a Blaze boost. Alternatively, Tera Flying grants Cinderace an immunity to Ground-type attacks, such as Great Tusk's Earthquake, which can grant it extra opportunities to KO foes or cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. Tera Flying also matches up well against common Ground-type hazard setters such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, letting Cinderace safely Court Change against them.</p> <p>Cinderace works best on bulkier teams where its ability to guarantee hazard removal shines. Defensive Pokemon such as Dondozo, Slowking, Toxapex, and Amoonguss are great teammates, as they appreciate Cinderace's ability to ensure hazard removal, freeing them up to run items other than Heavy-Duty Boots. Water-types such as Dondozo and Toxapex have notably strong synergy with Cinderace; Dondozo checks Great Tusk, Tera Fire Kingambit, and Baxcalibur, while Toxapex can check Water-types, such as Walking Wake and Greninja. Hazard-weak breakers such as Baxcalibur, Iron Moth, and Choice Band Dragonite also fit well with Cinderace, as it's able to bring them in with U-turn. These breakers also enjoy bulky Water-types like Toxapex or Dondozo being burnt, making it easier to overwhelm them long-term. Cinderace usually requires the presence of another hazard control Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Hatterene, or Corviknight so it doesn't get overwhelmed. Corviknight synergizes especially well with Cinderace thanks to its Ground immunity and ability to absorb Knock Off from Meowscarada, which outspeeds Cinderace. Skeledirge and Dragapult can take advantage of bulky Cinderace, since both completely wall it and can potentially set up a Substitute. Kingambit is a great partner, as it can offensively check both Skeledirge and Dragapult. In return, it appreciates Cinderace burning Great Tusk and Ting-Lu, opening up the way for it to sweep.</p> "

Body Press is Corviknight's best option against Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Baxcalibur. Leftovers is the preferred item to provide extra longevity, but Rocky Helmet can further punish physical attackers, especially on weak hits like Scizor's and Meowscarada's U-turn. Tera Water serves as an emergency check to dangerous Fire- and Water-types such as Cinderace and Floatzel. Alternatively, Tera Fighting grants it a resistance to Dark-type attacks and powers up its Body Press, letting it check Kingambit more easily.</p> <p>Corviknight is a fantastic slow pivot, making it a great partner for frail-but-powerful teammates like Greninja and Iron Valiant. It is also one of the few viable Defoggers, allowing it to partner up with teammates like Dragonite and Baxcalibur, that loathe Stealth Rock. Be warned, Corviknight is utterly unable to Defog against Gholdengo, so secondary entry hazard removal like Great Tusk and a reliable switch-in like Ting-Lu are recommended. Corviknight is unable to handle powerful physical Fire-types like Cinderace and Ceruledge and Electric-types like Iron Hands. Teammates that can cover these weaknesses like Dondozo and Great Tusk are wonderful partners. Its middling special bulk makes teammates like Slowking and Ting-Lu valuable.

Its Ghost typing also blocks common priority attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Breloom's Mach Punch, which allows it to sweep even when Psychic Terrain is not active. Though it is resisted by Steel-types, a Psychic Terrain-boosted Stored Power can still heavily damage even Corviknight, 2HKOing physically defensive variants after just one Shell Smash. Shadow Ball is a consistent STAB move with excellent neutral coverage to hit most Steel- and Psychic-types hard, OHKOing Gholdengo and Hatterene. Tera Blast with Tera Fighting fills a gap in Polteageist's coverage, eliminating Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Kingambit while Psychic Terrain is active, and Hydreigon. Tera Fighting can also let it survive their Dark-type attacks. Weak Armor alongside a Focus Sash allows Polteageist to punish a stray physical attack, further boosting its Speed—it can outspeed +1 foes like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth—and Stored Power's damage. Focus Sash also lets Polteageist set up against threats that would otherwise outpace it or survive an attack and OHKO it, such as Kingambit, Choice Specs Dragapult, and offensive Great Tusk. A Timid nature is run to outpace +1 Walking Wake after a single Shell Smash.</p> <p>Polteageist is a staple on Psychic Terrain offense teams. Indeedee's Psychic Terrain protects Polteageist against priority attacks from Kingambit, Baxcalibur, Azumarill, and Floatzel while powering up its Stored Power, though Polteageist requires both a Shell Smash and a Weak Armor boost to outpace Swift Swim Floatzel. Indeedee can also let Polteageist set up with Encore or give it a second chance to sweep with Healing Wish, although if Polteageist has already consumed its Focus Sash, it will struggle to set up as reliably a second time. Armarouge is an excellent teammate and another staple on Psychic Terrain teams, as it can eliminate Steel-types like Kingambit with Armor Cannon to enable Polteageist's late-game sweep and it can use Endure to activate Weak Armor multiple times against Dragon Darts Dragapult, which Polteageist cannot reliably set up against. In return, Polteageist can greatly weaken or outright eliminate Unaware walls, set up against specially offensive Dragapult if its Focus Sash is intact, and can safely utilize Tera Fighting to eliminate Roaring Moon and wear down Ting-Lu, which allows Armarouge to sweep. Entry hazard removal is extremely important to maintain Focus Sash's protection. Eject Pack Great Tusk provides both Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock support, can safely get Polteageist in after using a strong Headlong Rush or Close Combat, and can also switch into and threaten Dark-types for Polteageist. Magic Bounce Hatterene deters entry hazards, spreads paralysis with Nuzzle, and can provide Healing Wish support. Also, Eject Button lets it safely pivot Polteageist in, even against U-Turns from Corviknight, Cinderace, or Meowscarada, giving it much easier setup opportunities. Setup sweepers like Tera Psychic Volcarona, Dragon Dance Dragapult, and Dragon Dance Baxcalibur appreciate Polteageist breaking past Unaware walls with Stored Power. Volcarona further enjoys it wearing down or eliminating Clodsire and Assault Vest Toxapex, and Dragapult and Baxcalibur love it wearing down Steel-types. In return, Volcarona can outright eliminate Steel-types like Corviknight while Dragapult and Baxcalibur can use their multi-hit attacks to threaten opposing Psychic Terrain teams.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Hatterene is an excellent option on balance teams to deny entry hazards from being set up. With Magic Bounce, it can switch into and reflect entry hazards from Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Blissey. From there, it can begin setting up Calm Mind to pose a greater threat itself and overwhelm the opponent's defensive answers to it. Draining Kiss acts as pseudo-recovery and can help Hatterene heal off damage it's taken from Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk. Psyshock allows Hatterene to deal high damage to special walls such as Blissey and Clodsire and win potential setup wars against other Hatterene and Volcarona. Stored Power fulfills a similar role to Psyshock in enabling Hatterene to break through special walls and other Calm Mind users and can also help Hatterene defeat various Unaware Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Dondozo, but it requires Hatterene to set up multiple Calm Minds before it becomes truly potent. Mystical Fire deals high damage to many of Hatterene's common switch-ins such as Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Kingambit and has the nice bonus of lowering the target's Special Attack, which is particularly useful against Gholdengo that aren't running Covert Cloak. Nuzzle is another option to cripple switch-ins with paralysis, which can act as useful speed control for Hatterene's teammates. Substitute is another alternative that allows Hatterene to more easily set up in the face of weak hits such as Garganacl's Salt Cure and Clodsire's Earthquake. Tera Water nullifies all of Hatterene's weaknesses, which can grant it more opportunities to use Calm Mind against its checks such as Gholdengo, while Tera Fire can similarly neutralize all of Hatterene's weaknesses and comes with additional benefits such as boosting the damage of its Mystical Fire and letting it check Iron Valiant and Volcarona better. However, Tera Fire also comes with notable downsides, namely giving Hatterene a weakness to Ground-type moves and Stealth Rock, which can hinder its matchups against common entry hazard setters. The EV spread allows Hatterene to move reliably switch into physical attacks from common entry hazard setters while also outspeeding Toxapex and Garganacl.</p> <p>Hatterene's ability to discourage the use of entry hazards will be appreciated by almost any team. Pokemon vulnerable to entry hazards and those that frequently pivot in and out of battle such as Meowscarada, Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Dragapult enjoy Hatterene's support. Entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Corviknight are also good partners, as Hatterene's presence can ease the burden placed on them to remove entry hazards and grants the team greater flexibility in dealing with entry hazard setters. Furthermore, while Hatterene can switch into entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, it can be worn down quickly from their repeated Ground-type attacks. Great Tusk and Corviknight can reduce Hatterene's need to switch in as often by acting as alternative switch-ins. Due to relying on Leftovers and Draining Kiss for recovery, Hatterene can struggle to stay healthy, particularly if it loses its Leftovers to Knock Off or is hit by Salt Cure, so it is recommended to have teammates that can switch into these moves. Corviknight can switch into Knock Off from hazard setters such as Meowscarada and Great Tusk, while Covert Cloak Gholdengo can neutralize Salt Cure. Pokemon holding Rocky Helmet such as Corviknight can be troublesome for Hatterene, as they will wear Hatterene down when it uses Nuzzle or Draining Kiss. Covert Cloak users, especially Gholdengo, are similarly irritating for Hatterene due to nullifying the secondary effect of its Nuzzle or Mystical Fire. Knock Off support from Meowscarada, Great Tusk, and Iron Valiant is thus appreciated to remove these items from the opponent's Pokemon. Hatterene's weakness to Steel- and Ghost-type attacks can be exploited by strong attackers such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Kingambit. Kingambit and Tera Water Garganacl can reliably switch into Gholdengo and Dragapult, while Great Tusk and Dondozo can counter Kingambit.</p> "

Psychic and Dazzling Gleam are STAB moves that let Hatterene remain threatening against hazard setters such as Toxapex, Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Garchomp. Nuzzle punishes setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Dragonite that would otherwise set up in front of Hatterene. Alternatively, Mystical Fire lets Hatterene punish Steel-types such as Kingambit and Gholdengo that try to switch into it. Eject Button lets Hatterene sponge hits for its teammates and brings an offensive Pokemon safely onto the field. The Speed EVs allow Hatterene to outspeed Ting-Lu and paralyzed Adamant Dragonite, while the rest of its EVs are dedicated to its bulk. Tera Steel removes all of Hatterene's weaknesses which can, in turn, allow it to use Healing Wish in front of Pokemon that would otherwise directly threaten it such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Glimmora.</p> <p>Healing Wish Hatterene finds a place on hyper offense, sun, and Psychic Terrain teams, which all enjoy Hatterene's ability to stop entry hazards from going up and breaking Focus Sash and severely chipping Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock while also keeping momentum thanks to Eject Button. As such, Pokemon usually seen on these archetypes like Dragonite, Ceruledge, Iron Moth, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake, as well as Focus Sash users such as Breloom, Armarouge, and Polteageist, enjoy the presence of Hatterene. Offensive pivots such as Roaring Moon and Cinderace invite in defensive walls like Dondozo and Toxapex, against which Hatterene can use Healing Wish safely. Great Tusk can act as a secondary entry hazard control alongside Hatterene, preventing the latter from getting overwhelmed by repeating hits from entry hazards users like Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and opposing Great Tusk. Said support is particularly useful on sun teams as keeping Stealth Rock off the field allows for Torkoal to remain healthy and thus set up sun repeated timed throughout the game.</p> "

Additionally, Healing Wish provides a teammate a free switch-in, maximizing the number of turns in which they can take advantage of Psychic Terrain. Tera Fairy boosts the power of Dazzling Gleam, allowing Indeedee-M to OHKO Roaring Moon, Greninja, Meowscarada, and Dragapult after Stealth Rock damage. Tera Fairy also allows Indeedee-M to use Healing Wish in front of Pokemon where it wouldn't usually be able to do so, such as Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, and Bug Buzz Volcarona, though it is almost always better to Terastallize a teammate instead, as Indeedee-M's immunity to Ghost-type attacks eases the matchup against Pokemon that are otherwise very threatening to Psychic Terrain teams, such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult.</p> <p>Indeedee-M is mandatory on Psychic Terrain teams. As such, teammates that effectively utilize the power boost to Psychic-type moves and enjoy the immunity to priority Psychic Terrain provides are good partners. Therefore, teammates such as Armarouge, Polteageist, and Volcarona are good partners that appreciate the power boost to Expanding Force, Stored Power, and Psychic, respectively. In particular, the Psychic Terrain boost allows +1 Tera Psychic Volcarona to OHKO Assault Vest Toxapex after Stealth Rock damage, demonstrating the potency wallbreakers have when Psychic Terrain is up. Additionally, teammates that provide entry hazard control are also good partners, as they allow Indeedee-M to set Psychic Terrain repeatedly throughout the game and keep the team's wallbreakers healthy. Therefore, Eject Pack Great Tusk and Eject Button Hatterene are good partners, as they do this while conserving momentum, providing opportunities for the team's wallbreakers.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Possessing OU's highest unboosted Speed tier makes Choice Specs Dragapult a very remarkable special wallbreaker, revenge killer, and offensive pivot. It outspeeds and threatens common offensive threats like Cinderace, Iron Moth, and even boosted foes like Adamant Dragonite after a Dragon Dance. Moreover, it's immune or resistant to common priority attacks like the aforementioned Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Breloom's Mach Punch, and Slither Wing's First Impression, which makes it much harder to revenge kill. It is also able to switch into and check Rotom-W. A coverage move in either Flamethrower or Thunder lets Dragapult nail Corviknight, with the former also hitting other Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads, while the latter pressures Toxapex and Tera Water Garganacl. A Timid nature allows Dragapult to outspeed Adamant Dragonite after a Dragon Dance and Speed ties opposing Dragapult, while a Modest nature can be used for extra wallbreaking power. Infiltrator allows Dragapult to bypass Grimmsnarl's dual screens and Substitute users like Gholdengo, which gives it an edge against hyper offense teams. Tera Ghost maintains an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and strengthens Shadow Ball—its most spammable attack—notably guaranteeing the 2HKO on Corviknight and Assault Vest Iron Treads after Terastallizing. Tera Fairy prevents Dragapult from being picked off by opposing Dragapult and Sucker Punch from Kingambit and Meowscarada. Finally, Tera Dragon turns Draco Meteor into an even more powerful nuke. This takes advantage of the lack of prominent bulky Steel- and Fairy-types in the metagame, notably chunking answers to Ghost-types like Purifying Salt Garganacl and Ting-Lu and 2HKOing Unaware Clodsire.</p> <p>Choice Specs Dragapult fits perfectly on bulky offense and VoltTurn teams. Physical wallbreakers like Great Tusk appreciate Dragapult's U-turn bringing them in safely, and they are able to pressure its switch-ins like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, Blissey, and Garganacl. Entry hazard removers like Corviknight and Great Tusk allow Dragapult to pivot throughout the game unperturbed; the former can also pivot it in safely via U-turn, letting it threaten Gholdengo, which tends to switch into Corviknight to block its Defog. Furthermore, Corviknight and Great Tusk provide the necessary defensive backbone to switch into boosted threats such as Roaring Moon, as well as revenge kill attempts from Sucker Punch users like Kingambit. Gholdengo forms a Ghost spam core with Dragapult, as it can overwhelm a shared check in Ting-Lu, use non-Calm Mind Blissey as setup fodder, and either cripple Tera Water Garganacl with Trick or straight up dent Tera Fairy variants. Entry hazards from Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Garganacl can quickly put foes into Dragapult's KO range, especially as it tends to force a lot of switches; in return, Dragapult spinblocks foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch. Setup sweepers like Volcarona and Iron Valiant appreciate Dragapult wallbreaking early-game for them to clean up late-game easily.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Dragapult utilizes its near-unresisted STAB moves, its blistering Speed stat, and its excellent Attack stat to function as a strong physical wallbreaker. The choice for the second move depends on what Tera type Dragapult chooses. Tera Dragon Dragapult uses Phantom Force for a Ghost-type STAB move, but Tera Ghost uses Tera Blast, since, unlike Phantom Force, it is not a two-turn move. Sucker Punch allows Dragapult to revenge kill weakened sweepers such as opposing Dragapult, as well as Iron Moth and Tera Flying Roaring Moon after some chip damage. However, be careful when using Sucker Punch, since opponents can predict it and set up. An Adamant nature gives Dragapult extra wallbreaking power. Alternatively, a Jolly nature allows Dragapult to outspeed the entirety of the unboosted metagame. With Tera Dragon, Dragapult's Dragon Darts becomes harder to switch into; it 2HKOes walls Dragapult normally struggles with such as Ting-Lu. Tera Dragon Dragapult is also less susceptible to Sucker Punch, albeit at the cost of losing its immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Iron Valiant is a fantastic partner, since it's able to check Dark-types such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu. Hazard removal from Pokemon like Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for good partners, since Dragapult's lack of longevity makes it difficult to switch in when hazards are up. Great Tusk and Corviknight are able to beat both Scizor and opposing Great Tusk, while Cinderace can threaten bulky Steel-types such as Corviknight. Dragapult benefits from entry hazards from the likes of Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl, since it can more effectively wallbreak with entry hazards up. Other pivots such as Scizor and Rotom-W appreciate that Dragapult's U-turn can bring them in. In return, Scizor can revenge kill Ice-types such as Naxcalibur, while Rotom-W can check both Corviknight and defensive Great Tusk. Paralysis support from Rotom-W can shutdown offensive Pokemon like opposing Dragapult and Roaring Moon. Lastly, Gholdengo makes for a good teammate, since it can spinblock and deny Defog and can help Dragapult overwhelm shared checks like Kingambit and Ting-Lu.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<p>Unlike its more offensively oriented Choice item sets, this Dragapult set goes for a more multifunctional approach. Dragapult's unmatched Speed tier, in conjunction with STAB Dragon Darts, allows it to snipe key offensive threats such as Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Cinderace with some prior chip damage. This often means that Dragapult will force a lot of switches, which can be capitalized on with Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave to spread status and power up Hex. Both status moves also allow Dragapult to avoid Sucker Punch, which can come in handy against Cinderace, Kingambit, and Meowscarada. With a burn and Stealth Rock up, Hex 2HKOes defensive Corviknight, Amoonguss, and Dondozo, allowing Dragapult to pick apart balanced cores. However, paralyzing its foes allow Dragapult to fish for more free turns to set up Substitute. Substitute improves Dragapult's matchup against Sucker Punch users and avoids status and Salt Cure damage. 76 Attack EVs ensure an OHKO on Roaring Moon with Dragon Darts. Tera Fairy grants it a Dark resistance and Dragon immunity against Pokemon like Kingambit, Walking Wake, and opposing Dragapult, the latter of which could otherwise risk the Speed tie and bypass its Substitute due to Infiltrator. In a pinch however, Terastallization can also be used defensively to avoid other super effective hits, like Baxcalibur's Ice Shard and Iron Valiant's Moonblast.</p> <p>Because of the amount of utility it provides, Dragapult appreciates plentiful chip damage from its teammates, as it lacks immediate power. All forms of entry hazards are greatly appreciated due to Dragapult's ability to force out the opponent, so entry hazard setters like Garganacl, Great Tusk, Glimmora and Ting-Lu form good teammates. Stealth Rock is particularly important since it secures important 2HKOs with Hex. Among the entry hazard setters, Garganacl has fantastic synergy with Dragapult, as it is able to set up Stealth Rock while also chipping down foes with Salt Cure. Partners that can spread status such as Rotom-W and Skeledirge are also excellent teammates. Since Ting-Lu and Garganacl stonewall this set, teammates that scare them out such as Offensive Great Tusk and Banded Meowscarada are great partners. Tera Flying Covert Cloak Gholdengo forms a particularly potent Ghost spam core with Dragapult, as it can turn common counters to Dragapult such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Garganacl into setup fodder. Physical sweepers like Kingambit appreciate having their counters like Corviknight and Great Tusk crippled with burns and have solid type synergy with Dragapult. Due to this set being most potent mid- and late-game, it's more at home in teams with solid defensive backbones that can sponge hits. Defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Hatterene, Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Amoonguss can all soak damage for Dragapult from common checks like Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Kingambit while setting up entry hazards, spreading status, or dealing chip damage, allowing Dragapult to clean up late-game.</p> "

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>Dragapult makes for an excellent sweeper thanks to its neutral coverage with STAB moves, very high Speed stat, and very good Attack stat. Besides hitting most Pokemon in the tier neutrally, Dragon Darts can also break past Focus Sash holders like Ceruledge and Breloom, as well as Dragonite's Multiscale. Pairing it with Phantom Force, or Ghost- or Fairy-type Tera Blast, gives nearly perfect neutral coverage. Substitute stops Sucker Punch from revenge killing Dragapult, blocks status from Pokemon like Rotom-W, and blocks Salt Cure residual damage. Since Dragapult forces many switches, it can find many opportunities to use Substitute and then use Dragon Dance once. With Tera Dragon, its Dragon Darts becomes even harder to switch to, 2HKOing walls like Ting-Lu, Toxapex, Garganacl, and Amoonguss after one Dragon Dance. Tera Ghost grants Dragapult a more reliable Ghost-type STAB move in Ghost-type Tera Blast; unlike Phantom Force, cores like Hatterrne + Roaring Moon can't play around it. Also, Tera Blast does not make contact, improving Dragapult's matchup against Rocky Helmet users such as Corviknight. However, Phantom Force lets Dragapult gain extra longevity from Leftovers. Tera Fairy grants Dragapult an immunity to Dragon, improving its matchups against opposing Dragon-types such as Roaring Moon, Walking Wake, and opposing Dragapult, and it also changes Dragapult's Dark weakness into a resistance, so it no longer fears Sucker Punch. An Adamant nature is standard, but a Jolly nature allows Dragapult to Speed tie opposing positive-nature Dragapult and outspeed +1 Adamant Dragonite.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Dragapult best fits on offense teams, where other offensive Pokemon can help it sweep more easily late-game. Also, they enjoy Dragapult forcing switches due to its Speed. Fighting-types such as Iron Valiant and Breloom can punch holes early- and mid-game for Dragapult to sweep, as well as checking Dark-types like Kingambit and Ting-Lu, which can cause Dragapult trouble. Iron Valiant also appreciates Dragapult checking Psychic-types that can give it trouble such as Hatterene. Ting-Lu and Great Tusk can set entry hazards for Dragapult and check opposing Dark-types. Dragapult dislikes Unaware Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Dondozo, since they can ignore its Dragon Dance boosts and force it out. Hence, wallbreakers that can check them such as Gholdengo are welcome. Lastly, Dragapult tends to struggle against Pokemon that contest its Dragon Dance with a Defense-boosting move, such as Bulk Up Corviknight, Bulk Up Great Tusk, and Curse Garganacl. Therefore, Pokemon like Ceruledge and Skeledirge to cover Corviknight, Rotom-W to cover Great Tusk, and Covert Cloak Gholdengo to cover Garganacl make for good partners. In return, Dragapult can set up on and check Pokemon they can struggle with, such as Roaring Moon and Walking Wake.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Band Zamazenta is a potent wallbreaker in the metagame due to its high Attack and Speed stats, as well as its range of coverage options that allows it to bypass would-be checks. Zamazenta's potency as a wallbreaker is further amplified by its bulk, which allows it to either trade with revenge killers such as Choice Specs Dragapult and Booster Energy Iron Valiant from full, if needed, or soft check opposing Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, and Baxcalibur, especially when Dauntless Shield is active, subsequently granting it multiple wallbreaking opportunities. Zamazenta's Crunch allows it to hit and at least 2HKO checks such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Galarian Slowking. With Heavy Slam, Zamazenta OHKOes Enamorus and Iron Valiant and 2HKOes Tera Fairy Toxapex. Stone Edge affords Zamazenta the ability to 2HKO Zapdos, notably avoiding Static in doing so, while also 2HKOing Skeledirge; alternatively, Wild Charge can be used to 2HKO Toxapex. Tera Fighting boosts the power of Close Combat and accentuates Zamazenta's wallbreaking power, notably allowing it to blow past some bulkier Zapdos variants without requiring prediction in addition to 2HKOing Dondozo most of the time.</p> <p>Zamazenta is well-suited as a wallbreaker on bulky offense teams. Consequently, Galarian Slowking is a very good teammate, as it provides Future Sight support, which heavily pressures otherwise solid checks such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, and Dondozo, allowing Zamazenta to break past its checks more easily. Additionally, Galarian Slowking provides a means of dealing with common counterplay to Zamazenta such as Zapdos, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant, as well as supplying Zamazenta with opportunities to come in through Chilly Reception. Other pivots such as Landorus-T and Zapdos are good partners too, as through their respective pivot moves, they also provide Zamazenta chances to safely come in and weaken the opposing team. Zamazenta is often worn down by hazards, as well as having to check threats such as Baxcalibur and Kingambit early on; solid checks to these which provide a means of hazard removal, like Corviknight and Great Tusk, respectively, are good partners. Kingambit is a strong teammate, as it appreciates the wallbreaking Zamazenta does earlier on to facilitate Kingambit's ability to clean late-game. Kingambit also appreciates the speed control Zamazenta provides, aiding Kingambit in revenge killing its offensive checks such as non-Choice Scarf Enamorus, non-Booster Energy Iron Valiant, and offensive Great Tusk. In return, Kingambit checks foes that take advantage of Zamazenta being locked into Close Combat, such as Gholdengo and Dragapult. Likewise, other cleaners such as Choice Scarf Enamorus and Booster Energy Iron Valiant also appreciate Zamazenta's weakening of the opposing team. In particular, Choice Scarf Enamorus provides Healing Wish support, affording Zamazenta a second chance at wearing down the opponent's team.</p> "

After Flame Orb activates, Facade 2HKOes even Pokemon as physically bulky as Dondozo and OHKOes physically defensive Great Tusk after a Swords Dance while letting Ursaluna act as a status absorber. Headlong Rush is generally preferred for its higher power, but Earthquake is another good option that avoids Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet damage and lets Ursaluna leverage its good bulk. Fire Punch hits Corviknight, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Air Balloon Kingambit, which resist Ursaluna's STAB combination. Tera Normal boosts Facade to breathtaking levels, allowing it to cleanly 2HKO physically defensive Corviknight after Stealth Rock. Tera Ghost is an alternative that lets Ursaluna avoid being revenge killed by Fighting-type attacks such as Close Combat from Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, or Sneasler. The given EV spread maximizes Ursaluna's damage output while also ensuring it outspeeds Skeledirge and standard Corviknight. On Trick Room teams, Ursaluna should run maximum Attack and HP investment, a Brave nature, and 0 Speed IVs.</p> <p>Ursaluna serves as an exceptionally powerful wallbreaker on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Garchomp is appreciated to make Ursaluna even more difficult to wall. Dual screens support from Dragapult can also be considered, since it will further reinforce Ursaluna's excellent bulk, and Dragapult can even provide free switches through Curse or U-turn. Against slower-paced teams, Ursaluna's great bulk and immunity to status give it many opportunities to switch in and start wreaking havoc, but it can struggle against faster-paced, more aggressive teams. Good partners for Ursaluna that excel against offense include Kingambit, Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Zamazenta, which, in return, appreciate Ursaluna breaking through Pokemon such as Dondozo and Corviknight. Ursaluna enjoys U-turn or Volt Switch support from Rotom-W, Landorus-T, or Dragapult, letting it hit the field multiple times to fire off its insanely powerful attacks. Galarian Slowking is another great teammate for Ursaluna, as it can both provide momentum with Chilly Reception and supplement Ursaluna's firepower with Future Sight. Galarian Slowking can also switch into and pressure some of the Pokemon that give Ursaluna trouble, such as Iron Valiant. Trick Room support from Hatterene and Cresselia is an interesting option to turn Ursaluna's low Speed into an advantage.</p> "

Dire Claw can ease setup or secure a sweep by inflicting checks such as Landorus-T, Skeledirge, and Toxapex with sleep or paralysis in a pinch. On the other hand, Gunk Shot is far more powerful, OHKOing Zapdos and Amoonguss after Swords Dance while avoiding the former's Static. Tera Blast Ground allows Sneasler to hit Skeledirge and OHKO Toxapex, defensive Gholdengo, and Galarian Slowking after Swords Dance. Acrobatics, alongside Tera Flying, allows Sneasler to OHKO Great Tusk after Swords Dance and gives it setup opportunities against other Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Iron Treads. Shadow Claw and Night Slash both retain huge damage on Gholdengo in particular and make Sneasler less reliant on Terastallizing to hit it. The choice between the two largely comes down to Tera type; Tera Ghost grants Sneasler an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Great Tusk's Rapid Spin, while Tera Dark makes it immune to Future Sight and retains its Sucker Punch resistance after Terastallizing. Tera Dark Night Slash is also Sneasler's best chance at breaking through Tera Ghost Garganacl. An Air Balloon lets Sneasler set up freely against Ground-types such as defensive Great Tusk and Ting-Lu lacking Whirlwind. White Herb is an alternative that allows Sneasler to activate Unburden itself by using Close Combat instead of being reliant on taking a hit and popping Air Balloon to sweep.</p> <p>Sneasler is at home on hyper offense teams that can wear down opposing defensive cores for it to sweep late-game. Grimmsnarl and Dragapult are excellent teammates for their ability to set dual screens, which ease Sneasler's setup tremendously, especially if it is running Air Balloon and needs to take a hit in order to sweep. Glimmora and Hisuian Samurott are excellent leads that can provide valuable entry hazard support; Hisuian Samurott in particular can threaten many of Sneasler's checks, such as Great Tusk, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo. Other setup sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Baxcalibur, Kingambit, and Cresselia are good partners that can break through defensive cores for Sneasler or end games if it falls short of a sweep. Zamazenta is particularly valuable in this role, as it benefits immensely from Sneasler's ability to lure and break through shared checks such as Toxapex, Gholdengo, and Zapdos.</p> "

Earth Power lets Enamorus threaten Pokemon that resist Moonblast such as Galarian Slowking, Cinderace, Toxapex, Iron Moth, Heatran, and Clodsire. Enamorus can complement its coverage with Mystical Fire, which allows it to hit Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo. Substitute is another option that lets Enamorus take advantage of the switches it forces and thus find more room to set up. Substitute also protects it from status conditions such as Amoonguss's Spore and Toxapex and Clodsire's Toxic. Agility is another alternative that lets Enamorus outspeed and thus threaten fast offensive Pokemon that would otherwise try to revenge kill it such as Cinderace, Zamazenta, and Dragapult. Timid is the preferred nature, as it lets Enamorus outspeed the likes of Zapdos, Sandy Shocks, and Garchomp, while Modest is usually seen alongside Agility. Heavy-Duty Boots removes Enamorus's weakness to Stealth Rock, letting it come into the field safely throughout the game. Leftovers grants Enamorus recovery and is usually used with Substitute to slowly heal and potentially set up more Substitutes. Life Orb is a more offensive option that increases Enamorus's damage output, letting it secure OHKOs against Choice Band Hoopa-U and even neutral targets such as Zapdos after one Calm Mind. Cute Charm is used over Contrary, as the latter conflicts with Calm Mind, and the former can potentially infatuate opposing male Pokemon, granting Enamorus free turns to set up. Tera Fairy makes Enamorus's Moonblast nearly unwallable, as even resistances such as Corviknight are potentially 2HKOed after one Calm Mind. Tera Ground, on the other hand, boosts Enamorus's Earth Power and turns its weakness to Poison into a resistance, which lets it deny revenge killing attempts from Sneasler and Iron Moth and turns soft checks such as Galarian Slowking into setup fodder. Tera Steel is yet another alternative that improves Enamorus's matchup against Poison-types, particularly Amoonguss, and lets it deny revenge killing attempts from Baxcalibur's Ice Shard and Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Enamorus fits better on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Entry hazard setters that fit on these playstyles, such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Glimmora, and Hisuian Samurott, can slowly chip at the opposing team, making it easier for Enamorus to clean up late-game. Enamorus, in turn, denies opportunities for opposing Great Tusk to come in and remove the hazards away with Rapid Spin thanks to its higher Speed and resistance to both of Great Tusk's STAB moves. Its good matchup against Great Tusk, as well as Zamazenta and Dondozo, makes Enamorus a great Kingambit teammate, as it can cover Kingambit's would-be checks. Kingambit, in return, can help against Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking, which can be troublesome for Enamorus. Choice Specs Dragapult can weaken soft checks that can shrug off one of its or Enamorus's hits, such as Rotom-W, Zapdos, Ursaluna, and Azumarill, and appreciates Enamorus's ability to switch into Dark-type attacks from Hisuian Samurott and Hoopa-U and threaten them back.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Meowscarada is the fastest Spiker in the metagame that also provides further utility, making it a very potent dedicated lead. Moreover, its immunity to Prankster Taunt from Grimmsnarl, another common lead, lets Meowscarada get the leg up against opposing offensive teams. Taunt in conjunction with its insane Speed tier allows Meowscarada to shut down opposing entry hazard setters and removers like Garchomp, Glimmora, Iron Moth, and Corviknight, annoy defensive Pokemon like Clodsire and Toxapex, and prevent foes such as Volcarona, Kingambit, and Dragonite from using it as setup fodder. Aside from threatening Grass-resistant Pokemon like Dragapult, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo, Knock Off's utility allows Meowscarada to soften up and cripple defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and Toxapex, and it works well with Spikes by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Amoonguss, Clodsire, and Scizor. Even with Meowscarada's middling Special Attack, Leaf Storm boosted by Overgrow can cleanly OHKO defensive Great Tusk, one of the metagame's most common entry hazard removers. Focus Sash guarantees that Meowscarada can set at least one layer of Spikes and safely puts Meowscarada into Overgrow range. Tera Ghost can be used in a pinch to spinblock Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Torkoal.</p> <p>Meowscarada excels at setting up the tempo for hyper offense teams. Offensive Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp and Great Tusk can stack entry hazards to put even more pressure on the opposing team, with mixed Garchomp threatening Corviknight from using Defog; in return, Meowscarada's Knock Off removes Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Dragonite and Volcarona to make them susceptible to Stealth Rock. By stacking entry hazards, Gholdengo becomes a near-mandatory teammate to prevent every attempt of hazard removal; Gholdengo also takes advantage of entry hazards itself to pressure checks like Toxapex and Clodsire, which makes Nasty Plot variants particularly difficult to deal with. Setup sweepers commonly found on hyper offense teams such as Dragonite, Kingambit, Baxcalibur, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth appreciate Spikes chipping down Pokemon like Dondozo, Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Clodsire. Furthermore, they enjoy Meowscarada crippling defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight and Amoonguss with Knock Off, with Dragonite and Kingambit in particular also appreciating Meowscarada luring in and dealing with Great Tusk.</p> "

        "name": "Utility Pivot",
        "description": "<p>With Heavy-Duty Boots, Meowscarada becomes a flexible offensive pivot capable of pressuring the opponent thanks to its high Speed and Protean-boosted U-turn, grabbing momentum for its teammates. Knock Off's high power and item removal make it an excellent move for making progress against foes such as Volcarona, Dragonite, Corviknight, and Toxapex. Flower Trick hits common Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Rotom-W for super effective damage, and its ability to always score a critical hit is very helpful against Defense-boosting foes like Garganacl. Aside from pivoting, U-turn gives super effective coverage against Hydreigon and Roaring Moon, which resist the combination of Knock Off and Flower Trick. Finally, Sucker Punch is a great option to pick off weakened faster foes such as Dragapult, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and Speed Booster Energy users such as Iron Moth. Alternatively, Taunt is great for shutting down support Pokemon such as Toxapex, Tera Fairy Garganacl, and Scream Tail. Tera Dark allows Meowscarada to always OHKO Gholdengo with Knock Off and gives it a chance to OHKO it with Sucker Punch while also removing Meowscarada's weakness from Baxcalibur's Ice Shard. Tera Grass allows Meowscarada's Flower Trick to always 2HKO Garganacl and gives it a chance to OHKO offensive Great Tusk.</p> <p>Pivot Meowscarada fits on a variety of offensive and balance teams looking for a flexible Pokemon that can both exert pressure on the opponent and grab momentum. Since Meowscarada forces a lot of switches and is adept at wearing down foes with U-turn, entry hazard support from the likes of Great Tusk, Glimmora, and Ting-Lu is greatly appreciated. Meowscarada's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots through Knock Off makes it excellent for accentuating hazard damage. Gholdengo is a good partner, as it helps keep entry hazards on the field and can threaten Pokemon that force Meowscarada out, such as Breloom and Amoonguss. In return, Meowscarada threatens Ting-Lu and weakened Greak Tusk, which Gholdengo greatly appreciates. Meowscarada's U-turn support pairs well with powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Band Baxcalibur and Choice Specs Dragapult by giving them free entry onto the field. Meowscarada's Knock Off also cripples Corviknight for these two Pokemon. In return, these wallbreakers threaten Pokemon that Meowscarada lures in, such as Amoonguss and Dragonite. Late-game cleaners such as Booster Energy Iron Valiant, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Kingambit are great partners that can help finish off a team that Meowscarada has worn down. All of the aforementioned offensive teammates appreciate Meowscarada pressuring their checks like Dondozo, Garganacl, and Rotom-W.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Meowscarada is a powerful offensive pivot that excels at using its high Speed and Protean-boosted attacks to force progress against the enemy team. Knock Off will generally be Meowscarada's most used move due to its high power and ability to force progress through item removal, crippling checks like Corviknight and Amoonguss. Flower Trick is Meowscarada's strongest attack, and its ability to always land a critical hit is very useful against foes that boost Defense, such as Dondozo, Curse Garganacl, and Bulk Up Great Tusk. With a Choice Band, Meowscarada has a good chance to OHKO offensive Great Tusk with Flower Trick. U-turn is great for grabbing momentum against Pokemon Meowscarada threatens out, such as Ting-Lu and Rotom-W, and provides super effective coverage against Hydreigon and Roaring Moon. Sucker Punch lets Meowscarada snipe faster foes such as Dragapult and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. Alternatively, Play Rough is an option that lets Meowscarada do great damage to Dragonite, which otherwise takes little from Meowscarada's attacks. Play Rough also allows Meowscarada to score an OHKO against Baxcalibur. Thunder Punch is a niche option to hit Corviknight and Tera Flying Pokemon like Kingambit and Gholdengo super effectively. Low Kick may also potentially be used to OHKO Kingambit and Baxcalibur. Both Tera Dark and Tera Grass are good options to boost the power of Meowscarada's STAB moves to enormous levels; for example, Tera Grass enables Meowscarada to OHKO Clodsire most of the time, while Tera Dark Knock Off easily OHKOes standard bulky Cinderace. Tera Fairy is a niche option that boosts the power of Play Rough and can help Meowscarada avoid being revenge killed by priority such as Mach Punch from Breloom and Ice Shard from Baxcalibur, allowing it to OHKO them in return.</p> <p>Choice Band Meowscarada's unique blend of speed and power lets it act as both a wallbreaker and pivot on offensive teams. In particular, Meowscarada's U-turn support couples well with powerful but frail wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark by giving them free entry onto the battlefield. Hisuian Zoroark can also take advantage of Illusion and its immunity-laden typing to disguise itself as Meowscarada, which may force guesswork from the opponent and give it even more opportunities to fire off its strong attacks. Since Meowscarada forces many switches and can remove Heavy-Duty Boots through Knock Off, entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Garchomp is highly recommended. Gholdengo is another good partner that can prevent attempts to remove entry hazards while also switching into Pokemon that threaten out Meowscarada, such as Breloom, Amoonguss, and Corviknight. In return, Gholdengo appreciates Meowscarada's ability to deal with Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Tera Water Garganacl. Kingambit is a great Pokemon that can serve as a late-game cleaner after Meowscarada has weakened the enemy team with U-turn and Knock Off. Dragon Dance Dragonite is another great cleaner that, like Kingambit, appreciates Meowscarada's ability to break past Dondozo.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Equipped with Choice Scarf, Meowscarada outspeeds both the entirety of the unboosted metagame and even some +1 Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake. It also has strong offensive pressure thanks to Protean. Knock Off allows Meowscarada to remove important items from Pokemon that rely on them, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite, Tera Fairy Skeledirge, and Volcarona, as well as Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from Corviknight and Amoonguss. U-turn allows Meowscarada to serve as a fast pivot to keep up momentum, and with the boost from Protean, it can OHKO or dent slower Pokemon like opposing Meowscarada and Greninja. Play Rough allows Meowscarada to threaten Dragon-, Dark-, and Fighting-types such as Walking Wake, Dragapult, Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant. Trick allows Meowscarada to cripple walls such as Tera Fairy Garganacl, Amoonguss, and Toxapex. Tera Grass removes Meowscarada's Dark typing, eliminating its weakness to Mach Punch from Breloom and Pawmot, and strengthens its Flower Trick. Tera Fairy grants Meowscarada a resistance to Fighting but also keeps its resistance to Sucker Punch while simultaneously boosting Play Rough. Tera Dark boosts the power of Meowscarada's Knock Off, granting it a chance to OHKO Skeledirge. Terastallizing Meowscarada also negates Protean's effects, giving it more a consistent defensive typing.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Meowscarada fits best on various balance and offensive teams. It appreciates entry hazard support from Garchomp and Ting-Lu, since Meowscarada's Speed and coverage can force many switches, especially with its Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes. Hazards can also break the Focus Sash of users like Hisuian Zoroark, Ceruledge, and Breloom for Meowscarada to KO them more easily. When Meowscarada isn't running Play Rough, it can struggle against Walking Wake, Iron Valiant, and Dragonite. Hence, Pokemon that can check them, such as Water Absorb Clodsire, Tera Fairy Garganacl, and Dondozo, make for good teammates; Clodsire can handle Walking Wake, Tera Fairy Garganacl can handle Iron Valiant, and Dondozo walls Dragonite. Despite Meowscarada's coverage options, it finds itself struggling to break past walls like Amoonguss and Corviknight as well as offensive Pokemon like Iron Moth and Volcarona. Hence, Meowscarada appreciates Pokemon that can check them like Volcarona for Amoonguss and Corviknight, and Skeledirge for Iron Moth and opposing Volcarona. Meowscarada's role as a pivot means that it can enable sweeps from Iron Valiant and the aforementioned Volcarona by bringing them in on Ting-Lu and Corviknight, respectively.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Skeledirge is a fantastic defensive Pokemon thanks to its great bulk and Unaware letting it check dangerous Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Volcarona, and Hatterene. Unlike other walls, however, Skeledirge can also be a foreboding wincon with Torch Song and its great offensive typing, which gives it nearly unresisted coverage. Will-O-Wisp gives it value against switch-ins such as Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Clodsire and cripples physical attackers like Great Tusk and Garchomp. Hex benefits from Skeledirge spreading burns, 2HKOing Pokemon such as Dragonite, Iron Hands, and physically defensive Dondozo unboosted, and Toxapex after a single boost from Torch Song. Tera Fairy bolsters Skeledirge against Dragon-types that would otherwise overwhelm it like Dragapult, Dragonite, Garchomp, and Baxcalibur. It also lets Skeledirge beat Quaquaval and lose its Ground weakness, letting it more easily spread burns against Ground-types like Great Tusk and Garchomp. In a pinch, it can bait Dark-type moves from Pokemon like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Meowscarada, Terastallize the same turn, and punish them with Will-O-Wisp. Tera Fairy also maintains Skeledirge's ability to beat Iron Valiant, Volcarona, and Hatterene.</p> <p>Skeledirge fits on many bulky offense, balance, and stall teams as a much-appreciated answer to common wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant and Hatterene. Skeledirge often ends up entry hazard fodder for Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire. Thus, secure hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight are excellent partners. Additionally, Great Tusk can 2HKO the aforementioned Pokemon, helping set Skeledirge up for a potential sweep, while Corviknight walls the aforementioned Ground-types, can bring Skeledirge in later with U-turn, and can absorb Knock Off from the likes of Great Tusk, Meowscarada, and Iron Treads. Pokemon such as Meowscarada and Iron Valiant can overwhelm Skeledirge answers like Gholdengo, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu. In addition to this, they appreciate Skeledirge's ability to beat Hatterene and, after Terastallizing, Dragapult. Covert Cloak Gholdengo can beat any Garganacl using Skeledirge as setup fodder. Bulky Water-types like Rotom-W and Toxapex help deal with offensive Water-types like Greninja and Quaquaval. Additionally, they can both spread status, facilitating Skeledirge's Hex. Rotom-W in particular can offensively check Ground-types like Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Ting-Lu too, although it cannot directly switch into them. Offensive Pokemon like Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Kingambit, and Dragonite appreciate Skeledirge halting scary Pokemon, like Volcarona and Iron Valiant, and they help it overwhelm checks like Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With Substitute, Skeledirge can use its typing and bulk to consistently check Garganacl and more easily snowball with Torch Song. Substitute also allows Skeledirge to scout Choice item Pokemon like Roaring Moon and Dragonite, as well as protecting it from revenge killers like Kingambit and Roaring Moon more reliably. Substitute also lets Skeledirge set up against the likes of Garganacl and Cinderace, and it blocks from status from the likes of Toxapex, Clodsire, and Thunder Wave Rotom-W. Maximum HP investment means that Garganacl cannot break Substitute with Salt Cure. 40 Defense EVs let Skeledirge survive two Bulldozes from Focus Sash Breloom, meaning it can consistently outheal Bulldoze, barring a critical hit. 188 Special Defense EVs ensures it survives a Shadow Ball from non-Tera Ghost Choice Specs Dragapult, while 28 Speed EVs let it outspeed Kingambit. Tera Fairy helps stop the likes of Dragapult and Great Tusk from overwhelming Skeledirge, especially the former, which bypasses Substitute with Infiltrator but cannot 2HKO Skeledirge after it Terastallizes. Tera Fairy also prevents Garganacl's Earthquake from breaking Substitute.</p> <p>Substitute Skeledirge fits best on bulky offense and balance teams as a good check to Garganacl. Pokemon Garganacl can overwhelm such as Dragonite, Hex Dragapult, Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, Calm Mind Hatterene, Corviknight, Toxapex, and Dondozo can lure it in for Skeledirge to set up Substitute on and snowball. Additionally, the former can break through Pokemon that wall Skeledirge, namely Toxapex and Clodsire, and Dragapult and Corviknight also boast U-turn, letting them pivot into Skeledirge on a Garganacl switch-in. The setup sweepers enjoy Skeledirge's potent wallbreaking, too. Toxapex and Dondozo also check Pokemon that overwhelm Skeledirge, such as Dragapult and Greninja. Pokemon that do not mind Knock Off like Great Tusk and Corviknight greatly help this set, as Skeledirge is both weak to Knock Off and reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots due to its Stealth Rock weakness. These Pokemon also double as entry hazard removers, with the former preventing Gholdengo from entering safely and the latter checking Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard setters such as Garchomp and Meowscarada can chip down Pokemon that wall Skeledirge like Ting-Lu and Clodsire.

Bulk Up lets it more easily take out threats like Great Tusk, Armarouge, and Ting-Lu and survive attacks from Pokemon such as Baxcalibur, Tera Flying Roaring Moon, and Azumarill. Close Combat hits Pokemon that can take an Aqua Step, like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, Hydreigon, and Baxcalibur, super effectively. Roost gives Quaquaval longevity to accumulate and take advantage of its boosts, and it allows Quaquaval to switch into Kingambit and Cinderace without fearing chip damage. Taunt shuts down Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Skeledirge by preventing the use of recovery and status-inflicting moves. It also blocks Defense-boosting attempts from Curse and Bulk Up users like Great Tusk and Garganacl. Ice Spinner is a great coverage move that hits Pokemon that would otherwise resist Quaquaval's STAB attacks, like Dragonite, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Amoonguss. 112 Speed EVs allow Quaquaval to outspeed Iron Moth after a boost. Tera Water boosts Aqua Step's power and removes Quaquaval's weakness to threats like Iron Valiant, Azumarill, and Future Sight Slowking. Tera Fighting boosts Close Combat’s power to dent threats like Garchomp and Breloom. It also allows Quaquaval to take less damage from Garganacl’s Salt Cure. Tera Poison is a defensive option that allows Quaquaval to resist Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Azumarill, absorb Toxic Spikes, and be immune to Toxapex and Clodsire's Toxic.</p> <p>Quaquaval fits best on offense teams that support its ability to set up and sweep. Entry hazards from Pokemon like Meowscarada and Glimmora give Quaquaval an easier time taking out foes. Pivots like Rotom-W and Cinderace bring Quaquaval safely onto the field against threats like Volcarona, Great Tusk, and Baxcalibur. Cinderace in particular is able to provide entry hazard control with Court Change and can burn foes with Will-O-Wisp, giving Quaquaval an easier time to set up and sweep. Quaquaval targets common Fire-, Ground-, and Dark-types; therefore, it can support teammates weak to them like Corviknight and Gholdengo. In return, Corviknight can pivot Quaquaval into battle, come in on Assault Vest Toxapex, and remove entry hazards. Gholdengo blocks status that prevent Quaquaval from sweeping should it not run Taunt. Quaquaval struggles against Pokemon like Dragonite, Dragapult, and Azumarill; therefore, threats to them like Scizor, Iron Valiant, and Baxcalibur make good teammates. Scizor checks Azumarill, while Iron Valiant and Baxcalibur check Dragonite and Dragapult. Baxcalibur also dents Azumarill heavily, allowing Quaquaval to take it out more easily.</p> "

In addition to letting it contest with Attack-boosting foes like Dragonite, Dragapult, and Roaring Moon, Curse boosts Salt Cure's initial damage to threaten Pokemon like Corviknight, which would otherwise exhaust Salt Cure's PP with Pressure. Curse also works well with Earthquake, breaking past Covert Cloak Gholdengo, non-Haze Toxapex, opposing Garganacl, and Skeledirge's Substitute.

Knock Off users such as Great Tusk and Meowscarada are crucial to remove Covert Cloak and Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Amoonguss, Clodsire, Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Slowking. Great Tusk, Meowscarada, Toxapex, and Clodsire can also set entry hazards of their own, either allowing Garganacl to forgo Stealth Rock or forming an entry hazard stacking core. Offensive teammates like Dragapult and Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Meowscarada are great against offensive teams that contain the likes of Baxcalibur, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon—which can overwhelm Garganacl prior to boosting—and can clean up late-game in case Garganacl is unable to fully sweep.

While Garganacl is given a Ghost resistance from Purifying Salt, it cannot fully check Dragapult and Gholdengo prior to Terastallization, with the latter completely countering it if it uses Covert Cloak. As such, Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Clodsire make for great teammates. Pokemon like Corviknight and Scizor appreciate Garganacl checking Fire-types like Ceruledge and Skeledirge. Corviknight is notable in that it also forms a strong defensive core with Garganacl, checking Meowscarada for it. Entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and the aforementioned Corviknight are appreciated, as Garganacl is heavily pressured by entry hazards and cannot set up reliably if it is worn down. Frail, offensive Pokemon like Cinderace appreciate chip damage being forced onto their checks and having a strong defensive Pokemon to fall back on. Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Iron Valiant can pave the way for Garganacl to clean late-game, wearing down or significantly pressuring its checks in Gholdengo, Meowscarada, and Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Great Tusk.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Armarouge carves a niche for itself with its powerful STAB moves and passable Speed alongside its unique setup and offensive utility. Endure allows Armarouge to survive any direct attack, and when combined with Weak Armor's speed boost, it can allow Armarouge to turn the tables on faster physical threats like Great Tusk, Dragapult, Baxcalibur, and Garchomp. Expanding Force is Armarouge's most powerful attack in Psychic Terrain and 2HKOed all neutral targets besides the uncommon Blissey. Moreover, with Spikes support or Tera Psychic, it can reliably OHKO the likes of Clodsire and Baxcalibur. Armor Cannon is Armarouge's strongest move outside of Psychic Terrain and complements Expanding Force well, OHKOing Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Corviknight and 2HKOing Hatterene. Calm Mind capitalizes on the switches it forces, allowing it to always OHKO Rotom-W and Volcarona with Expanding Force while often OHKOing Garganacl. Destiny Bond can instead force a trade against threats it cannot OHKO normally, such as Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and bulky threats like Ting-Lu and Dondozo. If Psychic Terrain is not active, Destiny Bond forces Sucker Punch users like Kingambit into a difficult situation, where they must either KO Armarouge next turn and faint or switch out and let Armarouge land a powerful attack for free. Tera Psychic powers up Expanding Force to ludicrous levels, allowing it to 2HKO specially defensive Skeledirge and OHKO Dondozo, physically defensive Garganacl, Clodsire, Garchomp, Volcarona, and Baxcalibur while OHKOing Assault Vest Toxapex after a Calm Mind boost. Focus Sash gives Armarouge space to survive at least one hit from full HP, allowing it to set up a Calm Mind or hit attackers back, and it can punish a contact move without committing to Endure. A Modest nature gives Armarouge the best odds of OHKOing Clodsire, Rotom-W, Walking Wake, and Baxcalibur after chip damage from entry hazards, but a Timid nature helps Armarouge sweep late-game by outpacing Speed-boosting Walking Wake with Protosynthesis active, outpacing +1 Iron Moth, and tying with +1 Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Armarouge is a staple on \"Psychic spam\" teams, which use Psychic Terrain and a litany of powerful setup sweepers to overwhelm opponents at a breakneck pace. Psychic Terrain blocks priority moves, including Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed, rendering Armarouge very difficult to revenge kill after a Weak Armor boost. Indeedee is a mandatory teammate to set Psychic Terrain, and it can wear down Dark-types with Dazzling Gleam. Furthermore, its Healing Wish can give a weakened Armarouge or one of its teammates a second chance to sweep. Polteageist is another common Psychic spam threat that can threaten the Dark-types Armarouge struggles against with a Fighting-type Tera Blast; in return, Armarouge can handle Steel-types, which Polteageist would otherwise be forced to Terastallize against. One of Armarouge or Polteageist can also wear down Ting-Lu, allowing the other to break past it and sweep late-game. Entry hazard control is extremely important, especially hazard removal, since Armarouge greatly prefers having Focus Sash active to sweep. Eject Pack Great Tusk provides excellent role compression for these teams, since it provides both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, and it can get Armarouge in safely by activating Eject Pack with Close Combat or Headlong Rush; notably, Armarouge can use Stealth Rock to more easily OHKO Rotom-W, Assault Vest Toxapex, and Clodsire without using up its team's Terastallization. Hatterene can deter opposing entry hazards with Magic Bounce while spreading paralysis with Nuzzle and weakening Dark-types with Dazzling Gleam; it can also use Eject Button to reliably pivot in Armarouge if Psychic Terrain is up. Magic Bounce also deters Taunt users, which can otherwise prevent Armarouge from setting up with Calm Mind and Endure, and Hatterene can also offer Healing Wish support. Lastly, many other setup sweepers can fit well on Psychic Terrain teams to open up a sweep for Armarouge, or to sweep once Armarouge punches holes for them. Volcarona and Dragon Dance Baxcalibur can weaken or eliminate Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon, which Armarouge struggles greatly against, while Armarouge can break past Clodsire and Unaware walls for Volcarona to sweep, and it can deal with Steel-types to assist Baxcalibur.</p> "

Additionally, Ceruludge's immunity to Will-O-Wisp thanks to Flash Fire is a major advantage, making it more consistent against Pokemon like Rotom-W and bulky Volcarona. Bitter Blade offers Ceruledge much-appreciated recovery, letting it maintain longevity and more easily set up. Shadow Sneak is valuable priority, letting Ceruledge pick off threats such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, Iron Valiant, and opposing Ceruledge that have been worn down. Taunt is important for preventing phazing from the likes of Ting-Lu while also preventing Toxapex's Haze. It also prevents status from the likes of Toxapex and Rotom-W, as well as recovery from defensive Pokemon like Clodsire, Toxapex, and Skeledirge. 12 Speed EVs ensure that Ceruledge is able to outspeed defensive Rotom-W, letting it prevent Thunder Wave with Taunt while being able to set up after Terastalization. Tera Bug gives Ceruledge a generally solid defensive typing with few weaknesses that synergizes well with Flash Fire. Additionally, it turns Ceruledge's Ground weakness into a resistance, letting it more easily take on Pokemon like Great Tusk and Tera Ground Volcarona. Meanwhile, Tera Fairy lets Ceruledge withstand hits from the likes of Choice Specs Dragapult and mixed Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Ceruledge fits on various offensive teams as a potent wincon thanks to its combination of Bulk Up and Bitter Blade giving it good longevity. Wallbreakers such as Kingambit, Iron Valiant, and Greninja can break through Pokemon that would otherwise check Ceruledge like Dondozo and Garganacl, letting Ceruledge more easily find opportunities to clean. Pokemon like Meowscarada, Great Tusk, and Breloom appreciate Ceruledge's ability to check Volcarona. In return, these Pokemon can wear down threats like Rotom-W for Ceruledge to take advantage of later. Ceruledge's typing leaves it vulnerable to Dark-type Pokemon like Roaring Moon and Hydreigon. Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Scream Tail make for solid teammates, as they can take a hit from and overwhelm these threats. In return, Ceruledge can act as a much-appreciated check to Pokemon like Iron Moth and Cinderace. Breloom also appreciates Ceruledge's ability to check Fire-types, and in return it can OHKO both Hydreigon and Roaring Moon with Mach Punch. Entry hazard support from the likes of Garchomp, Glimmora, and Meowscarada helps wear down aforementioned checks like Roaring Moon and Hydreigon.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Ceruledge’s access to Swords Dance lets it leverage its powerful STAB combination and great attacking options to function as a threatening wallbreaker. At +2, Ceruledge is capable of OHKOing Corviknight, Amoonguss, bulky Volcarona, and defensive Gholdengo with Bitter Blade. Shadow Sneak serves as a secondary STAB attack, preferred for its priority that lets it heavily damage faster threats like Iron Valiant and Dragapult at +2, OHKOing the latter and making offensive counterplay to Ceruledge harder. Taunt can be run over Shadow Sneak to stop entry hazard setters and sweepers from setting up, giving Ceruledge a chance to break foes with recovery such as Clodsire without the opponent gaining too much progress. Taunt also prevents Ceruledge by being statused by the likes of Clodsire and Rotom-W. Close Combat OHKOs specially defensive Garganacl after a Swords Dance boost while 2HKOing Ting-Lu, physically defensive Garganacl, and Rotom-W, all of which are not threatened by Bitter Blade. Solar Blade threatens Dondozo, Garganacl, Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Great Tusk while sun is active. Focus Sash can ensure that Weak Armor and Swords Dance are activated, allowing Ceruledge to sweep more reliably. Life Orb is an alternative option that makes it possible to OHKO Ting-Lu and 2HKO Great Tusk at +2. Weak Armor couples incredibly well with Focus Sash, and its resistances to types like Bug and Fire, allowing Ceruledge to gain a free Speed boost by switching into U-turn from pivots like Corviknight and Cinderace, as well as Pyro Ball from the latter. Flash Fire lets Ceruledge function as a more reliable switch-in to Fire-types like Iron Moth, while potentially powering up Bitter Blade. Tera Fire provides extra power to Bitter Blade in order to OHKO Amoonguss and 2HKO Tera Steel Toxapex before Swords Dance. Tera Fighting provides Ceruledge with a Dark-resistance, allowing it to take attacks from the likes of Kingambit and Roaring Moon, particularly Sucker Punch from the former, in order to gain a Speed boost from Weak Armor. However, beware of other neutral attacks from such threats, as Choice Band Roaring Moon will still be able to OHKO Ceruledge with Dragon Claw. After a Swords Dance, Tera Fighting gives Close Combat enough extra power to OHKO all Garganacl sets, Ting-Lu, and Rotom-W after Stealth Rock chip. Tera Grass can be used together with Solar Blade in order to 2HKO Dondozo under sun. If running a Jolly nature, Ceruledge can outspeed Gholdengo and Baxcalibur, as well as Booster Energy Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf Meowscarada, and +1 Roaring Moon and Adamant Dragapult after a Weak Armor boost. Jolly, however, notably misses out on Adamant’s chance to OHKO Great Tusk and Ting-Lu at +2 with Tera Fighting Close Combat, as well as ensuring a 2HKO against Clodsire with Bitter Blade after Stealth Rock chip.</p> <p>Ceruledge fits best on offensive teams, mainly those that use sun, in addition to some bulky offense teams that can provide it opportunities to enter battle and set up safely. As one of few viable physical Fire-types, Ceruledge has great synergy with Torkoal, which can activate sun to boost Bitter Blade’s power and allow Solar Blade to be used in one turn. Torkoal also sets Stealth Rock, removes hazards with Rapid Spin, and can spread status with Lava Plume and Yawn to allow Ceruledge safe entry. Walking Wake benefits from Ceruledge’s unique coverage on sun teams, as it appreciates foes like Azumarill and Slowking being removed. In return, Walking Wake can pressure foes like Skeledirge and Great Tusk. Great Tusk and Hatterene are also good partners on sun teams, as they can keep entry hazards off the field so that Ceruledge can enter battle safely with its Focus Sash intact. Ceruledge struggles with physical walls like Rotom-W and Great Tusk, as well as Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Dondozo. Choice Specs Iron Valiant has coverage for these foes, while Booster Energy variants threaten faster attackers like Roaring Moon and Dragapult. Mixed Garchomp puts pressure on most of Ceruledge’s checks, like Dondozo and Skeledirge, while luring in Corviknight so that Ceruledge can take advantage of its U-turn in order to activate Weak Armor. Corviknight itself is a good partner, as it is able to lure in Cinderace, another Pokemon Ceruledge can take advantage of, and pivot Ceruledge into battle safely. But, it can be a drain on momentum for more offensive teams. Ceruledge works well with hazard setters, as extra chip damage helps Ceruledge break foes like Garganacl and Rotom-W. In return, Ceruledge pressures Corviknight and can spinblock with its Ghost typing, but it doesn’t often do so due to bad matchups against common Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk. Examples of hazard-setting teammates include Great Tusk and Meowscarada, with the former being able to check Dark-types like Kingambit in the event Ceruledge cannot Terastallize, and the latter checking Rotom-W and Great Tusk.</p> "

Leaf Storm OHKOes foes like Great Tusk, Greninja, and Rotom-W while hitting Ting-Lu for a good amount as well. Rapid Spin is useful because Toedscruel is faster than every Stealth Rock setter in the tier besides Garchomp and Iron Treads, letting it switch in late-game to clear entry hazards if needed. Earth Power is an alternative over both moves, as it hits Clodsire, Torkoal, Kingambit, Iron Moth, and Glimmora while also chipping Dragapult. The combination of Earth Power and Rapid Spin allows Toedscruel to be a great lead into Glimmora, as it can use Earth Power to take Glimmora down to its Focus Sash, then Rapid Spin to remove the entry hazards that were set. Both of its STAB moves hit Garganacl quite hard, another common Stealth Rock setter, which hyper offense teams appreciate being scared out. Another great application of this combination is against spin blockers such as Ceruledge, Skeledirge and Gholdengo, which are all threatened to Tera or switch out by Earth Power, letting Toedscruel Rapid Spin. Tera Ghost allows Toedscruel to block Rapid Spin against Iron Treads and Great Tusk in a pinch.</p> <p>Lead Toedscruel is only seen on hyper offense teams, as it guarantees a critical layer of Spikes or a slept foe, regardless of abilities such as Good as Gold, Purifying Salt, and Magic Bounce, assisting in the late-game; the former is helpful for damage rolls and breaking Focus Sash, while the latter gives setup sweepers free turns. With that in mind, great partners include setup sweepers like Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit, the latter of which also appreciates Toedscruel fainting early-game, giving it a Supreme Overlord boost. Some threats to this set include Meowscarada, which is incredibly annoying because Taunt shuts down Toedscruel's entry hazards and Spore, and it cannot punish this, as it resists both Leaf Storm and Earth Power. Kingambit is a great choice for dealing with Meowscarada, as it resists Leaf Storm and Knock off and can threaten it with a powerful Low Kick or Iron Head without fear of Taunt. Hydreigon is also quite troublesome; its resistance to Leaf Storm and immunity to Earth Power allows it to set up a Substitute without fear of being put to sleep due to Mycelium Might causing Spore to move second. Dragapult serves as a great teammate, as it can threaten Hydreigon behind Substitute. Choice Band Dragapult is bothersome, as it OHKOes Toedscruel with Dragon Darts, but it is easily taken advantage of by Fairy-types like Azumarill and Iron Valiant if it OHKOes Toedscruel. Gholdengo is also a fantastic teammate, as it blocks attempts to clear Toedscruels's entry hazards and takes advantage of Spore by setting up with Nasty Plot.</p> "

Its fantastic defensive typing allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes and nets it nice resistances to Fighting and Fairy, letting it check a unique combination of threatening offensive Pokemon like Volcarona, Iron Valiant, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W. To aid in checking them, it runs Toxic to put these Pokemon on a timer, stalling with Recover as poison damage increases.

The former reflects both Toxic and entry hazards while overpowering its healing with Psyshock, and the latter is immune to Toxic via Good as Gold, even if it loses its Steel typing. Great teammates to help check these two are Gholdengo itself for Hatterene, which threatens Hatterene with Make It Rain and its unpredictable set versatility, and Kingambit for opposing Gholdengo, which resists both of Gholdengo's STAB moves and can immediately threaten to OHKO it back. In turn, these two appreciate Clodsire checking the Fire-types that scare them out, especially Volcarona, Iron Moth, and Skeledirge. Bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo can check the Water-type threats Clodsire fears, like Floatzel and Azumarill. Baxcalibur is a great offensive teammate as well, as Clodsire can stonewall Iron Valiant for it, while Baxcalibur can threaten the Ground-types that Clodsire fears.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Kingambit is a potent late-game cleaner and wincon thanks to Supreme Overlord and Sucker Punch, which compensates for its poor Speed tier. Its remarkable defensive profile grants it multiple opportunities to wreak havoc: it soft checks and takes advantage of prominent threats like Dragapult, Meowscarada, Baxcalibur, and Gholdengo—which can be problematic for offensive teams—while forcing out defensive foes like Hatterene, Toxapex, and Slowking. Swords Dance lets Kingambit set up on these foes to clean up late-game more easily, and it can potentially wallbreak early-game if need be. Iron Head smashes through Fairy-types and Tera Fairy users like Hatterene, Scream Tail, and Skeledirge, Toxapex, Baxcalibur, and Rotom-W. Low Kick most importantly OHKOes Roaring Moon and opposing Kingambit, and it severely dents Ting-Lu and Iron Treads. Tera Dark—especially alongside Black Glasses, if running it—cranks up Kingambit's damage output for even more late-game potential. Tera Dark in particular allows Sucker Punch to OHKO Gholdengo without a boost, as well as Baxcalibur and Garchomp at +2, and it also removes Kingambit's Ground weakness for foes like Garchomp and Ting-Lu. Tera Fire flips the matchup against Volcarona, Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Focus Sash Ceruledge, as well as stopping the former two and foes like Rotom-W, Dragapult, and Tera Water Skeledirge from crippling it with a burn. Moreover, the Fighting neutrality allows Kingambit to soft check Iron Valiant and Breloom, and it can set up safely on Body Press Corviknight. Lum Berry gives Kingambit more setup opportunities in the face of status users like Rotom-W and Dragapult, especially if it can't utilize Tera Fire to block their Will-O-Wisp. A Jolly nature allows Kingambit to outspeed uninvested Great Tusk and Rotom-W, and it works well on Low Kick variants to—at worst—Speed tie and OHKO opposing Kingambit.</p> <p>Kingambit fits well on offensive teams, which range from offense to hyper offense. Entry hazards from teammates like Glimmora, Meowscarada, and Garchomp are near mandatory, as they deactivate Focus Sash on foes like Greninja, Polteageist, and Ceruledge and chip down foes into Kingambit's KO range. Also, these setters tending to faint early-game helps Kingambit accumulate Supreme Overlord boosts. Wallbreakers such as Baxcalibur, Iron Moth, Dragapult, and Iron Valiant are necessary to pressure the opposition early-game, especially because they can overwhelm and individually threaten Kingambit's checks like Dondozo, Corviknight, and Great Tusk; Iron Moth in particular deals with troublesome Fairy-types if Kingambit lacks Iron Head. In return, Kingambit deals with Dragapult for Baxcalibur and Gholdengo for Iron Valiant, with Low Kick variants dealing with opposing Kingambit for Dragapult as well. Other setup sweepers like Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Volcarona are secondary wincons in case Kingambit is unable to fully sweep, especially if it runs Swords Dance to overwhelm their shared checks like Dondozo, Corviknight, and Tera Water Garganacl and Skeledirge. Aside from rain teams weakening the Fire-type moves from Iron Moth and Dragapult, they support Kingambit with wallbreakers like Floatzel, Azumarill, and Greninja, which threaten Great Tusk and overwhelm Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl and Skeledirge. Kingambit also takes advantage of Floatzel fainting early-game from Wave Crash recoil to gain a Supreme Overlord boost.</p> "

        "name": "Bulky Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Kingambit is one of the metagame's most powerful late-game wincons due to its high Attack bolstered further by Swords Dance and a fantastic ability in Supreme Overlord, excellent natural bulk and a good defensive typing, and access to a powerful STAB Sucker Punch to make up for its poor Speed. Kowtow Cleave is Kingambit's most reliable STAB option; with a Swords Dance boost and Supreme Overlord's maximum number of boosts, it is powerful enough to OHKO physically defensive Corviknight after Stealth Rock damage the majority of the time. Sucker Punch allows Kingambit to greatly pressure offensive threats, allowing it to eliminate weakened foes like Walking Wake, Hisuian Zoroark, Volcarona, Iron Moth, and Floatzel. With boosts from Supreme Overlord and Swords Dance, it can even handle bulkier threats like Roaring Moon where its high bulk investment allows it to attack them first, survive a hit, and KO them with Sucker Punch thereafter. Iron Head is a consistent STAB option that can eliminate Garganacl, Baxcalibur, Hatterene, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge while pressuring Roaring Moon without relying on Sucker Punch predictions against Dragon Dance variants. Tera Blast alongside a Fairy or Flying Tera type allows Kingambit to punish Fighting-types like Iron Valiant, Great Tusk, and Breloom by turning its 4x Fighting weakness into a resistance and OHKOing them in return with a super effective attack, though this comes at the cost of requiring Kingambit to Terastallize in order to maximize its coverage. Tera Fairy also improves Kingambit's matchup against Dragon-types like Baxcalibur and Roaring Moon, while Tera Flying grants it a Ground immunity to allow it to turn Great Tusk into setup fodder. 20 Speed EVs allow Kingambit to outspeed minimum Speed Corviknight, while the HP investment allows Kingambit to survive powerful attacks like Choice Band Baxcalibur's Earthquake and Choice Specs Iron Valiant's Moonblast, allowing it to potentially set up against them and sweep.</p> <p>Kingambit is an excellent wincon on bulky offense and balanced teams. Ting-Lu and Garchomp provide Stealth Rock and Spikes support to let Kingambit KO Roaring Moon with a boosted Sucker Punch, and the chip damage from entry hazards can make up for fewer Supreme Overlord boosts should some of Kingambit's teammates still be healthy. Iron Valiant can use its strong mixed coverage to pressure Unaware walls like Dondozo and that would otherwise ignore Kingambit's Swords Dance boosts and prevent its sweep, while Hisuian Zoroark can eliminate Dondozo while pressuring Skeledirge and Amoonguss. In return, Kingambit's great bulk and good defensive typing let it check faster offensive threats like Dragapult and Meowscarada while resisting priority from Dragonite and Baxcalibur. Great Tusk appreciates Kingambit's ability to pressure Fairy-types that force it out, and in return, it wears down Steel-types—especially opposing Kingambit, which this set greatly appreciates, since it does not carry Low Kick—so Kingambit can sweep more easily. Dragon-types like Dragapult, Baxcalibur, Roaring Moon, and Dragonite all have excellent synergy with Kingambit, as it resists Dragon- and Ice-type attacks and can threaten Fairy-types like Hatterene and Tera Fairy Garganacl with Iron Head; any of these Dragon-types can run Choice item sets to help wallbreak for Kingambit, or Kingambit can assist in wallbreaking earlier in the game to facilitate their sweeps if they opt to run Dragon Dance sets instead. Baxcalibur can deter Will-O-Wisp attempts from Rotom-W and defensive Cinderace, while the other three resist Fire-type attacks from Volcarona and Iron Moth. Iron Moth and Volcarona themselves make for effective teammates, as they can handle threats like Corviknight and opposing Kingambit while wearing down walls like Dondozo to help Kingambit sweep. In return, Kingambit's powerful Sucker Punch can pressure fast and powerful physical attackers like Dragapult, Cinderace, and Baxcalibur that Volcarona and Iron Moth cannot reliably set up against. Lastly, Choice Scarf Gholdengo can take advantage of Corviknight and Amoonguss to help Kingambit break through defensive cores long-term and can use Trick to cripple walls like Skeledirge and Dondozo, giving Kingambit opportunities to exploit their newfound Choice locks and wear them down.</p> "

Dark / Steel is a great offensive typing that can hit Pokemon such as Skeledirge, Gholdengo, Dragapult, Garganacl, and Iron Valiant super effectively as well as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Corviknight neutrally. Tera Flying completely reverses Kingambit's weaknesses and resistances and can catch Pokemon looking to KO Kingambit with Fighting- and Ground-type moves like Iron Valiant and Great Tusk, off guard. Alternatively, Kingambit can opt for Tera Ghost to better counter Tera Normal Dragonite, as Earthquake becomes neutral against Kingambit and Extreme Speed is ineffective. Similarly, Tera Fairy can be chosen because Kingambit then resists Roaring Moon's Crunch, which cannot OHKO Kingambit without Tera Steel. Kingambit chooses to run 144 Speed EVs to reliably outspeed Corviknight and Swords Dance Iron Hands; the rest of its investment is in HP to maximize bulk.</p> <p>Kingambit fits very well on hyper and bulky offense teams, as it works very well coming in after its teammates have fallen, such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, Breloom, and Dragonite. On hyper offense particularly, Grimmsnarl and Glimmora both work as great leads that set up screens and entry hazards, respectively. Kingambit checks opposing offensive Pokemon such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Meowscarada thanks to its defensive typing but loses out against revenge killers such as Breloom and other threats like Calm Mind Iron Valiant, Iron Hands, Dondozo, and Great Tusk; as such, Kingambit appreciates defensive support from Great Tusk, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W and offensive support from Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Dragapult.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Utility",
        "description": "<p>Great Tusk is the best offensive Rapid Spin user and a fantastic wallbreaker thanks to its typing, bulk, and high-Base Power STAB attacks. Great Tusk takes on a plethora of physical attackers in the tier, including Kingambit, Garchomp, and Scizor while also threatening entry hazard setters such as Glimmora, Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Garganacl. Knock Off prevents Air Balloon Gholdengo from completely spinblocking Great Tusk, and it also removes items such as Rocky Helmet, Leftovers, and Heavy-Duty Boots from defensive Pokemon that commonly switch into Great Tusk such as Dondozo, Corviknight, and Hatterene. Ice Spinner lets Great Tusk take on Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Garchomp more easily, though the lack of Close Combat leaves Great Tusk walled by Corviknight and Rotom-W. Maximum Speed investment paired with a Jolly nature ensures that Great Tusk is able to outspeed Rotom-W, non-Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and Jolly Dragonite. Tera Fighting makes Great Tusk much better at taking on Water-types such as Quaquaval while making Close Combat significantly harder to switch into; alternatively, Tera Steel lets Great Tusk flip its type weaknesses and take on Pokemon like Iron Valiant, and Tera Flying Roaring Moon. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Great Tusk from being worn down by Toxic Spikes and Spikes, letting it remove entry hazards consistently throughout a match; however, Leftovers provides Great Tusk with a form of recovery. Booster Energy is a niche option that provides Great Tusk with a one-time boost to its Attack, making it an immediately threatening wallbreaker without the use of Terastallization. Eject Pack forces Great Tusk out after it uses Headlong Rush or Close Combat, allowing it to take advantage of Pokemon like Dondozo and Corviknight trying to switch in.</p> <p>Great Tusk takes on Dark-type Pokemon such as Kingambit, and Ting-Lu, so Pokemon weak to Dark such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, Slowking, and Skeledirge appreciate Great Tusk; Slowking and Dragapult in particular are able to pivot in Great Tusk with Chilly Reception and U-turn, respectively. Great Tusk is also able to take on entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu and Garchomp and remove entry hazards from the field, so Pokemon that can be overwhelmed by hazards such as Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl appreciate Great Tusk's presence. Great Tusk struggles to take on faster special attackers such as Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Volcarona, so special walls such as Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Toxapex are great partners. Great Tusk also has difficulty with physical walls such as Dondozo, Tera Water and Tera Fairy Garganacl, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge. Spikes support from Ting-Lu, Glimmora, and Garchomp wears down these checks into range of Great Tusk's attacks, especially when paired with Knock Off. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, Iron Hands, and Breloom make for good partners by being able to overwhelm shared checks; Gholdengo is a noteworthy wallbreaker for also blocking opposing hazard removal. Torkoal is also an excellent partner for Great Tusk, setting up the sun to activate Protosynthesis and weaken Water-type attacks, while supporting other wallbreakers that can pressure the aforementioned physical walls, such as Choice Band Roaring Moon, Scovillain, and Slither Wing.</p> "

        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<p>Great Tusk has a solid niche as a defensive Pokemon by virtue of its utility, movepool, bulk, and typing. It can adequately check Pokemon like Kingambit, Cinderace, and Iron Hands, threatening them with a strong Earthquake in return. Stealth Rock lets Great Tusk compress even more roles, chipping away at the opposition. If another Stealth Rock user is already on the team, however, Body Press can take advantage of its high Defense stat and better threaten the likes of Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon. Body Press also lets Great Tusk catch Rotom-W with greater chip damage than Knock Off does on the switch. Knock Off provides valuable item removal, getting rid of Leftovers from Pokemon like Dondozo, Corviknight, and Hatterene, as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Volcarona and Dragonite. Additionally, Knock Off is Great Tusk's only initial way to hit Air Balloon Gholdengo, which can't OHKO this defensive set. Rapid Spin, besides clearing entry hazards, also allows Great Tusk to outspeed faster foes like Focus Sash Glimmora and Gholdengo. Tera Water grants Great Tusk an overall valuable defensive typing, letting it check threats like Baxcalibur and Azumarill and—in a pinch—foes like Iron Moth and Gholdengo while still maintaining a positive matchup against Dragonite, Kingambit, and opposing Great Tusk. Tera Fighting gets rid of Great Tusk's Ground typing, giving it a better matchup against Pokemon like Quaquaval and Floatzel while also strengthening Body Press if it is used. Alternatively, Tera Steel can give Great Tusk valuable resistances to Fairy, and Grass, turning the tables on Hatterene and Meowscarada. Leftovers greatly increases Great Tusk's longevity; however, Rocky Helmet can be used to wear down Pokemon like Scizor and Cinderace over time.</p> <p>After Great Tusk sets Stealth Rock, Corviknight effortlessly switches in and uses Defog to remove entry hazards, so Pokemon like Cinderace, Gholdengo, and Rotom-W that handle it are great partners. With no good way to hit Flying-types and Pokemon that use Tera Flying, Great Tusk can be set up on very quickly, most notably against the likes of Dragonite and Roaring Moon; even though the former dislikes Knock Off. Therefore, checks to these such as Dondozo and Corviknight are appreciated. A different Stealth Rock setter like Garganacl or Ting-Lu lets Great Tusk comfortably run Body Press without losing out on anything major. Ting-Lu also forms a potent entry hazard-stacking core with Great Tusk via Spikes. Further, it takes on the special attackers that Great Tusk struggles with, like Gholdengo, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Volcarona. Great Tusk is forced out by wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Quaquaval, so teammates that can check them like Amoonguss and Toxapex are welcome. Pokemon like Ceruledge, and Iron Moth appreciate the entry hazard removal that Great Tusk provides. Great Tusk's defensive qualities greatly help frail wallbreakers like Dragapult, and Iron Valiant, as these Pokemon need strong defensive Pokemon to fall back on very often.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>The combination of high Attack, powerful STAB moves, a decent movepool, and well-rounded physical bulk allows Great Tusk to function as a strong physical wallbreaker. It can support teams offensively with Knock Off and Rapid Spin as well as defensively through its ability to check Kingambit, Cinderace, and Choice Band Roaring Moon. Its dual STAB moves are able to OHKO or severely damage several key offensive Pokemon in the metagame such as Kingambit, and Tera Normal Dragonite. Knock Off allows Great Tusk to remove Leftovers from walls such as Corviknight and Dondozo. It can also remove important items from more offensive Pokemon, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite, Volcarona, and bulky pivot Roaring Moon, and it can provide coverage against Air Balloon Gholdengo, which otherwise checks this set. Ice Spinner hits Dragon-types that Headlong Rush isn't as strong against like bulky Garchomp and Dragonite. Alternatively, Rapid Spin can be run if the team is still in need of entry hazard removal. With Tera Fighting, Close Combat becomes much stronger, guaranteeing OHKOs against offensive Scizor sets. Tera Fighting also improves Great Tusk's matchups against Dondozo, Rotom-W, and opposing Great Tusk. With Tera Steel, Great Tusk can better handle Grass- and Fairy-types such as Meowscarada and Hatterene, and it can also shrug off attacks it normally can't, such as Meowscarada's Flower Trick and Dragapult's Draco Meteor. When running Great Tusk on sun teams, an alternate EV spread making Speed its highest stat can be considered due to Protosynthesis boosting Speed; this allows Great Tusk to outspeed otherwise faster Pokemon like Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo.</p> <p>Rotom-W, Skeledirge, and Torkoal make for good teammates, since their status spreading can help weaken foes and help Great Tusk wallbreak more efficiently. Rotom-W is able to paralyze faster Pokemon such as Iron Valiant and boosted Quaquaval, allowing Great Tusk to outspeed them. Skeledirge is able to spread burn, capitalize on foes afflicted with status with a boosted Hex, and check Iron Valiant sets lacking Shadow Ball. Lastly, Torkoal is able to force switches thanks to Yawn, spread status with Lava Plume, and set up sun to make Great Tusk an even scarier wallbreaker. Great Tusk appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Garganacl and Ting-Lu, since it can wallbreak more easily thanks to the chip damage they provide. Great Tusk is able to keep their hazards up in exchange while simultaneously removing hazards set by foes. Sweepers that are vulnerable to hazards like Iron Moth and Tera Flying Roaring Moon appreciate Great Tusk being able to remove hazards and beat walls such as Ting-Lu, allowing them to sweep more easily late-game. Lastly, other offensive Pokemon such as Kingambit and Dragonite make for good partners, since Great Tusk is able to weaken or cripple their common checks in Iron Valiant.</p> "

Knock Off provides item removal against defensive walls like Dondozo and Corviknight, as well as coverage against Air Balloon Gholdengo that would otherwise wall Great Tusk. Rapid Spin lets Great Tusk provide entry hazard removal for the team in games where it would not be able to win with Bulk Up, while allowing it to boost its Speed in games where it can sweep with Bulk Up. 52 Speed EVs allow Great Tusk to outspeed Garchomp after one Rapid Spin. Tera Water turns Great Tusk's Water and Ice weaknesses into resistances, allowing it to better take hits from Azumarill, Quaquaval, and Floatzel. On the other hand, Tera Steel lets Great Tusk take on Grass-type attacks such as Breloom's Bullet Seed and Meowscarada's Flower Trick, Flying-type attacks like Roaring Moon's Acrobatics, and if need be, Fairy-type attacks such as Iron Valiant's Moonblast.</p> <p>Bulk Up Great Tusk appreciates specially defensive teammates like Toxapex and Garganacl that can help play around fast special attackers such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Choice Specs Dragapult. In return, Garganacl and Toxapex appreciate the presence of a Terastallized Great Tusk as they can get overwhelmed by Kingambit and Belly Drum Azumarill. Teammates such as Gholdengo, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult can help break through physically defensive Pokemon like Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Skeledirge that Bulk Up Great Tusk can struggle against.

Its defensive typing and high Speed make it a good answer to Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Walking Wake. Dazzling Gleam is this set's only attacking move, letting it hit Pokemon like Great Tusk, Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Iron Valiant and prevents it from being shut down by Taunt from Pokemon like Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and Greninja. Wish gives Scream Tail a recovery move while letting it heal teammates such as Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Hatterene that lack reliable recovery and are vulnerable to being overwhelmed by repeated hits. Protect synergizes well with Wish, making it much more reliable as a recovery move. Additionally, Protect scouts the intentions of Choice-locked Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Hisuian Zoroark. Encore prevents setup sweepers like Volcarona, Calm Mind Iron Valiant, and Bulk Up Great Tusk from using Scream Tail as a setup opportunity, letting Scream Tail's teammates switch in and take advantage of these threats. It can also be used to annoy passive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Dondozo. Tera Fairy gives Scream Tail better matchups against Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Hisuian Zoroark, with the former two being susceptible to being OHKOed by Dazzling Gleam. Alternatively, Tera Water lets Scream Tail maintain a solid defensive typing while also helping it check Walking Wake, Skeledirge, and Greninja. With a Timid nature, 152 Speed EVs let Scream Tail outspeed Hydreigon, while 236 Special Defense EVs ensure that Scream Tail gets a Special Defense boost with Protosynthesis under sun, letting it more easily take on threats such as Walking Wake and Iron Valiant. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 84 SpD / 172 Spe with a Calm nature lets Scream Tail outspeed unboosted Baxcalibur and Great Tusk and pass beefier Wishes.</p> <p>Scream Tail fits on many sun, balance, and stall teams thanks to its bulk, ability to pass Wish to teammates, and create momentum with Encore. Bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo make for good teammates, as they are able to check Greninja and Ceruledge, respectively. Moreover, Toxapex also checks Pokemon like Iron Moth and Glimmora as well as spread status, making Encore much more of a detriment to setup sweepers like Volcarona and Iron Valiant, while Dondozo blanket checks physically oriented Pokemon that can overwhelm Scream Tail, namely Dragon Dance Baxcalibur, Booster Energy Roaring Moon, and Ceruledge. Entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for excellent teammates, as a lack of hazards means that Scream Tail can accomplish feats such as surviving two Choice Specs Greninja Hydro Pumps from full HP. Additionally, Great Tusk appreciates Wish support in order to more consistently check Scream Tail answers such as Kingambit. Torkoal is a great teammate thanks to its sun activating Scream Tail's Protosynthesis. In addition, Torkoal very much appreciates Wish support in order to more consistently check Pokemon like Kingambit. Meanwhile, Scream Tail is able to sponge special attacks from the likes of Walking Wake. Under sun, Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Ceruledge, and Brute Bonnet appreciate Scream Tail facilitating their sweeps with its combination of Encore and Wish, keeping them healthy while leveraging setup opportunities for them. Hydreigon is another excellent offensive partner, checking Gholdengo and finding more opportunities to set up Substitute thanks to Scream Tail's Wish.</p> "

Stealth Rock and Spikes both provide invaluable entry hazard support for Sandy Shocks and its teammates to wear down counters, while Thunderbolt is a solid option to maintain an Electric-type STAB move without being forced to switch out, especially when it can immediately threaten a KO late-game on chipped targets like Slowking and Rotom-W. With 252 Speed EVs, even a Modest Sandy Shocks still crucially outpaces all variants of Great Tusk, Gholdengo, and Rotom-W; a Timid nature can be run instead to also outpace Hydreigon and Volcarona at the cost of some power. When it comes to the item slot, Heavy-Duty Boots is perhaps the most straightforward item for Sandy Shocks, as being a pivot, Sandy Shocks gaining an immunity to hazards, which allows it to come in and wreak havoc many more times per game. However, Expert Belt provides a much-appreciated power boost, especially when going Modest for extra damage, since Sandy Shocks's Electric + Ground + Fairy coverage hits nearly the entire metagame super effectively. In particular, it guarantees that Earth Power will always 2HKO Clodsire and guarantees the OHKO on bulky Kingambit.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks shines on momentum-based bulky offense teams, so other Pokemon that can maintain momentum such as Choice item Dragapult, Meowscarada, Slowking, Rotom-W, and Scizor, as well as Eject Button users like offensive Great Tusk are good teammates. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Meowscarada, Garchomp, and Great Tusk is also excellent, since the hazard chip will stack with the numerous switches forced by Sandy Shocks. Additional Stealth Rock users in particular are appreciated because they free Sandy Shocks's fourth moveslot up to run Spikes or Thunderbolt more freely. Meowscarada is an excellent choice with several of its sets, as its Knock Off removes the Heavy-Duty Boots that Sandy Shocks's switch-ins rely on to not get worn down by hazards, it can set hazards itself, its U-turn forms the potent VoltTurn combination with Sandy Shocks, and its Flower Trick is extremely threatening to the Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu that can tank Sandy Shocks's Volt Switch assault. If not running Heavy-Duty Boots, Sandy Shocks can be worn down itself by Spikes, minimizing its effectiveness, and so hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight form prurient teammates. Sandy Shocks's relative frailty and weakness-laden typing means that faster Pokemon like Meowscarada, Garchomp, Dragapult, Cinderace, and Walking Wake, as well as Choice Scarf users such as specific variants of Rotom-W and Gholdengo, can immediately force Sandy Shocks out, lest its meager bulk causes it to be unceremoniously OHKOed. Strong priority moves like Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Azumarill's Aqua Jet present similar issues. As such, additional, more defensive pivots such as the aforementioned Corviknight and Rotom-W serve double duty, as they can act as a buffer against these threats without completely ceding momentum. Baxcalibur has an excellent matchup against Grass- and Ground-types like Amoonguss and Ting-Lu that Sandy Shocks can struggle with, and it benefits from Sandy Shocks threatening out its answers like Corviknight and Dondozo; as such, it makes for a particularly good teammate.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Sandy Shocks's appeal comes from its high Special Attack and ability to come in at +1 Speed with Booster Energy to pressure common spinners, letting it be one of the best offensive entry hazard setters in the tier. With the lack of reliable Ground-resistant Pokemon, Earth Power becomes incredibly spammable, targeting opposing hazard setters like Glimmora, Garganacl, Iron Treads, Torkoal, and Iron Moth. Earth Power also deals massive damage to Great Tusk, limiting its spinning capabilities. Thunderbolt is an excellent second STAB move, as it targets Flying-types such as Corviknight, Pelipper, and Iron Jugulis, as well as heavily punishing Rotom-W. Thunderbolt also hits threatening Water-types, 2HKOing Azumarill, Dondozo, and Slowking while also OHKOing Greninja. Both of these STAB moves 2HKO Toxapex as well. Stealth Rock or Spikes are very useful on Sandy Shocks because it threatens out almost every entry hazard remover, namely Great Tusk, Torkoal, Corviknight, Cinderace, Glimmora, and Talonflame. Tera Fairy Tera Blast is the perfect coverage tool for Sandy Shocks because it targets threats that would normally wall it, such as Hydreigon and Meowscarada, and it can land surprise KOs on would-be switch-ins like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Roaring Moon while also 2HKOing Garchomp. The Fairy typing has great defensive utility as well, resisting priority moves such as Sucker Punch from Kingambit and Meowscarada and Mach Punch from Breloom.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks fits best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Its ability to immediately get up entry hazards and threaten other hazard setters is instrumental for the success of hyper offense, and not activating Glimmora's Toxic Debris in the hyper offense mirror match is very useful. On bulky offense teams, it can offer more flexibility, setting up hazards and pressuring opposing defensive cores. With its great Speed stat after a Protosynthesis boost, Sandy Shocks threatens offensive Pokemon that would otherwise outspeed it like Dragapult. It also forces damage on bulkier Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Rotom-W, so teammates such as Volcarona, Iron Moth, and Dragonite that appreciate these being weakened work best. Baxcalibur is also a great teammate, as it sets up on Rotom-W—which is annoying for Sandy Shocks—that lacks Thunder Wave. Ground-immune teammates like Dragonite and Rotom-W also help Sandy Shocks on bulky offense teams, switching into foes like Great Tusk. Opposing Meowscarada and Baxcalibur are problematic for this set, as they essentially force it to Terastallize, so teammates that can handle them like Kingambit and Iron Valiant are also very useful. Amoonguss can generally take advantage of Sandy Shocks too, threatening Spore on teammates, so Gholdengo is another great teammate; it also blocks Rapid Spin and Defog.</p> "

Alternatively, Stealth Rock can turn Iron Treads into a fast hazard setter that exerts offensive pressure. Knock Off provides utility in removing Leftovers from Dondozo, Rotom-W, and Corviknight. Rapid Spin provides the most utility, as it keeps entry hazards clear to better help its teammates switch in without fearing chip damage. Booster Energy allows Iron Treads to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, notably outspeeding fast threats such as +1 Dragonite, Dragapult, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, Meowscarada, and Iron Valiant. A Ground Tera Type is ideal to maximize Earthquake's damage output against Garganacl, Dragapult, Skeledirge, and Volcarona while removing its weakness to Fire. However, it can instead run Tera Flying for an immunity to Great Tusk's Headlong Rush and Dragonite's Earthquake, as well as a resistance to Breloom's Mach Punch and Great Tusk's Close Combat.</p> <p>Iron Treads fits well on offensive teams, taking the role of an offensive spinner and potential Stealth Rock user.

It faces stronger competition from its counterpart, Great Tusk, due to the latter's typing, better physical bulk, better Attack, and a wider movepool. However, Iron Treads stands out due to its faster Speed and its access to Volt Switch, which allows it to serve as a fast offensive pivot. With Stealth Rock, Iron Treads can wear down Pokemon that dislike entry hazards like Dragapult, Roaring Moon, and Booster Energy Iron Moth, limiting their opportunities to switch in. Rapid Spin allows Iron Treads to remove hazards from its side while also boosting its Speed, allowing it to threaten Pokemon that would normally outspeed it like Cinderace. Volt Switch not only allows Iron Treads to perform as a pivot but also deals super effective damage to Flying-types like Corviknight and Tera Flying Kingambit. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used to remove important items such as Leftovers from defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Corviknight, and Garganacl as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon vulnerable to hazards such as Dragonite and Skeledirge. Knock Off also allows Iron Treads to deal super effective damage to Air Balloon Gholdengo. Tera Flying completely removes Iron Treads's weakness to Ground-types and turns it into an immunity, allowing it to switch into Great Tusk. Leftovers grants Iron Treads a form of longevity so it can find more opportunities to pivot into teammates. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used as well to help Iron Treads pivot more consistently into teammates while not getting worn down from hazards.</p> <p>Iron Treads fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its offensive utility in order for their team members to function in their roles more effectively. Wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant and Iron Moth pair well with Iron Treads, since they appreciate being brought in by Volt Switch. In return, they can take on defensive Pokemon Iron Treads struggles with, such as Ting-Lu for the former and Amoonguss for the latter. Garchomp, Meowscarada, and Greninja make for great partners, since the three of them can stack Spikes with Iron Treads to wear down incoming foes into KO range from one of the team's offensive Pokemon. If Iron Treads is running Volt Switch, it could have a hard time pivoting into its teammates, since Ground-types like Great Tusk and Garchomp can switch into it if its predicted. Hence, teammates that can handle Ground-types like Rotom-W pair well with Iron Treads. Lastly, sweepers such as Baxcalibur, Walking Wake, Dragonite, and Azumarill appreciate Iron Treads bringing them to sweep. Baxcalibur, Walking Wake, and Azumarill in particular can help in removing Ground-types that can interrupt Iron Treads's pivoting ability.</p> "

Hurricane destroys many offensive Pokemon that can take Dark Pulse, including Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Quaquaval, and Volcarona. Taunt allows Iron Jugulis to function as a dangerous stallbreaker by shutting down passive walls such as Clodsire, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu. It also prevents Slowking from pivoting with Chilly Reception and threats such as Dragonite, Volcarona, Polteageist, and Roaring Moon from setting up. Flamethrower hits Steel-types such as Corviknight, Kingambit, and Iron Treads. Fire Blast trades some of Flamethrower's accuracy for more power, most notably OHKOing the aforementioned Steel-types with Tera Fire. Alternatively, Earth Power OHKOes Iron Moth and lands a stronger hit on Clodsire, Garganacl, Cinderace, Iron Hands, and Toxapex. Tera Dark boosts the power of Dark Pulse, making it easier to pressure walls such as Garganacl, Rotom-W, and Toxapex with its flinch chance. Tera Flying strengthens Hurricane, OHKOing Greninja, Amoonguss, and Cinderace most of the time and 2HKOing Toxapex, Dondozo, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge.

Additionally, Iron Jugulis's Stealth Rock weakness makes entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads very valuable partners; they can also pressure Clodsire and Iron Moth to free up Iron Jugulis to run a Fire-type move. Powerful wallbreakers such as Breloom, Dragapult, and Baxcalibur can soften up the opposing team for Iron Jugulis to clean up late-game. Conversely, Iron Jugulis's ability to break through special walls with Taunt opens up other special sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Iron Moth. Gholdengo can also cripple walls with Choice item + Trick and handle Booster Energy Iron Valiant, one of the only threats capable of outspeeding and threatening Iron Jugulis. Iron Jugulis is also effective on rain teams, providing it with a perfectly-accurate Hurricane and featuring extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Floatzel and Walking Wake that can punch holes for it to sweep late-game. In return, Iron Jugulis threatens Amoonguss and provides a valuable Ghost resistance to take on threats such as Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark more easily.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Gholdengo utilizes everything that makes it so threatening: its fantastic ability, typing, movepool, and stats, maximizing its potential as a wallbreaker. By running its two strongest STAB moves along with Nasty Plot and Recover, Gholdengo takes advantage of both its offensive and defensive capabilities. Covert Cloak is most useful to block the residual damage from Garganacl's Salt Cure, while Heavy-Duty Boots negates the chip damage Gholdengo would take from switching into Spikes and Stealth Rock. Tera Fighting is the best choice defensively, removing the threat of a super effective hit from Dragapult or opposing Gholdengo's Shadow Ball, resisting Dark-type moves from Kingambit, Hydreigon, and Roaring Moon, and lessening the chip damage from Salt Cure if running Heavy-Duty Boots. Tera Steel preserves Steel-type's defensive qualities while boosting its Make It Rain.</p> <p>As a wallbreaker, Gholdengo is most useful on balance and bulky offense teams. It benefits from entry hazards significantly to help chip down opposing Pokemon, making entry hazard setters like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu great teammates; in return, Gholdengo is able to keep their entry hazards up by blocking Defog with Good as Gold. In addition, Pokemon like offensive Great Tusk, Iron Moth, and Dragonite appreciate entry hazards staying up, and they'll return the favor by checking other threats, like Great Tusk checking Kingambit. Physical attackers like Choice Band Dragapult, Cinderace, and Roaring Moon help cover Gholdengo's weakness to specially defensive Pokemon like Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire. Ting-Lu in particular can be tough to break through; having a dedicated check like Choice Band Baxcalibur is helpful. Gholdengo can cover for some of their weaknesses as well, breaking through walls like Toxapex and Garganacl and switching into status from Rotom-W. Faster Pokemon, such as Cinderace, Volcarona, and Dragapult, as well as revenge killers like Kingambit prevent Gholdengo from setting up and can quickly KO it; having defensive teammates like Clodsire, Dondozo, and Garganacl to take some of the heat off is extremely useful. Assault Vest Azumarill is a strong specially defensive option to help Gholdengo deal with Walking Wake.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Gholdengo utilizes its high Special Attack and its great offensive typing to become a fast revenge killer. Gholdengo can effectively hit offensive threats such as Dragapult and Iron Valiant with its STAB moves. Trick allows Gholdengo to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Dondozo, Corviknight, and Clodsire. Its typing also allows it to switch into foes such as Iron Valiant and Iron Hands in a pinch, as it either resists or is immune to most of their attacks. Focus Blast is ideal for Gholdengo to hit Kingambit and other foes such as a weakened Ting-Lu, but Nasty Plot can be run instead to take advantage of stopping defensive Pokemon with Trick and having a free turn to set up and do a great amount of damage. Recover can also be run, taking a more defensive approach to give Gholdengo a free turn to heal. Gholdengo prefers Fighting as a Tera type, as it removes its prior weaknesses, meaning it is not threatened by Kingambit's Sucker Punch or Skeledirge's Torch Song. It also boosts the power of Focus Blast, reliably removing the former. To counter different foes, Gholdengo can instead opt for Tera Flying to have better ground against Great Tusk and Iron Treads.</p> <p>Teammates such as Kingambit and Iron Valiant appreciate Gholdengo's offensive pressure, as it can help against shared checks such as Great Tusk and Amoonguss. With this role, Gholdengo prefers to have a clean switch after a teammate has fainted in order to pressure the opponent. Similarly, entry hazard setters such as Garchomp, Garganacl, and Ting-Lu appreciate Gholdengo for its Good as Gold ability and its Ghost typing, preventing all forms of hazard removal excluding Court Change. Gholdengo is mainly vulnerable to priority moves such as Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Dragonite also presents an issue for it with Multiscale in conjunction with Earthquake, not to mention it can set up twice in front of Gholdengo. This can be avoided with a carefully timed Trick or help from defensive Great Tusk and Skeledirge. Similarly, depending on its Choice lock, Roaring Moon and Cinderace can take advantage of Gholdengo with Crunch and Sucker Punch, respectively. As a result of this, Garchomp and Garganacl pair well with Gholdengo, acting as a defensive backbone with type advantage and great bulk. Iron Valiant can be a great revenge killer against these threats with great Speed and coverage.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Gholdengo is an excellent wallbreaker thanks to its great typing, high damage output, and good utility movepool. Make It Rain is Gholdengo's strongest viable attack, OHKOing Pokemon like Garganacl, Hisuian Zoroark, Great Tusk, and Scream Tail. Shadow Ball offers great coverage, hitting foes that resist Make It Rain such as Toxapex, Corviknight, Rotom-W, Slowking, Skeledirge, and opposing Gholdengo. Focus Blast offers crucial coverage against Kingambit, which resists both of Gholdengo's STAB moves. Recover, on the other hand, can keep Gholdengo healthy throughout the game, and it can be freely used once Gholdengo lands Trick and loses its Choice Specs. Trick allows Gholdengo to cripple special walls like Clodsire with a Choice lock, consequently making them much easier to wear down or pivot around throughout the game. A Timid nature lets Gholdengo outspeed Dragonite and, at worst, Speed tie with opposing Gholdengo. Tera Fighting has excellent synergy with Gholdengo's Ghost typing, turning its weakness to Dark-type attacks like Kingambit's Sucker Punch into a resistance, and the STAB boost to Focus Blast greatly helps in dealing with Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon, which can otherwise check Gholdengo if they remain healthy. Tera Steel is a valid alternative that dramatically powers up Make it Rain—which becomes so ludicrously strong, it even 2HKOes Clodsire—while preserving the Steel type's great defensive profile. Also, keeping Steel while removing Gholdengo's Ghost and Dark weaknesses can prove useful against Dragapult, Meowscarada, and opposing Gholdengo.</p> <p>Choice Specs Gholdengo's immediate power and valuable defensive utility give it a solid place on an array of bulkier offensive teams, punching holes for an array of sweepers later in the game, and these teams' stronger defensive backbones give Gholdengo more opportunities to come in and hit hard. Ting-Lu can sponge Ghost- and Dark-type attacks, like Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave and Shadow Ball from Dragapult, Hisuian Zoroark, and opposing Gholdengo. It can also force progress with entry hazard damage alongside Whirlwind, giving Gholdengo an easier time breaking past teams' defensive cores. In return, Gholdengo can block Rapid Spin and Defog to ensure that Ting-Lu's entry hazards remain active, and it handles threats like Breloom and Iron Valiant, which Ting-Lu struggles against. Other hazard setters like Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Glimmora similarly appreciate Gholdengo's blocking of all forms of hazard removal. Roaring Moon also has great synergy with Gholdengo, which can deal with attacks like Iron Valiant's Moonblast and Close Combat, Hatterene's Dazzling Gleam, Baxcalibur's STAB moves, and Great Tusk's Close Combat and Ice Spinner, while Roaring Moon can handle Fire-type attacks from Volcarona and Iron Moth. Choice Specs Gholdengo's high immediate power puts a great deal of pressure on physically bulky foes like Garganacl, Skeledirge, and Dondozo, which can open up opportunities for Roaring Moon to sweep unimpaired. Swords Dance Iron Valiant can handle Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, and Dragapult for Gholdengo, while Gholdengo can wear down or eliminate Unaware Skeledirge and Dondozo to let Iron Valiant sweep. Faster Ghost-types like Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark pair well with Gholdengo, as they can wear down and eventually overwhelm their shared checks, like Ting-Lu and Assault Vest Azumarill, with their solid coverage. Hisuian Zoroark in particular is an excellent teammate: it shares Gholdengo's access to Shadow Ball, Focus Blast, and Nasty Plot to bluff numerous Gholdengo sets with Illusion, provides a crucial Ghost immunity to deter opposing Ghost-type attacks, and has a much better Speed stat to catch opponents off-guard. For facing Dragapult, Hisuian Zoroark is immune to Ghost while Gholdengo resists Dragon, and both can OHKO Dragapult if it incorrectly predicts which Pokemon it's facing.</p> "

        "name": "Air Balloon",
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its great typing and Good as Gold, Gholdengo is a setup sweeper that's notably difficult to deal with. Having an additional Ground immunity with Air Balloon further improves Gholdengo's already great typing, letting it switch in on Pokemon that otherwise threaten it, such as Garchomp and Iron Treads. This is especially useful against the latter, as Air Balloon strengthens Gholdengo's ability to block entry hazard removal. Maximum Speed investment is for outspeeding Dragonite and uninvested Great Tusk. 252 Special Attack EVs and Nasty Plot makes Gholdengo's STAB moves very threatening against neutral foes. Fighting and Dark Tera types give Gholdengo the option to Terastallize defensively; notably, Tera Fighting lessens the impact of moves like Crunch from Roaring Moon. Tera Dark is useful in a pinch to resist attacks such as Shadow Ball from Dragapult and opposing Gholdengo.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters like Great Tusk and Glimmora are the most profitable teammates for Gholdengo, as its ability and typing ensure that their entry hazards stay around as long as Gholdengo does. Hyper offense staples such as Iron Valiant benefit greatly from the constant presence of entry hazards to break down bulkier cores; in return, Gholdengo gets teammates that synergize with its role as a wallbreaker, applying heavy pressure throughout a game to Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Rotom-W. Offensive Pokemon that outspeed and OHKO Gholdengo, such as Cinderace, Roaring Moon, and Knock Off variants of Great Tusk, threaten to completely shut down Gholdengo; defensive teammates like Garganacl, Dondozo and Skeledirge can help mitigate some of these weaknesses.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Gholdengo can utilize its natural bulk, great typing, and immunity to status moves for a more defensive role on balance and stall teams. It can switch into several key offensive threats such as Iron Valiant, Scizor and Breloom and completely shut down multiple defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Corviknight. With Good as Gold, Gholdengo can act as a reliable means of spinblocking and denying Defog. Recover provides Gholdengo with a means of improving its longevity, letting it switch into the aforementioned threats multiple times throughout a match. Thunder Wave allows Gholdengo to cripple threats it can lure in, like Iron Moth and Roaring Moon. Gholdengo can capitalize on the status it spreads with Hex, letting it deal high damage once its targets have been paralyzed. Gholdengo can take advantage of switches it forces by setting up Nasty Plot, letting it exert a high offensive threat level, and enabling it to win potential stalemates against bulkier Pokemon such as Corviknight and Dondozo. Alternatively, Make It Rain can be used to immediately KO Garganacl and Iron Valiant. Tera Flying improves Gholdengo's matchups against Ground-types like Great Tusk and Iron Treads. This completely flips the matchup in Gholdengo's favor, as it can use them as a point of entry to set up Nasty Plot. Tera Fairy, on the other hand, grants Gholdengo a resistance to Dark-type attacks, allowing it to survive Crunch from Roaring Moon and paralyze it with Thunder Wave. Gholdengo's item choice is quite flexible and largely depends on its team structure. Leftovers offers passive recovery, which is quite valuable to preserve Recover PP. Covert Cloak grants Gholdengo an immunity to the secondary effects of various moves, allowing it to counter Garganacl by nullifying the chip damage from Salt Cure. It is also useful to allow Gholdengo to switch into a wider pool of moves, like Hatterene's Nuzzle, with far less risk. Heavy-Duty Boots nullifies entry hazard damage, allowing Gholdengo to switch in and out with little issue. A physically defensive EV spread allows Gholdengo to more reliably check Pokemon such as Garganacl, Corviknight, and Scizor.</p> <p>Defensive Gholdengo fits on a variety of teams, but it particularly shines on balance and stall teams. Its ability to nullify most forms of hazard control is most useful to entry hazard setters such as Garchomp, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. These Pokemon also appreciate Gholdengo's ability to check Hatterene, which can bounce back hazards with Magic Bounce. If Gholdengo is utilizing Covert Cloak, it will be a great teammate to Pokemon like Dondozo, Toxapex, and Corviknight, which struggle against Garganacl due to Salt Cure. Gholdengo can pivot into many key status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and is therefore a great ally to Pokemon that are common targets of them, such as Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Meowscarada. When not running Tera Flying, Ground-types like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire can use Gholdengo as an entry point to either deal high damage to it with Earthquake or set up entry hazards. Corviknight is thus a great partner, as it can switch into them with ease and clear entry hazards they may set up with Defog. Hatterene is another good teammate, since it can completely shut down attempts to set up entry hazards with Magic Bounce. Gholdengo is also quite vulnerable to a few other offensive threats, such as Volcarona, Cinderace, and Kingambit, so bulky Water-types like Dondozo and Toxpaex can switch into these Pokemon and prevent setup via Unaware and Haze, respectively, which Gholdengo will greatly appreciate. Garchomp and Great Tusk can switch into Cinderace and Kingambit and threaten them out with Earthquake, and they can also benefit from Gholdengo's Thunder Wave support, allowing them to more reliably check Cinderace and Iron Moth.</p> "

It also has a great typing that lets it answer threats such as Gholdengo, Choice Specs Dragapult, Iron Moth, and Ceruledge. Whirlwind is incredibly useful for thwarting setup Pokemon like Roaring Moon and Volcarona. Ruination lets Ting-Lu deal consistent damage to bulky Pokemon like Corviknight, Rotom-W, and Hatterene. Rest is an option on bulkier structures like stall teams to give Ting-Lu much-needed recovery. Tera Poison lets Ting-Lu act as an answer to Iron Valiant while giving it an immunity to poison damage from Clodsire’s Toxic and letting it absorb Toxic Spikes from the likes of Glimmora and Iron Moth. Meanwhile, Tera Fairy is a generally solid defensive typing, letting it more reliably check Pokemon such as Dragapult and Great Tusk. Aside from granting a Fighting immunity, Tera Ghost allows Ting-Lu to spinblock foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads, which is especially important if running both entry hazards. If so, Heavy Slam should be used over Earthquake to threaten Hatterene better, which would otherwise block them due to Magic Bounce. Red Card is an alternative over Leftovers on more offensive teams that can forgo the recovery; Ting-Lu's astronomical overall bulk allows it to take a single strong hit in a pinch—even super effective attacks such as from Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and Calm Mind Iron Valiant—and phaze them, preventing its team from being swept by opposing offensive threats.</p> <p>Ting-Lu’s premier defensive profile makes it most proficient on bulky offense and balance teams that can supply enough offensive momentum to make up for Ting-Lu’s relative passivity. Pokemon that can supplement offensive prowess to make up for Ting-Lu's passivity such as Iron Valiant and Kingambit make for excellent partners, as they can assist against threats like opposing Iron Valiant, Dondozo, and Great Tusk. Without Ruination, Ting-Lu is utterly helpless against Corviknight, so Pokemon that can threaten it such as Gholdengo and Cinderace make for excellent partners. Bulky Water-types like Dondozo and Toxapex appreciate Ting-Lu's immunity to Electric while being quite helpful against Pokemon like Kingambit and Quaquaval in return. Other defensive Pokemon like Garganacl and Corviknight also make for excellent partners, being helpful against Pokemon like Scizor while appreciating Ting-Lu’s ability to check Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult. Additional entry hazard setters such as Garganacl and Great Tusk allow Ting-Lu to fit Ruination into its moveset more capably, so it is less passive in the face of Ground-immune threats like Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo.</p> "

Roost, on the other hand, gives Roaring Moon access to reliable recovery, which gives it more setup opportunities throughout the game even if its Booster Energy is already used up. Acrobatics has fantastic coverage, as it hits Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Breloom super effectively and should always be run alongside Tera Flying to maximize its power. Since Acrobatics + Earthquake hits most of the metagame at least neutrally, Crunch can be dropped in favor of Taunt to shut down common defensive foes, most notably Corviknight and Rotom-W that would otherwise resist the aforementioned move combination. However, this makes Roaring Moon very reliant on Terastallization due to the lack of reliable STAB moves. Iron Head is a viable alternative to Acrobatics and should always be run alongside Tera Steel, as it deals with Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Hatterene simultaneously. Tera Flying removes all of Roaring Moon's baseline weaknesses bar Ice, gives it a resistance to Fighting- and Bug-type attacks, a Ground immunity, and a STAB boost to Acrobatics. Tera Steel, though more niche, allows Roaring Moon to resist Hatterene's Dazzling Gleam, Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Tera Normal Dragonite's Extreme Speed. A Jolly nature is typically run to outspeed Booster Energy Iron Valiant after a Dragon Dance, but Adamant is a decent alternative, particularly on teams that allow Roaring Moon to obtain more than one Dragon Dance boost.

Dondozo and Tera Fairy Skeledirge are major threats to Roaring Moon due to their ability to ignore its boosts with Unaware, while strong priority users like Dragonite and Breloom can revenge kill Roaring Moon thanks to its low Defense. Ting-Lu can force Roaring Moon out with Whirlwind, and Choice Band Iron Hands survives a boosted Earthquake from full health and can OHKO Roaring Moon with Close Combat.

Iron Moth has strong offensive synergy with Iron Valiant, being able to threaten Amoonguss, Iron Treads, and Tera Fairy Garganacl, while also being able to chip down special walls like Clodsire. On offense teams, Iron Valiant complements powerful wallbreakers like Nasty Plot Gholdengo, and Kingambit, since they can overwhelm defensive cores and open up the path for Iron Valiant to sweep. Finally, Iron Valiant is highly reliant on Booster Energy to sweep, as it cannot normally outspeed common revenge-killers like Dragapult, Cinderace, and Meowscarada. Therefore, it is important to time when to switch in to Iron Valiant to ensure defensive counters like Skeledirge are either removed or heavily damaged so it can sweep or break through the opposing team effectively. Along these lines, it is important to conserve Iron Valiant's health, since it can survive key priority moves such as Extreme Speed from Tera Normal Dragonite after a Dragon Dance. Therefore, Pokemon that can remove entry hazards, such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads, are great teammates for Iron Valiant.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With its high Attack and Special Attack, as well as blazing Speed augmented by Choice Scarf, Iron Valiant becomes an outstanding mixed revenge killer. Choice Scarf allows Iron Valiant to outspeed faster Pokemon such as Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, Dragapult, and Greninja and threaten an OHKO with Moonblast. Close Combat targets Steel-types such as Kingambit and Iron Treads. Knock Off hits Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Iron Moth for super effective damage while also crippling other Pokemon that resist both of its STAB moves such as Iron Moth and Moltres. Trick can be used to cripple walls such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Clodsire. Maximum Special Attack allows Iron Valiant's Moonblast to OHKO Great Tusk and Walking Wake. Tera Fairy powers up Moonblast, letting it secure OHKOs against Garchomp and Baxcalibur. Alternatively, Tera Ghost makes it easier for Iron Valiant to revenge kill Dragonite thanks to its immunity to Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Iron Valiant can be found on bulky offense teams that appreciate the speed it provides. It can take advantage of Slowking's Future Sight, as Steel- and Dark-types that resist or are immune to it are threatened by Close Combat, while Future Sight hits Iron Valiant's switch-ins such as Amoonguss and Toxapex for super effective damage. Pokemon weak to Dark-type attacks such as Skeledirge, Dragapult, and Gholdengo appreciate Iron Valiant's resistance to said attacks, particularly Sucker Punch from Kingambit, and ability to threaten said Dark-types with either one of its STAB moves. Great Tusk provides entry hazard removal, preventing Iron Valiant from getting chipped throughout the game, and complements Iron Valiant to make for a sturdy duo against Kingambit, which often times Terastallizes to deal with either one of them but has a harder time dealing with both. Corviknight in particular resists all of the attacks that Iron Valiant is weak to, while other walls such as Skeledirge and Clodsire can sponge Fairy- and Poison-type hits.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Iron Valiant makes use of its high offensive stats and Swords Dance to become a formidable physical wallbreaker that can also clean up late-game thanks to its Quark Drive-boosted Speed tier, threatening out metagame staples like Kingambit, Garganacl, and Baxcalibur for setup opportunities. Liquidation is a crucial coverage move to hit most of its would-be checks such as Iron Moth, Skeledirge, and Unaware Clodsire. It is also a strong neutral attack against Gholdengo and Hatterene, as well as hitting defensive Great Tusk super effectively. Both Knock Off and Spirit Break help Iron Valiant in hitting Dragapult; Knock Off also provides great neutral coverage against Toxapex and Amoonguss, crippling them as well as other bulky foes such as Dondozo and Tera Fairy Garganacl, while Spirit Break covers Dragonite, Azumarill, and Tera Dragon Dondozo. Taunt prevents the recovery, status, Haze, and Defense-boosting attempts of defensive stalwarts such as Toxapex, Dondozo, Tera Water Skeledirge, and Tera Fairy Garganacl, letting Iron Valiant muscle past them much more easily. Tera Water is mainly used to amplify Iron Valiant's Liquidation, notably netting the OHKO on Gholdengo at +2 as well as 2HKO on Skeledirge, the latter of which would otherwise ignore Iron Valiant's Swords Dance boost with Unaware. Defensively, the Water typing helps Taunt variants beat Toxapex and Skeledirge one-on-one due to resisting their Surf and Torch Song, allows Iron Valiant to set up on Gholdengo's Make it Rain, and prevents it from being revenge killed by Scizor's Bullet Punch, Baxcalibur's Ice Shard, and Azumarill's Aqua Jet easily.</p> <p>Swords Dance Iron Valiant finds a place on offense and hyper offense teams. Support from Grimmsnarl's dual screens and Orthworm's Shed Tail grants Iron Valiant more setup opportunities and prevents revenge killing attempts from Pokemon like Choice Band Dragonite and Scizor; Shed Tail in particular lets it set up on walls like Garganacl and Skeledirge, avoiding Salt Cure's periodic chip and Will-O-Wisp. Entry hazards from Glimmora, Garchomp, Meowscarada, and the aforementioned Orthworm can chip down foes like Amoonguss, Toxapex, and Dondozo, letting Iron Valiant break past them more easily, especially if complemented by Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from them and other Pokemon like Clodsire and Tera Water Skeledirge; moreover, Garchomp helps in threatening Toxapex, while Meowscarada does the same to Dondozo. Other setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Kingambit, and Agility Walking Wake are great teammates to keep up the offensive pressure against the opposition, especially as they appreciate Iron Valiant crippling Toxapex with Knock Off as well as luring in and beating Clodsire and Skeledirge for them. Early-game wallbreakers such as Choice Band Baxcalibur and Choice Specs Greninja are similarly important to punch holes in the opposition, notably pressuring foes like Amoonguss and Dondozo that Iron Valiant has trouble breaking through.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Walking Wake is a powerful wallbreaker thanks to its great Special Attack and Speed alongside an excellent typing complemented by decent bulk, fantastic STAB moves, and good coverage. Hydro Steam is Walking Wake's excellent signature move; in addition to having zero drawbacks its power is increased with sun active, making safely switching into Walking Wake a difficult task. Flamethrower hits Grass-types like Amoonguss, and Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Corviknight for super effective damage. Draco Meteor is Walking Wake's strongest attack and eliminates Dragapult, Dragonite, opposing Walking Wake, and Roaring Moon while dealing high damage to Water-types like Toxapex and muscling past Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Dondozo. Dragon Pulse is a weaker but safer move that still hits opposing Dragon-types hard and lacks drawbacks, which makes it more useful late-game when Draco Meteor's higher damage output is no longer needed to secure KOs. Tera Water removes Walking Wake's Fairy weakness while increasing Hydro Steam's damage output to nuclear levels, allowing it to outright 2HKO moderately bulky Water-resistant Pokemon like Baxcalibur and Rotom-W. Tera Dragon turns Walking Wake's Grass neutrality into a resistance while allowing it to 2HKO Clodsire and Slowking, allowing Walking Wake to blow past its checks and more reliably sweep late-game. 244 Special Attack EVs put Walking Wake's Special Attack exactly one point lower than its Speed, causing Protosynthesis to increase Speed and drastically improve Walking Wake's matchup against otherwise-faster threats like Meowscarada, Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Roaring Moon; however, 252 Special Attack EVs to allow a Special Attack boost from Protosynthesis is still perfectly viable to further capitalize on Walking Wake's wallbreaking prowess, albeit at the cost of now losing the one-on-one matchup against the aforementioned faster threats. Even Assault Vest Azumarill, which otherwise checks Walking Wake, has a chance of being 2HKOed by a sun-boosted Tera Water Hydro Steam with a Special Attack boost.</p> <p>Though its offensive presence is useful in general, Walking Wake's unique attributes make it most powerful on and against sun teams. Torkoal is an excellent partner for Walking Wake, as its ability to set sun with Drought maximizes its damage output with Hydro Steam and Flamethrower and enables its Protosynthesis to boost its Speed or Special Attack. Torkoal can also set Stealth Rock to allow Walking Wake to more reliably 2HKO threats like Clodsire and Toxapex and remove opposing Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin, and it appreciates Walking Wake’s ability to break past opposing weather setters like Tyranitar and Pelipper with ease. Specially defensive walls like Slowking and Water Absorb Clodsire give Walking Wake a lot of trouble, since they can sponge its attacks. Powerful physical attackers like offensive Great Tusk and Choice Band Roaring Moon are excellent teammates due to their ability to muscle past these threats; in return, Walking Wake breaks past their own defensive checks such as Ting-Lu, Dondozo, and Corviknight. Moreover, both of these teammates can also utilize Protosynthesis effectively. Assault Vest Azumarill resists both Hydro Steam and Flamethrower, is immune to Walking Wake's Dragon-type attacks, and threatens to OHKO it with Play Rough, though it can be worn down over time due to its lack of recovery. Offensive Grass-types like Meowscarada and Breloom cannot switch into Azumarill, but they can greatly threaten it with their super effective STAB moves. Eject Button Amoonguss is another excellent teammate, as it checks Azumarill both offensively and defensively and can safely pivot Walking Wake in. In return, Walking Wake can handle bulky Steel-types like Kingambit and Corviknight for Meowscarada and Gholdengo for Breloom and Amoonguss.</p> "

        "name": "Agility",
        "description": "<p>With Agility, Walking Wake becomes a terrifying sweeper on offense teams. After a single boost, not only can it outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, but also boosted Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, Volcarona, and Roaring Moon. Its STAB combination threatens metagame staples like Great Tusk, Dragapult, Roaring Moon, Garganacl, and Volcarona. Hydro Steam is preferred over Surf if Walking Wake is used on sun teams. With Flamethrower as coverage, it can also threaten the likes of Gholdengo, Amoonguss, and Corviknight harder. Substitute is an option to protect Walking Wake from revenge killing attempts like Kingambit's Sucker Punch and status moves like Amoonguss's Spore. Tera Water makes Hydro Steam and Surf a nuke, especially on the respective weather teams. Tera Dragon boosts Dragon Pulse, allowing Walking Wake to 2HKO specially defensive Rotom-W. Tera Fairy turns Walking Wake's Dragon weakness into an immunity, improving its matchup against various Dragon-types like Choice Band Roaring Moon and Dragapult, and gives it a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Breloom's Mach Punch.</p> <p>Walking Wake best functions on hyper offense, sun, and rain teams. In order to sweep more efficiently, it appreciates entry hazards from Greninja, Meowscarada, and Glimmora. In return, Walking Wake can threaten common hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight. On weather teams, Torkoal and Pelipper make for necessary teammates, as they can set up sun and rain to boost its Hydro Steam. Sun from Torkoal in particular allows Walking Wake to activate Protosynthesis multiple times and boost its Flamethrower. Walking Wake gets forced out by specially defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Toxapex; hence, wallbreakers that can wear them down such as Breloom, Meowscarada, and Choice Specs Dragapult are appreciated. Great Tusk is another good teammate, as it can remove entry hazards for Walking Wake to switch in without getting worn down. In return, Walking Wake can threaten spinblockers like Gholdengo and Hisuian Zoroark after an Agility. Lastly, Walking Wake pairs well with other sweepers like Iron Moth and Kingambit, as they can pressure each other's checks; Walking Wake can deal with Great Tusk for Kingambit and Garganacl and Ting-Lu for Iron Moth. In return, Kingambit can threaten Toxapex, while Iron Moth can threaten Hatterene.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<p>Walking Wake finds a lot of opportunities to set up a Substitute against defensive Pokemon that don't threaten to break it like Dondozo, Slowking, and non-Assault Vest Toxapex as well as on switches that it forces by threatening meta staples like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Hydreigon. Substitute relieves the need for prediction, protects Walking Wake from revenge killing attempts, and allows it to avoid residual damage from Garganacl's Salt Cure. Hydro Steam's power boost in sun makes it desirable both on and against sun teams. If this attribute is not sought after, then Hydro Pump can be run instead. Roar prevents Pokemon like Terastallized Volcarona and Garganacl as well as Belly Drum Azumarill from setting up on Walking Wake. It is also a good way for Walking Wake to make progress via residual entry hazard damage even when the opposition has a counter like Water Absorb Clodsire, Assault Vest Toxapex, or specially defensive Dondozo. However, Flamethrower can be used instead to round out Walking Wake's coverage, doing more damage to Pokemon like Kingambit, Amoonguss, and Corviknight. Flamethrower also gains a boost in power from sun, which alongside the Protosynthesis boost can allow Flamethrower to OHKO the aforementioned targets. Tera Water increases the damage output of its Water-type STAB move, potentially 2HKOing Pokemon like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Corviknight. Tera Dragon powers up Dragon Pulse, allowing it to OHKO Garchomp, Baxcalibur, and Hydreigon. Finally, Tera Fairy removes Walking Wake's original weaknesses, allowing for surprise KOs on Dragon-types like opposing Walking Wake and especially Dragapult—a thorn in Walking Wake's side because of Infilitrator nullifying Substitute—as well as others like Kingambit and Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Walking Wake is a sun team staple, so of course it is often paired with other sun team staples like Torkoal and Eject Button Hatterene. Torkoal sets sun with Drought, which gives Walking Wake a boost to its Special Attack and makes it an even more threatening wallbreaker. Torkoal is also good at forcing switches with Yawn, which gives Walking Wake opportunities to come in. Hatterene also provides a switch-in opportunity thanks to Eject Button, and it can also regenerate Walking Wake with Healing Wish, giving it more chances to wallbreak. Both can prevent irksome entry hazards either via Rapid Spin or Magic Bounce, a valuable attribute, as damage inflicted by hazards, most notably Toxic Spikes, limits Walking Wake's wallbreaking potential. Because Dragapult is such an issue for this set, Pokemon that can take advantage of it like Kingambit, Iron Valiant, and Ting-Lu are good partners for Walking Wake. Walking Wake has numerous roadblocks that stop it from making much progress like Water Absorb Clodsire, Assault Vest Toxapex, and Slowking; additional wallbreakers like Great Tusk, Roaring Moon, and mixed Garchomp to smash through them are appreciated. Hazard setters like the aforementioned Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Torkoal are indispensable as allies, for their hazards wear down checks and punish forced switches, be it through threatening the opposition or by phazing via Roar.</p> "
