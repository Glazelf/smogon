It is also one of the few viable Defoggers, allowing it to partner up with teammates like Dragonite, Chien-Pao, and Volcarona that loathe Stealth Rock. Be warned, Corviknight is utterly unable to Defog against Gholdengo, so secondary entry hazard removal like Great Tusk and a reliable switch-in like Ting-Lu are recommended. Corviknight is unable to handle powerful physical Fire-types like Cinderace and Ceruledge and Electric-types like Iron Hands. Teammates that can cover these weaknesses like Dondozo and Great Tusk are wonderful partners. Its middling special bulk makes teammates like Slowking and Ting-Lu valuable. Slowking has the added benefit of being another slow pivot as well, while Ting-Lu forms a strong entry hazard core with Corviknight and threatens Gholdengo.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Possessing OU's highest unboosted Speed tier makes Choice Specs Dragapult a very remarkable special wallbreaker, revenge killer, and offensive pivot. It outspeeds and threatens common offensive threats like Cinderace, Iron Moth, and even boosted foes like Choice Scarf Rotom-W and Adamant Dragonite after a Dragon Dance. Moreover, it's immune or resistant to common priority attacks like the aforementioned Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Breloom's Mach Punch, and Slither Wing's First Impression, which makes it much harder to revenge kill. A coverage move in either Flamethrower or Thunder lets Dragapult nail Corviknight, with the former also hitting other Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads, while the latter pressures Toxapex and Tera Water Garganacl. Infiltrator allows Dragapult to bypass Grimmsnarl's dual screens, Orthworm's Shed Tail, and Substitute users like Gholdengo, which gives it an edge against hyper offense teams. Tera Ghost maintains an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and strengthens Shadow Ball—its most spammable attack—notably guaranteeing the 2HKO on Corviknight and Assault Vest Iron Treads after Terastallizing. Tera Fairy prevents Dragapult from being picked off by opposing Dragapult and Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Meowscarada. Finally, Tera Dragon turns Draco Meteor into an even more powerful nuke. This takes advantage of the lack of prominent bulky Steel- and Fairy-types in the metagame, notably chunking answers to Ghost-types like Purifying Salt Garganacl and Ting-Lu and 2HKOing Unaware Clodsire.</p> <p>Choice Specs Dragapult fits perfectly on bulky offense and VoltTurn teams. Physical wallbreakers like Chien-Pao and Great Tusk appreciate Dragapult's U-turn bringing them in safely, and they are able to pressure its switch-ins like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, Blissey, and Garganacl. Entry hazard removers like Corviknight and Great Tusk allow Dragapult to pivot throughout the game unperturbed; the former can also pivot it in safely via U-turn, letting it threaten Gholdengo, which tends to switch into Corviknight to block its Defog. Furthermore, Corviknight and Great Tusk provide the necessary defensive backbone to switch into boosted threats such as Roaring Moon, as well as revenge kill attempts from Sucker Punch users like Kingambit and Chien-Pao. Gholdengo forms a Ghost spam core with Dragapult, as it can overwhelm a shared check in Ting-Lu, use non-Calm Mind Blissey as setup fodder, and either cripple Tera Water Garganacl with Trick or straight up dent Tera Fairy variants. Entry hazards from Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Garganacl can quickly put foes into Dragapult's KO range, especially as it tends to force a lot of switches; in return, Dragapult spinblocks foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch. Setup sweepers like Volcarona, Iron Valiant, and Swords Dance Chien-Pao appreciate Dragapult wallbreaking early-game for them to clean up late-game easily.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Band Dragapult utilizes its near-unresisted STAB moves, its blistering Speed stat, and its excellent Attack stat to function as a strong physical wallbreaker. The choice for the second move depends on what Tera type Dragapult chooses. Tera Dragon Dragapult uses Phantom Force for a Ghost-type STAB move, but Tera Ghost uses Tera Blast, since, unlike Phantom Force, it is not a two-turn move. Sucker Punch allows Dragapult to revenge kill weakened sweepers such as opposing Dragapult, as well as Iron Moth and Tera Flying Roaring Moon after some chip damage. However, be careful when using Sucker Punch, since opponents can predict it and set up. An Adamant nature gives Dragapult extra wallbreaking power, at the cost of being outsped by threats like Chien-Pao. Alternatively, a Jolly nature allows Dragapult to outspeed the entirety of the unboosted metagame. With Tera Dragon, Dragapult's Dragon Darts becomes harder to switch into; it 2HKOes walls Dragapult normally struggles with such as Ting-Lu. Tera Dragon Dragapult is also less susceptible to Sucker Punch, albeit at the cost of losing its immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Iron Valiant is a fantastic partner, since it's able to check Dark-types such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu. Hazard removal from Pokemon like Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for good partners, since Dragapult's lack of longevity makes it difficult to switch in when hazards are up. Great Tusk and Corviknight are able to beat both Scizor and opposing Great Tusk, while Cinderace can threaten bulky Steel-types such as Corviknight. Dragapult benefits from entry hazards from the likes of Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl, since it can more effectively wallbreak with entry hazards up. Other pivots such as Scizor and Rotom-W appreciate that Dragapult's U-turn can bring them in. In return, Scizor can revenge kill Ice-types such as Chien-Pao, while Rotom-W can check both Corviknight and defensive Great Tusk. Paralysis support from Rotom-W can shutdown offensive Pokemon like opposing Dragapult and Roaring Moon. Lastly, Gholdengo makes for a good teammate, since it can spinblock and deny Defog and can help Dragapult overwhelm shared checks like Kingambit and Ting-Lu.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Unlike its more offensively oriented Choice item sets, this Dragapult set goes for a more multifunctional approach. Dragapult's unmatched Speed tier, in conjunction with STAB Dragon Darts, allows it to snipe key offensive threats such as Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Cinderace with some prior chip damage. This often means that Dragapult will force a lot of switches which can be capitalized on with Will-O-Wisp to spread status and power up Hex. Will-O-Wisp also allows Dragapult to avoid Sucker Punch, which can come in handy against Cinderace, Kingambit, and Meowscarada. With a burn and Stealth Rock up, Hex 2HKOs Defensive Corviknight, Amoonguss, and Dondozo, allowing Dragapult to pick apart balanced cores. Finally, U-Turn rounds out the set, letting Dragapult keep momentum up even against hard counters like Ting-Lu and Garganacl. 252 Speed EVs with a Hasty nature ensure that Dragapult outspeeds the entire unboosted tier. 76 Attack EVs ensure an OHKO on Roaring Moon with Dragon Darts, while the rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack. Although Dragapult does not typically find itself needing to Terastallize very often, Ghost is most commonly used to power up Hex even further. For example, Tera Ghost Hex does a minimum of 84% to a burnt Defensive Great Tusk. In a pinch however, Terastallization can be used defensively to avoid OHKOs like from Chien-Pao's Ice Shard.</p> <p>Because of the amount of utility it provides, Dragapult appreciates plentiful chip damage from its teammates, as it lacks immediate power. All forms of entry hazards are greatly appreciated due to Dragapult's ability to force out the opponent, so entry hazard setters like Garganacl, Great Tusk, Glimmora and Ting-Lu form good teammates. Stealth Rock is particularly important since it secures important 2HKOs with Hex. Among the entry hazard setters, Garganacl has fantastic synergy with Dragapult, as it is able to set up Stealth Rock while also chipping down foes with Salt Cure. Partners that can spread status such as Rotom-W and Skeledirge are also excellent teammates. Since Ting-Lu and Garganacl stonewall this set, teammates that scare them out such as Offensive Great Tusk and Banded Meowscarada are great partners. Tera Flying Covert Cloak Gholdengo forms a particularly potent Ghost spam core with Dragapult, as it can turn common counters to Dragapult such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Garganacl into setup fodder. Physical sweepers like Chien-Pao and Kingambit appreciate having their counters like Corviknight and Great Tusk crippled with burns and have solid type synergy with Dragapult. Due to this set being most potent in the mid- to late-game, it's more at home in teams with solid defensive backbones that can sponge hits. Defensive pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Hatterene, Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Amoonguss can all soak damage for Dragapult from common checks like Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Kingambit while setting up entry hazards, spreading status, or dealing chip damage, allowing Dragapult to clean up later in the game.</p> "

Salt Cure wears down common switch-ins such as Great Tusk, Gholdengo, Rotom-W, and Hatterene, as well as passive Pokemon like Toxapex and Corviknight, and forces them to burn recovery PP more often. Recover keeps Garganacl healthy throughout a game to check Pokemon like Ceruledge and Iron Moth and makes it more sustainable as a wincon. Purifying Salt prevents it from being crippled by Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Clodsire. It also provides a handy Ghost resistance, letting Garganacl potentially switch in on predicted Ghost-type moves from Pokemon like Dragapult and Skeledirge. Leftovers provides valuable passive recovery, reducing Garganacl's reliance on Recover. Maximum Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature maximize Garganacl's bulk, making it easier for Garganacl to switch in on Pokemon such as Iron Moth, Volcarona, and Dragapult and use them as setup fodder. Tera Water provides incredibly valuable resistances, letting Garganacl potentially check Gholdengo and Scizor while retaining its ability to pivot in on Fire-types like Cinderace. Tera Fairy allows Garganacl to turn the tables on Great Tusk and Sacred Sword Chien-Pao while also preventing Breloom from revenge killing it. However, this does remove its resistance to Fire, making it more susceptible to Pokemon like Skeledirge and Ceruledge. Tera Ghost prevents Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Great Tusk from reliably revenge killing Garganacl, letting it use them as setup fodder. It does negate the Ghost resistance provided by Purifying Salt, however, so another switch-in to Dragapult's Shadow Ball should be used.</p> <p>Checks to strong wallbreakers like Iron Valiant, Breloom, and Chien-Pao are good teammates; examples include the likes of Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Corviknight. While Garganacl is given a Ghost resistance from Purifying Salt, it cannot fully check Dragapult and Gholdengo prior to Terastallization, with the latter completely countering it if it uses Covert Cloak. As such, Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Clodsire make for great teammates. Pokemon like Corviknight and Scizor appreciate Garganacl checking Fire-types like Ceruledge and Skeledirge. Corviknight is notable in that it also forms a strong defensive core with Garganacl, checking Meowscarada for it. Entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and the aforementioned Corviknight are appreciated, as Garganacl is heavily pressured by entry hazards and cannot set up reliably if it is worn down. Frail, offensive Pokemon like Cinderace and Chien-Pao appreciate chip damage being forced onto their checks and having a strong defensive Pokemon to fall back on. Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Iron Valiant can pave the way for Garganacl to clean late-game, wearing down or significantly pressuring its checks in Gholdengo, Meowscarada, and Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Great Tusk.</p> "

It can adequately check Pokemon like Kingambit, Cinderace, and Iron Hands, threatening them with a strong Earthquake in return. Stealth Rock lets Great Tusk compress even more roles, chipping away at the opposition. If another Stealth Rock user is already on the team, however, Body Press can take advantage of its high Defense stat and better threaten the likes of Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon. Body Press also lets Great Tusk catch Rotom-W with greater chip damage than Knock Off does on the switch. Knock Off provides valuable item removal, getting rid of Leftovers from Pokemon like Dondozo, Corviknight, and Hatterene, as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Volcarona and Dragonite. Additionally, Knock Off is Great Tusk's only initial way to hit Air Balloon Gholdengo, which can't OHKO this defensive set. Rapid Spin, besides clearing entry hazards, also allows Great Tusk to outspeed faster foes like Focus Sash Glimmora and Gholdengo. Tera Fighting gets rid of Great Tusk's Ground typing, giving it a better matchup against Pokemon like Chien-Pao while also strengthening Body Press if it is used. Alternatively, Tera Steel can give Great Tusk valuable resistances to Fairy, Grass, and Ice, turning the tables on Hatterene and Chien-Pao. Leftovers greatly increases Great Tusk's longevity; however, Rocky Helmet can be used to wear down Pokemon like Scizor and Cinderace over time.</p> <p>After Great Tusk sets Stealth Rock, Corviknight effortlessly switches in and uses Defog to remove entry hazards, so Pokemon like Cinderace, Gholdengo, and Rotom-W that handle it are great partners.

Therefore, checks to these such as Dondozo and Corviknight are appreciated. A different Stealth Rock setter like Garganacl or Ting-Lu lets Great Tusk comfortably run Body Press without losing out on anything major. Ting-Lu also forms a potent entry hazard-stacking core with Great Tusk via Spikes. Further, it takes on the special attackers that Great Tusk struggles with, like Gholdengo, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Volcarona. Great Tusk is forced out by wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Quaquaval, so teammates that can check them like Amoonguss and Toxapex are welcome. Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Ceruledge, and Iron Moth appreciate the entry hazard removal that Great Tusk provides.

Rapid Spin lets Great Tusk provide entry hazard removal for the team in games where it would not be able to win with Bulk Up, while allowing it to boost its Speed in games where it can sweep with Bulk Up. Body Press is another option that gives Great Tusk a way to more immediately hit Dark-types such as Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and Ting-Lu. Tera Water turns Great Tusk's Water and Ice weaknesses into resistances and thus allowing it to better take hits from Azumarill, Chien-Pao, Quaquaval, and Floatzel. On the other hand, Tera Steel lets Great Tusk take on Grass-type attacks such as Breloom's Bullet Seed and Meowscarada's Flower Trick, Flying-type attacks like Roaring Moon's Acrobatics, and if need be, Fairy-type attacks such as Iron Valiant's Moonblast.</p> <p>Bulk Up Great Tusk appreciates specially defensive teammates like Toxapex and Garganacl that can help play around fast special attackers such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Choice Specs Dragapult.

If running Life Orb over Heavy-Duty Boots, entry hazard control from Great Tusk or Hatterene is greatly appreciated. Great Tusk and Hatterene can also use their great physical bulk and quadruple resistance, respectively, to switch into Fighting-type attacks aimed at Chien-Pao.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Ting-Lu is an incredible entry hazard setter for bulky offense and balance teams alike thanks to its combination of gargantuan defensive stats, good utility movepool, and an amazing defensive ability in Vessel of Ruin. It also has a great typing that lets it answer threats such as Gholdengo, Choice Specs Dragapult, Iron Moth, and Ceruledge. Whirlwind is incredibly useful for thwarting setup Pokemon like Roaring Moon and Volcarona. Ruination lets Ting-Lu deal consistent damage to bulky Pokemon like Corviknight, Rotom-W, and Hatterene. Tera Poison lets Ting-Lu act as an answer to Iron Valiant while giving it an immunity to poison damage from Clodsire’s Toxic and letting it absorb Toxic Spikes from the likes of Glimmora and Iron Moth. Meanwhile, Tera Fairy is a generally solid defensive typing, letting it more reliably check Pokemon such as Dragapult and Great Tusk. Maximum Special Defense, in tandem with Ting-Lu's ability, makes it a more consistent check to special attackers such as Choice Specs Dragapult and Volcarona.</p> <p>Ting-Lu’s premier defensive profile makes it most proficient on bulky offense and balance teams that can supply enough offensive momentum to make up for Ting-Lu’s relative passivity. Pokemon that can supplement offensive prowess to make up for Ting-Lu's passivity such as Chien-Pao, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit make for excellent partners, as they can assist against threats like opposing Iron Valiant, Dondozo, and Great Tusk. Without Ruination, Ting-Lu is utterly helpless against Corviknight, so Pokemon that can threaten it such as Gholdengo and Cinderace make for excellent partners. Bulky Water-types like Dondozo and Toxapex appreciate Ting-Lu's immunity to Electric while being quite helpful against Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Quaquaval in return. Other defensive Pokemon like Garganacl and Corviknight also make for excellent partners, being helpful against Pokemon like Chien-Pao and Scizor while appreciating Ting-Lu’s ability to check Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult. Additional entry hazard setters such as Garganacl and Great Tusk allow Ting-Lu to fit Ruination into its moveset more capably, so it is less passive in the face of Ground-immune threats like Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo.</p> "
