Drought + Solar Beam allows Mega Charizard Y to subdue Water-types such Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Tapu Fini, further restricting its defensive counterplay. Fire Blast is preferred to hit as hard as possible, though Flamethrower's perfect accuracy and greater PP make it worth consideration. Weather Ball is an interesting option, as it presents a challenge to rain teams by dealing considerable damage to Pelipper on the switch, but it comes at the cost of Mega Charizard Y losing its primary STAB move outside of sun. Scorching Sands pressures Heatran, Toxapex, and Skeledirge, while Focus Blast threatens Mega Tyranitar. Mega Charizard Y's tremendous wallbreaking prowess allows late-game sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult, Dragonite, and Volcarona to take advantage of Unaware walls that have been compromised, such as Skeledirge and Clodsire. Mega Charizard Y's sun support benefits Protosynthesis users such as Great Tusk. Mega Charizard Y appreciates entry hazard control from teammates such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Kartana, as it is extremely susceptible to Stealth Rock. It also struggles to break bulky Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Mega Latias as well as special walls like Clodsire and Hippowdon. Weavile, Tyranitar, and Kingambit subsequently form strong offensive cores with Mega Charizard Y, as they are able to Pursuit trap its aforementioned checks, with the former being able to deal with Hippowdon as well. Mega Charizard Y's middling Speed tier and unremarkable physical bulk leave it prone to being revenge killed by faster threats such as Dragapult, Mega Lopunny, and Tapu Koko. Therefore, bulky switch-ins such as Assault Vest Tangrowth, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T make for good teammates.</p> "

Aside from granting Mega Charizard X more setup opportunities, Roost compensates for Flare Blitz recoil and its Stealth Rock weakness, allowing it to take advantage of its typing and natural bulk to soft check common foes like Volcarona, Mega Scizor, and Choice Scarf Kartana as well as preventing revenge killing attempts from Mega Lopunny and Kingambit. Dragon Claw is an alternative on hyper offense teams where the longevity isn't as necessary, which allows Mega Charizard X to hit Dragonite, Mega Latias, and Garchomp as well as providing neutral coverage against foes like Rotom-W, Tera Water Skeledirge, and Tera Grass Heatran. Offensive partners like Kartana, Weavile, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit can pressure the opposition early-game for Mega Charizard X to sweep more easily, as they can cripple and either pressure or overwhelm shared checks in Toxapex, Slowbro, Skeledirge, and Iron Defense Garganacl; in return, it threatens Tangrowth for Kartana, handles Gholdengo for Iron Valiant, and melts other Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Corviknight for them. Pivots like Dragapult, Rotom-W, and Tornadus-T bring Mega Charizard X in safely via U-turn on Pokemon like Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Gholdengo, respectively; the latter two in particular can remove entry hazards with Defog so it can enter the field unscathed, especially if it's not running Roost and hasn't Mega Evolved yet. Dual screen setters found on hyper offense teams, such as Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl, give Mega Charizard X an easier time setting up.</p> "

Chansey can provide cleric support with Aromatherapy, especially since it can switch into status users like Clodsire and Rotom-W thanks to Natural Cure. However, Stealth Rock can be used if the team lacks another user, and Chansey can do it sufficiently by outlasting common entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T. Tera Steel allows it to reliably check Tapu Lele, Hatterene, and Tornadus-T, and it prevents Chansey from being poisoned. Chansey is generally reserved for bulkier builds that appreciate its defensive profile and can tolerate its overall passivity. Sturdy walls like Skeledirge, Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Corviknight can cover physical attackers like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, and Kartana for Chansey. Skeledirge's Unaware helps against setup sweepers like Mega Scizor and Mega Charizard X that attempt to use Chansey as setup fodder, while Corviknight's Defog alleviates Chansey from entry hazard pressure that would overwhelm it easily. Knock Off and Trick absorbers like Clefable, Toxapex, Mega Scizor, and Gholdengo make sure that Chansey can keep its valuable Eviolite; Additionally, Mega Scizor helps deal with Psyshock Tapu Lele, Gholdengo threatens Calm Mind Hatterene, and Calm Mind Clefable overwhelms Heatran—especially if it's paralyzed—all of which are special attackers that can beat Chansey one-on-one.</p> "

Roost improves Dragonite's longevity and enables it to acquire multiple boosts against passive opponents. Roost lets Dragonite check Volcarona and rain sweepers such as Barraskewda throughout the entire match. Ice Spinner is another choice that clears the priority-blocking Psychic Terrain and hits Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Dragapult super effectively. Fire Punch can be used to hit bulky Steel-types not weak to Ground such as Corviknight, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. An Adamant nature is usually preferred to maximize Extreme Speed's damage output, but a Jolly nature enables Dragonite to outspeed Tapu Koko and the Normal-immune Dragapult after a single Dragon Dance. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures that Dragonite will always retain Multiscale even if entry hazards are up, but if the team's entry hazard control is good, Silk Scarf is another option that boosts Extreme Speed's power. Dragonite fits well on offensive teams as a priority-using revenge killer and late-game cleaner. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk and Garchomp can help chip down bulky targets such as opposing Great Tusk into range of its attacks. Tapu Lele poses a serious threat to Dragonite, as not only does its Psychic Terrain block Extreme Speed on grounded targets, but with a Choice Scarf it can also outspeed and deal massive damage to Dragonite even after setup, especially if Dragonite has not Terastallized yet. Gholdengo is a good partner, as it can switch in on and threaten Tapu Lele and prevent the opponent from removing entry hazards. Dragonite often struggles against Unaware users such as Dondozo and Skeledirge, so Pokemon that can grab momentum against them are appreciated teammates. Rotom-W and Tapu Koko can come relatively freely on Dondozo and threaten it with a Volt Switch while Heatran and Mega Diancie can switch into and set up Stealth Rock against Skeledirge. Strong wallbreakers like Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard Y, and Zamazenta all take advantage of Pokemon that Dragonite tends to struggle with, such as Dondozo, allowing it to sweep more easily late-game.</p> "

Future Sight + Teleport or Chilly Reception lets Slowking support its frail offensive teammates such as Mega Lopunny and Dragapult, giving them safe switch ins and amplifying their wallbreaking prowess afterwards. Teleport is a much more reliable way of pivoting, as its higher PP makes it more valuable in longer games and it provides Slowking's teammates with a safe switch in against Ferrothorn and other Teleport users like Blissey and Slowbro. Alternatively, Chilly Reception's snow helps disrupt weather teams like sun and rain as well as support Ice-type teammates like Kyurem and Weavile with its Defense boost.

U-turn allows it to serve as a pivot: easily switching it out of checks such as Gholdengo, Urshifu-R, and Mega Charizard Y, it brings in teammates like Tapu Koko and Dragapult to deal with them. Close Combat can be used to dispose of Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran much more quickly, greatly denting them on the switch. The given EV spread allows Mega Scizor to survive two Close Combats from Mega Lopunny after Stealth Rock and outspeed uninvested Heatran, with the HP and Special Defense EVs helping it check Tapu Lele. Mega Scizor's pivot support is extremely valuable to Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Zamazenta, which all also appreciate how well it exploits defensive Pokemon such as Clodsire, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-T. Rotom-W forms a strong VoltTurn core with Mega Scizor as well, with both pivoting out on their checks and racking up solid chip damage over time. Nasty Plot Tornadus-T appreciates Mega Scizor pressuring specially defensive walls and offensive Pokemon like Weavile and Clodsire, letting it go all-in as an offensive wallbreaker with ease. Mega Scizor wearing down Rotom-W and Heatran is also particularly useful for Tornadus-T, as these Pokemon can heavily damage or cripple Tornadus-T in one way or another.

Dual Wingbeat hits Clodsire and Toxapex for reliable neutral damage, hits Zamazenta super effectively, and breaks Substitute against Shed Tail hyper offense teams and Dragon Dance Dragapult. Knock Off is an alternative to hit Gholdengo reliably and remove items like Leftovers from Rotom-W and Heavy-Duty Boots from Tornadus-T, Skeledirge, and Volcarona. This allows a teammate or Mega Scizor to wear them down much more easily. Knock Off is especially relevant in Rotom-W's case, as removing Leftovers makes it easier to put into KO range of +2 Close Combat. Running Knock Off makes Toxapex a much worse matchup, however, so Pokemon like Great Tusk and Tapu Koko that can pressure it are appreciated. Sand Tomb can be used to reliably beat Clodsire, Toxapex, and Gholdengo, preventing them from reliably checking it. Offensive Mega Scizor fits much better on hyper offense teams, which appreciate its incredibly valuable—though short-term—defensive utility. Grimmsnarl is a perfect teammate, providing dual screens to let it set up against foes like Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Landorus-T; it also pivots Mega Scizor in and appreciates it baiting in Gholdengo, which prevents Grimmsnarl from pivoting as effectively. Gholdengo itself is also a notable partner, as it appreciates Mega Scizor dispatching the most popular Dark-types in Weavile and Kingambit. Entry hazards from suicide leads like Landorus-T and Garchomp allow Mega Scizor to clean late-game, as its foes must be chipped before any sweeping is done. Entry hazards particularly help in wearing down checks like Urshifu-R and bulkier Garchomp sets. Mega Scizor struggles against bulky Steel-resistant Pokemon like Rotom-W and Volcarona; Dragonite and Dragapult can take care of the latter, switching into Volcarona to set up as it switches into Mega Scizor, whereas Great Tusk can remove Leftovers from the former, making it easier for Mega Scizor to dispatch with +2 Close Combat. Physically defensive Unaware walls in Skeledirge and Dondozo completely wall Mega Scizor, so offensive Pokemon that can bait in or wear down these foes, including Iron Valiant, make for solid partners.</p> "

U-turn is an alternative over the latter two moves that provides a more risk-free option to exploit Hydreigon's checks, giving Pokemon like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny free entry. Tera Dark further boosts Hydreigon’s power, allowing its Dark Pulse to reliably 2HKO the likes of Toxapex and Heatran. Hydreigon fits best on bulky offense and offense teams that have reliable options to switch it in safely. Hydreigon pairs very well with pivots such as Mega Lopunny, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T, as they can switch it in against opposing defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W. Assault Vest Tornadus-T pairs particularly well with Hydreigon, as it notably checks Dragapult, as well as providing insurance against foes such as Iron Valiant. Pokemon that can exploit common switch-ins to Hydreigon such as Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit pair well with Hydreigon, meaning the likes of Great Tusk and Zamazenta are good partners. Similarly, Pokemon that can lure or weaken the aforementioned switchins, such as Gholdengo and Dragapult, pair well with Hydreigon.</p> "

Fire Spin traps and accumulates chip on a myriad of defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex, Ting-Lu, Gastrodon, and Clodsire. Earth Power, in combination with Fire Spin, increases the damage that the aforementioned Pokemon take while also threatening Heatran. Alternatively, Dark Pulse can be used as a solid STAB move to hit airborne Pokemon such as Gliscor. Taunt prevents passive walls such as Toxapex and Gastrodon from healing while also preventing Hydreigon from being crippled by status from the aforementioned Pokemon as well. Tera Poison gives Hydreigon a Toxic immunity and a favorable defensive typing, allowing it to safely trap Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Iron Valiant. Offensive teammates like Mega Lopunny, Volcarona, and Dragapult appreciate Hydreigon trapping and removing walls like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Gastrodon support Hydreigon, as they heavily chip and pressure switch-ins like Kingambit in combination with Hydreigon's Fire Spin. Hydreigon is easily forced out by Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele, Mega Diancie, and Iron Valiant. As such, Pokemon that can handle the aforementioned threats such as Gholdengo, Clodsire, and Toxapex make great teammates for it.</p> "

Fire Blast can be slotted over Flamethrower to hit much harder, notably OHKOing most variants of Gholdengo, but Flamethrower is usually better because of its consistency. Volcarona can utilize Giga Drain with Tera Grass to hit a plethora of Water-type Pokemon like Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Urshifu-R hard, in addition to Ground- and Rock-types such as Great Tusk and Garganacl. Hidden Power Ground and Tera Ground help Volcarona bypass checks like Toxapex and Heatran after slight chip damage while also removing Volcarona’s glaring Rock weakness. Psychic with Tera Psychic allows Volcarona to break through Clodsire and Toxapex more reliably, but it is inferior to either of the previously mentioned Tera types due to its greater vulnerability to being revenge killed, and it leaves Volcarona completely stonewalled by Heatran. Flame Body can threaten to burn physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and Zamazenta, crippling them. Maximum Speed investment and a Timid Nature lets Volcarona outrun Choice Scarf users such as Tapu Lele and Urshifu-R after a boost. Modest can be run to hit walls like Clodsire and Toxapex harder, but it leaves Volcarona much more vulnerable to the aforementioned Choice Scarf users. Volcarona’s defensive utility is appreciated by allies such as Urshifu-R and Kingambit, as it can check dangerous Fighting-types like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta in a pinch. Bulky Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp can use it as setup fodder—with the latter additionally threatening Volcarona’s longevity with Toxic—so allies that can handle them such as Ferrothorn and Rotom-W are great partners to support Volcarona in its sweep. Heatran and Toxapex wall Volcarona if it doesn’t have Hidden Power Ground, so teammates like that can check them such as Garchomp and the aforementioned Rotom-W are much appreciated. Heatran also makes for a great ally, as it can eliminate or cripple Toxapex, Clodsire, and Skeledirge, which clears the way for Volcarona to clean up late-game.</p> "

Volcarona struggles with status conditions, as they can hinder its ability to check threats like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant in the long term, thus status absorbers like Gliscor and Toxapex make good partners; the former provides Defog support, a Knock Off absorber, and a Heatran check, and the latter helps prepare Volcarona’s sweep with Knock Off and status inducement. Volcarona can be easily exploited by setup sweepers like Garchomp, Dragapult, Mega Tyranitar, and Dragonite, and so checks like Rotom-W, Kingambit, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Lele can help to alleviate these matchups.</p> "

The bulk investment allows Hawlucha to survive Clefable's Moonblast, which is unnecessary if running Psychic Seed. 176 Speed EVs can be used instead to revenge kill +1 Dragon Dance Dragapult.

Haze removes boosts from the likes of Dragon Dance Dragapult and Espathra. Other options such as Toxic Spikes and Baneful Bunker can be explored over either Toxic or Haze, with the intent to cripple offensive teams or maximize Toxapex's ability to scout and pivot, respectively. However, removing Toxic leaves Toxapex worse off against common Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Rotom-W, while removing Haze makes it harder to handle setup sweepers. Although Toxapex rarely Terastallizes, Tera Dragon ensures Rotom-W's Volt Switch never outdamages Regenerator while also removing its Ground and Electric weaknesses against the likes of Great Tusk and Tapu Koko. The EV spread maximizes Toxapex's physical Bulk while allowing it to survive two Scorching Sands from Mega Charizard Y. Toxapex fits best on defensively oriented teams, which don't mind its passivity and can make up for any of its defensive shortcomings. Toxapex pairs well with Unaware Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Clodsire, which can handle setup sweepers that Toxapex falters to such as Kingambit and Gholdengo. In return, Toxapex sponges various weaker attacks using Regenerator from the likes of Gastrodon and Rotom-W. Toxapex dislikes losing its item, as it can easily be pushed into KO range against wallbreakers such as Zamazenta and Dragapult alongside entry hazards.

After a Dragon Dance, Dragapult outspeeds all Choice Scarf and Booster Energy users, such as Kartana, Greninja, and Iron Valiant, making it extremely hard to stop if it sets up successfully. Ghostium Z-powered Phantom Force enables a boosted Dragapult to blast through bulky Steel-types such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Heatran after slight chip damage. Dragapult's typing gives it opportunities to switch in and set up against certain Pokemon such as Volcarona, non-Ice Spinner Dragonite, and Urshifu-R locked into a Fighting-type move. Substitute is the preferred option in the last moveslot to ease prediction and facilitate setup while also avoiding priority. Substitute also allows Dragapult to play mind games with Kingambit. Fire Blast is another option that allows Dragapult to deal massive damage to physically defensive Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, both of which can survive a boosted Never-Ending Nightmare at full health. Clear Body is the preferred ability to avoid stat drops from Intimidate, but Infiltrator can also be used to improve the matchup against dual screens and  teams. A Jolly nature lets Dragapult outspeed Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko prior to setting up. Dragon Dance Dragapult fits best on offensive teams, where it can function as a potent late-game cleaner with its Z-Move. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Glimmora can help chip bulky foes such as Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit into range of Dragapult's attacks. Gholdengo can block attempts to remove entry hazards, as well as pressure certain physical walls that give Dragapult a hard time, such as Ferrothorn. Dragapult can struggle with bulky physical walls such as Dondozo, Garganacl, and post-Tera Skeledirge, so powerful special wallbreakers that can take advantage of these Pokemon, such as Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard Y, are greatly appreciated. Tapu Lele also provides Psychic Terrain, which thwarts revenge killing attempts from priority moves. A late-game cleaner such as Dragonite or Booster Energy Iron Valiant can take advantage of the holes Dragapult left behind in the enemy defensive core.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Despite Hex Dragapult's lack of immediate offensive presence, it can be a very annoying threat; it excels in getting around many of Dragapult's normal checks and counters, pivoting to dangerous teammates, and spreading status. Against common checks like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Toxapex, it can bring in Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Great Tusk, and Tapu Koko, respectively, to punish the opponent. Will-O-Wisp boosts Hex to monstrous levels and threatens to pacify physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, and Kingambit. Dragon Darts is a strong physical move to better hit special walls like Clodsire, forcing it to recover lest Dragapult's teammates like Iron Valiant break through. With Tera Ghost, it can muscle through specially defensive Toxapex after burn and entry hazard damage with Hex, though Tera Fairy helps it tank hits from opposing Dragapult and Dark-type moves like Pursuit, and it can still check Zamazenta. Infiltrator allows it to check threats behind Substitutes, such as Iron Defense Zamazenta. Dragapult struggles to break through Heatran, so Pokemon that can pressure it such as Garchomp and Rotom-W are great partners. It also must be careful around Pursuit trappers like Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar, as even after a burn they heavily chip it; teammates like Urshifu-R, Iron Valiant, and Great Tusk are thus mandatory to threaten said trappers. Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard Y very much appreciate Dragapult crippling and weakening Kingambit and Tyranitar, respectively, as this aids in the process of removing them. In return, Dragapult can clean up the opposing team after its checks are gone. Pivots like Rotom-W and Corviknight bring Dragapult in, with the former checking Heatran and forming a nice VoltTurn core with it, and the latter tanking Dragon- and Fairy-type moves for it. Entry hazards and Knock Off from the likes of Ferrothorn and Great Tusk weaken the opposition for Dragapult to clean, notably its checks like Toxapex and Clodsire.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Dragapult is a menacing wallbreaker, being able to threaten many teams with its STAB Shadow Ball and Draco Meteor. The former in particular is very spammable, as only a limited pool of Pokemon can switch into it. U-turn takes advantage of this limited pool, pressuring Shadow Ball switch-ins like Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar while bringing in teammates such as Urshifu-R and Zamazenta. Flamethrower hits Kingambit for massive damage, while Hydro Pump helps against Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu. Finally, Thunder pressures would-be checks, such as Toxapex. Ghost is the best Tera type for Dragapult, as it propels its Shadow Ball to a near-unstoppable level, making it even more spammable. Dragon boosts Draco Meteor's damage while making Dragapult less susceptible to Pursuit, while Tera Fairy purely helps it defensively: not only does it not fear Pursuit, but it's also not weak to Ice Shard or Sucker Punch from Weavile and Kingambit, respectively. Finally, it gives Dragapult a Dragon immunity, which allows you to beat Dragon Dance Dragapult after it burns the Z-Move. Dragapult must be wary of Pursuit from Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit, as they can both shrug off multiple Shadow Balls and remove it from the game. However, it can pivot around its checks, so Pokemon that can take advantage of and remove them make great partners, such as Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, and Iron Valiant. The latter two also share checks with Dragapult, like Clodsire and Toxapex, meaning they can overwhelm these checks. Dragapult also greatly appreciates Knock Off support from Tornadus-T, Weavile, or Ferrothorn, as its checks such as Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Garganacl all rely a lot on their items. Finally, since checks such as the aforementioned Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit are very susceptible to Spikes, Dragapult appreciates its setters such as Ting-Lu, Ferrothorn, and Gastrodon.</p> "

Will-O-Wisp lets it cripple physical attackers such as Mega Tyranitar, Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T while also punishing Water-types such as Rotom-W. Combined with Will-O-Wisp, Hex helps it overwhelm passive checks in Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Clodsire while also allowing Skeledirge to sweep statused teams. While not as strong as Hex, Shadow Ball is a decent option as it's more consistent. Tera Water allows Skeledirge to beat rain teams by spreading burns against rain sweepers such as Mega Swampert, Barraskewda, and Floatzel. On the other hand, Tera Fairy allows it to counter Dragon Dance Dragapult and avoid Pursuit from Kingambit, Mega Tyranitar, and Weavile while also keeping a Fighting resistance, meaning it can still check Zamazenta. It also removes Skeledirge's Ground weakness, allowing it to comfortably burn Pokemon like Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T. Skeledirge struggles against Heatran and Garganacl, as it can't burn them nor deal significant damage to them. Therefore, Pokemon that pressure them like Garchomp and Rotom-W for the former and Cover Cloak Gholdengo for the latter make good partners. Skeledirge also hates losing its item, so Knock Off absorbers like Flyinium Z Tornadus-T and Gliscor make for good teammates.

Knock Off support from Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Great Tusk allows Sandy Shocks to capitalize on chipping down switch-ins like Dragonite and Tornadus-T.

Tera Ghost allows Iron Treads to block opposing Rapid Spin attempts from Great Tusk if necessary. Iron Treads should be used as a lead on hyper offense teams, so other support teammates and sweepers are natural partners. Dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko allow their sweeping teammates another layer of support and safety, and they can use Taunt to consistently deny Defog attempts even after Iron Treads has fainted. Common hyper offense sweepers, like Mega Gyarados, Galarian Moltres, Kingambit, Volcarona, and Baxcalibur appreciate Iron Treads laying Stealth Rock while keeping hazards off at the same time.

Ice Punch lets it nail Ground-, Flying- and Dragon-types that resist its STAB combination such as Landorus-T, Dragonite, Zapdos, and Great Tusk. Tera Water lets Iron Hands gain a much stronger defensive type overall, preventing Ground-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types from revenge killing it while improving the rain matchup significantly.

Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain also activates Iron Hands's Quark Drive, boosting its Attack even further. Due to its great defensive utility, it partners well with Pokemon like Slowbro and Dragapult, as it takes advantage of Dark-types that pressure these two out, with Slowbro providing Future Sight support and Dragapult taking advantage of Iron Hands’s checks like Buzzwole and Skeledirge.

Iron Moth can also opt for Tera Blast + Tera Ground to hit Toxapex, Heatran, Skeledirge, and Clodsire all at once while removing its irritating Stealth Rock weakness. This makes Iron Moth very reliant on Terastallizing to break certain teams, however. Tera Grass should be used otherwise, as it still lessens Iron Moth's Stealth Rock weakness while also allowing it to potentially turn the tables on Garchomp, Mega Swampert, and Urshifu-R. U-turn can also be used to ease prediction and safely bring in teammates, but Iron Moth's Stealth Rock weakness makes this a risky proposition. Iron Moth needs very solid entry hazard control, so options such as Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, Cyclizar, and Great Tusk make for solid teammates; the former three can also bring Iron Moth in safely via pivoting. Tapu Koko is another great option, as Electric Terrain jacks up Iron Moth's power to titanic levels, cleanly 2HKOing Clodsire, Garchomp, and Skeledirge with Fire Blast after the Quark Drive boost. It also allows Iron Moth to deal sizable damage to physically defensive Toxapex with Fire Blast, potentially 2HKOing it after some chip. Heatran switch-ins such as Garchomp, Rotom-W, and Slowking are appreciated, as its presence makes it very hard for Iron Moth to safely use its STAB moves.
