        "description": "<p>Leveraging its high mixed natural bulk and resistances to many prominent offensive types, along with its natural ability to ignore Knock Off and status conditions, Mega Venusaur becomes a decent Mega Evolution for a myriad of team compositions. Sludge Bomb allows Mega Venusaur to threaten Fairy-types like Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant. Earth Power is required to hit Heatran and also to prevent the likes of Gholdengo, Sneasler, and Kartana from taking advantage of Mega Venusaurâ€™s STAB options. Giga Drain hits most foes that resist its coverage moves like Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, and Great Tusk for neutral damage. It also gives more healing opportunities, since Synthesis has low PP. The given EVs allow Mega Venusaur to outspeed Landorus-T and Moltres, potentially KOing them with a crucial Giga Drain or Sludge Bomb, respectively. Mega Venusaur pairs well with teammates with a strong offensive presence, since they can fall back on its defensive capabilities to break throughout the course of a game. Specifically, since Mega Venusaur is unfazed by Knock Off and status conditions, it can reliably check Pokemon like Toxapex and Ferrothorn. Wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Kartana can utilize its defensive capabilities and ability to switch into their checks to wallbreak more consistently. However, Mega Venusaur is very vulnerable to entry hazards, so allies that can remove them like Rotom-W and Great Tusk make great partners. Mega Venusaur is also easily checked by the likes of Zapdos and Tapu Lele, which can threaten it with powerful STAB moves, and Skarmory, which ignores damage from its moves. Some good teammates that can cover and check these include Gliscor, Heatran, and Gholdengo; in exchange, Mega Venusaur can check opponents like Rotom-W and Landorus-T. Finally, since Synthesis heals less in rain, Mega Venusaur has reduced longevity against this archetype despite its resistance to Water, so it will need additional support from teammates like Gastrodon and Rotom-W to cover this.</p>"

Drought + Solar Beam allows Mega Charizard Y to subdue Water-types such Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Tapu Fini, further restricting its defensive counterplay. Fire Blast is preferred to hit as hard as possible, though Flamethrower's perfect accuracy and greater PP make it worth consideration. Weather Ball is an interesting option, as it presents a challenge to rain teams by dealing considerable damage to Pelipper on the switch, but it comes at the cost of Mega Charizard Y losing its primary STAB move outside of sun. Scorching Sands pressures Heatran, Toxapex, and Skeledirge, while Focus Blast threatens Mega Tyranitar. Mega Charizard Y's tremendous wallbreaking prowess allows late-game sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult, Dragonite, and Volcarona to take advantage of Unaware walls that have been compromised, such as Skeledirge and Clodsire. Mega Charizard Y's sun support benefits Protosynthesis users such as Great Tusk. Mega Charizard Y appreciates entry hazard control from teammates such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Kartana, as it is extremely susceptible to Stealth Rock. It also struggles to break bulky Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Mega Latias as well as special walls like Clodsire and Hippowdon. Weavile, Tyranitar, and Kingambit subsequently form strong offensive cores with Mega Charizard Y, as they are able to Pursuit trap its aforementioned checks, with the former being able to deal with Hippowdon as well. Mega Charizard Y's middling Speed tier and unremarkable physical bulk leave it prone to being revenge killed by faster threats such as Dragapult, Mega Lopunny, and Tapu Koko.

Aside from granting Mega Charizard X more setup opportunities, Roost compensates for Flare Blitz recoil and its Stealth Rock weakness, allowing it to take advantage of its typing and natural bulk to soft check common foes like Volcarona, Mega Scizor, and Choice Scarf Kartana as well as preventing revenge killing attempts from Mega Lopunny and Kingambit. Dragon Claw is an alternative on hyper offense teams where the longevity isn't as necessary, which allows Mega Charizard X to hit Dragonite, Mega Latias, and Garchomp as well as providing neutral coverage against foes like Rotom-W, Tera Water Skeledirge, and Tera Grass Heatran. Offensive partners like Kartana, Weavile, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit can pressure the opposition early-game for Mega Charizard X to sweep more easily, as they can cripple and either pressure or overwhelm shared checks in Toxapex, Slowbro, Skeledirge, and Iron Defense Garganacl; in return, it threatens Tangrowth for Kartana, handles Gholdengo for Iron Valiant, and melts other Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Corviknight for them. Pivots like Dragapult, Rotom-W, and Tornadus-T bring Mega Charizard X in safely via U-turn on Pokemon like Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Gholdengo, respectively; the latter two in particular can remove entry hazards with Defog so it can enter the field unscathed, especially if it's not running Roost and hasn't Mega Evolved yet.

Magic Guard lets Clefable absorb status moves like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp for teammates like Ting-Lu, Ferrothorn, and Gastrodon. It also allows it to ignore entry hazards, helping it check Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Dragapult. Rocky Helmet punishes U-turn from Mega Lopunny and Landorus-T. Tera Water allows Clefable to have a better matchup into rain teams while resisting Steel-type attacks from Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Kingambit, allowing Clefable to catch them off-guard and cripple them. Tera Steel, on the other hand, allows Clefable to catch Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant with a Thunder Wave. Entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn appreciate Clefable's ability to incapacitate common Defog users such as Tornadus-T and Rotom-W thanks to Knock Off. They also appreciate having one moveslot being freed if Clefable carries Stealth Rock. Similarly, Clefable can cripple common entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Heatran, helping Defog users like the aforementioned Tornadus-T and Rotom-W perform their role. Toxapex works well with Clefable, as it checks Poison- and Steel-types like Iron Moth and Mega Scizor, helping Clefable spread Thunder Wave or set up with Calm Mind. They can also both overwhelm Ferrothorn, as the former can burn it and the latter nullifies Leech Seed's recovery. If Thunder Wave is used, Hex users like Gholdengo and Dragapult can be used to break Pokemon like Toxapex and Heatran that would otherwise stop Clefable from sweeping with Calm Mind.</p>"

Specially defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Heatran help cover threats like Tapu Koko, Volcarona, and Gholdengo, respectively; in return, Slowbro deals with Ground- and Fighting-types like Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Urshifu-R. Corviknight, Tornadus-T, and Buzzwole cover other physical attackers such as Kartana, Meowscarada, and Weavile that Slowbro struggles with; the former two remove entry hazards with Defog in case Slowbro is forced to take a Knock Off, while the latter can make use of Future Sight to wallbreak easier.</p>"

Chansey can provide cleric support with Aromatherapy, especially since it can switch into status users like Clodsire and Rotom-W thanks to Natural Cure. However, Stealth Rock can be used if the team lacks another user, and Chansey can do it sufficiently by outlasting common entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T. Tera Steel allows it to reliably check Tapu Lele, Hatterene, and Tornadus-T, and it prevents Chansey from being poisoned. Chansey is generally reserved for bulkier builds that appreciate its defensive profile and can tolerate its overall passivity. Sturdy walls like Skeledirge, Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Corviknight can cover physical attackers like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, and Kartana for Chansey. Skeledirge's Unaware helps against setup sweepers like Mega Scizor and Mega Charizard X that attempt to use Chansey as setup fodder, while Corviknight's Defog alleviates Chansey from entry hazard pressure that would overwhelm it easily. Knock Off and Trick absorbers like Clefable, Toxapex, Mega Scizor, and Gholdengo make sure that Chansey can keep its valuable Eviolite; Additionally, Mega Scizor helps deal with Psyshock Tapu Lele, Gholdengo threatens Calm Mind Hatterene, and Calm Mind Clefable overwhelms Heatranâ€”especially if it's paralyzedâ€”all of which are special attackers that can beat Chansey one-on-one.</p>"

Zapdos can Volt Switch out as it pleases because of common Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and the aforementioned Great Tusk fearing its powerful Hurricane. Hidden Power Ice can be used to threaten Ground-types like the aforementioned Landorus-T and Garchomp while additionally hitting Gliscor harder and much more reliably than Hurricane.

These positive matchups into many Ground-types allow Zapdos to serve as a solid Defog user, but it struggles to beat bulkier Stealth Rock users such as Heatran, Mega Tyranitar, and Clodsire. Alternatively, Zapdos can forgo Defog for Heat Wave, allowing it to threaten Pokemon such as Kingambit, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Gholdengo.

Volt Switch allows Zapdos to freely pivot while doing very good damage, especially due to common Ground-types like Landorus-T and Great Tusk being greatly threatened by Hurricane. Hidden Power Ice allows Zapdos to hit Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor for massive damage. Heat Wave is used to surprise Ferrothorn trying to come in on a Thunderbolt or Hurricane as well as consistently threaten Mega Scizor.

However, its main weakness lies in its overreliance on its Heavy-Duty Bootsâ€”although Tera could let it drop its weakness to Rock, Tera is usually better spent on other Pokemon, so Moltres still fears Knock Off from opponents it would otherwise check, like Iron Valiant, Landorus-T, Kartana, and Mega Scizor. Tera Water is used to ease the matchup against rain, becoming a check to common rain abusers like Basculegion-M, Mega Swampert and Barraskewda and threatening to burn them with Flame Body. Tera Ground instead grants a resistance to Stealth Rock and Stone Edge from Choice Scarf Landorus-T and an immunity to Volt Switch from Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Rotom-W and Thunderbolt from Iron Valiant. Mystical Fire is chosen over Flamethrower, as its Special Attack drop is useful to more easily check Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Mega Charizard Y, and Gholdengo. Scorching Sands is used to beat Heatran and also deter physical attackers looking to set up due to its high burn chance. Hurricane allows Moltres to OHKO Great Tusk and Mega Lopunny while heavily denting Volcarona and is useful in general as a powerful STAB option, U-turn allows Moltres to function as a pivot, pivoting out on foes like Heatran and Garganacl, and Toxic allows Moltres to punish Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Ting-Lu, and Garchomp looking to soak up its STAB options.

However, Taunt is also a valuable alternative to Agility in order to shut down defensive checks like Haze Toxapex and Unaware Clodsire while also preventing common status spreaders like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Heatran from limiting its sweep. Heavy-Duty Boots negates chip damage from entry hazards and allows Galarian Moltres to set up more reliably. Flyinium Z is used in order to quickly eliminate bulkier threats such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn without risking a miss due to Hurricane's poor accuracy; however, this leaves Galarian Moltres unable to Terastallize against threats such as Tapu Lele. Sitrus Berry is another option that lets Galarian Moltres maintain its health and trigger Berserk twice. Galarian Moltres is a great user of Terastallization, using Tera Steel to set up on its standard checks in Tapu Lele, Toxapex, Tapu Koko, and Clefable. Tera Steel also lets it resist many forms of priority including, but not limited to, Mega Lopunny's and Mega Medicham's Fake Out, Weavile's Ice Shard, and Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch.

Covert Cloak is a must for Mew to avoid being worn down by Garganaclâ€™s Salt Cure and help against being burned by Scald from the likes of Toxapex. Tera Poison grants Mew an immunity to Toxic, removing the biggest roadblock to its sweep, allowing it to beat the likes of Heatran, Clodsire, and Gliscor. The given EV spread lets Mew outspeed non-Choice Scarf Urshifu-R.

Therefore, teammates that can threaten or Pursuit trap it such as Garchomp and Kingambit are very appreciated. Toxapex uses Haze to sit on Mew and forces it to Tera to avoid Toxic, thus overwhelming or removing Toxapex with the likes of Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Heatran allow Mew to set up and win.</p>"

It can switch into foes like Tornadus-T and non-Toxic Heatran, and it can even scout for Choice Specs users such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Tapu Lele. Future Sight + Teleport or Chilly Reception lets Slowking support its frail offensive teammates such as Mega Lopunny and Dragapult, giving them safe switch ins and amplifying their wallbreaking prowess afterwards. Teleport is a much more reliable way of pivoting, as its higher PP makes it more valuable in longer games and it provides Slowking's teammates with a safe switch in against Ferrothorn and other Teleport users like Blissey and Slowbro. Alternatively, Chilly Reception's snow helps disrupt weather teams like sun and rain as well as support Ice-type teammates like Kyurem and Weavile with its Defense boost. Tera Fairy improves Slowking's matchup against Dragapult and Tapu Koko and maintains its Fighting resistance against Mega Lopunny, while Tera Dark lets it better stomach Ghost-type attacks from Gholdengo and Dragapult at the cost of being weaker against Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant. Both Tera choices importantly prevent Slowking from being Pursuit trapped by Kingambit, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar. Wallbreakers like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, Great Tusk, and Kingambit appreciate Slowking's slow pivoting, with the looming Future Sight pressuring their switch-ins like Toxapex, Buzzwole, and defensive Great Tusk. Moreover, Slowking switches into their revenge killers, notably Nasty Plot Tornadus-T and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Ting-Lu, and Tangrowth cover foes like Weavile, Tapu Koko, and Kartana, respectively; Ferrothorn and Tangrowth also deal with rain wallbreakers like Mega Swampert and Barraskewda that would otherwise overwhelm Slowking despite its Water resistance, with the latter in particular forming a Regnerator core with Slowking.</p>"

Sludge Bomb lets it deal with Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele while also letting it fish for poison on Pokemon like Zapdos and Moltres. Chilly Reception lets Galarian Slowking mess with weather like rain and sun while also letting it pivot around offensive Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Tapu Koko, and Iron Valiant. Thunder Wave lets Galarian Slowking cripple Pokemon who would use it as setup fodder such as Volcarona and Tornadus-T. Ice Beam lets Galarian Slowking significantly dent Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor, while Flamethrower can let it hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor in a pinch. Slack Off gives Galarian Slowking reliable recovery to handle the aforementioned threats long-term. Tera Steel lets Galarian Slowking handle Tapu Lele even better and let it pivot out into a teammate or damage them with either Flamethrower or Sludge Bomb, respectively. 0 Speed IVs let it pivot out last against slower Pokemon like Ferrothorn. More physically defensive sets can be used as well, but even with Galarian Slowking's great special bulk, it cannot sponge special attacks as well as specially defensive. Tera Water lets it take a Fire Blast from Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona and Thunder Wave in return, or pivot out on them as well. Galarian Slowking is very vulnerable to Pursuit trappers like Mega Tyranitar and Weavile, so teammates that can handle them such as Ting-Lu and Mega Scizor are well appreciated. Urshifu-R and Mega Lopunny are notable abusers of Future Sight from Galarian Slowking, appreciating it pressuring and exploiting their checks like Toxapex, Moltres, and Zapdos.</p>"

Flamethrower hits Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, while Scald lets it punish foes with a potential burn, most notably Pokemon like Landorus-T and Mega Tyranitar. Ice Beam lets it immediately threaten switch-ins like Gliscor, but leaves it vulnerable to Heatran. Earthquake can be used to hit Heatran, but using it does come at the cost of not having the utility of a move like Scald. 248 HP EVs optimize Regenerator recovery, and in tandem with 224 Special Defense EVs, it lives 2 Fire Blasts from Mega Charizard Y after Stealth Rock. Tera Steel and Tera Water improve matchups against Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard Y, respectively. Both types also give it a Pursuit neutrality, leaving it less vulnerable against Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar and Weavile. Galarian Slowking appreciates Pokemon that can absorb Knock Off to preserve its Assault Vest, so Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Gliscor make for good teammates. The latter forms a good core with Galarian Slowking, punishing and gaining information on passive and offensive Pokemon throughout a game due to the duo's prolonged longevity. Entry hazard removal helps Galarian Slowking not be ruined by Spikes, so Defoggers like Moltres and Zapdos help it not be chipped as much.</p>"

Knock Off provides item removal against counters such as Toxapex, Volcarona, and Skeledirge; removing key items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers makes threats like these much easier for allies to deal with. U-turn alternatively allows Mega Scizor to function as a potent pivot; It can rack up chip damage while providing free points of entry for wallbreakers, since it switches easily into Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant among others. Roost provides valuable recovery, letting Mega Scizor shrug off chip damage from Stealth Rock and stray Knock Offs. The given defensive EVs allow Mega Scizor to always avoid a 2HKO from Mega Lopunny's Close Combat after Stealth Rock, while the Speed EVs allow Mega Scizor to outspeed uninvested Heatran.  Mega Scizor's Knock Off support is valued greatly by allies such as Hisuian Samurott, which has a much easier time beating checks after they have had their Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots removed. Rotom-W notably forms a strong VoltTurn core with U-turn Mega Scizor, pivoting out on each other's checks to rack up chip damage. Mega Scizor has the added benefit of absorbing Knock Off for its team, so allies like Volcarona and Tornadus-T need not fear their key items being removed. However, Mega Scizor is countered by Fire-types like Heatran and Mega Charizard Y that threaten to OHKO it, so allies that can soak up these attacks such as Heatran itself and Toxapex are recommended.</p>"

Close Combat hits most Steel-types like Heatran, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn for massive damage and is good neutral coverage for Rotom-W and Manaphy. Knock Off is an option over Roost to hit Skeledirge and Zapdos, while Sand Tomb is another option to beat Toxapex while also maintaining a good matchup into Heatran, but Roost is more useful in a majority of cases. The given EVs allow Mega Scizor to outrun uninvested Moltres and defensive Landorus-T. Offensive Mega Scizor is a good fit on offensive teams that appreciate its defensive utility, though limited, along with its ability to act as a cleaner with +2 Bullet Punch. It can be used to outspeed and heavily chip threats such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Rotom-W, letting the team break through these foes, especially as they have no reliable form of recovery. Since Mega Scizor can check Fairy-types like Iron Valiant, Clefable, and Tapu Lele, partners like Garchomp and Heatran synergize well, as they also switch into Fire-types like Volcarona for it. Without Knock Off, however, Mega Scizor is walled by bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo, so allies like Zapdos are good partners.</p>"

Its immunity to Toxic and Spikes further accentuates its defensive capabilities, making it a very resilient wall. Aside from granting Skarmory an adequate offensive presence, Iron Defense + Body Press lets it beat and contest with Attack-boosting foes like Mega Scizor, Garchomp, and Kingambit that attempt to break past it. Rocky Helmet punishes the physical attackers itâ€™s tasked to check, notably Mega Scizor, Mega Lopunny, and Landorus-T's U-turn and Great Tusk and Excadrillâ€™s Rapid Spin. Tera Dragon allows it to check Mega Swampert, Urshifu-R, Victini, and non-Dragon Claw Mega Charizard X better at the cost of being weaker against Weavile and Garchomp. Tera Fighting lets Skarmory deal with Kingambit more comfortably. The EV spread allows Skarmory to outspeed Mega Mawile and maximum speed Kingambit. Skarmory fits on defensive builds, ranging from balance to stall. Special walls like Garganacl and Hippowdon are necessary to cover threats like Dragapult and Volcarona that would exploit Skarmory's poor special bulk. Hippowdon is an exceptional partner, as it also deals with foes like Zapdos, Tapu Koko, Mega Charizard Y, as well as mixed attackers like Mega Diancie and Iron Valiant. Moreover, they form an entry hazard-stacking core with Skarmory by providing Stealth Rock and spreading further chip damage with Salt Cure, Toxic, and sand to slowly crumble the opposition. Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Iron Hands, and Zamazenta are a few physical attackers that Skarmory can struggle with; Toxapex, Clefable, Tornadus-T, and Skeledirge, respectively, help handle them. Its inability to threaten Gholdengo can be covered by teammates like Kingambit and Clodsire. Late-game cleaners or bulky setup sweepers like Mega Lopunny, Volcarona, and Gholdengo appreciate Skamory's Spikes chipping down their checks like Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Kingambit, respectively; Gholdengo also prevents most entry hazard removal attempts due to its typing and Good as Gold.</p>"

Seismic Toss allows Blissey to pressure anything that isn't a Ghost-type with meaningful damage. Toxic is the preferred option to cripple Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. Thunder Wave can also be used to annoy fast threats like Tornadus-T and Iron Valiant. It also allows Blissey to status Steel-types like Kingambit, Heatran, and Kartana. Teleport allows Blissey to safely pivot in teammates like Dragapult, Zamazenta, and Mega Medicham. However, Blissey is an acceptable Stealth Rock user if no other fits on your team. Shadow Ball can be considered as a niche option to break Dragapult's Substitutes and chip offensive Gholdengo, but it usually isn't worth dropping other moves. Tera Fairy gives Blissey a Fighting resistance in exchange for negligible Poison and Steel weaknesses, and it reduces the damage it takes from Pursuit users like Kingambit, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar. This should be used if Blissey absolutely has to take on a Fighting- or Dark-type like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, or Weavile. Blissey's defensive profile makes it a liability into certain Ghost-types, specifically Dragon Dance Dragapult and Gholdengo. Kingambit is a great option that deals with the former two threats while also benefitting from Blissey bringing it in safely with Teleport. Other wallbreakers like Tapu Lele, Dragapult, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Medicham also appreciate pivot support and benefit from Blissey spreading Thunder Wave. A switch-in to powerful physical attackers, like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, and Kingambit, is necessary. Options like Toxapex, Slowbro, Skarmory, and Great Tusk can help out on this front. Knock Off is irritating for Blissey, as losing its Heavy-Duty Boots is quite detrimental to its pivoting efforts. Options such as Flyinium Z Tornadus-T and Gliscor can help out in this regard.</p>"

Knock Off allows Mega Tyranitar to remove items from switch-ins such as Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Great Tusk, greatly impeding their longevity. Pursuit lets Mega Tyranitar threaten to trap and remove foes such as Tapu Lele Choice locked into Psychic, Iron Moth, and Heatran. Additionally, the threat of Pursuit forces foes like the Tapu Lele to play quite predictably, easing the burden for teammates such as Galarian Slowking not having to fear Psychic-type attacks lest they be trapped by Mega Tyranitar. A solid matchup into common Defoggers like Zapdos and Moltres allows Mega Tyranitar to proficiently set up Stealth Rock, while Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots allows its own entry hazards to incur damage easier. The given Speed EVs allow Mega Tyranitar to outspeed Rotom-W. Iron Valiant is an incredible teammate for Mega Tyranitar, as Mega Tyranitar can trap and inflict heavy damage or outright remove Clodsire and Galarian Slowking, which are two of the biggest roadblocks for Iron Valiant. Defensively, Alomomola is very common teammate, as it can keep Mega Tyranitar healthy with Wish + Flip Turn and sponge attacks from Fighting-types it fears such as Mega Lopunny and Great Tusk. Gliscor can give Mega Tyranitar trouble, as once its Toxic Orb has been activated, it can switch in consistently without fearing the item loss of Knock Off while clearing Stealth Rock with Defog, so Ferrothorn, Urshifu-R, and Ogerpon-W are good teammates to assist combatting it.</p>"

Flip Turn allows it to maintain momentum against checks like Rotom-W and Alomomola while wearing them down. Ice Punch hits Pokemon such as Dragonite, Serperior, and Mega Latias that would check Mega Swampert otherwise. Alternatively, Stealth Rock can be used to take advantage of forced switches on Pokemon such as Garganacl and Galarian Slowking, as well as free up a slot for a teammate like Ferrothorn to run Spikes over Stealth Rock. Superpower is another option, which hits checks such as Kartana, Ferrothorn, and Ogerpon-W. As the premier rain setter in the tier, Pelipper is a mandatory teammate for Mega Swampert, being able to grant it free switches with its ability to act as a slow pivot with U-turn. Ferrothorn is another especially good teammate for Mega Swampert for its ability to switch into the defensive Water-types Mega Swampert has trouble dealing with such as Alomomola, Slowbro, and Rotom-W as well as Ogerpon-W lacking Superpower, and it can also make progress by setting hazards and forcing switches against these foes. Ferrothorn is also able to remove items like Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Skarmory, letting Mega Swampert attack more freely, and Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon such as Zapdos and Alomomola, making them more easily worn down by hazards. Mega Swampert can also struggle against Grass-types such as Kartana and Rillaboom, which makes Pokemon like Zapdos and Tornadus-T great teammates for their ability to check the aforementioned Pokemon. Mega Swampert also appreciates other Swift Swim users such as Barraskewda as teammates, being able to wear down each others' shared checks such as Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Archaludon is a good partner, being able to check Grass- and Water-types Mega Swampert has trouble with such as Alomomola, Ogerpon-W, and Serperior.

Roost keeps Pelipper healthy throughout the course of the game, enabling consistent rain and better longevity against threats such as Urshifu-R. Hurricane can be used to hit foes such as Urshifu-R, Tera Grass Heatran, and most notably, Ogerpon-W, for super effective damage, while Defog is an alternative that removes entry hazards if common partners in Tornadus-T or Zapdos lack it. Tera Ground is used to change Pelipper's 4x weakness to Electric into an immunity to potentially absorb Volt Switch from Tapu Koko or Rotom-W and pivot out. Pokemon that need rain to boost their strength and Speed such as Mega Swampert, Barrsekwda, Battle Bond Greninja, and Urshifu-R are great partners for Pelipper. They particularly appreciate Pelipper being able to bring them onto the field safely and often into a winning position via a slow U-turn. Mega Swampert also serves as a bulky Electric-immune Pokemon that can check Tapu Koko for Pelipper. Other Pokemon like Zapdos and Tornadus-T also benefit from the rain Pelipper sets up and can act both as excellent wallbreakers or entry hazard removers.

Most notably, it uses its solid Speed stat to outspeed and threaten Pokemon like Kartana, Mega Medicham, and Garchomp. These traits, in combination with its diverse movepool, make Mega Latias an acceptable wincon. Psyshock lets Mega Latias hit strong specially defensive walls such as Chansey and Slowking-G while also allowing it to threaten other setup sweepers such as Clefable and Volcarona. Aura Sphere removes threatening Dark-types such as Kingambit and Weavile while also preventing Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn from safely dealing with it. Mystical Fire can be used to threaten Gholdengo while still threatening Kingambit and Weavile somewhat, but it leaves it vulnerable to Mega Tyranitar, Heatran, and Hydreigon. Alternatively, Ice Beam + Thunder can be used on Mega Latias to give it perfect coverage and let it threaten Pokemon like Landorus-T and Gliscor, but it lacks immediate power, notably leaving it unable to threaten any Pursuit trappers. Pokemon such as Buzzwole and Toxapex form good defensive cores with Mega Latias, handling Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Kingambit for it while Mega Latias deals with Mega Charizard Y and Zapdos in return. Offensive teammates such as Kingambit and Great Tusk are also useful for pressuring checks such as Weavile, opposing Kingambit, and Gholdengo. Spikes support from the likes of Skarmory and Clodsire can be used to wear down checks to Mega Latias such as the aforementioned Kingambit and Gholdengo. Mega Latias is prone to being chipped down by Toxic and Stealth Rock, so teammates that deal with that weakness such as Gliscor, Toxapex, and Gholdengo are appreciated; the former provides valuable Defog support for it.</p>"

Aura Sphere is important coverage to hit Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn as well as to KO chipped Mega Tyranitar. Mystical Fire hits the aforementioned Ferrothorn along with Mega Scizor and Iron Crown. Draco Meteor is a powerful nuke to threaten foes like Galarian Slowking after a Luster Purge drop while also immediately threatening other Pokemon like Raging Bolt, Gouging Fire, and Mega Latias. Psychic Noise lets Mega Latios pressure checks that rely on recovery to deal with it, like Heatran and Mega Scizor, while also being a backup STAB attack with sufficient PP compared to Luster Purge. Mega Latios finds itself on many team archetypes including bulky offense and balance due to its versatility. However, it is outsped and revenge killed by Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Darkrai, and Weavile. Thus, teammates that can help with this like fast threats including your own Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant or defensive walls including Heatran and Clefable can help aid Mega Latios. In return, Mega Latios can pressure defensive checks like Heatran and Galarian Slowking for them. Good entry hazard control from allies like Great Tusk and Landorus-T helps, since Mega Latios is somewhat vulnerable to Stealth Rock due to its tendency to switch in and out very often.</p>"

Stored Power is Jirachi's main attacking move, nailing most foes that do not resist Psychic&amp;emdash;this also allows Jirachi to match up favorably against Toxapex and Clodsire, the two biggest setup stoppers in the tier. Aura Sphere allows Jirachi to deal with Dark- and Steel-types; these include Hisuian Samurott, Mega Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn. Drain Punch is an alternative to 2HKO Blissey, which otherwise walls Jirachi, and keep itself healthy with recovery when fighting foes like Heatran. Iron Head serves as a secondary STAB move that can also flinch down foes like Galarian Slowking and Dragonite. A Naive nature should be run when using Drain Punch over Aura Sphere. Jirachi pairs well with allies that can take out its main checks, since it can only set up once and thus has to make it count. Magnezone and Heatran are stellar partners, trapping foes like Ferrothorn and Garganacl that may stand in the way of a Jirachi sweep. Offensive Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, and Garchomp that may struggle against Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant pair well with Jirachi, as it acts as a soft check to these foes and can use them as setup fodder. Tapu Lele is also notable for providing Psychic Terrain that blocks priority such as Sucker Punch from Hisuian Samurott and powers up Stored Power. Finally, dual screens support from Tapu Koko or Grimmsnarl is beneficial to ease Jirachi's setup, as the damage reduction affords Jirachi more opportunities to successfully use Z-Happy Hour.</p>"

Iron Head allows Jirachi to easily revenge kill Fairy- and Ice-types, such as Iron Valiant, Tapu Lele, and Weavile, and has good odds to flinch down any foe that does not resist Steel, as long as they are sufficiently chipped. U-turn allows Jirachi to pivot out into teammates upon forcing out foes, allowing free points of entry for allies such as Ogerpon-W and Zapdos that capitalize on Jirachi's switch-ins in Heatran and Toxapex. Trick cripples most foes that try to switch into Iron Head; foes like Toxapex, Zapdos, Ferrothorn, and Alomomola dislike being locked into a move. Healing Wish gives weakened allies another chance to sweep, additionally curing status like burn and paralysis and offering a point of entry; it is best used on offensive Pokemon, such that they can be used more recklessly early-game and come back later to sweep. Ice Punch alternatively allows Jirachi to hit Landorus-T, Gliscor, Zapdos, and Garchomp particularly hard. Jirachi is best used on offensive playstyles that appreciate its one-off heal and ability to cripple defensive switch-ins. Since Jirachi acts as a soft check to the tier's premier Fairy-types in Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele, allies like Zamazenta and Weavile that dislike them pair well with it, as they can threaten Jirachi's checks in Heatran, Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Slowbro. Jirachi also struggles to revenge kill Mega Gyarados, Ogerpon-W, and Mega Scizor, especially once they set up, so allies like Ferrothorn and Corviknight are needed to act as sturdier checks. Finally, Jirachi is easily exploited by foes like Mega Charizard Y, Mega Scizor, and Garchomp, as all of them can switch into Iron Head and can ignore Trick provided the latter has a Z-Crystal. Allies that can take advantage of them such as Tapu Koko, Iron Moth, and Weavile make for good partners.</p>"

Aqua Jet gives Floatzel priority outside of rain against weakened targets such as Tapu Koko, Iron Valiant, and Mega Lopunny, and it bypasses Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Tornadus-T and Zapdos all appreciate Floatzel's offensive capabilities, as it deals with wallbreakers such as Dragapult, Mega Diancie, Gholdengo, Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, and Iron Valiant. Zapdos can reliably check Water-types that counter Floatzel like Slowbro and Dondozo. Tornadus-T can weaken and cripple Floatzel checks in Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Ferrothorn, as Knock Off removes Leftovers from them, making it easier for Floatzel to wallbreak. Offensive partners like Manaphy and Mega Swampert can overwhelm those same Water-resistant Pokemon as well as Dragonite.

Toxic better threatens defensive Pokemon such as opposing Gastrodon, Skeledirge, and Tornadus-T. Earthquake threatens Pokemon like Heatran, Clodsire, and Gholdengo.

The given EV spread maximizes Gastrodon's physical bulk to better take on the likes of Floatzel, Mega Swampert, and Urshifu-R. Gastrodon fits best on balance and bulky offense teams, which appreciate its defensive qualities while being able to supplement its passivity with offensive wallbreakers. Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Gholdengo can switch into Grass-type coverage from Pokemon like Kartana and Ferrothorn; In return, Gastrodon provides entry hazard support to wear down answers such as Mega Tyranitar, Kingambit, and Clodsire.

Fake Out is a fantastic priority move that inflicts meaningful chip damage onto offensive foes such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Tapu Koko, putting them all range of Frustration. U-turn provides momentum and allows Mega Lopunny to pivot out of its checks safely, such as Landorus-T and Great Tusk, and bring in its teammates. Alternatively, Quick Attack can be run to enhance Mega Lopunny's revenge killing capabilities, which helps against faster threats such as Dragapult and Booster Energy Iron Valiant. Triple Axel can also be run over U-turn to hit Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Tornadus-T, though this forgoes more consistent utility. Mega Lopunny sits very well on bulky offense teams, as they benefit from its Speed and pivoting abilities.

Garchomp's positive matchup versus the latter three in turn allow it to set and maintain Stealth Rock very well. Additionally, Garchompâ€™s solid natural bulk and good typing lets it find opportunities to set up on Pokemon like Heatran, Volcarona, and Iron Moth. Outrage with Dragonium Z gives Garchomp a stronger option that can notably OHKO Landorus-T at +1 while also OHKOing Great Tusk and Zapdos at +2. However, the Z-Move can require prediction if the opponent has a Fairy-type lest Garchomp become trapped into Outrage and easily revenge killed by foes such as Mega Diancie, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant. In comparison, Stone Edge bolstered by Rockium Z provides a more consistent attack for Garchomp outside of its Z-Move while hitting foes such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Corviknight harder than its Dragon-type Z-Move counterpart. Offensive teammates who can exploit the wallbreaking capabilities of Garchomp such as Mega Lopunny, Kartana, and Dragonite are appreciated, while teammates such as Volcarona, Iron Moth, and Ferrothorn give Garchomp a solid option to fall back on in the face of revenge killers such as Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.</p>"

Garchomp aims to punish physical attackers and force progression with entry hazards and Toxic. Dragon Tail lets Garchomp make the most of entry hazards laid by itself or teammates, being able to force foes to take damage at random if they lack Heavy-Duty Boots. Additionally, it can also be used to deny setup sweepers like Ogerpon-W, Iron Boulder, and Dragon Dance Gouging Fire lacking a Dragon-type STAB move. Garchomp can effectively lay both Stealth Rock and Spikes due to a positive matchup versus common hazard removal options such as Zapdos and Rotom-W while also dissuading Great Tusk from using Rapid Spin, as it will take serious chip damage from Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet. Toxic is another way to avoid passivity; it can be used to wear down foes such as Landorus-T, Alomomola, Zapdos, Great Tusk, and Dragonite. Tera Ghost is best used for deny Rapid Spin or to change its typing to survive other wise super effective hits such as Mega Diancie's Moonblast and Mega Medicham's Ice Punch. 56 Speed EVs are enough to outrun Modest Heatran. Mega Tyranitar is a solid partner, being able to remove Landorus-T and Great Tusk's Leftovers with Knock Off, which allows Garchomp to wear them down more easily with Toxic and Rough Skin in tandem with Rocky Helmet. Mega Tyranitar can also remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Alomomola and certain variants of Great Tusk, letting Garchomp's entry hazards rack up more damage. Garchomp really appreciates Alomomolaâ€™s Wish passing because it lacks a source of recovery. Garchomp's matchups against other Defoggers such as Corviknight, Gliscor, and Tornadus-T make it hard to keep hazards up at times, so teammates that can help with these Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos are appreciated alongside it. Galarian Slowking proves very useful to Garchomp because of its ability to check common Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant, which usually force out Garchomp.

Sand Stream also allows Hippowdon to disrupt opposing weather, which is bolstered by its positive matchup against every other weather setter. Toxic notably nets a ton of chip damage on Defoggers attempting to get rid of Hippowdon's Stealth Rock and Ground-Immune Pokemon switching into Earthquake, such as Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, and Mega Charizard Y. Hippowdon can Terastallize into the Steel typing to avoid Toxic in addition to Grass-, Water-, and Ice-type attacks while maintaining its sand immunity and Stealth Rock resistance. Even beyond the simple type matchup chart changes, it allows Hippowdon to more easily check its targets such as Tornadus-T, Tapu Lele, Zapdos, and Mega Diancie. Maximum Special Defense EVs are ran due to Hippowdon having more valuable special targets than physical, namely the aforementioned Pokemon. Mega Lopunny and Tornadus-T appreciate Hippowdon's presence, as it checks both Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Zapdos while setting up Stealth Rock to help wear down their checks. Defensively, Hippowdon supports Pokemon such as Garganacl and Skarmory; Garganacl appreciates the sand and its attached benefits and Skarmory appreciates the sturdy Ground-type anchor and special wall. Hippowdon struggles to fend off strong physical attackers like Kingambit, Mega Scizor, Kartana, and Mega Gyarados.

Knock Off is a powerful STAB option that heavily damages switch-ins predicting Triple Axel such as Rotom-W, Heatran, and Alomomola. Ice Shard gives Weavile some form of speed control and helps finish off weakened foes that normally threaten it such as Mega Lopunny, Iron Valiant, and Tapu Koko, as well as boosted Pokemon such as Tera Flying Unburden Sneasler and Tera Grass Volcarona. Furthermore, Weavile's longevity, and therefore its offensive pressure, is limited by its weakness to Stealth Rock, so Defoggers such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T are all very helpful.

In return, Weavile helps these Pokemon out by getting rid of thorns such as Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Mega Charizard Y, letting Scizor have a larger role offensively, as well as removing Pokemon like Gholdengo and Zapdos for Alomomola, which can use Alomomola as setup fodder and threaten an OHKO with Thunderbolt or Volt Switch to gain momentum, respectively. Mega Medicham and Iron Valiant are both excellent partners for Weavile, taking care of Toxapex, as well as bulky Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn, with Weavile Pursuit trapping Gholdengo for both of them or forcing it to Terastallize.

Alternatively, Sludge Bomb can be used instead to hit Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele while threatening to cripple switch-ins like Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y. Focus Blast can also be used to snipe  Kingambit, or even Rock Slide to remove unsuspecting Volcarona that try to set up on the switchâ€”the effectiveness of both options are highly matchup dependent, however. Hidden Power Ice hits bulky Ground- and Dragon-types in Garchomp, Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Gliscor, while Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Kartana. Tera Steel is preferred to turn Tangrowth's common weaknesses into resistances, helping it sponge Ice coverage from Weavile, Baxcalibur, and Mega Swampert and Hurricane from Tornadus-T and Zapdos. Moreover, it can be used in a pinch to resist Moonblast from Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele. Alternatively, Tera Water turns the tide against threats such as Weavile and Heatran while maintaining Tangrowth's ability to check rain wallbreakers such as Mega Swampert. Tangrowth fits best on bulky offense teams, which appreciate its ability to check Pokemon like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Rotom-W, and Tapu Koko. Heatran receives strong support from Tangrowth, as Tangrowth checks threats such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Garchomp and pivots into foes with super effective coverage against Heatran, such as Tapu Lele and Mega Diancie. In return, Heatran checks Weavile, Volcarona, and Tornadus-T. Toxapex and Tornadus-T both benefit from Tangrowth's ability to pivot into threats such as Tapu Koko and Rotom-W, with the former receiving the same level of support from Tangrowth as does Heatran. This trio comprises a formidable Regenerator core, with Toxapex removing Toxic Spikes and checking Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Weavile, and Tornadus-T providing valuable entry hazard removal to reinforce the longevity of the core. Tangrowth is susceptible to entry hazards, which can often put it into 2HKO range of certain attacks; therefore, it appreciates entry hazard removers like the aforementioned Tornadus-T, as well as Rotom-W. Defensive cores supported by Tangrowth can fall victim to Kyurem as a result of its lethal coverage. Volcarona and Mega Scizor are teammates that can take advantage of Kyurem with their ability to set up and reliable recovery. With Tornadus-T forcing Tangrowth out, Rotom-W and Tapu Koko make for stellar teammates with their resistance to Hurricane and ability to pivot. In return, Tangrowth forces out Gastrodon, which otherwise checks the aforementioned teammates.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its respectable bulk and fantastic passive longevity with Poison Heal, Gliscor occupies a fantastic niche on defensive teams. Its lack of use for its item slot after its activation combined with its Spikes immunity allows Gliscor to withstand weaker Knock Off attempts from Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn. Gliscor can use its longevity to act as an excellent Defog user, as it can outlast common Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl. Alternatively, Gliscor can opt for Stealth Rock if its team prefers it over Defog. Roost keeps Gliscor healthy alongside Poison Heal, allowing it to drain the PP of moves such as Heatran's Magma Storm and Garganacl's Salt Cure. Toxic allows Gliscor to pressure common entry hazard setters and Ground-immune Pokemon, such as Landorus-T, Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Tornadus-T. It also allows Gliscor to cripple offensive Pokemon such as Dragapult and Tapu Lele in a pinch. Tera Fairy gives Gliscor a generally solid defensive typing with few weaknesses, although at the cost of its Spikes immunity. The given HP EVs maximize Gliscor's recovery from Poison Heal and special bulk, with the remainder in Speed to outspeed Rotom-W. Gliscor fits best on defensive teams that appreciate its immense survivability and great support options. As such, Gliscor pairs well with sturdy physical and special walls, such as Skeledirge, Skarmory, Buzzwole, and Clodsire, since its relatively unremarkable bulk puts it at risk of being overwhelmed often. In return, it can switch into weak attacks with problematic secondary effects, such as Toxapex's Scald and Garganacl's Salt Cure, as well as help teammates keep their held items by absorbing Knock Off. Pokemon weak to entry hazards such as Nasty Plot Tornadus-T and Garganacl pair well with Gliscor's Defog support, while they act as threatening late-game wincons after Gliscor has worn down their checks. Gliscor pairs exceptionally well with Toxapex, as they form an incredibly sturdy pivoting core due to their incredible passive recovery.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Gliscor is an incredibly potent wincon, using its incredible longevity and solid bulk to effortlessly setup on passive Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Toxapex, and Clefable. Facade provides Gliscor with an excellent alternative move to hit Ground-resistant and -immune Pokemon such as Skarmory, Zapdos, and Buzzwole, with its ample PP ensuring that it can outstall their recovery PP if necessary. Roost provides Gliscor with instant recovery, allowing it to check Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Heatran. The given EVs allow Gliscor to fulfill this purpose with Special Defense investment, with the HP maximizing its recovery from Poison Heal. Tera Fairy allows Gliscor to leverage a typing with few exploitable weaknesses, given Steel-types such as Kingambit and Gholdengo fear its Earthquake, while Tera Water improves Gliscor's matchup against Pokemon like Volcarona and Urshifu-R. However, it comes with more exploitable weaknesses, given the prominence of Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Ferrothorn. Gliscor fits best on balance and fat teams, which appreciate its ability to tear through opposing defensive cores while providing enough of a defensive backbone in return to facilitate this. Pokemon like Toxapex, Skarmory, and Gholdengo can exploit Gliscor's temporary checks such as Great Tusk, Skarmory, and Buzzwole, generating progress of their own. On the flip side, revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and Dragapult can threaten offensive teams, given Gliscor's tendency to be overwhelmed when facing multiple strong wallbreakers. Gliscor appreciates Pursuit support from Mega Tyranitar or Kingambit, as it removes Gliscor's few true walls in Tera Ghost Rotom-W and Air Balloon Gholdengo.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Rotom-W provides a unique blend of defensive utility and wallbreaking potential thanks to its great combination of typing and ability in addition to its versatile move pool. Discharge has a chance to paralyze and cripple bulky switch-ins like Serperior, Tapu Lele, and Dragonite. Substitute keeps Rotom-W safe from status moves like Toxic and generates free turns for it to set up, turning many common utility Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Alomomola, and Heatran into Rotom-W's setup fodder. Volt Switch and Will-O-Wisp can be used as an alternative combination, the former helping Rotom-W keep up the momentum and the latter helping to cripple threats such as Dragonite and Garchomp. However, this combination is less effective for wallbreaking because it makes Rotom-W vulnerable to status moves and forces it to switch out if it needs to use its Electric-type STAB move, losing the boost from Nasty Plot. Tera Ghost combined with Levitate counters several popular Ground-type threats like Ursaluna, Sword Dance Gliscor, and Great Tusk, while Tera Steel and Tera Poison complement Levitate well and let Rotom-W effectively wall utility variants of Gliscor, the former improving its matchup into Tapu Lele and the latter granting it a resistance to common Fighting-type attacks from Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Urshifu-R. 44 Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed uninvested Landorus-T so it can set up Substitute first and dodge Toxic, while the rest of the EVs are dumped into bulk so it can check the aforementioned physical threats better. With most Rotom-W sets being pure utility, this set can often come across as a surprise to the would-be bulky checks to it such as Clefable, Zapdos, and Galarian Slowking, and it can also disrupt the opponent's pace by setting up Substitute and boost with Nasty Plot. However, both of its STAB moves are resisted by Grass-types and Dragon-types, which means it loses to the likes of Ferrothorn and Raging Bolt even after boosting. Serperior and Kyurem especially prey on this set because they both can use it as setup fodder.</p>"

        "description": "<p>A Choice Scarf and a great movepool to cripple foes give Rotom-W the luxury of annoying teams with its status moves and create huge vacuums of momentum thanks to Volt Switch, letting it function as a fast pivot. Hydro Pump discourages Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Ursaluna-B from coming in and blocking Volt Switch. Trick neutralizes setup threats such as Iron Defense Garganacl as well as walls such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn, greatly assisting offensive cores in breaking through. Thunder Wave cripples offensive threats such as Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, making them much easier to revenge kill and neutering the impact they have for the remainder of the game. Slower offensive Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Ogerpon-W enjoy being able to outspeed and threaten said threats that would previously be an issue. However, Will-O-Wisp is another great alternative, stopping foes such as Mega Lopunny and Urshifu-R from freely breaking through teams while helping their checks such as Toxapex and Alomomola stay healthier and ease the burden of checking them continuously throughout the game. Finally, Pain Split can be used, keeping Rotom-W healthy versus bulkier teams and being a huge thorn on walls after using Trick. Entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Tornadus-T are also useful teammates for it, preventing Rotom-W from taking Stealth Rock chip and preserving its longevity. The given EV spread and a Timid nature maximizes its bulk and Speed, helping it be as bulky and fast as possible as effectively as possible. Tera Steel helps it sponge hits like Iron Valiant's Moonblast and Baxcalibur's Scale Shot and cripple said threats, while Tera Ghost lets Rotom-W check Sneasler and wall Great Tusk.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Heatran's typing, ability, and solid bulk allow it to function as a switch-in to many common offensive threats including Tapu Lele, Volcarona, and Victini. Magma Storm allows Heatran to trap and KO passive foes such as Toxapex, Blissey, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, although it must Terastallize to take care of the latter two. Taunt allows it to effectively shut down trapped foes, denying recovery and preventing Toxic after Terastallizing, thus making its trapping capabilities more pronounced. Earth Power allows Heatran to hit Garganacl, Toxapex, and opposing Heatran, and it is a generally safe and accurate option against most trapped foes. Stealth Rock allows Heatran to lay entry hazards, especially in front of a trapped foe or after forcing out a foe, while Toxic is useful for wearing down switch-ins to Heatran such as Mega Gyarados. Tera Grass allows Heatran to shed its weaknesses and gain a unique defensive profile, walling most Pokemon that rely on Ground-type moves to hit it including Mega Charizard Y, Gliscor, and Clodsire. However, Heatran must still be wary when using its Tera, as it becomes more vulnerable to foes like Zapdos and Mega Scizor. Even without Special Attack investment, Heatran still poses a threat to opposing Fire-resistant foes such as Rotom-W and Garchomp, as they cannot switch in too many times without getting worn down. Allies like Volcarona appreciate Heatran pressuring foes like Toxapex and opposing Heatran for them. Heatran's ability to check Tapu Lele is also very useful for allies like Urshifu-R and Iron Valiant, as Tapu Lele is a commonly seen Choice item user, and Heatran's scouting allows teammates to safely double switch in once Heatran forces out Tapu Lele. Defensively, Heatran appreciates allies that can take Ground-type moves for it, reducing its need to Terastallize and thus saving it for a more deserving ally. Partners like Rotom-W, Mega Latias, and Gliscor are all immune to Ground-type moves from the likes of Garchomp and Landorus-T, and the former two can also switch into Water-type moves from foes like Urshifu-R while the latter two switch into Fighting-type moves from foes like Mega Lopunny. In exchange, Heatran covers Grass- and Ice-type moves for them. Heatran also has little means to heal off chip damage due to its lack of instant recovery. Thus, entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T make for good allies. Finally, Alomomola's Wish support is particularly valuable, as it can instantly heal Heatran while remaining healthy itself, and they also cover each other's weaknesses decently well, with Heatran taking Grass-type moves from Mega Charizard Y while Alomomola takes Water-type moves from Hisuian Samurott.</p>"

Heatran's natural bulk also means it can still reliably switch into resisted hits with ease despite not having defensive investment. Magma Storm + Taunt in conjunction with Earth Power allows Heatran to trap and remove foes effectively due to its spike in damage output from its Special Attack investment. Toxic is useful, as it allows Heatran to spread poison on switch-ins like Landorus-T and Alomomola that have pivoting moves to escape Magma Storm, hindering their effectiveness and putting a timer on their HP. Hidden Power Ice is an option to lure Gliscor and Garchomp and remove them for allies, as well as improving Heatranâ€™s matchup against opposing Tera Grass Heatran. Solar Beam in conjunction with Grassium Z allows Heatran to lure and nuke Alomomola, Mega Tyranitar, and Garganacl, OHKOing the former and heavily denting the latter two. Leftovers is useful for recovery, as Heatran has no means of instant recovery; Air Balloon allows it to check opposing Heatran along with foes like Gliscor and Garchomp, threatening massive chip damage or Toxic on them. Tera Grass is useful to check Ground-type move users and also to function as a pest to rain teams in general. Offensive Heatran appreciates pivots like Rotom-W and Landorus-T that can safely bring it in while baiting in Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Corviknight. It also appreciates allies that can switch into Ground- and Fighting-type moves for it, like Tornadus-T, Gliscor, and Zapdos, as they also share checks with Heatran, namely opposing Heatran, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, and appreciate Heatran chipping or outright removing these checks for them while being useful defensively as well.</p>"

Even without Terastallization, it can use its natural typing to withstand attacks from dangerous Pokemon such as Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Mega Medicham. Hidden Power Fighting is the preferred coverage move to hit Mega Tyranitar and Heatran much harder, while Moonblast provides a stronger hit against the likes of Dragapult and Urshifu-R if Cresselia cannot afford to accumulate multiple Calm Mind boosts. Tera Poison is essential for removing Cresselia's weaknesses to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks from Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Hisuian Samurott while providing less exploitable weaknesses compared to Tera Steel, which makes Cresselia prone to being revenge killed by Fighting- and Fire-types such as Mega Lopunny, Sneasler, Heatran, and Mega Charizard Y. Covert Cloak allows Cresselia to negate secondary effects from Garganacl's Salt Cure and status from the likes of Toxapex, Sneasler, and Zapdos, while Leftovers provides passive recovery that makes Cresselia less exploitable and forced to heal. Maximum Speed EVs allow Cresselia to consistently outspeed Heatran and Gholdengo, which could otherwise irritate it, although more Defense investment could be used instead to better withstand attacks from the likes of Urshifu-R and Zamazenta. Cresselia fits best on either bulky balance or hyper offense teams, both able to provide support in different ways; the former give Cresselia a defensive core to fall back on should its sweep fail, while the latter pressure opposing defensive teams and can provide dual screens support via Tapu Koko and Dragapult to bolster its bulk even further. Both playstyles can reliably keep up Spikes using Skarmory, Clodsire, Mega Diancie, or Garchomp, which Cresselia mandates in order to wear down its checks such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Similarly, Knock Off support from the likes of Toxapex and Iron Valiant helps Cresselia pressure the aforementioned checks more effectively. Cresselia has difficulty withstanding rain teams due to them cutting Moonlight's healing, so defensive partners that match up positively against them such as Toxapex and Tera Water or Dragon Garganacl are appreciated. Cresselia struggles with bulkier playstyles that can neutralize it with the likes of Haze Toxapex and Unaware Tera Dark Clodsire, so Pokemon that can break defensive teams such as Swords Dance Gliscor and Gholdengo make for good partners.</p>"

U-turn is useful to pivot out of checks that shrug off V-create like Toxapex and defensive Landorus-T, although Victini should be wary of Rocky Helmet on the latter. Trick is used to cripple tanks like Garganacl and Slowbro, reducing their longevity while receiving Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers in return. V-create's explosive power needs little Attack investment to perform effectively, still easily 2HKOing most neutral targets including defensive Volcarona and Tornadus-T. Thus, 248 HP EVs are instead used to maximize the potential of Final Gambit while minimizing damage from Stealth Rock. Tera Fire is used to fuel V-create, notably OHKOing Tornadus-T, and remove Victiniâ€™s weakness to Pursuit, but this comes at the cost of a comparably worse defensive typing against foes like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta. Victini's ability to threaten any foe allows it to very easily pivot into wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Urshifu-R, which appreciate having annoying defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Toxapex crippled or removed with Trick or Final Gambit. Setup sweepers also benefit greatly from Victini's presence, as it can surprise and KO defensive threats that would otherwise impede their progress; allies like Mega Medicham and Garchomp enjoy having threats like Gliscor and Landorus-T removed, and the clean field left after Victini KOes itself also affords them a free point of entry. However, Victini must be kept as healthy as possible to ensure that Final Gambit can OHKO what it needs to.

Searing Shot is another STAB option to target Steel-types like Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Focus Blast allows Victini to target pesky Dark-types like Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu along with Heatran, with its low accuracy somewhat offset by Victory Star. Victini can leverage its bulk to set up on many fast threats such as Mega Lopunny, and its buff after omniboosting lets it survive super effective moves from more passive enemies like Gliscor, making it a perfect fit on hyper offense. It is also naturally resistant to priority moves like Bullet Punch from Scizor, Vacuum Wave from Iron Valiant, and Grassy Glide from Rillaboom. Z-Celebrate Victini pairs well with entry hazard suicide leads like Landorus-T and Garchomp, as their Stealth Rock and potentially Spikes support is invaluable; with Stealth Rock, an OHKO on Tera Water Great Tusk and Ogerpon-W are near guaranteed; Stealth Rock also notably breaks Ogerpon-Câ€™s Sturdy along with stray Focus Sashes. Victini also appreciates teammates like Close Combat Iron Valiant luring Blissey and Tera Dark Clodsire, and they also help soften up Ting-Lu for Victini. Tapu Lele is another useful ally that can boost Stored Power with its summoned Psychic Terrain, which also prevents priority including Mega Lopunnyâ€™s Fake Out and Hisuian Samurottâ€™s Sucker Punch for a limited time.

Bolt Strike is used for coverage, targeting Water-types like Pelipper, Alomomola, and Toxapex. U-turn allows Victini to pivot out of bad matchups like Great Tusk and Rotom-W or after using V-create, pivoting in teammates to help it wallbreak. Encore can lock greedy setup sweepers like Gliscor and Garganacl into moves like Swords Dance or Iron Defense, allowing Victini to give its ally a free switch in or simply hit something hard with V-create. Toxic is an alternative to wear down defensive threats like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T into range of Victini or an ally and also cripple other switch-ins like Garchomp and Dragonite. Tera Fire cranks up the power of V-create, turning Victini into a wallbreaker capable of scorching most neutral targets for a 2HKO, like Tera Fairy Garganacl and Ting-Lu, and also notably OHKOing Tornadus-T. However, it then loses valuable resistances to Fighting- and Psychic-type moves, leaving it unable to check Tapu Lele and Mega Medicham after Tera. Victini suits bulky offense teams that appreciate its role compression both offensively and defensively. Wallbreakers like Weavile, Urshifu-R, and Mega Charizard Y all appreciate Victini's ability to give them free points of entry with U-turn, and the latter also boosts V-create with sun. However, due to its weakness to Stealth Rock if its Heavy-Duty Boots have been removed, as well as its weakness to Knock Off and Pursuit in general, Victini appreciates having teammates that can beat Dark-types like Mega Tyranitar and Weavile; Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny are good partners to check them and in the latter's case also absorb Knock Off. Victini is also vulnerable to Water-type moves from the likes of Mega Swampert and Basculegion especially when they are in rain, so allies that can soak up these moves like Gastrodon and Ferrothorn are good partners. In return, Victini takes Grass- and Fire-type moves for them, respectively. Finally, Tornadus-T, Landorus-T and Gliscor can help switch into Ground-type moves from the likes of Great Tusk, opposing Landorus-T, and Garchomp, and in return Victini tanks Ice-type moves from Alolan Ninetales and Kyurem for them.</p>"

It has decent natural bulk and a useful defensive typing that helps it find opportunities to switch in and set up against foes like Gliscor and Ogerpon-W. Hidden Power Fire is its most important coverage move for foes like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Iron Crown, all of which could stop Serperior otherwise even after several boosts. Glare provides excellent utility by crippling would-be checks such as Tornadus-T, Dragonite, and Volcarona with paralysis. Substitute, when paired with Glare and passive recovery from Leftovers, enables Serperior to fish for full paralysis and set up against more passive foes like Ferrothorn and Galarian Slowking, and it can even stall out Heatran's Magma Storm PP. The combination of Glare and Substitute often forces faster revenge killers like Zamazenta and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele to accept paralysis if they want to break Serperior's Substitute. Leech Seed is an alternative that enables Serperior to beat threats like Heatran on its own. Tera Steel is a wonderful defensive choice that helps against the likes of Tapu Lele, Weavile, and Flying-types such as Zapdos and Tornadus-T, and it completely shuts down walls like Galarian Slowking alongside Substitute. 56 HP EVs make sure that Serperior can keep its Substitute from being broken by Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and Ferrothorn's Power Whip. Tera Blast with an EV spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe and Tera Ground can be chosen over Substitute to hit foes like Heatran and Galarian Slowking, while Tera Rock trades Serperior's ability to break past Heatran and Galarian Slowking to beat Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona as well as Flying-types like Zapdos, Moltres, and Flyinium Z Tornadus-T. Wallbreakers that benefits from speed control like Urshifu-R, Tapu Lele, and Mega Medicham appreciate Serperior paralyzing faster foes like Darkrai, Tornadus-T, and Iron Valiant with Glare. Specially defensive Pokemon like Heatran and Galarian Slowking can give Serperior a hard time, especially when it's unable to Terastallize, so it is very helpful to have teammates like Landorus-T that can threaten them. Mega Tyranitar and Weavile can both provide Pursuit support for Serperior to pressure Galarian Slowking and Mega Latios, and both of them can also threaten foes like Zapdos and Tornadus-T.</p>"

Razor Shell provides a strong STAB move with a nasty chance to drop the foe's Defense, while Aqua Cutter has perfect accuracy and doesn't make contact, eliminating the risk of Static versus Zapdos and Rocky Helmet versus Landorus-T. Knock Off allows Hisuian Samurott to remove items, especially Heavy-Duty Boots users like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Alomomola. Flip Turn allows for pivoting while doing decent STAB damage. Sacred Sword allows Hisuian Samurott to 2HKO Ferrothorn and OHKO Mega Lopunny, Darkrai, and Mega Tyranitar. Tera Water lets Hisuian Samurott 2HKO defensive Zapdos and OHKO Mega Medicham most of the time. Tera Dark allows Hisuian Samurott to OHKO Galarian Slowking and Tapu Lele. Tera Poison is an alternative choice, providing a resistance to Fighting-type coverage from Pokemon like Iron Boulder and Mega Lopunny, Fairy-type coverage from Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant, and U-turn from foes such as Landorus-T. Wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Darkrai, and Urshifu-R appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to chip foes with Ceaseless Edge. Other Spikes setters like Ferrothorn and Gliscor are able to run different moves, as Hisuian Samurott can set Spikes itself. Hisuian Samurott is very frail, and it can have trouble switching in safely, so have pivots that can help with this, such as Landorus-T, Corviknight, Tapu Koko, and Alomomola. Despite using Choice Scarf, Hisuian Samurott is outsped and OHKOed by Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder, and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, so checks to these like Heatran, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Zapdos help a lot.</p>"

Black Glasses boosts Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge and Sucker Punch to further heights, allowing it to have an easier time breaking through foes such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Ferrothorn with the former while also giving it an easier time dispatching of revenge killers like Kartana and Iron Moth with the latter. Protective Pads lets Hisuian Samurott avoid contact effects from Ferrothorn, Zapdos, and Moltres which could otherwise stop or significantly hinder its ability to wallbreak. Tera Dark further amplifies the power of Hisuian Samurott's Dark-type STAB attacks, allowing it to OHKO targets like Mega Medicham with Sucker Punch without Black Glasses while dealing massive damage to defensive cores which could otherwise shrug off Ceaseless Edge even while boosted, such as Zapdos and Skarmory. Alternatively, Tera Poison provides a useful defensive typing that can turn the tables on foes such as Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant, as well as deny Toxic from Alomomola and turn it into setup fodder. Offensive teams that appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to punch holes in opposing defensive structures while laying Spikes to help them break such as Kartana, Mega Diancie, and Tapu Lele make for good teammates. Defensive teams featuring Dondozo have no trouble with taking boosted Ceaseless Edge, so Tapu Koko and Ferrothorn are good teammates to help with this weakness. These two also assist with ensuring Alomomola and Toxapex are no problem for Hisuian Samurott, since they can otherwise threaten with a potential Toxic or Scald. Additionally, opposing offensive teams can make it hard for Hisuian Samurott to find its footing due to its middling Speed stat, so Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham can assist in these matchups while appreciating the Spikes set versus more balanced styles. Teammates who effectively use Knock Off such as Tornadus-T, Weavile, and Ferrothorn are great teammates as they can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes like Toxapex, making them more susceptible to the Spikes set by Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge.</p>"

Swords Dance gives Excadrill a way to threaten defensive Pokemon that would otherwise deal with it well, such as Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Great Tusk. Steelium Z lets Excadrill muscle through Pokemon like Landorus-T, Great Tusk, Tangrowth, and Buzzwole, while Normalium Z + Giga Impact dents Zapdos and Pelipper harder. Rapid Spin allows Excadrill to compress roles as an entry hazard remover. Toxic can be used to cripple Zapdos, Slowbro, Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Tangrowth, especially with sand damage. Jolly is the optimal nature for Excadrill to speed tie opposing Excadrill, though an Adamant nature can be used to maximize damage output. Excadrill requires sand to function, so Mega Tyranitar is mandatory. Mega Tyranitar can also handle Pokemon like Zapdos and Pursuit trap checks like Slowbro, as well as provide Stealth Rock to wear down Excadrill's checks. Pokemon that can handle physically defensive walls such as Tangrowth, Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Rotom-W for Excadrill, such as Zapdos and Tapu Lele, form solid offensive cores; it can deal with their checks like Gholdengo, Heatran, and Tyranitar in return. Excadrill is also susceptible to revenge killers like Mega Lopunny and Dragapult outside of sand, so switch-ins like Kingambit, Zamazenta, Ting-Lu, and Toxapex pair well with it.

It pairs well with the main sun setter, Mega Charizard Y, as it can switch into and threaten Mega Charizard Yâ€™s checks such as Hippowdon, Heatran, and Clodsire; in return, Mega Charizard Y beats its checks like Gholdengo and Mega Scizor, if Hisuian Lilligant lacks Tera Blast. Solar Blade is used for raw power, although Leaf Blade is still an option for consistency outside sun. Tera Blast Fire, especially in sun, gives Lilligant a powerful third STAB option to punish foes that can tank its original STAB combination like Gholdengo, Mega Scizor, and Tera Poison Cresselia. Sleep Powder is an option to shut down checks such as Dragapult or scout for Tera types from Pokemon like Kingambit and Dondozo, which can be used as setup fodders or opportunities to give a free switch to an ally; this also allows Hisuian Lilligant to use Tera Fighting over Tera Fire for more power. Ice Spinner is another option, granting an OHKO on Flying-types that can absorb Hisuian Lilligant's STAB options such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and most Zapdos sets. Hazard support is invaluable in allowing boosted Solar Blade to OHKO Toxapex lacking Heavy-Duty Boots and Mega Scizor, making Great Tusk and Heatran good partners that also passively benefit from the sun. Finally, Hisuian Lilligant is vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster threats once the sun ends, so it appreciates a sturdy defensive core to back it up; Toxapex, Heatran, and Great Tusk can tank hits from and reliably check threats such as Iron Valiant and Mega Lopunny once the sun goes down, while Landorus-T and Rotom-W are examples of pivots that can help bring Hisuian Lilligant in more easily.</p>"

      "Hustle Breaker": {
        "description": "<p>Hustle coupled with Victory Dance can be used to break common defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Great Tusk, Landorus, Kingambit, and Heatran; Hisuian Lilligant also outspeeds a good portion of the metagame after a Victory Dance boost, allowing it to threaten even common Choice Scarf users such as Urshifu-R, Tapu Lele, and Gholdengo. Its main drawback lies in the decrease in accuracy, which makes it inconsistent and potentially easy to KO. Wide Lens can be used to circumvent this, as the accuracy boost will minimize the chances of a miss. Grassium Z can allow Hisuian Lilligant to dismantle defensive cores, letting it OHKO the likes of Toxapex , Landorus-T, and defensive Tornadus-T and heavily damage Zapdos after a Victory Dance and Stealth Rock damage to potentially open up a hole for another ally like Kartana or Volcarona to clean up. Victory Dance allows it to outpace most of the metagame and fire off powerful attacks. Tera Blast Ground allows Hisuian Lilligant to snipe Gholdengo and Skeledirge for super effective damage whilst also notably beating common Poison-types like Toxapex and Sneasler. Sleep Powder can be considered to shut down foes and set up more easily. Ice Spinner is also an option to beat common Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Tera Flying Kingambit. Icium Z is an option when running this, as it allows Hisuian Lilligant to score an OHKO on Gliscor, defensive Landorus-T, and defensive Garchomp whilst avoiding Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin chip from the latter two. Hisuian Lilligant has trouble setting up, as it is frail enough to be susceptible to the multitude of offensive Pokemon in the tier. Its inconsistent accuracy may also sometimes leave it open to attacks. Thus, dual screens support from the likes of Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko is beneficial, although it should be noted that the latter summons Electric Terrain, which nullifies Sleep Powder. Entry hazard support is important to score OHKOs on certain Pokemon; for example, Bloom Doom OHKOes Toxapex and Tornadus lacking Heavy-Duty Boots after Stealth Rock damage. As such, Garchomp and Ferrothorn are examples of good entry hazard setters. Finally, Hisuian Lilligant can still be defensively checked by Pokemon like Zapdos, if lacking Ice Spinner, Volcarona, and defensive Gholdengo; allies that can beat these checks include Volcarona and Mega Diancie.</p>"

Dragapult can form an offensive Ghost-spam core with Hisuian Zoroark and appreciates it KOing Dark-types with Focus Blast.

Regenerator allows Amoonguss to check those same threats long-term; it also prevents it from being worn down by pivots like Rotom-W and Tapu Koko as well as entry hazards if its Heavy-Duty Boots is removed via Knock Off. Spore incapacitates switch-ins such as Heatran, Volcarona, and Dragapult; the latter two would otherwise use it as setup fodder, while the former completely walls Amoonguss by being immune to Sludge Bomb. Sludge Bomb spreads status against the aforementioned Volcarona and Dragapult as well as bulkier switch-ins like Skeledirge and Tornadus-T and threatens Iron Valiant. Hidden Power Fire lets Amoonguss chip Poison-immune foes like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor as well as OHKO Kartana, preventing them from safely switching in. Heavy-Duty Boots lets it switch in as much as needed without fear of entry hazard damage; it also prevents Regenerator recovery from being stifled in longer games. Rocky Helmet is an alternative that wears down contact attackers like Mega Lopunny and Landorus-T as well as the aforementioned rain wallbreakers in Barraskewda and Floatzel. It should only be used if entry hazard control is decent enough, however, with support from Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Rotom-W. Tera Water provides invaluable resistances against Fire and Ice, letting Amoonguss potentially get an emergency Sludge Bomb or Spore in against foes like Weavile and Heatran. Tera Steel is an alternative that lets Amoonguss emergency check offensive foes like Tapu Lele while also giving it a better matchup against non-Heat Wave Tornadus-T; it also retains the Ice resistance given by Tera Water. Rotom-W is an excellent partner, as it stifles offensive and defensive Pokemon alike that Amoonguss struggles with, such as Heatran, Skeledirge, and Tornadus-T. In return, Amoonguss takes pressure off Rotom-W as a check to rain wallbreakers and can deal with Rotom-W switch-ins like Ferrothorn and Tangrowth. Gholdengo completely counters Amoonguss by virtue of its immunity to Spore and it taking negligible damage from Hidden Power Fire; as such, checks to it such as Kingambit and Poison Jab Clodsire are recommended, with the latter forcing Gholdengo to Terastallize so it can freely fish for poison.</p>"

Heavy-Duty Boots is the standard item for Alomomola; however if a team lacks a way to punish contact moves and has sufficient hazard removal, then Rocky Helmet should be considered. Tera Dragon allows Alomomola to check Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Koko missing Dazzling Gleam, while Tera Fairy improves its matchup against Choice Band Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny, and Tera Poison provides a Toxic immunity and checks Iron Valiant. Common Pokemon unhindered by Toxic use Alomomola as setup fodder, such as Gliscor, Substitute variants of Zamazenta, and Mega Scizor. Rocky Helmet users such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory can punish the use of Flip Turn, along with Water Absorb Pokemon such as Ogerpon-W and some Clodsire variants can prevent the move from having any effect. Spikes, in conjunction with Knock Off from users like Mega Scizor, Hisuian Samurott, and Ferrothorn can also be extremely lethal to Alomomola. Knock Off can be used to cripple Pokemon that heavily rely on Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers, such as Zapdos, opposing Alomomola, Heatran, and Landorus-T, or Scald to threaten Kartana and Mega Scizor; but it should be noted that not using Toxic gives free setup turns to dangerous foes like Volcarona and Calm Mind Iron Valiant.

Alternatively, Tera Ground allows Volcarona to dodge revenge killing attempts from the likes of Iron Boulder while powering up Hidden Power Ground to let it potentially OHKO Gouging Fire at +1. Due to Volcarona's high threat level, common attempts to check it involve using Terastallization on a defensive Pokemon, such as Heatran or Alomomola; as such, partners like Raging Bolt and Kyurem appreciate Volcarona forcing those Pokemon to Terastallize. Grass-types like Serperior are also great partners, as they can bait in Heatran for Volcarona while being able to switch in situationally on Water-types like Ogerpon-W and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R that threaten it out. Serperior can also force progress with Glare on threats like Gouging Fire or setting up with Leaf Storm while chipping checks like Raging Bolt. Dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl are also good teammates to allow Volcarona to set up far more easily and win games quickly.</p>"

      "Bulky Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Due to its typing, ability, and the combination of Quiver Dance and Roost, Defensive Quiver Dance Volcarona is a powerful late-game sweeper and a decent pivot against Fairy- and Fighting-type moves such as Iron Valiant's Moonblast as well as Mega Lopunny and Zamazenta's Close Combat. Hidden Power Ground is an alternative to hit foes like Heatran, Garganacl, Mega Diancie, and Raging Bolt. Giga Drain can be paired with Tera Grass to provide coverage against Rock-types like Garganacl and Mega Diancie, as well as Water-types like Ogerpon-W, Alomomola, and Mega Swampert, and it helps to keep Volcarona healthy without sacking momentum to use Roost. Roost makes sure that Volcarona can check foes like Iron Valiant and Mega Lopunny in the long run and win the 1v1 against Tapu Lele and Darkrai without being chipped severely. Tera Grass gives Giga Drain a STAB boost and removes Volcarona's weakness to Water-types, which can be useful against offensive threats like Ogerpon-W and rain. Tera Steel allows Volcarona to turn walls relying on Toxic to make progress into its setup fodder, examples of which are Alomomola and Blissey. It also provides Volcarona with better matchups against the likes of Mega Tyranitar and Mega Diancie. The above EVs make sure that Volcarona can survive the damage from Stealth Rock twice and outspeed Zamazenta at +1. Teammates like Urshifu-R and Ogerpon-W can lure in walls like Ferrothorn and provide Volcarona with great opportunities to set up. They can also handle specially defensive foes like Heatran and Galarian Slowking for Volcarona when it's not equipped with Hidden Power Ground. Since it heavily relies on Heavy-Duty Boots to prevent entry hazard damage, Volcarona appreciates teammates like Gliscor and Mega Tyranitar to absorb Knock Off from foes like Landorus-T. It also benefits from teammates like Ferrothorn and Landorus-T checking Dragonite. Great Tusk and Landorus-T can relieve Volcarona of pressure from Stealth Rock by using Rapid Spin and Defog respectively when Volcarona loses its Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>"

Thanks to Intimidate and a powerful Earthquake, Landorus-T has plentiful opportunities to pivot on forced switches with U-turn against threats like Iron Boulder and Galarian Slowking. Stone Edge hits Flying-types like Zapdos, Moltres, Mega Charizard Y, and Tornadus-T as well as Volcarona. Defog is very effective since most entry hazard setters like Heatran, Mega Diancie, and Garganacl don't like being hit by Earthquake, which prevents them from staying in against Landorus-T and gives it easy opportunities to Defog. Explosion as an alternative allows Landorus-T to trade with threats like Ogerpon-W, Darkrai, and Mega Lopunny as well as weakened checks like Gliscor, especially when Landorus-T is low HP. Tera Water removes Landorus-T's weakness against Water-types like Urshifu-R, Mega Swampert, and Hisuian Samurott, as well as common Ice-type moves like Ice Beam from Darkrai and Ice Shard from Weavile, and also gives Landorus-T a chance to revenge kill Volcarona. The given EVs make sure that Landorus-T outspeeds Zamazenta and survives a Choice Specs Moonblast from Iron Valiant and two Zen Headbutt from Mega Medicham after Stealth Rock. Teammates like Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Darkrai appreciate Landorus-T for bringing them in safely via U-turn. In return, they can threaten walls like Alomomola and Gliscor for Landorus-T. Landorus-T can be worn down quickly due to Stealth Rock and its lack of recovery, so teammates like Alomomola and Ferrothorn are helpful to protect it from being overwhelmed too quickly by foes like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny, both of which can also check Water-types like Mega Swampert for Landorus-T. Additionally, Alomomola can heal Landorus-T with Wish and form a pivoting core with it. Other pivots like Rotom-W and Iron Crown bring in Landorus-T safely and form VoltTurn cores with it.</p>"

Explosion lets Landorus-T deal massive damage once its job is done, being able to take a good chunk of damage out of almost any foe while also denying hazard removal from the aforementioned Defoggers and Rapid Spin from Great Tusk. Tera Ghost prevents any hazards on the field from being removed by Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk if it's unable to safely use Explosion on it. Ogerpon-W is great offensive partner, as itâ€™s able to come in on Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R which threatens Landorus-T. Volcarona is another solid teammate thatâ€™s able to switch into Weavileâ€™s Triple Axel and has a chance to burn it in the process.</p>"}

Surf, despite being weaker than Hydro Pump, is a solid option due to its reliability, while Hydro Pump is a stronger alternative despite its lower accuracy, as it allows Greninja to OHKO targets such as Mega Charizard Y under sun. Dark Pulse gives Greninja a strong neutral STAB move to hit common Water-resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Rotom-W, additionally wielding a nasty flinch chance to potentially break through them. Water Shuriken gives Greninja a priority option, crucial for revenge killing weakened targets that outspeed it like Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny, as well as getting the jump on other priority moves such as Weavile's Ice Shard and the aforementioned Mega Lopunny's Quick Attack. Ice Beam is Greninja's coverage move of choice, being its strongest option versus Pokemon like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Dragonite. Tera Water is the preferred Tera type, giving a significant boost to both of Greninja's Water-type STAB moves to potentially secure KOs on targets like Mega Charizard Y in sun and Tapu Lele after a Battle Bond activation with Surf. Greninja can also serve as a potent albeit niche wallbreaker on rain teams, with rain boosting the power of its Water-type STAB moves to ridiculous levels. This allows teammates like Mega Swampert and Zapdos to clean up the weakened defensive cores consisting of Pokemon like Rotom-W and Galarian Slowking. However, Greninja alone can struggle to break through sturdier Water-resistant foes like Tera Water Garganacl, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn, so teammates like Tapu Koko, Gholdengo, and Heatran that can capitalize on Greninja forcing these foes in function well as teammates on certain offensive compositions.</p>"

Rock Slide deals with Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. Aside from enabling Greninja to pivot, U-turn also provides coverage against Mega Tyranitar, Mega Gyarados, and opposing Greninja. The Special Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO against Kartana with Ice Beam. Terastallizing is mainly used to improve its offensive capabilities; for instance, Tera Poison gives Gunk Shot significant odds to OHKO specially defensive Tera Grass Heatran, Clefable, and Tera Fairy Garganacl after Stealth Rock, while Tera Ice boosts Ice Beam to OHKO Dragapult and physically defensive Tangrowth and Great Tusk. Wallbreakers like Garchomp, Zamazenta, Tapu Lele, and Mega Charizard Y appreciate Greninja's U-turn bringing them in safely on foes like Heatran, Garganacl, Toxapex, and Gholdengo, respectively. Garchomp also provides entry hazards to punish Greninja's forced switches, chipping down the likes of Garganacl and Heatran. In return, Greninja outpaces faster threats like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult that would otherwise overwhelm them. Greninja can form a VoltTurn core with Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Mega Scizor; the former two also provide Defog so Greninja can pivot more freely, especially if running Tera Ice.</p>"

Its high-powered STAB movesâ€”which can be boosted further by Swords Danceâ€”hit almost the entire metagame neutrally; Acrobatics grants Hawlucha strong neutral coverage against the likes of Tornadus-T, Dragapult, and Tapu Lele, which is backed up by Close Combat to decimate Flying-resistant Pokemon like Kingambit, Garganacl, and Mega Tyranitar. Its item instantly activates Unburden under the corresponding Terrain and grants it setup opportunities from the Defense boost, especially in conjunction with Roost. Electric Seed helps against Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Great Tusk and prevents revenge killing attempts from Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Weavile's Ice Shard, while Psychic Seed helps against Gholdengo, Volcarona, and Choice-locked Dragapult. Taunt or Substitute deals with problematic walls, ignoring status like Toxapex's Toxic and Skeledirge's Will-O-Wisp; Taunt also prevents their recovery and phazing as well as Defense-boosting attempts such as from Skarmory or Tera Water Buzzwole, while Substitute blocks Landorus-T's Intimidate and punishes the use of weak attacks like its U-turn, Garganacl's Salt Cure, and Alomomola's Scald. The bulk investment allows Hawlucha to survive Clefable's Moonblast, which is unnecessary if running Psychic Seed. 176 Speed EVs can be used instead to revenge kill +1 Dragon Dance Dragapult. Tera Flying boosts Hawlucha's Acrobatics, potentially OHKOing Clefable at +2 and letting it set up against defensive Tornadus-T if necessary. The corresponding Alolan Guardian is a mandatory teammate to reliably activate Hawlucha's Unburden; Tapu Koko provides dual screens and brings Hawlucha in safely on Tangrowth and Ferrothorn with U-turn, while Tapu Lele pressures Toxapex and overwhelms Gholdengo. Offensive Pokemon on hyper offense teams such as Iron Valiant, Volcarona, Dragonite, and Mega Gyarados help maintain offensive pressure against the opposition; notably, they can force damage onto shared checks like Gholdengo, Skeledirge, Zapdos, and Toxapex, respectively, for Hawlucha to sweep more easily.</p>"

Alternatively, Earth Power significantly dents or OHKOes Heatran and hits Gholdengo and Clodsire harder. Mega Diancie acts as an excellent entry hazard stacker, as it takes advantage of the switches it forces and threatens out common entry hazard removers such as Tornadus-T and Great Tusk. Mega Diancie can use Spikes or Stealth Rock to weaken checks such as Mega Scizor and Heatran, depending on its coverage move, while punishing them for attempting to pivot into it. A Naive nature is preferred, as it allows Mega Diancie to take less damage from common priority moves in Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Mega Lopunny's Fake Out. However, Mega Diancie can also use Hasty in order to sponge Hurricane from Tornadus-T. Mega Diancie fits best on bulky offense and offense teams, which appreciate its early- or mid-game wallbreaking and ability to set entry hazards. Pokemon that appreciate Mega Diancie weakening common Steel-types such as Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult pair well with it, using their higher Speed tiers to clean late-game. Additionally, Mega Diancie pairs well with Knock Off users like Tornadus-T and Kingambit, as they make Mega Diancie's entry hazards more effective and force checks such as Toxapex and Clodsire to succumb to them. Mega Diancie can struggle with entering the field given its relative frailty and poor defensive typing, which also gives it a tendency to be revenge killed by Pokemon like Mega Swampert and Zamazenta.

That said, Hoopa-U competes with Kingambit, which has significantly higher bulk and a way to bypass its Speed tier issue in Sucker Punch. Hoopa-U has a 4x weakness to U-turn and neutrality to Pursuit, meaning it cannot enter or leave the field easily. Nonetheless, Hoopa-U does not require setup, and it therefore has a niche into bulkier teams thanks to its immediate power. Drain Punch lets Hoopa-U take on Dark-types that would otherwise wall it, such as Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar, and Zen Headbutt hammers Zamazenta, Great Tusk, Buzzwole, and Toxapex while also hitting Clefable and Tera Fairy Garganacl neutrally. Gunk Shot provides Hoopa-U with another way to break through Fairy-types such as Tera Fairy Garganacl and Clefable. Tera Dark powers up Hoopa-U's Hyperspace Fury while giving it a resistance to Pursuit. Hoopa-U fits well on bulky offense teams, which appreciate its power allowing teammates to clean. As such, partners such as Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele pair well with Hoopa-U.

Hoopa-U also has trouble getting into the field due to its low Speed and frail physical bulk, so pivots such as Mega Scizor and Rotom-W are appreciated to bring it in Hoopa-U more consistently. Rotom-W also pivots into Toxapex and Heatran to bring in Hoopa-U, while Mega Scizor pivots into Tapu Lele and Kingambit and brings in Heatran and Skeledirge for Hoopa-U to break through. Entry hazard setters are also appreciated, as Hoopa-U can more easily break through defensive teams with Spikes or Stealth Rock on the field.

Its typing in particular allows it to check common Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, and Urshifu-R while its utility moves like Knock Off and Toxic let it cripple them to benefit teammates. Scald can cripple physical attackers like Garchomp and Mega Medicham, discouraging them from directly switching in to take advantage of Toxapex. Scaldâ€™s damage output reduces Toxapex's passivity and is also just enough to threaten Water-weak foes like Landorus-T, Iron Boulder, and Mega Diancie; this allows Toxapex to use Recover or Toxic with general safety. Knock Off allows Toxapex to remove valuable items like Choice items, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Leftovers from switch-ins like Tapu Lele, Zapdos, and Ferrothorn. Toxic Spikes allows Toxapex to pressure offensive teams, forcing them to give up momentum to clear it lest they get poisoned. Haze prevents setup sweepers like Gouging Fire and Iron Valiant from exploiting Toxapex, forcing them to attack, and disrupts wincons like IronPress Zamazenta and Volcarona. An EV spread of 248 HP / 212 Def / 48 SpD with a Bold nature allows Toxapex to maximize its physical bulk while surviving two Scorching Sands from Mega Charizard Y. On the other hand, 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature simply maximizes special bulk. 248 HP EVs are important as it reduces entry hazard damage while benefiting more from Regenerator. Tera Dragon is useful to check Ogerpon-W and Mega Charizard Y, the latter of which is especially important on specially defensive sets, Tera Fairy helps versus Raging Bolt and Garchomp, and Tera Steel lets it check Serperior and Tapu Lele. The former two are also notable for removing Toxapexâ€™s Ground weakness versus the likes of Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Toxapex, by nature of being a fat wall with little offensive presence, fits like a glove on stall and balance playstyles, sapping momentum but providing valuable utility. Allies on balance that can take advantage of Toxapex through double switches, like Ogerpon-W, Urshifu-R, and Mega Tyranitar, benefit from Toxapex baiting in Ground- and Psychic-types; by using Toxapex as a mid-ground, they can enter the field safely as the opponent switches to a Toxapex check like Gliscor and Choice item Tapu Lele. Teammates that help with the Ground and Psychic weaknesses on the defensive side, such as Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, are useful as well; in return, Toxapex tanks hits from Ice- and Fighting-types like Weavile, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny for them.</p>"

Its ability to set up on common Pokemon like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Volcarona and to potentially use Tera Steel to ignore Toxic from defensive Pokemon like Heatran and Toxapex allows it to start wallbreaking very early with its powerful coverage. Throat Spray grants an extra Special Attack boost when using Clangorous Soul, whereas Kommonium Z gives it Clangorous Soulblaze, which allows it to deal heavy damage while boosting its stats. Boomburst lets Kommo-o neutrally hit much of the metagame for large damage, which, when coupled with STAB Clanging Scales and Flamethrower as coverage for Steel-types, can easily break cores featuring the likes of Great Tusk, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and more. Bulletproof along with Tera Steel allows Kommo-o to wall Choice Scarf Tapu Lele looking to revenge kill it as well as set up in front of Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult. Tera Normal gives Kommo-o a stronger Boomburst, while Tera Steel gives it a Toxic immunity and useful resistances to all of its weaknesses, allowing Kommo-o to take would-be checks, such as Dragapult, Tapu Lele, Baxcalibur, and Iron Valiant, by surprise and set up in front of them. However, Kommo-o likes to use its Tera and thus denies its teammates this option, and it can be checked by a well-timed Tera from Pokemon such as Tera Steel Garchomp and subsequently be revenge killed. It is also walled by the likes of Heatran, Garganacl, and Clodsire, which can tank its coverage options even without Terastallizing and cripple it with Toxic or Salt Cure or simply force it out and deny future setup opportunities. Finally, due to the nature of Kommo-oâ€™s setup, it can only reasonably do so once per game, making Kommo-o more suited for offensive teams. Thus, having allies that can take care of Kommo-oâ€™s defensive checks before it sets up can allow it to do its job much more effectively; physical attackers like Iron Valiant, offensive Landorus-T, and Samurott-H can pressure and remove checks for Kommo-o to break and potentially sweep. Hazard support is also valuable in preventing opponents from switching back and forth between Pokemon in a Regenerator core; in particular, Assault Vest Tornadus + Toxapex; Pokemon like Great Tusk and Garchomp can set up Stealth Rock to pressure switches.</p>"

The HP cuts from Substitute and Belly Drum will immediately activate Salac Berry, giving Kommo-o maximum Attack along with increased Speed to sweep offensive and defensive teams alike. Substitute also allows Kommo-o to dodge status moves like Ferrothornâ€™s Leech Seed, Garganacl's Salt Cure, Landorus-T's Toxic, and Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp that could potentially ruin Kommo-oâ€™s sweep, instead giving it a free set up opportunity. Drain Punch is chosen over heavier hitting moves like Close Combat, as the extra damage is not needed, and Drain Punch can heal off the HP lost through Belly Drum and Substitute, making Kommo-o harder to revenge kill. Thunder Punch is used to dent and possibly KO common defensive tanks that can survive Drain Punch, like Skarmory, Toxapex, Tera Water Garganacl, Gholdengo, and Tera Flying Kingambit. Bulletproof stacked on top of Tera Steel allows Kommo-o to surprise opponents like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Choice Specs Dragapult looking to revenge kill it. Although Soundproof blocks moves such as Roar from defensive Garchomp and Bug Buzz from Volcarona, it is generally not preferred due to the lack of relevant sound-based moves in comparison to the bevy of aforementioned qualities gained from Bulletproof. Tera Electric can power up Thunder Punch with STAB to score KOs on the likes of Gholdengo, Tapu Lele, and Tera Fairy Kingambit, while Tera Steel gives it useful resistances that may allow it to reach Salac Berry range without Substitute by tanking a resisted hit from the likes of Tapu Lele or Mega Diancie. Belly Drum Kommo-o fits on hyper offensive teams that appreciate its ability to sweep or clean up teams once its checks are removed. Therefore, it appreciates partners that can lure and remove Pokemon like Clodsire, Tera Grass Heatran, Gliscor, and Landorus-T that check it; Tapu Koko in particular is good, as it can run Hidden Power Ice to bait and KO the latter two and badly chip the former two potentially into Kommo-oâ€™s range while also boosting the power of its Thunder Punch by setting Electric Terrain. Belly Drum Kommo-o also has trouble setting up, as it mainly uses the element of surprise to get up a Substitute â€”namely, it exploits the opponent's fear of Clangorous Soulblaze and thus forces them to switch. Thus, it appreciates dual screens support from the likes of Grimmsnarl in order to more consistently set up Belly Drum.</p>"

Grass Knot hits foes such as Gastrodon, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Swampert, and it takes advantage of Tera Grass to potentially break Ting-Lu. Alternatively, Dazzling Gleam allows Tapu Koko to OHKO Mega Medicham and Weavile after Stealth Rock, and it dents other foes such as Tera Dragon Toxapex and Garchomp. Hidden Power Ice improves the matchup against Landorus-T and Gliscor while still hitting foes such as Garchomp, Tangrowth, and Dragonite. Tera Grass boosts the power of Grass Knot while granting Tapu Koko key resistances, allowing it to lure foes such as Barraskewda, Floatzel, and Mega Swampert, all while improving its matchup against Rotom-W. Tapu Koko must be careful when using Tera, however, as it becomes unable to safely switch into Tornadus-T once it Terastallizes. Pokemon that utilize Electric Terrain such as Iron Valiant, Iron Hands, and Mega Medicham make for excellent teammates, as it activates Quark Drive for the former two and increases the power of Thunder Punch for the latter, 2HKOing foes such as Gholdengo. Tapu Koko also forms strong pivoting cores with teammates like Tornadus-T and Mega Lopunny, which take advantage of its checks such as Ferrothorn and Clodsire to generate momentum.

Taunt denies Defog from foes such as Tornadus-T and Rotom-W while also denying entry hazards from foes such as Ferrothorn. It also prevents foes such as Dragonite and Volcarona from using Tapu Koko as setup fodder. U-turn allows Tapu Koko to generate momentum and pivot into teammates such as Volcarona and Dragapult after setting screens. Tapu Koko will very rarely use Tera since teammates such as Dragonite or Volcarona rely on it to be effective. In a pinch, however, Tera Flying offers a Ground immunity for foes such as Clodsire. Pokemon that take advantage of dual screens, such as Volcarona, Dragonite, and Dragapult, are good partners, as they allow them to set up safely and survive potential revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Kingambit, and Mega Scizor. Iron Valiant also benefits greatly from Tapu Koko setting Electric Terrain in addition to dual screens. Tapu Koko is also weak to Stealth Rock setters such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, and it can have difficulty denying entry hazards from them, so it appreciates teammates such as Dragonite and Gyarados pivoting in to Ground-type attacks from them.</p>"

Additionally, Psychic Terrain blocks priority moves like Mega Lopunny's Fake Out and Weavile's Ice Shard, which is useful for Tapu Lele itself and teammates that aim for a sweep such as Hawlucha and Volcarona. Focus Blast lets Tapu Lele hit common Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Psyshock allows Tapu Lele to hit foes with weaker Defense stats like Assault Vest Tornadus-T and Volcarona, along with shutting down Calm Mind Tera Poison Cresselia. Future Sight can be used to hit in tandem with teammates such as Urshifu-R and Zamazenta, threatening Toxapex and Zapdos looking to switch into their attacks. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire nails Mega Scizor along with hitting Ferrothorn more consistently than Focus Blast. Tera Psychic is the premier Tera option, as it boosts Tapu Lele's Psychic STAB attacks to ludicrous heights, smashing through most neutral targets such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Tapu Koko. Tera Fairy is a niche alternative, boosting Moonblast to powerful levels while minimizing the threat of Pursuit from Mega Tyranitar and Weavile. Despite having Focus Blast, Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn are still effective checks to Tapu Lele, so teammates such as Gliscor and Mega Lopunny can be used to mitigate this. Hawlucha can both utilize Psychic Terrain to activate Unburden while helping break through Mega Scizor, allowing Tapu Lele to clean up with ease late-game.</p>"

Hidden Power Fire can OHKO most Mega Scizor and deal heavy damage to Ferrothorn without the chance of missing, unlike Focus Blast. Focus Blast hits Heatran and Ferrothorn and OHKOes Mega Tyranitar. Psyshock can hit Galarian Slowking, 2HKO Chansey, and OHKO Assault Vest Tornadus-T. Future Sight can help teammates like Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny wallbreak, as it deals good damage to switch-ins like Alomomola, Toxapex, and Landorus-T. Late-game cleaners like Mega Lopunny, Volcarona, Urshifu-R, and Bulk Up Great Tusk really appreciate Tapu Lele's ability to force damage onto would-be checks such as Corviknight and Heatran. However, Tapu Lele is very prediction reliant and can often invite in Steel-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Iron Crown, and Mega Scizor. Additionally, it struggles against common revenge killers such as Urshifu-R, Ogerpon-W, and Mega Lopunny. Therefore, a strong defensive core is recommended when building around Tapu Lele to minimize the impact of these offensive threats, especially having a switch-in to the aforementioned Steel-types that may come in on a Psychic or Moonblast. Good switch-ins to these include Heatran and Alomomola, with the latter serving as a pivot with Flip Turn to safely get Tapu Lele on the field against passive foes like Toxapex and Gliscor.</p>"

Fightinium Z in tandem with Focus Blast allows Tapu Lele to reliably OHKO Ferrothorn and Heatran, and heavily damage Mega Scizor and Ting-Lu. Although Tapu Lele is a fearsome wallbreaker, it requires a Calm Mind boost to heavily damage the majority of the metagame, so Pokemon that can provide it a setup opportunity via pivoting such as Urshifu-R, Gliscor, and Alomomola are beneficial. Tapu Lele is also very prone to getting revenge killed by physical attackers that can bypass Tapu Lele's Special Defense boosts, such as Zamazenta, Kartana, and Weavile, so teammates such as Zapdos, Moltres, and Toxapex are appreciated.</p>"}

Close Combat hits Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Kingambit and Stone Edge threaten Flying-types like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Dragonite while letting Tapu Bulu beat Volcarona. Rockium Z gives Tapu Bulu a strong nuke, allowing it to break through Zapdos more reliably while also OHKOing would-be checks like Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y on the switch-in. Fightinium Z, on the other hand, helps it break through Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor and KOes Heatran after luring it in. Leftovers gives Tapu Bulu more passive recovery, allowing it to set up multiple times against more balanced teams. The given EV spread ensures Tapu Bulu outspeeds Magnezone and Mega Tyranitar while optimizing its bulk. Tera Water retains Tapu Bulu's utility against rain while making it resist Ice-types moves from Pokemon like Weavile and Fire-type moves from Heatran and Volcarona, while Tera Steel avoids Toxic, grants a helpful Flying resistance against the lieks of Tornadus-T and Zados, and synergizes well with Grassy Terrain, as it weakens Earthquake. Both options also let it resist Make It Rain from Gholdengo, allowing Tapu Bulu to win against it thanks to Horn Leech's recovery. Tapu Bulu fits best on offense and bulky offense teams, which appreciate its strong wallbreaking capability. Heatran checks Fire-types like Volcarona and Skeledirge, Flying-types like Tornadus-T, and appreciates Grassy Terrain weakening Earthquake. In return, Tapu Bulu can check Rotom-W and Urshifu-R, using them as setup fodder. Kartana synergizes well with Tapu Bulu, as Tapu Bulu can break through most of Kartana's checks thanks to Z-Moves (added hyphen) and boosts its Leaf Blade with Grassy Terrain, letting Kartana clean with its Choice Scarf set. In the same vein, Mega Scizor works well with Tapu Bulu, as together they can overwhelm their common checks, like Zapdos and Heatran.</p>"

It can outspeed and revenge kill foes like Mega Lopunny, Dragapult, Garchomp, and Iron Valiant while using its typing and remarkable bulk to switch into Pokemon like Heatran, Weavile, and Urshifu-R. Other than shutting down problematic setup sweepers like Volcarona, Trick + Taunt improves Tapu Fini's matchup against defensive Pokemon by crippling and shutting down switch-ins such as Ferrothorn, Clodsire, and Toxapex, especially with Misty Terrain to protect it and its teammates against theirs and the likes of Rotom-W, Heatran, and Gastrodon's status moves. If the team lacks an entry hazard remover, Tapu Fini can run Defog if necessary, as it matches up well against entry hazard setters like Heatran, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. However, its vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards and lack of longevity make it a poor candidate to do it consistently. Ice Beam can be run to potentially 2HKO offensive Tornadus-T and OHKO Landorus-T, while Nature's Madness is an option to dent its checks hardâ€”especially ones that lack reliable recoveryâ€”such as Ferrothorn, Galarian Slowking, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. However, forgoing Taunt or Defog loses out on Tapu Fini's utility, which makes shutting down walls and supporting its team needlessly more difficult. Tera Steel allows Tapu Fini to emergency check threats like Tapu Lele and Nasty Plot Tornadus-T; it also provides a better defensive typing against walls like Toxapex and Ferrothorn, which is more useful if using Taunt. The Speed EVs allow Tapu Fini to outspeed +1 Mega Gyarados, while the Special Attack EVs allow it to KO Urshifu-R after Stealth Rock. Gholdengo, Tornadus-T, and Ferrothorn are great teammates to deal with faster threats like boosted Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf users such as Kartana, Tapu Lele, and Landorus-T; Ferrothorn also provides Spikes to chip down foes like Ferrothorn, Garchomp, and Garganacl into Tapu Fini's KO range, compensating for its middling damage output. Offensive teammates like Volcarona, Kartana, and Weavile love its Misty Terrain to protect them against debilitating status from walls like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Skeledirge, letting them set up and attack more safely; Volcarona also enjoys Tapu Fini luring in and crippling their shared checks like Toxapex and Clodsire with Trick, while Choice Band Weavile appreciates Tapu Fini removing Stealth Rock with Defog.</p>"

Bulk Up accumulates boosts alongside Pokemon such as Howl Zamazenta, Dragon Dance Dragapult, and defensive Mega Scizor, meaning they cannot overwhelm Buzzwole. Toxic is a niche alternative if Buzzwole's team wishes to play more proactively, as it cripples the likes of Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, and Skeledirge that would otherwise take advantage of Buzzwole. Heavy-Duty Boots ignores entry hazards, letting Buzzwole consistently switch into the Pokemon it gets tasked to counter without being worn down. Tera Water gives Buzzwole a Water resistance, allowing it to wall Pokemon such as Urshifu-R, Floatzel, and Barraskewda in rain. The given EV spread maximizes Buzzwole's physical bulk while ensuring it always outspeeds Kingambit. Buzzwole fits best on defensive teams, which appreciate it as a fallback measure against the myriad of physical wallbreakers while not caring for its relative passivity. Pokemon such as Clodsire and Hippowdon can shore up Buzzwole's weakness to common special attackers such as Mega Diancie, Dragapult, and Tapu Koko. Buzzwole appreciates pivots such as Toxapex, Tornadus-T, and Gliscor, which can absorb chip damage from moves like Scald, Salt Cure andâ€”for the latter twoâ€”Knock Off.

Giga Impact can be used in conjunction with Normalium Z to turn into a devastating Breakneck Blitz, slicing through Flying-type answers such as Tornadus-T, Dragonite, and Zapdos. Knock Off is an alternative to KO Gholdengo and Dragapult reliably, as well as pressure checks such as Skeledirge and Tornadus-T.

Sacred Sword hits Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Kingambit. Smart Strike can be used as Kartana's strongest option against Dragonite and Buzzwole.

With its impressive 181 Attack stat, Kartana is often able to force opposing entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon and Clodsire out and take advantage of this to use Defog. Furthermore, its resistance to Stealth Rock and immunity to Toxic Spikes helps Kartana to switch into entry hazards multiple times. Synthesis provides Kartana with longevity, especially when paired with sun, which allows it to even outheal damage from defensive Landrous-T and Great Tusk's Earthquake. Grassium Z makes up for its loss in power and enables it to pick off weakened walls like Toxapex and Landorus-T, as well as threatening common Stealth Rock users such as Garchomp, Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Clodsire. Knock Off hits Gholdengo for super effective damage. Sacred Sword can be used as an alternative choice to hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran, which Kartana otherwise struggles with. However, missing out on hitting Gholdengo makes it less helpful in the current metagame. 120 Attack EVs allow Kartana to OHKO offensive Garchomp with Bloom Doom. while the HP investment ensures that Kartana survives Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's Psychic even after taking Stealth Rock damage. Mega Charizard Y has great synergy with this set, since it appreciates Kartana's ability to keep the field clear of Stealth Rock whilst also muscling through common special walls in Chansey and Clodsire. In return, Drought boosts Kartana's longevity by increasing the amount of HP Synthesis recovers. Kartana can also switch into rock moves against Mega charizard Y from opposing Garchomp and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, while Mega Charizard Y removes Steel- and Grass-Type walls such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth that this set struggles with. Due to its poor Special Defence, Kartana is vulnerable to special attackers that outspeed it, like Tornadus-T and Iron Valiant. This requires it to be paired with a good special wall that can check those threats, such as Tapu Fini or Slowking.

On the other hand, Leftovers provides increased longevity for Rillaboom, allowing it to setup multiple times throughout a game. Tera Grass gives Rillaboom an even stronger Grassy Glide, allowing it to storm through most offensive teams that have limited resistances to it. Some Flying-resistant Tera types such as Steel and Electric can punish Zapdos and Tornadus-T, but they are usually suboptimal and don't benefit Rillaboom's offensive power. Magnezone works well with this set, as it can trap and remove Steel-types like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor. Hawlucha is a good partner as well, as Grassy Seed will activate Hawlucha's Unburden thanks to Grassy Terrain and Rillaboom can weaken their shared check in Zapdos so it can clean late-game.

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Corviknight is a poor Defogger in the metagame, but its defensive profile still allows it to check Mega Lopunny, Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Kartana. It also individually beats hazard setters like Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Clodsire. Brave Bird is the preferred option that pressures Dragapult, Zamazenta, Urshifu-R, and Iron Valiant, while Body Press pressures Kingambit, Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Weavile. Iron Defense or Bulk Up can be used over Defog to turn Corviknight into a bulky win condition and to improve its ability to check threats like Kingambit, Urshifu-R, and Dragon Dance Dragapult. Body Press should be used with Iron Defense, while Brave Bird can instead be used with Bulk Up. U-turn allows Corviknight to maintain momentum against the threats that it checks while also bringing in frailer teammates. The given HP and Defense EVs allow Corviknight to live a +2 Continental Crush from Landorus-T, while the rest of the EVs being in Special Defense helps out against Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant. Rocky Helmet allows Corviknight to chip threats like Mega Lopunny and Weavile. Tera Dragon removes Corviknight's Electric and Fire weaknesses and potentially allows it to turn the tables on Heatran and Rotom-W. Tera Ground can instead be used to halt Volt Switch attempts and surprise Tapu Koko, but the resistances it grants are not as consistently valuable as Dragon. Corviknight's biggest problem by far is Gholdengo, which blocks Corviknight's Defog attempts and sets up on it. Options that deal with it, such as Kingambit, Weavile, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire are therefore mandatory partners. U-turn can bring in the former two to Pursuit trap Gholdengo, while the latter two can stave it off defensively. Kingambit is especially potent with Corviknight, as it appreciates Corviknight's Rocky Helmet applying chip damage onto its checks like Mega Lopunny and Zamazenta. U-turn can also bring in other threats safely, such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Heatran. Corviknight's defensive profile gets taken advantage of by threats like Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona, so options such as your own Heatran, Garchomp, and Toxapex can help out in this regard.</p>"

      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>Corviknight is a formidable wincon that takes advantage of its typing and impressive bulk to garner boosts. It also provides a sturdy defensive backbone, consistently checking threats such as Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Dragonite. However, as Corviknight lacks immediate offensive presence and coverage, it suffers from being forced out by the likes of Zapdos and Heatran and being setup fodder from the likes of Kingambit and Gholdengo. Pressure, in conjunction with Substitute, allows Corviknight to PP stall checks like Heatran and Skarmory safely while bypassing status moves like Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp and Clefable's Thunder Wave. Tera Water improves the matchup against Heatran, Weavile, and Urshifu-R, giving crucial resistances to safely let Corviknight boost up. Alternatively, Tera Dragon lets it take on Electric-types like Zapdos and Rotom-W while also helping against Heatran and Urshifu-R. However, Pokemon like Mega Diancie, Weavile, and Dragapult can now almost always force it out, though they do have to watch out for repeated Brave Bird hits. The given EV spread maximizes special bulk while still being able to survive a +2 Continental Crush from Garchomp followed by Stone Edge after Roost; it also lets Corviknight outspeed Skarmory and become only 3HKOed by Great Tusk's Close Combat. However, note that Corviknight will be taking a super effective Body Press from Skarmory after using Roost. Corviknight fits best on bulkier teams, which appreciate its ability to PP stall threats like Heatran and Toxapex while being a solid wincon. Pokemon like Toxapex and Clefable thus work well with it. Toxapex appreciates Corviknight reliably checking Tapu Lele and Landorus-T for it. In return, Toxapex helps check Weavile, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny, which Corviknight struggles to do. Calm Mind Clefable loves Corviknight draining PP from opposing Toxapexâ€™s Haze; in return, it softens up Heatran. Ground-types like Gliscor and Great Tusk make excellent partners, as they absorb Electric attacks from the likes of Tapu Koko and remove entry hazards from the field. In exchange, Corviknight helps take Kyurem and Iron Valiantâ€™s attacks. Due to Corviknight being walled by Electric- and Steel-types, such as Zapdos and Gholdengo, partners that can threaten them such as Mega Tyranitar and Heatran work well with it.</p>"

Its blistering Speed tier allows it to nearly outpace the entire metagame under rain, including boosted foes like Dragon Dance Dragapult and Mega Swampert. Liquidation's Defense drop lets it potentially 2HKO Pokemon such as Dragapult and Pelipper, while Waterfall's flinches gives Barraskewda slightly better odds to muscle past the likes of Slowbro and Toxapex. Flip Turn keeps up momentum by providing free entry for its teammates while chipping down switch-ins like Dondozo and Tangrowth. Close Combat hits Water-resistant foes such as Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Mega Gyarados, and it provides strong neutral coverage against the likes of Tera Water Great Tusk, Tera Grass Volcarona, and Gastrodon. Aqua Jet prevents Barraskewda from being revenge killed by priority attacks like Kingambit and Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch andâ€”if rain is not activeâ€”lets it pick off faster threats such as Sand Rush Excadrill and boosted Volcarona and Iron Valiant. Alternatively, Psychic Fangs pressures Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Water Absorb Clodsire better. Tera Water skyrockets Barraskewda's rain-boosted STAB moves further, potentially 2HKOing even Water-resistant Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Pelipper is a necessary teammate that spearheads rain teams by reliably summoning rain with Drizzle. Mega Swampert is a fantastic offensive partner that can overwhelm shared checks like Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Slowbro and appreciates Barraskewda's Flip Turn to bring it in safely on foes such as Toxapex, Dragapult, and Dragonite. Tornadus-T and Ferrothorn are rain team staples that support Barraskewda with Knock Off, crippling walls such as Rotom-W and opposing Ferrothorn; Ferrothorn in particular helps threaten Gastrodon with Power Whip and sets entry hazards to soften up foes. The aforementioned Pelipper and Tornadus-T also provide Defog support for Barraskewda to pivot throughout the game unperturbed, bring it in safely via U-turn, and threatens problematic Grass-types like Tangrowth and Tera Grass Heatran.</p>"

Healing Wish gives Hatterene the ability to fully heal one of its teammates, giving wallbreakers and setup Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Kingambit another chance to break through the opposing team. Mystical Fire is generally preferred over Dazzling Gleam to hit Gholdengo, Ferrothorn, and Kingambit on the switch, but Dazzling Gleam can be used to threaten Dragonite, Garchomp, and Dragapult. Nuzzle provides Hatterene with a way to punish Pokemon that would safely pivot into it otherwise, such as Heatran and Tornadus-T. Eject Button gives Hatterene the ability to take a hit and pivot into a teammate, letting frail wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y and Weavile come onto the field. Tera Steel removes Hatterene's weaknesses to Ghost and Steel, letting it pass a Healing Wish or cripple an opposing Pokemon such as Dragapult and Gholdengo while retaining its advantage against Dragon-types, though typically you would want to Terastallize a teammate for more offensive pressure. The given EV spread lets Hatterene outspeed Garganacl and Toxapex while maximizing its ability to pivot into physical attacks. Hatterene greatly benefits teams that rely on keeping entry hazards off the field, such as sun teams and some offense teams. As such, Mega Charizard Y is a fantastic partner, as it appreciates Hatterene keeping Stealth Rock off the field and walling Toxapex; in return, it is able to pressure Pokemon Hatterene brings in, such as Gholdengo and Kingambit. Focus Sash users such as Polteageist and Cloyster also make for good teammates thanks to Hatterene's ability to keep off hazards. Similarly, pivots such as Tapu Lele and Dragapult appreciate Hatterene's ability to keep off hazards and give them a second chance with Healing Wish, letting them come in safely and consistently. Hatterene's lack of longevity means that it usually cannot act as the sole form of hazard control. As such, Rapid Spin Great Tusk is a good partner alongside Hatterene for keeping hazards off of the field while also being able to support Mega Charizard Y on sun teams.</p>"

Magic Bounce gives Hatterene a way to switch into entry hazard setters, utilize Calm Mind to force them out, and avoid status from Pokemon such as Garchomp and Toxapex. Psyshock lets Hatterene beat opposing Calm Mind and Quiver Dance sweepers like Iron Valiant and Volcarona, while Stored Power lets it bypass Skeledirge with enough Calm Mind boosts. Mystical Fire hits Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Ferrothorn super effectively. Draining Kiss acts as a form of recovery for Hatterene. Tera Water gives Hatterene a solid defensive typing while removing its weakness to Steel-type attacks from the likes of Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Mega Scizor. The given EV spread lets Hatterene outspeed Garganacl and Toxapex, letting Hatterene take out Toxapex with an attack before having its boosts removed by Haze. Hatterene works well when paired with Pokemon that dislike entry hazards, such as defensive Pokemon without Heavy-Duty Boots. These include partners like Toxapex and Garganacl, which can check other offensive and defensive Pokemon, giving Hatterene the leeway for a late-game sweep. Flyinium Z Tornadus-T appreciates Hatterene being able to Terastallize to force opposing Gholdengo to Terastallize, as well as keeping hazards off the field for it. Kingambit and Garganacl are great partners for their ability to reliably check Ghost-types like Dragapult and Gholdengo, with Kingambit even being able to Pursuit trap them. Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Mega Scizor can check Kingambit for Hatterene as well. Hatterene's lack of longevity outside of Draining Kiss means that it appreciates a secondary form of entry hazard removal from teammates such as Tornadus-T, Zapdos, Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T. Alternatively, Hatterene enjoys pairing up with Spikes users such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory, as they pressure the opponent into using Defog, alleviating Hatterene's need to block entry hazards, as well as wearing down Hatterene's answers such as Heatran and Gholdengo.</p>"

Taunt denies Defog from foes such as Rotom-W and Tornadus-T and denies entry hazards from foes such as Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Hippowdon. It also prevents foes such as Volcarona and Annihilape from using Grimmsnarl as setup fodder. Spirit Break chips foes such as Ting-Lu and makes it easier to set up dual screens in front of special attackers such as Tapu Lele. Parting Shot can be used to pivot into teammates such as Dragonite, Dragapult, and Mega Scizor after setting screens, but it lets Dark-types such as Mega Tyranitar and Weavileâ€”as well as Annihilapeâ€”exploit it, hindering its effectiveness. Superpower lets Grimmsnarl OHKO Kingambit after Stealth Rock, but it is ineffective outside of this matchup and is hard to justify over other alternatives. Grimmsnarl will very rarely Terastallize since teammates such as Dragonite take advantage of it far better. In a pinch, however, Tera Steel reverses its weaknesses and provides an overall solid defensive typing, which helps against foes such as Tapu Lele and Gholdengo. Tera Ghost is an alternative that prevents opposing Great Tusk from removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Teammates that take advantage of dual screen support such as Mega Scizor, Volcarona, Dragonite, and Kingambit make good partners, setting up safely and avoiding potential revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and opposing Kingambit. Mega Scizor is a particularly good partner, handling foes such as Kingambit that use Grimmsnarl as setup fodder. Grimmsnarl has difficulty denying entry hazards from foes such as Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu, so it appreciates teammates such as Cyclizar clearing hazards from the field. Cyclizar also appreciates dual screen support from Grimmsnarl making it more difficult for foes to break the Substitute it passes to teammates.</p>"

Slush Rush lets Arctozolt outspeed the entire unboosted metagame under snow, including foes such as Dragapult and Weavile, though its inability to outspeed boosted foes such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and its pitiful Speed outside of snow hinders its sweeping potential. Freeze-Dry is an alternative to Blizzard that lets Arctozolt break through foes such as Gastrodon and Mega Swampert, but the lack of consistency outside of these matchups makes it a less desirable choice. Low Kick provides coverage for foes such as Ferrothorn, Kingambit, and Mega Tyranitar. Substitute takes advantage of forced switches against foes such as the aforementioned Toxapex and Tornadus-T to ease prediction and avoid potential revenge killers such as the aforementioned Tapu Lele, Mega Scizor, and Mega Lopunny. The Defense boost from snow also helps preserve Arctozolt's Substitute, granting it more safe turns. Heavy-Duty Boots alleviates Arctozolt's major Stealth Rock weakness, granting it more opportunities to wallbreak. Alternatively, Leftovers can be used with entry hazard control to improve Arctozolt's longevity and grant more opportunities to use Substitute. Tera Electric is used to boost Bolt Beak's power and remove Arctozolt's weakness to Stealth Rock, but it loses the Defense boost from snow. Slowking is a mandatory teammate to support Arctozolt, setting snow and acting as a slow pivot to grant it safe entry. Mega Diancie provides entry hazard support to weaken foes such as Ferrothorn and helps deny opposing entry hazards for Arctozolt. Arctozolt struggles against revenge killers such as Mega Scizor and Choice Scarf Kartana, so it appreciates teammates such as Heatran and Tornadus-T handling them. Tornadus-T also provides reliable entry hazard removal so Arctozolt can use Leftovers.</p>"

Its natural bulk and Dauntless Shield give it opportunities to wallbreak via its prowess in offensively checking Mega Lopunny, Hisuian Samurott, and Ogerpon-W. Stone Edge pairs fantastically with Zamazenta's STAB, nailing Volcarona, Zapdos, Moltres, and Tornadus-T while avoiding adverse contact effects from the former three. Ice Fang is Zamazenta's only option to break through Gliscor and Landorus-T and its strongest attack against Dragonite. Heavy Slam is the preferred last coverage move to hit Clefable and render Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant incapable of soft checking Zamazenta, while Crunch threatens Psychic-types in Galarian Slowking, Slowbro, and Mega Latias. Wild Charge is Zamazenta's strongest attack against Toxapex but deals pitiful damage regardless without a Choice Band and can still be easily pivoted against even with the boost. Heavy-Duty Boots increase Zamazenta's longevity, allowing it to switch in and threaten opposing teams more often, whereas Choice Band provides more immediate power, albeit at the cost of being incredibly prediction-reliant to break through most teams carrying multiple Fighting-resistant foes. Rockium Z is a niche alternative that reduces difficulties in KOing Zapdos by minimizing the need for prior chip damage mitigating and Stone Edge's meager accuracy. It also helps in breaking through Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Clefable and Galarian Slowking without the correct coverage move once properly chipped. Tera Fighting is preferred to boost Close Combat's power against neutral targets such as Ogerpon-W and Alomomola, with chances to OHKO and 2HKO them, respectively, without Choice Band and muscle through checks such as Tornadus-T. Alternatively, Tera Steel flips the tables against Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's revenge killing attempts and secures the KO on Clefable after minimal chip. Zamazenta can fit on more defensive teams as speed control that forces out offensive terrors such as Ogerpon-W to supplement a defensive core, or it can be used on offensive teams supported by other wallbreakers while helping check threats to such teams such as Mega Lopunny with its natural bulk and Dauntless Shield. Regardless, its best support remains Future Sight from Tapu Lele, Galarian Slowking, or Slowbro, as Zamazenta is most often handled by switching between Pokemon that resist its moves and physically bulky pivots such as Galarian Slowking, Landorus-T, and Alomomola or stopped in its tracks by Toxapex. Future Sight punishes these situations by dealing massive damage, particularly against Toxapex. Similarly, Pursuit support from Mega Tyranitar and Weavile weakens or removes pivots such as Galarian Slowking, Mega Latias, and Zapdos.</p>"

Alternatively, Crunch can be used to deal with Galarian Slowking and is also stronger than Heavy Slam against Pokemon such as Ferrothorn that commonly Terastallize into the Ghost typing, and Stone Edge is another option that threatens Volcarona and Zapdos while avoiding Flame Body and Static, respectively, and allows Zamazenta to deal with Tornadus-T without the need to Terastallize. Zamazenta struggles to break through Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking, Zapdos, and Toxapex that have the bulk to take multiple boosted Body Press and either threaten it back directly or can use Haze to remove Zamazenta's boosts. Therefore, teammates such as Mega Tyranitar that can Pursuit trap and wear down these Pokemon are invaluable. Other options such as Calm Mind Iron Valiant can also trade for heavy damage against most of these Pokemon, clearing the way for Zamazenta to sweep. Tera Electric allows Zamazenta to turn Zapdos into a setup opportunity, resisting both of its STAB attacks and being unafraid of Static, while Tera Steel allows Zamazenta to set up on Choice-locked Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant as well as turning Heavy Slam into an OHKO on both.</p>"

Thunder Punch is an alternative that threatens Pokemon like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Alomomola. Tera Steel is advised for preventing revenge killing from the likes of Tornadus-T, Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, while granting a Toxic immunity allowing it to use Alomomola as setup fodder.

Addtionally, Surging Strikes allows Urshifu-R to OHKO Focus Sash users like Glimmora and Landorus-T while also improving its matchup against Zamazenta, bypassing its Dauntless Shield Defense boost. U-turn provides Urshifu-R the utility to gain momentum from its checks like Alomomola, Slowbro, Toxapex, and Corviknight.

Facade coupled with a Ground-type STAB move and Fire Punch as coverage allows Ursaluna to break most defensive cores featuring Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Gliscor, Rotom-W, and Toxapex. Headlong Rush is preferred for immediate power, capable of guaranteeing an OHKO on Garganacl to prevent it from afflicting Ursaluna with Salt Cure. Earthquake is an alternative, as not dropping defenses allow Ursaluna to stay in and trade more efficiently with faster threats such as Tapu Lele and Ogerpon-W, which suits teams that have means to heal Ursaluna via Wish from Alomomola or Lunar Dance from Cresselia. Fire Punch is the optimal coverage move to hit Steel-types that are neutral or immune to Ground-type moves, such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Skarmory. Tera Normal cranks up Ursaluna's wallbreaking power to the maximum, now able to OHKO nearly anything at +2; even the bulkiest resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory are KOed once slightly chipped. 164 Speed EVs are used to outrun uninvested Skarmory, but 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD with 0 Speed IVs accompanied by a Brave nature should be used on Trick Room teams. On that note, Ursaluna pairs well with Trick Room setters like Cresselia and Hatterene, as they can alleviate its low Speed as well as potentially provide Lunar Dance and Healing Wish. Unfortunately, outside of Trick Room, Ursaluna is held back by its poor Speed and defensive typing, which, despite its respectable defenses, leaves it unable to switch into many moves and vulnerable to faster offensive foes like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta, especially after it has taken chip damage. It is also prone to having its Flame Orb removed via Knock Off before it can activate, dampening its power significantly. Thus, teammates that can bring Ursaluna in safely, like Corviknight, Rotom-W, and Alomomola, to keep it as healthy as possible are greatly appreciated. Alomomola also has the added benefit of passing Wishes to Ursaluna. In addition, entry hazard setters like Landorus-T and Heatran are good allies, as hazards can further pressure the switches forced by Ursaluna.</p>"

Choice Band is the preferred item for more power so long as it has pivots to fall back on, such as Pelipper, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos. Tera Water is the premier Tera option to pump as much power into Wave Crash as possible, allowing it to 2HKO even Water-resistant foes such as Rotom-W and Ferrothorn. Tera Water also removes its weakness to Sucker Punch from the likes of Hisuian Samurott and Mega Mawile, and it maintains its resistance to Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor, although it removes its immunity to Fake Out from Mega Medicham. This also leaves Basculegion susceptible to Wave Crash's heavy recoil damage, so Liquidation is used to mitigate this, and it should be used once Basculegionâ€™s checks have been worn down in order to ensure that it does not KO itself with recoil. Basculegion thus benefits from an offensive partner like Mega Swampert, which can finish off threats weakened by Basculegion. Pelipper is necessary to set up rain for Basculegion and also serves as a pivot to give it a free switch, something Basculegion has trouble doing, as it prefers to preserve its HP for recoil. Other pivots like Eject Button Ferrothorn and Tornadus-T are also helpful to support Basculegion by giving a point of entry to start breaking.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Basculegion-F finds itself a useful niche on rain teams, that being one of few special rain exploiters in the tier. Its access to Swift Swim as well as strong STAB options in Surf and Shadow Ball allows it to be immensely threatening once it's brought in, and its ability to hit hard on the special side allows it to pick up 2HKOs on many common Water resistances in the tier such as Rotom-W or Toxapex. Swift Swim is a fantastic ability for Basculegion-F, as it allows the capability to run a Modest nature over Timid, boosting Basculegion-F's breaking capabilities even further. A Speed-boosting nature is unnecessary due to hitting a whopping 510 Speed in rain, outrunning almost every Pokemon in the tier except for Choice Scarf Kartana and Iron Valiant in Electric Terrain. Surf is a great option as a reliable STAB move, because its above-average Base Power and perfect accuracy allow it to be spammed with little to no drawback, while Hydro Pump is a great option for the raw power, 2HKOing Tera Grass Heatran with minimal chip damage and OHKOing Mega Charizard Y in sun. Both of these moves are perfectly complemented by Basculegion-F's secondary STAB option, Shadow Ball, which provides neutral coverage against a majority of the metagame. Very few Pokemon can resist Basculegion-F's STAB combination, which is even further bolstered by Ice Beam as a coverage option. Ice Beam allows Basculegion-F to deal serious damage to Pokemon like Tera Grass Heatran and Dragonite. Basculegion-F is also a phenomenal Terastallization user, as it's able to use Tera Water to both shed its weakness to Kingambit's Sucker Punch and boost Surf to terrifying levels of power, making it capable of sweeping most teams with little to no chip damage. Basculegion-F pairs extremely well with Pelipper, since it's able to set rain and use U-turn to bring Basculegion-F in safely. It also appreciates support from the likes of Ferrothorn and Zapdos, as Ferrothorn can answer Iron Valiant's Moonblast and spread chip damage very effectively with Iron Barbs, and Zapdos can check Choice Scarf Kartana and Rillaboom defensively and threaten crippling paralyses. In turn, Basculegion-F supports them back by KOing Pokemon that'd normally be able to force them out or pivot around utilizing resistances and immunities. For example, it can bait Leaf Blade from Kartana to guarantee a safe switch into Zapdos or it can lure Grassy Glide from Rillaboom, allowing Ferrothorn to come in and start spreading chip damage.</p>"

Earth Power and Mystical Fire complement its STAB Moonblast well, with the former hitting Toxapex, Clodsire, Gholdengo, and Heatran, while the latter OHKOes Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Focus Blast grants Enamorus its strongest attack to hit Garganacl and Mega Tyranitar, which could otherwise survive Earth Power and Moonblast, respectively, while Psychic provides a safer middle ground option for Toxapex  Clodsire, and Mega Venusaur, which staves off its attacks otherwise. Tera Fairy grants Enamorus a power boost to Moonblast, notably allowing it to secure OHKOs against the likes of Landorus-T and Rotom-W, which would barely survive it otherwise. Enamorus fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate its wallbreaking power while being able to support it adequately. Pivots such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T grant Enamorus free switch in opportunities against Great Tusk, opposing Landorus-T, and Rotom-W. The latter two pivots and Great Tusk, also provide entry hazard removal, which aids Enamorus given its Stealth Rock weakness.

Alternatively, Enamorus can forgo Mystical Fire for Substitute to take advantage of pivoting attempts as well as sponge attacks from revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and Iron Valiant, although it makes it less effective at hitting Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. If using Substitute, Enamorus can opt for Leftovers instead of the standard Heavy-Duty Boots to potentially set up more Substitutes. Tera Ground boosts the power of Earth Power, allowing it to KO most Toxapex and Gholdengo sets after a boost, as well as giving it an immunity to Tapu Koko and Rotom-W's Electric-type attacks. Enamorus fits best on bulky offense and offense teams that appreciate its use as an early- to mid-game wallbreaker while granting it sufficient opportunities to enter the field. Therefore, pivots such as Mega Lopunny and Landorus-T pair well with it, bringing Enamorus in on physical walls it can exploit such as Great Tusk, Buzzwole, and Skarmory. Additionally, Pursuit trappers such as Mega Tyranitar and Weavile eliminate special walls such as Clodsire and Gholdengo that can serve as a roadblock to Enamorus. Fast late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Choice Scarf Kartana appreciate Enamorus, as they capitalize on it weakening or removing Steel-types for them to clean up.</p>"

Additionally, it can serve as a late-game cleaner once its checks such as Toxapex, Gholdengo, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T have been weakened by its teammates. However, its Stealth Rock weakness and relative frailty mean Enamorus struggles to withstand repeated switches as well as priority moves from the likes of Urshifu-R and Mega Lopunny. Tera Fairy boosts the power of Moonblast, notably allowing it to 2HKO Assault Vest Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock. Aside from coverage to hit Steel-types in Mystical Fire and Earth Power, Healing Wish can bring back a weakened teammate in a pinch, potentially being able to change the tide of a game. Therefore, Enamorus fits best on offense teams that appreciate its utility in Healing Wish while providing a positive matchup against opposing offensive teams. Powerful wallbreakers such as Baxcalibur and Volcarona appreciate Enamorus's Healing Wish, giving them a second lease on life, while Enamorus in turn capitalizes on them weakening the likes of Toxapex and Mega Scizor to clean late-game. Enamorus also greatly enjoys entry hazard removal support from Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, or Great Tusk, as it minimalizes its Stealth Rock weakness so it can switch in more effectively mid-game. Enamorus struggles with special wall such as Clodsire and Gholdengo, so Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Great Tusk make for good partners that can take advantage of them.</p>"

Toxic Spikes, when paired with Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Landorus-T that pressure Toxic Spikes absorbers such as Toxapex and Galarian Slowking, can be hard to deal with and put setup sweepers like Iron Boulder on a timer. Spikes can be used to chip down foes like Ferrothorn and Toxapex after they have had their Heavy-Duty Boots removed. U-turn pivots out Meowscarda from its checks like Toxapex and Ferrothorn and brings in wallbreakers like Urshifu-R and Zamazenta against them. Protective Pads protects Meowscarada from the abilities of Garchomp, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos and Rocky Helmet Pokemon like on Landorus-T, while Heavy-Duty Boots lets it avoid getting worn down by entry hazards. Tera Grass can help Meowscarada survive moves like Moonblast from Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Aqua Jet from Urshifu-R, if Protean has changed its type. Entry hazard setters like Garganacl, Landorus-T, and Gliscor appreciate having Meowscarada as a teammate, as it can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Toxapex and Zapdos, making their hazards more potent. Meowscarada's mediocre defenses and weaknesses to Fighting-, Fire-, and Flying-type attacks mean it appreciates defensive teammates like Clefable, Alomomola, and Ferrothorn that resist or are neutral to those attacks. Meowscarada can pair well with other pivots like Landrous-T and Iron Crown, forming a VoltTurn core to help it deal with its checks like Toxapex.

Will-O-Wisp lets it cripple physical attackers such as Mega Tyranitar, Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T while also punishing Water-types such as Rotom-W. Combined with Will-O-Wisp, Hex helps it overwhelm passive checks in Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Clodsire while also allowing Skeledirge to sweep statused teams. While not as strong as Hex, Shadow Ball is a decent option as it's more consistent. Tera Water allows Skeledirge to beat rain teams by spreading burns against rain sweepers such as Mega Swampert, Barraskewda, and Floatzel. On the other hand, Tera Fairy allows it to counter Dragon Dance Dragapult and avoid Pursuit from Kingambit, Mega Tyranitar, and Weavile while also keeping a Fighting resistance, meaning it can still check Zamazenta. It also removes Skeledirge's Ground weakness, allowing it to comfortably burn Pokemon like Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T. Skeledirge struggles against Heatran and Garganacl, as it can't burn them nor deal significant damage to them. Therefore, Pokemon that pressure them like Garchomp and Rotom-W for the former and Cover Cloak Gholdengo for the latter make good partners. Skeledirge also hates losing its item, so Knock Off absorbers like Flyinium Z Tornadus-T and Gliscor make for good teammates. The former can also weaken Heatran for it while Skeledirge can burn Mega Tyranitar. Special sponges like Gastrodon, Clodsire, and Toxapex all appreciate Skeledirge's ability to cripple physical attackers such as Kartana, Mega Lopunny, and Kingambit, alleviating the pressure these Pokemon exert on them.

Salt Cure heavily chips common Steel- and Water-types such as Heatran, Alomomola, and Ferrothorn while also impairing the longevity of sweepers like Cresselia and opposing Garganacl, making them passive and more easily exploited by teammates. Recover allows Garganacl to check Pokemon like Heatran and Volcarona and increase its sustainability as a sweeper. Tera Water allows Garganacl to check Pokemon like Urshifu-R while providing valuable resistances to other attacks like Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch. Additionally, it allows Garganacl to stave off rain attackers such as Mega Swampert and Barraskewda. Alternatively, Tera Fairy lets Garganacl reliably set up in front of Pokemon like Great Tusk and Zamazenta while becoming a sturdy check to Mega Lopunny. Tera Ghost is another option, letting Garganacl stop Sneasler and Mega Medicham in their tracks, but it must be wary of Pursuit from Weavile and Mega Tyranitar after the fact. Teammates who can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from pivots such as Toxapex and Alomomola greatly assist Garganacl in making progress with the combination of entry hazards and Salt Cure, making Tornadus-T, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar great allies. Additionally, the latter two can trap Galarian Slowking with Pursuit, which would be a major roadblock to Garganacl otherwise. Garganacl also appreciates teammates capable of absorbing Knock Off themselves such as Mega Scizor and Gliscor, as its sweeping potential is hindered severely without the passive recovery of Leftovers. Entry hazard removers like Tornadus-T and Great Tusk are also appreciated, as Garganacl is susceptible to chip damage from entry hazards while trying to switch into pivoting attacks like Zapdos's Volt Switch and Tornadus-T's U-turn. Additionally, it benefits from entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Clodsire and Heatran to outdamage Regenerator on Pokemon such as Toxapex, Tangrowth, and Alomomola. Wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Kartana appreciate their checks in Toxapex and Moltres serving as entry points for Garganacl to wreak havoc.</p>"

Garganacl can safely set up Stealth Rock against common pivots like Ferrothorn, Alomomola, and Galarian Slowking. Common Defog users like Zapdos, Corviknight, and Moltres can barely threaten Garganacl and take dangerous passive damage from Salt Cure. Other entry hazard removal Pokemon like Landorus-T and Great Tusk also dislike Salt Cure as they rely on Leftovers for passive recovery. Protect is crucial for Garganacl for passive recovery from Leftovers and to exacerbate chip damage from Salt Cure. It can also help to scout moves from Choice item users like Tapu Lele and Rillaboom, as well as stalling weather turns against rain and sun teams. However, it is important not to rely on Protect too much to the point where Garganacl can be exploited by opponents. Garganacl has a variety of good Tera types; Tera Water turns the tables versus Pokemon like Urshifu-Rapid-Strike and Mega Scizor and performs better against rain and sun, but leaves it vulernable to opposing Garganacl and Electric-types like Raging Bolt and Tapu Koko. Tera Dragon has most of the advantages of Tera Water in addition to checking Ogerpon-W and Mega Charizard Y, but it makes Garganacl weak to Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele. Tera Fairy and Tera Ghost both help Garganacl to check Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny. Teammates like Ogerpon-W and Mega Lopunny appreciate Garganacl's ability to threaten Water- and Flying-types. Garganacl also benefits from them dealing with offensive targets like Tapu Lele and opposing Ogerpon-W. Garganacl's main way to gain momentum is via Salt Cure, so foes with Abilities like Regenerator and Poison Heal can nullify its chip damage.

Curse in conjunction with Terastallization lets it take hits from common physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T, and its ability prevents it from getting Toxic poisoned, a major roadblock to slow setup sweepers. Salt Cure allows Garganacl to chip foes and is complemented by Attack boosts from Curse; it also discourages common threats to Garganacl like Iron Crown and Urshifu-R from switching in directly. Earthquake hits almost all foes for decent damage with enough boosts, threatening Steel- and Electric-types like Iron Crown, Raging Bolt, Galarian Slowking, and Tapu Koko for particularly high damage; Salt Cure covers Flying-types that Earthquake cannot reach. Heavy Slam deals immediate damage to Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Clefable, which threaten to deal massive damage with their STAB moves or are immune to Salt Cure's passive damage in the latter's case. Tera Water allows Garganacl to beat common Water-types like Manaphy, Urshifu-R, and Mega Swampert, giving its team a positive matchup against rain teams. Tera Fairy allows Garganacl to resist Fighting-type moves from Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny, especially when unboosted, as Garganacl gets several free turns to set up after surprising these foes. Garganacl is a fat momentum sapper that lends itself well to balance teams, as they are able to compensate for its lack of immediate power with their ability to withstand heavy damage; Alomomola, a commonly seen Pokemon on these archetypes, is a great ally that can heal up Garganacl, allowing it to be used more recklessly with Salt Cure to offset the passivity of other allies. Garganacl is extremely hampered by Taunt and Knock Off users, as they prevent it from setting up and healing and prevent Leftovers passive recovery. It is best to wait for such foes to be eliminated before trying to set up. Therefore, Knock Off absorbers like Mega Scizor and Gliscor are good teammates to threaten Knock Off users including Hisuian Samurott and Ferrothorn. Garganacl performs best when used with Terastallization, as its base typing gives it nasty weaknesses to common foes like Zamazenta and Landorus-T; thus, allies should try not to expend Terastallization early-game. This means that a solid defensive core, such as Alomomola and Heatran, should be used to help with the longevity of the team and can chip down foes until it is safe to set up.</p>"

Power Gem threatens the metagame's best Defogger in Tornadus-T, while Sludge Bomb dents screens setters such as Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko andâ€”if Focus Sash is still intactâ€”Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant as well, which can be problematic against offensive teams. Earth Power pressures Steel-types like Heatran, Gholdengo, and Kingambit that would otherwise block Glimmora's Mortal Spin, while Energy Ball deals with other entry hazard setters and removers such as Great Tusk, Gastrodon, Mega Swampert, and Rotom-W. Focus Sash guarantees that Glimmora can set at least one layer of entry hazards, potentially letting Toxic Debris trigger twice as well. Tera Ghost is used in a pinch to spinblock foes such as Great Tusk and Excadrill and remove its Ground weakness to set up multiple entry hazards in the face of other setters like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gastrodon. Gholdengo is a near-mandatory teammate to keep up entry hazards by blocking every attempts to remove them, such as Defog and Rapid Spin. Setup sweepers like Kingambit, Volcarona, Dragapult, Dragonite, and Iron Valiant appreciate entry hazards wearing down foes such as Dondozo and Clodsire and not being chipped down by opposing ones themselves; particularly, Kingambit's Knock Off can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Volcarona to make them vulnerable to Glimmora's entry hazards.</p>"

Liquidation is Dondozo's STAB move of choice for its slightly higher Base Power increasing its odds of 2HKOing targets such as Heatran and Landorus-T after Stealth Rock, while Waterfall is appreciated for its higher PP. Curse aids Dondozo in taking even less damage from physical attackers while potentially turning it into a late-game wincon, while Body Press is an option to hit Water-resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Urshifu-R, and Ogerpon-W. Rest is Dondozo's only option for recovery, while Sleep Talk allows Dondozo to damage Pokemon while asleep, preventing it from being completely passive.

Special walls such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, Gliscor, and Blissey check special attackers that Dondozo struggles with, such as Volcarona, Zapdos, and Rotom-W; the aforementioned Ground-types also provide an immunity to Volt Switch from Zapdos and Rotom-W, which Dondozo would otherwise grant free pivoting opportunities to. Solid Knock Off absorbers such as Gliscor and Tornadus-T pair well with Dondozo, as losing its item would open up to it taking entry hazard damage. However, if Dondozo opts to use Leftovers, Gliscor and Tornadus-T can act as Defoggers to alleviate entry hazard pressure. Electric Terrain offense teams trouble Dondozo by cutting off its recovery, so teammates such as Toxapex and Gliscor aid it against common threats on such teams, including Iron Valiant and Sneasler. On stall teams, Wish passers such as Alomomola and Clefable allow Dondozo to switch into such attackers and regain its lost HP.</p>"

Great Tusk hates having to deal with Zapdos and Moltres due to being threatened by Static and Flame Body, so Pokemon that can deal with them, such as Tapu Koko and Mega Tyranitar, are appreciated.

Ice Spinner lets it break past Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Landorus. Rapid Spin acts as a secondary boosting move for Great Tusk, alleviating its mediocre Speed tier and allowing it to sweep undeterred. The given EV spread allows Great Tusk to outspeed Ogerpon-W after a Rapid Spin boost, with the rest used to maximize its physical bulk. Tera Poison prevents Great Tusk from being hit by Toxic while providing crucial resistances to Fairy- and Fighting-type attacks. Tera Electric provides a Flying resistance, allowing Great Tusk to use Zapdos and Tornadus-T as setup fodder while also preventing it from getting paralyzed by Static. Tera Steel combines the Flying resistance from Electric with the Fairy resistance and Toxic immunity from Poison while adding on a Psychic resistance at the cost of being weak to Fighting. Due to its relatively low Speed tier even after a boost, Great Tusk will need help against revenge killers like Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, so Pokemon that can handle the two, such as Mega Scizor, Slowking-G, and Heatran, are appreciated. A more offensive set utilising Booster Energy can also be used on hyper offense teams, but it is generally less effective compared to other choices.</p>"

Wish and Protect provide Scream Tail with recovery, with the latter also scouting Choice-locked Pokemon such as Dragapult and Kartana. Dazzling Gleam punishes Great Tusk and Iron Valiant and prevents them from freely exploiting Scream Tail. Encore pairs excellently with Scream Tail's high Speed, allowing it to shut down setup sweepers such as Urshifu-R, Cresselia, and Garchomp for its teammates to defeat. Leftovers provides Scream Tail with recovery that makes it less susceptible to being exploited by Wish, granting Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Heatran free switches. The given EVs maximize Scream Tail's bulk while allowing it to outspeed Enamorus and shut down Calm Mind variants with Encore. An alternative spread of 120 HP / 236 SpD / 152 Spe can be used to outspeed Hydreigon while receiving a Special Defense boost in Mega Charizard Y's sun, further amplifying Scream Tail's bulk and allowing it to check Charizard under sun. Tera Steel grants a resistance to Ice- and Fairy-type attacks from Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant in a pinch, while Tera Fairy ensures Scream Tail resists Pursuit from Weavile and Mega Tyranitar and increases the power of Dazzling Gleam to potentially 2HKO and OHKO Garchomp and Iron Valiant, respectively. Scream Tail fits best on defensively oriented teams that appreciate its unique defensive attributes while being able to support it sufficiently in return. Pokemon with unreliable recovery such as Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Assault Vest Toxapex appreciate Scream Tail's high-HP Wishes, while in return they check Pokemon Scream Tail struggles with such as Mega Scizor and Volcarona. Due to its reliance on Protect and Leftovers for passive recovery, entry hazard control from teammates such as the aforementioned Great Tusk and Tornadus-T can help mitigate its recovery. Scream Tail's passive nature means it can be exploited by Steel-types such as Gholdengo, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, so Pokemon that aid against them while providing a more dangerous presence such as Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, and Swords Dance Gliscor pair well with it.</p>"

Close Combat is the preferred Fighting-type STAB move over Aura Sphere or Focus Blast because it can do more damage to foes like Heatran and Iron Boulder while maintaining strength and accuracy. Knock Off is an excellent way of making progress, as it can remove items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers on common walls like Galarian Slowking, Alomomola, and Landorus-T, and it can provide valuable coverage for Psychic-types like Galarian Slowking and Iron Crown. Trick is fantastic against more passive teams and can cripple switch-ins like Toxapex and Alomomola. It can also lock setup sweepers like Volcarona into one move, making them much easier to deal with. Destiny Bond, on the other hand, can be used as an emergency plan to trade with foes like Ogerpon-W and Gouging Fire, especially after they acquire several boosts. Tera Fairy can increase the power of Moonblast, guaranteeing a 2HKO against utility Tornadus-T and Zapdos and an OHKO against Zamazenta. Teammates like Hisuian Samurott and Ogerpon-W pair well with Iron Valiant, since they can pressure foes like Galarian Slowking and Alomomola. In addition, Hisuian Samurott can also stack Spikes via Ceaseless Edge, which greatly helps Iron Valiant with its lack of power, as it can often remove Heavy-Duty Boots from key targets such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Galarian Slowking with Knock Off or Trick. Iron Valiant appreciates teammates like Mega Scizor and Zapdos to help it deal with Iron Boulder and Hawlucha, which are capable of outspeeding it.</p>"

Ogerponâ€™s unique Speed boost upon Terastallizing and ability to hold an item give it more potential to clean through a weakened team while outrunning common revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Kartana. However, Ogerpon faces stiff competition from other offensive Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Kartana, as well as the other Ogerpon formes that possess a beneficial dual typing and an automatic 1.2x boost to their attacks. Superpower allows Ogerpon to wreak havoc on defensive cores using Ferrothorn and Heatran as Grass-type switch-ins, scoring a clean OHKO on Heatran and heavily denting physically defensive Ferrothorn after a Swords Dance. Meadow Plate is the item of choice, OHKOing Gliscor after Swords Dance with Stealth Rock chip, as well as potentially OHKOing Toxapex after Tera Grass and Swords Dance. Knock Off is Ogerpon's strongest option to hit Tornadus-T, Moltres, Zapdos, and Galarian Slowking. Additionally, Defiant leverages Landorus-T's Intimidate against it; however, its poor matchup versus Defog users such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Corviknight render it unable to effectively switch in on Defog attempts and activate Defiant. Teammates that match up effectively into these aforementioned Defog users, such as Ting Lu, Mega Tyranitar, and Gliscor, serve as quality teammates, with Mega Tyranitar in particular being able to chip these foes into range of Ogerpon's attacks. Skarmory and Corviknight are also major roadblocks for Ogerpon, so teammates that can switch into them and force progress like Zapdos and Heatran make for effective teammates.</p>"

        "description": "<p>A complementary typing and a great Attack stat, especially when considering the 1.2x boost from its Wellspring Mask, give Ogerpon-W a niche as a powerful wallbreaker. Water- and Grass-type attacks hit most Pokemon for at least neutral damage, and after a Swords Dance boost, anything that doesn't resist its STAB combination is KOed. Even checks such as Baxcalibur and Tera Grass Heatran struggle to take a Swords Dance-bolstered Ivy Cudgel, and some of the stoutest walls, such as Toxapex, take heavy damage from a boosted Power Whip. Ivy Cudgel is its strongest Water-type STAB option and hits most Pokemon for neutral damage. Power Whip punishes common Water-resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Alomomola and is preferred to Wood Hammer despite the potential inaccuracy to avoid recoil. Horn Leech can also be used in order to supplement Ogerpon-W's longevity and let it come in more often. Trailblaze is another niche option, usually seen on Aurora Veil or dual screens hyper offense teams, boosting Ogerpon-W's Speed and allowing it to sweep. Play Rough notably hits Dragon-types that otherwise could resist Ogerpon-W's STAB combination such as Baxcalibur and Dragonite. Superpower is another great option, notably KOing Ferrothorn after a Swords Dance boost. Due to its great wallbreaking capability, setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Booster Energy Iron Valiant appreciate defensive cores being heavily weakened, allowing them to sweep. Water Absorb is a particularly useful ability prior to Terastallizing, as Ogerpon-W can find opportunities to set up on Pokemon such as Mega Swampert and Manaphy, as well as block Alomomola's Flip Turn. Ogerpon-W also appreciates entry hazards from Hisuian Samurott and Landorus-T, as the chip helps it pressure defensive cores even further. Despite all this, bulky Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Kartana can check Ogerpon-W, so Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Mega Medicham, and Zapdos are beneficial as teammates. Ogerpon-W is also threatened by faster attackers like Iron Valiant and Mega Lopunny, so defensive pivots such as Landorus-T, Galarian Slowking, and Mega Scizor are also extremely useful. Despite being locked to Tera Water, this is actually very beneficial to Ogerpon-W, taking away its weaknesses to Flying- and Poison-type attacks and letting it stay in on threats such as Tornadus-T and Sneasler. In addition, Tera Water boosts its Ivy Cudgel to stupendous amounts, 2HKOing Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock and minimal chip at +2. The 1.5x Special Defense boost granted upon Terastallizing can also help mitigate attempts to revenge kill Ogerpon-W by foes like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo.</p>"

However, Ogerpon-C should be mindful about using its Tera, as this removes its Sturdy for an arguably worse +1 Defense. Power Whip is used for its higher Base Power, which reduces Ogerpon-C's reliance on Swords Dance for immediate power, while Horn Leech trades damage for healing and reliability. Superpower allows Ogerpon-C to hit Ferrothorn, although this breaks Sturdy, along with Tera Steel foes like Iron Valiant. Ogerpon-C's main weakness lies in its reliance on Sturdy to set up against more powerful foes and its lack of immediate power before setting up. Thus, it is better off being saved as a cleaner for the later stages of a game. Entry hazard support, in particular Spikes, is highly valued to allow Ogerpon-C to KO many more threats; it can capitalize on hazard chip, for instance KOing even bulky foes like defensive Great Tusk unboosted once they are chipped. Thus, allies that can set hazards early-game like Hisuian Samurott and Garchomp are good partners. Ogerpon-C is also held back by its middling Speed tier, which leaves it susceptible to being revenge killed by Mega Lopunny, as it is capable of bypassing Sturdy, along with many other foes like Iron Valiant if Ogerpon-C has already lost Sturdy. Thus, Pokemon like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele that can threaten these frailer foes make for good allies.</p>"

The dual STAB moves and Electro Shot are must-haves for Archaludon as a rain wallbreaker; the last slot, however, is a bit flexible. Body Press and Aura Sphere both complement Archaludon's coverage to break through Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Heatran. The former receives a boost from Stamina and deals with Heatran and Ting-Lu better, while the latter is more consistent with Electro Shot boosts in rain and avoids chip damage from Iron Barbs. Stealth Rock can be used as an alternative choice on non-Assault Vest sets to allow teammates like Mega Swampert to run coverage moves like Ice Punch and Ferrothorn to run Spikes. Archaludon can threaten premier entry hazard removers such as Tornadus-T and Landorus-T, ensuring Stealth Rock stays up. Depending on the pacing of the team, different items and EV spreads are available for Archaludon. Leftovers is used to increase its longevity, which helps long-term. Eject Pack can be favored to keep the momentum up by preventing Archaludon from being stuck on the field against pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Assault Vest Iron Crown after its Special Attack is lowered by Draco Meteor. Assault Vest makes up for Archaludon's weak Special Defense and often lets it trade with one or more offensive threats like Tapu Lele and Iron Moth. To pair with Assault Vest, a bulky spread of 204 HP EVs is used, while 52 Speed EVs still allow Archaludon to outspeed uninvested Landorus-T. Tera Flying provides an immunity to Ground-type moves from Landorus-T and Garchomp and a resistance to Fighting-type moves from the likes of Zamazenta. Tera Fairy also grants a resistance to Fighting-type moves and is a better defensive type overall due to only having a few weaknesses as well as not being weak to Stealth Rock. Pelipper is a necessary teammate, as its Drizzle enables Archaludon to take advantage of Electro Shot. Other Water-type wallbreakers such as Mega Swampert and Ogerpon-W are also appreciated for their ability to break through bulky Ground-type Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Gliscor. In return, those Water-type wallbreakers appreciate Archaludon's ability to beat opposing Ogerpon-W.</p>"

Outrage can be used as a nuke with Dragonium Z, letting Gouging Fire muscle past walls such as Dondozo through its sheer strength alone. Tera Ground can be used to power up Gouging Fire's Earthquake while allowing it to remove its weaknesses to revenge killers such as Booster Energy Iron Boulder and Great Tusk, allowing it to potentially win on the spot.

Flare Blitz allows Gouging Fire to hit heavier Pokemon that Gouging Fire can't hit as hard with Heat Crash, like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu. Raging Fury is an alternative option to this, as it is not a contact move and does not deal recoil damage. 168 Attack EVs and a Jolly Nature allow it to gain a Speed boost under sun with Protosynthesis. Even with this combination, Gouging Fire is still stopped by heavier foes that are also very physically bulky, such as Garganacl, Great Tusk and Dondozo. Choice Band Gouging Fire is also very prone to entry hazard chip, as it does not hold Heavy-Duty Boots. Because of these reasons, Gouging Fire largely appreciates hazard removal options like Great Tusk and Iron Treads that also synergize well with sun setters, which are Torkoal and Mega Charizard Y. Great Tusk is great under sun as it can be a good wallbreaking partner with an Attack Protosynthesis boost. Great Tusk is also able to help wallbreak against some other Fire-resistant foes, such as Garganacl, chipped Alomomola, and opposing Great Tusk. Iron Treads , on the other hand, has Volt Switch to bring Gouging Fire in safely. Gouging Fire also greatly appreciates Pokemon that can threaten Alomomola and Dondozo on their weaker Special Defense side, like Raging Bolt and Mega Charizard Y. Raging Bolt can threaten Gouging Fire's common switch-ins like Dondozo and Alomomola with powerful Special attacks and super effective STAB moves and also use Volt Switch to bring Gouging Fire in very easily. Gouging Fire also supports Raging Bolt by threatening the Ground-types and Electric-resistant foes that can switch into it, such as Gliscor, Ferrothorn, Landorus-T. Mega Charizard Y is one of Gouging Fire's best partners, as it sets up sun with Drought, allowing Gouging Fire to boost its Speed with Protosynthesis, and can also break holes into opposing teams with Solar Beam and powerful Fire-type moves.</p>"

Thunderclap offsets Raging Boltâ€™s subpar Speed stat, allowing it to revenge kill offensive threats such as Urshifu-R, Ogerpon-W, and Mega Lopunny as well as weakened setup sweepers like Iron Boulder, Volcarona, and Swords Dance Kartana, while Thunderbolt gives Raging Bolt a consistent damaging attack that doesnâ€™t rely on prediction like Thunderclap and has significantly higher PP, allowing Raging Bolt to use its Electric-type moves in longer games. Substitute is an alternative to nullify passive PokÃ©mon that canâ€™t touch Raging Bolt such as Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos and give it more opportunities to set up, while Taunt can be used to deny setup from Garganacl and Mega Scizor but at the cost of a worse matchup against Galarian Slowking. Draco Meteor in tandem with Dragonium Z lets it break through Electric-immune Pokemon such as Gliscor, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu as well as other specially bulky PokÃ©mon that can take on Raging Bolt such as Mega Tyranitar and Galarian Slowking. Alternatively, Leftovers is also an option on Substitute sets to passively heal the chip taken from Substitute and give Raging Bolt some form of recovery. Tera Flying grants Raging Bolt a Ground immunity while giving a Fighting resistance that helps against Great Tusk and Zamazenta while also avoiding any Ground-type coverage from Serperior. Tera Fairy gives this same Fighting resistance while giving Raging Bolt an immunity to Dragon-type moves from the likes of Garchomp and Gouging Fire. The given EV spread allows Raging Bolt to live a +2 Superpower from Ogerpon-W after Stealth Rock, as well as outspeeding uninvested Landorus-T. Raging Bolt struggles against fast Ground- and Fairy-types like Garchomp, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Great Tusk, Tapu Koko, Iron Valiant, and especially Tapu Lele; Tapu Lele in particular can give Raging Bolt some trouble as well, as its Psychic Surge renders Thunderclap useless.

Close Combat has great coverage alongside Mighty Cleave and hits Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Garganacl, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Tyranitar for massive damage, being able to OHKO all of them at +2 Attack with Tera Fighting. Zen Headbutt hits Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Urshifu-R. Substitute allows Iron Boulder to scout for switches, as well as become immune to certain status moves like Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp. Iron Boulder can use Tera Flying to become immune to Earthquake that would otherwise OHKO it from Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Great Tusk. If your team has Tapu Koko to provide Electric Terrain, one option is to use Rockium Z over Booster Energy to power up Mighty Cleave to insane levels, OHKOing Gliscor and all but the bulkiest Landorus-T with Stealth Rock support after a Swords Dance. However, this option does make Iron Boulder dependent on Electric Terrain to retain its boosted Speed. Tapu Koko can also set up Reflect and Light Screen to help facilitate a sweep. Iron Boulder fits best on highly offensive teams, and functions as a late-game cleaner as well as a emergency check to speedy threats including Dragon Dance users like Gouging Fire and Booster Energy Iron Valiant. Fighting-types like Great Tusk, Mega Lopunny, and Urshifu-R benefit from having Iron Boulder on the team, as Iron Boulder can take advantage of and switch into Flying-types such as Zapdos and Tornadus-T that such allies are weak to. Teammates such as Hawlucha, Kartana and Iron Valiant can appreciate Rockium Z Iron Boulder's massive damage onto Landorus-T and Gliscor. Non-Rockium Z Iron Boulder can struggle with Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Great Tusk. Because of this, having a switch-in like your own Landorus-T or Gliscor is very helpful. Additionally, Iron Boulder can be revenge killed by Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, so having answers to it like Volcarona and Gouging Fire is important. Iron Boulder appreciates hazard support from Pokemon like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Glimmora, as it can chip checks that would otherwise just fall short of a KO. Furthermore, physical wallbreakers such as Kartana and Mega Lopunny that can put Landorus-T and Gliscor in range of a +2 Mighty Cleave are also appreciated, especially since Gliscor canâ€™t use Protect to heal with Poison Heal against Mighty Cleave, and Landorus-T doesn't have any reliable recovery.

However, its lack of longevity means it can be worn down very quickly by Spikes damage, making it only suitable for highly aggressive offense teams. Volt Switch complements such teams, bringing Iron Crown's wallbreaking teammates in safely against passive switch-ins such as Ferrothorn and Galarian Slowking. Psychic Noise punishes passive Pokemon which attempt to absorb Iron Crown's Volt Switch such as Gliscor and Ferrothorn by preventing them from healing, whereas Tachyon Cutter threatens less specially bulky Volt Switch blockers such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Future Sight combined with Volt Switch helps teammates such as Zamazenta and Urshifu-R. Alternatively, Focus Blast lets Iron Crown be more individually threatening, scaring Ferrothorn and Heatran, and dealing slightly more damage to Ting-Lu and Mega Tyranitar compared to Tachyon Cutter. The given EV spread maximizes Iron Crown's special bulk while allowing it to receive a Special Attack boost in Electric Terrain via Quark Drive, permitting it to be more threatening on offensive teams. A Calm nature and maximum Special Defense investment can be used instead to bolster Iron Crown's special bulk, especially if it forgoes Assault Vest for the increased longevity Heavy-Duty Boots provides. Tera Fairy is Iron Crown's preferred Tera type to invert its Dark weakness against Darkrai, Mega Tyranitar, and Hisuian Samurott; as another option Tera Water provides a Water resistance in a pinch against aggressive rain teams. Iron Crown fits best on offensive teams that appreciate a non-passive defensive backbone against special attackers that can provide support via pivoting and Future Sight. Landorus-T is its best partner, as it functions similarly as a pivot with access to Stealth Rock and U-Turn, complementing Iron Crown by checking physical attackers such as Garchomp and Gouging Fire. It also provides an Electric immunity, which Iron Crown appreciates as it fails to prevent Raging Bolt and Zapdos from freely setting up Calm Mind or pivoting with Volt Switch, respectively. In the same vein, Alomomola forms a potent defensive core alongside Iron Crown, pivoting into physical attackers and increasing Iron Crown's longevity via Wish support. Iron Crown's usage of Psychic Noise is bolstered by entry hazard support from Ferrothorn and Heatran, as Psychic Noise ensures entry hazard damage sticks by disabling foes' passive Leftovers recovery. Iron Crown pairs well with Pokemon that pressure Ground-types such as Ogerpon-W and Urshifu-R, as they prevent Gliscor and Ting-Lu from hindering its functions as a pivot. Alternatively, Pokemon such as Mega Medicham and Ursaluna can utilize Iron Crown pivoting out against walls such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Galarian Slowking to find opportunites to wallbreak. Additionally, Iron Crown finds a role on Electric Terrain teams fueled by Tapu Koko, with a Quark Drive boost making it more threatening or even bulkier. In return, Iron Crown indirectly supports Tapu Koko by helping fellow teammates on Electric Terrain teams such as Hawlucha and Iron Valiant wallbreak, with Future Sight pressuring checks such as Toxapex and Zapdos.</p>"

Focus Blast is a powerful coverage move that hits Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Hisuian Samurott, which are immune to Stored Power, for super effective damage. Iron Defense complements Calm Mind to turn Iron Crown into a nigh-indestructible powerhouse and provides a boost to Stored Power, while Tachyon Cutter can be used for its immediate damage output against Fairy-types and Garganacl or to better deal with opposing Psychic-type Pokemon such as Iron Boulder and Mega Latias better. Tera Fighting makes Focus Blast a STAB move, allowing it to OHKO Heatran unboosted and Ferrothorn at +1, as well as giving Iron Crown a resistance to Dark-type moves from Darkrai and Tyranitar that it would be weak to otherwise. Tera Flying provides an immunity to Ground-type moves from Landorus-T and Garchomp and a resistance to Fighting-type moves from the likes of Zamazenta, and is a better defensive type overall due to it only having a few weaknesses. Calm Mind Iron Crown only becomes dangerous after a few boosts, therefore, dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko are exceptional partners, as their screens provide more opportunities for Iron Crown to start setting up. Iron Crown also has great synergy with Tapu Lele, which provides Psychic Terrain to prevent it from being revenge killed by priority moves like Thunder Clap from Raging Bolt and Sucker Punch from Hisuian Samurott and Mega Mawile, as well as increase the damage of Stored Power.</p>"
