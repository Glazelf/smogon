        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Dragapult is one of the most dangerous setup sweepers in the tier due to its blazing Speed and immense power. After a Dragon Dance, Dragapult outspeeds all Choice Scarf and Booster Energy users, such as Kartana, Greninja, and Iron Valiant, making it extremely hard to stop if it sets up successfully. Ghostium Z-powered Phantom Force enables a boosted Dragapult to blast through bulky Steel-types such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Heatran after slight chip damage. Dragapult's typing gives it opportunities to switch in and set up against certain Pokemon such as Volcarnoa, non-Ice Spinner Dragonite, and Urshifu-R locked into a Fighting-type move. Substitute is the preferred option in the last moveslot to ease prediction and facilitate setup while also avoiding priority. Substitute also allows Dragapult to play mind games with Kingambit. Fire Blast is another option that allows Dragapult to deal massive damage to physically defensive Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, both of which can survive a boosted Never-Ending Nightmare at full health. Clear Body is the preferred ability to avoid stat drops from Intimidate, but Infiltrator can also be used to improve the matchup against dual screens and Shed Tail teams. A Jolly nature lets Dragapult outspeed Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko prior to setting up. Dragon Dance Dragapult fits best on offensive teams, where it can function as a potent late-game cleaner with its Z-Move. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Glimmora can help chip bulky foes such as Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit into range of Dragapult's attacks. Gholdengo can block attempts to remove entry hazards, as well as pressure certain physical walls that give Dragapult a hard time, such as Ferrothorn. Dragapult can struggle with bulky physical walls such as Dondozo, Garganacl, and post-Tera Skeledirge, so powerful special wallbreakers that can take advantage of these Pokemon, such as Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard Y, are greatly appreciated. Tapu Lele also provides Psychic Terrain, which thwarts revenge killing attempts from priority moves. A late-game cleaner such as Dragonite or Booster Energy Iron Valiant can take advantage of the holes Dragapult left behind in the enemy defensive core.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Annihilape's amazing bulk and the fantastic Rage Fist make it an amazing late-game wincon and wallbreaker. Bulk Up makes it harder for foes such as Great Tusk and Dragonite to break through it, as well as allowing it to break through defensive Pokemon like Buzzwole and Mega Scizor. Taunt prevents status, recovery, and set up from Pokemon like Skeledirge, Mega Scizor, and Landorus-T while also forcing foes to damage Annihilape, boosting the power of Rage Fist. Rage Fist lacks no switch-in once boosted up and allows Annihilape to demolish Pokemon that wouldn't mind it unboosted, such as Gholdengo and Mega Scizor. It also notably invalidates Unaware, enabling it to break through Pokemon like Clodsire and Skeledirge. Drain Punch provides Annihilape with some additional recovery, preventing it from being worn down quickly. Rest combined with Chesto Berry can be used over Taunt, as it provides Annihilape with a one-time way to recover HP and status, as well as being the premier way to heal from strong incoming hits, but it can be easily exploited if the foe is able to chip down Annihilape enough. Tera Water is the premier option, as it boosts Annihilape's defensive profile, giving it resists to moves like Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes and Gholdengo's Make It Rain. Fairy is another option that gives Annihilape nice resistances to moves like Mega Lopunny's Close Combat and an immunity to Draco Meteor or Dragon Darts from Dragapult. Tera Fire gives Annihilape an immunity to Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon like Skeledirge and Rotom-W while giving it a Fairy resistance as well, preventing the likes of Mega Diancie and Iron Valiant from revenge killing it. Notably, all of these types give Annihilape a Flying- and Ghost-type neutrality, preventing Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Dragapult, and Gholdengo from revenge killing it as easily. 28 Speed EVs help Annihilape outspeed Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar, Gholdengo, and Rotom-W. The other EVs maximize its special bulk, letting it take hits comfortably from Pokemon like Heatran and Volcarona. Dual screens setters like Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl let Annihilape tank hits more easily. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Ferrothorn, and Heatran to wear down Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele is appreciated. Allies like Heatran and Tyranitar handle Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Tornadus-T, with Annihilape cleaning up once the aformentioned threats are removed.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Annihilape carves a niche in being a Stealth Rock user that is immune to Rapid Spin from foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Annihilape being a Defog deterrent due to Defiant, as well as its bulk and Final Gambit picking up easy KOs also strengthens this niche. Final Gambit lets Annihilape safely bring in a teammate while dealing massive damage due to its large HP stat. Taunt denies other entry hazards from being set up by Pokemon like Ting-Lu and preventing the use of Defog from Pokemon like Rotom-W and Tornadus-T on the switch. Defog can also activate Defiant, giving Annihilape way more offensive output for Rage Fist and making it easier to pick up a KO. Annihilape won't be Terastallizing often, but Tera Ghost can be used to boost the power of Rage Fist in scenarios where it is boosted, and it gives Annihilape neutralities to moves like Mega Diancie's Moonblast and Tornadus-T's Hurricane or Bleakwind Storm. Annihilape fits on hyper offense exclusively, so Pokemon that benefit from entry hazards being simultaneously denied and set up, such as Espathra and Dragonite, are good partners. Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Mega Diancie are very big problems for Annihilape, so partners like Gholdengo and Mega Scizor are very valuable. Final Gambit removing Pokemon like Great Tusk and Tornadus-T can also be a big help to teammates like Kingambit and Dragonite.</p> "
