[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@pkmn/smogon.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pkmn/smogon)

[Rich client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_client) for the processed and aggregated
[Smogon](https://smogon.com) analysis and moveset information available at
[https://data.pkmn.cc](https://data.pkmn.cc).

On its face, `@pkmn/smogon` is similar to
[`@smogon/sets`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@smogon/sets) with respect to the data that it
provides, with several notable differences:

- `@smogon/sets` contains preprocessed and validated `PokemonSet` data gleaned from Smogon, usage
  statistics and third-party sources, grouped by format and generation. `@pkmn/smogon` contains no
  data, instead taking in a [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
  API-compatible client and using it to retrieve sets data from
  [https://data.pkmn.cc](https://data.pkmn.cc), where the data is also grouped by generation and
  format but is in the form of a `Moveset` as opposed to a `PokemonSet` and `@pkmn/smogon` does the
  work of converting between the two.
- `@pkmn/smogon` does not contain any of the usage statistics or third-party sets that
  `@smogon/sets` provides, nor does it validate the sets it returns (though even `@smogon/sets`'s
  data is not guaranteed to be valid given that validation rules change over time).
- `@pkmn/smogon` fetches the latest data as opposed to `@smogon/sets` where the data only updates
   approximately monthly when a new package is released.
- `@pkmn/smogon` supports returning analysis and moveset information as opposed to just sets, and
  also can return `@pkmn/stats`-formatted usage statistics output.

Whereas `@smogon/sets` uses [`smogon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smogon) to handle fetching the
raw data from Smogon, `@pkmn/smogon` relies on the preprocessed data hosted at
[https://data.pkmn.cc](https://data.pkmn.cc). `@pkmn/smogon` is strictly fresher and more powerful,
but `@smogon/sets` may still be appealing for the simplicity it provides.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install @pkmn/smogon
```

## Usage

You must provide a `fetch` function to initialize the `Smogon` - this can be the native `fetch`
class in the browser or `node-fetch` on Node, or something which implements the rudimentary aspects
of the `fetch` interface required by `Smogon` to make a request. Additionally, the methods on
`Smogon` require something that implements `Generation` from `@pkmn/data` as their first
parameter - the simplest way to accomplish this is by instantiating a `Generation` from `@pkmn/data`
with a `Dex` from `@pkmn/dex` or `@pkmn/sim`:

```ts
import {Dex} from '@pkmn/dex';
import {Generations} from '@pkmn/data';
import {Smogon} from '@pkmn/smogon';
// import fetch from 'node-fetch';

const gens = new Generations(dex);
const smogon = new Smogon(fetch);

smogon.sets(gens.get(8), 'Dragapult');
smogon.sets(gens.get(6), 'Clefable', 'gen6ubers');

smogon.analyses(gens.get(4), 'Jirachi');
smogon.analyses(gens.get(2), 'Blastoise', 'gen2uu');

smogon.stats(gens.get(1), 'Snorlax');
smogon.stats(gens.get(7), 'Greninja-Ash', 'gen7monotype');
```

By default, `Smogon` will retrieve an entire generation's worth of analysis/moveset data (which can
be as much as ~15MB uncompressed) and cache the result (stats will always only fetch a format's
worth of stats, though that in itself is also sizeable). If bandwidth/memory/space is a concern, a
second parameter can be passed to the `Smogon` constructor to trigger 'minimal' mode where only
analysis/moveset data for specific formats will be requested in scenarios where a format parameter
is passed to the methods (if no format method is passed, only data from formats which have already
been cached will be returned).
